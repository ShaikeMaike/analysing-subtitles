Toss'em and bag'em.
Enjoy.
It's good.
Not great.
But seeing that you are a business man, Mr. Santiago.
Captain.
Captain.
My associates and I are willing to negotiate, a reasonable price.
Let's say, 100,000.
One million for the entire take,
Not a penny less.
A steep price for a small catch.
A pod of 20,000 sharks are migrating in this direction.
When we're through with it,
One million will look like a bargain.
If you're looking to negotiate, Mr.
Palmer, look for the insurance salesman.
I do believe we have a deal.
All hands on deck.
All hands on deck.
Tie the sails!
Get the fins to the gally!
Captain there is a north wind hitting us fast!
You need to get up here.
I think this is for you captain.
The deposit.
You'll receive the rest when we dock.
You know the most important thing I learned out here?
We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.
They should be the ones to be afraid of us.
Salud.
What the hell is that?
They're called waves. They do that from time to time.
The storm is too strong. We are going to have to go around it.
Make it happen. I'm going to down below.
Captain!
Change of plans Captain. I'm going to take the money, your cargo, and what's left of the ship.
Aah!
I don't think so.
Crazy waves out there today.
Something unnatural about it.
There's nothing unnatural about everything.
Lots of scenery today.
I'm gonna focus on the waves.
You better hurry mate. The clouds are coming in.
Whoo! Reminds me of the nationals back in 04. Remember?
You totally ripped that bugger. I thought you were going to be rag dolled for sure.
You know we really don't talk like that, right?
You doing a ride-out or not?
Sure. Thanks.
It's totally cooking out here mate.
You're not kidding. It's a Mexican hurricane. Bad for them good for us.
Isn't that a drink?
Hit. Hit!
Whoo!
Good Morning California
this is Jonni Waves. That's Jonni with
with an "I". You may have noticed this
morning the unusul weather here in southern
California. The clouds coming n over the ocean
and the large waves are proving difficult
for surfers. I'm here in Santa Monica with
some breaking news about Hurricane David.
It's been pounding the west coast of Mexico.
Pushing it's way up to the coast to the
state of California. It seems o be
driving a very dangerous surf.
No kidding. Fin's out there.
Yeah but I won't worry about fin,
I mean he's the best surfer I've ever seen.
Except for me of course.
In my prime.
When was that George?
The civil war?
Eh, I'm not that old. You know I got some movies babe...
Hey! What did I tell you? You can touch everything at this bar except for me.
- Hey! Come on!
- Oopsies! Looks like you need another drink
Yeah I need one. One on the house.
One that doesn't coast me any money.
How come you never talk about that scar?
There's nothing to talk about.
I cut myself shaving.
4 bucks.
4 Bucks? I thought it was on the house. You spilled the last one.
Perhaps the silver
lining in this is that the storm
driven away the inflex of
sharks out of the area...
Yeah I hope it does. Hope it does. I hope the storm kills'em. I hope it kills them all.
Me too. You have no idea.
Tired already?
What's the last time you short boarded, old timer?
I never stopped. I just like this one rides.
Yeah. Whatever.
Alright grandpa. Ima show you how it's done.
Grandpa?
Show her how it's done, Grandpa!
Come on. Oh!
Deanna there's a shark!
Hey get outta the water!
SHARKS!
Hey Get out of the water!
Sharks! They're coming in!
Get off the beach!
Get out of the water!
Sharks! Get out of the water!
SHARKS!
Everyone out of the water now!
Everyone out of the water now! We're evacuating the beach. Everybody off the beach immediately.
Aaah!
Come here you bloody shark! Come here!
Aaah!
Baz!
Baz!
Aaah!
Just hang on. I'll let you in.
These sharks of your have no etiquette.
Etiquette?
I thought you were Australian not British.
Tasmanian buddy.
Just hang on, I'll get you in.
What were you thinking? You could have been killed.
I'm fine.
Aah!
We need a tourniquet.
Here use this.
It's just a - aah!
- Little nibble.
Aah!
Are you ok? Are you sure?
He must have wanted a snack.
Sharks don't like vegemite.
It's not funny.
Aah.
Hey. You gonna be ok?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Hey can I get some of those tasty nuts. Thank you.
And then. Are you listening? The shark opens it's mouth.
Goes to swallow fin whole but Fin
Looks at the shark - Do the look.
No, do the look.
Oh my god.
Yeah that one. And the shark goes, 'You know what?'
I'm pissing off. I'm not gonna mess with the surf champion.
Surf legend. Finley the Fin Shepard.
Ain't that right?
On you mate.
I don't believe it. You guys are nuts.
Look.
Do you see that?
- Oh yeah.
- It's a little nibble.
So he gives him a look and you give him a nibble -
No, HE gave me a nibble.
I don't know. Are you guys going back out there and do any swimming?
With the sharks?
It's a storm.
It's what's driven them all up north.
Eventually they'll go back from they came from.
I hope. But the were knocking.
Yeah knock knock knocking on your door.
And i have never seen so many and so bold.
It's just a storm. Just gotta stay out of the water for a couple days that's all.
Just a storm?
Looks like a hurricane.
I'm just happy you're ok.
Hey hey, what are you doing?
What? Do you think you're too old for me?
No, I'm your boss.
So?
So? Go get back to work.
Hey! I'm not too old for ya.
I don't think.
I'm not your boss.
Daddy issues. Hey! I'm not judging you darlin'.
Ouch!
I have daddy issues too.
- Here to issues.
- Yeah!
Who's is this?
Hurricane David is
poised to be the 1st hurricane to hit
the state of California. And it is now
barreling to the Santa Monica shorelines.
We have suffered tropical stors in the past but
we have never been hit by a storm quite like
this. Wide spread flooding is expected
and experts are saying global warming
is the reason for this
unprecedented event. We will
be back with more news as it develops.
Hello. Wexler residence.
April it's Fin.
Yeah Fin I know your voice. What do you want?
Look I'm just calling to make sure-
When did you go back to using
Wexler again?
cause that's my name.
Look Fin I'm really busy.
Just calling to make sure you and Claudia are ok.
There's a bad hurricane rolling in and I want-
Is this about money?
Because if this is about money
Fin, I told you already that-
It's the storm. I just want to make sure guys are ok.
Of course we're ok. It's barely even raining.
Look, it's really sweet that you are calling in to check in on us but Collin already checked the drains and, we're gonna be fine.
They're cleared out.
Well it's flooding here and not the plumbing. The ocean.
I think you guys should get out of town.
What are you talking about? We are 100 miles from the ocean.
You are exactly 6.6 miles from the ocean.
And on a day like today it's not far enough.
I'm gonna take you and Claudia further inland.
And what about Collin?
You know you are not the only one that can keep us safe.
We're not going anywhere.
Fine. Then let me just get Claudia.
We'll it my week for the month.
Is that what this is about?
No!
Look you are gonna see her on the 20th like you always do. I gotta go ok. Bye Fin.
Who's that?
My wife.
That is his wife.
- Yeah his wife.
- Shut up Baz.
Already everybody, listen up.
I'm closing the restaurant.
Storm is coming and it's coming fast. Get home safe everybody.
Don't forget taco Tuesdays.
George, you got to get out of here.
What's going on?
If I don't secure the bar, I'm going to loose everything.
Come on George, George wake up.
Oh! I hear an angel, I must be in heaven.
George you better wake up or I'm calling in your bar tab.
Oh, i'm up I'm up.
Hey hey, you need to go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
This is not your problem.
No! It is my problem. Because if this bar get blown over then I'm out of a job too.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna have any place to drink.
Can't argue with that one.
For an environmentalist you sure do hate sharks.
I've got fire power behind the bar. Come on come on!
Alright, grab a weapon. Grab anything you can find to defend yourself.
Give me something dangerous.,
Can I get one for the road Fin?
Huh? What?
Come on let's go let's go let's go!
George get your ass up!
Now!
Alright.
Come on kid.
Don't you ever make fun of my stool again.
Come on come on.
That's what you get for trying to eat me.
Come on come on guys let's go.
We are here live at the Santa Monica Pier,
this is what remains after
the massive storm tore through the popular attraction.
The waves also brought in sharks
which have injured dozens and
killed several people.
We'll rebuild mate.
Insurance will cover it.
L.A. wasn't built for all this water.
I'm really worried about Claudia and April.
I really gotta go check on them.
I'm coming with you.
April doesn't like you, remember?
Nah mate. She doesn't like you, remember?
She loves me. Where do you think Claudia came from?
Who's Claudia?
His daughter.
You have an ex-wife and a daughter?
I can drop you at home if you want?
I live on the beach it's obviously flooded.
No where else to go.
Looks like we're all refugees now.
I wanna go with you.
Make sure your family is ok.
Anybody seen George?
George?
Here he is.
Oh man. I'm glad you woke me up.
I was having the worst nightmare.
Gosh the water is raising.
Water is not going to be a problem.
All the electronics have been sealed with silicone. We'll be fine.
I've driven this thing from here to the beaches of Costa Rica.
Why is the car shaking.
What the hell. There are sharks on the streets.
These fish surely have a hankering for me.
It's like one taste of Baz is just isn't enough.
Hey whoa whoa whoa.
Hold up with the guns. We don't need more blood in the water.
That's a tiger shark.
How do you know that?
Shark Week.
Were'd it go?
Where did it go?
Ah geez.
Hey
It's under the car.
Well can I start shooting now?
Yea. Do it.
We got to get to higher ground.
Take the freeway. It's above street level.
You take the 10 to the 405. You're almost in
Bevelry Hills. And there is no way the ocean has washed inland that far.
What makes you an expert on
Beverly Hills George?
That's where I live.
George if you live in Beverly Hills why do you come all the way to the coast to come and drink at my bar?
I don't know. I like the view, you know.
There's the beach. There's all these scantily glad women there that pretend to like me if
I buy them a drink. And there is my seat.
My chair. My chair is always there.
Plus you don't charge 15 dollars a plock.
Yeah.
Plus there is the beautiful Nova there who I am planning to marry soon.
I sit around and think about it every night and day. Everywhere I go.
Hey!
Bloody hell.
That's the 405.
I hate the 405.
Bloody hell. What are these idiots doing?
Yeah I'll just go around them.
You need to back up. I need to get out of here!
Get back in your car. It's not safe out here.
It's just a little water.
Typical Californians are afraid of the rain.
Yeah.
Stop!
Watch it will ya.
Maybe they're not such idiots after all.
Oh my god.
It's like old faithful.
We're gonna need faith to get through that.
The water is raising behind us.
What what what?
Oh my god!
I just can't sit back and watch this.
- What?
- The sharks are swimming right at them.
They're not gonna make it.
Don't even think about it.
They're not gonna make it.
Fin! Where you going?
The sharks are falling from the freakin sky.
Here we go again.
Nova!
There's sharks out there. You don't have to go out there.
There's absolutely no reason to go out there.
Everyone needs to get to higher ground!
Puppy!
Somebody help me! Help me get my dog out!
Please help me! My dog is locked inside.
This area is flooding.
Come on, get out!
Please!
Please help!
Somebody help!
Ok. You go!
Ok. I got you princess come on.
There you go.
Come on George.
George! Come on George!
Oh Crap!
Ouch! Get off of me!
It's not gonna end.
The flood channels, the storm drains, the sewers.
It's not gonna stop at the coast.
They're going to swim everywhere.
Come on get in the car.
We've got to go through this.
What?
You've got kangaroos loose in the brain mate. We can't go through that.
The aerodynamics in this car cannot match the waves.
The waves are only gonna get bigger as the storm get closer.
Trust me, if there is one thing
I know, it's timing waves.
That's what I was afraid of.
They come in sets of 3.
One.
Two.
Three.
Whoo.
Are you ok?
I'm alright. 10 fingers. 10
Toes.
Uh, gotta love LA.
What are these people thinking?
Nothing.
Does April know you coming?
No.
But at least we'll be in the hills away from the flooding.
Alright.
It's awfully nice of you to let her new boyfriend stay in your house.
Don't remind me.
Unbelievable.
We're almost at the house.
That's too bad. I was hoping it was further up the hill.
April!
April!
Hey let us in.
Whoa! What are you doing here?
And what happened to him?
Nothing. Your Fin save my life.
He's not my Fin anymore.
And who is she?
It's Nova. She works at the bar.
Now will you let us in.
No! I told you not to come.
No! Just go away. Take your stupid friend and Baz and leave.
Nice Shot.
By the way I'm not a stripper.
Claudia!
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Claudia!
Dad? What are you doing here?
There's a big storm coming in.
It's not safe here.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Just leave.
I didn't come here to argue with you.
I came here to get you.
I don't care.
What is all the ruckus?
Awe Sheppard.
Should have figured it was you.
What are you doing here?
L.A. is drowning.
I'm going inland. I'm taking my family with me.
Finley. April is mine.
Excuse me?
My girlfriend is not your responsibility.
And unless it's the 20th of the month, which currently it's not. Neither is Claudia.
Collin, don't be rude. He's just worried about us.
Every time it rains in L.A. everyone swears it's the storm of the century.
And even if it is, Beverly Hills emergency services a second to none.
We're safe here.
There are sharks flooding the streets.
And there is now one swimming in your pool.
Are you kidding?
Shark in the swimming pool is impossible.
Collin!
Something is on my foot! I can't move!
Finley Help me! Finley!
Watch out!
Collin!
Help me! It's getting away!
Collin!
I've got your back.
Get it's nose.
Die already!
It's coming back!
- No!
- Oh my gosh!
Fin!
Ready?
Fin!
Where'd it go?
Where's it go?
- Go go go!
- Oh my gosh!
Fin hurry up, Get over here.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
Looks like it's that time of the month.
Look!
We're out of Ammo.
The eye of the storm still hasn't come to shore yet.
It's gonna get worse before it gets any better.
We got to get inland and we got to get some place safe for all of us.
Where?
I'm thinking the desert.
No, we have to go to Van Nuys to get Matt.
Matt's in flight school there.
Matt's at flight school? I thought he was vacationing at Tampa with his buddies.
When did this happen? I just talked to him.
How come no body tells me these things.
I'm suppose to be included in these conversations.
He wanted to tell you but, Collin said it was none of your business anymore.
Who's Matt?
My brother.
You have a son too?
Alright.
We got to get out of here quick.
How are we going to do that?
I'm going to push the shark out of here.
I'm gonna distract it.
When I do this, get to the car as fast as you can.
Now!
He'll be ok.
Fin!
Fin!
Come on, get in!
Move it! Move your ass!
Go Go Go!
Easy come, easy go.
The eye of hurricane David is
continuing it's relentless
pounding through the streets of Los Angeles.
And more surprisingly and most shocking
reports have been pouring in from all over,
that sharks are washing ashore.
Live sharks. And not just from the coastal
flooding but they are coming up through the drais
Do you always have this much ammo in your jeep?
Sepra Peratus.
Dad, are you really saying that right now. Can you be serious?
It means?
Always be prepared.
Thank you.
I always thought it would be an earthquake that would be the end of Los Angeles.
Or a meteor shower. Zombies even.
Yeah.
Black Plague. Aliens.
But sharks? Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah. Go figure. My luck, sharks.
Yeah your luck. Sharks.
Mine too.
I'm not gonna lie. It's kinda hot when you do that.
Again we will keep
yo updated n this storm.
This is Jonni Waves. That's
Jonni with an "I"-
Call Matt.
This is the emergency alert system.
National weather servie has issued a tornado warning
through Los Angeles County. Water spouts have
been detected in the coastal water from Orane
No kidding. You are a bit late on that one.
We got to get out of here fast.
We got to go get Matt.
The freeways will be a nightmare.
But there's a short cut if you turn right up here.
That's how I always get around the Hollywood traffic with my friends.
What are you doing in Hollywood?
Since when do you care?
Hold on.
The storm is dying down.
How can you tell?
Not as many sharks flying around.
Why you stopping. We have to go get Matt.
Don't you see that? There could be kids in there.
There's no one in there. And your kid is right here.
We got to get her somewhere safe.
This is so typical of you Fin.
You care more about other people then you do your own family.
Let's go!
Please.
I can't.
The water is raising. I'm going to go up on the bridge and rappel down.
Fin this is crazy.
Calm down guys. Calm down ok.
There's other grown ups coming ok?
Uh uh, Police Department, Fire Department.
They're going to get us out of this.
As long as we stay in here we are going to be fine, ok?
Trust me. We're gonna be just fine.
Anybody in there?
Whoa! Whoa! Be careful.
Need a lift?
I'm glad to see you.
Send the rope.
I reached dispatch right before all the electronics went out. They said someone from 911 is sending someone over.
Oh yeah? Want to wait for them?
Hell no!
I didn't think so. Who's first?
Ok, come over here honey.
Ok.
Alright Samantha you're going to be alright.
Start pulling, they are ready.
Alright you ready? Just keep looking up.
It's gonna be fine Samantha.
Here we go.
Ok, Lift her up!
Alright here we go Samantha you're going to be alright.
Go ahead.
It's gonna be just like flying.
Come on come on. Quicker, let's go.
Yes!
Yes! Alright pull'em up!
You're doing already. You're doing good. Don't be afraid.
Come on. Hold on tight.
He's up.
Alright.
Alright, who's next?
A bunch of little kids went up before me.
How hard can it be right?
Let's go.
Alright.
Go over there. Come on sweetheart.
Your dad is trying to do good here.
Give him a hand.
Are you sure this thing is strong enough to hold me?
Nope I'm not.
Great.
I'm sure not looking forward going in there after you.
Yeah.
I hate sharks. I'm from Wyoming.
You know-
I moved down here to be an actor.
Dad.
I got to go up right now!
Please!
Up up up!
Come on!
Oh god! 15 grand a year. No benefits.
Screaming kids.
Call down. It's ok. Don't Panic.
I use to hate heights. Now I'm away from sharks.
Ok let's do this now before I become hot lunch.
Watch out fin!
Watch out to the right. Watch out!
Oh my gosh be careful.
Watch your foot.
Hurry, keep going faster.
Oh my gosh!
Be careful!
Be careful Fin!
Watch out!
Fin come on! Watch out Fin!
I had just about enough of you.
Be careful Fin!
Come on.
Your ok. Oh my gosh.
Finny, look at the sky.
The storm is clearing up. Maybe it's done.
Good.
These guys are gonna get you home, ok?
Be safe.
Oh Crap.
What?
Claudia get in the Jeep!
I'm fine mom.
Get down! Get down!
You alright?
You ok?
My mom always told me Hollywood would kill me.
Start the engine.
Is that good?
Ok rev it. Rev it.
Guys it's flooding.
It's gonna be easier if we steal another car.
Then steal another car.
There's a small gas leak but it should run for now.
What is that?
It's a water spout.
Tornado over the ocean. Water gets sucked up in the air...
Are those sharks?
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
Close her up. Let's go.
Well, at least the rain is easing up a bit.
What was that?
Oh my god. Oh my god.
What the hell?
Kill it!
This is crazy!
Hit the breaks!
Get down Claudia!
Bloody hell!
Why did we stop?
It must be flooded.
Well fix it!
Mate I smell gas.
I do too. Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!
Go go go!
The gun!
Can I use you phone please?
It's been dead for hours.
Thanks.
No problem.
So what kinda name is Nova anyway?
That's the kinda name you give yourself when you don't like the person you use to be.
Hey, uh. Look, I see the way you took at my dad.
He's just gonna break your heart just like he did to my mom and I.
It looks like the eye of the storm is over.
Or maybe not.
Hey make it quick. I don't want to spend too much time here.
With these storms ravaging
the streets of Los Angeles, some religious
Apocalypse my ass.
This isn't the end of the world. Gods not angry with us.
The Aliens are not coming down.
It's the government.
Ye-ah.
With the big capital G. They're behind everything.
They know what we buy. They know what we eat. Where we go to the bathroom.
Hurry. Hurry.
They know what kinda cheese I like.
Pepper Jack.
And the weather too.
I gotta hand it to the, Sharks.
I never saw that coming.
Y-eah.
Weather satellites
they're currently tracking 3 off shore
water spouts over the pacific ocean.
Experts are categorizing this as an EF4.
With a potential to becoming ad EF5 tornado
by the time it touches down on land.
I n the San Fernando Valley all
roads are blocked and movement-
Protein.
I know how we're going to get out of here.
You know we need a car first.
I've got it covered.
Oh nice!
You're gonna need stiches and antibiotics.
And you're gonna have a hell of a scar.
That's ok. Chicks dig scars, right?
Why you driving so fast?
We got to get there fast before they clear the accident.
What accident?
Something I saw on the news
Look out!
Whoa!
This is nuts.
Now we're never gonna get to Van Nuys.
- Baz, Drive around it.
- I can't. It's blocked in every direction.
We got to get Matt before the storm picks up again.
I'm going for it.
- Are you crazy! Don't do it
- Go! Go! Go!
Whoo!
Pull your car over.
Dad! The police are chasing us.
- Hey Baz.
- Yeah.
Stop your vehicle now!
Drive faster.
No worries mate.
Fast enough for ya?
Yeah.
Pull to the side of the road.
Stop your vehicle now.
Hey Baz, is that nitrous button?
- It certainly is mate.
- What do yo say we hit that?
- Give it a go.
- Hold on folks.
Hold on to your panties ladies.
Oh man!
Whoo! Now this is fun.
I think we lost them.
Now we're talking.
Ok.
It should be smooth sailing from here.
Why is there a retirement home next to an airport?
Because old people can't hear.
It doesn't look like they've left.
Their cars are still here.
I'm gonna go look upstairs.
Ok. I'll check these rooms.
Matt?
Matt?
Has anybody seen anything?
Matt?
Matt?
It's time to leave Kansas mate.
There's no one up here.
Where is everyone?
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa!
No no no. I'm looking for Matt.
Is there a Matt here?
Matt?
Uh, yeah yeah. I'm Matt. Who are you?
Guys I found Matt com on.
Come here. He's in here.
Matt!
Dad? Mom?
What are you guys doing here?
We had to come inland to avoid the storm.
- We came in to get you.
- There's sharks everywhere.
Sharks?
Is this the best shelter you got?
Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar.
We better find something to protect ourselves and quick.
From what?
They couldn't possibly make it all the way out here.
They can.
It's entirely possible. A hurricane can pick up marine life out of the ocean and drop it hundreds of miles away.
Hold this.
Yeah, he's right. It happened once near Alice Springs.
100s of perch fell from the sky.
Why not Sharks?
Look, what the hell is going on here?
It's a Sharknado!
Let's get inside here. Get in get in.
The news said that there is 3 tornadoes in the area. We're not safe here.
What's the fastest way to get out of here?
Can that fly?
I don't know. Let me check.
Looks pretty beat up.
Hey you know what? She'll fly.
We're not all gonna fit in here.
We can't fly in these storms.
Then what are we gonna do?
We're gonna stand and fight?
We just wait and wait here for sharks to rain down to us again.
We need to arm ourselves with something more powerful then these.
What were you thinking?
That store, It's got everything we need.
Sepra peratus.
They must have evacuated.
How are we getting in?
Guys stand back. I have the key.
Dad, I'll be right back.
I have an idea. Come with me.
Oh nice! This is what I'm talking about.
Hey, do you think you can make this work?
Yeah. I'll make it work.
Good.
Bombs.
Bombs?
Instead of letting live sharks rain down on people, we are going to get in that chopper and throw bombs into the tornadoes.
Blasting those bastards to bits.
I like it, but how is that gonna stop a tornado?
Tornadoes happen when cold and warm air meet.
Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the middle of it, You might just equalize it.
But if you miss, we're screwed.
Oh, hell no. You got a death wish? No way!
Dad, I'm the only one that could do it.
Bobby and Noellen haven't even solo yet.
What's wrong?
Your son wants to go into a helicopter and drop a bomb into the tornado.
No! It's too dangerous.
I'll watch his back. I'll be his bombardier.
Then definitely not.
Dad, we have a chance to save thousands of lives. Maybe more.
You always taught me to help others. I'm going.
He's right April. We'll work it out together.
I won't let anything happen to him.
Don't you understand you can die Matt?
Mom, we don't have any other option.
And you are not gonna stop me.
He certainly is your son.
Shopping cart?
Yeah.
Claud?
Claud?
Hey! Come on. What are you doing down here? What's the problem?
You.
Your my problem.
Are we really gonna do that now?
Now?
Look, what are you and mom doing?
You guys can barely stand to be in a room together for 5 minutes, and now
What? Cause you are saving Matt you're best friends again?
He is my son.
I'm your daughter.
You guys are always there for him and you're never there for me.
Hey get that one. No no the other one.
You don't think I try?
Not hard enough.
I came for you first.
Try to remember that.
Come on. Come on.
Hey.
I fell off a slide when I was 2.
It hurt like hell.
Now people think it's cool.
No body thinks this is cool.
What happened?
I had a tattoo removed.
I don't like to talk about it.
I was raised by my grandparents.
We I was 7 my grandpa took me fishing with one of those day charter deals with his friends.
We end up hitting into a reef and the boat went down.
My grandfather took me and put me inside this little life- raft for safety.
Everyone else was kinda swimming around trying to stay up and suddenly all these sharks just started swarming and- and then they... tried to protect me but...
By morning they were all gone.
So I floated out there for 2 days until one of those coast guard helicopters finally spotted me.
I thought I was safe but suddenly this shark leaped up and bit my leg.
6 people went into the water and one little girl came out.
The sharks took the rest.
They took my grandfather.
So I really hate sharks.
Now I really hate sharks too.
Nice work kids.
But this, this is a bomb.
Dad, the tornado is coming.
Hey!
Hey what are you doing?
In case things don't work out,
We're going to move to plan B.
Baz builds a bigger bomb, and drives this in into the storm.
That's not gonna work. It's a one way trip.
Especially with that leg.
You want to see me try?
No!
Fin, look after your family.
They are a good bunch.
It's fine.
Alright, do what you gotta do.
Don't I always?
I will.
Watch our backs.
Be careful.
Alright get ready.
Do we have enough bombs?
Sure hope so.
First time on a chopper?
Yeah.
Scared?
Hell No!
Oh Crap.
Look at all those sharks!
Look out! More Sharks!
What are we gonna do?
You got it dad.
Oh my god, there's just too many of them!
We're gonna need a bigger chopper.
- I hope this bomb idea of yours works.
- Trust me. It will.
- We're getting close. Get Ready.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Bombs. Bombs.
- Bombs. Bombs Bombs Bombs.
Careful with those Robert.
Alright, here's how you do it.
Open the valve.
First tornado coming to the left here.
Push the button. Hold it for 3 seconds. We're gonna count.
Ok.
Strike!
Whoo! Hahaha.
- Whoo! I did it!
- Told ya!
That worked!
Fin!
How's the front end looking Bobby?
I'm not a captain yet sir.
Bobby look out!
Get down!
The tornado is coming this way.
Baz!
Second tornado! Second tornado!
The tornado is headed towards the airport.
We need to destroy it before it get to them.
Why!
Baz! Baz!
Dad! You have to leave him!
It's getting closer. We have to go now of we're dead.
OK, Tell me when.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go up there!
Ok people, everybody out of the pool.
Everybody needs to get out of the pool and inside.
Yes Carl that means you. Out now please.
This is Jonni Waves
that's Joni with an "I" reporting live
as just one of these massive tornados
is about to tear through Hollywood
and it's headed on course through the
Valley and onto Van Nuys. It's about to tear
through the city of Los Aahh!
Getting close to the second tornado.
Already got another one.
Press the button down for 3 seconds.
We're gonna count together. - Ok ok ok.
Alright. 1.2.3.
Light it!
Falling sharks!
Come on let's get them inside.
Oh my god. Run! Run!
- Run! Honey!
- I can't run, I can't even walk!
Alright. Third tornado.
Look at the size of that thing.
Just stay focused.
- It's showtime!
- I'm on it!
Go it!
Alright. Strike it!
Who is that up there?
That's my son.
You must be so proud.
Yeah. Yeah I am.
Its not working.
The bomb didn't land right.
- Hey!
- We're out of bombs. What do we do?
I'll head back to base.
Turbulence is picking up.
Oh my god!
The Shark! The Shark!
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Get off me get off me!
Die already! Why won't you die!
Ooh! Oh my god!
No!
Help!
Matt!
Get everybody to safely.
Come on everybody! Let's get away from the window.
Matt! Matt!
Matt! Matt!
Come on! Come on! Get out of here.
Come here. Come on.
Are you alright?
Yeah. Yeah where is mom and
Claudia?
They're on the hill.
Where's Nova?
She - Didn't make it.
Go look after your mother and sister.
Where you going?
I'm going to finish this.
Move! Get out of the way!
Daddy!
Get out of there!
Get outta the way!
Claudia Move!
Fin!
Dad!
Dad!
Oh my god.
Dad?
Dad!
Nova!
Come on.
- Dad are you ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Oh my god.
Breathe. Breathe!
Come on!
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
I really hate sharks.
- Thank you! Thank you.
- You're Welcome.
I never got your real name.
Jenny Lynn.
Nice to meet you... Jenny Lynn.
Hell of a day.
Prepare Nautilus for orbit capture.
Computer:
Orbit capture trajectory confirmed.
Engage main thrusters.
Disengaging artificial gravity for Mercury approach.
Someone forget to secure their tablet?
Oh.
Remind me to fire the maid.
Computer:
Approaching coordinates.
- Awaiting manual override.
- All right, Natalie.
Manual flight controls engaged.
We're going in.
Computer:
Warning, solar event detected.
- (electronics beeping)
- What's happening?
We have an electromagnetic radiation spike, a big one.
- Are we within safe levels?
- So far.
- Lee, stay on course.
- Entering orbit in 20 seconds.
- (beeping)
- Computer: Warning...
- radiation shields activated.
- What the hell was that?
Radiation levels are spiking off the charts.
Abort orbit capture.
- Lee, get us out of here.
- Roger that.
Engaging artificial gravity.
- (beeping)
- Computer: Alarm,
- system failure.
- Everything is spiking.
- Heat, magnetics...
- Magnetics, that can't be.
- Are you sure?
- That's what I'm reading.
- Increase thrusters to maximum.
- Come on, darlin'.
Hang in there.
Computer: Warning, radiation levels at maximum.
My God.
- (alarms beeping)
- Computer: Alarm, system failure.
Damage report!
System failures across the board.
I can't hold anything online.
- (beeping)
- Computer: Alarm, system failure.
- Losing power to engines.
- Victoria, check out backup systems.
I'm on it.
There's a fire in the comm.
Computer: Warning, engine power critical.
Come on.
No!
Chaos.
Destruction.
Unpredictability.
Our universe... is a dangerous place.
In our solar system, there are over a thousand asteroids and comets that are classified as threatening to hit the earth.
But you should also know that those are just the ones we know about.
Just last year, an asteroid
200 feet in diameter passed within
40,000 miles of us.
Now in planetary terms, that is like, uh... it's like someone shooting at you and having a bullet part your hair without touching your skin.
Now, if it had hit us, it would have exploded with the force of a hydrogen bomb.
Do you know how much advance warning we had?
Three days.
The good news is, we have the technology to deflect these objects.
It's called Project 7.
The most advanced, most powerful, most ambitious planetary defense system ever conceived.
It's equipped with an energy field that allows it to deflect objects many times its size.
The bad news?
- There's always bad news.
- (students laugh)
Our government pulled funding from Project 7 just before it came online.
So right now it floats dormant in space.
The earth's been struck before, it'll be struck again.
The only question is whether we're gonna be ready.
Do your part in protecting the planet.
Write to your congressman, tell your friends.
Spread the word.
Our lives may depend on it.
We need Project 7.
You.
You need Project 7.
- Thank you very much.
- (applause)
Dr. Preston, Brad Walker.
Your liaison officer with Mission Ops.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
- Yeah.
- As you know, it is our policy to, uh, notify family members immediately of any situation involving the mission that may arise.
- I know the protocol.
- Now, I've been sent here to make sure you don't hear anything through the media that may make you worry unnecessarily.
Now, having said that, um, early this morning, we did lose contact with the Nautilus.
Dr. Preston.
Dr. Preston, wait.
Dr. Preston.
- (line ringing)
- Dr. Preston: Come on, pick up.
- (phone chimes)
- Recording: We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again...
- Damn it!
...or call your oper...
Okay.
All right.
- Hello?
- Hey, it's James.
I can't talk to you.
I'm at work.
- If Edward finds out...
- I'm worried about Victoria.
Today was orbit capture.
They lost contact with the Nautilus.
I can't reach Mission Ops.
Do you know anything?
I don't, but Houston doesn't call the military every time they have a glitch.
You know that.
It's probably nothing.
I'm sure Victoria's fine.
I know you have eyes in the sky.
Just check it out for me, okay?
Call me back if you find anything.
You know I can't talk to you about this stuff.
Edward doesn't even like that we're friends.
- What the hell?
- What?
Jennifer, did SPEAR just activate Project 7?
What are you talking about?
It's dead.
It's been dead for three years.
Oh, uh, it's sending me data.
Jennifer:
It's sending data to you?
If Edward finds out that you've been monitoring it, he'll throw you in jail so fast that you won't know...
Okay, uh, something weird is happening.
Project 7 is picking up a strange...
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Oh, that's impossible.
- Status report.
- The EM wave knocked out virtually every civilian satellite and most government ones as well.
We're the only major agency fully functioning right now.
- But that's not our only problem.
- Three sets of images, all pulled from the deep-sky orbital telescope before it went down completely.
These were all taken only five minutes apart.
What's that spot?
That spot, sir,
- is Mercury.
- That can't be right.
- That would mean that...
- Mercury's on the move.
- How's that possible?
- We don't have all the data yet.
We still don't know.
Figure out where it's headed.
I want to know if that thing is coming anywhere near us.
Jennifer:
We're already on it.
Marshall?
Oh, thank God.
Breathe.
Check Lee.
Go, I'll take care of Lee.
- (electricity buzzing)
- (coughs)
Mercury will miss the Earth by a distance of 500,000 miles.
Roughly twice as far away as the moon.
- That's not good.
- Exactly.
Even at that distance, its gravitational field will wreak havoc.
Extreme tides, electrical disturbances at a minimum.
Well, our primary concern at this point has gotta be the political fallout.
Put our defense systems on high alert.
I've also had Michelle working to get in touch with the Nautilus, but we haven't had any success.
Nautilus is the least of our concerns at this point.
But they were right there.
If the Nautilus did manage to pull through, they may be able to fill in the blanks.
Fine, but you keep
James Preston out of it.
Yes, sir.
Man over radio: We are continuing to receive some frantic reports of massive power failures around the world.
Global communications continue to be affected, as most satellites seem to be off-line.
All air transportation is being grounded until further notice.
We'll continue to bring you details as they develop.
Oh man.
I've normalized our oxygen levels, but most of our systems are damaged.
Communication is down, as is navigation.
Right.
What the hell hit us?
It seemed like a solar flare, but it was massive.
All of the energy readings are wrong.
Well, we'll have to worry about that later.
Right now we've got bigger problems.
I've managed to stabilize us.
Do what you can with communication.
I'll work on navigation.
Okay.
We need to figure out where the hell we are.
- (beeps)
- (clears throat)
- Hey.
- Hey.
Check it out.
A little Sumatra blend.
You want some?
I need you to take a look at this, okay?
It's about Victoria.
Something happened up there and I need to know how it's gonna affect the Nautilus.
Well, it was a massive solar flare that hit us this morning.
Biggest one on record, but the Nautilus should be prepared
- for that kind of event.
- It's not a solar flare.
Okay, look.
Its magnetic signature, it's off the charts.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just a headache.
Any luck on the comm?
Well, we'll only be able to transmit and receive on a very narrow band.
But they'll be able to hear us?
If they're listening.
Woman on radio:
Power blackouts.
Communication failures.
Airplanes grounded.
The government wants you to think it's a solar flare, but we are here to give you the truth.
Brooke Adamson's
"Conspiracy Report" is back on the air.
Nice.
- (static hissing)
- What's wrong?
- (grumbles)
- (electricity buzzing)
No, it's just, uh, getting some interference.
- It's not us.
- It's the Feds.
- It's not the Feds.
- It's the Feds.
Victoria over radio: This is
Victoria Preston of the USS Nautilus making an emergency distress call.
Can anybody read?
No way.
- What?
- (static hissing)
This is Victoria Preston on the USS Nautilus. Come in.
Isn't the Nautilus the spacecraft that's on the Mercury mission?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it's gotta be a joke.
Well, we'll find out.
First we'll lock on her signal.
Here.
Um... copy that, Nautilus.
You're breaking up.
- Do you read?
- Copy that.
This is Victoria Preston on the Nautilus. We are in distress.
Before we proceed, please encrypt this transmission using security protocol 27-46-32.
- What are you doing?
- If it's a hoax, they'll play along.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because that's what I would do.
Victoria: There's no such protocol.
Who exactly am I speaking with?
Give me that.
This is Christopher Weaver and Brooke Adamson.
We're seniors at North Bay University.
You've managed to connect with our pirate radio station.
Victoria, do you copy that?
Come in.
- What happened?
- We gotta get that signal back.
Let's go to the car.
We'll try new batteries.
Before my telescope went off-line,
I was able to pull these images.
Look at these sun-spots.
They're starting to disappear here, and here, here, and here.
- What does that mean?
- Magnetism.
It all makes sense now.
For one brief millisecond, our humble little sun became a magnetar, the most powerful source of magnetic energy in the universe.
A magnetar?
Yeah, it's extremely rare, but it's the only thing that could explain it.
The sun-spots, the blackouts, the magnetic wave, everything.
- (loud thud)
- What was that?
Whoa.
This should not be happening.
There's no way our database could have missed this many meteors approaching Earth.
Buddy, either you're wrong
- or that's not a meteor.
- (loud boom)
That impact site can't be more than a mile or two, tops.
Let's take my car. I don't want to have to ride on your handlebars.
Very funny.
- Get in the car.
- I enjoy riding my bike to work.
- It's something that I like to do.
- Get in the car.
Uh, this is not good.
Do you know where we are yet?
No.
But we're accelerating without engine power.
Well, you check autopilot and see if there's been any false commands and I'll see what I can do.
Yes, ma'am.
Wow.
Something's definitely wrong.
- There's still no signal.
- I don't know.
Do you think that was really the Nautilus?
Yeah, I do.
I do.
- (gasps)
- Whoa!
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but there's more coming.
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
- (explosions continue)
- James?
Run. Run!
Get down!
Oh, boy.
Is it over?
I think so.
What the hell happened?
Matthew: Whoa.
Computer:
Navigation systems initializing.
- (beeps)
- Flight path compromised.
Marshall, I've checked everything.
I can't find anything wrong.
Get up here.
I need your help with navigation.
We need to figure out where we're headed now.
- And we are back up.
- Computer: Plotting Nautilus location.
- Marshall: Wait, this can't be right.
- What is it?
We're not where we should be.
Neither is Mercury.
How is that possible?
Marshall:
I don't know. It's out of orbit.
No. We're accelerating towards the planet.
Mercury is dragging us in?
But we're not close enough to be in its gravity.
Whatever it is,
I don't want to be any closer.
Computer:
Reverse thrusters engaged.
Victoria, we need to get a hold of Mission Ops.
Right.
Okay.
Maybe.
- (static hissing)
- Ground, do you copy?
Can you hear me?
Ground, this is Victoria.
Do you copy?
Thrusters are at 70%.
I don't like this.
- (static hissing)
- Ground, this is Victoria. Do you copy?
- Yeah, Victoria. We're here.
- Oh, thank God.
I need you to get in touch with Mission Control. It's urgent.
Well, if you're trying to warn us about meteors,
- you're a little late for that.
- Christopher, the Nautilus has been knocked off course.
I need Mission Ops to guide us.
Marshall: Come on.
Mission Ops is in Houston.
We're in Oregon and the phones are down.
Oregon, okay.
I need you to get to a facility south of Seattle called SPEAR.
SPEAR. I know that.
My cousin lives nearby.
Okay, great. When you get there, ask for a person named Jennifer Kelly.
Tell her what I've told you, that we need Mission Ops to guide Nautilus, and give her this frequency to get in touch.
And, please, our lives depend on it.
We're on it.
Let's go.
It has an extremely high iron content.
Way too high for an ordinary piece of meteorite.
This might sound crazy, but I think this is a piece of Mercury.
It's a magnetized piece of Mercury.
If it was hit by the magnetar wave, that would explain why it's magnetic.
Even so, how are pieces of it down here?
I don't know.
- (beeping)
- Thrusters are at maximum.
- We're still being pulled in.
- I can do a manual override in the engine room to boost the thrusters, but it's a temporary fix at best.
- Do it!
- Got it!
This is weird.
You want to read me those coordinates again?
Yeah. Uh...
- right ascension...
- Mm-hmm.
...13 hours...
- Mm-hmm.
...17 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.
- Declination...
- Yeah.
...negative-7 degrees...
- Yeah.
...2 arcminutes.
It's not there.
What are you talking about?
- It's not there.
- Where is it?
I don't know.
It's just... it's gone.
- Do you mind?
- It's just gone.
Okay.
They were right there.
Mercury was right... they were right there.
All right, that... that's impossible.
A planet doesn't just move.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get some answers.
Marshall, I got you another 20%, but that's the best I could do.
Let's hope it's enough.
There's not enough power in the reverse thrusters.
I need to flip us around and engage the main engine.
That's too risky.
We can't use the reverse thrusters and turn the ship at the same time.
We'd be pulled in immediately.
- Not if we do it fast enough.
- We?
It's a two-man job, Victoria.
But I'm not a pilot.
Welcome to your promotion.
Victoria, reduce power by 20% when I boost the main engines.
Copy that.
Now!
Reducing power.
We're being pulled in sideways.
Marshall?
Marshall?!
Maneuver successfully executed.
Okay, I need you to take over for a while.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
I think I might have got hit hard...
Marshall!
Yes?
We need to see
Jennifer Kelly right away.
- And you are?
- We have an urgent message from Victoria Preston and the Nautilus spacecraft.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
- So if you could just please...
- Excuse me, sir, the Nautilus is having severe mechanical malfunctions and they can't get a hold of Mission Ops, but they can get a hold of my radio.
- We were sent here to see Jennifer...
- This is a secure facility.
No one gets in without an appointment or a pass.
- Yeah, I understand that, but...
- That was me telling you nicely.
Don't make me tell you again.
Let's go.
- Great.
- Guard: Let's go.
James, I know what must be going through your head right now.
Then you'll stop the small talk.
It's just we don't know anything for sure yet.
There's a very good chance that she's alive.
Mercury didn't disappear.
It was knocked out of orbit.
- I tracked its gravity...
- And my wife... probably should be walking on Mercury right now.
Now pieces of it are landing on the Earth.
You understand?
They didn't believe us.
- The guard wouldn't even call Jennifer.
- Fascist.
What should we do now?
Find my husband,
Dr. James Preston.
He'll be at our home in Pacific Grove.
433 Ocean Beach Drive.
Come on, James.
Look, I don't care if your facility's on lockdown, okay?
Try her number again
'cause I need to talk to her.
- Sir, you need to calm down.
- Oh, I need to calm down?
I used to work here, okay?
I can't call her because my phone doesn't work.
It's urgent.
Stand down.
James, you need to leave.
You know you can't be here.
I can't share classified information with you.
What about Mercury?
Is that classified?
- Look, we know all about Mercury.
- Do you?
Do you also know it's magnetized?
He's with me.
You, stay there.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Show him.
Nice trick.
So what?
This thing, this was attached to Mercury.
You have to recalculate the planet's trajectory based on magnetism.
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Massive magnetar wave hit Mercury.
It is now extremely magnetized.
If it's anywhere near Earth, it'll lock on to our magnetic field... it'll come straight for us.
Well, we've tracked its trajectory, and while it is headed our way, we're comfortably certain that it will miss us.
You're not factoring in the magnetism.
You have to recalculate.
Based on our new data, the calculations show the trajectory has changed.
Oh, my God.
Mercury's on a collision course with Earth.
Look at the distance it's covered.
- It's moving faster.
- It's locked on to us.
Earth's magnetic field is drawing it in.
It's like two magnets pulling it together.
This is beyond an extinction level event.
- This is the end of the world.
- How long have we got?
Just over 18 hours.
Okay, people, this is why we have a contingency plan.
Initiate Operation Recourse.
I wanna be online in 30 minutes.
Jennifer: Yes, sir.
Edward...
Operation Recourse won't work.
Your missiles aren't strong enough to stop a planet.
We are not trying to stop Mercury.
We're gonna deflect it.
The missiles will cause coordinated standoff explosions in front of the planet and drive it off course.
I already know what your plan is.
You're assuming that your guidance system will withstand a magnetic interference and synchronize the blast.
They can go off course.
They could explode before they get there.
Worse, they get sucked back into the planet, they blow it to fragments, they wipe us out anyway!
Our missiles are properly shielded.
Not against this.
Going ahead with this launch, you're choosing suicide over a firing squad.
Your sarcasm is really better suited to your community college lectures.
You don't have a say in what we do here.
We launch as soon as Mercury is within our firing range.
James:
Edward, Edward, listen.
What about Project 7?
This is exactly what it was designed for.
The deflector never worked in field testing, not once.
Without that, it's just a big rock with engines.
We've been modifying the software, we've been working out the bugs.
You pulled it so you can give your contracts to your rocket manufacturing buddies.
Well, if that's the way you want to see your failure, that's your business, but, regardless, we don't have time to dust it off now.
I can get the deflector field to work.
I've been uploading the software since I left.
I'm sorry.
You've been doing what?
- Hacking into a government weapon?
- That's my weapon.
It hasn't been your weapon since I fired you three years ago.
I could have you thrown in prison for this.
It'll work.
Just gotta let me upload the fixes.
We don't have the time or resources to launch two programs.
We're only gonna get one shot at this... and I am not gonna risk the fate of humanity on your unproven technology.
I think you know the way out.
Okay.
- Chris: Wait.
- (tires screech)
- Which way?
- I don't know.
Is this North Coast Road?
I don't know.
There's no road signs.
Let's try this way.
And you're sure P-7 is the key to stopping Mercury?
- Stake my life on it.
- Sounds like you'll be staking
- everyone's life on it, James.
- My software updates will work.
We just need to upload them to get P-7 fully online.
- That sounds easy enough.
- We just need to go to my office, get the software, then we need a secure SPEAR computer.
Did you say we?
Hello?
Mr. Preston?
- (tires screeching)
- (rumbling)
Whoa.
- Hey, hey, keep the car straight.
- It's not me.
It's the ground that's moving.
Whoa.
Oh, my God.
- It's metal.
- What?
It's not trees, it's not telephone poles.
Whatever that is, it only affected metal.
This must all be connected to Mercury.
It has to be.
Jennifer: That's not good.
That's not good at all.
We've just received report...
Seattle's been devastated by a massive magnetic event.
- How far are we from launching?
- We've had to recalculate.
Mercury's speeding up and we're having a hard time keeping a lock on it.
We have a very small window to launch these missiles and we're running out of time.
What happened to your security pass?
- Find Preston.
- Yes, sir.
- Just follow me.
- (distant dog barking)
Oh, wait.
I read on the Internet somewhere that you can open up any door with a credit card.
I think, eh, yeah, you just...
I don't know.
People never leave these things locked.
Right.
Mr. Preston?
Is anyone home?
Hello?
Hey, come here.
God, the phones still aren't working.
There's nothing here.
Nothing useful anyways.
(computer, modem beeping and buzzing)
- What is that?
- I don't know.
Looks like some kind of weapon.
Whose car is that?
What kind of guy keeps plans for a top secret weapon on his computer?
Brooke: If he were here right now,
I'd give him a piece of my mind.
What the hell are you doing in my house?
- Look, your wife sent us.
- What are you talking about?
We talked to her.
She's in trouble.
- Brooke: We can prove it.
- Yeah.
What?
Well, it's just over there.
Please?
So I used some of today's engineering with yesterday's analog technology with a few experimental bits here and there and voilà.
It broadcasts and receives farther than you can imagine.
Well, it's a work of art.
It's how we heard
Victoria's mayday.
- You wanna turn it on?
- Yeah, sorry.
Okay.
Yeah, cool.
Vic, you there?
Victoria?
Victoria:
Ground, can you please repeat?
Vic, it's me.
Um...
- you safe?
- I'm alive, but I'm the only one left.
James: What happened?
Are you okay?
Something crazy has happened and I can't really explain it, but I'm being pulled into Mercury.
Oh, my God, the magnetism.
Vic, there's been a huge magnetic event.
Yes, I know.
We were right in the middle of it.
Mercury's been magnetized and is being pushed out of its orbit.
Magnetism.
Why didn't I think of this?
Okay, if I can recalculate, if I can account for the difference in force,
I might be able to break free and come home.
Vic, there might not be a home to come back to.
Mercury's on a collision course with Earth.
Can you keep me posted on this and just double-check these?
Woman:
I just lost everything.
What is going on?
This facility should be impervious to power surges.
Mercury's interference is increasing.
It's becoming more than our shielding can handle.
Get the emergency generators back online.
The moment they stabilize,
I want those missiles in the air!
Edward, what if James is right?
Move aside.
Project 7 is the only thing that can save us from Mercury.
You need to get the hell out of there before we launch.
Victoria:
Okay, I've done everything I can to recalculate for the change in force.
I've tried to boost the engines as much as possible, but it's just not enough thrust.
Wait a minute.
What if I let it pull me in?
- What do you mean?
- A slingshot maneuver.
Yes, yes, yes.
She lets the planet pull her in, accelerating around Mercury.
That will give her the extra momentum she needs to break free.
That's a suicide mission.
- Magnetism is too unpredictable.
- Victoria: I've been trained for this.
Honey, honey.
You're not a pilot.
You've never done this before.
I have to try.
If I stay here, I'm dead.
It's my only chance.
No, no, no, no.
Vic?
Vic?!
- James, can you hear me?
- (static hissing)
Sorry, it's fragile.
It wasn't built to be dragged around like this.
- Can you hear me?
- (static hissing)
- Disengage autopilot.
- Computer: Autopilot disengaged.
Here goes nothing.
- She'll make it, she'll make it.
- (modem screeching)
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be all right.
What is that?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?
Project 7's guidance systems are damaged.
- Can't you fix it?
- It's not a software problem, it's hardware.
You can't fix it from the ground.
- So that's it?
- Um, the Nautilus.
The Nautilus has an amazing guidance system.
If Victoria can pilot the ship to Project 7, tether onto its system, we can then use it to manually guide the asteroid straight into Mercury.
We still have to do the software updates.
Without the energy field, you won't have enough force to knock Mercury off course.
- So send them.
- I can't do it from here.
Can monitor the systems, but to change anything,
I need a computer that has top-level classified access.
- And you need to fix that radio.
- (electricity buzzing)
That's another power surge.
- (buzzes)
- Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Here we go, here we go.
- (beeps)
- I got it.
Whoa.
Yes, Mr. President. Believe me, we're doing everything we can.
No, sir. These are limited range missiles.
The timing is crucial.
If we launch too early the missiles will fall short, too late, and Mercury won't be knocked off course enough to miss Earth.
- Mr. President, are you there?
- (dial tone)
Mr. President?
- I'm gonna need a new relay.
- There's an old airstrip.
One of the radio planes might have what you need.
Right, I saw it on the way in.
Here, once we get the radio up and running, we'll call you on it.
Okay. Is this even gonna work with all the interference?
Trust me, we reached Mercury with this thing. It'll work.
You gonna tell me where we're going?
The fallback facility.
- Which is what exactly?
- Designed when I was working at SPEAR.
They should have access to every weapon,
- including Project 7.
- Should have access?
The coordinates are in records storage.
- We don't even know where it is?
- That's why we're hurrying.
Hello?
Anybody here?
If we're gonna find that relay switch,
- we better start looking for it.
- I don't know. This place is creepy.
- I don't like it.
- It's a creepy old airstrip.
What did you expect?
- Here, this looks like the hangar.
- Okay.
Hello?
- I think this is the hangar.
- Okay.
- Let's check the yard here.
- Okay.
- Anything?
- No.
- Here.
- What exactly are we looking for?
We're looking for a radio that's still intact.
Okay.
No, these are all shells.
- We need to get to that hangar.
- Okay.
Hey.
- Quick.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
- Is it more meteors?
I don't think so.
It feels more like an earthquake.
- Earthquake?
- Worse, we're being hit by massive waves of electromagnetic energy.
We still can't risk launching too early.
If this EM interference increases, you won't be able to launch the missiles.
You can't fire when the interference is spiking.
Okay, then calculate intervals in between the wavelengths
- and we'll fire in between.
- Yes, sir.
- Is it over?
- I think so.
Okay, maybe this plane will have what we need.
Let's find out.
Computer:
Trajectory calculations complete.
- (beeping)
- Warning, possible collision course detected.
Recommend replotting trajectory.
Project 7.
Stupid.
What were
Projects 1 through 6?
I don't even want to know.
- Any luck?
- I think I got it.
- (static hissing)
- Yes.
We're in business.
Okay, let's get out of here.
Okay.
Stop where you are or I'll drop you where you stand.
What the hell are you doing with my plane?
- Sir...
- Shut up!
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna drop that, you're just gonna... you're gonna slowly put that down on the ground.
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna put
- your hands in the air.
- Right, okay.
Sir, we needed one part.
We've been communicating with the spacecraft Nautilus.
Sure, you have.
Hands in the air now!
Brooke: You don't understand.
This is a matter of life and death.
- We can't leave without that radio.
- You're gonna leave without the radio because it's my radio.
You know what I mean?
It's my radio.
Hurry!
Go, go!
Say your prayers, you little bastard!
How are we supposed to get inside?
There's no way to sneak around that guard.
- How'd you get that?
- I borrowed it.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
- Morning.
- Hi there.
Hey, stop right there.
Gonna need to see that ID again, sir.
Yeah, here you go.
Here you go.
G-g-g-g-gun!
Get the gun!
Get the gun!
- (gunshots)
- Help, help!
- (gunshots)
- Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
- Ow!
- Back it up. Over there, over there.
Sorry about that.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Over there, over there, over there.
What do we do?
What do we do now?
- Give me the gun.
- Okay, huh?
Just give me the gun.
Hey, hey, hey!
Back up!
Back up!
Okay, there's rope in the car.
Go get the rope.
- Keys.
- The car is open!
- Whoa! Get down!
- (screams)
Get down, get down!
Wait, can you just...
Come on, let's go!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, he's reloading.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Go, go, go!
What?
Brooke:
Oh, God.
We need to get out of here now.
- Brooke, come on!
- I'm coming!
Let's go, go, go!
Brooke:
I'm hurrying!
Matthew: Whoa.
So, uh, where do we start?
Hang on, these... aren't file cabinets supposed to have letters on them?
Secret codes, secret files, they get bar codes.
So how are we supposed to find the one we're looking for?
You take that side,
I'll take this side.
- Okay, all right.
- Just look for things that have structures, buildings, things grouped together.
- Stuff like that.
- Okay.
- Matthew?
- Yes.
- You don't have to be neat.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, well.
Fast.
Just want to keep some semblance of organization.
This took somebody a long time.
Computer: Warning, planetary gravity affecting course trajectory.
That's the plan, girl.
Computer:
Initiating emergency autopilot failsafe in five, four...
Override accepted.
Impact risk imminent.
I think I got it.
Down on the ground now!
Where's your buddy?
Oh, about time.
Where's the file?
Next time,
I'll tie him up.
I'm sorry, they don't teach you how to tie people up in astronomy school.
I still saved your butt.
- Brooke?
- Brooke: Go ahead, James.
I have the location.
Where should we meet you?
Take Highway 37.
We'll meet you at the junction at Highway 12.
- Brooke: Okay.
- Oh, and I picked this up for later.
Figured we might need it.
- You want a hug?
- Yeah, yeah, I would.
I need those wave calculations.
We're approaching the launch window.
We're working on it.
We just got systems back up.
- We're running out of time.
- I know the time table!
Sir.
Look, Jen, get a team ready and take them over to the fallback facility.
We gotta cover our bases.
If the systems go down here,
I'm not gonna be able to launch.
I need you over there to launch from there.
I'll get you the launch codes.
Michelle, please stay on those wavelengths.
Michelle: Yes, sir.
Matthew: Whoa, stop. Stop the car.
He looks like he's alive.
- James: We don't have time for this.
- We can't just leave him here.
- Matthew, get back in the car.
- We can't leave him here.
- Matthew, get back in the car!
- (man groaning)
It'll be fine.
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, buddy. You okay?
We gotta get you... we gotta get you...
- Get up, nice and slow.
- Hey.
- Easy.
- Step away from the car!
- Step away from the car!
- Take it easy, man.
Just take it easy.
Don't do it, James!
Shut up!
You think I'm kidding around?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?!
- Easy, easy.
- Get the hell away from the car!
- Buddy, I can't give you the keys.
- Shut up!
- I can't give you the keys!
- Don't be stupid, man!
- I'll cut his throat!
- I can't give you the car.
Oh, you're gonna give me the car.
- Hey!
- What's this, huh?
What are you doing?
What's this, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay!
- The keys!
- I'm gonna give you the keys.
- Yeah, you will.
- I'll give you the keys.
- Give me the keys.
That's good.
- Don't move.
- Dude.
We need to call the kids.
The radio's in the car.
It's happening again.
Hang in there, girl.
Computer: Warning, impact risk ahead.
Multiple objects approaching.
- We're almost there, girl!
- (alarm blaring)
Hold on!
Computer: Warning, heat shield breached.
Maximum pressure capacity exceeded.
- (yells)
- Computer: All systems critical.
Abort maneuver.
Repeat, abort maneuver.
Where's Matthew?
- You get the part?
- Yeah, but we haven't heard anything from Victoria yet.
Let's hope she's in the middle of the maneuver.
We gotta get out of here.
Go!
Hold it together a little longer!
Computer:
Trajectory compromised.
- Change course immediately.
- (yelling)
I have all the wave patterns mapped and the systems are all up, and there's still a lot of interference.
Okay, get ready, everyone.
We launch the second we have a clear shot.
Computer:
Course trajectory complete.
Calculating Nautilus location.
We'll never get through here.
We gotta back up.
We gotta find another way.
- All right.
- (engine chokes)
- Damn it.
- You're kidding me.
Okay, we are go for launch.
- Three, two...
- (beep)
Missiles are away.
Alternator's shot.
What are we gonna do?
How are we supposed to get around this thing?
Guess we have to walk.
- What are you doing?
- What?
I've already been shot at once today.
This thing goes on for miles.
Yeah, James.
At this rate, I don't think we're gonna make it on time.
Magnetism is increasing.
Mercury is forcing the missiles off course.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's leaking gas.
- You gotta go across to the other side.
- Okay.
No.
James?
James, can you hear me?
- James.
- Victoria: James?
- Okay, go.
- Hey, Vic.
- It's me.
- Thank God.
- Are you safe?
- I am, and I'm heading away from Mercury as fast as I can.
Have you launched P-7 yet?
We can't.
Guidance system's been damaged.
Hey, honey?
I, uh...
I need you to do something.
I don't want to ask you to do this, but I need you to take the Nautilus to Project 7 and you have to guide it to Mercury.
I guess I won't be going home as fast as I thought.
It's the only chance we have, honey.
I'll do it.
Now listen to me.
You have to tether in the Nautilus guidance system to P-7's.
I understand, James.
Now we still have to do the fixes to P-7.
We have to do that at the facility.
There's really not that much time.
I'll get there in time.
- I swear to you.
- I trust you.
Go, be safe.

Hey!
Hey, hey!
Great.
- Hey, look.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, stop!
Stop!
- Get out of the road.
- We need a ride.
Look, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Listen, I need a ride to fallback facility.
Edward Rex, he gave me his ID as proof.
Just take a look... just take a look at it.
This ID was stolen this morning.
Get on the ground, Dr. Preston.
- Hey.
- (grunts)
Back off!
You heard me.
Thank you.
On the ground.
Computer:
Estimated life support, 10 minutes.
Computer: Estimated life support, five minutes.
- James: We gotta go!
- Yup.
Sorry.
Computer: Estimated life support, three minutes.
No pressure, thank you.
Here we go.
Come on, Natalie.
- (beeps)
- (sighs)
Computer:
Life-support systems back online.
We lost contact with the contingency team.
It could just be communications.

Nautilus, prepare for docking at Project 7.
- Everybody all right?
- Better than the car, I guess.
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?!
James?
James, she's not breathing, man.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
Brooke?
Brooke, I'm so sorry.
Christopher, we gotta go.
No.
- Christopher.
- Just wait!
Brooke.
I'm sorry.
Wow.
SPEAR car.
It's Jennifer.
We're close.
We gotta get out of here.

James, can you hear me?
I don't see a facility. Are you sure we got the right coordinates?
Yeah, we're here.
The dam is camouflage.
It's also the power source for the facility.
Wow.
- Victoria: James, can you hear me?
- Okay.
- (static hissing)
- Here.
- Vic, are you all right?
- Yes, and I'm tethered to Project 7's systems.
As soon as I get the updates,
I'm ready to launch.
You have to check the targeting systems.
It'll automatically be scanning an impact threat the size of Mercury.
Oh, no.
- What's the launch window?
- If I don't get Project 7 moving,
I'll never close the gap to Mercury.
Without the updates, the shield won't work.
- Then you better hurry.
- We gotta go.
Engaging main engines.
James:
Come on!
Faster!
We gotta move!
We're almost there.
Computer:

- Christopher: Whoa, whoa!
James:
Easy, easy.
- (explosion)
- Whoa!
- Where's the control room?
- It's directly underneath the dam.
It's the only place safe enough.
Increase engines to maximum.
What are we looking for?
There it is!
- (beep)
- Computer: System error.
- Energy field inactive.
- Tell me something I don't know.
This is it.
Go.
Come on, James.
What can I do?
What do you need?
I'm gonna get the system up and running.
- Get Victoria on the radio now.
- Right.
Victoria, do you copy?
Computer: Abort maneuver.
Repeat, abort maneuver.
- Victoria: Go ahead.
- Here, I got her.
Good boy.
Vic, it's updating right now.
James, it's too late.
Hey, don't give up on me!
Hang in there, okay?
We need to go!
- James, listen.
- We need to get out of here!
Go, go!
Victoria:
Listen to me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Computer:

Computer: Warning, docking collar malfunction.
Time to go home.
Oh, my God.
Yeah!
James, you were right.
About everything.
Victoria knew what she was doing.
If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be here, right?
None of us would.
Try her.
- What?
- Try her.
- Try her.
- Yeah.
Here.
- (static hissing)
- Okay.
Vic, you there?
Vic, it's James.
Vic, you copy?
Victoria:
James, do you read?
- You made it.
- (laughs)
Looks like the world did, too.
Why don't you come on down and enjoy the view?
Victoria:
I'm already on my way.
And for the record, the view up here isn't so bad either.

My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
When you're burned,
you've got nothing --
no cash, no credit,
no job history.
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work
comes your way.
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate....
Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.
That's how we do it, people.
Bottom line --
as long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.
Listen to me, Michael.
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
You ordered him to!
Guys like you and me -- we know the ends justify the means.
- Mike, what'd you do?
- I did what I had to, Sam.
Fi, how we looking?
There's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy hitter seems to be running the show.
It just became my mission in life to put you behind bars.
All of you.
Pretty flowers.
I didn't bring them.
A friend of Nate's must have come by earlier.
A friend.
Are we friends now, Bly?
Olivia Riley is coming for you.
Your actions have put her reputation on the line.
At this point, she doesn't care who she has to hurt to get to you.
Sam, you all right?
Mike, you made me a promise.
You swear to me that you're gonna make this right.
I swear to you
I'll make this right, Sam.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Sam!
Sam?
Sam!
Sam?
Sam!
In any kind
of emergency situation,
an operative's greatest enemy
is panic.
The spike of adrenaline,
the increased blood pressure,
and the loss
of any sense of time
can make it impossible
to think clearly --
at exactly the time
you need a clear head the most.
In those moments,
it takes all your training,
all your willpower to pull
yourself back from the brink.
Jed, it's Fiona.
We're on our way.
Look, I don't care who's there.
We're coming.
Get ready.
Come on. Sam?!
I can't wake him up, Fi.
We'll be at Jed's in two minutes.
Go, Fi! Go!
Fiona, I am in the middle of a party.
Party's over.
My friend needs help.
Are you freaking kidding me?
He's dying.
No, he's not dying.
You're not gonna let him die.
Everyone out!
Okay, no.
I want him out of here.
I am serious!
I'm more serious.
Okay.
Okay, come on.
That's it.
Here. Let me just -- let me get this.
Not the...pool table.
Okay, this -- this doesn't look good.
I-is the bullet still in there?
Yeah, 9mm, close range through a car door.
Through a car door, sure.
Okay, he's got internal bleeding.
The round is probably lodged up against his spleen.
Get it out!
Okay, does this look like a surgery theater to you, Fiona?
I have a little medical bag to stitch minor wounds and pull splinters.
I don't do full-on procedures in my house.
Well, you do today.
What do you need?
He's lost a lot of blood.
He's gonna need a transfusion.
I'll take care of that.
In an emergency,
a blood transfusion can be
as simple as running a tube
between the major blood vessels
of two compatible donors
and letting gravity
do the rest.
Emergency surgery
is a little more difficult.
Often, the most you can do
is sterilize
whatever tools
you have on hand,
keep the wound clean,
and hope for the best.
Okay, now I just got to put that...
Wait a minute.
What -- what is it?
I am not getting a pulse.
We're losing him.
Well, why aren't you doing anything?
I-I am doing something.
I'm holding in his spleen.
He needs CPR now.
Wait. Hold on.
Stop, stop, stop!
He's breathing again.
You did it.
You did good there.

In many ways, it's easier
to function during combat
than after.
In a fight,
there's always something to do,
something to focus on.
Later, when you're dealing
with the consequences,
the only thing you can do
is wait and hope.
Hey, Mike.
You look worse than me.
Sam.
Oh, it's good to hear your voice again.
Christ. Was it that bad?
Yeah.
It was all kind of a blur getting here.
I had this vague memory that...
Fi gave me mouth-to-mouth?
Did that happen?
Yeah.
You get pictures?
I guess I forgot.
It was a little hectic.
Yeah.
Where the hell are we?
We're at a doctor friend of Fiona's.
We brought you here after you passed out.
How's your mom and Jesse?
They'll be here soon.
We're gonna stay here as long as we need.
No. Mike, man, come on.
You guys should just go, okay?
Get out of town.
I mean, obviously, I'm in no shape to be on the run, so you're gonna be much better off if you --
It's not gonna happen,
Sam.
Mike, you know damn well as well as I do --
Sam, you are gonna rest or I'm gonna give you something to make you rest.
You're a stubborn son of a bitch, Mike.
You were supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.
Yeah, we were picking up some new wheels, and someone was dragging her feet a little bit, wasn't she?
Oh, excuse me for not being wild about going on a car-theft spree.
How's Sam?
Well, we stopped the bleeding and closed him up.
He's stable.
Good. That's something.
For a second there,
I was thinking something
I didn't want to be thinking.
Should we just, uh, put our stuff in here or what?
No!
No, no, no, no.
You -- you can't put your things anywhere.
Fiona, who are these people?
My friends.
Oh.
Well, this is my house, and these are not my friends.
Well, that's unfortunate because that makes you my enemy.
You're not my enemy, are you?
Whatever.
This is gonna cost you extra.
A lot extra.
Put it on my tab.
Love the new landlord.
So, what's the plan now?
We're working on it.
You might want to get comfortable.
We're gonna be here a while.
There's a reason most people
don't sleep well in new places.
The brain goes on alert
in unfamiliar environments,
sensitive to possible dangers.
Add some very real dangers,
and the chances are low that
you'll get any shut-eye at all.
Mom.
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to sneak up on people?
Sorry. I was just checking on everyone.
Couldn't sleep either, huh?
Not really.
I've been trying to figure out what to do.
Sam's too sick to travel, and Riley's gonna find this place eventually.
We can't stay here and we can't leave.
Now you know what life with your father was like.
How did you deal with it?
I made a choice and I lived with the consequences.
We all did.
I can't do that.
I know you can't.
Your father couldn't do it, either.
Once he saw something he wanted both ways, he'd just do whatever he damn well had to do to have it both ways.
Usually, it was the rest of us who paid the price.
But he was a genius at it.
You got that from him, honey.
You'll figure something out.
I'm gonna go check on the others. You okay, Mom?
Yeah, I'll try and get some sleep now that damn dog stopped barking.
Dog?
Yeah. The neighbor's dog's been yapping.
Finally, it shut up.
Wasn't the clock just on?
Michael, what's going on?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Someone cut the power.
Hide behind the desk, don't move.
Do it.
Modern night-vision goggles
provide visibility
in near total darkness,
adapt to
changing light conditions,
and provide better contrast
and resolution
than the human eye,
which is why most assassins
aren't just confident
in the dark, they prefer it.
As good as they are, though,
night-vision goggles still have
a significant weakness.
They make it easier
to see what's in front of you
but tough to see what's
coming at you from the side.
Mike?
Mike, you okay?
Mike.
Yep. Great. Thanks.
Who are they?
I don't know, but...
It sounds like they didn't come alone.
Oh, great.
You sure you're good?
Yeah.
Yeah, they're out there.
Shooting at them's gonna be a problem.
I can barely see them.
I can help you with that.
When fighting at night,
attackers usually
have the upper hand.
They know where the defenders
are and can fight from cover,
concealing
their position and number.
You ready?
Yeah.
The best defense
is to even the playing field
by taking away the darkness.
In the army, that means
M224 illumination mortars,
but if you're
short on heavy artillery,
a flaming quart of scotch
will work, too.
They're running.
They're running.
All right, we're all clear.
We won't be for long.
Why?
I took a look at the bodies.
This is a cartel tattoo.
Cartel? Why --
The same cartel we went after earlier this year...
For the CIA.
What are you saying?
Someone sent these guys.
They knew our names, photos.
They had high-res satellite images -- government images.
Riley?
She couldn't get us, so she gave the job to a cartel who wanted me dead.
Nice and clean.
A CIA officer sends a drug cartel after us?
Yeah.
So she's gone from capturing us to killing us.
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do.
We take the fight to her.
It looks like we're clear.
Yeah, for now.
They're gonna start checking the motels sooner or later.
That's why we have to move first.
Yeah, about that plan.
If Riley's really coming after us with a cartel kill squad, shouldn't we be trying to stay, like, as far away as possible?
The fact that she's using them is the best weapon we have.
If we can get her caught --
That's a big "if."
We can't just all waltz into a police station right now.
Who will listen to us?
Jason Bly.
Bly? Michael, are you crazy?
He wants to arrest you.
I know.
But he's the only potential ally we have.
He knows Tom Card was dirty and he has a thing about CIA officers breaking the rules.
Well, he's not just gonna take our word for it.
We're gonna need some evidence.
How are we gonna manage that?
Use me.
No, Sam.
You're in no condition.
This can work.
Riley knows that I'm hurt, so she's gonna be watching the hospitals to see if I turn up.
You drop me there.
You scram when she shows.
Fi and Jesse can plant a bug and a tracker on her car.
How do we know she's gonna go back to the cartel, Sam?
Well, I'm just gonna have to rattle her cage enough to make sure she does.
I mean, she's already losing it, clearly, so it shouldn't take much.
In the meantime,
I can see a real doctor, which would be good because, you know, I got shot.
But if it doesn't work, Sam,
Riley would have --
Mike, if this doesn't work, we're all screwed.
No, Sam.
I can't allow it.
You can't allow it?
I thought this was a team, not a dictatorship.
You heard any better ideas?
He's got a point,
Michael.
Damn right I do.
Call Bly, Mike, set the meeting.
When you're being hunted,
it's a good idea
not to go to meetings
at the scheduled
time and place.
Often, the best approach
is to show up
before your contact
has even left for the meeting.
Nice ride.
Come on, man.
So I'm guessing we're not meeting in Hialeah.
I thought
I'd save you the trouble.
Gas mileage in a Crown Vic has got to be brutal.
I'm getting the sense that you don't trust me.
I'm not trusting many people these days.
But if it's any consolation,
I trust you more than most.
Aww.
I assume we're negotiating the terms of your surrender here then?
Actually, I want to talk about something else.
No, no, no. Sorry, Westen.
There's nothing else to talk about.
Bly, listen to me. Please!
Riley has gone rogue in a serious way.
She sent a hit team after us.
She's working with a drug cartel.
I'm aware that she's been playing it fast and loose, but a drug cartel?
That's a serious accusation.
I'm supposed to take your word for this?
No. But you can see it with your own eyes.
I'm putting a plan in place.
You interested?
We had a deal -- you surrender, you help with my investigation into this Tom Card mess.
Card is dead, Bly!
You want to waste time investigating a corpse
or going after someone who's selling out the Agency as we speak?
Okay, fine.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.
Hey,
I'm interested to know -- what happens if your plan doesn't work?
If it doesn't work, it's probably 'cause I'm dead.
You all right?
Well, I just had a bullet plucked out of me yesterday, so I think I'm doing pretty well considering.
So, uh, what do we do here?
Pick a number or what?
No, you have a hole in your side.
You go right to the front of the line.
May I help you?
Hey, sweetheart. How you doing?
I guess
I need to see a doctor.
What's the nature of your injury?
He was shot.
Yeah. I was cleaning a gun, and it went off.
It was the damndest thing.
I'll go get a doctor.
Good idea.
So, Mike, you sure you want to be here when this goes down?
This plan only works if Riley sees me here.
Plus, you need a doctor.
I need a good mojito.
That's what I need.
Well, you're out of luck.
I overheard an orderly saying they're fresh out of mint.
Damn, Mike.
This reminds me of Kuwait.
You remember that?
Lugging you for 6 miles in a sandstorm?
It's hard to forget.
Yeah, well,
I'll never forget it, either.
Dr. Ryan to pediatrics.
Come on.
All right, this is it, Sam.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine, buddy.
I got the easy job.
I get to lie in a bed.
You get the big part.
So, listen, Mike, you promised me that you would make this right.
Don't let me down.
Okay, boys. All right.
Get him to examination bay 1.
"Examination bay" --
I like the sound of that.
Sir, you can wait here.
For a fugitive,
getting medical attention
is a big risk.
Doctors have to notify the
police of all gunshot wounds,
fake names are flagged
by insurance computers,
and hospital security is often
hooked into law enforcement.
All of which is bad if you're
trying to stay off the grid
but perfect if you want to
attract some attention.
Hey, Fi. How's it going?
We're in the van out front keeping an eye on things.
The parking lot just got more crowded.
Do we have a visual on Riley?
Yeah, your other girlfriend has arrived.
Got another CIA vehicle, about half a dozen guys, and local police, too.
That's why the security guard decided it was a good idea to hang out at the front entrance.
Are they coming in now?
No, not yet, but it won't be long.
Look, Mike, we're gonna need a lot of eyes looking the other way if we're gonna make it to Riley's car.
So whatever you do, make it spectacular, man.
That's what I was planning on.
Wish me luck.
Excuse me, sir.
I need to speak with you for a moment.
Sir! Suspect is fleeing!
Suspect is fleeing!
Move! Get out of the way!
Suspect's on the southeast side of the building.
All right.
That's your cue.
You sure you don't need help?
Yeah, I got this.
Escaping a larger force
is about limiting
your pursuer's options.
Using a narrow path takes their
vehicles out of the equation,
but if you have time to set
your escape route beforehand,
the best way to win a foot
chase is on two wheels.
Westen's trying to escape on a motorcycle in the back of the building.
Go, go, go!
Westen!
Move, move!
Son of a bitch!
Mr. Axe.
Good to see you again.
Morphine drip.
Wow. You must be in a lot of pain.
Some.
I've had worse hangovers.
Don't worry.
This won't take long.
I only have one question for you.
Well, then I guess we're both out of luck,
'cause I got zero answers for your one question.
Is that right?
See, because I think you're gonna tell me how to find Michael Westen.
Oh, yeah?
Why do you think that?
Well, I'll tell you,
Mr. Axe.
I'm replacing your painkiller with a mild stimulant.
This should keep you awake, thinking about my questions.
Unfortunately, it also increases your sensitivity to pain...
A lot.
Doesn't matter.
I got nothing to say.
We'll see how you feel after a few hours without pain meds.
Anyway, we got enough information from the things we found on you to start a search, so...
Oh, hey, uh, before you go,
I do have one thing to say.
I'm all ears.
You know,
I was slowing Mike down.
I'm not anymore.
You took the gloves off, sister.
You called in a hit on his mom.
So you don't have to worry about finding Michael Westen.
'Cause he's gonna find you.
And when he does, he is gonna end this.
Well...we'll see about that,
Mr. Axe.
Oh, God.
Oh, son of a bitch.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
We're doing surveillance on a CIA officer.
I liked it better when the plan was to go...
Get away from this.
Well, at least the hard part's over, Fi.
Yeah, I wish
I could believe that.
Riley's on the move.
And she is not a happy lady.
Here.
It's me. We need to
move our appointment up.
This thing
is getting way out of hand.
Just meet me.
I'm not talking about this over the phone.
3:00 p.m.
Whatever Sam said to her worked.
She moves fast.
- Michael?
- Yeah, Fi?
It looks like Riley's gonna meet her cartel friends.
Time for your show-and-tell.
I'll see you there.
In general,
spies are more involved
in gathering intelligence
than gathering evidence.
Espionage methods are generally
not approved by police
or admissible in court.
So when it comes
to getting someone arrested,
your job is
to get the ball up the field
before handing it off
to someone who's in a position
to put it in the end zone.
You dragged me all the way out here for this?
Fi and Jesse tracked her here across three counties.
Oh, yeah?
Where are they at now?
In the trees on the other side of the dock, covering the marina.
Are they here to protect you from her or from me?
Who says it can't be both?
It's an awful lot of trouble to watch a woman stroll along the water.
A woman who doubled back and checked for tails all the way here.
It's suspicious.
That's not enough.
You promised me Riley in personal contact with the cartel.
You'll have it.
And if I don't?
If this mystery contact doesn't show?
Do I get to bring you in as a consolation prize?
Hey, you guys in place?
Yeah, we're here.
Good, 'cause there's a big-ass yacht coming in.
Looks like this party's about to get started.
They're here. You ready?
Why are you here?
The plan was no more meetings.
Yeah, well, the plan changed the minute your boys got their asses handed to them by Michael Westen.
Hey, those were some of my best sicarios.
Then get some better ones and twice as many!
Listen, you want a pass from the CIA?
You want help with the D.E.A.?
Then you better start holding up your end of the bargain, and that means
Westen's head on a plate.
Westen.
He got lucky once.
It will not happen again.
Was -- was that worth the trip?
I have a lead on his location.
One of his friends just checked into a hospital.
I have a motel key and some calls we pulled on his cellphone.
Good.
Come aboard.
We'll find Westen and we will finish this.
Unbelievable.
Selling out the CIA and the D.E.A. to a drug cartel?
This is the kind of thing that ends up in a congressional hearing.
And the key witness at that hearing?
Let's just say someone's future got a little brighter.
Nice job, Westen.
Listen, Bly, for what it's worth, I appreciate it.
All right, all right.
Just don't get too gushy on me.
Bly, marina security is here.
We should probably move.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Oh, just wondering what you're doing here.
We've had some vandalism in the area recently, and I need to check on everybody who --
Agent Bly, CSS.
We're part of a law-enforcement operation that's in progress.
Yeah, w-what kind of operation?
It's classified, I'm afraid, which is why we'd appreciate it if you kept this quiet, if you don't mind.
Oh, sure. Sure thing.
Sorry about that...Officer?
Close enough.
Bly, the security guard's with the cartel.
What? What are you talking about?
Grenade!
What the hell was that?
Oh, God.
Fi, no, no, no. You can't.
There's too many of them!
We got to figure out what's going on.
You want to tell me what the hell just happened?
I'll handle it.
Hey, it's me.
Michael, what just happened?
The marina security guard was working with the cartel.
It's bad.
The evidence -- it's all gone.
And, Fi...Bly's dead.
Oh, Michael.
I thought you...
I was right there with her, man.
I thought we were leaving without you.
I'm fine.
You think we can get to the road this way?
Yeah, if we're gonna go, we better go.
Mike, seriously, we got to go.
No.
All the evidence we had on Riley just burned up in that car.
If we leave empty-handed, she gets a free pass on all of this.
Michael, what are you talking about?
One man is already dead.
We're outnumbered.
We're outgunned.
There's nothing we can do.
No, we have to deal with Riley now, otherwise Bly just died for nothing.
And our best chance is while she's still here.
Now, if I can make it over to the seawall,
I can make it onto that boat.
You want to get onto the boat, that boat?
The boat that belongs to the people that's trying to kill us.
What -- what are you gonna do when you get there?
I promised Sam
I would make this right.
Now, you can go back to the car and you can leave, but I have to stay here and do this.
You're gonna need help getting to that boat in one piece.
All right, we'll lay down some cover fire as a distraction.
Just make it quick.
We're gonna be ducking some serious bullets over here.
Okay, I don't know what Mike has planned, but it better happen quick.
We won't be able to hold out here.
Just give him time.
If we stick around and whatever he's planning doesn't work...
It will work. It has to.
Why are we moving?
I can't be on a cartel boat in open water.
I'm almost out of ammo, and those guys are getting closer.
They stopped.
What?
The boat's leaving.
The boat's leaving.
Remind me -- is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I have no idea.
W-wait here, señora Riley.
Everything is under control, okay?
Armando, get --
Yeah, I wouldn't.
Drop it, Westen.
I don't think so.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
Who this boat belongs to?
I know exactly who this boat belongs to.
Then you're not as smart as I thought you were.
The cartel already wants me dead.
I don't think this will make much of a difference.
What about the Coast Guard?
It looks like they're on their way to meet us.
Yeah, I know.
I called them.
I told them about a well-armed drug boat in their waters.
They were very, very interested.
Most people
don't think of the Coast Guard
as being
particularly well-armed.
Most people are wrong.
A Coast Guard patrol boat
is armed with two
.50-caliber machine guns
and a 25-millimeter cannon,
which means it can take out
anything short of a battleship.
Motor vessel Zazu, this is the U.S. Coast Guard off your port beam.
Heave to and stop your vessel.
I repeat -- this is the U.S. Coast --
What are you doing?
You realize if you ignore them, they're gonna fire on us?
I'm counting on it.
Are you crazy?
You're the reason we're on this boat, Riley.
You're the one who sent the cartel hit squad after me.
We finish this today one way or another.
So you want me to call and confess.
Is that what this is?
Fine.
You win, Westen.
You got me.
Just call them off, and I'll come clean.
No, you'll talk your way out of a confession as fast as you make one.
If you're as good as I think you are, you made arrangements to make it look like
I was the one working with the cartel.
You falsified accounts in my name.
You made up communication logs.
You spun a web of lies to cover your ass.
If the Agency found out about that, that's something you couldn't explain and that's what
I want you to give them.
That's ridiculous.
I never did anything.
I bet both of our lives you did.
It's really the smart play.
I mean, it's a great plan, but it only works if I'm dead.
It still might work, but you will die with me.
Now, that was a warning shot, and you know the Coast Guard.
They're not very patient with situations like this.
I'm getting nothing on the radio.
Attention, motor vessel Zazu,
stop your engines immediately or we will be forced to use destructive fire.
Let's get their attention.
Mount 2-1, report when you have them on target and tracking.
On target and tracking!
Battery's released.
Commence fire.
I think it's time to make that call.
Are you really gonna go through with this?
You're gonna kill us both?
My friends have suffered enough.
It ends today.
No matter what the cost.
Well, you know what,
Westen?
I got a bit of bad news for you.
This little idea you have about who you think I am, what you think I would do, it's a fantasy.
It's a creation of your own twisted mind.
Then I guess we have nothing more to talk about.
They're increasing speed.
Mount 2-1, load 100 rounds of high explosives and stand by to engage.
I'm not taking chances.
Locked in and ready to fire on command.
Attention, motor vessel Zazu, stop your vessel immediately or we will fire on you.
You have five seconds to comply.
All right, I'll call!
Just call them off!
Coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is motor vessel Zazu.
Captain, I think they're trying to hail us.
Gunnery station, stand down.
Cease fire!
Motor vessel Zazu,
slow to 5 knots on a down swell and prepare leave for my boarding team to embark.
Do you copy?
Copy loud and clear.
We'll be right out.
We just need to make a phone call.
Yes, it's Olivia Riley.
Give me the Deputy Chief.
When something goes wrong
in the intelligence world --
a scandal, a security breach,
or just a failed operation --
there's always a debriefing
where the facts are sorted out.
When those facts threaten
careers and institutions,
no one takes any chances.
You're locked away
until the process is over.
All you can do
is tell your side of the story
and hope for the best and know
that no matter what you do,
your fate
lies in someone else's hands.
Miss Glenanne, come with me, please.
More questions?
I told them everything there is to know.
We've been here three weeks.
We turned ourselves in peacefully.
How long does it take to "sort out what happened"?
Ma'am.
Where's Michael?
Give us a minute.
You all right?
Yeah.
What are they...
They'll be released shortly.
I just wanted to talk to you first.
Michael, where have you been?
They've been debriefing us this whole time, asking about
Riley and Tom Card.
They were doing the same to me.
Really?
It doesn't look like the same.
I've been in a 10'x10' holding cell.
You're riding in helicopters, ordering around CIA officers.
What's going on?
Michael, we were gonna get out.
In Panama, you said that we were done with all this.
You said it would just be us.
I needed to protect you.
I needed to protect all of us.
Michael, what have you done?
I couldn't leave you in there forever.
They weren't just gonna forget everything that happened and release you.
So I made a deal.
I did what I --
What you had to do.
No, Michael.
You did what you wanted to do.
No.
No, no.

Love?
Must we?
I was probably the worst bed partner on five continents.
All my life, idiotically,
I thought that sex seemed to matter so desperately to the man who wanted it that to withhold it was like withholding bread, an act of selfishness.
And all that bread isn't worth a hoot in hell.
Hmm.
What's always really absorbed me about life is what's happening on the outside.
Action.
Now, that, that was something to be shared.
I've always felt most at home in the most difficult places.
But love?
I'm a war correspondent.
Of course, there are wars...
...and there are wars.
Here we go.
Pull! Look at that!
That's one son of a bitch.
Yeah, but you're a son of a bitch, too.
Come on!
But I know one thing he doesn't.
Pull, for God's sakes.
Hold on!
Oh, really?
Come on, Papa! Bring him!
Everything dies.
It was by pure chance that I ever met him.
I was in Key West with my mother and brother on a family trip after my father died.
There was this bar called Sloppy Joe's.
I remember thinking, the first time I saw him...
Okay!
"Who is that large, dirty man in those disgustingly soiled clothes?"
Oh, my God!
That's Ernest Hemingway.
Papa, anoint the beast!
No.
That man appears to be indigen.
Not bad, huh? Good day! Good day!
Skinner, another drink.
Don't look now, Papa, but something's coming.
Hey, how's it going?
I've never kissed a fish.
Sloppy Joe's tradition. Friend or foe?
Or faux friend, you never know.
You find out eventually.
What's your name, elegance?
Martha Gellhorn.
Well, Gellhorn, big game's no fun if it just wanders up to you.
Oh, but I'm not one of your big game animals.
Oh, I can see what you aren't,
I'm just trying to figure out what the hell you are.
If we have a drink, am I gonna have to fight your husband?
Uh... My brother.
That's my mother.
In that case, I hope you're thirsty.
You want to invite him over?
You want another?
Everybody Tells You You're Blonde?
I find that hard to believe.
You know the song?
I know Italian.
And I know the song.
What do you think of that, boys?
So what do you do, sophisticated?
What do I do?
Oh, lately, I've been seeing the world.
- How is the world?
It's surprising, occasionally.
- Is that mine?
- Sure.
Mmm!
A lot of rum in this rum.
Well, in this joint, they don't drink to get drunk, they drink to stay drunk.
The clientele here scare you?
Scare me? No.
No, I just got back from Berlin.
Now, the Nazis?
They're scary.
Like smelly little boys running around with Lugers.
Pretty rough company for a young Fräulein.
Blondes get a free pass in the Fatherland.
They do fine here, too, from what I've read.
So drink up.
America's plush as the pope's bed.
Don't be naive.
Plenty of people still go hungry.
You sound like Eleanor Roosevelt.
Trust me, I am nothing like Eleanor Roosevelt.
- I've known the woman my whole life.
- Of course, you have.
Let's see the review.
- What?
- Come on, Gellhorn.
Every writer keeps one review.
Well, you can blame Mrs. Roosevelt.
She encouraged me to write it.
It's called The Trouble I've Seen.
- The trouble you've seen?
- Mmm-hmm.
What was that?
Daddy loop to the country club?
Oh, I've seen trouble. I didn't say it was mine.
I ran around the country, I lived in hobo camps, I settled Appalachian families...
"The book seems to be woven not out of words, but out of the very tissue of human beings."
"Who is this Martha Gellhorn?
Her writing burns."
"Hemingway himself does not write more authentic American..."
As usual, the critic got it wrong.
I mean, comparing me to you is ridiculous.
All I really did was listen.
It's their dialogue.
The whole trick is writing the way people talk.
Most people never listen.
I set out to cover grimy lives, and I ended up looking glamorous on the cover of The Saturday Review.
I have the same problem.
I think I should go.
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, please. I practically own the place.
Papa, now we're really late.
It's all right, I'm going.
Buy yourself a new shirt, Hemingway.
It was nice knowing you.
Gellhorn.
Come on, Papa. Pauline's gonna be mad.
Who's Pauline?
May I help you?
Is this the Hemingway house?
Yes. I'm Pauline Hemingway.
Mrs. Hemingway.
I met Mr. Hemingway at Sloppy Joe's.
Yes, of course. Sloppy Joe's.
Well, you're late.
Come in.
Such an interesting room.
My husband likes to say, "Kill enough animals and you probably won't kill yourself."
I can see he's not taking any chances.
Ernest has read every word he writes aloud to me.
I'm his first pair of ears and his first pair of eyes.
So you're his muse.
That makes you very lucky.
Great talent needs a great amount of care.
But we've managed to make a very happy life here.
Ernest likes to surround himself with exotic characters.
- Fascist propaganda!
Some people believe that Franco would not be able to win this war if he didn't have any support.
Hitler and Mussolini, you see him here, are literally throwing money and weapons to Franco and the fascists.
Meanwhile, America and the rest of Europe are doing nothing.
And Why?
Because the only images the world sees come from fascist propaganda.
Fascism is on the move, make no mistake.
And what is happening in Spain is...
It's a threat to our democracy as well.
We need to tell the truth of what is happening to these people in Spain, these people who are trying to defend their democratically-elected government.
Here you see some of the Russian forces there, who are also in support.
All young men, as you can see, dedicated to la causa.
Dos, who is that horrid little man dressed as an undertaker?
Pauline, this is Mikhail Koltsov.
He's a Russian journalist.
Koltsov is not just a journalist, he's Stalin's eyes and ears.
Only Russia supplies the loyalists with arms, medicine, food to feed orphans and starving peasants.
I would like to introduce the director of this film, Joris Ivens, the great Dutch documentary filmmaker, who, with your help, will be able to return to Spain and complete this film.
- Beautiful.
- Excellent work.
Oh, and it is also our great privilege to have with us tonight a man who has seen firsthand the horrors that Franco and the fascists are inflicting upon his people, he is also my very dear friend,
Professor Paco Zarra.
Well, there are many heroes.
I only wish I could have brought them all with me tonight.
But we are all counting on you for your support.
Hey, you started without me!
Oh, well, if it isn't our host.
- Hey, Joris!
- Hemingway.
In case any of you are wondering how to sign your checks, write with a Parker!
- Write like Hemingway.
- Fame's a whore, Dos, doesn't mean to say she can't do something good.
I missed you, you prick.
My book's outselling you in Russia, you know.
Can I say how happy I am for you?
- You could, but that would ruin it.
Gellhorn.
Martha Gellhorn, John Dos Paseos, greatest writer in America not named Hemingway.
John Dos Paseos.
Hemingway thinks writing is a blood sport.
Don't kid yourself, Dos.
Gellhorn here is a bestselling author.
I read her review.
She's gunning for both of us.
- And to think she never said a word!
- Excuse me.
Sidney, darling, will you take the boys out of here
- and go play bullfighter or something?
- Sure.
Here we go!
The boys don't need to see all of this.
Come on, the boys should see the world for what it is.
Not tonight.
- Paco Zarra.
- Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
- I admire what you're doing.
- Thank you.
There's two sides to this little war in Spain.
You're only raising money for one of them.
Why are you backing the communists?
- Pauline...
- Mrs. Hemingway, communist is not the same as anti-fascist.
Does anti-fascist mean you kill Catholics?
Well, sadly, the Church has allied itself with the fascists.
I'm sorry, but in this house, we are Catholics.
Catholic in America is very different than Catholic in Spain.
I've heard the loyalists go into people's homes, and God help you if they find a cross on the wall.
Oh, I'm not sure I believe all of that.
What do you believe, dear?
Do you go to church?
Actually, no.
Oh, Gellhorn! Is that...
I'm half Jewish.
Is there such a thing?
No, we're not closed-minded, dear.
While Ernest was in Spain, he met Sidney, a Brooklyn-born bullfighter.
Now, Sidney's Jewish, too, and he's just like family.
Mmm-hmm.
Papa? Why don't you come back to my country?
If you told our story, the world would listen.
No writer alive has done more to support the Spanish people, but my husband has a family right here and a deadline on a novel.
- And you?
- Well, I believe that the Spanish Civil War is just a dress rehearsal for the next world war, and I think that anyone that can go should go.
And how the hell do you think you'll manage that?
You ever try to get into a war zone?
I'm resourceful.
- I think you must come. I mean it.
- So, enough politics, it's late.
Somebody has to get up in the morning and write.
Do you want to come this way?
We need you.
We need journalists from all over the world to report what's really happening in Spain.
Pauline's right, you know, Hem.
We could all use a new Hemingway novel.
Besides, we need some good men on the domestic front.
Come to Spain and you'll see it for yourself.
I'll be leaving tomorrow morning for Madrid, and I hope you can find a way to come.
People from all over the world are heading into Spain.
Writers, poets, artists, laborers, all passionate believers in la causa.
The people of Spain need to know that help is on the way.
I'm gonna sing you our song. Okay?
It starts like this.
I believed that all one did
about a war was go to it as a gesture of solidarity
and get killed or, if lucky, survive until the war was over.
A knapsack and about $50.
That was my equipment for Spain.
Anything more seemed unnecessary.
Needed to get papers, so I cajoled a friend at Collier's
to write me a letter naming me war correspondent,
even though I had never written a word about war.
Fancy collar.
- His name is Sandor.
- Mmm.
- Hello, Sandor.
What a beautiful collar you have.
Rabbit's foot.
It's good luck.
I'm going to the front to fight Franco and the fascists.
- Good for you.
- Thank you.
You?
I'm a writer.
With those legs?
Actually, I don't use them to write.
Though I once knew a man who played the xylophone with his toes.
It's true.
Thank you.
When I looked at the faces of the men in the international brigades,
I found I loved them immeasurably.
They were private citizens, here at their own expense.
They came to Spain for a cause,
compelled not by government but by passion.
From this valley they say you are going
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened the pathways awhile
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember that red river valley
And the boy who has loved you so true
Don't you think of the valley you are leaving
Or how lonely and sad it will be
Oh, and think of the fond hearts you're breaking
And the grief that you're causing to me
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember...
Would you like some more wine,
Mr. Hemingway?
Thank you.
Smell that air!
Spanish earth!
Hey, we're meeting our battalion in Madrid.
Can I hitch a ride?
You can't. It's too tough for a woman.
I had this feeling that one had to work all day and all night,
and love as many people as one could, and do it all,
do it all terribly fast.
Press release from Commissar Koltsov.
Come on, baby.
- Press release.
- We do it standing up, we make a tripod.
Press release from Commissar Koltsov.
You're not listening.
To beat the fascists, we need to beat them in the propaganda war.
Beat the fascists, you need to kill them.
You're both wrong.
You have to win over the peasants, give them irrigation.
- Gentlemen.
- Welcome to Spain!
Papa!
- Now we gonna beat that bastard Franco!
- Hey!
You still like cocido madrileño?
Hell, yes, Lupe.
Why do you think I came back to Spain?
For you!
A true honor.
I am Mikhail Koltsov, and I always say,
"Ernest Hemingway is America's Tolstoy."
Papa.
- Have a drink.
- Gentlemen.
Boy, this is a surprise.
I didn't think Pauline was gonna let you off the leash.
Look at that!
That help you get laid, Dos?
- Papa!
- Mr. Hemingway!
- Papa, what you gonna do to Franco?
- Why did you come here?
I'm here with director Joris Ivens and my good friend, John Dos Paseos.
We're gonna make a movie.
We're gonna show the world the noble struggle of those defending the elected government of Spain.
Hey, what's that?
Here, pass it back.
It's Russian! It's Russian. It's one of ours.
Is there a doctor here?
Is this a woman?
- She made it.
- I know. It's great.
Well, look who's here.
Well, hello, Hemingway.
You know how to make an entrance.
Why? Jealous?
- All Cinderella had was a pumpkin.
Cinderella needs a drink.
Joris. Dos. Hello, Paco.
- I told you I'd make it.
- Si, thank you.
Glad to be here.
I'm so happy you're here.
Welcome to Madrid.
In here?
Oh, boy.
Attaboy, let it out.
You're one tough Hungarian, my friend.
Hey, where's the front?
It's supposed to be around here.
Twelve blocks away.
Follow the streetcar tracks.
Just past the university.
You can't miss it.
- I'm Martha Gellhorn.
- Who?
Martha Gellhorn.
From Collier's.
You have something from Collier's?
Uh...
I do.
War correspondent?
In name only.
Oh!
Needed that.
You're a long way from Sloppy Joe's.
Pull in your claws, kitten.
I was always gonna be here.
Okay, sign here.
- Room 428.
- Four twenty-eight?
You're on the safe side of the building.
Hey, Capa!
Look what we got here.
A real war correspondent.
Another one.
It's getting crowded at the bar, you know.
Closest most of them get to a gun is standing next to a soldier in the pissoir.
Not this one. Martha Gellhorn, meet my Hungarian friend, Robert Capa.
Capa. Nice to meet you.
I know your photographs.
- Need another drink?
- Need a bath.
Sidney! Bath.
- Really, I can turn a spigot.
- No hot water. Need to boil.
Need to sleep.
I'm on the same floor.
Oh.
Look at that.
Her legs begin at her shoulders.
Hmm.
Oh.
It's all yours.
Hemingway!
Hemingway! Open the door!
Come on! Let...
Let me out of here!
Hemingway!
How dare you, bastard!
Excuse me, sweetness?
Why the hell would you lock me in here?
In case you hadn't noticed, Gellhorn, as you're the only blonde in the joint, but there's a city of men, desperate men, some of whom know they're gonna die, death frees the beast.
Do I need to tell you what these bastards could do to a big, creamy bitch like you in the dark?
Okay, enough, Hemingway. I get it.
There's a war going on, don't trust anyone.
So how do I know if I can even trust you now?
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust him.
Werner, you're right.
- This is the best angle.
- Camera here.
- Yeah.
Look! Look! They're arriving!
It's the Marseillaise Battalion from France.
We can see Papineau from Canada.
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
- Werner, you're getting this, right?
- Yeah.
Okay, let's go downstairs.
Coming?
Yeah.
Later, ladies.
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!
Gellhorn! Come on!
Wait! Wait up!
Papa, wait! Papa!
Right there!
Hey, look, they're showing your movie.
Not my movie.
- Oh, you didn't like it?
- Never saw it. Heard they loused it up.
I agree. I think they miscast
Helen Hayes as Catherine Barkley.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
Everyone's a critic.
Look, Werner. Look. All those people.
- Hey, Dos! Get over here!
- Right.
- Joris, come on.
- Say, "Cheese."
It's so great we're doing this,
Hem. It's gonna be a wonderful film.
Jesus. Irrigation.
Oh, what's wrong with irrigation?
Nothing, if you like watching guys dig ditches.
We do our job right, we make people want to watch.
Come on. There's a goddamn war to film.
This is why there's a goddamn war, Hem.
A year ago, these people were shot for stepping on this land.
It made you proud to see
the joy and determination of the Spanish people.
You looked, and you knew our cause was just
and we could not lose.
To rule this country,
Franco would have to do away with 20 million of those brave souls.
Tastes like freedom.
Dos, that may be the worst line you ever came up with, which is saying something.
Well, that may be, but it's true.
Now these people can irrigate their land and raise food for the defenders of Madrid.
- You're an idealist.
Who wants to irrigate when fascists have a boot on your neck?
- Uh...
How are our filmmakers today?
Paco!
Yes, he's here!
- It's Paco!
- Wait! That's Uncle Paco!
Paco! Paco!
This could be the best shot in the film!
There's fighting five kilometers from here.
Let's go!
That's where we should be!
Let's go, come on!
What are you waiting for, Russian?
Come with us!
- Get your clothes dirty!
- Hey, Dos! Coming?
- I know what fighting looks like.
I'm staying here.
No! Werner, get back!
Get down, get down, get down.
Up! Paco!
Let's get close.
What is that?
What? What is it?
Red dogs, your leaders have sent you here to die!
General Franco is willing to give his blood for you.
You trying to get us killed?
They see a reflection, they got a ripe target.
Surrender now!
- Take it till you get Paco!
- Surrender now!
Fascist bastards!
You told the bastards off.
Madrid is protected.
Yes, it is protected for today.
Are you okay?
Watercress.
I used to get the most unchristly indigestion.
With this, I can eat a truck tire wrapped in chili peppers and sleep like a baby.
Wild onions.
Locals say, "Eat two onions a day, you'll live to be 100."
What do the locals say about one's breath?
They say!
It is a taste one must acquire.
Oh!
Paco!
Paco, my friend!
Come! We must talk. Please.
Hey, it's okay. You leave him there.
We'll talk for two minutes.
We talk just for two minutes. We talk. Talk.
- Slide in.
- In the car? Why?
Okay, go.
So how'd you learn to have fun in hell?
Family vacations.
Oh, uh...
She says she has your coat.
My... No. No, no. Tell her she's...
This is not my coat.
She says it is your coat, and that's why she's giving it to you.
No, tell her... No, thank... No...
- Beautiful, but no, I can't accept...
- Then you must pay her something.
Pay her? I can't afford the coat!
- I can't afford! No, thank you.
She's simply asking if you like this coat of yours.
- I like it, yes. Beautiful. But not for me...
- Oh, for Christ's sakes! Don't you get it?
Look. There. Now...
Now, it is your coat, just as she said from the beginning.
There's a lot of bargains to be had in wartime, if you don't mind wearing the clothes of the dead.
Now can we go celebrate?
Hungarian, where is Sandor?
Oh, Sandor is gone.
- He will come back.
- No, he won't.
You never know when he will turn up.
And have the waiters say our nada. You art in nada.
Nada be thy nada.
Thy will be nada as it is in nada.
Give us this nada, our daily nada, nada, nada...
Hey, Dos! Do we bore you?
Paco should be here by now.
Oh, drink up, for Christ's sake, the man's invincible.
He probably just stepped off to seek relief from one of our hors de combat here.
Relax.
Even a Time magazine cover boy needs to drink with the lowlifes every once in a while.
Lay off, Hem.
There goes a truly wet blanket.
Do you speak English?
Have you seen Paco Zarra?
- Have you seen him today since...
Hey, Sidney.
Go get her.
This one's for you, Papa!
You were at the irrigation project today, right?
Yes, sir, I was.
Did you see Paco? He should be here by now.
I don't know.
Have you seen him recently?
- No?
- No, I haven't. I'm sorry.
Oh...
Just outside the hotel, this.
Look, even with bombs falling, her mother wanted to make sure she was wearing her best coat.
- Yes.
Except it's buttoned wrong. Look.
There wasn't time.
Yes, yes, yes.
You capture that human theme.
That need to do something, to...
To exert control even when your world is spinning out of control.
Yes. You understand.
I want to do what you do.
I do. I want to do it,
I want to write the way you take pictures.
Mmm.
There's so much going on in this war, so much.
And yet when I sit down, when I start to write, nothing.
Nothing. I can...
- So what's your secret? Tell me your secret.
- There is no secret.
The pictures are there, you just take them.
If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.
But you have the talent.
It is not enough to have talent.
You also have to be Hungarian.
I must you to know I am General Petrov.
I am a great admirer of you, figure of goddess, and it would be honor for you to...
...dance with me. No, come.
- Come.
- Dance? No, no. No.
You are a goddess.
Dance.
No, no. Come. Come, come. Now.
- Me?
- No, come. Come to dance with me now.
- Hey.
- Come, come, come.
Hey, back off, General Caviar, what the hell do you think you're doing here?
What I am doing here?
I am doing seduction of beautiful woman.
Come on, I'm not your property.
Say just the two of us step outside,
mi general?
We make duel.
I thought Russians had balls.
How about a little Russian roulette?
- Yeah?
Sidney, pistol!
- Oh, come on.
- Sidney!
This is madness, what are you doing?
- Ready?
- Wait!
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.
Go back to typewriter, journalist.
Please wait.
Please, as both of you are about to die, or one of you, either way, it will be regrettable, but one thing must be had first.
The honor of Russia is at stake.
Fuck Russia.
Vodka! Vodka.
Vodka. Vodka.
Made for Peter the Great.
Vodka. Vodka. Vodka. Vodka.
One last drink before you die.
One last. Just one. With caviar.
On real bread.
With music.
Simmer down, Papa.
Come on, we have a film to make.
Take it easy.
I think maybe, today we all learn something, each clay, we acquire an education.
The thing one comes to know about war are not so simple.
Did you say, "Fuck Russia"?
So what if I did?
- Well, I say fuck America!
My country is here.
Where is yours?
He's right, America should be here.
The whole world should be here.
The fascists are trampling Spain, and you two are comparing testicles.
It's ridiculous.
No.
We cooked the goat.
No, not Sandor!
No!
You eat!
How could that Hungarian do this?
- Oh!
- Sometimes sacrifice is an art.
Soon, disaster swung like a compass needle, aimlessly, all over the city.
Past the street barricades, the only sound you heard
was a machine gun hammering in the University city
and a bird.
It was a crazy war.
We could take a streetcar to the front.
Get this. Get that. Are you getting it?
Are we getting it?
Yeah, yeah. I lost the...
The front was only blocks away, it was very cold,
and the thuds of mortar shells were all around,
but we had a film to make.
- Set the camera here.
Get down!
- There's stray bullets everywhere.
Look at that.
Fucking grace under pressure.
- Hey, tú!
- Get down!
Get down!
I invited him to join us for a drink after work.
Francisco!
You sure taught them a lesson.
You lobbed grenades right onto their fascist asses.
Good. They deserve it.
Fascism is a lie told by bullies.
One day, Felipe here is a champion jai alai player, and the next, he's hurling grenades instead of pelotas.
Listen to Hemingway.
You'd think his side was winning the war.
There's atrocities on both sides.
The important thing is to report with objectivity.
Objectivity?
Fuck all your objectivity shit.
What got into her?
Hemingway, no doubt.
There's a cat?
That's no cat.
That's no cat. That's no cat!
Gellhorn!
Gellhorn!
Mama. Mama.
Mama.
Come On.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Mama!
Mama.
It's okay.
Are you fucking stupid?
You are not supposed to charge out in the middle of a shelling.
Little boys are not supposed to see their mothers bleed to death.
Sarita.
- No.
- Check the boy. Get him some water.
- I've got blood on my hands. I can't...
- Then, wash it off.
- Gellhorn.
Wash your hands.
More coming!
Bravest woman I ever saw.
Spying, Gellhorn?
No.
You're supposed to be a war correspondent.
So where's your correspondence?
What are you, just a fucking war tourist?
Um...
I...
I can't write. I can't...
I'm trying and I can't get anything.
I...
I feel like I don't know enough.
I don't know enough about the war and about...
About the military and about... I just...
I don't...
The only thing that really interests me is people and their lives, their daily lives, that's...
And I...
Who's going to be interested in that, really?
There's nothing to writing, Gellhorn.
All you do is sit down at your typewriter and bleed.
Mmm-hmm.
Do what you did in Appalachia, write about ordinary people, and war and Madrid.
No, I...
- It's just I...
- Fucking get in the ring, Gellhorn.
See what you're made of.
Start throwing some punches for what you believe in.
Fucking war correspondent.
So, what?
As the bombs fall, you know what the people in the square are thinking,
"I must get home."
Somehow, you do not believe you can get killed
when you are sitting in the comfort of home.
Gellhorn!
Gellhorn. Come on, we got to get out.
My God.
You have the most goddamn sexual legs.
Is this what you want?
It's what I need.
So, how did you get this?
Fell Off a ladder.
Mmm.
Skylight fell on me.
Really?
And your leg?
Italy. Mortar.
An Austrian Minenwerfer.
Three Italians with me had their legs blown off.
God, that must have been bad.
No, I was lucky, knee's still attached.
Kept a bowl by my bed for all the metal they took out.
Two hundred and twenty seven pieces.
They awarded me the Croce al Merito di Guerra with three citations.
And he's a hero, too.
I hate the hero words.
And "sacred," "glorious," "sacrifice."
Never saw a damn thing that was sacred.
Goddamn foot fungus.
What?
Bullfighters are plagued by it.
The great matador, Don Junero, gave me this amazing powder.
I think it was Don Junero.
You think?
The important thing for a writer is to tell a good story.
- So, is it true about the scars?
- Of course, it's true.
Let me tell you something else about writers.
The best ones are all liars.
It's hard to say exactly the moment you fall in love with someone.
But I knew with him the exact moment when I knew I had.
And I knew why.
In that instant, it was his words.
The ones I would never hear.
Whatever private thing he uttered.
Hemingway!
Hemingway!
Hemingway!
Have you seen Hemingway?
The hotel was being transformed
into a vast triage for the wounded.
And it still had all the old furniture, but it smelled, it smelled of ether.
And it was crowded with bandaged men.
Capa!
Have you seen Hemingway?
I know that voice.
- Brooklyn.
- Gellhorn.
I've been thinking about you, how are you?
How are you?
I'm... I'm fine.
- And you? How are you?
- I'm aces, now that you're here.
But the Hungarian.
Hey, where is he?
Hmm?
Ask me a different question.
Let me get you a drink.
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I want you to have this.
It'll make you lucky.
Hmm.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
Here.
Oh...
There's Papa.
I'll take care of him.
In the event that Madrid should fall...
Madrid will never fall.
In the event Madrid should fall, there should be no evidence of the extent of Russian intervention in Spain.
Why can't we film this?
Now, let me be direct.
Zarra's brother is a colonel with Franco.
It's a civil war. Brother fights brother.
In this instance, Moscow believe brother might not be fighting brother.
What, they think Paco is a spy?
I saw him kill half a dozen fascists in one afternoon.
Can you think of a better way to get anti-fascists to trust you?
And you believe this?
I'm afraid it does not matter what I believe.
Moscow is not comfortable with a leader whose brother sits at Franco's side.
Something may happen.
What kind of something?
Something about which nothing can be done.
But I promise you, he will get a fair trial.
Fair trial?
- A man knows his friends.
- In Spain,
Russians can be very good to know.
We control access to all brigades.
And?
Our comrade, Dos Paseos...
...is making it hard for Moscow to continue granting this.
Bullshit.
Dos may be a genius of an ass, but no one is more anti-fascist.
No one doubts the man's ideals,
I am talking about his behavior.
You cannot deny that Dos Paseos, you might say, is in love with Paco Zarra.
He hears a rumor about him, and suddenly he is everywhere, talking to people...
War runs on rumors.
Let me be even more direct.
If it appears that Paco Zarra is a spy, and if it appears that Dos Paseos, the man making this movie with you, is involved with a spy, then my hands are tied.
What the hell are you suggesting?
I am suggesting that you tell Dos Paseos that men should not be so emotional.
Tell him to act more like a man Hemingway would write about.
Hem, did he tell you anything about Paco?
Hem?
Two years later,
Koltsov was arrested
in a purge in Moscow and sentenced to death.
He truly believed in Stalin.
I sometimes wonder what he believed as Stalin's thugs were dragging him off
to put a bullet in his head.
Oh, Mr. Hemingway, how strong and how big you are!
Your writing is phony! It's pompous!
My writing pompous?
Your voice is pompous!
Damn faggot!
Don't you try to tell me how to write narration!
What do you know about real war?
Funny how a man has to prove himself manly, I wonder why?
Hemingway is right, your voice is too hammy, it's a disaster!
You overrated, ass-kissing narcissists!
Fuck that blowhard! I'll narrate it myself.
I like that idea, Hemingway. Let's try it.
Yeah, son also drinks a little too much out of war.
- Hello, Orson.
- Oh, John, I quit!
What?
What do you mean you quit?
This Spanish earth is hard and dry, and the faces of the men who work that earth are hard and dried from the sun.
This worthless land, with water, will yield much.
For 50 years, we've wanted to irrigate...
Ah, this is working! This is working.
This is much better.
Joris, what the hell's going on?
I just ran into Welles, he says he quit!
Quit? I fired his ass.
You what? You fired... He can't...
You don't know the first thing about narrating a film, Hem!
Fucking actors.
Turn the projector off, stop, stop.
Turn the lights on.
With Orson Welles narrating, it was too theatrical.
But with Hemingway, we now hear a natural voice, a real voice, a man who has actually been to Spain and wants to tell the world.
Trust me. This is working.
Okay.
Gellhorn, incoming bombs.
- Everybody else ready? Music.
- Projector.
Hemingway, you ready? And, action!
Before, death came when you were old or sick, but now it comes to all this village, high in the sky and shining silver.
It comes to all who have no place to run, no place to hide.
Three Junker planes did this.
This worthless land, with water, will yield much.
For 50 years, we've wanted to irrigate, but they've held us back.
Now, we will bring water to it, to raise food for the defenders of Madrid.
That was my line. Now it's Hem's?
Hey, wait, Joris.
Joris, where's the shot of Paco on horseback?
You said that was the best shot of the film.
Here it is. Oh, Paco!
Wait a second, what is this?
You've taken him out of the film entirely?
Shh!
He disappears in Spain and now you're gonna make sure he disappears forever?
For Christ's sake, Dos, calm down.
Cuts have to be made to make the film move better.
It's filmmaking, Dos.
There are aesthetic decisions.
Welles' voice wasn't right for our narration, and now he's telling you
Paco needs to be cut.
Paco is...
It's for balance, it's for the film's good.
Oh, for the film's good, or for Russia's good?
Don't insult me.
I risked my life to film this war.
Yes, and Paco risked his fighting it.
For God's sake, Hem, you don't do this to a friend.
Why is it, whenever I mention Paco...
What is it you're not telling me?
Something I don't think you'd have the stomach to hear.
Or it's something you don't have the stomach to say.
It's all right, Dos.
Nobody says a coward can't make a great writer.
You should go off and write.
We could use a new book by Dos Paseos.
After Spain,
Dos Paseos changed.
He never regretted his stand against Franco,
but because of what happened to Paco, his politics moved far to the right.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight the American Writers' Congress,
which is sponsored by the League of American Writers,
is proud to present the first motion picture of Spain's battlefront.
Directed by Joris Ivens,
and written by Ernest Hemingway in collaboration with John Dos Paseos.
We also have in attendance tonight
Archibald MacLeish, Donald Ogden Stuart...
There are people...
- Shut up. Shut up!
- What are you doing?
Ow! God, get off.
- Fuck.
- Fuck you!
- This is your fault.
- My fault?
You don't remember me shoving you up against a wall and trying to shove your hand into my knickers.
Cunt.
You want to emasculate me now, in front of the world?
Oh, I get it.
I get it now.
Hemingway has stage fright.
Is that it?
Okay.
This totally feels like horse hair.
And you, in this fucking fur coat.
Papa.
You're on.
You're gonna be fine.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
just back from the Spanish front,
my friend, my hero, Ernest Hemingway.
Papa, come on!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am a writer.
So, the last thing a writer should be asked to do is talk.
Excuse me.
Fascists may destroy cities,
but the earth will outlive all systems of tyranny.
For those who have entered the earth honorably,
and no men ever entered earth more honorably than those who died in Spain,
have already achieved immortality.
The film you are going to see is about such men.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Spanish Earth.
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen, just a minute.
I see we have a very special guest here,
a woman who has shared our adventures in Spain.
- A writer for Collier's magazine,
please give a warm welcome to Martha Gellhorn.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
people speak of the glory of battle,
the sweep of governments, the majesty of leaders,
but go into the ravaged towns and hold the hand of a starving, half-burned child,
and you will know differently.
My job,
our job,
is to give voice to the voiceless, to bear witness to the innocent
and to expose the lies that mask evil with glorious rhetoric.
- Right here, Papa.
- One more?
- Right here, right here, sir.
- Mr. Hemingway!
Appreciate it, sir.
- Papa! Papa!
- Got some good shots. Yes, sir.
- Wait here, Papa.
- One more before you go.
- Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Hemingway?
- Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
Good job. Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot, guys. That was good.
Get you guys back on the way out.
Thanks again, guys.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for coming.
- Absolutely.
- Thank you for your support.
Let me give you one of these pamphlets.
One for you here, sir, explaining everything about the cause in Spain.
Spain got my juices flowing, Max.
The work's good. I've got a great title.
That's what editors like to hear.
For Whom the Bell Tolls.
John Donne.
"Each man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind,"
"Therefore, ask not for whom the bell tolls,"
"it tolls for thee."
It's going to be his best novel.
Believe me, I've edited all of them.
Every time I think he can't get any better, he does.
It is the mark of a great writer.
Exactly. I know.
You should know.
I could say the same about your articles for Collier's.
Believe me, Scribner's is interested, if you ever want to write a book.
Really?
You can't filch her, Perkins.
I've got her locked up at Collier's.
Stories are so good, we want more.
Actually, you know, I wasn't sure that gals have the stuff to be war reporters.
Well, women get bombed the same as men.
Yeah, well, I want to get bombed right now.
Joris, Joris. Great film.
Narration's over the top, though.
Doing...
There he is.
- Critic!
- Let me give you a piece of...
Get over here.
Pardon me for a minute.
- Critic!
- Easy, Hem.
Easy? Nobody shits on your work.
I need another drink.
Hello, Hemingway.
Hello, Eastman. I was just...
Max.
I was just telling my friends here what you said about my book. Remember?
I don't believe I do.
"His talent's been outstripped by fear of his flagging masculinity."
Then you said,
"Come out from behind that false hair on your chest, Ernest."
"We all know you."
Well, you memorized it.
Oh, come on, Papa, you're not sore?
No. I just want to discuss it with you.
- See?
- Oh, God.
Do you see that?
That's what a man looks like.
My lord, you're serious.
Let's see what you got on your chest, you fucking nancy!
No, no. Hem! Hem!
Son of a bitch!
No, that's it. Move away. Come on.
I got a hairier chest than you, pal.
Hairier!
Hemingway! Hemingway!
Right here!
Papa! Right here, Papa!
Second-rate son of a bitch!
Don't you know adultery is a sin?
This is a Catholic home!
You are never getting a divorce.
I won't see you destroyed by some, some Gellhorn.
You told me you loved me so much, that love was all that mattered.
Your love is just something mounted on the wall.
Your love is... Doesn't...
Dirty little sex tricks you taught me that you probably learned from one of your whores!
Haven't I cared for you through your rages, and your jealousies and your meanness?
I told the world you were a genius.
I gave you all of this.
Oh, manly Hemingway. All of this!
All Of this!
To prove you're not a mama's boy.
Comparing your penis to F. Scott Fitzgerald, telling everyone that yours is bigger?
- I know the truth!
- Pauline!
What are you doing?
Take them out of here.
- Take them out of here!
- Whatever you say, Pauline.
- What's wrong with Mommy?
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
- What's the matter?
- Up to your room.
Do our boys mean nothing to you?
You think I'm going to let you leave me like you left Hadley?
This time, you're staying married.
You think that this Gellhorn cares about you?
She is using you!
She will not be your muse.
She will leave you a broken man.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Who wants a Papa Doble?
- Papa whose's?
- Papa Doble.
Two and a half jiggers
Bacardi White Label rum, juice of two limes, half a grapefruit, plus six drops of Maraschino.
You whir the whole mess with shaved ice in an electric mixer, and you're ready to rumba.
I invented the damn drink, and I own the house record in drinking them.
Seventeen.
- You're on, son.
- Count me in.
- Right.
- Double sawbuck to the winner.
- Spain.
- Spain!
- The death of fascism.
- Yeah!
Gellhorn's a real thoroughbred, but she's skittish in the stretch.
We'll see about that.
Mmm-hmm.
Nineteen.
I swear by Christ, you're more of a man than most men I've met.
Just say that I won.
- You didn't win.
- No, say it. Say it. I won.
We're taking a break. We'll call it a draw.
Draw, my ass, God damn it. I won!
I'm less body weight than you, so...
- Technically, I'm more alcohol than you are.
- Right, so now,
- there's algebra involved.
- So say I won.
Why can't you say I won?
- Say I won.
- Oh, yeah, I bet you're a sore winner, too.
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How much you got?
It's called Finca Vigía.
We can get it for next to nothing.
We can write here together.
What do you think? Isn't it perfect?
We'll have to give the guests machetes.
Who needs guests?
What do you think?
So can we stay?
I still can't believe it.
You never really know what you're fighting for until you lose.
After Spain,
I felt such despair for the human race.
I thought, "We're forever bitched."
Spain. Spain really broke my heart.
Nobody listened.
Nobody.
And the fascists won.
The fascists won.
You listen to me, Gellhorn.
A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.
If he's still standing, he can fight.
I'm writing to show the world what we were fighting for in Spain.
A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.
If he's still standing, he can fight.
What time is it?
It was high noon an hour ago.
Writing since 6:00.
Come on, Gellhorn.
Get up and bite on the nail.
Go away.
What are you trying to do, spook me?
Past five minutes, I've watched you.
I've watched you type pages and let them float into the wastebasket.
Never crumple pages.
Always let them float gently into the basket.
Any writer who rips out his stuff and crumples it will be insane in a year, guaranteed.
God, we went through two bottles of scotch, wine, absinthe, and yet you can get up in the morning at the crack of dawn and write.
Writing's like mass.
God gets mad if you don't show up.
Come on. You don't write on Sundays.
Yeah, but Sundays, there's real mass.
I still don't understand you and Catholicism.
Happened right after I married Pauline.
The moment I said, "I do,"
I was struck impotent.
Oh.
Nada. Señor Linguine.
She had me go to church. It worked.
I had my very own resurrection.
Hell, I would have French kissed
John the Baptist for a hard-on.
Oh, there's an image I will cherish.
After that, I figured I'd stay Catholic.
Why jinx things? Hey, no snooping.
Come on, muses always snoop.
What did you...
"Maybe today, we've all learned something.
Each day we acquire an education."
"The things one comes to know about war are not so simple."
That's what Koltsov said.
You...
So, this Karkov, he's based on Koltsov.
Who knows? Could be.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Do you?
I forgot one thing.
No.
You're dedicating that to me?
Gellhorn, you inspire the hell out of me.
Wait, no, no, wait.
I've got to talk to you about something.
- Not now. Done by noon...
- But I do!
- ...drunk by 3:00.
- I have to talk to you about something.
- Wait!
- That's my philosophy.
Oh!
Oh, God.
God!
Oh, God.
Life shouldn't be this perfect.
It really shouldn't.
It absolutely should.
A perfect moment.
But it's all still out there.
- What's all still out there?
- The world.
Collier's wants me to go to Finland.
- Marty.
- Mmm-hmm?
In this world, when you find a good place, you don't leave it.
I know.
But Stalin's expanding west now, the Russians are bombing civilians.
Oh, don't pretend you care about the Finns.
You just want a war all to yourself.
Well, you're the one who taught me.
Some wars are necessary, and it's necessary to bear witness.
God damn you. I'm writing a novel here.
Aren't you happy?
I adore you. I...
I absolutely adore you.
But innocent people are being blown up.
Someone has to go.
Someone has to write about this.
You mean someone has to leave.
I want to go.
I do.
I've gotta go. There's things that...
There's things I need to find out.
Perkins wants you to write a novel for Scribner's.
I don't want to write a novel.
Marty, stay here with me.
Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.
Marty.
Papa doesn't want you to go.
Don't "Papa" me.
Will you come with me?
Come with me.
War in the Arctic is a very remarkable thing.
The Finns joke that they don't believe
Russian propaganda,
but they believe Russian bombs.
Careful!
I saw a boy of nine, standing outside his burning home, watching the bombers.
He looked up at the sky with a stubborn, serious face.
He had held himself stiffly so as not to shrink from the noise.
Then he said, "Little by little,
I'm getting really angry."
I'll put my money on three million Finns against 180 million Russkies.
After all, they are fighting for their lives and their homes.
My dearest Marty, one thing you must know,
love is infinitely more durable than hate.
Last night, I howled at the moon, and some poor, wretched beast answered from the dark.
Maybe he has a Marty, too.
And so we howled together.
The animal, and the man whom love has made an animal.
Your book is what will last after us
and make that war intelligible.
Love, you poison my typewriter.
How can I write with every key screaming?
Since you left, I've had hangovers they could name battleships after.
Today I remember the heat of your naked skin.
I cannot wait to return to Cuba and wallow in sun and quiet, and above all,
I shall be glad to be home with you,
where I belong.
Beloved, I learned from you not to have the vanity
to think the planes were looking for me and all bullets had my name on them.
I'm tired, and I wish I were with you.
I am stinko, deadly lonely.
We must promise and pledge and swear out loud
to the love-drunk gods on high that we will never...
And let's never...
Leave each other again.
Never leave each other again.
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
You're home.
Oh, the maid quit.
I wonder why.
What, you go away for two months, then waltz back and bitch?
Come on.
Got something that will make you happy.
You look terrible.
I'm fine. Now.
I just spent two months in the Arctic missing you like hell, and I come home to a Tijuana whorehouse.
They don't look like this.
Well, you would know.
- How do you write those letters?
- It's notarized.
Oh, my... You got a divorce.
Thing had to be done, I did it.
What about Pauline?
It was bad.
I did it for us.
- Us? But I didn't ask...
- So we could get married.
I have a horror of marriage. You know that.
I'd rather sin respectably.
Well, I'd rather make an honest woman out of you.
So what do you think of that?
- Mr. Cooper, over here!
- Mrs. Hemingway!
- Hemingway!
- Mrs. Hemingway!
Bravo, Hemingway!
- Miss Dietrich! Miss Dietrich!
I have never been happier.
Uh-oh.
Last time you said that, you ended up in Finland.
What is it now?
What?
Chiang Kai Shek.
- China!
- Mmm-hmm.
Collier's has made me an offer.
Oh, Christ. Here she goes again.
My assignment is to show what Japan is really doing to innocent people in China.
And an interview with the world's most powerful couple.
- Well, that's us, isn't it?
- Come on, be serious.
Me be serious?
You love your wife, Jackson?
Some days.
Some days.
Man's a Plato.
So what do you say?
What do you have against China?
You know how filthy China is?
Come on.
You like filth. Hmm?
I had an uncle there. A medical missionary.
Had to take out his own appendix on horseback.
Oh, forget your uncle's appendix.
No one else is covering this.
This could be our war.
Oh, jeez. How many wars do you need?
Don't think of it as war.
Think of it as a paid honeymoon.
Our honeymoon. Come on.
- Don't you want a honeymoon?
- This is our honeymoon.
A real honeymoon. Real.
- Come on, Hemingway, please?
- Marty!
Say yes. Please.
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Gellhorn.
- A man can't let his wife go alone to China.
- No, he can't.
Especially if she's blonde.
That's right. It would be very dangerous.
- Who knows what would happen.
- Uh-huh.
Thank you.
I had been in Finnish cities during bombing attacks,
and Madrid was swept almost daily by artillery fire,
but China was in a class by itself.
As the Japanese destroyed, the Chinese residents repaired.
Endurance was the secret Chinese weapon.
The Japanese should have understood that,
and everyone else had better remember it.
She has, a whatchamacallit, bound feet.
Her feet were bound and she cannot walk.
The Japanese are bombing everything.
What is that?
- No...
- You must be careful.
- No, I hear...
Go no further.
There is nothing we can do for him.
This is off-limits.
Are you certain you want to go in here?
Yes, yes. I do, Mr. Ma.
Be cautious, madam.
No.
No, no, you must not use the water.
It's very bad. Very...
- Come on, we're celebrating.
For Whom the Bell Tolls is selling like ice cream in hell.
Clement said it's the finest book written this decade.
Maybe the whole goddamn century, eh?
Tell the one about Garbo's pants again.
- Hey, it's the Marty.
- It's very bad.
She washed her hands with the water.
She what?
You must want to suffer.
Mmm-hmm. I must. I'm in love with you.
Oh!
We must hurry, please.
I have gotten you a whatchamacallit, an interview with
Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek.
Madame Chiang, you look even better than you do on the cover of Time.
Thank you. You know what a bore it can be, posing for magazine covers.
The Generalissimo wishes to tell you communism is a disease of the heart.
The Japanese are a disease of the skin.
Beautifully put, Generalissimo.
Yes, the communists hamper our army against the Japanese invaders.
You must tell your friend, Roosevelt.
Oh, we will. You can count on it.
You must also tell him not to worry about Mao or Zhou Enlai.
These are the communist leaders.
So-called leaders, of course.
No one can replace the Generalissimo in the hearts of his people.
May I ask, Mrs. Hemingway, do you believe that war is men's business?
Oh.
Does it really matter?
In China, it seems like all of the businesses are run on slave labor.
I mean, the people...
The people are starving.
I, uh...
I met a little girl in an opium den today, and she was...
So many sights, and you visit an opium den?
Perhaps you enjoy opium? Mmm?
No. I never touch the stuff.
But I can see why your people do.
Your opinions are so interesting.
But I believe that we know what is best for our own people.
Chocolate?
No, thank you.
So is it best for children to be working in squalor?
And it's best for lepers to be on the street, begging?
That's so interesting.
If not civilized.
Civilized?
Your wife has a wonderful sense of humor.
She certainly does.
China was a great civilization when your ancestors were living in trees and painting themselves blue.
Which ancestors are they?
Apes or Gellhorns?
You will have this.
No, I couldn't take it.
I insist.
Well, thank you, it's lovely.
You see, we're not so uncivilized.
Some balls, Gellhorn, telling off the Empress of China in front of Chiang Kai Shek.
Oh, you don't think they'll invite us back?
We'll be lucky if they don't hang us.
What the hell got into you?
I just keep seeing that little girl in the opium den.
It upsets me.
They don't take care of their people.
Ugh! I need some calamine.
My hands, they're just...
You must stop scratching. It's very bad.
You have the whatchamacallit?
What's whatchamacallit?
China rot.
Too late for calamine.
You need...
You need some of this...
No, no, no. What is that?
Snake urine and bat whatchamacallit...
- Come on.
- Yes.
This will work.
Stop scratching. Put this on.
Right away.
Ugh.
There you go.
Ugh!
Now, you need some gloves.
Ah! Here.
These are the best.
Motorman's gloves.
Enjoying your honeymoon?
- Go to hell.
- Already there, dear.
Should we go and scare up some of that snake hooch?
Yes, sir.
Gellhorn.
Zhou Enlai wants to meet you and Hemingway.
Make sure you're not followed.
Just walk. We'll find you.
But hurry.
You see that woman?
What woman?
Damn it, she disappeared. She...
She said that Zhou Enlai wants to meet us.
Who is he again?
Well, he's the big commie that Madame Chiang said not to worry about.
Which means she is worried.
Hmm. I like him already.
We'll have to ditch you know who.
Mr. Ma?
She said to just keep walking and they will find us.
Quick.
Come.
Please. Get in.
Put these blindfolds on.
Why the hell Will We do that?
Zhou has many enemies.
Better you don't know how to find him.
Well, this should be fun.
How fast can they pull these things?
Depends who's chasing them.
This is some fucking honeymoon, Gellhorn.
Black flag. What does that mean?
It means there's cholera there.
Cholera?
We're headed ashore.
A line of men, like dark, straining statues,
pulled the towrope with their sampan
and slowly moved the heavy barge forward.
They chanted to time their effort.
And the sound came as a rising and falling wave across the water.
You may remove the blindfolds.
I'm Zhou.
Zhou Enlai.
The one you're not supposed to worry about.
Hello, Zhou.
- I'm Gellhorn.
- Hemingway.
A drink.
To Hemingway and Gellhorn.
Oh!
I believe where you come from, it is called moonshine.
Where I come from, it's called gasoline.
I admired A Farewell to Arms.
You understand the real heart of war.
The movie, however...
- You saw the movie?
- Yes.
But I'm sorry.
Helen Hayes was not Catherine Barkley.
Don't blame me. Okay?
When it comes to Hollywood,
I drive to the border, toss the book over with one hand, then grab the cash with the other.
Sounds very glamorous.
Not as glamorous as an underground communist leader up against the Generalissimo.
Oh, yes.
I live simply
'cause my people live simply.
Most of us do not have chocolates.
It's not often Chiang removes his teeth for guests.
You have excellent intelligence.
Ah, Gellhorn. I see you have one of Madame's jade brooches.
Oh, she was very insistent.
Did she mention they are made by blind children?
The Chiangs own the factory.
My wife thinks that
Madame had Chiang castrated.
Your wife knows a lot about castration?
Wouldn't surprise me.
Castration is an elective at Bryn Mawr.
My friends in America tell me you know Eleanor Roosevelt.
Mmm-hmm. Quite well.
Brilliant woman.
Inform her the Generalissimo is the past.
A communist victory is inevitable.
I wish we had more time to talk, but unfortunately, I have a country
I must defend against the Japanese invaders.
Take care.
So, how do we get back from here?
Mr. Ma.
So, whose side are you on?
There are no sides.
There's only the past and the future.
Now, you must wait here.
When it is safe, we will come to get you.
Zhou's a winner, don't you think?
Oh, he's entrancing.
I mean, he's...
I mean... intoxicating.
I mean, if he asked me to follow him,
I would follow him...
What, you sit here on our so-called honeymoon and tell me you want to run off with Zhou fucking Enlai?
I thought you liked him.
I like a lot of guys.
I was just musing.
Musing? A wife doesn't muse about fucking other men.
Fucking?
Who was ever talking about fucking?
I'm talking about a charismatic leader, someone who's intoxicating.
Well, why do you have to make it about fucking?
Fucking?
I don't want to fuck him.
Ugh.
I'd love to interview the person who made this stuff.
Oh, Little Miss Human Interest.
- Don't you want to be careful, or you might lose the sweep of history with all your people stories.
History is people.
You should get out of the bar more.
- I like bars, I met you in one.
- Mmm-hmm.
Well, I like to get my stories firsthand.
Well, this one you got on both hands.
Zhou fucking Enlai.
It had been scandalous selfishness on my part.
In that moment, I wanted to praise him
for his generosity and letting me drag him to China.
His forbearance for not murdering me,
even his awful jokes.
I wanted to let him know that
I grieved for his time wasted
on a season in hell.
Thank you...
- Take your filthy hands off me!
You're the biggest asshole!
You are!
Where are we?
In a fucking cave.
Somewhere in China.
We told Mrs. Roosevelt
all that we had seen, and she was very sympathetic.
And she encouraged us to speak to the President and the State Department.
We spoke to the State Department.
We said Zhou Enlai was the man to watch.
We told them the communists would win.
Imagine that.
Communist China.
For that, we were branded fellow travelers.
I thought it was funny.
But Hem didn't like it.
He didn't want the government thinking he was a pinko.
I believe it made him extra patriotic.
Right on target.
He stopped writing,
and he spent all of his time with his cronies on the Pilar,
hunting for U-boats.
People say that jealousy is the greatest enemy of love.
They're wrong.
The greatest enemy of love
is boredom.
Colebaugh. It's Gellhorn.
I wanted to be where the real action was.
Why do you think?
There's going to be an invasion in Europe.
I want to cover it for Collier's.
That's Hem and his buddies playing war.
They managed to get the Pilar designated an official Q-boat for destroying German submarines.
I am not going to write a piece on Hem's hunt for German submarines in the Caribbean.
Because it's ludicrous.
That's why.
In six months, he hasn't found so much as a floating sauerbraten.
That's a damn cat.
They multiply hourly down here.
I know how the army feels about female correspondents, but, I mean, come on.
I'm battle-tested.
I'm different.
Come on, Charlie.
You got to help me out here.
But you told me that Collier's loves my stuff on Finland and China.
You'll get back to me?
Damn.
- You had their balls cut off?
- I did.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What? Me?
- Wait a second. Whose balls got cut off?
- The cats.
She had them de-cojone-d!
No! What'll they do at night?
One thing they're not going to do is spray my clothes.
Everything I own stinks!
Stinks of cat stink!
You're obsessive, you know that?
You're obsessive about being filthy!
Yeah, well, men aren't tulips!
Please. A grown man playing war?
Nobody here is playing.
Felipe here can throw a grenade down the hatch of a sub the second they open up.
I am performing a service for my country here!
How patriotic. A nonstop, rum-running party.
For God's sake, Hem.
German submarines in Cuba?
You wouldn't put that in a bad novel.
What novel are you calling bad?
- Here we go.
- For your information, not a single U-boat has made it through.
Fine. Fine.
You keep America safe for democracy.
I am going.
That woman loves humanity, but can't stand people!
I always said that, didn't I?
- You did.
- I did.
Gellhorn!
Papa, forget about her!
- Gellhorn!
- Papa!
Don't you walk away from me!
You berated me in front of your friends.
You've become a braggart, and it's not attractive.
What the hell do you need from me?
I don't need anything from you!
There's going to be an Allied invasion.
- I need to be there.
- Oh, that's right.
Run off whenever there's a cause.
We have an obligation, don't we? As writers.
What happened to your conscience?
You know what? You're giving it back to me.
I'm so inspired.
I'm going to be flying over in a week.
I have secured a position.
Well, that's fantastic.
So we're going together.
What?
What?
- What is it?
- Congratulate me, darling.
I'm going to be the correspondent for Collier's.
For Collier's?
No, come on. This is a joke. You...
You know they can only take one correspondent.
It's dog-eat-dog out there.
Oh, my God.
You could have signed anywhere.
You took my job.
You took my job at Collier's?
I know. I got some hefty shoes to fill.
You've done some excellent work.
Are you trying to make it impossible for me to love you?
Oh, come on, sport.
I could be killed over there.
That'd make you happy, wouldn't it?
I don't even...
You asshole!
Jesus.
This is...
So, how are you flying over?
- Government transport.
- Really? Okay.
Get me a seat on the plane.
It's the least you could do.
No can do.
Men only. Military.
Why?
Hem, why?
So Dos Paseos was right.
What was that priss ever right about?
Oh, about you, mostly.
He said you were a self-serving, selfish bastard.
- You didn't need to do that.
- Yes, I did.
You know a hell of a lot, but what you don't know is how much I did need to do that.
You get back here.
Fuck you.
Gellhorn!
Gellhorn!
Oh, God.
Waste of time.
They'll still be reading me long after you've been eaten by worms!
Fuck you!
Eaten by worms!
There was talk everywhere that the invasion was going to happen.
And my problem, with no connections,
was how to be there when it did.
Hey, where are you going? Where you going?
Oh, I'm doing a story on nurses for Collier's.
Good luck, blondie. Go.
So I stowed away
on a hospital ship.
People will be writing about this sight for 100 years,
and whoever saw it will never forget it.
After the first shock of wonder and admiration,
one began to look around and see separate details.
A gun flash, a distant war.
Barrage balloons,
like comic toy elephants, bounced in the high wind.
And invisible planes droned behind the gray ceiling of cloud.
Troops were unloading from big ships.
On the shore, moving up four brown roads that scarred the hillside are tanks
clanked slowly and steadily forward.
We waded ashore having agreed that we would assemble the wounded.
Everyone was violently busy on that crowded, dangerous shore.
The dust that rose seemed like the fog of war itself.
There was the terrible feeling of working against time.
There were wounded who groaned in their sleep or called out.
"And there was the soft steady hum of conversation among the wounded who could not sleep."
"Stop."
"It was a ship carrying a load of pain."
"But we were together."
"And we counted on each other."
"Stop."
Ernest, are you all right?
Yeah, of course I'm okay.
- What did you say your name was again?
Mary.
Mary Welsh.
I can tell you're my kind of girl.
What kind of girl is that?
The kind that takes care of a man.
Looks after him.
Keeps him going.
I like that.
I could do that.
Yeah?
That's lovely.
It's Italian, isn't it?
Mrs. Hemingway!
Mrs. Hemingway?
Mrs. Hemingway!
Are you Mrs. Ernest Hemingway?
Why?
And that, children, is the best way to handle a knife-wielding Chinese!
Ernest is a great storyteller.
Oh, my God. It's the Marty.
First journalist on the beach at Normandy.
Though she's not really accredited.
No home and hearth for my wife.
She'd rather be married to war, isn't that right, Intrepid?
I heard you had an accident.
A scratch.
Obviously hasn't affected your personality.
Unless you came to gloat, why did you come?
I don't know.
I guess...
Guess I just came by for a divorce.
Marty.
- Papa, what are you doing?
- Marty!
Look what that bitch has done to him.
Marty!
Gellhorn!
Sir, you're bleeding.
Gellhorn!
Marty, it's me.
Go away.
Marty, open the door.
No, I'm not letting you in.
You're plastered. Go away.
Marty!
I told you I want a divorce.
Open up, Mrs. Hemingway.
Mr. Hemingway loves you.
Oh, my God. Look at you.
You're the queen of heaven.
It's too late.
No.
Marty.
Give me a chance.
I deserve a chance.
Come on.
If we get divorced in Cuba, then we don't have to wait.
Always up on the local customs.
Fucking journalist.
Fucking bitch!
I gave you everything!
Gellhorn!
I made you!
- I made you!
It's over. It's enough!
Go away.
Please go away.
Bitch.
God.
We were good in war.
And when there was no war,
we made our own.
The battlefield neither of us could survive was domestic life.
I try not to think about him
since I fear I cannot think about him with kindness,
but only with dread.
God, how I hope the problems of my own tiny life don't
blind me to everything.
There were two things that most affected my view of the world.
One.
One was the defeat of Spain.
And the other...
...was Dachau.
And Dachau was minor compared to Auschwitz.
It was an unbelievable horror.
A thing so horrendous that you could not take it all in
without becoming frenzied and hysterical and mad.
I fled.
I spent the night weeping,
and I think I lost faith in this whole wretched human race.
- Feels like a big one.
What are you doing, Papa?
Papa?
Papa!
Papa!
Pull it in, Papa!
Papa!
Papa! Papa!
Do you remember that song?
The song we used to sing?
It just came to me.
Aren't you glad I moved us out here, away from those bars?
When I think of how you used to carry on...
There you go.
You need your peace and quiet.
We need to focus on keeping Papa healthy.
Writing, at its best, is a lonely life.
As a writer grows in public stature,
he sheds his loneliness,
and often his work deteriorates,
for he does his work alone.
And if he's a good enough writer,
he must face eternity, or the lack of it,
each day.
Miss Gellhorn?
You are considered to be one of the greatest war correspondents of all time.
For the past 45 years, you've covered conflicts everywhere.
Burma, Singapore, the Middle East,
Central America,
Vietnam, Africa, Bosnia, on and on.
And for a woman to have done all this...
Were you trying to put yourself in danger?
I don't have those complexes.
That's something men do.
Yes. Men.
Well, since you mentioned men...
Well, we're both journalists,
I'm sure you'll understand.
Our viewers would like to know more about your relationship with the man who was most synonymous with masculinity.
No.
Something about your debt?
My debt?
Your debt to Hemingway?
Hmm...
The man has been dead for 30 years.
He tortured no one so much as he tortured himself.
I wish him peace.
That's all I have to say on the subject.
I do not see myself as a footnote to someone else's life.
Turn it off.
We're done.
Thank you, Miss Gellhorn, for your time.
My dearest Marty,
one thing you must know,
love is infinitely more durable than hate.
God damn it.
It's Gellhorn.
I've decided to go after all.
Why? Because, as usual,
The Times got it wrong again.
Mmm-hmm.
All that drivel, all that goddamn objectivity shit.
I'm going to be on the next plane.
No. Well, God damn it,
I'll pay on my own dime.
I can't wait for you to grow a pair of balls.
You relax.
No.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I love you, too.
I'm not dead yet, you fuck.

DIFFERENT MAN: OK.
GOOD. GO.

MAN: Good. Here we go.

MAN ON VIDEO: There. Yeah.
What is this?
INTERVIEWER:
He's wearing a button that says "back
to mono."
MAN ON VIDEO:
"Back to mono."
Yeah. All right.
"The wall of sound."
All it is is, it's reverb.
You cook it down.
You mix it down time and again.
Oh, that reverb--what it is is, it's mud. It's--
Good morning, Maggie.
Hello.
Excuse me. Could I have a glass of water, please?
WOMAN: Of course.
Thank you.
MAN ON VIDEO:
He has us in there--
40 musicians,
20 hours a day,
working on one note-- one note...
until it's perfect.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. {Laughs}
Not at all.
Not at all.
WOMAN: Excuse me.
Here you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
INTERVIEWER:
Wasn't much of a singer, but..
MAN ON VIDEO: OK.
{Laughs}
Linda!
Where's she staying?
Someone!
Get her bags to the hotel!
Get her installed. whatever she needs!
MAGGIE: New York's on the phone.
About what?
MAGGIE: Your television show.
Television show-- it can wait.
The gun, the blood spatter,
that whole wall.
Lana Clarkson, suicide threats, depression--James,
you know what I'm looking for.
Did they feed you on the plane?
What do you think
I am--crazy?
Get her something to eat.
I don't need anything to eat.
I need a doctor.
Nick Stavros,
RPI--
Linda Kenney Baden.
Hi. I won't touch you.
I'm very sick.
I need the case laws on televised,
federal and California.
Grounds for exception, grounds for appeal.
At least we can slow them down.
Linda!
Could you get me a cup of tea, please?
Here's the part never cut in.
Raw footage.
MAN: Phil Spector interview.
Roll 28.
That was fantastic.
Some wonderful material.
I'm so grateful to you.
Oh, thank you.
INTERVIEWER:
Excellent.
Who is the girl in the picture?
MAN IN VIDEO:
I don't know her name.
INTERVIEWER:
Phil didn't, either.
Phil--he can attract a girl?
Why not?
He can attract a girl.
He can get her to his house.
Afterwards, he's on his track.
How can he keep her there?
You tell me.
With a gun.
He thinks he has to have a gun..
INTERVIEWER: I think we've covered just about everything.
Ah.
INTERVIEWER:
Some questions at...
OK. All right, all right.
Linda, please.
Come on. We've got
3 days' worth to do in half an hour.
MAN ON VIDEO:
..how far this goes back.
To the desert.
to the moors...
Thank you for coming.
You said that.
"Telegraph," London, fax to Phil.
Day of the shooting.
"Lost genius of rock 'n' roll".
Yeah, I know about the article.
What you don't know-- read the article--
he's been cold sober for 10 years.
Cold sober.
That night,
House of Blues
and Lana Clarkson.
Uh-huh.
Article sets him off.
Hmm. That's a shame.
It sets him off.
Yes, but how does that help your case?
My case, in court tomorrow, all right?
How does it help your case that he's nuts and he's drunk?
He still put the gun in the girl's mouth.
We've got right there...
Yeah, I read that.
Maggie, play her the fucking audiotape,
First officers?
I read it.
I want you to hear it.
Phil and the first officers.
Let's go.
Uh.
PHIL: This piece of shit!
I don't know what the fucking problem was,
but she certainly had no right
to come to my fucking castle and blow her fucking head open!
I don't see the case.
No? He's drunk.
He's enraged.
He mouths off to the cops.
Why is he enraged?
You heard it.
Is that a man who just shot somebody?
That's hearsay. They'll never allow it into court.
"The People vs. Cruz".
James?
"The People vs. Lou."
He put the gun in the girl's mouth...
No.
He pulled the trigger.
Where's the blood?
Where's the massive blood spatter?
I don't know where the massive blood spatter is.
This is my vacation in Venice--
first-class tickets,
5-star hotel.
You know, we have a meeting with him tonight.
Not me.
You're here.
Why are you here?
I do it for a living.
I'm listening.
62 grand worth of a vacation.
My hourly rate, out of the office, door to door,
24 hours a day.
30 grand on top, and I'll give you 3 days,
if that's any use to you.
Thank you.
So is that any use to you?
You give me your assessment.
And you put back my vacation
and you pay for it.
Stop negotiating.
And I need a shot.
Will you find me a doctor?
James!
James, drive her to the hotel.
A doctor when she gets there.
You walk her to the room.
LINDA: Other side have those outtakes?
Not yet.
They're filing to admit the testimony of 5 women...
Yeah, I read the
Grand Jury testimony.
This is gonna be your office.
Oh, 5 women.
Count them.
5 women on oath before the Grand
Jury.
"He pulled a gun on me.
He wanted sex."
Cold sober for 10 years, and now he's just getting--
Well, so what, Bruce?
You ever hear the phrase
"To hell with it?"
You've got a gun nut.
He goes around waving loaded guns.
You've got 5 women come out of the woodwork--
"He did the same thing to me."
You've got the chauffeur.
The chauffeur is on record--
"My boss came out:
I think I just killed somebody."
Well, exclude the woman.
How? On EWOL?
You bet.
No, I say the judge allows it under Caitlyn.
In which case it's reversible.
I'm doing a TV show.
Really? About the case?
No, independent of the case.
Oh, great.
Now, the chauffeur.
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, he shot the girl.
He shot the girl, all right?
He's a freak.
Those are the public who don't hate him.
He's a genius.
He transformed the entire music industry.
What's that--what's that kid's name--James?
James. James?
I'm Linda Kenney
Baden.
Could you tell me what this is?
I'll give you a dollar if you can tell me.
Is it something to do with music?
Why would you say that?
Because the case has to do with music.
No, no, no.
The case has nothing to do with music.
No. This is an insert that allows a 45 RPM record to be played
on an LP phonograph, OK?
Now...
OK.
What is this?
Something to do with an early computer.
Mmm.
Put it on your key chain.
It's a piece of the past.
Mmm.
This kid doesn't know what a phonograph is,
a 45, a--a transistor radio.
Nobody on the jury is gonna know anything except your guy's
a murderer and a freak.
The girl killed herself.
Well, maybe, but
I don't want to take that case.
There...
I don't like that case.
There is no evidence.
There's no blood spatter on his cuff.
Well, you've got-- as to the blood spatter--
There is no blood spatter on the back wall. Why?
Why?
Linda, the bullet lodged in the skull.
The skull was intact.
All the blood in the brain matter had to come
out of the mouth toward him.
Exact model of the coat he wore.
Exact model.
Blood spatter?
You find it. Go ahead.
It's more than a pinpoint, Bruce.
I read the report.
It's more than one, and--
And it is inconsistent with anything but a defensive--
Bruce...
a defensive movement. and the angle of the shot is inconsistent.
The only way he walks--
I think he's not guilty.
Of course you do.
The only way, however, that he walks is what?
She shot herself.
That's right. Why?
She was depressed.
We have a history of e-mails, comments...
They let O.J. go.
They let Michael
Jackson go.
They are not gonna let him go.
They will be trying him for the murder of
O.J.'s wife,
and they will find him guilty.
Put on the tape.
The girl was crazy,
Linda.
She made this tape to promote herself as an actress.
Go ahead.
LANA: Dead Broke Tower, the one and only...
LINDA: I need some groceries at the hotel, please.
LANA: Little Richard.
Richard, which do you prefer?
"Little" or "Richard"?
Folks just call me whatever it is that
jumps in their head at that moment,
then come out with it.
There was this one man at a club I was playing
down in Memphis, my house at one time.
And I'd like to thank you, Dizzy,
for having me on the show.
Well, Dizzy, follow me?
Yes, Richard,
I do.
Your car is here.
Well, its...
Thanks.
Dilly.
"Richard" or "Little,"
whichever you prefer.
Tell us, Las Vegas, what we...
LINDA: The girl,
Bruce--you show that in the courtroom,
what do you get?
You get sympathy.
Your only realpolitik,
your only shot is to attack the girl,
and that's a loser because the jury turns away from you
like that.
OK.
I got a guy... sure looks guilty.
You tell me, what do I do?
LANA: Sex symbol...
He changed the tune as he came to me.
He's entitled to a defense.
What would you tell your students?
Would you say,
"Don't take the case if it offends
your sensibilities,"
or is he presumed innocent?
Because you're screwed up,
because you read the same gossip everybody else did,
so you think he's guilty.
All right, they think he's guilty.
What are you going to do about it?
I won't attack the girl.
Oh, yeah.
Gonna happen.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah.
Yeah.
{Linda coughs}
BRUCE: Linda!
Linda!
I can't try the case
I wish I had, the defendant I wish I had,
and I inherited the jury.
In a locked room, he shot the girl.
What can I do to defend him?
He's got cancer,
Linda.
You don't go to a dermatologist.
You got cancer, you come to me.
Now, what is my case?
MAGGIE: Bruce, New York's on the phone.
It's urgent.
I won't attack the girl.
Then you tell me.
JAMES: The doctor will meet us at the hotel.
{Elevator bell rings}
Thank you.
{Maggie clears throat}
{Sigh}
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{Elevator door closes}
MAN: The guns were about the girls.
This guy, his feet size is zero.
I mean, he couldn't get laid in a whorehouse
with a money machine.
Now--now he's the starmaker.
He's fucking the Ronettes,
Darlene Love, Cher...
Who the fuck knows who he's fucking--Angela Lansbury.
I don't know.
Now look. His power is starting to wane.
Do you think he's gonna give that up?
He's following
Ronnie around.
She goes for a cup of coffee,
he's got 3 private detectives on her trail.
INTERVIEWER:
Mm-hmm.
The whole thing was about,
"How do I keep these broads?"
But he didn't want to keep them.
That's true.
Why?
Ha.
He didn't know what love was.
He knew what pussy was,
and that's as close as he came.
INTERVIEWER: What's your favorite of all the things
that you mixed in those days?
MAN ON VIDEO: Well,
I mean, "River Deep,
Mountain High."
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
MAN ON VIDEO:
That was the anthem.
INTERVIEWER:
Fantastic. Yeah.
MAN ON VIDEO: Probably one of the greatest recordings ever made.
At least, that's what Phil would say.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
So I suppose you guys were editing
everything with a razor?
MAN ON VIDEO: Well, it was the old days.
You know, you got to clip everything, and it was mono,
so you know.
INTERVIEWER:
Quarter-inch tape?
MAN ON VIDEO: Quarter-inch tape, reel to reel,
8 track, live sound.
It was more realistic to be live than there was mono.
{Linda coughs}
I've always wanted to know...
{Linda coughs}
what's the difference between rich...

His father.
He says his father shot himself when he was 5,
but Philip was 5 in 1944.
He didn't shoot himself when he was 5.
He killed himself when Phil was 10--1949.
How? With a gun?
Uh-uh.
Took the gas pipe, went into the garage,
turned the car on.
Mmm.
You ever meet him?
No, ma'am.
I'm Linda. Please.

{Police sirens}
Here we go.

MAN: Mr. Spector prefers you to walk.
Just the woman.
Just the woman.
It's OK.

MAN: 抖 Anybody here seen my old friend
Abraham 抖
抖 And can you tell me where he's gone? 抖
"Abraham, Martin, and John," 1968,
and then they threw in Bobby--
Bobby Kennedy.
Now, we know Lincoln freed the slaves,
Dr. King fought for equality,
John...
screw the Nazi spy and anything else
that would hold still for 10 minutes.
What the hell did Bobby do?
He fucked with the Teamsters.
Get over here.
Now, if you look at the dates, "Abraham,
Martin, and John"
was recorded June 2,
1968.
That's 3 days before they shot Bobby.
They went back, chucked him in as garnish.
Traiga bebidas a la sala de m煤sica, por favor!
WOMAN: S铆, se帽or.
Here.
Now, Teddy--Teddy
Kennedy drowns a girl
on Martha's
Vineyard.
Walks away from the scene of the crime--
hid under a blanket
72 hours...
a teenage girl who he had befriended...
Drowns her in a
Volkswagen--300 million
Americans, nobody says
"Boo."
And P.S.--Teddy
Kennedy, what in the world
had he ever accomplished?
His family tossed him the bone.
"Oh, you can't get your masseuse license?
"Here, sit in the Senate
40 years.
Have fun."
A girl shoots herself in my house,
and that is the legacy my children will live with.
Come on in.
If I go in there, will you keep me there by force?
Here we go.
So where's Bruce?
Bruce had to go back to New York.
Ah...
Ooh.
He went back to New York.
God, you keep it cold in here.
No, I need it cold.
You know why I like
Bruce?
Why?
He got John Gotti off.
Stone killer,
Mafia chief,
Bruce walked him out of court, guilty as
Errol Flynn.
Oh, you are cold.
Mmm.
Come on.
We'll warm you up.
Here. Here you go.
PHIL: You know,
I always wanted to get out of all of this.
You know?
Lawrence de Arabia-- he got out.
You know?
I wanted to be an interpreter in the United Nations.
People scoffed at that, but...
it's a matter of record.
I always spoke
Spanish.
You'll find it in my love of the Latino beat,
in my songs.
After the Beatles, there was still a lot to do.
I didn't want to do it.
Just didn't want to do it.
You didn't want to do it? Why?
I'd done it.
What more was there left for me to do?
What?
The girls, the money, the fame. No.
You know,
I thought I'd move to Belize.
Is that a fantasy?
Everything I've done in my life has been a fantasy.
I made it happen.
I couldn't keep you here by force
because they took all my guns.
抖
You know, it never escaped me that people thought,
or were taught to think, that I was a clown
or freak of some sort
and that my accomplishments were somehow not to be admired.
But in their breadth of number, the sign of a freak.
But I understand.
It's called "envy."
I believe it's even mentioned in the Bible.
Extraordinary accomplishments, Linda,
transforms the grateful into an audience
and the envious, Linda, into a mob.
You watch.
See if I'm not right.
It stems from a feeling of inadequacy
which is a lack of courage.
Yeah, I understand.
I had it, too, but
I dealt with it by doing something.
You know?
What was I to do?
Did I tear anybody down?
No.
They were no threat to me.
I was too busy.
It's pretty, eh?
Hmm.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Why do you have so many guns?
I might need one.
Why would you need more than one?
I don't know.
How many pairs of shoes do you have?
Mmm.
How many feet?
But they're gone.
And I'm not going to shoot you, so why don't we sit down?
LINDA: Mmm. Thank you.
So how do you feel about guns?
How do you feel about them?
I can take them or leave them.
Yeah, but if you leave them and somebody pulls one on you,
well, there you are--
Anybody ever pull a gun on you?
You think I shot the girl, Linda?
Hmm.
You're smart.
High praise, indeed.
You think I shot the girl?
Your chauffer is on record.
"My boss came out.
I think I just killed somebody."
{Telephone beeps}
Tomorrow's "Times,"
today's "Times," you're quoted
as denouncing "the
Hitler-like D.A.
and his storm trooper henchmen."
Do you let people screw with you?
That's the white piano.
That's where John wrote
"Imagine."
Lenny, Lenny Bruce, he would sit here at the end,
talking about the fourth amendment.
That's how nuts they had him at the end.
Shooting smack, talking about the commerce clause.
Wisest man
I ever met.
There's John,
John Lennon, clubbed up with his wife at
the Dakota, prior to which he was living in 2 1/2 rooms in the East Village,
head shaved, hadn't bathed in a year and a half.
This genius.
What's this?
Thank you, Vernon.
PHIL: Do we know him?
As your attorney,
I must counsel you not,
whatever the provocation, not to talk to anyone.
They're indicting me for murder.
All right, sorry.
"You--You Lost That
Loving Feeling".
What was it?
Are you kidding me?
What was it?
It was--it was the greatest song ever released.
I sold over 2.5 million copies.
You say the Jews invented the music business.
The Jews didn't invent the music business.
I invented the music business.
7th Avenue, New York, there's a statue,
a little old
Jewish guy, yarmulke,
bent over a sewing machine.
He's that guy who invented ready to wear.
I invented the music business.
Where's the statue of me?
Where's the
Presidential Medal?
抖
Sidney Poitier broke the color barrier?
Are you kidding me?
He was playing Superman.
You want to know who he was?
He was an uptight frightened white guy's version
of a black man.
I put the Ronettes in their home.
I put black America in the white home.
The first time you got felt up, the first time
you got somebody's hand on you--guess what.
You were listening to one of my songs.
Did you kill that girl?
I thought attorneys never ask that question.
I'm the Christmas help.
I'm going home.
Ah.
"I think I just killed somebody."
My chauffeur at the time barely spoke English.
I came out, having seen what I saw,
and I said, "I think
I should call somebody."
Is that true,
Philip?
That's what my mother used to call me.
Did you shoot her?
Lana Clarkson?
Listen. Listen.
Come.
Let me tell you about
Lana Clarkson.
All her life, all she wanted
was this thing.
It was a drug.
She thought it was called "fame,"
and to put here in here, in Hollywood, with this drug all around,
why don't you put a diabetic in a chocolate shop?
Why don't you hire a recovering coke-head
to work in a meth lab?
Did Hollywood kill Marilyn?
She killed herself with help from an unfulfillable longing.
Or maybe she just got drunk and lost count of the pills.
Did you ever do that?
Lana Clarkson, at her death, had more prescription
pharmaceuticals in her than Walgreen's.
No, no.
The toxicology screens showed she had only--
Bullshit. Bullshit!
I looked in her eyes!
She had the equivalent of two Vicodin and some antihistamine.
Come on, the prosecution--
do you think I don't know a hophead when I see one?
.14.
All right, that's it.
She was gone.
Please.
Please.
I can't go on about that stuff.
I'm done.
Gonna wear that cross tomorrow?
It's a Mayan artifact.
I have a question, Linda.
If Jesus was so big, why did they kill him?
Because he was the son of God.
No!
Because he was still the son of God.
"Still" is not news.
Somebody is "still" the greatest beauty, actor,
record producer-- you can't put that in the paper.
What is news, then?
News is that he likes little boys,
that he's a thief, that he cheats on his wife.
Or in the absence of any fault, that he's just
too goddamn big for his fucking britches,
which is why they killed Christ.
See this here?
"You Lost That Loving
Feeling", this was--
this was the best song ever released.
They told me it was too long.
Came in at 4 minutes and 5 seconds.
Nobody could release a cut over 2 1/2 minutes.
So, what did I do?
I redid the labels.
"Running time 2 minutes,
48 seconds."
I didn't change the length.
I changed the label.
They played it.
It made everybody rich.
It's not, Linda, that you have to go against the tide.
Some people--some people, that's all they can do.
You understand?
Our friend Lawrence--
5'4", S&M freak.
Greatest general that ever lived.
End of his life, he retired,
Took on a false name, enlisted as a private.
What did he want?
Money, fame?
They made him sick.
What he wanted was what he had in the desert.
What he wanted was privacy, you understand?
They say I'm standoffish.
I'm not standoffish.
I'm inaccessible.
Always have been.
Is it--is it that
I don't like people?
I don't know.
I never spend any time with them.
Ah. OK.
Ah, special for you.
Thank you.
Here.
I can't even do this for you.
My hands are shaking.
I'm taking these drugs, neuroleptic drugs.
And a side effect is, it mimics MS.
so I can't play anymore.
I don't see how they thought I could have held a gun.

MAN ON RADIO: Number 42 on the "Rolling Stones" list
of the 500 greatest songs of all time,
"Be My Baby," 1963, by Phil Spector.
Spector is arraigned today in Los Angeles
Superior Court
for the murder of the actress...
Cut it off, will you?
Bruce is in the car with Phil?
That's right.
It says he said,
"We should call somebody."
Yeah, well, that's what he told me he said.
How do you get that into the record?
You break the chauffeur or you put him on the stand.
Spector?
Mm-hmm.
How can you do that?
You can't.
{Police sirens}
I thought you were going home.
It's the only hard evidence they have.
Everything else can be argued both sides.
He's a freak.
They're gonna convict him of, "I just don't like you."
Well, you break the chauffeur on the stand.
What?
As a cop, I'd say
DA's got the chauffeur jammed up.
On illegal immigration?
No, you're not using enough gun.
My money, they told this guy, look.
Here's a video of you helping a woman.
Oh, look.
She don't walk too well.
Has she been drugged?
Oh, and here you are helping her to go into the house
of this man who was paying you, from which house
she emerged dead.
Guess what.
You're an accessory to murder.
They've got your guy jammed up tighter than Kelsey's nuts.
Well, then he's gonna need a good lawyer.
{People shouting}

{People shouting}
POLICEMAN: Back, back.
Step aside.
Stay back.
WOMAN: Phil.
Giovanetta Ricci of Teleitalia.
Phil, I'd like to be inside your mind for just 5 minutes.
PHIL: You wouldn't like it.
GIOVANETTA: Phil!
{People shouting}
Mr. Jackson.
JACKSON: Thank you,
Your Honor.
Good morning, everybody.
We spent a lot of time over the last few days
talking about what you've read about the case,
what you've heard about the case,
what you know, what you think you know about the case.
This is my opportunity to talk with you for a few minutes
about what we expect the evidence to show, the actual facts
in the case, to show.
And that evidence, ladies and gentlemen,
is going to paint a very, very clear picture.
the picture of a man,
Philip Spector,
who, when he's confronted with the right circumstances,
when he's confronted with the right situation,
turns sinister and deadly.
You all right?
Yeah.
JACKSON: The evidence is going to paint a picture of a man
who on February 3, 2003, put a loaded pistol in Lana Clarkson's mouth
inside her mouth, and shot her to death.
This is what the evidence will show.
But to understand more fully, more globally, why
Philip Spector would have done what he did, how Lana Clarkson
fell victim to this man, you're going to be introduced to evidence
of the defendant's very rich history of violence,
a history of violence against women,
a history of violence involving guns.
Ladies and gentlemen, in other words, through the presentation
of the evidence in this case, you're going to be introduced
to the real
Philip Spector.
On February 3, 2003, at about 5:00 in the morning,
a single gunshot cracked the silence of the normally very quiet
community of
Alhambra, California.
抖
WOMAN: Hey, Phil!
Hey, Phil!
Back to mono!
Back to mono, Phil!
Back to mono!
Back to mono, Phil!
Back to mono.
Thank you for saying that.
You're welcome, and that's blood!
That's Lana
Clarkson's blood!
That's Lana
Clarkson's blood,
you fucking murderer!
You freak!
{People shouting}
WOMAN: Fucking murderer!
That's her blood!
And so therefore, what?
It comes down to whether she shot herself
or he shot her.
But--
WOMAN: Wasn't nobody else in the room.
What if it were impossible that he shot her?
WOMAN 2: The we're back to, why did she kill herself?
MAN: And he had pulled guns on women in the past.
WOMAN: He ain't putting that toothpaste
back in the tube.
That information is in the air.
It's not going back.
And you've got the-- we've seen all the--
we've seen--you got, um--can you play that video?
Of course.
{Beep}
WITNESS: He locked the door and he held me there at gunpoint.
He said, "If you leave,
I'll blow your head off."
I was standing there in the lobby, in the door.
I turned around, and there was a gun pointing at me.
I said, "Stop that."
BRUCE: This is going nowhere.
LINDA: Why is it going nowhere?
Because the only way to walk our guy out of the court--
because the only question those folks want to know is,
if she pulled the trigger, you had better tell me
why she did beyond all doubt, because I do not like your guy.
Those people in there, all their lives have got the short end
from the more powerful.
There's nothing redeeming in our guy.
Given the choice, they're gonna go for payback time.
On what evidence?
You don't have to convince me.
You have to convince them.
I thought you were going back to New York.
I'm staying on for the hotel food.
Get on board because our case is
she's a suicidal pillhead, and we have letters
and we have e-mails, and we...
WITNESS: I turned around, and there was a gun pointing at me.
I said, "Stop that."
I said, "Put it down."
"Stop. Just--
Stop.
He was screaming,
"You're not going.
"I'm not unlocking the door.
"I'll blow you away.
I'll shoot you."
抖
Now--now how many of you think he's guilty?
抖
What if, with all the facts that seem to be against him...
BRUCE: The girl fucking shot herself.
WOMAN: What if we have testimony
that he'd said in public-- that Phil Spector had said in public
to Lana Clarkson...
REPORTER: You're on record as saying
you're never happy unless you're unhappy.
Yeah.
So does that make me so unusual?
Mr. Spector?
How many millions of people..
That's good, and how many millions--
Freud was, God bless him,
essentially a confidence man.
He didn't invent a cure.
He invented a disease.
MAN: Phil!
PHIL: Yeah?
MAN: Where do you want it from?
PHIL: Take it from measure 14.
REPORTER: Freud said there was no cure but that perhaps
he could transform unbearable unhappiness
into simple human misery.
PHIL: Jack Daniels can do that.
MAN: Phil, where do you want it from?
PHIL: Oh, man.
A job can do that.
Please, guys!
What are you guys doing, man?
Hey, malingerers, what do you want?
You want one of them lounge chairs, floats in your pool?
When did this come in?
PHIL: A little...
We just got that.
PHIL: Are you cold?
Listen, you want to rest, go ahead.
Rest until you feel like picking it up
at measure 14.
I don't care.
Let me know.
REPORTER:
You know, Freud--
Freud?
What's Freud gonna do?
What is he gonna do-- change the past?
Tell the fucking client to indulge his feelings?
I--you know what
I say? No.
If he's got the courage, let the guy go out
and make something of his life.
It can be done, you know?
MAN: Phil, where do you want it from?
Yeah? Yeah. Oh, Barry, what do you want?
BARRY: You want it from measure 14?
PHIL: No, you know what I want?
I want you motherfuckers--
I'm coming.
Hold on a minute, all right?
Here you go. Hey.
We'll be with you in a minute. Don't worry.
MAN: Don't be stupid--
PHIL: OK, motherfuckers.
I told you you should finish college, huh?
Join the Marines, anything rather than throw yourself
on my...
MAN: Phil, OK--
PHIL: boundless mercy.
Right?
Take you in from the cold--and you know I did.
You should consider it a mercy I killed a lot of you,
save you the shame,
Walter, of ruining
this simple fucking song.
{Gunshot}
MUSICIAN: Oh! What--
REPORTER: Oh, my goodness.
Send out for Chinese.
We're gonna be here a while.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
See that?
Lesson learned.
OK, pretty.
We're ready for you. Mwah.
Oh, you moved.
Where were you?
Ha.
PHIL: Let me see.
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Let him go out and do something with his life.
MUSICIAN: Phil, what do you want?
Uh, play till the lemon chicken comes.
{Linda coughs}
You're sick?
End of a case, if you're not sick,
you're not working hard enough.
It's not the end of the case.
You're killing yourself.
Oh, what? I wish I could say the same for you.
I was in New York.
My caseload is not lim--
I have clients I left in New York, all right?
LINDA: Hmm.
BRUCE: What is it you love this guy,
all of a sudden you're working yourself to death?
LINDA: He's our client!
BRUCE: Oh, that's right.
You told me.
He covered you with a blanket.
WOMAN: Here you go.
BRUCE: You're a cheap date.
LINDA: Oh, fuck you, Bruce.
You've got a case that should have been thrown out.
The cops and the DA are trying him on the O.J. case.
The prosecution has nothing.
BRUCE: Except everyone's conviction that he's guilty.
LINDA: We've got ballistic evidence.
They trot up their experts; we trot up ours.
At the end of the day the jury finds him guilty,
and we have wasted their time--
unless we indict the girl.
Is he guilty?
Not beyond a reasonable doubt, but why don't you just show the yokels
your two-toned shirts, your cufflinks, fix your tie,
and say the law protects all equally?
Is that untrue?
It's true if you win.
Not true for freaks.
But for him, off he goes.
Is that what this is about--freaks?
Very good, Bruce.
That's right.
That's right.
It's all about me.
It's about me.
You know, the poor geek, the bookworm--
she gets judged in the schoolyard,
doesn't get a fair trial, except our guy does,
and the facts do not support a conviction.
I don't give a shit who he is.
I don't give a shit what he's done before.
OK.
Marvin Gaye--his father shot him, right?
Sam Cooke...in bed with some girl, husband comes home,
bam, bam, bam!
End of story.
Who gives a shit?
Lana Clarkson shot herself.
I was there.
Now they're treating me worse than they treated
Mark David Chapman.
His name plate reads
"What a shame,"
and he shot John Lennon.
And I, who happened to be in the same room
when this girl shot herself,
I am a monster the likes of which never saw
the light of day.
You--you want to explain that to me?
So, what is it, then?
What are we talking about here?
Hatred.
What do they hate about me?
I'm alive.
You know the saying
"The good die young," right?
Why?
Because the file is closed.
REPORTER: I understand.
Have you said that--
This is the story.
The girl exceeded her shelf life.
She's in L.A.
She's down on her luck.
She is broke.
Spector didn't help her?
That's not his job.
You're thinking of Christ.
He's not Christ.
He's a guy. He wanted affirmation.
He wanted sex.
68-year-old guy.
It's the same thing.
What is he-- pussy-crazed?
OK, she's working in some bar.
A guy comes in.
She brushes him off.
The boss says,
"Do you know who that is?"
So, what we have is a car crash.
She's lonely.
What is she supposed to do?
Hire the Goodyear blimp?
"Please help me.
I'm lonely"?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What, are you arguing my case?
PHIL: Why would I kill that girl?
REPORTER:
You were drunk.
PHIL: I was drunk.
I was drunk half my life.
These women.
Who are these women?
These women come out and say
I pulled a gun on them.
Where were they at the time of the supposed offense?
No. They came out of the woodwork years later.
They came out at the time.
No. Bullshit.
They--no. They didn't even press their case. Come on!
They came out when it was in their interest to come out--
they came out when there was something in it for them.
What was in it?
Publicity.
What did Lana Clarkson want?
Publicity.
What do they all want?
People--people think it's contagious--
you can get it by hanging around someone
who's got it.
I don't know this, and that idiot whom
I would have helped--
why not?
came in here and ruined my life by sticking a gun
in her mouth.
For--for what?
For what?
For what is this retribution?
For what am I being punished?
For being the most successful music producer
in the history of the world.
And if you think that's bullshit,
then you're not as smart as I know you are.
I am--I am so sorry that that girl,
that her life was full of suffering.
I'm sorry she died.
I didn't do it.
The State says the gun was in her mouth.
If he were 10 feet away, could he have done it?
BRUCE: The prosecution says you didn't go to her, you didn't touch her.
LINDA: Bruce.
He throws up his hands to avoid the paint.
His coat has one spot of paint on it,
10 feet away.
This is an exact copy if the coat Mr. Spector wore
on the night of the shooting, with a replica
of the blood spatter--
4 spots and 2 pinpricks--
of blood on the coat.
You're free to examine it if you wish.
Here is what happens to somebody standing
within arm's length of such an explosion.
When the shot comes from inside the mouth,
the brain explodes.
When the skull is intact, as here, the brain matter
the blood, is ejected through the nose and the mouth.
It seems to me Mr. Spector had to have been standing a minimum
of 10 feet from the event for him to have avoided being
painted--painted with brain matter and blood.
What do you think?
{Group murmurs}
MAN: Ronnie Spector interview.
RONNIE: I believe--I believe that Phil at one time
was very much like you or me, and at the start--at the start
of his career he was talented and devoted
a very serious musician.
But as the press began to write about him as a great, an icon,
or a genius, he began, yes, to be affected by it
and it affected him horribly, like a drug,
for it confused him.
He was tormented--not by the adulation, no, but by
the question--is it true, or is it deserved,
and what would the answer for that be?
There is no answer.
MAN: Thank you.
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Spector.
Uh, this interview was recorded at Everclear
Studios...
LINDA: Irene, can you get me the 911 tape-- you know, the chauffer?
IRENE: Mm-hmm.
LINDA: Put it in the room for me, let me listen to it?
Thanks.
{Beep}
WOMAN: What are you reporting?
IRENE: Mm-hmm.
MAN: My name is Adriano, and I'm Phil Spector's driver.
I think my boss just killed somebody.
WOMAN: You think your boss killed somebody?
ADRIANO: Yes.
Why do you think he killed somebody?
Because he...
LINDA: What's the speech pathologist, the Brazilian,
you know, the interpreter?
MAGGIE: Uh...
Have you got his number?
Yeah.
Here, let me show you.
It's this guy, this guy here.
Would you get me a meeting with him?
Sure.
WOMAN: Oh, yeah, sure.
Just give me a second.
MAN: Of course.
WOMAN: Just got it...
5 PM.
It was nice meeting you.
MAN: You, too. Yes.
What did they have you doing in there?
You're with the defense team?
I work in the office.
We were just watching these cartoons
about what the blood would do and so on.
You mean like movies?
Yeah.
And what do you think?
You could show me
"Dumbo."
Hey, what does that prove?
Anyone can make cartoons.
MAN: Thursday, May 7, 2009.
Retired LAPD officer
Joseph Smith.
Colt detective special.
In attendance, retired federal officer Michael Brown
with Ms. Linda Kenney Baden.
One round.
38 plus "P."
Hollow point, 110 grain.
OK.
Clear the range.
{Gunshot}
BRUCE: Then they say,
Dr. Spitz, your various credentials...
We should add my publication.
Oh, yeah. We will add your publication.
35 years in forensics.
Exactly.
Now, in your career you have investigated...
Over 10,000 instances of gunshot wounds.
Fatal.
Yes, gunshot wounds to the head.
Good. And then they show you the diagram,
and they say, have you ever...
in 35 years, that wound, the angle of that wound
is absolutely inconsistent with any
but a self-inflicted wound.
I'd put it simpler.
I don't understand.
I would say, "I've only ever seen that as a self-inflicted wound."
That's right.
In 95%, that is a self-inflic--
No. Dr. Spitz, you cannot say 95%.
I beg your pardon.
I was just using that as a figure of speech.
90--
Shh, shh.
Good, but you know, to the prosecution, you say 95%,
on cross-examination you've just admitted that there's a 5% chance
that it is not a self-inflicted wound.
Is there a 5% chance that somebody else shot her?
There is no chance.
Then do not say 95%.
That was just a figure of speech.
Sure, Dr. Spitz, but you've seen 10,000 case, right?
5% of which, the prosecution will point out,
is 500 cases in which that is not a self-inflicted wound.
It is a self- inflicted wound.
The we require you to so testify.
Now, Dr. Spitz, we're gonna take a look at the bullet itself.
Yes.
BRUCE: That's good if they let you use it.
What?
Oh, the tape?
Mm-hmm.
LINDA: No, no.
I'm not planning on using the tape.
No. Listen, it is impossible
that Philip took that shot.
If he had, his coat, his hair, his everything
would have been covered in blood.
We've got to break that thought into the jury's mind--
he could not have done it.
So you don't show them the tape?
No. No. I'm gonna build it.
BRUCE: Uh-huh.
I'm gonna build a bulletproof
Plexiglas chamber
and put it in the courtroom.
I'm gonna put the wound dummy in the chair
and a ballistics tech in a lab coat and have him pull the trigger.
When they see the booth and the coat, everything covered in blood,
the jury sees that, we just broke their thought processes.
We won the case.
The judge will never allow that.
"Culpepper v. Volkswagen."
I've got a hearing tomorrow at noon.
She shot herself.
You bet she did.
Why?
Not our problem anymore.
It's been decided it's inadmissible.
PHIL: What does that mean?
LINDA: It means you can't legally base a demonstration
on a theory.
You know what? Why don't they get a carpenter in there?
Get a carpenter in there, build me a coffin,
have the judge nail me in.
Philip.
Get it over with.
Philip, the California law--
They see that demonstration,
I walk out of there free.
It's been decided the judge will--and can legally
disallow it.
Therefore, to make a request doomed to failure is--
Why would I kill that girl?
Why?
Because she wouldn't what?
She wouldn't what?
She would have done anything I asked.
That's why she came here.
No. So forget why.
How?
What did I do?
What did I say?
"Here.
"You hold the gun and you put it in your mouth.
I'll pull the trigger."
Why?
Because I want to prove my power.
My power was she got in the car.
That was my power.
Some wretched, stunted Jewish kid, a poor kid,
who could have, over the years, any fucking woman
I wanted--
oh, I'm gonna throw my life away for her.
Why not?
She was a cocktail waitress.
In the old days, the cops, they showed up,
she shot herself, they throw her in jail
for fucking up my evening,
dead as she was.
I want you to put me on the stand.
LINDA: One-way ticket to the gallows.
I want to tell what happened.
What happened?
You got 12 seconds?
抖
I was drunk.
She was screwed up out of her mind.
I took her home.
She asked me-- she asked me
did I have any guns around the house?
I said, "Why?"
She said, "I find it exciting."
Many women do.
So I showed her the guns,
I went in the other room, I came back.
She's got a gun in her hand, and she's smiling
provocatively, right?
She takes the stupid gun, puts it in her mouth.
I scream, "No!"
The gun goes off.
抖
LINDA: It's interesting.
PHIL: What?
The various looks,
the wigs.
A lot of people think they're wigs.
That's called prejudice.
抖
Brindon, where are they?
They have gone.
We must tell Torvald.
He was with them.
No.
BRINDON: Shall I alert Princess Isa?
No. Better to take a dagger through the heart,
for the news would kill her.
Brindon...
95%. Unbelievable.
LINDA: My boss came out of the house and said,
"I think I just killed somebody."
"I think I should call somebody"?
You want to know the case?
Our guy used to be a big shot.
Now he's nobody.
The girl--she's living the dream.
Should have died
10 years ago
when she could marry money.
Too late now--she's every woman's nightmare.
She goes home with a fella.
She ends up dead.
Let your guy go?
Why?
What was he doing there with her?
That's not what he's being tried for.
Really?
What time does Bruce get in?
1:05.
What if it were an accident?
Ah.
Thank you for coming today.
Thank you.
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.
Good.
My name is Michael
Brown.
Jenny O'Brien.
BROWN: I'm a retired federal officer.
I've spent most of my government service occupied with
ballistics, which is the study of projectiles
and firearms.
This is a model of a firearm, a revolver.
As you see, it cannot fire anything.
There is nothing to fire.
It's solid plastic.
That's all it is.
This model--I won't call it a toy, because it's not a toy--
is designed for purposes of demonstration.
OK?
Mmm.
Basically...it's a garage door opener.
Now, here is one thing this model can do.
If the trigger is depressed, it sends a signal...
{Alarm sounds}
The light and the alarm go off.
You all received your checks for coming in today?
Yes.
Fine.
In addition to your honorarium, in addition to that,
if you can insert the model in your mouth without pulling the trigger,
you'll receive $300.
You understand?
Yeah.
Wrapped in plastic.
Completely sterile.
Please remove it from the plastic.
Now without pulling the trigger,
insert the model in your mouth.
Close it.
JAMES: For God's sakes, what the fuck are you doing?!
Take it out!
Take it out of your mouth!
{Alarm ringing}
That's our case.
And what does forensics say?
Forensics says the gun was inside her mouth,
handle and trigger guard down, which means that
the front sight was up.
Now, somebody yells, "Take that gun out of your mouth."
She pulls it out fast.
The front sight gets caught on her upper teeth,
hand keeps pulling, depresses the trigger, the gun goes off.
It's not in evidence.
I'll put it in the closing.
It's too late.
I'll tell you why.
Everybody at that point assumes that he's guilty.
Linda, all of this, the rubber gun?
I won't take the rubber gun to court.
Linda...
It's so clear.
The judge didn't allow
Clarkson's diary.
he won't allow--
Linda, the point is, all right,
they think he's a monster.
You take the skull in, they're sure.
Monster. Lives in a cave. Look at the skull.
They turn away from your client and his evidence.
I make them look at it.
You're thrashing,
Linda.
I'm telling you that if she put the gun in her own mouth--
and she did--
And I am telling you, the only way you can introduce
all this fucking
Ben-Hur
is in support of direct testimony.
Remember procedure, which testimony only comes and could come
on direct from
Mr. Spector.
Are you gonna put him on the stand,
or should I just fucking go jump under a train.
What?
BRUCE: Take care of yourself.
PHIL: Thank you,
Ben.
People say diet is bullshit.
Diet is not bullshit.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
What's this?
LINDA: That's a note from Bruce.
A note?
"My personal numbers" in case of what?
In the case you need him.
These numbers are in New York.
Yeah. Well, Bruce went back.
Look here.
This is the statement--
Bruce went back to New York?
Yeah, sure. You knew he was going back.
To do his television show.
No. He didn't go back to do his television show.
He left me to do--
Philip.
Philip, you told him you didn't wish him to--
do you recall the closing?
You agreed, the judge agreed that
Bruce could retire
before the closing.
Retire from the case?
Yes. Well, you agreed.
What, I agreed?
What do you mean,
I agreed?
I agreed to what?
I agreed to what?
It's relevant to this?
No, no, no, no.
No. This is unethical.
He withdrew in open court, Philip.
You were there.
I didn't understand.
Well, you discussed this.
When I paid him
$1 million
to defend my life?
You and the judge and Bruce Cutler, remember?
You all talked about this.
I thought he was going on a trip. Come on!
"These are my
New York numbers"?
He has other clients.
He left me.
He left me to do his television show.
Don't break my heart.
And I paid him
$1 million, and I foolishly expected
from him, loyalty.
For--for what?
For life?
No.
For the duration of a trial, in which
he pleaded with me to give him the job.
Why did he want the job?
Why?
Because he liked me?
He despised me.
He wanted the job because I needed him,
because I was weak.
He was strong.
He wanted my money.
I don't understand that?
Philip, you agreed in front of a judge--
I thought he was going shopping.
Please.
Who was there to tell me different?
Who? Who could have?
I'm ignorant.
What do I know about these things?
Who could have sat me down and told me and explained it to me?
Who?
My lawyer.
That's who.
Who's gone.
You let him go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you're upset.
I know you are.
So.
What do we do now?
If you testify, we get to do
the demonstrations.
I don't get that.
That means I've got to put you on the stand.
All right.
You do understand what that means?
I get to tell my story.
It means they get to tear you apart.
Well, you defend me.
抖
LINDA: You ever know anyone who was disfigured?
I mean, you know, some serious hard to look at?
After a time--after a time, you come not to notice.
抖
{Clears throat}
抖
LINDA:
Can you turn on the lights?
All right.
It's impressive.
All right. All right.
PHIL: OK.
The defense calls
Philip Spector.
Place your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give
in the matter now before this court is
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
State your name.
Philip Spector.
Please be seated.
Now, Mr. Spector,
I would like you to describe,
in as much detail as you can recall,
the events of the night of February 2, 2003.
PHIL: Uh, I had a date with a girl.
MAN: Objection!
Could the witness be more specific?
Could he state the name of the girl, please?
Yes. State the name of the girl, please.
Her name was Lana
Clarkson.
Would you speak up, please?
Lana Clarkson.
I had a date with a girl named Lana Clarkson.
LINDA: Now.
Mr. Spector, did you kill
Lana Clarkson?
No.
LINDA: Did you put a revolver in her mouth?
No.
Did you suggest that she do so?
No.
Did you threaten her?
No.
Did you keep her in your house by force?
No. She wanted to stay--
Objection.
Sustained.
Did you keep her in your house by force?
Yes or no.
No.
All right.
{Linda coughs}
LINDA: All right.
Good.
MAN AND LINDA:
Mr. Spector, your attitude is...
LINDA: Objection,
Your Honor.
Is this the prosecution's closing?
As if not--
WOMAN: Sustained.
MAN: All right. As we continue, and I thank the court
for its patience, and I would ask Mr. Spector if he would be good enough
to discard the tactic of "I don't remember,"
as the jury,
I again assure you--
LINDA: Objection,
Your Honor.
WOMAN: Objection sustained.
MAN: Mr. Spector, would you please keep your voice up?
LINDA: It's been a long day, Your Honor.
I suggest we reconvene tomorrow.
Your Honor, I object to the defense's tactic of interruption,
and I ask the court's indulgence that I may
close out this line of questioning.
WOMAN: Yes. Your request is granted.
You may continue.
Thank you, Your Honor.
OK.
Mr. Spector, you have testified that
"I came back into the room.
"She had the gun in her mouth.
I screamed No!
Have you asked me a question?
I'm about to.
OK.
Where did the gun come from?
LINDA: Objection.
We've testified.
Where did the gun come from, Mr. Spector?
You've testified that you had 9--
9 firearms on your property to which you have admitted.
Objection.
Was it one of these?
Objection.
Overruled.
Or is this, say, an outlier which you have forgot?
As you forgot the incident with Debra Robertie
in which you, in joking, pulled a gun on her?
All right, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
I have a sheaf of affidavits.
One moment, please.
Of your behavior around women, with guns.
Of coercion, assault--
LINDA: Objection.
Of coercion and battery, unlawful imprisonment.
Your Honor, the evidence in this court--
Incarcerated?
Your Honor, Mr. Spector has never been accused--
Convicted.
LINDA: And this is the essence of this case.
There is no legally admissible evidence, which is to say
there is no evidence--
All right, all right, all right.
And I would move for a direct--
I have a tape--I have a tape of your wife Ronnie Spector,
in which she testifies to your repeated cruelties
and assaults.
physical, verbal, and sexual.
No, no, no, no.
Your Honor,
Mr. Spector--
Shut that fucking thing off.
OK, let her come into the court.
Where did she say this in a court of law?
Have her come in here, let her--let her
come here and beat me.
Let that psychotic bitch come forward in court
and swear where she can be cross-examined--
MAN: "He threatened me."
Turn that fucking thing off.
"He beat me such that I..."
PHIL: That sick, no-talent--
"He kept me from my children."
PHIL: Turn that fucking thing off!
If I hadn't found her--
MAN: "He locked me in my room."
If I hadn't found her in the gutter,
what do you think?
Do you think these singers
made those songs?
I made those songs.
Your Honor.
Ah, fuck this.
Fuck this whole thing,
this fucking charade.
And what do you do?
Who are you?
How dare you?
Who--who do you think you are,
to come in here and accuse me?
Philip.
I understand.
I know what's going on.
LINDA: Philip--
Shut up!
Because I'm paying the lot of you for this whole thing.
I understand
that this semi-talented nowhere, this backup singer,
to whom I gave everything I own--
my life, her life, my children.
And to have you come in here quoting her libelous, non-sworn,
cowardly bullshit!
What does it cost her to lash out at me?
Or you, for that matter?
Philip, this is a rehearsal.
I know it's a rehearsal!
Damn it! What do you think I am?
An idiot?
Do you think
I'm a fool?
Do you think I don't know what this is about?
I've played this game a million times before.
I know how the game is played!
I've done this my whole life.
What do you think?
They kill men for telling the truth.
This is the truth!
All right. All right.
All out.
Everybody out.
PHIL: Uh, but...
{Linda coughs}
OK.
I worked my whole life.
I worked my whole life.
All right?
LINDA: It's not all right.
It's not all right.
It's not all right.
It's certainly not all right, Philip.
If you go off like that in the courtroom--
And I know you put the woman up there to see
if I'd go off.
This is not going off.
Not re-fucking-motely.
Would you like to trust me, Philip?
You might want to trust me, because
I'm the last person
who both, "A," believes in you and
"B" has the power
to help your case.
Oh, is that why you brought back--
Shut up, Philip.
Now listen.
You know the difference between
your different behaviors.
I act the same with everyone.
No, nobody does.
You didn't act the same around your bands.
You didn't act the same around the Beatles
like you did with an autograph-seeker.
You can control your behavior.
Why is this important?
Because if you don't,
you're going to jail for the rest of your life.
The prosecution is gonna do everything
in its power to enrage you
because that's all they have.
That is what we are doing here today.
They have no facts.
They have to break you.
You see, if you go off, the jury will say,
"He did it now.
I'm sure he did it then,"
and they'll put you away.
I had no trouble with the Beatles.
And you will have no trouble with the
D.A.
if you recall that you want something from him
and you will go free.
Now, I want something from you.
I want you to give up the pills, give up the wine
for the 2 or 3 days you'll be on the stand
and keep your composure,
just like you did around the Beatles.
I mean, if Paul disagreed with you,
did you scream at him?
On "Let It Be"?
I was proved right.
And you will be proved right here
if you keep your composure.
But if you don't, you won't.
I promise you that
I will be prepared mentally,
spiritually, and that
I will make a good impression
and...keep their respect.
I understand.
Thank you.
You know why?
Why?
Not for what they think of me, but what you think of me.
Thank you. I take that
as a great compliment.
LINDA: Vicky, where's the car?
PHIL: So.
All right?
Yeah. I'm just saving it--you know,
saving my best work for when we're rolling.
I'm a little tired, too,
I think.
Best I go home and rest for tomorrow.
PHIL:
No, I get it.
It--it don't start getting better till it's gotten bad.
I'm equal to it.
Hey, guys, you want to see if the car's ready, please?
MAN: I got it.
Anyway, thank you.
No.
This was a good idea.
You rest up.
We'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
So thank you all.
Let me just say I know you were paid
to get me prepared.
You did an excellent job.
You were paid to perform,
and your performance was perfect.
So can I do as well as you?
Tomorrow, we'll see.
If I do, it's because of you, right?
Thank you.
Linda, you want to go to the car?
LINDA: Yeah.
What you're doing,
Linda, is good.
It's what I always tried to do,
so I know what you're doing.
What am I doing, Philip?
You're defending the artist.
I know you're not well.
I know what this is costing you.
That's what I go by.
I've met a lot of crazy people in my life.
I've met very few sane ones
that I could talk to.
抖
VERNON:
All right.
Here we go.
抖
He don't look good.
He's tired.
Are you going to keep him up on the stand all day tomorrow?
I'm gonna keep him up there till they all get used to him,
after which he will no longer be an oddity
but a beloved eccentric,
and they'll be telling their grandchildren
how they helped to set an innocent man free.
抖

Linda, hi.
You know my wife
Kelly.
Linda Kenney Baden.
No. Hi.
How do you do?
Honey, the tickets.
The tickets--
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
So how long have you two been married?
I've been following your trial.
How could you defend that man?
What does your pin mean?
Medical aid for Africa.
And are you active in that?
Yes, I am.
So you're compassionate.
All right.
So would you hire an ex-convict?
I might.
So suppose she was convicted of, say, theft
and she comes to you, she tells you her story, and you judge she deserves
a break, so you give her a job, and then after a year or so,
the household money goes missing.
Do you suspect her first?
I would of course check--
Of course you do.
No matter how much you're committed to
"presumed innocent,"
you will suspect her first.
I work in the music business.
I know something about your client.
He's a terrible man.
He's not being tried for that.
Do you think he shot her?
I don't see how he could have.
Can you prove that he didn't shoot her?
Well, that's not my job.
By the way--
I got them.
did you know that your husband is cheating on you?
That's ridiculous.
And that's called
"giving him the benefit of the doubt."
It's good to see you, Linda.
You, too.
Good night.
Good night.
Do you think you'll get him off?
Yes, I do.
If you get him off, what will you do
when he kills the next girl?

As we near the end of a long--a very long trial,
Phil Spector, once the darling of the music industry,
having sold millions of records, now facing a jury,
charged with the shooting death of actress Lana
Clarkson.
What are we seeing down there, Patty?
PATTY: That's right, Bill.
His name is in the record books, and we all know his music,
but the trial, the charge, have nothing to do with his profession
but of course with his personal life.
I know this is the day that you've all been waiting for.
You've been waiting on his arrival,
and here, yes, here is
Phil Spector.
Ready.
Dr. Spitz, you understand we won't be
getting to you for several days because--
Yes.
we will be examining
Mr. Spector...
I understand.
But I thought it was important for you to hear the testimony
on direct.
Are you gonna keep him up there all day?
JAMES: Linda.
When are you doing the demonstrations?
I've got to introduce it on redirect.
Uh, excuse me.
Not 95%. I understand.
That is self-inflicted.
LINDA: Yes.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Yes. No, no, no.
Not yet. Not yet.
Um, hello? Listen.
Hello? Listen.
I want to inspect the ballistic test materials
tonight, OK?
{People shouting}
James?
OK.
When we've got him-- no, no, no, no.
Either way.
Either way.
When he's on the stand, I--
if you see me do this...
OK? this.
Uh-huh.
You come from the back of the court
and you pass me a note,
only make sure it's not blank, because Fiedler
might ask to see it, so it should say
"Communication from
Bruce Cutler
New York. Urgent."
Can he keep it together on the stand?
He's got to, all right?
PATTY: We're here outside the State Courthouse, where
Phil Spector has just made a rather spectacular entrance.
Stay with him--stay with him as long as you can stay with him,
and then get the reactions of the crowd.
Is he out of his mind?
Follow him. Follow him through.
Follow on Phil.
Oh, my God.
Phil Spector has just entered the courthouse.
As you know, reporters are not allowed into the courthouse,
but if you stay with us, we will be out here
waiting for his return.
We will be back with you.
We'll have the news of the day.
Stay with us.
We will be waiting...

Policeman 2:
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let me through.

PHIL: What is it?
Well, it's pneumonia,
Philip.
{Cough}
Oh, pneumonia?
Oh, man.
You got to take care of yourself.
Look in the mirror.
You're concerned about my appearance.
LINDA: Look in the mirror,
Philip.
I know. I wanted,
Linda, to look my best today.
I know you're concerned about my hair.
My hair--listen to me.
My hair is an homage.
Philip--
To Jimi Hendrix. Yes?
Who suffered--
Look...
Who suffered, who was persecuted
Philip...
Please, just don't make a big thing out of this.
This is not as outrageous as it looks.
Philip...
Linda, what is it?
It's not a big thing.
Here, let me just tell you.
I spent quite a bit of time on this.
I've been up since
4:00 in the morning, right?
And the truth-- the truth is
that backlit, this--
LINDA: Listen--
Listen to me.
I know about these things.
I know these things.
I'm an expert at these things.
What things?
Show business, Linda.
Putting on a show.
Will you grant me that?
Sure. All right.
The amount of time I spent with the Ronettes,
the Crystals, with
Darlene, with the Bobby
Socks, with Tina,
on their clothes, on their dresses.
One might have even whispered at the time, many things--
Philip--
One might have even--
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Linda.
One might have even whispered, "This man is queer."
Further, had I been queer,
it wouldn't have mattered because
I never cared
who put what into whom.
What business was that of mine?
I'm quoted on that.
{Knock on door}
Yes, we're coming.
I presume they want us back in court.
Yes, that's it.
So...
I want you to put your mind at rest.
When I'm up there, should they mention my hair, and they may,
I'll be proud to tell them just what I told you.
All right?
I'm ready.
All right.
I'm ready.
WOMAN: All rise.
The Superior Court for the
County of Los Angeles, hear ye, hear ye,

Philip, we'll just-- let's see tomorrow,
we'll see how it goes.
MAN: Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give
in the matter now before this court...
Phil Spector has arrived.
Take a look behind me
as his Mercedes begins to make its way down the drive.
You can see his driver going at a very fast speed
while the protesters are yelling
"Justice for Lana."
Here he comes as he makes his way down the street,
up to his mansion, and he's pulling up to...
MAN: Go ahead.
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop. Get back.
Hold on.
REPORTER: ... on the driveway...
抖
I've got one for you.
All right.
Why the barbed wire?
To keep people out.
Nobody was trying to get in.
Why does the monster live in a castle?
Why does the minotaur live in a cave?
I mean, he could live wherever he wanted.
Why does he live in a cave?
Why does the minotaur live in a cave?
To keep himself from doing harm.
But he came out.
I believe he is not guilty.
Are you sure?
No.
But I have a reasonable doubt.
MAN: This is
Brian Jennings.
Another day, another turn in the saga.
Phil Spector retired for the night to his home that
that he calls his "castle."
And we'll leave you for tonight, too.
Signing off from Los
Angeles...

{5863}{5896}{y:i}a bona fide, triple-a
{5897}{5962}vote-winning political superstar.
{6611}{6655}Monsieur le president.
{6656}{6760}Our prime minister, john major,
{6760}{6818}and my political|opponents in britain,
{6819}{6898}believe that they will|win the next election
{6899}{6984}by expressing their|hostility to europe.
{6985}{7059}Well, not me.
{7664}{7714}let-  i'm sorry, mr. blair....
{7715}{7757}Excuse me. excuse me.
{7786}{7832}Tony, that was terrific.|They loved you.
{7832}{7879}So good, i almost|believed it myself.
{7879}{7948}I just got a confirmation|from the foreign office.
{7949}{7996}It's a yes for the washington trip.
{7997}{8064}- great! - meeting with the|chairman of the federal reserve,
{8064}{8123}reception at the british embassy-|- And clinton?
{8123}{8198}{y:i}A one-on-one with the man himself|in the oval office.
{8216}{8271}With the full white house|press corps in attendance.
{8272}{8347}But i thought leaders of the opposition|were meant to be kept at a distance
{8348}{8382}so as not to upset|the prime minister.
{8383}{8441}{y:i}- man: they are.|- So why the exception?
{8442}{8483}Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
{8484}{8538}They think you're going to win.
{8566}{8594}{y:i}Have you seen my blue shirt?
{8595}{8660}{y:i}- what? - have you seen|my blue shirt?
{8660}{8710}{y:i}I can't hear you!
{8711}{8760}Well, they'll have to go to|the court of appeals for that,
{8761}{8803}if they have the stomach for it.
{8803}{8851}- have you seen my blue shirt?|- Which blue shirt?
{8852}{8896}- the pale blue.|- Look in the basket.
{8896}{8964}Yeah, i'll see you at court 27.
{9006}{9067}If i put it in the basket,|why didn't she do it?
{9068}{9130}- take another shirt.|- I've already chosen my tie.
{9131}{9203}- then take another tie.|- I don't want to take another tie!
{9204}{9277}It's touching. i've not seen|you this nervous before.
{9278}{9330}- i'm not nervous.|- Then why are you snapping?
{9331}{9369}I'm not sna...
{9432}{9469}The last time you|went to washington,
{9470}{9536}i seem to remember a slightly|more casual attitude.
{9537}{9598}Last time i went to washington,|i met with clinton's advisors.
{9599}{9692}- to nick their ideas. - no, to seek|their advice on reshaping the party.
{9693}{9730}Reshaping yourself more like.
{9731}{9806}You came back clinton hair,|clinton suit...
{9807}{9863}Everything minus the|tarty girlfriend.
{9864}{9930}Why does his wife put up with...
{9954}{10022}Oh, tony, don't worry.
{10023}{10076}He'll love you.
{10152}{10198}Hopefully there'll be|somewhere in washington
{10199}{10250}i can get a bloody shirt done.
{10493}{10548}Good god. they're bringing us in
{10548}{10592}{y:i}through the northwest gate.
{10593}{10652}{y:i}- what does that mean?|- Man: it's the front door,
{10653}{10680}{y:i}the heads of state entrance.
{10681}{10743}As if you were already|prime minister.
{10801}{10856}- switch sides.|- Why?
{10857}{10903}They'll open the door on the left.
{10904}{10949}You have to get out first. come on.
{10985}{11059}For goodness' sake.
{11059}{11109}- well, help, alastair.|- Tony.
{11181}{11243}I hope nobody saw that.
{11270}{11352}{y:i}- alastair: comfy?|- Yes.
{11583}{11621}Thanks.
{11660}{11706}Good morning, sir.|Welcome to the white house.
{11707}{11746}Thank you. this is|alastair campbell...
{11747}{11777}- how do you do? - ...m|y press secretary,
{11778}{11809}and jonathan powell,|chief of staff.
{11810}{11871}Yes, we know.|Right this way, gentlemen.
{12001}{12040}First time in the white house?
{12041}{12102}- yes.|- Please tell me you're getting
{12103}{12154}- a kick out of this.|- Yes, thank you.
{12155}{12233}Potus is still in the|family residence right now.
{12234}{12313}- potus?|- President of the united states.
{12314}{12394}{y:i}Ah. -
{12395}{12464}{y:i}- - woman: heading|down the staircase.
{12464}{12517}Will we have one of those?
{12518}{12582}{y:i}On the ground floor now...
{12632}{12686}{y:i}into the colonnade.
{12756}{12815}Not bad. 15 minutes late.
{12815}{12879}You must be important.
{12880}{12924}{y:i}Okay, here we go, sir.
{12925}{12976}Straight ahead.
{13124}{13192}Be sure to ask him|about the moon rock.
{13386}{13424}Excellent.
{13652}{13732}{y:i}Bill clinton: i'm very glad we|had this chance to talk.
{13732}{13800}{y:i}I've always been straight with you, mr.|Ambassador,
{13801}{13887}{y:i}so when i tell you that we share the|concerns of the people of okinawa,
{13888}{13940}{y:i}i know that you'll believe me.
{14097}{14177}Secretary perry and i have|been talking through some ideas
{14178}{14257}that will safeguard our security|interests in the northern pacific,
{14258}{14322}as well as fulfill our|commitments to your people.
{14373}{14443}Japan has long been a|close security partner
{14443}{14501}with the united states and nothing,|i promise you,
{14502}{14544}is going to jeopardize that.
{14578}{14650}{y:i}Well, it's good talking|to you too.
{14693}{14758}- mr. blair.|- Tony, please.
{14759}{14816}Welcome to the white house.
{14817}{14898}I have been following your|career with great interest.
{14899}{14946}So you know we've taken|a page out of your book.
{14946}{15058}Quite a few pages, which i|consider to be a big compliment.
{15058}{15094}Have a seat.
{15094}{15189}You know, we keep a pretty|close eye on things over here,
{15190}{15262}and we think that the|smart money is on you...
{15263}{15354}And i thought a high-profile|visit with an american president
{15355}{15410}might just help you|across the finish line.
{15410}{15485}Because i believe you're|going to win by a landslide.
{15486}{15593}So what you've got to realize is|rhetoric can only get you so far.
{15594}{15640}You can talk your way into office
{15641}{15694}but you're not going to stay|there unless you can deliver
{15695}{15748}on the promise of your words.
{15749}{15808}Well, we've had 17 years|of conservative government,
{15809}{15913}during which the country's|veered wildly off course.
{15914}{15965}If labour does get in,
{15966}{16026}i'd like to make sure that|we stay in long enough
{16027}{16065}to get us back on the right track.
{16066}{16128}I think we're going to|enjoy working together.
{16129}{16205}Now don't get me wrong-|major's not all that bad.
{16205}{16243}He's been great on|northern ireland.
{16244}{16289}And when you're elected|it is my sincere hope
{16290}{16332}that you continue|the fight for peace.
{16333}{16398}Oh, peace in northern ireland|is at the top of my agenda.
{16399}{16450}I just don't think it's|reasonable in today's world
{16451}{16540}to carry on with|that kind of dispute.
{16541}{16592}If you need my help,|just pick up the phone.
{16593}{16640}Thanks, i will.
{16641}{16711}And don't be surprised if you feel|completely, totally overwhelmed
{16712}{16757}when you do get into office,
{16758}{16806}because in all that|time out on the road,
{16807}{16872}scrambling and fighting|to actually get that job,
{16872}{16936}no one briefs you on what|you do when you get there.
{16936}{16988}- - now you|seem a pretty quick study,
{16988}{17032}i bet you're going to|settle in just fine.
{17032}{17114}So we have a few minutes|before the press.
{17115}{17166}Did anyone around here
{17167}{17214}tell you to ask|about the moon rock?
{17215}{17271}Uh, they did, actually.
{17314}{17400}3.6 billion years old.
{17401}{17476}You know, sometimes when things|get stressful around here,
{17477}{17540}i just shut that door,|sit on the couch, hold that rock
{17541}{17637}and think, "we all just|gotta chill a little."
{17638}{17699}{y:i}a productive meeting, mr.|President?
{17700}{17780}Very. we discussed|a number of things
{17780}{17843}including the peace process|in northern ireland,
{17844}{17906}which is an article of faith|for me personally, as you know.
{17907}{17975}Do you think you've been talking to the|next prime minister of great britain?
{17976}{18043}Oh, come on. that's not|a diplomatic question.
{18084}{18124}Look. i just hope he's been talking
{18125}{18179}to the next president|of the united states.
{18223}{18283}{y:i}Tonight bill clinton|proves his title,
{18284}{18326}{y:i}"the comeback kid," after winning
{18327}{18389}{y:i}an historic second term|in the white house.
{18390}{18431}{y:i}Bill clinton is the first democrat
{18432}{18478}{y:i}to win re-election since|franklin delano roosevelt.
{18479}{18555}{y:i}- - man #2: a labour|prime minister in #10
{18556}{18616}{y:i}after 18 years of|conservative ruling.
{18616}{18687}{y:i}Man #3: this is a presidential|moment if ever there were one.
{18688}{18746}{y:i}Look at them grabbing at h with|pason in their faces.
{18747}{18786}{y:i}He's their man. what a moment.
{18787}{18831}{y:i}Let's just listen to the|sound for a second.
{18899}{18959}{y:i}Woman #2: tony blair and his|wife cherie led labour
{18960}{19031}{y:i}out of the wilderness and back|into downing street.
{19031}{19099}{y:i}Man #2: the new prime minister promised|to work for all the people.
{19100}{19167}{y:i}He said his government would|take practical measures
{19167}{19225}{y:i}in pursuit of noble causes.
{19226}{19286}Hey, good to see you.
{19287}{19324}- hello.|- How are you?
{19325}{19401}Tony, president chirac on the line.
{19402}{19455}{y:i}How do you want to do this?
{19455}{19499}{y:i}In english or french?
{19499}{19567}- does it matter?|- Well, he speaks fluent english,
{19568}{19603}as you know,
{19604}{19659}but my guess is he'll|start in french,
{19660}{19704}thinking it'll give|him the upper hand.
{19705}{19768}- - i think you|should stand your ground,
{19769}{19813}do this in english.
{19814}{19867}I'll be listening in.
{19868}{19923}{y:i}-
{19981}{20050}{y:i}hello. -
{20115}{20156}{y:i}thank you, jacques.
{20276}{20320}Let's hope so.
{20522}{20578}Well, i will do everything i can
{20579}{20615}{y:i}to live up to that.
{20616}{20688}{y:i}Tony. clinton, line two.
{20727}{20790}Uh, unfortunately, jacques,
{20791}{20840}i've got to go.
{20862}{20912}Sorry about......
{21020}{21070}Bill! how great of you to call.
{21071}{21110}{y:i}Please hold for the president
{21111}{21157}{y:i}of the united states of america.
{21158}{21211}{y:i}-|right.
{21305}{21377}- your call, mr. president.|- Thank you. excuse me.
{21377}{21425}Is this tony blair i'm speaking to
{21425}{21461}or the new dictator|of great britain?
{21461}{21537}{y:i}- congratulations, tony.|- Thank you.
{21538}{21642}{y:i}A majority of 179.|It's unbelievable.
{21643}{21690}I'm gonna make a|prediction right now
{21691}{21767}and say that the 2nd of may, 1997,
{21768}{21809}is the day that|progressive politics
{21809}{21874}became the default setting|in western democracies.
{21875}{21932}So that's your name in the|history books right there.
{21933}{21985}{y:i}And you won edgbaston...
{21986}{22035}{y:i}the first labour victory|there ever...
{22036}{22123}and wirral south.|Tony, it's sensational.
{22124}{22170}Hey, listen. i've gotta go,
{22171}{22233}but we're gonna see each|other in about a month.
{22234}{22299}- yes, indeed. - all right.|We'll catch up properly then.
{22300}{22366}Hey, why don't we have dinner|one night, the four of us?
{22367}{22404}Sherry and hillary too.
{22405}{22464}Uh, cherie. i'd love that.
{22465}{22543}{y:i}Okay, it's a date.|I'll let you pick the place.
{22544}{22577}We're easy. we'll eat anything.
{22578}{22636}Just no catfish or fried|green tomatoes, okay?
{22637}{22688}That's a promise.
{22689}{22731}{y:i}See ya.
{22874}{22920}Did we win edgbaston?
{22920}{22960}Yes.
{22992}{23035}And wirral south?
{23036}{23078}Apparently.
{23116}{23175}He's got no business knowing that.
{23175}{23221}That's just showing off.
{23222}{23308}{y:i}President clinton and first lady|hillary rodham clinton
{23309}{23388}{y:i}made a detour to london to pay a flying|visit to tony blair today.
{23389}{23459}{y:i}All the stops... - man:...|a pair of postwar baby boomers
{23460}{23520}{y:i}who came to power by moderating|the liberal tendencies
{23521}{23566}{y:i}of their respective|political parties.
{23567}{23619}{y:i}Man #2: the meetings will be|closely watched for signals
{23620}{23684}{y:i}as to what can be expected of the two men|who sm to have so much in common.
{23685}{23746}Are you sure i can't|offer you anything?
{23747}{23812}No, i'm good.
{23915}{24021}I suppose you know the awful term|"special relationship"?
{24022}{24081}It's something our foreign|office is always keen to promote.
{24082}{24155}Oh, i know it. every|country on earth claims it.
{24156}{24228}Although, in terms of actual|effect on u. s. foreign policy,
{24229}{24284}{y:i}israel, china, saudi arabia,
{24285}{24356}and the irish republic are|the ones who merit it.
{24382}{24445}Still, every now and again
{24446}{24505}a situation arises where...
{24543}{24600}Personal chemistry|between the two leaders...
{24601}{24680}As well as the shared language,|shared history...
{24681}{24775}Is such that it could|actually have some currency.
{24806}{24860}You think this is one|of those moments?
{24907}{24946}I do actually.
{25010}{25078}You have to ask yourself: all.
{25079}{25173}When did it last happen that|two guys on the same team,
{25174}{25239}found themselves with their|hands on the joystick like this?
{25240}{25293}It's a unique opportunity.
{25294}{25340}- yes, it is.|- We take away the bullshit,
{25341}{25399}{y:i}all the reasons that things|don't get done...
{25400}{25442}the same old excuses,|the same roadblocks
{25443}{25512}to progress that people have|been throwing up for years...
{25513}{25569}We could put right-wing politics
{25570}{25657}out of business for a generation.|Heck, maybe forever.
{25657}{25717}- the same with the old far left.|- Exactly.
{25717}{25778}Progressive, center-left|politics is the future.
{25779}{25827}What you're talking about is a...
{25828}{25872}Is a whole paradigm shift.
{25873}{25924}A new kind of politics|for the new millennium.
{25925}{25985}We build a global consensus|around our ideas,
{25986}{26029}there's nothing that|we can't tackle.
{26029}{26073}{y:i}I mean, you look at the facts:
{26074}{26142}I've got three more years,|then al gore...
{26143}{26179}That's eight years right there.
{26180}{26224}And then in europe,|you're just getting started.
{26225}{26268}There's persson in sweden,|schroeder in germany.
{26269}{26322}Beyond that, there's cardoso|in brazil. you're right.
{26323}{26377}People are ready for this
{26377}{26432}and we're on the|right side ohistory.
{26433}{26497}It's a sladunk.
{26547}{26608}He understands the|limitations of power,
{26609}{26637}of what can be accomplished,
{26638}{26688}he just refuses to|be limited by them.
{26689}{26768}He's a visionary, a true visionary.
{26769}{26842}Well, before you develop|too much of a crush,
{26843}{26899}it's also worth remembering|that this visionary is
{26900}{26956}also the first president|of the united states
{26956}{27009}to be up on a sexual|harassment charge.
{27010}{27052}No, if you'd been there,|if you'd heard him,
{27053}{27095}you'd understand, you know,|what this could mean
{27096}{27178}- for me, for all of us.|- Well, i wasn't there, was i?
{27179}{27229}I was out entertaining|the visionary's wife.
{27268}{27332}So how was it with the first lady?
{27333}{27379}Oh, fine...
{27380}{27435}Until on the way|back from the theatre
{27436}{27491}she let slip how big her staff is.
{27492}{27541}{y:i}She has her own policy advisors,
{27542}{27593}{y:i}her own chief of staff,
{27594}{27667}a bloody airplane at her disposal,|if you please!
{27667}{27743}Darling, would it help if i sent|jonath out to buy you a filofax?
{27744}{27791}Ha ha.
{27791}{27865}{y:i}- listening to her,|you realize...
{27866}{27925}{y:i}yeah, effectively,|it's a co-presidency.
{27926}{27983}{y:i}He takes her advice on everything.
{27984}{28050}{y:i}- i take yours.|- Oh, bollocks.
{28051}{28089}I mean, it's all|boys' town with you
{28090}{28149}with your jonathans, your alastairs
{28150}{28183}and your gordons.
{28184}{28230}You know, bill clinton|was once asked
{28231}{28304}who would he go to if there|was a crisis in the room.
{28305}{28360}He said his wife.|Now you'd never say that.
{28361}{28419}- yes, i would.|- Rubbish.
{28420}{28511}Whereas they're so tight,|such close collaborators,
{28512}{28581}{y:i}they're effectively running|that country together.
{28626}{28679}I think there's something|quite romantic about it.
{28719}{28798}{y:i}Do you know, when he was|governor of arkansas,
{28799}{28860}the staffers actually referred
{28861}{28926}to them as "biliary. "
{28927}{29018}biliary?
{29018}{29066}"terie"?
{29090}{29151}- "chony"?|- Tony, no no.
{29152}{29187}- you can't get me-|- You can't... - give us a kiss.
{29188}{29222}- no no no no.|- Give us a kiss.
{29222}{29264}Oh, stop it.
{29265}{29314}It's because we're such|tight collaborators.
{29392}{29433}{y:i}Well, that's a great strike...
{29434}{29479}{y:i}what did you get up to today?
{29480}{29570}I was taken to see the newly|renovated globe theatre
{29570}{29643}- by cherie blair.|- Oh, god.
{29644}{29714}What did you do to deserve that?
{29715}{29779}That's what we do,|the wives of great men.
{29780}{29846}Then we had some lunch,|just the two of us.
{29847}{29886}Did you swap stories?
{29887}{29963}Talking about tony and me?|All the things we do that drive you crazy?
{29964}{30005}Your names came up.
{30030}{30072}She ask your advice?
{30073}{30122}I told her to shield her children
{30123}{30170}from the tabloid spotlight|as much as possible
{30171}{30206}and to try to be herself,
{30207}{30274}both of which she will|discover are impossible.
{30275}{30330}She's in kind of a tough spot
{30331}{30386}and she doesn't get much help,|which she whined about a bit.
{30387}{30423}{y:i}That's just the working class.
{30424}{30482}You know she's from liverpool?
{30482}{30554}It's the arkansas of england.
{30554}{30613}She obviously adores him though.
{30614}{30694}Well, he's quite a catch.
{30694}{30744}It's not often you see that.
{30745}{30785}What?
{30786}{30873}{y:i}A couple where the husband is more|attractive than the wife.
{30902}{30960}{y:i}- he is handsome. - blair?|You think so?
{30961}{31026}- well, you don't?|- He's got charm, i guess,
{31026}{31114}but there's something about him.|He's too perfect.
{31146}{31240}So you prefer your man imperfect?
{31241}{31318}{y:i}'cause i hate to disappoint you,|hon,
{31319}{31366}but my mama told me a million times
{31367}{31426}- that i'm just too good to be true.|- Yeah, right.
{31464}{31534}Is there ever a moment when|you're not stuffing that thing?
{31670}{31750}So you continue to practice?|You're not giving up the law?
{31751}{31802}Oh, no, never. i mean,|that's if anyone will bring me cases
{31803}{31849}- now that tony is in #10.|- Oh, that's right.
{31850}{31916}{y:i}- blame it on me. - what did|your predecessor do?
{31917}{31961}{y:i}- norma major?|- Tony: she wrote a book.
{31962}{32014}Oh! umm...
{32015}{32066}The prime minister's country house
{32067}{32106}- and its history. " - perfect.
{32106}{32176}Cherie's going to do one about|downing street. don't laugh.
{32177}{32276}- tony. - can i offer one|piece of serious advice?
{32277}{32335}- if it's not too presumptuous...|- Oh, here we go.
{32336}{32382}- ...or self-aggrandizing?|- Can i make a disclaimer here?
{32383}{32425}- please, feel free to ignore him.|- No. please.
{32426}{32475}- i'd like to hear it.|- Hit the ground running.
{32476}{32521}Now we got off to a bad start,
{32522}{32577}and it's taken us|four years to recover.
{32578}{32630}The other thing is|to start thinking now
{32630}{32678}about what you want|your legacy to be.
{32678}{32721}I've been in office|less than a month,
{32722}{32773}- and you want me to work out my legacy?|- No no no, bill's right.
{32774}{32841}Because if you don't do it,|other people will do it for you.
{32842}{32911}Legacy is reductive. people tend|to remember you for one thing.
{32912}{33009}{y:i}You have to make sure you get ahead|and define what that is.
{33009}{33041}And if you decide|to take up a cause,
{33042}{33100}{y:i}make sure it isn't healthcare.
{33101}{33150}{y:i}And if someone in your first|press conference
{33151}{33197}asks you about gays|in the military,
{33198}{33249}you say nothing!
{33409}{33462}{y:i}People often ask me
{33463}{33507}{y:i}if i'm exhilarated
{33508}{33552}{y:i}by our election victory.
{33553}{33594}{y:i}Of course i'm excited about it,
{33595}{33685}{y:i}but i feel an equally profound|sense of responsibility
{33685}{33735}{y:i}i feel it...
{33736}{33805}{y:i}...perhaps especially about here...
{33806}{33845}{y:i}northern ireland.
{33846}{33924}{y:i}This is not a party|political game.
{33925}{33976}{y:i}It is about life and death|for the people here.
{33977}{34042}{y:i}The people of northern ireland
{34043}{34155}{y:i}have stood up to terrorist|violence for 25 years.
{34156}{34212}{y:i}They have not been|destroyed by it,
{34213}{34303}{y:i}but the legacy of bitterness
{34304}{34370}{y:i}has made the normal political|give and take
{34371}{34428}{y:i}virtually impossible.
{34428}{34534}The i.r.a. and sinn|fein have a choice
{34535}{34606}between negotiations
{34607}{34666}and violence.
{34667}{34758}My message to sinn fein is clear:
{34803}{34879}The settlement train is leaving.
{34909}{34960}I want you on that train,
{34989}{35036}but it is leaving anyway.
{35066}{35143}And i will not allow|it to wait for you.
{35144}{35215}Thank you very much.
{35243}{35293}Thank you very much.
{35294}{35344}{y:i}The search for peace in|northern ireland
{35345}{35390}{y:i}was dealt a devastating blow today
{35391}{35449}{y:i}when the ira murdered two|police officers.
{35450}{35528}{y:i}Two ira gunmen caught them|in a side street.
{35528}{35571}{y:i}It's believed they came|up behind them
{35572}{35654}{y:i}and fired a number of shots into|their heads at close range.
{35655}{35706}{y:i}Man #2: all this after sinn fã©in
{35707}{35761}{y:i}attacked tony blair's|impassioned ultimatum
{35762}{35811}{y:i}for peace as pro-unionist.
{35812}{35861}{y:i}Man #3: gerry adams,|told about the shootings
{35862}{35919}{y:i}at a book signg, said that|on a personal level
{35920}{36024}{y:i}he was shocked but reluctant to comment|on the political fallout.
{36084}{36120}{y:i}How could they do that?
{36121}{36202}{y:i}I merely suggest they enter talks
{36202}{36249}and they kill two people.
{36250}{36315}I mean, maybe i went too far.
{36316}{36380}You said what had to be said
{36381}{36425}and they heard it...
{36425}{36476}The men who murdered those cops.
{36477}{36541}{y:i}That's why they did what they did.
{36541}{36609}{y:i}They're scared. they're scared,
{36609}{36710}{y:i}because after all the decades|of endless back and forth
{36711}{36777}and false starts there's|finally a man in downing street
{36778}{36827}who's not going to put up|with their bullshit anymore.
{36828}{36864}{y:i}Gerry adams assured me
{36865}{36936}that he was ready to|push for a ceasefire,
{36937}{36996}so that sinn fein|could join the talks.
{36996}{37064}{y:i}He knew what i was going to say.
{37065}{37146}And then this, and he says nothing.
{37147}{37180}{y:i}Nothing.
{37181}{37235}Not a word against the|people who killed those men.
{37236}{37269}{y:i}Well, how can i help?
{37270}{37312}{y:i}Do you want me to make|a statement?
{37312}{37360}Well, your advisors|will tell you that
{37360}{37427}there's no mileage in|you involving yourself
{37428}{37472}in the domestic|problems of the u.k.
{37472}{37555}{y:i}Gerry adams owes me.|I gave that guy visas
{37556}{37643}and political legitimacy when you|brits weren't even allowing him on tv.
{37643}{37690}{y:i}Now i want to do this right.
{37691}{37745}{y:i}Why don't have your guys
{37746}{37787}jot down a few ideas,
{37787}{37830}come up with a few lines?
{37831}{37887}{y:i}You'll have them before|you get up.
{38112}{38183}{y:i}Bill on tv: the ira has|claimed responsibility
{38184}{38271}{y:i}for what is ultimately an|outrageous act of cowardice
{38272}{38347}and no one should ever make|the mistake of thinking
{38348}{38398}that actions of this kind represent
{38398}{38449}anything equating to patriotism.
{38450}{38548}{y:i}I, frankly, think now the ball|is in sinn fã©in's court.
{38549}{38648}Everyone has decisions|to make in life.
{38649}{38696}Their decision is,
{38697}{38744}are they going to be part
{38745}{38801}of the peace process or not?
{38802}{38864}{y:i}I hope the answer will be yes.
{38865}{38914}{y:i}Man on tv: good evening.
{38915}{38956}{y:i}The sinn fã©in leader,|gerry adams,
{38957}{39006}{y:i}walked into #10 downing|street today.
{39007}{39072}{y:i}The first such meeting|for 76 years.
{39073}{39122}We had a good meeting|because i think we engaged.
{39123}{39203}I think we faced up|to the difficulties.
{39204}{39306}In many ways the engagement|could be described
{39306}{39367}as a moment in history,|because usually the moments
{39368}{39443}in anglo-irish relationships|in history are bad moments.
{39444}{39486}Today was a significantly|good moment.
{39487}{39573}{y:i}It is thought that president|bill clinton
{39574}{39649}{y:i}helped to revive the peace process|in northern ireland today,
{39650}{39737}{y:i}proving, yet again, the long reach|of his political clout.
{39738}{39786}{y:i}Tony over phone: bill, thank you.
{39786}{39834}My pleasure. happy to help.
{39834}{39887}Sometimes it just takes an outsider
{39888}{39927}to help settle a family dispute.
{39928}{40003}{y:i}Well, i can't thank you enough.
{40004}{40050}After all these months,
{40051}{40119}the peace process is back on track.
{40120}{40184}{y:i}Well, i guess we can jot one down
{40185}{40230}{y:i}for the good guys, eh?
{40230}{40287}Well, we've got a|real shot at this now.
{40288}{40358}And we could never have done|it without your support.
{40359}{40408}Hey, there are no debts here.
{40409}{40507}No i.o.u.s. we're just pulling|together to get a job done.
{40508}{40566}So if there's nothing else,|i've got to go.
{40566}{40621}{y:i}If there's anything anytime...
{40818}{40859}{y:i}man on radio: tonight,|partly cloudy and cool,
{40860}{40901}{y:i}dropping to the mid-upper 50s.
{40902}{40937}{y:i}Weather updated around|the clock...
{41087}{41124}mr. president.
{41343}{41387}Let's go.
{42139}{42221}There's gonna be something in the|news today you should know about.
{42263}{42318}What? what is it?
{42360}{42431}It's not that i don't|know the answer,
{42432}{42494}it's just a very|badly-worded question.
{42525}{42566}And if i did tell you the answer,
{42567}{42640}- you wouldn't learn anything, would you?|- Except cheating.
{42641}{42704}{y:i}- - right, euan,|you've got one more minute on that
{42705}{42761}and that's it. hello....
{42762}{42814}Yeah, are you near a television?
{42815}{42895}{y:i}- tony: yeah.|- Switch on the news.
{42929}{42973}Right. i'll have to|call you back, alastair.
{42974}{43052}- come on, nicky. come on.|- Give it here.
{43052}{43100}{y:i}Man on tv:... taken the|city by storm.
{43101}{43146}This just in from washington.
{43147}{43204}{y:i}Kenneth starr, the independent|counsel investigating
{43205}{43252}{y:i}- alleged criminal conduct...|- Stop drawing pictures and get on with it.
{43253}{43335}{y:i}...of president and mrs.|Clinton in the whitewater affair
{43336}{43400}{y:i}issued a wave of white house|subpoenas today,
{43401}{43479}{y:i}accusing the president of having|sex with monica lewinsky,
{43480}{43548}{y:i}a 23-year-old white house intern.
{43549}{43606}23? she's a child.
{43607}{43660}{y:i}Federal investigators are rumored|to be in possession
{43661}{43731}{y:i}of taped conversations discussing|the alleged affair
{43731}{43807}{y:i}between miss lewinsky and|president clinton.
{43808}{43854}{y:i}The recordings,|in which she refers
{43855}{43943}{y:i}to president clinton as|"the big he" and "the creep,"
{43944}{43984}{y:i}recalling the paula jones case
{43985}{44048}{y:i}in which detailed descriptions|of the president's penis...
{44049}{44091}okay, kids. enough.
{44092}{44148}{y:i}- come on. out.|- Nicky: come on.
{44149}{44202}{y:i}Out, euan.
{44203}{44271}{y:i}- cherie: nick.|- Oh, come on.
{44272}{44326}Come on. come on. come on.|Out out out out out.
{44326}{44371}{y:i}Miss lewinsky is also|rumored to have said
{44372}{44414}{y:i}in one of the taped conversations
{44415}{44468}{y:i}that "i have lied my entire life."
{44469}{44518}{y:i}worse still, lewinsky alleges...
{44519}{44590}this might not be the best time to|be planning a trip to washington.
{44590}{44658}Well, who says any of it is true?
{44659}{44754}If ken starr is involved,|it's probably a right-wing witch hunt,
{44755}{44812}another muckraking exercise.
{44813}{44857}You watch.
{44858}{44909}This story could go away|as quickly as it's broken.
{44910}{44987}The president of america having|sex with a girl half his age?
{44988}{45032}{y:i}Tonight, the president's|own lawyer...
{45033}{45074}{y:i}this story hasn't even started.
{45075}{45119}{y:i}...dismissed the allegations as|mischievous invention.
{45174}{45240}Okay, well, how-|how do you know this girl?
{45275}{45365}She was interning in the west|wing a couple of years ago.
{45365}{45420}- yeah.|- I talked to her a few times.
{45421}{45472}She said she was looking for a job
{45473}{45518}and, you know me,|i offered to help.
{45519}{45589}I gave her a couple of names|of people she could talk to.
{45590}{45641}I was just trying to be nice,
{45642}{45753}but apparently she seemed to|think it was something more.
{45753}{45799}She thought... she thought|it was more, why?
{45800}{45841}Why... why on earth|would she think that?
{45842}{45884}Well, i don't know.
{45885}{45944}You know how it is,
{45945}{45993}how people are around me.
{45993}{46064}So you're telling me that you did|nothing that could be misinterpreted?
{46065}{46117}{y:i}- no. no.|- Nothing that could be misread?
{46117}{46149}- no|- Nothing?
{46150}{46201}Nothing. i swear.
{46269}{46311}{y:i}Now the way they tell it,
{46312}{46405}i was having sex in the|oval office, midday.
{46405}{46474}{y:i}- oh, for heaven's sake.|- Yeah, you know that's ridiculous.
{46475}{46527}{y:i}With all the guards and the|windows around there,
{46528}{46573}that's not gonna happen.
{46606}{46646}These people...
{46647}{46693}This is just all the same bullshit.
{46693}{46738}They think they can put|something in the paper
{46739}{46808}and that just makes it true.|The same old innuendo.
{46809}{46877}The same old digging for dirt|when there's nothing there.
{46877}{46938}Ken starr is gonna go after you
{46939}{46996}with everything he's got.
{47174}{47237}They're discussing his|penis in public now...
{47238}{47308}"five and a ha inches with a|curve in the middle when erect."
{47309}{47344}hardly errol flynn, is it?
{47345}{47391}I wonder who's angrier|with him now...
{47392}{47430}His wife for his betrayals
{47431}{47493}or his press secretary|for his modest endowment?
{47494}{47549}Now had it been 8"|long and thick as a baguette...
{47550}{47589}Oh, for god's sake, shut up.
{47590}{47624}A little irritable today,|aren't we?
{47625}{47717}I am. why do these european summits
{47717}{47758}always fill one with gloom?
{47759}{47802}Because they're full of pompous,|irrelevant twats
{47803}{47856}with stupid accents who|are stuck in the past
{47857}{47921}- and never know when to shut up.|- That would be the reason then.
{47922}{47993}Plus events in washington will|dominate all the front pages now.
{47994}{48038}Which makes the whole thing|feel rather pointless.
{48039}{48107}Sir. morning, sir.
{48108}{48157}The list you asked for|on the current members
{48157}{48214}of the european commission|and their staffs.
{48215}{48265}Thank you.
{48346}{48391}Who is she?
{48392}{48465}A new intern from|the foreign office.
{48606}{48661}You should know the tapes|of lewinsky's conversation,
{48661}{48700}her phone calls that are|supposed to be out there...
{48701}{48741}Well, are they out there or not?
{48741}{48805}Well, it's an ongoing|investigation. it's...
{48805}{48859}The information's privileged.|There's no way we can...
{48860}{48920}Fine, so these tapes that may|or may not be out there...
{48921}{48957}Yes, well, it's been suggested
{48957}{49043}they contain certain|revelations about...
{49044}{49131}{y:i}the president's voicemails|to miss lewinsky,
{49132}{49189}{y:i}an exchange of gifts,
{49189}{49268}his... his preference for oral sex
{49269}{49341}and the supposed existence
{49341}{49396}of a dress with semen stains.
{49397}{49443}That's enough.
{49534}{49578}Whether these...
{49579}{49652}{y:i}tapes are out there or not,
{49653}{49713}it's a "he said, she said. "
{49714}{49756}we have a starstruck intern versus
{49757}{49821}the president of the united states.|They've got nothing.
{49821}{49869}Now the best way for|us to turn the tables,
{49870}{49935}to stop this being personal,|is to make it political,
{49936}{50024}because i'm not gonna conduct a|public debate about my marriage.
{50025}{50101}I want to conduct a debate|about the right-wing media
{50102}{50144}and ken fucking starr,
{50145}{50226}because they have been on our|backs right from the begning.
{50310}{50361}So this is what we're gonna do.
{50362}{50420}{y:i}Man on tv: the white house|said to bin crisis mode,
{50421}{50467}{y:i}with one administration... - woman:...|inside politics
{50468}{50538}{y:i}as mr. clinton prepares to give another|state of the union address.
{50539}{50589}{y:i}Man #2:...the prosecutor puts the|pressure on the white house intern.
{50589}{50633}White house scandal is
{50633}{50676}{y:i}already the biggest soap|opera running
{50677}{50734}{y:i}and the viewers show no|sign of tuning out.
{50735}{50801}But i want to say one thing|to the american people,
{50802}{50847}and i want you to listen to me.
{50848}{50892}I'm gonna say this again:
{50893}{50957}I did not have
{50958}{51020}sexual relations with that woman...
{51021}{51053}Miss lewinsky.
{51053}{51153}{y:i}These allegations are false.
{51153}{51235}{y:i}Now i need to go back to work|for the american people.
{51236}{51292}{y:i}- thank you. - matt lauer:|There's been one subject
{51293}{51336}{y:i}in particular weighing|on the minds
{51337}{51417}{y:i}of the american public-|the alleged sexual relationship
{51418}{51470}{y:i}between the president and|miss lewinsky.
{51471}{51516}{y:i}Has your husband explained|the nature
{51516}{51563}{y:i}of this relationship to|you in detail?
{51564}{51611}Well, we've talked at great length
{51612}{51687}and i think as this matter unfolds
{51688}{51753}the entire country will|have more information.
{51754}{51801}But we're right in the middle
{51802}{51869}of a rather vigorous|feeding frenzy right now.
{51870}{51968}{y:i}And i have learned over these|last many years,
{51968}{52006}{y:i}being involved in politics,
{52007}{52068}that the best thing|to do in these cases
{52068}{52117}is just to be patient,
{52118}{52168}take a deep breath
{52168}{52225}and the truth will come out.
{52226}{52280}But there's nothing we can|dto fight this firestorm
{52281}{52363}of allegations that are out there.
{52364}{52418}{y:i}Do you think that your|husband would admit
{52419}{52459}{y:i}again causing pain in|your marriage?
{52460}{52530}No, absolutely not|and he shouldn't.
{52531}{52600}You know, we've been|married for 22 years,
{52601}{52680}{y:i}and i had learned a long time ago
{52681}{52751}that the only people who|count in any marriage
{52752}{52792}are the two that are in it.
{52793}{52906}{y:i}And i guess i've just been|through it so many times.
{52907}{52988}I mean, bill and i have|been accused of everything,
{52989}{53029}including murder,
{53030}{53087}by some of the very same people
{53088}{53143}who are behind these allegations.
{53143}{53189}{y:i}The great story here,
{53190}{53242}{y:i}for anybody willing to find it,
{53243}{53294}write about it and explain it,
{53295}{53404}is this vast right-wing conspiracy
{53405}{53463}that has been conspiring|against my husband
{53464}{53507}since the day he|announced for president.
{53508}{53623}{y:i}A few journalists have kind of caught|onto it and explained it,
{53624}{53679}{y:i}but it has not yet been|fully revealed
{53679}{53714}to the american public
{53715}{53805}and actually, you know,|in a bizarre sort of way,
{53806}{53866}this may do it.
{55110}{55146}You know, the longer this goes on,
{55147}{55182}the worse it is for clinton.
{55183}{55250}I wonder whether we might not|want to take a step back.
{55250}{55344}I'm on my way to washington to do a|press conference with the man, jonathan.
{55345}{55408}It may be a little late in|the day for a step back.
{55409}{55461}Come on, let's be realistic here.
{55462}{55516}He's hardly bloody|milosevic, is he?
{55584}{55628}What he did or did not do
{55629}{55674}{y:i}is a personal matter.
{55674}{55742}Public people are entitled|to private lives, alastair.
{55743}{55790}There's nothing private about his.
{55790}{55837}It doesn't affect his ability|to govern though, does it?
{55838}{55905}Not to mention he's a friend.
{55906}{55979}{y:i}Tony, all political friendship is|strategic and conditional.
{55980}{56054}A slight cooling may|be no bad thing.
{56054}{56122}What? backff from the|"special relationship"
{56123}{56168}we've all been so keen to promote?
{56169}{56251}No, not back off. just re-evaluate.
{56339}{56400}And if there is any|truth to the story,
{56401}{56462}they're in so deep|they'll never get out.
{56462}{56499}{y:i}Well, he can hardly come clean,|can he?
{56500}{56555}America elected him,|knowing his history with women.
{56556}{56641}If he did do it, he should make a|big public apology and move on.
{56642}{56702}No, his lawyers would hate that idea.|They probably see it as a chance
{56703}{56758}to tough it out on definition and|hope that they'll all go away.
{56759}{56816}Would you if you|were defending him?
{56817}{56876}Who? the big creep?
{56877}{56924}I suppose it comes down
{56925}{56997}to what you actually|think constitutes "sex."
{56998}{57059}{y:i}that's easy... it's intercourse,|penetration.
{57060}{57105}What, so blowjobs don't count?
{57106}{57170}- no.|- No.
{57195}{57234}God. you men are pathetic.
{57235}{57285}Come on, you know the deal...
{57286}{57347}- eating ain't cheating.|- Oh, that's disgusting.
{57348}{57398}{y:i}- if it ain't in, it ain't a sin.|- Jonathan: apparently
{57398}{57446}{y:i}there's even a passage in the|bible that supports it.
{57446}{57504}{y:i}- supports what?|- Jonathan: the idea that
{57505}{57575}oral sex doesn't|constitute adultery.
{57576}{57633}- bollocks!|- Really?
{57634}{57724}Ecclesiastes. discovered by|clinton's rapid response team.
{57725}{57762}God, they're good.
{57763}{57816}{y:i}It's hardly bloody|fidelity either!
{57817}{57883}I mean, organs from one person's|body have entered another.
{57884}{57945}How can that not be sex?
{57946}{58006}Huh. god, this language.
{58007}{58073}This is just bizarre.|I mean, technically,
{58074}{58130}what we're doing is having a|political conversation here,
{58131}{58202}but it's just... blue.
{58203}{58283}Yesterday c.n.n.|Put out an announcement
{58284}{58334}before their nightly news bulletin
{58335}{58425}warning parents the content might|not be appropriate for children.
{58426}{58529}- god. - which brings us back|to the original question:
{58530}{58617}Shouldn't we be thinking|about taking a step back?
{58698}{58756}{y:i}Man on tv: all eyes today|will be on tony blair
{58757}{58806}{y:i}as he flies into a political storm
{58807}{58877}{y:i}the likes of which hasn't been seen|since the watergate affair.
{58877}{58925}{y:i}With his back against the wall,|bill clinton may benefit
{58926}{58984}{y:i}from his close connection with the|british prime minister,
{58985}{59038}{y:i}who is widely admired in|the united states.
{59039}{59097}{y:i}It is likely the official|agenda for the meeting
{59098}{59143}{y:i}between the president and|prime minister
{59144}{59183}{y:i}will be pushed aside for questions
{59184}{59221}{y:i}about bill clinton's relationship
{59222}{59290}{y:i}with a former white house intern.
{59605}{59645}There's an article in tomorrow's
{59646}{59733}"new york times" that suggests|clinton coacd his secretary
{59733}{59787}to lie about his|relationship with lewinsky.
{59831}{59881}If that's true, then it implies
{59882}{59928}he did lie in the|paula jones hearing
{59929}{60001}and he did lean on lewinsky|to lie in her affidavit.
{60002}{60090}Infidelity by a|president is one thing.
{60091}{60173}Perjury is quite another.
{60200}{60263}{y:i}-|he's here.
{60264}{60322}{y:i}Let me see those numbers|straightaway.
{60323}{60364}{y:i}Man #2: yes, sir.
{60425}{60503}Tony, sorry to put|you through this.
{60504}{60563}- not at all.|- We'll get through it.
{60625}{60661}{y:i}Man #3: ladies and gentlemen,
{60662}{60702}{y:i}the president of the united states
{60703}{60780}{y:i}and the prime minister of great|britain and northern ireland.
{60914}{60981}Let me just start by saying|that it's a real pleasure
{60982}{61041}to welcome prime minister|blair here to washington.
{61042}{61112}Today on the verge|of a new century,
{61113}{61203}a new millennium,|america is prouder than ever
{61204}{61265}to stand shoulder to shoulder|with its close friend
{61266}{61307}{y:i}the united kingdom.
{61308}{61349}{y:i}It continues a great tradition
{61350}{61430}{y:i}and a special relationship|between our two countries.
{61431}{61478}Mr. president. mr. president.
{61479}{61525}- eric.|- Prime minister,
{61526}{61609}as a friend and as a religious man,
{61610}{61655}i was wondering whether you offered
{61656}{61714}{y:i}your personal advice to|president clinton
{61715}{61761}during these difficult times
{61762}{61848}of criminal investigation|into his sexual behavior.
{61876}{61908}That's what, in the british media,
{61909}{61977}we call a helpful question.
{61978}{62020}Uh, no.
{62046}{62086}Michael.
{62087}{62138}Prime minister, some people|are struck by the warmth
{62139}{62182}of the personal statements of|support that you've been giving
{62183}{62254}{y:i}to the president. can i ask|had you ever considered
{62255}{62314}that might be a politically|risky strategy?
{62490}{62568}You heard the president talking
{62569}{62620}about the special relationship
{62621}{62654}between our two countries
{62655}{62718}and the great tradition of standing
{62719}{62766}shoulder to shoulder|with one another,
{62767}{62864}and i'm reminded of a story|from the height of world war ii,
{62865}{62952}when britain desperately|needed america's help.
{62953}{63061}It wasn't always certain that|they would come to our help,
{63062}{63123}and at one point harry hopkins,
{63124}{63218}the emissary to the american president|roosevelt, was sent to britain.
{63218}{63283}Hopkins said to churchill,|"i suppose you wish to know
{63284}{63344}what i'll be saying to president|roosevelt on my return."
{63389}{63446}well, he said he would be quoting
{63446}{63504}from a passage from the bible:
{63541}{63620}"whither thou goest, i will go;
{63621}{63711}Whither thou lodgest, i will lodge.
{63712}{63802}Thy people shall be my people,
{63802}{63924}and thy god my god,|even to the end."
{63989}{64098}you just asked whether my support,|my friendship,
{64099}{64149}{y:i}is a politically risky strategy?
{64150}{64216}I've worked with president clinton
{64217}{64241}for some nine months.
{64242}{64279}I have found him throughout
{64280}{64355}{y:i}someone i could trust,|someone i could rely upon,
{64356}{64461}someone i am proud to|call not just a colleague,
{64462}{64498}but a friend.
{64498}{64566}{y:i}And i happen to think that if you|look at the american economy,
{64567}{64620}if you look at the respect
{64621}{64688}with which america is held|right round the world today,
{64689}{64774}it's a pretty impressive|record for anyone.
{64775}{64826}- reporters: prime minister. - mr.|President. mr. president.
{64826}{64884}Do you appreciate mr.|Blair's support?
{64885}{64937}No. no.
{64976}{65018}I think he should have|just come over here
{65018}{65056}{y:i}- and jumped all over me.|- Mr. president.
{65057}{65146}{y:i}- thank you. - mr. president.|Mr. president.
{65292}{65354}I hope you worked out|what you want in return,
{65392}{65430}because you saved that man today.
{65430}{65470}He owes you big time.
{65471}{65522}Who says i want|something in return?
{65523}{65609}Well, if you don't, it makes what|you did even harder to understand.
{65610}{65676}I did it because i like him.
{65677}{65743}And because now he owes you.
{65744}{65852}And because i believe in|what he's trying to do,
{65852}{65910}what we can do together.
{65911}{65973}And because now he owes you.
{65974}{66079}Well, is there anything|wrong with that?
{66301}{66367}{y:i}We've been on borrowed|time in the balkans.
{66367}{66407}Milosevic is playing us for fools.
{66408}{66456}{y:i}Bill over phone: we should|have seen this coming.
{66499}{66587}We got milosevic to the|negotiating table over bosnia
{66587}{66666}by agreeing that kosovo was an|internal matter for the serbs,
{66667}{66715}and now he thinks that|he can do what he wants.
{66716}{66773}{y:i}And by the time the un is|finished arguing
{66774}{66819}{y:i}over the finer points of|international law,
{66820}{66886}milosevic will have killed|another 250,000 people
{66887}{66931}and driven another two|million from their homes,
{66932}{66975}just like he did in bosnia.
{66976}{67038}Now that's not going to happen,|not on my watch.
{67039}{67113}John major acted too slowly|and too reluctantly on bosnia.
{67114}{67163}This government's not going|to make the same mistake.
{67164}{67243}Yes, we have to make|our case to the u.n.
{67244}{67285}That the serbs are|guilty of genocide,
{67286}{67331}but at the same time|we've got to come up
{67331}{67384}with a credible threat|to stop milosevic.
{67385}{67473}{y:i}You and madeleine albright are|preaching from the same pulpit.
{67474}{67526}So where do we go from here?
{67527}{67605}{y:i}We start with the full range|of economic sanctions,
{67606}{67644}work to get nato on board
{67645}{67711}and consider our military options.
{67712}{67766}What about the russians?
{67767}{67812}{y:i}Well, you just leave the|russians to me.
{67813}{67895}Boris... he's going to kick and|scream just like he did over bosnia,
{67896}{67955}but we just gave him|$5 billion in aid,
{67956}{68003}so i've got a little|leverage there.
{68004}{68066}I'm more concerned about europe.
{68067}{68135}Well, the italians will be|against any action for a start,
{68136}{68222}{y:i}- as will the germane.|- What about the french?
{68223}{68279}Chirac will want to|play by the book.
{68280}{68330}{y:i}He'll do nothing without|the full support
{68331}{68375}{y:i}of the international community.
{68376}{68447}You've got the perfect forum there.
{68448}{68547}Presidency of the e.u.|For another three months.
{68548}{68603}It hasn't made any|difference so far.
{68604}{68698}You can be very persuasive, tony.
{68699}{68756}You know, i've a theory.|You can take any word
{68757}{68797}in the english language|that excites you,
{68798}{68873}like sex, food, music or money,
{68874}{68942}and completely remove|any pleasure it arouses
{68942}{69006}simply by adding|the prefix "euro. "...
{69271}{69336}{y:i}good morning, jacques.
{69337}{69419}Perhaps you could enlighten us?|We've been struggling with a small,
{69420}{69470}but i think important,|technicality.
{69471}{69552}- of course. happy to help.|- Exactly how many centimeters
{69553}{69619}is five and a half inches?
{69797}{69844}You'd think some of these guys|would actually step to his defense.
{69845}{69921}As leaders, we're all hanging|from the same thin thread.
{69922}{70016}But the joy of seeing an|american president slip up...
{70017}{70085}It's irresistible.
{70086}{70137}{y:i}Man over tv: the pressure on|bill clinton to testify
{70138}{70189}{y:i}before the grand jury|intensified today
{70190}{70234}{y:i}with the announcement of a deal
{70235}{70280}{y:i}between monica lewinsky|and kenneth starr.
{70281}{70329}{y:i}Under total immunity,|monica lewinsky is
{70330}{70376}{y:i}is reportedly telling prosecutors
{70376}{70450}{y:i}she and the president talked about how|to conceal their relationship.
{70451}{70516}{y:i}This is what the president is|desperate to avoid...
{70516}{70552}{y:i}the indignity of appearing
{70553}{70600}{y:i}at a federal courthouse|in washington.
{70600}{70696}{y:i}The special prosecutor, kenneth starr,|is playing a tough game.
{70697}{70766}{y:i}He is determined to question the|president under oath,
{70767}{70847}{y:i}and he is backed by mr. clinton's|republican opponents in congress.
{70848}{70887}Get me kendall.
{70888}{70940}If kenneth starr does have|additional information,
{70940}{70988}i think it could snowball
{70989}{71049}into a real impeachment|problem for the president.
{71050}{71092}{y:i}Man #2: i have a very|strong belief...
{71092}{71136}tell them i'll testify,
{71176}{71223}but i want the subpoena revoked,
{71224}{71296}{y:i}i'd like to have my|lawyers present
{71323}{71390}and we do it in the white house.
{71423}{71469}{y:i}First reports now suggest
{71469}{71523}{y:i}that monica lewinsky has|changed her story
{71524}{71569}{y:i}to admit there was an affair
{71570}{71629}{y:i}and has even turned over to|the special prosecutor
{71630}{71674}{y:i}tapes of phone calls|from the president
{71675}{71728}{y:i}and a dress, possibly stained,
{71729}{71786}{y:i}that may help prove the|relationship.
{71786}{71834}{y:i}Today her lawyer denied|that information
{71834}{71926}{y:i}about the dress had been leaked either|by him or her other lawyer.
{71926}{72014}{y:i}The white house claims much of this|is unsubstantiated rumor,
{72014}{72069}{y:i}but the fbi confirmed to me today
{72070}{72128}{y:i}it has received the dress|from kenneth starr
{72129}{72182}{y:i}and is processing it for testing.
{72481}{72527}Are you awake?
{72645}{72689}I am now.
{72769}{72812}I need to...
{72813}{72881}Tell you about the situation.
{72940}{73019}It's much more serious|than i let on.
{73077}{73128}What?
{73198}{73272}I'm going to say in my testimony
{73337}{73429}that there... was something
{73430}{73488}inappropriate
{73489}{73548}about that relationship.
{73636}{73683}{y:i}Bill on tv: in deposition|last january
{73684}{73737}{y:i}i was asked questions about|my relationship
{73738}{73787}{y:i}with monica lewinsky.
{73788}{73840}{y:i}While my answers were|legally accurate,
{73841}{73909}i did not volunteer information.
{73909}{73957}Indeed, i did have a relationship
{73957}{74017}with miss lewinsky that|was not appropriate.
{74018}{74085}In fact... - i'd like|to know the distinction
{74085}{74141}between "legally accurate"|and "big fucking lie."
{74142}{74241}i can only tell you i was|motivated by many factors.
{74241}{74318}First, by a desire|to protect myself
{74319}{74380}from the embarrassment|of my own conduct.
{74381}{74438}I was also very concerned
{74439}{74482}about protecting my family.
{74483}{74545}{y:i}The fact that these questions|were being asked...
{74546}{74597}what a you gonna say?
{74622}{74673}I don't know.
{74674}{74733}Maybe nothing.
{74733}{74809}Well, they'll be|expecting a statement.
{74810}{74861}Saying what?
{74862}{74923}That i am all too aware thh
{74924}{74985}because of my public|support for the president?
{74986}{75088}That i find all this|excruciatingly embarrassing?
{75089}{75177}That i feel i had no|option but to stand by him?
{75202}{75247}I think not.
{75294}{75374}{y:i}Our country has been distracted by|this matter for too long,
{75375}{75437}{y:i}and i take responsibility|for my part...
{75437}{75487}do you think she'll ever leave him?
{75538}{75593}Would you leave me?
{75644}{75686}No.
{75687}{75729}But i'd make your life hell.
{75730}{75771}{y:i}...real problems to solve,
{75772}{75833}{y:i}real security matters to face.
{75834}{75909}{y:i}And so tonight i ask|you to turn away...
{75910}{75980}{y:i}- - ...|from the spectacle of the past seven months,
{75981}{76049}{y:i}to repair the fabric of our|national discourse
{76049}{76128}and to return our attention|to all the challenges
{76129}{76188}and all the promise of the|next american century.
{76189}{76274}{y:i}Thank you for watching|and good night.
{76857}{76906}How do you wanna do this?
{76907}{76980}You first, me a few steps behind?
{77047}{77090}Together?
{77135}{77194}I want us to do this together.
{77261}{77328}Whether or not that's possible,|i don't know.
{77398}{77485}I have to find my way|through this in my own time.
{77569}{77651}By myself. okay?
{77673}{77710}Okay.
{78085}{78129}How do i look?
{78173}{78220}Incredible.
{78342}{78391}{y:i}- man: mrs. clinton?|- Reporters: mrs. clinton?
{78392}{78454}{y:i}- man #2: hillary, one picture.|- Man #3: this way, ma'am.
{78623}{78693}- so what are his chances?|- Of surviving impeachment?
{78693}{78742}I'd say 50/50 at best.
{78743}{78791}His approval rating's gone|right down the toilet.
{78792}{78826}Even if he does survive,|his party will take
{78827}{78884}such a pounding in the mid-terms,|he'll be gridlocked.
{78884}{78932}He's a lame-duck president.
{78932}{79012}Which, of course, presents the|chance for others to shine.
{79012}{79070}Well, he's still our strongest ally
{79071}{79136}and the best hope we've got of|seeing things through in kosovo.
{79136}{79238}Evil triumphs when|good men do nothing.
{79239}{79285}We can all sit here,|throw our hands up and say,
{79286}{79358}"what does what's happening|in kosovo have to do with us?"
{79359}{79444}{y:i}ethnic cleansing, systematic rape,
{79444}{79502}{y:i}mass murder.
{79503}{79568}{y:i}No one in the west who has seen
{79569}{79624}{y:i}what is happening in|kosovo can doubt
{79624}{79700}{y:i}that nato's military|action is justified.
{79701}{79790}{y:i}20 years ago we would not have|been fighting in kosovo.
{79791}{79845}{y:i}We would have tued our|backs on it.
{79846}{79890}But we are a community.
{79891}{79930}What happens in one part of europe
{79931}{79979}affects every other part.
{79980}{80019}And there is only one place to be
{80020}{80088}and that's in the thick of it,|trying to sort it out.
{80089}{80167}{y:i}Woman on tv: following a further|upsurge in violence,
{80167}{80228}{y:i}the un security council|issued a resolution
{80229}{80291}{y:i}demanding an end to serbian|action in kosovo
{80291}{80359}{y:i}and putting 500 aircraft|under wesley clark,
{80359}{80394}{y:i}nato's supreme commander.
{80395}{80441}{y:i}Faced with the threat of|a unified nato,
{80442}{80487}{y:i}slobodan milosevic has|backed down.
{80488}{80552}{y:i}Woman #2: president clinton's personal|envoy, richard holbrook,
{80553}{80619}{y:i}has negotiated a ceasefire with|the yugoslav president
{80620}{80679}{y:i}who has agreed to reduce|troop numbers
{80679}{80774}{y:i}and to allow 2,000 unarmed|observers into the province.
{80775}{80811}It's not enough, bill.
{80811}{80880}Nate's agreement could|fall apart at any second.
{80881}{80946}The russians are only going along|with it to keep up appearances.
{80947}{81001}Milosevic isn't|fooled by any of it.
{81002}{81068}Well, look at you, baby brother,|stepping up to the big roulette table.
{81069}{81133}{y:i}He's just waiting us out.
{81134}{81172}{y:i}Meanwhile, winter is coming
{81173}{81233}{y:i}and hundreds of thousands|of displaced people
{81234}{81272}need to get back to their villages.
{81273}{81330}{y:i}As far as i can tell,|the ceasefire is holding.
{81331}{81392}We've got observers on the|ground watching his every move.
{81393}{81453}{y:i}He tries anything... - yeah, but look|what he's done to his own people.
{81454}{81525}Do you think he cares about a bunch of|observers without a gun between them?
{81526}{81577}It's just a matter of time.
{81578}{81650}What do you want me to say, tony?
{81674}{81722}Well...
{81722}{81800}Unless we back up the|threat of air strikes
{81801}{81863}with a willingness to|put men on the ground,
{81864}{81922}i just... i just don't see
{81922}{81958}how he can take us seriously.
{81959}{82030}{y:i}Look, i hate milosevic as|much as the next guy,
{82031}{82104}but sending troops|into a sovereign state
{82105}{82170}that hasn't attacked us?|Now that's a pretty tough sell
{82171}{82226}to congress and the|american people,
{82226}{82272}and i like to think i'm|a pretty good salesman!
{82273}{82330}{y:i}Bill, if... - i know why|you want to do this.
{82330}{82374}{y:i}I understand your ambition.
{82375}{82420}You want to take a step up,
{82421}{82481}but that dog just won't hunt.
{82482}{82529}I want to do it because|it's the right thing to do.
{82530}{82577}{y:i}We both want to do the right thing
{82578}{82634}and mobilizing nato so|it's ready to strike
{82635}{82672}{y:i}- is the right thing to do.|- Yeah, but bill...
{82673}{82717}{y:i}in case you haven't noticed,
{82718}{82769}there is a bookoos|of people over here
{82770}{82831}{y:i}- looking to get me impeached.|- Yes, i'm very much aware of that.
{82832}{82881}Look, if we don't do this now,
{82882}{82942}i guarantee we'll be|forced to do it later.
{82943}{82985}{y:i}Let me be clear:
{82986}{83056}Until milosevic does|something that proves
{83057}{83126}he violates the deal on the table,|we do nothing.
{83521}{83561}You can hardly be surprised.
{83562}{83619}Politically, his hands are tied.
{83620}{83657}Yeah, maybe physically too,
{83657}{83691}if hillary's got|anything to do with it.
{83692}{83728}But he's the one who|talked about legacy.
{83729}{83769}I mean, it could really|help to sort things out
{83769}{83822}if he did the right|thing over this.
{83823}{83870}Being seen to be doing something
{83871}{83937}{y:i}is completely different to|actually doing it.
{83938}{83986}Thatcher always said,
{83987}{84032}"no point being here|if we don't do things,
{84033}{84099}- big things." - please don't|start again on thatcher.
{84133}{84181}The lives of those|people depend on the whim
{84182}{84257}of an insane tyrant and we|have the power to change that.
{84257}{84316}And if bill won't or can't,
{84317}{84381}then it's up to me, isn't it?
{84522}{84585}Right. come on, winston.
{84611}{84655}Parents' evening.
{84722}{84764}Thank you, marcus.
{84765}{84821}What's the math|teacher's name again?
{84821}{84853}Humberstone, paul.
{84959}{85046}- hello, good to see you.|- Hello, headmaster.
{85047}{85105}{y:i}Woman on tv: on a hillside|above the village
{85106}{85144}{y:i}of racak in kosovo...
{85145}{85236}{y:i}45 people hacked to death by|serbian paramilitaries
{85237}{85291}right under the noses|of the observers.
{85292}{85334}{y:i}I know. i saw the news.
{85335}{85392}{y:i}Every station in the world is|showing the same footage.
{85393}{85458}{y:i}We've got to stop fiddling|around the edges
{85459}{85510}{y:i}and prove to milosevic that|we mean business.
{85511}{85597}If we don't, there's going to be|more massacres, more refugees.
{85598}{85652}{y:i}The people over here,|they just don't get that.
{85652}{85699}{y:i}All they want to know is,
{85700}{85764}is this a war america|should be fighting?
{85765}{85844}If we do go in,|bomb the hell out of milosevic,
{85844}{85884}{y:i}what happens if all we|wind up doing is
{85885}{85966}{y:i}pissing him off and he ramps up|his assault on kosovo?
{85967}{86081}{y:i}We don't even have a grantee,|if nato does go in,
{86082}{86132}air strikes are going to do any go.
{86133}{86202}How long are you going to|keep going arou on this?
{86235}{86316}Til you tell me it's|the right thing to do.
{86368}{86416}It's the right thing to do
{86448}{86528}and you don't need|me to tell you that.
{86528}{86569}No.
{86615}{86661}But it sure does|make me feel better
{86662}{86720}hearing you say it.
{86720}{86772}{y:i}Man on tv: the serbs say they shot
{86773}{86840}{y:i}several dozen terrorists|in uniform,
{86840}{86907}{y:i}but these men wear no uniform...
{86908}{87006}{y:i}...and receive no hearing from the|police who separated them...
{87007}{87073}{y:i}- hello? - bill: are|you watching this?
{87074}{87122}I am.
{87123}{87185}{y:i}Because this shit is bad.
{87186}{87240}Yes, it is.
{87241}{87334}Okay, bombing from 15,000'.
{87335}{87404}I'll tell my guys to|tell nato we're in.
{87405}{87482}{y:i}Man on tv:...to find|their loved ones. -
{87529}{87599}{y:i}"look what they've done," she cries.|"it's a massacre."
{87600}{87678}{y:i}and the obscene way these men|and boys have died
{87679}{87734}{y:i}is a kind of proof.
{87735}{87792}Get me the secretary|of state for defense
{87792}{87836}and the chief of defense staff.
{87837}{87896}Yes, i know what the time is.
{87897}{87993}{y:i}Man on tv: nato's attack on yugoslavia,|long threatened,
{87994}{88062}{y:i}is tonight under way with|massive force.
{88063}{88124}{y:i}Man #2: the stealth fighter|bombers led the way
{88125}{88158}{y:i}for an attack that has tonight
{88159}{88226}{y:i}put the western alliance at|war with yugoslavia.
{88280}{88345}{y:i}Tony on tv: we have learned twice|before in this century
{88346}{88429}{y:i}that appeasement does not work.
{88430}{88523}If we let an evil dictator|range unchallenged,
{88524}{88564}we will have to spill
{88564}{88636}infinitely more blood and treasure
{88637}{88692}- to stop him later.|- People on tv: hear hear!
{88693}{88756}This is not a battle for territory.
{88756}{88828}{y:i}It is a battle for humanity.
{88829}{88923}{y:i}- it is a just cause.|- Hear hear!
{88924}{88981}{y:i}Woman on tv: in response|to nato air strikes,
{88982}{89052}{y:i}milosevic's forces have stepped|up their campaign
{89052}{89112}{y:i}to drive kosovan albanians|from serbia,
{89112}{89165}{y:i}leaving hundreds of|thousands homeless.
{89166}{89213}Refugees appear, of course,
{89214}{89303}as a result of bombing,|and everybody knows it.
{89304}{89353}{y:i}Man #2: where will you go now?
{89354}{89404}I don't know,
{89405}{89498}but mostly what i would like|is to come back at my home
{89499}{89570}and to live normal like...
{89571}{89660}Like all europeans do,
{89661}{89704}because we are part of europe.
{89705}{89766}{y:i}Today, tony and cherie blair
{89767}{89811}{y:i}came to see the situation|themselves,
{89812}{89884}{y:i}to witness the scale of the|humanitarian crisis
{89885}{89936}{y:i}for which many nations|throughout the world
{89937}{90019}{y:i}are increasingly taking|nato to task.
{90020}{90050}Just to see these people...
{90051}{90097}These completely innocent people,
{90098}{90161}who've been forced|from their homes,
{90162}{90223}mercilessly, at the point of a gun.
{90224}{90271}Some of them,|as we've just been hearing,
{90271}{90361}faced unspeakable horrors.
{90362}{90445}I just feel we have|a duty to ensure
{90446}{90496}that they can return to|their homes in peace.
{90497}{90570}{y:i}Man #3: do you have a message|for the people of kosovo?
{90597}{90691}Well, we will not let you down.
{90717}{90757}{y:i}As civilian casualties
{90758}{90806}{y:i}from nato bombings|continue to mount,
{90806}{90874}{y:i}european leaders are coming|under increasing pressure
{90875}{90938}{y:i}to justify the military campaign|against the serbs.
{90938}{91023}Stop the war! stop the bombing!
{91024}{91118}Nato out! nato out!
{91169}{91214}This is a nightmare.
{91215}{91275}I mean, we've bullied the e.|U. into this
{91276}{91322}and all we've done is|make matters worse.
{91323}{91391}The air campaign|simply isn't working,
{91392}{91426}not as currently configured.
{91427}{91474}It's too half-hearted.
{91475}{91539}The list of approved|targets is too limited.
{91540}{91643}It's done nothing to impede|milosevic's ability to wage war.
{91644}{91706}{y:i}So all we've really done|is rally the serbs.
{91706}{91762}{y:i}Milosevic is looking like a hero,
{91763}{91827}because he stood up to western|aggression and we look like fools.
{91828}{91877}We're losing the p.r.|Campaign, tony, big time.
{91878}{91931}Unless nato is prepared|to step up the bombing
{91932}{91987}and commit to ground troops,|we could lose this thing.
{91988}{92030}Nato will never commit,
{92031}{92080}not without clinton.
{92302}{92370}{y:i}I know you're committed to|intensifying the air campaign,
{92371}{92414}{y:i}but i'm here to ask you
{92415}{92485}to also commit to a ground|invasion into kosovo
{92486}{92568}to resolve this situation|once and for all.
{92598}{92651}Unless we do so
{92652}{92685}i am of the firm opinion
{92686}{92744}that milosevic will|persist in believing
{92745}{92833}that nato will lack the will|to finish what it's started.
{92894}{92980}Strategically, we have two options:
{92981}{93098}The first, a limited|invasion of 80,000 troops
{93099}{93173}that will drive serb|forces out of kosovo
{93173}{93267}and create safe havens|for refugees to return;
{93346}{93429}Secondly, a general|invasion of serbia itself
{93429}{93497}with 200,000 troops,
{93497}{93589}inging about the total overthrow|of the milosevic regime.
{93589}{93653}And actually,|we'd favor the former...
{93654}{93772}A smaller invasion,
{93773}{93856}{y:i}th air units parachuted into-|- Bill: howard.
{93892}{93936}{y:i}If we do what you're suggesting,
{93937}{94006}people will interpret it|as an admission on our part
{94007}{94073}{y:i}of the failure of our|air campaign,
{94074}{94143}so politically it's a|non-starter right there.
{94144}{94192}{y:i}Also, the minute you|put our troops
{94193}{94244}{y:i}into milosevic's territory,
{94245}{94299}you're fighting on his|terms in his backyard,
{94300}{94356}{y:i}handing him a huge advantage.
{94356}{94420}{y:i}With the bombing we keep|our distance,
{94420}{94483}limit the risk, yet still|maintain our advantage.
{94484}{94537}But the bombing's not working.
{94538}{94572}We all know that.
{94572}{94648}{y:i}Plus, even in your|limited-invasion scenario
{94648}{94701}we'd have to call up reservists
{94702}{94780}{y:i}for a conflict in a place most|americans don't know exists.
{94781}{94824}I really don't understand|your hesitancy.
{94824}{94888}We are staring a wholesale|human catastrophe in the face.
{94889}{94965}Are you going to send over as|many troops as you expect us to?
{94966}{95008}Well, that's not possible.
{95009}{95057}As you well know,|given the relative size
{95058}{95111}of our armies, our resources.
{95112}{95160}{y:i}We get the point, prime minister.
{95161}{95235}You're ready to fight|to the last american.
{95308}{95367}We have to win this.
{95404}{95455}{y:i}I've made a promise.
{95496}{95596}Politically, i've really|stuck my neck out here.
{95820}{95878}Why don't we step|outside for a moment?
{95903}{95951}The two of us.
{96423}{96483}Let me get this straight.
{96484}{96542}You want me to spend|billions of dollars
{96543}{96604}of american taxpayer money|and lose american lives?
{96605}{96673}This is a battle|between good and evil,
{96674}{96740}between civilization and barbarity.
{96741}{96790}The intervention and removal
{96842}{96910}{y:i}ourechristiantors responsibility.
{96911}{96950}"christian responsibility"?
{96951}{97009}You know, for a|center-left democrat
{97010}{97074}you're beginning to sound an|awful lot like jerry falwell.
{97075}{97119}And what about the repercussions?
{97119}{97177}Civilian casualties|from a ground campaign
{97178}{97250}could be even greater than those|caused by errant bombs without,
{97251}{97318}in my estimation, enhancing|our prospects for victory.
{97319}{97359}Nothing could have more|serious consequences
{97360}{97437}- than being defeated in kosovo.|- Losing is not an option.
{97438}{97511}{y:i}I am committed to winning|this thing
{97512}{97606}and i will do whatever it takes|to make sure that happens.
{97607}{97675}Now if you want to talk about|sending in ground troops
{97676}{97726}at some future date, fine.
{97727}{97777}But we keep it between ourselves...
{97778}{97814}Off the record.
{97814}{97863}Now, on the record,
{97864}{97928}here's what i'm saying,|so listen up:
{97929}{98003}Nato won't go for ground troops
{98004}{98054}and neither will i.
{98400}{98445}Well, of course they don't care.
{98446}{98506}Half of them don't know|where bloody yugoslavia is.
{98870}{98923}- this could be the end of me.|- Come on.
{98924}{98994}No, i'm serious, alastair.|I'm completely out on a limb here.
{98995}{99068}If we don't win this thing, i'm the|one who's gonna have to answer for it.
{99069}{99145}Why not take clinton up on his|offer to start quietly working
{99146}{99195}on a ground invasion|as an interim measure?
{99196}{99233}Because i don't believe him.
{99234}{99270}He's lied to everybody else,
{99271}{99307}why should he be|telling me the truth?
{99308}{99377}No. no. bollocks to that.
{99378}{99426}It's the chicago|speech tomorrow, right?
{99427}{99488}{y:i}- yeah. - right. well, i want|you to beef it up a bit.
{99489}{99557}I want us to put his back|right up against the wal
{99558}{99621}hang on a minute, tony. are you sure|this is what you want to be doing?
{99622}{99662}This could really backfire on us.
{99663}{99713}And i want every right-wing|hack with an axe to grind
{99714}{99768}{y:i}about the moral bankruptcy|of this administration
{99769}{99824}to be there to hear it-|front row seats.
{100076}{100141}{y:i}No one who has seen what is|happening in kosovo
{100142}{100238}{y:i}can doubt that nato's military|action is justified,
{100239}{100335}{y:i}and that military action|will continue...
{100336}{100438}{y:i}...until milosevic is|defeated absolutely.
{100438}{100517}Success is the only exit strategy
{100518}{100580}i am prepared to consider.
{100581}{100639}We are witnessing the beginnings
{100640}{100712}of a new doctrine of|international community...
{100713}{100789}{y:i}many nations working hand in hand,
{100790}{100882}cooperating on issues|that conont us all.
{100941}{101040}You are the most powerful|country in the world.
{101041}{101132}{y:i}It must be difficult and|occasionally irritating
{101133}{101175}to be the recipient|of every demand,
{101176}{101231}to be called upon in every crisis.
{101232}{101286}The cry "what's it|got to do with us?"
{101286}{101362}must be regularly heard on|the lips of your people.
{101363}{101450}Yet the nations with|the greatest power
{101451}{101529}have the greatest responsibility.
{101530}{101594}{y:i}We need you engaged.
{101595}{101646}I say to you:
{101647}{101688}Never fall again
{101689}{101749}for the dorine of isolationism.
{101749}{101806}The world cannot afford it.
{101807}{101865}{y:i}And realize that in britain
{101866}{101941}{y:i}you have a friend that|will stand with you
{101941}{101993}and fashion with you
{101994}{102045}the design for a future built
{102045}{102105}on peace and prosperity for all,
{102106}{102165}{y:i}which is the only dream
{102165}{102241}that makes humanity|worth preserving.
{102629}{102673}Too slow.
{102717}{102766}Only me.
{102767}{102833}"all hail king tony,|" "chicago tribune."
{102834}{102920}"why don't we have a president like|tony blair? " "the new york times."
{102921}{103022}"blair shows courage while|white house vacillates,"
{103023}{103072}"washington post. "
{103073}{103126}{y:i}"listening to the british|prime minister
{103127}{103181}in chicago last night,|one couldn't help thinking
{103182}{103229}how much president|clinton could learn
{103229}{103310}{y:i}from his churchillian|younger colleague.
{103311}{103376}Both these men talk the talk.
{103377}{103442}The difference is,|behind closed doors,
{103443}{103497}blair actually walks it too. "
{103498}{103566}"wall street journal. "
{103601}{103677}wow. you must've been up|all night writing those.
{103761}{103827}In terms of public approval,
{103866}{103934}you're the number-one leader|in the world right now.
{104002}{104079}{y:i}Man over tv: leaders of the nato powers|convened in washington today
{104080}{104136}{y:i}to debate the worsening|situation in kosovo.
{104137}{104186}{y:i}...speculation as to the|determination of nato
{104187}{104247}{y:i}to stay the course,|with some members suggesting
{104248}{104293}{y:i}they might be having|second thoughts.
{104294}{104358}{y:i}Man #2:...the celebration of|nato's 50th birthday
{104359}{104457}{y:i}but it is expected to be totally given|over to discussions on kosovo.
{104586}{104639}Give the prime minister|and me a moment, will you?
{104640}{104676}Yes, sir.
{104737}{104804}- who would've guessed?|- What?
{104805}{104874}What a tough little son of a|bitch you turned out to be,
{104875}{104924}stabbing me in the back|in my own front yard.
{104925}{104993}- now that takes balls.|- My head was on a block.
{104994}{105059}- you gave me no choice.|- Well, the way i see it,
{105060}{105118}your head's still on the block
{105119}{105193}- and i still have a choice.|- That's not what your papers suggest.
{105194}{105252}Oh, that's right... your new friends.|"all hail king tony."
{105252}{105319}so ground troops? are you in?
{105349}{105409}Maybe you ought to ask|yourself this question:
{105410}{105461}{y:i}What kind of a king begs
{105461}{105500}others to do his fighting for him?
{105501}{105569}Well, if we act now,
{105569}{105631}we can end the fighting.
{105708}{105772}{y:i}Man on tv: with its pledge to|do whatever it takes
{105773}{105811}{y:i}to prevail in kosovo,
{105812}{105906}{y:i}nato agrees to expand its bombing|campaign against serbia.
{105907}{105951}{y:i}Assured by nato's resolve
{105952}{106013}{y:i}and the increasing effectiveness|of the air strikes,
{106014}{106057}{y:i}president clinton|publicly announced
{106058}{106109}{y:i}the us will consider all|military options
{106109}{106197}{y:i}- to resolve the conflict. - woman:|To capitulate is one step closer to fruition.
{106198}{106260}{y:i}Under intense pressure from the|clinton administration,
{106261}{106312}{y:i}a russian delegation|flew to belgrade
{106313}{106367}{y:i}to deliver an ultimatum to|president milosevic...
{106368}{106433}{y:i}"remove all troops from kosovo
{106434}{106492}{y:i}or risk losing the support|of boris yeltsin,"
{106493}{106557}{y:i}his one remaining ally.
{106901}{106945}- right away, sir.|- Thank you.
{107057}{107131}{y:i}Man: this job would become,|in not so many years... -
{107132}{107215}{y:i}...a far more substantial one than|the government now pretends.
{107216}{107256}{y:i}Seen as the president of europe
{107257}{107311}{y:i}by the rest of the world... -
{107472}{107518}tony.
{107519}{107585}The yugoslav parliament|has conceded.
{107586}{107646}All serbian troops are to|be immediately withdrawn.
{107647}{107735}A nato-led peacekeeping force|is to be deployed in the region.
{107736}{107801}Kosovo is to be placed under u.|N. administration.
{107802}{107864}Of course clinton will|claim it was his strategy,
{107865}{107914}that forced milosevic's hand.|We'll claim it was ours,
{107915}{107983}but either way now, it's over.
{107984}{108049}We've won. you've won.
{108377}{108453}This is a victory for civilization.
{108454}{108549}A victory for a|fundamental principle
{108550}{108604}necessary for humanity's progress:
{108605}{108657}That every human being
{108657}{108760}has the inalienable right to|live free from persecution.
{108801}{108888}Milosevic knows and|the world now knows
{108889}{108981}we will not tolerate|racial genocide.
{108981}{109018}Hear hear.
{109019}{109076}Let no one ever doubt again
{109077}{109118}the moral justification
{109119}{109168}for invading another country
{109169}{109230}for humanitarian ends.
{109494}{109585}{y:i}Woman on tv: here on the roads of|kosovo they cheer his name.
{109586}{109671}{y:i}But tony blair was always going|to get a hero's welcome.
{109672}{109724}Tony! tony! tony!
{109761}{109834}{y:i}Man on tv: and indeed those|polls have closed
{109835}{109878}{y:i}and the first lady of the|united states of america,
{109879}{109935}{y:i}hillary rodham clinton,|has defeated
{109936}{109978}{y:i}congressman rick lazio
{109979}{110033}{y:i}and will become the junior|senator from new york.
{110034}{110100}Al gore and george w bush|are men in waiting today.
{110100}{110159}We still don't know who|won the presidency.
{110160}{110210}{y:i}We may not know until tomorrow.
{110211}{110266}{y:i}Woman #2: as controversy|rages in washington,
{110267}{110324}{y:i}president clinton,|accompanied by his wife,
{110324}{110396}{y:i}headed to the british prime|minister's country residence.
{110397}{110455}{y:i}A farewell celebration|between the two men
{110456}{110508}{y:i}whose shared political|philosophy...
{111303}{111368}oh, i'm so sorry.|I really do have to take this.
{111369}{111423}{y:i}- tony: of course.|- What did i get?
{111424}{111473}"environment and public works"?
{111474}{111528}What happened to foreign|relations and budget?
{111528}{111589}{y:i}- those were the things...|- I think i'll turn in.
{111590}{111644}Excuse me.
{111645}{111696}Well, i just can't get over
{111696}{111748}how much those kids have grown.
{111748}{111826}- good night, tony.|- Good night.
{112392}{112430}Bill.
{112472}{112517}While we've...
{112518}{112579}Got a moment, i'd like to...
{112623}{112676}Well, i'd like to apologize to you
{112677}{112732}for what happened over kosovo,
{112733}{112807}briefing against you|in your own media.
{112837}{112904}I was out of order.|In the years i've known you,
{112905}{112955}you've been a good|friend to me, personally,
{112956}{113020}you've been a loyal|friend to my party
{113021}{113071}and a great ally to this country.
{113072}{113134}In the end i got all the credit,
{113135}{113189}credit we should've shared.
{113190}{113227}It was wrong.
{113252}{113292}I was wrong.
{113293}{113350}I'm sorry.
{113351}{113425}That's bullshit.|You don't mean a word of that.
{113468}{113524}- - hey,|you saw the papers
{113524}{113579}the weekend after|milosevic withdrew...
{113580}{113640}Seven out of 10 americans|said they'd like
{113641}{113679}to have tony blair|as their president.
{113680}{113768}{y:i}Handsome, energetic, churchgoing,
{113769}{113867}morally upstanding,|maritally faithful.
{113932}{113985}Are you sure you weren't|born in america?
{113986}{114027}Huh. scotland.
{114028}{114098}Well, that too bad,|'cause you'd win by a landslide.
{114173}{114262}Good evening. the opera,|at times farce, is over.
{114263}{114304}The fat lady has sung.
{114305}{114347}{y:i}The final supreme court verdict
{114348}{114387}{y:i}has persuaded al gore to give up.
{114388}{114450}{y:i}He's finally accepted that|his long legal battle
{114451}{114524}{y:i}- has nowhere else to go.|- Let there be no doubt
{114525}{114611}{y:i}while i strongly disagree|with court's decision,
{114611}{114676}i accept it. and tonight,
{114677}{114719}{y:i}for the sake of our unity|as a people,
{114719}{114769}{y:i}and the strength of our mocracy...
{114770}{114830}{y:i}i offer my concession.
{114875}{114984}Prime minister,|you asked to be woken.
{114985}{115027}Thank you.
{115440}{115510}<i- >- - thanks again. - george w.|Our country has been through
{115511}{115564}a long and trying period,
{115565}{115655}with the outcome of the|presidential election not finalized
{115656}{115730}{y:i}for longer than any of us|could ever imagine.
{115731}{115785}{y:i}- after a difficult election...|- Thanks.
{115786}{115833}{y:i}...we st put politics behind us
{115834}{115911}{y:i}and work together to make the|promise of america
{115912}{115991}{y:i}available for every one|of our citizens.
{115992}{116075}Our nation must rise|above a house divided.
{116075}{116161}Americans share hopes,|goals and values
{116162}{116199}far more important
{116199}{116253}{y:i}than any political disagreements.
{116254}{116333}{y:i}I have a lot to be thankful|for tonight,
{116334}{116403}and thankful to the american|people for the great privilege
{116404}{116456}of being able to serve
{116457}{116503}as your next president.
{116503}{116556}{y:i}-
{116641}{116687}what are you going to do
{116688}{116739}with bush?
{116789}{116839}I know what everyone|wants me to do...
{116840}{116886}Back off,
{116887}{116959}concentrate on domestic politics,
{116960}{117036}deepen ties with europe.
{117037}{117090}That's not what i asked you.
{117091}{117139}{y:i}What do you want to do?
{117181}{117256}I still want to get|things done, bill.
{117257}{117368}And i know he's not on the|same team as us, but...
{117394}{117437}{y:i}i'd rather be in the room
{117438}{117479}where the big decisions|are being made
{117480}{117547}than outside it,|whingeing about them.
{117651}{117737}I would be the senior partner now.
{117738}{117779}Bush would be the junior.
{117780}{117851}I could help him|like you helped me,
{117851}{117909}{y:i}advise him.
{117943}{118003}I just want to do the right|thing for my country.
{118031}{118087}Are you sure about that?
{118115}{118168}It's in my country's|best interests,
{118169}{118206}quite possibly the world's,
{118207}{118250}for me to stay close to|the american president.
{118251}{118313}Well, you can sure|move your bones...
{118314}{118380}Continue to use the white house|to stay in the spotlight,
{118381}{118423}consolidate yourself as leader
{118423}{118462}and expand your legacy.
{118463}{118513}I'm not sure how|to take that, bill.
{118514}{118548}That felt vaguely like an insult.
{118549}{118596}Well, it's true, isn't it?
{118597}{118651}I mean, come on. we both know
{118651}{118700}that the best way to ensure|that you're remembered
{118701}{118740}50 or 100 years from now
{118741}{118806}is to link yourself to|an american president.
{118807}{118879}But be careful.
{118879}{118963}These guys, they play rough.
{118964}{119047}{y:i}Their administration
{119048}{119136}has been born in controversy,|national shame
{119137}{119207}and illegality. and it is my bet
{119208}{119270}that that's the way they'll go out.
{119298}{119379}So the question you|need to ask yourself is
{119379}{119427}what business
{119428}{119494}does a progressive|center-left politician
{119495}{119552}from a tiny little|island in europe have
{119553}{119611}making friends with|folks like that?
{119647}{119691}But then again...
{119691}{119751}{y:i}i'm not sure whether you are
{119751}{119824}a progressive center-left|politician anymore...
{119875}{119931}Or if you ever were.
{120024}{120076}{y:i}I'm gonna say good night.
{120077}{120150}{y:i}I might sleep late.|I hope you don't mind.
{120150}{120197}{y:i}I'm tired. i need the rest.
{120251}{120298}Go ahead.
{120323}{120376}Sleep as long as you like.
{120377}{120459}{y:i}...but to serve one nation.|The president of the united states
{120460}{120509}{y:i}is the president of every|single american.
{120557}{120615}The tower is awaiting our call.
{120853}{120920}{y:i}- 10 minutes, everyone.|- Man #2: are we flight go?
{120921}{120971}{y:i}Yeah, we've got clearance.
{120972}{121025}{y:i}Man #3: clear here?
{121231}{121306}Me too, george. absolutely. me too.
{121461}{121533}Yeah. well...
{121690}{121769}- when are you going to be sworn in?|- In three weeks.
{121770}{121849}After eight years with the|title and no portfolio,
{121850}{121896}finally you'll have both.
{121896}{121956}Let me know what it's like...
{121956}{122000}Waking in the morning,
{122001}{122057}knowing that you're|speaking for yourself.
{122058}{122130}- i will.|- In you go, senator!
{122131}{122179}Oh, bill. for heaven's sakes.
{122180}{122223}Just practicing, hon.
{122224}{122260}{y:i}Isn't she something?
{122261}{122336}Only first lady in u.s.|History to win elected office.
{122337}{122402}Euan, kathryn, behind the wall.
{122403}{122440}- right, that's it.|- Up you go.
{122440}{122508}{y:i}Back into the house,|because if you're...
{122508}{122584}so after our little talk,|did you decide which way to jump yet?
{122628}{122666}Hug 'im close, go for glory
{122667}{122735}or do the right thing|and head for home?
{122736}{122784}Not yet.
{122822}{122872}Well, i guess i'll have to|be like everybody else...
{122872}{122928}Just watching the press|conference on tv,
{122929}{122992}scrutinizing the body|language for telltale signs.
{122993}{123055}I guess you will.
{123080}{123126}I guess so.
{123382}{123445}- goodbye, tony.|- Goodbye, mr. president.
{123581}{123640}{y:i}Right face!
{123928}{123981}Yeah, he's just leaving now.
{123982}{124038}Yeah, i've got it in hand. yeah.
{124267}{124332}Yeah. yeah, okay.
{124333}{124393}All right, i'll see you then.
{124394}{124467}All right, get ahold of john|and tell him to bring...
{125073}{125168}It's my honor to welcome|the prime minister

{125239}{125289}to camp david.
{125318}{125372}We've had a couple|of formal visits.
{125373}{125452}More importantly, we've had a|nice walk around camp david
{125452}{125507}and gotten to know each other.
{125540}{125615}As they've told me,|he's a pretty charming guy.

{125757}{125803}{y:i}A question for both of you.
{125804}{125854}{y:i}There's been a lot said

{126271}{126308}{y:i}They're gonna...
{126308}{126377}{y:i}they're gonna wonder how you|know that, george.
{126445}{126501}I don't know if you found|any common ground or not.
{126502}{126574}I think that's enough|to be going on with.

Relax, man.
Get over here now.
Come on, man.
It's the gator fest kickoff party, døde.
Calm down, Scott.
I'll kick your ass in the bayou.
Leave it alone, Scott.
Let's go.
You know what?
I'm getting sick and tired...
Jack, your daddy's going to hear about this.
Your mama and daddies are going to get some nice fat citations now from all of you.
Okay, Jen c.
Bring it on in.
You read me? Bring it on in.
I can't wait to hear what he's got to say.
Howdy.
Looks like you had a rough night fishing.
Rough ain't the half of it.
Damn thing killed half my crew before I could get it in the tank.
What the hell's in that thing?
You pay me to find exotic animals.
Pay me.
I'm sorry about your men.
Bring it all.
Got it.
How the hell you get that thing in there?
Blood.
Put another strap on. Quick.
Hurry it up. Come on.
Move, move, move!
Come on. Move!
Move it. Move it. Move it!
Hurry! Get it going, now.
Don't say a word about this to anyone.
Sure.
Get that truck out of here.
Right.
What a lousy way to start the summer.
Krystal!
People are out of water.
Come on.
I'm coming.
That ain't part of the alligator show they got around here, is it?
So your friends dared you to come and get...
My number?
Who was that?
Oh, come on, babe.
Flirting's part of the job.
You know I'm all yours.
Well, in that case, then flirt away.
Whoo!
I hope you're all having a good time here at the gator shed.
Family owned and operated.
Always has been, always will be.
And everything that we make tonight is to send her sister to college.
Yeah.
She's the one over by the fireplace that's pretending not to know me.
There she is. Hey, krystal.
- Okay, it is 6:00...
- Right this way.
Here at the gator shed, and that means only one thing.
Kill me now.
Who would bus the tables for me?
Enjoy.
Thanks.
It is time...
To feed the gators!
Let's go!
Who wants to feed some gators?
Me!
Come on, now.
Who wants to feed some gators?
Me!
All right, that's better.
All righty.
Has a bite strength of over 2,000 pounds per square inch.
Its jaws...
Can literally snap a man in half.
And not no little man like you.
Å big man like me.
Think your brother ever gets scared of doing that?
No, he faced down the scariest creature alive.
What's more dangerous than a gator?
Well, a defensive lineman from the New York giants.
Mm-hmm.
I'll show you.
You think he misses it?
What, being pummeled so many times that he can't walk without a limp again?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, he misses it.
An alligator, he swallows his food whole.
His teeth don't chew.
He grabs on, spins around, takes it down and drowns it, and then swallows it.
Anyways, after graduation,
I'm out of here.
30 Miles per hour on land.
Can you run 30 Miles per hour?
Me neither, and I'm pretty fast.
So I don't want to meet one of these things who starts chasing me.
Oop!
Cut Jackson off. He's wasted.
You got it, boss.
Ah, hey, mystery man.
Let me guess.
- Just coffee.
- Yeah.
You know, you come in here every single day, and you never order food.
I'm starting to take it personally.
I like coffee.
This coffee?
Tastes good to me.
You know, I think
I've figured it out.
What's that?
You're a traveling aluminum siding salesman.
- No.
- Okay.
Then I'm just going to have to go with secret agent.
You were closer the first time.
Name's Tommy, by the way.
So you have a name.
I'm Rachel.
I know.
I can feed them gators...
Come on, Jackson. That's it.
Okay, I'm sorry, folks.
Here you go.
Come on. Come on, Jackson.
People are trying to have a good time... hey.
All right. I'm sorry.
Come on, Jackson.
Get your hands off of me!
Look at you, Jackson.
I gotta go.
Come on, Jackson.
Swamp thing.
What kind of nature's that anyway?
Aw, come on.
Can't play football... mandling, head over to the gator shed a. S.Å.P.
We got called about a fight.
Copy that. We're on our way.
Come on, Jackson.
Jason! What are you doing?
Man, Jackson, why'd you have to go and do that?
Are you okay?
Did you see that?
Swamp thing just knocked out Jackson.
Oh, boy.
Krystal, shut it down.
- Jackson, I'm sorry.
- You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.
It's just reaction.
I'm sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Let's go; Come on.
Come on, now. Rachel.
You mind stepping over here a sec?
You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you for questioning.
If you decide to answer questions without an attorney present, you still have the right to stop answering at any time.
Assault and battery, rach.
Doesn't look good.
Jackson was looking for trouble.
It's not Jason's fault that he found it.
You think any more about what we talked about?
I have a boyfriend, sheriff.
I know, I know, you got that bartender, Mr. flirty.
You going to let Jason go or what?
Well, that all depends, cupcake.
You going to have dinner with me?
What if I told you
I'd think about it?
- Really?
- Yeah.
It might be nice.
Well, then I'd say that...
Maybe what happened here was just...
Å little misunderstanding.
Little bit.
Thank you, sheriff.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let him go.
Yeah. Come on.
Get these things off me.
- Come on.
- How'd you do that?
What'd you say?
Hey, hey. What up?
Sorry, guys. We're closed.
Let's just get the beers and head to the boat.
Well, if it's closed, you're not working, then, right?
Um, I'm... i have to help clean up.
That's too bad.
Maybe she can hang out with us this weekend.
- Oh, that'd be nice, actually.
- Yeah.
I can't.
My sister would kill me.
Come on, man.
We're going to rent a boat and go out to the lake where the cops can't find us.
Does that sound like fun?
Well, my sister would kill me and then stomp on my grave, so...
Well, you know what?
If you survive, give my boy scout a call right there.
Yeah, what's your name?
- Krystal.
- Krystal, nice.
Wear that. Wear that, okay?
Yeah.
Totally, døde.
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how the gator shed does with no gators.
Come to papa.
Come and get it.
Oh, shoot.
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Hmm?
Ah!
Man.
It's a real mess, rach.
Tell me about it.
What the hell happened?
Gators are gone.
Gone? How?
Something ate them.
What could possibly eat a gator?
What?
- Um...
- Don't.
Tell me what?
Looked like a... Shark.
Å shark.
Come on, rach.
Did you have a little too much Tequila after I left last night?
I know it sounds crazy, but that is what I saw.
You saw a shark in the swamp.
Yes.
Å swamp shark.
Come on.
Go to hell.
You know, just 'cause it isn't likely doesn't mean it's impossible.
It is impossible.
Sharks live in salt water, buddy.
Actually, not all sharks live in salt water.
Medulla, pygmy, ragner.
And just 'cause a shark is predominantly salt water doesn't mean it can't swim in fresh.
Bull sharks can live up to three weeks in freshwater.
How do you know all this stuff?
He's a genius.
Not really.
I just watch a lot of cable.
Oh, great.
We don't need your help, sheriff.
Is that any way to greet your future husband, Rachel?
You know my presence out here isn't optional.
I got a report of a gunshot fired at 5:00 in the morning.
You know I got to check it out.
Mandling out here?
Sheriff!
What the heck is that?
Looks like Jackson came back out here for some kind of payback.
You want to tell me about it?
I... i don't know what you're talking about.
I bet your brother does.
I've seen a lot of crazy things down here.
I'm not saying it's impossible.
I'm going to need to bring you in for questioning.
I ain't did nothing.
I'm not saying you did, swampy.
Well, what's the charge?
He's not being charged yet.
I just got to get to the bottom of what happened out here last night.
I already told you
I ain't did nothing.
Hey, sheriff!
What the hell is that?
Oh, God.
I think it's Jackson.
Oh, hell, no.
What'd you do, chop him up and feed him to your gators?
He wouldn't do that.
I didn't even see Jackson after he left yesterday, and that's the truth.
So unless you got some evidence that shows otherwise, why don't you just leave us alone and go find out what really happened?
I know what happened.
Well, are you going to tell me, or are you going to keep it a secret?
It was the shark.
Å what?
I saw a shark last night.
I came out here, and the gator pen was all torn up, and I saw it, I shot at it, and it swam away...
It must have been coming in here to eat our gators, and maybe Jackson got in the way.
I heard it all.
You're telling me that there's a shark in the swamp.
- Actually, medulla...
- Shut up.
Now, you listen to me.
I'm going to call judge Masterson, and I'm going to tell him to shut this circus down till we can figure out what's happening around here.
- You can't do that.
- Watch me.
Sheriff Watson, this is headquarters. Over.
This is the sheriff.
Sheriff, we have a 398 in progress.
I'm on the way.
I'll be back, cupcake.
He can't do this.
We got a 398 over on... looks like drop 17.
He's not going to be gone long.
What are we going to do?
Look for new jobs?
He wanted to shut us down before his deputy got mangled.
Do whatever you want.
I'm going hunting.
- For what?
- For whatever I saw.
That thing ripped our gators to shreds.
Whatever it is, it probably killed Jackson too.
I say we hunt it, we kill it, we bring it back to sheriff Watson, clear our names, and save the business.
Rach, listen to yourself.
It's just a restaurant.
491/2 years, we've owned this restaurant, okay?
It's all we have.
I'd rather burn in hell than be the one that didn't bring us to 50.
We don't even know what it is.
How do you hunt something you know nothing about?
I may not know what it is, but I know how to find it.
The insurance company made me get them.
I didn't think
I'd ever have to use them.
Wait a second;
There are tracking chips in all of the gators?
Yup.
- Password?
- Whodat, one word.
So if your loch ness monster ate these gators, then the tracking devices are in its stomach?
Along with the rest of the gator.
Obviously.
According to the website, every ten minutes, it uploads its location to the satellite.
If it's moving, we should get a history...
Look at that.
Looks like they're having a town meeting.
Or that thing ate every last piece of them.
Even if we do catch it, how does that prove anything?
Easy, they can cut it open and identify the gators by their tracking chip.
How do we prove what happened to Jackson?
They can take a mold of its teeth and then match it to the bite marks on the arm.
What?
Catch a shark, save the restaurant.
Who's in?
Damn it.
# 'Cause I'm a little sick of it #
# don't care what the doctor said #
# sure miss your company #
# so blow your nose and stomp with me #
Are you kidding me?
I'll talk to 'em.
What the hell is this?
- What?
- The Dukes, the cooler.
This is a hunting trip, not a picnic.
Well, I'm wearing the shorts
'cause they're easy to move in, and what's in the cooler ain't no picnic.
Well, the cooler can come, but you gotta stay.
Mom and død would have let me go.
Mom and død ain't here, are they?
Rachel and me are, and we're not letting you go.
It's not fair.
Look, I know you guys really want to go, but if anything happened to you out there,
I couldn't live with myself, okay?
We understand.
Look, I have an app that's running that'll track the shark for you.
Just be careful.
Thanks, Martin.
What are you doing here?
Coming with you.
But you don't know where we're going.
Shark hunting. Small town.
We've got plenty of people.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Dude definitely comes along.
Who is this guy?
I still don't think it's a good idea.
He's a stranger.
But he's been coming to the shed for a while now.
So what? That doesn't mean you can trust him.
Why not?
Just... i don't like him.
Something about him.
I think you're jealous.
- Of him?
- Yeah.
Right.
That's ridiculous.
Hey!
You're not really going to call those guys, are you?
Why? What do you care?
They were nice.
"Nice. " More like in heat.
Yeah, well, it's not a crime for a guy to like me, you know.
I... i just... you just what?
Nothing.
Hey, stop the boat!
The transmitters say we're here, but the tags haven't moved for over an hour.
That's weird.
I found one.
Where?
Look, there's more.
Either our gators disintegrated, or that thing took a huge... watch out!
Shark!
Did you freaking see that shark?
- You were right, rach.
- Yeah.
We gotta get out of here!
We came here to hunt that thing.
I thought you wanted to help.
That was when I thought you were seeing things.
We gotta call the sheriff now.
Kill it and go home.
Yo, look!
I got this.
Are you crazy?
Oh, my God.
Didn't even flinch!
Got it!
It's trying to sink us.
- I said stop it.
- Get off the wheel.
You want to get eaten?
Where are we going, Tyler?
What are you doing, Tyler?
Getting us out of here.
- Give me the wheel.
- No, I got it.
Tyler, we're smokin' real bad.
You got to slow down, man.
Come on!
You're going to burn this thing out.
Oh, my knee!
# What up? What up?
What up? What up? #
# what up? What up? What up? #
# get your hands in the air #
# get your hands in the air #
Dude, that was classic.
- Damn it, Scott!
- Are you all right?
- What is your problem?
- Are you serious?
Like, you are absolutely...
- are you all right?
- I'm fine.
That was hilarious.
- Damn it.
- They're going to hear us.
You guys are... they don't even know where they are, let alone where we are.
I know.
But can't we go somewhere a little more private?
I hate you, and I hate that you're...
You know, I did see a little boat tied up at the dock.
What you think?
Want to take it for a spin?
Whose is it?
Hell if I know.
Besides...
It's going to a noble cause.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll go in that water...
You go.
I ain't getting in...
Hey, guys. Where you going?
Oh, uh, we'll be back.
Yeah, don't worry about waiting up for us.
We might be a while.
Oh, so you're not going to have sex, then.
What... what happened out there?
Grab the rope.
Can you make it up the stairs?
Oh, my... i can't believe it.
Martin, help me get him up the stairs.
Leave it.
All right, put him on the chair right over there.
What a mess.
My dad's boat.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
What happened?
There it is.
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Oh, my God, Marcus, I swear, if we get attacked by gators,
I will never forgive you.
Fair enough.
Oh, my God.
You're so paranoid.
Don't be scared.
Whoo!
Yeah, let's do it.
What is that?
So...
How's this?
Is this private enough for you?
Yeah.
I think this is perfect...
As long as we don't fall in.
Well, I guess we'll just have to be careful.
Hold that pose.
Damn.
Here we go.
And...
Marcus.
What? Let me see.
Damn, I look hot.
No.
Look.
- It looks like at...
- What is that?
You know what?
Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe... oh, God.
Maybe it was just your hair.
Marcus, take me back.
Take me back.
Please.
Seriously, Marcus.
Take me back now!
Take me back now. I'm serious.
All right.
You owe me.
Get me back to shore, and you can have whatever you want.
Would you go?
What?
Um...
That is a shark, Marcus.
That is a shark, Marcus.
Get us out of here.
God. Help!
Help!
Noah! Scott!
Noah!
Oh, my God.
Paddle faster, Marcus!
I'm going as fast as...
Marcus, paddle faster!
Help!
Amber, help me.
Help me.
Marcus!
No!
Help!
Help!
Get him something to bite on.
All right, hold him down.
All right, let me hold him.
You ready, bro?
Ready as I'm going to be.
Okay.
One, two...
Three!
Man, I haven't had to do that in a while.
It could have been worse.
- You ready to go again?
- Yeah.
Are you psycho?
Did you not see that thing?
I mean, look at your knee, man.
Just give up.
Give up?
Friend, you obviously never played football.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to fix this engine.
For what?
I'm going back out there.
Do you have any large
Crescent wrenches?
Yeah, on the deck.
Are you insane?
That thing has tasted people, and apparently we taste good.
Now it's going to keep on killing until somebody puts it down.
You can't stop it.
If it breathes, it can be killed.
What makes you think you can stop it?
Hey, don't worry about it.
I can handle it.
We don't need you.
I see the way you look at her.
What did you say?
Stay away from my girlfriend, man!
All right, that's enough.
Not now.
Now is not the time.
You're acting like an idiot.
Are you seriously defending him?
I'm not defending anybody.
See, this is the problem.
You defend him instead of me.
Oh, give me a break.
I could have any girl I want.
You realize that, right?
You know, I think... wow.
Tyler!
How you like me now?
- Do something.
- How you like me now?
Don't make me hurt you.
Come on!
Ahh!
You going to chill?
You going to chill?
I'm cool, man!
Troublemaker.
I have already.
That's... but that's the problem.
I've already said it once, and now I've got to repeat myself.
It's irritating.
Don't just say... just tell me what you want me to do.
Okay, all right.
I really don't like...
I should probably go.
No, no, no, it was Tyler's malfunction.
Good?
No, you're going to need a bigger band-aid.
One second.
You were really cool in there.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Right.
She your girl?
Her?
Krystal and me.
No.
No, no, no, no way.
You don't like her?
I... i do like her. Å lot.
It's the friend curse.
I'm her buddy, so she's never going to notice me.
Seize the moment.
What?
Take a shot.
What?
Something Martin and I were discussing.
Seize the moment.
Dude.
No.
What?
Wait, hold on.
What?
Hey, how's your shoulder?
Any permanent damage?
Oh, no, it's... you know, I think it's all right thanks to nurse krystal.
I'm not sure about old Tyler, though.
I'm sorry about all that.
You know what?
It's a crazy day.
Emotions are running high.
I'm sure everything will be better tomorrow.
Yeah, well, it better be, because I plan on going back out there to finish this thing.
There's not a lot of quit in you, is there?
Do you want to help me, uh...
Keep hunting?
Absolutely.
I guess I should get going.
Yeah.
Uh, get some sleep and stuff.
I will.
And don't disappear on me,
'cause I'm going to need you.
All right.
Oh.
I got to lock up.
Get any sleep?
No.
You going to open the restaurant today?
Until I see a court order, it's business as usual.
You mean other than shark hunting.
That's right.
So what do we got here?
I'm still trying to identify that shark.
Can't find anything that looks like the one you described.
That armor stuff has to be some sort of exoskeleton that's been growing for, like,
100 years.
But, I mean, sharks don't live that long.
Right.
Check this out.
There was a shark attack three weeks ago in the Gulf of Mexico, about 100 Miles from here.
The attack happened a few minutes after this probe was retrieved by marine biologists.
It's a probe that had been crawling along in deep ocean trenches...
I mean, deeper than we've ever been before.
Wait, so you think this shark is our shark?
I don't know.
Well, it would explain why you can't determine its species and why there's 100 years of gunk on it.
You're missing the point,
'cause the water pressure at the bottom of the ocean can turn a car into a soda can.
Anything that can survive at that depth is... indestructible.
Yeah.
Tell me what else this article says about where it's been.
That's the whole thing.
The people working the probe were the shark attack victims.
They radioed for help, but by the time the police boats and the recuse workers got there, there was nothing left.
Why in the hell is it in our swamp?
You got me.
Now that Jackson got his self killed,
I don't have a driver
I can trust.
Well, you've got to haul this thing out of here.
No kidding.
Not like I can run it through the department.
Figure it out.
This is your mess.
You're the middleman, and things got screwed up on your shift.
No more excuses.
I know. I know.
I'll figure it out.
You better.
Now, how are you going to make this right?
Brazilian macaws.
Å bird.
Not just a bird.
This is on the endangered species list, almost impossible to find in the states.
I can have 20 of them on a plane tomorrow.
Now, you can grab about 10 grand each, easy. is a really nice haul.
Best thing come along since them pandas.
Now all I need is a little up-front money.
How much?
10 grand.
And 10 grand for the custom agents at the port.
Get them to me in one piece, and I'll throw another 20 grand your way.
I like that.
Make up for this little shark fiasco we have here.
Hmm!
You know, I've been thinking about staying in town for the delivery.
You don't mind, do you?
Knock yourself out.
Good.
I've always wanted to see this gator fest for myself anyway.
I tell you, it's a real blast.
You'll have such a good time, you'll wet yourself.
Get that freaking thing out of here.
I'll see you at the fest.
# Well, last night, you done went too far #
# can't go back out to the bar #
Morning, ladies.
Good morning.
#... Way too fast #
# take it easy, boy #
It's about time you got here.
Sorry.
Had a late night last night.
What the hell we supposed to be doing, anyway?
The sheriff told us to keep our eyes open for anything unusual.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Well, you tell me.
Might have something to do with that shark.
Heard he turned a cage full of gators into toothpicks and sloppy Joes.
There ain't no damn shark.
The sheriff done said so.
Now, just get your ass out there, and keep your eyes open.
For something unusual.
Right.
That ain't a shark.
Just get.
I'm just getting.
Damn idiot.
This is Cooper to mandling.
Yeah, go for mandling.
Everything looks good on the dock.
There ain't no shark here.
Yeah, copy that, Coop.
Come on.
Okay, let's go.
Excuse me, officer.
Mm-hmm.
Yup.
Come on. Come and catch me.
Where you going now?
Here we go.
Ooh.
There... there was a gator.
Over there?
Big ol' gator.
Why don't you just shoot him?
I got to call this in.
Charlene, you there?
Oh!
Oh, my... come on, babe.
Krystal, answer the phone!
Gator shed. This is krystal.
Krystal.
Yeah?
It's me, Scott.
We met yesterday.
Oh! Hi.
I mean, what's up?
You didn't call.
That's what's up.
Uh, yeah, it's been super busy.
Well, forget about that.
You ready to join the party?
Well, I totally would, but... two of our friends ditched us.
So lame.
So now you have to come.
Uh, well, maybe I could stop by for a little bit.
All right, we're camped down at cypress cove about a mile west of whiskey river.
Do you know where that is?
- Of course.
- Sweet.
We'll wait for you here.
Make sure you save my number.
I already did.
I knew I liked you.
Don't be a flake.
# My soul is on trial with a public defender #
Boom! That's what's up.
Hey, she's coming.
- No way.
- Of course she's coming.
Scott?
Don't throw it.
What... you don't even know how to read it.
Catch.
Come... no, don't... man!
Careful, careful.
Careful with it.
What's this?
Well, that is a map that Martin made.
So now we have a map of all the places the shark tried to eat us.
Actually, we can use it to extrapolate where the shark is going next.
Extrapo-what?
Extrap... never mind.
Sharks move in concentric circles when marking new territory.
It's how they hunt.
The center point is where
Rachel first saw it, so you can see that it's been moving outward since.
So you can figure out where the shark is going.
I already have.
So where's it headed?
You guys aren't going to like it.
Where is this thing going?
There.
Whiskey river?
The gator fest.
# All the girls
I've known before #
# have left me hungry, left me poor #
# women come, and then they go #
# why they leave, well, I just don't know #
# another one just walked out the door #
Scott?
Scott! Hi.
Whoa, krystal, you made it.
This is awesome.
Yeah, uh, listen.
Don't pull out on the water today.
Don't go to gator fest.
There's something dangerous out there.
You know, I've heard a lot of excuses not to party, but this one... it's not an excuse.
I'm serious.
Okay, everyone's waiting.
Come on.
- Wait.
- Come on.
# Jenny turned out to be a man #
# and kitty took off with my van #
What's going on?
Join the party.
There's a shark in the water, and my brother tried to shoot it, and it totally didn't flinch.
My point is that it's deadly and we have to get out of here before it comes back.
Okay.
We're on a boat.
We'll be fine.
I have another bikini if you don't want any tan lines.
Take yours off and give her that bikini right there.
Here you go. Try this.
It makes all your troubles go away.
Well, I... i don't think you understand.
It's not just going to go away.
Chill, baby.
We're going to have a blast.
# I ain't got no damn luck #
# baby, that's for sure #
Whoo!
# Margarita in LA chiquita #
# si, un chiquita #
# si, si, para mi #
What are you doing?
We have to get off of the water.
We're not on the water;
We're in a boat.
- Stop the boat.
- No.
- Well...
- Jesus.
What, are you crazy?
Give that back!
I'm not 21. I'm not... give it back! I need that.
- No.
- Stop it.
Ah! Man, you know what?
You suck.
Dude!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dude, relax.
You are out of control.
I'm sorry.
Look, when we get back,
I'll get you a new phone, okay?
What about the shark?
Well...
We'll stay out of the water, and we'll keep it mellow, okay?
I promise.
Let's go have some fun.
Just stay close to the shore.
All right. No problem.
# Whiskey bottle #
# give me a kiss #
# and let me take a sip of your love #
Gator shed.
Yeah, is Rachel there?
Yeah, one second.
Rachel! Phone!
Hello.
I got something you need to see.
- What?
- Meet me at the hospital.
Uh, when?
As soon as you can.
- Yeah, ten minutes.
- All right.
Paging Dr. Calvin...
Back so soon, agent brysler?
Just want to take another quick look, if you don't mind.
Hey, give me a holler if you need my help.
- Thanks, Larry.
- Agent?
U.S. fish and wildlife.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.
I've been undercover for a while now.
All this time, you didn't say anything.
I couldn't.
Besides, your place is my little place to get away and... and what?
And it was a good spot to... what, you were investigating us?
No, no, no, no,
I've been trying to make this animal smuggling case forever, but I didn't have the goods.
Now with this new evidence and your testimony... wait, that's great, but you could have told me that on the phone.
Yeah, but then I couldn't show you this.
Oh, God.
Do you know him?
I found what's left of him in the channel this morning.
You all right?
Oh.
You... Brought me here why?
You see this?
Multiple rows of teeth.
Gators don't have that, but sharks do.
Three rows.
That proves I was right.
Now I'm going to nail these guys for murder along with animal smuggling.
You were right.
You were right all the time.
In the meantime, that thing's still out there.
Then let's go hunt it down.
Hey, this is krystal.
I'm not here right now, so please leave a message, and I'll call you back.
Beep!
Wow, you guys look like you're busy.
We've been waiting on you.
Well, I'm just going to say good-bye to krystal, and then we'll be on our way.
I thought she was with you.
No.
I haven't seen her all morning.
We gotta find her.
All right, well, maybe she went for a walk or something.
- Uh, Martin!
- What's up?
Where is krystal?
I don't know.
Okay, well, maybe... all right, she met some guys yesterday, some college guys here, and they asked her to go to a party with them.
All right, college guys, party.
It's not great, but it's not the end of the world.
No, the party's on a boat.
Part of a gator fest thing.
They go up and down the river.
- Oh, no.
- We've got to find her.
Where would we even look?
There's a thousand Miles of swamp out there.
We need help, rach.
Got to call the sheriff.
I hate to agree with Tyler, but he's right.
No, that's not an option. No.
It's serious.
I hate the guy more than you do, but this is krystal we're talking about.
We've no other choice.
Yeah, we have to call.
No, you can't. You can't.
Tommy's a federal agent.
He's going to call a fish and wildlife SWAT team, and they're going to comb this lake and bring krystal home.
Give me sheriff Watson.
Tell him special agent brysler's calling and it's urgent.
Special agent brysler, fish and game.
Sheriff here?
Excuse me. Can we help you?
Deputy.
So you're a fed, huh?
That's right.
- Stanley.
- Yes, sheriff.
See if these nice people would like something to drink.
Nah, it's all right...
- get y'all anything?
- No, we're fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Well, fish and wildlife or not, this is still my jurisdiction.
I think we both know those are navigable federal waterways.
You want to have a pissing contest about this?
Come on, sheriff.
You're a little out of your league here.
Out of my league?
Every year, we get a bunch of renegade gators going around attacking tourists.
Now, that's not nice, but there's nothing special about it.
We've been to the morgue, and the bite marks on those kids prove they were killed by a shark.
You expect me to believe that there's a shark floating around this bayou?
We all saw it, and now we got hard evidence.
Those kids were not killed by any gator.
Then what was that big green thing that almost ripped my deputy's leg off today?
I don't know about that, but look,
I've got enough right now to call the governor, get him to shut down the whiskey river recreational area indefinitely.
What's wrong with you?
People are hurting around here since that oil spill.
Now, the gator fest begins tonight.
You want to spoil the one thing that still brings money to this town?
That's where the shark is headed.
I got deputies all around this bayou, okay, looking for gators and snakes.
If some kind of shark pops its head up... and that's a mighty big if... they can handle it.
This isn't a normal shark.
You can say that again.
It's some kind of hallucination.
Please.
You know
I can have you all arrested?
What?
I could call the governor myself.
You know we grew up together?
You didn't know that, did you?
Tell him you and your federal agent friend are making a mess of things down here.
All right, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, sheriff.
- What?
- Help us kill this shark.
And I'll do everything in my power to get the prosecution to go easy on you.
Prosecution of what?
Exotic animal smuggling, bribing state and local officials, multiple violations of the interstate commerce code to start.
So you can lock us up, but you can't shut us up.
We'll see about that, cupcake.
You're just going to arrest them, right?
I mean, I... i only work at the restaurant, so...
- Stanley?
- Yes, sheriff.
Get all these people out of here now, or put them in the jail.
Go on. Get out.
Get 'em out of here!
Is that a taser?
That's an x26... hey!
Sheriff!
Go on; Get out of here!
- Stanley.
- Swamp!
Stanley, on your feet. Now!
Come on; Get in.
Wait. His boat.
Come on!
Back it up! Hold on!
Get back here!
I'm gonna shoot!
I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot!
What? You like that? Sucker!
Ha-ha! Did you see that?
Sucker, sheriff. Whoo!
I don't like that we left Jason behind.
First we save krystal.
Then we come back with the cavalry and bust swamp thing out,
I promise.
You three best turn my boat around right now.
Bring it back.
That's a negatory, sheriff.
Your boat's just so cute.
Real fast too, and handles nice.
Listen, chum-for-brains, you bring that boat in now.
Okay, hotshot, we'll see... that's enough of that.
Come on; Let's get our game faces on, all right?
Can anybody read me?
This is krystal broussard.
I need help.
Oh! Krystal!
Krystal, can you hear me?
Rachel! They won't let me off the boat.
What... what boat? Where?
We're in the swamp.
They won't listen.
I think we're headed for whiskey river.
Okay, we're going to come get you.
Uh, where are you exactly?
We're about... no! No! What are you doing?
Krystal?
Krystal!
Here.
I'm trying to help you.
What is your problem?
She's telling on us, man.
Would you please shut the hell up so the rest of us... did it ever occur to you that they might charge us for that?
Well, get daddy to pay for it.
No, my dad's not going to pay for everything.
He's already paid for this trip.
Now, stop laughing.
The whole trip?
Scott is such a jerk.
You want a drink?
Don't touch me, døde.
No, I don't want a drink.
Relax, man.
Stop!
You're going to hit the tree.
- Calm down.
- Calm down?
Does anyone want a drink?
Great. This is perfect.
This damn rain.
Krystal.
Got to go now.
She could be anywhere in the swamp.
She said she was heading to the whiskey river, okay?
We head over there and see if we can find her.
I thought you said that was where the shark was headed.
So going there is suicide.
No, no, it's called saving my sister.
What, do you think the cops are going to save us?
Hang on.
# And I'm slowly going to pieces #
# but it's too... #
You okay?
Coop, come in, please.
Cooper, we got a 31-20.
Coop, can you read me?
Coop, can you come in, please?
Listen, I got a 31-20, Coop.
Come on in, please.
I'm going to go down to the gator fest.
You keep an eye on Shrek here.
Yes, sheriff.
Since everyone's so interested in me catching the shark,
I'm going to go find some bait.
Oh, man.
Dude, you broke the prop.
No, I didn't.
I told you we shouldn't have gone.
Would you please shut up?
Dude, chill. All we got to do is call for help.
My phone doesn't have any bars here.
That's what a radio's for.
All right, short straw goes to see what the trouble is.
You ain't special, krystal.
You got to play too.
No one should go in the water.
It's safer to stay here until we get help.
I'm getting sick and tired of baby-sitting you...
I'll take hers.
All right.
You're lucky
Noah is such a gentleman.
Well, let's show 'em.
Looks like you win, døde.
You guys suck.
Yeah, man, it's definitely clogged.
Well, go unclog it, genius.
All right, hand me the pliers from the toolbox.
If I'm not back in two minutes, just wait longer.
Shut up. Hurry.
I can't get at it.
Dude, you didn't even try.
Go down there, and spend a little more time than two seconds, man.
You're hilarious.
What's going on?
- Scott!
- Scott!
Scott!
Oh, my God, where is he?
Oh, my God! Shark!
- Scott!
- Scott!
Shark! Shark!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Come here!
Faster! Faster!
Scott!
Hold on. I got it.
Baby, hold on.
I gotcha. I got it.
Cut it!
Hurry!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Look at me.
No, no, no, look at me.
There!
That's got to be krystal.
Listen to me, baby.
I got you, baby, okay?
Stay with me.
Tell her to stay calm.
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.
I got you, okay?
Tell her to stay calm.
How can you stay calm like this?
We have to get out of here!
Well, we're still stuck on something, unless you feel like going for a swim to get us loose.
Watch her!
Here. Here!
Go. Keep pressure on that.
I think I got a way out of this.
Damn it.
What?
I could swear it came from over here.
- Krystal.
- No, it's Rachel.
We're still trying to find her before the shark does.
Crap! Oh, hey, listen.
I've been thinking of ways you could kill it.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can you get to the sheriff's station?
Sure. Why?
I need you to help me break Jason out of jail.
Really?
Cool.
Get there as fast as you can.
I've got to make another call.
Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So is it true you used to play for the NFL?
I played a little ball myself.
Went all the way to state my senior year.
I wasn't a starter or anything;
I was a backup.
But I was ready every game for four years.
That's right.
The team really relied on me.
You know, the bench, they support the team.
Hello. Deputy Stanley speaking.
Yes, ma'am.
Hold on just a second.
It's your sister.
Hello. Rachel?
Did he hand you the phone off his desk?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good. Listen.
Mm-hmm.
O- okay. All right.
Uh, deputy?
- Yeah.
- I'm through.
All right.
Hey, give me the phone.
Unlock the cell, or I'll pop your head off.
Benchwarmer.
Okay.
How'd you get out?
Oh, don't worry about that.
Hey, come on. Move over.
You know we got to go back to the restaurant.
We ain't got time for that.
Now, move over. Come on.
I'll show you how to drive this thing.
Come on. Come on. Move over.
Move over.
I'll show you how to drive this thing.
Just be gentle with it, all right?
- Hang on, baby.
- All right?
Hold my feet. Hold my feet.
No, don't go in.
You have to get to a hospital, Sarah.
All right.
Hold on.
It's coming loose. I got it.
Come on!
It's coming.
Come on.
It's coming.
Hold on.
Don't go. Don't go in.
I almost got it. Hold on.
Rachel!
Rachel!
Krystal!
Krystal, where are you?
Rachel!
She's over there.
Krystal! Krystal!
Look, the problem is that the shark comes from one of the harshest biospheres in the world.
It has to be built like a tank just to swim around the block.
So what's your plan for killing it?
Well, even tanks have soft spots if we can get the hatch open.
- You mean its mouth?
- That's right.
We got to get this thing from the inside.
- I like it.
- Yes!
Hang on!
Krystal!
Rachel!
Rachel! Rachel, I'm over here!
Look, there she is.
This should work for a can opener.
Ugh.
You see anything that'll give it some indigestion?
Uh, that should do it.
Grab it.
Now all we need is a ride.
Come on; Let's go.
You think they'll let us borrow the boat too?
We'll ask 'em later.
Okay, yeah. Wait, what?
Come on. Just get in!
Okay, I'm... no, me.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Help. Okay.
Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot!
We'll bring it back later!
Come back with my boat!
Come back with my boat!
Come back!
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel!
Why are you stopping?
Get in there.
Hey, we can't get stuck in there like she did.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'll never sneak out again.
We'll talk about that later.
Grab a rope.
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
I'll never sneak out again.
I'm so sorry.
You gotta jump.
No, no, no,
I have to get Sarah first.
Oh!
Krystal!
I got it. I got it.
You're going to let
Mr. secret agent man get all the glory?
Just get krystal.
Come on.
Hurry.
Careful.
Tyler! Tyler!
Oh, no. Tyler, grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler!
No! No!
No!
Tyler!
God.
Oh, my God!
I'm going to kill that mother... we can't stop it.
We don't have the right equipment.
No, we don't, but Martin does.
Head for shore. Come on.
Somebody help me over here.
She's really hurt.
We need this. Here, clean one.
Come on!
All right.
You son of a bitch,
I got a surprise for you.
Yeah? What?
Rachel, Rachel.
No, I can barely hear you.
What? Huh?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay, we'll be right over.
Okay.
We got to go to gator fest.
Get your funnel cakes here.
# Every time you get aggravated #
# I get shoved back #
# hold on to your anchor #
# you're gonna push too hard #
# I've been looking for a cure, little girl #
Come on, Jeanette;
You can do better than that.
# You're gonna push too hard #
# I've been playing every single night #
# for every wrong of your day #
# you can beat an old dog so much #
# before he runs away #
# I've been playing every single night #
# for every wrong of your day #
# you can beat an old dog so much #
# before he runs away #
# jam up now #
How's it going?
The usual.
Some drunks, some parking tickets, a couple of pickpockets.
Ain't no sign of a shark, though.
Let's hope it stays that way.
Never seen anything like this.
Oh, what's going on?
Where the hell'd they go?
You see where they went?
Sheriff!
It's our damn boat.
Yeah, it's about time you brought that boat back.
Tie it up first.
Get a paramedic right away!
Get e. M.T.!
Hey, sheriff!
What the hell is going on around here?
She's lost a lot of blood.
Trauma dressing.
Sheriff, who's going to pay for these damages?
Not now, Lassie.
I've got bigger fish to fry.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, tie it up.
Go, go, go, go.
He's coming.
Sheriff, you need to get everybody out of the water.
There's a shark coming.
Shark!
Sheriff, shark!
Oh!
Right there. You see it?
Get them kids out of the water.
Get them kids out of the water now.
Boys! Out of the water!
Hurry!
Whatever you got going, now's the time.
Jason, go!
Swamp thing, go!
Huh!
Fourth and long.
Time for the hail Mary.
Coming through.
Uh!
Come on. Take the bait.
Shoot it now!
Get down.
Squeak!
That was never going to work.
Fire up the airboat.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Stay here.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Martin, you're going to have to hold this!
- I don't know how!
- Just get up there!
I'll tell you what to do!
Come on!
Just hold the gas!
Hit the gas when I tell you to!
Which is the gas?
- Hit the gas!
- Where's the gas?
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Boy, that shark's no match for the broussard family.
Unbelievable.
What's he doing?
Squeak!
Federal agent.
You're under arrest.
Mandling!
Get your hands off me.
Not a chance. Grab the pole.
I want to see my lawyer.
Yeah, I bet you do.
Incarcerate this gentleman.
Okay.
I guess I'm in charge now, huh?
Come on.
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Looks like you got your man.
Now what are you going to do?
I could use a cup of coffee.
You know any good restaurants around here?
Yeah, I know one.
Coffee sucks, but the waitresses are nice.
That's good enough for me.
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
But I guess that's life, huh?
One minute, you're having the best day ever, the next, you're being fed to a monster the size of a two-car garage.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life.
And everything started out so well this morning.
Good morning, Perry.
Now that's the way to wake up.
This is gonna be the best day ever.
We consider every day a plus
To spend it with a platypus
We're always so ecstatic
'Cause he's semi-aquatic
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus
Brings smiles to the both of us
Life's never fuddy-duddy
With our web-footed buddy
When we're brushing our teeth
It's better
Tying our shoes
It's better
Combing our hair
It's better
Like we're a cheese sandwich
And he's the cheddar
Blinking our eyes
It's better
Breathing in and out
So much better
Sitting in a chair
It's better
And taking a bath
Just a little bit wetter
Every day is such a dream
When it's started with a monotreme
He's duck-billed and he's beaver-tailed and hairy
You know that he's hairy
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
It's better
And we just want to tell you, Perry
Everything's better with you
Better with you
Good morning, boys.
Happy anniversary, Perry.
Oh, that's right! Gosh.
I can't believe it's been five years.
I remember the day we first got you.
Come on, kids.
Pick out any pet you want.
Look, Phineas, this one's looking at you!
And this one's looking at you, Ferb.
Why won't anything look at me?
Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time.
That thing? You're kidding, right?
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes. We'd like that one, please.
You'd like to adopt a platypus?
Is that what it is? Well, yes.
- May we have him, please?
- Okay.
What would you even name a platypus?
Of course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you.
- Bartholemew!
- Bartholemew!
And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry and gave you this locket.
Look how young we all were.
Hey, Jeremy.
You wanna go to the mall?
You know, I'd love to, but my dad's taking me to check out his old college today.
Booyah! Go Polecats! Booyah!
He's already set up an interview with an academic advisor.
Can you believe that?
Gee, Jeremy, I forgot you're a whole year older than me.
A trip to college?
That's... That's really great.
Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Jeremy! In the blink of an eye, you'll be moving on to the next phase of your life.
You'll be going to college
and wearing tweed jackets with patches on the elbows.
You'll be so mature.
And look at me. I'm a child!
Jeremy, you'll see. I can mature.
Starting with taking this silly photo off.
Mr Miggins!
Have you been there the whole time?
All right, looks like the pitcher's ready.
And batter up!
Batter, batter, batter, swing!
Yes, sports fans, that may be the best hit ever in the history of platypult baseball.
And the crowd exhales loudly through their mouths.
And Fletcher snags the pop fly.
He's out!
Hi, Phineas! What you doing?
Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into a sporting event.
Hi, Perry, can I try?
Whoa, momma! Nice shot, Isabella.
Did someone lose a ball?
Yeah, we were just playing platypult.
I love platypus-themed sports.
You know, if we had two Perrys, we could put a net between them
- and play platypult badminton.
- Who's Annette?
Ferb, that's it!
I know what we're gonna do today.
No, seriously. Who's Annette?
Okay, everyone, I think the tail is all set.
I'll just go check with the foreman.
- He's gone!
- Hey, where's Perry?
Did he really slip away?
On his anniversary?
Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long.
I guess he can do whatever he wants.
After all, it's his day, right?
Hey, what was that small noise?
Let's all go walk over to it.
Good morning, Agent P. A quick word.
Recently you've been having some close calls
and your host family has almost caught you
sneaking into your lair several times.
No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway,
that if your cover's blown,
you'll have to be transferred to another city with another host family.
And we both know you wouldn't like that.
I remember the day you were first assigned.
Enjoy your platypus!
Thank you, cheerio!
Agent assignment complete, sir.
Good job, Karl.
If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time.
- And I did.
- Don't get cocky, Karl.
Agent P, as you know,
every operative is equipped with an autoscan replication device
just like the one in your hat.
We've been using the information you've gathered
to replicate each and every one of
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Inators.
Our top men have been analysing them to determine
if they've been getting smarter or dumber.
And to be honest, the jury's still out.
Now we find out that he's in the process of building
an alternate-dimension-related Inator.
Your assignment is to stop him before he finishes building it.
Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor,
is Karl, with some high-tech gadgets that you might find useful.
Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time.
Would you mind lowering the platform again?
Great. Let me cue the music again.
Well, obviously, this first item is our new wrist communicationizer.
It has many applications that will help you in the field.
For example, a powerful directional electromagnet.
It will draw any metal object to you.
See? And these are aluminium!
Quit goofing around, Karl, and show him the hologram.
Yes, sir.
Pretty nifty, huh?
With this device you'll be able to contact me from anywhere at any time.
But don't call between 3:30 and 4:00 because that's when I take a shower.
Wait a minute. Is that me?
No!
His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image.
I better shut it off.
And if you push this button, it gives your adversary an incredible ice cream headache.
It's gone.
You better watch where you point that!
Hey, girl! What are you doing?
Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am, concerned with busting my brothers to my mommy and living in this nursery.
A unicorn! A unicorn, Stacy!
"Hi, I'm six!"
You've gotta help me get rid of all this junk.
Wow! Bold move!
Yep. Goodbye, childhood folly, hello, carefree undemanding adult life.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Candace, your father and I are off to the movies.
While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?
Okay, Mom!
And you know, I'm even thinking about giving up on busting my brothers.
The irony is, that as a grown-up, you don't need to tell your mom.
You can just bust them yourself.
That's it! Stacy,
I'm old enough to bust them myself!
That's what I just said.
Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror as I punch a hole through to another dimension.
- Behold, the Other-Dimensionator...
- Sir!
What? What?
I finished setting up the buffet.
For crying out loud, Norm.
I was in the zone!
I just thought you were playing with your doll.
It's not a doll, it's a stand-in!
Pretendy the Practicepus, see?
I wonder if Perry the Platypus practises with a fake me.
It would be nice to know he cares enough.
All systems are green.
Prepare to launch on my mark.
T minus 30 and counting.
Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament.
So it's probably okay to leave the safety on.
And here's your brand new rocket car.
Sweet, huh? Good luck, Agent P.
Karl? Did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?
I think he knows, sir.
Three, two, one.
Service!
Phineas and Ferb, you are so busted...
Oh, my gosh! Where'd it go?
You there, small children!
Where's the big contraption?
I don't know.
It was here just a moment ago.
It disappeared?
- Stacy, do you realise what this means?
- We're done?
No, some kind of mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up.
This time it took away their invention before I showed up!
The mysterious force recognises that I'm now a grown-up.
A mysterious force? I'm not buying it.
I am a woman of science, at least that's what my horoscope said.
Well, I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time!
Where are my brothers?
We just launched them towards the park.
Buford is there with the other platypult.
Okay, as the adult,
I decree we are going to the park.
Does anyone need to go potty first?
Fine, make it quick.
Ferb, it looks like we're gonna hit that building that looks vaguely like your head.
Time to give it a little test.
Well, I just finished it.
It can't be broken already.
I stand corrected.
All right, what's with the giant shuttlecock?
We're really sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened.
One minute, we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult.
The next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the eastside to your deluxe apartment in the sky.
Well, it looks like you've totalled my Other-Dimensionator.
An Other-Dimensionator?
What does it do?
Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently.
But it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions.
That's cool! We can help you fix it.
I'm Phineas, and this is my brother Ferb.
I'm Dr Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me...
I just got in such a funk.
Ferb is naturally handy with tools.
I bet we could put this thing back together in no time.
What the heck. Before we start, there's a whole buffet set up here, please partake.
I was expecting someone who seems to be running late.
You're lucky I got a rocket car winch.
Lots of guys don't have that.
Almost there.
Okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator.
Was this working before?
Well, if by "working" you mean
"functioning properly," then no.
Well, I think I see your problem.
Everything's wired through this self-destruct button.
Do you even need that?
Well, of course I...
Wait a minute. No, I do not need that.
You are absolutely right.
So Ferb has rigged up this remote control so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one.
- Nice touch, kid.
- I guess this is the last piece.
Okay, Ferb, boost me up.
I cannot wait!
- There you are, Perry.
- Perry?
Yeah. He's our pet platypus.
Is every platypus named Perry?
In a perfect world, yes.
Well, he's a cute little fellow. Hi, there.
Coochee, coochee...
Perry, no! We do not bite the elderly.
Again, ow! It's okay.
Platypuses don't typically like me.
Well, Perry, you're just in time to see us open a window into another dimension.
Perry, no! What are you doing? No, no!
Perry, this is not tug of war!
This is not tug of war!
Silly boy, what's gotten into him?
All right, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Remember, if your cover is blown, you'll never see the boys again.
Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?
Never see them again.
Okay, here we go. Right in...
Perry! No! Not on the sofa!
I'm sorry, Dr D. We should take him out.
No, no. Wait. It'll be all right.
I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway.
Now come on. Let's light this pop stand, or however it goes.
Gosh, this is...
It's kind of weird, actually.
I'm usually thwarted by this point.
Well, I guess he's not coming.
And now, behold!
The mind-blowing first images from beyond our dimensional reality!
It's a... It's a couch.
That's a bit anticlimactic.
I guess it's a nice couch, though...
Hey! I got an idea!
Let's swap my couch for that one!
I got it. I got... Or maybe I...
Come on, you want to give me a hand here?
Awesome, check it out.
Hello.
- Say, aren't you...
- Hey, Dr D! Look at this.
Hold that thought.
You're famous here.
Get off!
"Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your leader"?
A whole tri-state area where I am already in charge!
Yeah! Hold on,
I gotta go check something out.
Hello, again.
Is this some kind of test?
Is that really you, sir?
Holy boy!
Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
I prefer the term
"indentured executive assistant".
Well, I want to meet this other dimension me.
Where can I find him?
You're from another dimension?
Well, he'll probably wanna see you then.
He's into that freaky sort of stuff.
Have a seat and I'll let him know you're on your way up.
Okay. So I just gotta sit here and...
He's Doof Doof Doof
Doof Doof Doof Doof
Bask in his glory
Kneel at his feet
You're in for such a treat
He's Doofenshmirtz
That was awesome!
All right, who's interrupting my...
Do I know you?
Yeah! I'm you from another dimension!
Well, that would explain the handsomeness.
Right back at you, big guy.
Does that mean you and I are exactly alike?
I suppose so.
Do you want some rice pudding?
Ick, no, that's gross
It was a test. Almond brittle?
- Oh, I love it the most
- Me, too
Do you collect coins?
Yeah, just in case
Vending machines become the dominant race
I've been alone all these years
With my irrational fears
But not the vending machine thing.
That's gonna happen.
But now before me, I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I thought I'd be taller
I've been told I slouch
I thought I'd have both my eyes
You know
It's in this pouch
You know, I can't help but notice that your scar goes over your eye patch.
Yeah?
Nothing.
Do llamas weird you out?
Yeah, are they camels or sheep?
No, no, I meant Lorenzo
That's right
He played Meap
Now I know all about you
And you know all about me
And now before me I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
Now that I found you
We can be a duo
That's right
Twice the evil
Double Doofenshmirtz
Coming at you Fridays
What's that? I mean, are we doing a TV show together?
No. It just sort of sounded like...
I mean, we could. We should!
Maybe we're not so much alike.
That can be our catch phrase.
You're the grumpy one.
Wow, he's done really well for himself.
What do you think, Perry?
Hey, where is Dr D?
So what you're telling me is you're still not ruler of your tri-state area?
Well, obviously you did not have to deal with my nemesis, Perry the Platypus.
Didn't I? Observe.
What is it?
This is Perry the Platyborg!
He was once my nemesis, but now, he's general of my army!
Wow! You are good!
Dismissed.
That was awesome!
Now who's interrupting me?
Remind me to berate my indentured executive assistant.
No, man, it's cool. They're with me.
Hey, Dr D. We thought we'd lost you.
Hi, fellas!
You dare to bring a secret agent in here?
This boy's a secret agent?
- No, not him!
- The quiet one?
No! Not... No. Him!
This plant?
The platypus!
That's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus!
Hey. He's just a platypus.
He doesn't do much.
This is rich. I see what's going on here.
You really think that he's your pet, don't you?
Wrong! He's using you!
You're just his cover.
He's a secret agent!
Here, here, let me prove it.
General Platyborg, come down here at once.
He'll be here in just a second.
All right, Platyborg, you see that platypus?
You know what to do.
Perry!
What was that for? Perry, are you okay?
Told you.
How are his vitals?
Wait, let me try something. Platyborg!
- Do the same thing to those two boys.
- What?
What?
Perry
Perry?
Yes! I knew it!
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Why does their platypus fight so good?
Perry the Platypus!
Really?
What?
Perry?
Get them!
You're a secret agent?
Hey, be careful with that.
So this is where you disappear to every day?
You come here and fight this guy?
No, he fights me.
He doesn't really know this guy.
You fight a pharmacist?
Why would you even do that?
Actually, I'm an evil scientist.
A lot of people are confused by the lab coat.
You're evil? He's evil?
So, not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension!
And you did nothing to stop us?
Well, he did pee on the couch.
Wait a second, I just realised.
That was a conscious choice.
You peed on my couch!
No, no. That wasn't enough.
That's when you should have put on your little hat.
Not now, after we've gone through it into this mess!
For badness sake, you can hash all this out in prison.
Guards!
Brain freeze!
I'm sorry. I'm just having trouble processing this right now.
"So you've discovered your pet is a secret agent".
I don't want your pamphlet!
He's coming back around!
You have got to be kidding me.
For crying out loud.
What, they didn't teach you how to get out of this in spy school?
Snap.
Look! There's a logo on this parachute!
He's got his own logo?
All this time we're like,
"He's a platypus. He doesn't do much".
Well, apparently you do!
You do... You're...
You're tangled up in the...
Wow! Saved by unconventional architecture.
May I please see your papers?
Show me your papers or be destroyed.
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me a soda.
Get me!
I'm a Georgia O'Keeffe painting!
Fourth and Main.
What? No tip?
Never mind. I'm good.
Looks like they're gone.
You're a secret agent?
And you've been living with us this whole time?
Was that evil guy right?
Were we just a cover story to you?
I mean, were you ever really our pet or part of our family?
Well, apparently not, 'cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us.
Anyone else around here leading a bizarre double life?
Put your hand down, Ferb.
You're a secret agent!
He's a secret agent!
You're right, Ferb. We've got to concentrate on the task at hand.
We've got to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start!
That's right! The remote!
I knew that would come in handy.
All right, let's go home.
Wait, that's not our dimension.
Nope.
Now this thing's broken.
We're gonna need some help.
I know! Let's go find us!
Wait, I just realised, you could have been cleaning your own litter box this whole time!
We are not done with this conversation.
So tell me, other dimension me, what do you see here?
An ordinary platypus.
And now what do you see?
Perry the Platypus!
You know, I'm starting to see why you haven't become ruler in your dimension.
All right, Mr Eviler-Than-Thou, just how did you manage to take over the tri-state area anyway?
Simple, I used an army of big, scary robots.
We should do lunch sometime.
Wow, that is scary.
I tried that robot thing once, too.
I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet
so no one could reach them.
And march!
I think I've said enough.
I still don't get it.
If we're the same person, why are you so much better at being evil than me?
True evil is born through pain and loss.
You see, when I was a small boy back in Gimelschtump,
I had a toy train.
Then, one day I lost it.
Choo-Choo?
- That's... That's it?
- What do you mean?
That's your emotionally scarring back-story?
That's your great tragedy?
Dude! I was raised by ocelots.
I mean, literally.
Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's all?
That's all you got, really?
I had to work as a lawn gnome!
I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing!
Neither of my parents showed up for my birth!
Well, how did you feel when you lost that toy train?
I never lost that toy train...
Well, maybe if you had, you'd have done better.
Since you have neglected to take over your tri-state area,
I think I'll go over there and give it a shot myself!
Great! We can be a team!
Yeah, right. A team.
Wait, was that sarcasm?
No!
Yeah! Right there! I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic.
Okay, Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?
How should I know?
They never showed up for me to return serve!
That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton.
So I went to get some Victory Gum.
A tradition as old as the game itself.
Don't play with me, young man.
Where is the giant platypult they built?
I don't know. Seems to have vanished.
Really? Did you hear that, Stacy?
The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown-up, could see it.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for all of this.
And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig!
Who's laughing now, Wayne?
The logical explanation is the mysterious force.
The real question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers?
Why doesn't it want them to get busted?
Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard?
What? Existentialist trading cards.
They came with the gum.
Wait, he's right! I should just ask it!
- I'll bet I can reason with it.
- Reason with it?
Candace, it's a force that you made up.
No, I know what I'm talking about, Stacy!
- Come on!
- Where are you going?
To my back yard!
The heart of the mysterious force!
Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
All right.
Sucker!
Well, this should be our street.
But it sure looks different.
Dad?
Boys, what are you doing here?
You'd better get inside before the Doofbot catches you.
I'm off to the factory. See you next week.
Wow! Well, I guess we'd better get inside.
You might want to...
I mean, these guys might not know that you're not really a... You know.
Boys! I thought you were in your room.
Get inside!
And get your dooferalls back on before someone sees you.
If you need me,
I'll be hiding in the basement.
That was weird.
Let's find the other us's.
And... Hey, I got a one!
Pick a Doofopoly instruction card!
"Conform". I can do that.
Hi, guys.
No! They're replacing us!
I must not have conformed quick enough.
No, no, it's not like that.
We're you guys from another dimension.
- Different dimension? Is that allowed?
- Apparently.
Look! Perry's back!
Where have you been?
We've missed you so much.
Phineas, he's not your Perry.
He came with us.
Sorry.
Wait, can I hold him a little longer?
It's just that, well, he left one day and never came back.
He's been gone for a long time, and I'm really worried.
All right, you know the only time we're allowed to make noise is on Doofens Day.
So keep it...
Are there four of you in this room?
Five, counting Perry.
I see nothing.
I have plausible deniability.
Boy, your Candace is much less curious about what you're up to.
What do you mean?
Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing.
Summer? I think that was outlawed a long time ago.
You guys don't have summer?
Well, that's... That's terrible.
Summer. It sounds dangerous yet oddly compelling. What is it?
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda
Dripping down your chin
It's summer! Man, where do we begin
Summer
It's ponds and pools and garden hoses
Trying to beat the heat
Summer
Bicycles and roller skates
And even just bare feet
It's also surfing tidal waves
Creating nano-bots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent
Or driving our sister in...
Wait, maybe we're going too fast.
Summer
It's crickets and cicadas
And a glass of lemonade
Summer
It's sitting with your brother
In the back yard
Under the shade of a big tree
That's what it means to me
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
Wow. Summer sounds like a blast.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Like this summer for instance.
We built a rollercoaster, we became one-hit wonders, we travelled through time...
This is a message for other dimension Perry the Platypus.
If you turn yourself in,
I promise not to hurt your little friends.
If you don't, all bets are off.
And then we launched ourselves from a giant Perry the Platypult and...
You are kidding me.
You're actually sneaking away again?
So nothing's changed.
Did it ever occur to you that we could help you?
That we could have made a great team?
But I guess you can't have teamwork without trust.
You don't have to sneak away any more.
We know your secret. You can just go.
I walk away from you, my friend
I hope that this is not the end
Of all the times we figured out
How to seize the day
As I walk away
You know, I used to think you couldn't spell "platypus" without "us".
Well, you can.
But it would just be "platyp".
Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella.
Who is Isabella?
The girl who lives across the street.
Mom says that talking to neighbours can be dangerous.
- It's true!
- Well, it's time you met her.
Come on, you'll like her.
What about the Normbots?
Relax! We've been avoiding them all day.
If you're really careful, you can...
Okay, we've got to be more careful than that.
May I please see your identification?
Display your travel papers or be destroyed.
Display your travel...
I can't stand these things.
- Hey! It's Buford.
- Who are you guys?
We're Candace's brothers.
We're going to Isabella's.
Are you part of the Resistance?
I used to be in the Resistance, but I got so good at it that I started resisting them.
Behold, the Other-Dimensionator!
Actually, this is the other Other-Dimensionator.
The Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension.
Okay, step one is, push this button.
Step two, stand back in awe!
That's it?
Now that I think about it, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed it to...
You know...
- To work.
- Great, now I need those two boys?
- Perry the Platypus!
- Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me two sodas!
Listen, Perry the Platypus,
I know I told you if you turned yourself in
I wouldn't hurt your friends, but change of plans!
Now I need to hunt them down which might involve a little hurting.
I know that makes me a liar, but hello! Evil!
Come on,
Isabella's house is right through...
What you doing?
Isabella?
- Do I know you?
- Hey, Isabella!
Him I know. Buford, what do you want?
I thought you were resisting us?
I was helping Candace's brothers cross the street.
Candace has two sets of twin brothers?
No, he and I are from another dimension.
We're trying to get back.
All right, girls, release them.
Why would you want to come to this dimension, anyway?
Well, we didn't mean to come here.
Now we can't get back unless we can fix this device.
Well, we may have someone who can help you. Dr Baljeet.
- Baljeet!
- That's Dr Baljeet to you!
Were you not listening?
Here is the crux of your problem.
Think of the universe and all of the many dimensions as circular.
The energy flows between the dimensions like this, clockwise.
Say this is your dimension and this is our dimension.
You travelled with the flow of energy.
So going clockwise would be easy!
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy, overloading the local power grid.
I have prepared a little song to help illustrate my point.
If you travel through dimensions
Going clockwise makes it easy
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy
overloading the local power grid
I know, it needs a chorus.
Anyway, without the 8 million gigawatts, you would have to go clockwise, the long way around.
Theoretically, you would get home but there is no telling how many dimensions you would have to go through.
Well, do you think you can help us get enough power to open the window backwards so we can get home?
Well, we should probably ask our leader.
Ask your leader what?
Who made the topiary out of wild parsnips?
I'm allergic, and it's messing up my voice.
Candace, you're the leader of the resistance?
What are you two doing here?
Never mind, I'll deal with you later.
You two,
I've been spending all these years trying to keep my brothers safe and suddenly their faces are all over the Doofen Channel.
We're just trying to get home.
Well, what's stopping you?
- Right now? Quantum physics.
- Baljeet.
We need to generate
8 million gigawatts for inter-dimensional travel.
Then we've got work to do.
- Isabella, start redirecting the power.
- Aye aye!
Gretchen! Monitor the Doofen Channel.
Make sure we're not raising any alarms.
- I'm on it.
- Buford, keep resisting.
- No!
- Excellent.
And will somebody get rid of that topiary!
Thank you.
Great and powerful mysterious force!
I know you are just trying to protect my brothers but I am simply trying to protect them, too, from their dangerous inventions.
Show yourself so that
I may reason with you!
Maybe we should build a shrine to it?
Candace, that's...
- It's a mysterious force!
- It's a mysterious force!
Ferb! I think we got it!
It looks like home!
What do we do now?
I don't know.
I can't believe it actually worked.
Well, thanks, everyone. Hey, where's...
That's right.
This just in. Our supreme leader has announced the capture
of public enemy number one, Perry the Alternate-Dimension Platypus.
I guess we won't be seeing him any more except as a platyborg.
It's 3:30.
We now conclude our broadcast day.
Now go to bed!
- We've got to save him!
- No.
Too risky. You've got to get back to your dimension.
We're not going anywhere without our platypus.
I thought you told us he was just using you as a cover.
I know what I said. I was hurt.
But even if it was all an act, he's still a part of the family, and we're not leaving him behind.
I may never be able to open this again.
It doesn't matter.
We're going back for him.
- Well, then you're on your own.
- Fine.
Just tell us where
Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners.
- We have to help them!
- No, we don't.
Yes, we do. Remember how we felt when our Perry disappeared?
Oh, criminy, I must be crazy.
All right, we can get there through the tunnels.
- Yes!
- Let's suit up, people!
You know what, Stacy?
I'm tired of the mysterious force pushing me around.
- I'm going to show it who's boss.
- Candace, wait!
I will try to keep it open for as long as possible but the window is very unstable.
Even the slightest disturbance will cause it to collapse.
- Like that, for instance.
- Hey, Candace.
You guys are so...
Wait, why are there four of you?
Oh, these guys are from this dimension.
Are we inside the mysterious force?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
And why is Isabella suddenly fashionable?
What do you mean, "suddenly"?
Seriously, where are we?
Candace, I'm sure you have a million questions, but right now we have to save Perry from being turned into a cyborg.
- What?
- We'll explain on the way.
So, how do I dress in your dimension?
Hey, is that me? I look good!
Oh, no. You two stay here.
- But we want to help.
- That's an order!
Wait, so in this dimension,
Perry is a secret agent?
No, in this dimension he's a cyborg.
So, where is he an agent?
That would be in our dimension.
But we're not in our dimension now.
Okay, I'm having trouble processing this.
Now I wish I hadn't thrown away that pamphlet.
And why are we in mine cars?
This'll take us as far as the underground entrance to Doof's headquarters.
From there we go up the ventilation shaft.
The detainment centre is on level four.
And the snack bar's on level five!
If there's time.
Buford.
I'm just gonna get some nachos.
So, if there's another me and another them, then there must also be a Jeremy Johnson here, too, right?
Oh, yeah, Johnson, Jeremy.
Leads a three-man strike team on the north side. Good soldier.
Good soldier?
That's all you think of him?
Don't you think he's dreamy or cool or even cute?
Tell me at least you think he's cute.
Cute doesn't win the war, kid.
Well, I guess.
But what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?
Look, "Candace" is it?
No offence, but fun isn't really on my agenda.
You know, since Doofenshmirtz took over the tri-state area, even though I was a little girl,
I've been focused on one thing and one thing only.
- He's going down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, I know.
But what about BFF's?
Or slumber parties?
Or busting your little brothers?
Busting my brothers?
I spent every day of my life trying to protect my little brothers.
I had to grow up pretty quick around here to make sure they didn't have to.
Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing.
It is what it is. I'll do whatever it takes to protect the ones I love.
Thanks, sis!
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here to help.
- Sir, we're nearing the target!
Don't move!
Okay, people, change of plans.
This is as far as we go.
We're not going to help them?
No, we're gonna get you two home where it's safe.
- But we wanna...
- Look, this isn't our fight.
It's their fight, and you two shouldn't have gotten involved.
Maybe none of us should have.
Now we're out of here.
I don't remember it being so dark down here.
- Dark?
- That's because it's a trap!
And if it was light, you would have seen us and run away, hence ruining the trap!
I think they get that.
Perry!
We... We, well, came to rescue you.
So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped.
We didn't have a lot of time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but I guess we could have created some sort of diversion just in case...
Yeah, we could have thought this out more.
I got you and I got your little friends, too!
Game over! You lose! I win!
Mark this the hour of your doom,
Perry the Platypus.
Three forty... I got one of these watches with just the little hash marks.
It doesn't even have the numbers on it.
Let's just say it's between 3:30 and 4:00,
Eastern Standard Time.
Whoa!
I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!
They're getting away!
I knew this was a bad idea.
All right, everyone in the cars!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Isabella, start the motor!
Yes, sir.
I got it.
You two, keep your heads down and remember your training!
We never had any training!
Well, keep your heads down!
Consider yourself trained.
This is going to be close.
All right, you rust buckets. Let's dance.
Can you do that?
Well, apparently.
I am so in love with her right now.
- What?
- Nothing.
If we can get to the north tunnel before they get to us,
I can trip the security door.
Isabella, can you give us more throttle?
It's all the way in, sir!
All right, hang tough.
This is going to get hairy.
Can we make those turns at this speed?
Well, we're about to find out.
There it is. We should be okay if we can hold off these...
- Can we do that?
- No. Keep your head down.
We're slowing down, sir!
Keep it on the floor!
It's on the floor.
There's too much track, sir.
I don't think we're going to make it!
Everyone, to the front now!
We're going to have to cut loose these...
The motor's overheating!
Sorry, guys. You're on your own.
What are you doing?
My job. Protecting you two.
We've got to go back and help them.
That's not our fight.
But you just abandoned them!
We could have made it!
We could have all made it!
Or we could have all been captured, and I wasn't going to take that chance.
These are the tough choices, people.
Somebody's got to be the adult here.
You two are safe, and that's what's important.
- But... But... But...
- End of discussion.
Man, I had my heart set on those nachos.
Look, mysterious force,
I feel a little awkward talking to you since I didn't believe in you at first because, you know, it's crazy.
But then I saw you eat my friend, so I've made a little shrine here.
It's nice.
There's a banana and Mr Miggins.
So I hope this makes up for the whole disbelief thing.
Are we... Are we good?
Now you have no choice but to fix my machine.
- No.
- That's not one of your choices.
- Fix the machine!
- No.
Can I... Can I say something?
So, I think I'm up-to-date on the whole Perry Agent thing.
Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon, but who exactly is this guy?
- Fix it!
- No.
Look, I would make myself do it but apparently he's an idiot.
- Hey!
- Fix the machine!
- No.
- All right, then, you've forced my hand.
Fix the machine!
- No.
- Really?
When I was your age, I did anything a puppet told me to do.
How old do you think we are?
I don't know. One, two?
You know, it's hard to tell with the one eye.
Anyway, I don't know why you're being so uncooperative.
All I'm asking you to do is make my machine work so I can invade and conquer your world and enslave your loved ones.
See, that's just it.
Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?
Self-destruction?
Self-destruct... Wait a...
Wait, that's it. I remember now.
They took out my self-destruct button.
I don't know why I put it back in, but here.
I'll just rewire this, like so, and there.
It's working! It's working!
It's functioning properly!
Well, look who just became redundant.
Send them to their doom!
Yes, her, too.
Yes, yes, everyone.
- Doom, doom, doom and doom.
- Doom!
Jinx! You owe me three sodas.
Okay, doom for him, too.
What? But I'm you!
Doom!
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
I was doomed by a puppet,
I'd have two nickels.
Which isn't a lot. But it's weird that it happened twice, right?
Welcome, doomed guests.
Come on, keep trudging.
Doom is thataway.
I would say, so far, adulthood gets about a three.
You know, this may be as good as it gets.
And now for my all-time favourite game.
Poke the Goozim with a stick.
Surrounded by lava.
My second favourite game is backgammon. Love it!
Hold the phone. I could be useful.
What if you need a kidney or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend?
Or another kidney?
Doom!
Pooh.
Cranky, cranky, cranky.
Oh, I love the crank!
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
Blah, blah, blah, two-car garage, etcetera.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life!
Whoa, deja vu-ish.
Perry, check out that guard!
Keys!
Cool! Look out!
Is this the plan?
Tell me this isn't the plan!
You are tampering with the property of...
Let's make omelettes!
Can you get a little more lift out of this thing?
I think I just bruised a kidney.
My bicycle is missing!
Yes! Go, Goozim!
- It's muffin time, sir.
- Already?
Okay, I see where you're going with this...
I officially prefer our dimension!
This may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school.
I just couldn't get the hang of all the climbing...
Oh, great, you caught it! Unlock me!
Are you even paying attention?
That's right. It can wait. Later!
More guards!
- It's muffin time, sir!
- You're broken!
Yay, other dimension Candace!
Phineas!
Catch!
The remote!
Perry, let go!
What? No, no, don't let go.
Perry! Trust me!
Two words! La-va!
Trust me!
They opened another portal!
Go after them!
And her!
That banshee screaming girl.
Get her, too!
Thanks, Perry the Platypus.
Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
I use aggression to mask my insecurities!
The portal!
Boy, I could go for a lemonade.
The portal closed, sir.
Oh, pooh.
Oh, well. Time to start the invasion!
And somebody get me a muffin!
But it's not muffin time, sir!
All right, follow me.
We're going around clockwise.
If there's no hospitality
Just get out of town
You can't be lying on formality
And saying...
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no obligations
Nothing holding you down
Find a new situation
And say
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no time to waste on sentimentality
Get out and find yourself a brand-new reality
You've got to find yourself a brand-new reality
A particle duality
A new dimensionality
- Yeah, yeah!
- I guess I'll see you around
Sometimes it's appropriate
To stop for a snack
If you do then I hope you get back
I guess I'll see you around
Hopping clockwise through dimensions
Is a dangerous thing
But it seems to help a lot if we sing
And we can sing about
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
I guess I'll see you around
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand-brand-brand-brand
I guess I'll see you around
All right, how about two Kafkas for your Dostoyevsky?
Stop wasting my time, Buford.
Wait, I think this is it.
- Where have you guys been?
- This is it!
I spy with my one little eye a new tri-state area that's one dictator short of a dictatorship.
Well, that's all about to change.
Pretty soon I'll be ruling over two tri-state areas, a virtual six-state area!
Fly, fly, my Normbots!
We've got some oppressing to do!
Why is Perry wearing a hat?
We don't have time to explain.
We've got to try and stop an evil...
It's too late!
They're never going to fire her and...
Hey, did you see that?
No, I... What's going on?
Oh, my!
- What is it?
- It's a comb over!
I know, I should really just shave it.
Not happening. Not happening.
My watermelon!
All vehicles must stop.
It's okay! It's a rental!
Oh, great!
Albuquerque '93 all over again.
I wish other-dimension
Candace was here.
She took out, like, 30 of them
- with a giant stone lawn gnome.
- Agent P! Our agents are being
overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension.
You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him.
Aye, aye, sir. We're ready to serve.
Oh, no. You kids need to go home where it's safe.
With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together.
We're a team now.
Nope, far too dangerous.
And besides, our insurance won't cover it.
Tell them, Agent P.
Come on, Perry.
Let's go kick some robot chassis!
Perry?
Wow, I guess we're going home then.
Hey, where's Dr D?
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Thompson? It's me, Heinz.
I think I left my keys in the other dimension.
Can you buzz me in?
- Who is this?
- Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Your neighbour.
For, like, 12 years.
- Who?
- I live in the penthouse.
I wear lab coats a lot.
I speak with the accent
I am currently speaking to you with.
Just like my neighbour upstairs.
Yes, exactly!
He's not home.
You'll have to come back later.
No, no, wait.
This is just beautiful.
I decide to do the right thing, and I end up in a cell.
Well, at least my brothers are safe.
What lesson am I supposed to be learning here?
I'm Jeremy Johnson.
I'm here to rescue you.
Johnson, Jeremy?
Yes, sir.
And I picked up a couple new recruits.
We found a way to bypass the entire security grid. It was cool.
What? You brought my little brothers?
Are you out of your mind, soldier?
I didn't know they were your brothers, but I should have known.
They're smart and courageous, just like you.
You think I'm smart and courageous?
Well, yeah, sir.
Good work, soldier.
We should really get out of here while we can.
Most of the Normbots are away in the other dimension.
We can slip away pretty easily.
The Normbots are in the other dimension?
This isn't the time to escape.
This is the time to make our move.
Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Boys, wait. Thanks for rescuing me.
I'm really proud of you both.
And we're proud of you, too, sir.
I got nachos! Who wants some?
Nobody?
Mysterious force, you can see I'm really trying here.
Please bring back Candace!
Oh, hi, Stacy.
And I also want a car.
I still can't believe
Perry wanted us to go home.
I mean, look at this.
There's robots all over the tri-state area. And now for the weather.
There's robots, Phil! Robots!
You'd think he'd need all the help he could get...
Hey, what's that?
Ferb, do you hear that?
It's Perry's locket.
It's like a homing device.
Shall we?
This must be Perry's lair.
Welcome, Phineas and Ferb.
Please insert the key.
Do you have a key?
Please insert the key.
Good try.
Please insert the key.
Please insert the key.
That's odd. It's a shaped keyhole.
It kind of looks like...
Wait a minute.
Phineas and Ferb, this message is top secret, for your ears only.
If you are hearing this, the tri-state area is at emergency alert level Alpha Red.
Agent P needs your help.
How does he know we'll know what to do?
He knows you will know what to do.
He also knows you two are the only ones capable of helping him
because you two are the only ones capable of creating these.
Auto-scan replication initiated.
Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today.
You have a new leader.
Put on your dooferalls. 36-inch waist.
No way! I'm a 34!
So, I guess you trusted us after all.
I was wrong. It was not for me!
Heads up!
Platyposterior coming through!
Now this is what I call busting.
All right, everyone!
Let's kick some robot chassis!
Yeah!
All right, that is very good.
Phineas! Anything we can do?
Yeah! Musical accompaniment!
We're gonna kick some robot chassis
So you better tell your robot nation
To say a robot prayer
'Cause you better prepare
For an automaton annihilation
You think you're gonna take us down
Well, mechanical man, you just try it
You're gonna ride that rail out of town
This is a robot riot
I think you know what I mean
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you down
And sell you for scrap metal
But I'll keep enough
To build myself a trampoline
'Cause your momma was a blender
And your dad was just a washing machine
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to a chop shop downtown
You know that you'll be dreading
This android Armageddon
I think you better check your fluids
'Cause I know you're sweating
You know you're gonna lose
And sing the robot blues
You'll blow a fuse
And take a robot snooze
I will deactivate you
Because I kind of hate you
Don't want to beat around the bush
- We're gonna decimate you
- This is a robot riot
Oh, man, it's on
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
And put you back together
In a new configuration
Just to mow my lawn
'Cause your sister is a fridge
And you know her light is always on
This is a robot riot
Robot riot...
We've got to do something about that portal.
Ferb! We're gonna go try to close the portal!
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
What?
I've had just about enough of you, you...
What is on this!
I was wrong, Stacy, about everything.
I'm not a grown-up.
I can't control mysterious forces.
I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Candace, where are you going?
I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom!
And I'm gonna fail!
No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
You borrowed sugar from me this morning.
I don't have any sugar.
I had to borrow some from my neighbour this morning.
Yeah. That's me!
He's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced.
That she remembers.
Mom!
Candace, what are you doing here?
You got to come outside and bust the boys!
I'm not leaving now.
The girl is about to forgive the guy for the cliché misunderstanding.
Well, after she battles these robots.
This 3-D is amazing!
Ferb, we'll handle it down here.
Go help Phineas!
Come on, you stupid thing. Work!
So that dish must be what's controlling the robots.
Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I could just take out that...
Yeah!
No, you don't.
Now the baseball is on the other foot.
Or however that saying goes, I'm not...
I'm not really sure.
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?
You know, all that's going to happen from you guys coming up here is that I'm going to have a brand-new platyborg.
And maybe even a boyborg!
Try saying that five times fast.
Boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg...
I guess it's not that hard, never mind.
You know something, kid?
You've been a thorn in my side all day long.
But that's about to change right now!
No!
My babies! No, what have you done?
It's weird that
Perry's a secret agent, huh?
Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect.
Has anyone seen my pants?
Yeah, they're over there.
Wolverines!
Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!
Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn.
Great! Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Ferb! Bro, I just hit the best home run ever!
Now, tremble before me!
No, I'm down here.
See, one last trick up my sleeve.
It's me! I'm the trick up my own sleeves,
'cause I'm in the sleeve, get it?
Pearls before swine.
Hope you got your 3-D glasses
'cause I'm coming at you!
Yeah!
Hey!
What? I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
I got a little something just for you.
Here.
Choo-Choo!
Yeah, it's mine.
See, I told you I never lost it.
It was in a box in my pantry labelled
"VHS tapes".
Go figure. Anyway, you can have it.
I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you!
Heart melting, back-story resolving, evilness diminishing.
It's the least I can do.
You know, I don't even know what I was thinking with the whole evil robots thing.
Actually, when I look around,
I'm really embarrassed.
Let me clean this up.
Look! Self-destruct button.
You.
Yeah. Here we go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, hurry, hurry!
Do I even need to say
"there's nothing there" any more?
Mom, you can say it all you want.
There's nothing there!
Whoo-hoo! I did it, I saved the world!
You can go back to your movie now.
Yeah, you know what?
We're totally cool now.
I'm just gonna go return to my home and live out the rest of my days with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!
Home. It's good to be...
Book him, ladies.
You know, my crimes against humanity had just completely slipped my mind.
Hey! Did you guys just see that?
I saved Danville!
Good job, soldier.
So what'll you do now?
Wow, I haven't thought of anything but busting Doofenshmirtz for years.
- I don't know.
- Well, I know what interests I'd pursue.
Hey! Here you all are.
I'll take that under consideration.
What about you, Candace?
You know, after all of this,
I'm gonna give myself a little more time to be young.
It's not such a bad place to be.
You know what? Me, too.
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for telling us all about summer, you know, opening our horizons, and teaching Ferb classical guitar.
Hey! It's our Perry! Perry!
Looks like the evil was fried right out of him.
Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
Are you kidding?
That makes him extra cool!
Thanks so much, guys.
I'm glad we could help.
Man, this has been the greatest day ever.
Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent.
Yes, yes, the next 15 minutes should be a real hoot.
Well, then, of course,
Agent P will be sent away forever.
- What?
- You didn't know?
- Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
- We threw it away.
- Does anyone read those things?
- I tried to warn you, sir.
Kids, I'm sorry but now that
Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him any more.
That's why you didn't want us to know your secret.
So we'll never see Perry again?
There has to be another way.
Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe.
You know too much.
Now I never wished so much that I could unknow something.
Sir, maybe there is a way.
What about
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Amnesianator?
I never built an Amnesianator.
I think I'd remember building something like that.
Well, that might work.
But you'd all have to agree.
So our choice is to either forget the best day ever, forget the biggest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?
Well, we've had a lot of great days.
But we only have one Perry.
Agreed.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right, everybody.
Tall kids in the back.
Just need to do a little more programming here and we'll be ready to roll.
Hey, buddy, Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes.
You know, we thought we'd finally met the real you when we found out you were Agent P, but the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you.
You are now and always have been a great pet and a great friend.
We're gonna miss you, Agent P.
I love you, pal.
Sir, are you crying?
No, I'm sweating through my eyes.
Okay, sir. We're ready.
Okay, Karl. We're set.
- Major Monogram?
- Yes?
So none of us will remember any of today?
That's right.
Good!
Isabella!
- Hit it, Karl!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
