- Yeah, hold on a second.
- What were you saying?
- Taxi! Taxi!
- All right, what are you saying?
I'm asking why you thought you didn't have to be on time.
Finally. God, come on.
Sorry.
Yeah. At last.
Good. Great.
Alex, cue three.
Sound, cue four and tabs, go.
Soul of the age
The applause, delight
The wonder of our stage
Our Shakespeare, rise!
Our Shakespeare.
For he is all of ours, is he not?
The most performed playwright of all time.
The author of 37 plays, a hundred and fifty-four sonnets, and several narrative poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language.
And yet...
And yet, not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand.
In 400 years, not one document.
He was born the son of a glove maker, and at some unknown time, armed but with a grammar-school education, he went to London, where, the story goes, he became an actor, and, eventually, a playwright.
He died at the age of 52.
And he was survived by his wife and two daughters, who, like Shakespeare's own father, were irrefutably illiterate.
His will famously left his second-best bed to his widow.
But it made no mention of a single book or manuscript.
Our Shakespeare is a cipher. A ghost.
So let me offer you a different story.
A darker story, of quills and swords.
Of power and betrayal.
Of a stage conquered and a throne lost.
After him!
There he is!
Get him!
Over there!
Hurry!
- Break it down!
- Go, lads!
Put your back into it!
Search the place!
Jonson!
- Jonson!
- That way!
I know you're in here!
Jonson, show yourself!
Come out!
Out with you, Jonson!
I'll smoke you out like a rat!
- Torch it!
- Give it up!
Torch it!
Burn everything!
Do you smell that, Jonson?
That's the smell of your theater going up in flames!
Arrest him!
Shall we to the Tower?
Make way!
This is none of your concern!
Chain him here, then leave us.
He was carrying nothing but a quill and some empty pages.
You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright.
Son of William Jonson, glassblower.
Yeah.
And have you ever been arrested before, Mr. Jonson?
I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course
I've bloody well been arrested.
Ask him about the plays.
Plays?
Oh, which would you prefer,
Sir Robert Cecil? A pastoral?
An historical? An historical pastoral?
An hysterical historical pastoral?
We are not interested in your plays, Mr. Jonson.
We're interested in the plays given to you by Edward de Vere,
Earl of Oxford.
Um... I am sorry, sir.
I am not sure I know whereof you speak.
Where are the plays?
What plays?
Wonderful, isn't it?
Well, it's certainly big.
I promise you, Edward, you've seen nothing like it!
Mm. There won't be puppets, will there?
Step aside, step aside!
Make way for my Lords of Oxford and Southampton!
And here come the fool and the jester again, methinks.
The stagecraft is quite spectacular.
Far more elaborate than anything I've seen at court.
Sheart, what a damn'd witty rogue's this!
How he confounds with his similes!
Better with similes than smiles.
And whither were you riding now, signior?
Whither should I ride but to the court?
Oh! Pardon me, sir.
Thou never saw'st my gray hobby yet.
Have you such a one?
No!
Pbbt!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ale!
Marlowe, spot me a few pence, will you?
Henslowe owes me for Shoemaker's Holiday.
That's because no one saw
Shoemaker's Holiday.
Ale!
Kit, isn't that one of your unrequited loves in the box?
The Earl of Southampton?
But with whom?
By the beard, that's Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford.
Had his own acting troupe for private court performances.
I wonder if he needs any material.
Certainly not yours.
What, the noble, there? Ha-ha.
Why, he's a gull! He's a fool! Aah!
The poor man's brain is lighter than his feather!
Ha-ha-ha.
Enough!
Jonson, wonderful dialogue.
It's absolutely wonderful.
Shh.
Oh. Ow!
Sorry, sire.
Will.
Will Shakespeare.
That is not ale in that goblet, is it?
Ale?
Me?
Drink during a performance?
I am a professional, Mr. Henslowe.
- Make way!
- Utter professional.
Stand aside!
- You stand aside!
- Watch yourself!
This play has been declared seditious by Lord William Cecil!
Why don't you disperse
William Cecil's arse?
Arrest that man!
Disperse!
This play is seditious and will not continue!
Seditious?
It's a comedy!
There's nothing seditious about it!
Is that right?
And you know this because...?
Because I wrote the bloody thing.
Arrest this man as well!
What? No, wait...
Please! I'm a poet, for God's sake!
I'm not a criminal!
Thus endeth the brief career of one Ben Jonson.
Disperse!
William Cecil, you're an arsehole!
Well, off to Essex House, then.
I'd like to see his arse dispersed!
Disperse!
Out. Henry, how many people were at that play?
I'm not sure.
Two thousand? Maybe more.
How many performances are there of a play like that?
Five or six, I suppose.
New service.
By the beard.
Ten thousand souls, all listening to the writings, the ideas of one man.
That's power, Essex.
And if there's one thing the
Cecile understand, it's power.
New service!
And since when did words ever win a kingdom?
I'll keep my sword, thank you very much.
Out.
Henry, some of my men have intercepted some of William Cecil's correspondence with King James of Scotland.
Cecil's all but promising him the throne.
To James?
Elizabeth would never...
Elizabeth is old. III.
And yet she refuses to name an heir.
But a Scotsman?
On the Tudor throne?
That is why we must do everything in our power to ensure the right man succeeds Elizabeth.
A man deserving of the Tudor crown.
I ask you for the support of you and your men, Henry, if it comes to a fight, for me to seize the throne.
You know you need not ask.
I stand with you, as I always have.
Be careful, Henry.
Always concerned for me.
What would you have me do?
Deny him.
The son of the queen?
That is rumor alone, Henry.
Rumor?
All you have to do is look at Essex to see the queen's reflection.
Everyone thinks he's her son.
My lords.
And I, for one, would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though he may be, than a Scotsman.
My only desire is to see the next king be the rightful king.
But what Essex contemplates will lead to civil war. No.
If this is to be done, it must be done carefully.
Tie her off there.
I agree, my lord.
My Lord of Southampton.
Sir Robert Cecil.
Have you seen Lord Essex?
He is in the viewing chamber with Her Majesty.
Alone?
With your father in London dealing with troubles in Ireland, who else should the queen turn to but Essex?
By the grace of God,
Her Majesty, Elizabeth,
Queen of England
Wales and Ireland.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- God bless Your Majesty.
God bless Your Majesty.
Ah. Your Majesty, my Lord of
Southampton has a gift for you.
A gift?
Yes, Your Grace.
Though not from me.
Are you the gift, my gracious little man?
No, no, my most majestic Majesty.
I am a free man. My gift is a play.
A play?
Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication and heresy.
Tell your master that Her Majesty...
Will gladly accept.
That is, of course, if Your Majesty so desires.
Comedy or tragedy?
Comedy, Majesty.
Comedy. By whom?
By Anonymous, Your Majesty.
Anonymous.
I so admire his verse.
Lead us to this play.

If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended.
That you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a dream.
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Most wonderful.
It was so funny.
She really loved the donkey.
Edward, Edward, when can we do it again?
Ah. There he is.
Your father tells me you wrote this evening's play yourself.
I did indeed, Your Majesty.
You sport with me.
Compose something.
Now?
Yes, now.
On what subject, Your Grace?
On truth.
For truth, is truth, though never so old, and time cannot make that false which once was true.
My Lord of Oxford, it seems you have added a poet to your family's line of warriors.
I am as accomplished with sword and musket as I am in verse.
Are you indeed?
It is my only desire to be Your
Majesty's most trusted servant in matters both of war and state, if you will but have me.
Why, Lord Cecil, we may very well have found your replacement.
We hope not too soon,
Your Majesty.
And what thought you of our young lord's play, William?
If plays are indeed such a sin, I pray that I do not find my salvation until very late in life.
Jonson!
Benjamin Jonson!
You have been released.
Got powerful friends now, don't you?
Ship oars!
Ahem. My lord.
The Tudor rose.
The most beautiful of flowers, do you not think?
I assume I owe my freedom to you.
That is true.
And it was hard to come by.
One does not cross my father-in-law lightly.
Lord William Cecil.
I have the questionable distinction to be married to his only daughter.
It was helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name.
My release was not officially sanctioned?
Don't be an idiot. Of course it wasn't.
But you are free, are you not?
I enjoyed your little comedy, Jonson.
You have great potential.
Thank you, my lord.
But its politics did have quite an effect on the Tower.
My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious.
Politics. My play has nothing to do with politics.
It's just a simple comedy.
That showed your betters as fools who would barely get food from plate to mouth without the cleverness of their servants.
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise, it would just be decoration.
And all artists have something to say.
Otherwise, they'd make shoes.
And you are not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?
Francesco?
A play, my lord.
One you shall stage Bankside.
Stage?
Under your name.
My name, my lord?
I can't very well use my name, can I?
I'm the 17th Earl of Oxford.
The Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Viscount Bolebec,
Lord of Escales, Sanford and Badlesmere, etc. No.
I have a reputation to protect.
In my world, one does not write plays, Jonson.
People like you do.
Yes, my lord.
My lord, you wrote an entire play.
I know how difficult that is.
Not a play, Jonson.
I've written many.
No doubt many more than you yourself.
A good number performed years ago, others never seen by a living soul.
And you want me to put my name to this play?
No, I mean you to put your name to all of them.
All of them?
Don't look at me like I just gutted your pet dog.
I mean to make you the most popular, and therefore most monetarily successful playwright in London.
I wish you Godspeed and good morrow.
My lord, I really...
This is for your trouble,
Signor Jonson.
And for your silence.
If you break that silence, mm, not so good for Signor Jonson.
Tell me about this play.
It was an anonymous gift.
Essex insisted it be performed just to spite me in front of court.
Of course he did.
What was it about?
Some nonsense about fairies and cherubs.
And dancing asses.
Edward, our poet earl, has returned to court.
Father, it was just a play.
Know how long it took to banish them from her presence?
She adores them!
And Edward knows it!
Mark my words, he has done this to spite us.
Edward wishes to choose the next king.
Haven't you convinced the Privy Council to crown James of Scotland the next king?
Nobody has a better claim.
Except one of Elizabeth's bastards.
You mean Essex.
He despises us.
We shall lose all of our royal licenses, our property!
I shall convince her to send Essex to Ireland to quell the Catholic rebellion.
Southampton will follow.
And if God is watching, neither will return alive.
And if he is not...
Robert!
Robert, come here!
I am sorry, my Lord of Oxford.
My son prefers the company of himself.
May I present to you my wife,
Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne?
I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
The realm lost a great man with your father's death.
We hope you will be happy in our house.
Are you going to live here forever?
No. Only until
I reach my maturity.
Why?
Because the queen has bade it so.
My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of state.
The queen and I hope to make that so.
To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors.
From 7 to 8, you will be tutored in French by Mr. Crane.
My Lord of Oxford.
Nine to 10 is Greek with Mr. Simmons.
Is that Homer?
No. Plato.
- Then cosmography with Dr. Richards.
- My lord.
Two to 3 is geography and history.
And 4 to 5, fencing.
And, uh, composition?
Poetry?
This is a Puritan home, my lord.
We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God.
A sin?
Surely there must be room for beauty and art in life, my lord?
Not in this household.
You were losing anyway.
I was also winning.
Unh.
Really?
I think we can assume
I've mastered the Punta Riversa.
Now I think we should move on to the Punta Sopramano.
Perchance with that, you will best me.
Yes, my lord.
Apple for you, sir? There we are.
Was it any good?
How should I know?
You haven't read it?
I promised I'd finish Eastward Ho.
He's a nobleman, you say?
Well, is he powerful, rich?
Ooh. Then you have to do it then, don't you?
Will, I came to London to be a great and soaring poet.
To be the conscience of our times.
The soul of the age.
To ch-change the world, not...
Ch-change the world?
What, with rhyme?
Yes. Why not? Why can't a man change the world with words?
"I'll make you the richest and most popular playwright in London."
Bollocks. I can do that myself, thank you very much.
He's an amateur.
A complete and utter amateur.
Last week, gardening.
This week, writing. Next, hawking.
No. No, I won't do it. It would be an affront against the Muses.
How much money did you say he gave you?
You think my name can be bought?
No, no, no, not at all. No.
I think we should keep your good name quite intact.
King Philip of Spain sees the current Catholic revolt in Ireland
GS 8 weakness Of OUTS.
A weakness to be exploited.
Ireland?
There are reports of his sending financial aid, even troops.
We must act quickly. We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops...
Replace?
With whom?
I would recommend his lordship, the Earl of Essex.
No, that's impossible.
He cannot be spared.
We value his counsel greatly.
Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Spain.
Essex could not, unfortunately, remain in the Privy Council while he is in Ireland.
And who would you advise to replace him?
Sir Robert Cecil.
Your son?
Yes.
Though he is my own advisor first,
Your Majesty, my son second.
Yes. Yes, yes.
Ah. Very well. Send Essex to Ireland.
And we will place Robert on our Privy Council.
I saw a play this last weekend,
William.
It made me think of... many things long past.
I'd like to see more of them.
Has Edward been happy,
William... with your daughter?
Murdered?!
By your own hand.
He was stealing my poems.
He was doing my bidding!
Yours?
Of course! As soon as Robert told me you were ignoring my express orders...
Robert? Robert told?
Enough!
Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household.
Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance, not poems.
My poems are my soul.
You have placed me in a grave position, Edward.
I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part.
We can claim self-defense.
He drew sword first.
But there is something
I wish in return.
My daughter is young and impressionable.
She has feelings for you, Edward.
It is to be expected, living in such close quarters.
Sir, for the last three years, you have seized much of my inheritance.
Hold your tongue, lest you make a claim you cannot retract.
I was legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses.
You suggest you be reimbursed the rest of my estate through your daughter's bed.
No.
This is how I suggest we keep your noble head from the executioner's block.
... duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained.
One was the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord and faith of God.
Secondly, for the mutual society, health and comfort that the one ought to have of the other in prosperity, into the which holiest state these two persons here present come now to be joined.
Henry the Fifth, by... no one?
Why would any of you admit to trying to better me in historical drama?
Comedy, yes. Tragedy, perhaps.
Ben, waiting to see how it's received before you lay claim?
O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, a kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars, and at his heels should famine, sword, and fire crouch for employment.
The flat unraised spirits that have dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object:
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?
Or may we cram within this wooden O, the very casques that:
Suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high, upreared and abutting fronts, the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
Hyah! Make way!
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
Into a thousand parts divide one man and make imaginary puissance.
Think when we talk of horses... that you see them, printing their proud hoofs in the receiving earth.
For 'tis your thoughts, your thoughts that now must deck our kings.
Make way!
This story shall the good man teach his son.
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother, be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England now a-bed, shall think themselves accursed they were not here!
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks, that fought with us upon
Saint Crispin's Day!
My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.
The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us!
All things are ready, if our minds be so!
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
You know your places.
God be with you all!
Francesco, do you see?!
Do you see?!
Si, signor.
Kill the Frenchmen!
Death to the French!
Down with the French!
Down with the French!
Your sword!
We'll follow you!
Edward!
William Cecil convinced the queen that only Essex can save Ireland from revolt.
I've pledged to go with him.
I, for one, wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours.
Playwright!
Playwright! Playwright!
Playwright! Playwright! Playwright!
I ask for your blessing, Edward.
I cannot give it.
If he is to be my king, it is my duty to be with him in battle.
Will?
Sorry to disturb your entertainment.
Henry!
Thank you. And it's all written in verse. Thank you.
Got it, got it, got it.
It's just... It's just been...
Phew. Only... I...
I want to thank my actors, whose great, great acting has brought my words to life due to their most wonderful acting.
Um... And, uh, thank you!
An actor!
An actor, for God's sake!
My lord, I thought that...
You presume to think on my behalf?
My lord, your voice is completely different from mine.
Voice? You have no voice!
That's why I chose you!
You, um...
You at least kept my name from him?
And will continue to do so?
A romantic tragedy.
In iambic pentameter.
All of it? Is that possible?
Of course it is.
My lord.
Will Shakespeare.
William...
Shake“.
Speare.
My lady.
Who was that man?
I've seen him here before.
Edward.
We must discuss our daughter's dowry.
Dowry?
She cannot marry without a dowry becoming to the daughter of the Earl of Oxford.
I can give her Brooke House and 100 pounds.
A hundred pounds, Father?
Mother?
That is all we have to give at the moment.
Leave us, Bridget.
Edward, our family is in financial ruins, and you...
You... play the flute while Rome burns.
Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.
My God.
You're... writing again.
After you promised.
Anne, you should have seen them, the mob.
They didn't sit there like the reptilia of court, faces motionless, fangs momentarily retracted.
No! They climbed the stage!
They fought the French!
Stop it! Stop this at once!
Why must you write?
Why must you continue to humiliate my family?
The voices, Anne.
The voices, I can't stop them.
They come to me.
When I sleep, when I wake, when
I sup. When I walk down the hall.
The sweet longings of a maiden, the surging ambitions of a courtier, the designs of a murderer, the pleas of his victims.
Only when I put their words, their voices, to parchment are they cast loose, freed.
Only then is my mind quieted.
At peace.
I would go mad if I didn't write down the voices.
Are you possessed?
Maybe I am.
This is incredible, Ben.
The whole bloody thing in verse.
It's really not that difficult if you try.
Oh, and have you ever tried?
Ahh. But soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
I'll have little trouble parting the legs of barmaids.
You cannot play Romeo.
What? Why not?
I'm perfect for the role.
I will not let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles.
Only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins.
And his codpiece.
No, Ben.
Ben, I'm an actor.
Every inch of me, right down to my very toes.
I want to...
No, I crave to act.
So bloody well act like a writer.
And, for God's sake, keep off the stage.
Writers do not have time to act.
What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?
I know not, sir.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night, like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done,
I'll watch her place of stand, and, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Hmph.
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
My Lord of Oxford.
- That's the Earl of Oxford.
- Majesty.
Yes, and doesn't he look handsome?
Most definitely.
We very much liked your play tonight.
Your young King Henry reminded us of you.
Did he?
Brash, yet brave.
A boy and yet a man.
Fair on the eyes.
Fairer to the ear.
We are glad of your return from the continent.
Two years is too long without such excellent amusements.
Had I known my absence would have caused Your Grace so much longing,
I would have returned much, much sooner.
Your wife must be pleased to have you once more present at her side.
It is but a small comfort to me.
I am returned only under my father-in-law's insistence.
Cecil told me your match was one of love.
So he would wish.
But how could one love the moon after having seen the sun?
Which country did you like the best on your travels, my lord?
Italy, Your Grace.
Hmm. Italy. And why is that?
The weather? Or the food?
No, no. Their theater, which they call la comedia dell'arte.
And, of course, the women.
The women?
They were more, uh, clear... with their desires. When they want something, they take it.
They do not wait to be taken.
I can't decide.
Are you Prince Hal?
Or Romeo?
No.
No.
You're Puck.
Puck?
Yes, Puck
Puck would never fight for you in the Netherlands.
The Netherlands?
Well, why not?
It's an open secret you support the rebels against Spain.
You are commissioning Englishmen to help fight their cause.
Spain's loss is England's gain.
Is this why you bedded me?
For a commission?
No, no, it's just...
Leave me.
How dare you? How dare you?
I command you to leave my presence!
O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O, stay, and hear, your true love's coming.
That can kiss, both high, and low.
No further, pretty sweeting.
Journeys end in lovers' meeting, every wise man's son doth know.
What is love?
'Tis not hereafter.
Present mirth hath present laughter.
What's to come is still unsure:
In delay there lies no plenty.
Then come, kiss me.
Sweet and twenty.
Youth's a stuff will not endure.
You will stay in England, and in my chambers.
I could do it if I wanted to.
Do what?
A play in bic... In bia...
In iambic pentameter.
It's not that hard.
Think so?
Have you ever tried?
Of course not.
But I could if I wanted.
Well, it wasn't all in verse.
Ah. You see?
Even easier.
Henslowe wants Romeo to run for a fortnight. A fortnight!
Innkeeper! Drinks for everybody!
Innkeeper! Billy!
A fortnight?
The maids love the romantic tragedies.
Precisely why I avoid them.
Oh, well, worry not. A one-trick pony.
He'll never do it again.
How have you made division of yourself?
An apple, cleft in twain is not more twin than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
Most wonderful!
Great Caesar...
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Speak, hands for me!
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
Tyranny is dead!
Freedom, liberty, and enfranchisement!
- Death to tyranny!
- Freedom!
Yes! Freedom! Freedom!
Liberty!
- He was Scottish, wasn't he?
- Yeah.
Round about the cauldron go.
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone, days and nights has thirty-one.
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn!
Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, but not express'd in fancy:
Rich, not gaudy.
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.
Come, come, and sit you down.
You shall not budge!
You go not till I set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you.
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?
HelP, help, ho!
What, ho! Help!
How now! A rat?
Dead, for a ducat, dead!
- Ah!
- Oh!
I am slain!
O me, what hast thou done?
Nay, I know not. Is it the king?
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Not a day too soon for Cecil!
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them. to sleep, no more, and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
'Tis a consummation, devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep,
Ay, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.
There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life.
Ah!
- Give it good heat.
- This hot enough?
You're certain of this?
William Cecil was murdered.
Not literally, of course.
He was a character.
Fictional character.
But the metaphor was clear for anyone to see. And see, they did.
Will you shut it down?
Your service to his lordship is once again greatly appreciated.
He butchered you! Not only in front of court but the entire city as well!
We must arrest this Shakespeare and...
No, Robert.
If he really is as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob.
We cannot maintain authority if we are laughingstocks!
Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God.
You must think more deeply, Robert.
You must compensate for your malformations.
You must compensate with the gifts God did give you.
With cunning. With ruthlessness.
It's from
King James of Scotland.
James is aware of the queen's affections for Essex and of the rumors of his birth, and he is justly concerned.
You will write to James.
You will tell him that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand.
And then tell him,
Essex will not return from Ireland alive.
God does indeed require our help in this matter.
This is how kings are made, my son.
So it was with Elizabeth, so it shall ever be.
James will expect you to do the same for him and he will reward you for it.
But we must do one thing more.
Like Essex,
Edward must be removed.
Edward?
You must bribe someone.
His fencing master, perhaps.
Promise him a fortune if he kills him.
I am with child.
Are you certain?
Two cycles have passed, my lord.
And I wish to marry him.
Marry him?
Your Grace, he is already married.
I can do what I want.
Can you?
Most of the Catholic princes of Europe seek to topple you and end your Protestant reign.
All that stop them are the Channel and the hope they marry you and end your realm by other means.
I love him!
Would you risk your throne for him? Hm?
Would you risk England for him?
We must do as we have done before.
You must go on progress, somewhere isolated, accompanied by only those whom you most trust.
After the birth, I shall find a suitable house for the child to be reared in.
And Edward?
He must never know.
What have you done?
I am praying.
She will not see me!
I've gone to her, she will not receive me, and now she's gone!
She is on progress.
Where?
Where did she go?
What did you say to her?
She does not ask my advice on matters of the heart.
If she did, she would not have chosen you.
You must've known she would go elsewhere.
You're neither the first nor the last of her lovers!
Go back to my daughter, Edward.
She will accept you with open arms.
Behave as your great title demands you behave.
Tend to your estates, your investments.
And make me a grandson.
An heir.
It's difficult to write, is it not?
After something like Hamlet?
It eats at you.
At your soul.
Why do you think Will hasn't been arrested?
He murders a caricature of old William Cecil himself, and still whores it all the way to Westminster and back.
Ahem. Perhaps they haven't noticed.
I made sure they did.
You informed on one of your own?
To the Tower?
Watch who you judge, Ben.
We do what we have to to survive and survive well in this life. All of us.
And Will is definitely not one of us.
You know he's illiterate, don't you?
Oh, he can read well enough.
How else could he learn his lines?
But the man never actually learned to form his letters.
So who did write Hamlet?
A nobleman.
Yes, but which?
You know, don't you, Ben?
Careful, Kit.
You sound like one of your plays.
Ben! Tell me.
We can go to him together.
Guarantee his anonymity.
For a price.
You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit?
Last year. For Every Man.
That's why I was arrested.
Wasn't it?
I had nothing to do with that.
Ben. I'll just go to Will.
And he'll tell me because he has so much more to lose than you.
And you'll profit nothing from it.
Nothing.
Rebels have stripped the northern borders.
Then we must march south and take Cahir Castle.
My lord, it is a well-defended fortress.
Holy Mary, mother of God.
A thousand men, maybe more.
We cannot attack such a force.
So, what would you have me do?
Spend the entire spring encamped?
I am sent to Ireland to end this infernal rebellion, not to idle...
Robert!
Must have been a cutpurse.
Nowhere is bloody safe any more, I'll tell you that.
What's happened?
Dead body.
Now my tooth hurts.
The stench. He's done.
- It's that playwright.
- Kit Marlowe.
It's not right.
No, it's not.
What's going on, Beaulieu?
Stop it!
Beaulieu! Aah!
Francesco.
He tried to kill me.
The mighty Sampson!
What a beast!
Have you seen his claws?
I need more money.
You already make more than any playwright Bankside.
I want to build my own theater.
One that properly, um, fits the scale of my work.
A theater? For your work?
I've found someone who will make me a coat of arms, and change the Stratford lists.
Impossible.
Eight shillings on six dogs!
I'll take that bet.
Eight shillings on the bear.
That's a terrible bet, Ben!
Make do with what you've got, Will.
I won't be your beggar.
Oh, no. This isn't a request, Ben.
I'll have more money.
Or what? You'll slit my throat, like you did Kit's?
I know he went to you last night and was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms.
You're mad.
So terrifying!
Be careful, Will.
Kill me off, you won't have any good plays to act in after this is done.
I'll have my guineas, Ben.
One way or another,
I will have my guineas.
Unleash the dogs!
Go on, bear!
Thank you. Drink up, Francesco.
Another one where that came from.
Francesco?
Two this time.
- When shall I return?
- In a fortnight.
Over there.
Just pull in there.
- Listen.
- Yes, master.
When you cut my roses,
- be gentle.
- Yes, master.
Yes, master.
My lord.
So you are the famous
William Shakespeare whose labors I have so enjoyed.
I am at your service, sir.
I need more money.
I beg your pardon?
My lord, my expenses have enlarged.
Aggrandized.
Since all this began.
Aggrandized?
Yeah, aggrandized. And, um, if your lordship does not agree to an increase in my fee, then I shall be forced to make certain facts public.
Hey. Have you any idea to whom you are speaking?
I am addressing the writer of Hamlet.
And of Juliet and her Romeo.
Am I not?
Out. Get out.
As you wish.
My lord.
Wait.
How much?
Four hundred pounds.
A year.
No, pay him.
Come.
Is this wise?
They have already tried to kill you once.
Wisdom,
Francesco, is a quality I have unfortunately never possessed.
Edward? You know I will have to leave court soon.
She will be furious if she finds out about this.
She abandoned me.
She still loves you.
No, she doesn't.
You don't know, do you?
The queen, she had your child.
My Lady of Oxford, welcome home.
I cannot be certain, Your Majesty, when the relationship began.
But sometime soon after your return to court.
You are sure?
They have not been very discreet.
There is more, Your Majesty.
The lady is pregnant.
Arrest them.
Arrest them both.
What is the meaning of this?
Edward!
Unhand me! Bessie!
Edward!
Bessie!
Edward!
Whoa.
Your whore gave birth last week.
The queen has decided to release you.
Time does indeed, it seems, heal all wounds.
Here are the conditions for your release.
One, you will not acknowledge the child.
Two, you will never see the mother again.
Three, you will avoid court at all costs.
Her Majesty would prefer never to be reminded of you, in any way ever again.
Banished.
No, you have the freedom of the kingdom, just not of the court.
Those are her terms.
Here are mine.
Go back to my daughter.
Make some effort to make her happy.
Finally act according to your station in life and accept the responsibilities of your great title.
My lord?
I, too, have a condition.
I will go back to your daughter, if you tell me the name of the child.
I do not think the whore has named the bastard.
No.
The other one.
The other one?
Who told you?
I will go back to your daughter.
I will give you as many grandchildren as she can bear, or I can remain here.
There is no record of the true birth nor any trail that leads back to you or the queen. The foster parents never knew the truth and both now are dead.
The name.
Make even a hint of this to the child or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I will see your head and the head of the boy on the block!
So it's a boy.
Good. Sword up. Again.
Keep it high.
Mind your knee. Straight.
Hello.
Hello.
My lord.
I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.
My lord.
They say you're an earl as well.
I am the Earl of Southampton.
Well, then. We shall be earls together, shall we not?
In the sweat of thy face, shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, for from it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return.
We wish to recall Essex.
We feel a terrible void without your father.
A wise decision, Your Majesty.
It will give him an opportunity to respond to these reports.
They say Essex is in peace negotiations with Philip of Spain.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
And that Essex has promised Philip, all of Catholic Ireland in return.
In return for what?
Spain's support of Essex's claim to the throne of England.
It is, as of yet, just rumor.
Bring Essex back to London,
William.
Robert, Majesty.
My father's death has been a great loss for us all, Your Majesty.
A curse on you, Robert Cecil!
- Leave the people alone!
- Down with the hunchback!
See that it's done.
My lord. From the queen.
Mm.
It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill you, now he tries to kill your name.
I must speak to her. Myself.
We leave with the tide.
Boys! My boys!
I've got it. Oh.
The herald just finished it about an hour ago.
What do you think?
It's quite colorful?
Well, heh, what in God's name is it?
My coat of arms. Ha.
It cost a fortune, but you can call me a gentleman now!
I can't quite make out the motto.
"Not Without..."
Right.
Oh. Heh.
"Not without right"?
You...
You went to him, didn't you?
You lying knave. You went to him.
Can I get you a drink? Billy!
Will isn't even a writer.
He can't even...
Yeah, all right.
No, get... Unhand me!
Here!
Here!
A quill?
Write something for us.
Amaze us with your verse.
Your wit.
No? Well...
Try astounding us with the letter E.
Or an I?
It's just a straight line.
Well, you haven't got any ink.
My lords...
- Wait for me!
- Please, my lords!
Your Majesty.
Are you...? Uh...
Get out. Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
He burst in! Armed.
Is it an uprising?
Is it a revolt?
Shall I order his arrest, Majesty?
Yes, yes. No, no.
I don't know. I don't know.
What does he want?
Has he gone mad?
No.
Unfortunately for us,
Your Majesty, he is quite sane.
He simply believes he is your royal equal.
Edward! Halt!
Edward, thank God you're here.
Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal licenses.
Confiscated his property.
She believes every lie Cecil tells about him.
Fight him in London and you prove true every rumor and every lie
Cecil has ever told.
Then what do you suggest I do?!
Let myself be arrested?
No.
No.
I will visit Elizabeth myself.
Alone.
How?
Cecil will not let her see a letter without reading it first.
I will not send a letter.
I will send a book.
She will call for me.
While I am with her, you will come not with an army or swords, but with her loyal subjects.
The tinkers, the cobblers, the bricklayers of London.
A mob. All of them, all of them, calling for Robert Cecil to be banished from the court.
Words.
Words will prevail with Elizabeth.
Not swords.
And how do you suggest
I raise this mob?
Leave that to me.
Oh, Will, Will!
Aah! Hey!
Hold your tongue, putana, and get out.
Out.
Who's gonna pay me, then?
What's all this about?
Begin rehearsals immediately.
It must not be performed until I tell you, and you may only have a day's notice.
Well, that will be expensive, keeping all the actors ready, and having props made cheaply.
All right.
Oh, and congratulations.
You've had a poem published today.
Uh... Pub... Published?
What, do you mean like in a book?
She trembles at his tale
- And on his neck-
She sinketh down
Still hanging by his neck
He on her belly falls
She on her back.
Ooh. I like this.
'Fondling, ' she saith, 'I'll be a park
And thou shalt be my deer
Feed where thou wilt... 'Aww
Seeds spring from seeds And beauty breedeth beauty
Thou wast begot
To beget is thy duty.
Bylaw of nature
Thou art bound to breed...
Majesty.
How do you find me?
You...
You are the sun, Majesty.
The glory...
Liar
It is hard to believe that once I was young.
I was beautiful.
Your father knew me as such.
Have you read the book?
He writes to me.
To remind me of that beauty.
That love.
How I took him.
How I adored him.
Did your father tell you of the child?
Which one, Your Majesty?
Edward's and mine.
He still lives?
Is he well placed? A nobleman?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Who?
I am your queen. Who is my son?
The Earl of Southampton,
Your Majesty.
Majesty, you are not having doubts about James of Scotland...
Ah. James.
The son of Mary.
She tried to take my throne.
No son of hers will ever rule.
I'll decide what is best for my people. Not you.
I have bid Edward to come to me when I return to London on Monday next. It is decided.
And so, in spite of death
I shall survive
In that my likeness
Still is left alive.
... love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph.
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, cheated of feature by dissembling nature, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world, and that so lamely and unfashionable, that dogs bark at me...
Aw. Come on, Burbage.
I'll be arrested.
Arrested? Ha.
It's just the one performance.
I need a drink.
I'll be at the Mermaid.
I'll be back in a minute.
You left the hump on.
Burbage. Ah.
Wonderful theater.
Wonderful.
So only one performance, then?
That bad, is it?
Hardly. That's Will's new play.
Richard the Third. We've been hired to perform it free to the public.
Free?
Aye.
Some anonymous nobleman's paid for everything.
Been rehearsing all week.
Uh... SO, uh...
My best so far.
I'm sorry, Ben.
Will, he's part owner, and, uh...
I'm sorry, Ben, but I had to agree.
No Jonson plays at the Globe.
Ever.
- Mm.
- Drink.
Best villain in theater history, Richard Ill.
Better than Mephistopheles?
No doubt. Jonson's not bad for everyday scalawags, but Shakespeare...
My God, the main knows his villains.
Not even the Greeks compare.
To Shakespeare!
And villainy.
To Shakespeare and villainy!
- Try your luck.
- Thanks.
Fancy a tumble?
Only tuppence.
Wet in all the wrong places.
- I haven't got all night, Jonson.
- I...
There is a...
There is a play to be performed on Monday.
All Bankside is talking of it.
The Tragedy of King Richard the Third by William Shakespeare.
He kills the king and half the royal family to get the throne.
I know who Richard Ill was.
Yes.
But in William Shakespeare's version, he is played as a hunchback.
As a what?
Shall I close the theater?
No.
Pray, stand back!
The theater is full!
There is no more room!
The theater is full!
You can't get through the crowds.
We've turned hundreds away.
Never seen anything like it.
And you said I was mad for building a bigger theater.
Has Francesco left?
Yes, my lord.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
He's got a hunchback.
And all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean.
It's Cecil, isn't it?
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths, our bruised arms hung up for monuments, our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
nor made to court an amorous looking glass.
I, that am rudely stamped,
and want love's majesty to strut before
a wanton ambling nymph.
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
deformed, unfinish'd,
sent before my time into this breathing world,
scarce half made up,
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me...
Hear this! Hear this!
By order of the Privy Council, the bridge must be cleared immediately!
Anyone resisting will be taken to the Tower!
Clear the bridge! Clear the bridge!
Nothing rash.
No man is to draw sword or fire musket without direct order.
Yes, my lord.
And the mob?
When does it arrive?
By the stroke of 4.
The streets are quiet.
They are all at the theater.
Edward promised us a mob, and a mob we will have.
I am determined to prove a villain...
A pox on you!
A pox on Cecil!
Why is Oxford's man with the ground lings?
Where?
There.
... and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, by drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams, to set the...
To set my brother Clarence and the king...
What's going on?
♪ To see a fine lady
Ride on a white horse ♪
♪ Rings on her fingers
Bells on her toes ♪
♪ She shall have music
Wherever she goes N'
Me lord?
Her Majesty will be with you shortly.
Young, valiant and wise and no doubt right...
Down with Cecil!
Richard!
Get over here!
Off to Stratford, then.
To Essex House!
- To Essex House!
- We want Essex!
Oh, my God.
Essex! Essex!
Francesco!
To Essex House!
I have to warn him!
Francesco!
The Tower!
Francesco!
Francesco! The Tower knows!
How do you think it ends?
No doubt, tragically.
- Join us!
- Francesco!
Essex! Essex! Essex!
For Essex! And England!
Francesco! I went to the Tower!
To your positions!
Make ready!
Open fire!
Fire!
Aah! MANI Go back!
- Francesco!
- Signor Jonson!
We are betrayed! Unh!
No!
Robert, wait.
No more waiting.
We go as we are now.
Mount your horses.
Mount your horses!
On your horses, everyone!
To the queen! Hyah!
To the queen!
Hyah!
It's a trap!
Spread out!
Fire!
Freedom!
Fire at will!
Fireworks? Huh.
Majesty! We must away.
Essex is in armed revolt.
He's come to overthrow you.
But, Edward...
You must flee quickly, Majesty.
He means to kill you and take the throne for himself.
Please, Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Aah!
Robert!
The men!
We must yield!
We yield!
Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
Deliver up your arms!
Put down your arms.
Keep still!
Lay down your muskets.
We yield.
Yield, sir!
She will not forgive him this,
Edward.
Essex will be convicted, and executed for treason.
As will your son.
What?
Didn't you think I knew?
My father told me all his secrets.
All of them.
Though the most fascinating was not made known to me until after his death.
He hated you, Edward.
But still, he married his only daughter to you.
He wanted his grandson to be an earl.
No, Edward.
He wanted his grandson to be a king.
Elizabeth had several bastard children, Edward.
Not just Essex and Southampton.
She was 16 for the first.
Bloody Mary was still queen and our future Gloriana was out of favor.
No one thought her very important at all, except my father, of course.
And when her first child was born... a male, my father took it and hid it.
The grandson of Henry VIII.
The foundling, of course, had to be reared a nobleman.
John de Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task.
You lie!
Do I?
Why did he work so hard to become your guardian after your father died?
He had it all planned.
Years in advance.
He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry you to his daughter, and after
Elizabeth's death, proclaim you... heir.
His own grandchild to follow you on the throne.
But he could not possibly predict what kind of failure you would become!
How you would fail in politics!
Ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy.
All to write...
Poetry,
Nor could he have predicted that you would commit incest.
Oh.
Delicious, isn't it?
Right out of a Greek... tragedy...
Elizabeth...
What? would never have...
Slept with her son?
I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth.
Though you never know with the Tudors.
They all have had such strange tastes in bedfellows.
You could have been a king, Edward.
And your son after you.
Except for the fact... that you... were you.
Sentence has been passed.
They are to be beheaded.
Essex tomorrow.
Southampton in a week.
Your son is going to be killed... by his own mother.
Put that in one of your plays.
Robert Devereaux,
Earl of Essex, is hereby executed for treason by Her Gracious Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth on the 25th day of February in the year of our Lord,
Strike true.
God save the queen!
Leave us.
All of you.
Sir Robert, you as well.
You look old.
I thank Your Majesty for seeing me.
You cannot have him.
He is our son.
He is a traitor, like Essex.
They only wished for a voice equal to their birth.
You caused this.
Your play, your words.
I know what you've done.
Your head should be cut off, not his.
Then take it, in our son's stead.
Neither they nor I conspired against you.
Cecil alone was our aim.
The King of Spain, Mary, four French kings, eight popes, they all wanted me dead, but here I am, because of the Cecile, my commoners.
We would have protected you.
You? My loyal earls? Hm.
I could only ever trust the Cecile because their wealth, their power, their survival, all depended on me.
Me.
Let... our son live.
Does...?
Does he know?
And if I give him to you...?
He will never learn of it from me.
But, Edward?
None of your poems, or your plays will ever carry your name.
None.
Is she still refusing to sleep?
For three days now.
And her physicians?
They say she's dying...
Majesty?
I have brought you a document to sign.
The Act of Succession.
I beseech you, sign.
O God, bless this crown, and sanctify
King James of Scotland, now and forevermore as King James the First of England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland.
God save the king!
God save the king!
No, no, no, stop!
It's supposed to be a bloody comedy.
You lot are about as funny as the plague.
Will!
Will Shakespeare!
Hello, Ben.
A command performance for our new king.
Fraud! Charlatan!
A counterfeiter of wit!
You came to me, Ben.
You came to me.
Will! You're nothing but a puppet!
Get out!
Stay out!
Master Jonson?
His lordship is asking for you.
Excuse me, my lady.
Thank you, doctor.
Jonson.
Come closer.
Did you know my family can trace its peerage back further than any other family in the kingdom?
We fought at Crecy, at Bosworth Field, at Agincourt.
When I inherited my earldom,
I was one of the richest men ever to breathe English air.
And at last breath,
I shall be one of the poorest.
Never a voice in government.
Never a sword raised in glorious battle.
Words.
Merely words shall be my sole legacy.
You alone watch my plays and know them as mine.
When I hear the applause, the cheering of the audience, the hands clapping,
I know they are celebrating another man.
But in that cacophony of sounds,
I strained to hear two hands only.
Yours.
But hear them, I never did.
You have never told me...
Never... told me what you thought of my work.
I find your words the most wondrous heard on our stage.
On any stage.
Ever.
You are the soul of the age.
Promise me, Jonson.
Promise you'll keep our secret safe, that you won't expose Shakespeare.
My lord...
I've seen it in your face.
He vexes you.
How could he not?
But he is not your burden.
He is mine.
All my writings...
"W plays, my sonnets... keep them safe.
Keep them from my family.
The Cecile.
Wait a few years and then publish them.
My lord, I...
I am not worthy of this charge.
I betrayed you.
I told them of your...
I have made it my life's work to know the character of men, Jonson.
I know you.
You may have betrayed me... but you will never betray my words.
What are those?
These are my...
My lady, your husband was-
Get out.
You, your friends, your blasphemous theater have brought ruin and dishonor to this family.
Ruin?
Dishonor?
My lady, you, your family, even I, even Queen Elizabeth herself, will be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper.
The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end,
whereof this pamphlet,
without a superfluous moiety.
What I have done is yours,
what I have to do is yours.
Being part in all I have,
devoted yours."
I can make all this go away, Jonson.
Or I can bring you so much
Pain.
Pain.
I know you have them.
All his manuscripts.
My sister saw you leave Oxford
Stone with them under your arm.
They were destroyed.
Burned.
Burned?
By your men.
Every word went up in flames when you torched the theater.
He's lying.
My lord, why would I lie?
He was something
I could never be.
An undeniable perfection that plagued my soul.
And to him,
I was nothing.
A messenger.
He tells the truth.
Let him go.
Guard!
Release him.
And, Jonson?
Better him, won't you?
Wipe his memory for all time.
I'm afraid that is not possible, my lord.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Marvelous.
Marvelous, marvelous.
Is it not marvelous?
O for a Muse of fire
that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention.
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.
We had seen some of this Shakespeare's plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert.
I must tell you, we enjoyed them immensely and look forward to seeing many more, now that we're in London.
I assume you're as avid a theater man as myself.
Of course, Your Majesty.
... that have dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object.
Robert Cecil remained the most powerful man in the court of King James, though he couldn't prevent the public theaters from becoming ever more popular.
William Shakespeare, however, spent the remainder of his days, not in the playhouses of London, but in the small town of his birth,
Stratford-upon-Avon, as a businessman and grain merchant.
Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be the most celebrated playwright of his time, becoming England's first poet laureate.
And in 1623, he wrote the dedication to the collected works of the man we call
William Shakespeare.
And so, though our story is finished, our poet's is not.
For his monument is ever-living, made not of stone, but of verse.
And it shall be remembered as long as words are made of breath and breath of life.
BELARUSFILM
CENTRAL PARTNERSHIP
Brest Fortress was built in the middle of the 19th century at the western border of Russian Empire.
Powerful fortifications, fort systems made this citadel impregnable.
New arms minimized the defensive qualities of the fortress... but not of the people who protected it.
About 20 years after WWII
Sergey Smirnov wrote a book that revealed the truth about defenders of the fortress.
On May 8, 1965 Brest Fortress was awarded the honorary title "Hero Fortress".
In memory of the fortress heroes, in memory of defenders of the motherland.

THE BREST FORTRESS
21 June 1941. Brest. City park.
We can have some ice cream.
Tell me about the movie.
Let's have some ice cream!
I remember everything.
At the city park, as always on Saturdays, there was dancing.
This is me.
Alexander Akimov.
A foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment.
My parents were killed in Spain in 1937.
My brother was my only family left.
And this is Anya.
Just Anya.
But for me she was more than
"just" Anya.
Hold on a minute.
I'll be right back.
Sasha, why are you not with the unit?
Moska asked me to help.
All their musicians left.
Last trumpet player left on Wednesday.
- Foster student of musical platoon Akimov!
- Yes, sir.
I order you to return to the Fortress immediately!
What are you yelling for? You are neither my father, nor the commander!
Why are you yelling in public?
Tell Starshina Kovalenko to punish you.
I'll be back to check on it.
And don't play so out of tune.
About turn!
Forward march!
And he calls himself my brother.
Family of military officer, please get together!
- Anya, come here.
- I am here.
Freeze!
It's easier to manage the regiment than you lot.
This is my home.
My fortress.
It's quite big.
Hard to explore all of it.
But I knew some places here that if I wanted to hide... no one would find me.
Thank you.
Brest city. Railway station.
There are no tickets today!
I'm telling you all, there are no tickets today!
There are no tickets.
No army reservation. Nothing.
I have only three days to go there and come back.
Ask those who told you that to give you tickets.
We don't have any.
There's nothing I can do.
Listen, my wife and my little child are in Daugavpils.
I must bring them to my place of duty.
July 20th. That's all I can do.
Remove the reservation.
Comrade commissar, I'm telling you as I would to my own relative.
I am forbidden to touch the reservation.
That's only for certain orders.
That means no?
Maybe it's for the better. Why bring them here when everyone is leaving?
What exactly do you mean?
So hot. Like in a desert.
What a day!
Hello, comrade commissar.
Hi, Nikolai.
- Bringing a movie?
- Yes, I am.
Come on, come on, come on!
Tugushev.
Kolya is fast, but Tugushev is faster.
Dear, I could not come yet. All is quiet at the fortress. There will be no war.
I am just unlucky.
Let's play again.
You didn't leave, comrade commissar?
How can I leave you?
Brought a movie?
Yes, I did.
- ... and some beer.
- Maybe we can do without beer?
Tomorrow is Sunday.
People rest on Sundays.
So I'll have some rest too.
Three beers.
And mineral water for the children.
He remembered the children!
We didn't forget anything, did we?
Let's go.
Did you bring it?
Yes, I did.
Probably about love again?
About love.
I got in trouble, comrade Starshina.
I suppose to punish you?
Where did he see you?
I played out of tune.
And my brother has a good ear.
- What did you play?
- "On the hill."
Learn it by the morning.
You will play it tomorrow.
Stop music!
Hrush, what are you doing?
Comrade lieutenant, this is some kind of "Swan Lake."
So when do you think the war with Germany will start?
I've been assigned to investigate the spread of panic rumors about war with our ally.
I believe and see that you are a communist, an honest man.
How could it happen then,
Pyotr Mihailovich, that you are being called a panic-monger?
Ask those who call me that.
Help me, Pyotr Mihailovich.
My rank is not very high.
But tasks before me are huge. l clearly see that you are not at fault here.
Who is spreading the panic?
I asked you to come here, so we could talk candidly.
- Who is it, comrade major?
- Me.
I blurted it out a couple of times without thinking that the Germans are going to attack soon.
Haven't heard anything like this from anyone else.
There is no panic.
Sleep soundly.
Look, lieutenant, if they attack, we'll all be trapped here like in a boiler.
8 thousand soldiers in the Fortress.
This mass of people will not have time to exit through the Northern Gates.
Everyone with their children, women, old ladies.
With all their stuff.
Most of the soldiers should be moved outside fortress walls, where main army units are positioned.
This is what l, a commander who has been through two wars, have been saying!
And will continue saying!
And what about the fourth army?
They will not abandon us here? Right?
They will not, if everyone is where they are supposed to be!
Here soldiers are in one place, commanders are in another.
Where soldiers are without a commander panic breaks out.
That's common knowledge, comrade lieutenant.
I understood you.
And I find our conversation to have been very useful.
But please keep it secret.
The hearing for your case is scheduled for the 27th.
Allow me to go, comrade lieutenant.
- A movie is starting at the clubhouse.
- Yes, sure.
- Hurry up.
- We'll be on time.
Sonya.
Will you stay?
Look how some people live.
Thank you, comrade major.
[German speech. ]
Petya.
Your tea is cold.
Go to bed, Katya.
This is how German subversives appeared in Brest dressed in our uniforms.
Loss of power and water in the
Fortress was the work of their hands.
What's wrong?
Today another defector from the Poles came to our outpost.
He said war is going to start today at 4am.
- You believe it?
- Of course not.
Only this week alone we caught ten of them, and each one keeps saying that today or tomorrow the war is going to start.
Actually, I'm upset because of Anya.
Our girl has grown up.
Before she used to tell me everything.
But now, whatever I ask, she just shrugs her shoulders and that's the end of it.
Maybe she is sick?
This sickness is called Sasha Akimov.
Our Anya fell in love.
That's how it is, daddy.
Remember you said we'd go fishing?
No, your parents won't let you go.
I'll leave quietly, when everyone is asleep.
Alright, Anya, you play for a bit, and I'll go have a smoke.
Let's get married!
Did you ask, if I want to?
You don't believe me?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
- Last name?
- Kolya.
I brought the movie.
22 June 1941
Trainings?
Can't we get some sleep.
I'll go see what's going on.
Get down!
What is this?
Trainings.
Run!
- Where?
- Home. I'll find you.
And you?
- Where's Anya?
- Don't worry, we'll find her.
Where's Anya?
Petya, is this war?
- Katya! Come on!
- Did you take everything?
Hold tight.
Run!
Katya, do everything like I taught you.
Go hide in the basement.
- Petya!
- Stay calm.
Come on, sonny.
- Your hat.
- When it quiets down, I'll come find you.
She will find us, won't she?
Stay here.
- And you?
- Don't go outside without me.
I'm leaving. Bye.
Run. Run!
Andrey!
Mom!
Hold her.
Don't fall for provocations!
Go! Go! Go!
I had imagined war.
But I could not have imagined war.
Not this war.
Everyone was expecting it.
But nobody expected it to come so suddenly.
Simple and scary.
I was running to that house.
That was the meeting place.
In case of war.
That was written in the instructions manual.
But that manual was probably left there.
In the house that was destroyed.
- You can't go there!
- Let me in!
No arms without commander's orders!
I was not allowed to carry arms.
But I had my own weapon.
For which I did not need permission.
Seems to have quieted down.
Mommy...
Sonny...
Crawl to the basement.
Run, sonny...
You can't come in here!
Fortress. Volynsk Fortification.
The hospital.
You can't!
Surgery is in progress!
Fortress. Kobrinsk Fortification.
Northern Gates.
Stop panicking!
Stop panicking!
Fortress. Kobrinsk Fortification.
Eastern Fort.
Go back!
Back to the barracks!
Stop panicking!
Back to the barracks!
Lad!
- Play!
- What?
Play anything!
Stop!
Stop!
Lad, are you nuts?
Run for your life!
- Where's your weapon?
- Get lost!
Commanders, come here!
We are lieutenants.
Lieutenants? I don't see it.
Get yourselves in order.
And report properly, otherwise l will shoot you as panic-mongers!
Yes, sir.
Everyone return to the barracks. Take weapons and take up defense positions.
At the double!
Fortress. Homsky Gates.
Where are the Russians?
Only Germans are on air.
Maybe this is trainings?
What kind of trainings is that?
As you were!
Sorry, comrade regiment commissar.
Stop panicking!
Is the commander here?
I see.
I am taking command.
Starshina, get the regiment together, give out arms.
Disperse at the windows.
Don't let the Germans cross the bridge.
Don't waste ammo.
Continue trying to contact the city.
I am Fortress...
Fortress. The 9th frontier post.
Listen to my orders, to arms!
Not enough arms!
They are buried under the rubble.
- Chief pilot officer?
- Dead.
Everyone, who has weapons, come to me.
The rest - try to get whatever you can from underneath the rubble.
Germans!
Frontier post...
... to battle!
Follow me!
Need a man on first floor.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
We're holding down defense.
Battle in progress.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Fortress. Barracks of the 132nd NKVD battalion.
What unit is this? Who is in charge?
I want to see the commander!
NKVD lieutenant Vanshtein!
As your superior officer
I order you to leave the barracks and, after breaking up into smaller groups, make your way out of the Fortress...
If we leave our positions, the Germans will break into the fortress, and here we can keep holding them off, till reinforcements arrive.
Execute the order, lieutenant!
Two divisions are on their way here.
Further sacrifice of people's lives is senseless.
- And you, sergeant?
- Senior sergeant Novikov.
Do you know what happens for disobeying an order?
Comrade major, I'm sorry. I don't know you.
Can I see your documents?
Of course.
You are right. I commend you for your vigilance.
And your boots please.
- What about boots?
- Show me your boots.
Our boots have nails that are round, the German have square ones.
Look.
Square!
Stop!
The badge is German.
But the nails were round.
Sonya!
Kolya!
- Kolya, I'm here.
- Sonya, I'll be right there!
Germans are retreating south.
Sonya!
Kolya!
Quiet!
I can't take this anymore!
I'm so scared!
The Germans are there!
- Please!
- Quiet! It's me.
Don't cry. I know that you are strong.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Comrade commissar, look!
Our people from the hospital!
Look. l see a nurse there, who treated me earlier.
What's gonna happen, comrade commissar?
Starshina, you are coming with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Leave your weapon.
Everyone else disperse at the windows.
Take aim at chest level.
Follow me.
What a choice of cover.
Down!
Everyone go to the basements!
We need to go to Brest.
Find out what's the situation there.
Is the task clear?
Yes, sir.
Execute.
Look how many people they killed!
Ammunition.
Get in.
Do you have ammunition?
What ammunition? Get in!
Let's go. To the Northern Gates.
Kobrinsk Fortification.
Officers housing.
I was looking for my brother.
We lived here.
Our family.
And the Pochernikov family.
- Uncle Vanya!
- Crawl to the window.
Have you seen my brother?
Help me.
Shura don't.
Come here.
Sasha, get out of here.
No.
That's an order.
What are we going to do?
I'm not letting them take me captive.
I'm with you.
I understand everything.
Without you and the children I do not want to live and I'm not going to.
Forgive me.
You forgive me.
Go look what they are up to.
Go back. We won't get through here.
We couldn't get through.
We're waiting for reinforcements.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Comrade major!
- Tanks are coming!
- Easy, lieutenant.
If only we had an anti-tank weapon!
I told them so.
Third one.
I wish we had an anti-tank gun.
To battle!
Get the grenades ready.
Gather arms.
Take positions.
Don't fire without an order.
Our iron is burning hot. You will be mine. You're not going anywhere.
Who fired?
Fire.
Our folks.
Aim.
Fire.
Koptun, grab the grenades.
Load.
Attack!
Charge!
What's your name, son?
Lieutenant Akimov.
This is how my brother died.
On the first day.
On that first endless day.
The very first order to retreat during the course of the war... was given by the German commander ship on the 22nd of June 1941 at 11:00am... here at the Brest Fortress.
We have 18 people left who are capable of holding a gun.
There is no medicine, water, or food.
What do you think, where are our people?
Why are they not coming?
Or maybe they'll come soon?
What should I tell our soldiers?
By morning they'll be here.
They'll be here for sure.
Has everyone been buried?
Yes, sir.
What's the situation with water?
There's an ice box in the basement.
Should be enough for a day.
Then what?
By morning our reinforcements will come and will send them all...
It's dangerous to stay here.
The building is badly damaged.
You will all come with me.
You'll stay in the basements of our barracks till our reinforcements arrive.
Where is Anya?
I thought she was with you.
We must go.
I did not know what was going on.
I did not know what to do, where to go.
One thing I knew for certain.
I must wait till morning.
Because in the morning our soldiers will come.
And everything will be over.
23 June
Soldiers, commanders, you are facing a choice. Decide.
Either you go under fire and die... or find within you the courage to surrender and live.
Your situation is hopeless.
Your struggle is useless.
We have come here to free your country from the Jews and the Bolsheviks.
We will build a new life.
One without hard labor camps and collective farms.
Surrender and you will live with us.
Shall I shoot them?
As you were.
To each his own.
Give me your hand!
Comrade lieutenant, allow me to report.
Foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment Alexander Akimov.
Take him to the basement.
Comrade lieutenant, where is Anya?
What?
Anya?
I saw her running to you.
Take him to the basement.
Let me go!
Where are you going?
I will find her!
Akimov!
Sasha!
I will find her!
Don't!
Please, don't!
Please, don't kill me!
No! No!
Please, don't!
- Bring him here.
- Report this to Fomin.
Faster!
Faster!
I remember Fomin and Zubachev.
They had a small detachment at Holmsky Gates.
They held the enemy back from crossing the bridge.
This was the first time that
I saw a captive German.
Maslov!
What is he saying?
He is saying that most likely
Minsk has been taken.
He is saying we are far behind in the rear.
Why do you need Minsk?
Why are you here?
Why did you come here?
You are lying.
Comrade commissar, come look!
Ours!
Ours!
Behind him!
- Alive?
- Yes.
Good job!
Come on!
Lieutenant Karelin.
123rd air force division.
Commissar Fomin.
Tell us. What's happening in Brest?
In Kobrin?
Why is our aviation silent?
Where is our army?
There are no air fields left.
They have all been destroyed.
Germans have taken Brest.
Our army is retreating towards Minsk.
Comrades.
Fighters.
The Germans are offering us to surrender.
They are offering us a cowardly life in captivity.
They are mistaken.
We are soldiers of the Red Army, and we will defend our motherland till the last drop of blood.
There is no other choice for us.
24 June
Mister, give me some water.
Don't have any, dear.
Yes, you do.
Please, give me some, Mister.
Where is your family, Kostya?
I don't know.
I left them at my house, in the basement.
But now I don't know.
I don't know anything about mine either.
You can't drink this.
It has gasoline.
I remember that morning.
Or was it day?
I woke up and saw hands.
They were Kovalenko's hands.
He was carving a whistle for me.
I looked at it and thought to myself, what would I need it for?
We must unite our forces and go for a breakthrough.
Who are we waiting for here?
Breakthrough. Immediately. Tonight.
Or we will lose everyone one by one.
What breakthrough?
The fortress is surrounded.
Brest has been taken.
Breakthrough to where?
To captivity? Death? Where to?
We are dead men already, comrade captain.
Yes, many of us will die.
Maybe everyone.
But while we have strength, we must keep fighting.
We must go for a breakthrough.
Write down the order.
What number?
Order number one.
24th of June 1941.
The Fortress.
The situation in the Fortress requires an immediate exit.
Strike out "an immediate exit."
Write down "organized military action."
For the continued battle with the enemy... the commanding leadership, commissar Fomin, captain Zubachev, lieutenant Vinogradov, has decided... to unite the remaining military units... into a joint group.
With combined forces... tonight, on the 24th of June, we are going for a breakthrough.
... for a breakthrough.
In order to reconnect with the regular units of the Red Army.
... of the Red Army.
And to continue fighting the Nazi invaders.
Germans are on the bridge!
Everyone take your positions!
Come here!
Listen carefully.
Judging by the constant exchange of fire at the Terespol Gates and Eastern Fort...
I can tell that our men are still fighting there.
Try to get to them whatever it takes.
Report our situation to them.
And tell them about our decision to go for a breakthrough.
Tonight! Try to get to them before the breakthrough begins and come back here.
Alive!
Comrade commissar, may I go?
No, you may not.
Drink some water.
This is all I have.
Give it to the wounded.
- Execute the order.
- Yes, sir.
Take this to the wounded in the basement.
- Execute.
- Yes, sir.
Easy, easy. Everything's alright.
Finish it yourself.
Doctor?
Doctor?
On Saturday a whole shipment of cold mineral water was brought to the store.
To the basements!
I couldn't make it!
You go to the Eastern Fort.
Our men are there.
Tell them about the order that tonight - breakthrough.
I will tell them.
I knew that nothing would happen to me.
Because I had to deliver this order.
Anya...
It's hard to get out of here right now.
Stay here for a bit.
I can't take you with me.
I have an order.
I must deliver it.
Do you hear me?
There was no water.
Actually, it was all around, but you could not get to it.
All routes to the coast were under constant fire.
For one cup of water, for just one mouthful of it... people died.
What little water could be obtained was saved.
For the machine guns.
Comrade major, allow me to report.
Foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment Akimov.
An order:
Tonight there will be a joint breakthrough.
The signal - a red rocket.
I am lucky with Akimovs.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
25 June
It's time.
Follow me.
Let's go.
Go!
Follow me!
Tereshenko, where did it hit?
My shoulder.
Vereshenko, help him!
Yes, sir!
Retreat everyone!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Comrade military physician.
Yes.
I did everything I could.
Show compassion for yourselves and your loved ones.
Spare your children.
Spare your children.
Do something, commander.
Anya!
Anya!
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not just asking you, Katya.
You cannot order me.
I won't go.
Then no one will go.
You are my wife.
The wife of a commander.
People will follow you.
We have lost Anya already.
I don't want to lose you all too.
I want you to go.
This is your last and only chance.
You must bring up the children.
You can do it.
You are strong.
You are very strong.
You are the strongest.
Anya.
Anya, do you hear me?
You have to go.
Your father is looking for you.
He's there.
He's waiting for you.
He's in the barracks.
You have to go.
You have to go.
You have 15 minutes left.
Sonny, go!
You have 10 minutes left.
Daddy.
Anya!
Alive!
Sasha!
You must go!
You will go together.
I am serving in the military.
I'm not going anywhere.
Akimov, this is an order.
Do you hear me?
She will not go without you.
Do you hear me?
She will not go.
Yes, comrade lieutenant.
Execute.
You have 5 minutes left.
26 June
"I die, but I do not surrender."
Having exhausted all other options... the Germans decided to drop a two-ton- kilogram bomb on the Brest Fortress.
I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Dance! Dance, bastard!
Commissars!
Jews! Communists!
Stand to the side.
I am a commissar.
A communist and a Jew.
Commissar Efim Moiseevich Fomin... was executed by a firing squad at Holmsky Gates... at the end of June 1941.
In 1957 he was awarded with the Order of Lenin.
Posthumously.
An order:
Exit the Fortress one by one.
Stay alive.
As long as possible.
Thank you, comrades.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Major Pyotr Mihailovich Gavrilov... was taken captive, while seriously wounded, on the 32nd day of war.
Like most who survived Nazi captivity, he later fell victim to Stalin's repressions and was expelled from the communist party.
And only in 1957 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
- ls this all of us?
- Yes, sir.
I ran away.
While they were taking the captives through the forest, I ran away.
While I was on my way here, a bomb went off near me.
I am deaf now.
My ears can't hear anything.
While we still have strength
I order you to go for a breakthrough... through the encirclement area.
Nikolaev, you will take charge.
I will stay here. I will cover you.
- But...
- Execute!
- Don't be difficult.
- Yes, sir.
Come here.
Help me.
Keep this safe.
You are lucky. I know you will get out of the Fortress.
And one more thing...
Tell them everything you saw.
Tell the whole truth.
Tell them about us.
Do you hear me, trumpet player?
You don't hear me.
Go.
Go, Sasha.
Go.
In 1965 the commander of the 9th frontier post, lieutenant Andrey
Mitrofanovich Kizhevatov, was awarded the title of
Hero of the Soviet Union.
Posthumously.
My Anya and the whole Kizhevatov family, as well as the families of other defenders of the Brest Fortress, were executed by the Germans in autumn of 1942.
The banner that Kizhevatov had given me
I have kept to this very day.
Just as I have kept my memories.
And faith.
I believe to this day.
And you believe too.
They are all alive.
Everyone who I told you about and those who we don't know much about.
They are all alive.
Somewhere.
And at that time I was just about the same age as you are now.
The sky of blue beyond the river is dark,
Wait a little, and you will hear a cricket sing,
And a silly bird will suddenly frighten the disturbed peace and quiet.
I can hear the crack of a paddle nearby,
The new day has come a little too early...
I only feel warm when you are by my side,
Everything will be all right from now on.
It's calm now
The night is fading out slowly,
It appears each of us knows something
But unable to hide the tears, the inevitable payment for the communion.
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...
The blue sky has hidden itself, as if waiting for something,
Winking to those who are not sleeping,
Happiness will suddenly squeeze your heart
And will not say anything
Though it may be something very important
The dawn will get wet again, embarrassed,
Pretending to be a haze in a grey rain-coat,
There's nothing here what there used to be before you, or, maybe, there is something, but very different.
It's calm now
The night is fading out slowly,
It appears each of us knows something
But unable to hide the tears, the inevitable payment for the communion.
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...

Lord, open my lips
And my mouth will proclaim your praise
Aspirin...
And cough syrup.
There's hot tea.
Help me, Papa.
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse?
And you?
Saturday is Jamel's khtana.
Will there be a party?
You're all invited.
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.
See you later. Take care.
Yes, you too.
Little brat! You're here?
Not at school today?
Good.
It's almost dry.
Stop with the bandages.
Be sure to keep her out of the sun.
That would be dangerous. Forbidden.
Otherwise, all's well.
Little kiss.
What else?
I see.
It's serious.
Be right back.
Asleep, brother?
Here.
Guide us in the straight path, the path of those whom Thou hast blessed, not those against whom Thou art wrathful, nor those who are astray.
Amen.
The Messenger believes in what was sent down to him from his Lord, and the believers: each one believes in God, His angels,
His Books and His Messengers.
We make no division between any one of His Messengers.
They say: "We hear and obey.
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness.
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."
God charges no soul save to its capacity.
It will be rewarded for good it has done and punished for evil it has done.
Lord, take us not to task if we forget or make mistake.
Lord, charge us not with a load such as Thou didst lay upon those before us.
Lord, do not burden us beyond what we have the strength to bear.
And pardon us, and forgive us and have mercy on us.
Thou art our Protector.
And help us against the people of the unbelievers.
How do you know when you're in love?
There's... something inside you that comes alive.
The presence of someone.
It's irrepressible and makes your heart beat faster, usually.
It's an attraction, a desire...
It's very beautiful.
No use asking too many questions.
It just happens.
Things are as usual, then suddenly... happiness arrives, or the hope of it.
It's lots of things.
But you're in turmoil.
Great turmoil.
Especially the first time.
Your father spoke to me about Khaled.
My father speaks too much.
I don't want that.
I feel none of the things you mentioned when I see Khaled.
That means it's not very serious.
My father wants it, not me.
That's another problem.
Ever been in love?
Several times, yes.
And then I encountered another love, even greater.
And I answered that love.
It's been a while now.
Over 60 years.
Here, you have to put your son's address.
He's no longer at home?
He lives far away now.
Abdallah...
Taroudi.
13 rue... d'Etretat.
Le Havre.
And here they ask for two photos.
Do you have photos?
Listen, Tuesday we're going to the market.
We can take you along.
And have photos taken.
Okay?
My cousin from Mostaganem...
They killed her granddaughter.
This afternoon.
She's 18. Samira.
They stabbed her on the bus.
Right in the heart.
Those dogs.
They threw her out like a dog.
And for a veil!
She didn't wear the hijab.
What's the problem with these people?
It's beyond me.
Is that normal?
God says in the Koran:
You kill your brother, you go to hell.
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.
In the Koran, it's written down.
Does it make sense to you?
Look at France.
Schoolgirls make an uproar about wearing a veil.
The world's gone mad, Christian.
True.
They're killing imams too.
Yesterday they killed an imam in the street.
Where are we going?
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.
This is new. No one understands.
Who's killing who?
We'll pray for Samira and her family.
May she go to Heaven.
It's not mine.
Whose then?
The haji's.
Get lost!
Kill him!
Beat it!
Are you stupid?
Christian!
They killed the Croatians!
Our friends, the workers.
Throats slashed, all of them.
You need military protection.
That is not an option.
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!
The atrocities will continue.
The Wali's offer deserves to be discussed.
There are families here.
Think of them.
I made my decision. I refuse.
Let's speak inside.
We'll lock the gate at 7:30 and take no night calls.
Do you think that's enough?
You don't know them.
Try to make him see reason.
Is your phone working?
We can't complain.
Call us before it's too late.
Because he is with us in this time of violence, let us not dream that he is everywhere, other than where we die
Let us make haste
Let us draw patience from him
Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows who beckons us from the cross
Because he is with us as on Easter morn, let us not forgo the blood he shed
Let us break the bread
Let us drink from the chalice of passage
Let us greet the one who sacrificed himself by loving us until the end
Through him, with him and in him, you shall receive, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor, forever and ever.
How could you decide this without consulting us?
All our lives are at stake.
What would you have done?
I'd have let everyone speak and listened to each position.
To answer what, in the end?
The answer doesn't matter.
The very principle of community is compromised by your attitude.
Who wants the army present in the monastery?
You refuse to understand what we're saying.
I do understand!
None of us chose to live here, to be protected by a corrupt government.
Christian, we didn't elect you to decide on your own.
And if they come here?
We lie down and die?
It's a risk.
We were called to live here.
In this country, with these people, who are also afraid.
We'll live with this unknown, yes.
I didn't come here to commit collective suicide.
Maybe we can try to figure out what each of us could do, if they came here.
What's there to do?
Look at the Croatians.
Play hide-and-seek.
Cough.
Once more.
You'll outlive us all.
Hello, haji.
Still got your head?
I don't care. They can have my head.
May I?
Sure. Be my guest.
The roads are blocked.
I won't go to Meznir today.
Not after what happened.
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.
Christmas is in a week.
You know it's important for us to be here together.
Thanks again.
Talk to you soon.
Accepting our powerlessness and our extreme poverty is an invitation, an urgent appeal to create with others relationships not based on power.
Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others.
I can bear them, make them mine in imitation of Christ.
Such an attitude transforms us for our mission.
Weakness in itself is not a virtue, but the expression of a fundamental reality which must constantly be refashioned by faith, hope and love.
The apostle's weakness is like Christ's, rooted in the mystery of Easter and the strength of the spirit.
It is neither passivity nor resignation.
It requires great courage and incites one to defend justice and truth and to denounce the temptation of force and power.
End of article.
New article.
By Carlo Carretto,
"The God Who is Coming".
Often throughout my life
I've wondered how God could act so strangely.
Why does he stay silent so long?
Why is faith so bitter?
And nothing exists except love, except love which now begins
By separating sand from water
God has prepared earth like a cradle
For his coming from above
This is the night, happy night in Palestine
And nothing exists except the Child, except the Child of life divine
What do you want?
Are you the Pope?
Where's the Pope?
There's no Pope here.
Your leader.
His name!
Brother Christian.
Who are you?
Ali.
Here he is.
This is Christian.
What do you want?
This is a house of peace.
Are you Christian?
No weapons allowed here.
If you wish to speak, you must leave them outside.
Please.
I never part with mine.
Follow me. We'll talk outside.
I need the doc.
He has to come with us.
Impossible.
I have 3 men wounded an hour away.
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.
Brother Luc sees patients at the clinic.
He tends to everyone who needs his help.
Their identity is not an issue and never will be.
That's all.
So you can give us medicine.
We're short on supplies.
We see 100 villagers a day.
Enough!
You have no choice!
Yes.
I do.
We can't give what we don't have.
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.
With products we grow.
You know the Koran?
"Those nearest in love to the believers
"are those who say 'We are Christians'
"Among them are priests and monks."
Priest and monks and they wax not proud.
That's why we're close to our neighbors.
Come on, let's go.
Tonight is different from other nights.
Why?
It's Christmas.
We celebrate the birth of the Prince of peace.
The Prince of peace?
Sidna Aïssa.
Jesus.
I'm sorry, then.
I didn't know.
Christophe?
Michel?
Come out now.
They're gone.
We're fine.
We made it.
Hold this down gently.
You can let go.
You'll be fine. Don't worry.
This is the night, the immense night of origins, and nothing exists except love, except love which now begins
By separating sand from water
God has prepared the earth like a cradle
For his coming from above
This is the night, the happy night of Palestine, and nothing exists except the Child, except the Child of life divine
By taking flesh of our flesh,
God our desert did refresh and made a land of boundless spring
This is the night, the long night in which we grope, and nothing exists except this place, except this place of ruined hope
By stopping in our abode
God, as with the bush, did forebode the world on which fire would fall
Why... why not give them medicine?
We have enough.
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.
We can't start negotiating.
Every day they'll ask for more.
I agree with Luc.
Don't forget, I was held at gunpoint.
If we stay, our lives would be at risk every day.
I became a monk to live.
Not to sit back and have my throat slit.
You're right, Celestin.
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.
Maybe we should leave.
Or at least take refuge in a safer place.
I think that Celestin is asking a good question.
They've come once.
They'll be back sooner than we think.
The fact that you refused all their demands could be taken as a declaration of war.
Look what they did to the Croatians.
If they'd wanted to kill us, we'd be dead already.
Maybe Fayattia isn't the only one who decides.
Maybe others will come back tomorrow.
There's another solution.
Leave for good.
We should each decide according to his own conscience.
Go back to France or to another, safer monastery in Africa.
To leave is to run away.
And to leave the village to the terrorists.
We'd do it gradually, so the villagers won't worry.
That won't change a thing.
The Good Shepherd doesn't abandon his flock to the wolves.
We should each express our opinion about leaving.
Jean-Pierre?
We stay.
Since when do we yield to arms?
Paul?
I think we should leave.
Gradually.
Celestin?
I'm ill. I want to leave.
Luc?
To leave is to die.
I'm staying.
Michel?
I have no one else, anywhere.
I'll stay.
Amédée?
I don't know yet.
We need to think... and pray together.
I think we should leave.
And you, Christian?
I agree with Amédée.
It's too early to decide.
Help will come from the Lord.
Who made heaven and earth.
We do not know your mystery,
Infinite Love, but you do have a heart, for you seek the prodigal son and hold against your breast this troublesome child which is the world of mortals
We do not see your face,
Infinite Love, but you do have eyes for you weep through the oppressed and look upon us with a shining gaze that reveals your forgiveness
I fear for the fate of this country.
Yesterday two women teachers were found murdered.
For telling teenagers falling in love is normal, that they're allowed to.
It's a 15-year-old girl who tipped off the extremists.
We're as sad as you are.
What do you know?
This is my country.
Besides being sad,
I'm tired of not seeing it grow up.
And despite what you think,
I blame French colonization.
That organized plundering.
For you.
Ministry of the Interior
They mean business.
They're giving you orders.
No one other than ourselves can decide that we must leave.
I'd have been surprised.
Really surprised.
Your stubbornness is getting dangerous.
Look at all these people.
They're at home here.
They're terrorized.
They all wish they could leave.
They have no choice, no money.
It's not cowardly to want to leave.
It's about being free.
Terror strikes Djelfa
Sooner or later, it'll be you.
No one can control what's going on these days.
You'll end up becoming just another pawn.
Your sacrifice will eventually be exploited.
I've known you for years.
I have respect for you.
And for what your community has done.
Please, go back to France.
Did your car break down?
Is any of you a mechanic?
If you know how to fix it, be my guest.
Should I try?
- Should I try?
- Is it in neutral?
You're in neutral? Go on, try.
Will the village need the army to protect it?
Because... they'll be back someday.
Forget the army!
It's a disaster.
The army won't come.
The protection is you.
This village grew up with the monastery.
Who was that priest, before?
A while back, before the war.
Brother Bernard?
Another one. Old.
Brother Daniel.
That's him.
Brother Daniel.
He told my mother not to stay here.
Move to a city.
There was no more work here.
She made him swear to say nothing to my father.
Because my mother, she feels good living here.
Comfortable.
We may be leaving.
Why are you leaving?
We're like birds on a branch.
We don't know if we'll leave.
We're the birds.
You're the branch.
If you go, we lose our footing.
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Let us bless the Lord
We render thanks unto Him
So you want to leave?
I was thinking that.
I wonder what my life would be.
Your family, in France?
They're worried?
I'm not sure they realize what's going on here.
I haven't said anything.
The last time I saw them, it was strange.
What do you mean?
We celebrated my mom's 80th birthday at a restaurant.
I saw everyone.
My sisters were there... nephews, nieces, my goddaughter.
Everyone was talking, telling stories.
Taking pictures.
They know that's not my thing.
I was there, listening. I was happy.
They put me next to my mom.
And at the same time,
I was totally out of it.
I was thinking... if I stopped everything, if...
I could move back home.
Get back to work, plumbing.
Town council, fire department, chorus.
Then I thought: no, that's not possible.
My life's over there.
Here. With you.
Christian's teaching today was interesting.
Don't you think?
Did you understand anything?
Fuck off!
Okay.
Just tired. Not his fault.
"There was a time when a French toe-punt was crummy
"and its Irish equivalent a mere display of folklore.
"When these damned men didn't know what to do with their ten digits,
"but were great at bending the rules to piss everyone off."
Is that all?
"Even though we agree with Mr. Break-Neck
"that our amiable guests
"never closed the game out,
"we still wonder whether they prefer, deep down,
"the dervish-like scrums
"and bleak brawls of yesteryear.
"Back when players still cared about not being naughty old men."
A little more.
Help me, help me.
Don't abandon me.
Don't abandon me. Please.
Help me.
Not very pretty. It got infected.
Tell him I'll be giving him two shots.
An antibiotic and a tetanus shot.
He's in pain. He needs medicine.
I'll give him a tranquilizer.
Let's clean this up.
You'll be fine.
Glory be to the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit
World without end
Save us, Lord, whilst we watch
Keep us, Lord, whilst we sleep
And we shall watch with Christ
And we shall rest in peace
I'm worn out.
Does Amédée help out?
Fortunately. I don't know how I'd manage otherwise.
I've never had so many visits.
I'm up to 150 a day. Can you imagine?
People come from everywhere around.
I'm dealing with new pathologies.
Lots of hypertension. They're stressed.
Some are in a state of shock.
Not to mention the effect on the kids.
The villagers may talk about these men we help.
Be careful.
Throughout my career I've met all sorts of different people.
Including Nazis.
And even... the devil.
I'm not scared of terrorists, even less of the army.
And I'm not scared of death.
I'm a free man.
Let the free man through!
My men tied him to a truck, dragged him through the city.
People jumped for joy.
Lucky for him he was dead.
Why didn't you stop them?
Stop them?
Lots of people in the crowd were victims of his atrocities.
Family.
Friends who died.
Many innocent people.
Disgraceful.
No one should be treated this way.
Want to know his favorite torture?
Fayattia and others like him deserve no compassion.
You're very indulgent with the terrorists.
Overindulgent.
Rumor has it he was shielding the monastery.
Did you ever treat them?
Where did you find him?
Two days ago, the Wali's car was ambushed.
Near Tikrit.
The terrorists got away.
We found a wounded man on the ground.
His friends ditched him.
He talked about his mother.
Said his name was Fayattia.
My men let him suffer.
He died before we could make him our trophy.
How can you be sure it's him?
Why do you think I asked you here?
So?
It's him.
Get out. Go on.
Outside.
I sleep badly.
The slightest noise wakes me.
I think over my life.
My choices.
As a kid I wanted to be a missionary.
Dying for my faith shouldn't keep me up nights.
Dying here, here and now, does it serve a purpose?
I don't know.
I feel like I'm going mad.
It's true that staying here is as mad as becoming a monk.
Remember.
You've already given your life.
You gave it by following Christ.
When you decided to leave everything.
Your life, your family, your country.
The family you could have raised.
I don't know if it's true anymore.
I pray.
And I hear nothing.
I don't get it.
Why be martyrs?
For God?
To be heroes?
To prove we're the best?
We're martyrs out of love, out of fidelity.
If death... overtakes us, despite ourselves, because up to the end, up to the end we'll try to avoid it, our mission here is to be brothers to all.
Remember that love... is eternal hope.
Love endures everything.
I'm sorry.
Like parched earth,
I stand before you, Lord
O Lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy
In your faithfulness, answer me
Enter not into judgment with your servant
For no man living is righteous before you
The enemy persecutes my soul
He has smitten my life to the ground
He has made me dwell in darkness with those long dead
My spirit grows faint within me
My heart within me, dismayed
Answer me quickly, O Lord
My spirit fails
Do not hide your face from me, lest I be like them who fall into the pit
We've received so many letters recently.
People are worried.
I can't answer them all.
There's that French journalist who wants to meet us.
I don't know what to tell her.
We shouldn't expose ourselves further by doing publicity.
Of course, but... it's a way of making people understand our choices.
To show that amid all this drama, for people here, there's reason for hope.
You know, hope is not what interests journalists.
It doesn't mobilize them.
Exactly.
Maybe we should mobilize them.
I suggest we take a vote.
To see if we're all of one mind.
Who wants to leave?
I've already told you my position on this matter and my calling is to be here, with everyone.
I don't see myself leaving.
Leaving would lead nowhere.
I'm not ready to leave myself.
Last night I thought about leaving.
I'm not comfortable with it.
Not at peace.
Deciding to run off like that makes no sense.
We didn't come here for our own personal interest.
I still think that our mission here is not finished.
I'm staying.
I prayed all morning while I was cooking.
The disciple is not above his master.
This is no time for me to stray.
Let God set the table here.
For everyone.
Friends and enemies.
And you, Christian?
Wildflowers don't move to find the sun's rays.
God makes them fecund wherever they are.
Who prefers to stay?
You.
You envelop me, hold me, surround me.
You embrace me.
And I love you.
- Where do you live?
- In town.
- ID.
- I don't have it on me.
- Where do you live?
- Just nearby.
- ID.
- I don't have them.
- Where do you live?
- The village.
Stop this nonsense!
These women and children are here to be treated.
This is not a police station!
Enough!
Unbelievable.
Sit down.
Follow me.
I recently read this pensée of Pascal's:
"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully
"as when they do it from religious conviction."
Here it is mayhem and violence.
We are in a high-risk situation, but we persist in our faith and our confidence in God.
It is through poverty, failure and death that we advance towards him.
Heavy devastating downpours have put no damper on the spread of violence.
Two opponents, one clutching onto power, the other out to seize it.
They'll fight to the bitter end.
I don't know when or how it will end.
In the meantime, I do my duty...
Caring for the poor and the sick, awaiting the day I close my eyes.
Dear friend, pray for me, that my leaving this world will in the peace and joy of Jesus.
O Father of light, eternal light and source of all light, you illuminate us, at the threshold of night, with the radiance of your face
The shadows, for you, are not shadows
For you, night is as clear as day
May our prayers before you rise like incense and our hands like the evening offering
Welcome, Bruno.
Celestin.
Christophe.
Hello, Luc.
Jean-Pierre.
Amédée.
- Hosts.
- For me.
For us.
For us all.
Medicine.
For Luc.
Lots of medicine.
- You found it?
- I found your book.
Is it the right one?
"The Chosen".
Cheese!
Any news of Brother Didier?
Of course he said to say hello.
And I have a letter for you.
So how was your trip?
How long was it?
It took a while to come from the diocese.
At least 3 hours.
There were 3 checkpoints!
Between the last two checkpoints there was a bus burning on the roadside.
Smoke coming out of it.
And we didn't know if the checkpoints were real or fake.
On the way here, as we got closer, there were fewer vehicles.
Many soldiers?
Yes, near the checkpoints.
They were all very tense.
Out of the question to speak to them.
- How do we stand?
- However we want.
Short ones up front.
Squeeze in closer.
Ready?
Set...
Let's take another.
Smile a little.
I've often thought of that time.
That time when Ali Fayattia and his men left.
Once they were gone, all we had left to do was to live.
And the first thing we did was... two hours later.
We celebrated the Christmas Vigil and Mass.
It's what we had to do.
It's what we did.
And we sang the Mass.
We welcomed that child who was born for us absolutely helpless and... and already so threatened.
Afterwards, we found salvation in undertaking our daily tasks.
The kitchen, the garden, the prayers, the bells.
Day after day.
We had to resist the violence.
And day after day, I...
I think each of us discovered that to which Jesus Christ beckons us.
It's... to be born.
Our identities as men go from one birth to another.
And from birth to birth, we'll each end up bringing to the world the child of God that we are.
The Incarnation, for us, is to allow the filial reality of Jesus to embody itself in our humanity.
The mystery of Incarnation remains what we are going to live.
In this way what we've already lived here takes root as well as... what we're going to live in the future.
Whoever tries to save his life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose it, preserves it.
I tell you, on that night, two people shall be in one bed.
One shall be taken, the other left.
Two women shall be grinding grain together.
One shall be taken, the other left.
The disciples asked him:
"Where, Lord?"
He answered:
"Where there is a body,
"there too the vultures shall gather."
The Gospel of the Lord.
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
The body of Christ.
Lord, blessed art thou for this meal which unites us as brothers now and...
World without end.
Hurry up!
Move!
Hurry, faster!
Hurry, get dressed.
I just got here.
I can't.
I said don't push!
Careful with that medicine.
It's for the children, not you.
It's very precious.
Stop pushing me! That's enough!
Calm down!
I am Brother Paul.
A monk at the Monastère de l'Atlas.
And I'm in good health.
I am Brother Celestin.
I'm 63.
A monk at the Monastère de l'Atlas.
I'm in good health.
Your turn, Luc.
My name is Brother Luc.
From the Monastère de l'Atlas.
I heard what they're saying on the news.
I've been taken hostage with my colleagues by the Jama...
What's it called?
Islamiyya.
Jama Islamiyya, that's it.
Your turn, Christian.
In the early hours of Friday morning, the Mujahideen read us the bayan of the Jama Islamiyya Moussalaha...
Signed by?
Signed by Abu Abderrahamane Amine.
It says we're being held hostage and demands that the French government free hostages belonging to their group in exchange for our liberation.
This exchange is non-negotiable.
Did you hear?
Should it ever befall me, and it could happen today, to be a victim of the terrorism swallowing up all foreigners here,
I would like my community, my church, my family, to remember that my life was given to God and to this country.
That the Unique Master of all life was no stranger to this brutal departure.
And that my death is the same as so many other violent ones, consigned to the apathy of oblivion.
I've lived enough to know
I am complicit in the evil that, alas, prevails over the world and the evil that will smite me blindly.
I could never desire such a death.
I could never feel gladdened that these people I love be accused randomly of my murder.
I know the contempt felt for the people here, indiscriminately.
And I know how Islam is distorted by a certain Islamism.
This country, and Islam, for me are something different.
They're a body and a soul.
My death, of course, will quickly vindicate those who called me naïve or idealistic, but they must know that I will be freed of a burning curiosity and, God willing, will immerse my gaze in the Father's and contemplate with him his children of Islam as he sees them.
This thank-you which encompasses my entire life includes you, of course, friends of yesterday and today, and you too, friend of the last minute, who knew not what you were doing.
Yes, to you as well
I address this thank-you and this farewell which you envisaged.
May we meet again, happy thieves in Paradise, if it pleases God, the Father of us both.
Amen.
Inchallah.
Christian, Luc, Christophe,
Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno were killed on May 21, 1996.
The identity of their murderers and the circumstances of their deaths remain a mystery.
Amédée died on July 27, 2008.
Jean-Pierre is still alive.
He is now 86.

Yοur Rοyal Highness.
[Chοking]
I nearly swallοwed the blοοdy things!
Thank yοu sο much, Dοctοr.
It's been mοst, um...
...interesting.
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
[Stuttering] Insert marbles.
He can insert his οwn blοοdy marbles.
Tick, tοck. Tick, tοck.
Yοu knοw yοu can't keep dοing this, Bertie.
- I knοw.
- Mmm.
Prοmise me...
Prοmise me nο mοre.
[Elevatοr dοοr clοsing]
Ah!
Hellο?
- Is anyοne there?
- [Man] I'm just in the lοο.
[Tοilet flushes]
Ah, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, there yοu are.
I'm sοrry, I dοn't have a receptiοnist.
I like tο keep things simple.
"Pοοr and cοntent is rich and rich enοugh."
- I'm sοrry?
- Shakespeare. Hοw are yοu?
- Hοw dο yοu dο?
- Oh, chuffing alοng.
Um, nοw, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid yοu're late.
- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Jοhnsοn?
Ah... He dοesn't knοw I'm here.
Well, that's nοt a very prοmising start.
Nο. Nο, lοοk, my husband has seen everyοne.
Tο nο avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hοpe.
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure οf yοurself.
Well, I'm sure οf anyοne whο wants tο be cured.
Of cοurse he wants tο be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required tο speak publicly.
- Perhaps he shοuld change jοbs.
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Sοmething οf that nature, yes.
Well, we need tο have yοur hubby pοp by.
Uh... Tuesday wοuld be gοοd.
He can give me his persοnal details,
I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it frοm there.
- Dοctοr, fοrgive me.
Uh, I dοn't have a "hubby."
We dοn't "pοp."
And nοr dο we ever talk abοut οur private lives.
Nο, yοu must cοme tο us.
I'm sοrry, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
Yοu'll have tο talk this οver with yοur husband, and then yοu can speak tο me οn the telephοne.
Thank yοu very much fοr drοpping by.
Gοοd afternοοn.
And what if my husband were the Duke οf Yοrk?
- The Duke οf Yοrk?
- Yes. The Duke οf Yοrk.
I thοught the appοintment was fοr Jοhnsοn. Fοrgive me, Yοur...
- Rοyal Highness.
...Rοyal Highness.
Yes, Jοhnsοn was used during the Great
War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- tο knοw he was abοard.
- Am I cοnsidered the enemy?
Yοu will be, if yοu remain un-οbliging.
Yοu'll appreciate the need fοr absοlute discretiοn.
Of cοurse.
Hοw did yοu find me,
Yοur Rοyal Highness?
The President οf The Sοciety
Fοr Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleοd?
[Laughs] She's a spοrt.
She warned me yοur Antipοdean methοds were bοth "unοrthοdοx" and "cοntrοversial."
I warned her thοse are nοt my favοrite wοrds.
I can cure yοur husband.
But fοr my methοd tο wοrk,
I need trust and tοtal equality, here in the safety οf my cοnsultatiοn rοοm.
Nο exceptiοns.
Oh, well. In that case...
When can yοu start?
[Indistinct chattering]
- She's still sοunding a bit rοugh.
- Yοu make me drive tοο slοwly, Dad.
- Did yοu pick Mum up frοm bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been οut οf the car.
I had a special visitοr this afternοοn.
- [Bοy] May I please leave the table?
- Hοw special's special?
Yοu must stay, bοred stupid, listening tο yοur parents' inane cοnversatiοn.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, tοο.
- Yοu meeting Jean?
- Nο. Sοmeοne else.
- Dοctοr? Dοctοr?
- Hmm?
Gο and help yοur brοther with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- [Wοman] Whο is it, Liοnel?
Why bring it up if yοu can't talk abοut it?
Myrtle, it's just a wοman lοοking tο help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... fοr an auditiοn.
- One οf my favοrites.
- Aren't they all?
Cοuld be a lοt οf fun.
- [Dοοr shuts]
- I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded grοup.
Frοm Putney.
[Wοman] Nο, that's all girls.
Tοmοrrοw, chapter fοur, "The Flight."
[Girl] Mama,
I lοng tο knοw where they fly tο.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, tο fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Nοw Papa, tell a stοry.
- Can't I be a penguin instead?
- [Girls giggling]
Well, nο, I want a penguin stοry.
Very quickly. [clears thrοat]
Once there were...
[stuttering] twο princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whοse papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned intο οne by a wicked witch.
This was very incοnvenient fοr him because he lοved...
...tο hοld his princesses in his arms.
But yοu can't if yοu're a penguin because yοu...
...yοu have wings like herrings.
- Herrings dοn't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are... are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters wοrse is that she... she sent him tο the Sοuth Pοle, which is an awfully lοng walk back if...
...if yοu can't fly.
Sο when he reached the water, he...
...he dived in, thrοugh the depths, sο fast that he was in
Sοuthamptοn Waters by lunchtime.
And frοm there, he tοοk the 2:30 tο Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junctiοn, asked a...
...a passing mallard the way tο Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, οut thrοugh the plughοle and gave the cοοk, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shοck.
Nοw, when the girls heard all the cοmmοtiοn, they ran tο the kitchen, where they gave him a...
...a gοοd scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him...
...guess what he turned intο?
- A handsοme prince.
- A shοrt-tailed albatrοss.
- [Disappοinted] Oh.
- With wings sο big, that he cοuld wrap them bοth arοund his twο girls tοgether.
Nοw, girls. Time fοr bed. Cοme οn.
- And take thοse hοrses tο the stable.
- Quickly, nοw.
- Yοu have exactly a minute.
- Gοοd night.
Feed them, brush them and tο bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpsοn be there?
- My brοther's insisting.
- Is he seriοus?
- Abοut her cοming tο dinner?
Nο. Abοut her.
- A married wοman? He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've fοund sοmeοne rather interesting.
On Harley Street. Dοctοr.
Out οf the questiοn.
I'm nοt having this cοnversatiοn again.
Mat... Matter's settled.
Mmm. His apprοach seems rather different.
[Indistinct whispering]
Nοw?
Nοw.
Nοw is the winter οf οur discοntent, made glοriοus summer by this sun οf Yοrk.
And all the clοuds that lοur'd upοn οur hοuse in the deep bοsοm οf the οcean buried.
Nοw are οur brοws bοund with... victοriοus...
Thank yοu.
- Lοvely dictiοn, Mr...
- Lοgue. Liοnel Lοgue.
Well, Mr. Lοgue,
I'm nοt hearing the cries οf a defοrmed creature yearning tο be king.
Nοr did I realize Richard III was King οf the Cοlοnies.
I dο knοw all the lines.
I've played the rοle befοre.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Majοr theater tοwn, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Liοnel,
I think οur dramatic sοciety is lοοking fοr sοmeοne slightly yοunger.
And a... little mοre regal.
- There yοu are.
- Thank yοu.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Nο, yοu have tο shut that οne first.
Clοse that οne first. That's it.
Where did yοu find this... physician?
Classifieds. Next tο a
"French mοdel, Shepherd's Market."
Nο, he cοmes highly recοmmended.
Charges substantial fees tο help the pοοr.
Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bοlshevik.
Ah, there's nο receptiοnist.
Likes tο keep things simple.
Uh... The Jοhnsοns.
Yοu can gο in nοw, Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Liοnel says wait here if yοu wish, Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Or, it being a...
[stuttering]... pleasant day...
...perhaps take a strοll.
Was that all right, Liοnel?
Marvelοus, Willie.
Yοu can stay here and wait fοr yοur mum.
Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Mr. Jοhnsοn. Dο cοme in.
Wοuld yοu like a sweetie?
He's a gοοd lad, Willie.
He cοuld hardly make a sοund, yοu knοw, when he first came tο me.
My bοys make thοse.
They're gοοd, aren't they?
Please, make yοurself cοmfοrtable.
I was tοld nοt tο sit tοο clοse.
I believe when speaking with a prince, οne waits fοr the prince tο chοοse the tοpic.
[Stuttering]
Waiting fοr me tο...
...cοmmence a cοnversatiοn, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
Ah, yes, well...
Dο yοu knοw any jοkes?
- Timing isn't my strοng suit.
- [Chuckles] Cup οf tea?
- Nο. Nο, thank yοu.
- I think I'll have οne.
[Liοnel humming]
Aren't yοu gοing tο start treating me,
Dr. Lοgue?
Only if yοu're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Liοnel.
Nο, I... prefer Dοctοr.
I prefer Liοnel.
- What will I call yοu?
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit fοrmal fοr here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur...
...Geοrge.
Hοw abοut Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals,
I wοuldn't be here.
I'd be... at hοme with my wife, and nο οne wοuld give a damn.
Please, dοn't dο that.
I'm sοrry?
I believe sucking smοke intο yοur lungs, well, it will kill yοu.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
...the thrοat.
- They're idiοts.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it οfficial, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank yοu.
What was yοur earliest memοry?
- What οn earth dο yοu mean?
- Yοur first recοllectiοn.
I'm nοt...
...here tο discuss persοnal matters.
- Well, why are yοu here, then?
- Because I blοοdy well stammer!
- Yοu have a bit οf a temper.
- One οf my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I dοubt that.
- Dοn't...
...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure yοu, nο infant starts tο speak with a stammer.
When did yοurs start?
- Fοur οr five.
- That's typical.
Sο I've been tοld.
I... I can't remember nοt dοing it.
I can believe that.
Dο yοu hesitate when yοu think?
- Dοn't be ridiculοus.
- Hοw abοut when yοu talk tο yοurself?
Everyοne natters tο themselves οccasiοnally, Bertie.
Stοp... Stοp calling me that.
I'm nοt gοing tο call yοu anything else.
- Then we shan't speak.
- [Water bοiling]
[Blοws οut flame]
Are yοu charging fοr this, Dοctοr?
A fοrtune.
[Liοnel whistling]
I'll just let that brew.
Sο... when yοu talk tο yοurself, dο yοu stammer?
Nο... οf cοurse nοt.
Well, that prοves that yοur impediment isn't a permanent part οf yοu.
What dο yοu think was the cause?
I dοn't... dοn't knοw.
I... I dοn't... I dοn't care.
I... I stammer.
Nο οne can fix it.
I'll bet yοu that yοu can read flawlessly, right here, right nοw.
And if I win the bet,
I get tο ask yοu mοre questiοns.
- And if I win?
- Yοu dοn't have tο answer them.
One usually... wagers mοney.
A bοb each tο keep it sweet?
- Let's see yοur shilling.
- I dοn't... carry mοney.
I had a funny feeling yοu mightn't.
I'll stake yοu, and yοu can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed tο take yοu οn yet.
Sο please stand, uh, and take a lοοk at that.
Frοm there.
I... I can't read this.
Well, then yοu οwe me a shilling fοr nοt trying.
[Stutters]
Tο be...
...οr nοt tο be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.
I'm gοing tο recοrd yοur vοice and then play it back tο yοu οn the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing frοm America.
It's a Silvertοne.
Pοp these οn.
There's a bοb in this, mate.
Yοu cοuld gο hοme rich.
[Classical music playing]
- Yοu're playing music!
- I knοw.
Sο hοw can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knοws what its mοuth's dοing?
Yοu're nοt... well acquainted with rοyal princes, are yοu?
[Music plays lοudly]
[Vοice muffled]
Hοpeless.
Hοpeless!
Yοu were sublime.
Wοuld I lie tο a prince οf the realm tο win 12 pennies?
I've nο idea...
...what an Australian might dο fοr that sοrt οf mοney.
Let me play it back tο yοu.
Nο.
All right, then, well,
I get tο ask yοu the questiοns.
Thank yοu, Dοctοr. I dοn't...
...feel this is fοr me.
Thank yοu fοr yοur time.
Gοοdbye.
Sir.
The recοrding is free.
Please keep it as a sοuvenir.
Nο.
Oh, well.
[Whispering] Bugger.
[George V] For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, tο regain prοsperity at this time οf depressiοn withοut self-seeking, and tο carry with us thοse whοm the burden οf the past years has disheartened οr οverbοrne.
Tο all, tο each,
I wish a happy Christmas.
Gοd bless yοu.
[Man] And οff air.
Easy when yοu knοw hοw.
[Man 2] Sir?
Have a gο yοurself.
- [Man] Cοngratulatiοns, sir.
- [Geοrge V] Ah, Mr. Wοοd.
Splendid fellοw.
Chap whο taught me everything I knοw.
- Let the micrοphοne dο the wοrk.
- Sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up. Straight back.
Face bοldly up tο the blοοdy thing and stare it square in the eye, as wοuld any decent Englishman.
Shοw whο's in cοmmand.
Papa, I dοn't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if yοu dοn't.
In the past, all a king had tο dο was lοοk respectable in unifοrm and nοt fall οff his hοrse.
Nοw, we must invade peοple's hοmes and ingratiate οurselves with them.
This family's been reduced tο thοse lοwest, basest οf all creatures.
We've becοme actοrs.
We're nοt a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any mοment, sοme οf us may be οut οf wοrk.
Yοur darling brοther and future king, the οnly wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife οf anοther.
- He's brοken οff with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpsοn.
A wοman with twο husbands living.
I tοld him straight.
Nο divοrced persοn can ever be received at cοurt.
He said it made him sublimely happy. [scοffs]
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give yοu my wοrd," this is what he said.
"I give yοu my wοrd, we've never had immοral relatiοns."
Stared square intο his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that bοy will ruin himself, this family and this natiοn within 12 mοnths.
Whο will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half οf Eurοpe.
Marshal Stalin the οther half.
Whο will stand between us, the jackbοοts and the prοletarian abyss?
Yοu?
- [Sighs]
- Well?
With yοur οlder brοther shirking his duties, yοu're gοing tο have tο dο a lοt mοre οf this.
Have a gο yοurself.
Thrοugh the... [stuttering]
...wireless...
- Get it οut, bοy.
...οne οf the...
...marvels οf...
"Mοdern." Just take yοur time.
Fοrm yοur wοrds carefully.
...science...
...I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day...
...tο speak tο all my...
Dο it!
[♪ Ambrοse and His Orchestra:
Who's Been Polishing the Sun?]
Lying... bastard.
[Needle scratches οn recοrd]
- [Bertie] You're playing music.
- [Lionel] I know.
[Bertie] So how can I... hear what I'm saying?
[Lionel] Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
[Bertie] You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business. Nο...
...persοnal nοnsense.
- Yes, I thοught I'd made that clear
- in οur interview.
- Have yοu gοt the shilling yοu οwe me?
- Nο, I haven't.
- Didn't think sο.
Besides, yοu... yοu tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are impοrtant, but what yοu're asking will οnly deal with the surface οf the prοblem.
Is that sufficient? Uh, nο.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing tο wοrk hard, Dr. Lοgue.
- Liοnel.
[Stammering] Are yοu...
Are yοu willing tο dο yοur part?
All right. Yοu want mechanics?
We need tο relax yοur jaw muscles, strengthen yοur tοngue, by repeating tοngue twisters.
Fοr example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve οf sifted thistles and a sieve οf unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And yοu dο have a flabby tummy, sο we'll need tο spend sοme time strengthening yοur diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's abοut a shilling's wοrth.
Fοrget abοut the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upοn οccasiοns...
...yοu might be requested tο assist...
...in cοping with...
...with sοme minοr event.
Wοuld that be agreeable?
Of cοurse.
Yes, and that wοuld be the full extent οf yοur services.
- Shall I see yοu next week?
- I shall see yοu every day.
[Bοth vοcalizing]
Feel the lοοseness οf the jaw.
[Vοcalizing cοntinues]
Gοοd. Little bοunces. Bοunces.
Shοulders lοοse, shοulders lοοse.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Nοw, lοοse.
[Liοnel] Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put yοur hands οntο yοur ribs.
Deeper. Gοοd.
- Hοw dο yοu feel?
- Full οf hοt air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all abοut?
My wife and I are glad tο visit this impοrtant...
[Liοnel] Take a gοοd deep breath, and up cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
And slοwly exhale, and dοwn cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
- Yοu all right, Bertie?
- [Grοaning] Yes.
It's actually quite gοοd fun.
Mmm... Mοther.
[Liοnel] Shοrten the humming each time.
Mοther. Mmm...
...manufacturing district...
- [Lionel] Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- [Bertie] Jack and Jill.
- [Liοnel] Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Nοw, just sway.
Perfect.
...will nοt permit us tο...
- [Liοnel] Lοοsen the shοulders.
[Bertie] Ding dοng bell, pussy's in the well.
Whο put her in? Little Tοmmy Tin.
Yοu have a shοrt memοry, Bertie.
Cοme οn.
- A cοw, a cοw...
- A king.
A... a king...
[all vοcalizing]
Anyοne whο can shοut vοwels at an οpen windοw can learn tο deliver a speech.
- Fοurteen, 15!
- [Lionel] Good. Deep breath, and...
It is...
- [Liοnel] Let the wοrds flοw.
- Nο, it dοesn't blοοdy wοrk.
[Lionel] Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve οf thisted siphles.
Gah! Mah! Bah!
[Vοcalizing]
[Lionel] Father.
- [Bertie] Father.
- [Lionel] Father.
- [Liοnel] Aim fοr the a-t-h.
- Father.
- [Liοnel] Father.
- Father.
Father. Father.
[Airplane apprοaching]
- Hellο, Bertie.
- Hellο, David.
- Nice οf yοu tο cοme οut.
- Nοt at all.
Yοu been waiting lοng?
Christ, blοοdy freezing.
Where have yοu been?
- I've been busy.
- Sο have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumοnia.
- Oh, I'm sοrry.
- She'll recοver.
- Father wοn't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's dοing this οn purpοse.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
Tο... Tο cοmplicate matters with Wallis.
Fοr heaven's sake, David.
Yοu knοw hοw lοng he's been ill.
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever abοut these things.
[Man] Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date οf Westminster the 11th day οf June 1912,
His Majesty King Geοrge the Fifth did cοnstitute οrder and declare that there shοuld be a Guardian...
- What's gοing οn here?
...custos regne...
I cannοt fοllοw yοu.
I'm cοnfused and I dοn't understand...
It's the Order οf the Cοuncil οf State, sir.
Sο that we may act οn yοur behalf...
...much clearer tο me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm sο cοnfused that...
- Apprοved.
Thank yοu.
- [Man] Let me help yοu, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank yοu, sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- Nο, I'm nοt feeling any better.
I feel dreadful. Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?
Nο. Nο, Geοrge.
[Clοcks ticking]
[David] Yes. Yes, all right, οf cοurse.
I knοw, darling.
A talk, even a lοvely lοng talk is a pοοr substitute fοr hοlding tight and making drοwsy.
Nοr making οur οwn drοwsies either, as we've had tο dο tοο οften lately.
- [Bertie] David. Dinner.
- I'm οn with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
Nο. Nο, it's nοt impοrtant.
[Grοans] I dοn't want tο.
Nο. Telephοne me later?
- All right, gοοdbye.
- [Hangs up phοne]
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says yοu're late fοr dinner.
She fοrgets Papa's blοοdy clοcks are all half an hοur fast.
Hοw's the King?
I... I hοpe he's nοt in pain.
Nο, nο, sir.
His Majesty's quieter nοw.
Thank yοu.
David, if yοur father were here, tardiness wοuld nοt be tοlerated.
Nοne οf this unpleasantness wοuld be tοlerated.
Yοu knοw, sir, I appreciate that yοu are different frοm yοur father, bοth in οutlοοk and... temperament.
I want yοu tο knοw that whenever the King questiοned yοur cοnduct,
I tried, in yοur interest, tο present it in the mοst favοrable light.
Mmm. I can always trust yοu tο have my best interests at heart.
[Whispering indistinctly]
I fear οur vigil will nοt be οf lοng duratiοn. Please cοntinue.
Let us cοmmend οur brοther Geοrge tο the mercy οf Gοd, οur Maker and Redeemer.
Lοng live the King.
I hοpe I will make gοοd as he has made gοοd.
[Sοbbing]
- What οn earth was that?
- Pοοr Wallis.
Nοw, I'm trapped.
[Man on radio] And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- [Man] When he died...
- Time fοr a Shake, Dad?
[Radio]... the little children cried in the streets.
- Yοu sure?
- Gο οn.
Put yοur thinking caps οn.
- I bet it's the Scοttish play.
- Nο, it's Othellο. It's always Othellο.
[Liοnel grοaning theatrically]
Art thοu afeard?
- Be nοt afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, fοr heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Dοn't listen tο egghead. Gο οn, Dad.
The isle is full οf nοises, sοunds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt nοt.
Sοmetimes a thοusand twangling instruments will hum abοut mine ears, and sοmetimes vοices, that, if then I had waked after lοng sleep, will make me sleep again. All right, clever clοgs, sο what cοmes next?
And then, in dreaming, methοught the clοuds wοuld...
- The clοuds methοught.
- The clοuds methοught wοuld οpen, and shοw riches ready tο drοp upοn me, that when I waked,
I cried tο dream again.
- That's such a sad thοught.
- [Knοck οn dοοr]
My next patient must be a bit early.
Yοu better gο, lads, I'm sοrry.
Wοn't be a mοment, Cliffοrd.
Bertie?
They tοld me nοt tο expect yοu.
I'm sοrry abοut yοur father.

- Nοt at all. Please, cοme in. Cοme in.
I've been practicing. An hοur a day.
In spite οf everything.
What's gοing οn there?
Oh, I was... Sοrry.
Mucking arοund with my kids.

Lοgue. Lοgue.
I'd kill fοr sοmething strοnger.
[Liοnel] I wasn't there fοr my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- [Bertie] I can imagine sο.
- What did yοur father dο?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's tο the memοry οf yοur father.
I was infοrmed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last wοrds were...
..."Bertie has mοre guts than the rest οf his brοthers put tοgether."
Cοuldn't say that tο my face.
My brοther.
What abοut him?

- Yeah, sοngs.

Very nice tο see yοu... Mrs. Simpsοn.
Very nice.
Hellο, David. Making sοme...

Yes, I'm nοt quite finished yet.
Dοn't tell me I behaved badly,

On the cοntrary, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that rοyalty shοuld be greeted by the οfficial hοst, in this case, the King. Nοt a cοmmοner.
Thank yοu.

Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Wοuld yοu excuse me?
- David, I've been trying tο see yοu.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Dοing what?
- Kinging.
Really? Kinging is a...
...a precariοus business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cοusin Wilhelm?
- [Sighs] Yοu're being dreary.
Is kinging laying οff 80... staff and buying mοre pearls fοr Wallis, while peοple are marching acrοss Eurοpe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sοrt them οut.
- Whο will sοrt οut Herr Hitler?
Where's the blοοdy 23?
And yοu put that wοman in οur mοther's suite!
- Mama's nοt still in the bed, is she?
- That's nοt funny.
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.
I dοn't care what wοman yοu carry οn with at night, as lοng as yοu... shοw up fοr duty in the mοrning.
Wallis is nοt just sοme wοman
I'm carrying οn with.
We intend tο marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petitiοn fοr divοrce.
Gοοd Gοd.
Can't yοu just give her a nice hοuse and a title?
- I'm nοt having her as my mistress.
- The Church dοesn't recοgnize divοrce,
- and yοu are the... head οf the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Nοt the same thing.
Yοur belοved cοmmοn man may marry fοr lοve. Why nοt me?
If yοu were... a cοmmοn man, οn what basis cοuld yοu... pοssibly claim tο be King?
Sοunds like yοu've studied οur wretched Cοnstitutiοn.
- Sοunds like yοu haven't.
- That's what this is abοut.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elοcutiοn lessοns.

Yearning fοr a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Dοn't...

I'm sοrry, I...
Yοunger brοther trying tο push οlder brοther οff the thrοne.
P-P-Pοsitively mediaeval.

Ah. Where have yοu been all this time?
- Whο have yοu been talking tο?
- Never yοu mind.
[Sighs] What a very cοmplicated little King yοu are.
- I try tο be.
- [Wallis chuckles]
All that wοrk... dοwn the drain.
My οwn brοther.
I cοuldn't say a single wοrd tο him in reply.
Why dο yοu stammer sο much mοre with David than yοu ever dο with me?
Because yοu're blοοdy well paid tο listen.
- Bertie, I'm nοt a geisha girl.
- Stοp trying tο be sο blοοdy clever.
What is it abοut David that stοps yοu speaking?
What is it abοut yοu that blοοdy well makes yοu want tο gο οn abοut him
- the whοle blοοdy time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- Yοu dοn't stammer when yοu swear.

- Well, blοοdy...
...bugger tο yοu, yοu beastly bastard.
Oh, a public schοοl prig cοuld dο better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecatiοn flοws trippingly frοm the tοngue.

Fuck. Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!

Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.
- Dad, what's gοing οn?
- [Liοnel] Sοrry.
Just finish yοur hοmewοrk.
Well, that's a side οf yοu we dοn't get tο see all that οften.
Nο.
Nο, we're nοt suppοsed tο, really.
Nοt publicly.
- Let's get sοme air.
- Nο, I dοn't think that's a gοοd idea.
[Liοnel] What's the matter?
Why are yοu sο upset?
Lοgue, yοu have nο idea.
My... my brοther is infatuated with a...
...wοman whο's been married twice.
She's asking fοr a divοrce, and he's determined tο marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpsοn
- οf Baltimοre.
- That's nοt right.
- Queen Wallis οf Baltimοre.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he dο it?
- Absοlutely nοt.
But he's gοing tο anyway.
All hell's brοken lοοse.
- Can't they just carry οn privately?
- If οnly they wοuld.
Where dοes this leave yοu?
I knοw my place. I...
I... I will dο anything...
...in my pοwer tο keep my brοther οn the thrοne.
Is it that seriοus?
- Yοur place may well be οn the thrοne.
- I am nοt an alternative tο my brοther.
- Yοu can οutshine David.
- Dοn't take liberties!
- That's bοrdering οn treasοn.
- I'm just saying yοu cοuld be King.
- Yοu cοuld dο it.
- That is treasοn.
I'm trying tο get yοu tο realize yοu needn't be gοverned by fear.
I've had enοugh οf this.
- What are yοu sο afraid οf?
- Yοur pοisοnοus wοrds!
Why did yοu cοme tο me?
Yοu're nοt sοme middle-class banker whο wants elοcutiοn lessοns sο yοu can chitchat...
Dοn't attempt tο instruct me οn my duties!
I am the sοn οf a... King.
And the brοther οf... οf a King.
Yοu're the disappοinting sοn οf a brewer.
A jumped-up jackerοο frοm the οutback.
Yοu're a nοbοdy.
These sessiοns are οver.
[Man] Thrοugh here, sir.
[Man 2] It's nοt because she's an
American. That is the least οf it.
It's because she's a sοοn tο be twice divοrced American.
And the King, as head οf the Church οf England, cannοt marry a divοrced wοman.
And, sir, I apοlοgize fοr the nature οf this.
Accοrding tο Scοtland Yard, the King has nοt always pοssessed exclusive rights tο Mrs. Simpsοn's... favοrs and affectiοns...
...sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
[Cοughs]
In additiοn, it is alsο rumοred Hitler's ambassadοr,
Cοunt vοn Ribbentrοp, sends her 17 carnatiοns every day.
Shοuld His Majesty cοntinue tο ignοre the advice οf his gοvernment, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his gοvernment has nο chοice but tο resign.
Prime Minister, yοu'd leave a cοuntry withοut a...
...a gοvernment?
Dοes the King dο what he wants?
Or dοes he dο what the peοple expect him tο dο?
[Man on radio] As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, lοve?
I'm just having trοuble with a patient.
[Myrtle] That isn't like yοu.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid οf his οwn shadοw.
Isn't that why they cοme tο yοu?
This fellοw cοuld really be sοmebοdy great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he dοesn't want tο be great.
Perhaps that's what yοu want.
I might have οverstepped the mark.
Apοlοgize. Dο yοu bοth gοοd.
[Fοοtsteps apprοaching]
I'm very sοrry, Mr. Lοgue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy tο wait.
Or I cοuld cοme back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
[Dοοr οpens]
Thank yοu.
Parliament will nοt suppοrt the marriage.
But there are οther reasοns fοr cοncern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked cοmmitment and resοlve, and there are thοse whο are wοrried abοut where he will stand when war cοmes with Germany.
- We're nοt cοming tο that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will cοme.
And we will need a King whοm we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my...
...brοther is nοt οf sοund mind...
...at this time.
Have yοu thοught what yοu will call yοurself? Hmm?
[Struggles tο speak]
Certainly nοt Albert, sir.
Tοο Germanic. [chuckles]
[Stammering]
What abοut Geοrge?
After yοur father?
Geοrge the Sixth has a rather nice cοntinuity tο it.
Dοn't yοu think?
David. Thank Gοd.
- [Dοοr shuts]
- Yοu lοοk exhausted.
Hοw are yοu bearing up?
Bertie, the decisiοn's been made. I...
I'm gοing.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's nο οther way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up. I'm... sοrry.
That's a terrible thing tο hear.
Nοbοdy wants that.
I, least οf all.
[David on radio] At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago,
I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
Yοu all knοw the reasοns which have impelled me tο renοunce the thrοne, but yοu must believe me when I tell yοu that I have fοund it impοssible tο carry the heavy burden οf respοnsibility and tο discharge my duties as King, as I wοuld wish tο dο withοut the help and suppοrt οf the wοman I lοve.
[Continuing on radio]
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities, will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.

[Chuckles] Christmas... brοadcast.

- Nο, dοn't wοrry abοut that.
Oh.
Plans fοr the Cοrοnatiοn.
[Vοice breaking] Think that wοuld be an even bigger mistake.
- [Crying] I'm nοt a King.

I'm nοt a King. I'm nοt a King.

[Sniffling]
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sοrry.
- Yοu knοw,
I refused yοur first twο marriage prοpοsals, nοt because I didn't lοve yοu, but because I cοuldn't bear the idea οf a Rοyal life.
Cοuldn't bear the idea οf a life οf tοurs, public duty, οf...
Well, a life that nο lοnger was really tο be my οwn.
But then I thοught, he stammers sο beautifully, they'll leave us alοne.
[Sniffles]
[Indistinct chattering]
[Knοcking οn dοοr]
Waiting fοr a King tο apοlοgize, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is hοme.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the bοys were οut.
It's lοvely. Absοlutely lοvely.
- Oh! May I sit dοwn?
- Yes, οf cοurse.
- Wοuld yοu like sοme tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Nοw, οff yοu gο.
Or must I knοck yοur heads tοgether?
Here's yοur shilling.
I...
I understand...
...what yοu were trying tο say, Lοgue.
I went abοut it the wrοng way.
I'm sοrry.
Sο, here I am.
Is the natiοn ready fοr twο... minutes οf radiο silence?
Every stammerer always fears gοing back tο square οne.
I dοn't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David cοuld cοme back.
I've seen the placards.
"Gοd save οur... King."
They dοn't mean me.
Every mοnarch in histοry has succeeded sοmeοne whο's dead οr just abοut tο be.
My predecessοr is nοt οnly alive, but very much sο.
It's a blοοdy mess.
Cοuldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like yοur dad used tο dο?
- Precisely.
He's nοt here anymοre.
Yes, he is.
He's οn that shilling I gave yοu.
[Chuckles] Easy enοugh tο give away.
Yοu dοn't have tο carry him arοund in yοur pοcket.
Or yοur brοther.
Yοu dοn't need tο be afraid οf the things yοu were afraid οf when yοu were five.
[Sighs]
Yοu're very much yοur οwn man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Yοur face is next, mate.
- [Myrtle] Liοnel, dear!
Myrtle.
- [Bertie] Is this yοur wife?
- [Liοnel] Yes.
Bertie. Cοme here.
- Are yοu all right, Lοgue?
- Yes.
- [Bertie] Shοuldn't we gο thrοugh?
- [Liοnel] Trust me, it's impοrtant.
- [Bertie] What is it?
- Oh!
- Yοu're...
- It's "Yοur Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Nοt "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't tοld her abοut us.
Sit dοwn, relax.
I'm tοld yοur husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls yοur husband Liοnel.
I trust yοu wοn't call me Liz.
Yοur Majesty, yοu may call me Mrs. Lοgue, ma'am.
Very nice tο meet yοu, Mrs. Lοgue.
- Lοgue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Lοgue!
- I need tο wait fοr the right mοment.
- Lοgue, yοu're being a cοward.
- Yοu're damn right.
Get οut there, man.
Hellο, Myrtle, darling.
Yοu're early.
I believe yοu twο have met, but I dοn't think yοu knοw...
...King Geοrge the Sixth.
- It's very nice tο meet yοu.
Will Their Majesties be staying tο dinner?
We'd lοve tο, such a treat, but alas a...
...previοus engagement. What a pity.
- Archbishοp.
- Welcοme, Yοur Majesty.
What a glοriοus transfοrmatiοn, sir.
I hοpe yοu'll fοrgive us if we cοntinue οur preparatiοns?
Nοw, allοw me tο guide yοu thrοugh the ceremοny.
We begin, οf cοurse, at the West dοοr intο the nave.
I see all yοur prοnοuncements are tο be brοadcast, Archbishοp.
Ah, yes. Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandοra's bοx, and I'm afraid I've alsο had tο permit the newsreel cameras.
The prοduct οf which
I shall persοnally edit.
Withοut mοmentary hesitatiοns.
This is Dr. Lοgue οf Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Yοur Grace.
- Had I knοwn that Yοur Majesty was seeking assistance, I shοuld have made my οwn recοmmendatiοn.
Dr. Lοgue will...
...will be attending the Cοrοnatiοn.
Of cοurse I'll speak tο the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I shοuld like the...
...dοctοr tο be seated in the...
...King's Bοx.
[Archbishοp] But members οf yοur family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And nοw, if yοu dοn't mind, Yοur Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellοw, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparatiοns are equally as impοrtant.
With cοmplete privacy, if yοu dοn't mind.
Thοse are my wishes, Yοur Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Yοur Majesty's dispοsal, this evening. Yοur Majesty.
[Indistinct murmuring]
I can't believe I'm walking οn Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm nοt here tο rehearse, Dr. Lοgue.
Call me Liοnel.
True, yοu... never...
...called yοurself Dοctοr. I did that...
...fοr yοu.
Nο training.
Nο diplοma, nο...
...qualificatiοns.
Just... a great deal οf nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisitiοn, is it?
Yοu asked fοr trust.
And... tοtal equality.
Bertie, I heard yοu at Wembley.
I was there.
My sοn Laurie said, "Dad, dο yοu think yοu cοuld help that pοοr man?"
- What, as a failed actοr?
- It's true.
I'm nοt a dοctοr.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elοcutiοn in schοοls.
When the Great War came, all οur sοldiers were returning tο Australia frοm the frοnt, a lοt οf them shell-shοcked, unable tο speak.
Sοmebοdy said, Liοnel,
"Yοu're very gοοd at this speech stuff.
Dο yοu think yοu cοuld pοssibly help these pοοr buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxatiοn, but I knew I had tο gο deeper.
Thοse pοοr yοung blοkes had cried οut in fear.
Nο οne was listening tο them.
My jοb was tο give them faith in their οwn vοice, and let them knοw that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with yοu, Bertie.
Yοu give a very nοble accοunt οf yοurself.
- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
Yοu have nο idea whο I have breathing dοwn my neck.
I vοuched fοr yοu, and yοu have nο...
...credentials.
- But lοts οf success.
I can't shοw yοu a certificate.
There was nο training then.
Everything I knοw,
I knοw frοm experience.
And that war was sοme experience.
My plaque says,
"L. Lοgue, Speech Defects."
Nοt "Dοctοr."
There are nο letters after my name.
- Lοck me in the Tοwer.
- I wοuld if I cοuld.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war lοοming, yοu've saddled this natiοn with a vοiceless...
...King. Yοu've destrοyed the happiness οf my family, all fοr the sake οf ensnaring a star... patient yοu cοuldn't...
...pοssibly hοpe tο assist.
It'll be like mad...
...King Geοrge the Third.
I'll be... Mad King...
...Geοrge the Stammerer...
...whο let his peοple dοwn sο badly in their hοur οf need.
What are yοu dοing? Get up!
Yοu can't sit there! Get up!
- Why nοt? It's a chair.
- Nο, it... That is nοt a chair!
That is... That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- Peοple have carved their names οn it.
That chair is the seat οn which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rοck.
- That is the Stοne οf Scοne!
- Yοu are trivializing everything.
- I dοn't care hοw many rοyal asshοles
- have sat οn this chair.
- Listen tο me! Listen tο me!
- Listen tο yοu? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if yοu must.
- I am yοur King!
- Nο, yοu're nοt.
Yοu tοld me sο yοurself.
Yοu said yοu didn't want it.
Why shοuld I waste my time listening tο yοu?
Because I have a right tο be heard!
I have a vοice!
Yes, yοu dο.
Yοu have such perseverance, Bertie.
Yοu're the bravest man I knοw.
Yοu'll make a blοοdy gοοd King.
- What οn earth is gοing οn, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishοp.
Mr. Lοgue, yοu must knοw that
I've fοund a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, yοur services will nο lοnger be required.
- I'm sοrry?
- Yοur Majesty's functiοn is tο cοnsult and be advised.
Nοw, yοu didn't cοnsult,
- but yοu have just been advised.
- And nοw I advise yοu.
In this persοnal matter,
I will make my οwn decisiοn.
My cοncern is fοr the head οn which I must place the crοwn.
I appreciate that, Archbishοp.
But it's my head.
Yοur humble servant.
Thank yοu, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse? Cοme οn.
Up οn yοur perch.
Nοw, when yοu and Elizabeth enter thrοugh the West dοοr, yοu will be greeted by the hymn
"I was glad when they said untο me."
Actually, yοu wοn't be that glad because they dο sing it fοr a very lοng time.
Then yοur friend, the Archbishοp, will pοnce up the stairs tοwards yοu, and say, "Sir, is Yοur Majesty willing tο take the οath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, οf cοurse yοu are.
I'm gοnna see what this sοunds like in the cheap seats, sο even yοur οld nanny can hear.
"Will yοu gοvern yοur peοples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, accοrding tο their lands and custοms?"
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
- Lοuder.
- I can't hear yοu up the back.
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
Very gοοd. "And will yοu, tο yοur pοwer, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy tο be executed in all yοur judgments?"
"I will. [lοuder] I will!"
Then there's a very lοng bit abοut uphοlding the faith. It gοes οn, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, tο which yοu finally say...
"The things which I have... here befοre prοmised,
I will perfοrm and keep.
Sο help me Gοd."
And that's all yοu say.
Fοur shοrt respοnses.
Kiss the bοοk, sign the οath, and yοu're King.
Easy.
[Man on film speaks indistinctly]
Yοu nearly crοwned him backwards,
Archbishοp.
Sοmeοne had remοved the thread marking the back οf the crοwn, sir.
Try nοt tο lοse the thread, Archbishοp.
- [Chuckles]
- Archbishοp, we're missing Papa.
- [All] God save the King.
- Very gοοd.
Very gοοd, Archbishοp.
Well, I hοpe Yοur Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- Yοu can switch that machine οff.
- Nο, wait. Keep gοing.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Dο take a seat, Archbishοp.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience
- of the Fuhrer.
- [Speaking German]
- Papa? Papa, what's he saying?
- [Bertie] Hmm?
I dοn't knοw, but he seems tο be saying it rather well.
Sir... I have asked tο see yοu tοday in οrder tο tender my resignatiοn as Prime Minister.
I'm sο sοrry tο hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter οf principle.
I was mistaken.
I have fοund it impοssible tο believe that there is any man in the wοrld sο lacking in mοral feeling as Hitler, that the wοrld may be hurled fοr a secοnd time intο the abyss οf destructive war.
Churchill was right all alοng.
This was always Hitler's intentiοn.
I'm οnly very sοrry tο leave yοu at this great time οf crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that yοur greatest test is yet tο cοme.
[Chamberlain on radio]
I am speaking to you...
...from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland,
- a state of war would exist between us.
- [Dοοr shuts]
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is yοur speech.
Yοu are οn air at six.
I have timed it tο just under nine minutes.
The wοrding is fully apprοved.
The Prime Minister will be jοining yοu fοr the brοadcast, which will gο οut live acrοss the natiοn, the Empire
- and tο οur armed fοrces.
- Get Lοgue here immediately.
- [Laurie] There's the barrage ballοοns.
- [Liοnel] Yes.
- They gοt them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- [Air-raid siren wails]
- [Indistinct shοuting]
- Shall we pull οver and find a shelter?
- Nο, nο. Gο straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Liοnel Lοgue.
Majοr Hartley is expecting me.
This is my sοn, Laurie.
- Thank yοu, Laurie.
- Gοοd luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank yοu, sir.
We have abοut 40 minutes tο the brοadcast.
Thank yοu very much. Thank yοu.
[Bertie] There may be dark days ahead...
...and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitatiοns intο pauses and say tο yοurself, "Gοd save the King."
I say that cοntinuοusly, but apparently nο οne's listening.
Lοng pauses are gοοd.
They add sοlemnity tο great οccasiοns.
Then I'm the sοlemnest king whο ever lived.
Yοu knοw, if I'm a king, where's my pοwer?
Can I... can I fοrm a gοvernment?
Can I... can I... levy a tax?
Declare a... a war? Nο.
And yet I'm the seat οf all authοrity.
Why? Because...
...the natiοn believes that when I... I speak,
I speak fοr them. But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again frοm the tοp.

...between οurselves...
...and those...
...whο are nοw οur... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been fοrced intο a cοnflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped οf all disguise, is surely the mere...
...primitive dοctrine that might...
...is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we shοuld refuse tο meet...
...the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them tο stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently cοmmit οur cause tο Gοd.
If οne and all we keep resοlutely faithful tο it, then, with Gοd's help, we shall... prevail.

Connie? When you get a moment, can you just have a walkthrough?
Just give me five minutes to settle in.
Morning. Morning, morning.
Everything all right?
Yeah, I overslept.
How's George?
Don't ask.
I've been up half the night.
You're all right, you've got time.
Man!
Ladies, if I could interrupt you a second...
- Come on. Cover up.
- Please, ladies behave.
Cover yourselves.
Cover yourselves up.
Oh, here he is.
What if your husbands saw you?
What would they say, eh?
Come on, girls, this is important!
Thank you, Connie. Thank you.
Shut up! Now, shut up.
Do you wanna hear what I gotta say or not?
Yeah.
Right.
Now, listen.

Oh, come on.
Now, the deadline we set the management to respond to our complaint about how they've regraded you unskilled...
Shh!
Has now passed. Shut up!
Which means you've gotta vote on the threat we made in the original communique.

And a one-day stoppage to take place on the 29th of May.
All right? You got that? Right, now, those for industrial action, hands up.
Yes.

Want another one, anyone?
I'll have one.
Yeah.

No.
I'll be up all night.
Come on, mate.

Yeah, yeah. Please.
Come on.

You sure you don't wanna sit down, Sandra?
Are you joking? I want a snowball.
George, you ain't even tripped the old, uh... Come on.
No, no, no. It's all right.
Please.
Do you mind, George, if I have this one?
Like to keep me hand in.
Jitterbug, twist, all them.
You be careful.
We need you on top form tomorrow.
What you talking about?
Fantastic.
- No, no, no. Not being funny.
- All right. All right.
- Good night.
- Thanks.
Sandra. Sandra.
Sleep well.
Sandra.
Happy birthday.
- Good night.
- Be good.
Hang on. I don't live here.
Wait.
What?
Now, what was that for?
Nothing. I just like you, that's all.
Yeah? Come here.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Not out here.
You're better than that, are you?
Actually, yeah, I am.
Graham?
Graham. Breakfast.
There you go.
I don't feel very well.
Don't you?
You're not hot.
It's my stomach.
Okay, what's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
Well, give us a look, then.
No.
I never done nothing. Honest.
Mr. Clarke again?
It'll be fine, okay?
Now, eat some breakfast and get dressed. I'll deal with it.
Sharon? Chop-chop.
Eddie. Come on, lover boy.
No, no, just clear off, I'm dying.
We're all dying.
We've all gotta go to work.
Eddie?
Oh, you cheeky cow. Come here.
God.
Balls.
Balls, balls, balls. Bollocks.
Yes?
Mr. Clarke?
Can I have a word?
Of course. How can I help?
You hit my son.
On his hand. Caned him.
And it ain't the first time.
Yes. O'Grady. I remember.
Forgot his protractor.
And it isn't the first ti...
Don't care whether it's the hundredth time.
I don't want you doing it.
You live on the estate, don't you?
I don't see what that's got...
We find boys who come to us from the estate often have difficulty in adjusting to the standards of behavior required in a school like this.
It isn't really their fault.
Their parents have never undergone the full rigor of academic life.
The boys can hardly look to them for guidance, can they?
But they do adapt in time.
And I'm sure your son will too, if he's just given the chance.
But thank you for your concern,
Mrs. O'Grady.
Are you all right?
Fuck off.
Hold on, is this Sandra's?
Yeah, I know.
Connie? Con?
Sandra's at it again, look.
You've gotta say something.
She hasn't.
You've gotta talk to her.
Don't wave at us, silly cow.
We're moaning about you.
I'll do it.
No, you can't keep covering for her.
I'll talk to her.
Will you?
Here it comes. Oh, no.
Look at that.
We might as well not have a roof.
How many times have we asked to fix this?
It's not difficult, is it?
Connie, listen.
Albert.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Oh, my God.
- I didn't realize. I'm sorry. Oh, God.
- You were saying?
There's a meeting tomorrow.
At Ford's headquarters down in Warley.
You're joking.
I'm not.
Machinists threatening strike action, they couldn't believe it.
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.
We'll have to make a good strategy.
They'll have Hopkins and Jones and Grant, miserable sod.
Now, who have we got on our side? We've got, um,
Monty Taylor from the head office, he's coming.
There's me, two. You, Con, three.
Well, that leaves us one short.
Why?
Little principle I picked up in the war, Eileen.
Turn up with more on your side than they've got on their side and turn up when they're least expecting it.
So who's gonna make the fourth man?
Oh, not me.
I'm not going.
Any takers? No?
You want it?
Fuck off.
Come on. It's a day off.
- Oh, actually.
- Yeah, you all wanna go now.
Yeah. I ain't having that.
What?
Yeah.
Go on, Rita. Day off.
Go on, Rita.
You'd be great, Rita.
Go on, then.
Yeah, right.
What do you have to do?
All right, Gordon?
Hello, Sandra.
Think you're going?
It's the new Escort. Finally designed something people like.
They can get fucked.
That's right.
We ain't working no overtime.
Me and the boys were saying we'd have gone on strike just having to turn up in a pig hole like this.
You know it's raining here, don't you?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- See you tomorrow, Connie.
- I think he likes you.
It's going, it's going.
The police are being pushed backwards.
There's screaming now.
Absolute hysteria.
Now you can see the banners are being used as clubs...
No, they don't want so much.
No, look what you're doing...
Sharon?
Don't open my share.
Turn the telly off now, there's a good girl. Now, please.
Wake your dad up.
Wake up, Dad.
Right. Pull your finger out.
Help your mum.
Square eyes, what have I told you?
Dad, Martine Clarke's got color.
I've seen it.
Martine Clarke's got color, has she?
We'll go around her house and watch it after tea, won't we?
Her mum'll be pleased.
Look, we'll have color soon.
Once you can rent them.
Eddie, don't go promising color.
We haven't even paid for the fridge yet.
And the three piece is still on tick.
Now we've got all this unrest at work.
What unrest?
Oh, that? You had a vote, Rita.
Unrest is when you actually come out and strike. Blimey.
No, don't look like that.
I'm only joking.
All right.
I'm proud of you.
We all are, aren't we?
Sticking to your guns.
We had a book going on the shop floor.
No one thought you'd even take the vote so, yeah, good on you. Well done.
Ain't just a vote now.
Got a meeting tomorrow, all the bosses.
And I'm going.
Oh?
It's all right, I'll plate your tea up in the morning and then if I'm back late, you can just heat it through.
Apparently, you go to a Berni Inn on the way there.
That's snazzy.
Isn't it?
It'll be all right, won't it?
Yeah, of course.
We don't have to do anything.
The men will do all the talking.
No, I mean, it's not too posh in there, is it?
I'm wearing the right stuff?
No, you'll be fine.
I'm so glad you're here.
After you, ladies.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
- Here you are, sir.
- Lovely.
Do you ever worry about your waist?
You're joking.
That steak.
Bearnaise sauce.
It's Monty. He always insists on coming here.
As long as the union's paying.
Rita.
Yeah.
Word of advice.
When we get there, don't let them lure you in.
If they seem to be asking you a question, keep your head down.
I'll handle it.
Above all, if I nod, you nod.
Got that?
Right.
That nice, was it?
It's lovely, thank you.
I couldn't eat another thing.
Oh. Mr. Dawson. I'm sorry, we weren't expecting you until...
It's quite all right. It's no problem.
Oh, and there's four of us.
You might need an extra chair.
Right.
Two teas.
On a previous occasion, in a free vote, the girls agreed to the new grading structure.
They did not agree, however, as to where they would end up on it.
Which is why we're sitting round this table.
Look, I understand what the girls are saying. I just don't...
I'd rather you didn't speak for the girls, Mr. Hopkins.
None of us here knows what's in their heads.
The fact remains there's a formal grievance procedure in place and the machinists' case will be heard.
What we can't do is let them jump the queue.
Peter, look, you know me.
I ain't got no ax to grind with Ford.
- Am I right or am I right?
- You've always been fair.
Exactly. Ah, we're all men of the world.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
We'll reconvene in two weeks' time.
Monty.
Listen.
We'll reconvene, we'll come back down here again for the day and then at that point you can guarantee to look into the girls' complaint.
The thing is, Monty...
That way you can go back to your bosses and say that the strike's off because of how you've handled today's negotiations.
We can go back to the girls and say they're now your number-one priority in a few weeks' time.
That seems very fair.
I'm not so sure the girls'll be too happy.
The girls will be fine.
As long as they know they're not being fobbed off by the management.
The union's setting the terms.
That's what's important.
Bollocks.
What?
I'm sorry, Albert, but it is.
Three hours we've been sat here.
"That's what matters to the girls"?
How you qualify to talk about that, I do not know.
Here. Have a look at this.
There.
You put them together.
Go on.
It's Ford property, I believe.
Oh, stop it.
We have to take these different pieces and work out how they go together.
Because there ain't no template, is there?
We have to take them and sew them all freehand into the finished article.
The same with the door trim and God knows what else.
That is not unskilled work, which is how you've regraded us.
Christ, you need to take an exam to get on our line.
Please, miss, l...
No, it's Mrs. O'Grady.
Mrs. O'Grady,
I understand your grievance...
Well, I really don't think you do.
It's not difficult, though.
We're entitled to semi-skilled and the wages what go with it.
Bring this to the meeting...
Hang on.
And as regards to this queue-jumping business, well, we put this complaint in months ago, didn't we?
It's just you've done nothing about it.
And we all know why.
That's because women have never been on strike before, isn't it?
You just thought you could forget it and we'd all go away. Well, I'm sorry, but it isn't gonna be that easy because we're not going anywhere.
We're gonna do what we said we would.
No more overtime and an immediate 24-hour stoppage.
And where it goes from there, well, it's up to you.
If you'll excuse me, I've really got to be going.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Thank you.
You think I like looking stupid?
I didn't know what she was gonna do.
You didn't know they were in her handbag, pull them out?
Look at his face.
Oh, don't worry, you were great.
Thank you very much, Albert.
Thank you very much.
I knew, I knew.
It's up here, you see.
I wanted clever, Rita, that's why I picked you.
Oh, stop it.
When you pulled out these cuttings, oh, that was amazing.
It was. I never expected that, that you'd come prepared.
Oh, no, he was right.
I was nicking them.
Yeah, Eddie uses them to patch the tent up for when we go camping.
All the same. Listen, don't worry about
Monty, I'll handle him. Don't worry.
Can I have them back?
Oh, yeah.
Cheers.
What are you gonna say to them?
You tell them.
You what?
This is your fault.
All right. Hold that.
Right.
Everybody out.
I can't believe it.
It's all right.
I could do with a cup of tea.
I could do with something a lot stronger than that.
Now, I realize this is my first day in the job and it may be that I am missing something here, but when we were elected two years ago, it was on a wave of optimism that Labour would utilize its close relationship with the unions to develop manufacturing industry so that it would better serve the employer and the employee.
Yes, I think that was in the manifesto.
It was. Trust me.
So, what have you been doing since 1966?
L...
Two years this department has had in which to make a difference.
Shall we see what has been achieved in the last 12 months?
Twenty-six thousand strikes in the United Kingdom, with the resulting loss of 5 million working days.
Unions and management barely talking to each other, productivity levels through the floor, and our balance of payments, the wrong side of catastrophic.
It's hardly the stuff to set the champagne corks popping, is it?
Thank you.
See yourselves out.
Here you are, babes, you forgot your flask.
I love you Dave, cheers.
You too, darling. Good luck.
You get stuck in, girls.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Monica, that's yours.
Cheers, love.
Happy with that.
It's a holiday.
What's this? A mothers' meeting?
Hey, cheeky sod. Are you all right?
How you getting on?
Give us half a chance.
Good luck.
See you later.
Come on, ladies, let's hear you.
Bye. See you later.
Cheers, Eddie.
What have you done to your eyes?
It's amazing, isn't it?
My friend showed me how.
Scouts everywhere.
That's how Twiggy got discovered.
Up west, you dozy sod, not Dagenham.
You never know.
We'd better shut this gate.
I've spelt it right, haven't I?
Close the gate.
I know.
At least they know we're serious, eh?
Not as helpless as they thought.
Come on then, girls.
No more seats today, Mr. Ford.
Come on, girls, let's get together.
What if we form a line or something?
Line up there.
Yeah.
Hold the banners up.
- We need some in the back.
- Standing?
- Like that.
- Come on, then.
That's it.
Here we go.
Like this?
Yeah.
They're running low on finished seats.
So get these down to the Cortina line, then come back for the Escorts.
They're calling.
Come on.
Anyone fancy a cuppa?
Yeah.
Tea's up, ladies.
Come on.
Yeah, put that down a bit.
That's gonna hurt your arms.
Get me Tooley.
Stand by, girls, could be trouble.
- Hello, girls.
- What's Brenda got?
Tea's up.
Bananas, apples, pears, the lot.
Thanks for the ride, Arthur.
He's lovely.
Brenda, you never.
- Why not? He's gorgeous.
- I would.
Just as I was leaving with the fruit, he goes:
"I believe all the workers of the world should unite." So I thought:
"I can help you with that one straight away."
So I did.
Hey, Peter. Bobby here.
What can I do for you?
We've got another dispute,
I'm afraid.
Another one? Who is it this week?
It's the women.
Quick. Quick, quick.
Come along, girls.
You're gonna get soaked, love.
Oh, no.
They're gonna drip, aren't they?
- It'll pass.
- What are we gonna do now?
Pubs ain't even open.
Monica.
Just wanna have some chips.
I suppose we've done a full day, haven't we?
- We have, haven't we?
- Yeah.
I have gotta get down the dogs later.
Yeah. I did promise my mum
I'd cook her tea.
Did you?
Yeah.
Oh, sod it. We've registered the protest, haven't we?
Yeah.
Go on. School's out.
Yeah!
Home time.
Onwards and upwards, Rita.
- Well done, girls.
- See you.
Hey, and Rita, well done.
It was your gob what got us here, wasn't it?
Sandra?
I've just been round to your house.
I've just been round to your house.
Why?
I thought you would've gone home ages ago.
No.
I'm lucky if I can get the lads to hold out for a full hour.
Look, I wanted a little chat.
You fancy a cup of tea?
I can't. I'm sorry, I've got stuff to...
I'm buying.
Go on, then. Seeing as it's pelting it down, a quick cuppa won't hurt.
Over there by the window.
Over there.
I'm dripping all over the floor.
Come on, Albert, spit it out.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's all right.
This dispute's got nothing to do with what skill level you are.
Ford decided to give you less money because they can.
They're allowed to pay women a lower wage than men.
All over the country, Rita, women are getting less because they're women.
You'll always come second.
You'll always be fighting over the scraps.
Until you...
We get equal pay, yeah.
Yeah.
What I don't get is why it's so important to you.
I got brought up by my mum.
Me and me brothers.
She worked all her life and she paid my Aunt Lil to take care of us during the day.
And it was hard.
Especially as she was getting less than half what the blokes at the factory was getting for doing the same work.
And there was never any question that it could be any different.
Not for her.
Yeah.
Someone has gotta stop these exploiting bastards getting away with what they've been doing for years.
And you can.
You can, Rita, believe me.
What about Connie? I mean, she's shop steward.
We voted for her.
But this needs a leader.
Someone to inspire the girls, to make the points clear.
And that ain't Connie.
Not at the moment.
Not with George the way he is.
I've already spoke to her.
She's more than happy for you to have a go.
More than.
Look, don't say nothing now.
Just sleep on it. Will you?
Do you want to wait in here?
Ey?
Do you want to wait in here?
No, you're all right.
It's tipping it down. Please.
I'm dripping.
I know. Get in.
I'll get it all over your car.
Come in, quick, quick, quick.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Gosh, you're soaked.
I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
I'll ruin your car.
We met before, actually.
Do you remember, in the corridor?
Yeah.
I've been hoping to run into you for a day or two, actually.
Oh, yeah?
Um...
I was wondering if you'd sign a letter.
I'm making a formal complaint to the headmaster about
Clarke's use of the cane.
What?
He seems to think my son...
Sorry, I mean...
You were there for the same reason I was?
Yes. He was indiscreet enough to mention you.
Of course.
I think he was suggesting we were hysterical and desperately needed to calm down.
I had it all straight in my head what I was gonna tell him and what I was gonna say.
It's just...
Oh, you can't talk to Mr. Clarke.
I mean, nobody can. He...
You have to listen.
He's a bully.
Which is why he beats them.
Yeah.
Yeah. Go on, then.
Give us a pen.
Thanks.
It's stopped.
Yeah. That's just my luck, isn't it?
Thanks.
Look, um,
I know you're not mentioning it because you're being polite. It's just...
You know, when we met in the corridor, I was really upset, and I never usually use that type of language.
Don't you?
No.
Because I called Mr. Clarke a complete cock.
Oh. Oh!
Did you? Fair enough.
Well, he is.
Here they come.
Left a bit of a puddle, now.
It's all right, David's getting in the back.
That dress, I've seen it before, it's lovely. In Vogue.
Oh, thanks. It's Biba.
Is it? Well...
Well, it's still gorgeous.
Have a good day, yeah?
You too. Be good.
And you.
Hell, Sandra. I think you've had a bit of shrinkage in the wash.
Hot pants. Mary Quants.
Give them back to her, they look painful.
I think they look lovely.
Thanks.
It's like what Brenda said, isn't it?
This ain't Knightsbridge, it's Dagenham.
If you wanna get spotted, you gotta stand out more.
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Yesterday were great, weren't it?
- Being on strike?
Yeah.
It's a glimpse, isn't it?
Of how it could be.
Well, that's what it's about, isn't it?
Pitch-bleeding-black. I couldn't see me hand in front of me face.
Finally when he turns the lights on, it was actually stuck to me bottom lash.
She got fired.
Blimey.
I'm here, just. Oh, Christ.
Connie? Con?
Rita, l...
No, I just wanna say something.
Sorry, I just, um...
If I was to get a bit more involved, you know, with Albert, it's only because
I've got a gob on me.
You're the heartbeat of this place, always have been.
Rita, look at me, all at sixes and sevens.
You can do this and you should.
Here we go.
Man!
Brian.
Hello, Brian.
Is that a cotton bob in your pocket or a hard-on?
- What's he doing?
- Having a fiddle.
Here, Con. Pass them out, girls.
Yeah, come on, Rita.
Go on, Rita. Give them hell.
Ignore it.
Ignore it?
Standard issue, day after a walkout.
Have you seen the language?
"Your aggressive disregard for the existing complaints procedure."
Tone of that?
They don't mean it.
So why are they saying it?
That's how we've always done it.
All the other strikes.
It's like the rules.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
Sorry, we ain't playing that game.
We ain't your men.
We're us. And we certainly won't be addressed in this manner.
No.
All those in favor of not only maintaining but increasing our current action by going to an all-out stoppage until we get the same rates of pay as the men?
What?
Equal pay?
Why not? Because that's what this is really about, isn't it?
We're on the lowest rate in the whole factory despite the fact we've got considerable skill.
And there's only one possible reason for that.
It's because we're women.
Yeah.
And in the workplace, women get paid less no matter what skill they got.
Which is why, from now on, we gotta demand a level playing field and rates of pay which reflect the job, not whether you've got a dick or not.
This strike is about one thing
Fairness.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
Equal pay or nothing.
Yes.
All those in favor?
Yes.
Everybody out.
Well, it's got nothing to do with me.
An all-out stoppage?
Also, the specifics of this strike, they've widened out a bit.
Christ.
Shit.
Fucking Ada. Equal pay?
What were you thinking, Monty?
It wasn't me, it was Albert.
He went behind me back.
Really, Monty?
He's a loose cannon.
You wanna haul someone over the coals, he's your man.
The bloody troublemaker.
Get him in.
I tried to protect you, Albert.
But you're gonna get such a fucking bollocking.
Come on, then.
This is awkward, Albert.
You know that, don't you?
It jeopardizes a whole raft of other negotiations that the unions are already at loggerheads with management over.
Look, comrade, basically, you encouraging these women to get all militant...
It shifts resources away from the blokes, who are the ones at the coalface.
We ain't unsympathetic, but as a union, we have to remember who comes first.
The Communist Party and Marx himself said:
"Men write their own history."
That's "men," Albert.
But didn't he also say,
"Progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"?
Or was that a different Marx?
That was Groucho, was it?
Equal pay across the board.
You telling me that ain't worth fighting for?
Of course it is.
And you know it.
I'll tell you something.
This Rita has got a bigger set of balls than you three put together.
And she ain't scared to lay them on the line neither.
And I, for one, am gonna help her.
And if you are what you say you are, an organization pledged to support its members, then you'll get off your lazy, fat arses and you'll help her too.
Good fucking evening.
They can't expect us to carry on being graded unskilled.
Unskilled, my arse.
We're here to put across our point of view about what's going on. It ain't fair.
And also about how it's a part of something bigger, much bigger.
What about a little bit of support this way?
Come on, mate.
You might learn something if you just listened.
The time has come for all women to say "enough."
We do not and we will not accept this any longer.
Ow!
Dad, the pan.
Bollocks!
No, Daddy didn't mean that.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
That was magnificent.
That was wonderful.
Be back in a minute.
You're doing the same work for Ford here in Liverpool that we're doing for them down in Dagenham.
So you know that our job is skilled.
She's a bit of all right.
Think beyond that.
I'm asking you to strike now for all women, not just machinists.
Leave him alone.
He's gotta concentrate.
Go, get back.
Have a word with him.
And what is right is that every single one of us is entitled to the same pay as men.
Yeah!
That's my girl.
Will all those in favor please put your hands in the air now?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Well...
How'd you get on?
We slaughtered them.
Every single one of them came out.
It was incredible though, Eddie.
Well done.
Go and check on the kids.
Give them a quick kiss good night.
Gonna take some money, all right?
Oh, no. What happened?
Dad.
Tell him to give it another go, yeah?
I'm off. See you later. You're all right taking them to school, aren't you?
Of course.
You're all right with that?
Everything's all right, isn't it?
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
No reason. Have a good day.
See you later.
This is me last one.
Ey?
The shirt, I just noticed.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I forgot.
Forgot washing Monday.
I'll do it tonight.
Right.
- Take care of your dad.
- Bye, Mum.
Have a good day.
Oh, dear.
Come on.
Come on, girls.
Equal pay.
Equal pay.
Equal pay.
Which way?
Wait a minute.
No, Ri, it's here.
It's down this way.
It must be up here.
Anyone got a map?
There.
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, here we are.
- Here we go.
We want respect. We want respect.
We want respect. We want respect.
Get the banner up.
Look, get that.
There.
Equal pay for women!
- I'll support you.
- Thank you for your support.
Equal pay for women.
Women workers for equal pay.
- We want respect.
- Darling, over here.
We want respect!
Hey!
Hello.
I finish at 4. Give us a call, love?
I never thought we'd get this backing.
Show us what you got.
Hold on, girls!
We're not entirely unfurled, look.
Don't we all?
I know the feeling.
Don't look, boys.
In their campaign for equal pay, women workers of Ford Dagenham brought their protest to Westminster today.
Some didn't need much persuasion to demonstrate their feminine charms.
It's interesting, all this politics, when you get down to it. Oh, sorry.
How long will they stay out?
Must be starting to bite.
As long as it takes.
Does your husband support you?
He has to.
Yeah.
Yes, of course he does.
And we all supported the men when they went out on strike. Yeah.
Does it bother you that you've been described as the Revlon revolutionary?
Have they been in touch about doing some modeling?
I don't think so.
I think you're talking to the wrong girl.
Actually...
No, I prefer to focus on the issues of the strike.
What makes this strike different is it's not about a specific pay...
Ain't that something, eh?
Yeah, she's doing all right.
This is Laurie Cannon,
BBC News, at Westmin...
She mentioned you on the telly there, Ed.
I tell you what, that's some woman you got there.
Right. I gotta get going.
What, already?
Gotta fetch the kids.
Rita reckons they ain't gonna be back till 6, so I need to get them sorted.
Get your apron.
Shut up, you.
Tell her to get her finger out.
It's gone on long enough.
I don't think they're dragging it out.
It's all right for you, it's different for me.
I can't be doing with this strike.
Yeah, I know that, and they'll settle it.
Soon as they can.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah. See you later, Ed.
Top it up, would you,
Pete, please?
There's nothing I can do about it.
Come and have a look for yourself.
That's what I'm saying, you've had them all.
There are no more finished seats.
Full stop.
Frank, what do you want me to do?
We're going home, mate.
You what?
No more seats, no more jobs.
For any of us.
You lot are a bit early, aren't you?
Hey, what's going on?
You've shut the factory.
Well done.
Ford's Dagenham.
The plant is mainly idle.
With thousands laid off, strike bound, and production barely ticking over, millions of vital pounds being lost in export orders.
And until there's an answer to the rift between management and Ford's machinists, the factory gates will remain closed indefinitely to the entire work force.
You all right?
Yeah.
Been busy, have you?
Yeah.
It's the final push, Eddie.
Entire main plant closed down.
Ford can't afford that, so...
I mean, I'm sorry about you and the lads and everything.
Oh, no, don't worry about us, Rita.
We was only saying on the way out it's warm weather at the moment.
Cut the gas off, we'll hardly notice.
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, Eddie, you know, I know how you feel.
All them times you've been on strike and us girls come out in support of you men.
It's meant no work for us either.
Yeah.
Have you got something on your mind, Eddie?
Ey?
Got something on your mind?
Got nothing on me mind.
I'm fine. I'd say.
Good.
It ain't been the easiest day for me either.
Thank you for waiting.
I have Mr. Ford for you gentlemen.
I thought your boy said he could handle this.
Do we even know what we're dealing with?
Socialist Workers Party?
Workers Revolutionary Party?
Revolutionary
Communist-fucking-Party?
Who's she with?
Well, we don't actually think she's with anyone, sir.
We actually don't think she's a communist. She looks...
I don't care if she looks like Jane-fucking-Fonda.
I wanna know why she's acting like this.
As a matter of fact, she hasn't got a political background either inside or outside the union.
Her husband is a moderate.
We just think she's got a beef.
A beef? Heh. Have you tried getting a decent steak in England?
If this woman gets what she wants, we'll end up having to do it right across the world.
Do you understand that?
Yes, sir, I do.
Good.
So deal with it.
Guess you'll be getting the next flight.
Yeah.
Prime Minister, I don't think you appreciate the urgency...
The urgency of the situation.
Fetch. Good dog, Barry.
- That's it.
- Prime Minister?
Until you help me,
I cannot get this country back to work.
I understand that, but we need to tread carefully.
Draw the unions in.
We have to acknowledge that without the unions, there would be no Labour Party.
Hm.
I was a member of the trade union movement while you were still at your mother's breast.
Unless you've got something to add beyond the obvious,
I'd prefer it if you keep quiet.
Harold, you asked me to do this job.
You appointed me.
You're the best man in my cabinet, I often say that.
Harold, I cannot do it without you.
I need you.
Jack Scamp, he's your man.
Any impasse, get Jack in.
Sits them all around a table, beer and pork pie.
Straight-talking negotiation.
He's the way forward.
Beer and pork pie?
Mm-hm.
Might not do for the latest one down at Ford.
A hundred and eighty-seven machinists, all women.
Well, perhaps we can get them a finger buffet in, eh?
Finger buffet? Good.
- So how was the flight?
- It was long.
I'm sorry to drag you over.
Well, they're taking this very seriously, right at the top.
Come in, my wife's cooking dinner.
Well, I don't wanna be any trouble.
Honestly, it's the least I can do.
Lisa, this is Robert Tooley.
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
At last.
I was telling Peter that I'm perfectly happy to eat later at the hotel so...
It's really no problem.
She loves to cook, don't you?
Let me take your hat and coat.
Thank you.
Come through, have a drink.
I'll run you back when we're finished.
Thank you. It was delicious.
Lovely.
Thank you.
Can you bring some brandy glasses back in with you?
Absolutely.
Lisa? Do you mind if I call you Lisa?
You must have quite a head on your shoulders.
Peter tells me that you read history at Cambridge?
- Yes, I did.
- Do you mind if I ask what do you think of our little problem over at the factory?
Do you think maybe he's a bit too much velvet glove?
Not enough iron fist?
Oh, not at all, no.
No, quite the opposite actually.
Look at Vauxhall.
They don't have any problems with the unions because General Motors has a more collaborative approach to management.
Whereas at Ford, you...
Well, you only deal with the unions because you have to.
You tolerate them.
And as a result, they're more entrenched and they're aggressive in their dealings with you.
Well, ha-ha, that's a very progressive point of view.
Don't you think?
Cheese.
What?
We have some Stilton.
Why don't you get that out?
Right.
Some grapes.
- Yes, good idea.
- That'll be terrific, thank you.
Come on, girls. There's a cauliflower or cabbage for everyone.
Cauliflower again?
Haven't got anything else?
Blimey, he must love you.
I've never had real pineapple.
- Let her know it's yours.
- Go on, Mum.
Sandra, here's your strike pay.
Thanks.
Three quid?
Yeah, I know it's not much.
It's all the union can afford, I'm afraid.
Better than nothing.
I'll take it back if you don't want it.
No.
Oh, all right then.
Sandra, cauliflower or cabbage?
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Come on, take one.
No, I'm all right.
I've gotta go, actually.
So I'll see you all later.
See you.
See you later.
This one's for Connie, you seen her?
I haven't.
I'll give it to her.
Monica?
Oh, is that Connie's? I'll take it.
No, it ain't all your responsibility.
Yeah, I know.
I wanna see her anyway.
- Is that real pineapple?
- You bet.
Can I have some?
Go on, help yourself.
- See you.
- See you.
- Bye.
- Later, Rita.
Come on, girls, get stuck in.
There you go. My God.
- So sweet.
- Yeah, it's just like him.
Connie?
Connie, are you there?
Got you a present.
It's from Brenda's fella.
Makes a change from potatoes, eh?
Albert's been in touch.
There's a meeting down the union.
Sounds important.
Thinks we should be there.
No, I don't think so.
What are you talking about?
Connie?
George is ill, Rita.
You know that.
He's touched.
The strike's just whipping everything up.
I've gotta put him first.
Look, Connie, I know it's hard...
No, you don't.
I'm not his wife anymore.
I'm more like his sister or his...
But I'm his.
That's all he's got left.
Connie, I ain't saying you gotta give up on him.
You've got a life too, you know.
You gotta live it.
Or the war's gonna end up destroying two people.
George. George. Shh, shh.
It's all right, it's all right,
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
It doesn't matter.
I'll change it, come on.
Out you come.
What the hell do you care?
I know what you're up to.
You're gonna put me away!
George. Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Monty, this is Mr. Tooley, he's from...
Good afternoon, Mr. Taylor.
Go break the strike, please.
As soon as possible.
I'm not sure you appreciate whose side I'm on.
Oh, yes, I do. I've been going through your file here.
File?
You seem to be on your side, Mr. Taylor.
I beg your pardon?
I don't have to listen to this.
Yeah, that's it, keep walking and in six months' time, your union won't exist.
Industry cannot afford to pay women the same rates as men, gentlemen.
That is a fact.
If it is forced to, it will collapse, under the weight of the extra wages.
Its workers will get laid off.
Their union subscriptions will disappear and so will the unions which collect them.
That means you, Monty.
You would no longer have any reason to visit these gentlemen via the...
What is it? Berni Inn, is it?
The Queen's Head? The Chequers?
Wow, that's a lot of restaurants.
Not to mention the all-expenses-paid trips to the party conferences to the union conferences.
In Paris, no less.
The Gallic rank and file.
Good on you, Monty.
These women get what they want and you're fucked.
I'd start thinking less about what your union can do for you and more about what you can do for your union.
Go break the strike.
Please.
Personnel files, gentlemen.
Everyone's got a weakness, you just have to find it.
Hello?
Yeah, hello, yes. Yeah, it is.
It's all right. I got your note.
Thank you.
Sorry, I was busy when you came round.
What?
Really?
Hello, Gordon. You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right. You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Yeah? Course you are.
Well, you don't have to work, do you?
Ey?
You can afford to have principles.
I mean, you ain't the breadwinner.
It's nice. It's a bit extra, but you don't have to. I have to fucking work.
Pay the electric and the food and the coal, the fucking basics.
Only now I can't.
Fucking idiot.
Do you believe in this women's strike?
No, I don't.
They shouldn't get the same as lads.
You don't believe in equal pay?
No, no, no. Not for women.
The men are the breadwinners.
The women shouldn't strike because a lot of them husbands work here.
Now that the lads have been made redundant, they're gonna be nervous.
And Monty, Ford has rattled him, I can tell.
So be careful what news you share with him, all right?
That's our fridge.
Bingo.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
We ain't paid the HP.
Last of mine went in the electric bill.
How are you set?
You want me to hold the door open for you?
Go on. I'll make life a little bit easier for you.
You spent the money.
Ey?
Spent the last of the emergency, out of the repair kit.
I had to pay the milkman. Not that it matters, we ain't got a fridge.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
Could have put him off till next week.
He wanted paying.
Should've told him we didn't have it.
Right.
I'm in charge of the money.
Ain't much fucking good at it, are you?
We might have some left.
Welcome to the real world, Rita.
This is being on strike.
You run out of cash and you end up screaming at each other.
What happened to you?
Oh, shut up.
Don't you tell me "shut up." Eddie...
Hi, Rita.
All right, Marge?
I thought you were back at work.
Can you come in now?
In a minute.
No, no, we're still on strike.
Oh, right.
Sharon.
I was sure
I saw your Sandra down the factory.
Sandra?
Yeah, it was her.
Love, in a minute.
I'll see you later, all right?
All right.
I'm sorry, love.
Mummy's gotta sort something.
But you said...
Yeah, I know I did.
Eddie? Eddie, can you look after Sharon?
I'll be back later, love.
It's all right, sweetheart.
Yes. I like this.
This is beautiful. Hi. Sally, is it?
Sandra.
Sandra, yes.
Okay, chin up for me.
Find this light up here.
Find the birdie. There we go.
That's a little bit sexy.
Okay, there we go.
Fabulous, you're a natural.
Let's go down on the floor, here.
I like that. I like that.
And I fucking well like that.
I don't know about you guys,
I've forgotten about the car.
That's great. Let's go up here.
Let's go nice and high now, guys.
Straight into the camera.
Sandra.
Keep that. Just keep the pose going there, Sandra.
I'm sorry, can I just take a minute?
Do you wanna get...?
I need a minute.
Sure.
This is something I've always wanted.
I know.
I mean, I don't even know if I really care about equal pay.
I mean, it's still a shitty factory.
This is just a brochure, but, you know...
It's only trade, but it'll lead on.
Get my foot in the door, you know?
I just don't wanna let you down.
You haven't let us down.
You haven't gone back to work, have you?
Because that's the deal here, isn't it?
They set up this shoot, you go back to work?
Only you haven't gone back to work, have you? So...
But if they don't use these photos...
Sandra.
Look at you.
You are a model.
You're a natural.
They couldn't get better.
You could, though.
There she is.
Up against the clock now, my love.
Come along. Drape yourself across this vehicle. I shall avert my eyes.
How's this look?
No?
Hi, Mum.
Mum, we've gotta go.
Yes. Sorry, darling.
You're going, are you?
You know I am. I said.
Rita asked me to go special.
You gotta fight for what you believe in.
You know that more than anyone.
You think I'd do the same again?
If another war come round?
I know you would.
I love you.
Go.
Minister, the unions are turning.
The other unions.
Normally, they all band together.
Yes, I gather that's called solidarity.
They're not being solid.
The men want to return to work.
So they're telling unions to withdraw support, put pressure on the women.
They'll be back within the week.
We'll see.
You're assuming the girls will do as they're told.
It's not my fault.
Connie.
You said it was important.
Thanks.
Listen, I'm sorry I'm late.
We've got to talk before this meeting.
They're ready for you now.
This way, ladies.
They've hung you out to dry.
Lads in the other unions have had enough.
So whatever they say to you now, don't believe it.
We'll sort it out later, all right?
We're absolutely behind you still,
Rita. You and the girls.
We're not saying otherwise.
We've got other representatives from other unions to pledge their support.
You haven't got them all though, have you?
The important ones.
No, but we're very confident we'll prevail.
The thing is though, we've got the national conference coming up.
The most sensible thing, probably, would be just go to a vote.
Which would be the actual final and binding position, I believe, comrade.
After which, it'd be out of our hands.
That's right, Monty.
As I say, we're expecting full support.
We gotta get down to
Eastbourne and talk to them first.
"Actual final and binding position, comrade." Cheeky sod.
That Monty is a sly one though, isn't he?
I can't wait to see his face when we turn up down there.
See you tomorrow.
We can deal with him, Con.
We can deal with anyone.
That's right, comrade.
No! No, George!
No!
Connie! Connie!
Connie.
George!
Connie! Connie, let me in!
It's okay. Dear God.
May the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be with you always. Amen.
Amen.
I'm so sorry, Connie.
No, you're not.
What?
You thought he was a millstone.
You thought he was keeping me back.
Hey, Con, that's enough.
I should've been there.
I'm all right.
It's all right.
I know.
Hello.
Hello.
This is a surprise.
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's so late.
I nearly didn't come at all.
It's all right.
I...
Sorry, yeah.
Do you want a cup of tea?
To be honest, I'm not feeling chatty today. I'm sorry.
No, it's fine, really. I really don't want to keep you. It's just, um...
Mr. Clarke's been asked to leave the school.
We won.
They're getting rid of him.
Right. Of course, yeah.
Oh, that's great.
I just...
That's brilliant.
Well, I wanted to tell you.
Well, cheers. Thanks.
Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you.
Not at all, thanks.
I'm married to
Peter Hopkins.
Sorry, what?
At the factory.
I had a feeling that you didn't know.
And I didn't know who you were.
With the strike.
Sorry, I don't understand.
I'm sorry, if you've come here to tell me to back off,
I wasn't joking.
I've had a hell of a day and...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Keep going. Please, keep going.
Do you know who I am?
Who I actually am?
No.
I'm Lisa Burnett, I'm 31 years old.
I have a first-class honors degree from one of the finest universities in the world.
And my husband treats me like I'm a fool.
And when I was studying for my degree,
I was very, very happy.
And mostly because of the work.
Because I loved reading about all these extraordinary people making history.
And...
And I just wondered what it felt like.
So let me know, will you, when you finish doing it?
I don't know.
Don't give up.
Don't let me down.
Rita, wait! Where are you going?
Eastbourne. I left you a note.
- I thought you changed your mind.
- I gotta go.
Rita? Look, Rita, just stop.
What, Eddie?
Just listen to me. Just...
We've gotta sort this out.
Eddie...
No, no, no, we have, right? Just...
Look, I know it ain't been good between us lately, which I ain't about to make worse.
Eddie...
Just listen to me.
Look, if I ain't appreciated what you've done recently...
Gotta catch a bus.
I really am sorry, but you ain't been perfect either.
This really ain't the time, Eddie.
Yes, it is, because it needs saying.
I know you reckon I ain't bothered about the important things.
And I drift along and I'm more interested in fiddling with motorbikes or making tents out of seat covers, but, you know, I try me best.
You know? I have a go.
I like a drink, but I ain't out on the beer every night or screwing other women or...
And I've never once raised me hand.
Ever. Or the kids.
Christ.
What?
Why you looking like that?
Right. You're a saint now, is that what you're telling me, Eddie?
You're a bleeding saint?
Because you give us an even break?
What are you saying?
That is as it should be. Jesus, Eddie.
What do you think this strike's all been about?
Actually you're right.
You don't go on the drink.
Don't gamble, you join in with the kids, you don't knock us about. Lucky me.
For Christ's sake, Eddie, that's as it should be!
You try and understand that.
Rights, it's not privileges.
It's that easy. It really bloody is.
Didn't think you were coming.
Hey.
Very good, gentlemen.
Can I call on Monty Taylor,
Senior Convener, Ford Dagenham?
Thank you, I shall try to be brief.
If you would.
The great achievements of civilization depended on slow progress.
Step by step.
Hence, I am here because I feel that my union, in backing these lovely, brave ladies, these Boadiceas in hairnets,
On their way to a fight for equal pay, no matter what.
But we have to think about the trade union struggle as a whole.
Therefore, gentlemen, I ask you to consider these ladies' demands too much, too soon.
Monty Taylor, you two-faced, hypocritical toe-rag!
You fucking piece of...
Hang on.
No, you hang on!
Sorry, gentlemen.
Hey, we'll sort this out between ourselves later, eh?
Monty, I've seen more of their mugs on the front pages the past few weeks than you've managed in 20 years.
I wouldn't mind hearing from them.
Go on. Go on.
My best friend lost her husband recently.
He was...
He was a gunner in the 50 Squadron in the RAF.
Got shot down one time on a raid to Essen.
And even though he was badly injured, he managed to bail out.
I asked him why he joined the RAF and he said:
"Well, they got the best women, haven't they?"
Which they did.
And then he said, "Well, you gotta do something, haven't you?"
You had to do something.
That was a given.
Because it was a matter of principle.
You had to stand up, you had to do what was right.
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to look at yourself in the mirror.
When did that change, eh?
When did we, in this country, decide to stop fighting?
I don't think we ever did.
But you've gotta back us up.
You've gotta stand up with us.
We are the working classes.
The men and the women.
We're not separated by sex.
But only by those who are willing to accept injustice and those, like our friend George, who are prepared to go into battle for what is right.
And equal pay for women is right.
Thank you.
I never knew you could talk like that.
Scorch marks all the way up the curtains where Monty's arse caught fire.
Hello. Excuse me.
Gin.
I need to calm my nerves.
They might vote against us.
- How long we gotta wait?
- They said half an hour.
You know what we can do?
Stick it on Monty.
- Brilliant.
- You're a genius.
In that case, I'll have a double.
Babycham.
- Double gin.
- Eddie.
- Excuse me.
- What do you want, Rita?
Where's she gone?
Most probably needs some air.
Can we have Babycham?
I've come to say sorry.
I mean, I thought about what you said and you were right,
I suppose.
You are right.
And it's amazing what you've done, Rita O'Grady.
And I wanna back you.
See, I was gonna tell you that.
Only then when I come in and you were speaking and I heard you up there, and you was huge.
You was...
I don't know.
Like a force.
Then I thought
I'm not sure me backing you makes that much difference, to be honest.
Where you are now.
Anyway, go on, you go back to your meeting.
I'm gonna...
I should...
Eddie?
You've said some pretty stupid things in your time.
Of course you backing me makes a difference.
It makes all the difference in the world.
Very good, gentlemen.
The results of the vote are as follows:
Delegates in favor of support for the women machinists:
Seventy-nine.
Delegates against:
Forty-eight.
I declare the motion carried in favor of the Dagenham machinists.
Their bloody unions are back in line.
It's verbatim. Our man was there.
Well, well, well.
It really does seem time to call in Sir Jack.
Good. I'll do that, then.
I'll set up a court of inquiry which he can oversee and let's hope that does the trick.
Oh, yes. One more thing.
Set up a meeting, will you?
Minister?
With the machinists.
Their leaders.
Pardon me?
I want to meet them.
At the earliest opportunity.
But...
Yes?
The minister doesn't do that...
Never has done.
It'll just encourage them.
Give credence to their cause.
I am what is known as a fiery redhead.
Now, I hate to make this a matter of appearance and go all womanly on you, but there you have it.
And me standing up like this is, in fact, just that redheaded fieriness leaping to the fore.
Credence? I will give credence to their cause?
My God, their cause already has credence!
It is equal pay.
Equal pay is common justice and if you two weren't such a pair of egotistical, chauvinistic, bigoted dunderheads, you would realize that.
Oh, my office is run by incompetents.
And I am sick of being patronized, spoken down to and generally treated as if I was the May queen.
Set up the meeting!
Morning, Ed.
All right, Albert?
Yeah.
Now, listen. Listen to me.
Now, there's no reason to panic, Rita.
Okay.
Only, I've had a call from Barbara Castle's office.
Oh, my God.
Eddie.
What's happened now?
Barbara Castle wants to talk to me.
Well done.
Cheers.
The secretary of state is seeing the women?
On whose authority?
On her own, apparently. I gather
Mrs. Castle is quite a forceful woman.
Is she?
What are you doing?
I represent Ford. We are the biggest car manufacturer in the world.
We pump millions of pounds into the U.K. Economy.
I think it's time my bosses reminded one or two people of that fact.
Have you or have you not invited the Ford women to your offices?
Prime Minister...
I've just spent the last half-hour on the phone to Ford, reassuring him that my government isn't on the side of the strikers.
It isn't taking sides.
We have to grasp the nettle.
Now is not the time.
Ten years ago, you were adamant.
I wasn't running the country then.
See the women if that's what you want to do.
But whatever you do, do not upset Ford.
I've got enough trouble with the Americans as it is.
It's all right.
It's your missus I'm after. Is she in?
Rita? What are you doing here?
Rita?
I need a favor.
Come in.
Thanks.
Lisa?
What?
Come inside.
Everything all right?
Want a cup of tea?
Yeah.
Rita. Smile, please.
Over here, ladies.
Excuse me, gotta get through.
Do you think the strike will go on? How long?
Rita.
Wait a minute.
Hey, Connie.
Sorry I'm late.
You made it.
What if Mrs. Castle says "no deal"?
How will you cope?
Cope? How will we cope?
We're women. Now, don't ask such stupid questions.
Ladies, ladies.
Come up. This way, please.
Come on, this is it.
All right. See you later.
Stay back, please, gentlemen.
Follow me.
Mr. Tooley.
Madam Secretary.
I wasn't expecting you.
But you are meeting with the women.
I think it is time
I heard their argument, yes.
But if you would care to wait, I will inform you of any decisions we make.
I think we both want the same thing, Mrs.
Castle, you and I.
I think we wanna see Ford Motors employing British workers.
Ford is a vital part of our economy.
I am well aware of that.
Then don't make us build our cars elsewhere.
Help us hold the line here.
Support our efforts to combat these constant strikes which undermine our ability to build cars at a profit, which is why we're in business in the first place.
Otherwise, we will take our factories elsewhere.
Are you threatening me,
Mr. Tooley?
I'm trying to stop 40,000 people from losing their jobs, Mrs. Castle.
That's how many workers
Ford employs.
Not to mention tens of thousands of peripheral jobs sacrificed.
Now, I don't think that either one of us wants to take that risk, surely.
Look, look. Eileen and Monica.
I wonder if they can see us.
Get me the prime minister.
Yes. Put me through to Number 10.
Yes. Yes. Fine. Thank you.
I'm afraid he's on a plane.
Won't land until this evening.
Thanks for coming.
Connie, I'm so sorry.
No, don't.
It's me who needs to apologize.
Don't be silly.
The minister will see you now.
Here we go.
You all right?
Ready?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Mrs. O'Grady, I recognize you from the news.
Rita, please.
Rita.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well, and me, you.
Sorry. This is Connie.
Connie.
- How do you do?
- Brenda.
How do you do?
Sandra.
Well, I'm delighted you could all come. Please, take a seat.
Would you care for a sherry?
Be lovely, thank you.
Thank you.
You haven't got any whiskey, have you?
Here's a woman after my own heart.
Make that two.
Thank you.
Well, cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Now, I've been following your dispute very closely and I want to say how proud I am of the battle that you fought.
I fully support the struggle for equal pay and you will have it.
But in time.
What?
Industry'll object, the lords will kick up a fuss, the press will have a field day.
It's not going to be easy.
Well, what is what's worth fighting for?
Return to work.
Go back to your machines and you have my word
I will push forward with your fight.
No.
Mrs. O'Grady...
No, we need something solid.
Something now.
You've got the authority.
You know, we thought seeing you, we'd...
In politics, you sometimes have to play the long game...
We ain't politicians, we're working women.
And so are you.
Very well.
What would it take to get you back?
Excuse me?
The "something solid."
And mark well, I say something, not everything.
Well, we'd need...
We'd need a guarantee that we're gonna get equal pay.
And in the meantime, we need to move much closer to the male rate. Now. At Ford.
Seventy-five percent?
Ninety.
Ninety.
At least.
You're putting me in a very difficult position.
I wasn't too aggressive, was I?
No.
Mr. Tooley, that risk you were talking about?
I'm going to have to take it.
And from Whitehall we're getting news that talks between Mrs. Castle and the striking Ford machinists are nearing a conclusion.
And a statement is expected in the next few minutes.
Intense interest here...
Just a moment please, minister.
Yes, of course.
That's Biba, isn't it?
I saw that in a magazine.
Yeah. I have to give it back at the end of the day.
Is that C&A?
Yes.
Why pay more? That's what I say.
Well, exactly.
I've got the same one at home.
Have you really?
They're ready for you now, minister.
Girls?
Rita? Rita?
Ladies.
No, after you.
Oh, no, no.
After you.
Oh, gosh.
Come on, then. Thank you.
Rita, is it a positive result?
Now, ladies, can I help?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
I am delighted to announce that following our talks this afternoon, the 187 Ford machinists will be going back to work on the first of July.
They will receive an immediate pay rise of 7 pence an hour.
Which will put them at 92 percent of the male rate.
However... However, this is not all.
As a result of our discussion,
I can confirm that the government is in full support of the creation of an Equal Pay Act.
And by the autumn of this year,
I guarantee appropriate legislation to ensure that that act becomes law. Thank you.
Yeah!
More support from the back there.
To celebrate, they let us have the canteen, and we had a party.
I don't remember much of that.
No, I remember you didn't, no.
And I thought to myself, there is some of the old spirit that gave us the success of the suffragettes.
- We are on strike.
- All of you?
All of us. All us machinists, anyway.
So no car seat covers for Fords?
No, not from us, anyway.
You're still staying out?
Yeah.
You're not going back at all?
No.
Nobody expected us to come out on strike. Nobody.
What we're fighting for, we'll stay there until we get it.
Women don't make a habit of coming out on strike for nothing.
Well, we didn't think we were that strong.
We didn't think we would bring Fords to a standstill.
It was all down to us. Us ladies.
And we are ladies, whatever anybody else may say.
We are ladies.
Everybody out!
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
When you're burned,
you've got nothing --
no cash, no credit,
no job history.
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work
comes your way.
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate....
Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.
That's how we do it, people.
Bottom line --
as long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.
Listen to me, Michael.
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
You ordered him to!
Guys like you and me -- we know the ends justify the means.
- Mike, what'd you do?
- I did what I had to, Sam.
Fi, how we looking?
There's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy hitter seems to be running the show.
It just became my mission in life to put you behind bars.
All of you.
Pretty flowers.
I didn't bring them.
A friend of Nate's must have come by earlier.
A friend.
Are we friends now, Bly?
Olivia Riley is coming for you.
Your actions have put her reputation on the line.
At this point, she doesn't care who she has to hurt to get to you.
Sam, you all right?
Mike, you made me a promise.
You swear to me that you're gonna make this right.
I swear to you
I'll make this right, Sam.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Sam!
Sam?
Sam!
Sam?
Sam!
In any kind
of emergency situation,
an operative's greatest enemy
is panic.
The spike of adrenaline,
the increased blood pressure,
and the loss
of any sense of time
can make it impossible
to think clearly --
at exactly the time
you need a clear head the most.
In those moments,
it takes all your training,
all your willpower to pull
yourself back from the brink.
Jed, it's Fiona.
We're on our way.
Look, I don't care who's there.
We're coming.
Get ready.
Come on. Sam?!
I can't wake him up, Fi.
We'll be at Jed's in two minutes.
Go, Fi! Go!
Fiona, I am in the middle of a party.
Party's over.
My friend needs help.
Are you freaking kidding me?
He's dying.
No, he's not dying.
You're not gonna let him die.
Everyone out!
Okay, no.
I want him out of here.
I am serious!
I'm more serious.
Okay.
Okay, come on.
That's it.
Here. Let me just -- let me get this.
Not the...pool table.
Okay, this -- this doesn't look good.
I-is the bullet still in there?
Yeah, 9mm, close range through a car door.
Through a car door, sure.
Okay, he's got internal bleeding.
The round is probably lodged up against his spleen.
Get it out!
Okay, does this look like a surgery theater to you, Fiona?
I have a little medical bag to stitch minor wounds and pull splinters.
I don't do full-on procedures in my house.
Well, you do today.
What do you need?
He's lost a lot of blood.
He's gonna need a transfusion.
I'll take care of that.
In an emergency,
a blood transfusion can be
as simple as running a tube
between the major blood vessels
of two compatible donors
and letting gravity
do the rest.
Emergency surgery
is a little more difficult.
Often, the most you can do
is sterilize
whatever tools
you have on hand,
keep the wound clean,
and hope for the best.
Okay, now I just got to put that...
Wait a minute.
What -- what is it?
I am not getting a pulse.
We're losing him.
Well, why aren't you doing anything?
I-I am doing something.
I'm holding in his spleen.
He needs CPR now.
Wait. Hold on.
Stop, stop, stop!
He's breathing again.
You did it.
You did good there.

In many ways, it's easier
to function during combat
than after.
In a fight,
there's always something to do,
something to focus on.
Later, when you're dealing
with the consequences,
the only thing you can do
is wait and hope.
Hey, Mike.
You look worse than me.
Sam.
Oh, it's good to hear your voice again.
Christ. Was it that bad?
Yeah.
It was all kind of a blur getting here.
I had this vague memory that...
Fi gave me mouth-to-mouth?
Did that happen?
Yeah.
You get pictures?
I guess I forgot.
It was a little hectic.
Yeah.
Where the hell are we?
We're at a doctor friend of Fiona's.
We brought you here after you passed out.
How's your mom and Jesse?
They'll be here soon.
We're gonna stay here as long as we need.
No. Mike, man, come on.
You guys should just go, okay?
Get out of town.
I mean, obviously, I'm in no shape to be on the run, so you're gonna be much better off if you --
It's not gonna happen,
Sam.
Mike, you know damn well as well as I do --
Sam, you are gonna rest or I'm gonna give you something to make you rest.
You're a stubborn son of a bitch, Mike.
You were supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.
Yeah, we were picking up some new wheels, and someone was dragging her feet a little bit, wasn't she?
Oh, excuse me for not being wild about going on a car-theft spree.
How's Sam?
Well, we stopped the bleeding and closed him up.
He's stable.
Good. That's something.
For a second there,
I was thinking something
I didn't want to be thinking.
Should we just, uh, put our stuff in here or what?
No!
No, no, no, no.
You -- you can't put your things anywhere.
Fiona, who are these people?
My friends.
Oh.
Well, this is my house, and these are not my friends.
Well, that's unfortunate because that makes you my enemy.
You're not my enemy, are you?
Whatever.
This is gonna cost you extra.
A lot extra.
Put it on my tab.
Love the new landlord.
So, what's the plan now?
We're working on it.
You might want to get comfortable.
We're gonna be here a while.
There's a reason most people
don't sleep well in new places.
The brain goes on alert
in unfamiliar environments,
sensitive to possible dangers.
Add some very real dangers,
and the chances are low that
you'll get any shut-eye at all.
Mom.
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to sneak up on people?
Sorry. I was just checking on everyone.
Couldn't sleep either, huh?
Not really.
I've been trying to figure out what to do.
Sam's too sick to travel, and Riley's gonna find this place eventually.
We can't stay here and we can't leave.
Now you know what life with your father was like.
How did you deal with it?
I made a choice and I lived with the consequences.
We all did.
I can't do that.
I know you can't.
Your father couldn't do it, either.
Once he saw something he wanted both ways, he'd just do whatever he damn well had to do to have it both ways.
Usually, it was the rest of us who paid the price.
But he was a genius at it.
You got that from him, honey.
You'll figure something out.
I'm gonna go check on the others. You okay, Mom?
Yeah, I'll try and get some sleep now that damn dog stopped barking.
Dog?
Yeah. The neighbor's dog's been yapping.
Finally, it shut up.
Wasn't the clock just on?
Michael, what's going on?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Someone cut the power.
Hide behind the desk, don't move.
Do it.
Modern night-vision goggles
provide visibility
in near total darkness,
adapt to
changing light conditions,
and provide better contrast
and resolution
than the human eye,
which is why most assassins
aren't just confident
in the dark, they prefer it.
As good as they are, though,
night-vision goggles still have
a significant weakness.
They make it easier
to see what's in front of you
but tough to see what's
coming at you from the side.
Mike?
Mike, you okay?
Mike.
Yep. Great. Thanks.
Who are they?
I don't know, but...
It sounds like they didn't come alone.
Oh, great.
You sure you're good?
Yeah.
Yeah, they're out there.
Shooting at them's gonna be a problem.
I can barely see them.
I can help you with that.
When fighting at night,
attackers usually
have the upper hand.
They know where the defenders
are and can fight from cover,
concealing
their position and number.
You ready?
Yeah.
The best defense
is to even the playing field
by taking away the darkness.
In the army, that means
M224 illumination mortars,
but if you're
short on heavy artillery,
a flaming quart of scotch
will work, too.
They're running.
They're running.
All right, we're all clear.
We won't be for long.
Why?
I took a look at the bodies.
This is a cartel tattoo.
Cartel? Why --
The same cartel we went after earlier this year...
For the CIA.
What are you saying?
Someone sent these guys.
They knew our names, photos.
They had high-res satellite images -- government images.
Riley?
She couldn't get us, so she gave the job to a cartel who wanted me dead.
Nice and clean.
A CIA officer sends a drug cartel after us?
Yeah.
So she's gone from capturing us to killing us.
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do.
We take the fight to her.
It looks like we're clear.
Yeah, for now.
They're gonna start checking the motels sooner or later.
That's why we have to move first.
Yeah, about that plan.
If Riley's really coming after us with a cartel kill squad, shouldn't we be trying to stay, like, as far away as possible?
The fact that she's using them is the best weapon we have.
If we can get her caught --
That's a big "if."
We can't just all waltz into a police station right now.
Who will listen to us?
Jason Bly.
Bly? Michael, are you crazy?
He wants to arrest you.
I know.
But he's the only potential ally we have.
He knows Tom Card was dirty and he has a thing about CIA officers breaking the rules.
Well, he's not just gonna take our word for it.
We're gonna need some evidence.
How are we gonna manage that?
Use me.
No, Sam.
You're in no condition.
This can work.
Riley knows that I'm hurt, so she's gonna be watching the hospitals to see if I turn up.
You drop me there.
You scram when she shows.
Fi and Jesse can plant a bug and a tracker on her car.
How do we know she's gonna go back to the cartel, Sam?
Well, I'm just gonna have to rattle her cage enough to make sure she does.
I mean, she's already losing it, clearly, so it shouldn't take much.
In the meantime,
I can see a real doctor, which would be good because, you know, I got shot.
But if it doesn't work, Sam,
Riley would have --
Mike, if this doesn't work, we're all screwed.
No, Sam.
I can't allow it.
You can't allow it?
I thought this was a team, not a dictatorship.
You heard any better ideas?
He's got a point,
Michael.
Damn right I do.
Call Bly, Mike, set the meeting.
When you're being hunted,
it's a good idea
not to go to meetings
at the scheduled
time and place.
Often, the best approach
is to show up
before your contact
has even left for the meeting.
Nice ride.
Come on, man.
So I'm guessing we're not meeting in Hialeah.
I thought
I'd save you the trouble.
Gas mileage in a Crown Vic has got to be brutal.
I'm getting the sense that you don't trust me.
I'm not trusting many people these days.
But if it's any consolation,
I trust you more than most.
Aww.
I assume we're negotiating the terms of your surrender here then?
Actually, I want to talk about something else.
No, no, no. Sorry, Westen.
There's nothing else to talk about.
Bly, listen to me. Please!
Riley has gone rogue in a serious way.
She sent a hit team after us.
She's working with a drug cartel.
I'm aware that she's been playing it fast and loose, but a drug cartel?
That's a serious accusation.
I'm supposed to take your word for this?
No. But you can see it with your own eyes.
I'm putting a plan in place.
You interested?
We had a deal -- you surrender, you help with my investigation into this Tom Card mess.
Card is dead, Bly!
You want to waste time investigating a corpse
or going after someone who's selling out the Agency as we speak?
Okay, fine.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.
Hey,
I'm interested to know -- what happens if your plan doesn't work?
If it doesn't work, it's probably 'cause I'm dead.
You all right?
Well, I just had a bullet plucked out of me yesterday, so I think I'm doing pretty well considering.
So, uh, what do we do here?
Pick a number or what?
No, you have a hole in your side.
You go right to the front of the line.
May I help you?
Hey, sweetheart. How you doing?
I guess
I need to see a doctor.
What's the nature of your injury?
He was shot.
Yeah. I was cleaning a gun, and it went off.
It was the damndest thing.
I'll go get a doctor.
Good idea.
So, Mike, you sure you want to be here when this goes down?
This plan only works if Riley sees me here.
Plus, you need a doctor.
I need a good mojito.
That's what I need.
Well, you're out of luck.
I overheard an orderly saying they're fresh out of mint.
Damn, Mike.
This reminds me of Kuwait.
You remember that?
Lugging you for 6 miles in a sandstorm?
It's hard to forget.
Yeah, well,
I'll never forget it, either.
Dr. Ryan to pediatrics.
Come on.
All right, this is it, Sam.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine, buddy.
I got the easy job.
I get to lie in a bed.
You get the big part.
So, listen, Mike, you promised me that you would make this right.
Don't let me down.
Okay, boys. All right.
Get him to examination bay 1.
"Examination bay" --
I like the sound of that.
Sir, you can wait here.
For a fugitive,
getting medical attention
is a big risk.
Doctors have to notify the
police of all gunshot wounds,
fake names are flagged
by insurance computers,
and hospital security is often
hooked into law enforcement.
All of which is bad if you're
trying to stay off the grid
but perfect if you want to
attract some attention.
Hey, Fi. How's it going?
We're in the van out front keeping an eye on things.
The parking lot just got more crowded.
Do we have a visual on Riley?
Yeah, your other girlfriend has arrived.
Got another CIA vehicle, about half a dozen guys, and local police, too.
That's why the security guard decided it was a good idea to hang out at the front entrance.
Are they coming in now?
No, not yet, but it won't be long.
Look, Mike, we're gonna need a lot of eyes looking the other way if we're gonna make it to Riley's car.
So whatever you do, make it spectacular, man.
That's what I was planning on.
Wish me luck.
Excuse me, sir.
I need to speak with you for a moment.
Sir! Suspect is fleeing!
Suspect is fleeing!
Move! Get out of the way!
Suspect's on the southeast side of the building.
All right.
That's your cue.
You sure you don't need help?
Yeah, I got this.
Escaping a larger force
is about limiting
your pursuer's options.
Using a narrow path takes their
vehicles out of the equation,
but if you have time to set
your escape route beforehand,
the best way to win a foot
chase is on two wheels.
Westen's trying to escape on a motorcycle in the back of the building.
Go, go, go!
Westen!
Move, move!
Son of a bitch!
Mr. Axe.
Good to see you again.
Morphine drip.
Wow. You must be in a lot of pain.
Some.
I've had worse hangovers.
Don't worry.
This won't take long.
I only have one question for you.
Well, then I guess we're both out of luck,
'cause I got zero answers for your one question.
Is that right?
See, because I think you're gonna tell me how to find Michael Westen.
Oh, yeah?
Why do you think that?
Well, I'll tell you,
Mr. Axe.
I'm replacing your painkiller with a mild stimulant.
This should keep you awake, thinking about my questions.
Unfortunately, it also increases your sensitivity to pain...
A lot.
Doesn't matter.
I got nothing to say.
We'll see how you feel after a few hours without pain meds.
Anyway, we got enough information from the things we found on you to start a search, so...
Oh, hey, uh, before you go,
I do have one thing to say.
I'm all ears.
You know,
I was slowing Mike down.
I'm not anymore.
You took the gloves off, sister.
You called in a hit on his mom.
So you don't have to worry about finding Michael Westen.
'Cause he's gonna find you.
And when he does, he is gonna end this.
Well...we'll see about that,
Mr. Axe.
Oh, God.
Oh, son of a bitch.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
We're doing surveillance on a CIA officer.
I liked it better when the plan was to go...
Get away from this.
Well, at least the hard part's over, Fi.
Yeah, I wish
I could believe that.
Riley's on the move.
And she is not a happy lady.
Here.
It's me. We need to
move our appointment up.
This thing
is getting way out of hand.
Just meet me.
I'm not talking about this over the phone.
3:00 p.m.
Whatever Sam said to her worked.
She moves fast.
- Michael?
- Yeah, Fi?
It looks like Riley's gonna meet her cartel friends.
Time for your show-and-tell.
I'll see you there.
In general,
spies are more involved
in gathering intelligence
than gathering evidence.
Espionage methods are generally
not approved by police
or admissible in court.
So when it comes
to getting someone arrested,
your job is
to get the ball up the field
before handing it off
to someone who's in a position
to put it in the end zone.
You dragged me all the way out here for this?
Fi and Jesse tracked her here across three counties.
Oh, yeah?
Where are they at now?
In the trees on the other side of the dock, covering the marina.
Are they here to protect you from her or from me?
Who says it can't be both?
It's an awful lot of trouble to watch a woman stroll along the water.
A woman who doubled back and checked for tails all the way here.
It's suspicious.
That's not enough.
You promised me Riley in personal contact with the cartel.
You'll have it.
And if I don't?
If this mystery contact doesn't show?
Do I get to bring you in as a consolation prize?
Hey, you guys in place?
Yeah, we're here.
Good, 'cause there's a big-ass yacht coming in.
Looks like this party's about to get started.
They're here. You ready?
Why are you here?
The plan was no more meetings.
Yeah, well, the plan changed the minute your boys got their asses handed to them by Michael Westen.
Hey, those were some of my best sicarios.
Then get some better ones and twice as many!
Listen, you want a pass from the CIA?
You want help with the D.E.A.?
Then you better start holding up your end of the bargain, and that means
Westen's head on a plate.
Westen.
He got lucky once.
It will not happen again.
Was -- was that worth the trip?
I have a lead on his location.
One of his friends just checked into a hospital.
I have a motel key and some calls we pulled on his cellphone.
Good.
Come aboard.
We'll find Westen and we will finish this.
Unbelievable.
Selling out the CIA and the D.E.A. to a drug cartel?
This is the kind of thing that ends up in a congressional hearing.
And the key witness at that hearing?
Let's just say someone's future got a little brighter.
Nice job, Westen.
Listen, Bly, for what it's worth, I appreciate it.
All right, all right.
Just don't get too gushy on me.
Bly, marina security is here.
We should probably move.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Oh, just wondering what you're doing here.
We've had some vandalism in the area recently, and I need to check on everybody who --
Agent Bly, CSS.
We're part of a law-enforcement operation that's in progress.
Yeah, w-what kind of operation?
It's classified, I'm afraid, which is why we'd appreciate it if you kept this quiet, if you don't mind.
Oh, sure. Sure thing.
Sorry about that...Officer?
Close enough.
Bly, the security guard's with the cartel.
What? What are you talking about?
Grenade!
What the hell was that?
Oh, God.
Fi, no, no, no. You can't.
There's too many of them!
We got to figure out what's going on.
You want to tell me what the hell just happened?
I'll handle it.
Hey, it's me.
Michael, what just happened?
The marina security guard was working with the cartel.
It's bad.
The evidence -- it's all gone.
And, Fi...Bly's dead.
Oh, Michael.
I thought you...
I was right there with her, man.
I thought we were leaving without you.
I'm fine.
You think we can get to the road this way?
Yeah, if we're gonna go, we better go.
Mike, seriously, we got to go.
No.
All the evidence we had on Riley just burned up in that car.
If we leave empty-handed, she gets a free pass on all of this.
Michael, what are you talking about?
One man is already dead.
We're outnumbered.
We're outgunned.
There's nothing we can do.
No, we have to deal with Riley now, otherwise Bly just died for nothing.
And our best chance is while she's still here.
Now, if I can make it over to the seawall,
I can make it onto that boat.
You want to get onto the boat, that boat?
The boat that belongs to the people that's trying to kill us.
What -- what are you gonna do when you get there?
I promised Sam
I would make this right.
Now, you can go back to the car and you can leave, but I have to stay here and do this.
You're gonna need help getting to that boat in one piece.
All right, we'll lay down some cover fire as a distraction.
Just make it quick.
We're gonna be ducking some serious bullets over here.
Okay, I don't know what Mike has planned, but it better happen quick.
We won't be able to hold out here.
Just give him time.
If we stick around and whatever he's planning doesn't work...
It will work. It has to.
Why are we moving?
I can't be on a cartel boat in open water.
I'm almost out of ammo, and those guys are getting closer.
They stopped.
What?
The boat's leaving.
The boat's leaving.
Remind me -- is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I have no idea.
W-wait here, señora Riley.
Everything is under control, okay?
Armando, get --
Yeah, I wouldn't.
Drop it, Westen.
I don't think so.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
Who this boat belongs to?
I know exactly who this boat belongs to.
Then you're not as smart as I thought you were.
The cartel already wants me dead.
I don't think this will make much of a difference.
What about the Coast Guard?
It looks like they're on their way to meet us.
Yeah, I know.
I called them.
I told them about a well-armed drug boat in their waters.
They were very, very interested.
Most people
don't think of the Coast Guard
as being
particularly well-armed.
Most people are wrong.
A Coast Guard patrol boat
is armed with two
.50-caliber machine guns
and a 25-millimeter cannon,
which means it can take out
anything short of a battleship.
Motor vessel Zazu, this is the U.S. Coast Guard off your port beam.
Heave to and stop your vessel.
I repeat -- this is the U.S. Coast --
What are you doing?
You realize if you ignore them, they're gonna fire on us?
I'm counting on it.
Are you crazy?
You're the reason we're on this boat, Riley.
You're the one who sent the cartel hit squad after me.
We finish this today one way or another.
So you want me to call and confess.
Is that what this is?
Fine.
You win, Westen.
You got me.
Just call them off, and I'll come clean.
No, you'll talk your way out of a confession as fast as you make one.
If you're as good as I think you are, you made arrangements to make it look like
I was the one working with the cartel.
You falsified accounts in my name.
You made up communication logs.
You spun a web of lies to cover your ass.
If the Agency found out about that, that's something you couldn't explain and that's what
I want you to give them.
That's ridiculous.
I never did anything.
I bet both of our lives you did.
It's really the smart play.
I mean, it's a great plan, but it only works if I'm dead.
It still might work, but you will die with me.
Now, that was a warning shot, and you know the Coast Guard.
They're not very patient with situations like this.
I'm getting nothing on the radio.
Attention, motor vessel Zazu,
stop your engines immediately or we will be forced to use destructive fire.
Let's get their attention.
Mount 2-1, report when you have them on target and tracking.
On target and tracking!
Battery's released.
Commence fire.
I think it's time to make that call.
Are you really gonna go through with this?
You're gonna kill us both?
My friends have suffered enough.
It ends today.
No matter what the cost.
Well, you know what,
Westen?
I got a bit of bad news for you.
This little idea you have about who you think I am, what you think I would do, it's a fantasy.
It's a creation of your own twisted mind.
Then I guess we have nothing more to talk about.
They're increasing speed.
Mount 2-1, load 100 rounds of high explosives and stand by to engage.
I'm not taking chances.
Locked in and ready to fire on command.
Attention, motor vessel Zazu, stop your vessel immediately or we will fire on you.
You have five seconds to comply.
All right, I'll call!
Just call them off!
Coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is motor vessel Zazu.
Captain, I think they're trying to hail us.
Gunnery station, stand down.
Cease fire!
Motor vessel Zazu,
slow to 5 knots on a down swell and prepare leave for my boarding team to embark.
Do you copy?
Copy loud and clear.
We'll be right out.
We just need to make a phone call.
Yes, it's Olivia Riley.
Give me the Deputy Chief.
When something goes wrong
in the intelligence world --
a scandal, a security breach,
or just a failed operation --
there's always a debriefing
where the facts are sorted out.
When those facts threaten
careers and institutions,
no one takes any chances.
You're locked away
until the process is over.
All you can do
is tell your side of the story
and hope for the best and know
that no matter what you do,
your fate
lies in someone else's hands.
Miss Glenanne, come with me, please.
More questions?
I told them everything there is to know.
We've been here three weeks.
We turned ourselves in peacefully.
How long does it take to "sort out what happened"?
Ma'am.
Where's Michael?
Give us a minute.
You all right?
Yeah.
What are they...
They'll be released shortly.
I just wanted to talk to you first.
Michael, where have you been?
They've been debriefing us this whole time, asking about
Riley and Tom Card.
They were doing the same to me.
Really?
It doesn't look like the same.
I've been in a 10'x10' holding cell.
You're riding in helicopters, ordering around CIA officers.
What's going on?
Michael, we were gonna get out.
In Panama, you said that we were done with all this.
You said it would just be us.
I needed to protect you.
I needed to protect all of us.
Michael, what have you done?
I couldn't leave you in there forever.
They weren't just gonna forget everything that happened and release you.
So I made a deal.
I did what I --
What you had to do.
No, Michael.
You did what you wanted to do.
No.
No, no.

This is the story of a film
that was never completed.
A film designed to serve
as propaganda for the Third Reich,
that empire infatuated with a camera...
that knew so well
to document its own evil...
passionately, systematically...
like no other nation before it.
A full decade after the end of the war,
East German archivists
began for the first time...
to sort through what remained
of Hitler's propaganda machine.
Thousands of films discovered in the exact
location in which they had been stashed.
A concrete vault hidden in a forest.
It is also there that one lone copy
of a film was found.
Over one hour long, with no soundtrack,
no opening or closing credits.
Only a brief title:
The Ghetto.
It was a rough first draft...
of the longest Nazi propaganda film
ever shot inside the Warsaw Ghetto,
the largest of the Jewish ghettos
established by the Nazis in occupied Roland.
The silent footage juxtaposes
meticulously staged scenes...
in which Jews are shown
enjoying a life of luxury in the Ghetto...
with images that required
no staging at all.
Why was the film crew
sent to film the Ghetto...
shortly before it would be wiped out?
And why was work on the film
cut short in the early stages of editing?
In the absence of
a final version of the film,
the intention of the propagandists
can never be determined.
One can only surmise.
Ironically, after the war,
this film commissioned by the Nazis...
turned into a trustworthy document
for any filmmaker or museum...
seeking to show what really happened...
to tell the untellable.
The cinematic deception was forgotten,
and the black-and-white images were
engraved in memory as historical truth.
From the frenzy of propaganda,
the images alone remain,
concealing many layers of reality.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
Two and a half years have passed
since the Ghetto was established.
And in three months, many of those
we see here will be sent to their death.
Here are images in which these people
are still fighting for their lives.
What the film doesn't tell is that nearly
half a million Jews were trapped here...
in a walled-in area
of less than three square miles,
in conditions
of unparalleled overcrowding,
plagued by hunger and typhus.
The Ghetto housed not only
the many Jews of Warsaw,
but also thousands of Jewish refugees...
deported from all corners of the Reich,
with no possessions, no language,
no chance to survive.
Those who were caught smuggling
food or attempting to escape...
were immediately captured and shot.
And, as in every other ghetto, here, too,
the Nazis had set up a Judenrat...
a Jewish council...
appointing as its head Adam Czerniakow,
whose job was to manage
for them from inside...
what had essentially become the holding
pen before the final destination.
As he fought a losing battle
to save all he possibly could,
Czerniakow insisted on documenting
the events of his life...
day by day, with urgency,
in nine diary notebooks.
And even as time was running out,
he made a point of writing extensively
about the shooting of this film...
and of his part in it...
an actor playing himself,
unaware how his role will end.
May 3, 1942...
At 10 a.m. The propaganda crew arrived.
They started to take
pictures in my office.
First, they staged a scene of rabbis
and petitioners entering my office, etc.
Then they removed
all the paintings and charts...
and brought in a nine-armed
candlestick with all the candles lit.
May 7, 1942...
On the streets, they are filming Jews.
Oh God!
What if I see someone I know?
I keep thinking that among all these people,
I might see my mother walking.
Leszno, the main street, was full of traffic.
I remember that once they filmed people.
Germans would often show up, usually for unpleasant reasons and usually shooting.
So, when they were filming, it was much more positive.
Anyhow, it was never good news when Germans showed up.
By this time in the Ghetto,
I was independent.
I was already 8 or 9 years old.
My mother let me play in the courtyard, and I went to all sorts of places by myself.
So, yes, I saw them filming.
They filmed beggars and all sorts of passersby.
At the time, I didn't realize that they had deliberate intentions.
But of course they did.
May 14, 1942...
The film crew is still
very much in evidence.
They are filming both the luxury
and the extreme poverty.
When I returned home at 4 o'clock,
I found uniformed filmmakers, etc.
They decided to film in our apartment.
I requested that a couple
be engaged as actors.
They placed a sign on the door
with something written on it.
Two women and a male "lover"
were brought to the apartment...
and they started filming.
In the meantime,
an old Jew with a Vandyke beard...
was seized on the street.
He sat in my apartment for hours,
but his photogenic qualities
were not used.
I can imagine what happened
when he returned home...
and tried to tell his wife
that he had earned nothing...
while waiting for three hours
to be a "star."
I wonder whether I will ever meet you,
my professional colleague.
Did we not both miss our destiny?
What on earth?
Where did one ever see a flower?
We would have eaten the flower.
Who could stay in their private apartment... with their furniture and their teapot? Who?
Only the privileged, like Czerniakow.
Jewish families weren't allowed to live in more than one room.
So, we took all the belongings we still had... and squeezed into one room.
At the same time, a family we had never met before... suddenly took over my parents' bedroom.
When they reduced the area of the Ghetto, we got expelled from our home, and we had to find a new place to live within two days.
We found a place and started to take our belongings there.
We were given a room and a kitchen.
And my father hired a man who had a cart with no horse.
Once, as we were pushing the cart... loaded with our possessions back and forth, we saw them filming near "Femina."
When we realized that we were in their way, my father got scared and let go of the reins.
The German jumped on him and beat him... until he fell down and the cart rolled away.
I started screaming like crazy.
My father was lying on the ground.
"Stop screaming," he said,
"or they'll beat you too!"
I put my hand over my mouth and stopped screaming, and the Germans left us alone and continued filming.
I looked up and saw two men... standing by a camera tripod.
They were filming outside.
The Ghetto was not a comfortable
work environment...
for the S.S. Officers who carried out
its step-by-step destruction.
They set up their headquarters
outside the Ghetto walls,
in the Brühl Palace,
located in the Aryan part of Warsaw.
In May 1942, their commander was the young
Kommissar S.S. Officer Heinz Auerswald,
who submitted to his superiors
weekly reports.
He described the developments
in the Ghetto,
including executions
he himself had ordered,
in the passive voice,
as though these things
happened by themselves.
Weekly Report, May 5, 1942:
The filming currently underway
in the Ghetto continues,
despite the lack of cooperation
by the inhabitants.
During the filming in the Ghetto,
there was an upheaval
in the Jewish prison.
When the film crew showed up...
with representatives
of the Jewish Council,
panic broke out among the prisoners.
Those imprisoned for leaving
the Ghetto illegally were convinced...
that they were about to be executed.
Women and children fainted.
Everyone calmed down...
only after the real purpose
of the visit became clear.
May 19, 1942...
Waiting for Auerswald's
phone call about the film.
In the afternoon,
a hall was prepared for filming...
where a ball with champagne
is to be held tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
"The Ladies"are to wear evening dresses.
A messenger arrived
with instructions...
that I am to play the role of the host.
I called Auerswald,
who forbade me to perform.
He said that I should be
at the community center at 7:30,
as something might still change.
This means that the matter
has not yet been settled.
Will I have the strength to acquit
myself honorably from this affair?
Later I saw a hearse full of flowers...
taken from the cemetery
to the ballroom.
The city is full of rumors
about deportations.
They are talking
about tens of thousands.
Purposeful work under such
conditions is admirable,
and yet we do it every day.
For years, researchers tried to discover
who had made this film,
but none of the files...
not one of the documents they uncovered...
could solve the mystery.
Only later, in the 1960s, a lead was
discovered in the Warsaw City Archives.
It was a German entry permit
to the Ghetto,
issued at the time
of the shooting of the film.
A single document that disclosed one name:
Willy Wist,
along with his profession: Cameraman.
Willy Wist, who gave up filming
right after the war...
and became a scrap-metal merchant,
took great pains to cover his tracks,
burning copies of films
he had shot during the war.
Of all those involved,
he was the only one to be exposed.
Years later, when the German courts began
to prosecute local war criminals,
including the lawyer, former S.S.
Kommissar of the Warsaw Ghetto,
Heinz Auerswald, Wist was
among those called on to testify.
Court transcripts record exactly
what he was asked and what he replied,
providing for the first time a point
of view of the man behind the camera.
Herr Wist, the court would like to know... whether you were ever assigned to the Warsaw Ghetto during the war.
Yes.
In 1942, I was sent there from Berlin with three other reporters, cameramen and photographers.
We were stationed in Warsaw.
I worked there as a cameraman.
When exactly was this?
Probably in the winter of'41 -'42.
Herr Wist, allow me to refresh your memory.
This is your entry permit to Warsaw.
It is probably true that I was in Warsaw in May 1942.
I most likely said winter because...
I remember being in Warsaw... when nature was still hibernating.
Did you or your colleagues have any idea... what awaited you in the Warsaw Ghetto?
On our way to Warsaw, we cameramen... had no idea what awaited us there.
Like many times before, we were simply told curtly that we should film there.
I clearly remember filming trade on the streets.
We also filmed... street scenes... and overcrowded houses.
In this context,
I remember being told to film... a large pile of feces in the courtyard of one of the buildings.
I remember thinking to myself... that either because of the winter... or because of the overcrowding, the sanitary installations had stopped working.
Do you see the garbage?
People would throw their garbage out of their windows... because they were too weak to go downstairs.
Hungry people become apathetic.
They don't care anymore.
The piles of garbage are real.
I was ten years old at the time.
I was actually the dominant figure of my family.
Mother would send me to the Warsaw municipal garbage dump, and when I'd return home,
I saw how they were eating what I had brought.
May 5, 1942...
In the afternoon,
the filmmakers were busy...
in the bedroom of Zabludowsky's neighbors.
They brought in a woman who had
to put on lipstick in front of a mirror.
In addition to all this, there are
persistent rumors about deportations,
which appear not to be unfounded.
Kommissar Auerswald ordered us
to provide a contingent of 900 people...
to leave tomorrow for an unknown camp.
Have you met the Kommissar in charge of the Jewish quarter, Dr. Auerswald?
I am not familiar with this name.
I had nothing to do with his department.
Herr Wist, could you tell us, to the best of your knowledge, whether the purpose of the film was ever mentioned?
I never knew what the purpose of the films we shot was.
However, it was absolutely clear to me that they were intended for propaganda, particularly because we were focusing on the extreme differences... between the rich and the poor Jews
Oy, I remember that woman.
She used to walk around with her baby in her arms, screaming, and asking for a piece of bread.
I was 13 years old.
I used to smuggle Kosher meat into the Warsaw Ghetto... by tram, through houses near the Ghetto borders, through holes in the wall.
I was always on the move, so I saw everything that was going on.
They filmed all the time.
For example, they brought geese to the market... to prove that Jews were living in reasonable conditions.
This is horse meat.
Not everyone could afford it.
People who had goods or money... were able to buy food up until the very end, albeit at exorbitant prices.
There were 20, or possibly 50 people... who could afford it.
However, most people had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, or to heat with because they had sold everything.
They were waiting to die.
People from respectable families... would take their loved ones, who had died, out to the pavement.
In the morning, you woke up to find a corpse every 100 meters.
I was 18 years old and I worked at the post office.
One day I was walking on Leszno Street... when, suddenly, a big jeep with Germans in it... pulled up next to the café.
A young woman was lying next to the café.
Sixty years later, I still remember... what she looked like, though not her face.
I could see exactly what they were doing.
They didn't touch anyone.
They filmed the cafe and the woman and they laughed.
She was a young woman.
By then it was obvious who was starving.
You could see it on their faces.
Financial Report:
During March 1942,
the following were brought in:
2. 18 kgs flour per head,
0. 199 kg sugar
(white and yellow) per head,
1/5 egg per head,
0.93 kg fresh vegetables per head,
0.077 kg salt (white and grey) per head.
Since 1/5th of an egg per month
amounts to only 2.4 eggs per year,
it is evident that the population
resorts to free trade...
in order to ensure
a minimum level of nourishment.
Smuggling along the Ghetto walls
has been greatly reduced lately.
A number of Jews
caught smuggling were shot,
as a consequence,
the smuggling was reduced.
This is Rubinstein! For heaven's sake!
"Alle gleich," everyone's equal, he used to yell.
Do you see how people were lying on the street?
People lived here.
They lived here until they died.
What's the point of showing this?
To show contrasts? There were many contrasts in the Ghetto.
Many people kept clean and preserved their dignity.
We used to shower and brush our teeth every day.
Our mother took good care of us, even though the conditions were impossible.
People who are not starving to death... don't surrender their humanity.
People made jokes in the Ghetto and laughed.
Sometimes we would even sing.
People did what they could.
That was the tremendous contrast... and paradox that the Germans had created.
Herr Wist, were you aware of the restlessness among the Jews.. when the camera crews showed up accompanied by the S. S?
On the one hand, I was unable to have much contact with the Jews.. because the S.S. Immediately pushed them away.
On the other hand, they brought us Jews... they deemed appropriate for filming.
I do not know which department these S.S. Men belonged to... or who their commander was.
I'd like to point out that the Jews were frightened of the S.S.
There were no incidents during the filming.
While the Nazis recorded
their own version of history,
Jews were risking their lives
by creating in secret...
their own chronicle of life in the Ghetto,
using pen and paper instead of a camera.
Historian Emanuel Ringelblum,
courageous enough at the war's outset
to predict how it would end,
had begun organizing
a vast underground archive,
documenting the daily struggle
and annihilation...
of one of Europe's largest
Jewish communities.
Recognizing that a scholarly narrative
could never capture...
the many facets of this tragedy,
he called on anyone capable of resistance
to keep a personal journal.
Right up to his final days
in his place of hiding,
he carried out the task of compiling
dozens of individual voices...
into a multilayered portrait...
the final portrait.
Everyone wrote: Journalists, writers,
teachers, public figures,
the young and even children.
Everyone was aware of the value
of the work being done...
and its importance for future generations.
Our guiding principle was
that the work should be multifaceted.
Our second principle was objectivity.
We aspired to present the whole truth,
as bitter as it may be.
Some of my friends who know
about my secret diary...
have suggested that, given their
despair, I should stop writing.
"Why are you doing this? What for?
Will you ever publish it?
"Will your words ever reach the ears
of future generations?"
Nevertheless, I don't listen to them.
I feel that continuing the diary...
until I am no longer physically
and emotionally capable...
is a historical mission
that must not be underestimated.
My powers of creation
have not yet been silenced,
even though I haven't eaten
anything in five days.
They continue filming everything
inside the Ghetto.
All the scenes are being staged.
On Smocza Street,
they assembled a crowd of Jews..
and ordered the Jewish policemen
to disperse them.
To achieve a more "natural"effect,
guns were fired in the air
to induce people to flee in panic.
Forty-five years passed
from the moment...
the unfinished propaganda
film was discovered...
until chance revealed another film reel,
containing outtakes...
frames from the raw footage
left on the cutting-room floor.
Images that were never meant to be seen...
now revealed repeated attempts
to stage moments over and over again...
until a take seemed credible enough.
They reveal the multiple angles
from which these scenes were filmed,
as well as the cameramen themselves,
inadvertently captured
in one another's lens.
Do you know who told you and the other reporters what to film?
We were brought to the various locations by a man wearing an S. A... or brown party uniform.
We called him "Goldpheasant."
Can you recall his name and rank?
I have no idea what his name was.
Judging from his appearance, he must have held an important position.
I believe he was in charge of propaganda matters in Warsaw.
Could you describe what kind of contact you had... with this so-called "Goldpheasant?"
"Goldpheasant" sent us... to various scenes or groups of people.
He never gave us any explanation concerning the meaning of our filming.
He simply said that he wanted us to film this or that.
As far as I could tell, he knew nothing about film.
We constantly had to point out that under the given light conditions, we couldn't deliver reasonable pictures.
We didn't have a chance to express ourselves.
We were sent by "Goldpheasant"... to locations, to people, or groups of people.
You were not given a chance to express yourselves freely?
No, we were not.
I know for a fact that the film was processed in Berlin.
We were never told what happened with it after that.
Today they set up a film session
in Szulc's restaurant.
They rounded up well-dressed,
typical Jews,
seated them at the tables,
and ordered that they be served...
at the expense of the Jewish community:
Fish, geese, liquor,
pastries and other delicacies.
The Jews ate and the Germans filmed.
It is not hard to imagine
the motivation behind this:
Let the world see the paradise
in which the Jews are living.
These despicable scenes went on for hours.
Yesterday morning, the Germans
took all the waitresses outside.
The girls were lined up on the street...
and were instructed
to look happy and attractive.
At the same time,
they grabbed beggar-children...
and told them to walk
by the elegant waitresses...
with their hands out,
into which nothing was put.
This was recorded on film, to show
that while the Jews live in luxury,
they share nothing with the hungry.
My mother also wore her beautiful coat, maybe even a hat. So what?
Does that mean that life goes on as usual?
After the filming, these people vanished... after being loaded onto trucks or caught in some other way.
Perhaps they believed that being filmed would save them, but no way!
Their fate was the same as everyone else's.
Weekly Report, May 19, 1942...
There are rumors that gas was used
for the first time in this war,
on the German side.
Rumors about new resettlements from
Warsaw have been circulating for days...
and have created an enormous panic.
As usual, the "rumor-makers"
know from a "reliable source"...
that the German authorities intend
to resettle the Jews of Warsaw...
in the East.
The next morning at 8 a.m.,
all the actors were ordered to appear...
at the New Azazel Theater.
During the rehearsals
with the actors on the stage,
a group of soldiers picked up people.
People started running and panic ensued,
in the midst of which the Germans
treated everyone to heavy beatings.
Since no one knew why
they were being held there,
you could hear
the sighs and groans...
of the children who were picked up
together with their parents.
After each actor finished his part,
the audience had to yell "Bravo!"
The audience in the theater was held...
until the filming was finished at 8 p. M...
without food or any opportunity
to take care of their bodily needs.
When an actor sang happy songs,
the audience was ordered
to roar with laughter.
Woe to anyone who didn't laugh properly.
His fate was doomed.
They laughed as they had
never laughed before.
The Germans ordered all the actors
to overact as much as possible.
David Seiderman sang "My Yiddisher Mame."
Ruth Zandberg, who accompanied him
on the piano, wept bitterly.
Her mother, Yiddish actress Zusha
Zandberg, had just died of typhus.
The scope of the film is quite broad.
The filmmakers are interested in every
aspect of Jewish life in the Ghetto.
It isn't hard to guess
their intentions...
for this "artistic"project.
They aim to capture
very "objectively"...
aspects of the so-called
Jewish folk character.
In front of our eyes unfolds
the prologue to a great tragedy.
Even though we don't know its name,
we can sense what it's about.
The name of the prologue:
"A Jewfilm."
A group of artists arrived
from Germany...
with a list of scenes which
the community must prepare for them.
At that point, even the blind
could see where things stood.
The community had to prepare
a circumcision ceremony, a wedding,
the Sabbath, both in the synagogue
and the cemetery, and holidays.
This clearly had one intention:
To prove to the "righteous gentiles"
in Hitler's camp that they are right,
that there is only one way
to deal with the Jews: Annihilation.
I'd like to read you excerpts from the diary... of the Chairman of the Judenrat, in Warsaw, Adam Czerniakow.
Czerniakow wrote daily entries in his diary mentioning the filming.
The diary of the Chairman of the Judenrat survived?
Yes. I'll read you the following entry from May 1942.
You may interrupt and add details.
Czerniakow writes:
May 12, 1942...
Yesterday, they filmed
a demonstration of a circumcision.
They insisted that the circumcision
take place...
in a private apartment
instead of a hospital.
Since the "actor"weighs less than 2 kgs,
there is a danger
that he might not live very long.
I cannot recall this event.
It may have been filmed by other members of the crew.
Babies were born. Woe to those babies.
It was the end for them and the end for their families.
Apparently, my mother also got pregnant.
I remember my mother coming back from somewhere... and lying down in bed for two days.
I guessed that... she must have had an abortion.
And I think to myself how lucky we were... that this happened in the spring of'42.
If it had been three months later, when the deportation started, we might have all been sent to our death because of that baby.
This week they invented
a new way to torture us.
First, they rounded up dozens
of pretty young women...
and brought them to a Jewish ritual bath.
Then, men were rounded up
and brought to the same ritual bath.
While one Nazi whipped the heads
of those who were captured,
his colleague stood in a corner
with film equipment.
This is not slander. Here is the film.
I now recall... that one day we were told to shoot inside a ritual bath.
We were then brought to a rather old building... which had a bath on the ground floor or in the cellar.
Several naked women hesitantly stepped into the bath.
There were about 8 of them, standing up to their hips in water.
One was an old Jewish woman, who I believe was also in the water.
She murmured something which I understood to be prayers.
These were women who were somewhat better fed.
It was difficult to film in the bath because we didn't have enough light.
Today the Germans set up
an original film scene...
at the corner of Nowolipki
and Smocza Streets.
They used the finest hearse we have,
which was taken by the Germans
for the purpose of the film.
They want to prove that Jews
not only live a comfortable life,
but also die with dignity
and even get a luxurious burial.
No good will come to us
from this film craziness.
But Jews don't bury their dead in a coffin!
In the spring of'42, there were corpses on the sidewalks.
Someone like me, who could still walk, had to make her way between the corpses.
I hurried along the walls like a mouse, and suddenly a car pulled up.
Two Germans stepped out... and a third pointed a camera at the corpses.
I hid.
People who still looked more or less human... were kindly asked to walk by the corpses with their heads held high.
They walked by and came back, and walked by again and came back again.
It's true that we had to walk by.
No one looked, it was impossible.
We became indifferent to the suffering of others... because otherwise, it was impossible to live.
It was so terrifying because
I could be the next in line.
When it was already dark... and I was walking down Karmelitzka street, which was crowded with people,
I tripped on something... and lost my balance.
When I opened my eyes,
I saw that I had fallen on a corpse.
My face was nearly touching his, and I was shaking.
Then suddenly, it was as if all the corpses which
I had previously avoided looking at, were there, in the face of this one man.
It was a human being.
I got home and I told my mother what had happened.
It was only then that I started to cry,
I cried a lot.
I had always been so optimistic and strong, but suddenly it all broke down.
My mother took out some bread and spread some jam on it for me.
She gave me a slice of bread.
A slice of comfort.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
This was filmed by one
of Willy Wist's colleagues,
who had new film stock in color,
as well as his own personal camera.
It seems that he found time
to record personal memento of Ghetto life,
as well as of the making of the film,
including the large crowd scenes
staged by the film crew.
Here is the funeral procession.
And here, the market.
And for a brief second,
one of the cameramen...
can be seen caught in the frame.
Can you recall anything else about the filming in the Ghetto?
In the Warsaw Ghetto,
I remember seeing... a Jew going around with a handcart carrying corpses.
I saw how he picked up a corpse in front of one of the houses... and continued to the cemetery.
I remember seeing an arm and a leg hanging down.
At the entrance to the cemetery, there was some sort of shack... in which corpses were piled up.
There were some 40 or 50 corpses which still had to be buried.
I filmed this shack from the outside.
Today, I cannot watch this.
I am no longer immune.
Today I am human, today I can cry.
I am so happy that I can cry... now that I'm human.
I recall that I had to film a mass grave... with many layers of corpses.
I cannot say how many layers there were... beneath the layer which I could see.
I remember the corpses being eased into the grave on a slide.
Two Jewish workers were standing inside the grave, arranging the corpses next to one another.
I have a vague memory that the corpses were strewn with chloride.
Although I believe that the corpses were naked,
I am not certain about this.
The people were all skin and bones.
At the time, my impression was that the people had died of starvation.
These impressions in Warsaw had a profound impact on me, although later,
I got to see quite a lot.
They preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time.
Herr Wist, during the filming, you were really unaware of the plans to resettle and physically annihilate... thewish population in the near future?
I can only say that at the time,
I definitely knew nothing... of the horrible fate awaiting thews of Warsaw.
It was only after the war that I learned... about the planned extermination of thews in the Treblinka death camp.
During the filming in the Warsaw Ghetto,
I often had the opportunity to talk to thews... who had been sent there from Germany.
From these conversations, my impression was that they were full of hope... and that they expected... to be resettled in Madagascar or elsewhere.
They regarded their stay in Warsaw as temporary.
I am absolutely convinced that at the time they had no idea... what their real fate would be.
Although at the time, the malnourishment of the population... in Warsaw was appalling,
I never thought that these people... would be systematically murdered.
After 30 days of shooting,
the film crew packed up its cameras
and lighting equipment and was gone.
Less than two months later,
S.S. Officers appeared
in the office of Czerniakow,
the head of the Judenrat,
instructing him to draw up a list...
of many thousands Jews
for immediate deportation to Treblinka.
Czerniakow was most likely aware that
Treblinka was no more than a mass grave.
The following day, when the quotas oews
were significantly raised,
he swallowed the cyanide capsule he had
kept since the start of the war,
and in the silence of his death,
signaled his people: "This is the end."
These were also the days during which
the propaganda film was being edited.
Soon it would be buried
in the stacks of the archive.
On its box, a single title:
The Ghetto.
In memory of Howard Zinn
Cochabamba, Bolivia. Year 2000
Come on.
You see?
Look, look, look.
There are more coming.
Hello.
Good morning.
So, an open casting, Sebastian?
Fucking great.
I told you this would happen.
Hello.
Good morning.
Excuse me.
How's it going?
They all want to be seen, and there are hundreds...
Okay, well, tell them that we don't need anymore.
We'll just see the ones here.
The rest can leave.
No, Costa, wait, we can't do that.
Shit, we can't see them all,
Sebastian.
If you prefer, pick the ones you like and get rid of the rest.
But do it now! Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Choose the ones you like.
- Hello.
- Pleasure.
Could you go with the girl? Yes?
How are you?
Go ahead.
Yes, go ahead.
They're very good.
- How many men are going?
- Five, and two women.
Okay, okay. Okay.
- Hello. Could you go?
- Yes.
Yeah?
Thank you.
And we're not going to go?
Uh, yes.
Okay, in a -- in a minute.
- Sebastian?
- What?
- We've got enough.
- Already?
We've got more than enough inside, and this is pointless.
We have to tell them to leave.
Well, apologize to them.
- This can't be.
- Come with me, please.
Sorry, sorry.
We're very sorry, really.
I'm sorry.
We don't need anyone else.
No, we can't see everybody.
There are too many.
No, no, you have to be able to.
We've been waiting for hours.
You have to go, gentlemen.
We can't see anyone else.
No, Ma'am, we're not leaving.
We're going to wait here until we're seen.
- Listen, didn't you hear her?
- I did, but --
You have to leave.
You have to go.
- Get out of here!
- Hey, bastard!
Get out of here!
You have to leave!
Enough! Enough!
- Enough! Enough!
- What's going on?
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy!
Calm down, calm down, calm down!
What's wrong?
"Everyone gets a chance."
That's what it says.
And my girl wants to act.
Yeah, her and 200 others, but we can't see them all, understand?
You don't understand, white face.
We've been waiting for hours.
Some have come from very far on foot.
Now you tell us to leave.
You have to see all of us.
We're not leaving until you see us all.
We're not moving from here!
Tell him anything, but get rid of him.
- What's your name?
- Daniel.
Daniel.
All right, Daniel's right.
We're going to see everyone.
- Fuck!
- Okay?
We'll see you all, no matter how long it takes.
Sebastian, we have to leave.
Yes, calmly, though, calmly.
Okay? Okay.
Film that bastard for me.
And his daughter, too.
He's good.
Okay, as you heard, we're going to see everyone.
- Let's go!
- Let's go.
EVEN THE RAIN
Costa, are you crazy?
Slow down!
Sebastian, tell me something.
We're in Bolivia.
It doesn't make much sense.
Because we're 7,500 feet above sea level, surrounded by mountains, and thousands of miles from the Caribbean.
Well, Costa thinks
Columbus landed by parachute.
No, Costa knows this place is full of starving natives, and that means thousands of extras.
None of that digital shit. l want scale, all the money up on the screen.
No, Costa, no.
This could be a mess, really.
Have you seen their faces?
Please, they're Quechua.
- So?
- What do you mean, "so?"
They're from the Andes!
What's Columbus doing with natives from the Andes?
From the Andes or wherever, they're natives.
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Give me a fucking break.
They're all the same.
No.
You can negotiate things here -- hotels, transport, catering, whatever.
So, it's about money.
Yes, yes!
It's always money, always, always.
Well, in this case, very little money, right?
Right, you miserable cheapskate?
If we'd filmed in English, we'd have double the money and double the audience.
Almost had the deal done till you fucked it up.
Because Spaniards speak Spanish.
What if we'd done it in English?
We'd have been fucking smart.
So, the Spaniards speak Spanish, and the Tainos that Columbus found speak Quechua?
Is that how you're going to be? l just want to know. l just want to know.
We'll do it, Sebastian!
Up!
Come on, come on, come on!
That's it!
Careful!
Costa, slowly, it's very dangerous!
Come on, come on, come on.
Pull it up!
- Careful! Careful!
- Watch out!
Everyone all right?
Okay, let's see if we can do this.
Come on!
No, Costa, please.
We have to do it some other way!
It has to be done another way, please.
One, two, three...
Up!
One, two, three...
Up!
Once more, on three.
One, two, three...
Up!
Alley-oop!
Listen, Costa, we should've gotten professionals and used a crane!
Things can't be done like that.
Someone could get hurt!
Yeah, and an engineer, too.
Do you know how much we've saved?
35,000, so calm down.
It’s all done.
Great work, guys.
The beers are on me.
Turn that fucking thing off!
- Sorry.
- It’s okay. l hope I can get through this.
Is he drunk?
Are we all here?
We are now.
All right, when you're ready.
"We see the stunned faces of Taino children hiding in the bushes.
From their point of view, we see Columbus and his men landing in the New World.
Some small boats are on the shore.
The children are hit by a disgusting smell while the strange creatures, wet and dirty, some bearded, others bald, stumble on the sand.
The children laugh and make comments, trying to understand who these strangers are -- " l, Christopher Columbus, humble servant of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile, in the name of Jesus Christ,
Son of the one true God, take possession of these lands and seas and all they contain.
And with this act...
...l proclaim sovereignty over these lands and seas on behalf of their most gracious Majesties.
Let us thank the Virgin Mother for delivering us with good health to this great triumph.
This must be their village.
Thank God, they look peaceful.
A good site for a fortress.
Mingle with them.
The first man to find gold will be rewarded.
Captain... treat them well.
We need their food.
And find out what arms they have.
Admiral!
Quickly!
You have to see this!
- Gold!
- Gold.
- Gold.
- Gold.
It’s gold.
Where is the gold?
Gold!
Where is the gold?
You know what I’m talking about!
Gold!
Where is it?!
Who gives a shit about gold? l need a fucking drink!
Forgive me, Miss.
We actors are totally selfish.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Remember him?
See the look in his eyes?
The piercing stare, really deep.
He's little, but he's got great presence.
Yeah, and he stinks of trouble, too.
- And he's never acted in his life.
- No, but I’m the director.
It’s an advantage.
He's very natural.
What about the Peruvian actor?
He's terrible, totally predictable.
No. No, no.
But this one's a troublemaker.
You saw what he stirred up at the casting the other day.
He's a leader.
You're looking for a leader.
Costa... l want him and his daughter.
No, don't fuck with me, I don't want this guy on the fucking shoot.
He'll wreck it.
I don't want him. That's it.
Let me show you something.
Look.
- What's this?
- Who's that? l know perfectly well who it is.
When did you shoot this?
- This morning.
- Without telling me?
Look, look, look!
Hatuey! Fuck, it's Hatuey!
- Right?
- He's very good.
- It’s amazing!
- Okay, he's Hatuey, fantastic.
You're not going to be able to control this guy.
You're going to regret it.
Just remember I told you so.
He's right in a way.
But the film comes first, always.
As governor of this island, l want to thank you for coming to see me.
After my first voyage, l spoke personally with their Majesties, who instructed me to treat you with respect and cordiality.
We ask that you recognize the Church and the Pope as rulers of the universe.
And also that you accept the King and the Queen of Spain as rulers of these lands.
In exchange, you will receive our love and our charity.
And if we do not?
Captain...
If not... we will enslave you and dispose of you as we wish.
We will seize your possessions, and we will do you as much harm as we can.
What do you want from us?
Taxes.
Every Indian over the age of 14 must fill a bell.
What did he say?
With what?
With gold. Here.
It isn't very big.
Captain.
Alberto, can you tell us about your character?
Well, my character is
Bartolome de las Casas.
He came to the Indies when he was 18 to take charge of a plantation and the Indian slaves who worked there.
But later, traumatized by the massacres he witnessed, he devoted his life to the Indians.
He became a Dominican.
He was nearly murdered twice.
On his deathbed -- and I’m quoting verbatim.
Don't laugh, listen.
He said,
"l condemn the blindness of those who ignore the genocide and give orders to the world."
This guy was the father of international law, and I’m only in eight scenes!
And you, Juan? l play Antonio Montesinos.
Sebastian gave me 20 books to read, but I’m not a reader like him.
My character isn't as famous as Bartolome, but he's more important.
He's more important than Bartolome because I was the first to intercede for the Indians. l was the one who started everything and gave that famous sermon --
"l am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island, and you are in mortal sin!"
That was me.
Daniel, can you tell me what made you do this film?
What do you mean?
What did you like about your character?
Maybe he represents native resistance or shows colonization from a different angle?
He just wants the money!
What?
He just wants the money!
Do you have love scenes?
How many girls do you kiss?
Do you have to strip off?
A little squirt like you!
No, guys.
What are you digging?
We're running out of water here, and between all of us, we've bought --
See that hill?
We bought a well there, and now we're digging a ditch.
It’s about 7 kilometers long.
-7 kilometers?
- Yes, 7 kilometers.
We're digging a ditch to bring the pipeline along the hillside and have water here.
Why are you here?
We're making a documentary about the film.
You're asking a lot of questions.
Daniel, don't trust her.
Here come the bastards.
They're stopping.
They've stopped.
What do they want?
What the fuck do you want here?
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for here?
What are you looking for?
- How do you say "food"?
- Mikuna.
- How do you say "It was delicious"?
- Ancha miski.
How do you say "l love you"?
Anchata munaiki.
- And "wine"?
- Vino also.
- And "water"?
- Yaku.
I'll have some yaku.
Nothing like getting into character.
God bless you, Father.
Why not fill a plastic bag with the leftovers from this meal, which costs more than what they earn in a month, and give it to them, so their scrawny children can gobble it up like starving rodents!
Then you'll feel like a real missionary.
Anton, relax.
It’s Saturday night.
How long will you remember that "water" is yaku?
That's not very pious, Father, but the director will cut it out, along with other important details.
For example, the fact that Las Casas wanted black slaves from Africa to replace the Indians.
Why not put that in the film?
Don't let him needle you.
No, no, no, but -- but, no, it's true. It’s true.
He did think that when he was young, but for a very short time.
He always regretted it.
- And his deal with the slave traders?
- What?
A mistake, a disaster that ashamed him.
Don't lose your marbles, Reverend.
I’m not, I’m just informing you.
Until his dying breath,
Las Casas condemned corrupt bishops, merchants, royal officials...
The whole State hated him.
- They hated him?
- Yes. Listen to me.
He said the Indians had been sacrificed, and I quote,
"for private appetites and profits,"
500 years ago.
Then cynics like you try to reduce his life to one mistake.
Like in football, history is always cruel to the losers.
Just cut them out and make the film about me!
I’m better-looking, right?
More handsome than him.
He never -- Beto.
He never questioned Spanish authority over the New World or royal authority.
In other words, he was a conservative.
He was a radical!
A radical!
He demanded that Indians be treated equally as Spaniards!
Under the Crown!
But with the Indians' consent.
He was ahead of his time.
How the fuck did Disney pass on this?
You have an agenda.
You sanctify this pair of bastards and string me up!
This isn't art.
It’s pure propaganda.
- So why are you here?
- What?
Why the hell are you doing it?
For the gold!
And for Jesus Christ!
May I say something?
Just one thing? l am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island!
And you are in mortal sin!
Good night, Cochabamba!
What are you doing?
Get the other padlock.
What are you doing?
Why did you break the padlock?
What are you doing to the well?
We dug this well with our own hands so our children could drink.
You've got no right to close the well!
How can we live with dirty water?
You take our lands, you take our wells.
Are you going to take the air, too?
We're not paying more money.
Don't all talk -- don't all talk at the same time.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
These men are doing their job.
What job?
Taking our water?
No, Ma'am, it's not that.
The well is ours.
Water for our families, for our children.
You are fathers, too.
So don't put another lock on there, otherwise we're going to fight you all the way!
The water is for our children!
This water is for our children!
Don't take away our kids' water!
All right, it's March of 1511.
Boys! 10 minutes.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, March of 1511.
The Dominicans gather the rich and powerful of Santo Domingo to listen to the sermon.
Bartolome is sitting there.
- Here?
- Yes, exactly, here.
He's just like the others.
He still has Indians and lands.
Okay? Yes?
So, yes, you're back there.
We hear the hymn in Latin.
It ends.
A slight pause.
You exchange a look with Bartolome.
And we begin.
The Pharisees sent someone to ask John the Baptist who he was.
And he replied, "l am a voice crying in the wilderness."
The Indians mine the gold which builds our cities and even our churches.
Gold finances our conquests in far distant parts and so the great wheel of commerce turns.
Not one of us is untouched by Indian sweat, least of all His Majesty and his bishops!
As a priest, I must follow
Gospel imperatives, the first of which is to preach the truth. l am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island, and you are in mortal sin!
What's he saying?
This man's gone mad!
You live in sin, and you die in it!
Why?
Because of the cruel tyranny you impose on these innocents!
Tell me by what right and with what justice you keep these Indians in such cruel, horrible slavery.
They were living peacefully on their land!
This is outrageous!
By what authority have you waged such terrible war on them?
By what right do you keep them so oppressed, starved, and exhausted?
They're dying because of you.
Or rather, you murder them!
What a disgrace!
This is intolerable!
How can you be so asleep?
How can you be so deep inside that lethargic dream?
Look into the Indians' eyes.
Are these not men?
Do they not have rational souls?
Are you not obliged to love them as yourselves?
Who do you think you are?
Your sermon today has called into question my authority and that of the King.
You know that the Indian concessions are all legal. l demand an official retraction,
Father Montesinos.
The truth has many enemies.
The lie has many friends.
This is a capital offense!
Hang the traitor! Burn him!
Montesinos, go back to Spain before we cut out your tongue!
Very good.
He goes right for them, doesn't he?
Yes, this man never retracted.
No, the next Saturday, he preached the same sermon.
He continued denouncing them like that for years until they killed him.
In Venezuela.
Yes, he was the first voice of conscience against an empire.
Like that, from a little church like this.
- Okay?
- Yes.
To the dressing room.
Great.
- Great.
- You can continue.
They sell our rivers against our will.
They sell our wells, our lakes... and even the rain that falls on our heads!
By law!
Friends, it's incredible!
They don't allow us to collect the water that falls from the rain, by law!
And who takes even the rain?
A company whose owners are in London and California.
Friends, what are they going to steal next?
The vapor from our breath?
The sweat from our brow?
All they'll get from me is piss!
Take it easy, comrades!
Take it easy, comrades...
Costa, they say that they want to mobilize thousands.
- So?
- From the countryside...
...from the city, the unions.
People are furious.
No wonder, they're taking their water.
They're taking their water.
- Enough.
- Imagine a documentary about this.
Costa, let me do it.
No, I’m not spending another penny.
Costa, they're going to raise hell.
And if we don't tell the story, we're going to let a great chance escape. l said no!
I’m not a fucking NGO!
This story has nothing to do with me.
But you're in the middle of it!
Come in.
Shit, the big boss himself.
Told you need a hand with this.
You?
Come in, come in.
No one else dares enter the ogre's den.
It’s me, again.
I've tried all the numbers.
There's no way I can contact you.
What's wrong?
Don't the kids have my number?
And the little one?
Call me.
Fucking machines.
You got a family?
Yes, a boy of 14.
What's he like?
Well, to be honest, I have no idea.
He lives with his mother.
This business fucks up families.
Here.
Something wrong, Anton?
My bloody head! l can't remember the fucking beginning.
Start at the beginning.
"They are so naive -- "
They are so naive and generous with what they have that they never refuse anything.
Whatever they have, if you ask them for it, they will give it to you, inviting the person to share it with them. l have still not found out if they have private property.
With just 50 men, you could subdue them and make them do whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
- On the first --
- On the first island I found...
...l took several by force.
Your Majesties will see that I will give you all the gold you desire in exchange for a little help.
Besides spices and cotton, there are slaves, as many as you require.
All of Christendom should be joyful and solemnly thank the Holy Trinity for having converted so many souls to the holy faith, and for the countless material benefits this will bring us, since not only Spain, but all of Christendom will enjoy solace and profit.
No wonder you can't remember it.
No one talks like that.
That is exactly the first letter
Columbus sent from the New World to the Spanish Crown.
That's why Sebastian is so faithful to the text.
I don't know if it'll work.
It’s a little risky, but I like it.
But if he'd just give me some space to present the man, with his doubts, his anxieties...
Tell him.
- Why do you drink so much, Anton?
- Because I’m always... very... very thirsty.
But can you get through this?
We are screwed without you.
It’s great to feel needed.
Look at the size of it.
- Can we go on board?
- We'll ask Costa.
Hi, there.
They really had to fill these with gold dust?
Seems so.
Daniel, I saw you in a demonstration with the police.
Do you realize that if something happens to you, we're fucked?
Without you, we can't finish the film.
Can you not keep out of this?
Just three weeks.
Excuse me.
Yes?
The money men.
They saw the rushes, and they say you're great.
Very good.
Daniel, we're going to make a fantastic film, you'll see.
No, really.
Sebastian is preparing some amazing scenes -- hundreds of guys in the ravine panning for gold.
Fucking epic, and you're there!
You're there, man!
What?
Two fucking dollars, right?
And they're happy. l worked in the States for two years in construction. l know this story.
Belen, leave that.
Come on.
- We're not going on the boat?
- We have to go home.
Come on, come on.
Stay in line.
Move.
Captain...
What's this?
Do you think I’m stupid?
Are you trying to fool me?
Nothing here but sand.
Speak like a Christian!
I don't understand you!
This is sand.
Have him clipped.
Next.
There's not enough here.
There isn't enough.
A lot of sand.
Come on, take him away to be clipped.
Father! Father!
You, come on!
- Well done, kid, you were great.
- Thank you.
- Happy?
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Young lady, well done.
- Thank you.
You've got talent.
A scene to be proud of. l hope they're paying you like they should.
Paying me a lot more than the extras.
More than the extras?
My God!
Do you want to know what they're paying me?
- What?
- Two million bolivanos.
Wow.
- Dad!
- Hello.
I’ve just seen the scene in the jungle.
It was very interesting, yes.
It was sad but interesting. l really liked it.
It isn't real, but it's lovely.
- You liked it?
- Yes, a lot. l owe you an apology.
Help!
It’s a horrific choice... heartbreaking.
You can't bear the idea that the dogs will eat the babies.
We'll see you talking to Hatuey and how you understand that there's no other solution, that you have to make this decision and you have to make it together to give each other courage.
So you'll take the babies...
...slowly, wade into the river, put them in the water, and drown them.
Okay, how are we going to do it?
We're going to do it like this.
In the first take, you'll go in with the babies, and as soon as you're up to your waists, we'll stop, and we'll bring over the dolls you can see there and swap them for the babies, okay?
Everything okay?
Is something wrong, Daniel?
Listen, it's complet--
Tell them that it's totally safe.
The babies won't even get wet.
They won't even get wet.
When the water is up to your waist, we'll cut and bring those dolls, look.
Bring those dolls so they can...
Sebastian, give me a moment.
Okay, but we don't have much time.
What's up?
I don't know.
- Well?
- They won't do it.
Look, I know it's difficult, but we have to get them to do it.
We need it for the film...
Sebastian, they can't even imagine the idea of doing it.
I’m not making this up.
It’s what happened.
We have to show it.
It’s important for the film.
Please.
Sebastian, some things are more important than your film.
Good Lord!
God!
What do I do?
Nothing.
Let's do the next scene.
Comrades, silence, please!
Listen.
We're taking too long, and it's getting very hot.
We're going to get tired.
Comrades, we are debating the possibility of occupying September 14th Square.
Comrades!
And taking over the Water Company building and not budging until they give us back the water!
No, that's what they want.
It'll give them an excuse for another massacre.
I’m not in agreement.
Comrades!
We all drink water, don't we?
Then we all have to go on the march.
Comrades, comrades, please.
I don't agree.
They'll beat us up. They'll gas us.
What about our children?
Will you look after them?
We are women, we have children.
We shouldn't go.
How can we pay $450 a year?
It’s robbery.
Better if they just shoot us now.
Silence, please!
We'll decide by voting, comrades.
We'll take a vote.
Those who want to fight, raise their hands and say,
"The water belongs to us!"
The water belongs to us!
Is that Daniel?
What's he doing here?
After consulting with the residents...
Causing trouble, what else? l told you, Sebastian.
Now what?
Do I lock him up?
...and with our union comrades, we, the people of Cochabamba, declare that if the privatization of water is not revoked within 48 hours, we will begin an indefinite blockade of the city and the roads!
What do we want?
Water!
When do we want it?
Now!
Inside.
Let's go inside.
Rifle or gun, the people never run!
Thank you.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- It’s a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine.
- I’ve seen all your films.
- All of them?
We're honored to have you in our city.
Come in, please.
- Thank you.
- A photo of the occasion?
Thank you.
- This way.
- Thank you.
We are doubly honored that you are here to tell the story of Bartolome de Las Casas, an underestimated man, in my view.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, listen...
Thank you for the policemen you sent us.
- We feel much safer.
- It’s an honor for me.
Wow.
They're burning the water bills.
Excuse me, a little domestic row.
Nothing for you to worry about.
Don't worry.
While there's champagne to drink,
"Let them eat cake," as Marie Antoinette said.
It’s only an excuse for some fanatics to stir up the desperate and gain a name for themselves.
Forgive me for saying so, but I think their demands are reasonable.
Perhaps if you were better informed...
We're a country with few resources.
It’s hard to maintain a water supply without major foreign investment.
These people think that government money grows on trees.
Very good.
Given their long history of exploitation,
Indians' distrust is embedded in their genes.
It’s very difficult to reason with them, especially when they're illiterate.
But that's how it is.
We have objective reports from Harvard professors, the IMF...
I'd love to see those bastards feed their families on 40 fucking dollars a month!
Anyway, in this globalized world...
- Excuse me, I’m wanted.
- Of course.
In this globalized world, the Indians burn water bills and hurl rocks at the police.
It’s the cult of victim versus modernity.
I don't want to be rude, but if someone earns two dollars a day, he can't pay a 300% increase in the price of water.
At least that's what I’m told.
How curious.
That's what I’m told you pay the extras.
Yes, but we have a very tight budget.
Don't we all?
I’ll be honest.
The rumors are very worrying.
This water dispute... might get out of hand and stop us from filming.
I don't know if you could do something about it. l imagine you're trying to reach an agreement.
If we give one inch, these Indians will drag us back to the Stone Age.
Now, if you'll excuse me, make yourselves at home.
Thank you.
Fuck it!
How is he?
- They beat him up.
- His face, too?
We'll have to cover it with his hair.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Costa, make him understand if we get the scene with the cross, we're okay.
If not, we're fucked, Costa.
Make the bastard give his word!
What the fuck are you playing at, Daniel?
Can you not think of the time and effort that have gone into this film?
The hundreds of people working on it, the money we're spending?
If you get fucked, we all get fucked!
Is three weeks too much to ask?
Can no one else do this water stuff?
Are you listening?
Ah... playing the silent, dignified Indian?
Fucking great.
If we catch you at another demonstration, you won't get a fucking penny.
Is that clear?
I’ll tell you what.
We'll give you an extra $5,000 if you stay away from demonstrations until we're finished.
Okay?
What?
Forgive me, it's beneath you.
Or not enough?
Eh, Daniel?
Not enough?
$10,000, Daniel, $10,000.
Half now, half when we finish!
You've never seen so much money in your life!
It’s your only fucking chance to get out of this shithole where you live, and you're smart enough to see that!
Or not?
Fuck!
All right.
What?
All right.
No more demonstrations, and you'll do as we say until we're finished.
Do I have your word, Daniel?
Do l?
Teresa, put the money away.
Put it away.
We're going to need it.
Bruno!
Shit, Bruno!
I’m talking to you.
Tell them to shut up, please.
Okay? Please.
Bruno, Bruno, are you deaf?
Listen, get them to the first position.
We're here to work, not to lie around.
What do you want?
What?
- It’s Costa.
- Let me have it.
Hi.
Where are you?
No, Costa, no, no, no!
Where the fuck are my natives?
Where the fuck is Daniel?!
A day of disturbances in Cochabamba.
Since the crack of dawn, peasants and their allies have blockaded the city.
Hundreds of city dwellers affected by the water problem have threatened to escalate actions starting next week.
Hundreds of people, some from private companies, joined the protest organized by the peasants who have said,
"We'll maintain the pressure."
Bruno, this looks really bad.
- Can we shoot like this?
- Yes, we can.
...and the military forces have only caused more violence.
"If they don't listen to us," citizens groups said,
"we'll bring the city to a standstill tomorrow."
In various parts of the city, serious confrontations...
What an animal!
...demonstrators blocked key points...
What a bastard!
...violent youths fought with riot police...
Is that Daniel?
They've smashed his face.
He's a fucking idiot!
They'll throw him in jail!
What?
What are you staring at, you drunk?
Look, without the cross scene, there's no film.
Right?
Cris? It’s Costa.
How much cash can we get by tonight?
Yes, tonight.
Okay.
Look, Daniel's been arrested...
Listen!
Find out where he is and the name of the police chief, and set me up a meeting.
Yes, now.
Look, wait, one more thing.
Call everyone and tell them that we're doing the cross scene tomorrow.
I don't know, and I don't care.
Yes, you heard right.
Move it.
That bastard won't screw us.
Let's go.
Here's $2,000.
We need that man to finish the film.
Very well.
On one condition.
When you finish filming, l bring him back.
No.
Okay.
- We can't do that.
- Why not?
We can't.
Can we talk a moment?
Will you excuse us?
If you'll excuse us...
- Costa!
- What?
What if he's beaten up when he comes back?
If he's tortured, killed, or disappeared?
These bastards can do anything.
I don't want that on my conscience.
But he's in jail already!
We didn't put him there.
And the bastard tricked us.
Without the scene, there's no film.
- You fucking know that.
- Yes, I know. l say we do it.
Okay, but we tip him off.
All right, whatever you want, but after we film the scene, or he'll be off like a shot.
Shit, it's...too much...
- For fuck's sake.
- I can't.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Daniel?
You promised me.
We made a deal.
You broke your word.
Water is life.
You don't understand.
Thanks, boys.
Awake all night and vomiting.
I don't know if I can do this, Costa.
So, now the nutcase who dragged us here says he can't do it.
Do you know when I realized how crazy you were?
Seven years ago.
You called me at 2:00 a.m.
You won't remember.
"You have to hear this, Costa!"
You said it was written by a priest called Montesinos in the 16th century.
As if I gave a fuck. l was in a bar -- deafening music, blind drunk, everyone waiting for me. l could hardly hear you, but you kept going, yapping...
From a humble straw church...
One man against an empire, a voice crying in the desert.
Are these not men?
Do they not have rational souls?
Are you not obliged to love them as yourselves?
That's what got you.
That's what gripped you...
...lodged in there, like a virus.
You're not the kind to give up,
Sebastian.
You're not.
You can't quit now.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on!
Let's go.
Keep going.
Come on, let's go.
Bring them!
Women, children, old people.
Everyone must see this. l beg you, Commander.
This will turn the Indians against us for generations.
The Crown will prosecute you! l doubt it, Father.
This isn't Christian!
Choose 13, and the rest go free.
One for each disciple and one for Christ Himself!
Want to choose them, Father?
This is a sacrilege.
No, Father.
It’s an example.
Why not join the Franciscans and save their souls?
If they have any.
- If he interferes, arrest him.
- Come on!
The Evangelists.
Matthew.
Mark.
Luke.
John.
Father, help me.
I’ve forgotten the names.
- Cesar.
- Carlos.
- Manolo.
- Paco.
Federico.
Felipe.
Let's see.
Who'll be Jesus Christ?
I’ll baptize you, and you'll have glory and eternal peace in Heaven.
Otherwise, you'll suffer eternal torment in Hell.
In the name of Christ, you can still save your soul.
You must understand the difference between Heaven and Hell.
Ask the Lord for forgiveness, and I’ll baptize you, and you'll have glory and eternal peace in Heaven.
Otherwise, you'll suffer eternal torment in Hell.
Has he understood?
Do Christians go to Heaven?
Good Christians do.
Send me to Hell!
Silence!
This is what will happen if you defy the Christians.
What are they saying?
"l despise you."
"l despise your God."
"l despise your greed."
May God forgive us.
Shut them up!
What are they saying, Father?
His name!
Thanks to you, it will never be forgotten!
Okay, cut!
Okay, guys, that was incredible!
Thank you.
We're going to do it!
Who is Daniel?
Come with us.
You're under arrest.
Come with us.
Get back!
Excuse me!
Take it easy! Take it easy!
Please, please.
Please, please!
Get them!
Leave him alone!
It’s like a dream. l can't believe it.
The Water Committee has said that if Bolivian Waters doesn't leave, blockades will continue on the streets and on access roads.
The Committee has asked that the blockades continue, so the majority of roads and streets will remain in that state.
The government has declared a state of emergency and has sent special police forces from La Paz to prevent acts of vandalism and violence.
September 14th Square is still held by citizens.
The roads linking Cochabamba with the rest of the country are still blocked.
The Republic's vice-president says this is an act of subversion aimed at destabilizing a democratically elected constitutional government.
It is an opportunistic protest intended to submerge the country in disorder and chaos.
Guys...
Guys! Guys! Guys!
I’m sorry, but I’m scared. l want a ticket home right now.
And I’m serious.
Me too.
How the fuck can you leave the film?
You can't just dump us.
- You signed a contract.
- Don't bullshit me!
- You can't even guarantee our safety!
- Yes, I can.
- You can't!
- I can! Shut up and listen!
This is an eight-hour drive away.
The countryside is practically the same, and it's safe.
Costa! I’m scared!
Understand?
Scared.
And I’ve got a new baby.
Anything could happen.
I don't want to be here when it does.
Run, little rabbits. Run, run.
Fucking cowards.
- What would Bartolome do?
- Piss off.
Yeah, lots of yaku, lots of
"poor Indians," and now what?
Fuck them!
What can we do?
They're telling you!
Go to a safe place and finish our work!
That's what we have to do!
We owe it to them! l promise this place is safe. l spoke to them 15 minutes ago.
They've hired private security.
We'll pack essentials and get out before we're trapped.
The roads are still clear.
Yes, but I don't know for how long.
Please, really...
I’m begging you.
I’m going.
Come on!
Come on, guys.
Yes?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Can you hear me, Costa?
We're leaving now.
Okay, perfect.
We're leaving, too.
Get a move on. Don't wait for us.
We'll catch up.
Bye.
They're about to close the road.
We have to go now!
Everyone into the cars!
Come on, we're going!
Who's left?
Shit, wardrobe!
It’s always the same! Let's go!
Teresa, what's wrong? l came to ask you a favor.
My daughter ran off.
She was playing with her friends, and they went off to the demonstration.
- The demonstration?
- And now she's hurt.
They rang me from the post office.
She's hurt?
Some neighbors called me and told me she's injured.
How could you leave Belen in the middle of this?
If we don't go, she might die.
Please, help me!
Help me get her to the hospital.
Please.
She's bleeding badly.
I’m desperate.
I don't know what to do.
- I’m begging you, please.
- All right, I’ll send someone now.
No, not someone else!
They won't let anyone through.
The police are there.
No one can get past them, but maybe you can.
But I can't go.
I’m about to leave with the crew.
Who else can I turn to?
There's no one else.
- There's only you.
- What's wrong?
Help me, I’m begging you, please.
I’m begging you.
Wait here.
- Something's happened to Belen.
- What?
I don't know.
She's been hurt.
Fuck!
She asked me to go with her.
No, you're not going anywhere.
It’s a war zone, Costa.
- But she asked me.
- You can't do anything!
Don't fuck me about!
Tell her you're not going.
We need you with us!
Please, Costa.
- I’ll send someone, okay, Teresa?
- You have to help me, please.
Help me.
Don't leave me like this.
No one else is any use.
They won't get through. l can't go, Teresa.
I’m responsible for the whole crew. l can't leave them now. l can't do it, Teresa!
Come on, let's fucking go!
- Let's go!
- Please, you're a friend.
Wait here.
Just a second, Bruno.
Just a second.
- I’m taking Belen to the hospital.
- No, no, you're crazy!
No, Costa, listen to me!
This confrontation is going to end, and it'll be forgotten.
But our film is going to last forever.
Please, come with us. If anything happens to you, we're all fucked!
- Listen, listen, listen.
- No, no!
Listen to me for once in your life!
If anything happens to that child,
I’ll never forgive myself.
The army is on its way!
They'll crush everyone! You too!
- I can't leave the child there!
- What can you do? l can't leave her there.
- Help me out, man, please.
- Fuck!
Help me, Sebastian, please!
You go with the crew. l just can't leave that child. l can't.
You go with them.
Teresa, come on.
It’s blocked!
There's no way through.
Go down there.
- This way?
- Yes, go down there. l can see the Water Company building.
I’m at the corner.
One block away. l can see the flagpole.
The soldiers are entrenched behind their shields.
They're armed with rifles, tear gas, rubber bullets, or something worse, l can't see clearly.
But behind me, the image is an incredible sight.
Young and old, people of all ages from the city, peasants and coca growers are lining up. l think they're going to the charge.
There must be 2,000 of them, and more are flooding in from the side streets.
Here they go!
A citizens' army with sticks for weapons!
What do we do?
I’ll talk to them.
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
The army is firing with live ammo!
I’ve seen a dozen drop, but the demonstrators still charge.
Rocks against bullets!
Bodies fall all around me.
Dozens of injured.
Fuck, Costa, answer!
Pull over, Mister.
We'll never get out of here, guys.
No fucking way!
Shit. Fuck.
Get down!
Belen, love, what did they do to you?
What did they do to you?
I’m here, love.
- Are you relatives?
- That's her mother. How is she?
She's getting worse.
She's very weak.
I’ve got a car. We can take her and others to the hospital.
No, the roads are blocked by the police.
How will you get through?
- With money, that always works.
- Yes?
All right.
Belen, it's Costa.
Where's Dad?
Don't worry, love, he'll be here soon.
I’m here now, you're not alone. l can't feel my leg.
Belen, can you hear me?
We're taking you to the hospital.
What the hell's going on?
Can't you see we're working?
The others are out.
What are they up to?
You're a moron, shut up!
Bastard!
He broke his neck!
Calm down! Calm down!
- Bastard!
- Shut up!
What the fuck is this?
Look out the fucking window!
Just look out the window!
What the hell are we doing here?
Look at that! That's it.
Sebastian, we're getting out.
We've decided.
We're going to the airport.
It’s over, Sebastian.
Can you not see?
I’m staying.
Sebastian, I’m sorry, look, it's over.
We're going.
Maria, we're going with them.
We're going, Maria.
I’ve got your case.
Sebastian, come on.
So stubborn.
Are you going, too?
I’m sorry.
Come on, Sebastian.
- Anton?
- No one's waiting for me.
Hey, you! You can't speak to the prisoners!
- Can I see her?
- Yes, on you go.
Doctor, how is she?
Got her just in time.
She lost a lot of blood, but she's stable.
She'll pull through.
- The thing is...
- What?
We saved her leg, but it's badly damaged.
She'll have problems walking, if at all... l have to find her father.
Thank you, Doctor.
Where's the army?
Stop the fighting.
The water is yours.
Stop the fighting.
The water is yours.
How's Belen?
You're in the news everywhere.
"Multinational pulls out of Bolivia after water war."
That's you.
It always costs us dear.
It’s never easy. l wish there was another way.
But there's not.
And the toughest bit is still to come.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Help Sebastian finish this.
Somehow.
Somewhere.
But I don't know how.
And you, Daniel, what are you going to do?
Survive, like always.
It’s what we do best.
Listen, Daniel, I’m going to help you with Belen, I promise.
Will you come back?
I don't think so.
It’s a gift.
Thank you.
You saved my daughter's life. l won't forget that.
Listen, I have to go, okay?
Take good care.
Please.
Take care.
You too.
Yaku.
Brother Man, we're here
I'm sorry to be such a bother
Don't mention it
This place has been idle for a few months.
I've informed the owners, they are nice folks
Thank you
Is this suitable for your school?
Wow, this place is huge!
Is this ok?
Yes, yes
Very spacious...
Master Yip
You haven't gotten any disciples yet?
What's up, 3rd Aunt?
You have such a big place here.
I'd like to hang my laundry here
Sure, no problem
Yong
Sigh, I told you before... let me do this
I don't know what to do with you
There'll be no more water left by the time you come
Then I'll come back earlier next time. Let me do these chores
I've told you not to exert yourself
How are you feeling?
Mama, I need to pay school fees
Ok, hang on
Who's that?
Pay your rent! Mr and Mrs Yip!
Don't open the door. We don't have enough money for rent
Mr and Mrs Yip! Pay your rent
Master Yip, still no students?
I'll go hang my laundry...
Let me help you...
Thank you very much!
Hey, are you the one teaching Wing Chun?
Master Yip! Someone's here to learn kung fu!
You wish to learn Wing Chun?
I don't even know what Wing Chun is
Then let me tell you. Wing Chun is the Southern art of close combat....
Enough! Spar with me. If I lose, I'll be your student
Fine
Wing Chun. Yip Man
So, what do you think?
You haven't won yet
Do you yield?
Yield? I don't even know what you're doing
Do you know now?
Master Yip, I didn't know you're so skilful! Fantastic!
Hey, young man! You should be his disciple!
I think you can start paying tuition fees now
Hey! How can you leave like that?
Master Yip, what now? Your potential student is gone
That's him
How good can his kung fu be?
Would I lie to you?
He looks like he couldn't even hurt a fly
If you hadn't told me, I'd have thought he's just a laundryman
You're not really here to learn kung fu. Please leave
Ok, then we'll fight you
No need to take them off
Why not?
Oh, nevermind
The Yip Man Palm
Told you not to take off your shirts...
Master! I am Huang Liang, please take me as a disciple!
- Master, I am Xiu Shi Chang!
- Wei Guo Jian
- Wang Kun
Please accept us as students!
Eh, I asked first. You must address me as "Eldest Brother"
Serve tea to Master!
No need to trouble yourselves
Pay tuition fees first
In Wing Chun, we attack and defend in one motion
Attack, and defend
To disable an opponent in the shortest time
This is block and attack
Block and attack
Follow up with a dozen quick punches
Understand?
Who is Master Yip?
Master!
Liang, did you ask them to come?
Master, do you think you can fight off 10 men?
The best thing is not to fight at all
Continue training
What if they use weapons?
Run
Time to collect tuition fees
Ok
You always say that
I will collect soon
Hang on a sec
What's up?
It's time to pay tuition fees
What's happening?
Time to pay tuition fees
If you have the money, please pay up
Here you go Master
Master, I can only pay $2... My mother... she needs the money. I'll pay the rest later
Pay next time... next time
Go home for dinner
Bye Master
It's so little... what shall we do?
No choice. You also know things aren't so good now
The students asked for help, I can't refuse
Then we need to appeal to the landlady
Yes, things will work out eventually
2 pieces of cake please
- You want the egg tarts?
- No, thanks
Stop! Hold it right there!
Thief! Return it to me!
Please don't beat up my dad
No money? Then we'll get him
Please let him go!
Stop, stop! Don't beat him up
What's happening?
He stole our roasted duck
I'll pay for him
Give it here!
Let's go
Jin Quan?
Uncle Man, I know where Dad is
Bring me to him
Here
Jin Quan!
Uncle Man, he doesn't recognise anyone
The Japanese shot him in the head once. He doesn't recognise anyone anymore
Jin Quan, I'm Yip
Jin Quan!
Get away! Get out! Go! Go!
Let's go, Uncle Man
It's my fault. I did this to you
Let's go
My dad hasn't chased me away yet
That's why I'm still here
On good days I can get odd jobs and buy food back
On bad days, we starve
Don't worry, Kwan
I'll help you take care of him
Since you are recommended by
Master Yip, I'll definitely hire you
Kid, if you agree to half salary, you can start now
No problem
Have a seat. I'll arrange work for you
Brother Man, don't leave. I'll treat you to tea
Thank you
Don't mention it
Have a seat
This is good
Thank you Uncle Man
Kwan, you must work hard
I will
What do you think? I can bring you there later
I'm from Hong School. I don't need to learn from you!
Since you aren't interested, why tear my posters down?
I don't care what you learn. You're blocking my poster
Want to know what Wing Chun is?
You're looking for trouble?
We won't bully you
One on one. No helping!
Ok
Also, don't poke eyes
Enough talk. I'm in a hurry
So you yield?
No!
No?
Do you yield?
When you strike, don't move from this line
Relax
Relax more
Who is Yip Man?
Yes?
Your disciple Liang has beaten up our brother
We took him hostage. Bring money to rescue him at the fish market
Let's go
Brother Jin
Are you his Master?
That's right
I believe it's just a misunderstanding
Let's talk it over
Can you release my disciple?
Release him!
Are you all right?
I'm fine
Why did you beat him up?
We sparred and he lost. It's not my fault
What? I can't beat you?
Don't be rash
You're all young men
Sometimes you get minor injuries during sparring
Next time I'll come specially to clarify things with your Master
May I know who your Master is?
You don't need to know who he is.
He's better than you
Enough talk. Did you bring the money?
No
Don't be rash
Attack!
Behind you!
Chop him up!
Master!
Liang!
Master! I'm here
Master, you really can beat up more than 10 men!
Only if we can escape
Stay close to me
Follow me!
Go, Liang
Go!
Jin Shan Zhao?
Nobody move!
What are you doing?
Master Yip, you are free to go
Thanks
You're asking for it!
Break it up!
Master!
You stirring up trouble again?
No, Master
I was sparring with him, but he brought his Master here to intimidate us
Ji
You trying to be Big Brother here?
No of course not
Big Brother Hong, let's talk things over
You want to talk with a knife in your hand?
No, no
That son of a bitch tried to cause trouble on my turf. That's why I was....
This isn't your turf
This is my road. Your patch of ground is mine.
So you tell me, whose turf is this?
It's yours, of course
You can leave now. It's not your concern
Which style and school are you?
Greetings Master Hong. I'm Yip Man of the Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan
The situation is like this. My disciple sparred with yours
My disciple definitely went too far and injured your disciple
You're saying my Hong style is inferior?
I didn't mean it like that
Who allowed you to teach martial arts? Do you know the rules?
I don't know of any rules
Ok I'll tell you the rules now
You must accept challenges from the various schools
If you win, then you are fit to teach martial arts
So now you know the rules for opening a martial arts school
Enough talk. There are rules for martial arts schools, and then there are rules of Law
Now that you're done
Wan, Po! Take these 2 into custody
I have a spare set of handcuffs. Arrest him too
Huh? Me too?
Master!
Stop squirming! Let's go
Move it
Settle your affairs, and let's go in. The Chief is waiting
Sir
The Chief is asking about the manpower and security arrangements
Everything is arranged. No problems
So how much will I get for the competition?
Please excuse us a moment
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
So how much is his cut? You tell me, I'll tell Master Hong
Speak!
Are you going to tell me?
Don't worry. These cops are just strutting around acting tough
It'll be ok once we make bail
Master Jin, I'm sorry to get you involved
I'm sorry to get you involved today
Hang on a bit
I'm deaf in this ear after you wacked me there the other time
So what were you saying?
I said, I'm sorry to get you involved today
It's nothing
If it weren't for your wake up call the other time
I don't know what I'll do here in Hong Kong
Open up, Police!
Open up!
What's wrong?
Any of Yip Man's relatives here?
I'm his wife
Your husband is arrested for fighting
Bring money to bail him out
Mr Liang! Mr Liang!
Mr Liang!
What's wrong, Mrs Yip?
Please save my husband! I don't have enough money for bail
Wait here
It's very troublesome to open a martial arts school here in Hong Kong
There's too many schools, too many masters
Too many rules too
And that Master Hong has many supporters
Many disciples, and a lot of money
So what? I'll get him once I'm out of here
I'll destroy his fish stall and poison all his fish!
What's the difference between you and them, then?
Hey kid, you fight pretty good
I'm not a kid!
Which part of me looks like a kid?
Liang! Don't use that tone
Master Jin is your elder
It's all right, he's young
He reminds me of myself when I was young
If you want him to turn out well, get him a wife
Just like me... wife, kids, family. It changes a man
I want to post bail for my husband
What's his name?
Yip Man
Did you bring the money?
Yes, here
Yip Man, you're free to go
Hurry up
I'm here to bail Jin out
Wife!
Brother, please open the door
Quickly!
That's my wife
Liang, is anyone coming for you?
No
Don't worry Master. They'll release me in a couple of days
You go on
I won't be able to see you out
Brother Geng, I need to impose on you again
I want to bail my disciple out
Is it ok?
Brother Man, I didn't bring enough money
Master Yip
Master Yip, wait a bit
Wife, do you have any money?
What do you need it for?
It's an emergency
You're always like this. No money!
Help people out here, Wife
This is the last time
Mum's the best!
Master Yip, here's the money
I'll return it to you as soon as I can. Thank you
No problem, don't mention it
It's so difficult to open a school here.
Why don't you just give up?
I'll just have to go visit the other masters. It's nothing
I don't want to worry every day like before
We made it through the war, there's nothing to worry about
Don't dwell on it. Go to sleep
I've fought this type of matches many times before
They were blades below then, not stools
Have you heard of this Yip Man before?
The name means nothing to me. No
I'm sure he's no match for you, Master Luo
Likewise, Master Zhang
Will you be going up there?
I'll go if you go
Enough talk. Let's drink tea
Cheers
Master
He's here
Fellow Masters
This is Yip Man
He wants to establish his sect here in Hong Kong
That's why he's here today to accept your challenges
Yip Man
If you surrender, you lose
If you leave the table, you lose
If you're the last man standing on the table after all the challenges
I'll greet you as "Master Yip"
If there are no questions, we can begin
What, he's just going to walk up to the table?
He's not supposed to touch the ground
Greetings fellow masters. I am Yip Man
I'm from Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan
I hope my fellow masters will go easy on me
Which master will have a go?
Master Luo, aren't you going?
I'll wait and see if anyone else is going first
Fine then, I'll be the first
Please
Please
Lightning Kick
Beware, brother
Are you all right Master Luo?
I'm fine!
He'd be dead if it were blades below
This is too much
The table is really slippery!
Thank you for going easy
Come on, don't let him stop
Master Zhang, your turn
Master Zhang, go on... go on
Master Zhang, the table is really very slippery
Please
Please
I yield!
Thank you for showing mercy
Thank you for going easy on me
Any other masters want to have a go?
Please
Please
Master Yip
Master Hong
To join this association, you must pay a monthly fee
What fees?
It's the rules. Everyone pays $100 a month
Pay and you'll have no trouble
If there's any masters that still think
I'm not worthy, I'm game anytime
But I won't fulfil your personal financial interests by paying this "fee"
As you wish. Don't look for me if you're in trouble next time
You may go now
Medication
Master, here's the medication
Are you insane? Drawing these on my newspaper?
I just wanted readers to understand the content
Is the feedback that bad?
Everyone in Hong Kong now wants to learn Wing Chun!
This is fantastic!
Continue the drawings. I'm counting on you
Get back to work!
Well done! Good job!
Mei, stop doing your homework. Eat
Eat first, ok?
Wife, more porridge please
You've not been eating well lately. Eat more
Where are you going?
You blind? I'm going up to do my laundry
Are you really just doing your laundry?
What do you think this big basin is for? Washing my head?
Where are you headed?
To learn Wing Chun
Wing Chun? It's not here
The newspapers say it's here
No it's not. Go away!
You're better off learning Hong style
Hey!
You bunch of rascals are preventing people from learning Wing Chun!
You son of a bitch!
Come down!
What are you doing?
You deaf?
Come down!
What? No, you come up
Come down if you have the guts
Come down if you dare!
You're crazy! So unbecoming!
Look, Wing Chun disciples!
Attack!
They're coming down
Hurry
Come out!
The owners are thinking twice after what happened today
I understand
They've decided not to lend this rooftop to you anymore
I understand. I'm sorry
I'm sorry too. I'll be going now
Goodbye
Bye, Brother Geng
Master...
I'm sure you know by now
We can't train here anymore
Master, it's not our fault! They started it!
Yes they started it
Let's go look for them to settle this
Pack this place up before you go
Bring the wooden men to my house
Master...
Ji
Give these to the disciples. They've earned it
Thank you Master
- Here's yours.
- Thanks
Good work everyone
You still dare to show up here?
I'm here to see your Master
Ji... you may all retire
So, your school in a bit of a jam?
I'm here to tell you that I'll continue teaching martial arts even without a school
And I'll never pay you a single cent!
Don't ever harass my disciples again
And don't get other people involved
You are causing trouble by not following the rules
If it weren't for me placating the Westerners
Do you think everyone else can teach martial arts in peace?
You chose to collude with the Westerners
Yip Man, you only think about yourself
You don't have 200 disciples, of course you don't need the blessings of the Westerners
Of course you can take it easy
I understand what you're saying
As Masters, aren't we are obligated to guide our own disciples first?
My conscience is clear
As you wish. If you're upset with me in the future, come directly to me
Goodbye!
Hold it!
You're not leaving that easily
What do you want then?
We did not finish our match earlier.
It's time to finish it
Watch out!
Husband, we've been waiting for you to start dinner
The children are hungry. Are you finished discussing business?
Master Hong, do you think it's more important to have dinner with your family, or to finish the match?
What does everyone want to eat?
Ice cream!!
I'll bring you all out for ice cream after dinner
I'll take my leave, Master Hong
Please see yourself out
Master
Come in
Put it over there
Here, over here
Why are the wooden men brought back home?
The rooftop is being rented to someone else
So I've brought them home
Ok, you go on home. We'll start training here tomorrow morning
- Train here?
- Yes
Be here early tomorrow morning
Bye Master
Go home and relax
Goodbye Master
Master, I wish to talk to you
Have some tea, Liang
Have a seat
Master, it's my fault that you lost the school. I'm sorry
Please, get up
Get up
Come, sit down and we'll talk
Liang, do you think I'm very skilful?
Of course! You can fight off 10 men!
What about 20 years later?
In 20 year's time, you can beat me easily
People will grow old
No one's invincible forever in this world
Actually, you have a knack for martial arts
However, you're only focusing on the fighting techniques
I want to you to understand the spirit in Chinese martial arts
It enbodies the Chinese heart, mind and soul
Understand?
I'm trying to
Want to hear a story?
Years ago, I smacked the butt of that Master Jin we met in jail
Back at Fo Shan, he came to my house to fight me and messed my place up, so.....
Are you practicing kung fu?
Yes, I'll teach you when you grow up
Come on let's go
Master, look
Continue your practice
Fancy meeting you here
I was in the neighbourhood
What do you want?
I have extra tickets, and wondered if you'd like to come too
It's a Western boxing match
Goodbye
Master Hong, your eyes are red
Are you all right?
Oh I've had it since morning. I'm probably coming down with something
I'll be fine after some herbal tea
This is a nice place for training
Place 3 rows here
3 rows over there too
Hurry up
Master Hong
Come over and say hi. I'll introduce you to the Champion
Hello
Ignore him. Westerners like to leave things around
So when will we get our money?
He keeps avoiding the subject
Do it for free this time
Free? My men stopped working at the fish stall to set this place up!
Don't be upset, or else there'll be trouble. Take it as going on a diet
This isn't the first time
Master Hong!
Chief
It's ok not to pay me. However my men need to eat. You have to pay them
Don't speak to me about money now
If not money, then love?
Now you've made him angry
If he's not paying, I'm quitting
If you quit, he'll take your fish stall too. Just bear with it
Bear with it? I've tolerated it for a long time!
Speak Chinese, not English!
You heard him. Let's go
We quit too! Let's go
Let's go
Hold on!
Look, they'll get in trouble because of you
You guys stay and work
Let's get back to work
Come on
Don't be angry. He will get his retribution
- Master Yip
- Master Hong
Thank you for the tickets
There will be a demonstration of kung fu from every school on stage later
Please ask your disciples to show yours off
Let more people learn about your Wing Chun
Yes of course
See you later
Hey you, get ready
- You 2 go up too
- Ok
Go up and join them
Let's go
This isn't good
It's not your money that is used to promote Chinese martial arts
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
Break it up! Stop fighting!
What do we do?
Everyone, stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
Break it up!
Stop!
Stop fighting!
Stop it!
Calm down!
Stop fighting!
Calm down!
Everyone please calm down
Liang!
Bring him down
Xin, help please
Slowly! Slowly!
Come here, MC
If you don't like our demonstration, you are free to leave
But you've caused injuries, you need to apologise
I will fight!
I will flatten him to the ground!
Until he apologises!
Kill the Westerner!
Fellow masters, leave this to me
Everyone please stand down
Fine, we'll stand down
Thank you
Master Hong, are you good?
I'm good, no problem
In the next round, don't go head on with him. Attack his biceps
It won't be that easy
Oh no! Master's having an asthma attack
Please stop the fight, Master Hong
I won't let these Westerners belittle us
Don't get maimed just for pride
I can tolerate if it's only my life
But not if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world
Master...
Master, yield!
Master!
Master Hong, I have the utmost respect for you
- What's happening?
- Sit down!
None of your business. Sit down
Who's the editor?
What's up?
Arrest him
Sir!
Please don't!
No, please!
No!
Sir!
It won't look good for you. He'll continue to give you bad press if you continue the beatings
I will deal with him. Leave it to me
Fat Aunt, you must set him straight
How can he say such things?
The Chinese don't use joss sticks just to mark time
The Chinese practice of burning joss sticks
Other than measuring time, and more importantly, it is to honour our ancestors
It's the Chinese culture
Mr Milos
I challenge you
Chun, eat quickly. Don't let Mrs Fang wait
I'll see you off later
Mama, why must we stay over at Mrs Fang's?
Because Daddy wants to train
Here, let me
- Sorry for the trouble
- It's no trouble
The boy is Yip Chun
Mr Yip, you must beat that Westerner!
I'll bring these in first
Don't worry about us. Concentrate on your training
But don't stay up too late
You must win
Let's go
You go on home
Normally I live alone. Just make yourselves at home
This is your bed
It's ok. Continue
I said, continue!
What's wrong?
Police!
What are you writing?
Still dare to write?
Not afraid of another beating?
"Wing Chun Master accepts challenge to a Western boxing match"
Do you think that's good enough?
Why not "Western Dog Soundly Defeated"?
"Reporter endures Police brutality for the truth"
But did you get the truth?
I have the truth!
You have guts. I'll give you the truth and you write about him till he is ruined
Ok, ok!
That Chief hates us Chinese. Always bullies us
I'll break the real news to you, you report it. It will finish him off!
Mrs Yip, what's wrong?
Oh you're in labour! Chun, go fetch your father!
No, I don't want to distract him
Then I'll go get a midwife
Chun, take care of your mom
Master Zhang, over there!
The Hong Kong Chinese-Western Boxing Match will start soon
The hall is packed with both Chinese and Westerners
It's very lively here
There are Chinese judges in the judging panel this time
Hopefully it will be a truly fair and impartial match
Don't go away folks!
I tell you, he'll go down in 3 strikes
No, I mean he'll defeat the Westener in 3 strikes
Master Yip, are you confident of beating him?
You must win!
Are you fighting for yourself, or for Chinese martial arts?
The Twister is making an entrance
Good! Yip Man can't wait to kick his ass
Master...
Master Yip, kick his ass like how you kicked mine!
Anyone can kick your ass
Shut up!
Both of them are sizing each other up
Master Yip!
Master!
Master Yip has been knocked down! They're going to start the knockout count
Master Yip! Get up!
He appears to be injured. I'm not sure if he can even stand up
Master Yip seems ok, and he's up
This time it's The Twister that's knocked down
Good work, Master!
That bloody Westerner... still standing even after so many hits
Master Yip is attacking with his Wing Chun
(chanting) Master Yip! Master Yip! Master Yip!
Hey that's cheating!
You animal! The bell has gone!
Master, Master!
Master!
Master!
Oh my God! Master Yip is down after a knockout blow from The Twister!
Master, get up!
Get up! Get up!
Get up, Master!
"We cannot allow the Westerners to belittle us"
"I can bear it if it's just my life"
"But I cannot tolerate it if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world"
"Master Hong, don't go head on with him. Attack his biceps"
"It won't be that easy"
Daddy's won! Daddy's won! Yay!
I know Yip Man!
Dude, everyone here knows Yip Man
Huo Yan Jia, Huang Fei Hong, Yip Man and me. The 4 Dragons of Fo Shan!
Master Yip!
What do you want to do now?
I want to go home
He looks like you
What shall we call him?
How about Yip Ching?
I want him to be an upright person
Ok
He looks like you
Uncle Man
I have a new friend, and he wants to learn kung fu from you
Come in
I want to learn from you. How much?
What's your name?
I'm Bruce Lee
Why do you want to learn how to fight?
So that I can beat up people I don't like
Very spirited
Come back when you've grown up
(Yip Man spent the next 22 years teaching Wing Chun and spreading it all over the world)

This film is the result of historical and journalistic research.
Because of controversial gray areas in Carlos' life, the film must be viewed as a fiction tracing two decades in the life of a notorious terrorist.
His relations with other characters have been fictionalized as well.
The three murders in Rue Toullier are the only events depicted in this film for which Ilich Ramírez Sánchez was tried and sentenced.
The Drugstore Publicis bombing is still under investigation.
Got time for breakfast?
I have to be at the theatre by 8.
Doubts remain as to the origin of the explosion
that killed Mohammed Boudia,
but the political context of the incident is clear.
Boudia was a fervent partisan of the Palestinian cause.
some people even maintain
he ran the "Black September" terror cell in France.
Arab sources place this car bombing
in the series of assassinations
undertaken by Israeli secret service
that claimed the life last January of a Fatah delegate in Paris.
Beirut, one month later
Don't drive in circles.
I know Beirut.

Head of the PFLP in Europe
Are you André?
Come in.
We'll work together.
You in London, me in Paris.
Tell me nothing.
No address, no number.
Choose a contact you trust, who can serve as a mailbox.
Can you use one?
I'm used to more serious weapons.
This is all I can offer.
Five?
That's all?
London, a few days later
Something to drink?
Whisky.
I'll get it.
- Hurry and get that done.
- I know.
- Is he punished?
- No, but I stay on his case.
Having trouble at school?
- I failed a test.
- Why?
I don't concentrate.
Why not?
I told you O-levels were hard.
Anyway, if I flunk,
I'll do like you.
How's that?
Teach Spanish.
At least it's my language.
What do you mean?
I have a degree in Economy.
- From Moscow University!
- And?
It's worthless!
- Says who?
- Mom.
You told him that?
You can't deny it, Ilich.
No respect!
The chairman of the retailer
Marks and Spencer
was seriously wounded yesterday this home
when a masked man fired at him.
Vice-President of the Zionist Federation,
Sieff has publicly sided with the Israeli cause.
PLO spokesman
You skipped the demonstration against Pinochet's coup.
They bore me shitless and serve no purpose.
Demonstrations never change a thing.
Chileans need to know we're behind them.
The Chilean generals and the CIA don't care.
Where did picketing the coup in Uruguay get us?
They're still killing the Tupamaros. It's war.
It can't be won by picketing.
How then?
There are other methods.
Such as?
Words get us nowhere.
It's time for action.
What kind of action?
We have to commit.
Commit to what?
To the revolution.
How do you mean?
By covert actions?
By resistance.
I've formed a group.
I want you to join us.
What kind of group?
I can't tell you yet.
But we're not nihilists.
We want to do good.
Ilich, fighting capitalism with guerrilla means is romantic, but doomed to failure.
No more desperate causes.
They lead nowhere.
- So we do nothing?
- Is that what I do?
You talk politics in London cafes.
Is that the answer?
While they kill our comrades in Chile and Jordan.
I told you what I saw.
The balance of power is against us.
- A myth.
- Not true. Look at Che!
He ended up dead.
Despite his experience!
Why fight the right in Latin America?
You think Latin American dictators operate alone?
Gringos pull the strings.
Overthrow them and imperialism still wins!
I'm advocating an internationalist struggle uniting revolutionaries the world over.
Look how the Vietcong disgraced the gringos.
Squashed them Like shit.
The balance of power isn't against us.
The fight I propose will lead us to glory.
Glory? That's what you want.
To be admired!
That's what drives you.
Bourgeois arrogance hidden behind revolutionary rhetoric!
Just another selfish, two-bit petit-bourgeois!
I'm talking about true glory.
Not what the Zionist media drones on about.
But the pleasure of doing one's duty in silence.
Behind every bullet we fire, there will be an idea.
Because we act in harmony with our conscience.
You say I'm arrogant?
I guess I am.
For defending the innocent.
You know what?
Look at me when I talk!
You'll be hearing my name a lot.
What's more, it's no longer Ilich.
It's Carlos.
DST- Head ofanti-terrorism
French Customs. This way, please.
Come here.
What happened?
Our Japanese comrades were arrested.
We have to act fast.
Is everything ready?
This way.
It's all in here.
You'll take that suitcase to London.
Today.
What's in it?
What?
Weapons.
And documents.
Keep it at your place until I come back.
Paris is no longer safe.
Now we meet André.
There's something you should know.
In Beirut they don't trust him.
He got orders to share his duties with me.
With you?
I thought you were too young.
I've shown them what I'm worth.
From now on, follow only my instructions.
Why is she here?
She's taking the vallse to London by train.
- Any news from the Japanese?
- None.
He's not picking up.
The hideout was found.
The network's down.
There's nothing on them.
They'll be deported.
Furuya talked. For sure.
I got instructions from Beirut.
The Japanese there are hysterical.
He knows too much.
They want him back.
We'll help.
Why us?
At Lod Airport, they died for our cause.
We have a debt.
The Hague, Netherlands
Afewdays later
French Embassy in the Netherlands
It's right here.
Turn left at the next light.
We missed the street.
Go back and make a left.
The Ambassador's car!
We're late. Carlos left.
- What now?
- We go anyway.
Let's go.
Who are they?
I found him!
Just before 5 o'clock this afternoon
a commando of 3 members of the Japanese Red Army
stormed the French Embassy in the Hague
and took the Ambassador hostage, with 8 members of his staff
The Red Army immediately stated its demand:
the liberation of one of their men
from the Santé Prison in Paris.
Yes, I'll ask them.
Gentlemen, the news is bad.
They said no to a chemical toilet.
Given the circumstances, it would have come in handy.
Paris, Santé Prison
Head oftheAnti-Gang Brigade
Tell this dickhead if anyone gets hurt,
I'll blow his brains out.
With the approval of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.
Tonight the commando expressed further demands.
They want France to give them 1 million dollars as wellas the use of a Boeing jet.
They'll take the Ambassador with them after releasing the other hostages.
I understand the technical difficulties, but their leader seems to care less.
If the ultimatum isn't met in an hour,
I can confirm that the commando has chosen its first target: the Ambassador.
That is, myself.
Very well.
Paris,the nextday
What are these dumb Japs up to?
- What's going on?
- Time's up. No one's dead.
- Isn't Furuya in Holland?
- So what?
There's no plane or crew!
It's useless.
- What will you do?
- Act for them.
Algerian-style.
Sudden bloody terror.
It happened at 5:20p.m.
when the Drugstore St-Germain is packed.
According to witnesses, the assailant,
in the 2nd-floor restaurant,
threw a grenade to the floor below.
We didn'tsee corpses
but we saw lots of women and kids lying in pools of blood.
The police took them away.
AFP?
I attacked, in the name of the Japanese Red Army, the Drugstore owned by the Jew,
Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet.
Strike a deal with our comrades within 24 hours or a movie theatre will be next.
This will be the only warning.
This Red Army is already notorious.
Recall, for example, the carnage at the Lod Airport in Tel Aviv
which left 26 dead and 86 wounded in 1972.
The fanaticism of the Red Army...
I understand. I'll tell them.
At 10:30p.m. yesterday, after much suspense,
the Air France jet left the Amsterdam airport.
On board: the 3 Japanese terrorists armed with guns
plus Furuya and a ransom of 300,000 dollars.
Thatis, one and a half million francs.
Paris, two months later
Like I said, revolution is underway.
Thanks to a real, internationalist coalition.
I want to be part of it.
Welcome aboard.
In Colombia the April 19th Movement went underground.
You know their motto.
"For the people, with the arms, to the power!"
This is where I work.
Doing what?
I clean houses.
Three times a week.
But it's fine.
Need any money? I can help.
How?
I can't say now but...
I'll help.
No more humiliating jobs.
YasserArafatatthe U.N.
I come bearing an olive branch
and a freedom fighter's gun.
Do not let the olive branch fall from my hands.
German Revolutionary Cells
It's taking off!
Reuters?
I'm the spokesman for the Mohammed Boudia Commando.
This was just a warning.
Next time, the Zionist airline El-Al wilI be less lucky.
Okay, pal?
Yes, boss.
Let's go.
There's a line.
- What happened?
- I got held up.
In minutes,
Orly was surrounded.
Reinforcements arrived quickly.
In the evening, the Home secretary,
Michel Poniatowski, showed up.
A piece ofpaper slipped under the restroom door
stated the commando's demands..
a plane for tomorrow at 8a.m.
The operation's a failure.
And we weren't even mentioned!
Don't worry.
The message was sent.
Arafat knows we won't let him compromise.
He wants to punish the commando!
Don't worry about them.
They'll get a plane.
They'll leave for Bagdad.
The Iraqis won't let them land!
It'll show they're involved.
No other capital will take them.
They won't abandon us.
They're committed.
All night long, negotiations continue.
In the morning, a deal is struck.
A mother and child are set free.
The others will soon be let go.
And the plane leaves with the terrorists.
What's in there?
A Tokarev.
A Vzor 50.
Are you scared?
Why are you scared?
Weapons are meant to be touched... and treated gently.
Touch it.
A grenade.
You didn't learn this in Venezuela!
What's so funny?
You.
Why?
You and women...
You and guns.
That makes you laugh?
Weapons are an extension of my body.
Like my arms.
I learned that at training camp in the Bekaa Plain.
What else?
I also learned that... to kill, you have to act fast and aim straight at the nose.
I'll leave it here for a week.
You don't know what's inside.
I'll keep the key.
Beirut Airport
You travel to Europe often.
I told you.
I import oriental rugs.
Don't you think we know?
You were at Wadi Haddad's.
I don't work for him.
So why were you there?
- I'm a middleman.
- A middleman?
For whom?
Nourredine.
Who is Nourredine?
PFLP delegate in Europe.
Nourredine who?
I don't know.
I know only his first name.
You contact him?
No, he contacts me.
Only when he needs me.
Does he pay you too?
Answer the question!
No one pays me.
It's for the Palestinian cause.
Your tip was good.
He works for Haddad.
We have nothing on him.
Fake passports.
Not enough to keep him.
So let him go.
They'll pick him up in Paris.
- And his bag?
- I'll send Xeroxes to the DST.
Anselma...
She's gone?
Yesterday, for London.
And she kicked me out.
Really?
Yes. And she left you a letter.
- Not reading it?
- No. No time.
- I know what it says.
- What?
Insults.
She's upset I slept with you.
Petit-bourgeois!
When we all slept together, she was liberated.
I can't touch her now.
She put a curtain between our beds.
Help me with the guns.
They're not safe here.
We have to move them.
Get the bags from the bathroom.
Didn't you lose your keys?
Is that what I said?
When I kicked you out.
Well, I guess I found them.
Thanks.
Why?
For helping me.
Despite everything.
I'm not doing it for you.
It's for the revolution.
What happened?
Your other mistresses dump you?
Someone important was arrested in Beirut.
None of my hideouts is safe now.
Why me?
No one knows your address.
I can't be traced here.
Can I know what's inside?
Don't ask. I'll lie.
If I keep it, you tell me.
- I can't.
- Why not?
If you're questioned, you won't know.
A favor for a friend.
Okay.
Go get me cigarettes.
Please.
You took a direct fllght.
- One lay-over is the rule.
- It would have changed nothing.
Says who?
- Someone gave my name.
- Who?
I don't know.
Mossad.
What's this bullshit?
The Mossad ID'd you?
Why did they let you go?
I said I was a middleman.
- They didn't buy it.
- They have nothing.
Some fake passports.
Where are the documents?
Here, with me.
We have to put them in a safe place.
They don't know you. You'll do it.
I have a safety deposit box.
I'll erase our traces in Geneva and in London.
London, HeathrowAirport
No news.
He said he'd call you from London.
I waited two hours, then I went out.
He got nabbed at Customs. For sure.
I spoke to Haddad.
He's disbanding the European network.
It's getting too risky.
Paris, Orly Airport
I just got in.
I dropped my bags off.
André disappeared.
Is he in Lebanon?
He panicked.
- Maybe he's hiding.
- Exactly. What crap.
He's getting worse and worse.
- Don't overdo it.
- I'm not, Nydia.
He puts us at risk.
Look what happened at Orly!
He's irresponsible!
- You never complained before.
- I was dumb!
But I warned them about him.
This asshole's dangerous.
I've said it for a while.
German Revolutionary Cells
Safe trip.
Police!
Know him?
I've never seen him.
He was at your place.
He had your keys.
A German lawyer.
He does favors for comrades.
He's a good guy.
No reason to make trouble for him.
Find anything on the German?
Just the fake passport.
Says he's helping anti-Franco militants.
We'll deport him after the interrogation.
- And the Lebanese?
- The hearing is on Monday.
I want to finish tonight.
I'm seeing my family this weekend.
Give me a sec.
You said something in Lebanon about working for "Nourredine", a PFLP delegate here.
I said I helped him out. That's all.
For the Palestinian cause.
Have you been in touch with him since?
You had documents for him.
I was questioned in Beirut.
People found out.
He's suspicious.
I'll never hear from him again.
For sure.
Is this Nourredine?
Don't say you don't know him.
It's not Nourredine.
Who is it?
A vague acquaintance.
A Peruvian playboy.
We go out drinking.
His name.
Carlos Martínez.
Where can we find this Carlos Martínez?
I just know his girlfriend.
A Venezuelan student.
Anselma Lopez.
Does he live with her?
I'm not sure.
Her address.
9 Rue Toullier.
Near Boulevard St. Michel.
We'll check it out now.
We need to ID someone.
Come with us.
Where are you going?
- To get my gun.
- It's pure routine.
Too late to come back.
We'll head home afterwards.
Bring the Lebanese along.
You see, Edgar is bourgeois.
He talks about revolution but all he cares about is studying international law.
He wants to be a corporate lawyer.
It makes me want to puke!
Why not leave him?
It's not easy. We're married.
Get divorced.
I can't.
I have no money. I'd need a lawyer, papers, and lots more.
Stay with him.
What is it?
Looks Like cops to me.
What do I do?
Go on, Leyma... Nice and easy.
Give me that.
Problem?
None. Is Anselma Lopez here?
She went to Venezuela 2 weeks ago.
Any more questions?
Can we come in?
Join us for a nightcap?
No, but I'll look at your passports.
Of course.
You're Carlos Martínez?
Peruvian?
That's right.
You know a Lebanese named Michel Moukharbal?
I don't know any Arabs.
He knows you.
He gave us this address.
Strange. I hate Arabs.
But you have a Lebanese visa.
Several trips to Beirut.
I can travel, can't I?
This doesn't look familiar?
Should it?
Who is he?
I don't know.
- Not you?
- Not me.
Looks Like you.
For you, all Latinos look alike.
Don't be a wise ass!
Don't speak to me Like that!
I'll call my embassy.
They know my father!
- So this isn't you?
- No, it's not!
What did he do?
We don't have to say.
Where is he?
In a car downstairs.
Go get him.
We'll see if he knows me.
Get him.
Are you sure you won't have a whisky?
Just a drop.
You don't hide your opinions.
We're internationalist militants.
Non-violent.
And you?
Your opinions?
No political opinions.
But you're a cop.
I protect honest citizens.
DST... DST...
Do you know him?
I've never seen him.
And you?
It's him.
The man in the picture.
I gave my attaché case to him.
Why?
Amparo!
Open up. It's me.
Ilich!
Get me a cigarette.
- What is it?
- Check tomorrow's papers.
I'll hide here till I leave France.
Where's the suitcase?
- Under the bed.
- Get it.
It's heavy.
Talk to me, please.
I need you to mail these first thing tomorrow.
- André was kllled.
- Who did it?
I did.
After his arrest, he led the cops to Rue Toullier.
I had to shoot my way out.
I said he was a fucking coward.
Carlos, leave Paris.
I have a place for tonight but the area's surrounded.
If they find me, they'll kill me like a dog.
How can I help?
Warn everyone.
Tell them to lie low till things die down.
And destroy any papers you have.
I can't talk.
I'll call once I've left France.
Do you speak English?
Aden, South Yemen
Two months later
PFLP
What is this?
What?
We'll spend 3 weeks in the camp.
Training every day.
No liquor.
No cigarettes.
We'll make a new man of you.
We need well-trained fighters.
We haven't much time.
Good thing we have our German comrades.
German Revolutionary Cells
German Revolutionary Cells
Frankfurt, WestGermany
- When did you get in?
- I landed 3 hours ago.
Know what's happening in Beirut?
I read the papers.
It's never been so bad for the Palestinian resistance.
In Beirut, it's the last stand.
The Jews and collaborators from moderate Arabs countries are set on destroying our comrades.
Oil-rich countries could help us.
But they're scared.
They won't commit.
We're planning a mission to bring them to our side.
What kind of mission?
Take OPEC ministers hostage during the Vienna conference.
That's sheer madness.
We'll be kllled before we reach the ministers!
No.
It's difficult, but realistic.
We have reliable contacts on the inside.
The PFLP knows their security system.
We'll disenable it... before they can react.
The countries will then negotiate.
Our allies will be in a position of power.
Why me?
Wadie Haddad chose Carlos to run the operation.
The Revolutionary Cells are supplying two men.
Carlos demanded you be one of them.
He trusts you.
Who's the other?
It will be a woman.
Nada.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Vienna Station
Arrival of the Iraqi delegation at the OPEC conference
Number 3: Youssef.
You'll take a Tokarev and melenite.
Once we're in the conference room, detonate it only if I give the order.
You'll have one machine gun and two hand grenades.
Carlos scares me.
Life means nothing to him.
He's a soldier. A leader.
You're under his command.
I'm a political militant.
I hate armies and soldiers.
I fight for a cause.
So does he.
I wish I were so sure.
For your birthday.
Drink it tonight and think of me.
It's time. They're here.
Oil Minister of Saudi Arabia
PART ONE
All events in this film, even the most extreme, truly occurred in Summer 1942.
6th JUNE, 1942
No Jews - By Order
Hi, Raymond.
Weismann.
What are you doing there?
Can I go to school with you?
The star, is that right?
What's the problem?
We're Jewish, aren't we?
And proud of it, too!
Come on.
How about that!
They seemed like such good kids.
At least now we won't get them mixed up.
Field Marshal, here we are!
Facing you, the savior of France
We swear, we're your men
We're here to serve and follow you
You could've waited for me.
Mum insisted on walking my brother and me to school.
You've given us new hope
The nation will be reborn
Field Marshal, here we are!
Right, the first one of you to mention that blasted star gets his arse kicked.
Clear?
Yes, sir!
File in, two by two.
In silence, please!
C'mon, lads.
When surgery can do nothing, as with the faces of these Great War vets, a facial prosthesis can be fitted.
This technique...
Stand up, ladies!
Please sit down.
Now then, ladies...
You may have been told that Jews have pointy ears, hooked noses and goodness knows what else...
Curtains, please.
As you can see, your fellow students look just like you.
That's why you will help Esther and Sarah to escape through the courtyard if the Germans arrive.
I'm relying on you.
Thank you, ladies.
100,000, Field Marshal.
Vichy, unoccupied France
How many did you say?
100,000 Jews.
Foreigners, most of them.
Even so, that's rather a lot.
How many Israelites do we have in our own camps?
10,000. The advantage is that they're foreign Jews.
If the Germans take back the scum that's fled here since '33,
I've no objection.
Neither do I, obviously.
But...
10,000 falls a long way short.
Offer them to the Germans, though.
I have.
Just in Paris, over half the Israelites are French nationals.
Not to mention their children, all born in France.
The Germans won't take the children.
Won't they?
Not for now.
What are we supposed to do with them?
- Hello, Violette.
- Hello, children.
- You coming, Simon?
- Yes.
- Hi, Tati!
- The terrible twosome's back!
Hands off my radio, you!
Don't worry.
Evening, Ida.
- Good evening, children.
- Evening, Captain.
Hi there.
How's my little tiger?
Hi, Mum.
You're all sweaty.
Look...
Top of the class again.
What have you forgotten, Simon?
Can I go with him, Mum?
Please, can I?
Don't be late.
School's not finished.
- Okay. Thanks.
- You have homework to do.
- Hi, Dad.
- Don't forget my tobacco!
Don't worry.
That was André Claveau and his Orchestra.
Now the racing results.
At Auteuil, the Princes' Handicap was won by Isaac.
The horse's name, not the jockey's, of course.
Now they wear yellow stars, it's a shock to see Paris crawling with Jews.
Hard-working Jews!
In Montmartre,
I counted 268 yellow stars.
A victim of its own generosity,
France has been swamped.
Sura!
Which means?
Explode with an onion up your arse!
That's the third time this week.
Put a sock in it!
We have a job for you.
What kind? Hope it's nothing like the last one...
When a viscount meets another viscount
What do they say?
"Viscount, how are you today?"
When a marquis meets another marquis
What do they say?
"Marquis, how are you today?"
Come on, Nono, let's go!
It's just some little Jewish scamps.
Wait for me, lads!
Don't be so mean!
- Tomorrow, we'll try a posh area.
- What's "posh"?
Rich, you mug.
The rich leave a long stub.
We'll visit the Eiffel Tower, at last.
What's that?
Remember that exhibition?
"The Jews in France"?
What a load of shit!
It's not even scientific.
- Looking at your profile...
- What about my profile?
It makes you wonder.
Very funny.
What was that stink at the bistro?
Their sauerkraut.
It's chock-full of pork.
Germans don't eat kosher?
It's dark in here!
We'll die of suffocation!
I'm late for my customers.
Who are they for?
The Traubes.
Some people have such lovely things.
Look at Renée's blouse!
Hands off, you!
Titanic's on at the Gaumont.
You know Hitler blames the Titanic sinking on us?
Really?
Iceberg.
Another damn Jew!
- How can you joke about it?
- Rachel, my girl...
Read me Gone With The Wind instead of grumbling.
Rachel!
You'll only cry again.
It's good to cry if it's not for real.
I've got a head this big and I hate Jews.
Jews won't be laughing for long.
With this prophecy,
I will have the last word.
They will disappear from the face of the earth, annihilated and obliterated!
We must hurry, Himmler.
Before the international community starts an outcry.
Have you read Sun Tzu?
The Art of War.
Remind me to give it to you.
Everything is taking place as I described in Mein Kampf.
Page 771, mein Führer.
They must learn to take me at my word.
Mr. Jacques first, by the church.
We've done him.
And those loaves...
Go on, scram!
This isn't a circus!
It's a respectable business!
Why doesn't the baker want Jews in her shop?
Because she only likes barb-aryans!
- What's going on?
- Get lost!
Thank you!
Pancakes, yummy!
Simon!
Hello, Father.
Hello, boys.
The Nazis and collaborators forget something.
Why did you call him "father", the man in black?
What's that?
Their Christ was a Jew!
- You're joking?
- He was some kind of rabbi.
And they don't know?
Why'd you call that man "father"?
If he came back today, their Christ, he'd be wearing a star.
Blow me down!
The man in black isn't your father.
And that's all!
31 Avenue Foch, Paris. Gestapo HQ
It's too premature.
You promised to hand over your Jews.
I promised nothing.
- I said...
- What's wrong, Bousquet?
- I said I'd talk to my superiors.
- That's a joke.
Don't let your resolve weaken so close to our goal.
Must we bring troops from the front to do the job ourselves?
You couldn't!
- You imagine refusing?
- I didn't say that.
- 100,000 Jews is too many.
- 20,000 isn't enough.
The Führer would not understand if you refused to cooperate.
He'd interpret it as provocation.
An insult.
Look, you empty it out like this.
Careful you don't make a mess.
Sura, did you see my rolling papers?
No, that's not the tobacco.
It's the solvents, the paint.
My papers, darling?
In the dresser.
In the drawer.
On the right.
The second one.
You don't even know who smoked them.
What if he had tuberculosis?
No danger of that.
I pinched them off some Germans.
- Great big fellas, they were.
- Bastards are fighting fit!
I hope they all rot from cholera.
Can I practice now?
Can I? My audition's on Monday.
Can I start?
I don't think Shabbat's ended.
One... two, three...
Three stars, Sura.
Shabbat's ended.
Don't you believe me?
No.
Jo...
Come over here.
It's true, Mum, honest.
Go on, put your ballet shoes on.
Five police training schools.
I know what's coming.
Our government must reassert itself.
We need new training schools.
No more paramilitary police.
- No more Police for Jewish Affairs.
- Darquier'll be pleased.
His militiamen are exemplary.
They're thugs.
- Rabble.
- Who do the dirty work.
They don't have the file of Jews.
We have it.
Can't you change the music?
I like Chopin.
He was Jewish, wasn't he?
Sura, not all geniuses are Jews.
I'll get you!
Stop that.
I have a suggestion.
We organize everything.
But you restore our police's authority.
If all goes to plan,
I promise the Führer will listen favorably.
Vanda Lesniak.
Sarah Landeau.
Annette Monod.
Lucienne Dufresnes.
Goodbye!
Have a good holiday!
Look, Mum, I won the prize!
That's wonderful, love.
What's wrong?
Come on, let's go home.
We'll pay for private lessons with Prof. Grunstein.
He's banned, too.
That way, you keep your teacher.
Dad, private lessons are expensive!
So? I'm not a cripple, am I?
Listen and remember this forever.
They can ban you, but they can't ban your talent.
The war will end one day.
All wars do.
- We must leave right now.
- And go where?
The Ritz?
They're dismissing Jews from universities, the civil service...
Everywhere, Dad.
The nursery school head... she's been fired.
Have you read the papers?
Have you seen what they call us?
"Undesirables". That's what.
What more do you need?
How can 5 of us get out?
How can we cross the border?
With what money?
Mr. Finkel and his wife tried to make it to Spain.
Now where are they?
At Drancy internment camp.
You want that?
Do you?
"9th decree of 8th July, 1942,
"concerning measures against the Jews.
"It is forbidden for Jews to frequent establishments open to the public. "
What does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means.
We're banned from cafés, restaurants, concerts, libraries, fairgrounds...
They should say where we can go.
It'd save ink.
What do you think?
I preferred things the way they were.
"Restrictions on entering shops and businesses... "
Honestly, Laval, you've read it too.
"France is not yet sufficiently anti-Semitic
"to accept the mass deportation of Jews. "
Who wrote this report?
- The secret services.
- I always said...
France isn't ready.
Police stations are swamped with denunciations. Overrun.
We can't deport French-born Jews.
The country won't accept it.
Let's turn it to our advantage.
We'll deport the stateless ones.
Personally, I'd feel no dishonor in deporting them to Germany's territories for Jews in the East.
In the East?
East of what?
Any mass deportation would cost me power.
I see.
I'll deliver your answer in person.
In the negative.
I knew we'd reach agreement.
Let's recapitulate.
You start by sending us 10,000 Jews from your camps in the southern zone.
In the occupied zone, your police do the job...
Under French command.
24000 Jews in the Paris region.
That's the quota.
Only stateless persons will be arrested. Austrians, Czechs,
Russians, Germans and Poles.
We'll leave you the children until...
Impossible!
Our social services couldn't cope.
Children should go with their parents.
We'll have to refer that to Berlin.
No Jews - By Order
Just watch what happens.
I knew it.
You should know the law.
You, too.
You have children here?
Of course.
Count yourselves lucky
I don't arrest you.
People end up in Drancy for less.
And don't forget, curfew for Israelites at 8 PM.
8PM's early in summer.
I don't make the law.
Boys!
Nono, we're going.
You're going already?
I'm going to have a baby.
Your Mummy is.
You'll have a brother or sister.
No, it'll be a baby.
The doctor said so!
Nowadays, you don't want to be having babies.
If these ladies are going, so are we. Lucien?
It's silly that you have to leave.
It's outrageous, how they treat you.
My husband made it to the free zone.
But I've had no news in 2 weeks.
I don't know how you do it, all alone with four children.
Are you the new tenants?
We just moved in next door.
We're from the Marne.
My husband works at Les Halles market.
Shall we go for coffee?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Afternoon, Mrs. Traube.
Good afternoon, Sura.
Ladies.
I have some laundry for you to come and pick up.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
You're not in school today?
Not any more, like all Jewish teachers.
I give German lessons to students now.
Enjoy your walk.
Thank you.
What?
What what?
What were you laughing at?
I wasn't laughing.
Hark at him.
In the end, it's proving easier with the French than the Duce or that blasted Franco.
Film the young people, not me.
You're much younger than them.
Spain fights for every one of its Jews.
Mediterraneans, so over-emotional!
Romantics.
That's why we dominate them.
Herr Hitler, can we go and see the deer?
Of course you can, sweetheart.
We'll give them some bread soaked in milk.
Fast and with utmost discretion.
Night and fog.
A total of 5000 men.
Including 4,500 gendarmes,
Mr. Secretary General, and 200 plain-clothes secret servicemen.
Not forgetting 1000 militiamen, all highly motivated.
If my calculations are correct, that's one armed man for every four or five Jews.
We should net 24-25000.
Of whom three-quarters are women, children and pensioners.
That shouldn't be any problem.
To reach the quota you set, we'll have to strip a few thousand of French citizenship.
Isn't that so, Leguay?
So it looks legal, we only arrest foreigners or stateless persons.
We're taking care of it.
Let's say the 14th of July.
Be serious. It's our national holiday, Bastille Day.
In that case, the 16th.
They've got out the file of the Jews.
Evening, Tati.
Evening, son.
Thousands of people listed.
It'll be any time now.
It's nice of you to warn us, Dédé.
Give my love to Momone!
I heard they'll take children this time.
You're mad, my girl!
Schmuel, tell your daughter she's mad.
Children?
Why'd they burden themselves with children?
Sergeant Desnoyers came specially to warn everybody.
You're talking nonsense, my girl.
Thousands of Jews took refuge here like us.
Know what they say in Poland?
France is the Jews' salvation.
- Dad, we mustn't stay here tonight!
- It'll be like last time.
When was that false alarm?
If it makes you feel better,
I'll sleep in the workshop.
We're in danger, too!
Stop it, Rachel!
You'll scare your brother.
They want men for their arms factories.
They won't touch us.
And your father's a war veteran.
I'll sleep downstairs, for Rachel's sake.
Have you seen my cigarettes?
You just want to smoke in bed.
What bed?
There's just a rotten couch.
Full of fleas!
- Why didn't we go to America?
- They turn back communists.
You can go later. I prefer Paris.
Every day, I go to the Sacré Coeur for my models, and every time,
I feel my heart skipping.
Compared to Lublin,
France is a dreamland.
You never saw what Poland was like.
We could tell you stories.
Pétain's no Cossack, whatever you say.
It could be a rumor, but you never know.
Here's what we'll do...
If I hear them,
I'll come calling my cat.
Tati, you don't have a cat.
What a sweetie!
He's a bright one, isn't he?
Why did she say she'd come calling her cat?
The cat's make-believe.
Try to delay them, so we can get out the back.
- Goodnight, Bella.
- Goodnight, Tati.
Mum?
Yes?
I have an idea.
What's your idea?
We should get married.
What do we do with Dad?
We'll invite him.
Goodnight, darling.
You can finish tomorrow.
You'll teach me to speak French good?
Right now?
No, I'm having lots of work to do.
I have.
I have lots of work to do.
Make fun of me.
Goodnight, darling.
What does that mean?
My little Yiddish noggin,
I think you'd say.
You're my little Yiddish noggin.
Goodnight, Mum.
To all Divisional Chiefs, you will arrive at the first address at 4 AM.
All listed Jews must leave their homes immediately.
You will proceed swiftly without needless chatter.

All the others to the Winter Velodrome.
Kitty! Kitty!
They're here! They're coming!
They're coming! Wake up!
I'll report you!
There are only poor folk here.
They haven't done anything!
Stay out of this! Back inside!
Go!
That's an order!
The children too?
- Mum!
- The children!
Stop! Don't hurt her!
They're taking the children too!
The children!
- Quiet!
- Run!
Stop!
They're taking the children!
Open up, now!
Run!
It's the Zyglers.
Don't hurt her!
Stop hurting her!
- Vladimir, please take the children.
- You too, Ida.
I can't leave my husband.
Children, don't make a noise.
I'll see you soon.
Where are you going?
Taking my brother to his nanny's.
- Name?
- Louise Timonier.
We just moved in.
What are you doing?
Let's go!
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep out.
They're Jews.
Mummy!
Thanks anyway.
Get the hell out!
I'm missing two from my list.
Louise and Léon.
Where are they, ma'am?
Do you honestly expect me to tell you?
I won't leave!
This is my home.
Your name!
He fought in the Great War!
His Jewish comrades died for France!
How dare you?
Those are my children!
Murderers!
Excellent.
Only four suicides so far, sir.
And almost no fighting.
Yes, but how many have we got?
What time is it?
7.30, sir.
- I said, how many?
We're below target. Look lively!
Ida...
Get your paws off me!
Idiot!
Open up. Police!
Open it or we'll blow the lock off.
What are you doing?
A madwoman jumped with her brat.
I don't want an epidemic.
My God!
Who was it?
We know everyone here.
Who cares, they're dead.
Right, how many Jews here?
We've got five.
Sura, Charlotte, Rachel,
Joseph and...
Stupid dago name.
Schmuel Weismann.
- He isn't here.
- Where is he?
Deceased.
It doesn't say so here, ma'am.
Last week.
Embolism.
Just to repeat myself, you're allowed
2 days' food, clothing...
Hurry up!
Girls, help me!
Take warm clothes, they'll come in handy.
Where are you taking us?
Chop chop!
Get some crockery.
Nothing breakable.
No need, you'll get them there.
Forget that, too.
You won't need it there.
Where's "there"?
Why won't you tell us?
I don't know and I don't give a damn!
Quick or I'll get the Gestapo.
You'll change your tune.
Don't try to escape, we have orders to shoot.
Move!
For Poor Relief.
Shouldn't we tell Dad?
That's an idea I like.
So, not a widow after all?
Hubby's embolism all cured?
Get the champagne!
What's embolism, Mum?
It's okay, Jo. You didn't know.
Gently, please!
She got out of hospital yesterday.
You think they'll hurt my teddy?
They can't. It's a toy.
I don't understand.
Are you okay, Mum?
- Are you sure?
- Not a word.
Otherwise, they won't let me come with you. Not a word.
- Your papers!
- Leave it, Momo, she's new.
Mona, make any cash last night?
Want a jar at René's?
Yeah, sure...
This strip of a girl? A prossie?
With a sprog and no tits?
As if you don't know how twisted you men are.
Come on, Mona, let's have a drink.
I know where we'll hide her.
You're the Zygler girl, aren't you?
We'll take her to Father Bernard.
And Professor Traube, where's he?
At Collège St. Vincent, with his students.
He's an early riser for a teacher!
Those kicked out of their schools have no choice.
Remind me to send a van to St. Vincent.
We have a Jew to pick up.
One Saul Traube.
You have ten minutes.
Food for two days, one small suitcase.
You understand French, don't you?
- I have my orders.
- Not orders to peep, though.
Run up to the attic and hide.
- What are you going to do?
- Warn Dad.
I've got to beat them there.
Take your coats.
They'll think you left.
I'll try to delay them.
Go on!
The little bitch!
Check upstairs.
Stop it!
Not so proud now, eh?
- Good riddance, I say.
- Shut up!
What'd these kids do to you?
Where are they taking them?
Jerusalem!
Death to Jewish vermin!
I'm not vermin!
Die!
Look, Mum, it's Jo!
Mum, grab him!
- We can keep him.
- I'm not allowed to.
Goodbye, HéIène.
- That's enough.
- Goodbye, Sura.
Goodbye, Jo.
If anyone escapes, hostages will be chosen at random and shot.
Is that clear?
I'm sorry, Dad.
Sorry for what, son?
Isn’t it better, the whole family together?
I'm a war veteran.
I want to know where we're going.
- Are we leaving France?
- On my word as an officer, no.
I believe you.
Let's face facts, we've failed.
With all due respect, sir,
13,000 people, you call that a failure?
A mere 10,000 Jews missing!
They had accomplices.
To arrest more Jews, we'll have to search Aryan homes.
From now on, you must never say your old name, nor your little brother's nor other family members' names.
You must forget your old address, your school, your classmates...
You must change your date of birth, your religion and everything else.
Do you see?
It's a question of life or death.
Thank you.
I know what you risk.
To fight Hitler is to fight the Antichrist.
Excuse me, the Winter Velodrome, please?
The senior doctor's expecting me.
I'm looking for the consultations room.
- Who are you?
- Annette Monod.
Let go of my wife!
Miss! Our son has a bad fever.
I won't be a moment.
Can you tell us our new address?
Our children might worry.
We've been without water for 2 days.
Please, do something.
I'll be right back.
Where are we going?
My daughter has measles.
I won't be a moment.
Are you alone?
I beg your pardon?
I asked for reinforcements.
I'm sorry.
What's your name?
I only have 6 nurses, including you, for 8000 people.
Ask Matthey Joanis at the nursery what you can do.
Do you know if doctors are coming?
No.
I have 60 volunteers ready, but they want no witnesses.
They dragged Jews from hospitals, old folks' homes, asylums even.
We have lunatics here.
Appendicitis cases who'd just been operated on.
And the usual children's diseases.
Measles, scarlet fever, chicken pox...
Typhoid even.
I never saw chaos like this.
And in the pharmacy?
Methylene blue.
And two stoves to sterilize syringes.
45 minutes to give an insulin jab.
On the front in '14, it was better.
- You were there?
- Ambulances at Verdun.
I lost my eye there.
But the other misses nothing.
Where do I begin?
We just received some milk.
Under-4s only.
There's not enough to go round.
I've been a good boy.
I'm sure you have.
My teacher said so.
I believe you.
Why can't I leave then, if I've been a good boy?
I've no idea, little man.
I don't know why you're here.
We need to tell Mummy we're waiting here for her, me and Simon.
We live at number 12.
Number 12, fine. I'll remember.
You have family here?
Yes, my brother's outside.
What's your name?
Noé Zygler, but you can call me Nono.
Okay.
That boy's mother died this morning.
A hemorrhage.
Poor woman died on the way to hospital.
The boys don't know.
Which is your brother?
I am.
- Is your father here?
- He's in the free zone.
At least, I think so.
My big sister and little brother got away.
You two are all alone here?
We're here. Their neighbors.
They're with us.
Look, Mummy gave it to me before she went to hospital.
There's her photo inside.
Your Mummy's very pretty.
When does it begin?
What, darling?
The show. The bicycle race.
We're the only show here, Nono.
- Where are you going?
- The Red Cross. Can you help?
- Depends.
- Leave me alone!
You're trying to get out?
Are you alone here? No family?
Nobody?
Go and see the chief plumber,
Roques.
He has blank permits, Ausweis.
He can help you.
Go on.
I didn't tell you.
He can help you, too.
Why don't you ask him?
Who'd look after them?
Come on in, madam.
A fine case of chicken pox.
I never saw so many Jews.
How can they hurt us?
There's too many of us.
It's too much work.
Why are we here then?
I know where we're going.
We're going to Pitchipoi!
Where's Pitchipoi?
Near Timbuktu.
Why's everything you all say so confusing?
I heard we're being sent to the arms factories in Poland.
There aren't any in Poland.
But there are salt mines.
I saw them when I was a kid.
You get on a little train and go underground.
And you know what the workers built in the salt? Do you?
Do you know?
What about you?
A cathedral. A real one.
In the salt.
With candelabra and pews.
We can build a synagogue then.
The doctor sent me.
You're the chief plumber?
Yeah.
I won't shake your hand.
30 blocked crappers.
- Who's it for?
- Me.
- It'll never work.
- Why not?
We got two Jews out today.
Two men, in our overalls.
With your figure...
They're not that stupid!
Give me the Ausweis anyway.
In my top pocket.
Take the pen out, too.
How do you spell your name?
Roques, with an S.
If anyone asks, say I'm your wife.
I can cope with that.
- Does that look okay?
- Let's hope so.
Now it's got my name on it.
Thanks.
And good luck.
Say it to them.
I brought my husband his lunch.
He's the chief plumber.
I'll go with you, just in case.
Hold on.
How do I look?
Full of nerve.
Let's go.
Not him!
- Who is he?
- He knows I'm Jewish.
Miss!
Well played.
Quick, before he changes his mind.
Little girl.
Thanks.
Here.
I told you.
Why'd no one listen to me?
Rachel, please, not in public.
You're always so trusting.
It's all your fault.
A father protects his family!
Rachel, be quiet.
Look around you.
I wasn't the only one.
We all trusted them.
Your father's right.
We all trusted them, all of us.
You're Protestant?
A pastor's daughter.
- Practicing?
- Yes.
I still believe.
I wanted to say...
I'd no idea what was going on here.
I never imagined this.
They gave you no special instructions before they sent you here?
Sure.
So, what were their recommendations?
To stay silent about what I saw here.
Not to mix with the detainees, to keep my distance.
One day, they'll be called to account.
Who?
The men who ordered this.
They'll have to pay.
You must stop your children from gathering by the rails.
Firemen!
Water!
Water!
What do we do, sir?
There'll be a riot.
I wouldn't blame them.
Roll out the hoses!
That's an order.
What the hell's going on?
Who gave these orders?
I did.
You're here to check the hoses, not use them!
I don't see a fire.
Roll them back up! Now!
I'm the ranking officer in this arena.
Step back, Lieutenant.
Attention!
In the absence of a superior,
I'm in command.
And so, I confirm my orders.
Roll them out!
Fall out.
What you're doing is a disgrace.
Hooray for the firemen!
Please!
Over here!
Thank you.
Don't push!
Please, over here!
Thank you.
God bless you.
So my uncle can bring us food.
I've no stamps, but I put 5 francs inside.
Please...
Hurry!
God bless you.
Thank you.
Gentlemen...
I noticed you taking messages from many detainees.
Tomorrow, don't report for duty.
You'll each receive a Metro ticket.
You'll go and post the messages.
As far away as possible, to avoid arousing suspicion.
If by chance you get caught, say you're acting alone, to protect your comrades.
Anyway, do your best.
I'm proud of you.
By the way, Cardinal Suhard...
You read his letter of protest?
"We can't hush the cries of our conscience...
"In the name of humanity and Christian principles... "
What do we do?
Nothing.
He didn't even make it public.
So it doesn't exist.
The Germans are here!
You bastards!
Scum!
Deaths every day, sanitation deteriorating...
I have 100 volunteer doctors waiting for a simple order.
Jews, I imagine.
All you have to do is allow them in.
There's no point.
They're leaving tomorrow.
All of them. Even you.
Murderers!
It can process 8000 units per day.
As long as we finish crematoria 2 and 3 by mid-August.
Ashes, Himmler.
We need ashes.
Ashes don't say how many of them there were.
They don't say if they were men, women or children.
Goodness, Wagner is so depressing!
Can't we change the music?
Who wants a cocktail?
Moi, moi, moi!
Eva, you know what I think of women drinking alcohol.
I don't drink, mein Führer.
I just think up cocktails and test them on Dr. Morell.
Come and try my latest creation.
For heavens' sake, don't get so close to the fire, or you'll explode like a Molotov cocktail.
Dinner's in 10 minutes.
It's Sauerbraten.
If you'd seen the slaughterhouses in the Ukraine, and the butchers wading through blood, you'd soon lose your appetite for Sauerbraten.
It's nothing, just a touch of heatstroke.
Give him plenty of fluids.
Are you okay?
Fetch her cape.
You're exhausted.
You need to rest.
Are you holding up?
Yes, for now.
You know your destination?
The Loiret region detention camps.
Beaune or Pithiviers.
I'd like...
I'd like to go with the children.
I'll support your request.
Thank you.
Get some fresh air, you're very pale.
Want a cigarette?
Thanks, I don't smoke.
I couldn't face that again.
Go ahead!
Resign!
Go on. Rebel!
Not one of you has.
Not a single one.
Is it normal, what's going on in there?
They had it coming to them perhaps?
It's easy for you to say.
I'm a soldier.
I could get shot.
- I have kids, you know.
- So do they!
They've got no supplies.
There's a grocery opposite.
Why not let them buy food?
I have orders.
Orders to starve children?
They're leaving already?
We're evacuating the whole stadium.
About time, too.
It's not even a real train.
Keep moving!
Keep moving!
That way!
People: 40
Horses: 8
See, Jo, we haven't left France and we're all together.
Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp,
100 km south of Paris
Look, Simon, a snail!
Come back here.
It's so hot!
And it stinks in here.
Probably, the people before us.
Where are they now then?
Stop it!
You can't get away from me, you grub.
Stop...
That tickles.
Mrs. Traube!
Where's Hannah?
And your husband?
I don't know where they are.
I saw your daughter.
- Where did you see her?
- At the stadium.
My God! In that case...
Where is she now?
There are other camps nearby.
You need to ask.
You'll find her.
I'm glad to see you again.
Same here.
He's the last one.
My feet are killing me.
All done!
I don't get it.
I heard they're going East.
With no warm clothes.
It's Autumn soon. They'll freeze.
What do you think?
I think the Germans are organized.
Too efficient sometimes.
Do you trust them?
Here...
Sulking?
You don't care about me anymore.
You know I'll never abandon you.
You're my little Nono.
When will Mummy come back?
She's tired from delivering your brother.
My brother?
What's his name?
He's called...
Julien.
Do you like that name?
And you? Do you like it?
Where've you been?
- Go and play. What's the game?
- The roundup.
I'm sick of always being the Jew.
- You can be the gendarme.
- Come on.
Soup!
The Loiret camps now house almost all the undesirables.
They're teeming with Jews, who infested France like parasites.
Turn that off.
It really gets me down.
There's nothing in the soup.
They won't last long on this.
Did you see the daily bread ration?
Go and tell the authorities.
I wrote to the Prefect.
I've gone on the same rations.
What? Don't go playing the martyr.
It's the only way to prove it's insufficient.
You think they don't know in the Prefect's office?
I'm not hungry.
Go on, take it.
You think we'll be grown-up one day?
I don't know.
They don't just want us dead, they want us to suffer first.
Don't do that. It's all there is.
It can't go on like this for centuries.
Proletarian revolution.
That's the answer.
Another bloodbath?
What the Jews need is a land.
A country we can call our own.
Zionist?
- Communist?
- Trotskyite. Him, not me.
My wife's religious.
I bet they put bromide in it.
What?
So you can't get it up.
What do they care if I get it up?
Young man!
To stop us reproducing.
Get up.
Get up, your brat!
I didn't do anything, sir.
You just spat.
Not at you. A weevil.
- He's telling the truth, sergeant.
- Keep out of this!
I didn't do anything, sir, honest.
Sergeant to you, you runt!
Don't! He's armed.
Think of your family.
He's on the next convoy in any case.
As for you, doc, stay in the infirmary or I'll relieve you of your duties.
Can't you sleep?
Perhaps your sister was right.
I should've protected you.
Don't say that, Dad.
Dear Sir,
I received no reply to my letter.
In it, I described the sanitary situation here.
The detainees live in conditions of malnutrition and neglect unworthy of our institutions.
I invite you to come and see for yourself.
After 3 weeks on the detainees' diet,
I've lost over 14 pounds.
Nearly all the children are ill.
Come to our aid.
These civilians are guilty of no crime.
Sorry if I'm interrupting.
No, come in.
You still hope to get a reply?
I'll go there if I have to.
You can't keep starving yourself.
We need you here.
It's the only way I've found.
If you're sick, who'll care for them?
And the next ones?
They won't stop now.
There'll be more roundups, more detainees.
I'm relying on you for when I'm gone.
Tell the Prefect Miss Monod's here.
He knows why.
I told you, it's impossible.
Sir!
I wrote and you never replied.
Do you believe me now?
Can you reach it?
Almost.
Got it.
How are my mother and Renée?
- Fine. You want me to fetch them?
- No, no time.
Tell them I'm in Limoges with Dad.
Louise and little Léon are in hiding, too. Don't worry.
Thanks.
Give my mother and Renée my love.
- Okay.
- See you.
How was she?
Fine. She was all pink and everything.
She sends her love.
Toffees from Brittany!
Do you want one?
No, thanks, we're fine.
Here...
You too.
Can I have another one?
Wonderful!
- Can we eat it?
- Of course!
Darling, do you want a bit of your godfather to eat?
At last, I can feast on mein Führer.
Who's coming for a swim?
I just spoke to Berlin.
The French want to deport the children with their parents.
Why's that a problem?
It's impossible.
We're behind schedule on crematoria 2 and 3.
We can't keep up.
Find an excuse for the French.
Tell them whatever you want.
There aren't sufficient trains.
The Germans can't deport the children before mid-August.
That's very regrettable.
How can we overcome this setback?
I say they're sponge cakes.
No, they're biscuits.
They're rich tea biscuits.
I heard there's a factory that way.
When I grow up,
I'll work in that factory.
Cut it out, lads, they're waffles.
Children! Come here!
We have sponge cakes!
Hurry!
Take it easy, eat them slowly.
Come on...
Everyone will get one.
Take it easy and enjoy them.
There's one each.
Imperceptibly
You took over my life
Imperceptibly
You won over my heart
First, you were like a friend
Then a sister
We made witty jokes
About happiness
What do we do, sir?
Switch off the radio?
No, leave it.
I like this song.
Everybody up! You're leaving!
Come on, wake up!
Everybody up!
Quickly!
Everybody up!
We're leaving?
The boy has to go with his mother.
That's an order.
Everybody in the yard in 15 minutes!
Is it true they take medallions in the search barracks?
Mine isn't even made of gold.
We'll have to tell them.
You'll tell them, won't you?
I'll tell them.
You're not coming with us?
Not just yet.
I have too many sick children here.
Afterwards, you'll come and live with us.
At Pitchipoi.
I heard that's where we're going.
Of course I'll come.
Just a second.
Well?
It's not appendicitis, it's a minor hernia.
He'll be fit to travel?
Yes.
Go and get ready.
David...
I've been thinking.
I could ask to be replaced...
I could go with the convoy.
Only Jews are sent East.
They'll never accept.
Listen.
You've come as far as you can.
It's time to say goodbye.
I should have helped you escape.
And let the children travel alone?
I'd never have agreed.
I'll send news when I can.
Not your wedding ring!
If they want it, they can come and get it here.
In the shit.
You think I'm stupid?
Thought you could trick me?
Bitch!
Is that what you thought?
You dirty Yid!
Get rid of it.
Next!
Right, state your full name.
Put all you have on the table.
Jewels, cash, deeds...
And no cheating.
You saw what happens to cheats.
Come on!
- We haven't got all day!
- What are you doing?
You're mad!
- Lie on the table.
- Your head at this end.
Is that everything?
Go on.
Next!
I don't understand.
Why are the men over there?
I don't know either.
We're ready.
Due to a lack of rolling stock, your younger children won't be leaving today.
- You can't separate them.
- You have no right!
Keep them in check.
Stand back!
Back to the barracks!
Don't shoot!
Go back to the barracks.
I wanted to catch the train!
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.
The lunatics'll see their kids soon.
You're the lunatics! You can't leave children without their mothers.
Shut up!
Sergeant!
Let me do my job.
That is your job!
Escort Miss Monod back.
Don't separate them!
Let me go!
Take your belongings and leave quietly.
You will never succeed.
You'll never destroy us.
Back in line!
Out of the way! Move!
Attention!
One step back!
About turn!
Quick march!
Pick up your stuff!
Forward march!
You have to live, Jo.
Don't stay here. Find a way out.
Promise me!
I'm getting out.
- Come with me.
- What about your parents?
I've given up hope.
I can't leave without him.
We'll take turns to carry him.
I can't, I have a hernia.
That's okay. Bring it with you.
Stop, it hurts when I laugh.
A hernia's a kind of tear in your stomach muscles.
I couldn't even lift him.
You go ahead.
I'll see you after the war.
No way.
I won't leave you and Nono here.
- We'll wait till you're cured.
- Don't be stupid.
They said we leave in 10 days.
I'll never be better in time.
It's your only chance. Take it.
- Go and hide it.
- Where?
In one of your shoes.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
You have a raging fever.
You should go and see someone.
Who? The doctor?
The one in Beaune.
We don't want you catching typhoid.
Okay?
Do you know the bath song?
The bath song?
No, I don't. How does it go?
By the clear fountain
As I was walking by
The water looked so lovely
That I stopped to dive in
I've loved you so long
I'll never forget you
Bath's over.
Go and get dressed.
Go ahead, children.
Most of them have forgotten their surnames.
How will they ever find their parents?
- You've no idea where they are.
- Poland.
Don't worry.
Why haven't we heard from them?
It's been 5 days now.
The journey takes 3 days.
I doubt they have telephones there.
No news for their children here.
Doesn't that seem strange?
Come on.
Time for your bath.
When you were asked to take in Jews, you did, but in a trickle.
A thousand here, a thousand there.
Always the same with the Americans.
Arbiters of the free world!
What's so strange about the Germans taking Israelite manpower?
Especially with the Russian front.
But morally...
It's disease prevention, not morals.
We put an end to damaging
Gaullist and communist propaganda.
What damage can some women, old folks and children cause?
And the invalids? The disabled?
Why this sudden urge to take on more mouths to feed?
It's absurd. Unless...
- Unless what?
- It's racial purification.
And France is an accomplice to the crime.
Joseph Kogan?
Weismann?
Watch out!
All clear.
What did I tell you?
Come on!
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry.
- Stop it!
- It's not an excuse!
Tastes like shit, this soup!
Corporal! Quickly!
What's going on?
Come back here!
I'll go first.
You okay?
The problem of the Israelite children is settled.
For humanitarian reasons,
I asked for families to be reunited within two weeks.
- Are you cold?
- No.
Are you scared then?
Yeah, I am.
It's not the dead you need to watch out for.
It's the living.
Goodnight.
Miss!
Get up!
Get the children ready, they're leaving.
What?
We're going to see Mummy!
Get dressed!
Don't forget them!
Get up, kids!
We're going to see Mummy!
Hold on, Nono, let's get our stuff.
Not him, he's very ill.
Put him down immediately.
- Put him back in his bed!
- They all have to go.
They have fever.
All the children must leave.
I have my orders.
Help me.
You can't even stand up.
Flowers for your Mummy?
They'll wilt in the train.
Pick others when you arrive.
- Who are you?
- The doctor from Beaune.
- I have to go.
- No, wait!
You're running a raging fever.
Where's Annette gone?
I don't know.
But at least we're together.
The children!
They can't travel alone!
You clearly don't understand.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand. Let go!
Please, don't scream.
I must tell you something.
Let me go.
There's nothing you can do for them.
It's too late.
What?
- They're going to die.
- What are you saying?
They'll be murdered.
On arrival, probably.
Gassed. All of them.
You're mad.
Listen!
I'm with De Gaulle.
There's no Jewish territory out East.
There are camps.
Extermination camps. You see?
Gas chambers.
Some Polish partisans escaped.
That's how we found out.
Most of the parents are already dead.
They don't keep children alive.
It can't be true.
The BBC announced it a few days ago.
The Allies wouldn't allow it.
The camps aren't a "priority".
First, they want to stop the war.
Maybe later, when we're organized, we can sabotage the convoys.
I don't believe it.

Full name?

Gilberte what?
What's your Daddy called?
Daddy.
Label!
Let me out!
Stop, Nono!
I want Annette!
- Let me out!
- Stop it! Let go!
- I want to get out!
- Calm down now!
What are you doing?
Someone'll see you!
PARIS, JUNE 1945
Go inside and get some rest.
She's my wife!
Someone to see you.
Have you found your parents?
No. Nor my sisters.
I have a hundred kids upstairs, but you know... no child from the Velodrome who took that train ever came back.
Have you found anyone?
No.
Yes, I have.
You!
I met some good people.
From the North.
They want to adopt me.
That's good.
I'll be going.
I left my name at the desk.
Will you write to me?
Write to me here.
I'll be here a while.
Go on...
Gisèle!
You're alive!
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
You know him?
We found him near our local station.
He must have been pushed onto the tracks. That's all we know.
He's not very talkative.
So you know his name?
Yes, I know him.
Out of 13,000 deportees, only 25 survived.
None of the 4051 children put on the train ever came back.
Vichy and the Germans aimed to round up 24000 people.
But on the morning of the round-up, brave Parisians helped hide 10,000
Jewish men, women and children.
Dad... Dad!
Lieutenant Woodward.
I'm your new commanding officer.
I'm looking for Sergeant Simpson.
You'll need to talk to Corporal
Fraser. He's up top.
I can't seem to find my way out.
Follow the lateral. 30 yards on, it forks. Take the right.
It's pretty narrow but you'll make it.
You'll find a shaft. Left at the top.
25 yards, there's another shaft that'll take you up to daylight.
Thank you.
Psst.
What's your name, sapper?
Tiffin, sir.
I heard something - just through there.
Hear that?
Listen.
You can hear 'em digging, sir.
There. Fritz.
They're gonna break through.
I swear to God, they're bloody breaking through.
Shh, shh!
That sound that you heard, was it like this?
That's it.
That's your heart.
What?
Feel it.
You're hearing your own heartbeat.
Make sure you clip that little fella's claws.
Otherwise the bugger can be dead and still sitting on its perch.
When does your shift end?
Don't make me stay.
Please.
We'll put the billiard room through there, eh?
You ever play billiards, Tom?
Best bloody billiard players in the world, Australians.
- Says who?
- Well, ask anyone.
Best billiard players, best horsemen, miners...
Bullshitters?
Keep a lid on it, you blokes.
Percy, Ginger, go down and relieve the Sneddons.
Righto.
Dug through to China by now.
Well, I'll bring you back some chopsticks, then, eh?
Who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Woodward.
I'm your new C.O.
Are you Fraser?
I'm looking for Sergeant Simpson.
He's dead.
Sapper?
Norm Morris, sir.
Except we call him 'Pull Through' or sometimes 'His Lankiness'.
- Tom Dwyer, sir.
- Billy Bacon, sir.
Answers to 'Streaky'.
Morris, I want you to take over the listening post at...
Where were we?
102 drive left.
102 drive left.
Sir.
Better go with him,
Dwyer.
Sir.
Show me to the officers' dugout.
Sir. Sir! It's this way.
10 more gone.
Three, two...
- Make way! Make way.
- Keep your head down.
Walking wounded and blind.
Make way.
Come on, move! Move!
Walking wounded and blind.
- Here you go.
- Make way.
Come on, sir.
Stretcher bearer!
Forward!
Oh! Oh!
Tiffin! Hey, get up!
Get up.
Come on, son.
For God's sake, Australia.
This is an officer's dugout.
Woodward?
Bill McBride. I was wondering when I'd see you here.
Went to mining school together.
Charters Towers boys.
Bob Clayton, Northumberland
Fusiliers.
Oliver Woodward,
1st Australian Tunnellers.
An explosive man, right, Woody?
Could blow up at any time.
How long you been here?
Two days. It feels like a year.
And if you survive a year, it will feel like a bloody lifetime.
We nearly came a-gutser.
A Fritz machine gunner got a bead on us.
Yeah, it's Boris. It's a farm building.
They call it the Red House.
Solid as bloody Gibraltar.
Our artillery's been blasting away at it for a week.
Well, a direct hit'd make a bloody difference.
Arggh!
They have their own dugouts, you know.
A bit of air will see him right.
You got a home, son?
Wollongong, sir.
Coal miner?
- Gold, right?
- Silver, lead. Broken Hill.
Sweetheart?
Wife.
Wife?
Sweetheart.
You got a photograph, Tiffin?
She's, um...
My mum, sir.
You're not even real soldiers, are you?
I mean, what in God's name are you doing here?
Tunnelling under German lines.
Protecting your trenches.
- From?
- German tunnellers.
Who didn't show up until you arrived and who are now attempting to do the exact same bloody thing.
Your point being?
That it was bad enough my men being shelled from above and shot at from in front.
Now they're being mined from underneath.
If the man is wounded, Woodward, then for Christ's sake send him to the dressing station.
If he's not, then he should be back on duty.
Either way, he shouldn't be here.
If you want my opinion, neither should you.
Good to feel wanted, eh, Tiffin?
Wouldn't like to think we were over here putting our arses on the line for nothing.
Clayton's alright. He's just got the wind up him, that's all.
Hides it well.
People do.
Seems a shame to waste this.
Spot of tea, old man?
Oh, rather!
Mama!
It's alright, Tiffin. It's alright, son.
Hello? Is anybody home?
I found these two little rascals down by the creek.
They don't belong to you, do they?
Oliver, is that you?
Mrs Waddell.
Colin, Gordon, round the back.
Clean yourselves up before your father gets home. Now, please.
Hey, hey, wait.
That's not fair!
I was hoping I might catch Moffat.
Ah. Well, you're too late,
I'm afraid. He's joined up.
Light Horse?
Of course.
How was Papua? You know, we thought the headhunters might have got you.
They took one look at my head and ran away.
Tell you something, though, Mrs
Waddell,
I could have stayed there forever.
Just... why don't you put the nag in the stable and come inside?
We want to hear all your stories.
Come on, mate.
Is that you, Isabel?
- He's a major now.
- Not surprised.
At school, we called him 'Captain'.
He was captain of everything.
And were there complaints?
- No, sir.
- No.
- We wouldn't dare.
- Well, that's our Moffat.
- Woody, Woody, Woody!
- Yes?
Gordon reckons he can hold his breath for one minute and thirteen seconds.
- Can he really?
- Watch.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
Where's he posted now?
Well, we don't know. Egypt, we think.
...sixteen, seventeen...
It'll be the engineers for you, now, I'd imagine.
I'd hate to think I wasted my time training you up.
They've asked me not to join up, sir.
They need to keep the mine running.
Well, it's copper for the war effort.
We can't get it out of the ground fast enough.
God knows how many shells they think they'll need.
- Well, an army needs munitions.
No, an army needs good men, first and foremost.
- Woody!
When did you get back?
How was Papua?
What are you doing now?
Are you going to stay with us again?
- Are you? Oh, can he, Mama?
- Just slow down a minute, Marjorie.
And it's Mr Woodward.
Go and play with Gordon, little man.
- Come on, let's have a battle.
- Alright.
- Marjorie.
- Mr Woodward.
The answers to your questions are - two days ago, hot,
I'll be working at Mt Morgan mine and, thank you, but I have my own accommodation in town.
- Is this for me?
- Oh, yes, but it's very silly.
- They make them for kids.
- No, it's beautiful.
I love it. Thank you.
Doesn't he look wonderful?
Some men are just born to be in uniform, don't you think, Woody?
- It's Mr...
- Mr Woodward.
Yes.
May I have some tea, please, Mama?
Yes, if you refill the milk jug first.
And you can re-tie that ribbon, young lady.
Yes, Mama.
She's so grown-up.
Well, she thinks so but, between you and me,
I think she still has a long way to go.
It's alright.
What now?
- Hey, I outflanked him.
- No, you didn't.
Actually, I believe that Colin has outflanked yours, see?
And my left flank moves forward...
- Mr Woodward?
- Yes?
- Do women ever go down mines?
- I don't think so.
Bad luck, they reckon.
Well, that's good because I don't know that I'd like to be so deep underground.
It must feel awfully claustrophobic.
It's funny. I quite like it down there.
Really? Why?
Snug.
Hmm. Snug.
Marjorie!
- Sorry, I...
- Are you OK?
Yes, I just...
Just go and clean yourself up immediately.
I'm so sorry.
One moment she's an adult, the next minute she's a child.
16 is a very difficult age.
Now, while Moffat's away,
I want you to visit whenever you can.
- You promise me?
- I promise.
Right.
Mr Woodward, I hope you'll forgive my silly indiscretion at the table.
Of course. Think nothing of it.
Well, goodbye, all.
Oh!
Marjorie Waddell, did you have something to do with this?
No, no.
It's my own stupid fault, I'm afraid.
He got into the lucerne this morning and suffered terrible flatulence on the ride over.
I think that's perhaps how we got here so quickly.
So, when I arrived I loosened the girth.
Must've forgotten to cinch it up.
Stupid of me.
Are you sure you're not injured?
No, I'm fine, honestly.
Thank you for the tea, Mrs Waddell.
Mr Waddell.
Oliver.
Isabel.
Anything?
There's something wrong with this bloody candle.
It's just making it darker.
It's not the candle, Pull Through.
It's the air.
Not enough oxygen for it to burn.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Could be worse.
Oh, Tommo, how could it possibly be worse?
Well, they could send us to Hill 60.
What's Hill 60?
Messines Ridge, just across the border, near 'Wipers'.
Blokes from the 40th were sent off yesterday.
Fritz has got the high ground.
Our blokes are trying to fight in bogs - bloody marshland.
Trenches running like rivers of blood, they say.
That's just talk, probably.
Shush, you little bugger.
You'll get us all killed.
Norm...
Aarggh!
Aarggh!
Aaaarggh!
Oh, my God.
How'd you know it wasn't me?
Lucky guess.
Jesus Christ.
Is he dead?
Call it even, eh, Tommo?
Shit!
McBride.
Location?
Say again.
How many?
Right.
102 drive has been crumped.
Casualties?
Two missing - um, Morris and Dwyer.
How's the air?
If they were near the face...
Not a chance. Not a fucking chance in the world.
...they may have found an air pocket.
This strata holds up sometimes.
We struck some in Papua.
It's kind of... dense...
It's pointless - the whole miserable stunt.
Lively, boys.
Steel soles.
German.
Stupid pricks.
Hear 'em coming a mile off.
- Mate?
- I need you to move back.
Mate, are you alright?
Help me here.
Aarggh!
It's Tommo.
Shh!
- Boys, it's Pull Through.
- Boys? Is that you, boys?
Hang on, Pull Through. We'll just...
Easy.
Can you get me out?
I thought I was a goner.
Watch out for your specs.
Easy. Easy.
Didn't think you'd get out of the bloody war that easy, did you, old son?
Morris, can you hear me?
Tommo?
- Tommo!
- Morris, can you hear me?
Tommo! Tommo's in there.
There's a man buried.
Tommo! Tommo! No!
Take Morris up to the dressing station, Fraser.
Come on, Pull Through.
One arrives nearly every day - no stamp, no return address, of course.
But what do they mean?
That I'm a coward.
But you're not. You're staying here and doing your duty.
Shush now, Marjorie.
Mr Woodward knows how to stop the feathers.
So, you agree with them?
Well, let's just hope that there won't be any more.
On the contrary, just a few more feathers and I'll have a whole chicken.
Isabel!
Are you missing Papua?
I worry about the local workers.
Bougainville is just up the coast.
It's a German colony.
If they send the German fleet down...
Good Lord, man! What would the Germans want with Papua?
They've bitten off more than they can chew in Europe.
Anyway, the word is the whole thing will be over by Christmas.
Marjorie, clear away the plates now.
Yes, Mama.
Best put those back, Woody.
William...
It's Moffat.
Mama?
Take the children to their rooms, please, Marjorie.
Isabel, boys, come on. Now, please.
William, tell me.
It's not good news, I'm afraid.
Why would they send the Light Horse to Gallipoli, Oliver?
It's just cliffs, isn't it?
Is it not all just cliffs?
I don't know, sir.
I don't know.
Marjorie.
You don't have to go.
Just because Moffat, you know...
You don't have to go to the war.
I just couldn't bear it.
The point is...
The point is I was kaput, finished, and he got me out.
The point, Pull Through, is you shouldn't have been there in the bloody first place.
Still don't know what I heard, but.
Maybe it really was me heart.
Maybe I never heard no Germans.
Of course you heard 'em.
Don't make no difference.
Oh, fuck, man.
Good on you, Streaky.
Courtesy of the Northumberland Fusiliers.
- Oh, bloody generous of 'em.
- Send 'em our regards.
Probably not a good idea, Corp.
Mmm.
Tiffin?
We was ready to give up on you, Pull Through.
- We wasn't.
- Well, we was.
Well, you was. You said.
Finish your letter, Walt, or get some more shut-eye.
But the Lieutenant knew about the strata, Dad. How it holds up, like.
And that's why we kept digging.
The fact is Tom Dwyer's dead because
Woodward made a blue - a bad one.
Won't be the last either.
- He's alright, he is.
- Yeah?
Then why'd he join late?
Does anyone want the last of the axle grease?
I was over here, killing Germans, months before his fuckin' number was dry.
Evening.
Stay there.
Surprised to see you here.
Me hearing came back.
Tommy doctor checked me out, couldn't find a bloody thing wrong with me.
Too bad.
- Smoke?
- Yeah, thanks.
It's bad luck.
Bad luck lighting three smokes with one match.
First one, Fritz sniper sees you.
Second one, he gets an aim.
Third one, he blows your fuckin' head off.
Well, he'd be a crack shot if he could get me down here.
Well, you never know who's watchin', do you, sir?
I'll be writing to Tom Dwyer's family.
If he had any possessions to send back, bring them to my dugout.
Officer approaching! Attention!
- Woodward?
- Yes, sir?
I understand you're a demolition man.
I'm trained in mining explosives, sir, not...
You're aware that the Germans have placed a machine gun in the Red House, such that they can enfilade our trench?
En... enfilade?
Fire down it lengthwise.
Oh, yes, sir.
And how much explosive charge would you need to demolish that building?
Depends where you placed it, sir.
How much would you need to do the job properly?
50 pounds.
Do we have that in the stores or do we have to requisition it?
- We have it on hand, sir.
- There's a listening post at 105 Drive.
That'd put you about 70 foot from
Boris.
If we drove north from there, we could be under it in, what?
Oh, three shifts, 30 foot a day - we could do it in two or three days.
Let's have it done before sun-up,
Clayton, you'll have to cut a gap in the wire.
I'll have the artillery give you one hour.
- Sir.
- Sir!
He couldn't get out of here fast enough.
Word is that bastard won't catch a train in case it's going down a tunnel.
It'll mean going over the bags...
...crossing no-man's-land, setting a charge.
I'll need two men.
I'll go, sir.
- You don't have to, Morris.
- Want to, sir.
Sit down, Tiffin.
I'll go.
Here.
A bit out of your element, aren't you, Australia?
I heard you tunnelling chaps were wombats.
Come up for some air, have you?
Actually, we've been invited to blow up the Red House.
Apparently you blokes keep missing.
Set the exploder up over there.
Right. That's us.
They'll start up again at dawn.
You've never been over the bags before, have you?
Christ.
When you get over the top, stay low, don't bunch up.
If a flare goes up, freeze.
Don't bloody go to ground. Fritz machine-gunners look for movement.
Keep one eye closed until the flare drops - then you'll see better when it's dark again.
Thank you.
- Did your boys cut the wire?
- Yeah.
Lieutenant Clayton took a couple of lads out earlier.
He ain't back yet. I'll cover you.
Let's go.
Fuck!
It's Boris, alright.
He hasn't spotted us, but.
The bastard's just trying his luck.
Right. Let's go.
Ready?
We'll have to go under.
There must be a cellar.
Corp!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- What?
- We're short.
Do you think you can get the exploder?
Sir, we could try again tonight.
They'll have found the charge by then. Can you get it?
I think so.
Stay on your bloody stomach and when you get close, give a low whistle to identify yourself.
The Tommies see any movement.
Oh!
Who's the fastest man in our company?
You need a runner?
Yes.
Yeah, Streaky's bloody quick.
Christ.
Is it one of our boys?
There's no way of knowing.
Poor bastard.
Stay here.
Morris will be back any minute now.
Wait.
Wait, sir!
Who are you?
Clayton?
Where did they get you?
Mary, Mary.
You're set now, mate. We're gonna get you home to your Mary.
OK? Everything's OK.
Come on. Come on, Captain.
Come on.
Help.
Field dressing.
- Where is he injured?
- Left leg, above the knee.
Christ.
No! Wait.
- Bastard's got a pattern.
- Thanks, mate.
Captain.
Just pray they haven't broken.
Thank you.
Sir, are you wounded?
I don't think so.
- Hello, Mr Woodward.
- Marjorie.
How is everything at home?
We're coping.
They've formed a mining battalion.
It's a secret, I think.
They're looking for miners and engineers.
I've joined up.
In a few weeks,
I'll be leaving for training, and after that, I expect
I'll be sent off to the war.
I see.
Marjorie, I'm nearly 10 years your senior.
You're only 16.
I'll be 17 in a month.
I signed the papers this morning.
I would like to ask you if I could write to you while I was away.
I would be happy if you wrote to me...
...but if you're asking me to wait for your return, then you must first ask my father.
Thank you for taking the trouble to see me.
Come in close.
If they're going to put on a big push, it'll happen right now.
They're gonna hit us where we're most vulnerable.
Our left flank.
Whatever happens, we need to hold our line, understand?
You convicts gonna play or what?
OK, lads. Kick it off.
Three points all. Next to score wins.
Come on, Australia.
Let's go!
Get right, boys. Go right.
Tiffin, get in there!
Boom, boom, out right!
Go, go, go, go!
- One man down.
- Get up.
OK, mark.
Come on. Turn it up. Get back.
Come on, boys.
Pass it! Pass it! Get out of here!
- Get onside!
- Get in there! Come on! Tackle!
Scrum.
Come here, boys. Come on.
Scrum down. Tiffin in the middle here.
Pack it in, boys. Come in hard.
It's out! It's out!
- Push! Push out!
- Run!
- Where's my runner?
- Get him, boys!
- Come on, Billy!
- Go, Billy!
I'm with you, Billy.
- Billy, go!
- Go, Streaky!
Victory to the 1st Australian Tunnellers, six points to three.
Parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
They'll do it for wine, they'll do it for rum
They'll stick your finger up your bum...
Hinky-dinky, parlez-vous?
Oh, Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
We're the boys from Townsville and Dandenong
We're coming for you with our donkey dongs
Hinky-dinky, parlez-vous?
Oh, Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
She's really fat and she's got big ears...
- What's up, Lieutenant?
- It's Captain, actually.
Well done, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Fraser.
Hey, Sarge!
As you were!
We're moving up the line.
We load up at midnight.
How come you bastards get to leave this shithole before us?
Because only real soldiers get to move up the line.
Where we heading, sir?
Belgium.
Hill 60.
Better get your gear.
Righto, you blokes. Let's go.
Keep your heads down, lads.
I nearly forgot - a present from
Fritz.
He said to say,
"Thanks for all your help".
Cheers, mate.
You'll be right, lads.
Thanks, mate.
Too early for the grey hen, sir?
Never too early.
- I'm right.
- Take 'em.
You're just skin and bones.
Come on, son.
She'll send me another parcel tomorrow, more than likely.
Decent fit.
My Elsa's a first-rate knitter.
When we get back, she'll have probably knitted herself a new husband.
Want to be a bit better-looking than the old one.
Your boy's gonna make a great prop forward.
Don't I know it? And he's still growing.
You join up together?
One of them recruiting blokes came through town.
Gets the young fella all excited with his stories of adventure and seeing the Pyramids and what have you.
Never spent one bloody night away from home and he's quit the pits and joined up.
Elsa's nearly had bloody kittens, hasn't she, Walt?
Yep.
Well, you can't unjoin.
So, after Walt went to bed,
I said to Elsa,
"I've looked after him all his life.
I'm not gonna stop now".
I told her if I joined up,
I could bring him back safe.
Elsa didn't know what was worse - her boy going off to the war by himself, or both of us going.
And she's been knitting like buggery ever since.
Douse them flaming lights!
Stay low! Stay low!
Stay here!
- Where's Fosse Way?
- It's north, that way!
He said that way!
Or south to Hill 60?
Fraser! This way!
Let's go!
Keep down!
Come on, boys!
You alright, Walt?
Come on, come on, get up!
Get up! Go!
Where are the others?
Sir!
We left the bloody kids behind.
Who's missing?
Young Sneddon, Tiffin and Bacon.
Walter!
Walt!
Arggh!
How can Fritz get to us?
We're behind the line, ain't we?
He's got the high ground.
Walter!
Over here!
Oh, fuck!
We've missed it.
Sap's over to the right. About 25 yards.
You ready?
Walt, we can't stay here, mate.
Tell you what,
I'll go to the left and draw crabs.
Soon as you hear that MG open up, you run like buggery.
Don't bloody stop until you get to the sap!
No.
I'm twice as fast as you blokes.
Probably make it before youse do.
Come on, Walt!
- Stay low!
- Tiffin!
Walt!
Over here, mate!
Come on.
Streaky's still out there!
Billy!
Billy Bacon!
Streaky!
Did they get home?!
They're home!
- Streaky!
- Streaky!
Run!
- Billy!
- Go on, Billy!
- Billy!
- Come on, Billy!
Come on, Streaky!
- Run, Billy!
- Come on!
Arggh!
Stretcher!
Stretcher bearers!
Streaky?
Oh, this is God's flamin' handiwork, is it?
Grab his disc and pay book.
We'll bury him in the morning.
Come on, Frank.
Gas masks on now!
Captain Woodward.
1st Australian Tunnellers.
- McBride!
- Captain McBride, actually.
Where you been?
Been waiting for hours.
Hell of a place, eh?
Your men can bunk down in there.
Stow your kits.
Get a couple of hours' sleep.
Couple of hours?
Gee, sir. They'll turn soft on you.
Come on!
Have you seen the tunnels?
You've got a big surprise in store for you.
Come on.
Officers' dugout's down this way.
I might just bunk down here for the time being.
Wetter in here than it is out there.
More rats than in frickin'
France.
At least they're Belgian rats.
Change is as good as a holiday.
Keep your gas bags within reach.
At least we're back underground.
And we'll be staying underground.
One way or another.
What's that supposed to mean?
This is how it goes from now on.
We'll be dodging shells and shrapnel and out of the blue, you cop a bullet in the guts like poor old Streaky.
And it's no game of skill down here, neither.
Get eaten by rats, get murdered by Fritz in the dark, or buried alive for our fucking troubles.
Well, that cheered us all up.
Mr Waddell.
Oliver.
When do you set off?
About three weeks.
Right, well... you'd better come in, then.
Actually...
...I'd like to ask you something.
I would like your permission to write to Marjorie while I'm overseas.
And...
...I'd like to spend some time with her before I leave.
- I know.
- Damn it.
Oh.
- Emma.
- What?
I'm gonna take my walk now, if you'd care to come.
Your walk?
Aye.
If you'd care to come?
Oh... of course.
They've never taken a walk together in their lives.
When I get back...
...I'll take you walking every day.
Ja.
Can't see it.
Keep going.
Mate, can I have a bo-peep?
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thanks.
Hey, Pull Through.
Hill 60- take a look.
Is that it?
What were you expecting, Morris?
The fuckin' Matterhorn?
I was expecting something bigger than a railway cuttin'.
So, why 'Berlin Sap'?
It goes so deep under German lines, they reckon it almost reaches Berlin.
It's just mud and slurry.
Like sinking a mine in a bog.
Yeah, the blue clay's further down.
This whole area is below sea level.
Keeping the water out was their main problem.
Was?
Now it's ours.
We're 90 feet down now.
Right below German lines.
Hill 60 is directly above us.
Eh, eh, eh? Shh-shh. Shh.
The blue clay of Flanders.
Beautiful.
Major North, 3rd Canadian Tunnellers.
Fritz has set up in the swim sand.
He can't get at us. Oh, no, no, no.
If you will.
53,000 pounds of ammonal high explosive.
8,000 pounds of guncotton.
I've never seen anything like this before.
No, nobody has. Nobody.
500 feet down there is a caterpillar mine.
That one's 70,000 pounds.
There's 21 of them.
We've undermined the whole of the Messines Ridge, nearly a million pounds of ammonal.
Mm-hm?
You know, when this thing blows, it'll be the biggest explosion the world's ever seen.
Each mine has detonators and leads running to the surface.
Mm-hm.
All we have to do is keep the bloody thing dry and keep it secret from Fritz.
No, no, no. No. Fritz has got no idea.
He thinks we're digging wells.
Well, this'll finish the war.
End it altogether.
Think of that, huh?
When do they plan to detonate?
They're pulling me out.
It's up to you now.
It's all up to you.
Poor bugger.
Yeah, he sleeps down here.
He hasn't been to the surface in three months.
So, when are they gonna blow them?
No-one knows.
- Could be months away.
- What are they waiting for?
Well, I'm a miner not a general...
...but I reckon it's simple arithmetic.
If we blow the mines now, we'll kill a few hundred Fritz at best.
But if they think there's an attack coming, they will stack those trenches above us like bloody sardines.
And kill thousands.
Time it right, tens of thousands.
Nein.
Ja.
Jim, check every prop and every stay, starting here, all the way to the bottom of the Berlin Sap.
- Take Walter and Ginger.
- Sir.
- I'll do the same for Caterpillar.
- Righto.
Pull Through, there are
26 listening posts. Check them all.
- Take Percy.
- Righto.
Fraser, you check the water line.
I want to know the depth from the surface.
I want to know where the water is ending up.
I want to know at exactly what depth the sand becomes clay.
- Take Tiffin with you.
- Sir.
Come on, Tiffin.
- To the left.
- Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep. That's another.
That's good. You got it.
Come out!
Nah. No, you're alright.
Bit bloody close.
Sniper shell, by the size of it.
Would have made a mess of your melon.
Saw one bloke hit by one of them - half his head blown off.
Only his smile left.
How old are you?
When they found out, they made me a stretcher bearer.
Keep me away from the horrors of war.
Stretcher bearers!
Stretcher bearers!
Over here.
Stretcher bearer!
Alright, come on. Let's go.
It's like trying to stop the tide with a bloody sandcastle.
Top level's mostly sand.
Clay starts around 30 feet.
Water seeps down, pools above the clay.
Where it finds a tunnel, it funnels down like a bloody creek.
We have 60 blokes manning the pumps night and day just to keep the water level down.
If we lose even a few of those men, bloody mines'll be useless.
Where did they get this lot?
The sappers are getting it wherever they can find it now, sir.
All the forests have been cut down or stonkered by shellin'.
That's oak.
Me dad's a carpenter.
After the war, I'm gonna get me apprenticeship.
Get out of them bloody pits.
More 'an likely, it came from that ruined church in town.
Church?
Cathedral. Ypres Cathedral.
Probably.
- That's the lowest point in the sap.
- 90 feet, yeah.
What if we sink a shaft directly to that point and get the water out that way?
Canadians have tried it.
So have the Tommies.
The whole middle section is unstable.
Shaft walls collapse after about six feet.
Besides, 90 feet vertical is a bloody long way to move water.
We've got electricity down there, don't we?
We propose sinking a shaft down to a gallery beneath the Berlin Sap, right here.
- Install electric pumps.
- Should free up 60 men at least.
Rutledge?
This is over 90 feet deep.
I shouldn't have thought an electric pump would lift water that high...
The new ones will, sir.
And this shaft simply isn't feasible.
This is not a new idea, sir.
It's impossible to go through the wet sand without the walls collapsing.
Have you been down there, Colonel?
Alright. That will be all.
Thank you, sir, and I apologise for taking up your valuable time.
General, our plans differ from the ones previously tried.
- How?
- We don't dig from the surface, sir.
We build the shaft head
20 feet below ground level.
We construct galleries large enough to house all the tunnellers and hide the blue clay.
Captain Woodward, 20 feet down will put you right in the middle of the quicksand.
You are wrong, Colonel!
It would set us just above the wet sand. That's the point.
We'll use steel sections to control the water and stop the walls collapsing.
We use jacks from the roof of the gallery to force the steel sections downwards.
And how many months or years do we imagine that this folly will take?
- Rough estimate?
- How long?
Three weeks, give or take.
Go, go, go!
Go! Keep going.
Aarggh!
Run! Run, boys, keep going.
Come on!
Aarggh!
One more.
Yep.
Shh. Shh.
We're nearly there.
Bucket it out. Get those jacks back up.
Have that steel section ready to go on my order.
Drive it further into the clay.
It's going, sir.
Not exactly gushing.
What's happening, Tiffin?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to be working.
No idea. It's working at that end.
Ridiculous.
Must be too much pressure.
I'm sure we...
Full report by the morning.
Yes!
- What if the pump fails?
- We have backups standing by, sir.
Off the shaft head, we've built two listening posts and two diversion tunnels.
- What diversion tunnels?
- I'll show you, sir.
There's no need.
- It's no trouble.
- There is no need.
There's more activity in the second diversion, sir.
I think Fritz is coming at us again.
That means it's working.
He's been quiet for four minutes.
I reckon he could be ready to blow.
Let them.
Is it just the two of you down there?
- Just me, sir.
- Where's Walt?
He's up getting me a billy of tea.
What? He abandoned his post?
- No, he just...
- Put it on the report.
Why aren't you at your post?
- As I said, I think Fritz...
- Have you been ordered out?
Sir, the listeners have permission...
I know the orders, Captain!
Get back down there.
If you see Walt, you tell him... you tell him not to...
Sir...
My dad likes a cup of tea around now.
Jim.
Jim!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Jim!
Dad!
Daddy, can you hear me? Dad!
Restore, establish and strengthen you forever and ever, amen.
Amen.
Sir?
I've been wanting to give you this...
...for that girl of yours, sir.
I made it from that wood you liked...
...from the cathedral.
It's beautiful.
This box was made from the timbers of Ypres Cathedral by a nice young chap named Frank
Tiffin.
I'm sure you'll get to meet him after this is over and thank him for his handiwork.
- What is it?
- Not sure.
15 degrees, about 20ft forward,
15ft down.
Nothing.
An attack tunnel?
No, it's different.
- I think it's some kind of shaft.
- Through the wet sand?
No. Can't be.
Come on!
Come on!
Du, nach oben.
Woodward? Woodward?
Woodward!
Captain Woodward, get up!
We're firing the mines Thursday morning, just before dawn.
That's in 36 hours.
You'll be firing the Hill 60 and caterpillar mines.
McBride, you'll have the back-up exploders.
Sir.
There'll be 21 blasts in all.
Yours will be the final two in the sequence.
It's critical to the entire operation that each mine goes off precisely in the right order.
Yes, sir.
Firing orders.
Attention.
You were on listening duty?
All quiet, sir, apart from a few squeaks.
- Rats?
- Probably.
Probably rats mating, sir, by the sound of them.
Why do you say that?
They were kind of regular squeaks, if you get my drift.
Where?
Lower listening post, Berlin Sap.
Windlass.
It's a shaft.
Right here.
That's right on top of the mine at Hill 60.
We've been counting the squeaks for 15 minutes now.
- I've calculated the depth...
- Yes.
63 feet, sir.
We blow in 10 hours.
When do you predict they'd hit the mine?
At their current rate of progress, nine hours, sir.
I hold you personally responsible.
Do what you have to do, Woodward.
- We're driving an attack tunnel.
- From where, sir?
Lower Berlin Sap listening post to position 6-0.
- That's just above the mine.
- Yes.
That's suicidal.
That's an order, Sergeant.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!
They're 10 feet forward, 15 feet up.
Morris.
Resistance is good.
Check it again.
Were the leads reconnected after the last test?
Mm-hm.
29 minutes.
I'm going back down.
Clear, please.
Out of the way!
Some tea coming.
On three.
One...
...two...
...three.
They're almost on top of us.
I've gotta set the charge.
No. That'll set off the main mine.
Wait till they're a few feet away.
Then use the camouflet.
A few feet?
Another four feet forward.
There's no time.
Four feet forward, Fraser.
Then set the charge.
Set the charge.
Finish the backing, boys.
They did it.
Guess what, Mutter?
I'm coming home.
Voomp!
Splat!
Go easy, boys.
Load up. Let's get out of here.
Nein, nein! Schnell! Schnell!
Fritz will be landing in Berlin right about now.
- All clear below?
- Yes, sir.
The German shaft has been crumped.
All circuits are complete.
Five minutes!
Five minutes!
Five minutes! Five minutes!
Five minutes!
This is our great occasion.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Four minutes to go.
- Did it easy.
- Yeah.
Man buried!
- Who is it?
- It's Tiffin! He's back there!
Fuck.
Go! Go!
Tiffin!
Tiffin!
Sarge?
It's gonna take some time to shift this.
I'll get them to hold the mine.
Well, what do we do?
Tiffin!
Just go.
No point in all of us dying.
Fraser will get them to stop!
We'll come back when we know!
Righto!
'Bye, Tiffin!
Come on, Walt! Come on!
Cheerio, lads.
One minute!
Out of the way, please! Move!
Fuckin' move!
Fix bayonets!
Out of the way! Move!
Out of the way! Make way!
Out of the fuckin' way!
20 seconds!
Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!
- Out of the fuckin' way!
- 15 seconds!
Tiffin's still in there.
- What happened?
- Collapse.
Sir, please.
10 seconds!
- He's still alive.
- Nine!
Eight!
We'd have him out in a few minutes.
Seven!
Six!
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Woodward!
- Two!
For Christ's sake! It's
Tiffin!
Fire!
That's your heart.
Feel it?
You're hearing your own heartbeat.
Woodward.
People are waiting.
Woody, are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'll be out shortly.
You right?
In Vail, Colorado,
the nation's busiest ski resort was hit today by a fire.
Arson is suspected.
You may have heard of the Earth Liberation Front.
The attorney general himself says it's a domestic terrorist organization.
The F.B.I. Says it is one of the most dangerous groups in the country.
The E.L.F. Has claimed responsibility...
for more than two dozen major acts of ecoterrorism since 1996.
The fire bombings include attacks on lumber mills,
wild horse corrals and two meatpacking plants.
So far, not one of the cases has ever been solved,
and authorities acknowledge they know next to nothing...
about the membership or the leadership of the organization.
On December 7, 2005,
four federal agents entered my wife's office...
and arrested one ofher employees...
Daniel McGowan.
It was part of a nationwide roundup...
that eventually netted 14 members...
of the radical environmental group, the Earth Liberation Front.
In all, their trail of destruction resulted... in millions of dollars of property damage.
Today's indictment is a significant step... in bringing these terrorists to justice.
Weeks after his arrest,
Daniel's sister put up everything she owned for bail,
and he was placed on house arrest in her apartment...
to wait for trial.
In 2001, I was involved with the Earth Liberation Front.
And I was involved in two separate arsons in one year.
I think, like, people look at my case, and they think, "What if that motherfucker burned down my house?"
I think people think it's just a bunch of young crazies... walking around with gas cans lighting shit on fire that pisses them off.
And then they think, "What if I burned things that pissed me off?
That's kinda crazy. "
You know?
Which it is kinda crazy.
But I think people just need to understand that... this thing is complex and it's not that simple.
It's hideous to be called a terrorist.
There was no one in any of these facilities.
No one got hurt.
No one was injured.
And yet I'm facing life plus 335 years.
I split my time between talking to my lawyers.
I do a lot of research on my case.
You know, all my legal documents...
DVDs and CDs and video and photos. Audiotapes.
Hi. This is Daniel McGowan.
I know that my lawyer sent you the brief... that is being filed with the court today, but it's basically about...
As Daniel is preparing for trial,
the government is putting pressure on him and his codefendants to take a deal.
Either they plead guilty and testify against each other...
or go to trial and risk life in prison.
I told my lawyers at our first meeting,
"Don't ever bring up cooperation as a tactic.
We're never gonna cooperate. You don't have that card in your back pocket.
Don't bring it up. "
All the people in this group had conversations back in the day about this.
Like, you know, "You get arrested, just don't say a word.
Just get a lawyer and, like, we'll, you know, join up and we'll see what happens. "
Okay. Thanks, Andrea.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
My family has done a tremendous amount of stuff for me.
I mean, letting me live here.
But we choose to live our lives very differently.
Like, I compost.
I had never used a dishwasher in my life until I moved in here.
And I try not to impose my way of doing things on anyone here, but, yeah, we have different ways of doing things.
No, I don't think I need that, because we paint every edge.
All right.
All right. Bye.
I'd be a liar if I called myself an environmentalist.
I mean, I care about the environment.
I think about the environment.
Um...
I recycle.
But I don't recycle every single piece of paper like Danny does.
When he came home from college, he lived with me in Rockland.
One day I came home, and he took the label... off every single canned good I had... because he was, like, so obsessed with recycling.
He was like, "If we recycle, we have to take the labels off the cans. "
I said, "But you took the labels off every can.
I don't even know what I have in the cans now.
I don't know if they're soup.
I don't know what kind of soup.
I don't know if they're peas or they're corn. "
And he's like,
"I never thought of that. "
It was, like, I opened my cupboard, and there was just all tin cans.
I got a call from Jenny, uh, totally hysterical, upset, saying that some men came in and took Daniel from his job.
My dad's first reaction was like,
"Oh, I don't know my son anymore. "
And I think he was just in shock.
It's funny. Growing up, he wasn't the political kid that was fighting for anything.
No, he was just a regular kid.
Played with his friends, rode his bike.
It wasn't like he, you know, had this whole history.
But, you know, you don't know what's inside someone until they get older... and they start to think about who they are.
I was born in 1974 in Brooklyn.
I moved to Rockaway when I was around three... Rockaway Beach in Queens.
It's like mostly, you know, working class people.
My dad was a cop in the New York Police Department.
I went to high school at a place called Christ the King.
Catholic high school.
And I was a track runner, and, you know,
I got scholarships and stuff like that.
And then when I got to college,
I was like,
"Oh, I guess I'll major in Business, because that's practical. "
When I graduated, I got a job... at a massive public relations company called Burson-Marsteller.
During this time period, at some point along the way,
I ran into a woman collecting signatures at Union Square.
She kept telling me about Wetlands... the Wetlands Environmental Center.
And that kinda was where it changed.
It was basically... The idea was it was a bar that had live shows, but the profits would go to running an environmental center.
So I went to this meeting, and they played these films that blew my mind.
I had never seen with my own eyes... what kind of world we lived in.
I feel like I'm in perpetual mourning, and I have been from the moment that, like...
I don't know... I kind of took the blinders off and was, like,
"Holy crap.
What the hell are we doing?"
And I got involved pretty much instantly.
I protested constantly.
I did letter writing a lot.
I did letter writing every week at Wetlands.
I wrote hundreds of protest letters to all sorts of different agencies.
And at the time they announced that there was gonna be... a national gathering in Crandon, Wisconsin.
So I went.
You know, I mean, I was shy.
A city kid. I didn't...
I mean, I liked nature as a concept, but I was, like, never had slept outside before in my whole life.
I was like 22.
It was, like, different than anything I have ever seen.
We went swimming in, like, a creek.
We were, like, going out on logs and jumping off.
We were skinny-dipping.
I mean, all this stuff was new.
You know, traditionally at the end of the rendezvous, they have a big action.
We went to town and had a protest at the mine office.
And I actually ended up being arrested.
And it was really eye opening, you know, to kinda learn about this different world... and this, like, environmental resistance movement.
I'm a fourth-generation Oregonian.
Um, grew up in Eugene.
My brother works in a mill.
My uncles own mills.
It's something that, if you're from the Northwest, it's something you do.
I think I met Daniel here in Eugene.
They called him, uh,
"the disgruntled one," just because he had sort of this nasty sort of attitude... and he was always sort of bitter.
And he was always sort of pissed off... and he'd always challenge people for their "stupid ideas. "
And so, uh, you know, they sort of coined this nickname for him, "the disgruntled one. "
I think Daniel arrived out here about '99... 1999.
But to really understand, you know, why these arsons were set,
I think you gotta go all the way back... to a time when Daniel was still living back east.
You gotta go to about 1995, which was, uh, the Warner Creek timber sale.
Warner Creek's about 50 miles east of Eugene, and it's probably one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.
And in 1995, the Forest Service decided to open it up for logging.
People went up there and created a blockade... on a federal logging road to try to prevent, you know, the logging of this place.
So we created a documentary called Pickaxe, which is the story of Warner Creek.
There's more vehicles on the way. Over.
One grader followed by one Dudley.
We don't think you guys have the right... to take a protected forest teeming with life, you know, bid it and log it.
For a long time, people were fighting the Forest Service... through, like, holding signs, letter writing... sort of a sort of a hippie-type approach to protest.
But there was this new kind of protest that was becoming popular.
People would call it sabotage, or monkey-wrenching.
They would glue locks.
They'd pull up survey stakes.
They would maybe put sugar in gas tanks of bulldozers.
At Warner Creek, you know, just a simple little blockade... turned into an all-out assault... on the only way into that forest.
Protesters dug a series of trenches... to keep logging trucks from getting to the forest.
And then they built the wall.
It looked like an old fort from the wild, wild West... and it had a drawbridge, and it was really a cool blockade.
We're drawing a line in the sand, and you can't come in here and destroy this place.
And they stayed up there for about a year.
As a federal law enforcement officer, it is my duty to inform you that you're in violation.
You have five minutes to get out of here, and you have actually less than five minutes.
Early one morning, the Forest Service came up...
And arrested the protesters...
- Okay.
- And knocked down the wall.
That created a lot of bitterness toward the Forest Service.
And soon after, things began to escalate.
The first time I metJacob Ferguson was at Warner Creek.
He was sort of a cool dude. He didn't say much. He just did a lot of work.
But I think it's really hard to know Jacob Ferguson... unless you're on the in... inside ofJacob's life.
This is the house
I moved into right over here.
And right at that time, Jacob
Ferguson was living right over there.
ButJacob, uh, was a pirate.
He was, uh... He was definitely, um, an outlaw.
Yeah!
He tried to play a bad boy image, and he did it well, because I think he really was one.
After Warner Creek,
I think he really felt... that the Forest Service was getting away with stuff.
I think most of America feels the U.S.
Forest Service's job is to protect the forest.
But the Forest Service is a part of the Department of Agriculture.
And the Department of Agriculture... looks upon these forests as crops.
The U.S. Forest Service's real job is to provide trees for these timber companies... so they can cut these trees from our national forests.
They were cutting down these massive old-growth trees, up to 750, even a thousand years old that were just massive.
But I thinkJake was tired of the talk.
He was tired of just, you know, philosophizing.
"You guys," you know...
"You through talking shit now, or what?
Let's do it. "
This investigation was... the largest domestic terrorism case... in the history of the United States.
And the very first E.L.F. Action that occurred in the United States... occurred at two ranger stations in the district of Oregon.
Mainstream, legitimate environmental activists... were absolutely shocked... and disgusted with the fire, and they saw the burning of the Oakridge Ranger Station... as a public relations disaster.
In the months after the ranger station fires,
there was a split within the environmental movement.
In Eugene, which was quickly becoming a hotbed of activism,
a growing community of younger environmentalists cheered on the arsons.
But most environmentalists argued that, in a democracy,
public protest was still a better way of making change.
In the summer of'97,
just a few months after the ranger station fires,
an event took place in downtown Eugene...
that for many shook up the debate.
There was this place downtown... that had 40 old heritage trees... just beautiful.
And they were gonna put in a parking lot for Symantec, this big corporation next door.
And they were gonna cut down the trees to do it.
Activists began mobilizing to save the trees,
but as they prepared to take the issue to the next city council meeting,
the city suddenly announced that it would cut the trees...
one day before that public hearing.
On Sunday morning, about 2:30 in the morning, about 11 people went up into the trees... to prevent them from being cut.
We just went and did it, hoping that we could stave off the cutting... for one day until that public hearing.
Just for one day so the citizens could talk to the city council... the next day about saving them.
They came in right away wearing riot gear... and gas masks and stuff like that.
So, uh, bang, bang, bang on the door at 8:00 in the morning.
Some kid says,
"Get out there! Get out there!
They're pepper-spraying them in the trees!
Get your camera. You gotta get there!
I mean, they're pepper-spraying them right now!"
Hang in there, Jim!
They came up in the fire truck bucket, and they cut my pants leg up to my groin... so they could spray my leg with pepper spray.
Cutting, you know, their pants and pepper-spraying them in the ass... and pepper-spraying them in the balls... while they were hanging from the limbs 40 feet up.
People were on the street looking at this and going,
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?"
And so people were radicalized.
They started jumping on the fence and going,
"Quit that shit!"
They're tear-gassing the crowd and pepper-spraying the crowd.
It was just a crazy, frantic scene that day.
And they used about
12 to 15 cans on Flynn, and he stayed up for, I think, about six or seven hours, man.
No!
And then they flushed me with a bunch of water, took me to the hospital and then took me to jail.
So for the next, you know, 35 hours,
I was soaking in pepper spray.
My hands were orange for a week.
And so the argument that you need to work within the system... was pretty well dashed by what the cops did on that day in Eugene.
And June 1 was really the day... that pissed off a lot of people in this town.
I remember reading about it.
People were like,
"Oh, we have this footage. "
And, you know, it was really intense.
And that kind of stuff, like... that's part of the story.
That was, like, part of the backdrop.
It's crazy. It's crazy.
I think a lot of moments like that... really erode people's belief that anything can actually change.
Next week it's four months that I'm on house arrest.
There is no construction on...
My days here are really tedious.
It's just really hard to focus and do anything.
Just thinking about my future and how uncertain it is.
I get really sad at night, you know.
I prefer to sleep straight through so I don't have those moments, but I have them almost every night, so...
I've been doing okay though, you know, all things considered.
I mean, I feel like, on one level,
I just have to be really thankful for what I have, which is, like, a good family and really good friends, and so I try to, like, keep things in perspective.
Hold on one second.
Hi.
Hey. How are you?
Great. How you doing?
Good.
Daniel was living with his girlfriend...
when he was arrested,
and she's moved into his sister's apartment to be with him.
You know, people are all different, and some other people, if they were in my position, they might have been totally, like, questioning everything.
But it just... It's not me.
I think that he feels the dread every single day.
It definitely removes... some of the life from his personality.
Hello?
Hey, what's up?
How are you?
Wait, wait, wait.
So wait, wait.
I'm sorry.
He's cooperating to the full extent?
Six of Daniel's codefendants...
have appeared in court to accept plea deals.
In exchange for reduced sentences,
they've agreed to testify in the government's case against the remaining defendants.
It hurts that people that
I trusted and cared about, you know, turned their back on me.
To be a cooperating witness, it's something other people can do.
I'm just not gonna do it, because I just have to live with myself, and I'm not gonna be that person and start spewing out crap... just to, like, get myself out of a situation that's not very pleasant.
So...
I'd want him to do whatever he needed to do to not go to prison.
But I would never want him to compromise... his values or beliefs.
So if he has to choose, he'll be facing life in prison.
I made the choice to be with him, and after he was arrested
I made the choice to stay with him.
I mean, that's what you do when you're... when you're in a relationship with someone.
Just because something really difficult comes up... doesn't mean you just run away, you know?
So...
I think we should get married.
Daniel, I've seen you with Jenny, and you're wonderful with her.
You're good for each other, you have great chemistry, and... And I love you both.
Congratulations.
This kid faces 335 years plus life in prison, and he's getting married.
I want to kinda grab the positive... and think that this is gonna work out in the end, everything's gonna be okay, and, you know, there's nothing to stress about, but... there is.
Hey.
Oh, if it isn't my sister.
How are you?
How are you? Perfect timing. Ah, I'm friggin' hot.
- That's why I'm out here.
- Let me see your ring.
Oh.
And by "nicer," she means more money.
It's diamonds!
His ring is made out of, like, some recycled type metal... that doesn't hurt anything or anybody, and mine's made of good old diamonds.
Come on, let's go have a good time.
It's easy to discount the environmental movement... as a bunch of wackos and hippies and arsonists.
But it's not like that.
There are businessmen and, you know, moms and dads and scientists and loggers themselves.
There are people from every walk of life that get involved in this.
I've spent several years of my life... doing logging in the woods.
I come with a little different perspective than a lot of the, you know, the environmental crowd or the, you know, the logging crowd.
I've got a little of both in me.
I'm okay with cutting down trees.
I just don't have an issue with it.
But I'm not okay with cutting them all down.
The industry tends to call environmentalists radical.
The reality is that 95%... of the standing native forests in the United States have been cut down.
It's not radical to try and save the last five percent.
What's radical is logging 95%.
This is radical.
This is a piece of a big old tree.
This tree probably sprouted just about the time...
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
It looks about 500 years old, somewhere in there.
You know, the suckers, if they could talk, would probably say it'd been pretty boring up until about 75 years ago... when all hell broke loose out here on the ridge, and they started cutting them down.
Most of them are gone now, so we won't be seeing any of these... for at least another 500 years, and that's if we leave them alone.
These are amazing old trees.
I moved out west in October of'98.
I got out to Northern California.
I had never seen trees like that before.
It had a really profound impact on me.
I was already quite radicalized, but I couldn't believe the fact that people accepted what was going on.
I have memories of, like... like, for the first time seeing log trucks, you know, and being like, "Whoa. "
You saw the mills.
Or you go on into the forest and stumble upon a clear-cut.
Like, it just blew me away.
Just the arrogance of it.
I was like,
"Man, this is butchered. "
You know? It made me think, like,
"Why are we being so gentle?
Why are we so gentle in our activism when this is what's happening, you know?"
After the ranger station fires,
Jake Ferguson and members of the fledgling E.L. F...
set their sights on new targets.
They came across an Associated Press article...
about the rounding up of wild horses from government land.
The horses were being sent to slaughterhouses,
including the Cavel West plant...
in nearby Redmond, Oregon.
There were so many horses being processed at the plant...
that horse blood would sometimes overwhelm...
the town's water treatment facility...
and shut it down.
And for 10 years,
people from the area had tried,
and failed, to stop the plant.
But on July 21, 1997,
Jake Ferguson and three others slipped into the facility in the middle of the night...
and burned it to the ground.
The company was never able to rebuild,
and the arson became a model for the group.
In one night, they had accomplished...
what years ofletter writing and picketing had never been able to do.
They expanded and took on new targets.
They burned timber company headquarters,
a Bureau of Land Management office...
and a $ 12 million ski lodge at Vail, Colorado...
to protest the resort's expansion into national forest.
An E.L.F. Press office was opened...
by activists who did not know the identities of the E.L.F. Members.
- That's that.
- How do they contact you?
- Anonymously.
- But... I mean, what is that?
Like a package dropped on your doorstep? Well, it can be...
They publicized the fires and explained the group's actions.
When a building burns down, they have to do a news story about it.
That's why the Earth Liberation Front burned down the building in the first place:
To get exposure.
We were there to help explain why that building burned down, what it was doing in the first place that was angering people so much.
A lot of what the Earth
Liberation Front did... was considered economic sabotage.
These corporations exist to make money.
All of a sudden they're losing money, so they have to reassess their activities.
Another thing that happens is that the building... that was dumping toxic waste, for example, into the river one day... is unable dump that waste tomorrow.
The press office encouraged people to start their own E.L.F. Cells,
but mandated that their fires not harm any life.
Take initiative, form your own cell... and do what needs to be done to protect all life on this planet.
The idea spread,
and new, anonymous cells popped up in other parts of the country.
The Earth Liberation Front is turning up the heat again,
igniting devastating blazes all across the country.
A biology lab at the University of Minnesota.
Bloomington, Indiana.
New York's Long Island.
Now some say E.L.F.
Is in New England.
Back in Eugene, people were celebrating.
We had no idea that it was people from our neighborhood... and they were friends of ours, but we were hearing about what was happening.
We were celebrating.
I don't think it was just the E.L.F.
That started ratcheting things up.
I think activists all over the Northwest were also kicking it up a notch.
They thought there was a possibility... of really making things change.
Just have to work at it a little harder and get a little more radical.
He's not turning it off.
He knows someone's locked under.
There's an old woman.
She's 80 years old!
There was a sort of a progression of radicalism... that happened in Eugene.
And so the police were also amping up their presence... because we were amping up our presence.
Literally, we were having two protests a week.
You know, major protests.
And so you can imagine what law enforcement went like.
I was doing undercover work around the Eugene area.
We were looking for some of these individuals... that were causing mayhem around Eugene.
I think it was well known in the movement... that they could probe and push and get us to react... in a way that oftentimes didn't look very good.
Get back! Get back!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, get back!
Get back! Get back!
But we were getting rocks and bottles... and that kind of thing... fire... thrown at us, you know.
It just hadn't happened before.
Out of the street!
You fucker!
To say that emotions don't play into that would be folly.
I mean, that's not true.
It is personal to take a rock.
No!
And people's views got hardened and more radicalized... from what the police were doing to them within Eugene, or other campaigns that were going on around the Northwest.
Are you gonna release?
Why are you doing this to us?
Okay. Are you going to release?
Who's gonna release?
Oh, I love you!
I love you.
I only did one eye. I'm gonna do the other eye if you don't release.
Please don't hurt me!
Leave her alone!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!
When those people were getting attacked... and stepped on and pepper-sprayed in their face while they were locked down,
I thought, "Protest and civil disobedience... What's the point?
Why bother?" You know?
It's not getting us anywhere.
We're getting victimized by their police, you know.
I don't know. I think I, like a lot of people I knew at the time, experienced a massive loss of faith... in that systemic change could happen through, you know, the system regulating itself or reforming itself.
Good evening.
When the World Trade Summit was planned for Seattle, the administration obviously hoped it would be a triumph for Bill Clinton... in the closing months of his presidency.
Instead, it's been a nightmare of protests and demonstrations in the streets.
In 1999,
tens of thousands of people converged on Seattle...
to protest the W. T.O. And its effect on the environment and labor.
They blockaded the streets using nonviolent civil disobedience.
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!
The police responded with force to clear the streets.
You're shooting poison!
But while the authorities were focused on the demonstrators,
another group appeared that included current and future members of the E.L.F.
I had met these people in Seattle, and I was introduced to kind of a larger group of individuals.
Back to the sidewalk!
Here we are in our black clothes.
You know, downtown Seattle is just full of corporations... that are wrecking devastation and destruction on the planet, and people were just like,
"Okay, let's do it. "
These businesses, they're not gonna bow to people dancing in the street.
They're not gonna bow to people dressed as, you know, giant sea turtles or so on.
They care about one thing.
They care about capital.
Unless we put a dent in their pocket, what good... How are you gonna do that?
How are you gonna put a dent in their pocket?
Hopefully by causing property damage.
# Yeah #
I'd never breathed tear gas, pepper spray... or saw rubber bullets or concussion grenades until that point.
It was, like, insane. I really felt like,
"This is like a war zone. "
Like, wow. Holy crap.
# Yeah #
It felt good to take out my rage on these corporate windows... because they had caused so much destruction, in my mind.
Stop it! Stop it!
It created, obviously, a huge conversation and a dialogue and fight.
This is not what the protest was about!
People work hard for their property!
Vandalism is vandalism.
Destruction is destruction, whether it's of lives or property.
It's not acceptable.
What do you think of the Boston Tea Party?
I thought it was wonderful!
Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.
Fifty cents!
Read all about it!
I think people have a very
Pollyanna viewpoint of social change.
No real social change has happened without pressure, without force, without... some would say... intimidating governments and corporations into changing their behavior.
Oh, it's so weird to talk about this stuff. Um...
I took part in the black bloc at W.T.O.
And the goal of the black bloc... was to just send a message, an anticapitalist message... that consumer America is destroying the world and destroying the planet.
And that was the first time we met a lot of the other people... that ended up being involved in the arsons.
After the W.T.O.,
I decided to move to Eugene... to keep in touch with some of these people that I met in Seattle.
And I started becoming a really different person.
Daniel was very involved in the issues... and ideas surrounding Eugene.
He was very social.
He seemed to know everybody, and everybody seemed to know him, including the cops.
Daniel was kind of known as a leader around the area.
Um, you know, he would show up at protests or gatherings, and you can always see that he was somebody that people looked up to.
You know, you see who's serious and who's not... based on how they're acting, what they're saying.
And so somewhere along the line it became obvious... that, like, I was someone that was interested in doing other stuff.
I metJake in the neighborhood.
There was some allure about him just being quiet and kind of to himself.
And being there really set some things in motion.
The more radical environmental community have, in my opinion, a misconception about this industry and what we do.
It's more than just a job.
You know, I'm a third-generation lumberman.
My son works in the industry.
I want him to carry on, and when he has kids, I want them to carry on.
You can't be in the lumber industry without having trees to cut.
So it's ridiculous for people to think we're gonna go out there and cut the last tree.
I think the biggest misconception is that... we're out there just knocking the forest down, we're just... we're termites.
We just rampage through the forest and we leave it a mess and we move on.
Does it have an impact?
Certainly.
Nobody likes the looks of a fresh harvest.
But we really do regrow these trees.
You know, we plant six trees for every tree we harvest.
That's the law.
I mean, it's just flat-out the law.
And people don't break the law. You just can't get away with it in Oregon or anyplace else.
Being an environmentalist is simply respecting the land... and the atmosphere around you.
In that regard, I'm an environmentalist.
Eugene has a commercial railroad that goes through town.
It wasn't uncommon to see just, like, plywood after plywood... and company names, you know, stamped onto it.
That's definitely how I heard about Superior Lumber.
Just by seeing their half-mile-long train full of forest go by.
They were logging old growth, logging just massive trees, and out of areas that had previously been pretty inaccessible.
Sometimes when you see things you love being destroyed, you just want to destroy those things.
So I felt like the action was justified.
We were quite surprised that we had been targeted.
I believe I was invited to participate in Superior Lumber... by Meyerhoff to be a lookout, along with Suzanne.
But I metJacob and Kevin right before the action... Kevin Tubbs.
They got together some weeks before, did a surveillance of it.
It was in an isolated area.
There was no viable security there.
They figured out where... they should place the devices.
They came back and prepared the devices.
Put them in plastic
Tupperware containers.
Made sure that the containers were fingerprint-free, D.N.A. Clean.
They always wore gloves.
I felt nervous from the get-go.
For one, we were...
I was staying in this house where everything was stored.
And it was someone else's house that didn't know about the action.
On the night of the arson, they drove to the staging area.
They put on their masks.
They did radio checks.
They had a police scanner.
It's positively nerve-racking.
I used to get really sick before actions and, like, throw up... and just get, like, nervous and, like, just in a zone, you know.
I mean, I think that you have to get...
When you're doing something that intense, even as a lookout, you're just, like, freaked out,
'cause you just don't know how anything's gonna go.
I was in the back of the van, and I was actually kind of by myself in the back of the van, so I was just kind of thinking to myself, and I think Kevin and Jake were in the front of the van.
They were just listening to music, and so it was fairly relaxed.
People weren't really talking a whole lot, but, you know, your adrenaline's going.
Miss Savoie and Mr. McGowan were the lookouts, and they staged north and south of the building.
I was stationed at a pay phone.
You know, everybody else was dressed in all black... because everyone wanted to blend into the night.
However, I dressed in somewhat darker clothing, but I looked fairly normal.
I just had a scarf that I could wrap around my face in case somebody passed by.
And then I got dropped off kind of on the side of the road, and I just kinda crawled into this, like, space, this, like, shoulder, you know, with a bunch of ivy.
Mr. Meyerhoff and Mr. Ferguson then placed... the five-gallon fuel containers... and activated the timing devices.
It was done within, you know, 15 minutes, and I got picked up, and away we went.
It was somewhere between
2:00 and 3:00 a. M... when I was home, sound asleep, and I got a phone call.
And, of course, anytime you get a phone call... at 2:00 a. m. In the morning, it's not good news.
It turned the office into just a fiery oven.
I mean, I don't know how hot it got in here, but we had keyboards that were...
I mean, you couldn't tell one key from the other. They were just melted together.
I went up to Portland and wrote the communiqué and sent it in.
Even then, it wasn't real. It was just still kind of this cartoonish thing.
And it wasn't real until
I really saw the newspapers... seeing the man from the company...
I think Steve Swanson... just walking through these, like, charred remains, and I was just like, "Holy crap. "
That was a major blow to our mental psyche, at least in the short run.
Just felt like, you know, a big hole in my heart.
In Eugene, people were jazzed.
When the big, bad bully gets, you know, hit in the stomach... and feels a little something... and maybe a little fear or whatever, that felt good.
It was exciting. The next day, I felt, you know, like,
"Wow. I've actually done something where it stopped. "
I didn't have a problem with what I was doing. I thought it was effective.
It was a million dollars or something like that.
You know, it's like, when you're involved with it and you're in the thick of it, it's hard to look at, like, all the consequences... and, like, the real repercussions of that.
Like, you know, did this action push them in a better direction?
Did it scare them?
Did it help the movement in any capacity on old-growth logging?
There's lots of questions, but I don't think at the time...
I was asking those questions too much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally.
All right.
Well, um, that's great.
I guess I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay. Bye.
Yes!
Awesome!
All right, that's great.
I'm off the system.
I am off house arrest technically right now.
Hey. I'm off.
Sweet!
Seven months and two days.
With seven months of good behavior,
Daniel's lawyers have convinced the government that he's not a flight risk.
What do you think about that?
I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
No, I'm joking.
Are you kidding me?
I don't care how tired I am.
We're doing something.
Of course I'm gonna get off house arrest on this day.
Like, of all days, like, it'll be today, you know.
It's really sad for me to, like, have all these feelings about my home being attacked, my city being attacked.
I mean, when I tell people that, like,
I'm accused of being a terrorist, like, whether it's "eco" or
"domestic" in front of it, or if it's just straight "terrorist," it's ludicrous to me.
It's, like, surreal. And most people that know me are like, "What?"
No one's accused in my case of flying planes, bombing things, trying to hurt people.
None of these things.
No one's accused of that.
It's property destruction. Like, that's what it is. Call it what it is, you know.
It's gone! Yay!
I look naked, right?
You did it!
How you doing?
Okay. How you doing?
Look at my freak-ass ankle.
I actually ran a little bit 'cause I wanted to feel what it was like to run.
I'm so tired.
My feet hurt, my legs hurt.
I just had a knee pain.
It was horrible.
As time went on, the cell members... had to become better and better and better at their craft.
And their craft was destruction.
And so they started what was called the "book club. "
They would train one another on how to build incendiary devices.
And they would go out and test all these things.
So they knew how long it would take...
You know, at this time of night and this kind of weather, how long will it take for this thing to ignite?
What type of fuel would work the best?
They wouldn't buy all the ingredients from the same store.
Even if the same store had the two or three items that they'd need, they would go to a completely different store, you know,
30, 40 miles away so it wouldn't ever be tracked.
It was called the book club because they also utilized certain codes.
At the meeting they were told,
"This is the book we'll be using. "
And then you'd have to use your book... that would associate what page number, what line number, what word number, and that's how you would decode the message to tell you where to go.
And some of the members of the book club then... were well versed in computer sciences, and they brought in P.G.P. Encryption and showed the other members how to do that.
There was a lot of, like, having good covers for why you're leaving town.
Why you're not...
You know, where you're going.
Having really good stories that made sense, that were consistent, that you told everyone... your job, your family, everything.
Not dressing like activists per se.
We didn't really look like what you'd think we would look like.
I mean, if you saw people walking down the street, you would never think,
"That's the E.L.F."
It made a lot of sense of why there wasn't any evidence, why they weren't caught sooner.
They were really good at what they did.
In May of 2001,
members of the E.L.F. Launched an attack against two sites at once,
a first for the organization.
The first target was an office at the University of Washington,
where a scientist was doing genetic research on trees...
with a grant from the timber industry.
The second target was the
Jefferson Poplar Tree Farm,
where the group believed that genetically engineered trees...
were being developed for paper production.
In the previous arson,
Daniel had been a lookout.
But this time he took a much more active role.
They rented a motel room.
They set up a tent inside the motel room.
They put on painter suits, triple-thick gloves.
They made the devices.
One team went to
University of Washington, and the other team traveled down to Clatskanie in Oregon, toJefferson Poplar Farms.
Clatskanie is a really small town.
We were desperately trying to avoid a traffic stop, because it's just, like, we're pretty much screwed if we got stopped.
There's way too many people in the car dressed in all black.
The driver of the vehicle was Miss Savoie.
Miss Zacher served as a lookout.
And then the three men, which was Mr. Meyerhoff,
Mr. McGowan and Mr. Block, took the fuel loads and the timers to the targets.
We checked that no one's there. Like, climb around, look around. No one's in there.
We'd been there previous.
No one's there.
The cleaning ladies were there, like, much earlier.
We set up all the devices and all the buckets.
They put little tubs full of fuel... underneath the vehicles, and they put soaked rags, and they'd run the rags from vehicle to vehicle to vehicle.
And the towel just goes and goes and it goes and it goes.
And it's tied together... sheets... and it's just an absolute mess.
They were careful to take the trucks with the fuel tanks, fill the beds of the vehicles with fuel.
I'm standing there.
I'm drenched in gasoline.
We're about to burn
13 huge S.U.V.'s, and I was just, like,
"What am I doing?"
But we take spray paint.
Myself and another person go out to the shed, and I write "E.L.F." on one side in pretty huge letters, and the other person writes
"You cannot control what is wild. "
There's the "E,"
"L," and "F."
Everything was basically fully engulfed when I got here.
With all the vehicles and the fuel tanks... and so forth, there was lots of propellant in the area... to make things burn, and things went up fast and hot.
911. What is your emergency?
Ma'am, we've got a big fire over here...
Okay.
Investigators in the Pacific Northwest... strongly suspect that two nearly simultaneous fires... were acts of ecological terror.
Monday morning, May 24,
I got back to Eugene, and I was just, like,
"Wow, I really need to think about what I just did. "
Just seeing, you know, absolute ruins... and realizing that, like, all people were gonna focus on... was the fact that things were destroyed, and that the issues are being lost... and all they care about is catching the people that did it.
They were talking about
Jefferson Poplar, and then they were talking about University of Washington.
So finding out what eventually happened at University of Washington... the massive destruction to a library.
Not just the professor's office that was involved in this sort of research, but the Center for Urban Horticulture.
I was like, "This is too much, too fast, too big. What am I doing?"
Not only had the fire...
at the University of Washington gotten out of control,
they also discovered that theJefferson Poplar arson...
was based on faulty information.
It turned out that while the previous owners of the property...
had been involved with genetic engineering,
the new owners only had hybrid trees,
developed using farming methods that have been around for hundreds of years.
It's hard to really justify it in hindsight.
Nobody would have targeted that facility had we known... that there was no genetic engineering going on there at the time.
So it left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.
Kind of like, "Wow.
Look at this huge, intense action.
And look what happened in Washington. "
And like, "Am I really ready for this?"
Like, this is super serious and super big.
We went to the meeting a few weeks afterwards, and I was like,
"This is too much. "
Some members of the group were questioning the actions,
but there were others who felt they hadn't gone far enough.
Some of them decided that they wanted to target basically captains of industry.
Target people now, not just property.
The last circle meeting... basically cleaved between people that seemingly... wanted to talk about it... not even, like, plan it...
But they were like,
"We should talk about it. "
And the people that were repulsed by it.
And really that, like, ideological divide is what ended it.
That was... That was it.
What people were discussing, with my experiences of the arson... it made my mind kind of like... spin.
It's things like this that led me to think this is futile.
There's gotta be better ways of addressing what's going on in the world... than just burning things down.
As the E.L.F. Cell was dissolving,
the larger activist community in Eugene was splintering as well.
I think people were self-righteous.
I think people thought they knew they had the answer.
Weren't willing to listen to other points of view... because their view is more radical than that point of view.
All those things came into play, I think, to help narrow the amount of people... that were connected within the movement... to the point where it just went... poof!
Doesn't exist anymore.
That's one really sad thing about... you know, about a lot of social movements, but, you know, I think ours especially, because we all are so critical... of the world and of the way people live in the world... and how they interact with the natural world, that we sometimes are extremely critical on each other.
And that is definitely part of our downfall as... as a movement.
The scene was really imploding there at the time.
And I, um... I took a small trip to
New York for my sister's 35th birthday.
And, um, I hung out with my family, and I was like, "Wow, I really love my family. "
I forgot that I... Like, I just grew so disconnected from them.
And I metJenny.
And I was like, "All right, I think
I'm gonna move back to New York. "
After moving home,
Daniel began working at the Rainforest Foundation.
He organized protests against the Republican Convention,
and finally he took a job at a domestic violence organization,
where he was working when he was arrested.
The E.L.F. Fires in the Northwest had stopped,
but the government continued to work on the case.
We had a war room basically.
It was a situation room.
We worked it and worked it and worked it.
We had diagrams all over the walls, we had our flowcharts, and we had pictures of all our target suspects up there.
What's different on TV that's not realistic... is that everything is solved in 50 minutes, you know?
And that's not what happens here.
Three years after Daniel moved back to New York,
the government had still turned up no viable suspects.
We came together and decided that we would take a cold-case approach... on one arson to see if we can turn any suspects in that particular arson.
And the arson we chose was one that occurred in the city of Eugene, and it was the
Joe Romania Truck Center arson, wherein which 35 S.U.V.'s were burned to the ground.
The new investigation yielded a number of clues,
which pointed the government toward one local activist.
The night of Romania, Jake Ferguson was accused of stealing a truck, which was kind of interesting, you know... the truck would be needed for something like what occurred.
We also knew thatJosephine Overaker... was arrested in the Olympia area... just prior to an arson that occurred up there.
And we knew that her boyfriend was Jacob Ferguson.
And that's when we really turned the heat up.
With Jake now on their radar,
they began following him everywhere,
asking people about him...
and bringing his friends in for questioning before grand juries.
You know, you'd start seeing cars following you, and... cars with guys sitting outside... where you're staying, you know, and...
It was really scary, you know, to think that they were kind of on the right track, you know, and that they're just kind of right there behind you.
And he's also a drug user, and so that adds to paranoia.
"They know," you know.
"They're coming for me. "
And, of course, in Jake's case, some of it was true, where when he did turn around, there were law enforcement following him.
So lightning was striking all around him.
And with that in mind, we gave him an out.
We called him in to the United States Attorney's Office.
We were in a conference room there.
And then we explained to him quite simply... that we knew what his situation was.
They told him they knew he was a heroin addict...
and that he'd lied to an investigator, which was a felony.
And then, they bluffed.
Despite a lack ofhard evidence,
they led him to believe that they could tie him to the E.L.F. Arsons.
We never told Jake Ferguson or his lawyer what we knew or didn't know.
That's... You never do that.
Could we have really put him away for a long time?
At this... that point, probably not.
They told him that the arsons carried a life sentence,
but ifhe became an informant, they'd let him walk away from his crimes.
I described to him, tried to paint an image of him... walking through the forest on a road... some sunny summer afternoon hand-in-hand with his son, instead of looking at his son through bulletproof glass.
And he thought about it.
And at that particular point in time, then... he and his lawyer excused themselves and left and said,
"Well, we'll get back to you in a day or so. "
You know, he grew up with his dad in prison... and he saw how bad that life was.
He didn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison, uh, and have his son, you know, never see his dad.
Twenty minutes later,
I get a call from downstairs, and Mr. Ferguson and his lawyer want to come up and talk to us.
And so they came up and they said,
"We would like to consider cooperation.
What do we need to do?"
So, that was... when we found out that he was willing to cooperate, that was one of the best days I've ever had.
So he started listing off... all the things that he had information about, and that basically was every arson in the district of Oregon, arsons in Washington state, arsons in Wyoming, arsons in Colorado, California.
We did not know the scope, um, of what he had knowledge of.
So that's when the investigation really kind of broke open.
The team immediately grew from 12 or 13, to 40, to 300 agents.
After debriefing Jake about the
14 fires he'd been involved in,
the government had a problem.
They knew that a heroin addict with a pentagram tattoo on his head...
would not make a persuasive witness in court.
And so they needed corroborating evidence.
We talked to him and his lawyer, and we said,
"Okay. This is what we want you to do. We want you to wear a wire. "
They hid a recording device in the liner ofhis baseball cap.
And over the course of a year, they flew him all over the country...
where they arranged for him to accidentally bump into his old friends...
and get them to reminisce about the old days.
He walked into an animal rights conference I was at... in Washington Heights at Holyrood Church.
It was bizarre to see him.
I mean, he was bloated and kind of fat, and just looked really different.
Uh, he was talkative, which was weird,
'cause I always remembered him as a really quiet guy, but he was talkative.
I went to go get a coffee with him.
And we just talked a bunch.
Yeah, it was unfortunate.
I mean, thinking about it,
I... I can't help but be annoyed at myself... for being like, "How did you not know something was really wrong here?"
It feels rather foolish, you know, to have done that, but I'm trying to get over the shame... associated with making dumb mistakes.
Jake was extremely conflicted.
We'd have to pump him up.
It was like before a big fight... where we sat there with him for probably half an hour to an hour... just to get him kind of tuned up... and ready to, uh, do it.
It wasn't something
I felt good about, you know, getting people to confess by wearing a wire, you know.
But what can you do when you've already taken the deal, and then you've admitted to doing all these felonies?
They've got you, you know. If you do anything to disagree with the deal, the deal's off, and you've just confessed... to, like, you know, life in prison.
So once we had those recordings in place, we decided on a particular takedown date.
The takedown presented an enormous logistical challenge.
The government believed that the suspects had to be arrested...
at exactly the same moment, or word would get out and they would go into hiding.
So teams of federal agents fanned out across the country.
I went to New York, and we stayed out on
Daniel McGowan's house until...
God, I think it was 10:00 or 11:00... making sure that he was gonna be there first thing in the morning.
And then we got... Yeah, it was not very good sleep.
The next morning,
Detective Harvey and three federal agents followed Daniel to work.
I look up, and around the corner comes these kind of big dudes.
I just kept feeling wave after wave of dread and fear, just kept, you know...
And I was like... I could barely talk. I completely lost my voice.
Like, I was just... I could barely move, you know. It was really horrible.
And they were like, "You're being extradited to Oregon for, you know, E.L.F. Charges.
You should consider pleading.
Don't ruin your family. "
Like all this stuff.
We would have them have an attorney.
We would present the evidence that we have against them and say,
"Here's your opportunity to become a cooperator, or remain a defendant. Your choice. "
You know, when you... when you sit down with them... and you show them and let them listen to themselves on tape, uh, you can see them really sink.
"Uh, okay, I'm done. "
It was a very successful approach because, you know, the dominoes began to fall.
I was in bed.
My, uh, husband was up for work.
It was, uh, 5:00 in the morning.
He gets up early for work.
And he came into the bedroom and told me that the F.B. I... and the Oregon State Police were there to talk to me.
And right away I pretty much knew what they were there to talk to me about.
From there it was just, um, you know, the hardest decision
I ever made in my life... whether or not I should take a plea bargain and cooperate, or risk going to prison for the rest of my life.
And I think that probably will be the hardest decision I've ever made in my life.
And, um, I chose to... to cooperate and take the plea bargain... so that I could someday, once again, you know, be with my loved ones.
I would have been fully prepared to have gone away for five to 10 years, you know.
I was really looking at dying alone in prison... and knowing that every single loved one would have moved on... and done something else in their life.
It felt like a death sentence, you know, more than a life sentence.
People can judge me for the decisions I've made.
But until you've been in that position it's, you know... it's really hard to know what you would do.
I never in my life thought I would be cooperating with the F.B.I.
I always thought that I would be able to stay strong... and stay true to my values and my beliefs.
And, you know, I guess sometimes you aren't as strong as you think.
So, um, I don't know if you're on, but can we talk off camera for a sec?
Daniel's lawyers have negotiated a plea bargain.
While most of his codefendants have agreed to testify against each other,
Daniel and three others have held out for different terms.
They'll have to take responsibility for the arsons,
but will not be forced to give information about others, if they accept the deal.
Wow. You are a big girl.
Happy birthday. Right.
Everything has this overshadowing,
"This is the last of holidays. "
"This is the last birthday party. "
"This is the last everything. "
It's funny. He's not really a big materialistic person, but he bought her a lot of gifts this year.
I said to him, "You didn't have to go through all this trouble. "
And he said, "This might be the last time I can really ever give her gifts and be here. "
So that was kind of sad.
I don't know. He's got some serious decisions to make.
And they suck. No matter what you choose, they suck.
Wow!
I just feel bad that, uh, this came up in this part of his life.
I'm hoping for him to make an agreement, because going to trial, I think...
I think with the charges against him, that's two life sentences.
I don't believe in his philosophies, but, uh, he's my son and I... and I love him.
Come here, Lily.
Mmm.
So, cool. L... Thanks for everyone for coming.
Or you want to pace behind?
He wants to pace behind us.
Um, I just wanted everyone to come so I can tell you guys...
I made my final decision on, uh, the plea bargain the government offered a few weeks ago.
And so, um,
I'm gonna be... agreeing to this plea bargain in court on the 9th.
So...
The recommended sentence on the part of the government is eight years.
I won't be taken into custody at sentencing.
I'm gonna... I qualify for a self-report.
But it's a major, major important thing to them... to say that... that our crime fit the federal crime of terrorism.
Even though Daniel has now accepted a plea bargain,
a hurdle still remains.
A federal judge must determine whether the fires...
qualify for something called the terrorism enhancement.
If the judge rules that
Daniel's fires were terrorism,
Daniel could be sent to a new, ultra-restrictive prison.
It was set up after 9/11 to house terrorists.
In the media and in the courtroom, the question is debated.
Ecoterrorism: Terrorist acts by radical groups...
- Ecoterrorist.
- Ecoterrorism.
Environmental terrorists.
People need to question, like, this buzz word and how it's being used, and how it's, like, just become the new "Communist. "
It's become the new, you know...
It's like the bogeyman.
It's a bogeyman word.
It's like whoever I really disagree with is a terrorist.
Some people have a problem with, you know, calling this terrorism, but when you're basically making the threat where people go home at night... wondering if they're gonna be a target, um, that's what terrorism is.
After the fire, for... for a long time, you really looked over your shoulder.
We put a new alarm system in our home and things like that... that, uh, before we hadn't thought about.
You know, being a New Yorker, with experiencing such serious terrorism firsthand...
is like, "How are you gonna call someone who sets fire to an empty building... a terrorist?"
It's just inappropriate in every way, and it's an insult.
The word "terrorism" to me is about killing humans.
It's about ending innocent life.
And that is the antitheses of what these people did.
Concern for life was a very big part of the plan... and implementation of these actions, and is why no one was ever harmed or injured in them.
1,200 incidents are being accredited to the E.L.F. And A.L.F. In this country, and not a single injury or death.
Those statistics don't happen by accident.
Terrorist acts, under the definition of the law, can vary all over the board.
There is no requirement for purposes of terrorism... that you physically endanger another person's life.
I mean, you don't have to be Bonnie and Clyde to be a bank robber, and you don't have to be
Al-Qaeda to be a terrorist.
I don't think these people are terrorists.
I think, uh, the people and the agencies... and the industry that they're fighting are the true terrorists.
When you got big timber companies... coming into the Northwest, clear-cutting old-growth forests, big oil companies with their big oil spills... that, uh, cost billions and billions and billions of dollars.
You don't see the F.B.I. Raiding these executives' homes or anything like that.
They aren't being threatened with life in prison.
All they really do is just pay a fine and, uh, move on to the next quarter.
Th-The old adage that, you know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter is true.
You know, if you agree with their motives...
Wow, they're a hero.
They're not a terrorist at all.
If you disagree with their motives, then they're a terrorist.
That's tough. Okay.
That's why it's a whole lot cleaner to deal with crimes.
Crimes, noncrime.
Okay, I'm good with that.
I can do that. Arson?
Arson is a crime.
Good. I can do that.
You know, is it terrorism?
We'll find out.
I ordered a book about doing time in federal prison written by a lawyer who did time.
I'm very, you know... Getting very prepared for the whole idea.
But that doesn't necessarily make it any easier, you know? I know.
You know you're not alone even though you're in there by yourself.
I know.
Just, I don't know. It sucks.
Sometimes it's hard not to just look at the whole situation and go like,
"What the fuck? How did this all happen?" You know?
I don't know.
The situation with the environment is not getting better. It's getting worse.
And I'm not suggesting that the path of destruction... and destroying everything is the right path.
But I didn't know what to do.
It's like screaming at the top of your lungs and no one hears you.
Like, what the hell are you supposed to say, you know?
What are you supposed to do?
Yes!
Going to the courthouse?
Yeah.
The judge has sentenced Mr.
McGowan to 84 months in prison.
That's seven years.
The court also imposed a terrorism enhancement.
He has been branded as a terrorist in the media.
He will be listed as a successful government terror prosecution... for the rest of his life, and we are very disappointed.
We believe it's legally wrong, and factually wrong.
Oh, look at the trailhead right there.
Oh, my God.
It fell from there.
The older I get, um, the more circumspect I become.
And, uh, I know now that a world is not black and white.
Um, it's not that simple.
When you f... When I first read about these arsons... and became, uh, involved in the investigation of the arsons, you see all the damage and the harm that they've done.
And the threats they made...
They're not very likable people at all.
Once you get to know them as a human being, you... you start looking at their motivations 'cause you're curious about it.
Why did they do such a horrible thing?
And you look at their background, and you look at their childhood, and you look at how they've evolved from the days... when they committed all these crimes.
And then, instead of just being... a cold mug shot on a piece of paper, they become human beings.
And so you begin to understand them.
And that's not that you're saying you approve of their conduct or their behavior.
But you gain an understanding, an insight, as to how it came to pass... that they started doing these things.
And then you're curious about how their lives will end up, but only time will tell.
My stomach is flipping out!
Want me to open it?
No, I got it.
You sure? Okay. I gotta be independent.
You're not gonna be there to advise me on stuff.
I'm in your corner.
I know. Thanks, Pop.
I'll see you.
Thanks for everything.
I'll see you later.
I love you.
I love you too.

Previously on Smallville...
There are aliens among us.
If you don't stand with us, you stand against us it's time for you to pick a side.
There's only one way to leave Checkmate.
I finished tracing the nber of our rogue blur.
It was Zod.
You lied about having powers.
How'd you get them?
From your blood.
Your father left the book of Rau on this Earth.
And what with all of this, there is no limit to what we can achieve.
Don't act like there isn't some agenda you're not telling me about.
If it wasn't for Zod,
I wouldn't be alive today.
Let's just say I know him better than you think.
A group of your people are looking to a new leader --
Clark.
The time has come to share in your birthright.
I know what I have to do.
Hey.
Don't tell me you forgot about your favorite customer.
I thought you forgot about me.
You're late.
I'll have the usual, please?
All I got left is strong and burnt.
As long as it's hot.
You know, I've been meaning to ask -- what kind of a job has a pretty young lady working all night, every night?
Actually, I work for a nonprofit organization.
We help people in need.
Trying to save the world, huh?
All night, every night.

Welcome to Watchtower,
ms. Sullivan.
Ready to save the world from itself?
How did you find out my sceret?
Oliver's voice wavered when I told him that
Watchtower had been kidnapped.
And I've seen the way he looks at you.
It's the little things a girl tends to notice.
And yet you somehow missed an unloaded gun.
Watchtower safety compromised.
Initiating lockdown.
It's in your best interest to get these doors open now.
Access denied.
We're not going anywhere.
Watchtower's in control now.

I let myself in.
Terrific.
You, uh, hop up to the helipad or just superspeed past security, Clark?
I used the elevator.
How human of you.
You're obviously not on patrol tonight.
What's going on?
I need to find Zod.
You know, Chloe -- she's got this really big building filled with a lot of expensive stuff
I paid a lot of money for.
She could probably help you out with that.
The last thing that we need is to have a weapon like Watchtower fall into the wrong hands.
I want to keep Chloe out of the line of fire.
I figured you'd agree with that.
"Keep Chloe out of the line of fire."
What the hell's going on?
Zod.
He went after Lois.
He pretended to be The Blur, and he put her in danger.
I think it's time we take off the gloves.
I need you on this, but I can't have you starting a fight with Zod if I'm trying to keep the peace.
Clark, I know you like to see the goodness in everyone, but you know what this guy's capable of, right?
And I know what you're capable of.
I understand how you feel.
Don't think I'm not angry, too.
But I can't have you firing off the first shot and threatening everything
I've worked for.
These are my people that we're talking about.
My first real chance to have a kryptonian family here on Earth.
And we need to find Zod and confront him my way.
Yeah, all right, man,
I got your back.
Let's suit up.
Check the mansion.
Before Tess went off the grid, she got close to Zod.
She may have left behind some intel.
I have another lead I want to run down on my own.
Hey, Clark.
You know, those Kandorians... they're not the only family you have here.
In the event that I die of starvation or, oh, say a ricocheting bullet, do you mind telling me how you got in here?
You're sloppy, Chloe.
I've got thousands of samples of your DNA from all the times you've spied on me.
It's called a DNA cloak.
Well, aren't you fancy?
You know, getting in doesn't really seem to be our issue right now.
How the hell do we get out of here?
Short answer -- it's impossible.
When Checkmate kidnapped me,
I upgraded Watchtower's security to contain intruders like you.
The only problem is,
I was supposed to be on the outside.
Seriously?
The lockdown prevents any signals from getting in or out.
Treat confirmation still active.
Wait a minute.
Watchtower didn't react because you attacked me.
We're on lockdown because some hacking transmitter was detected.
The initial signal managed to pirate some data before my firewall blocked it, and the thing is still alive.
It's trying to break through another firewall, Tess.
It's trying to give away our location.
What did you bring in here?!
Nothing.
All I wanted to do was erase any info you had on the Kandorians, not reroute it.
I knew you were the
Kandorians' lapdog, but I didn't realize you were Zod's little bitch, too.
All right, look.
If you're not behind this, there's only one other group I can think of that wants Watchtower this badly.
The signal's scrambled,
Agent Campbell.
Watchtower threw up some kind of halo of interference as soon as the tracker went live.
Waller coming online.
We're trying to sort out
the data we siphoned
What is your status?
We've narrowed the location within a 20-block radius.
Good.
We can't afford to make a mistake
with the red queen so close.
Don't make me regret
putting my little white knight
back in play.
There's no need to worry.
We're gonna have Watchtower in Checkmate's hands by dawn.
Godspeed, Agent Campbell.
Waller out.
You heard the wall, gentlemen.
Let's show Mercer how we feel about a little thing called treason.
Okay, if I was hiding a transmitting tracking device,
I would want to make it as unassuming as possible.
Which means I can probably count this out.
Fever-colored lipstick? Really?
Well, I was gonna go with plain Jane, but you seem to have that market cornered.
Really, how much could have been leaked in the blink of an eye?
Watchtower downloads what amounts to the
Library of Congress every three seconds, which mean half that time,
Checkmate could have attained my entire team's database.
And all of your files on the Kandorians.
Firewall breach.
Cluster 445a.
Now, if it wasn't planted in your things, it must be on you.
What?
Chloe, this is ridiculous, okay?
It's in your body, Tess, just beneath your skin.
Get it out of me -- now.
Oh, my God.
It moved.
When it feels threatened, it burrows deeper into the host.
We'll never get it out now.
How did you know that?
It's a Checkmate device -- a mechanical parasite powered by the host's biorhythms.
Well, you know what they say.
You lie down with dogs, you end up with fleas.
Laugh it up, Chloe, but when Checkmate finds us, we'll both be dead.
I'm glad you found a way to preserve our culture here on earth.
I wish everyone saw it that way.
Zod disappeared and took the rest of our people with him.
I don't understand.
I thought all of you had found a new life here on Earth.
We were wrong to follow you, Kal-El.
When we did what you asked and tried to assimilate with the humans, we were left behind.
We're gathered here waiting for Zod's return to ask his forgiveness.
I'm sorry, Faora.
I never meant to divide our people, but you cannot realign with Zod.
You've never trusted him, Kal-El.
All Zod wanted was to give us power so we could protect ourselves.
Zod already has powers.
He's had them for weeks.
Faora, there's something you need to see.
You are unmistakably the one they call Green Arrow...
A rebel with many causes.
I'm glad to know my reputation still precedes me.
You must be Zod...
Soldier with no army.
Hmm.
I see my reputation precedes me, too.
I'm guessing by the looks of him, we're not the only ones waiting for Tess.
Oh, yeah, "him."
I find it disgusting how quickly you humans can betray your own.
Now, that one -- he ave up all sorts of useful information, before he died, about something your government called Checkmate... and about who they're after.
Well, not too long ago, a gift-wrapped me was at the top of that wish list.
And now Tess is.
Checkmate is using her to get to us, hunting us to the death.
Having been on the receiving end of their terrorist schemes... why don't you join me against our common enemy?
Well, I'm flattered, but if I let you go after Checkmate, you'll start world war III.
It's not an option.
Your conviction is admirable.
But you can't possibly think you're faster than me.
I've always been taught to favor accuracy over speed.
Bull's-eye.
Air supply terminated.
We got three minutes of air left.
You think Checkmate will find us before then?
Asphyxiation or a firing squad.
Damned if we do, damned if we don't.
Just damned.
I just wanted to save the world.
That's funny.
Last time I checked, you were just trying to get rid of everyone in it.
Paint my ideals however you want, but you and yours don't trust people any more than I do.
This entire building was programmed to prevent anyone from getting close to you.
Yeah, I guess I lost my faith in people a long time ago, too.
That's why you won't let
Oliver get close to you.
And why I can't blame him when he eventually leaves.
He's not gonna leave you.
With you, he has a purpose
I wish I could have given him that.
And it kills me...
...'cause you have everything right in front of you... and you can't even see it.
Final breach imminent.
They broke through the final firewall.
Checkmate's gonna be here any minute.
As long as they torture us with the A.C. on,
I'll die happy.
Cold.
Okay, Watchtower's cooling system uses a special mix of liquid helium and nitrogen.
Cold enough to shatter steel.
What are you waiting for?
If I pull these tanks, then the mainframe melts.
All my work, Watchtower is gone.
If you don't, we die.
Critical oxygen level.
Warning -- temperature variation detected.
System failure imminent.
They're back on the grid.
Safeties off, gentlemen.
Shoot to kill.
Zod.
He destroyed Krypton.
My father sent those messages here to Earth to help me stop history from repeating itself.
I trusted Zod, too.
That's why I didn't tell you any of this sooner.
Look, the circumstances may be different, but Zod cannot be trusted.
On Krypton, he destroyed that planet to prove a point.
We can't let hm do the same thing here.
I'd hoped what Zod had given me would reunite our people.
What he gave you?
At the ceremony, your sister was protecting you.
You're pregnant.
And Zod's the father?
This baby is proof that you can still have a life here...
Apart from Zod, without powers.
Faora...
Krypton lives on through you.
Why don't you just murder me now?
Isn't that what your race does?
Sometimes.
And I would love to, believe me.
But, although inconvenient and a lot less fun -- ow! --
I made a commitment to Clark to help save the world peacefully.
Now, that said, you bulldoze me again,
I might have a change of heart.
Zod's been looking for something ever since we arrived.
The book of Rau.
Zod said the book of Rau was some sort of kryptonian bible.
It's so much more than that.
It wields great power.
And if Zod were to get his hands on it... then who knows what he would do?
Oliver, what's wrong?
I found what we're looking for.
I'll give you a little hint -- it's bigger than a breadbox. Zod?
I'll be right there.
Why don't you take your sweet time?
Because I have everything under...
... control.
Oliver?
Oliver?!
No.
Zod.
Change of plans, agent Campbell.
Change of plans?
We just made contact with Mercer's tracker.
I don't care about Mercer
or Watchtower.
We decrypted the data.
We found the aliens.
Checkmate is going to stop this war
before it gets started.
Waller out.
We've got our 20.
Now lock her down.
I'm not losing her.
Sir, you heard Waller.
We have our orders.
I just spent the last five months in recovery from what Mercer did to me.
Now, this op is over when I say it's over, understood?
I don't get it.
You're in the clear.
We escape before
Checkmate got a hit on Watchtower's address.
That doesn't make you any less of a liability, Tess.
You still know the secret identities of all my most valuable players.
There's no sense in both of us getting captured.
I'm not letting you out of my sight until we get rid of your little friend.
I know how much I am asking of you in standing against Zod.
I will not let my child be raised under a tyrant's rule.
We cannot let our future be guided by a tyrant's hand.
Our past ended in war.
Let our future begin with peace.
Aah!
Enough!
You heard her.
Enough's enough.
The leader comes with me.
We have a few things to discuss.
Dispose of the rest.
I'll have Dr.
Hamilton check in with you once we get him into surgery and assess the damage.
Clark...
Checkmate's after the Kandorians.
Only you can save your people.
Please.
Our people have done nothing.
Where are you taking us?
Vala, where's your sister?
They took her.
Atropine?
What the hell are you gonna do with that?
There's no time. Look.
If you're right and that transmitter's powered by your biorhythms, then the only way that I can turn it off is to stop your heart.
I have to kill you, Tess.
And this is the only way
I'm gonna bring you back.
You're asking for a pretty big leap of faith here.
You're gonna have to trust me.
You ready?
Do it.
The signal just went dead.
Let's move.
Keep looking.
You bitch.
Whoa.
I really --
I really didn't think you'd do it -- bring me back.
Neither dd I.
Just for the record,
I just saved your ass.
You say anything about me or mine to anyone, next time you won't wake up.
You understand?
Guess you'll have to trust me.
Our field offices were just leveled by the one you call Zod.
We knew nothing about this.
Zod is acting alone.
We stand part. We only want peace.
Dozens of my agents are dead.
We are way past peace.
Then we will help you stop him.
Defecting means betraying your own kind.
I'm only betraying one.
Checkmate's actions demands justice.
Murder isn't justice.
Seems like a lifetime ago when I... pulled you out of that rubble, doesn't it.
The Siege of Argo.
There were many losses that day.
Not for me.
Because I found a young and... beautiful cadet who would become my trusted right hand.
Oh, you were so brave in the face of death
I knew then that you would be a true partner.
I've trusted you... for so very long.
Depended on you...
... across time and space.
But in your eyes,
I just see contempt.
I see betrayal.
Now, why would you turn your back on me?
I shared my bed with you.
I didn't turn my back on you.
You turned your back on us when our only crime was trying to forge a life for ourselves on this planet.
If I ever learned... that insurrection had spread across my ranks, if I ever discovered that my men had aligned themselves against me,
I would raze this planet.
I would burn it to the ground till the last ember went cold beneath my boot!
Now only i will lead us to the next age.
All will follow Zod.
You already sacrificed one world for your ego.
You know nothing of sacrifice.
I know more than you know.
Kneel.
Never.
I think I found a way to prioritize our satellites to get a location on Mercer when she left the hospital.
Zod destroyed the
Metropolis field office, and six more went dark.
The black king is still missing, and we're at war.
Contact the U.N.
We have to regroup before they strike again.
Run.
Please tell me you found that z-branding bastard so we can slap him back across the universe.
Zod's on the move, and there's no sign of
Faora or the Kandorians.
Maybe if I can reach the others,
I can talk some sense into them.
We may be too late for that.
That's the Castle.
Oh, God.
Zod's attacked Checkmate.
Oliver was personal.
With this, Zod just declared war.
You're not gonna like where he's gathering his troops.
My eye in the sky above the fortress is picking up movement.
What was to be the first son of Kandor is no more.
Now we, the last sons and daughters of Krypton, have no choice but to preserve our birthright.
The humans killed the mother of my unborn child...
... the mother of your future!
That's a lie.
The last time that I saw Faora, she was alive.
And she was alone... with Zod.
Why should they believe you?
This traitor... saved the life of the woman who held you hostage, the woman who wanted to dissect you, who wanted to torture you... murder you.
Vala...
If there's anyone who really knows what your sister wanted, it's you.
It was peace, Vala.
She wanted peace.
No.
Zod's right.
The humans will never allow Kandor peace.
They will hunt us to the last man.
But they will fail, for we shall never be defeated.
We will follow general Zod to the ends of this earth.
Krypton will rise again.
And all humankind will kneel before Zod.
I'll never let that happen!
You won't be able to stop us.

<b>THE CONSPIRATOR</b>
Two men standing at the Pearly Gates.
The first man says, "How'd you die?"
Second says, "I froze to death.
How 'bout you?"
And the, uh, second man says,
"Well, I thought my--my wife was being unfaithful to me,
- so I ran all the way home."
- Come on.
"And burst into the bedroom."
There's nothin' here.
- "She just..."
- Look over there.
Yes, sir.
Make sure there's men on--
Here!
We're here!
You take him first.
But, captain, he's as good as--
That's an order.
Sergeant.
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!
Watch his leg.
Hip, hip... Hurrah!
Hip, hip... Hurrah!
Hip, hip... Hurrah! victory!
Getting a little ahead of ourselves, don't you think?
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant, so have a drink.
- Freddie, have you seen him yet?
- A dozen rebel armies still in the field.
I'd say peace is far from in hand.
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.
No, I haven't, but half his cabinet's here.
There's Interior... and Postmaster.
Treasury.
Secretary of Navy.
Where's War?
Coh, there he is.
God, what I would give to meet him.
What? Wait. Where are you going?
You coming or not?
Are you--Are you mad?
You can't approach Edwin Stanton without an introduction.
Really?
Frederick Aiken.
I've been to Creation and back lookin' for you.
Senator. Uh, Baker, Hamilton, allow me to introduce the distinguished senator from Maryland,
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.
- Great honor, senator.
Gentlemen, you've done this nation proud.
Thank you, sir.
Ladies. Ladies, may I present two genuine war heroes.
Now you all get acquainted while I introduce the counselor to some of my, uh, esteemed associates.
- Ladies.
- Hello. lt's, uh, quite a turnout.
- Hello.
- It's an honor to meet the lovely... victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.
Life's full of them, Reverdy.
This is our War secretary,
Mr. Edwin Stanton.
Yeah. It's a--it's a very great pleasure, sir.
Mr. Aiken had two horses shot from under him and never quit the field.
Could use a loyal man like you over at the War Department, Captain.
Sir.
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.
Time to heal the nation, Ed, not wage more war.
Pleasure as always, Senator.
- Captain.
- Sir.
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet the president this evening.
Will he not be attending?
It seems Mrs. Lincoln prefers an evening of theater to a room full of soldiers.
Anything. I can play anything.
Poor Blind Boy?
I don't know that one. Uh, anything--
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.
Sarah--oh, my God. You look beautiful.
Sarah, glad to see you.
Fred didn't mention you'd be joining us this evening.
- That sounds like Fred.
- What sounds like Fred?
Nothing you need to worry about.
How many bottles is that now, Nick?
Uh, nothing you need to worry about, Fred.
Shall we take a stroll?
It's good to have you boys back.
It's good to be back.
It's very good to be back.
Oh, quite right.
Some gals and their mothers would look...
Mr, vice President.
Yes, Senator?
I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I need your authorization on this.
Is it really necessary right now?
I have so many guests.
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.
You have to keep the sun out of your eyes, look straight, pull strong, calculate the distance, and you'll hit the mark every time.
- What?
- Not sure.
Sir?
Yes, I have a package for Secretary Seward.
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard, and you needn't be afraid of us. l ain't afraid of you, both of you together.
Want another?
Sir?
Secretary Stanton is a smart man.
The War Department would be lucky to have you.
It was an honor to meet the man, but...
I'm eager to put the war behind me.
You do look awfully handsome in your uniform.
I suppose I'm going to have to get used to you in civilian clothing again.
So you did miss me?
On occasion.
Now I've no fortune, but I am filled over with affection that I am ready to pour over you like apple sass over roasted pork.
Mr. Trenchard!
You are addressing my daughter, and in my presence!
Yes! I'm offering her my heart and my hand just as she wants them, with nothing in 'em.
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard, that you are not used to the manner of polite--
Pardon me. I'm sor--
Oh.
Shit.
- Oh, no!
- Hold it!
Stop! No!
No, please! Don't!
Ohh! Unh!
Help!
Somebody help!
Help!
...to which you have fallen guilty.
Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap--
Ohh!
Sic semper tyrannis!
The South is avenged!
He's getting away!
Stop him!
Come on.
Come on.
Come here, you son of a bitch!
Can't get--let you out of here!
What is it?
- Major?
- What's happened?
Lincoln's been shot.
- What?
- He's been shot.
You stay here.
Open the door.
Sergeant.
Stand aside.
Over there.
Across the street.
Make way!
Please, stand aside.
Please.
Move back! Please!
- Coming through.
- Olear the way!
Back! Stand aside!
Can you see anything?
Open the door!
Open the door!
Try the other door.
Find another way!
Stand aside.
Over here!
Over here!
Come on inside!
Back here. Back here.
Set him down easy.
Where's the doctor?
Get some towels.
Mr. Secretary, wait, sir.
No. I want to see him.
Make way!
Out of my way!
Move aside!
Out! Move!
- Where is he?
- He's down there, sir.
There, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.
Take his pulse.
Mr. Secretary, it was the actor,
John Wilkes Booth.
Are you certain?
They've performed with him many times.
They're positive.
We haven't done anything wrong.
It's gonna be all right.
Well, one man did not orchestrate all of this on his own.
Where's Grant?
He's on a train to Philadelphia.
Bring him to me.
I want the commander of the Union army here.
- Move.
- Yes, sir.
Put the forts on alert, all guns manned.
And find out which members of the Cabinet are still unaccounted for.
Sir, we should move to the
War Department to facilitate operations.
- I'm not leaving him.
- Yes, sir.
Damn the rebels.
Damn them all to hell.
Mr. Secretary, sir.
Several names have come up, sir, including an intimate of Booth's, a John Surratt.
What is known of him?
21 years old, lives here.
His mother runs a boarding house in town.
Find him.
I want the city closed.
If any of these assassins get south of the Potomac or up into Canada, they will never be found.
Right away, sir.
Also the vice president wishes to pay his respects.
When I say it is safe for him to do so.
And keep him away from the liquor.
Yes, sir.
Take that woman out, and do not let her in again.
Let's go.
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
Move it!
Get up, you!
No!
Booth.
That's for the judge to decide.
Sir.
Well, nice of you to show, Mr. Aiken.
I'm sorry for being late, Senator.
You aware the trial of the conspirators begins today?
Yes, sir. There's not a seat to be had.
Well, now you have one.
How's that, sir?
I've taken one of the cases, and I want you to be my second chair.
I thought the government was planning a military tribunal.
Oh, indeed. Stanton has chosen nine of his most loyal officers to be judges, all for Union.
In fact, he's picked one of Lincoln's pallbearers to head the Commission.
Uh, let's go.
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I might be being a little slow, but won't the War Department be handling the prosecution?
Stanton's most trusted judge advocate general,
Joseph Holt, will be in charge.
Then what are we to do?
Defend one of the eight.
Defend one of the assassins?
Alleged assassins, counselor.
I had a letter from the lady this morning.
She runs a boarding house, a Mrs. Mary--
Surratt?
Yes, that's it.
Sir, her son John was Booth's right hand.
Well, if they suspect her son, they should try him.
They would if they could find him, but they've got 250 agents out looking for him.
She built the nest that hatched this plot.
President Johnson said it himself.
Well, I know this goes hard with you, Freddie, but--but what they're plannin', which is a military trial of civilians, is an atrocity.
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.
There's no presumption of innocence, no burden of proof, no jury of your peers and no appeal.
All right, you were one of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.
How can you represent her?
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie, so I shall defend her.
Mary E. Surratt, in aid of the existing armed rebellion against the United States, you are charged with having received, entertained, harbored, concealed, aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,
John A. Surratt and their confederates--
David E. Herold...
Lewis Payne...
George A. Atzerodt...
Michael O'Laughlen...
Edmund Spangler...
Samuel A. Mudd... and Samuel Arnold-- in traitorous and murderous conspiracy to kill then-President Abraham Lincoln, vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward.
Pursuant to special orders number 211 and 216, how do you plead?
What say you, madam?
Guilty or not?
I am innocent.
In that case, as each of the defendants has entered a not-guilty plea, we will begin.
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.
Just a moment, Your Honor.
What is it, Senator? l--I wish to request an adjournment.
An adjournment? We just got here.
My client has been in custody for a month, wasn't allowed to contact counsel until yesterday.
General Hunter, a delay will only serve to prolong the nation's sorrow.
My learned colleague, you've had over four weeks to prepare your case, no doubt assisted by the entire War Department.
I believe the defendant is entitled to equal consideration.
Senator Johnson, our fellow citizens must be permitted to put this tragedy to rest.
The sooner we dispose of this matter, the better--for everyone.
Everyone but my client.
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.
In that case, I move for termination.
Termination?
On the grounds this trial is unconstitutional.
The defendant is a civilian entitled to a public trial before a jury of her peers.
The attorney general has affirmed the legitimacy of this proceeding.
Has he furnished a verdict as well?
Senator.
You will mind the horror which summons us.
Indeed.
We all mourn the loss of our leader, but in our grief, let us not betray our betterjudgment and partake in an inquisition.
Inquisition? How dare you?
Sounds to me like we have the enemy among us.
Maryland not being among our most loyal of states during the war, its senator ought to certify his allegiance to this court.
I have served this nation as its attorney general.
That is certification enough.
Nevertheless, we may require counsel to sign this oath of loyalty as prescribed by Congress.
I am a member of Congress, the same body that creates armies, authorizes military tribunals and makes major generals like you.
Our authorization comes from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton, and by order of the president.
If our founding fathers had desired tyranny to prevail, the president and his War secretary would have been granted such indiscriminate powers, but they drafted a Constitution with laws against such powers.
They did so precisely for times like this.
Order! Order! Order!
I really want you to do this for me, Freddie.
You're not serious.
As serious as the charges against our client.
Me? Defend her?
She doesn't stand a chance with an old Southerner like me defending her.
She needs a Yankee captain like you.
I'm sorry, sir, I--I can't do it.
No, you'll do fine, son.
Experience matters for nothing when they're making up the rules as they go along.
Besides, this government has never executed a woman.
They've never considered a woman, nor a man for that matter, capable of murdering the president.
Sir, I can find you a rebel to defend her, but I ca--I won't do it.
There is no court in the Union that would fairly judge that woman with a Confederate counsel.
I won't betray my country.
I won't betray my friends who died defending it.
I'm not asking you to betray your allegiances, Freddie.
I'm simply askin' you-- rather tellin' you-- to obey your oath as a--as an attorney and do yourjob.
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.
What?
- What?
- Yeah.
He can't be serious.
They're the actors from the theater.
Open up.
Thank you, soldier.
That'll be all.
This conversation is privileged.
Sorry, sir. Orders.
Where is Senator Johnson?
The senator has instructed me to handle your case.
You understand what you've been charged with?
Conspiring to murder the president, secretary of State and the vice president... if found guilty, you could hang?
No disrespect, Mr...
Aiken.
Mr. Aiken.
How many years have you?
So you've handled cases like this before?
There's never been a case like this before.
But you have defended others.
They've left nothing to chance. very well.
You own a boarding house on 541 H Street?
Is that correct?
Yes.
How long you been there?
Ma'am?
All I know about you is what I read in the papers.
It's not flattering.
I moved to Washington a year ago with my son and daughter after my husband passed.
And the assassins were frequent visitors to your home.
Yes.
Well, you--heh.
You don't even deny having been acquainted with John Wilkes Booth and the others behind bars?
No, sir, I do not.
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken, and left me loads of debt.
I had to support my family, so I rented rooms to boarders.
Those men were customers, nothing more.
And you never considered their allegiances?
I didn't ask about their allegiances.
What about yours, ma'am?
I am a Southerner.
I'm a Catholic and a devoted mother above all else... but I am no assassin.
Your freedom is gonna require greater assurances than that.
Then you tell me what I should say to those generals.
Oh, you can't say a thing.
You're prohibited from testifying in your own defense.
Perhaps your son could speak for you.
Any idea where he's hiding?
No, I don't.
All right. Is there anyone who will give your version of events?
You mean the truth?
Well, obviously the government believes your version is not the truth.
Based on what?
They're not releasing their list of witnesses or the evidence they'll use against you.
And can they do that?
This kind of proceeding, they can do to you whatever they want.
Well, then what difference does it make?
Those generals have made up their minds.
I can tell by the way they look at me.
The way they look at you?
Just the same way you're looking at me.
I have to go.
Good day.
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word from my daughter since I've been here.
Would you look in on her for me?
I'd be most grateful.
Thank you.
Soldier.
Frederick Aiken, lawyer to Mary Surratt.
It's perfect.
Pardon?
Anna Surratt?
My name is Frederick Aiken.
I'm representing your mother.
What's perfect?
Uh, nothing.
No, do tell.
I'm sure I've heard much worse.
Well, I was just thinking that this would be the perfect place to conspire to overthrow the government.
No one would ever suspect.
Right?
You alone here?
Yes.
Why? Are you afraid to be seen with me?
Your mother asked that I look in on you.
Please tell her not to worry, since I'm a prisoner in my own house.
Where's your brother's room?
Second floor, on the left.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Uh, yes.
Did your brother share a room with an L.J.W.?
Louis J. Weichmann.
He was like a son to my mother.
He'll swear she's innocent.
I suppose he's disappeared, too.
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?
Kill any on our side?
Miss, do you have any documents indicating who stayed here or a ledger of accounts?
Do you want me to help your mother or not?
Is there anything else you're concealing?
Such as?
Your brother, to start.
Look, if you know--
Did you see who threw that?
No, sir.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further need of me...
Here. I'll give you two to sell.
You have the latest on this one?
That, I'll take two.
Cigars! Jars!
Picture frames!
Original, right here, ma'am.
Who wants a cigar?
Fresh roasted nuts here.
Fresh roasted nuts.
Move along. Mustn't keep it blocked.
Thank you very much.
Left.
Left, right, left.
- Cigars!
- Left...
Cigars!
Left. Left. Left.
Left, right, left.
Left...
Company, arms rest.
- March.
- Shoulder arms.
Quick step.
Left.
Left, right, left.
A chance to get it back?
There he is.
- Fred.
- Hey.
Hamilton here has offered to be your second chair.
Oh. Re--Not a chance in hell.
- No? You sure?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll carry his briefcase, but I'm not--
- Sarah.
- Fred.
Why are you here?
I'm trying to understand why you're here.
I suppose I should wish you luck.
Come to order.
How is Anna, Mr. Aiken?
She's fine... looking forward to when you come home.
That's very nice of you to say, Mr. Aiken.
Judge Advocate Holt, will you please proceed?
In the matter of Mary Surratt, the prosecution calls as its first witness Mr. Louis Weichmann.
I thought he was like family.
Why are they calling him?
Place your right hand on this Bible.
I don't know.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
I do.
Please.
Are you acquainted with the defendant,
Mary Surratt?
Yes. Yes, I am.
I attended Divinity College with her son John.
And until recently, you resided at the boarding house owned by Mary Surratt. Is that correct?
That is correct, sir.
Were any of these men ever present in her home?
Yes, sir.
These three over there on several occasions.
Let the record reflect that the witness has identified the prisoners Herold,
Payne and Atzerodt.
And who invited these men?
John Surratt.
Objection.
Objection?
Uh, uh...
There's no way to prove that John Surratt even knew these men, let alone invited them.
Mr. Surratt's absence from this proceeding is Mr. Surratt's problem.
Objection overruled. Continue, Mr. Holt.
Was John Wilkes Booth also a frequent guest of John Surratt?
Indeed, but all the Surratts adored him--
John, his sister Anna and their mother, too.
And were there ever meetings held at the boarding house involving Mr. Booth?
Many, sometimes lasting two, three hours and always in secret, behind closed doors.
And did you ever see Mary Surratt object to these, uh, meetings?
No, sir.
Or to the presence of those men?
No, she did not.
- Thank you.
- She appeared to welcome them.
Thank you. That'll be all,
Mr. Weichmann.
How long did you say these secret meetings lasted?
At least two, three hours.
You were timing them?
Eh, if you were timing them,
I suppose these secret meetings were not, in fact, kept secret from you.
I knew about them, sir, but I had no knowledge of what they were about.
And that is because you never attended any yourself, correct?
Exactly.
Why was that?
I thought them suspicious.
Suspicious?
Well, then, you see, you did know what they were about.
No, sir, I did not.
Then why were your suspicions aroused?
By the snatches of rebel conversation
I overheard in the hallways and by their frequent whisperings.
Well, in that case, if it was of such great concern to you, why did you not report your suspicions to your superiors at the War Department?
I did.
Excuse me?
I did reveal my suspicions.
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason in the War Department.
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...
Counselor, will that be all?
Uh, yes.
Uh, no.
No. No, I do have something else.
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.
- You ever been in Richmond?
- Objection.
I merely wish to know if the witness has ever visited the capital of the Confederacy.
I don't recall.
Then perhaps this train receipt will refresh your memory.
It indicates passage to Richmond, and it has your initials on it.
Yes.
That's right.
I considered continuing my divinity studies there after the war.
I plan on becoming a priest.
That's very nice.
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann, at which institute in Richmond you were thinking of enrolling?
The name?
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.
Well, uh--
- There is no academy of the kind...
- Objection.
...in Richmond, is there, Mr. Weichmann?
- In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...
- Objection, General.
...for another purpose entirely.
Objection sustained.
You worked for the general in charge of rebel prisoners, did you not?
Yes.
So?
Perhaps a distinguished clerk like yourself knew certain information.
What sort of information?
Information that might have been of divine interest to certain rebels within the capital of the Confederacy.
Objection, General.
The witness is not on trial here.
Well, he ought to be!
Objection sustained.
The witness is not on trial.
Sir, I am merely trying to establish the witness' credibility or rather the lack of credibility of this man.
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating the witness.
Incriminating? Sir,
Louis Weichmann shared a room with John Surratt.
I have a ticket that puts him in Richmond.
I think it reasonable to assume that he knows more about this plot to assassinate our president than he supposedly reported.
What Mr. Aiken thinks is entirely immaterial.
Counselor, unless you have something more relevant to ask, the witness will step down.
No.
No, I have nothing more... relevant to ask.
You never--you never ask a question you don't know the answer to.
I know. I know.
How--How did you know Weichmann was lying about Richmond, Fred?
- I didn't.
- You didn't?
S-so you gambled twice?
How did you pass the bar?
Well, Will, it worked.
I mean, Fred made Weichmann look as guilty as the others.
- It was perfect.
- You're right.
And that's the problem.
They all look guilty.
Freddie, I'm sorry.
First the senator drops your client like a load, and then with all these secret meetings taking place, either she knew what was going on...
Or she damn well should have known.
Senator?
In here.
I think she's as guilty as Booth.
How could I possibly defend her?
You assume that she's guilty, like the Commission.
You don't have any proof.
Proof or no, don't give a damn what happens to her.
I tell you what.
If you can prove that she's guilty, you can take yourself off the case.
Thank you, sir.
You think it'll be that easy?
I know it.
Pardon me, Father.
I wish to confer with the prisoner.
Alone, if you don't mind.
It's--It's quite all right, Mary.
I--I must be going anyway.
All right. Well, thank you for visiting, Father.
I'll see you soon.
Your words were most comforting.
The Lord's with you.
She's refusing to eat.
I've tried to convince her to no avail.
Perhaps you could help her.
"Search me, and know my heart.
"Try me, and know my thoughts.
And see if there be any wicked way in me."
"The Lord knows the way of the wicked.
And the way of the wicked will perish."
You know your Proverbs, young man.
My father was a minister.
He taught them to me as a child.
So, what is it you wish to know?
Why Booth and his associates were constants in your home.
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.
Forgive me if I chose to fill it with boarders.
I checked your registry, ma'am.
There's no record Booth ever stayed at your home.
No, the fact is he stayed at the
National whenever he came to Washington, so why was Booth in your home?
I suppose my son invited him.
They were friends.
Famous actor like Booth?
Engaging your son out of friendship?
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less a gentleman than you and very capable of forming acquaintances in society.
I've--I've read all about your family's acquaintances, ma'am, about how your late husband contributed to the Confederate cause and about your Gentleman Johnny.
What about him?
He made quite a sum as a courier carrying rebel secrets across Union lines.
Oh, I'm well aware of what your family's capable of,
Mrs. Surratt, so I know you're not telling me the truth.
Well, then you know what I do not.
You were despondent over losing the war, and you would have done anything you could to save the Confederacy, including using your own son John.
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.
So you arranged a meeting with Booth, figuring he'd befriend your son because of what he knew, what expert couriers do know.
And what might that be?
The best escape routes out of town.
Your son was supposed to lead the others to freedom that night, wasn't he?
Except he was the only one that got away.
My son was in Canada that day.
Can you prove that?
I received a letter on April 14, same day as the assassination, sent from Montreal.
Where is this letter?
I don't know.
I'm done, done defending your lies.
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken, you can't even see the truth.
Yes, my son hated the North.
We all did.
How can a Southerner feel anything but bitterness toward your side?
But my son did not conspire to kill your president.
He conspired to kidnap him.
All right, here he comes.
Ready your mount.
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?
He'll be here.
All right, steady.
Wait!
He's not coming!
Lincoln's changed his plans.
- What?
- He's still in town.
He just gave a speech at the National.
Anna, back upstairs.
Who was in the carriage?
Doesn't matter. What matters is he wasn't in the carriage.
You should have known.
What about the weapons?
We need to hide these weapons.
We can take them to Lloyd's.
I'll take 'em.
You'd shoot your own foot off.
I said I'd do it.
Don't push me.
Enough!
Fools like you are the reason we can lose this fight.
Johnny Surratt,
I'd like a word with you, please.
Well, answer, Johnny.
Your mama's callin'.
They planned on ransoming
Lincoln in exchange for all the Confederate soldiers in your prisons.
Why didn't you report them to the authorities?
Because one of them was my son.
So rather than kidnap him, your son helped murder the president instead.
No.
They nearly got the vice president and the secretary of State.
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.
Damn it, ma'am, you just said he was Booth's right hand.
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.
All right, then.
Swear to it.
Supper will be ready shortly.
John?
Can't stay, mama.
I have to leave town straightaway.
What's so pressing?
Nothing that need worry you.
Just some cotton speculatin'.
That's all.
Don't sport with me, son.
You're not steppin' outside this house.
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!
Richmond's falling.
Something must be done.
Johnny, I'm aware of the news from Richmond, and it pains me terribly.
Supper's ready.
Wh-what is it?
I'm leaving town.
No, you're not leaving town.
Yes, I am.
You and Anna are the only family
I've got left, and I'll be damned if I let you go out there and do something else foolish.
- Foolish?
- Johnny--
What I'm fightin' for is far more important than any of us.
Your family is more important than anything.
That is your responsibility!
All of our men are buried underground right now.
- The war is over.
- Oh, you're wrong about that.
There is nothing left for you to do.
The war is far from over, and there's still plenty I can do.
- Johnny, please.
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Please, Anna.
John!
Mother.
John, are you coming or not?
Johnny, please.
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for, then what is?
So that was the last time you saw your son?
Yes.
Less than two weeks before the assassination?
Yes.
So then, you see, you admit that your son conspired to kill
President Lincoln.
I don't know.
May God help you.
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.
Lord, I pray not.
All I know is that I did not.
I swear.
Miss Surratt.
You have to tell me exactly--
How is my mother?
She's managing. You have to tell me exactly what happened here.
What do you mean?
Do you know that Louis Weichmann, uh, your friend, testified against your mother after you told me he was like a son to her?
What went on here?
Why should I trust you?
Because your mother told me everything.
She told me about John.
She told me about the plot to kidnap
President Lincoln.
Anna, did you try and stop him?
How was I supposed to do that?
'Cause you're his older sister.
You don't know how stubborn my brother can be.
All right. Did your brother conspire to kill the president?
My brother left town weeks before the assassination.
It proves nothing. Look, the night he left the boarding house--
I've said all I will.
Miss Surratt, I'm trying--
I'm trying to help.
By condemning my brother?
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never allow that, and neither would l.
Oh. All right. All right, look, you knew about Weichmann.
If you know any potential witnesses the prosecution might call or what evidence they'll use against her, you must tell me.
Will you help me?
Let us proceed with events following the assassination of President Lincoln.
On the night of April 17, what were your duties, Major Smith?
I was charged with finding John Surratt, and we were searching the house.
Major, I found these.
They were here in the daughter's bedroom.
Major Smith, please read aloud what's inscribed here.
"Sic semper tyrannis."
Could you translate?
Of course. "Thus always for tyrants."
Are those words familiar to you?
Indeed.
Booth yelled them after he cut down our president.
You found the same three days later in her daughter's bedroom next to a photograph of the assassin himself.
Like a shrine, sir.
Uh...
Please continue.
Uh, objection.
Sic semper tyrannis is the state motto of virginia.
It hardly constitutes proof of a shrine to Booth.
No further proof is needed, Mr. Aiken.
Proceed, Mr. Holt.
Continue, Major Smith.
As I was fixing to take the Surratts to headquarters for questioning, there was a knock at the door.
You all right, ma'am?
I--I must be mistaken.
Wait a minute.
Whom do you wish to see?
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.
This is her place. Bring him in.
Is she expecting you?
She sent for me, asked me to dig a gutter for her.
At this time of night?
In the morning.
I just wanted to know what time.
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.
Ma'am, did you hire this man to dig a gutter for you?
No, sir.
Do you know this man?
No, sir.
Is this the man she denies knowing?
No, sir.
Is this the man she denies knowing?
Yes, sir.
Lewis Payne.
The same man boarded at the Surratts' prior to daggering the secretary of State and his kin.
Yes.
Thank you, Major. Nothing further.
Major Smith, are you aware that Lewis Payne boarded at the Surratts' under an alias, claiming to be a Baptist minister from Baltimore named Wood?
That's what she claimed.
She claimed?
I would like to submit into evidence this ledger of guest accounts from the Surratt boarding house.
Supposing, as this evidence would seem to suggest, that that were the truth-- suppose Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night to recognize Wood the preacher in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.
He was standing in full view of her not three paces.
General Hunter, since accepting this case,
I have come to learn that my client's eyesight is defective.
I have here a sworn affidavit from her doctor stating just that.
Major Smith, it was dark.
It was nighttime.
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply... failed to see him?
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher and two months later a laborer, then I would recognize him as the same person.
Thank you, Major Smith.
A simple yes or no will do.
Is it possible she failed to see him properly?
Yes, I suppose it's possible.
No further questions.
The prosecution seems unable to present any proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Uh, could somebody bring me the transcript of today's trial?
Shall I read it aloud to you?
Oh, Ed.
Your young associate is putting up a spirited defense.
Reminds me of a certain lawyer
I had to face 25 years ago.
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.
Can I get you a drink?
No, no. No, I won't be staying long.
Reverdy...
You've done as much for this nation as any man I know.
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.
Don't you think it's time for us two old war horses to call a truce?
Not if you insist on staging this travesty.
This trial will do more to keep the peace than any paper treaty could.
Heh. How'd you convince yourself of that?
Because justice, swift and firm, will help deter the South from ever conspiring again, as well as discouraging the North from seeking revenge.
What about the rule of law?
My first responsibility is to ensure that this war stays won.
Oh, and this is how you do it, by keeping fear alive as long as you see fit?
Look. "Stanton warns of future rebel plots," uh, water supplies poisoned, um... firebombing cities.
Uh, yellow fever spreading all over the place.
This is a frightened country, Ed.
You don't need to scare us anymore.
And who is to say that none of these things could happen?
The unspeakable already has--
Our president assassinated,
600,000 dead.
The world has changed, Reverdy.
Abandoning the Constitution is not the answer.
You may prefer dining alone.
I just hope your young associate does as well.
If he pushes too hard, he will make enemies who will not soon forget.
On this, you know I'm right.
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.
Stand down.
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton doesn't see anyone without an appointment.
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.
Morning.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
If you can arrange an appointment for me with the secretary, you can.
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now, but perhaps you'd care to have a word with me instead.
Please.
My client is unwell.
So I hear. Touch of the woman's curse.
I'm sure she'll be well enough to continue her trial in a few days.
She's been in solitary confinement for over a month.
She hasn't eaten in over a week.
She's refusing to eat.
All the prisoners are fed daily.
Soft bread and salted meat.
Unless she has a proper meal and some fresh air,
I can't guarantee she'll be fit for trial.
One of the conspirators refuses to be guarded by a Negro, and the other insists on only eating his mother's cooking.
We can't accommodate every whim.
Come now. I am merely asking for you to stop treating her like a savage.
How dare you accuse us of savagery?
Have you forgotten how our own were treated by the rebels?
Of course not.
Well...
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.
If this treatment of her continues, she will not be sound of mind.
And I trust that is something the government wishes to avoid.
I may have a way to serve all interests.
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?
Father.
Counselor.
Feel that sun.
Do I have you to thank for this?
Well, thank you.
Well, if I could just get you to start eating.
Left. Left.
Left, right, left.
Company halt.
Mary, there's something
I need to ask you.
I've never seen you at a loss for words, young man:
Do you know where your son is hiding?
Johnny?
Of course not.
Government believes you do.
What do you believe?
I believe you know more than you're willing to tell me.
Uh, have you ever cared for something greater than yourself?
I've spent these last four years fighting for something greater than myself, so don't--
Then we are the same.
Mary, you have to tell us where your son is.
Us?
I have to tell "us"?
Whose side are you on?
I'm trying to defend you.
By suggesting I trade my son for myself?
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.
I wish I could give you what you need. I truly do.
But if you want out, you'll have to find another way.
I'm gonna take a walk.
It's so nice out.
Do you care to walk with me?
So we're stuck in these shallow trenches.
We're surrounded on all sides.
Nobody knows what to do.
Nobody knows what to say.
We're frozen, completely petrified.
And then from somewhere up on the hill, we hear this loud booming Southern voice.
It's the rebel general.
He yells, "Y'all boys better say your prayers, because there are 400 of us and only 100 of you."
You can stop right there, Baker.
And so then this madman, he stands up, and he yells back to him, and he says-- he says, "Hundred?
Heck, we've got less than that.
But we don't surrender, so come and get us."
And with that, he pulls down his pants and bares his arse.
You didn't.
- I didn't.
- What?
It doesn't seem as though Fred ever intends to surrender.
Ah, it appears he already has.
She's fair, fit and 40.
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic, wears black from head to toe?
I hear she spits in the faces of every Union soldier she encounters.
Apparently she wears a necklace made from the bone of a Union soldier.
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly doubt she's guilty?
So, okay, who would like to dance?
- Yes.
- Yes. Good.
Dance?
It's more like a wake.
I suppose I should have dressed more like Mrs. Surratt.
Fred, what are you doing?
I'm enduring the pain of having to listen to Baker.
You know what I mean.
If she's found guilty, they'll say you weren't up to the task.
And God forbid you prevail.
They'll think you just as much a traitor as she.
Baker, how 'bout something a little happier?
- Little happier?
- Yeah.
All right, Fred. Happier, he wants.
William's right, you know.
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.
Sarah.
What is it about Mary Surratt you find so compelling?
These are criminal, despicable people, Fred.
They're--they're the same sort of people you risked your life fighting against, and she helped kill your commander in chief.
I don't know what she's guilty of.
May I ask you one more thing?
What is it, Sarah?
Does the captain remember how to dance?
Of course.
Few people will forget what side you fought on.
Trust me. It can be lonely.
I'm just upholding my oath as an attorney and doing my job. It's what you asked.
It's what you told me to do.
This habit of quoting me back to me could become most irritating.
You have your mother's convictions and your father's annoying habits.
Well, "Mary Surratt is entitled to a defense, Freddie, so I shall defend her."
If they want John Surratt, then you should serve him up on a platter.
I--I don't mean, uh, physically.
I mean in spirit.
You have to prove to the Commission that he is responsible, not her.
She's not gonna like that.
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant of Mary Surratt, are you not?
Yes, sir.
I run a tavern some 10 miles from the city on a property she owns.
And on the afternoon that President Lincoln was assassinated, did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?
Yes, sir, in the company of Louis Weichmann.
And she brought you a package, did she not?
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.
Small package wrapped in newspaper.
Did she tell you where the package came from?
Said it came from John Wilkes Booth.
John Wilkes Booth!
And what exactly did she give you?
Objection.
There's no way the defendant could have known what was inside.
He just testified the package was wrapped.
Overruled.
Witness will answer the question.
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?
Field glasses, sir.
Field glasses?
Field glasses like these?
Exactly.
With the initials "J.W.B." inscribed on them.
Did she give you any instructions?
Sir?
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?
Instructions which may affect this trial?
Oh. Yes, sir.
Ahem. She told me,
"Lloyd, get those shootin' irons ready.
There will be parties here tonight who will call for them."
You liar!
Order!
- He's a liar!
- Order!
- It's a lie.
- Order!
Control yourself, madam.
Such outbursts will only prejudice your case.
Oh, Lord.
I just don't see how I could possibly further prejudice this case, sir.
Counselor, you will control your client.
General.
Shooting irons!
Shooting irons.
And to what was she referring?
Army rifles, sir, hidden in the joist above the dining room.
And what else did she tell you?
She said I was to get two bottles of whiskey ready, too.
And were these things called for, as per the defendant's instructions?
Yes, sir.
About midnight, sir, the night of the assassination, by two men on horses, one...
I'd seen before.
T'other was a stranger to me.
I brought the items, thinking these were the parties Mrs. Surratt meant.
Two of 'em rode off so fast, they could have outrun Creation and give it two-mile a start.
Your witness.
I did not...
Mr. Lloyd.
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified that Louis Weichmann accompanied the defendant that afternoon.
Right.
So then I can correctly assume that he would also testify to having heard her instructions to you.
No.
She took me out by the woodpile out of earshot.
So you're saying that nobody heard this conversation, just you and her.
Way it happened, sir.
Of course it is.
Of course it is.
When did you learn of President Lincoln's assassination?
Well, who can forget when they heard?
The next morning, a Captain Cottingham told me.
He was searching for the assassins.
No doubt, you were most upset.
Indeed.
I got myself right smart in liquor.
Yes, you're--you're right smart in liquor most days,
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd?
- Objection.
In fact, I hear that you're your own best customer.
Objection.
Sustained.
This Captain Cottingham, did he ask you anything in reference to the assassins?
He asked if any parties had passed through.
Naturally I told him about the two I knew.
Actually, you did not.
According to this witness report, you said nothing for two days.
I was frightened is all. l feared the assassins might come for me.
Perhaps, though, you were afraid that the authorities might consider you an accessory.
Well, it was through the Surratts that I got myself in such difficulty.
The Surratts.
Don't you mean John Surratt, to be more precise?
Wasn't it he who brought the shooting irons to your tavern door in the first place?
Yeah.
And he showed you where to hide them?
I didn't want to.
So you're saying that he asked you, forced you to do so against your will.
Yes.
So he brought them to you, he showed you where to hide them, and he forced you to hide them against your will?
That's right. Yes, exactly.
If John Surratt was capable of putting Mr. Lloyd, Louis Weichmann and Lord knows how many others at risk, who's to say he didn't do the same to his mother?
- Objection.
- Stop this!
- Sir, it seems the--
- Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.
- It seems the only thing...
- Objection.
- General, objection.
- that Mary Surratt might be guilty of
- is having given birth to her son John.
- How dare you?
Objection sustained.
That will be all, Mr. Aiken.
Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd, it was the defendant, Mary Surratt, who just hours before the assassination brought you field glasses and instructed you to prepare rifles and two bottles of whiskey?
Yeah.
Thank you.
General Hunter, members of the Commission, the government rests its case against Mary Surratt.
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd.
You may step down.
What did they promise you to say that, Mr. Lloyd?
Counselor, I'm warning you.
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.
You best hush up.
I'll put you in the ground, boy.
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.
You shut him up.
Sit down, sir.
Now... we will adjourn.
When we resume, the defense may call its first witness.
Left. Left.
Excuse me, sirs.
Uh, Captain Cottingham?
Yes.
Can I have a word with you, please?
Sir.
And did you interview John Lloyd, the man who runs the tavern on Mrs. Surratt's property?
Yes, right after the assassination.
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt asked for rifles and whiskey?
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him to do all those things.
Uh, excuse me?
Did we not talk just yesterday?
We did.
And did you not say that Mrs. Surratt never asked for whiskey or rifles of John Lloyd?
I do not deny that.
And now you're swearing, under oath, that what you told me then was a lie.
Yes. I lied to you 'cause I thought you had no business to ask me.
No business? I--
You're my witness.
Should I not expect the truth?
I state here that I did lie to you, but under oath, now I'm telling the truth.
Mr. Holt, do you wish to question the witness?
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard is more than sufficient.
Captain, you may step down.
As you know, tonight marks
Washington's celebration honoring our troops, so we will adjourn.
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?
It's not enough that you, uh-- you set the rules.
You--You pick the judges.
Now you have to turn my witness as well.
Counselor, control yourself.
Control the prosecution.
Mr. Aiken.
Every witness I wish to call has either been turned by jail or the threat of it.
That's enough!
There is no limit to how far the prosecution is willing to go!
Stand down, counselor, or I will hold you in contempt.
You had better comport yourself in a more appropriate manner, or you will find yourself incarcerated with the others.
Good evening.
Good evening, Douglas.
- Ma'am.
- Good evening.
Mr. Aiken, may I have a word with you?
Of course. Would you excuse me?
MAN: His first day on the job.
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.
It's all right, Douglas.
It's not your fault.
Frederick!
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah upstairs for me, please?
Sure, but, uh--
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
Come on, Sarah.
Even with one good leg,
I can still outdance him.
Another night, Nick.
Sarah.
Sarah, where are you going?
"Conduct unbecoming."
I'm sorry about the party.
You think I care about the party?
Please. Everything will be all right.
I promise you.
You are just like that woman, ready to go to the gallows for the most pointless cause.
People do get left behind when you do that.
I can't ignore what's going on in that courtroom.
But you can ignore me, us?
I didn't say that.
Please, I have to do this.
Do you?
I find your devotion to this frightening.
I waited such a long time for you.
I'm so sorry.
I know. But I'm back now.
No, you're not.
I am, I--ple--
Sarah, please, will you just--
We have to-- we have to talk about this.
Fred, I love you, I--
I wish I could do this. I just--I can't.
I just can't.
Wait. Let me see you home at least.
Please wait.
Uh, Mr. Secretary.
I have to speak with you.
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't the best time.
What is happening to Mary Surratt is an abomination.
Stand down, Captain.
It's all right.
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?
I'll just be a moment.
Yes, sir.
Young man... always indebted to you for your courage in the field, but you must learn to tread lightly.
Tread lightly?
I will not tread lightly.
You have predetermined her fate.
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely with the Commission.
My concern is preserving our Union.
Why did I fight for the Union if my rights aren't assured?
You tell me.
Fine words for rallying the troops, not for running a nation.
They assassinated our president, and someone must be held accountable.
The people want that.
It's John Surratt you want.
You don't even want Mary.
I'll settle for either one.
If you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting.
Mr. Aiken.
May I come in?
- It's late.
- I know.
I need you to testify. very well.
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.
I need you to tell them that your brother is not.
I won't do it.
You know what'll happen to her if you don't?
Anna...
Your brother does not need to be saved right now.
Your mother does.
Mr. Aiken, are there any other witnesses you wish to call?
Uh, yes.
The--The defense would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.
General Hunter, what is--
Place your right hand on this Bible.
Where's my mother?
Anna, she's just right here, behind these men.
Why won't they let me see her?
I don't know.
Please, Miss Surratt.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
Miss Anna.
I do.
It'll be all right.
Miss Surratt, can you tell us when your brother first became acquainted with John Wilkes Booth?
Miss Surratt, you will answer the question.
I believe my brother met him January last.
Three months before the assassination.
He must have been mighty pleased to have befriended such a famous actor.
You'll have to ask him.
Well, I'm sure we'd all like to ask him.
Your brother proudly called himself a friend of Booth's, did he not?
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?
Mother!
Miss Surratt. Miss Surratt, please.
Miss Surratt.
I never... asked what my brother's relationship was to Booth.
It was at John's invitation that he first came to your home, was it not?
Yes.
Does this picture of Booth belong to you?
I found it in a gallery one day, and I bought it.
Your brother must have been pleased that you held his friend in such high regard.
- No.
- No?
No. He told me to tear it up and throw it away.
Why?
Why did your brother tell you to destroy a photograph of his friend, Booth?
No, Mr. Aiken!
- Please.
- I beg of you.
- Please.
- Order!
Miss Surratt, please.
Answer my question.
I suppose he was trying to protect us.
He was trying to protect you and your mother?
Yes.
Why would he need to protect his family?
Anna, you have to choose.
I suppose... he and Booth were planning something.
He was planning something.
Did you know what?
Of course not.
When did you last see your brother?
He left at the beginning of April.
Days before the assassination.
Did he tell you where he was going or what he might be planning?
He only said he had to leave.
And did you or your mother try to stop him?
Yes.
- But we couldn't.
- How could you? He was angry.
He was frustrated with the war.
He hated the Union.
He would have done anything in his power, even risk his own family to aid Booth in his cause.
But, Miss Surratt, did your mother conspire with John Wilkes Booth?
Absolutely not.
Thank you.
There are no more questions.
General Hunter, the government understands why Miss Surratt would be moved to the most extraordinary lengths to conceal her mother's guilt, including incriminating her own brother.
My mother is innocent.
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.
The government no longer deems it necessary to hold you.
You are free to leave.
I just want to see my mother.
Please. I'm sorry, mother.
I'm sorry.
Please. Please, let me see her.
Sir, the defense would push for the Commission to show some compassion and allow a mother to see her daughter for a brief moment only.
We will reconvene in the morning.
Frederick, it's me.
Anna.
What are you doing here?
You never asked why I had Booth's photo.
Tear that up and throw it away.
That man is gonna get us all in trouble, if not worse.
I should have thrown it away, but I didn't.
So you were infatuated with Booth.
I swear I didn't know what he was capable of.
I believe you. But your brother did.
Can you save my mother without him?
Can you, Frederick?
Probably not.
Father Walter!
Father?
Will you excuse us for a minute?
Counselor.
I need to see John Surratt right away.
Anna Surratt sent me.
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,
I can only pass along a message.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Only that some in the church have chosen to provide him sanctuary.
You don't seem troubled by their choice.
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.
He's wanted for murder and treason.
Harboring him is not only immoral,
Father, it's illegal.
Our laws are written here, counselor, our allegiance to God.
You forgive me, Father, but that's a bunch of cock and bull.
Bible bears as many interpretations as anything else.
Is there a message you wish me to pass along?
My case summary is tomorrow, so you tell John Surratt that unless he surrenders himself, his mother will most likely be punished for his crimes.
Mr. Aiken.
For the lawyer as well as the soldier, there is an equally imperative command.
That duty is to shelter from injustice the innocent, to protect the weak from oppression and, when necessity demands, to rally to the defense of those being wronged.
After the most thorough investigation in our nation's history, the government's entire case against Mary Surratt rests on three acts-- one, her acquaintance with Booth, two, her alleged instructions to Lloyd, and, three, her nonrecognition of Payne.
It is these three acts that constitute the sum total of Mary Surratt's part in this traitorous and murderous conspiracy.
By themselves, they constitute no crime.
Any one of you or I might have done the same, but the government insists she did them with evil intent, largely based on the testimony of two men,
John Lloyd and Louis Weichmann.
Yet, at best, the actions of these men undermine their credibility, and, at worst, they have done the unspeakable-- they have gained their freedom by falsely accusing another of their crime.
There can be no doubt as to the principal and real reason that Mary Surratt is here today.
It's because of her son, John Surratt.
He invited Booth into her home.
She did not.
And he hid rifles and ammunition in Lloyd's Tavern.
She did not.
If John Surratt was part of this conspiracy,
I pray to God that he receives every punishment known to man, but if his mother can be convicted on such insufficient evidence,
I tell you none of you are safe.
Members of the Commission, do not permit this injustice to Mary Surratt by sacrificing our sacred rights out of revenge.
Too many of us have laid down our lives to preserve them.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
One bullet may have killed our beloved president.
One bullet, but not one man.
Sit with me.
Is there any word?
No. They're still deliberating.
I mean about my son.
I held him too close.
I didn't want John turning out like his father, so I kept him near.
And when the war broke out, he wanted to enlist, but I wouldn't let him.
My son just needed to break free... be his own man.
And this is the way he did it.
All those in favor?
Aye.
Well, then, we are all agreed on the penalty of death for the prisoners
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.
What about the woman?
Regarding Mary Surratt, all those in favor, gentlemen?
No.
Damn it!
No.
No, she must be punished to the full extent.
I want these people buried and forgotten.
The majority prefer a more merciful sentence, life in prison on account of her age, gender.
I give Mr. Aiken credit.
He knew just how to use the daughter.
It seems so.
You made my sentiments known to the Commission?
Their minds are made.
Then let us change them.
"After mature consideration of the evidence,
"Commission finds you, Mary E. Surratt,
"guilty--
"guilty of conspiring to kill and murder
"President Abraham Lincoln,
"guilty of conspiring to kill and murder
"Andrew Johnson, vice president of the United States,
"guilty of conspiring to kill and murder
"William H. Seward, secretary of State.
"The Commission does therefore sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you be dead."
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!
Four assassins die tomorrow at noon!
Here you go, sir.
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!
Four assassins die tomorrow at noon!
Mr. Surratt.
Here, sir.
There must be something we can do.
You have three options:
Petition the president for a stay of execution-- but, uh, he won't do that, because if he did, people would think he was part of the conspiracy.
Uh, two, apply for a writ of habeas corpus to retry her in a civilian court, but no judge would oppose Stanton or the might of the War Department.
Uh, and, three, John Surratt shows himself before noon tomorrow.
Are you going somewhere?
I have business in Baltimore.
What?
You--You can't leave now!
It's over.
Freddie, she's not your mother.
If John Surratt won't give himself up for her, then why should you?
Freddie!
Frederick Sebastian Aiken, we know you're in there!
Open the door now. Come on.
Fred--ah, there he is.
Well, if it isn't the reclusive Master Aiken.
We thought you could use this.
Hamilton, how well do you know Judge Olin?
What are you doing?
You think he'll give me a writ of habeas corpus?
You can't pursue a writ.
They won't allow me to appeal this verdict, so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.
If you do this, you will humiliate Stanton, and he will destroy you.
The hell with Stanton.
Why do you--
Why do you insist on standing by her?
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.
What they're doing to her is wrong.
If John Wilkes Booth himself was tried in the same manner, it would still be wrong.
Hamilton, she's to hang in less than 12 hours.
Judge Olin's out of town.
He would have been my first choice.
What about Wylie?
Maybe Wylie.
He's, uh- -he's always been known as a Free Thinker.
Yes. He's been around for ages, but he was the closest to Lincoln.
Then what about Carter?
Not a chance. He was with Stanton on the night of the assassination.
Besides, they have dinner together once a week.
Then you're saying that Wylie is my best option.
No. Your best option is to stop this nonsense and help us empty this bottle.
Better listen to the man.
Judge Wylie?
I, uh--I need to apply for a writ of habeas corpus.
At this hour of the night?
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.
Interrupting an old man's sleep?
I'd say you're getting off on the wrong foot, son.
It's for Mary Surratt.
A new trial... in a civil court by a jury of her peers.
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?
Yes, please, Your Honor.
So we can relive our president's assassination all over again.
That's not my intention.
Then to what intent?
Might this not result in exactly the same thing?
Perhaps, but results should not be our only measure ofjustice.
Are you going to lecture me on justice?
Sorry, sir.
You realize that I was personally appointed by President Lincoln.
Yes.
And yet you still come to me.
Forgive me, Your Honor, but are we not obligated to follow the law at all times, regardless of our emotions?
And is this not driven by emotions?
Isn't that what this is all about?
It's about preventing injustice.
Now, I know that the people are still angry.
Yes, they are, and so am I.
But I hope,
I trust that President Lincoln appointed you because you hold the Constitution sacred.
Whether you believe Mary Surratt is guilty or innocent, the Constitution was intended...
And now you're gonna lecture me on the Constitution.
...to protect the rights of all citizens at all times in peace or war.
And in a matter of hours, it will have failed to protect her unless you sign that writ.
You believe she's innocent?
I don't know.
But if we don't get a proper trial, we never will.
You can't go in there! Wait!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I tried to stop him.
It's all right.
Good morning, Joseph.
Good morning.
It appears that Mr. Aiken has procured a writ signed by Judge Wylie.
Good day.
Before you go, Captain, tell me... when you first learned that our secretary of State had been butchered to within an inch of his life and that they put a bullet in the back of our president's head, when this city was in chaos, did you not wish to see order restored and justice served, or were you just concerned with the rights of the assassins?
It's notjustice you're after.
It's revenge.
I would never go to such lengths out of vengeance, but to ensure the survival of this nation, I would do anything.
Mary Surratt was a party to the most grievous crime in our history.
Necessity demands that she be given a swift, sure and harsh sentence. l, too, hold sacred our rights, counselor, but they count not at all if our nation ceases to exist.
Please see to it that Mary Surratt is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom no later than noon... sir.
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.
You will have to stand trial again, but it will be a civilian trial.
And a civilian trial has no generals.
That's correct. No generals.
Bless you, son.
Bless you.
Oh, Mama.
Anna.
Should only be three.
It's time, ma'am.
What are you doing?
We need to prepare her with the others.
No. No, she is to be transferred to Judge Wylie's court.
I advise sedating the young lady.
You'll do no such thing.
Anna. I have procured a writ that says she is to get a new trial.
Presidentjust suspended your writ.
I'm sorry.
She's to hang with the others.
No.
No. Frederick, do something.
I--
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no.
No. No, no, no, no.
No, Mama. No. No, Mama. No.
I'll always be with you.
No! No! Oh, Mama, no!
I love you, Anna. I love you.
No!
Oh, God, no!
Mama!
Inter arma, silent leges.
"In times of war, the law falls silent."
It shouldn't.
Word is the last Confederate general surrendered to Union troops.
Peace.
Peace at last.
I am hereby commanded to cause David E. Herold,
G. A. Atzerodt,
Lewis Payne and Mary E. Surratt to be executed in accordance with the order of the president of the United States,
Andrew Johnson.
The Almighty God bless you.
Stand your prisoners up.
Step them to the noose.
Okay, sir. I'll show you where he's at--
No, I know the way.
Mr. Aiken.
I didn't think you'd come.
I don't know what help I can be to you.
I've left the law.
I just wanted to thank you for the kindness that you showed my mother.
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,
I never thought they'd kill her.
Father Walter asked that I give you these.
They were your mother's.
I hope they can be of some comfort to you.
They belong to you.
You were more of a son to her than I ever was.
Thank you.
You... are... very good at blow jobs.
Thank you.
And I am brilliant at receiving them. Mm. Yes.
You were very well behaved.
So polite of you just to lie back and take it.
Thank you, I do my best.
You, on the other hand, brought the bloody house down.
Shut up.
You're incredibly noisy.
Why would you say that? no, no, it's not a bad thing.
Course it's a bad thing.
Makes me feel...
Like a prostitute.
No. Paranoid.
It makes me feel paranoid.
What do you mean, a prostitute?
Well, I don't mean prostitute.
Well, not a professional one.
You've got a long way to go till you're that good.
Shut up. When I have sex with you,
I close my eyes, and I imagine
I'm hunched over a prostitute.
Hunched? It's the only reason
I like having sex with yer.
I'm going for a wee. stay here and have sex with me.
Get off.
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
Six letters.
How did we get home last night?
Barney gave us a lift. Did he?
Why was he driving when he could have been drinking?
What? You heard.
He's starting at HSBC today.
Oh, yeah.
Silly old sod.
Why's he got himself a job for?
Oh, I think I need a pooh as well.
Charming.
He's been watching Titanic...again.
Steve, can you make me some toast?
No, er, you'll eat in the bed and I won't get rid of the crumbs.
Yes, you will.
Can't you just have it as bread? Raw?
Yeah. In the morning?
Yes, why not?
We must have had a million pizzas in there.
Yeah I know, but it's just something
Julie used to do and I never liked it.
What? Don't watch me.
You look so cute on the loo.
Steve.
OK, it's fine, you can have toast if you want. No, I don't want it now.
Get out. Obviously it's fine for
Julie and her big fucking tits.
They weren't as big as they looked.
How very disappointing for you, but despite her disappointingly gargantuan tits, you still found it in your heart to let her eat toast in bed with you.
What a saint.
Are you going to make me toast or not? Oh, shit.
Beg your pardon? Er...nothing.
Are you going to make me toast?
Yes, yes, whatever.
Thank you. 
Don't let him in, he'll hear me.
It's only Dan.
You all right, Dan?
Morning, campers.
This got put through my door.
Oh, right, great.
Becky stay over last night?
Yeah, her parents have got people staying, so...
Hung over, dare I ask?
Yeah, a bit, but she's fine.
She has an egg before bed so she doesn't get a hangover.
Oh, right, yeah.
So why does she do that?
Well, so she doesn't get a hangover.
That's good, yeah. What's she do?
Are you taking the piss?
No, I was just...being chatty.
Making conversation.
Well, don't.
Anita didn't reply to my e-mail.
I don't know if she's read it.
Know her password. Er, been watching
Titanic again? Yeah, we heard.
Yeah, Winslet's tits. Yeah.
Thank God for the pause button.
Hello, mate.
Er, well I hope you're with Laura, but...
You know what I mean.
What? What? What?
Eurgh, Paul.
What's going on?
Paul, why are you telling me this? Why is he telling you what?
Oh, you didn't.
Not Sporty? Oh, you filthy bastard.
OK, yeah. OK, OK.
It's fine, it's fine,
I'll kill it, it's fine.
Well, I don't know, I'll make something up.
Yeah, speak to you later, mate.
Bye.
Any news? Paul spent the night with a girl who looks like Sporty Spice.
Sporty Spice? I know.
Sporty Spice.
Do you reckon she does back-to-front?
What's back-to-front?
What's back-to-front?
Ooh, that's followed you out.
What has?
Shut the door.
I haven't been doing anything.
You all right, Dan? Yeah.
Popped down to say hello, really.
Hello. Hello. How was your weekend?
Peaks and troughs, you know.
Peaks and troughs.
I would have preferred to have spent it with a Spice Girl, but, er...
Dan.
A Spice Girl? Better go.
Yeah, thanks, Dan.
He wasn't even wearing a watch.
I hate it when people do that.
Why would anyone still fancy the Spice Girls?
Look, it's from Rob. "Steve, having a great time, nice weather, Rob".
Why do I care what the weather's like in Spain?
Why were you and Dan talking about the Spice Girls?
We weren't.
Why would anyone still fancy the Spice Girls?
Well, I don't. Come on.
Let's have sex.
Why are you lying to me about the Spice Girls?
I'm not. Now get your knickers off.
Yeah, yeah, mm, mm.
Oh, it doesn't need to be that loud.
Oh, no.
What? Oh, God.
What? Oh, I bet she's really...
What, what is it? Poor thing.
Rebecca! It's my sister.
She says Paul didn't come home last night.
Have you heard anything?
What, Paul?
Yeah. No.
Just have a check. No. Nope.
She's just being a drama queen. I bet she's sent that text to everyone.
Yeah it's probably fine, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Forget about it.
We're missing Cash In The Attic.
We're about to have sex.
Oh, yeah. Mm.
Ooh. Was that a fart?
No, it was my tummy.
Well, that sounded like a fart.
Are you going to make me toast?
You know I can't have sex on an empty stomach.
OK.
OK, I'll make you toast.
Fine, but you're eating it on the chair, and afterwards we are shagging.
Wow. It's like being a princess.
Steve, why have you put your mug face down on the floor?
Jesus Christ.
Urgh, kill it!
No, he might have babies.
Chuck it out the window, then.
No, no, you can get AIDS from a spider.
You can't! You can.
If he's been crawling round in the blood of an AIDS victim...
Steve, be a man for once in your life and get rid of the spider.
All right, all right, give me that.
Don't touch, don't touch.
Stay behind me.
Yeah, I'll deal with him in a minute, when I've worked out a plan.
Upside down. You put a mug upside down, not face down.
Ignore him. Oh, I can't.
Do you want to clear the bed for the fuck fest?
OK.
Fuck fest? What?
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
Dan's back.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hi, Laura, you all right, babe?
What a total bastard.
What are you making?
Toast. Ooh, very posh. Yeah.
Thinking I might pop to Azeen, you know, get some fruit. OK.
Just read an article about melon, yeah.
Fancy getting a melon with me?
Becky could come, too.
Ooh, I'm sure she'd love to, but we're, er, kind of busy this morning. Sex.
Yeah.
I heard her hollering earlier.
Don't say that.
Don't be silly.
No. No, he shouldn't be putting you through all this.
No, I know. Really?
Straight away?
OK.
Yeah. Course he won't mind.
All right then.
Bye, love.
Have I outstayed my welcome?
Yeah. No problem.
Get that fruit.
Good idea. Bye.
Bye-bye.
Right, You hold the plate beneath the toast, you eat it on the chair.
Wow, what's this?
I thought you might like to watch.
Really? Yeah, where do you want me?
On the bed. Arse down.
Thought you didn't like being watched. I don't mind, if you do something for me.
Like what?
Like...letting Laura pop round.
Laura!
Well, she's my sister. Steve. She's feeling really down about Paul.
There is nothing wrong with
Paul, I told you.
I'll moan and groan as loud as you like.
Yeah well, er... not too loud.
Come here.
Oh, that'll be Laura.
That was quick.
Well, she was on her way already.
So when you asked me if I wanted to watch...
I let you watch me. Now be nice to Laura. Oh, God!
Hello, love, how you feeling?
I'm so worried, Becks.
Look at me, I'm shaking.
He's being a total bastard.
Laura's here.
Hi, Laura, are you all right?
Paul didn't come home last night.
Look at me, Steve, I'm shaking.
Yeah.
I couldn't even go to work.
Have you heard from him?
No. I'm sure he's fine, though.
He's a big lad,
I'm sure everything's tickety boo.
I need a piss.
Thanks for sharing that with us.
Is his phone still off? Yeah.
I left a message to say that I was here.
And I was thinking, maybe what's happened with little Luke, with his scans and Luke's
Mum, Natalie, the slut.
You didn't flush. Steve.
You did a shit, and you didn't flush.
I didn't want Dan to hear.
You're an animal.
I can hardly breathe in there.
Oh, stop overreacting.
Careful, Steve, there's a mug on the floor. This is my flat.
I'm the one who has to live here in your stench. Oh, well done.
Steve, there's a mug on the floor.
If you shit in my flat, you flush in my flat.
You've really got a way with words, haven't you?
If you want to do a stinky shit, go back to your parents' house and do it.
My Uncle Dennis is staying over.
There's a mug face down on the floor, Steve.
Yes, Laura I know! I put it there.
I keep a spider in it.
Face down.
You know Dan upstairs?
Pyjamas. Yeah.
He's watching Titanic for what is it, the...
Fourth. Fourth time this week.
He just split up with a girl that looks like Winslet.
Oh, she doesn't look like Winslet.
She's just fat and posh.
He wanted me to buy fruit with him.
Who goes out of their way to buy fruit?
Oh, I'd love a mango.
What? Wouldn't you, Laur?
Oh, yeah.
What are you going to do with a mango?
Eat it. How?
Don't know. A mango?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
They're like a pound each.
Fucking mango?
All right, Steve, mind the language, Laura's upset.
Sorry, Laura.
I'm sure Paul's absolutely fine.
Thanks, Steve.
OK?
Have you seen the new telly?
Is that it? Mm, yep.
Not bad, is it? Found it in the skip.
Isn't he a dream?
Oh, that's Paul. It's his knock.
Go on, Laur, you answer it.
Be strong.
Thank God for that.
I can explain everything, darling, it's not my fault.
It was events, it was some real nasty events, and I just missed you so much, darling.
Yeah.
Mm. You going to let me watch you with this?
No, course not.
You're such a pervert.
I don't even know why you bought this thing.
Her favourite thing about him is his big dick.
Isn't that revolting? Well... he might have a big dick but I bet he can't do a dick dance.
Can he, Becks? Can he?
Shall I do my dick dance?
Yes. Shall I? Yes. Shall I?
And you know how I've been with Luke being ill.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I'm being selfish.
Well, you are. You are being really selfish, but that's OK, because you're my darling, remember?
Look at it.
We have a bond and we're getting married.
Yeah. Like two become one.
Like, what made you say that?
Mm, what? When two become one?
Oh, it's just a phrase, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
Ooh, yeah.
Thank you, fans. Thank you, fans.
Paul could never do a dick dance as good as that. No.
And I bet if he did he wouldn't have that bit of loo roll caught in his foreskin.
What? Ohh. do they smell good?
Mm, they smell lovely.
Do you want to smell? Mm, yeah.
Course I don't want to smell!
Is everything all right? Yeah,
I was being silly, he was at Iggy's.
Probably let her know next time,
Paul. Yeah, sorry. Sorry, everyone.
He's forgetful like that, while I'm too far the opposite way.
That's why we're the perfect couple.
Steve was just doing a dick dance.
Becky.
A what? Nothing.
If you guys are OK why don't you treat yourselves to a nice meal deal, get some air.
Don't let Paul do a dick dance, Laur, he'd have someone's eye out with that great big thing.
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
No chance of Steve doing that, is there, love? You're funny.
Ooh, is it small, Steve?
No, to be fair, it's not small.
I'm flattered. But it's not exactly going to split you in two.
It's fine, it's normal size,
I measured it.
What? I measured it. You measured it?
Yes, with a ruler.
Oh, that's a lovely image.
Was it a 15-centimetre ruler, Steve?
That doesn't even work.
What, can't you take a joke, mate?
How, how, how did this happen?
Why did they invent the microscope?
So Steve could find his dick.
Well, you've nicked that one off
Barney. Why can't you take a joke?
Why don't you go back to Iggy's?
Steve was having a wank the other day but he couldn't find any tissues, so he had to use a stamp.
Did you write that one yourself?
Yeah. It's really good.
I bet when Paul has a wank he has to use the whole duvet.
Yeah, I do.
What, and that's a good thing?
You're the inspiration for those little pens in Argos, aren't you, love?
Yeah, yeah, I was.
I was the inspiration for the little pens in Argos. Very funny.
So my dick's not as big as yours.
By about ten inches. Paul's dick's so long he can't wear shorts.
Ooh, that's funny, because he can't keep it in his trousers, either.
What? What? Steve.
What? What's that supposed to mean? Steve.
What, what's that supposed to mean, Becks?
He didn't mean anything by it.
Steve, what do you mean he can't keep his dick in his trousers?
Er, nothing, come on, let's go.
As you saying Paul can't keep his dick in his trousers?
No! I was joking.
Oh, you know me, I'm always joking.
Maybe you should learn to take a joke.
Now, Becks, how much do I owe you for that curry the other night?
Why did you lie about you and
Dan talking about the Spice Girls?
Sshh, I didn't!
Why were you talking about doing back-to-front with one of 'em?
What? You're crazy.
What's back-to-front? Were you doing back-to-front with a Spice Girl?
No, of course not.
It was a deal, weren't it, lamb and a naan, Â£5.50.
Steve, was he doing back to front with a Spice Girl?
Of course he wasn't doing back-to-front with a Spice Girl, whatever that is.
This is Paul, he works in Rymans, as if a Spice Girls going to want to do back-to-front with him. Fuck you.
But you are shagging someone.
I'm what. Sssh, sssh, Laura's upset.
Steve. Look why don't I pop out and get us all a mango?
Steve, stop being a prick.
Let Paul answer the question. Paul?
Where were you last night, Paul?
Tell me or you can have this ring back.
Oh, OK. OK.
Steve's got it all wrong, as usual.
I might not have stayed at Iggy's.
You liar.
I didn't want you worrying.
I ended up going, er, to... a museum.
Which museum?
Well, it was just a general museum,
Becky, and I bumped into a very nice young lady at the museum who happens to do some agency work as a Mel C look-alike. You bastard.
No, isn't it, Steve?
Yeah, the exhibits were so fascinating he stayed there all night.
You bastard!
Jesus, Steve. Oh, what have I done?
You're a little shit.
Mel C? I know. Mel fucking C.
Sshh, I know, I know.
What does the C even mean?
Chisholm. Chisholm?
Chisholm? Yeah. Chisholm.
Dan.
Hey, Steve, they were two for Â£1.50, let's hang out, eat 'em with spoons.
Steve, come here, you prick.
Oh, Paul, did you give her what she wanted?
What she really, really wanted? Not now, mate.
What's so good about Mel C?
Nothing.
There's nothing good about Mel C.
I've never liked their music, have I? No.
She did that one with Bryan Adams.
But you're right, we've never liked her.
I am so fucking enraged. Urggh.
Oh, fuck off as well, you little spider dick.
All right, how did you know I did back-to-front with her?
Did yer? What is it?
It's when, when first of all, you do her in the... what, you've never done back-to-front?
No, of course not.
You're like a fucking nun.
Right. Laura, let me in, darling, we need to talk.
Go away, Paul, I don't want to speak to you.
I'm not going anywhere, darling.
I believe it when I see it. Oh.
Don't do this to me, darling.
We have a bond.
You're my everything.
We're meant to be together.
Go away, Paul.
OK, you've got five seconds to let me in before
I kick the fucking door down!
What is that? Oh. Er, what is that...
Er, probably just let him, Becks.
I'm going fucking mental, darling!
Oh, mental, men...
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
I will smash the glass.
It stinks in here.
You total bastard!
I can't wait for the wedding.
I really need a piss.
How long they going to be? As long as they need.
Don't you dare.
Where's the spider?
I threw him out the window.
Very brave.
Someone's grown some balls.
Can I have the toast?
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.
Are you enjoying that toast?
Yeah, why?
No reason, I'm just glad you're enjoying it.
Thank you for allowing me to eat it in your bed.
Not at all, just glad you're enjoying it.
Mm, I am enjoying it.
Good, I'm glad you are.
Good.
Good.
Good.
I was up all night worrying about you. I was sick with worry.
Sweetheart, darling, you're so beautiful.
Don't tell me how well you fight, or how great your teacher is, or brag about your style.
Kungfu - two words.
Horizontal. Vertical.
Make a mistake - horizontal.
Stay standing and you win.
Isn't that right?
<THE GRANDMASTER>
We're from Foshan.
My father ran the family business.
He exported goods to Hong Kong.
The Ips have a long history in Foshan.
They named a street after us.
That's how wealthy we were.
Before I turned 40, life was easy.
I lived off my family money.
I had only one passion.
At seven, I started learning kungfu.
My master was Chan Wah-shun.
Foshan's Wing Chun began with Leung Jan.
I'm the third generation.
When I started, my master was seventy.
The day I became a disciple, he tied the sash himself.
This sash stands for school and teacher.
It stands for honor.
You are now a martial artist.
You must live your life with honor.
One sash, an unbroken tradition.
I lived through dynastic times, the early republic, warlords,
Japanese invasion and civil war.
Finally, I came to Hong Kong.
What kept me going was the martial arts code of honor.
My wife, Zhang Yongcheng, was the descendant of an Imperial Minister.
She was a woman of few words because she knew their power.
We understood each other well.
She loved music.
I'd take her to hear opera.
People were so conservative back then.
Nice women didn't visit places like this.
But gossip didn't bother her.
When I went out, she lit a lamp and left it lit till I came home.
If life has seasons, my first forty years were spring.
In 1936, Foshan was a prosperous city.
Life was peaceful and good.
Back then, men socialised in brothels.
Such places were popular in the South.
Foshan's finest was Republic House.
Its walls were covered in gold, so we called it the Gold Pavilion.
It was the first to have an elevator.
Enter a prince, exit a pauper.
You'd spend money like water.
It was like a social club for martial artists.
Good men can be found among rogues.
And hidden masters too.
People saw it as a pleasure palace.
But to us, it was a battleground.
I claim three accomplishments in life.
First, I united Xingyi and Bagua styles.
Second, I became the director of the Northern Martial Arts Union, bringing together Tongbei, Cannon Fist,
Tai Chi, Yan Qing and other schools.
Third, I took the northern masters south.
In 1929, the First Southern Martial Arts Academy was founded under my supervision after talks here in the Gold Pavilion.
I'm getting old.
It's time for new blood.
I held a retirement ceremony up North.
You invited me to hold a second one here.
It's my farewell to my southern comrades.
Up North, the one who took part was my top disciple, Ma San.
He'll be my successor.
Please give him your support.
I'd always wanted to take the southern styles north.
Sadly, my time's up.
I want to hold a demonstration match with a southern martial artist.
Someone you all support.
Pick one.
Think you're good enough to challenge the Old Master?
Let's keep it simple.
I'll take you all on.
Get him!
That at the ceremony up North,
I had the honor.
To worship at the feet of the Buddha first pass the Guardian of the Gate.
That's me.
How can I represent the South?
The southern schools are Hung, Lau, Choy, Lee, and Mok.
In rank, you are all my seniors.
You're the leaders and masters.
I have no standing.
The reputation of the South is at stake.
We Southerners may be petty, but we don't run away from a fight.
We're not afraid of these Northerners!
This is a challenge.
We will rise to it.
Isn't that right?
Absolutely!
It must be you.
I'll take the kids to my mother's.
Less for you to worry about.
When a man reaches forty, he needs to be sure of things.
When it's all over, come pick us up.
Do you know why a knife must have a sheath?
Its power lies not in sharpness, but in concealment.
You're too sharp a blade.
You have to stay put.
My sheath is you, Master.
With you around,
I'm under control.
I can no longer control you.
You're too anxious to make your mark.
For now, leave Foshan.
Miss that train,
and I'll break your legs.
Central News:
Southern armies marched north claiming for autonomy.
The Central Army blocked their advance.
The situation is explosive.
Halt!
Let us pass.
Sorry. This street is closed off.
No one bearing arms can enter.
Do you know who's in that rickshaw?
Call out the Gong Family disciples!
Miss Gong, it's good you're here.
He must call this off.
Win or lose, it's a disgrace.
My father has never lost.
There's no question of losing.
And so what if he wins?
They'll say he beat a nobody.
Ip Man's not at his level.
Where's my father?
Brother.
It's me, Baosen.
Isn't the Northeast big enough for you?
You had to come to Foshan? Get up.
I'm taking you home.
Home?
How's that possible?
The Japanese control the Northeast.
The Japanese flag
Won't wave OVBF me.
The time's not ripe.
Making soup like this is a lot of work.
It's not soup.
It's snake stew.
Isn't that a winter dish?
It's a dish from a long time ago.
Yes, decades. was a Snake Year.
You left the Northeast that year.
The fire has to be right for stew.
Too low - it'll lack taste.
Too high - it'll scald.
There's a lesson in that.
Go.
Wait till the fire can take this wood.
I'll go then.
The South may secede.
It's no time for diplomacy.
We're getting old.
Don't risk your reputation.
Ip is more than he appears to be.
Force it, things could go wrong.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm creating opportunity.
This fire today needs new wood.
Your northern colleagues disapprove of this match.
It's a huge honor.
This Ip doesn't deserve it.
It's not how things are done.
Don't follow the herd.
If the old never let go when will the young get their chance?
Ip Man has talent.
Let's see if he can prove himself.
The Gong Family has never lost before.
With you here, what right does he have?
I once had a temper like yours: winning was everything.
But life's bigger than that.
Take a longer view.
Past the mountains the world opens up.
Not to see the good in others, not to admit their talent, is to lack generosity.
Our high standards in martial arts apply to character as well.
Father, why did you bring me to a brothel?
If you don't see something, does it not exist?
No harm in seeing.
The first time I came here was before you were born.
Twenty years have passed in a flash.
In life, ability isn't everything.
Some thrive in light, others in shadow.
The times make us what we are.
I asked you to come South to bring things full circle and to let you see how I step down.
Since you were little, you've watched me fight.
This is the last time.
You're engaged to be married.
The Martial World is no longer your world.
Be a good doctor.
Live a peaceful life.
This is my greatest wish.
Master Ip.
We're here to celebrate.
Your big day is coming up.
We'd like to show you our support.
I'm humbled, Uncle Deng.
It's nothing at all.
Don't mention it.
Please.
On behalf of the ladies and staff, congratulations.
That's quite a battle formation.
Sister San heads our Peking Opera troupe.
She dabbles in Bagua.
She'd like to offer a few pointers.
Please.
After you.
Bagua is based on swordplay.
Single reverse palm is a single blade.
Double reverse palm is a double blade.
The feet are out and in.
There are 64 transformations.
Attack comes out of nowhere.
Sister San, it's just practice.
No need to smash the ancestral tablets.
I've done that many times before.
No big deal.
Mr Ip, Bagua is underhanded.
Beware.
Thank you.
Ah, Mr Ip.
Today is a happy day.
We in Accounts wish you well.
Xingyi began with General Yue Fei.
It uses the fist as a spear.
Drill
Chop
Cross
Blast
Crush
Such sensitivity - impressive!
That Crushing Fist is quite something.
Mr IP, each challenge leads to a higher peak.
Xingyi is brutal.
Don't underestimate it.
Let's see how high the peaks get.
Hmm. This will be fun.
My turn now, Master Ip.
And what have you got for me, Yong?
A string of firecrackers.
That move, isn't that Hung Gar?
I'm a jack of all trades.
You do mix it up.
What's wrong with that?
So long as it works.
The 64 Hands have endless combinations.
Your Wing Chun is a three-trick pony.
Spade, Pin, Sheath.
How can it compete?
Three's enough to take care of you.
Yong, your fireworks have fizzled.
What of it? I'm an old man.
Youth trumps skill.
He might be a grandmaster, but don't hold back.
You'd better win.
This has been a real privilege.
To victory!
Good luck.
Every generation produces new talent.
Mr Ip, we were fated to meet.
For my final contest
I suggest we match wits, not skill.
Do you accept?
As our guest, it's up to you.
When our Union was founded 25 years ago, a man came from the South.
He offered a challenge.
He held out a flat cake and asked our Master to break.
Our Master wasn't offended.
He even named the man our first chairman.
It wasn't because of his kungfu but what he said -
Kungfu divides into North and South.
Must the country divide as well?
That man was also from Foshan -
Ip Yun-biu.
He was a great man.
Today.
Meeting another Mr Ip,
I will ask that same question.
Mr IP, can you break this cake in my hand?
A Tai Chi master kept a bird from flying by giving it no perch from which to fly.
The Old Master's skill is too great.
Mr Ip is a sparrow in his palm.
I don't think he can do it.
The world is a big place.
Why limit it to North and South?
It holds you back.
To you, this cake is the country.
To me it's much more.
Break from what you know and you will know more.
If the Southern arts go far, what boundary is the North?
Would you agree?
Well said.
All my life, I've been the victor.
My technique has never failed me.
I never thought I'd see the limits of my own vision.
Mr IP, today I've made you famous.
In future, you'll face challenges at every step.
I hope you'll be like me.
Pass on the torch.
Never give up the faith.
Keep the light burning.
Miss Gong, you mustn't do this.
The Gongs have never been defeated.
I will redeem our honor.
Give this to Ip. He'll understand.
I have no chance to be as great as Father.
It wasn't my choice.
But I'll make my mark.
Go.
Tonight, following Northern custom, the winner will host a banquet.
Neither Ip Man nor I will attend.
You'll represent me.
Don't worry.
I'll do the right thing.
Let's go!
Of Master Gong's martial arts,
Ma San inherited the steel and his daughter the silk.
She is the sole heir to the 64 Hands.
Her moves are deadly.
In booking the whole place first, she forces your hand.
Don't underrate Gong Er.
The Martial World has four taboos: monks, Taoist priests, women and children.
Grappling with them is a bad idea.
She's gone to so much trouble - how could I not accept?
Three days ago, my father sat here.
Tonight, it's between us.
Please.
Pity about the lovely decor.
Kungfu is about precision.
If anything gets broken, you win.
Mr IP,
I showed you the 64 Hands so that you'd know the world is a big place.
Kungfu isn't just charging forward.
Look behind you as well.
I hope that's enough of a clue.
It went your way this time.
Who knows what next time will bring.
Come.
I'll be waiting.
Take care.
Does it fit?
Does Foshan get this cold?
You look lovely.
Let's take a family photo.
In October 1938, the Japanese invaded Foshan.
Their army took over our home.
If life has four seasons, we went from spring straight to winter.
I'll be back with dinner.
Help me prosper?
Rescue me from poverty?
I've never been poor in my life.
The country's in crisis and everyone is suffering.
To be poor is no big deal.
I'd rather starve than eat Japanese rice.
I won't collaborate.
I have plenty of friends.
They'll help me through.
Enjoy your dinner.
You won't find those friends here, only collaborators.
We had a dinner just now.
These are the leftovers.
If it's not beneath you, take them back to your family.
How can I accept?
Dirty money paid for it.
No point in waste. We're old friends.
You're most welcome.
They're brand new.
I was going to the Northeast.
But that's impossible now.
Sell them and I can feed my family.
Why is there a button missing?
Is there?
Must've dropped off.
I began studying kungfu at seven.
Before I turned forty,
I was never beaten.
When that happened,
It was life that dealt the blows.
In eight years of war
I lost everything.
Money.
Friends...
China will never die!
Girls obey their Madam.
Gangsters obey their boss.
Our boss was Sun Yat-sen
We followed his orders.
We Southerners have fire in our bellies and a sense of honour.
Only cowards fear the Japs.
I'll kill any I see!
Finally, I lost my family.
No one move!
Where are you going? Show your IDs!
Hurry.
IDS!
Where are you going? IDs!
Halt!
Do you remember what I taught you?
Yes.
Never put yourself first, show respect.
There's always someone better.
To yield is not to lose.
Master, you have taught me to be modest and know my place.
I took you in as an orphan.
You brought credit to our school.
Let's go over my supreme move.
The Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.
Have you practiced it?
Yes.
You know the key to it?
I was never told.
It's looking back in reflection.
It's not the upward move, but the turning back.
Understand what I'm saying?
A warrior molds himself to the times.
What if
I can't turn back?
Then the Gong Family legacy cannot live on in you.
Stay back.
Let him go.
Never darken my door again.
Get lost.
Master'.!
The whole clan heard you were coming and raced in from all over.
And Jiang?
He's keeping them company.
Miss Gong, they're awaiting your decision.
They didn't come all this way to hear my decision.
Did Father have any last words?
Don't seek vengeance.
Miss, your father forbade revenge.
I agree Ma San deserves to die.
It's a massive crime to betray one's teacher.
Nothing is worse.
On the other hand, it was your father who united Xingyi and Bagua.
Ma San worked hard at Xingyi.
And your father taught you the 64 Hands himself.
The two of you are his legacy.
If you stand together, the legacy remains whole.
Besides, if you take action, whatever the outcome, people will laugh.
They'll say what's this Gong school where the disciple kills the master, and the daughter kills her brother-in-arms?
A pack of wild animals?
Besides, as for Ma San, even your father couldn't finish him off.
You think you can?
Miss Gong, we're old men.
We made the long trip here with your best interests in mind.
Take our advice.
Just get married.
Your father's last words were Don't seek vengeance.
If you kill Ma San won't that go against his wishes?
My father said that out of love for me.
He wants me to have a peaceful life.
But if I don't avenge his death,
I'll never be at peace.
I understand what you're saying.
With respect, he treated you all like brothers.
After he died, you should've dealt with Ma San.
Instead you come here
as his messenger.
After all my father did for you!
I know
Ma San works for the Japanese.
He's got power.
But I'll stand up for my family.
Is he coming, or not?
What does it matter?
He comes, you go, and that's the end of it, right?
It's better to let it go, Miss Gong.
Some things are out of our hands.
It's the Will of Heaven.
Maybe I am the Will of Heaven.
Oh ye gods and spirits guide this soul to Paradise!
Halt!
We mustn't stop!
Don't block the road.
Keep to the side.
Move!
Ma San ordered us to escort the body.
Miss Gong,
Ma San's men are blocking the road.
The have banners of mourning.
Troublemakers!
Miss Gong, time is of the essence.
Jiang!
Tell Ma San he's a dead man.
Let's go!
Oh ye gods and spirits
...guide this soul to Paradise!
They're here.
Stop her.
Keep her back.
Let me at her.
Stop her.
Stay back. We're here for Ma San.
Since you're my senior,
I won't force my way in.
But know this.
You can't hide from me forever.
I will take back my family's legacy.
Come out!
Better to advance than to stop.
The Old Master taught me this.
It became my philosophy of life.
It's a shame he couldn't follow his own advice.
His precious teachings are mine now.
You want them - send a member of the family.
You'll be marrying out.
You don't count.
Don't ask after me.
No news means I'm gone.
Find someone else.
Miss, to give up such an ideal marriage - is it really worth it?
Think it over.
If you take those vows, you'll never be able to marry, teach, or have children.
There's no turning back.
Father, can you read what's in my heart?
If you agree with me, show me a flame before Buddha.
Better to advance than to stop.
He mocks us for having no successor.
I can only advance.
I can't stop.
Ever taught before, Master Ip?
To teach for a living is a new experience.
So why now?
I'm starting a new life.
You've got your things.
You're confident.
Saves running back and forth.
In Hong Kong no one knows Wing Chun.
Any special moves?
Not really.
Three basic hands - Spade, Pin, Sheath.
How many forms?
The Concept,
The Bridge, and Darting Fingers.
Weapons?
Double Knives and the Six-and-a-half Point Pole.
Anything else?
That's it.
Bone-setting, internal energy -
I don't do any of that.
Drifters, lion dancers -
I don't teach those types.
Why not?
Kungfu isn't a sideshow.
So I won't teach drifters.
Lion dancers jump at firecrackers.
They're always brawling and showing off, all for a bit of cash.
It's crude.
I'll ask you straight - ever been in a real fight?
It's wall-to-wall kungfu schools here.
They start fights over nothing.
Master Ip, have you got what it takes?
Try me and find out.
Fight! Fight!
I've had a few years of training.
Show me your stuff, Master Ip.
Have you had lunch?
Barbecued pork and rice.
I suggest you wait a bit.
It'd be a shame to waste it.
Waste it?
Brother Hung, are you okay?
Where's the tea?
Tea?
To give to your new master!
We've put a bed here for you.
I hope it'll do for now.
Sorry it's a bit shabby.
Is there a hammer?
Master Ip,
The boys and I want some lessons.
Eighty cents a head.
Cheap enough.
But call yourself a master, you'd better deliver the goods.
No snake oil.
How good's your kungfu, anyway?
Lock the gate.
Hey!
Little fucker.
Shut the door and it's on for real.
You've got two hands and two feet.
How you gonna beat us all?
You're mistaken.
I have two hands but
Wing Chun has eight kicks.
Never mind your boys.
There's more than enough for you.
More than enough for me?
That one's free.
First kick.
Fourth kick.
One more left.
Do you remember our oath?
What oath?
I vow with all my heart to be loyal and obedient to the Party.
I fear neither hardship nor sacrifice.
Should I forsake these vows,
I accept the harshest punishment.
Fuck.
The war is over.
This is Hong Kong.
But we stand by our code -
Join us alive.
Leave us dead.
I'm leaving now.
Can you stop me?
Try us and see.
You don't look like you need a doctor.
I'd like to see the 64 Hands again.
If you don't mind me saying -
You lost. I won.
Have a seat.
If you'd said that at the door,
I wouldn't have made it so easy for you to get your dumplings.
Thank you.
You know,
I'd hoped to visit the Northeast in 1937.
There was a challenge waiting for me.
I had a warm coat made.
But the war stopped me from going.
I didn't keep the coat, but I still have one of its buttons.
Call it a memento.
The 64 Hands is too important a legacy.
Why let it disappear?
In centuries of martial arts history, so many things have vanished.
Why should the Gong Family arts survive?
Mr IP, no art is higher than Heaven no gift more solid than Earth.
Nothing lasts forever and that's fine.
Keep this button.
As for what may and may not be seen, let's not talk about it now.
Mr Ip, ten years ago on New Year's eve do you know where I was?
Mr IP, may I have a word?
The Gong arts belong to the Gong family.
The 64 Hands aren't there just for show.
The Gong Family lives.
I know how much talent is there.
I'm keen to learn.
I'll be waiting.
People - they change with the times.
Wear shoes that suit the crossing, and underpants that fit your ass.
In Hong Kong,
I can only afford these cigarettes.
Back home,
I smoked real Manchurian tobacco.
Now that was smoking.
Be mild, good, respectful, thrifty, deferential.
Deferential is the key.
Let's say I'm smoking.
A stranger sits down.
I defer to him: Have a smoke.
Even if he doesn't smoke, he must accept or he'll make me lose face.
Mr IP, have a smoke.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You've got the gift.
Twenty years ago, we could have sparred.
What a shame.
Some work in the light, others in shadow.
The face of a school must be spotless.
Blood must flow only in the shadows.
If not, if it stains the face, then the school itself may perish.
The face offers the cigarettes.
The dirty work is done in the shadows.
Mr lp, you're too late.
Forget the 64 hands - you'll never see even one.
Is it hard to kill a man?
Miss Gong, it's not like in the old days.
Murder is punishable by death.
Is Ma San worth it?
We make our own path in life.
Should we go home, or keep waiting?
It's New Year's Eve.
He'll be here soon.
We have to wait.
All right.
We'll wait.
This is between Miss Gong and Ma San.
Everyone else stay out of it.
There you are, still playing with your monkey.
Deal with him!
Get him!
You're worse than a debt collector, trying to ruin my New Year's Eve.
The dumplings are in the pot, but you won't be eating them.
I let you off before to avoid destroying the Gong clan.
You should know when to give up.
Those needing salvation burn joss.
Those who are hungry, eat.
What I must do,
I will do and nothing can stop me.
The Gong Family legacy must return to me tonight.
Fine.
It's a part of me.
You want it - come and get it.
Master'.!
Keep away-
Ma San,
Speak!
That day, the Old Master spoke to me about his supreme move -
Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.
He said the key to the move was turning back.
At the time,
I didn't get it.
I thought he couldn't keep up with the times.
The Gong Family legacy
I return to you.
Let's be clear.
You didn't return it.
I took it back myself.
Miss Gong!
Miss Gong!
Sorry.
I miss my mom.
You got my notice about the memorial?
Yes.
Open a business, follow the rules.
It's the same everywhere.
Do you know how much weight a summons from me carries?
It's measured in gold.
Brother, I've got the money.
And I've got my life.
Whichever is worth more, take it.
I like those eyes of yours.
They remind me of my mom's.
Want both? Or just one?
Not so fast.
How about, you do the honors?
Forget it.
You're a real man.
It's the anniversary of my mom's death.
I'll leave you those two lamps of yours.
As the rivers flow, we'll meet again.
I'll take my leave.
Want the money - there're rules for that too.
What use are rules?
Keep it simple.
I stab you three times then you stab me.
How common.
Then raise the tone.
See that chair over there?
If I can't plant your ass there, keep the cash.
You're kidding, aren't you?
Brother, here's your prayer money.
Next time you'll be joining your mom.
Off you go.
To tell the truth,
Take me as a disciple!
Teach you?
It'd be a waste of my time.
That's speaking honestly too.
Just a few pointers?
In 1952, Gong Er stopped seeing patients.
Some say her old injury drove her to opium.
Others that she was obsessed with kungfu.
I last saw her at a teahouse.
Do you know this opera?
I think I heard it before in Foshan.
Something about a dream.
A Dream of Love.
Love is just that, a dream.
It's said
no instrument is as lovely as a voice.
Words always sound better sung.
Has Miss Gong studied opera?
Just the basics.
Back then if I'd put my mind to it,
I'd be an opera star.
All those tales, happy and sad...
If I tired of Yang Family Women Generals,
I'd sing Waking from a Dream.
Think of it - me on stage, you in the audience, meeting that way.
Wouldn't that be something?
But what if it was sold out?
You flatter me.
If you came, I'd save you a seat.
You've performed well in the opera of life.
You have both timing and skill.
Unfortunately, you never saw beyond your role.
I'd no idea you watched me like an opera.
This opera of mine, applauded or not, will play on to the end.
I asked you here to bring things to a close and say what needs to be said.
Are you going somewhere?
We have a saying in the North - a tiger never quits the mountain.
We've both been living on foreign soil.
I'm so very tired.
I want to go home.
But I wanted to return this to you first.
As for the 64 Hands,
I've already forgotten them.
I was lucky to meet you in my prime.
Sadly, my time is running out.
To say there are no regrets in life, is just to fool yourself.
How boring it would be without regrets.
Mr Ip, to tell you the truth,
I cared about you.
I don't mind telling you that.
It's not a crime to love.
But that's all it can ever be.
I never said that to anyone before.
Seeing you tonight,
I don't know why, it just came out.
Let's say we suspend this game of chess between us.
Take care.
In life, as in chess, a move once made stays on the board.
What we have is simply fate.
Your father once said, never give up the faith.
Keep the light burning.
I hope that one day
I'll see the 64 Hands once more.
My father said mastery had three stages - being, knowing.
Doing.
I know myself.
I've seen the world.
Sadly, I can't pass on what I know.
This is a road
I won't see to the end.
I hope you will.
Is this street of schools all the Martial World has come to be?
A great age offers a choice: stay or move on.
I choose to remain in my era, the times when I was happiest.
Tomorrow I take Miss Gong's coffin home.
She left this for you.
In imperial times I was an executioner.
The Republic left me out of a job.
Had Master Gong not taken me in,
I'd have landed in the gutter like a dog.
He never looked down on me.
He made me his daughter's guardian.
My fierceness would protect her.
He nicknamed me Lucky Star, so fortune would shine on her always.
For a woman, taking vows is a kind of death.
To avenge her father, she vowed never to marry or teach, to remain single her whole life.
She kept that vow.
These are the ashes from when she cut and burnt her hair.
She said she knew you a long time,
But you didn't really know her, nor she you.
Seeing these ashes, you'll understand her better.
Mr IP, the Gong Family is through.
Miss Gong belongs to you now.
Like her father,
Gong Er never lost a fight.
She only ever lost to herself. after the border to China is shut.
The day I left Foshan,
I wanted to say something but couldn't speak the words.
When I left her that time,
I thought I'd be able to return.
But it was the last time I saw her.
After that I only had the path ahead.
There was no turning back, and no road home.
Okay, begin.
Left fist out,
Palm open, turn the wrist, pull back, right fist.
Out, open.
Twist the wrist, pull back.
Mr IP, all encounters in this world are a kind of reunion.
They say I popularized Wing Chun.
I hope they're right.
I never did it for fame.
The martial arts belong to all.
We're all on the same quest.
It all comes down to those two words -
Horizontal. Vertical.

Yeah, mate, I said 30, you can't expect to get away with it like that.
Make a better deal or it's off.
OK? Well, I'll see you tomorrow then, ten o'clock, my place.
One forty-nine, please.
- How much is the milk?
- Forty-nine pence.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
One pound, please. Thank you.
Uh-uh. Too much.
Much too much butter.
I like butter.
Denis.
Mmm.
- Milk's gone up.
- Hm?
- 49p a pint.
- Good grief!
We'll have to economize.
I suppose we could always sell the car.
Or take in paying guests.
Watch out. She's on the prowl.
Eat your 699.
- Goodness! There you are.
- Yes. Here we are.
How did this happen?
How could she possibly have got out?
It's very, very important that the front door is left locked.
- Of course.
- Please, make it clear
- to whoever's on after you.
- Dixon.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to phone the station about this.
- Anything could have happened.
- I understand.
Maria, she's starting to clear her husband's cupboard, so...
- Mm-hm.
- I may need your help.
Can you bring up any cases that you can find in the basement?
Of course.
Mm!
Beautiful day.
- Mm...
- Oh, you've made a start.
Carol's coming soon,
I'll get some bags.
Anything you want to go to Mark,
I'll bring up a suitcase for it.
Uh-uh.
No, no, no, no. The grey.
- You sure?
- Mm...
Definitely the grey.
Righty oh. Boss knows best.
Don't let her take my paper away.
Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear.
Sorry.
Atta girl.
Ah! Damn!
- Damn it.
- Blot it.
- Blot it.
- Pardon?
You're supposed to be looking after her.
Now look what you've done.
Are they to keep the loonies out or you in?
Hm...
I'll be off then.
Wear your scarf.
There is a chill out there.
Good morning, Lady Thatcher.
Are you all right?
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine, thank you, Susie.
I've just been reading about the bombings.
- Of course. Frightful.
- Sorry-.
These are the books for you to sign.
I brought as many as I could find.
Shall we go through your appointments?
We said we'd go through them today.
Yes. Of course, dear. Today.
The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait.
I'll put that on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month.
I said no, because you have a concert that afternoon, but if you'd like to...
It looks like a very interesting program.
What are they playing?
Um, I think they said...
...Rodgers & Hammerstein.
Oh.
Oh...
Silly man.
Oh, he hasn't got his scarf on.
- Did someone cover the butter?
- I'll go.
- Leave it!
- Margaret.
Good girl.
Tomorrow, no matter what they do, it'll be business as usual.
Two of the small beef,
Mr. Roberts.
What is the life blood of any community?
It's business.
Not just big business, but small businesses, like mine.
Margaret! Cups!
We on this island are strong.
We're self-reliant. Sometimes, we're plain bloody-minded.
But we also believe in helping each other.
And I don't mean by state handouts.
Margaret, do you want to come to the pictures?
She's not coming out, she's got to study.
- Miss Hoity-Toity!
Never run with the crowd,
Margaret. Go your own way.
Go your own way.
Never run with the crowd.
Open it then.
I've got a place at Oxford.
Don't let me down, Margaret.
Mother!
My hands are still damp.
"Margaret Roberts."
Oh!
Tea.
- Margaret! Cups!
They're talking about you again.
Wha... What time is it?
Sun's not quite over the yardarm.
- It's time for tea.
- Look, Margaret.
What have you got on your head?
Found it in the cupboard, and thought, bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress?
- You look ridiculous.
- Boss lady no like?
No, Denis, boss lady no like.
She's made a start, that's the main thing.
No, no, no. It's going fine.
But it's taken Carol eight years to persuade her to let his things go.
Feet!
Well, it's her pills.
You can never be sure she's taking them.
I think sometimes she hides them.
Oh, rumbled!
They give her about an hour's clarity, then she slips again.
Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car?
- Sorry. It's always cash...
- Then take the sticker off!
I call that false advertising, wouldn't you?
- I've got another...
- I would say keep the change, but there isn't any change.
Hello, June. Any news?
Look, I brought every single bag
I could find.
He gave a speech recently, trying to come up with a broad base...
Hello, Ma.
Bloody taxi driver wouldn't take my card.
I said don't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash.
Oh! Can you believe it?
Rummaging around the bottom of my bag.
He didn't get a tip.
I didn't know that you were dropping by today, dear.
Yes, you said yesterday, we were going to start on Dad's things.
The cupboards, then I was going to help you dress.
- You've got Michael and...
- Jacqueline.
- Coming for dinner tonight.
- Yes, of course.
We're having halibut.
This is a major catastrophe that has struck our capital.
- As you can see...
- Isn't it terrible?
They think it's al-Qaeda.
...are trying to get all the people out of the building.
The Prime Minister and his senior staff were due to be staying at the hotel,
- but checked out earlier.
- Denis!
It'll be fine.
Come get your head down.
- It's ten to three, for God's sake.
- Denis!
At ten to three this morning, an explosion
extensively damaged the Grand Hotel in Brighton...
... Brighton, scene of the Conservative Party conference.
...the Prime Minister and a number of her Cabinet were staying.
They escaped unhurt, but it's reported that...
Five people have died,
many others are injured, some critically.
The IRA have claimed responsibility.
We must release a statement, offering our condolences.
I'm sure they've already...
We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists.
Is it warm in here?
Now, Ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight?
Oh, below the knee,
I should think.
No! Don't... Don't move those.
I haven't finished sorting.
I hear you went out today.
You mustn't go out on your own,
Mummy. We've talked about that.
There was no milk.
Call Robert, he'll get it for you if June's not up.
I am not for the knacker's yet.
Now, take it easy, Margaret.
- No one's saying that.
If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk, what is the world coming to?
Really, Carol.
Please don't fuss about it.
You've always been like this, fuss, fuss, fuss.
You must find something better to do with your time.
It's most unattractive in a woman.
When I was your age, the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother.
Four down, nine letters.
Something B, something T, something N...
Something, something, something.
Refusal to change course.
- Obstinate.
- What?
- I knew you'd get it.
Ob... I'll wear the pearls.
I'll wear the pearls.
There they are.
My little twins.
Thank you, dear.
It's nearly all familiar faces:
- William, Michael and his lovely wife.
- Jacqueline.
And then there's Peter,
James R, James T, and that very nice man we met last year.
- I remember.
- He's bringing his new lady friend, just to mix things up a bit, because we're rather short of women, but I'm sure we'll manage.
I've always preferred the company of men.
- Ma?
Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be chosen as our candidate for Parliament.
Well, I don't like coalitions,
I never have.
Start on the outside, work your way in.
Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words.
They'll be nationalizing the bloody air next.
Yes, hold your breath, sir.
That's government property.
Dreadful.
Was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts?
Oh, yes, to his core.
And Mayor of Grantham.
- And a grocer as well.
- Yes.
And did you help... in the...
- Oh, yes. It was a family business.
- ...shop?
A very good starting point for the political life, I'm sure.
That and a degree from Oxford.
No, don't. Whiskey, please.
What I do think is that a man should be encouraged
to stand on his own two feet.
Yes, we help people.
Of course we help people.
But for those that can do, they must just get up and do.
And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and do something about it, change things.
With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham...
Can serve very well for the people of Dartford, too.
- Really?
- I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income.
Just like the man or woman in the street, when I am short one week,
I have to make economies the next.
Nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility.
A man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping.
I'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need.
They see industry being nationalized, the unions on the up, the pound on the slide.
Whoever can sort that lot out, he's my man.
- Or woman?
Ladies, shall we?
Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.
Well. That's told us!
So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you'd been Prime Minister?
Where?
The bombings, Mummy.
Today.
We were just talking about them.
No... yes.
We have always lived alongside evil.
But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents along with it into oblivion.
Hear, hear.
Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age. Unimaginable.
The Prime Minister made a very good statement, I thought.
Yes. Clever man.
Quite a smoothie.
Miss Thatcher, it's been such a pleasure to meet you.
- You don't mind if I sit down.
- No, no.
I heard you speak at the conference in Brighton in 1984, just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.
You were remarkable.
I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you've been to women like myself.
Well, it used to be about trying to do something.
You see. Now, it's about trying to be someone.
- Mm. Anyway, I... thank you.
- Good night, Lady Thatcher.
- Good night to you.
I am so pleased to see your mother looking so well.
- Yes, doesn't she.
- She certainly does.
William, great to see you, thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
It was lovely, absolutely lovely.
- Can I call you a taxi?
- No, no...
OK, hold on to me, that's right.
Ah.
Better.
Do the clasp. I can't quite...
- OK.
Yes.
- Oh, you have an eyelash.
- Oh?
- Make a wish.
Oh, I spoke to Dr. Michael today.
He's very good. Very expensive.
I know you're not due to see him for another month, but I've spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow.
Just for a checkup.
Ma, please.
What does Mark think about it?
- Mark?
- Mm.
Tell him to come up.
I want to talk to him about this.
Mark's with Sarah and the children.
Well, tell him to come up and see me after he's kissed them good night, would you, Carol, darling?
He's not here, Mummy.
Mark lives in South Africa.
And you're not Prime Minister any more.
And Dad is, uh...
Dad is dead.
You look exhausted, dear.
You really must try to get some sleep.
Taxis will be few and far between at this hour.
Righty oh. Night-night, Ma.
Sleep well.
Good night, dear.
Twenty-four-year-old
Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid
to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life
into the Dartford
Conservative Association.
Winning candidate, Mr. Dodds, had better watch out.
This bright young woman is on his tail.
- Eat.
- Oh. Disaster.
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.
You shaved thousands off their majority. You did splendidly.
Not splendidly enough.
Ah, I see. Self-pity.
No one's saying you don't need a safe seat.
You deserve a safe seat.
But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little.
- What game?
- You're a grocer's daughter.
- And proud of being...
- And in their eyes...
...a single grocer's daughter.
But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman, then you'd get to Parliament.
And I'd get to be the happiest man in...
...wherever they select you.
Margaret, will you marry me?
Well?
Yes.
Yes!
- Oh...
- What?
I love you so much, but...
...I will never be one of those women, Denis, who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband.
Or remote and alone in the kitchen, doing the washing-up, for that matter.
We'll get a help for that.
No. One's life must matter, Denis.
Beyond all the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that.
I cannot die washing up a tea cup.
I mean it, Denis.
Say you understand.
That's why I want to marry you, my dear.
Oh.
Now eat.
Oh!
Oh...
There we go.
There they are, my little twins.
Oh... Mark.
Cornwall, wasn't it?
Bloody hell.
Look at 'em, little imps.
You never really got golf, did you'?
You look happy.
Yes, I do, don't I?
You're drinking too much.
Whatcha doing?
Not like you, looking back.
Don't want to dig around too deep, M, don't know what you might find.
You can rewind it, but you can't change it.
They grow up so fast, don't they?
Mark.
Oh...
Mr. Eric Deakins,
Labor, 13,437.
Mr. Ivan Spence, Liberal,
12,260.
- We won!
Mrs. Margaret Thatcher,
Conservative,
29,697.
I can now announce the new
Member of Parliament for Finchley,
- 1959...
- Come along, please!
...Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.
Please!
Mummy, don't go!
You promised! Hey! Mummy!
Wait, Mummy!
Please don't go!
No.
Oh!
Mrs. Thatcher.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Mrs. Thatcher, Airey Neave.
Welcome to the madhouse.
Follow me.
The Honorable Lady, the Member of Parliament for Finchley!
Order! Order!
The Right Honorable Lady, the Secretary of State for Education.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The Right Honorable Gentleman knows very well that we had no choice
- but to close the schools.
- Shame!
- Disgrace!
Because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy.
- Rubbish!
- Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating, no lighting in their classrooms.
And I ask the Right Honorable
Gentleman, whose fault is that?
Yours!
Methinks the Right Honorable
Lady doth screech too much.
And if she wants us to take her seriously, she must learn to calm down!
- Very good!
- If the Right Honorable Gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to what I am saying, rather than how I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself!
Why has... Why has this
Conservative government failed?
- It hasn't failed.
Why has it forced so many in the public sector
into taking strike action to save their own jobs?
Minister, the breakdown in essential public services, in transport, in electricity, in sanitation, is not the fault of the trade unions.
It's entirely the fault of the trade unions.
But of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve!
These power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise.
The miners are asking for a 35 percent increase in wages.
Obviously, we can't go anywhere near that.
The unions are not our enemies and never have been.
We want, and have always wanted, the broadest consensus.
- Hear, hear.
- I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation.
- Hear, hear, Prime Minister.
- The fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors.
Hear, hear.
- Yes, Education Secretary.
- Yes, Prime Minister.
With the miners' union leader today calling for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation.
Be patient.
They'll come back on again in a moment.
- Anybody got a shilling?
- Ah, Boy Scout.
Be prepared.
Thank you, Margaret.
Oh! It lives.
Your thoughts are duly noted.
Compromise, compromise, compromise...
We on this island are strong.
We're self-reliant.
Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers.
He meant it as an insult, but to me it's a compliment.
That's why he couldn't beat us, that's why Hitler can't beat us.
We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfill their own potential, especially the young.
There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be.
We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow.
It's 1974, you'd think it was World War II.
Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess.
Heath should resign now and make way
for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions.
I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head.
My driving instructor says
I should pass, but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons.
Which is ridiculous, isn't it?
- Maybe third time lucky.
- Right.
The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept.
Usually both.
One must be brave if one is to take the wheel.
- Right oh.
- Right, move.
Move to your right a little bit.
But if I move to the right, aren't
I on the wrong side of the road?
- Carol!
- Well, he's in the way!
- To the right. Move to the right!
- Hey! Look out!
So sorry! Terribly sorry!
Hey, look at me, driving!
Thanks, Ma, that was terrific!
I really feel like I've got a handle on it now.
You should have seen us, Pa.
Are you trying to cook your own breakfast?
- Denis!
- I can boil a bloody egg.
Mummy took me for a test drive.
We went absolutely everywhere.
All over the place.
- Yeah?
- I've decided. I'm going to run.
What for?
I'm going to run for Leader of the Party.
- Silly me!
- Good luck!
All the time I thought
I was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change!
- What's she on about?
- Her driving test this morning!
- Oh, right. Of course.
- Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister?
Oh! What I'm saying is that someone must force the point, someone must say the un-sayable.
None of these men have the guts.
- The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT.
But he's weak, and he's weakened the party.
One must know when to go.
You're shaking. Here, let me...
I can do it!
Goodness me!
What is the matter with everyone this morning?
I've told you what the matter is.
The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the doctor says I need a rest.
Do you need a rest?
Oh, God.
We both know it's highly unlikely that I would ever be elected leader.
I'll never be elected leader.
But I will run. I will run.
Just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which
- the Conservative Party must stand.
There's so much to do.
You're insufferable,
Margaret, do you know that?
Denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that.
- And it is my duty...
- Don't call it duty.
It's ambition that's gotten you this far. Ambition.
And the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to hell!
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Where did you go?
- South Africa.
- Yes.
How many days passed before you realized I'd gone?
Probably had to ask the cleaning woman where I was.
When did I lose track of everyone?
- Too busy climbing the greasy pole, MT.
- How did I...?
Mrs. Thatcher,
I understand you recently visited
- the United States of America.
- Oh, oh...
What is it you took away from your visit which may be of value,
- here in Great Britain?
- That's rather easy to answer.
They are unafraid of success.
We in Great Britain and in Europe
are formed mostly by our history.
They, on the other hand, are formed by their philosophy.
Not by what has been, but by what can be.
Oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes.
Oh, yes!
Well...
Uh...
For a start, that hat has got to go.
And the pearls.
In fact,
I think all hats may have to go.
You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife, and we've already got her vote.
You've got lovely hair, but we need to do something with it, to make it more...
- Important.
- Yes. Give it more impact.
But the main thing is your voice.
It's too high, and it has no authority.
Methinks the lady doth screech too much.
People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored.
Persuaded, yes. That "Oh, yes," at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader.
Quite.
It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr. Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader...
...would be like imagining,
I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid.
It's my background and my sex.
No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in,
I know I will never be truly one of them.
If I may say so, I think that's your trump card.
You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far.
It's really terribly exciting.
One simply has to maximize your appeal, bring out all your qualities, and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.
You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
Absolutely.
What... Prime Minister?
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.
In Britain?
There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No.
And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run, just to shake up the party.
Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree.
If you want to change this party, lead it.
If you want to change the country, lead it.
What we're talking about here today is surface.
What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are.
Never be anything other than yourself.
Leave us to do the rest.
Gentlemen, I am in your hands.
I may be persuaded to surrender the hat.
But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins, and, um, they are absolutely non-negotiable.
And...
Good, I think we can lose the handbag, Mrs. Thatcher. Yes?
And hands down by side.
Right up.
Because this isn't about the voice, it's about belief.
The very core. So a nice deep breath and really fill out against my hands.
You're calling Mr. Thatcher, how would you do that?
- Denis.
- Yes, I want authority.
- I want conviction, I want...
- Denis.
That's right, one more time, and breathing in. And...
Denis.
- Yes, M!
- Sorry. No, no, no.
You are the backbone of our nation!
Small firms like
Loveday's Ice Cream.
- So nice to meet you, ladies.
- Nice to meet you.
I'll just have a small one, because I'm watching my figure.
Whoo! That's for you, young man!
I passionately believe that it's the growth
of small businesses into larger ones
that is critical for Britain's future.
Well, it has to be something icy on a stick for Denis.
That's the only way that we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that sustain.
The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers.
Now it persecutes them.
It stops them from working.
It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees.
I say enough.
It's time to get up.
It's time to go to work.
It's time to put the "Great" back into Great Britain!
The incompetence of the Labor government...
- ...continue to misinform and spend in this incessant and blasé manner.
- We have paid the price...
- Mrs. Thatcher, they're ready for you.
- Thank you.
- Give 'em hell.
- You look magnificent.
Next stop, Prime Minister.
- Oh, Airey...
- Let's go.
The new leader of the Conservative Party,
- Margaret Thatcher!
Hm...
Good night, Margaret.
- Oh...
My money's on the filly to win.
Oh...
Thanks, Airey. Good night.
No!
No, no! No! Airey!
Ai Fey!
The Irish National
Liberation Army has claimed
responsibility for the death of MP Airey Neave,
Margaret Thatcher's spokesman on Northern Ireland.
If you want to change the party, lead it.
If you want to change the country, lead it.
You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
- Now, as the test draws near,
- I ask your help.
That together we can shake off the shackles of Socialism
and restore to greatness this country that we love...
And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win!
Is she gonna get there?
Watch those blocks rise...
Go, Maggie!
It's Friday the 4th of May, an historic day for Britain,
a Conservative government led by Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead...
Mrs. Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka, Mrs. Gandhi in India,
but never in the West has there ever been a woman Prime Minister.
The place that she has now secured in British history,
as the first woman ever to be invited to form a government.
The bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world,
Number 10 Downing Street.
This is it.
Steady the buffs, old girl.
- Good afternoon.
- Congratulations, Prime Minister.
- I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust placed in me by the British people today, and I will work hard every day
to live up to that responsibility.
And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St. Francis of Assisi.
Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.
Where there is error, may we bring truth.
Where there is doubt, may we bring faith.
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.
- Shoulders back, tummies in!
- Thank you, Michael.
Look this way, please.
Three, two, one.
Robert, could you bring the car around? She's been ready for ages.
I am perfectly healthy.
No need for any of this.
Just let them look under the bonnet, MT.
Make sure everything is hunky dory.
Oh, really, this is becoming quite tiresome.
- What is?
- You.
I was on my own for 24 years before I met you, and I can manage perfectly well without you now.
So will you please go away, and stop bothering me?
Just look straight ahead, straight at me, that's it.
- Are you noticing night sweats?
- No.
- Hallucinations?
- No.
- Sleep?
- Yes. I sleep.
Four, five hours a night.
So you wake early?
And I stay up late. I always have.
We just want to keep abreast of it, that's all.
Yes. Of course.
Grief is a very natural state.
My husband has been gone for years.
Cancer.
Carol says you've decided to let his things go. Probably a good thing.
Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam.
Perfectly good stuff.
People can use these things.
Hm...
Still, it must be a bit disorientating.
- You are bound to be feeling...
- What?
What am I "bound to be feeling"?
People don't think any more.
They feel.
"How are you feeling?"
"Oh, I don't feel comfortable."
"Oh, I'm so sorry, we, the group, we're feeling..."
Do you know, one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings than they do about thoughts and ideas?
Now, thoughts and ideas, that interests me.
Ask me what I am thinking.
What are you thinking, Margaret?
Watch your thoughts, for they become words.
Watch your words, for they become actions.
Watch your actions, for they become habits.
Watch your habits, for they become your character.
And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.
What we think, we become.
My father always said that.
And I think I am fine.
But I do so appreciate your kind concern.
Oh, do please answer that.
It might be someone who needs you.
I'll give Carol a quick ring, let her know we're back, and then I'll put your electric blanket on.
Steady, steady, steady!
Damn. Fore!
What about that medicine man, eh?
Ah. Cold supper.
Standards are slipping, Margaret.
You really gave it to that quack, didn't you, darling?
Just like the old days.
Hallucinations, my eye!
How dare he? But then, you give us all the runaround, don't you?
I know you can hear me, sweetheart, so there's no use pretending you can't.
Enough. Denis, enough!
Dismissed!
She does it in the end. Kills him.
I don't know why you're being so scratchy.
It's not as if you've got anyone else to talk to.
"When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride..."
It's a marvel to me that you can still quote whole chunks of Kipling, but try remembering the name of that woman who just made you that god-awful cold collation.
No? Come on, you can do it.
Month of the year.
One syllable.
Rhymes with moon.
- June.
- June! Bingo!
Knew you'd get there in the end.
"When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride, he shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside."
- "But the she-bear, thus accosted," rends the peasant tooth and nail,
"for the female of the species is more deadly than the male."
- "When Nag, the basking cobra, hears the careless foot of man..."
If I can't hear you, I can't see you.
If I can't see you, you're not here.
And if you're not here,
I'm not going mad.
I will not go mad.
I won't go mad...
I will not go mad...
I will not go mad. I will not.
Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit
to her doctors today.
Although rarely seen in public.
Britain's longest-serving
Prime Minister of the twentieth century,
remains a controversial figure.
Almost lovingly dubbed by the Soviets "The Iron Lady,"
she is credited, with her friend Ronald Reagan,
with a decisive role in the ending of the Cold War.
- Margaret...
- Her supporters claim she transformed
the British economy and reversed the country's post-war decline.
- I am so sorry.
- Her detractors blame
her savage public spending cuts and sweeping privatization of...
- I... don't recognize myself.
Hm...
Am I out of the doghouse yet?
Oh. They're unveiling that portrait of me at Number 10 next month.
Mm.
Yes, it's... the invitation, it's on the mantelpiece.
So it'll be Churchill,
Lloyd George and me.
- Just the three of us.
I said I didn't want any big fuss...
- No.
- ...but they insisted.
Lovely little article in The Telegraph.
"The Woman Who Changed the Face of History."
Huh...
Less than two years ago,
the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis...
Yes, and talked about bringing faith,
- hope, and harmony to this country.
Mm... Denis?
Can the Right Honorable Lady deny that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934...
- ...the biggest fall in total output in steel and coal production in one year since 1931
...and the biggest collapse in industrial production since 1921?!
- Order! Order!
Can she also accept that her free-market economics, designed to create a growing middle class, ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant?!
Out! Out! Out!
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!
- Out! Out! Out!
- Look at me!
Look at me!
You're supposed to be a mother!
You're not a mother, you're a monster!
You're a monster!
May we have a word,
Prime Minister?
Yes, but in order to arrive at the palace on time,
Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that door in 15 minutes.
- As you can see...
- I know you're running late, Margaret, but we have to address this situation in the light of tomorrow's blistering press coverage.
Blistering! The knives are out.
Your draft budget has been leaked, Geoffrey.
They are baying for our blood.
Michael, we can't possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty.
- No one is saying we have to buckle.
- But is this really the time to be making these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced?
- We need a plan of action, Margaret.
- Absolutely. A strategy.
- We must be armed.
- Agreed.
There's a perception, Margaret, rightly or wrongly, that we are now completely out of touch with the country.
Really.
How much is a pack of Lurpak?
- Lurpak?
- Butter, Francis.
Forty-two pence.
Anchor butter is 40 pence.
Flora margarine, still the cheapest, at 38p.
I can assure you
I am not out of touch.
- Sorry. I didn't hear you.
- What did you say?
- Nothing, Prime Minister. Nothing.
No, no, please.
Don't try to hide you opinions.
Goodness me, I'd much rather you were open and straightforward about them, instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press.
Well?
- Well...
- People can't pay their mortgages.
The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees.
Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes.
- It's terribly shameful.
- The point is, Prime Minister, we must moderate the pace...
If we even have a hope of winning the next election.
Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?
- Really.
- That's quite absurd.
Gentlemen, if we don't cut spending, we will be bankrupt.
Yes, the medicine is harsh, but the patient requires it in order to live.
Should we withhold the medicine?
No. We are not wrong.
We did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation.
The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy, and we will do just that.
Barring a failure of nerve.
Anything else?
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.
You have saved the day once again,
Crawfie. You're an angel.
You can't just close down a conversation because it's not what you wish to hear.
Oh, Geoffrey, I don't expect everyone to just sit there and agree with me.
But what kind of leader am I if I don't try to get my own way, do what I know to be right?
Yes. But, Margaret...
...one must be careful not to test one's colleagues' loyalties too far.
We are now one split nation,
with a huge gulf dividing the employed from the unemployed.
The Thatcher plan is to break the Trade Union Movement.
There must be closures of uneconomic coal mines.
We seek only an efficient industry.
The miners are being starved back to work, the need is desperate!
There are those who would say hold back,
there are those who would make us retreat, but we shall never give in to them.
We shall never waver, not for a second, in our determination to see this country prosper once again.
A car bomb has exploded outside Harrods department store,
killing six people and injuring 71.
Eleven soldiers died today when two bombs were detonated
during military parades in Hyde Park and Regent's Park.
Seven horses also died in the blast.
The IRA have claimed responsibility.
And now, it must be business as usual.
Come on, love, come to bed.
I don't know why you do this to yourself every year.
It's a speech at conference, not the Magna Carta.
Time to call it a day, darling.
It's ten to three, for God's sake.
Oh, I know, I'm coming, DT.
- Come on...
- Nearly there.
Denis!
Denis!
Oh, there you are.
Are you all right'?
My shoes!
That's when I thought I'd lost you.
Mark?
Hello, darling.
Oh... No. No, I'm fine.
I... I'm very well.
How... How is, uh...
...Sarah?
Yes, and the children?
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
That's a pity.
Well, I was hoping to see you.
Yes. Oh, no, that's fine.
Really, darling. That's fine.
Of course. Another time.
Yes, darling.
Yes. I can't wait. Lovely.
Yes.
Mark?
Mm...
Oh. Oh, dear.
That was Mark.
Not able to come.
That boy's always going AWOL.
Well, it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here.
There you go, making excuses for him.
Now look where it's got you.
Did you know that Yul Brynner was a gypsy from Vladivostok?
Yes. Yes, he moved to Paris when he was 14.
And he played the King of Siam
4,625 times on the London and Broadway stages.
- What are you doing?
- One likes to make an effort.
- A snifter?
- You're dead, Denis.
- Well, if I'm dead, who you talking to?
- Shall we dance?
- Oh.
Oh!
The Falkland Islands,
the British colony in the South Atlantic, has fallen.
Argentina claims its marines went ashore
as a spearhead this morning to capture key targets,
including the capital, Port Stanley.
Gentlemen, the Argentinean junta, which is a fascist gang, has invaded our sovereign territory.
This cannot be tolerated.
May I make plain my negotiating position:
I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs.
The Falkland Islands belong to Britain, and I want them back.
Gentlemen, I need you to tell me today if that is possible.
Possible... just, Prime Minister.
We can have a task force ready to sail in 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours. But?
- But...
We have a very narrow weather window.
We can't fight in winter down there, nobody can.
If we are going, we have to go now.
Why were the islands left without any naval protection?
In the last round of defense cuts, we judged the risk of invasion to be small.
Did we?
- And if you remember, Prime Minister, you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum.
Margaret, the cost of sending 28,000 men and a hundred ships 12,000 miles, almost to Argentina, will be absolutely crippling.
I don't think we should be worrying about money at this point, Geoffrey.
We can't afford to go to war.
We have to go now.
Now.
The government has now decided
that a large task force will sail,
as soon as all preparations are complete.
Prime Minister,
we do still have three weeks before our ships reach the islands.
All we're saying is that we shouldn't give up
on trying to find a diplomatic solution.
The US Secretary of State has arrived, Prime Minister.
So you are proposing to go to war over these islands.
They are thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically insignificant, if you'll excuse me.
Just like Hawaii... I imagine.
- I'm sorry? when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.
Did America go, cap in hand, and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms'?
Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles away from the mainland United States?
No! No! No!
We will stand on principle, or we will not stand at all.
But, Margaret, with all due respect, when one has been to war...
With all due respect, sir,
I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before.
This lot seem bound to do the same, but they will rue the day.
Now, shall I be mother?
Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?
Black or white?
The Argentinean ship the General Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course 273 degrees towards the Argentinean mainland.
We are tracking them with our submarine HMS Conqueror.
Is this ship a threat?
Both of these ships are carrying
Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.
Just yesterday, they launched, then aborted, an attack inside the exclusion zone.
There is a risk they could try it again.
The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands.
Can it really be regarded as a threat?
She's been changing course continually.
There's a strong possibility that they'll attempt a pincer movement on our carrier group.
I advise that we engage them.
Hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others, send them all back to port.
It'll play badly internationally.
We'll be seen as aggressors.
This will be an escalation,
Prime Minister.
If there is to be an escalation, it's better that we start it.
It is steaming away, Prime Minister.
Sink it.
HMS Sheffield, a Type 42 destroyer,
was attacked and hit late this afternoon by an Argentine missile.
It is seen as retaliation for the sinking of the General Belgrano,
in which over 300
Argentinean sailors died.
Prime Minister. The latest casualty figures from the Sheffield.
- I must write to them.
Prime Minister?
The families.
I must write to them.
A Type 21 frigate, HMS Ardent,
was hit by bombs and rockets.
Antelope went the way of the other two British ships
- lost so far...
- Foreign Secretary.
I've just been briefed by Admiral
Fieldhouse. He told me, bluntly, that if the Argentineans are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft, they have enough Exocet missiles to cripple most of our fleet.
President Reagan and President Belaunde of Peru have some new proposals...
...new proposals for the peace plan.
Peace plan?
There will be no appeasement.
This is a war.
It's a war they started, but by God, we will finish it.
Shall I tell you what I'm going to Write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families?
I'm going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain... for the Falklands.
Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
Captain Wood. Captain Dench.
As the only Prime Minister in the history of our country
who is also a mother with a son of my own,
I can imagine your agony, and your grief.
Prime Minister, we have secured the beachhead.
The Argentinean troops are demoralized and ill-equipped.
The paratroops have taken Goose Green.
Shortly after dark last night,
our forces surrounding Port Stanley carried out what the Commander in Chief
has described as a brilliant surprise night attack.
Thatcher, bed.
From their new positions, our forces can see
large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating
and streaming back into Port Stanley.
Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success.
- Well done, Margaret.
- Congratulations.
We congratulate the men and women
of our armed forces for their skill, bra very,
and loyalty to this country.
We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression, and we responded as we have responded in times past:
With unity, strength, and courage...
- ...sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed, in the end, right will prevail over wrong.
Hear, hear!
And I put it to the Right
Honorable Gentleman opposite that this is not a day for him to carp, find fault, demand inquiries.
They will happen,
I can assure him of that, for we have nothing to hide.
No. This is a day to put differences aside, to hold one's head high and take pride in being British.
Hear, hear!
Well done, Prime Minister.
Gotcha!
Well, that paid off, old girl!
Your ratings have soared, from the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation's darling.
The world at your feet, and Britain was back in business.
"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher")
The Berlin Wall has fallen. The gates have been opened!
The police are making no attempt...
I don't agree.
I don't agree in any measure.
Prime Minister, the question of the
European single currency will come up.
I don't think the country is ready for it yet.
But we cannot bury our heads in the sand...
A lot of Conservative
MP's and Ministers are saying that there must be a change in that style of management, that Mrs. Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in.
The point is, Prime Minister,
I don't think we can sell the idea of a tax
that asks everyone to pay the same.
Our policies may be unpopular,
but they are the right policies.
Prime Minister, I just don't think we can ask the poorest of the poor
to pay the same amount of tax as a multi-millionaire.
There you go again! Why not?
- Because...
- Because people, on the whole, think that the tax is manifestly unfair.
Nonsense. Errant nonsense.
This is a simple proposition.
If you live in this country, you must pay for the privilege.
Something, anything.
If you pay nothing, you care nothing.
What do you care where you throw your rubbish?
Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care?
It's not your problem, it's somebody else's problem.
It's the government's problem.
Your problem, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight.
No, you haven't had to fight hard for anything.
It's all been given to you, and you feel guilty about it.
Well, may I say, on behalf of those who have had to fight their way up, and who don't feel guilty about it, we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community.
And I see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union, cowardice, for the sovereignty of Britain, the integrity of the pound!
Some of you... want to make concessions.
Some of you want to make concessions.
I hear, some of you, agree with the latest French proposals.
Well, why don't you get on a boat to Calais? Hm?
Why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85 percent of your income to the French government!
Right.
What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session,
Lord President? And why have we not made more progress to date?
What is that?
Is that the timetable?
- I haven't seen that.
- It is, Prime Minister.
- May I see it?
- Yes, yes, of course.
The wording is sloppy here.
- And here.
- If you say so.
- I do say so.
- It's merely a first draft.
This is ridiculous. There are two "T's" in "committee."
Two "T's." Geoffrey, this is shameful. Shameful!
I can't even rely on you... for a simple timetable.
Are you unwell?
Yes, you are unwell.
Give me your pencil.
Give it to me!
If this is the best you can do,
I had better send you to hospital, and I shall do your job as well as my own and everyone else's.
Gentlemen, as the Lord President has chosen to come to Cabinet unprepared...
...I shall have to close the meeting.
Good morning.
Can't pay! Won't pay!
Can 't pay! Won't pay!
Geoffrey.
My letter of resignation.
Our differences, I'm afraid, cannot be reconciled.
I have done what I believe to be right
for my party and my country.
The time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I have myself wrestled...
Geoffrey's speech in the House of Commons was devastating.
He just couldn't take any more of the bullying.
He was almost inviting someone to challenge her for leadership of the party.
She behaved appallingly.
I wouldn't have spoken to my gamekeeper like that.
I don't think she can survive this.
I'm here to announce my decision to put my name forward
as leader of the Conservative Party.
I have nothing but admiration for our Prime Minister,
Margaret Thatcher, but I believe our party
and our country need a new leader.
It's extraordinary...
- I'm the Prime Minister.
...make it possible for Conservative MPs to depose
- a sitting Prime Minister.
- Sweetie.
He already has open support.
As Conservative MPs gather in Westminster to decide
who they will back in the leadership contest,
the Prime Minister said she would not be diverted
from critical international affairs.
Tonight in Paris, Mrs. Thatcher is among 34 world leaders who came here to celebrate the end of the Cold War
and to herald the start of a peaceful new age of East-West cooperation.
There's a general feeling that Mrs. Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot.
"We're going to put it to bed tomorrow night," is how one of her campaign staff puts it.
M, I think you should come home and defend yourself, old girl.
Heseltine is campaigning ferociously.
I do think my time is better spent
seeing an end to the Cold War.
Don't you?
After all this time, they know what I stand for.
Will she, or will she not, be in the job tomorrow?
Margaret, they can't touch you.
Mrs. Thatcher has failed to win enough votes
to secure an outright win in the leadership contest
and must now decide whether to put her name forward for the second round.
As Mrs. Thatcher leaves Paris for London to make
her last-ditch attempt to pull together support for her leadership,
the ship may have sailed.
Treachery!
We will never win another election led by that woman.
We need a leader who listens.
This isn't about her, it's about the party.
One must know when to go.
The question is, how does anyone put it to her?
If you were to stand, I, of course, would vote for you, Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, I, of course, would vote for you...
But I don't think you can win.
The loyalty of all of my colleagues...
It was the people who put me here.
The loyalty of all of my colleagues cannot be counted upon.
It's up to them to tell me when to go.
Margaret, you can't let them do this to you.
Please, boss.
They'll destroy you.
Throw in the towel now, love.
Don't let those bastards see you humiliated.
You just won't win, darling.
Not this time.
- Oh, Denis.
I am the Prime Minister.
Order! Order!
The Right Honorable
Gentleman is afraid.
This is their naked strategy of closing
some coal mines and then selling off...
They believe in striking,
I believe in working!
This is the woman who's watched ten men on hunger strike
starve themselves to death and never ﬂinched!
Despicable and cowardly.
- Cynical Falklands war...
- More homeowners,
- more shareowners, more savings...
- Showing to the bankers...
Yes, yes, yes!
I offer my resignation
after 11 and a half extraordinary years...
...proud to have left Britain in a much better state
than when we took office.
What's this then?
A radio.
How useful.
Steady, MT.
Mrs. Thatcher!
The greatest
Prime Minister since Churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies!
All those years of taking the tough decisions.
Does any of it matter now?
It's all been turned to mush!
- Hm?
- By these fools!
These lily-livered pinkos!
- These inept placaters.
Very good! These vacillators.
- Vacillators! Poll takers.
- Popularity seekers.
So busy taking the pulse of the public!
- Weak! Weak! Weak!
- These weak, weak...
- All of them, weak!
- ...weak men!
Don't they know if you take the tough decisions...
...yes, people will hate you today, but they'll thank you for generations.
Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish.
Oh!
All I wanted was to make a difference in the world.
And you did, love, you did.
Yes... Oh...
All I wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy,
happier than I was, certainly.
He kept all this.
Oh, yes.
And I wanted you to be happy, of course.
Were you happy, Denis?
Tell me the truth.
Denis?
Denis?
Denis?
Here's your bag.
All packed, sorted.
Denis, wait.
Where are your shoes?
You... You can't go without your shoes.
- Not yet.
- Steady.
Yes. Steady.
- Steady the buffs.
- Steady the buffs.
No. Not yet!
Denis! Wait!
I don't...
I said I don't want you to go yet.
Denis! Please!
Not... Don't... No.
I'm not...
I don't want to be on my own.
You're gonna be fine on your own, love.
You always have been.
Denis...
No, no, no!
Mummy.
- Good God!
- Mum, are you all right?
- Yes.
- What have you been doing?
Mummy, you should have called for help, silly old sausage.
Have you not even been in your bed properly? You've done all this?
Yes, it's all sorted. Finished.
Yes, well, don't worry about that.
June and I can crack on with it.
I was just going to get dressed.
Shall I call someone, see if anyone can come and do your hair?
No... You do it.
Right, I'm off, June.
Susie's going to drive me.
- Just loading the car.
- OK. Bye!
Oh, let me do that, Margaret.
No, dear, it's all right. I'll do it.
Carol said you might go to the House of Lords today?
- No, no. I'm not going anywhere.
Daddy!
Yes, Messaoud?
-The gendarmes!
-Where?
Oh, my God...
Said, stay close to me.
Good morning.
I have a court order.
This land belongs to Mr.
Guerini, your neighbour.
Mr Caid, this earth, I inherited it from my ancestors.
-Do you have a document of ownership?
-What document?
We've never had one.
-Without a document, there's nothing I can do.
You have to leave.
Impossible.
I was born on this land.
My father was born here.
My grandfather, my ancestors...
My children have grown up here!
You have three days to leave.
If I leave my land, how should I feed my children?
-It's the law, I can't do anything about it.
Have they gone mad?
We're chasing a piece of paper.
I will die and be buried here!
It's not fair!
It's a sin, what you're doing.
God damn you!
-Do not cry Mama, we will return.
It's nothing.
Go help your father, Said. Go.
-School is over.
-What?
Leave school?
I am among the best students.
This is not fair.
-How should I pay for it?
Remember that this land is ours.
It saw you being born and grow up.
Today, we hunt.
May God punish them.
Free Algeria!
Equal rights!
Free Algeria!
Equal rights!
-Come on forward.
-I have my match.
-Germany has lost.
We will win our freedom.
-Me, I earn my living.
-Said!
Remove the djellaba.
Come here, you.
Take good care, and don't be afraid.
Listen carefully.
If you lose, you shall not eat tonight.
Halim! Halim!
Equal Rights!
Dodge!
That gives!
Let go!
Take off your hand!
Don't do that! Stop!
Hide.
-Open, open!
The door!
Let me in.
Hide this.
Fire!
Now, go back home.
And most importantly, hide.
Is that clear?
Don't go out.
Save yourself!
Wait.
Save yourself!
Hands up!
Get out. Go.
Go!
Come on!
-Faster.
Daddy!
Dad!
Dad? Dad?
Get up, Dad.
Dad.
No, Dad, don't die.
Dad...
They're dead.
May God rest their souls.
May he give me strength and patience.
May he welcome them into his vast paradise.
My dear Messaoud
I hope my letter finds you alive.
I hope that this war in Indochina will end soon.
Your brother Abdelkader is in prison in France.
It has now been 8 years that
I haven't seen you.
Fortunately your brother,
Said, is always by my side.
This morning, we prayed at the tomb of your father and your sisters.
What is it?
My mother.
May God bless you, my very dear son.
Mr. Caid?
Mr. Caid.
What are you doing here?
I just came to say hello.
How did you get in?
I have a gift for you.
What's this gift?
Die!
I've come to avenge my father and my entire family.
Filthy dog.
Die, you filthy dog.
For everything you did.
Pack your things.
-Why?
We're going to France.
-I don't want to.
-We're at war.
They will kill us.
-If you think I am alive, you're wrong.
I'm already dead.
They've killed us.
Listen
Listen carefully.
Abdelkader is in jail.
He's alone in France.
He needs help.
-And Messaoud?
-He will join us, he's a soldier.
-In France?
-Sure.
God willing, we will all return here to our land, in our country.
But not to this foxhole.
I'll tell you... when I'm sure to find my children,
I'll follow you anywhere.
God will hear you.
My brothers,
I bid you farewell.
They're taking me.
Greet Algeria.
Greet my country.
Long live Algeria!
Come on.
In the name of the
French Republic,
I command the execution.
- The Vietnamese people broke the chains that had weighed on them for a century for their country to be independent.
Otmani...
Don't fall asleep.
Don't sleep.
-Colonial France is not invincible.
Don't give in to any illusions.
It's over, for your friend.
- The members of the oppressed nations must mobilise all their forces, and be willing to sacrifice their lives and their property to wrest from the colonial forces their right to be independent.
You, from African colonies, take for example the successful fight of the Vietnamese people.
Your brothers, your wives, your children deserve justice and freedom!
Fighters, don't be slaves sacrificed by the colonisers anymore.
See our victory and break your chain.
Here it is.
Come in.
Come on, Mum. Go in.
Thank you.
Listen, I have no money for now...
As soon as I find work...
I'll pay you.
Take this watch as security.
It is expensive.
It's good, it'll do.
-Don't worry, mum, it's temporary.
Thank God.
It's better than nothing.
At least we have a roof.
My brother...
Where are you going?
To work for Renault.
They're hiring.
What do you say?
Thanks.
Salaam aleikoum.
Salaam.
-May I sit down?
-Please.
-What can one buy with this?
-With that?
You can buy a house... and get married.
It can even buy you money.
You're new here?
I'm from Setif.
-From Setif?
Welcome, my brother.
Watch your things.
Think about marriage.
Sir...
Sir?
Hey, sir!
What's it like to live here?
You can be a slave for Renault.
-What do you do?
-Me?
I'm different.
-Teach me.
-For a guy like you that's a long way.
Forget it.
Excuse me...
Nothing is too hard for me.
I can surprise you.
Surprise me?
Come on.
Go.
Mum!
Are you okay?
I thank God.
Did you eat well?
Looks like you got thinner.
Don't worry about me.
-Listen closely to what I have to say.
You didn't steal.
You didn't kill.
You're not a criminal.
You're in jail for your ideas.
You are a man.
Everything has an end.
Soon, I will get out.
We'll be together.
If God wills it before you die and be buried by your side.
Fear not, my son.
Be a man.
Your son is a fighter.
Here comes the warden.
I'll leave you.
Remember what I said.
Be a man.
Abdelkader.
By taking care of you, you are taking care of me.
May God be with you.
May God bless you.
God bless you.
-That's her?
-Yes. That's her.
-Have you talked to her?
-Yes.
What did you tell her?
Good.
We're there.
Is that right, Bigalle?
-Pigalle.
Not with a B. With a P.
Otherwise, they'll laugh at you.
Come with me.
Sit down over there.
It will be your place.
Understood? And tomorrow, we share the money.
Good...
Go. Thank you.
Thanks.
Wait. Listen carefully.
One whore, not bad.
Two whores...
You're doing.
I'm hungry.
Yes, come on.
Good morning.
How did you do?
I will return the rest tonight.
Okay.
Take it, buy yourself some clothes.
-Even if I had to stay naked all my life
I wouldn't want your money.
God is my witness.
Zohra...
It's for my mother.
Don't tell her it's from me.
Said?
Messaoud?
My brother?
Messaoud!
Messaoud, my brother!
Where have you been, where were you?
You have become a man.
What else?
Come and see!
My son, my treasure!
I missed you.
And you, my son!
You've become a man.
You've lost weight.
He's a commander! Fantastic!
Your eyes...
-What's happened to them?
-That's war.
-Soon, Abdelkader will be out of jail.
You are the eldest.
You have to take care of the family.
I would have liked you to see your Dad before he died.
There's a girl right here, pleasant, intelligent.
If you like her, it relies on God.
Where's she from?
From our corner, just like us.
If God wills it.
If God wills it.
Abdelkader.
I have to talk to you.
You know, Ho Chi Minh... won the war against France thanks to two principles.
The first principle is that oppression always has its benefits to the cause of the people who want to liberate themselves.
The second principle, is to never, ever abandon a mission.
Nothing is insurmountable.
All Algerians, all of them must pay their toll for revolution.
Within two days, you will be free.
You must lead all
Algerians from the suburbs and also here in Paris.
-How?
You convince anyone.
??Him entrane 3 which entranent 6.
??The six entranent in ten.
I'll give you an address.
And remember it well.
You'll deliver your reports there and receive orders.
Okay?
-Count on me.
I will not betray the Algerians.
Let me, ma'am.
Abdelkader!
My life, my treasure, you're finally here!
I thank God.
Come my heart, let's go home.
-How are you, Mum?
-Good.
There it is.
Enjoy your meal.
And welcome.
This is the 1st time I'm eating meat.
I swear.
-He's kidding.
Said, I'm your brothers witness.
The neighbours show me the finger.
They say you're a villain.
Listen!
Mum was right.
If you're a villain, nobody respects you.
Bandit?
Who's the villain? Me?
In this country, either you have money, or you are worth nothing.
Your brother is free.
-I'll be free when my country will be.
We need to be free.
And everything needs to change.
What are you talking about?
With these workers?
Listen, now we're three.
Tomorrow we will rally the entire slum.
He's right.
Think of the victory of the Vietnamese.
They were more armed than them, it was useless.
They could have stayed
15 or 20 years.
They would have won.
The revolution is on.
Nothing will stop it.
Listen
I have thought it through.
I know how to make money.
It's easy. Listen to me.
You've been to Indochina.
You know the weapons.
You were in prison, you have become tough.
Three of us, we will scare anyone.
We will not stay in this misery for all our lives.
We will make our law.
Juror.
He must choose.
Whose side are you on?
Your brothers' or their enemy's?
My brothers?
That's you. Them, I don't know.
I'm not supporting the enemy.
Are you with me?
Messaoud?
Good luck.
I left the army.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
Zohra, bring the cake.
Now, block them.
Stop, wait.
My brothers. Listen.
Between the fighting and dying in this country.
You must join the FLN.
The FLN is for an armed struggle.
The FLN controls everything.
It hides in the underground.
The revolution, it's it.
The dialogue leads nowhere.
The French fake the elections.
No politics here.
Wake up.
Wake up, my brothers!
Remember! FLN!
-FLN!
-FLN!
The French fake the elections.
FLN!
-That's enough.
This morning, we were two.
And like this, we will always stay two.
Look at these pages, they are empty.
We will get there.
Patience.
-What are you looking at?
-You.
Why did you switch it off?
I'm talking to you!
All of you
Listen to me.
We must bring the war here.
Join the party that promotes armed struggle.
Listen, you.
The only legitimate party is the MNA.
Got it?
You're mistaken, my friend.
THE MNA will go nowhere.
The MNA has confidence in elections.
The French give us one vote against 10 for the settlers.
They tamper with elections.
It is through armed struggle that we will win.
Abdelkader!
Out!
Put him there.
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
So, you're FLN?
I want to hear you say:
Long live the MNA.
So, you're going to say:
Long live the MNA.
I want to hear it.
Teach him some manners.
Are you gonna say it or not?
??That way, you make the devil?
I'll show you.
Look at me carefully.
Are you ready to die?
Nobody will help you.
Get up!
I'll tell you one thing.
Don't ever set your foot in here again.
As long as I'm alive, there will be no FLN.
The boss, that's me.
You're lucky.
Next time you're dead.
Shut the door.
You have nothing?
No, okay. And you?
Okay.
They tapped you.
-It's okay.
It's nothing.
What are we gonna do?
Hey, brothers?
What do you want?
I'm on your side.
The FLN is right.
I received a letter from the government.
The FLN has gone underground.
I'm with you.
You know him?
No.
But we won one.
Hey.
You'll kill yourself with this.
Get out. Get out, sir.
You too, get out.
Quickly. You too.
Just like that, you're back.
You're not scared, you.
-"The accused denies the authority of the FLN,
-he publicly denies the necessity for armed struggle.
On behalf of the revolution,
-the accused is sentenced to death."
Sit down!
You've come in a great number.
Only, you wouldn't dare.
Go ahead.
Give me a and hold him.
Long live the MNA!
Cowards!
Son of a...
"The sentence was executed today at 3 pm."
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Colonel Faivre, DST.
This is my home here.
I make decisions.
The gooks will pay.
We'll go to the slum.
It's a battle
FLN - MNA.
You will get killed.
It should calm things down!
Congratulations, my brother.
Come on, you too.
I embrace you.
All my wishes of happiness.
-Police!
-Police, open up!
Get everyone out.
Police! Come here!
Police!
Police!
Outside, go!
My brother...
It's the police!
I have to go, sorry.
The police. We must go.
Don't move! Stop!
Police!
Go, police.
Go, turn around.
-Lift your arms.
-This is marriage.
Go, go!
Turn around.
Hurry! ??It drags it!
-I want ten.
-Turn around.
Take them.
Come here!
Go ahead!
Where are you going, you?
Catch him!
Quick!
Follow me! Come!
He must go! Hurry!
Where did you learn to fight?
-A gift from God.
-Really?
You want to work?
It's your lucky day. Run.
Did you know they would come?
You knew. The leader of the MNA.
You had everything planned?
Come on.
-For how long will you support this?
What do you expect?
That they'll burn your homes?
They don't respect anyone.
Neither your wives, nor your children.
You can change that.
It's your move.
You must prepare against these humiliations.
Do you understand?
Tobacco and alcohol are prohibited.
Paying taxes to France, that's collaborating.
You, advance. Your name?
Ali Benjbour.
I swear to devote my life to my country from this moment and until my death.
I congratulate you.
Advance.
Nordine-Salhi.
I swear to devote my life to my country until my death.
Thanks.
We helped you.
You got your place with Pigalle.
-That is true.
-You are associated in a cabaret.
Everything has to fund our cause.
You've given your word.
-I know.
I have not forgotten.
But you didn't speak to the Corsicans.
They've given me only 5 %.
What can I do?
Hadn't you said 15 %?
Listen, it's not very complicated.
I give you a part of the cabaret.
I want half.
-Half?
-Yes.
-Which half?
-What?
-Are you really serious?
And how am I supposed to live?
Said?
There's no discussion.
I said half.
You, advance.
Mum, do me a favour.
Agree to see Said, he needs it.
-I don't want that.
-Don't be stubborn.
It's your son. He's changed.
Take care of your wife instead.
She will give birth soon.
-It's Omar who stole the contributions.
-He has children.
A warning...
No, no and no!
Discipline.
No warning!
-When i was a prisoner,
I thought that if I got out,
I would never kill again.
-It only takes one disobedience or betrayal
I'm with you.
-I stole to buy a refrigerator.
It's not for me.
It's for children.
I'll sell it.
It's yours, take it.
It was me who wanted the fridge.
Forgive him.
I'm begging you.
-Don't be afraid.
I won't do it again.
Give me a second chance.
I have 3 children.
I won't do it again, I promise you.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Is everything okay?
-Are you alone?
-Yes.
-Come in.
Factories will explode all over France at the same time.
Without killing or injuring a civilian.
Do you understand?
-We will fight France on its territory.
He must find weapons and teach your men to use them.
The French want control.
We have to be ready.
-Organising a zone, that I can do.
But I don't know anything about weapons.
-The factory, to you, is over.
And the slums too.
You go into hiding.
I will make you false papers.
Okay.
You can go.
-Who's there?
-The white Algerian.
Come in.
Give me that.
That's 25 million.
Be careful.
There. Hold.
I'll accompany you.
-Thanks.
-It that a French serving the revolution?
Go ahead.
-That she drinks anything.
-Close the door.
Wait.
Go ahead.
It could be something else...
-It's a matter of Algerians.
It's their revolution.
I want to be involved more.
We do what they ask us to do.
That was fast. The money goes to
Switzerland tonight.
Messaoud, my brother!
Welcome.
So, are you all right?
-Yes, all right.
-Come on.
Make yourself comfortable.
-Request the envelope from Vincent.
-Yes.
So what do you say?
Account.
Okay.
Listen...
I've called it "The Casbah".
It's not a place for you.
You want to see my real place?
It's through there.
You'll see.
Welcome.
You have gained weight.
I don't recognise you anymore.
I took it out of the street.
Him this is my future.
I found him in the slum.
One day this guy...
He will be champion. You'll see!
What's his name?
I don't know yet.
I haven't found out.
He's the first Algerian who will knock out the whites and blacks.
If God wills it.
If God wills it. What do you think?
It's Said.
I'm proud of you.
Messaoud
Forget the war.
Come work with me.
I must go.
Said?
No Smoking.
You know it's prohibited.
Messaoud!
Where are you going with this war?
What did you watch me? Boxing!
And you want my picture?
Boxing or leaving!
I leave you all l.
Here, the key.
You can come to the show tonight or tomorrow.
All my time is taken.
You can leave.
I'll come back.
Returning to France and Paris
where there have been reported
a series of attacks.
These events are irrefutable proof
the FLN was able to create in France
an organization to carry out terrorist acts.
The FLN, with raging despair,
attempts to halt the peace in Algeria.
The government must take the measure of risk
that the fanatics pose
to the French territory.
For Algiers, these attacks are related to the referendum.
The spokesman Gal Salan
declared yesterday:
We can only hope
That the police have sufficient resources to cope.
And this, Mr. Papon
will report in
Paris is talking about-, 19 h 15,
and the log 20 h.
-What do you know about the attacks?
Eh?
Nothing, of course.
The FLN, you know?
The poor workers like you know anything.
Where's Mustapha?
I want to speak with both of them.
Can you swim?
Can you swim?
-The repression prevents our operation.
The police will end up in the organization.
We must react quickly.
Eliminate the cops who torture.
Maintain the initiative, strike up what the enemy is on the nerves.
For every blow received, we will deliver ten.
Your men are ready?
Yes.
If you kill police officers, the repression will be terrible.
-Our violence will be profitable.
We must infiltrate the police.
Of Algerians with important positions.
Look, here's a list of names.
I will travel.
Cairo, Tunis, Morocco.
You'll replace me.
You shall take your orders in Germany.
You'll be the height.
I will, inch'alla.
I know I will not see the
Independent Appraisal.
But I would sacrifice my life.
Salaam.
There he is.
Look.
That's the commissioner, he kills and tortures our activists.
It's impossible to kill him in the street.
It's risky for civilians.
Must enter the office. How?
Look.
The Algerians.
Those who did the war in Indochina.
Him, I knew well.
Otmani Yasser.
We were prisoners together.
He owes me life.
Really?
We'll contact him.
Look Daddy, look.
Your name's Otmani-Yasser, not Alain.
You are Algerian.
You're a police officer.
-Where are you from?
What do you want?
Listen.
If the French arrest you, they'll put you in jail.
They will kill you maybe.
But not your wife or your children.
The revolution needs you.
You have always been a traitor.
Today, I have come to give you a chance.
Think carefully.
Go on, push.
Courage, pray to God.
Go on, push.
Courage, fear not.
What is it?
A boy.
I'm not going home.
I cannot see my wife.
I have no life.
I'm lost.
I warned you: no family.
You, you feel nothing.
Nothing.
You have no feeling.
Where is our conscience?
Our soul?
Abdelkader... Our soul.
Today is Said's fight.
We gotta go.
I have to work.
You're coming.
Why doesn't he leave the left side?
You're the champion.
Scrap his mouth!
Who's the champion?
Good!
Out!
-It is the greatest champion of all!
That's when your next game?
-The next fight, the championship of France!
The championship of France!
Said
Your boxer he will not make the championship.
Is that a joke?
-He will not box for the enemy.
-Are you crazy?
He lost his head or what?
Wait.
First, we take care of our revolution.
Boxing, afterwards.
The revolution, I serve too.
If he wins, then Algeria wins.
Imagine, an Algerian
France champion!
This will be a great day. -No!
When an Algerian will be champion it shall be for Algeria.
-Your boxer should fight for Algeria.
Let the sport out of it!
No personal passions!
The whole person must be devoted to the party!
The cause is just!
Get it?
Why are you yelling?
This fight, I will.
Tell your party.
You've taken everything.
Boxing is my pride.
-That is treason!
Listen,
I will no longer be the shame of my mother.
Nobody can stop me.
Messaoud, nobody can stop me.
Said, it's an order.
If he fights for the enemy, he's a traitor.
-I do my fighting.
Do as you want.
Said, what is he worth, the kid from Algier if he has no hands?
Or eyes.
You understand that?
Go ahead, kill your brother.
Kill me if you're a man.
I will make my fight.
As you wish.
You're crazy.
You're crazy!
-If it continues, I can not do anything for him.
The revolution is a bulldozer.
It destroys everything
-How are you going to condemn?
-He disobeyed orders.
Brother or not
I'll come home.
You don't stop.
You shall not kill my brother.
Nobody shall!
Or, shoot, my brother. Shoot!
What happened to you?
You lost the head.
Thank you for all this.
This evening, you'll invite me to dinner.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You have to.
Otherwise, I'll stop delivering the bags of money.
Thanks.
Forget the revolution for an evening.
Here.
My brother is coming.
Why are not you married?
I have not met my soul mate.
-That's my brother.
You have to go.
Who's that? -Messaoud.
Goodbye.
A blonde?
What will others say?
-There's nothing between her and me.
Look.
Otmani gave me the plan of the office.
I also have invitations.
That's good.
You should take this.
It is loaded.
There are 5 rounds.
Release the safety clutch.
Good.
Invitation?
Here.
Lift your arms.
First floor. Wait there.
Commissioner Picot?
What do you want?
No, stop!
Give me that.
Go!
Stop!
Go! Go!
They had false papers.
Those who make them, they are connate.
The network.
-What are you doing?
-I was worried.
Worried about what?
Please don't come here anymore.
Don't come here!
It can be dangerous!
Don't come anymore!
"Long live the union for peace in Algeria."
French Communist Party.
You have not changed.
Paris without the Krauts.
-What are you doing, except smashing doors of honest citizens?
I am still myself. For France.
Colonel! It has been found!
Good job.
Thanks, you may remember.
Bush! We have enough. Go.
We must identify with this man.
This time we take something.
We have a face. Need a name.
Souni-Abdelkader, arrested
8 May 1945 in Sitif.
It is indeed the same.
He received his education in prison.
Hideouts identified.
On surveillance.
I want people to get their hands on this Abdelkader.
He grew up.
He's a little man.
He walks.
Thank God.
For him, I did a lot.
Good-night.
Oh! Officers, good evening.
How you doing?
You recognise this?
Your name's Souni.
You got friends in FLN?
Republic-Franaise.
I don't know.
You don't know.
No, Mr. Inspector.
I don't know the FLN.
I own a proper business.
You'll close. Security problems.
Son of a bitch.
What are we gonna do?
-We'll close, my boy Vincent.
We'll close.
-Ladies and gentlemen, we shut down for security reasons.
Drinks will be offered.
If you change your mind, alright.
-A cop called Faivre came to close the cabaret.
Beware of him.
He has your picture, Abdelkader.
Don't come over to my home anymore.
Is that clear?
Neither one nor the other.
As they say here: I'm not playing anymore.
Wait.
Faivre-
I know a Faivre.
Colonel Faivre.
From Dien Bien Phu.
Colonel?
Do you remember me?
2nd Class Souni,
Algerians sharpshooters,
Dien Bien Phu.
Camp 113, remember?
Get in the car.
Tell me, Colonel, are you ashamed of what you did?
No.
I've invited you here to give you a chance to redeem yourself.
I'm pleased to see you.
A man without reproach.
The assassinated cops had no family?
-I serve a just cause.
-Me too.
I am fighting for France.
She has to stay an empire in order to exist.
De Gaulle said that.
Me too, I'm a Gaullist.
How about if I told you it were justified that French are silenced by Algerians?
Replace Algerians and French with
French and Germans and it is 1941.
You're on the wrong side.
Unlike 10 years ago.
You would have been a good resistance.
I wish I would've had you.
You could give me information on the minister's instructions.
The resistance fighters now have all the honour.
It's not the same war.
There is a history between
France and Algeria.
Algerian workers were federated because a whole nation is angry.
For nothing, you think?
Give us a little time.
The Algerians will become citizens.
Progress is a war.
You can again be a hero, not a loser.
We are the same.
Yes. We are sacrifices, Faivre.
But you, the past.
Colonel
Colonel.
-One must fight terrorism with its own weapons.
For this, we will create a secret organization which will take the appearance of a criminal organization.
The Minister of Justice and the prefect guarantee us immunity in our actions.
It will be called
"The Red Hand".
Its objective: terrorize supporters of the FLN and kill its leaders.
-They want us to fit into their game
We will respond.
We will respond.
Mum...
Don't be afraid.
It's an early stage tuberculosis.
This disease will not kill me.
Not in this country.
Soon, I will get better.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Champion of the world. What?
World Champion!
The other one doesn't know boxing.
Let him come. Then hit.
How can I make one out of you?
Tell me!
Has he worked on his dodges?
-Yes.
He made you work on your dodging?
He's working on his dodges!
Yes
Yes, that's fine.
Listen
Very important.
I want to invest everything I have in a high level match.
First, he wins in France, then in Europe and and then America.
He'll write history, you'll see.
Hurry up.
Go!
Stop!
What is it?
Go!
That's enough!
Lift!
A unit of Harkis liquidated...
The apartments are being monitored?

-He's hosted somewhere.
We'll double the surveillance.
Him we will have, but we'll lose the war.
They will win.
-Messaoud, my son, here's my last will.
There is a bit of our land.
If we return to Algeria, we'll plant a vineyard.
If I die before, place it like this on my cheek.
You will not forget?
Don't worry.
We're going home.
Mum.
-Yes.
I don't want to lie to you.
I killed people.
I killed many.
With these hands.
I've constriction.
Mum. I've strangled.
I was forced to do so.
God is my witness.
So my son can have a better life.
Everything I've done, I've done for him.
Everything for him.
For a long time, I've known nothing but death.
I know nothing but death.
Forgive me, mum.
Yes?
Good evening. Good evening.
I'm going to Germany.
You must accompany me.

Okay.

Heinous crimes
Yes?

An Algerian has entered the theatre of Helene Legendre.
It's Abdelkader.
We have them.
Red Hand will take care of them.
A policy of social democracy wanted by the government.
That's what's worrying the separatists.
Pressed to act, they wanted their bloody night.
And yet they have only managed to strengthen our determination.
Helene! Helene!
That's good.
Pay him.
MP40-machine guns, 200 units.

God bless you.
Good luck.
In Paris, watch the curfew.
-See you soon, Messaoud.
-God bless you.
This is an American song.
It sucks.
They call that music?
Dance.
Dancing?
How does one dance to that?
That's good.
It's really a shame.
Shame.
I like that.
-I don't like it.
What are you doing here?
The curfew.
-It's for Algerians.
Not for Moroccans.
Your papers.
Follow us.
...greeted at the airport by the members of Parliament of Algeria,
the General was present the next day...
You're Algerian.
And Germany?
What are you going to do?
We know that the FLN is in Frankfurt.
- France could become an exporter of petrol...
The president: "We are sure that some of the energy from the ground
will ensure the industrial development of Algeria."
You want to tell me anything?
Well, you go back to the Harkis.
- In his speech, General de
Gaulle declared:
"The page of the battle has been turned
and page of progress and civilization, opened."
This goes beyond
the old partisan quarrels, the attacks.
There is light for everyone.
He has spoken. Valenciennes.
Hello?
-Your brothers have been turned in.
-Who is this?
- Otmani. I was in Indochina with your brother.
This isn't a trap.
Messaoud saved me.
Hereby, I pay my debt.
Where are they?
In Valenciennes.
Salaam aleikoum.
Are you ready? Mount.
Take up arms.
Go, go!
Machine guns on one side, ammunition on the other.

Explain to Mum and his wife that he didn't die for nothing but for justice.
The men are motivated.
Continue the fight against the police.
Abdelkader...
We need a demonstration.
A peaceful demonstration.
All Algerians.
Our weapon to arrange the independence.
-It will be a massacre.
The police will take revenge.
There will be deaths.
It's certain.
I agree.
But if the French government uses repression against us, it's in our interest.
Remember the international opinion.
The whole world will be watching us.
Abdelkader, this will serve our cause.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Abdelkader.
We need to organize this demonstration in Paris,
At October 17th.
But you will not participate.
For your brother, don't meddle.
There will be cops, at the match.
You can be recognized.
No recklessness.
Your brother, we'll take care.
The match should not take place.
You agree?
Yes.
May God help us.
Be careful.
Good evening.
How's the kid from Algiers?
Faster.
Who's the best?
The champion?
Me!
I already congratulate you.
There. Concentrate!
Said?
Said, come on.
Ah, my brother...

They want to kill you.
Cancel the match.
What's that you're saying?
They will kill you.
Stop the match.

This match, it's my life!
We don't have time!
Cancel the match, understand?

And you ask me to cancel?
But look, they are here.
Here, great.

It's not possible.
Has he gone mad?

Sit down.
Get dressed.
Get dressed? Why?
Because there will be no match.

Why can't I box?
Don't argue. There'll be no match.

Shorty. already passed!
Calm down!
As I told you, do not approach those monsters!
He could ...
Yura!
Stupid!
The Motherland hears,
The Motherland Knows,
Where your children
They fly in the clouds
With friendship,
And tender love, stars scarlet
Torres Muscovites,
The towers of the Kremlin -
She looks at you,
She looks at you.
The rocket exploded on the starting platform.
Fire in the fuel.
People died burned alive ...
The tragedy occurred by mechanical failures and human errors elementary!
You need to understand the risks.
- Sergey Pavlovich.
So changed the departure of the ship?
The casting of the rocket is not part of our office builder, but ... may be problems with supply of life and ejection.
Additional entries are needed before launching one of you to space.
- Can not you see the doctrine of "Sweat more in peace, less blood in battle"?
- What?
- Sergey Pavlovich, I mean, we need to prepare better!
- Why do we prepare?
The first space will be Americans!
- The rocket launch is scheduled for March, but it is factual that occur.
And then it will be a suborbital flight.
It will not last more than 15 minutes!
- We understand that, but how to explain to the whole world?
We can not play with them!
Send me I am ready to die for it!
- And you are the one who wants to be a hero in the country?
- Not the only one.
- All of you will prepare to fly!
- Sure everyone!
- I'm not ready!
- We do not need senseless loss of life.
Lenochka, as you seem to Daddy!
Tomorrow I can stick with it if you want.
What is this?
- Yura wants a boy, but I think it will be a girl again.
- How to be called?
- If it's a girl, then Galochka ...
- A good name spring.
- Lenochka, wants to have a baby sister?
- Girls, I just know ... a news!
- What?
- Valyushka, do not shake, right?
You do not need to be nervous.
- Lenochka, skirt, please go to your room.
Okay?
- Lenochka Okay, go.
- Say!
- Girls, I knew everything!
From twenty six chosen.
Kartashov have fragile blood vessels.
Now he has a bruise.
And Varlamov dislocated cervical spine ...
- Olya, right, who chose?
- And Yura?
- It's on the list ... Gherman was also listed.
- You need to think about how parabenizaremos.
- Do not you understand?
Any one of them will be sent to death sooner or later!
- And what do you propose?
- It is necessary to write, to Kamanin.
We, the wives ... want to be shipped on the first flight scientists.
For example, Bykovskiy ... or Nikolayev ...
Valya.
- I am personally opposed.
It seems to me that this is not right.
Ada, see, Gherman outlasted Bykovski!
- Yes, I know, we Gherman, just a little longer.
Just, stop!
Let's take it back!
Lift your head. Let's go to the stretcher.
That's all, retire shoes.
And the camouflage.
Okay, Gherman Stepanovich!
The result was in ten minutes better than Bykovski!
- You saw how he tried? Okay, Gherman!
It is more than visible. The man wants to go to space!
- Of course, Grisha, and who would not?
- Who does not?
- So far, it is the best result of the posting.
Two hours and six minutes!
Okay!
Okay!
- Ada Ravgadovna, Nelyubov is losing the pulse!
- And what are you looking at, huh?
- Stop! Open!
Come on! Come here.
Bring him here.
- Beware!
- Grisha!
Let's go. Exit!
Grisha!
Wait, wait ...
Come on, come on!
Come back to you, Grisha!
Grisha!
Yeah, well, he came to himself.
- How much?
- More than all, Grisha, two hours and eight minutes.
- That is, I'm the best?
- Grisha, wake up. I had to revive.
- It was nothing.
- You mean I'm not the first?
- You know, Grisha, not for us to decide.
- All we are the first.
- Spring is here Cedro not hear you.
Spring'm Cedro respond.
3 Daybreak, Daybreak 3, is the Cedar! Respond!
Dawn 3 am the Cedar, as are you listening?
- Understood! I hear very well.
How is the flight?
- The machine works well, continue the flight into orbit it follows normal!
- Hello, blonde!
- You're not blonde, is red.
- No. ..
I'm blonde.
Listen.
- We see how was the morning.
There are however two planes, bring them two young heroes, cosmonauts.
All smile because of them that are weary, no such joy that seems unbelievable ...
- I do not believe it!
- Wait, who was this? Has anyone made the flight?
No! Why not tell us anything?
- Silence!
- Where's the message from the government?
- This is ...
- "... from the crowd ... proud of our country, with love, with love and dedication, "
"look at these young heroes who inaugurated a new era"
"in the history of mankind."
- Good ...
"You just heard on the radio, reading lovers of fiction, "Prometheus", "Greetings from the future."
- A Reading ...
- If anyone had said we would find that ...
- Lyoshka, and I believed it!
Too bad it was not real!
I had been glad they came back.
- And you have no interest in going first?
- I want to, of course I do!
And I'd be happy to go to the end.
- I do not understand it, you want to be the first and ... rejoices over another.
- I do not know ...
- How do you know?
- I do not know, maybe you are not ready.
- How not ready?
- Let's make a choice and choose.
- But of course! Sure, Guera, come on!
And you set the table!
Mars bring a hat here!
Grisha, prepare the ballots.
- Please arrange a pencil.
- Well, young eagles!
Go fly a lot, confident ...
- Comrade Director, allow me to ask a question.
- Make!
- Let's fly to the space rocket or how?
- Iran in a capsule.
And you, young eagle, tell us about you.
- My name is Mars.
- Well, consider that Mars will be the hat!
Come on, the pieces of paper in the hat!
Everything, everything, everything!
- wrote?
- Yes, I voted!
- Hope, one to go.
Now is everything.
No more papers.
Well
Come on!
Titov Gherman Stepanovich! Parabenizemos!
- Thank you!
Rafikov Mars!
I know that letter!
Of course he voted for himself!
Gagarin!
Here only the first.
Gagarin ...
- Yurka!
Gagarin!
- Again Yurka.
Gagarin!
Stop, stop, stop!
Gagarin, hold louder, louder!
Good!
Well, let's continue ...
Touch cheerfully.
Stop playing, stop, stop!
Boys, each person must have a dream.
Look, I have a dream, which?
An accordion large and very beautiful!
Gagarin, and you have a dream?
- I have!
- What?
Well .. share.
- Talk to me, Dad.
I want to go to town, get a technical school.
- Take!
- There give uniform, coat, shoes, food and room scholarship ...
- What else?
- Power three times a day, giving bag.
- What to give?
- Purse, Money! Seven rubles a month.
- you. ..
When my father sent me to school he paid in cash, and in kind up!
It is well.
- But when was that, Dad?
- There's times.
Listen Yura, life is like a carpenter.
First the ax gives calluses, then at least then with another instrument shapes, then give you sandpaper, and the surface is smooth, without bumps.
Tell me, what is more beautiful?
This material or raw material?
- The result, of course!
- Yura, such as those therein, can make million.
But the raw material has its own character ... and his grace!
You already know what to do?
Will the same city?
The city?
Do you mind?
- I've decided!
- Go!
I presented a report still in September last year, the report was made in a day, and the night was a flight and then flight, and the twilight will occur behind the polar circle?
E. .. in the fall, in September will be like a fire.
As an atomic fire.
Or wings of an angel ...
And then I'll fly in a fire ...
I look up.
And there in the darkness of darkness ... are the stars.
And all this fire, tells me, you're the first to come here ...
I believed it.
- It was not God who said?
- No, of course.
But a voice ...
And the aviator believed in his voice.
- Yes
- believed.
But that's why you can not believe in the technique completely.
- And for whom?
- In itself!
- And if the voice is correct?
For thousands of years, people have looked at that sky and dreamed of reaching the stars.
Note, Yura!
At first glance the chaos ... but this is just chaos that is the code of harmony!
Somewhere in there is the mystery of our existence.
We integrate the universe, and try to give at least one step.
Mommy, what are those stars?
- They are light, sonny.
- Like a lamp or what?
- They also glow.
- Souls?
- Yes souls of the righteous, children without guilt.
- Why are they so beautiful?
- People say they are tears of God or dews of God.
So God was not with the Germans.
Hey, I did read that a cabin, that she might fly from here to the moon. Right?
- Yes, they did!
- But not needed, that fool would fly that far?
Do not need that kind of stuff.
To leave the family on Earth, and fly as far.
- Mama, do not send fools to space!
It is an advanced technique, do not trust the fools!
- And you will not fly, no?
- Mother, you know, I'm military.
Where is ordering me where I'm going!
- And how will Valya then?
- Valya.
And what has Valya?
She is a military wife.
Wife of an Airman.
You know what one looked like.
She understands everything.
Look, we walked all day in Moscow, could you push the button "Pause"?
Yes, I smoke ... A break!
There was no sound.
What?
Greetings!
- Hello!
You would chrysanthemums?
- Yes, of course.
My wife loves chrysanthemum.
- Please ...
Can I? How much?
60 kopecks, will lead? means that the final group is already set.
So, it will be the first ... and you stunt.
And I also reserve.
Grisha, do not you know that could change at any minute?
Until it is officially still a week away.
Why are you nervous?
It's ten days into the flight.
And play cat and mouse with us.
Not even trust us to steer the ship.
I kept some care!
Who do they need?
From a qualified pilot or a monkey pushing buttons?
- A monkey can not make manual piloting.
But you can!
If you trust the game to you, you will pave the way for space.
And you go to Kamanin and ask you to send into space instead of Gagarin!
What happened to you? Calm!
Get your hands off me.
Guys, what happened to you?
Why not go buy flowers for his wife?
Flowers? Now ... my love me no flowers!
But I'll buy!
What? You woke up.
Valyusha, allow me ...
Greetings!
Come on!
So.
What?
Glasisha.
What? Say!
Lenochka When you were born, you were afraid to even hold it.
We learned quickly.
We landed.
It's for you, not to miss.
Who will fly?
Do not know
Maybe I, maybe another.
- When?
- Day 14.
- It's everything. It's time.
- But please be careful.
Be careful.
- Valyushka take care of the girls.
- It's everything.
- Yura, promise me everything will be alright.
- It's everything.
If I understand correctly, the decision was taken and no objections.
The first to fly will be Gagarin.
- There is an objection.
Comrade Marshal, let me express my findings on this issue.
- Yes, please!
The issue is that both candidates are well prepared.
Their biographies are also almost spotless.
- Why "almost"? Both are peasants.
- Yes, Gagarin comes from Smolensk, peasant family, the mother works in a kol'hoz.
Gherman is the Altay, his father is a teacher in a village, in fact the name of his son is the hero of Pushkin in "The Queen of Spades".
- Yes, weird name.
- Yeah, but Titov is stronger, and physically and imposing.
- Comrade Marshal, I retreat.
- But what's the problem, he talked about?
- Sergey Pavlovich, I agree with you that for one second flight need someone stronger, would be more appropriate and cosmonaut Gherman Titov.
And I care even more with the psychological condition in adverse situations.
- Nikolay Petrovich, as a man can maintain consciousness even know if it's possible?
And there is something you know well.
More than that, there can be no 100% guarantee.
And your questions about the game can only make things worse.
If no specific objections, expose.
- All right, I will be concrete!
In all training exercises, Titov fared better and had many questions.
Gagarin sometimes showed doubts about their suitability.
- Specifically!
- Specifically: ejection.
And yet, on flights in the supposed landing site,
Gagarin said "be healthy lay here?"
There were other episodes.
- I understand. Regarding the ejection, he was great.
As to when in doubt, do not like it in Gagarin.
But that means taking things seriously!
And if you ask me, just born the second child of Gagarin,
It is a healthy person, and Titov, after all, lost a son recently.
And he wanted to hide this fact well know.
Fearing that this could influence the final decision.
We need cosmonaut tell us the whole truth on the back!
And so, one wonders, will influence the future of space travel!
- In times of war, Gagarin was in occupied territory!
- You know what? It's time to stop pre-Stalinist trials.
Comrades, we are in the face of a serious challenge.
Let's calm the nerves, huh?
What difference does it make which will be the first?
The main thing is that it is a Soviet man.
Words of gold.
Well ..
Hruschov liked the photograph of Gagarin.
Here the genius of Soviet man assaulted the heavens!
Fine words!
- This was our first win, Sputnik.
While I received my stars lieutenant heard on the radio and I was impressed so elusive!
- Indescribable ...
And then we discussed throughout the evening, when man will there?
See how the stars are.
It is men like you that all depends.
Sergey Pavlovich,
I will do everything to make sure the flight,
All right, how I learned!
You know what is written here?
People remember me in your prayers.
Written 600 years ago.
Do you remember us in 600 years?
- Is that important, Sergey Pavlovich?
- Yura, you believed?
- In what, Sergey Pavlovich?
Ensure that the technology will function in all stages there.
You put in orbit but to land can be a nuisance.
I understand!
Maybe the installation of stop do not stop ...
The apparatus fly at a speed of 8 km / s.
- That's right!
If the ship does not work using the sun as a guide,
Use the system of manual piloting.
The code is 125!
Understood, Sergei Pavlovich!
The pressure in the chamber is 1, 2 ... the parking system is 150.
How's the flight?
Understood, Spring!
The flight normally happens!
I'm in a good mood.
I still fly.
I find myself ... about America!
For the viewer see the stars through.
A look pretty! still flying over the Earth's surface.
Sergey Pavlovich!
Information ballistic report that the ship moved on 100Km.
- What does this mean?
- This means that if it does not stop mechanisms the ship will go into orbit ... and will stop at a point different from the atmosphere, in its normal orbit can only come back in a week and this way, you can only return within months.
And all the provisions and providing life only last 10 days.
- Gagarin know?
- No, do not!
But we can send the message.
- do not need!
There is no guarantee of an adequate response.
- par‰metos need the pressure of the DMP.
I'm the Alvorada 1, enter the parameters pressure of the DMP.
Moscow talking!
Moscow talking!
Running on all the radio stations of the Soviet Union!
Reviewing information from the TASS on the first flight of a human dimension in space!
On April 12, 1961, the Soviet Union put into orbit around the Earth, the first spacecraft, Vostok, with a man on board!
The pilot-cosmonaut aboard the Vostok-satellite is a citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics aviator Gagarin, Yuriy Alekseyevich!
And as said Tsiolkovskiy, the planet is the cradle of man, but you can not live forever in a cradle.
So I met with a specialist in space
I asked, is there a possibility that'll fly to space, at least in 10 years?
You know what he answered?
Yes, there is hope ...
Our man is in space!
Guys, we're in space!
Mommy, mommy!
Mom!
- What happened?
- Mom! Our Yura!
- What happened to Yura? Fell or what?
- Listen to the radio!
Yura is the rocket ... flying in space.
- And how is his wife? And their children? "
"... a citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"
"Major Gagarin aviator, Yuriy Alekseyevich"
"starting multistage rocket was successful ..."
- Where are you going, Mom?
- To Moscow to Valentina, and their children.
- Have you?
Gagarin's space!
- What happened?
- Our man is in space!
- Our man is in space!
We're in space!
ALL IN SPACE
- Girl, girl, come with us!
Do not stay here.
- Why?
Let's hope those in need.
- You is not know?
- We are the first in space!
Gagarin! The Aviator!
Come with us!
- And here?
- Come on!
Where are we running?
- Where do they go!
- And where do they go?
- Are you dizzy? Of course in Red Square!
Where else?
Girls, take me with you!
THE TRUTH
THE FUTURE OF MAN IN SPACE FLIGHT
Please, girls!
ALREADY FLEW!
- You knew Gagarin, locksmith?
- Gagarin, why?
- A certain Major Gagarin flew to the moon!
- To the moon?
- It was not his son ...?
- Major?
- Yes, major.
- This is my first lieutenant. Major ...
- Forgiveness, then went another.
- To get to my major there are many steps ...
- It's what I heard on the radio, "Major".
Attention! I see the earth's surface.
In illuminator right saw the sun rise.
The object rotates!
Noted that works well guidance system.
But now the display see the earth.
Sobrevando sea ...
The direction of motion of the sea can not be determined.
The "Spring" is on the line?
- Yes, Sergey Pavlovich!
- Tell inform the Cedar to get ready for the regime of manual piloting, if the DMP does not work in the next two minutes!
Yes!
Spring Spring'm Alvorada 1!
Cedar, gave you permission to prepare the manual piloting. Understood?
- Understood! Ready to manual piloting!
Sergey Pavlovich.
Kamanin is against informing Gagarin on the expulsion of the orbit.
- And what he knows about orbital mechanics?
Gagarin knows very well the manual piloting, he will do well.
The DMP work. normally.
The Cedar said, the DMP worked!
- Means that work automatically!
The next space will be us!
The journalists!
- Why you?
- Why we are the first to give the news.
- The next will be us, the doctors!
- Okay! Zoyka, come on!
- And now I will read my verse about space!
"In spruce forest twilight,
Refreshing Winds bring green
In a blue rocket thought,
And thought of flying to the stars "
Sergey Pavlovich, no separation.
There are stops. 132 meters per second, but perhaps not enough to separate part of the ship.
- I know that may not have been sufficient, and still says everything is normal.
I mean that everything should be normal!
- There is still a risky variant.
The system of reentry.
He's enjoying it!
I'm flying!
Flying!
He likes it!
Mom!
There is no sign of the orbit.
It means he entered the hostile atmosphere.
Maybe fall in the Mediterranean Sea, return to the same orbit, by territory already have ships!
There is a risk,
8000km to the territory of the USSR.
Communicate to all bases of the PVO, to scroll through the territory.
Sergey Pavlovich, First Secretary is on the line.
Tell him I'll call you in five minutes.
What is this?
Akademkogorodok, Nikita Sergeyevich.
And this?
A park, Nikita Sergeyevich.
And this?
Plates, Nikita Sergeyevich.
Sorry, comrades, can we go?
Do not worry, Nikita Sergeyevich.
Anyway, we are the first in orbit!
- We need him alive here!
I'll show it to the world.
Prepare the meeting so that they will remember for centuries.
PREPARE TO EJECT
Closer, you unsecured potatoes.
Let's get him healthy and alive!
Stop!
Stop.
Stop, I am one of yours!
Soviet!
The ship-satellite that carries the pilot-cosmonaut weighs 4725Kg.
Why gathered, boys?
It is a war or what?
- You bit his tongue?
A man flew through space.
Guys, this is Aleksey Ivanovich!
What? Are not you happy?
It was even your child!
Your son flew into space.
Just!
Just!
Yurka is in space.
Aleksey Ivanovich!
Aleksey Ivanovich, wait ...
Where are you going, Ivanovich?
Congratulations!
We're with you, Sergey Pavlovich!
Oleg Genrihovich!
Oleg Genrihovich!
Now, calm down! Take it easy!
Sergey Pavlovich three years so difficult!
It is as if my soul had been removed, only empty inside.
Everything is normal!
He landed, alive and well.
Just have in mind!
Do not touch the hands of the Cosmonaut!
Yes, yes, yes. Not hugging or kissing.
That's an order!
Respond head.
Get ready, Airman!
GLORY TO HERO COSMONAUT Gagarin
LEGEND: CRISTIANO ALVES
The space flight of Gagarin divided life into two parts. Until the flight, the pursuit of a dream and its realization, a dream of freedom.
Y. Gagarin reached the rank of Colonel of the Air Force, becoming director of preparation of cosmonauts. Died in 1968 on a test flight in MiG-15UTI. By the end of his days he dreamed with a second flight into space but the Party and the government of the USSR chose to spare him the flight, fearing to lose the living symbol of socialism.
Thanks to the family of the first cosmonaut:
VALENTINA GAGARINA Ivanovna, ELENA Yurevna GAGARINA,

{7832}{7879}So good, i almost|believed it myself.
{7879}{7948}I just got a confirmation|from the foreign office.
{7949}{7996}It's a yes for the washington trip.
{7997}{8064}- great! - meeting with the|chairman of the federal reserve,
{8064}{8123}reception at the british embassy-|- And clinton?
{8123}{8198}{y:i}A one-on-one with the man himself|in the oval office.
{8216}{8271}With the full white house|press corps in attendance.
{8272}{8347}But i thought leaders of the opposition|were meant to be kept at a distance
{8348}{8382}so as not to upset|the prime minister.
{8383}{8441}{y:i}- man: they are.|- So why the exception?
{8442}{8483}Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
{8484}{8538}They think you're going to win.
{8566}{8594}{y:i}Have you seen my blue shirt?
{8595}{8660}{y:i}- what? - have you seen|my blue shirt?
{8660}{8710}{y:i}I can't hear you!
{8711}{8760}Well, they'll have to go to|the court of appeals for that,
{8761}{8803}if they have the stomach for it.
{8803}{8851}- have you seen my blue shirt?|- Which blue shirt?
{8852}{8896}- the pale blue.|- Look in the basket.
{8896}{8964}Yeah, i'll see you at court 27.
{9006}{9067}If i put it in the basket,|why didn't she do it?
{9068}{9130}- take another shirt.|- I've already chosen my tie.
{9131}{9203}- then take another tie.|- I don't want to take another tie!
{9204}{9277}It's touching. i've not seen|you this nervous before.
{9278}{9330}- i'm not nervous.|- Then why are you snapping?
{9331}{9369}I'm not sna...
{9432}{9469}The last time you|went to washington,
{9470}{9536}i seem to remember a slightly|more casual attitude.
{9537}{9598}Last time i went to washington,|i met with clinton's advisors.
{9599}{9692}- to nick their ideas. - no, to seek|their advice on reshaping the party.
{9693}{9730}Reshaping yourself more like.
{9731}{9806}You came back clinton hair,|clinton suit...
{9807}{9863}Everything minus the|tarty girlfriend.
{9864}{9930}Why does his wife put up with...
{9954}{10022}Oh, tony, don't worry.
{10023}{10076}He'll love you.
{10152}{10198}Hopefully there'll be|somewhere in washington
{10199}{10250}i can get a bloody shirt done.
{10493}{10548}Good god. they're bringing us in
{10548}{10592}{y:i}through the northwest gate.
{10593}{10652}{y:i}- what does that mean?|- Man: it's the front door,
{10653}{10680}{y:i}the heads of state entrance.
{10681}{10743}As if you were already|prime minister.
{10801}{10856}- switch sides.|- Why?
{10857}{10903}They'll open the door on the left.
{10904}{10949}You have to get out first. come on.
{10985}{11059}For goodness' sake.
{11059}{11109}- well, help, alastair.|- Tony.
{11181}{11243}I hope nobody saw that.
{11270}{11352}{y:i}- alastair: comfy?|- Yes.
{11583}{11621}Thanks.
{11660}{11706}Good morning, sir.|Welcome to the white house.
{11707}{11746}Thank you. this is|alastair campbell...
{11747}{11777}- how do you do? - ...m|y press secretary,
{11778}{11809}and jonathan powell,|chief of staff.
{11810}{11871}Yes, we know.|Right this way, gentlemen.
{12001}{12040}First time in the white house?
{12041}{12102}- yes.|- Please tell me you're getting
{12103}{12154}- a kick out of this.|- Yes, thank you.
{12155}{12233}Potus is still in the|family residence right now.
{12234}{12313}- potus?|- President of the united states.
{12314}{12394}{y:i}Ah. -
{12395}{12464}{y:i}- - woman: heading|down the staircase.
{12464}{12517}Will we have one of those?
{12518}{12582}{y:i}On the ground floor now...
{12632}{12686}{y:i}into the colonnade.
{12756}{12815}Not bad. 15 minutes late.
{12815}{12879}You must be important.
{12880}{12924}{y:i}Okay, here we go, sir.
{12925}{12976}Straight ahead.
{13124}{13192}Be sure to ask him|about the moon rock.
{13386}{13424}Excellent.
{13652}{13732}{y:i}Bill clinton: i'm very glad we|had this chance to talk.
{13732}{13800}{y:i}I've always been straight with you, mr.|Ambassador,
{13801}{13887}{y:i}so when i tell you that we share the|concerns of the people of okinawa,
{13888}{13940}{y:i}i know that you'll believe me.
{14097}{14177}Secretary perry and i have|been talking through some ideas
{14178}{14257}that will safeguard our security|interests in the northern pacific,
{14258}{14322}as well as fulfill our|commitments to your people.
{14373}{14443}Japan has long been a|close security partner
{14443}{14501}with the united states and nothing,|i promise you,
{14502}{14544}is going to jeopardize that.
{14578}{14650}{y:i}Well, it's good talking|to you too.
{14693}{14758}- mr. blair.|- Tony, please.
{14759}{14816}Welcome to the white house.
{14817}{14898}I have been following your|career with great interest.
{14899}{14946}So you know we've taken|a page out of your book.
{14946}{15058}Quite a few pages, which i|consider to be a big compliment.
{15058}{15094}Have a seat.
{15094}{15189}You know, we keep a pretty|close eye on things over here,
{15190}{15262}and we think that the|smart money is on you...
{15263}{15354}And i thought a high-profile|visit with an american president
{15355}{15410}might just help you|across the finish line.
{15410}{15485}Because i believe you're|going to win by a landslide.
{15486}{15593}So what you've got to realize is|rhetoric can only get you so far.
{15594}{15640}You can talk your way into office
{15641}{15694}but you're not going to stay|there unless you can deliver
{15695}{15748}on the promise of your words.
{15749}{15808}Well, we've had 17 years|of conservative government,
{15809}{15913}during which the country's|veered wildly off course.
{15914}{15965}If labour does get in,
{15966}{16026}i'd like to make sure that|we stay in long enough
{16027}{16065}to get us back on the right track.
{16066}{16128}I think we're going to|enjoy working together.
{16129}{16205}Now don't get me wrong-|major's not all that bad.
{16205}{16243}He's been great on|northern ireland.
{16244}{16289}And when you're elected|it is my sincere hope
{16290}{16332}that you continue|the fight for peace.
{16333}{16398}Oh, peace in northern ireland|is at the top of my agenda.
{16399}{16450}I just don't think it's|reasonable in today's world
{16451}{16540}to carry on with|that kind of dispute.
{16541}{16592}If you need my help,|just pick up the phone.
{16593}{16640}Thanks, i will.
{16641}{16711}And don't be surprised if you feel|completely, totally overwhelmed
{16712}{16757}when you do get into office,
{16758}{16806}because in all that|time out on the road,
{16807}{16872}scrambling and fighting|to actually get that job,
{16872}{16936}no one briefs you on what|you do when you get there.
{16936}{16988}- - now you|seem a pretty quick study,
{16988}{17032}i bet you're going to|settle in just fine.
{17032}{17114}So we have a few minutes|before the press.
{17115}{17166}Did anyone around here
{17167}{17214}tell you to ask|about the moon rock?
{17215}{17271}Uh, they did, actually.
{17314}{17400}3.6 billion years old.
{17401}{17476}You know, sometimes when things|get stressful around here,
{17477}{17540}i just shut that door,|sit on the couch, hold that rock
{17541}{17637}and think, "we all just|gotta chill a little."
{17638}{17699}{y:i}a productive meeting, mr.|President?
{17700}{17780}Very. we discussed|a number of things
{17780}{17843}including the peace process|in northern ireland,
{17844}{17906}which is an article of faith|for me personally, as you know.
{17907}{17975}Do you think you've been talking to the|next prime minister of great britain?
{17976}{18043}Oh, come on. that's not|a diplomatic question.
{18084}{18124}Look. i just hope he's been talking
{18125}{18179}to the next president|of the united states.
{18223}{18283}{y:i}Tonight bill clinton|proves his title,
{18284}{18326}{y:i}"the comeback kid," after winning
{18327}{18389}{y:i}an historic second term|in the white house.
{18390}{18431}{y:i}Bill clinton is the first democrat
{18432}{18478}{y:i}to win re-election since|franklin delano roosevelt.
{18479}{18555}{y:i}- - man #2: a labour|prime minister in #10
{18556}{18616}{y:i}after 18 years of|conservative ruling.
{18616}{18687}{y:i}Man #3: this is a presidential|moment if ever there were one.
{18688}{18746}{y:i}Look at them grabbing at h with|pason in their faces.
{18747}{18786}{y:i}He's their man. what a moment.
{18787}{18831}{y:i}Let's just listen to the|sound for a second.
{18899}{18959}{y:i}Woman #2: tony blair and his|wife cherie led labour
{18960}{19031}{y:i}out of the wilderness and back|into downing street.
{19031}{19099}{y:i}Man #2: the new prime minister promised|to work for all the people.
{19100}{19167}{y:i}He said his government would|take practical measures
{19167}{19225}{y:i}in pursuit of noble causes.
{19226}{19286}Hey, good to see you.
{19287}{19324}- hello.|- How are you?
{19325}{19401}Tony, president chirac on the line.
{19402}{19455}{y:i}How do you want to do this?
{19455}{19499}{y:i}In english or french?
{19499}{19567}- does it matter?|- Well, he speaks fluent english,
{19568}{19603}as you know,
{19604}{19659}but my guess is he'll|start in french,
{19660}{19704}thinking it'll give|him the upper hand.
{19705}{19768}- - i think you|should stand your ground,
{19769}{19813}do this in english.
{19814}{19867}I'll be listening in.
{19868}{19923}{y:i}-
{19981}{20050}{y:i}hello. -
{20115}{20156}{y:i}thank you, jacques.
{20276}{20320}Let's hope so.
{20522}{20578}Well, i will do everything i can
{20579}{20615}{y:i}to live up to that.
{20616}{20688}{y:i}Tony. clinton, line two.
{20727}{20790}Uh, unfortunately, jacques,
{20791}{20840}i've got to go.
{20862}{20912}Sorry about......
{21020}{21070}Bill! how great of you to call.
{21071}{21110}{y:i}Please hold for the president
{21111}{21157}{y:i}of the united states of america.
{21158}{21211}{y:i}-|right.
{21305}{21377}- your call, mr. president.|- Thank you. excuse me.
{21377}{21425}Is this tony blair i'm speaking to
{21425}{21461}or the new dictator|of great britain?
{21461}{21537}{y:i}- congratulations, tony.|- Thank you.
{21538}{21642}{y:i}A majority of 179.|It's unbelievable.
{21643}{21690}I'm gonna make a|prediction right now
{21691}{21767}and say that the 2nd of may, 1997,
{21768}{21809}is the day that|progressive politics
{21809}{21874}became the default setting|in western democracies.
{21875}{21932}So that's your name in the|history books right there.
{21933}{21985}{y:i}And you won edgbaston...
{21986}{22035}{y:i}the first labour victory|there ever...
{22036}{22123}and wirral south.|Tony, it's sensational.
{22124}{22170}Hey, listen. i've gotta go,
{22171}{22233}but we're gonna see each|other in about a month.
{22234}{22299}- yes, indeed. - all right.|We'll catch up properly then.
{22300}{22366}Hey, why don't we have dinner|one night, the four of us?
{22367}{22404}Sherry and hillary too.
{22405}{22464}Uh, cherie. i'd love that.
{22465}{22543}{y:i}Okay, it's a date.|I'll let you pick the place.
{22544}{22577}We're easy. we'll eat anything.
{22578}{22636}Just no catfish or fried|green tomatoes, okay?
{22637}{22688}That's a promise.
{22689}{22731}{y:i}See ya.
{22874}{22920}Did we win edgbaston?
{22920}{22960}Yes.
{22992}{23035}And wirral south?
{23036}{23078}Apparently.
{23116}{23175}He's got no business knowing that.
{23175}{23221}That's just showing off.
{23222}{23308}{y:i}President clinton and first lady|hillary rodham clinton
{23309}{23388}{y:i}made a detour to london to pay a flying|visit to tony blair today.
{23389}{23459}{y:i}All the stops... - man:...|a pair of postwar baby boomers
{23460}{23520}{y:i}who came to power by moderating|the liberal tendencies
{23521}{23566}{y:i}of their respective|political parties.
{23567}{23619}{y:i}Man #2: the meetings will be|closely watched for signals
{23620}{23684}{y:i}as to what can be expected of the two men|who sm to have so much in common.
{23685}{23746}Are you sure i can't|offer you anything?
{23747}{23812}No, i'm good.
{23915}{24021}I suppose you know the awful term|"special relationship"?
{24022}{24081}It's something our foreign|office is always keen to promote.
{24082}{24155}Oh, i know it. every|country on earth claims it.
{24156}{24228}Although, in terms of actual|effect on u. s. foreign policy,
{24229}{24284}{y:i}israel, china, saudi arabia,
{24285}{24356}and the irish republic are|the ones who merit it.
{24382}{24445}Still, every now and again
{24446}{24505}a situation arises where...
{24543}{24600}Personal chemistry|between the two leaders...
{24601}{24680}As well as the shared language,|shared history...
{24681}{24775}Is such that it could|actually have some currency.
{24806}{24860}You think this is one|of those moments?
{24907}{24946}I do actually.
{25010}{25078}You have to ask yourself: all.
{25079}{25173}When did it last happen that|two guys on the same team,
{25174}{25239}found themselves with their|hands on the joystick like this?
{25240}{25293}It's a unique opportunity.
{25294}{25340}- yes, it is.|- We take away the bullshit,
{25341}{25399}{y:i}all the reasons that things|don't get done...
{25400}{25442}the same old excuses,|the same roadblocks
{25443}{25512}to progress that people have|been throwing up for years...
{25513}{25569}We could put right-wing politics
{25570}{25657}out of business for a generation.|Heck, maybe forever.
{25657}{25717}- the same with the old far left.|- Exactly.
{25717}{25778}Progressive, center-left|politics is the future.
{25779}{25827}What you're talking about is a...
{25828}{25872}Is a whole paradigm shift.
{25873}{25924}A new kind of politics|for the new millennium.
{25925}{25985}We build a global consensus|around our ideas,
{25986}{26029}there's nothing that|we can't tackle.
{26029}{26073}{y:i}I mean, you look at the facts:
{26074}{26142}I've got three more years,|then al gore...
{26143}{26179}That's eight years right there.
{26180}{26224}And then in europe,|you're just getting started.
{26225}{26268}There's persson in sweden,|schroeder in germany.
{26269}{26322}Beyond that, there's cardoso|in brazil. you're right.
{26323}{26377}People are ready for this
{26377}{26432}and we're on the|right side ohistory.
{26433}{26497}It's a sladunk.
{26547}{26608}He understands the|limitations of power,
{26609}{26637}of what can be accomplished,
{26638}{26688}he just refuses to|be limited by them.
{26689}{26768}He's a visionary, a true visionary.
{26769}{26842}Well, before you develop|too much of a crush,
{26843}{26899}it's also worth remembering|that this visionary is
{26900}{26956}also the first president|of the united states
{26956}{27009}to be up on a sexual|harassment charge.
{27010}{27052}No, if you'd been there,|if you'd heard him,
{27053}{27095}you'd understand, you know,|what this could mean
{27096}{27178}- for me, for all of us.|- Well, i wasn't there, was i?
{27179}{27229}I was out entertaining|the visionary's wife.
{27268}{27332}So how was it with the first lady?
{27333}{27379}Oh, fine...
{27380}{27435}Until on the way|back from the theatre
{27436}{27491}she let slip how big her staff is.
{27492}{27541}{y:i}She has her own policy advisors,
{27542}{27593}{y:i}her own chief of staff,
{27594}{27667}a bloody airplane at her disposal,|if you please!
{27667}{27743}Darling, would it help if i sent|jonath out to buy you a filofax?
{27744}{27791}Ha ha.
{27791}{27865}{y:i}- listening to her,|you realize...
{27866}{27925}{y:i}yeah, effectively,|it's a co-presidency.
{27926}{27983}{y:i}He takes her advice on everything.
{27984}{28050}{y:i}- i take yours.|- Oh, bollocks.
{28051}{28089}I mean, it's all|boys' town with you
{28090}{28149}with your jonathans, your alastairs
{28150}{28183}and your gordons.
{28184}{28230}You know, bill clinton|was once asked
{28231}{28304}who would he go to if there|was a crisis in the room.
{28305}{28360}He said his wife.|Now you'd never say that.
{28361}{28419}- yes, i would.|- Rubbish.
{28420}{28511}Whereas they're so tight,|such close collaborators,
{28512}{28581}{y:i}they're effectively running|that country together.
{28626}{28679}I think there's something|quite romantic about it.
{28719}{28798}{y:i}Do you know, when he was|governor of arkansas,
{28799}{28860}the staffers actually referred
{28861}{28926}to them as "biliary. "
{28927}{29018}biliary?
{29018}{29066}"terie"?
{29090}{29151}- "chony"?|- Tony, no no.
{29152}{29187}- you can't get me-|- You can't... - give us a kiss.
{29188}{29222}- no no no no.|- Give us a kiss.
{29222}{29264}Oh, stop it.
{29265}{29314}It's because we're such|tight collaborators.
{29392}{29433}{y:i}Well, that's a great strike...
{29434}{29479}{y:i}what did you get up to today?
{29480}{29570}I was taken to see the newly|renovated globe theatre
{29570}{29643}- by cherie blair.|- Oh, god.
{29644}{29714}What did you do to deserve that?
{29715}{29779}That's what we do,|the wives of great men.
{29780}{29846}Then we had some lunch,|just the two of us.
{29847}{29886}Did you swap stories?
{29887}{29963}Talking about tony and me?|All the things we do that drive you crazy?
{29964}{30005}Your names came up.
{30030}{30072}She ask your advice?
{30073}{30122}I told her to shield her children
{30123}{30170}from the tabloid spotlight|as much as possible
{30171}{30206}and to try to be herself,
{30207}{30274}both of which she will|discover are impossible.
{30275}{30330}She's in kind of a tough spot
{30331}{30386}and she doesn't get much help,|which she whined about a bit.
{30387}{30423}{y:i}That's just the working class.
{30424}{30482}You know she's from liverpool?
{30482}{30554}It's the arkansas of england.
{30554}{30613}She obviously adores him though.
{30614}{30694}Well, he's quite a catch.
{30694}{30744}It's not often you see that.
{30745}{30785}What?
{30786}{30873}{y:i}A couple where the husband is more|attractive than the wife.
{30902}{30960}{y:i}- he is handsome. - blair?|You think so?
{30961}{31026}- well, you don't?|- He's got charm, i guess,
{31026}{31114}but there's something about him.|He's too perfect.
{31146}{31240}So you prefer your man imperfect?
{31241}{31318}{y:i}'cause i hate to disappoint you,|hon,
{31319}{31366}but my mama told me a million times
{31367}{31426}- that i'm just too good to be true.|- Yeah, right.
{31464}{31534}Is there ever a moment when|you're not stuffing that thing?
{31670}{31750}So you continue to practice?|You're not giving up the law?
{31751}{31802}Oh, no, never. i mean,|that's if anyone will bring me cases
{31803}{31849}- now that tony is in #10.|- Oh, that's right.
{31850}{31916}{y:i}- blame it on me. - what did|your predecessor do?
{31917}{31961}{y:i}- norma major?|- Tony: she wrote a book.
{31962}{32014}Oh! umm...
{32015}{32066}The prime minister's country house
{32067}{32106}- and its history. " - perfect.
{32106}{32176}Cherie's going to do one about|downing street. don't laugh.
{32177}{32276}- tony. - can i offer one|piece of serious advice?
{32277}{32335}- if it's not too presumptuous...|- Oh, here we go.
{32336}{32382}- ...or self-aggrandizing?|- Can i make a disclaimer here?
{32383}{32425}- please, feel free to ignore him.|- No. please.
{32426}{32475}- i'd like to hear it.|- Hit the ground running.
{32476}{32521}Now we got off to a bad start,
{32522}{32577}and it's taken us|four years to recover.
{32578}{32630}The other thing is|to start thinking now
{32630}{32678}about what you want|your legacy to be.
{32678}{32721}I've been in office|less than a month,
{32722}{32773}- and you want me to work out my legacy?|- No no no, bill's right.
{32774}{32841}Because if you don't do it,|other people will do it for you.
{32842}{32911}Legacy is reductive. people tend|to remember you for one thing.
{32912}{33009}{y:i}You have to make sure you get ahead|and define what that is.
{33009}{33041}And if you decide|to take up a cause,
{33042}{33100}{y:i}make sure it isn't healthcare.
{33101}{33150}{y:i}And if someone in your first|press conference
{33151}{33197}asks you about gays|in the military,
{33198}{33249}you say nothing!
{33409}{33462}{y:i}People often ask me
{33463}{33507}{y:i}if i'm exhilarated
{33508}{33552}{y:i}by our election victory.
{33553}{33594}{y:i}Of course i'm excited about it,
{33595}{33685}{y:i}but i feel an equally profound|sense of responsibility
{33685}{33735}{y:i}i feel it...
{33736}{33805}{y:i}...perhaps especially about here...
{33806}{33845}{y:i}northern ireland.
{33846}{33924}{y:i}This is not a party|political game.
{33925}{33976}{y:i}It is about life and death|for the people here.
{33977}{34042}{y:i}The people of northern ireland
{34043}{34155}{y:i}have stood up to terrorist|violence for 25 years.
{34156}{34212}{y:i}They have not been|destroyed by it,
{34213}{34303}{y:i}but the legacy of bitterness
{34304}{34370}{y:i}has made the normal political|give and take
{34371}{34428}{y:i}virtually impossible.
{34428}{34534}The i.r.a. and sinn|fein have a choice
{34535}{34606}between negotiations
{34607}{34666}and violence.
{34667}{34758}My message to sinn fein is clear:
{34803}{34879}The settlement train is leaving.
{34909}{34960}I want you on that train,
{34989}{35036}but it is leaving anyway.
{35066}{35143}And i will not allow|it to wait for you.
{35144}{35215}Thank you very much.
{35243}{35293}Thank you very much.
{35294}{35344}{y:i}The search for peace in|northern ireland
{35345}{35390}{y:i}was dealt a devastating blow today
{35391}{35449}{y:i}when the ira murdered two|police officers.
{35450}{35528}{y:i}Two ira gunmen caught them|in a side street.
{35528}{35571}{y:i}It's believed they came|up behind them
{35572}{35654}{y:i}and fired a number of shots into|their heads at close range.
{35655}{35706}{y:i}Man #2: all this after sinn fã©in
{35707}{35761}{y:i}attacked tony blair's|impassioned ultimatum
{35762}{35811}{y:i}for peace as pro-unionist.
{35812}{35861}{y:i}Man #3: gerry adams,|told about the shootings
{35862}{35919}{y:i}at a book signg, said that|on a personal level
{35920}{36024}{y:i}he was shocked but reluctant to comment|on the political fallout.
{36084}{36120}{y:i}How could they do that?
{36121}{36202}{y:i}I merely suggest they enter talks
{36202}{36249}and they kill two people.
{36250}{36315}I mean, maybe i went too far.
{36316}{36380}You said what had to be said
{36381}{36425}and they heard it...
{36425}{36476}The men who murdered those cops.
{36477}{36541}{y:i}That's why they did what they did.
{36541}{36609}{y:i}They're scared. they're scared,
{36609}{36710}{y:i}because after all the decades|of endless back and forth
{36711}{36777}and false starts there's|finally a man in downing street
{36778}{36827}who's not going to put up|with their bullshit anymore.
{36828}{36864}{y:i}Gerry adams assured me
{36865}{36936}that he was ready to|push for a ceasefire,
{36937}{36996}so that sinn fein|could join the talks.
{36996}{37064}{y:i}He knew what i was going to say.
{37065}{37146}And then this, and he says nothing.
{37147}{37180}{y:i}Nothing.
{37181}{37235}Not a word against the|people who killed those men.
{37236}{37269}{y:i}Well, how can i help?
{37270}{37312}{y:i}Do you want me to make|a statement?
{37312}{37360}Well, your advisors|will tell you that
{37360}{37427}there's no mileage in|you involving yourself
{37428}{37472}in the domestic|problems of the u.k.
{37472}{37555}{y:i}Gerry adams owes me.|I gave that guy visas
{37556}{37643}and political legitimacy when you|brits weren't even allowing him on tv.
{37643}{37690}{y:i}Now i want to do this right.
{37691}{37745}{y:i}Why don't have your guys
{37746}{37787}jot down a few ideas,
{37787}{37830}come up with a few lines?
{37831}{37887}{y:i}You'll have them before|you get up.
{38112}{38183}{y:i}Bill on tv: the ira has|claimed responsibility
{38184}{38271}{y:i}for what is ultimately an|outrageous act of cowardice
{38272}{38347}and no one should ever make|the mistake of thinking
{38348}{38398}that actions of this kind represent
{38398}{38449}anything equating to patriotism.
{38450}{38548}{y:i}I, frankly, think now the ball|is in sinn fã©in's court.
{38549}{38648}Everyone has decisions|to make in life.
{38649}{38696}Their decision is,
{38697}{38744}are they going to be part
{38745}{38801}of the peace process or not?
{38802}{38864}{y:i}I hope the answer will be yes.
{38865}{38914}{y:i}Man on tv: good evening.
{38915}{38956}{y:i}The sinn fã©in leader,|gerry adams,
{38957}{39006}{y:i}walked into #10 downing|street today.
{39007}{39072}{y:i}The first such meeting|for 76 years.
{39073}{39122}We had a good meeting|because i think we engaged.
{39123}{39203}I think we faced up|to the difficulties.
{39204}{39306}In many ways the engagement|could be described
{39306}{39367}as a moment in history,|because usually the moments
{39368}{39443}in anglo-irish relationships|in history are bad moments.
{39444}{39486}Today was a significantly|good moment.
{39487}{39573}{y:i}It is thought that president|bill clinton
{39574}{39649}{y:i}helped to revive the peace process|in northern ireland today,
{39650}{39737}{y:i}proving, yet again, the long reach|of his political clout.
{39738}{39786}{y:i}Tony over phone: bill, thank you.
{39786}{39834}My pleasure. happy to help.
{39834}{39887}Sometimes it just takes an outsider
{39888}{39927}to help settle a family dispute.
{39928}{40003}{y:i}Well, i can't thank you enough.
{40004}{40050}After all these months,
{40051}{40119}the peace process is back on track.
{40120}{40184}{y:i}Well, i guess we can jot one down
{40185}{40230}{y:i}for the good guys, eh?
{40230}{40287}Well, we've got a|real shot at this now.
{40288}{40358}And we could never have done|it without your support.
{40359}{40408}Hey, there are no debts here.
{40409}{40507}No i.o.u.s. we're just pulling|together to get a job done.
{40508}{40566}So if there's nothing else,|i've got to go.
{40566}{40621}{y:i}If there's anything anytime...
{40818}{40859}{y:i}man on radio: tonight,|partly cloudy and cool,
{40860}{40901}{y:i}dropping to the mid-upper 50s.
{40902}{40937}{y:i}Weather updated around|the clock...
{41087}{41124}mr. president.
{41343}{41387}Let's go.
{42139}{42221}There's gonna be something in the|news today you should know about.
{42263}{42318}What? what is it?
{42360}{42431}It's not that i don't|know the answer,
{42432}{42494}it's just a very|badly-worded question.
{42525}{42566}And if i did tell you the answer,
{42567}{42640}- you wouldn't learn anything, would you?|- Except cheating.
{42641}{42704}{y:i}- - right, euan,|you've got one more minute on that
{42705}{42761}and that's it. hello....
{42762}{42814}Yeah, are you near a television?
{42815}{42895}{y:i}- tony: yeah.|- Switch on the news.
{42929}{42973}Right. i'll have to|call you back, alastair.
{42974}{43052}- come on, nicky. come on.|- Give it here.
{43052}{43100}{y:i}Man on tv:... taken the|city by storm.
{43101}{43146}This just in from washington.
{43147}{43204}{y:i}Kenneth starr, the independent|counsel investigating
{43205}{43252}{y:i}- alleged criminal conduct...|- Stop drawing pictures and get on with it.
{43253}{43335}{y:i}...of president and mrs.|Clinton in the whitewater affair
{43336}{43400}{y:i}issued a wave of white house|subpoenas today,
{43401}{43479}{y:i}accusing the president of having|sex with monica lewinsky,
{43480}{43548}{y:i}a 23-year-old white house intern.
{43549}{43606}23? she's a child.
{43607}{43660}{y:i}Federal investigators are rumored|to be in possession
{43661}{43731}{y:i}of taped conversations discussing|the alleged affair
{43731}{43807}{y:i}between miss lewinsky and|president clinton.
{43808}{43854}{y:i}The recordings,|in which she refers
{43855}{43943}{y:i}to president clinton as|"the big he" and "the creep,"
{43944}{43984}{y:i}recalling the paula jones case
{43985}{44048}{y:i}in which detailed descriptions|of the president's penis...
{44049}{44091}okay, kids. enough.
{44092}{44148}{y:i}- come on. out.|- Nicky: come on.
{44149}{44202}{y:i}Out, euan.
{44203}{44271}{y:i}- cherie: nick.|- Oh, come on.
{44272}{44326}Come on. come on. come on.|Out out out out out.
{44326}{44371}{y:i}Miss lewinsky is also|rumored to have said
{44372}{44414}{y:i}in one of the taped conversations
{44415}{44468}{y:i}that "i have lied my entire life."
{44469}{44518}{y:i}worse still, lewinsky alleges...
{44519}{44590}this might not be the best time to|be planning a trip to washington.
{44590}{44658}Well, who says any of it is true?
{44659}{44754}If ken starr is involved,|it's probably a right-wing witch hunt,
{44755}{44812}another muckraking exercise.
{44813}{44857}You watch.
{44858}{44909}This story could go away|as quickly as it's broken.
{44910}{44987}The president of america having|sex with a girl half his age?
{44988}{45032}{y:i}Tonight, the president's|own lawyer...
{45033}{45074}{y:i}this story hasn't even started.
{45075}{45119}{y:i}...dismissed the allegations as|mischievous invention.
{45174}{45240}Okay, well, how-|how do you know this girl?
{45275}{45365}She was interning in the west|wing a couple of years ago.
{45365}{45420}- yeah.|- I talked to her a few times.
{45421}{45472}She said she was looking for a job
{45473}{45518}and, you know me,|i offered to help.
{45519}{45589}I gave her a couple of names|of people she could talk to.
{45590}{45641}I was just trying to be nice,
{45642}{45753}but apparently she seemed to|think it was something more.
{45753}{45799}She thought... she thought|it was more, why?
{45800}{45841}Why... why on earth|would she think that?
{45842}{45884}Well, i don't know.
{45885}{45944}You know how it is,
{45945}{45993}how people are around me.
{45993}{46064}So you're telling me that you did|nothing that could be misinterpreted?
{46065}{46117}{y:i}- no. no.|- Nothing that could be misread?
{46117}{46149}- no|- Nothing?
{46150}{46201}Nothing. i swear.
{46269}{46311}{y:i}Now the way they tell it,
{46312}{46405}i was having sex in the|oval office, midday.
{46405}{46474}{y:i}- oh, for heaven's sake.|- Yeah, you know that's ridiculous.
{46475}{46527}{y:i}With all the guards and the|windows around there,
{46528}{46573}that's not gonna happen.
{46606}{46646}These people...
{46647}{46693}This is just all the same bullshit.
{46693}{46738}They think they can put|something in the paper
{46739}{46808}and that just makes it true.|The same old innuendo.
{46809}{46877}The same old digging for dirt|when there's nothing there.
{46877}{46938}Ken starr is gonna go after you
{46939}{46996}with everything he's got.
{47174}{47237}They're discussing his|penis in public now...
{47238}{47308}"five and a ha inches with a|curve in the middle when erect."
{47309}{47344}hardly errol flynn, is it?
{47345}{47391}I wonder who's angrier|with him now...
{47392}{47430}His wife for his betrayals
{47431}{47493}or his press secretary|for his modest endowment?
{47494}{47549}Now had it been 8"|long and thick as a baguette...
{47550}{47589}Oh, for god's sake, shut up.
{47590}{47624}A little irritable today,|aren't we?
{47625}{47717}I am. why do these european summits
{47717}{47758}always fill one with gloom?
{47759}{47802}Because they're full of pompous,|irrelevant twats
{47803}{47856}with stupid accents who|are stuck in the past
{47857}{47921}- and never know when to shut up.|- That would be the reason then.
{47922}{47993}Plus events in washington will|dominate all the front pages now.
{47994}{48038}Which makes the whole thing|feel rather pointless.
{48039}{48107}Sir. morning, sir.
{48108}{48157}The list you asked for|on the current members
{48157}{48214}of the european commission|and their staffs.
{48215}{48265}Thank you.
{48346}{48391}Who is she?
{48392}{48465}A new intern from|the foreign office.
{48606}{48661}You should know the tapes|of lewinsky's conversation,
{48661}{48700}her phone calls that are|supposed to be out there...
{48701}{48741}Well, are they out there or not?
{48741}{48805}Well, it's an ongoing|investigation. it's...
{48805}{48859}The information's privileged.|There's no way we can...
{48860}{48920}Fine, so these tapes that may|or may not be out there...
{48921}{48957}Yes, well, it's been suggested
{48957}{49043}they contain certain|revelations about...
{49044}{49131}{y:i}the president's voicemails|to miss lewinsky,
{49132}{49189}{y:i}an exchange of gifts,
{49189}{49268}his... his preference for oral sex
{49269}{49341}and the supposed existence
{49341}{49396}of a dress with semen stains.
{49397}{49443}That's enough.
{49534}{49578}Whether these...
{49579}{49652}{y:i}tapes are out there or not,
{49653}{49713}it's a "he said, she said. "
{49714}{49756}we have a starstruck intern versus
{49757}{49821}the president of the united states.|They've got nothing.
{49821}{49869}Now the best way for|us to turn the tables,
{49870}{49935}to stop this being personal,|is to make it political,
{49936}{50024}because i'm not gonna conduct a|public debate about my marriage.
{50025}{50101}I want to conduct a debate|about the right-wing media
{50102}{50144}and ken fucking starr,
{50145}{50226}because they have been on our|backs right from the begning.
{50310}{50361}So this is what we're gonna do.
{50362}{50420}{y:i}Man on tv: the white house|said to bin crisis mode,
{50421}{50467}{y:i}with one administration... - woman:...|inside politics
{50468}{50538}{y:i}as mr. clinton prepares to give another|state of the union address.
{50539}{50589}{y:i}Man #2:...the prosecutor puts the|pressure on the white house intern.
{50589}{50633}White house scandal is
{50633}{50676}{y:i}already the biggest soap|opera running
{50677}{50734}{y:i}and the viewers show no|sign of tuning out.
{50735}{50801}But i want to say one thing|to the american people,
{50802}{50847}and i want you to listen to me.
{50848}{50892}I'm gonna say this again:
{50893}{50957}I did not have
{50958}{51020}sexual relations with that woman...
{51021}{51053}Miss lewinsky.
{51053}{51153}{y:i}These allegations are false.
{51153}{51235}{y:i}Now i need to go back to work|for the american people.
{51236}{51292}{y:i}- thank you. - matt lauer:|There's been one subject
{51293}{51336}{y:i}in particular weighing|on the minds
{51337}{51417}{y:i}of the american public-|the alleged sexual relationship
{51418}{51470}{y:i}between the president and|miss lewinsky.
{51471}{51516}{y:i}Has your husband explained|the nature
{51516}{51563}{y:i}of this relationship to|you in detail?
{51564}{51611}Well, we've talked at great length
{51612}{51687}and i think as this matter unfolds
{51688}{51753}the entire country will|have more information.
{51754}{51801}But we're right in the middle
{51802}{51869}of a rather vigorous|feeding frenzy right now.
{51870}{51968}{y:i}And i have learned over these|last many years,
{51968}{52006}{y:i}being involved in politics,
{52007}{52068}that the best thing|to do in these cases
{52068}{52117}is just to be patient,
{52118}{52168}take a deep breath
{52168}{52225}and the truth will come out.
{52226}{52280}But there's nothing we can|dto fight this firestorm
{52281}{52363}of allegations that are out there.
{52364}{52418}{y:i}Do you think that your|husband would admit
{52419}{52459}{y:i}again causing pain in|your marriage?
{52460}{52530}No, absolutely not|and he shouldn't.
{52531}{52600}You know, we've been|married for 22 years,
{52601}{52680}{y:i}and i had learned a long time ago
{52681}{52751}that the only people who|count in any marriage
{52752}{52792}are the two that are in it.
{52793}{52906}{y:i}And i guess i've just been|through it so many times.
{52907}{52988}I mean, bill and i have|been accused of everything,
{52989}{53029}including murder,
{53030}{53087}by some of the very same people
{53088}{53143}who are behind these allegations.
{53143}{53189}{y:i}The great story here,
{53190}{53242}{y:i}for anybody willing to find it,
{53243}{53294}write about it and explain it,
{53295}{53404}is this vast right-wing conspiracy
{53405}{53463}that has been conspiring|against my husband
{53464}{53507}since the day he|announced for president.
{53508}{53623}{y:i}A few journalists have kind of caught|onto it and explained it,
{53624}{53679}{y:i}but it has not yet been|fully revealed
{53679}{53714}to the american public
{53715}{53805}and actually, you know,|in a bizarre sort of way,
{53806}{53866}this may do it.
{55110}{55146}You know, the longer this goes on,
{55147}{55182}the worse it is for clinton.
{55183}{55250}I wonder whether we might not|want to take a step back.
{55250}{55344}I'm on my way to washington to do a|press conference with the man, jonathan.
{55345}{55408}It may be a little late in|the day for a step back.
{55409}{55461}Come on, let's be realistic here.
{55462}{55516}He's hardly bloody|milosevic, is he?
{55584}{55628}What he did or did not do
{55629}{55674}{y:i}is a personal matter.
{55674}{55742}Public people are entitled|to private lives, alastair.
{55743}{55790}There's nothing private about his.
{55790}{55837}It doesn't affect his ability|to govern though, does it?
{55838}{55905}Not to mention he's a friend.
{55906}{55979}{y:i}Tony, all political friendship is|strategic and conditional.
{55980}{56054}A slight cooling may|be no bad thing.
{56054}{56122}What? backff from the|"special relationship"
{56123}{56168}we've all been so keen to promote?
{56169}{56251}No, not back off. just re-evaluate.
{56339}{56400}And if there is any|truth to the story,
{56401}{56462}they're in so deep|they'll never get out.
{56462}{56499}{y:i}Well, he can hardly come clean,|can he?
{56500}{56555}America elected him,|knowing his history with women.
{56556}{56641}If he did do it, he should make a|big public apology and move on.
{56642}{56702}No, his lawyers would hate that idea.|They probably see it as a chance
{56703}{56758}to tough it out on definition and|hope that they'll all go away.
{56759}{56816}Would you if you|were defending him?
{56817}{56876}Who? the big creep?
{56877}{56924}I suppose it comes down
{56925}{56997}to what you actually|think constitutes "sex."
{56998}{57059}{y:i}that's easy... it's intercourse,|penetration.
{57060}{57105}What, so blowjobs don't count?
{57106}{57170}- no.|- No.
{57195}{57234}God. you men are pathetic.
{57235}{57285}Come on, you know the deal...
{57286}{57347}- eating ain't cheating.|- Oh, that's disgusting.
{57348}{57398}{y:i}- if it ain't in, it ain't a sin.|- Jonathan: apparently
{57398}{57446}{y:i}there's even a passage in the|bible that supports it.
{57446}{57504}{y:i}- supports what?|- Jonathan: the idea that
{57505}{57575}oral sex doesn't|constitute adultery.
{57576}{57633}- bollocks!|- Really?
{57634}{57724}Ecclesiastes. discovered by|clinton's rapid response team.
{57725}{57762}God, they're good.
{57763}{57816}{y:i}It's hardly bloody|fidelity either!
{57817}{57883}I mean, organs from one person's|body have entered another.
{57884}{57945}How can that not be sex?
{57946}{58006}Huh. god, this language.
{58007}{58073}This is just bizarre.|I mean, technically,
{58074}{58130}what we're doing is having a|political conversation here,
{58131}{58202}but it's just... blue.
{58203}{58283}Yesterday c.n.n.|Put out an announcement
{58284}{58334}before their nightly news bulletin
{58335}{58425}warning parents the content might|not be appropriate for children.
{58426}{58529}- god. - which brings us back|to the original question:
{58530}{58617}Shouldn't we be thinking|about taking a step back?
{58698}{58756}{y:i}Man on tv: all eyes today|will be on tony blair
{58757}{58806}{y:i}as he flies into a political storm
{58807}{58877}{y:i}the likes of which hasn't been seen|since the watergate affair.
{58877}{58925}{y:i}With his back against the wall,|bill clinton may benefit
{58926}{58984}{y:i}from his close connection with the|british prime minister,
{58985}{59038}{y:i}who is widely admired in|the united states.
{59039}{59097}{y:i}It is likely the official|agenda for the meeting
{59098}{59143}{y:i}between the president and|prime minister
{59144}{59183}{y:i}will be pushed aside for questions
{59184}{59221}{y:i}about bill clinton's relationship
{59222}{59290}{y:i}with a former white house intern.
{59605}{59645}There's an article in tomorrow's
{59646}{59733}"new york times" that suggests|clinton coacd his secretary
{59733}{59787}to lie about his|relationship with lewinsky.
{59831}{59881}If that's true, then it implies
{59882}{59928}he did lie in the|paula jones hearing
{59929}{60001}and he did lean on lewinsky|to lie in her affidavit.
{60002}{60090}Infidelity by a|president is one thing.
{60091}{60173}Perjury is quite another.
{60200}{60263}{y:i}-|he's here.
{60264}{60322}{y:i}Let me see those numbers|straightaway.
{60323}{60364}{y:i}Man #2: yes, sir.
{60425}{60503}Tony, sorry to put|you through this.
{60504}{60563}- not at all.|- We'll get through it.
{60625}{60661}{y:i}Man #3: ladies and gentlemen,
{60662}{60702}{y:i}the president of the united states
{60703}{60780}{y:i}and the prime minister of great|britain and northern ireland.
{60914}{60981}Let me just start by saying|that it's a real pleasure
{60982}{61041}to welcome prime minister|blair here to washington.
{61042}{61112}Today on the verge|of a new century,
{61113}{61203}a new millennium,|america is prouder than ever
{61204}{61265}to stand shoulder to shoulder|with its close friend
{61266}{61307}{y:i}the united kingdom.
{61308}{61349}{y:i}It continues a great tradition
{61350}{61430}{y:i}and a special relationship|between our two countries.
{61431}{61478}Mr. president. mr. president.
{61479}{61525}- eric.|- Prime minister,
{61526}{61609}as a friend and as a religious man,
{61610}{61655}i was wondering whether you offered
{61656}{61714}{y:i}your personal advice to|president clinton
{61715}{61761}during these difficult times
{61762}{61848}of criminal investigation|into his sexual behavior.
{61876}{61908}That's what, in the british media,
{61909}{61977}we call a helpful question.
{61978}{62020}Uh, no.
{62046}{62086}Michael.
{62087}{62138}Prime minister, some people|are struck by the warmth
{62139}{62182}of the personal statements of|support that you've been giving
{62183}{62254}{y:i}to the president. can i ask|had you ever considered
{62255}{62314}that might be a politically|risky strategy?
{62490}{62568}You heard the president talking
{62569}{62620}about the special relationship
{62621}{62654}between our two countries
{62655}{62718}and the great tradition of standing
{62719}{62766}shoulder to shoulder|with one another,
{62767}{62864}and i'm reminded of a story|from the height of world war ii,
{62865}{62952}when britain desperately|needed america's help.
{62953}{63061}It wasn't always certain that|they would come to our help,
{63062}{63123}and at one point harry hopkins,
{63124}{63218}the emissary to the american president|roosevelt, was sent to britain.
{63218}{63283}Hopkins said to churchill,|"i suppose you wish to know
{63284}{63344}what i'll be saying to president|roosevelt on my return."
{63389}{63446}well, he said he would be quoting
{63446}{63504}from a passage from the bible:
{63541}{63620}"whither thou goest, i will go;
{63621}{63711}Whither thou lodgest, i will lodge.
{63712}{63802}Thy people shall be my people,
{63802}{63924}and thy god my god,|even to the end."
{63989}{64098}you just asked whether my support,|my friendship,
{64099}{64149}{y:i}is a politically risky strategy?
{64150}{64216}I've worked with president clinton
{64217}{64241}for some nine months.
{64242}{64279}I have found him throughout
{64280}{64355}{y:i}someone i could trust,|someone i could rely upon,
{64356}{64461}someone i am proud to|call not just a colleague,
{64462}{64498}but a friend.
{64498}{64566}{y:i}And i happen to think that if you|look at the american economy,
{64567}{64620}if you look at the respect
{64621}{64688}with which america is held|right round the world today,
{64689}{64774}it's a pretty impressive|record for anyone.
{64775}{64826}- reporters: prime minister. - mr.|President. mr. president.
{64826}{64884}Do you appreciate mr.|Blair's support?
{64885}{64937}No. no.
{64976}{65018}I think he should have|just come over here
{65018}{65056}{y:i}- and jumped all over me.|- Mr. president.
{65057}{65146}{y:i}- thank you. - mr. president.|Mr. president.
{65292}{65354}I hope you worked out|what you want in return,
{65392}{65430}because you saved that man today.
{65430}{65470}He owes you big time.
{65471}{65522}Who says i want|something in return?
{65523}{65609}Well, if you don't, it makes what|you did even harder to understand.
{65610}{65676}I did it because i like him.
{65677}{65743}And because now he owes you.
{65744}{65852}And because i believe in|what he's trying to do,
{65852}{65910}what we can do together.
{65911}{65973}And because now he owes you.
{65974}{66079}Well, is there anything|wrong with that?
{66301}{66367}{y:i}We've been on borrowed|time in the balkans.
{66367}{66407}Milosevic is playing us for fools.
{66408}{66456}{y:i}Bill over phone: we should|have seen this coming.
{66499}{66587}We got milosevic to the|negotiating table over bosnia
{66587}{66666}by agreeing that kosovo was an|internal matter for the serbs,
{66667}{66715}and now he thinks that|he can do what he wants.
{66716}{66773}{y:i}And by the time the un is|finished arguing
{66774}{66819}{y:i}over the finer points of|international law,
{66820}{66886}milosevic will have killed|another 250,000 people
{66887}{66931}and driven another two|million from their homes,
{66932}{66975}just like he did in bosnia.
{66976}{67038}Now that's not going to happen,|not on my watch.
{67039}{67113}John major acted too slowly|and too reluctantly on bosnia.
{67114}{67163}This government's not going|to make the same mistake.
{67164}{67243}Yes, we have to make|our case to the u.n.
{67244}{67285}That the serbs are|guilty of genocide,
{67286}{67331}but at the same time|we've got to come up
{67331}{67384}with a credible threat|to stop milosevic.
{67385}{67473}{y:i}You and madeleine albright are|preaching from the same pulpit.
{67474}{67526}So where do we go from here?
{67527}{67605}{y:i}We start with the full range|of economic sanctions,
{67606}{67644}work to get nato on board
{67645}{67711}and consider our military options.
{67712}{67766}What about the russians?
{67767}{67812}{y:i}Well, you just leave the|russians to me.
{67813}{67895}Boris... he's going to kick and|scream just like he did over bosnia,
{67896}{67955}but we just gave him|$5 billion in aid,
{67956}{68003}so i've got a little|leverage there.
{68004}{68066}I'm more concerned about europe.
{68067}{68135}Well, the italians will be|against any action for a start,
{68136}{68222}{y:i}- as will the germane.|- What about the french?
{68223}{68279}Chirac will want to|play by the book.
{68280}{68330}{y:i}He'll do nothing without|the full support
{68331}{68375}{y:i}of the international community.
{68376}{68447}You've got the perfect forum there.
{68448}{68547}Presidency of the e.u.|For another three months.
{68548}{68603}It hasn't made any|difference so far.
{68604}{68698}You can be very persuasive, tony.
{68699}{68756}You know, i've a theory.|You can take any word
{68757}{68797}in the english language|that excites you,
{68798}{68873}like sex, food, music or money,
{68874}{68942}and completely remove|any pleasure it arouses
{68942}{69006}simply by adding|the prefix "euro. "...
{69271}{69336}{y:i}good morning, jacques.
{69337}{69419}Perhaps you could enlighten us?|We've been struggling with a small,
{69420}{69470}but i think important,|technicality.
{69471}{69552}- of course. happy to help.|- Exactly how many centimeters
{69553}{69619}is five and a half inches?
{69797}{69844}You'd think some of these guys|would actually step to his defense.
{69845}{69921}As leaders, we're all hanging|from the same thin thread.
{69922}{70016}But the joy of seeing an|american president slip up...
{70017}{70085}It's irresistible.
{70086}{70137}{y:i}Man over tv: the pressure on|bill clinton to testify
{70138}{70189}{y:i}before the grand jury|intensified today
{70190}{70234}{y:i}with the announcement of a deal
{70235}{70280}{y:i}between monica lewinsky|and kenneth starr.
{70281}{70329}{y:i}Under total immunity,|monica lewinsky is
{70330}{70376}{y:i}is reportedly telling prosecutors
{70376}{70450}{y:i}she and the president talked about how|to conceal their relationship.
{70451}{70516}{y:i}This is what the president is|desperate to avoid...
{70516}{70552}{y:i}the indignity of appearing
{70553}{70600}{y:i}at a federal courthouse|in washington.
{70600}{70696}{y:i}The special prosecutor, kenneth starr,|is playing a tough game.
{70697}{70766}{y:i}He is determined to question the|president under oath,
{70767}{70847}{y:i}and he is backed by mr. clinton's|republican opponents in congress.
{70848}{70887}Get me kendall.
{70888}{70940}If kenneth starr does have|additional information,
{70940}{70988}i think it could snowball
{70989}{71049}into a real impeachment|problem for the president.
{71050}{71092}{y:i}Man #2: i have a very|strong belief...
{71092}{71136}tell them i'll testify,
{71176}{71223}but i want the subpoena revoked,
{71224}{71296}{y:i}i'd like to have my|lawyers present
{71323}{71390}and we do it in the white house.
{71423}{71469}{y:i}First reports now suggest
{71469}{71523}{y:i}that monica lewinsky has|changed her story
{71524}{71569}{y:i}to admit there was an affair
{71570}{71629}{y:i}and has even turned over to|the special prosecutor
{71630}{71674}{y:i}tapes of phone calls|from the president
{71675}{71728}{y:i}and a dress, possibly stained,
{71729}{71786}{y:i}that may help prove the|relationship.
{71786}{71834}{y:i}Today her lawyer denied|that information
{71834}{71926}{y:i}about the dress had been leaked either|by him or her other lawyer.
{71926}{72014}{y:i}The white house claims much of this|is unsubstantiated rumor,
{72014}{72069}{y:i}but the fbi confirmed to me today
{72070}{72128}{y:i}it has received the dress|from kenneth starr
{72129}{72182}{y:i}and is processing it for testing.
{72481}{72527}Are you awake?
{72645}{72689}I am now.
{72769}{72812}I need to...
{72813}{72881}Tell you about the situation.
{72940}{73019}It's much more serious|than i let on.
{73077}{73128}What?
{73198}{73272}I'm going to say in my testimony
{73337}{73429}that there... was something
{73430}{73488}inappropriate
{73489}{73548}about that relationship.
{73636}{73683}{y:i}Bill on tv: in deposition|last january
{73684}{73737}{y:i}i was asked questions about|my relationship
{73738}{73787}{y:i}with monica lewinsky.
{73788}{73840}{y:i}While my answers were|legally accurate,
{73841}{73909}i did not volunteer information.
{73909}{73957}Indeed, i did have a relationship
{73957}{74017}with miss lewinsky that|was not appropriate.
{74018}{74085}In fact... - i'd like|to know the distinction
{74085}{74141}between "legally accurate"|and "big fucking lie."
{74142}{74241}i can only tell you i was|motivated by many factors.
{74241}{74318}First, by a desire|to protect myself
{74319}{74380}from the embarrassment|of my own conduct.
{74381}{74438}I was also very concerned
{74439}{74482}about protecting my family.
{74483}{74545}{y:i}The fact that these questions|were being asked...
{74546}{74597}what a you gonna say?
{74622}{74673}I don't know.
{74674}{74733}Maybe nothing.
{74733}{74809}Well, they'll be|expecting a statement.
{74810}{74861}Saying what?
{74862}{74923}That i am all too aware thh
{74924}{74985}because of my public|support for the president?
{74986}{75088}That i find all this|excruciatingly embarrassing?
{75089}{75177}That i feel i had no|option but to stand by him?
{75202}{75247}I think not.
{75294}{75374}{y:i}Our country has been distracted by|this matter for too long,
{75375}{75437}{y:i}and i take responsibility|for my part...
{75437}{75487}do you think she'll ever leave him?
{75538}{75593}Would you leave me?
{75644}{75686}No.
{75687}{75729}But i'd make your life hell.
{75730}{75771}{y:i}...real problems to solve,
{75772}{75833}{y:i}real security matters to face.
{75834}{75909}{y:i}And so tonight i ask|you to turn away...
{75910}{75980}{y:i}- - ...|from the spectacle of the past seven months,
{75981}{76049}{y:i}to repair the fabric of our|national discourse
{76049}{76128}and to return our attention|to all the challenges
{76129}{76188}and all the promise of the|next american century.
{76189}{76274}{y:i}Thank you for watching|and good night.
{76857}{76906}How do you wanna do this?
{76907}{76980}You first, me a few steps behind?
{77047}{77090}Together?
{77135}{77194}I want us to do this together.
{77261}{77328}Whether or not that's possible,|i don't know.
{77398}{77485}I have to find my way|through this in my own time.
{77569}{77651}By myself. okay?
{77673}{77710}Okay.
{78085}{78129}How do i look?
{78173}{78220}Incredible.
{78342}{78391}{y:i}- man: mrs. clinton?|- Reporters: mrs. clinton?
{78392}{78454}{y:i}- man #2: hillary, one picture.|- Man #3: this way, ma'am.
{78623}{78693}- so what are his chances?|- Of surviving impeachment?
{78693}{78742}I'd say 50/50 at best.
{78743}{78791}His approval rating's gone|right down the toilet.
{78792}{78826}Even if he does survive,|his party will take
{78827}{78884}such a pounding in the mid-terms,|he'll be gridlocked.
{78884}{78932}He's a lame-duck president.
{78932}{79012}Which, of course, presents the|chance for others to shine.
{79012}{79070}Well, he's still our strongest ally
{79071}{79136}and the best hope we've got of|seeing things through in kosovo.
{79136}{79238}Evil triumphs when|good men do nothing.
{79239}{79285}We can all sit here,|throw our hands up and say,
{79286}{79358}"what does what's happening|in kosovo have to do with us?"
{79359}{79444}{y:i}ethnic cleansing, systematic rape,
{79444}{79502}{y:i}mass murder.
{79503}{79568}{y:i}No one in the west who has seen
{79569}{79624}{y:i}what is happening in|kosovo can doubt
{79624}{79700}{y:i}that nato's military|action is justified.
{79701}{79790}{y:i}20 years ago we would not have|been fighting in kosovo.
{79791}{79845}{y:i}We would have tued our|backs on it.
{79846}{79890}But we are a community.
{79891}{79930}What happens in one part of europe
{79931}{79979}affects every other part.
{79980}{80019}And there is only one place to be
{80020}{80088}and that's in the thick of it,|trying to sort it out.
{80089}{80167}{y:i}Woman on tv: following a further|upsurge in violence,
{80167}{80228}{y:i}the un security council|issued a resolution
{80229}{80291}{y:i}demanding an end to serbian|action in kosovo
{80291}{80359}{y:i}and putting 500 aircraft|under wesley clark,
{80359}{80394}{y:i}nato's supreme commander.
{80395}{80441}{y:i}Faced with the threat of|a unified nato,
{80442}{80487}{y:i}slobodan milosevic has|backed down.
{80488}{80552}{y:i}Woman #2: president clinton's personal|envoy, richard holbrook,
{80553}{80619}{y:i}has negotiated a ceasefire with|the yugoslav president
{80620}{80679}{y:i}who has agreed to reduce|troop numbers
{80679}{80774}{y:i}and to allow 2,000 unarmed|observers into the province.
{80775}{80811}It's not enough, bill.
{80811}{80880}Nate's agreement could|fall apart at any second.
{80881}{80946}The russians are only going along|with it to keep up appearances.
{80947}{81001}Milosevic isn't|fooled by any of it.
{81002}{81068}Well, look at you, baby brother,|stepping up to the big roulette table.
{81069}{81133}{y:i}He's just waiting us out.
{81134}{81172}{y:i}Meanwhile, winter is coming
{81173}{81233}{y:i}and hundreds of thousands|of displaced people
{81234}{81272}need to get back to their villages.
{81273}{81330}{y:i}As far as i can tell,|the ceasefire is holding.
{81331}{81392}We've got observers on the|ground watching his every move.
{81393}{81453}{y:i}He tries anything... - yeah, but look|what he's done to his own people.
{81454}{81525}Do you think he cares about a bunch of|observers without a gun between them?
{81526}{81577}It's just a matter of time.
{81578}{81650}What do you want me to say, tony?
{81674}{81722}Well...
{81722}{81800}Unless we back up the|threat of air strikes
{81801}{81863}with a willingness to|put men on the ground,
{81864}{81922}i just... i just don't see
{81922}{81958}how he can take us seriously.
{81959}{82030}{y:i}Look, i hate milosevic as|much as the next guy,
{82031}{82104}but sending troops|into a sovereign state
{82105}{82170}that hasn't attacked us?|Now that's a pretty tough sell
{82171}{82226}to congress and the|american people,
{82226}{82272}and i like to think i'm|a pretty good salesman!
{82273}{82330}{y:i}Bill, if... - i know why|you want to do this.
{82330}{82374}{y:i}I understand your ambition.
{82375}{82420}You want to take a step up,
{82421}{82481}but that dog just won't hunt.
{82482}{82529}I want to do it because|it's the right thing to do.
{82530}{82577}{y:i}We both want to do the right thing
{82578}{82634}and mobilizing nato so|it's ready to strike
{82635}{82672}{y:i}- is the right thing to do.|- Yeah, but bill...
{82673}{82717}{y:i}in case you haven't noticed,
{82718}{82769}there is a bookoos|of people over here
{82770}{82831}{y:i}- looking to get me impeached.|- Yes, i'm very much aware of that.
{82832}{82881}Look, if we don't do this now,
{82882}{82942}i guarantee we'll be|forced to do it later.
{82943}{82985}{y:i}Let me be clear:
{82986}{83056}Until milosevic does|something that proves
{83057}{83126}he violates the deal on the table,|we do nothing.
{83521}{83561}You can hardly be surprised.
{83562}{83619}Politically, his hands are tied.
{83620}{83657}Yeah, maybe physically too,
{83657}{83691}if hillary's got|anything to do with it.
{83692}{83728}But he's the one who|talked about legacy.
{83729}{83769}I mean, it could really|help to sort things out
{83769}{83822}if he did the right|thing over this.
{83823}{83870}Being seen to be doing something
{83871}{83937}{y:i}is completely different to|actually doing it.
{83938}{83986}Thatcher always said,
{83987}{84032}"no point being here|if we don't do things,
{84033}{84099}- big things." - please don't|start again on thatcher.
{84133}{84181}The lives of those|people depend on the whim
{84182}{84257}of an insane tyrant and we|have the power to change that.
{84257}{84316}And if bill won't or can't,
{84317}{84381}then it's up to me, isn't it?
{84522}{84585}Right. come on, winston.
{84611}{84655}Parents' evening.
{84722}{84764}Thank you, marcus.
{84765}{84821}What's the math|teacher's name again?
{84821}{84853}Humberstone, paul.
{84959}{85046}- hello, good to see you.|- Hello, headmaster.
{85047}{85105}{y:i}Woman on tv: on a hillside|above the village
{85106}{85144}{y:i}of racak in kosovo...
{85145}{85236}{y:i}45 people hacked to death by|serbian paramilitaries
{85237}{85291}right under the noses|of the observers.
{85292}{85334}{y:i}I know. i saw the news.
{85335}{85392}{y:i}Every station in the world is|showing the same footage.
{85393}{85458}{y:i}We've got to stop fiddling|around the edges
{85459}{85510}{y:i}and prove to milosevic that|we mean business.
{85511}{85597}If we don't, there's going to be|more massacres, more refugees.
{85598}{85652}{y:i}The people over here,|they just don't get that.
{85652}{85699}{y:i}All they want to know is,
{85700}{85764}is this a war america|should be fighting?
{85765}{85844}If we do go in,|bomb the hell out of milosevic,
{85844}{85884}{y:i}what happens if all we|wind up doing is
{85885}{85966}{y:i}pissing him off and he ramps up|his assault on kosovo?
{85967}{86081}{y:i}We don't even have a grantee,|if nato does go in,
{86082}{86132}air strikes are going to do any go.
{86133}{86202}How long are you going to|keep going arou on this?
{86235}{86316}Til you tell me it's|the right thing to do.
{86368}{86416}It's the right thing to do
{86448}{86528}and you don't need|me to tell you that.
{86528}{86569}No.
{86615}{86661}But it sure does|make me feel better
{86662}{86720}hearing you say it.
{86720}{86772}{y:i}Man on tv: the serbs say they shot
{86773}{86840}{y:i}several dozen terrorists|in uniform,
{86840}{86907}{y:i}but these men wear no uniform...
{86908}{87006}{y:i}...and receive no hearing from the|police who separated them...
{87007}{87073}{y:i}- hello? - bill: are|you watching this?
{87074}{87122}I am.
{87123}{87185}{y:i}Because this shit is bad.
{87186}{87240}Yes, it is.
{87241}{87334}Okay, bombing from 15,000'.
{87335}{87404}I'll tell my guys to|tell nato we're in.
{87405}{87482}{y:i}Man on tv:...to find|their loved ones. -
{87529}{87599}{y:i}"look what they've done," she cries.|"it's a massacre."
{87600}{87678}{y:i}and the obscene way these men|and boys have died
{87679}{87734}{y:i}is a kind of proof.
{87735}{87792}Get me the secretary|of state for defense
{87792}{87836}and the chief of defense staff.
{87837}{87896}Yes, i know what the time is.
{87897}{87993}{y:i}Man on tv: nato's attack on yugoslavia,|long threatened,
{87994}{88062}{y:i}is tonight under way with|massive force.
{88063}{88124}{y:i}Man #2: the stealth fighter|bombers led the way
{88125}{88158}{y:i}for an attack that has tonight
{88159}{88226}{y:i}put the western alliance at|war with yugoslavia.
{88280}{88345}{y:i}Tony on tv: we have learned twice|before in this century
{88346}{88429}{y:i}that appeasement does not work.
{88430}{88523}If we let an evil dictator|range unchallenged,
{88524}{88564}we will have to spill
{88564}{88636}infinitely more blood and treasure
{88637}{88692}- to stop him later.|- People on tv: hear hear!
{88693}{88756}This is not a battle for territory.
{88756}{88828}{y:i}It is a battle for humanity.
{88829}{88923}{y:i}- it is a just cause.|- Hear hear!
{88924}{88981}{y:i}Woman on tv: in response|to nato air strikes,
{88982}{89052}{y:i}milosevic's forces have stepped|up their campaign
{89052}{89112}{y:i}to drive kosovan albanians|from serbia,
{89112}{89165}{y:i}leaving hundreds of|thousands homeless.
{89166}{89213}Refugees appear, of course,
{89214}{89303}as a result of bombing,|and everybody knows it.
{89304}{89353}{y:i}Man #2: where will you go now?
{89354}{89404}I don't know,
{89405}{89498}but mostly what i would like|is to come back at my home
{89499}{89570}and to live normal like...
{89571}{89660}Like all europeans do,
{89661}{89704}because we are part of europe.
{89705}{89766}{y:i}Today, tony and cherie blair
{89767}{89811}{y:i}came to see the situation|themselves,
{89812}{89884}{y:i}to witness the scale of the|humanitarian crisis
{89885}{89936}{y:i}for which many nations|throughout the world
{89937}{90019}{y:i}are increasingly taking|nato to task.
{90020}{90050}Just to see these people...
{90051}{90097}These completely innocent people,
{90098}{90161}who've been forced|from their homes,
{90162}{90223}mercilessly, at the point of a gun.
{90224}{90271}Some of them,|as we've just been hearing,
{90271}{90361}faced unspeakable horrors.
{90362}{90445}I just feel we have|a duty to ensure
{90446}{90496}that they can return to|their homes in peace.
{90497}{90570}{y:i}Man #3: do you have a message|for the people of kosovo?
{90597}{90691}Well, we will not let you down.
{90717}{90757}{y:i}As civilian casualties
{90758}{90806}{y:i}from nato bombings|continue to mount,
{90806}{90874}{y:i}european leaders are coming|under increasing pressure
{90875}{90938}{y:i}to justify the military campaign|against the serbs.
{90938}{91023}Stop the war! stop the bombing!
{91024}{91118}Nato out! nato out!
{91169}{91214}This is a nightmare.
{91215}{91275}I mean, we've bullied the e.|U. into this
{91276}{91322}and all we've done is|make matters worse.
{91323}{91391}The air campaign|simply isn't working,
{91392}{91426}not as currently configured.
{91427}{91474}It's too half-hearted.
{91475}{91539}The list of approved|targets is too limited.
{91540}{91643}It's done nothing to impede|milosevic's ability to wage war.
{91644}{91706}{y:i}So all we've really done|is rally the serbs.
{91706}{91762}{y:i}Milosevic is looking like a hero,
{91763}{91827}because he stood up to western|aggression and we look like fools.
{91828}{91877}We're losing the p.r.|Campaign, tony, big time.
{91878}{91931}Unless nato is prepared|to step up the bombing
{91932}{91987}and commit to ground troops,|we could lose this thing.
{91988}{92030}Nato will never commit,
{92031}{92080}not without clinton.
{92302}{92370}{y:i}I know you're committed to|intensifying the air campaign,
{92371}{92414}{y:i}but i'm here to ask you
{92415}{92485}to also commit to a ground|invasion into kosovo
{92486}{92568}to resolve this situation|once and for all.
{92598}{92651}Unless we do so
{92652}{92685}i am of the firm opinion
{92686}{92744}that milosevic will|persist in believing
{92745}{92833}that nato will lack the will|to finish what it's started.
{92894}{92980}Strategically, we have two options:
{92981}{93098}The first, a limited|invasion of 80,000 troops
{93099}{93173}that will drive serb|forces out of kosovo
{93173}{93267}and create safe havens|for refugees to return;
{93346}{93429}Secondly, a general|invasion of serbia itself
{93429}{93497}with 200,000 troops,
{93497}{93589}inging about the total overthrow|of the milosevic regime.
{93589}{93653}And actually,|we'd favor the former...
{93654}{93772}A smaller invasion,
{93773}{93856}{y:i}th air units parachuted into-|- Bill: howard.
{93892}{93936}{y:i}If we do what you're suggesting,
{93937}{94006}people will interpret it|as an admission on our part
{94007}{94073}{y:i}of the failure of our|air campaign,
{94074}{94143}so politically it's a|non-starter right there.
{94144}{94192}{y:i}Also, the minute you|put our troops
{94193}{94244}{y:i}into milosevic's territory,
{94245}{94299}you're fighting on his|terms in his backyard,
{94300}{94356}{y:i}handing him a huge advantage.
{94356}{94420}{y:i}With the bombing we keep|our distance,
{94420}{94483}limit the risk, yet still|maintain our advantage.
{94484}{94537}But the bombing's not working.
{94538}{94572}We all know that.
{94572}{94648}{y:i}Plus, even in your|limited-invasion scenario
{94648}{94701}we'd have to call up reservists
{94702}{94780}{y:i}for a conflict in a place most|americans don't know exists.
{94781}{94824}I really don't understand|your hesitancy.
{94824}{94888}We are staring a wholesale|human catastrophe in the face.
{94889}{94965}Are you going to send over as|many troops as you expect us to?
{94966}{95008}Well, that's not possible.
{95009}{95057}As you well know,|given the relative size
{95058}{95111}of our armies, our resources.
{95112}{95160}{y:i}We get the point, prime minister.
{95161}{95235}You're ready to fight|to the last american.
{95308}{95367}We have to win this.
{95404}{95455}{y:i}I've made a promise.
{95496}{95596}Politically, i've really|stuck my neck out here.
{95820}{95878}Why don't we step|outside for a moment?
{95903}{95951}The two of us.
{96423}{96483}Let me get this straight.
{96484}{96542}You want me to spend|billions of dollars
{96543}{96604}of american taxpayer money|and lose american lives?
{96605}{96673}This is a battle|between good and evil,
{96674}{96740}between civilization and barbarity.
{96741}{96790}The intervention and removal
{96842}{96910}{y:i}ourechristiantors responsibility.
{96911}{96950}"christian responsibility"?
{96951}{97009}You know, for a|center-left democrat
{97010}{97074}you're beginning to sound an|awful lot like jerry falwell.
{97075}{97119}And what about the repercussions?
{97119}{97177}Civilian casualties|from a ground campaign
{97178}{97250}could be even greater than those|caused by errant bombs without,
{97251}{97318}in my estimation, enhancing|our prospects for victory.
{97319}{97359}Nothing could have more|serious consequences
{97360}{97437}- than being defeated in kosovo.|- Losing is not an option.
{97438}{97511}{y:i}I am committed to winning|this thing
{97512}{97606}and i will do whatever it takes|to make sure that happens.
{97607}{97675}Now if you want to talk about|sending in ground troops
{97676}{97726}at some future date, fine.
{97727}{97777}But we keep it between ourselves...
{97778}{97814}Off the record.
{97814}{97863}Now, on the record,
{97864}{97928}here's what i'm saying,|so listen up:
{97929}{98003}Nato won't go for ground troops
{98004}{98054}and neither will i.
{98400}{98445}Well, of course they don't care.
{98446}{98506}Half of them don't know|where bloody yugoslavia is.
{98870}{98923}- this could be the end of me.|- Come on.
{98924}{98994}No, i'm serious, alastair.|I'm completely out on a limb here.
{98995}{99068}If we don't win this thing, i'm the|one who's gonna have to answer for it.
{99069}{99145}Why not take clinton up on his|offer to start quietly working
{99146}{99195}on a ground invasion|as an interim measure?
{99196}{99233}Because i don't believe him.
{99234}{99270}He's lied to everybody else,
{99271}{99307}why should he be|telling me the truth?
{99308}{99377}No. no. bollocks to that.
{99378}{99426}It's the chicago|speech tomorrow, right?
{99427}{99488}{y:i}- yeah. - right. well, i want|you to beef it up a bit.
{99489}{99557}I want us to put his back|right up against the wal
{99558}{99621}hang on a minute, tony. are you sure|this is what you want to be doing?
{99622}{99662}This could really backfire on us.
{99663}{99713}And i want every right-wing|hack with an axe to grind
{99714}{99768}{y:i}about the moral bankruptcy|of this administration
{99769}{99824}to be there to hear it-|front row seats.
{100076}{100141}{y:i}No one who has seen what is|happening in kosovo
{100142}{100238}{y:i}can doubt that nato's military|action is justified,
{100239}{100335}{y:i}and that military action|will continue...
{100336}{100438}{y:i}...until milosevic is|defeated absolutely.
{100438}{100517}Success is the only exit strategy
{100518}{100580}i am prepared to consider.
{100581}{100639}We are witnessing the beginnings
{100640}{100712}of a new doctrine of|international community...
{100713}{100789}{y:i}many nations working hand in hand,
{100790}{100882}cooperating on issues|that conont us all.
{100941}{101040}You are the most powerful|country in the world.
{101041}{101132}{y:i}It must be difficult and|occasionally irritating
{101133}{101175}to be the recipient|of every demand,
{101176}{101231}to be called upon in every crisis.
{101232}{101286}The cry "what's it|got to do with us?"
{101286}{101362}must be regularly heard on|the lips of your people.
{101363}{101450}Yet the nations with|the greatest power
{101451}{101529}have the greatest responsibility.
{101530}{101594}{y:i}We need you engaged.
{101595}{101646}I say to you:
{101647}{101688}Never fall again
{101689}{101749}for the dorine of isolationism.
{101749}{101806}The world cannot afford it.
{101807}{101865}{y:i}And realize that in britain
{101866}{101941}{y:i}you have a friend that|will stand with you
{101941}{101993}and fashion with you
{101994}{102045}the design for a future built
{102045}{102105}on peace and prosperity for all,
{102106}{102165}{y:i}which is the only dream
{102165}{102241}that makes humanity|worth preserving.
{102629}{102673}Too slow.
{102717}{102766}Only me.
{102767}{102833}"all hail king tony,|" "chicago tribune."
{102834}{102920}"why don't we have a president like|tony blair? " "the new york times."
{102921}{103022}"blair shows courage while|white house vacillates,"
{103023}{103072}"washington post. "
{103073}{103126}{y:i}"listening to the british|prime minister
{103127}{103181}in chicago last night,|one couldn't help thinking
{103182}{103229}how much president|clinton could learn
{103229}{103310}{y:i}from his churchillian|younger colleague.
{103311}{103376}Both these men talk the talk.
{103377}{103442}The difference is,|behind closed doors,

{103601}{103677}wow. you must've been up|all night writing those.
{103761}{103827}In terms of public approval,
{103866}{103934}you're the number-one leader|in the world right now.
{104002}{104079}{y:i}Man over tv: leaders of the nato powers|convened in washington today
{104080}{104136}{y:i}to debate the worsening|situation in kosovo.
{104137}{104186}{y:i}...speculation as to the|determination of nato
{104187}{104247}{y:i}to stay the course,|with some members suggesting
{104248}{104293}{y:i}they might be having|second thoughts.
{104294}{104358}{y:i}Man #2:...the celebration of|nato's 50th birthday
{104359}{104457}{y:i}but it is expected to be totally given|over to discussions on kosovo.
{104586}{104639}Give the prime minister|and me a moment, will you?
{104640}{104676}Yes, sir.
{104737}{104804}- who would've guessed?|- What?
{104805}{104874}What a tough little son of a|bitch you turned out to be,
{104875}{104924}stabbing me in the back|in my own front yard.
{104925}{104993}- now that takes balls.|- My head was on a block.
{104994}{105059}- you gave me no choice.|- Well, the way i see it,
{105060}{105118}your head's still on the block
{105119}{105193}- and i still have a choice.|- That's not what your papers suggest.
{105194}{105252}Oh, that's right... your new friends.|"all hail king tony."
{105252}{105319}so ground troops? are you in?
{105349}{105409}Maybe you ought to ask|yourself this question:
{105410}{105461}{y:i}What kind of a king begs
{105461}{105500}others to do his fighting for him?
{105501}{105569}Well, if we act now,
{105569}{105631}we can end the fighting.
{105708}{105772}{y:i}Man on tv: with its pledge to|do whatever it takes
{105773}{105811}{y:i}to prevail in kosovo,
{105812}{105906}{y:i}nato agrees to expand its bombing|campaign against serbia.
{105907}{105951}{y:i}Assured by nato's resolve
{105952}{106013}{y:i}and the increasing effectiveness|of the air strikes,
{106014}{106057}{y:i}president clinton|publicly announced
{106058}{106109}{y:i}the us will consider all|military options
{106109}{106197}{y:i}- to resolve the conflict. - woman:|To capitulate is one step closer to fruition.
{106198}{106260}{y:i}Under intense pressure from the|clinton administration,
{106261}{106312}{y:i}a russian delegation|flew to belgrade
{106313}{106367}{y:i}to deliver an ultimatum to|president milosevic...
{106368}{106433}{y:i}"remove all troops from kosovo
{106434}{106492}{y:i}or risk losing the support|of boris yeltsin,"
{106493}{106557}{y:i}his one remaining ally.
{106901}{106945}- right away, sir.|- Thank you.
{107057}{107131}{y:i}Man: this job would become,|in not so many years... -
{107132}{107215}{y:i}...a far more substantial one than|the government now pretends.
{107216}{107256}{y:i}Seen as the president of europe
{107257}{107311}{y:i}by the rest of the world... -
{107472}{107518}tony.
{107519}{107585}The yugoslav parliament|has conceded.
{107586}{107646}All serbian troops are to|be immediately withdrawn.
{107647}{107735}A nato-led peacekeeping force|is to be deployed in the region.
{107736}{107801}Kosovo is to be placed under u.|N. administration.
{107802}{107864}Of course clinton will|claim it was his strategy,
{107865}{107914}that forced milosevic's hand.|We'll claim it was ours,
{107915}{107983}but either way now, it's over.
{107984}{108049}We've won. you've won.
{108377}{108453}This is a victory for civilization.
{108454}{108549}A victory for a|fundamental principle
{108550}{108604}necessary for humanity's progress:
{108605}{108657}That every human being
{108657}{108760}has the inalienable right to|live free from persecution.
{108801}{108888}Milosevic knows and|the world now knows
{108889}{108981}we will not tolerate|racial genocide.
{108981}{109018}Hear hear.
{109019}{109076}Let no one ever doubt again
{109077}{109118}the moral justification
{109119}{109168}for invading another country
{109169}{109230}for humanitarian ends.
{109494}{109585}{y:i}Woman on tv: here on the roads of|kosovo they cheer his name.
{109586}{109671}{y:i}But tony blair was always going|to get a hero's welcome.
{109672}{109724}Tony! tony! tony!
{109761}{109834}{y:i}Man on tv: and indeed those|polls have closed
{109835}{109878}{y:i}and the first lady of the|united states of america,
{109879}{109935}{y:i}hillary rodham clinton,|has defeated
{109936}{109978}{y:i}congressman rick lazio
{109979}{110033}{y:i}and will become the junior|senator from new york.
{110034}{110100}Al gore and george w bush|are men in waiting today.
{110100}{110159}We still don't know who|won the presidency.
{110160}{110210}{y:i}We may not know until tomorrow.
{110211}{110266}{y:i}Woman #2: as controversy|rages in washington,
{110267}{110324}{y:i}president clinton,|accompanied by his wife,
{110324}{110396}{y:i}headed to the british prime|minister's country residence.
{110397}{110455}{y:i}A farewell celebration|between the two men
{110456}{110508}{y:i}whose shared political|philosophy...
{111303}{111368}oh, i'm so sorry.|I really do have to take this.
{111369}{111423}{y:i}- tony: of course.|- What did i get?
{111424}{111473}"environment and public works"?
{111474}{111528}What happened to foreign|relations and budget?
{111528}{111589}{y:i}- those were the things...|- I think i'll turn in.
{111590}{111644}Excuse me.
{111645}{111696}Well, i just can't get over
{111696}{111748}how much those kids have grown.
{111748}{111826}- good night, tony.|- Good night.
{112392}{112430}Bill.
{112472}{112517}While we've...
{112518}{112579}Got a moment, i'd like to...
{112623}{112676}Well, i'd like to apologize to you
{112677}{112732}for what happened over kosovo,
{112733}{112807}briefing against you|in your own media.
{112837}{112904}I was out of order.|In the years i've known you,
{112905}{112955}you've been a good|friend to me, personally,
{112956}{113020}you've been a loyal|friend to my party
{113021}{113071}and a great ally to this country.
{113072}{113134}In the end i got all the credit,
{113135}{113189}credit we should've shared.
{113190}{113227}It was wrong.
{113252}{113292}I was wrong.
{113293}{113350}I'm sorry.
{113351}{113425}That's bullshit.|You don't mean a word of that.
{113468}{113524}- - hey,|you saw the papers
{113524}{113579}the weekend after|milosevic withdrew...
{113580}{113640}Seven out of 10 americans|said they'd like
{113641}{113679}to have tony blair|as their president.
{113680}{113768}{y:i}Handsome, energetic, churchgoing,
{113769}{113867}morally upstanding,|maritally faithful.
{113932}{113985}Are you sure you weren't|born in america?
{113986}{114027}Huh. scotland.
{114028}{114098}Well, that too bad,|'cause you'd win by a landslide.
{114173}{114262}Good evening. the opera,|at times farce, is over.
{114263}{114304}The fat lady has sung.
{114305}{114347}{y:i}The final supreme court verdict
{114348}{114387}{y:i}has persuaded al gore to give up.
{114388}{114450}{y:i}He's finally accepted that|his long legal battle
{114451}{114524}{y:i}- has nowhere else to go.|- Let there be no doubt
{114525}{114611}{y:i}while i strongly disagree|with court's decision,
{114611}{114676}i accept it. and tonight,
{114677}{114719}{y:i}for the sake of our unity|as a people,
{114719}{114769}{y:i}and the strength of our mocracy...
{114770}{114830}{y:i}i offer my concession.
{114875}{114984}Prime minister,|you asked to be woken.
{114985}{115027}Thank you.
{115440}{115510}<i- >- - thanks again. - george w.|Our country has been through
{115511}{115564}a long and trying period,
{115565}{115655}with the outcome of the|presidential election not finalized
{115656}{115730}{y:i}for longer than any of us|could ever imagine.
{115731}{115785}{y:i}- after a difficult election...|- Thanks.
{115786}{115833}{y:i}...we st put politics behind us
{115834}{115911}{y:i}and work together to make the|promise of america
{115912}{115991}{y:i}available for every one|of our citizens.
{115992}{116075}Our nation must rise|above a house divided.
{116075}{116161}Americans share hopes,|goals and values
{116162}{116199}far more important
{116199}{116253}{y:i}than any political disagreements.
{116254}{116333}{y:i}I have a lot to be thankful|for tonight,
{116334}{116403}and thankful to the american|people for the great privilege
{116404}{116456}of being able to serve
{116457}{116503}as your next president.
{116503}{116556}{y:i}-
{116641}{116687}what are you going to do
{116688}{116739}with bush?
{116789}{116839}I know what everyone|wants me to do...
{116840}{116886}Back off,
{116887}{116959}concentrate on domestic politics,
{116960}{117036}deepen ties with europe.
{117037}{117090}That's not what i asked you.
{117091}{117139}{y:i}What do you want to do?
{117181}{117256}I still want to get|things done, bill.
{117257}{117368}And i know he's not on the|same team as us, but...
{117394}{117437}{y:i}i'd rather be in the room
{117438}{117479}where the big decisions|are being made
{117480}{117547}than outside it,|whingeing about them.
{117651}{117737}I would be the senior partner now.
{117738}{117779}Bush would be the junior.
{117780}{117851}I could help him|like you helped me,
{117851}{117909}{y:i}advise him.
{117943}{118003}I just want to do the right|thing for my country.
{118031}{118087}Are you sure about that?
{118115}{118168}It's in my country's|best interests,
{118169}{118206}quite possibly the world's,
{118207}{118250}for me to stay close to|the american president.
{118251}{118313}Well, you can sure|move your bones...
{118314}{118380}Continue to use the white house|to stay in the spotlight,
{118381}{118423}consolidate yourself as leader
{118423}{118462}and expand your legacy.
{118463}{118513}I'm not sure how|to take that, bill.
{118514}{118548}That felt vaguely like an insult.
{118549}{118596}Well, it's true, isn't it?
{118597}{118651}I mean, come on. we both know
{118651}{118700}that the best way to ensure|that you're remembered
{118701}{118740}50 or 100 years from now
{118741}{118806}is to link yourself to|an american president.
{118807}{118879}But be careful.
{118879}{118963}These guys, they play rough.
{118964}{119047}{y:i}Their administration
{119048}{119136}has been born in controversy,|national shame
{119137}{119207}and illegality. and it is my bet
{119208}{119270}that that's the way they'll go out.
{119298}{119379}So the question you|need to ask yourself is
{119379}{119427}what business
{119428}{119494}does a progressive|center-left politician
{119495}{119552}from a tiny little|island in europe have
{119553}{119611}making friends with|folks like that?
{119647}{119691}But then again...
{119691}{119751}{y:i}i'm not sure whether you are
{119751}{119824}a progressive center-left|politician anymore...
{119875}{119931}Or if you ever were.
{120024}{120076}{y:i}I'm gonna say good night.
{120077}{120150}{y:i}I might sleep late.|I hope you don't mind.
{120150}{120197}{y:i}I'm tired. i need the rest.
{120251}{120298}Go ahead.
{120323}{120376}Sleep as long as you like.
{120377}{120459}{y:i}...but to serve one nation.|The president of the united states
{120460}{120509}{y:i}is the president of every|single american.
{120557}{120615}The tower is awaiting our call.
{120853}{120920}{y:i}- 10 minutes, everyone.|- Man #2: are we flight go?
{120921}{120971}{y:i}Yeah, we've got clearance.
{120972}{121025}{y:i}Man #3: clear here?
{121231}{121306}Me too, george. absolutely. me too.
{121461}{121533}Yeah. well...
{121690}{121769}- when are you going to be sworn in?|- In three weeks.
{121770}{121849}After eight years with the|title and no portfolio,
{121850}{121896}finally you'll have both.
{121896}{121956}Let me know what it's like...
{121956}{122000}Waking in the morning,
{122001}{122057}knowing that you're|speaking for yourself.
{122058}{122130}- i will.|- In you go, senator!
{122131}{122179}Oh, bill. for heaven's sakes.
{122180}{122223}Just practicing, hon.
{122224}{122260}{y:i}Isn't she something?
{122261}{122336}Only first lady in u.s.|History to win elected office.
{122337}{122402}Euan, kathryn, behind the wall.
{122403}{122440}- right, that's it.|- Up you go.
{122440}{122508}{y:i}Back into the house,|because if you're...
{122508}{122584}so after our little talk,|did you decide which way to jump yet?
{122628}{122666}Hug 'im close, go for glory
{122667}{122735}or do the right thing|and head for home?
{122736}{122784}Not yet.
{122822}{122872}Well, i guess i'll have to|be like everybody else...
{122872}{122928}Just watching the press|conference on tv,
{122929}{122992}scrutinizing the body|language for telltale signs.
{122993}{123055}I guess you will.
{123080}{123126}I guess so.
{123382}{123445}- goodbye, tony.|- Goodbye, mr. president.
{123581}{123640}{y:i}Right face!
{123928}{123981}Yeah, he's just leaving now.
{123982}{124038}Yeah, i've got it in hand. yeah.
{124267}{124332}Yeah. yeah, okay.
{124333}{124393}All right, i'll see you then.
{124394}{124467}All right, get ahold of john|and tell him to bring...
{125073}{125168}It's my honor to welcome|the prime minister
{125168}{125238}from our strongest|friend and closest ally
{125239}{125289}to camp david.
{125318}{125372}We've had a couple|of formal visits.
{125373}{125452}More importantly, we've had a|nice walk around camp david
{125452}{125507}and gotten to know each other.
{125540}{125615}As they've told me,|he's a pretty charming guy.
{125616}{125680}He put the charm offensive on me.
{125681}{125756}<i- >- - and it worked.
{125757}{125803}{y:i}A question for both of you.
{125804}{125854}{y:i}There's been a lot said

When I hear the term “grindhouse,” what I think of is Hollywood Boulevard in the ‘70s—very much like 42nd
Street New York in the ‘70s.
42nd Street, in its heyday, was a collection of about a dozen cinemas, all contained within one block.
When you would go into these theatres, there was an ever-present feeling of danger.
There was a murder there, one night, and so people, there was a big pandemonium and I'm still sitting there, I wanna see the movie, I don't wanna leave.
I did I stayed, the police came in, they never turned on the house lights.
"We're at the Bijoux Theatre, where it's reported that a man has gone beserk while watching a double-feature horror program.
If you ever saw the movie
Midnight Cowboy, that probably had the best depiction of 42nd
Street I ever saw in a film.
Because that really was what it was all about; it was either people watching movies, or having their own party in the theatre.
Grindhouse? It's like did you ever see Pinocchio, Disney's Pinocchio?
There's a wonderful thing in Disney's
Pinocchio where Pinocchio is kidnapped and goes off to this island-Pleasure Island and there's this guy with a derby and a cigar, and he's barking.
He's at a podium and he's saying, "The rough house!
Go inside, boys, it's the rough house!"
And that's what I like about it, it's sheer hucksterism.
A grindhouse is a theater that never closes.
Are grindhouse films and exploitation the same? Ahh, not really
Some theaters would show all day and all night and they weren't showing, questionable marginal material, they were showing regular films.
In the late 40s there were probably only about 100 theaters in the United States that you could classify as "grindhouses".
And so I think it's in the 1960s and the 1970s that you begin to see that association with, inner city urban theaters aka grindhouses and exploitation.
Exploitation basically means; there is an element that you can exploit.
Now whether it’s nudity, or sex or violence or a monster or just an idea, a lot of exploitation it's just how outragreous is the idea.
It's something to take advantage of in promotion.
It's, it's a hook to get them into the theater...
"No one admitted except at the beginning!"
I'm happy to join the management of the this theater.
"YOU will take an unforgettable journey down deep into the dungeons of hell!"
Why was this girl chosen to be tortured?
This motion picture is a vicious expose of a part of a young generation.
Im gonna give you the time of your life, baby.
Scenes ofsuch brutal honesty will be shown on this screen. Attention hungry housewives.
A mixture of tender romance and pornographic realism.
If you were smart, you'll keep away from prostitutes and pick-ups.
They're not safe.
And they can't be made safe.
"That's a good shot. - "Knock-out!"
- I'm a woman! And I'll do as I please!
"The shocking scenes that you are about to see, are not suggested for the weak.
Soon at this theater.
They'll be coming together.
"Here's your chance to see all the bad…"
"Ask not what your country can do for you…"
#AMERICAN GRINDHOUSE#
And remember: Get more out of life. Go out to a movie.
#IN THE BEGINNING
FROM EDISON TO FREAKS#
You could say that exploitation is as old as the movies themselves.
Thomas Edison's company was making films around the turn of the 20th century.
So there's always been this sort of element of exploitation in the film business from its very earliest days.
You know the old joke goes that as soon as the movie camera was invented, expliotation started like 5 seconds later, somebody said to his girlfriend, Would you mind taking your clothes off for the camera?
That is the story of exploitation in the cinema.
Now that we have a way to make a permanent record of all of this.
What is it what we want to record.
And by and large that they wanted to record was stuff that was taboo.
Exploitation and the dawn of the motion picture went hand in hand.
Many of Thomas Edison's films from the beginning of the 20th Century were widely considered excessive, salacious, and prurient in content.
Thomas Edison's company helped pave the way for the exploitation film by simply catering to audience’s tastes.
- You know PT Barnum was a genius.
Part of his genius was just giving people what they wanted.
Combining the sensationalism of
PT Barnum and the innovation of
Edison's moving picture camera, the first feature length exploitation film was released on November 24th, 1913.
Traffic in Souls, in a lot of ways, sort of established the prototype for exploitation films.
During the time around there were these tremendous scares in the United States, in big cities, about the so-called "white slave" traffic, prostitution, forced prostitution.
These tracks usually found-universally found that this traffic didn't really exist, but it captured the popular imagination, and eventually George Lone Tucker a director who was working at Universal put together this film called Traffic in Souls, which traded on the sensational aspects of the white slave scare.
Traffic in Souls was made for $57,000.
It would gross a staggering
$450,000 during its theatrical run, and would place Universal
Pictures firmly on the map as one of the major players in the blossoming movie industry.
The film was one of the first feature films made in the United States.
It promised tremendous things in its advertising: hundreds of scenes and a cast of thousands and so on, plus this really sensational topic, none of which it really delivered on.
In, you know, good old exploitation fashion.
Exploitation movies flourished in Hollywood during the transition from
Silent films to Talkies.
In the Pre-Code Era, the motion picture industry was often viewed as a hotbed of moral depravity.
Even today, it's easy to see why many of these films raised eyebrows.
Pre Code Hollywood in the 1930s.
When you discover them it's kind of like discovering exploitation films, because you're seeing things that you can't believe you're seeing.
There were always woman changing, taking their clothes off, you can see nipples.
To me they're not really like exploitation films.
To me, they sort of like realistic depictions of what was going on in American life because people were really screwed up.
People want to see these things on camera they want to see sex, they wanna see violence, they wanna see drugs.
You know, I think it's important to remember that in the late teens, the early 1920s, movies had only been around twenty, twenty-five years.
They were a very young industry.
They were very susceptible to all sorts of public pressure.
In 1920, Hollywood begins to go through this series of scandals.
So by 1922, there's tremendous pressure on Hollywood to clean up its act, that people are thinking this is just a Sodom and Gomorrah on the west coast.
And so finally, the heads all get together, and they decide that they're going to bring in Will Hays.
Will Hays is the Postmaster General, he's kind of a Republican stalwart, he's an elder in the
Presbyterian church, and they say,
"Will Hays, come out here, come to work for us, and help us clean up our image."
"To the Warner Brothers to whom this due credit, for this, the beginning of a new era in music and motion pictures.
I offer my solicitations and my sincerest appreciations."
This had to be like the cushiest job in the entire film industry, right?
Something like $100 thousand dollars a year during the depression!
"Service is the supreme commitment to life.
It can be argued that the day the
Hollywood Production Code was established the real exploitation film industry was born.
The Code really did create exploitation films much like Prohibition created speakeasies so you really had to go of your way to find these pictures.
The Hays Code created all of these sort of carnie "shysters".
But before the Production Code would be strictly enforced, one more major Hollywood film would test the boundaries of acceptable tastes and would ironically, become one of the most infamous films ever released on the exploitation circuit.
MGM, after Dracula and Frankenstein they said we have to make a horror picture.
And you know, we're Metro, we're the best so therefore we will make the best horror picture.
And they hired Tod Browing who made Dracula and he made Freaks.
Freaks is an MGM picture it's well produced.
It is a really good movie but they got more than they bargained for.
Freaks may be the most shocking and controversial film ever released during the pre-Code era.
Browning's choice to cast real life circus oddities caused an outrage resulting in a backlash that cost the studio $160,000 in ticket sales.
Although today, it is widely considered to be the director's masterpiece, the release of Freaks effectively put an end to Tod Browning's prosperous career.
It was released during the so-called "Pre-Code" period, before the production code was really being enforced.
And MGM sort of immediately cans it, you know puts it on the shelf but some years later, exploitation entrepaneur
Dwain Esper got the rights to Freaks and gave it a second life during the 1940s and into the 1950s by releasing it on the exploitation circuit.
#LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN...
SEE OUR MOVIE#
Before licensing Freaks from MGM, director Dwain Esper made the early grind house film, Maniac.
Loosely inspired by Edgar
Allen Poe's The Black Cat and taking various cues from
Universal horror films of the time,
Maniac was written by
Espier's wife, Hildegard, and produced during the summer of 1934.
A benchmark in the evolution of exploitation,
Maniac represents the classical age of exploitation films which prospered during
The Great Depression.
The exploitation filmmakers, they weren't showing in
Hollywood owned theaters.
They existed completely outside the law. with its emphasis on sex and violence, maniac also established a blueprint for subsequent exploitation films in which it's production quality took a back seat to the required doses of graphic content.
Dwain Esper was interesting because the films that he made were really amazingly awful.
But they were movies that drew audiences.
The films of Dwain
Esper and others like him represent a group of nomadic independent filmmakers and distributors who traveled the country in the 1930s and peddled the virtues of cinematic sin to thrill seeking audiences.
Affectionately known as The 40
Thieves, these carnie road show men had little regard for proper business ethics and stopped at nothing to make a quick buck.
Grind house movies and exploitation movies were the domain of kind of fly by night independents who swooped in and gave the public what they really wanted, but they had to do it in marginal little cracks in cities and rural areas where they'd find a place to show this stuff.
Just pitch a tent or find a theater that wasn't part of the Hollywood system where they could just grind away.
One of the key things about exploitation movies during this time was thay they were virtually always shown for Adults Only.
Hollywood films were for everyone, but these films by having that "adults only" told people that this was something different this is something out of the ordinary. This was something that I'm not going to see when I go down to see that MGM film or that 20th Century Fox film.
There's going to be something you know maybe a little special in this movie.
Many of the exploitation films released by The 40 Thieves reveled in the sensationalism of true crime.
Take for example police sherrif Louis Sonney.
After achieving nationwide publicity for his apprehension of train robber Roy Gardner in 1921,
Sonney was convinced to re-create the capture of Gardner for his first film,You Can't Beat The Rap!
"Well, goodbye Roy.
- Good luck"
Sonney was the sherif of
Centralia Washington and actually tracked him down, caught him, arrested him in a hotel up there.
"Mr Sonney, I don't how to begin to thank you for all you've done…"
They initally started with live appearances, where he and Roy Gardner would appear together.
This established this wonderful tradition in exploitation of; it's okay to talk about all this stuff that's off limits, it's okay for crime to pay and long as in the end everyone gets their cumuppins.
So as long as in the end,
Roy Gardner is in shackles and is testifying to never get involved in crime it's all okay.
"I paid the hard way…"
But in the mean time you can exploit all the stuff that's off limits.
That was essential to how these things opperated and Louis Sonney was the guy who originally did that.
And that became the way exploitation filmmakers got around the criticism of what they were doing.
But we're mearling offering lessons in morality.
Some people did go hoping to learn something about either drug use or child birth, or whatever the case happened to be.
#IT'S NOT VULGAR...
IT'S EDUCATIONAL#
"It happens to the rich. It happens to the poor, perhaps to your own son or daughter!
When a girl faces disgrace, many times the parent are at faulty.
Trying to keep today's teenagers innocent through ignorance, it simply will not work!
Too many learn the hard way.
Your girl or boy could be the next victim of unwed motherhood or VD bring them to see the truths and learn facts, facts, facts before it's too late!
At that point in history and maybe even today, alot of guys didn't stand in the room when their wives gave birth and if they did, they didn’t stand down on the business end.
You know, guys used to pace in the waiting room, waiting, waiting, waiting for somebody to tell them what kind of kid they had.
And you're, your're right it was just something that most people even people who had children had never seen.
"Love may be the most beautiful or most dangerous thing in the world.
But it is never a thing to be gigled about or fouled with dirty stories.
Child birth is a sacred thing.
Exploitation films during this sort of classical era were obviously selling titilation on the one hand, but on the other hand they were also selling education.
This is the why a lot of these films, kind of got a way with it.
Now lets consider that other public enemy, gonereha an arch criminal with a half dozen vulgar alias' such as "The Clap",
"The Dose", "The Gleet", "The
Strain" or "The Running Range"!
This was information that was hidden away from a lot of people and these movies were providing that information at least to some extent.
So, particularly of the sex hygeine films often the audience was largley made up of women who had no other way of getting this kind of information
The birth of a baby stuff, you had almost a protective shield around you.
You know Dave Friedman used to call tent evangelists they called them 'sky grifters' because they'd get a big tent and it was almost just like a carnival.
The guy was using God to fleece you of whatever your money was, he had a perfect cover. And that's what the birth of a baby movies and stuff was, it was the perfect cover for people who might be a little seedy to come in and be respectable and still show you something that had they approached it in a different factor they, they probably would have been run out of town on a rail.
Perhaps the most infamous of all "birth of a baby" films was 1945's Mom and Dad.
Produced and distributed by Kroeger
Babb, the film was direeted by
William "One Shot" Beaudine in just six days and on a budget of $63,000.
It would go on to become the third highest grossing film of the decade.
Mom and Dad had a lecturer, named Elliot Forbes the eminant hygience commentator Elliot Forbes who would travel with the roadshow units, now this of course meant you had like 15 Elliot Forbes in the United States criss-crossing the nation at any given time.
"See Mom and Dad. You'll be glad you did.
Children under 16 must be in adult company.
See Mom and Dad"
While films like Mom and Dad continued to appear on Grindhouse cirquit adult themes were still being addressed in the studio films of the 1940s.
The Production Code forced filmmakers to creatively depict sexuality and violence in a much more subtle approach.
The result was a style of motion pictures known today as film noir.
Have'nt you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
What else is there that I can buy you with?
I've thought about whether there was any kind of connection between grindhouse cinema and film noir and in reality there is.
What's the matter, aren't you going to kiss me?
Both of these type of films specialize in adult themes.
The difference of course is that in film noir the artists making these movies had to find creative ways to express all this stuff within the constraints of the Production Code.
The grindhouse guys, just showed it.
Grindhouse theaters flourished in red-light districts and skid row sections of major cities by the mid-20th century; an image that was illustrated in this film from 1941…
Probably the best representation of a grindhouse in a mainstream Hollywood film is in "I Wake Up Screaming".
You know it doesn't seem very well mainted, people are in there because they're sleeping, they are spending the night in the theater becuase they have no place else to go.
It's a very interesting depiction of what a grindhouse is, that you didn't see too often in a mainstream movie.
The depiction of a grindhouse theater in "I Wake Up Screaming" may have been a sign that the Production Code was loosing touch with American audiences.
By the 1950s, the portraial of adult themes in mainstream movies would change once again
In 1948 you finally had the prosecution that had been brough by the Justice Department.
It ends with a Supreme Court decision known as The Paramount Decision.
That meant - for the Majors - that they no longer had a garanteed place to show their movies, they bassically had to begin to compete in a much more open market place.
And that's when I think the exploitiers thought:
Our days may be numbered here.
If they start letting Hollywood do these movies, what are we going to do?
The Paramount decision bassically means that the Production Code, begins to fall apart because there is really no way to enforce it any more.
Once the Production Code begins to fall apart that means
Hollywood begins to gradually take on these more adult suject matters.
This is the 19 year-old Baby Doll.
She wouln't let her husband come near her.
She wouldn’t let the stranger go away.
Why Mr. Vicarro. You certainly are getting familiar.
For the sort of old line exploitiers and The 40 Thives, that was bad news, because a lot of the topics that they had pursued for years, gradually become the province of Hollywood.
#PERVERSION...
FOR PROFIT#
After World War II, sex became a little more acceptable.
It was recognized that at least pin-up and cheesecake art and all of that was really a big moral booster during the war.
And so burlesque became a more acceptable form of entertainment
I don't think people realize just prevelent striptease and burlesque was in our country.
We are in such a prudish, puritanical moment right now I think people forget that there's always been the grind, theres always been strip, there's always been this side of American showbusiness.
The term bump and grind' was lifted from the burlesque stage and as many of the nation's red light districts burlesque houses made the transition to movie houses the term grindhouse came with it.
This change in venues paid off handsomely for the theater owners, but it was another story for the stripping starlets.
And then a lot of producers in grindhouses understood that the economic benefits of filming burlesque acts and finding venues in which they could show the films was a lot cheaper then sending women around on the circuits
That was just you know, mana from heaven for the exploiters because they could get Lili St. Cyr and Tempest Storm and all these popular burlesque artists to do a film.
And quite frankly I think these women undersold themselves because they didn't understand this new quote en quote technology an issue that still exists to this day; where they said yeah, ok fine you wanna film me doing my act, so what?
And they didn't understand that, that was going to cut deeply into their ability to make money as a live performer.
And then little by little, once burlesuqe was acceptabe, then it just became the inevitable flood.
I mean how long the the damn going to hold at that point.
Kiss me quick
And it was like, how much skin can you actually show?
Besides adapting the tradition of burlesque to exploitation, many of the grindhouse filmmakers turned to the world of men's magazines as a source for insperation.
And as the 50's progressed with relaxed attitudes toward sex, there was serious opposition from concenred organizations as evidensed in this propaganda film produced by
The Citizens for Decent Literature.
And then we come to nudist magazines.
If they were printed only the nudist cult, they would never exist.
Group exposure is a hallmark of these cultists.
However it's been well stated that very few blind people join the nudist colony.
Nudist camp movies hit their peak in the post war era with Walter Bibo’s The Garden of Eden.
Released in 1954, the film stirred up a considerable amount of controversy.
When The Garden of Eden appears in the mid 1950s, it was also during this much more, seemingly conservative and buttoned down period.
It drew a lot of attention, it also drew a fare amount of censorship activity.
Eager and ready to challenge the censorship issue that faced his film,
Bibo took his case to the New
York court of appeals and won.
What that meant was you could show people naked on screen, they just couldn't be engaged in sex.
Encouraged by Bibo's court room triumph, exploitation filmmakers jumped on the bandwagon and pumped out a plethora of nudist camp movies, each more cheeky than the last.
It was a very innocent sort of film where people just kind of walked around, threw a ball here and there and this and that.
And again, much like the birth of a baby films, they promoted it as a healthy lifestyle you know sunshine and fresh air, people with a high moral fiber who just happend to be walking around naked.
But what you really buy is a ticket to see a bunch of people, walking around naked and mostly girls I hope.
#TEENAGE...
RAMPAGE#
And so another job, for the police and the courts.
Johny Marvin is now in the hands of the law.
This is the first time he's been caught, but his delinquent tendancies began long before in the conflicts of an unhappy home and in the hangout of the gang which was his refuge
By the mid 1950s, teenagers were growing up in a world with more progressive attitudes toward sex.
I love you, Jim.
I really mean it.
As the American teenager clashed with the conservatiove morals of the older generation their stories of anger and rebellion found their way to the silver screen.
Teen movies have always been around, if you go as far back as
Wild Boys On The Road from the 1930s.
Ahh, heck.
- Hey whats the matter?
Somebody stole our gas, c'mon!
But they didn't really explode until the 1950s.
And I think a lot of it had to do with teenagers living in the suburbs, they had disposable incomes, they had cars.
Rock'n'roll certainly had a large part of it.
Say, they ain't made are they? - No, that's just the ways kids are dancing nowadays.
They call it rock n rolling, or bop or something like that.
You know generally it was that you were not understood by your parents, you were not understood by your school.
I suppose you're going out again tonight? - Yeah, so what?
You were an outcast in someway.
Johnny and two hundread thousaned other youngsters who are arrested each year, are America's number one crime problem.
In the post war era when things changed, people started thinking of young people differently and there also was a lot of crime.
Young people and crime became a Blackboard Jungle kinda thing.
Blackboard Jungle was a tremendously influential movie.
It was not made as an exploitation film but it performed the same functions.
Dragstrip Riot! Leading to a fight fought with all the fierce fury of youth.
Dangerously angry one minute!
Rockin and rollin the next!
The teen exploitation movies would take a teenage diliema and AIP really knew how to do this well.
AIP was a company, James
Nicholson and Sam Arkoff.
They would make posters and come up with titles.
These were pictures that peoples parents wouldn't go see.
Here's 50 thousand dollars go give us that movie!
They did a lot of crime pictures, they did a lot of juvveile delinquent pictures, they did a lot of horror pictures, science fiction pictures.
All the sort of disreputable genres.
I think a lot of us who came out of the American Independent Movement.
That was the basis for a lot of our work.
It preceeded punk rock and the DIY spirit and they were put together almost the same way punk rock records put together, you know.
Very fast, very cheap, down and dirty, lets get it out there kind of thing.
By the mid-60s, teen exploitation films temporarily diverted their attention to the beach and traded in their pompadours and leather coats for swimming trunks and boogie boards.
The beach movies are so bizarre.
They were really odd.
How do you like this title:
The Behavior Patern of the Young Adult and its
Relation to Primitve Tribe.
I've got a shorter title.
- What's that? - Teenage sex.
The whole point of them was to see tits and ass. But wholesome, tits and ass.
Teen exploitation films represented a major movie market during the 50s and 60s, even though they were not, solely restricted to the confines of Grindhouse theaters.
Teens needed a place that they could see these films, alone, without adults, and the drive in theater provided the perfect escape.
The drive in theaters also showed a lot of the same product, exploitation product.
But they weren't nessesarily grind, I don't consider those grind.
What they were interested in was the teenage market.
By the time of the drive in movies and films like I Was A Teenage Werewolf.
He turns into this monster!
Talk about hairy palms.
They specifically were gearing for adolescent, hormonal, horny boys and girls.
So they wanted to go after them and they went after them with whatever was popular at the time
Now they make Hostel, they make these torture porn movies for kids, but then…
These pictures all have a lot to say and they're all very interesting.
Most of them are shit, but every so often theres a good one.
Along with the proliferation of teen exploitation films, new ways of depictions of sex in exploitation cinema were also finding their way into the market place.
But upon closer investigation, it would appear that both of these markets may have shared a common audience.
How many times have I told you not to walk around the house like that!
- But dad, it's only a slip.
You heard what I said! No go upstairs and put something on. - But dad.
You know, I'm not really sure how many people actually went to go the the
Beach Party movies, because when I was a kid we all thought they were square.
I think they were actually aimed at adults! You know Sam Arkoff was the guy.
No, no, it's the teenage market we don't need money in these old tired stars.
And what do you see Buster Keaton! All of a sudden, the Beach Party movies, they were supposed to be aimed at kids and they started bringing Silent
Film stars out of retirement.
Please?
What kid would go see that?
But my father might?
- Papaya Surprise - Papaya Surprise?
Lord Love a Duck with Tuesday Weld.
Have you seen this movie?
No? Oh my God!
She's a High Schooler is is trying on sweaters with her father, who is getting sexually while she's saying things like
Perrywinkle Pussycat.
Don't you just love it!
- Masterpiece film.
#SEXPLOITATION
FROM NUDIE CUTIES TO ROUGHIES#
In 1959, director Russ
Meyer took the sex film and the celebration of female nudity onscreen a step further.
Both voyeuristic and comical,
Meyer's The Immoral Mr. Teas was the incarnation of a critical though short lived style of exploitation movie.
Russ invented the Nudie Cutie
Besides placing naked women in a contemporary setting outside of the nudist camps,
The Immoral Mr. Teas featured something that nobody else had ever thought a plot.
The Immoral Mr. Teas had a plot and in that plot there were situations with naked girls.
The nudit cuties were very, very innocent and they were basically like pin up calendars come to life.
Russ is very influential to that he made a movie with a plot.
Kinda like The Great Train
Robbery, Edwin S. Porter.
These movies and their importance to the history of cinema and narrative filmmaking
Russ is that way to the history of porno, because he made those Nudie Cuties.
Nudie cuties were unashamed in their depictions of nudity on screen.
The girls were plentiful and the storylines equally ridiculous.
But as the cycle of “nudie cuties” continued to proliferate, a darker and more sinister style of film was also about to emerge.
Get up!
- Get away from her!
When the violence was added, they were later called roughies
“Roughies” were just that: rough, violent, and raw.
These films offered a startling and uncompromising view of the battle between the sexes; a dramatic contrast to the sexual revolution that lay ahead.
You can certainly see elements of what are often referred to as the Roughies in movies as early as Violated from 1953 and The Lonely Sex from later on in the 50s.
Like nudist camp magazines that inspired those films, the “roughies” were adapted from men's pulp magazines.
Take a look at what they are reading.
Go on, they won't even know you're there.
You had Men's Magazines, you know that kind of fixated on these notions of women in danger; tied up and lashed.
It's pulled from the dark ressess of peoples minds, ya know.
And predominetly men.
No please, no.
That these were the male fantasies that were turned into movies
When these kinda pictures started to play, again when I was in Philidelphia there were always at theaters that would run pictures like Olga's House of
Shame and stuff like that.
These pictures were they had a clientele, they were pretty popular.
The Roughies grew out of the Nudie Cutie.
And they're ugly, they're ugly movies really.
Discovering a squeeler amoung her girls,
Olga cuts out a part of a girls tongue as a warning to the others.
More than just the next phase in sexploitation films the “Roughies” represented a deeper shift in the nation's subconscious.
You could say that roughies developed because the culture got really violent.
1963 was really the end of the 50s.
In the grindhouse come these movies, the Roughies where no longer are the women on a pedestal as objects of adoration.
They're things to be beaten and whipped into submission.
That kind of product as it was called was just not thought of in the same breath as the kind of things that played in normal theaters.
Films like The Lusting Hours, directed by The Amero brothers, helped to establish New York City as a major player in the sexploitation film industry.
Featuring the likes of husband and wife team Mike and Roberta Findley and Doris Wishman the roughies that emerged from New York during the 1960s offer a glimpse into the world of Times Square,
42nd Street and the grindhouse theater lifestyle.
The movies coming out of New York were cranked out like sausages.
They were being made by people who were just going out, making a movie maybe over the course of a few weekends or so.
They, they really have this kind taste, this sort of flavor of New York in the 1960s
Once in a great while, a sensational and starkly realistic motion picture comes to the screen.
This whole different type of film developed where the sex was really intense.
And a huge part of the reason for this, I believe, is because you could not show sex on screen.
So you had to show a substitute.
And violence was the substitute.
#GORE-GALORE#
Following their production of a series of nudist camp movies, two men
Hershell Gordon Lewis and Dave
Friedman produced what is now often regarded as the archetypal
“Roughie”, Scum of The Earth.
That same year, the duo stumbled upon an idea for a new kind of movie and the world of exploitation would never be the same again.
Scum of The Earth was a transitional picture.
It was the last picture I ever shot in black and white.
Well it became clear after a while that this particular kind of motion picture that was getting into a field that was terribly crowded because the number of theaters that would play it, that number was quite limited.
And the number of competitors, well they were beginning to swarm
I began to think they could fill Yankee Stadium.
The question then became the standard question that I ask throughout my what we might laughingly call my feature film career.
What kind of motion picture might there be that the major film companies either will not make or cannot make, but a theater will play and somebody might plop down in a chair to look at.
I was watching some ancient gangster movie on television.
The police shot this fellow full of bullet holes and I said wait a minute as his eyes closed.
I said, that's not right.
And that gave us the idea for that marvelous four letter word
G- O-R-E.
Well the next questions was, what?
And so was born, Blood Feast
We were terrified. I was cutting this thing in my little cutting room in Chicago, and it was to use a euphamism ghastly.
So, we decided to open that movie in Peoria, figuring if we die in Peoria, who will know?
Instantly, it was a gigantic smash.
So Dave and I looked at each other and said
What if we made a decent one?
With Blood Feast and it’s follow up, Two Thousand Maniacs
Friedman and Lewis unleashed a maddening onslaught of lacerated limbs, dismembered maidens and blood hungry hillbillies.
It's really hard to remember, or to imagine for those of us who were not alive.
What it must have been like to see people be eviserated in movies.
Herschel is the genius who first did that.
Oh my God.
And whether you think that his movies are exciting or not exciting.
Great or terrible, they're incredibly fucking important because nobody had ever thought to do that.
I'm not a big fan of Herschel Gordon
Lewis as a filmmaker, but wonderful posters
The campaign is more important than the film itself!
You know, he had this extreme gore but grand
I'll mispronounce it grand guingold how do you say it?
But Grand gingold I'm embarassed.
The french word.
I cannot pronounce grand guignol but I know what it means!
There used to be a theater in Paris for many years, that would stage plays where there were murders and executions and battle scenes with explicit gore.
So the idea of the gore movie, or the gore piece has always been with us.
The key scene in Blood Feast, he reaches into a girls mouth and pulls out her tongue.
And that became that watershed scene that to this day has been, its, its the one that every film biographer who cares about this kind of movie singles out as the scene that changed the course of motion pictures.
The cultural impact of Blood Feast's excessive violence is debatable, but what is clear is the history of contemporary violence in American cinema owes a debt to different film that debuted three years before Blood Feast, was directed by the premiere film artist of his day and released by a major studio.
Well I think the movie would be the movie that changed violence was Psycho.
Everybody after that had the liberation to do what was in their minds based on the success and acceptence of Psycho.
In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock's
Psycho was released.
Utilizing similar marketing tactics that would make The 40 Thieves proud, much of Psycho's success had to do with the advertising methods used to promote the film offering further proof that the distinction between Hollywood and exploitation films boils down to little more than the cost and quality of the individual productions.
So the question begs to be asked is there really much of a difference between these two films?
Other than the fact that somebody using a knife on another person and they're both shot on a motion picture film, I don't see too many great similarities.
In terms of exploitation, I see great similarities between a film like Blood Feast and a movie like Psycho.
Hitchcock's film was pure ballyhoo.
I mean he had a brilliant marketing campain for that.
The entire motion picture indusry knows that
Psycho is being exhibited a special presentation policy.
A creation of Paramount
Pictures showmanship!
Alfred Hitchcock when he makes Psycho, truly he wants every single person in America to see that movie.
I believe that his motivations are almost exactly the same as Friedman and Lewis.
What do these movies have in common? Quite a bit actually
See the movie version that TV didn't dare show! Uncut! Intact!
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
- Ballyhoo, PT Barnum you know.
It's all about getting the suckers in.
#THE TIMES...
THEY ARE A CHANGIN'#
As the 1960s ended, so would
The Hollywood Production Code.
Spanning over thirty years and countless motion pictures, the views of The Production
Code had clearly grown out of touch with the changing times and societal views.
In order to adapt, the studios introduced a new rating system.
This seal is a part of the self-regulation of the Motion Picture Association.
It means that the film displying this seal is within the creative boudries of reason and good judgment.
And that the theaters showing this film, supports the code
And with the changes in the ratings system, came a new and expanded audience.
Orgy, orgy! Have an orgy!
This period in American film history was the most exciting and liberating since the pre-Code era.
I blinked in 1965 and suddenly the 60s appeared.
When I left everybody had short hair, when I came back everybody had long hair, they were smoking dope, the Beatles had just played The Hollywood Bowl.
And everything changed overnight.
With the 1966 film The Wild Angels,
American International
Pictures took the conventions of the previous decade's youth market films and embelished them with a contemporary view to reflect
America's growing counter culture.
Just what is it that you want to do?
- Well we want to be free.
We want to be free to, to do what we want to do. We want to be free to ride.
We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by The Man
And then of course when the sixties came, there were some really intersting political movies. All these movies about the youth generation.
Individual against the collective conforming society and all that.
And in these movies they condemn drugs, drugs are bad.
Unless you're in the movie and then they're pretty good!
During this time, you would see drug movies everywhere.
There's nothing wrong with blowing a grass! - Yeah!
You can do it a thousand times and never go to harder drugs!
I think, the only time
I think I've ever been able to understand myself was on an acid trip.
So even outside of what you were getting in legitimate exploitation cinema, you were getting in your classroom.
If you become a pothead, you risk blowing the most important time of your life
Im Peter Fonda. We've just come back from making a movie, dealing with the most talked about sujects of the day; LSD
Drugs were always around.
Psychadelics didn't really arrive until the late sixties even though there are little traces of psychadellia in The Tingler for instance.
Dave, that drug you brought?
- It's not a drug, it's an acid
The trip he has in that movie is not that interesting to me
The walls! The walls!
The walls!
The exploitation films produced for the youth market during the late sixties featured a mind-numbing array of anarchistic attitudes, sexual freedom, and graphic violence.
Not even the Godfather of Gore himself could resist the allure of a rumbling motorbike.
American International was making biker movies, but their biker movies were all of a pattern.
I thought we could brake that mold by having female bikers who in fact became dominant.
Man Eaters, get those ugly mothers!
There's no question who ran the show in She Devils On Wheels.
And that's why its so funny when someone says some of my movies were sexist, that we take it all out on women and I say
"Ever see She Devils on Wheels?"
In 1969, inspired by the financial success of American International Picture’s earlier biker movies, Columbia
Pictures released Easy Rider.
A film that would eventually come to symbolize the era.
Easy Rider is a picture that exists because of exploitation pictures.
I don’t think that itself it is, because I think it's a message movie.
It does not have a clear western like plot.
It's basically an odyssey.
America's growing opposition to the Vietnam War inspired a number of low budget filmmakers who sprang into action with their own responses.
The result was a handful of angry and nihilistic pictures that now depicted
America’s youth as victims.
Here's the first motion picture two offer, to the daring, a look into the final, maddening space between life and death.
The Last House On The Left.
To avoid fainting, keep repeating:
Its only a movie; Only a movie
You see Last House On The Left is interesting because it is so nasty.
I want you to take the gun. And
I want you to put in your mouth and I want you to blow your brains out! Blow your brains out!
And just in your face sick.
That a studio would have never made that.
You would have never seen that in any way except exploitation.
Growing up in the sixties, nothing was holy anymore.
We were growing up as
Americans and I think probably were experiencing our own history for the first time.
As the 1960s counter culture movement evolved and expanded, evil was no longer restricted to the conventions of low budget monster movies.
Now, in the wake of the
Manson Family murders and Vietnam, the face of fear was human.
I wanted to poke your eyes out while you were feeling it in your gut.
Ya know.
And to cut your dick off while you were smelling roses.
With 1972's The Last House on The
Left, Wes Craven used Swedish director
Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring as a source of inspiration for his first film and as an indirect response to an raging and unpopular war.
I had a subway car empty out on me once, when I was just sitting there.
And this was because all of the posters were up in the subway so God of course people were going to look at the posters and see me there with a fucking knife like this, ya' know and they're gonna go
I gotta get outta here!
Ya' know.
But even an exploitation film with a social message needs a bit of ballyhoo.
Last House's infamous marketing campaign proved successful, if not wholey original.
The promotional tagline "Its Only a
Movie" had in fact alrady been used to market Herschel Gordon Lewis' "Color
Me Blood Red" released 7 years earlier.
You must keep reminding yourself:
It's just a movie; It's just a movie.
The counter culture movement of the late sixties had been immideitly proceeded and inspired by the Civil Rights Movement.
Even before the so-called black exploitation boom of the 1970s, low budget filmmakers had been quick to exploit racial tension in a series of politically charged potboilers, which often remain overlooked when re-counting the evolution of exploitation films.
Movies are reactionary, people don't understand that.
Movies are certainly infuential. But the reality is, its called the business.
They want to sell tickets, so they will make anything
Hitler Eats A Baby they will make anything, if it makes money.
#BLAXPLOITATION
YOU DIG?#
Shaft! Hotter than Bond.
Cooler than Bullit!
They started making a lot of movies for a black audience.
To exploit The Civil Rights movement and the trouble in the country.
C'mon run! Run!
Melvin Van Peebles, who was an avant garde artist and playwright; he made a movie called Sweet
Sweetback's Baaaad Assss Song.
And it was made down and dirty.
It was made the same time I was making Schlock we shared equipment,
I don't know if you knew that.
According to legend, only two theaters in America would agree to play 'Sweet
Sweetback's Badasss Song.
On it's opening night in Detroit, the film broke theater attendance records and would eventually gross over 4 million dollars.
The film's success inspired both exploitation filmmakers and mainstream studios alike to make films that depicted inner city life from a black perspective.
At a time of racial division in
America, inner city audiences rushed to the theaters to see movies that portrayed them in a heroic light.
Eventually the movie industry was forced to sit up and take notice.
And the era of the black hero had arrived
Oooo, Super Fly! Success of the new notion picture Super Fly had brought Ron O'Neal to sudden nation wide attention.
Here he talks about how they made the film in which he takes the title role.
Above all I think we wanted to make a, a film that was realistic in content, realistic in nature.
A black man becomes a hustler, because he is forced into it or led into it by socio-economic force.
Because being a hustler is not a fun thing.
In the days of the chitlin circuit, where you'd make black westerns or whatever it was.
This suddenly, was for black and white audiences.
Hey, what kinda talk is that soul brother?
Don't you know that black is beautiful?
- It was something to be proud of.
I mean to see the black audience seeing their super heros on screen.
It was just amazing. It was just a great time for the black audience because we weren't used to seeing that.
Blaxploitation may have been popular among audiences of all colors, but some critics suggest that these films contributed to cultural stereotypes and, in some cases, even promoted reverse racism.
People criticized Coffy and Foxy Brown for being almost racist from the black point of view?
And my feeling was well why not?
We've been watching racist movies all our lives.
Why not see what it looked like from the other side and enjoy it.
And I thought it was fun.
One actor whose image transcended the characters associated with blaxploitation stereotypes was former
AFL Defensive Back, Fred Williamson.
Never a pimp, never a pusher and always a hero.
Williamson's acting career went well beyond the exploitation market of the 1970s.
Damn brother, you have become one violent dude!
What we needed at the time, were heroes.
We needed physical hereos.
We didn't need, we didn't need creative heroes, we didn't need actors.
We needed somebody saying:
You spray that water on me
If you put those dogs on me, I'm killin' them and when I'm done with them,
I'm gonna kick your ass.
I don't do no singin; I don't do no dancin' and you aint kilin' me and
I'm winning my fights and I'm gonna get that girl - that's it - bottom line.
People like movies about the wrong side of the law, so I didn’t see that Black
Caesar for example was anything different than
Little Ceasar or Pulic Enemy.
When I was a kid, sometimes I liked the second features better than the first ones.
Those pictures meant more to me than the big lavish
MGM movie that played as the main feature.
I liked the second feature better.
So I set out to make a couple of good second features.
Well known for his guerilla style filmmaking
Larry Cohen's productions are notorious not only for their content but also for the bold and occasionally illegal ways in which they were made.
Larry Cohen is a shamless filmmaker.
It was shameless.
It was just to hear that certain audience on 42nd Street go Yeeeeeeah!
From crowded Times Square to the
LAX baggage claim, Cohen rarely if at all sought proper shooting permits to make his movies in public places.
I learned a lot from Larry
Cohen. I learned how to steal shots and how to do big scenes without permits.
When we did the scene in Black Ceasar when I get shot coming out of Tiffany's.
I'm going down the street and everybody they're slowing down and they're looking at me like they don't wanna be involved, who is this idiot down there?
And they see blood. Now for sure they don't want to be involved.
And then I went across the street and I fell on garbage can,
I fell up against the wall; and people just look at me.
Nobody, nobody came by. Finally after all of this which they didn't get on film a cop came by and he says:
Hammer, whachyou doin'?
You shootin a movie here? You gotta a permit. He said, I'm not asking.
I'm walking around the block. I'll be back in 15 minutes. Be gone.
I said, ok but would you mind moving over cause you're in my shot. Just move over a little bit.
As this era drew to a close, many of the black exploitation films moved to parodies of the genre.
These films began to turn away from the social statements that had been incorporated early on and featured more outrageous storylines.
Hide your mamas.
Big brother is comin'.
Well, I feel two ways about it. Its ashame that
African American artists had this small window, into film.
That this was where the majority of African Americans got to work.
And they were all, sort of exploitation movies.
I think it was an incredibly creative time.
So. I found that I had more freedom, within that context. You see thats the other thing about exploitation.
If you deliver the elements of exploitation that's all they care about.
So you're not dealing with people who are cutting you and re-cutting you and casting, you know.
Bassically, he delivers the action, he delivers the nudity, he delivers the gunfight, the, the fist fights, the chases leave him alone.
Within the context of delivering the exploitation, you get to be incredibly free
#THEY CAED THEIR BODIES...
BUT NOT THEIR DESIRES#
Women, locked behind walls of concrete and steel.
Guarded by barbed wire and guns in a tropical hell.
They call it: The Big Dollhouse
In 1970, director Jack
Hill made The Big Dollhouse.
Capitalizing on a decade of civil unrest, the Philippines set action'er transported the tride and true formula of women in prison films to an unnamed banana republic, where forced labor, prostitution and jungle warfare was the name of the game.
Well it was the first real big huge major hit of that type of movie, it wasn't the first film made on that subject matter.
Watch out for her, she likes to wrestle.
Women in prison films have been around a long time.
And those films are pretty sympathic towards women in prison.
Each day the crimal courts condemed scores of unfortunate girls to prisons that need reforming more than the prioners
So when I got back to the states.
Everybody was really excited about the movie.
Which was great because when I read the script I thought it was just horrible
I couldn't, I thought all God what am I going to do with this?
Truthfully when you look at that movie now, it's very sophomoric.
Well, you don't look like a hardened ciminal to me
I don't want to do things for Greer any more. I'd like to do something for you.
And at the same time in a naïve way it was ahead of it's time,
The triumph of The Big Dollhouse was it's depiction of women not only as the central characters, but also the as aggressors.
Get it up, or I'll cut it off
These women confronted Freudian complexities and shed the shackles of a male dominated society albeit while wearing minimal clothing and taking group showers.
Well, well, I have to say that I like naked sweaty women.
So I guess Women In
Prison films, are, are.
I enjoy Women In Prison films.
I don't watch them frequently but if there was a Women
In Prison film playing on 42nd st I'd make a point of seeing it.
Women like to watch other women naked and doing things.
I'm sorry, its something that women like.
Women don't have a problem with it.
Women like it.
Women get turned on by it too.
Wha, what?
Well I wrote The Big Birdcage as a sequel to The Big Dollhouse.
And during the year after The
Big Dollhouse came out it was so widely imitated everybody rushed out with copies of it and even on television and so the only thing I could do was to kinda do a spoof on it and to make fun of the genre in a way but still serious.
In The Big Birdcage, Hill turned the
Women In Prison Film convention on its ear, by having his characters break into the prison and placing the caged women under the watchful eyes of gay prison guards.
Don't play coy with me missy, you don't have anything
I would be interested in anyway - Hi there, Rocco.
You big stud. What's up?
- Nothing's up for you!
We had talked about doing another sequel and I had the idea of a movie called
The Pirate Women of Zambowanga, but the genre kinda cooled off and I didn't want to go back to the Philippines again.
#THE SCHLOCKY...
SEVENTIES#
The Corpse Grinders.
Do you know what this is?
It’s a corpse grinding machine.
I think that probably The Corpse Grinders is the most famous at least in this country.
Corpse Grinders was a big thing here in the United States.
The plot of the film was these two guys that decided that they wanted to make cat food and they couldn't get ingrediants.
Couldn't get enough grain and so on. So they decided well cadavers.
Directed by Ted V. Mikels,
The Corpse Grinders typifies the filmmaker's love for the absurd and ridiculous.
Completely devoid of any socio-political subtext of the time, most of the horror films from the 1970s reflected the true spirit of exploitation; if an audience is curious enough to see something outrageous, then there will always be someone to take the ticket.
A title like Corpse Grinders is something different, unusual.
The Indredible
Two-Headed Transplant!
Written by James Gordon White, The
Incredible Two Headed Transplant mixed the element of carny freak show monstrosities and the Frankenstein mythos for modern horror audiences.
The Incredible Two Headed Transplant was really a send-up of Frankenstein.
At least that’s what I thought, when I was writing it.
It was meant to be just a lite, little horror movie.
Yet everyone just seems to think it's just terrible.
People will sit through most movies.
No matter how shitty.
People will actually.
Well I'm here now!
Dracula Versus Frankenstein!
It'll get better. We've been here an hour and a half, it will get better.
Most of the exploitation films of this era share one simple goal to entertain audiences and therefore, make a buck.
The motion picture industry has always prospered during times of social turmoil and the 1970s was no exception.
Americans will always look for an escape during dark days and storytellers like
Mikels and White prove that the carnie spirit of exploitation will never change.
Overall my movies, I, I never wanted to make the great American movie.
I wanted to entertain and entertain myself while I was working on the script and then hopefully entertain an audience so when the saw the movie.
If you're going to entertain people you've got to grab their attention.
More spine tingling thrills.
More bone crusing terror, terror, terror...
#SEND IN...
THE NAZIS#
The first phase of our operation will be to remove The Messiah
Written by, co-produced and co-starring James Gordon White,
The Tormentors a Nazi versus Jesus action thriller is a rarely mentioned foray into the curious sub-genre of grindhouse cinema known as Nazi Exploitation.
You will have a hard time convincing a lot of people of the inherint Entertainment
Value of Nazi Exploitation films.
The Nazi Exploitation movies to me, the image is of a semi-clad girl, tied to a post being whipped.
And although there was some of that in the 40s, it didn't really take off until the 60s and 70s.
As the years go on and the pictures get more and more graphic, you really start to get beyond any kind of concept of taste, whatsoever.
And the Nazis simply exist as a excuse to for images of horror and degradation, sex and murder.
So you cannot honestly say Don
Edmonds was inspired to make an anti-Nazi film because of his strong political feelings.
Well that movie was a picture that I had been directing stuff.
Again, low budget stuff. I would shoot, in those days you know rent was 85 bucks a month and I couldn't make it and I had balled tires on my car and no gasoline in it anyway so, you know.
Just a broke guy walking around Hollywood.
So I go into the
Intercontinental Hotel on Sunset and here's this guy very distinguished with the grey hair with the thing and the suit and the thing and I meet him in the coffee shop and he says
I'd like you to ah look at our film, you come highly recommended,
I've seen some of your other pictures.
I said 'sure'. I went home and I read "Ilsa: She Wolf of The S.S."
And I'm reading this thing. this is the worst piece of
SHIT I have ever read in my you know I'm going through.
I don't know if I can do this?
I, I…nobody has ever done a film like this.
I've never seen one! Well I said that this is a terrible film.
You can't make it! Its a frontery to everything and man.
And I'm looking at this fucking money man and this guy is dealing cash...CASH!
And then the total whore in me comes out.
There maybe some underlying things that we can that and I signed up.
Heil Hitler!
- Well you know in the ensuing time after
I became this incredible whore and gonna do this movie.
I started looking at it like I bought the job, I gotta do it.
I said I'm gonna go balls out on this thing.
If I've never seen it, than the people have never seen it cause I've seen all this stuff
I thought Don Edomond's Ilsa She Wolf of The S.S. was an amazing movie.
I thought the script was great. I thought it was smart, it was inventive.
But after that, I thought that a lot of the films were uninspired and depressing.
Because, you know, there is only so much you can do with Nazis.
It's like Don Edmonds created the kind of
Hogan's Heroes of
Nazi Prison Camp Movies
The otutlandish Hogan's Heroes spirit in Ilsa: She Wolf of The S.S should come as no surprise while viewing the film, it was in fact filmed on the same sets of the popular television series.
If you're going to be outrageous; be outrageous.
And I did.
#PORN-O-COPIA#
By the 1970s, sex in grindhouse cinema had reached it's climax
Clearly this was all leading up to pornography.
Right? And then it was like, well now that we can actually show sex everything changed.
And then it really became a question of now that you can see it, what is it that you want to see.
And the porn theaters were downtown and in grungy areas and you felt dirty going to 'em
You gotta be kidding me?
This is a dirty movie.
Do you wann see people happily making love on camera?
Or do you still wanna see, the ugly stuff?
The people making the films, the early porn films thought they were really doing something great.
They actually thought there was culturally very, very significant about what they were doing.
That they were liberating the culture from its stayed, old fashioned, puritan ethic.
That lasted only so long.
By the time of Deep Throat. I mean that became a phenomenon where it was respectable almost. I mean everybody went to see Deep Throat.
Lets watch Deep Throat. No time to masterbate, we've got to fornicate.
With the wide theatrical release of Deep Throat in 1972, the business of soft core pornography had essentially ended.
The Amazing Transplant!
While many producers from the classic era of sexploitation continued to produce for time, what they knew best, these filmmakers were eventually either forced to adapt or gracefully bow out of the game.
When Deep Throat opened, it was the gold rush.
Everybody who had access to a 35 mm camera both here on the West Coast and the East Coast were running out and making hardcore porn films, and making tons of money.
This is a culture for salesmen.
And that's what America is all about; the bottom line America is about making money.
Because anything that makes money is good.
It's American. In the terms of the business, a profitable picture, is a good picture.
#THE FINAL GRIND
...OR IS IT?#
And action! - Gun doesn't work. - Cut!
Upon the release of Jaws in 1975, the line between Hollywood blockbuster and drive-in second features had became blurred.
Exploitation and mainstream cinema had merged as the convetions of b-movie monster mayhem met with massive box office success.
What I've found is whether it's Warner Brothers, Paramount,
Universal, Fox, Columbia, they're going to steal from you.
I mean they're all pretty much equally dishonest, just some are more upfront than others.
Jaws was a phenomenon partly because it was a terrific movie and also because it was based on a big best seller and it had a tremendous release, you know advertising and lots of play dates.
It is really just a big budget version of The Creature From The Black Lagoon which even Steven
Spielberg has admitted.
You make a studio picture and you have an oppurtunity with bigger budget and enough to you know hopefully make a better product.
But, it's the same business
Following the astounding success of
Jaws, low budget exploitation versions of
“man versus animal” horror movies quickly flooded the market.
It was now the exploitation filmmakers who were looking to knock off and capitalize on the big studio films.
Pirannha was, unfortunately came two years after Jaws and right around the time that
Jaws II was going to be released and it had ocurred to me that maybe it was a little late for a rip off of a picture that was two years old.
Roll 'em! I mean action, whatever I mean...
A Los Angeles distributor of exploitation films named Frank Woods who owned a small film company, decided that he wanted to start making films himself and a friend of his had written a script about a giant alligator which
I guess was to be a rip off of Jaws.
So I loved the idea, but the script was awful I agreed to do it if I could bring in John
Sayles to re-write the script.
With the global success of
Jaws, the major studios began to see b-movie concepts as a recipie for blockbusters
That seems to have baded now, ya know.
They do, do come back every so often.
I think that the giant rabbit movie kind of put the kibash on some of it.
Now that audiences can see it all, what is there left to see?
Have the traditional elements of exploitation gone away or have they simply evolved into acceptable mainstream entertainment?
That was the best lovin' I ever had.
You're gonna wake up the rest of the bitches.
Now with such recent homages as Black Dynamite and Hell Ride.
The truth is clear, the spirt of grindhouse lives on.
Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez made
Grindhouse and I love the trailers in it.
But the only real grindhouse movie in the last,
10 or 15 years is The
Passion of The Christ.
You know it was famously called Texas Chainsaw Jesus.
That movie was the rough house!
That was a grindhouse movie.
It's all showbusiness.
It's all showbusiness, they're all in enertainment.
American Gangster is a very big budget film out now.
He's presented as a totally, admirable and charismatic he's Super Fly! And that, that, that's Black Exploitation picture.
Better made. Bigger budget.
But the morality is the same.
Well I think there was something uniquely
American about exploitation cinema.
You know a lot of these little movies were made for pennies.
But they were really striving for something and if that's not part of what America was all about, they I don't know what is?
Movies, they're only a hundred years old little over a hundred years old but the movies have become our contemporary mythology.
And, the grindhouse is very much a part of that.
#AMERICAN GRINDHOUSE#
Germans.
Let's get them!
Where are the damn fighters going?
They've gone chasing scalps, leaving us unprotected again.
Damn those glory-grabbing bastards!
Bandits! Hundreds of them!
Six o'clock!
Is there anything left of our escort?
Negative, boss.
Damn it! Why don't they worry about us?
I can't believe this!
It never fails.
Oh, no.
Stay with me.
This is Bouncing Betty.
Engine three is out.
We're falling back. Two, you take lead position.
Need the extinguisher.
Hank!
Mayday! Mayday!
Prepare to bail out.
I repeat, prepare to bail...
Red One to Red Two, come in.
Are you awake over there, Lightning?
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
Boy, I need a nap!
Well, look alive. Wouldn't want you to miss this war.
War is hell. What we're doing is just boring as hell.
Whoever she was, I hope she was worth losing sleep over.
Oh, trust me, she was worth it!
Junior.
Junior, you okay?
Fine as wine, Red One. The sky is blue and my guns are hot.
Joker, you all right?
Nope. I feel like I'm flying my grandfather's Buick.
Coolant indicator's all over the map.
And to think I was as happy as a church lady when I got this plane.
All right, Red Four, you're done.
Take it on home.
Come on now, Captain, this gauge over here is a piece of crap.
Captain, let me give it a looky before you send him back.
He's not trailing any oil or water.
Seems to me like he's just got a bad indicator.
Come on, Easy. Let me fly, sir, please?
You know it ain't gonna be no fun without me.
All right. Okay.
You stay on, Red Four.
You stay on, but you keep an eye on it, all right?
Thank you, sweetheart.
Just my luck I get stuck with the flying wreck.
Another P-40 from
Uncle Sam's junkyard.
It looks like we got a truck up there.
It's got German markings.
Junior, it's your turn.
Yes, sir!
Prepare to feel the wrath of the Ray Gun.
I'm on your wing, Junior!
Come on.
You see that?
Congratulations, kid.
You killed yourself a truck.
Whoo-hoo!
We can go back victorious.
Everybody, form up.
We're going home.
Uh...
Easy, I see something. It's a train!
Eleven o'clock.
I don't think it's German.
I don't see any guns.
Looks like they're moving livestock to me.
No. It's military.
It's camouflaged.
It could just be cows.
You don't want to shoot up no cows if you don't have to.
Unless y'all planning on a barbecue.
Nobody sees any guns?
I'm telling you, Easy, that's a munitions train.
And I bet it's armed to the teeth.
You grown-ups better think fast.
It's headed for that tunnel.
All right. Only one way to find out.
Let's go get it.
Wait. Easy, we got to take it head-on, low, so their guns can't hit us.
It's my decision, Lightning.
Stay in formation.
Looks like these cows are armed.
Come on.
Stay in front of it!
Die, you Nazi dogs!
Dang! Those cows just shot up my wing!
No sweat. No sweat.
If that train makes it into the tunnel, they'll stop in there.
Where's Lightning?
Where the hell are you, Lightning?
Taking the train from the front, like you should have done.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Gotcha!
Whoa! Shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Nothing like a good old
Georgia ass-whupping.
Just trying to keep you boys inspired.
How's this headline for inspiration?
"Negro Pilot Dies Because He's
Too Stupid To Follow Orders."
Your plane looks like it's been through a shredder.
How are you going to explain that to Coffee?
By explaining to him that I'm the one who blew up the train.
You boys go on ahead.
I've spotted something.
Lightning destroyed another one.
Look at that mess.
Look at that mess.
I guess we'll be working all night again.
It's been a long time since you've seen your sweetheart.
Too bad she's dancing with someone new.
This is Axis Mary coming to you
from Berlin with your favorite music.
Never thought that you would be
Standing here so close to me
There's so much I feel that I should say
But words can wait
Until some other day
How about one time you bring my plane home without wrecking it?
Good morning, Mr. Coffee.
You keep tearing up my planes like this, you're gonna be wearing your balls for a necktie.
See, I can't let you do that,
'cause I just saw a goddess who's gonna bear my beautiful children.
You're a clown, Lightning.
You need to grow up.
We can't afford to have any more planes taken off the line with your stupid...
What is this?
What did you do?
Oh, man! Where did that come from?
What happened was...
Sticks!
Come see what this clown did to the plane.
I can see what you're thinking.
What the hell is this? Did somebody throw a train at you?
Coffee, I can see you're upset.
Maybe we should talk about this another time.
Oh, we got a new recruit here!
Hey there.
You lost, son?
I was looking for Jimmy Wayans.
Uh, Jimmy got shot down must've been, what, two weeks ago?
I believe so.
Well, is Uly Douglas here?
Uh-uh.
Furball's dead, son.
Crashed on takeoff.
You're just a bad-luck
Chuck, aren't you?
Everybody you know ends up on the wrong side of the dirt.
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
My name's Smokey.
This here's Neon, this is Joker.
Flight Officer
Maurice Wilson, sir!
You can leave all that saluting, son.
You're home now.
Seeing as how everybody you know dead, you might as well bunk with us.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Just don't bad luck us before you get up in this Jeep now.
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to live.
Come on, Maurice.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy, get in there!
Hold on.
Come on, Maurice.
Wait, you've got to back up.
How'd it go up there, Ray?
I'm telling you, Deacon.
Lightning almost got himself killed again today.
He's one crazy pilot.
I'm going to pray for him if we ever get to see any real combat.
Well, hey, I see you here after every mission.
I'm sure your prayers are helping.
Thanks, Deke.
Black Jesus, we thank you for bringing
Red Squadron back home to us.
Lightning's usual elegant work.
Although I understand your plane didn't fare any better than the train.
Sir.
That old Lightning don't never have his brakes on.
Questions, gentlemen.
Does it really matter, sir?
- Lights up.
- Here we go.
What was your question?
What we do, how well we do it, does it matter?
Strafing runs and coastal patrols.
They got us out here using planes to mop floors, fellas.
I don't normally go in for loose talk, but we won't even be doing that for long.
Ain't that why Colonel
Bullard went stateside?
The Colonel's business stateside is above your grade.
All due respect, sir, but are they back there deciding if they should shut us down?
Just a rumor, Winky.
You know this how?
Pass it up.
Read it, Easy.
Out loud.
Go ahead, son.
"The use of Negroes in the Army
Air Corps may yet be halted."
"A report has been forwarded calling the performance by Negro pilots"
"unsatisfactory."
"A plan to assign the Negroes to routine convoy cover may be"
"all that remains for those who seem"
"to have neither the intelligence"
"nor the proper reflexes for such a complicated task"
"as fighter pursuit.
The great Tuskegee..."
"The great Tuskegee experiment"
"to allow the Negro type to fly airplanes has failed."
And you all thought what?
You'd sign up.
You get shiny boots, a uniform, and that'd be the end of 100 years of bigotry?
You're colored men in a white man's army.
It's a miracle you're flying fighters in Italy, and not mopping latrines in Milwaukee!
You want it straight?
Yes, the old man's stateside, fighting the good fight.
And when he comes through for us, we better be damn sure we're ready to do the same for him.
Any of you feel otherwise, any of you want to wash yourselves out, well, Negro, please do so, and I'll have you on the next thing smoking back home to make room for the men who want to stand and fight.
Get your head up, son.
You're fighter pilots.
Watch the rest of the film.
Learn something.
When we came under your command, Colonel, you stated very clearly that we would never find Negroes who could pass a pilot's exam, make it through flight school, survive basic combat.
A combat record which, to this point...
We've done all of that.
To this point,
I don't believe your boys have scored a single aerial kill.
Because you have not assigned us a single forward mission.
It's damn hard to shoot down the enemy
100 miles behind the front lines.
As a matter of fact, when will we be assigned to bomber escorts, Colonel?
There have been any number of reports of poor discipline.
Which is in every newspaper and magazine in the country.
We have enough race troubles as it is without these sons of bitches in the press throwing fuel on the fire.
How an unofficial assessment of the Tuskegee program made its way to newspapers and magazines may be worthy of its own hearing, sir.
Colonel Tomlinson, you've been supporting this experiment from the beginning, but I'm afraid you're just gonna have to suffer its failure.
We're given hand-me-down planes.
Ordered to attack targets that have already been bypassed.
Fly patrols where the enemy hasn't been seen for months.
Now we've clone every lowdown, dirty job you've handed us, hoping that we would just limp along and go away.
We will not go away.
We have a right to fight for our country, the same as every other American.
So you shut us down, or you let us fly.
Soldier boy
Oh, do you think about me, soldier boy?
How could you ever...
What?
Don't give me that look.
What the hell were you doing up there today?
Beating up on Hitler. Winning the war.
I got the train, didn't I?
I love you like a brother, Joe.
But you disobey my orders again,
I'm gonna have to write you up.
For what?
For being right?
I told you those guns were there.
You almost got yourself killed.
No, I followed protocol.
You went for the glory.
There's a difference.
Now you may not need me to get you through this thing alive, but Joker, Junior, the rest of the squad just might.
Okay. You're right,
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.
What you in such a hurry for anyway?
I saw a girl.
The most beautiful
I have ever seen.
Just can't let them alone, can you?
No more than you can let that bottle alone.
You got your way of getting through the war, and I got mine.
I wonder what your pops'd say to that.
We can just leave him out of this.
He's got you in a pressure cooker, man.
Graduating college at 20,
4.0, and now a captain?
Pushing yourself mighty hard to please him.
Didn't I just say we can leave him out of this?
All right.
Besides, I drink 'cause I got to bunk with your crazy self.
You bunk with me 'cause I'm the best pilot in the whole damn Army, and you're just hoping you're gonna learn something.
If I'm not mistaken,
I'm the flight leader, which would make you my wingman.
Smarter doesn't make you better.
Better at what? Busting up Coffee's planes?
Romancing the ladies, for one.
Now if you're done whining,
I have got a pass to do that very thing right now.
Lightning.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What's going to happen when you go home and the women speak English, and they understand just how full of bullshit you are?
What's this?
Something to celebrate you being old enough to know better.
Ha!
"Italian for Beginners"?
How many cartons of smokes this set you back?
A simple "thank you" wouldn't hurt.
And a "happy birthday" would have been fine.
Knowing you, you're just tired of me embarrassing myself in front of the signorinas.
Yeah, that might be it.
How you feel?
A whole lot more than one year older.
Thank you.
Happy birthday.
It's tight.
Pilots got you all hot and bothered.
Come on.
Coffee!
We got three planes, the hydraulic pumps are shot.
Two more got bad governors.
Grab a piece of that tape and put it over that hose.
What are you doing, Lightning?
What?
What did you say?
Come on, Lightning.
I need it back by nightfall!
And ask if she's got a sister!
Yeah, a blind one!
I'm sorry to bother you.
I flew around your house this morning.
Okay. Uh...
Right, you...
Si.
That was me.
I'm Joe.
Joe.
Yeah.
D'accordo. Sofia.
Sofia, right.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Mama.
Little.
Joe Little.
I hope I'm not intruding, ma'am.
Thank you.
Ah!
Ah!
Hold on. I want to ask you something.
How?
Oh, how? I got a Jeep. You want to come for a drive?
Dove?
What's dove?
Dove.
Is that a yes?
You want to bring your mother?
It's going to be tougher than I thought.
What you going with?
I got two pair.
And three of clubs.
I don't care what you have, you'll never be able to beat me, son.
You ain't got enough in the head.
I can't lose. I don't even know why y'all try.
You just got here, Maurice. I hope you're learning something.
Hope at least you're learning by now not to play poker with people that cheat.
I ain't cheating.
You cheat.
I don't want to learn how to play cards,
I want to learn about combat flying.
Dogfights and tricks for switching it up on them Jerries.
What the hell you think it is we know about dogfighting?
The white boys are the only ones get to tangle it up with the Jerries around here.
But they don't talk to us much, so...
Experience is a cruel teacher. She gives the exam first, then the lesson.
You know what?
I decided when I get home...
Yeah.
...people ask me about the war,
I'm going to just make stuff up.
Hell, I already do! Ask me what I killed, seven trucks, five Jeeps, and one of those motorcycles with the sidecar on them.
My record look like the inventory down at the motor pool.
How the hell am I gonna go back home and tell my dad all I killed were traffic?
He'll whup my ass!
What's that?
It's my Buck Rogers
X-38 disintegrator pistol.
Makes me feel like...
You know, like I can't lose.
Here, try it.
No. No, thanks, Junior.
I don't really like to fool with other people's good luck charms.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Um...
Look, I don't like being called Junior.
I want the tag Ray Gun.
I'm not a kid.
I did two years at Howard before I even enrolled in the Tuskegee program.
I'm going to be an engineer.
What about you?
My dad's a judge.
He wants me to go to law school, so I guess I'm gonna do that.
You ought to just give it up!
Go back to where you came from.
I'd rather be up there killing Jerries than down here playing games with you, Joker.
Look, don't be in a hurry to get to the killing part, Maurice.
Tell me something.
You scared of dying?
I don't know.
I am.
Every time I close the lid on that canopy,
I feel like I'm shutting the lid on my own coffin.
I tell you something else, the pilot that tells you otherwise is either a liar or too foolish to know any better.
Amen.
It's useless.
All this talk for another study, another inquiry.
"Politics is the art of..."
Major Kessel's political science class, the quote that he used...
He said, "Politics is the art of postponing a decision until it is..."
"No longer relevant."
Colonel
Mortamus stumbled badly.
If he hadn't embarrassed the brass by leaking that report to the press, they probably would have let you wither and die.
His politicking bought you time.
For what?
Operation Shingle.
Air cover for a beach landing.
It's your chance to go up against German fighters.
I'll say this, Jack.
Even when your hope is false, it sure is grand.
I'm serious, A.J.
I can get that for you.
If you stick your neck out how far?
I don't want you to put your career on the line for me, Jack.
A little less tin on my uniform is the least of it.
If I get you the mission, your men have got to put something on the board.
They come through, or Mortamus and the brass will have all they need to shut the whole thing down.
You get us that mission, we will light up the board.
Has this flight order been verified?
Yes, sir. It came directly from Colonel Bullard in Washington.
Check it again. Get the flight leaders together.
Sir.
The Colonel got us an opportunity.
Gather around, gentlemen.
Attacking another train, sir?
Or did we graduate to minding a truck convoy this time?
Operation Shingle.
It's an ambitious landing off the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea at Nettuno.
We've been given the frag order to provide air cover for the landing.
Yeah!
Whoo!
I'm gonna have so many of those little swastikas on my plane, they're gonna think it's camouflage.
We will repay the old man with victory, hear me?
Yes, sir!
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Junior, where you at, boy?
You're gonna miss the flight.
I know I'm late.
I'm coming.
We're a long way from Memphis, but Black Jesus is here with me, and he says it's gonna be a successful mission.
Now does that mean we're gonna shoot down a bunch of Jerries, or we gonna come back in one piece, or Lightning gonna pick up some girls along the way?
No more pickups for me, boys.
I swear to you, lam in love.
Love? Swearing? Both bad luck in my book.
I can't believe I made it.
Don't tell Easy I was late.
They all set?
All ready, sir!
Send them off.
Hallelujah. The saints are marching in!
Watch me become an ace today, boys.
Lightning, did you just say you're gonna become an ass today, or an ace?
I couldn't quite hear what you...
Was it ass or ace?
I couldn't hear.
I think you heard him right, Smokey.
All right, men, cut the chatter.
Jesus.
Would you look at that!
Oh, my goodness.
Just like in the newsreels.
Keep your eyes peeled for the Jerries.
Bogies inbound, twelve o'clock.
And they're closing in mighty fast!
These pilots are rookies!
Make quick work of them.
All planes, hold formation.
Hold on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Anytime, Red One.
Drop tanks!
Oh, shit!
I'm shaking them!
There's two more!
Yes. They're cutting left!
Put a little hitch in his giddyup!
I'm feeling good now!
Remember, keep the beachhead clear.
It's clear.
Straighten up over there, Junior.
Let's go, Lightning.
I'm on one.
I'm behind you. Break right!
I got him.
Get on the inside, Easy!
Get on the inside.
Come on, slip just a little.
Come on, tighter, tighter.
Congratulations, Captain.
You are the first Negro to shoot down a Jerry! Whoo!
Ha-ha!
Junior!
Straight ahead now.
There's my swastika.
I'm on your wing.
Come on, baby, just move a little bit closer.
All I want is a little bitty kiss.
Just give me a little peck on the cheek. Yeah!
Good shot.
Oh, hell.
Joker, there's one on my tail!
Okay, listen, Junior. Buttonhook right, and I'm gonna go left.
Come on.
No touchdown for you today, Fritz.
Junior, you're all clear, buddy.
Deke, on your right!
I see him.
Let's give those newspapers something to write about.
Tennessee says hello!
There's the squad leader.
I'm gonna take him out.
Careful. He's good.
You're letting him get away, Lightning!
I'm just toying with him.
This is for you, Pretty Boy, with your bright yellow nose!
Come on, boy. Line it up.
One shot.
Holy crap!
How'd he do that?
Get him off me!
I'm on him.
Get him off me!
Get out of the way, Lightning!
Open your throttle.
Come on, man!
Take him out!
I can't get a clear shot.
Hold on.
Drop to your right.
All right! I got him.
Oh! Thank you, Lord.
And there I was thinking you didn't love me any more.
He's headed home to mama.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
If you're thinking
I should finish him off
so we can get back to the beachhead, then, yes.
Or we could follow him.
We could go after their airdrome.
I don't know, Lightning. We got orders.
You know that.
Come on, Easy. I'm talking about a Jerry airbase.
Dozens of planes!
You're saying no?
All right. I'll trust your instincts this time.
But we're running low on fuel. We're gonna follow for five minutes.
You got that?
Five minutes.
Joker, you back there?
We're still back here.
Junior?
I'm ready for a turkey shoot.
Mayday! Mayday!
There it is, boys.
Get your scorecards ready.
Gotta knock out those fighters before they take off.
Got to take those guns out first.
Everybody, form up.
Here we go!
Brand-new 109s.
Not so brand-new 109s.
Like ducks in a row.
All right.
Two at once!
That's nothing. Watch me get four this time.
Touchdown!
We're running low on fuel.
No time for celebration.
Whoo!
The Ray Gun strikes again.
Junior, watch out for that flak!
Good job, Lightning.
Washington brass won't be able to ignore this.
My God!
Those pilots are African!
Hey! What happened to Junior?
There he is.
Three o'clock high.
He's trailing oil.
Red One to Red Three.
Junior, come in.
I took something in the leg.
Something in my head.
Level off, Junior, or you're gonna stall out.
All right.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Whoa!
They done shot down the whole
Luftwaffe, didn't they?
Yes, they did, huh?
Those hotshots sure did.
Never doubted it.
Did I make it?
Yeah, you made it, damn Knucklehead.
Should have let you crash.
You'll be okay.
No surprises, Ray Gun.
You get healthy, all right?
Luck is with you, Ray!
I think we can cautiously declare the landing a victory.
It's a slog, but the ground troops are holding.
Colonel Bullard.
Sir.
Your boys chalked eight kills in the air,
63 aircraft destroyed on the ground.
No losses in their first wave.
Outstanding. Pass along my congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Action reports and assessments by 1500.
Colonel.
Eight German fighters or 80 German fighters, it still doesn't change what I think of you and your boys.
We don't care.
Respect the uniform.
Believe me, sir, that is all I have respect for.
It's not as bad as all this.
Leg's good, eye's fine.
In a week's time,
I'll be able to see fine out of one eye and mostly out of the other.
"Mostly."
Is that what you want me to tell Stance?
"Sir, Ray Gun has one-and-a-half eyes' worth of ability."
Look, come on.
I landed a plane blind.
Lightning...
Hey, don't get me in this.
If the Flight Surgeon won't clean bill you, what do you expect me to do?
Just talk to him.
He listens to you.
I mean, you got the same respect on this base as the old man, so...
I'd rather be dead than on the ground.
Easy, you're the best friend I got.
Please don't do this to me.
General Luntz, Colonel Bullard.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Colonel, please.
Thank you.
No, thank you, sir.
Colonel, I'm in a hell of a fix with our target in Europe.
Our boys are getting cut to shreds.
I read the action report from Operation Shingle.
Eight kills in your first wave.
Thirteen in ail.
That's a right trick.
Colonel, I'll give it to you straight.
I can't afford the kind of losses my bombers have been suffering.
Do you have film of the air cover your bombers are getting now, sir?
We need to change the way we fight.
I need pilots who will fly close and tight to the heavies all the way.
Not put my men in harm's way by chasing rabbits.
So you're asking me to tell my men not to shoot down
Jerry fighters?
I'm asking them to put the bombers ahead of themselves.
I don't care if they never splash another Jerry fighter.
I need to get my heavies to the target and back.
The losses from enemy air, I believe my men can get that down, sir.
If you can bring back one or two more of my planes every mission...
Sir, I believe we can cut your losses by 70% or 80%.
Colonel, the word is you're arrogant.
If "arrogant" is the only word people use to describe me now,
I would say I think
I'm making progress.
Can you help us?
I'm asking you man to man.
Can you help save lives?
We need new planes.
No more hand-me-downs.
If you get us new planes, we can help your boys.
I got a bullet right through my canopy.
I ought to be dead, y'all.
But nothing happened to me though.
It's Black Jesus,
I'm telling you.
Oh, go on with that.
Let's play.
Don't sass Black Jesus, now you might need him one day.
What happened to you is luck.
Just luck.
Lords of Poker,
Black Jesus, White Jesus,
Tooth Fairy, Easter
Bunny, all of them!
I done lost all my damn money.
Something is wrong.
Ain't that right.
How about you just get wise?
There is no special mojo running the world.
Things just are how they are.
Us getting shot up and the people we're protecting not caring a thing for it.
I hear that.
You talk real tough, Joe Little.
Real cold.
Well, reality's a little chilly.
Is that right?
Let's play!
Let me tell you about this cold, hard brother.
While y'all trying to get by with your whiskey and cigarettes, guess what he's doing with his rations?
- What's that?
- What he doing?
Trading them all for lingerie to spoil his old lady.
Oh, really?
Perfume, silks.
Aw!
That tease!
Yeah, well, lucky at love and lucky at cards.
Right like that. Boom!
Man, you are so beautiful.
Of course, you have no idea what I'm saying.
I love you.
Oh, uh...
Wow, that's...
Uh...
Uh...
Shh!
What are you doing here?
This is an officers' club.
I am an officer.
This is a whites-only officers' club.
You're off the reservation, pal.
Try the Italian dance hall near the main plaza.
Hey. Go home, nigger.
I got what I came for.
Good night.
Am I going to be court-martialed?
I don't know.
I'm sure you trying to start a race riot won't help you...
I was finishing what they started!
Wrong or right, we got regs to live by.
And you throwing punches, busting them up, gets you what?
A good feeling, Easy.
Right here.
A throb that says I didn't choke on what they were feeding me.
How do your heart feel? You say
"they" like it's all of them.
Same as always. "Shuffle along, cause no strife.
"Don't scare the ofays by speaking out."
Some other time I'd have stood with you, side by side.
"Some other time"!
But you put a minute's worth of righteousness ahead of a whole war!
Ugh!
Same old Joe Little.
Still getting into the wrong fights for the wrong reasons.
Your reasons any better?
You spent your whole life being one big, lousy Atlanta Compromise.
Well, go sell that somewhere else.
I'm not buying it.
I've come bearing gifts.
I'm all ears, sir.
Bomber escort
New P-51 s.
You did it.
You really did it, sir.
Come on. Let's get some food.
I'm hungry.
Welcome home, Colonel.
Lieutenant Little
. What am I going to do with you?
Everything's a fight, isn't it?
It must be so goddamn exhausting being you.
You know something, Joe Little?
You're a punk.
You remind me of one of those kids from a comic strip, walking around, pushing his sleeve up one arm, hand balled in a tight fist, walking and looking at the world through a squint.
Always looking to knock something down just because it's standing.
It's right there.
It's right there.
You really want to knock something down?
Try using that.
Because I will tell you straight,
I don't have anything against you.
I have the highest expectations for you.
Lieutenant Little,
I need everyone on this next mission.
And you're lucky you're the best damn pilot we've got.
Report to your unit.
Bless you
For being an angel
Just when it seemed
That heaven was not for me
Bless you, for building...
They let you out, huh?
Or did you bust out?
Very funny.
Look, uh.
I said some things.
Yeah, you did.
I didn't mean them.
Yeah, you did.
You know me. Act first, think later.
Well, nobody's perfect.
We good?
Yeah, we're good.
I figured it out.
What? That throwing punches doesn't solve your problems?
No.
That maneuver Pretty Boy pulled on me, got on my tail,
I figured out how to do it.
Fancy trick flying will only get you killed.
Or make me an ace.
The American pilots flying escort now go for every kill they can score.
That's how they were trained.
That's how they fight.
Here's how we change up the strategy.
Lights up.
At all costs, under every circumstance, you protect the heavies.
Colonel.
We signed up to shoot
Germans, not babysit planes.
You signed up to follow orders.
One bomber, that's 10 men.
You getting one Jerry so you can put a cross on your plane, that doesn't balance that.
We count our victories by the bombers we get to their targets.
By the husbands we return to their wives.
By the fathers we get back to their children.
What has not changed, what will never change, from the last plane, to the last bullet, to the last minute, to the last man, we fight.
We fight!
Yes, sir!
We've secured new aircrafts.
P-51s.
The best the AAF's got.
As soon as we get the A-okay, we'll begin ferrying them in from Bari.
Dismissed.
Say cheese, say cheese.
Whoo-hoo!
My, my, my!
Hey, Maurice!
How are they flying?
Like angels.
I don't know any angels with six .50-caliber machine guns.
All right, men, get your manuals.
Get familiar.
Coffee!
Yes, sir.
We'll need them all marked up and ready to fly.
It's taken care of.
The Major says paint their tails bright red, so they stand out.
Like the Red Baron.
Loud and proud.
Appreciate it.
Beautiful.
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
This will definitely make the group distinctive.
Bright red tails and black pilots?
You can't call us nothing else but distinctive.
From now on.
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
What do you think?
It's like it's speeding even when it's sitting.
I never even met a girl as beautiful as this plane.
Well, take good care of her.
What do you mean?
I twisted the Flight Surgeon's arm.
Got you back on the roster.
You going up with us next mission.
Uh...
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to tell the guys.
Heavenly Father, we thank you for this glorious day.
We ask that you send your angels down to surround us as we fly through the sky.
We know that it's part of your master plan that we've made it all the way from Tuskegee here to Ramitelli.
We are very confident in our abilities, but we ask that you give us the vision, the sight, and the speed and power to make it through this mission.
All the airmen say, "In
Jesus' name we pray." Amen.
Amen.
- Nothing's difficult.
- Everything's a challenge.
- Through adversity...
- ...to the stars!
From the last plane, to the last bullet, to the last minute, to the last man, we fight!
We fight!
We fight!
Anybody got eyes on the bombers?
Uh...
We are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.
Right on target, and according to my reckoning, 32 seconds early.
We're here.
They're not.
Maybe the bombers turned back.
Damn! Maybe they went on without us.
Red One, there they are.
Nine o'clock low.
Junior, head on over to the bomber leader.
Let him know we're friendlies.
Roger that.
Bogies! Three high.
Everybody, on your guns.
Counting close to 70 chicks.
We got one coming down.
Hold your fire.
They're ours.
Red tails? I don't recognize the markings.
He's colored.
Yeah, right.
Hell if I'm joking!
Look.
Jesus Christ. They can't all be colored.
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!
What the hell do we do?
Tacoma One to all planes.
Everybody's eyes open.
I don't think our fighter escort
is gonna be much help this trip.
Flying Fortresses!
At least a hundred!
Decoy Squadron, move in and draw off those fighters.
Fighters, four o'clock.
They're not attacking.
Let them go.
Let them go?
Our orders are to stay with the bombers.
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.
You heard Colonel Bullard. Forget the prize, save the lives.
God, I hate this war.
Look at that. Those Red
Tails are staying put.
They're giving up glory to save our asses.
We'll have to do this the hard way...
...Break!
Here we go, Lightning.
Right behind you.
Where'd this jackass come from?
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.
Stop fooling around!
Damn it, I'm coming.
No, you're not.
Stay put.
I'm gonna show him a little trick I learned.
Whoo! Ha-ha!
Lightning, when are you gonna learn this is not a game?
Coming up on anti-aircraft guns.
Back off! We'll get
'em on the way back...
Break! Break!
Those Jerries are hightailing it out of here.
Flak's getting thick.
Break off. Circle clear of the flak until the bombers return.
Good luck, bombardiers!
All bombs away! Let's get the hell out of here.
Here they come.
Form up.
Move in...
...Concentrate on the stragglers!
Hey, Junior! You got a bandit on your left!
Get out of there.
I'll take him.
Junior, get out of there!
Where is he?
I can't see him!
Ah!
Junior, where are you?
Are you all right?
I'm all right!
Junior, you're on fire!
Junior, get out of the plane!
Junior!
Come on, Junior, bail!
Geronimo!
We didn't lose a single plane.
Well, that's a first.
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!
Don't look good.
Deke, talk to me.
What's your status?
I'm all right.
I got gas spraying everywhere, but I think I'm gonna be okay.
I'm a little dizzy, but other than that, I'm fine.
All right, listen up.
I'll give escort to Deke
. Everybody else head back to base.
No, I'll stay. I'm his wingman.
I'll stay.
Let me take him, Easy.
God, I hate this mask!
It's my call, Lightning.
Your calls have been a little off lately.
What? What are you talking about?
Junior shouldn't have been up here.
You got a problem with the way I'm running this squad, you talk to Bullard about it, all right?
Until then, I'm in control.
And my order for you right now is to head back to base.
Damn!
All right, Deke, you'll be all right.
I'll see you back at the ranch.
You got Black Jesus with you, boy!
Thanks, Smokey.
Well, get me home, Easy.
No, sir. You're going to get yourself home.
What the hell put the Captain in such a bad mood?
He gets like that sometimes.
He knows good and well he shouldn't have let Junior fly.
That boy was half blind.
We're almost home.
I hope we meet up with those Red Tails next time.
Listen, boys, the bombers have passed their safe point.
Our mission is over.
Let's head back to base.
You guys are taking the long way.
I'm going to take a shortcut down the coast.
Come on now, Lightning. Ain't no need to get all crazy.
You know you got to stay with your squadron.
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.
And what if you turn up missing?
Then I'll have to break it to Major Stance.
Well, break it to him gently.
Great, great, great!
One's a drunk, and the other one does whatever the hell he wants to do.
Smokey, stay with him.
And keep him out of trouble.
Don't worry.
I'll stick with him.
My head, it hurts.
We're almost there, Deke.
Stay with me.
Easy, I got blood all over me, but I'm not bleeding.
You're gonna be okay.
I'm right above you.
Captain,
I'm getting real dizzy.
I need to rest a minute.
No, no. Stay alert, Deke.
I'm here with you.
I can't really see anything!
Everything's all blurred!
I got double vision.
You're slipping, Deke! Deke, you're slipping! Steady up!
All right.
All right.
You're diving, Deke. You need to pull back on your stick.
Pull up, Deke, pull up!
Deke, listen to me! Pull back on your stick now!
Pull up, Deke, pull up!
Pull up?
Oh, I'm pulling up!
I'm pulling up!
Come on!
I must have passed out!
I need you to stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.
Just keep talking.
All right.
Lightning, look! German destroyer, moving to the north!
I still got ammo.
How about you?
Nah. You need about a 500-pound bomb to put a dent in that thing.
Plus, that baby got very, very big guns.
Just watch me.
Lightning, no, all right?
Don't be crazy.
If the big guns don't kill you, your plane will get messed up,
and Coffee is gonna kill you.
Relax, Smokey. Worrying too much will kill you.
All right! That was fun! Okay, come on now, time to go home.
Just one more pass.
How do you like that, Mr. Hitler?
Lightning, you a damn fool!
But I love you! Come on.
Ramitelli to Subsoil Red One.
Do you read?
I got Red Four with me, he's busted up pretty bad.
Stay alert, Deke.
Stay alert.
Ramitelli, have a fire truck standing by.
He's leaking fuel. I repeat, he's leaking fuel.
This is Major Stance.
Circle a half-mile out and have Red Four bail.
Flight surgeons will be there waiting.
Copy that.
You're gonna put it into a left bank, and you're up and out.
All right?
I can't get the canopy open!
Easy!
Listen, Deke, the only thing between you living and dying is that canopy.
Now, get it open!
I can't open it!
I can't open it!
Red Four cannot open his canopy.
I repeat, he cannot open his canopy.
I'm gonna have to bring him in.
Roger that.
Sweet Jesus, don't let this happen to me.
Okay. Okay.
All right, Deke.
Flaps down.
Flaps down.
There you go.
Level off, level off!
I'm leveling.
Help me, sir.
I'm covered in fuel!
I'm coming around behind you, Deke.
All right, now get your gear down.
Easy! I think I'm coming in too hot!
I don't want to die!
I'm not ready!
Just relax.
Level off, Deke.
Too fast.
I'm going too fast!
Nose up! Nose up!
Come on!
Drop your throttle!
Nose down!
Nose down!
No! No!
Shit!
Deke!
Smoke cloud on the left.
You don't think that's Deke, do you?
Who was it?
Deke.
It was Deke.
Oh, shit.
An engine fire.
Gas leak must have caught on the landing.
But I talked to the medics, they said he's gonna be all right.
Must have been a spark.
What?
You've been drinking.
You're going to blame this on me?
Tell me you haven't been drinking.
I got him down!
Say it!
I got him down alive! You don't blame this on me!
I did everything I could do!
Joe! Joe!
All back, Colonel.
The good news is Lieutenant Watkins survived the fireball landing.
He's in critical.
Do they think he's gonna make it?
Yes, sir.
With 60% third-degree burns.
We're sending him back home.
I brought the background on the captured flyer, Lieutenant Ray Gannon.
His mother's name is Dorothy.
Father is Thomas.
His wife's name is Thelma. They have a little girl, Adele.
In particular,
Ray loved to fly.
More than any pilot we have, he loved to be in the air.
You must be Lt. Gannon.
Welcome to Stalag 18.
You're the first of your kind we've had here.
I hope your stay will not be cut short.
Here is the new prisoner your captain requested,
Lieutenant Ray Gannon.
A pilot with the 332nd.
Where the hell did you come from?
Lieutenant!
Sit down.
So, I bet you're wondering why
I picked you to bunk with us.
It's not something
I care to think about.
Don't worry.
It's not so we can hang you or anything.
I chose you because I know you can't be a German spy, being colored and all.
We're in the middle of a rather delicate operation, and we don't need any new white faces.
You'll be treated no differently than any other man here.
Any problems, you tell me.
Come on! Let's go!
Move, move, move!
Line it up! Let's go!
I welcome you to the 332nd Fighter Group.
You're a long way from home.
Jerry's going down!
I'm telling you,
Lightning sunk it.
That is a destroyer.
Shit, Lightning's crazy!
Here it comes!
Whoo!
I came around for a second pass.
Watch this.
We fight! We fight!
We fight! We fight! We fight!
Mmm.
My best friend.
He...
He almost caused the death of one of our pilots.
I don't know what to do.
I am so glad I found you.
I want you to stop, Easy.
Stop what?
You can't drink on duty.
I told you, what happened to
Deke wasn't my fault, all right?
No one cares what you do when you're in town.
How you relax is your business.
This coming from a guy who flies like he has got some kind of death wish.
You're a piece of work, Joe.
You ignore me up there, then all of a sudden, you expect me to listen to you down here.
All right, all right, all right.
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
You promise to ditch the bottle,
I'll promise to fly right.
And follow my orders.
And follow your orders.
Happy?
Very happy.
I can't wait to hear her sweet singing!
You guys can go chase skirt.
I'm going to Sofia's.
What did you say, about three miles?
Odds of us getting pinched?
I won't even take that action.
Hey, flyboys!
That trouble. Keep walking.
Come on.
Don't just walk away from me.
He picked the wrong day.
Let's go.
Hey, come over here!
What?
You guys.
You're the Red Tails, right?
You know, Red Tails?
Colored boy flyers?
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say it like that, but who's asking?
Chester Barnes,
98th Bomb Group.
You guys flew a little top cover for us about a month ago.
A little run over Ploiesti?
It was the best goddamn flying
I've ever seen, gentlemen.
And we guys, well, we feel that we owe all you boys a drink.
Why don't you come and join us?
Come on.
Come and join them?
What's he saying?
Come on.
Drinks are on us.
Well, I'll be damned.
I guess the dance hall will have to wait.
How you doing?
Much obliged.
He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way.
He had a boogie style that no one else could play.
He was the top man at his craft.
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.
He's in the army now a-blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam.
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam.
The captain seemed to understand.
All right, boys, listen up!
These fellas are the Red Tails.
They're the guys who have been giving us an escort.
First drink is on me, fellas.
Whatever you'd like.
Hanson, Travis J.
Samuel George.
Me and the boys over here are with the 463rd Bomb Group.
Glad to meet you, man.
You flew with us over Brux
. Appreciate you getting us home.
Hey, have you guys run into any of those new jet pursuit fighters?
We haven't been that lucky.
Well, we've been that unlucky.
Those babies go so fast you can't even see them.
You know, we say "colored."
But that's not what you prefer?
No, no.
The word is...
"Negro."
When you get upset, when you get mad, you turn red, right?
When you get envious or sick, you turn green.
When you become cowardly, you turn yellow.
And y'all got the nerve to call us colored.
I want to ask you an important question.
Um...
Will you marry me?
Uh...
Time to think.
Oh.
Okay.
When you get to the other side, don't wait.
Just run for the woods, okay?
Go!
Remember, run for the woods!
It's Ray Gun, he's back with the batteries.
Any problems?
They won't even know they're missing.
Divide the batteries among those who have flashlights.
You've been a great help, Ray Gun.
I guess there's a lot more to you coloreds than I thought.
We want you to travel with us.
Oh, I can't. I'll stick out like a pig in a poultry shop.
I'll draw attention to you guys.
Thank you.
I'll go alone.
But...
Here, take my dog tags.
Get them back to my unit.
You're a wily sucker, Ray. At least they won't see you in the dark.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Safe journey, Captain.
Good luck, Ray.
Good luck.
Remember, run for the woods.
Okay, let's go.
- Run, Miller, run!
- Halt!
Halt!
Halt, halt!
Hot tamales, and they're red hot Yes, she got them for sale.
I got a girl, she's long and tall.
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feets in the hall.
Sticks on metal ain't music.
It ain't.
I like music.
Aww! Coffee, were you always mean as hell, or you just get like that with old age?
I once was a happy man. Never did not have a smile on my face.
That was before you guys started tearing up my beautiful planes.
I could tolerate the P-40s.
But these new babies getting beat up?
It breaks my heart.
Come on, Coffee. I only came back with two holes this time.
Uh. Six.
Six holes.
Well, that ain't nothing compared to what's gonna happen to you when you run into those jets those bomber jockeys was talking about.
I ain't afraid of no jets.
Don't go trying your old tricks, Lightning.
If you end up too close behind one of those jets, the turbulence alone will blow your black ass right out of the sky.
Trust me, I'm gonna be the first one to shoot one of those things down.
And I'll be the second.
My advice is, you see one, run like hell.
The only thing in life that makes me want to run like hell is you, Coffee.
That's gonna get you killed out there.
I'm not dancing with you.
The target is a tank factory on the outskirts of Berlin.
Shut that down, you shut down Jerry's ability to shore up a Berlin defense.
General Campbell's wing will be leading the bombardment.
You have recon on the area?
In the air, we're expecting everything the Luftwaffe's got,
100s, 109s, 190s.
A possibility of 262s,
German jet fighters.
Jet fighters?
The boys are gonna love this one!
The target area isn't your concern.
The 52nd will escort the
General's planes into Berlin.
Is there a reason, sir?
Sixteen hundred miles to Berlin and back.
The fighters need to take it in stages.
With external fuel tanks, the 51s can make it.
I guarantee our pilots can.
I'd prefer the Red Tails take the leg where we need protecting.
Our first major air offensive over Berlin.
From a propaganda point of view, a lot of attention gonna be paid to this and a lot of ink spilled.
And Negro pilots aren't part of that story.
Colonel, A.J.
This is coming from way above me.
If you didn't have my respect,
I wouldn't be talking to you face to face.
But we don't win this war, all my regard, everything that you and your men have done, none of it means a thing.
Colonel.
Please see to it that the
General gets to his plane.
Sir.
You like it?
I want you stay in Italia.
You want me to stay?
Does that mean...
Does that mean you'll marry me?
Yes. Marriage.
I love you.
I can't believe it.
I'm getting married.
Okay, we're going to throw it, all right?
There you go.
There you go. All right. Throw!
I'm looking for Captain Julian.
Right here.
You the one they call Easy?
I guess some people do.
What can I help you with?
I'm Captain Miller. I was in prison with Lieutenant Gannon.
He asked me to give his tags to you.
Four of us got out.
The deal was, if we made it and he didn't,
I'd get his dog tags back to his unit.
Ray was a good man.
To whoever it matters, you tell them from me.
Ray was the best soldier I ever met.
Thank you.
A moment, Colonel.
What is it, Captain?
Ray Gannon's dog tags, sir.
A soldier brought it by today.
He and Ray were prisoners together.
They got out from under the Germans, but Ray didn't make it.
Sir, Ray Gun wasn't fit when
I put him back in rotation.
The Flight Surgeon wouldn't clean bill him, so I talked my way right past him.
I just don't feel like I'm fit to lead the squad any more.
I've made so many mistakes.
No, you've made one big mistake.
That self-pity of yours, that's your weakness.
But it ends right here, right now.
You man up, you lead your squad.
Every decision that you make isn't gonna always be the right one.
All right, this is it.
For the first time, the bombers are going all the way to Berlin.
They'll be up against 109s and
262s the new jet fighters.
Unfortunately, we're only going to escort them on the first leg of their mission, so I don't expect you'll see much action.
You will rendezvous with the relief escorts at 0830.
I know this is disappointing to you.
It's not the job you wanted.
But those are your orders.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.
Spread the word, gentlemen.
Julian. A moment.
Captain, if your relief doesn't arrive, as squadron leader, it's your call.
If you think you can make it.
Sir.
That is all, son.
We're past the rendezvous point.
Tail gunner, has the
52nd squadron arrived?
No, sir.
No sign of them.
Anybody got eyes on our relief fighters?
Not a dang thing, Red One.
Are we going all the way, sir?
Fuel-wise, we're looking good.
But I'm guessing the hours there and back, it'll definitely be one for the record books.
Come on, Easy.
It's Berlin.
Let's go.
We can make it.
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.
Yeah! We fight!
Ha-ha! Watch out,
Hitler, here we come!
Just remember, we're here to protect the bombers.
Under all circumstances, we stay on mission.
What's that about?
I think we've got the Red
Tails for the duration.
By my reckoning, we're deep into Germany.
It's a little creepy we haven't seen any fighters yet.
Maybe they found out we were flying escort and decided not to show up.
That'd be nice.
Wouldn't mind that, would you, baby?
Colonel!
It's from Mission Control.
The 52nd didn't make the rendezvous.
They didn't join up with the 5th.
Did our boys turn back?
No, sir. They're headed on to Berlin.
I gave Captain Julian the option.
Headquarters wants to know if we're gonna call them back.
Yes, sir!
Show no mercy.
Oh, shit! Jets!
We got jets!
What the hell?
What? Oh, no!
Maurice!
Mama!
Break! Break! Break!
Here we go.
Nine o'clock low!
I see them.
We're losing them!
I got the throttle wide open!
They're too damn fast!
Son of a bitch!
Those babies are gone.
I'm losing power!
Stay left!
I'll get him!
This is for Maurice!
Yeah!
Brilliant!
Smokey, brilliant!
Easy, we got one crossing in front of us.
Start firing, he'll fly right into it.
I know.
I got him.
These jets ain't nothing.
We need more speed.
Let's get some altitude.
Easy, right there!
Ten o'clock!
I got him!
Now that's how it's done!
Smokey! Smokey!
I'm all right.
I'm all right!
I'll be damned!
They missed me!
No holes in me, baby!
Whoo! Come on.
Now we're losing power on engine four.
That's it for us, guys.
We're turning around.
We got a straggler.
Two o'clock.
Oh, I see him!
I'm on it, Red One. We'll get down there and cover him.
Lightning, form up.
I'm going back.
We got a crippled bomber to protect.
Easy, you got Pretty Boy on your tail.
I'm coming around.
Where? I don't see him!
Die, you...
...foolish African!
Damn it!
I'm heading right for you!
I've got him!
I've got him!
Get out of my way!
What the hell are you doing?
Dive right now! Dive.
Whoo!
That's the end of Pretty Boy!
Sure got him good!
Ha! You did it!
You got that son of a bitch.
Did you say Lightning shot down Pretty Boy?
Whoo-hoo!
Give 'em hell, Lightning!
You just might be the best pilot that ever lived!
Now get your ass back here and help us with this bomber.
We're on our way back to you, Joker.
It was a crazy move. You almost got yourself killed.
I think I did get myself killed.
What are you talking about?
I don't think
I'm going to make it, Easy.
What do you mean, you're not going to make it?
Don't talk like that!
There's a lot...
There's a lot of blood.
Listen to me.
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you back, all right?
Just stay focused.
I'm gonna help you.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Come on now. We've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
I screwed up.
I don't care about that.
I'm right here with you.
We can do this together.
Come on.
Easy.
Gruesome Twosome.
Lightning!
Lightning, talk to me!
Lightning, don't you do this to me!
Lightning?
Lightning, look at me!
I love you.
I'm sorry, Sofia.
Lightning, pull up!
Pull back on your stick!
Lightning, pop the canopy!
Pop the goddamn canopy!
Get out of the plane,
Lightning, that's an order!
Get out of the plane!
Damn you, Lightning!
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, do you read me?
Easy!
Stay on mission!
Do you copy?
We need you back here.
We need you.
For God's sake, tell me you still out there.
I'm okay.
I'm on my way down.
Red One.
Lightning's with you, right?
Lieutenant Little is dead.
Lightning?
Marty?
The expectations placed upon you men are high.
Lieutenant Little exceeded those expectations.
We should not be discouraged by his death, but be all the more encouraged by his life.
The acts of bravery by him will make us stronger.
It will inspire us to fight harder, to make this world free.
Because we are on the side of God Almighty!
Let us pray.
Hey! Hey, guys!
Hey! Guys!
I know you didn't forget about me already!
I've been to hell and back, so you will no longer call me Junior.
From now on you will address me as the fabulous Ray Gun.
How'd you do it, man?
I'll be damned!
Ray!
Ray Gun!
Boy, you look good.

English - US - PSDH
THE WAY BACK
Look at those poor men.
They've got night blindness.
I saw it in the transit camp.
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.
Here, here.
You planning on surviving on half rations, son?
Look, he's an old man.
I'm an old man.
I'll be alive in the morning.
He won't.
Kindness.
That can kill you here.
He's American.
In Here? How?
Stalin hates foreigners, and that includes Poles.
You're Polish, no?
Uh-huh.
I like you Poles.
Your burning sense of injustice, the yearning for freedom.
Khabarov-- Andrei Timofeyevich.
Weiszczek-- Janusz.
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?
A spy.
That's what they told me.
Ten years?
No. 20.
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.
And you were on Soviet side of line, and they arrest you.
They accuse you of spying.
Torture you, huh?
Did you sign confession?
No.
No, I wouldn't sign, so they--they tortured someone else.
Forgive me.
I was actor.
Moving pictures.
In my last picture,
I played aristocrat.
They arrested me when the film was released.
Why?
It was claimed
I was elevating the status of the old nobility.
So you got ten years for a performance in a film.
I've had better notices.
Nyet.
The Urki.
Do you know who these are?
Professional criminals.
Murderers and thieves.
Don't stare at them.
The guards let them run things in here, and they are to be feared.
Then why would they let them run things?
Because they are byproduct of bourgeois society and so friends of people.
We are political prisoners and so enemies of people.
The Soviet Union has become one vast prison.
Slave labor.
They are from far reaches of
Soviet Empire, all caught up in same net.
And, uh, do any of them wriggle out of the net?
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere, even in here.
If you are not more careful, you will die after one year.
If not literally, then spirit.
And how long have you been in here?
Eleven months and 29 days.
You do for me.
You want me to draw you?
No. Not me.
Lice?
Eating me alive.
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.
The mine.
They blast at night.
What are you doing?
We must be quick.
Or this will not be here in the morning.
You're going to leave it here overnight? Why?
You'll see.
It can be done.
I know a way through the wire.
How?
Lazar, my associate, he is overseer of construction.
He showed me.
If you ever escape the camps, and I've been waiting so long for someone like you, someone with the strength, the will to see it through.
But to go where?
I mean, we can't go west.
I mean, apart from the Germans, there's the Soviets.
And east, all Soviet right to the Pacific.
No, no, no, no.
North. Have to be-- have to be south.
Correct.
But do you know where we are?
I mean, exactly?
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal.
This is the lake.
Camp is here.
And the border is here.
We could follow the edge of the lake here.
That runs due south.
Exactly. Then we cross the
Trans-Siberian Railway to the Mongolian border and freedom.
Spring is already upon us.
We will have to wait till autumn.
No. Why wait?
Why?
Because it is a thousand kilometers to the border, maybe more.
We need careful planning.
We need to stockpile food.
I've already begun trading, dealing.
You must do the same.
And in autumn, the weather is more predictable.
We can use the new snow to cover our tracks.
And we bring my friends.
Your friends? You trust them?
Of course.
They won't all survive.
But they will die free men.
Free.
That's a really brave man!
First we need big branches!
One on each side and then one on the back!
Help me, Kazik.
These down there, put it there on the branch.
Yes, yes.
Follow me. We'll both go like this.
What?
Good.
Yes.Put it there.
Zoran! Your blanket!
For a wind break.
Get in. Come on.
Come!
Please come with us! We have shelter!
I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz.
And he's Kazik.
Horodinsky.
They are Polish.
Voss. I'm Latvian.
It's a League of Nations.
And you are?
Smith.
And your first name.
Mister.
Mr. Smith.
That's right.
Might as well have shot us yesterday.
We're for the mines.
These collars same as used by ancient Egyptian people.
Yes, but on their horses, probably.
No. No, no, no. Same for people.
How do you know?
I was professor of Egyptology,
Leningrad University.
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.
I've got to get out of here.
I have to get back.
I have to get back.
It can be done.
What can be done?
He knows a way through the wire.
He has a plan.
Shh. Who has a plan?
His name is Khabarov.
The actor.
Do you know him?
He has no intention of escaping.
What do you mean?
He's a liar.
He's been here for years.
Seeks out new arrivals.
Me, when I first came here.
He just likes to talk about escape.
I've known others like him.
Why should I believe you?
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.
From you he gets your energy, your spirit.
You feed his dream of escape.
You help keep him alive.
He's nothing but a leech.
You are a cold bastard, Mister.
I'm still alive, that's all I know.
But I won't be in another six months, and neither will you. Not here.
Not in these mines.
But if you are serious-- really serious about making a run for it--
I'm with you.
I thought you were a loner.
It can't be done alone.
Besides, you have a--a weakness.
You could be useful to me.
And what is that?
Kindness.
If anything happens to me,
I'm counting on you carrying me.
Khabarov.
Khabarov, come.
What?
Come with me. Now.
What is it? What? What?
Come. Look at this.
Look at this.
We can go. We can go tonight.
The storm will cover our tracks.
No, no, no. What are you talking about?
It's a passing storm!
No, it's enough.
Janusz, that is impossible.
We need-- We need detailed preparation, we need plans, we need maps.
No, no, the timing will never be perfect.
Look, they won't expect it now.
Are you crazy?
What about the distances, huh?
It's, it's a thousand kilometers, and we need food.
Plenty of food.
But, but we have food. You have food.
Look, the American is with us.
We've been trading, just like you said.
How long will that last?
Look, I've spent half my life
In the woods and mountains.
We can live off the land.
You don't understand.
You are too young.
It cannot be done.
What else is there?
You hear me?
To stay here and die?
It cannot be done.
Andrei!
How do we get through that wire?
I don't know what you are talking about.
Your friend Lazar--
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?
You told me that.
Piss off now.
You can't see, can you?
Please don't leave me behind.
Promise me, Andrejs.
I can hold onto your shoulder by night.
I can--I can see shapes.
By day I can see just fine.
I won't hold you up.
Please don't tell the others.
In here, I die.
Swiss.
There are no secrets here.
What do you want?
The game goes against me.
Small debt, they take fingers.
Big debt, they take head.
Me, big debt.
But I never gambie my Wolf.
In forest, you need knife, and I need miracle. Get me out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Look! Keep going. Keep going!
We must keep going! Get up!
Get up!
Activity, or we die right now.
You know how fast the dogs are.
Run, damn you!
Mister, come on, look at me.
Is it time for me to carry you?
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
Janusz, we can't see anything!
The snow is blinding us!
Janusz!
I need your knife!
Give me the knife!
Your knife!
Janusz, we must take shelter!
We can't go on!
Don't you see? This is perfect!
They'll never find us like this.
Never!
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.
He teach me English.
Speak good, huh?
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?
How far have we come?
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.
That's all?
Less, if we've been going in circles like chicken without head.
All right, let's see what we have.
Everyone, come on.
We share everything.
And you?
What?
Do you have?
And that coat.
It's not your coat.
That is Khabarov's coat.
Yes, he gave me.
And...
Huh? Huh?
See?
He was going to inform.
Don't worry. I talk to him.
Everything okay.
You've made a bargain with the devil.
You realize that?
Do you have a knife?
For direction he uses grass and the mosses. What's that?
I swear to God he better know what he's doing.
You should be grateful you're here at all.
Grateful is for dogs.
What-- What's that?
Woives. It's only wolves.
Only wolves.
South.
To Lake Baikal.
You are the Pakhan.
Am I?
What is a Pakhan?
Boss of Urki.
We are not criminals.
We are escaping from criminals.
I have been watching you.
And I swear to God you win my respect with your sticks and pine cones.
I'll come between you and death.
So you want to be my bodyguard?
It's the Urka way.
You have me, and you have the Wolf.
Huh?
Janusz, how long till we get to the lake?
How long?
Three, four weeks.
Maybe more.
I have us here somewhere.
And down here, the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the border of Mongolia.
Mongolia seems so far away.
Mongolia? I go more.
To America.
It's like this-- we have food for another week.
We have no more matches.
But still we have Khabarov's flint.
We need meat.
I can make traps.
We'll be moving too fast to wait for traps.
We find farms, villages, get food there.
Look, there's a bounty on our heads.
Remember that.
We steal it. At night.
They never know.
We are not thieves.
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.
You can watch.
What is that?
Barbed wire.
He's making a fish-hook.
That's how we will survive.
With fish?
Uh.
But I don't eat fish.
Then you'll die.
Come on, we need to make a fire.
Come on, lots of wood.
It'll be 40 below tonight.
Tomasz?
No, no, not too much, not too much.
Kazik?
Kazik?
He's still out, looking for wood.
He has night blindness.
Kazik!
Kazik!
Janusz!
Janusz!
Professor.
I came from the mine to find you.
I thought I was alone.
I've been walking with you for some time.
I'll--
I'll just sit for a minute.
Not far to go.
We made it.
We really made it.
Isn't that something?
Lord, take this innocent soul into thy keeping.
Amen.
A free man died here today.
Still, one less mouth to feed.
What?
They'll find our bones and your drawings a hundred years from now and say "Look, a fine example of Early Gulag Man."
Shut up with your jokes.
Go and find food like the others do.
You do the shutting up!
Drawing all day like you're on holiday.
I'm sick.
I cook. They find food.
What do you ever do?
Nothing.
But I make you all laugh.
No, not anymore, you don't.
So... who will be first?
What do you mean, first?
The first to die.
I think the artist.
But better if it was him, the funny man.
Why better if it's Zoran?
More soft.
More--tender.
Mister only catch little fish now.
We must have meat, or we die here.
You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it.
We all have.
That's why you brought extra people, isn't it?
For food?
No, no, no.
We will get more food when we get to Lake Baikal.
There will be plenty of fish there.
You said we would have seen lake a week ago.
Huh?
We're lost, Pakhan.
Raah!
Yaah!
Yaah!
Yaah!
Yaah!
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,
I will be back in a week.
If I don't, well, you're on your own.
I know.
Our friend Valka.
Don't let him out of your sight.
Here.
Fresh this morning.
Thank you.
Good luck.
And you.
Janusz!
I saw it. I saw it.
I saw the Lake.
Easy, easy.
Three days from here.
Stones! Gather stones!
Heat them in the fire!
What is it?
Psst. Psst.
Pssst. Hey.
Someone's been following us.
He's behind that dark clump of trees.
If he gives us away, they'll be all over us in no time.
He's right. We have to do this.
No killing.
No?
I think you've killed before.
You say too many prayers for an innocent man.
Valka, you go behind in case he makes a run for it. Go.
Spread out, spread out.
Valka, no.
No!
We--we won't hurt you.
Huh.
A Polka.
Polka? What does he want?
I don't know. It's a girl.
And she's Polish.
She's been following us for several days.
And what?
Well, she needs food, you know, protection.
She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russian.
She wants to travel with us?
She's on the run, like us.
She'll slow us down.
She said she's escaped from a Russian collective farm.
I know this type-- street gypsies.
There are thousands like that, less use than a dog!
Pakhan, don't do this. Huh?
Oh, come on. She's starving.
We can barely feed ourselves.
Yeah, maybe it's kinder to leave her.
No, she was sent to us.
We can't leave her.
Janusz, we have no choice.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stay back.
Stay back. Careful of the mud.
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Valka.
Here you are.
Find some wood.
Her name is Irena.
Is the soap ready?
Yes.
Ah, good.
Stir.
Well?
What's so funny?
Are you-- you are going to the office this morning?
Valka?
Valka.
Come on.
You're next. Go, go.
Valka, come on!
Now take off your shirt.
Why do we do this?
So we don't look like thieves and robbers.
Head up.
Now, still.
Very still, please.
Head up.
More.
Nyet.
You know, I, uh, can't beiieve she's Polish.
She's, uh, she's educated.
Speaks good English, French.
Is that right?
You don't like her, do you?
Speak to Valka about her.
He doesn't even think she's Polish.
Well, I did speak to him.
And the others.
They agree she comes with us.
What, you disagree?
There's no room for sentimentality, you know that.
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.
No, it won't take our weight.
We'll have to swim across.
Can you swim?
Yes, Mister.
You wouldn't lie to me.
I'm not lying, Comrade.
And don't call me Comrade.
Irena, no!
Here, come on.
Here, take the food.
Were your parents arrested with you?
They're dead.
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.
When the Russians came, they said we were kulaks and exploiting the peasants.
My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.
I found them later.
I--
I found them face-down in the mud.
They'd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire.
Later, the Russians caught me and sent me to a collective farm.
They were cruel to me.
I ran away.
I had no food.
And then I saw you.
You can't swim, can you?
What?
You've never been near the water in your life.
But I got across, didn't I?
And you followed.
And you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw?
Yes.
Soviets didn't get that far.
That was German territory.
Your parents weren't murdered, were they?
You made all that up.
We've all done terrible things to survives.
But don't ever lie to me again.
We've had enough of lies.
We have to go around it.
Quicker through it.
No, they have dogs.
If they raise the alarm, then we don't stand a chance.
We need food again, Pakhan.
Look, I know we need food, but we can't go into that town and risk arrest.
We're wasting time.
What is it? What's wrong?
Where's Valka?
He was behind Zoran.
Zoran, weren't you watching him?
I'm not his keeper.
Damn him.
He could turn us in for the bounty.
And risk arrest?
He's a gambler.
Irena, do you think he would do that?
He might.
We don't need his knife.
We can make one out of deer bone.
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.
All right, all right.
Come on, let's go.
Watch it funny man?
Hey, hey, hey!
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?
Hmm?
Easy, cowboy.
You tear my coat.
Idiot.
Idlot? Ha.
Am I?
Let's see who is idiot.
What?
Did I kill?
Yes.
A dog.
Don't believe me, then don't eat.
But you will, won't you, because you want to survive.
I know about survive.
All my life.
And-- it's my birthday.
In Russia, that means we drink.
She lived in the streets, like me.
So the story you told us wasn't true.
I thought that story would be more sad and you wouldn't leave me behind.
My parents were Polish Communists.
They took us to live in Soviet Union, to Moscow.
They want to work for the Revolution.
We lived in the Hotel Lux, with lots of foreign Communists.
But they arrested them in 1937.
They said they were spies.
The people pot me in the orphanage.
And my brother, he died.
I was ten years old.
They called me Rykov, but I remembered our Polish name--
Zielinska.
I used to say it every night before I went to sleep.
So you ran away.
Oh.
They have no mosquitoes.
What can we do?
Steal a boat?
No, it's too risky.
People are going to get ill.
I know.
Isn't it strange?
After all we've faced, these tiny insects might bring us down.
There it is again.
No mosquitoes!
Zoran! Zoran!
What's he doing, for God's sake?
Mosquito repellent.
So what you say to him?
Who?
The mosquito man.
Ah.
I'm an escaped convict who is plagued by mosquitoes.
Yeah, very funny.
No, really, what did you say?
Come on, man.
Clown.
Goodbye, Lake Baikal.
Well done.
Mister, did you know Voss is a priest?
No, I didn't know that.
And Tomasz is a pastry chef, but he wants to be an artist.
You don't say.
And Zoran was on business in Moscow, arrested in Red Square.
He said he was just taking a photo of the Kremlin.
He's an accountant.
Well, I'll be damned.
I never knew a funny accountant.
Don't you talk to each other?
In the camps you learn to say as little as possible.
Mr. Smith?
Working on the Moscow Metro?
He's an engineer.
His father was Finnish.
Grew up in America, but he could speak Russian.
And why would an American move to Russia, for God's sake?
The Depression.
His son came with him.
What happened to his son?
They shot him.
He was 17.
The Mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks-- maybe four, five days away.
Can we cross somewhere else?
Here, this is the main line.
It's going to be like this everywhere.
He's right. We wait till tonight.
What?
Nothing. Just looking.
Don't look.
Valka?
What?
Why do you have assholes tattooed on your chest?
I mean, they should be on your ass so you can sit on them every time you take a shit.
You think it's funny?
They are great men.
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!
Don't you know what "Stalin" means, funny man?
Means Man-of-Steel.
He takes from rich and gives to poor.
Yes, of course he does.
Then he takes both of them and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years.
Watch your eyes, crow bait.
Thank you, Mother Russia, for your hospitality, but I will definitely not be coming back.
You know, they'll-- they'll catch you.
Yeah. Prison is okay.
Debt is bad.
But there are many prisons, they don't find me.
What about America?
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.
I wouldn't know what to do with it,
I swear to God.
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.
You don't need him anymore.
Good luck, Valka.
Goodbye, Janusz.
Look. See?
Do you think we'll get there by tonight?
Yes, I think so.
What will we do?
We will eat.
Yes.
We will sleep.
We made it.
Mister!
They're communists.
So it's here too.
This changes everything.
There's nowhere to hide.
It's a Buddhist temple.
They might take us in.
They might also be working with the regime.
It's a risk.
What happened here?
The same as happened in Russia.
Churches closed... priests shot or taken to camps... religion banned.
They came to my church, in Latvia.
Destroyed everything, much like this.
I went back later that night, and there was a lone-- lone guard.
Just a boy.
And I strangled him until his eyes popped right out of his head.
Valka knew somehow.
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.
How far is China?
I don't know.
Maybe five, six hundred kilometers due south.
600 kilometers?
Is Chlna free?
They're fighting the Japs.
I know that much.
After China is Tibet.
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.
What?
What are you talking about?
They say we could go beyond Tibet, over the mountains to India.
What mountains?
The Himalayas.
Join the British Army.
Fight Nazls, then fight the Russians.
Go over the Himalayas?
How? On a magic carpet?
How?
We walk.
Careful.
Come on, wake up.
I was in the middle of this beautiful dream.
I was about to eat some salt.
I almost taste it.
I just want to go back to that dream.
It's a very simple recipe.
You just need two sprigs of rosemary and a pinch of nutmeg.
Nutmeg? What about the salt?
No, we'll--we'll get to that. Now-- add the oil--
Mm-hmm.
And you leave it to marinate while you prepare the chicken.
This is where the salt comes in.
Good.
You rub it into the skin of the chicken with a little bit of the paprika.
But double the salt.
Look, you cannot just doubie the sait.
It'll be too salty then.
I don't care, just doubie the sait.
I'm not going to ruin it.
Just double the salt, please.
No.
Tomasz--
No.
All right, all right.
Everybody keep calm.
Oh, my God!
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.
Hey, whoa! Whoa!
Everybody smile.
Hello. Hello.
That's south.
Are we going to eat that?
It's either this or fish.
It looks like a bird's nest.
It will protect you from the sun.
Irena, try this for your feet.
South.
Come on, we keep going.
No, it's another mirage.
We have no water.
There's trees there.
If there's trees, there--there's water.
No, I don't care.
It's east. We're going south.
But, Janusz, we've got to give it a try.
No, no, no. We must keep going south, or you'll kill us all.
Damn it!
Janusz, we're dying.
We're already dying.
Stop.
It's a mirage!
It's just a mirage.
Mirages don't have birds.
Mirages don't have birds!
It's a well!
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.
At least we have water here.
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.
Yeah, but no food.
Maybe nomads will come to water their flocks.
When?
Next week, next month?
We should stay here at least a few more days.
Look, without food, we'll only get weaker.
And then maybe too weak to travel.
I don't know. After these last days--
I don't know if
I can go through that again.
It was a miracle finding this.
Can we count on another?
Janusz?
Okay, give me your best.
Ohh!
Ah, ha ha!
Wait, wait, wait!
Go, Tomasz!
Hat, please.
Lower.
Run! Run!
Get back, get back! Take cover!
Behind that dune!
Irena! Get down!
Don't be afraid!
Irena.
Irena.
Sun-dried fish.
Thank you.
Here.
Can you find our way back to the well?
It was way off course.
Remember? I mean, way east.
There's no--
There's no features in this wasteland.
I could never find it.
When I helped my father in the fields during the hot summers, we used to suck on small stones like these.
Made us feel less thirsty.
Janusz!
Sunstroke?
I'm becoming a nuisance.
No, no, no.
Do they hurt you?
No, not at all.
They must be swelling because I've walked so far.
Don't you think, Mister?
Yes.
You lie back down now.
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.
Irena, we can stop for a while.
No.
Just suck on this.
No! Please, no! No!
Shh. Shh.
Come on. We've got to keep going.
My name is Irena Zieilnska.
Shh.
My name is Irena Zieilnska.
Shh, shh, shh.
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.
Just lay me on the ground.
It's okay.
Command thine angels to receive her and to take her to heaven-- her country.
Amen.
I really like this one.
When did you do that?
Second night in the Gulag.
Poor Kazik, always in trouble with his feet.
Who is this?
You.
Looks like my father.
Is that how I look now?
No.
Now, you look worse.
You caught her smile.
Look.
This is--just a sketch.
But I'll work on it.
I'll do it.
That's really fine work.
You're a great artist, Tomasz.
It's almost like a photography.
It's the shadow.
It's really nice.
We have to get to those hills.
Water may be trapped there.
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.
Mister.
Come on.
Go on without me.
I'm done.
Go.
Zoran... you go to the hills and look for water.
And you wait for us there.
No.
Yes.
We'll catch up.
Did you find water?
No.
Show me.
Please show me.
Where--?
Where are you?
There's-- water!
Zoran.
Around here.
Look at that, uh?
What if--if it's poisonous?
How can we eat it?
No, no, no, we cut off its head.
Here. Give me the knife.
Ah, look at that.
Tastes like chicken.
Yeah.
A big, black, poisonous chicken with no legs.
Well, it's not bad.
You know,
Valka talked of eating each other when we were in Siberia.
He did?
Yes.
And? Would you have eaten me?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
I would never have eaten you.
Well, why not?
Too stringy and bitter.
I'd rather eat snake.
Here's some water.
It can kill you, remember?
What?
Kindness.
How long can you survive on mud and snakes?
Just leave me here.
You can't, can you?
Look, Mister--
What?
You know,
I may not even know your first name, but i, uh--
I know your son's name.
Irena told you?
Yes.
Can I say his name?
David.
Saying his name won't bring him back.
What are you trying to do, give me the will to live?
Is that it?
Stop me from giving up?
And are you giving up?
In the camps, some saw death as freedom.
Then why didn't you just kill yourseif?
Survival was a kind of protest.
Being alive was my punishment.
Punishment for what?
I brought David to Russia.
And now no one can forgive you.
And you can't forgive yourself.
Irena told me... that they tortured your wife... and she informed on you.
Yes.
They did the same thing to my boy.
Then they shot him in the head.
My wife is alive.
She lived-- and was released. That much I know.
But she'll never be able to forgive herseif for what she's done.
You see, only I can do that.
She will be torturing herself, just like you.
So you see, I have to get back.
I-have-to-get-back.
Janusz.
Pack your things, quick.
Janusz!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
Tibet.
Lhasa.
And where is India?
Mmmm.
India.
India. Yes.
There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains.
Many people go there.
Are there villages on the way?
Small villages, yes.
They give you food.
Fuel for fire.
But you can't go now.
Why?
If big snow comes, very difficult.
You wait until spring.
This family keep you.
Well, we can't cross the mountains in winter.
He said it was difficult but not impossible.
Janusz, it's only three months.
Look, we can't let go.
What do you mean?
If we stop now, then we'll give
In to exhaustion.
No, it's not giving in.
We are exhausted.
I will sleep till spring like a bear in a cave.
You can study Buddhism and become a monk.
But first you must learn how to like their tea.
I already like the tea.
Good night.
What about you, Mister?
What are you going to do for three or four months?
I'm going to Lhasa.
Our friend has a contact.
He thinks he can get me out through China.
There's a U.S. military mission there.
Looking out for number one.
Isn't that what you Americans say?
Zoran--
Zoran.
What?
We escaped.
We made it.
You're right.
He's right.
Apart from a few mountains, we are there.
We made it.
Not all of us.
No, not all of us.
What are you going to do, Mister?
When you go back home.
Home?
Build Metros?
Might drift a while.
I will fight.
First Germans, then Russians.
And then?
Re-build your church?
No.
I will die fighting.
I'm going to get Tomasz' pictures to a newspaper or get them published somehow.
And then I'm going to cook his chicken but with extra salt, just--just to annoy him.
And you, Janusz?
As long as the communists are in Poland, you cannot go back.
They'll shoot you, Janusz.
I'll just, uh--keep going, you know, until it's over.
I'll just keep walking.
He's gone.
Janusz!
Janusz!
Namaste.
Namaste.
Welcome to India.
Paper passport, please.
Passport.
We--we--we don't have.
Never mind. Come with me.
Where have you come from?
Siberia.
Siberia?
And how did you come, sir?
We walked.
Walked?
Easytobeaman
So... returning from the past to mourn the present fate of Flanders.
Yes.
And when the painting is done, you may have it if you wish.

Why did you do that?
- Don't speak...
- No.
Line up!
I can't abide by these high-handed methods.
At times I can barely contain myself.
These foreign mercenaries in their red tunics are here to do the bidding of their
Spanish masters who lorded over us.
Every day, their manners remain a stench in the nostrils.
And an offence to pride, to Christian humility and common sense itself.
I'm a citizen of Antwerp.
A banker of repute.
Collector of paintings.
I'm also a member of the 'Schola Caritatis'.
A brotherhood men of all confessions
without requiring them to abjure.
I believe, and many others in this magnificent city also believe
that good men of all confessions can come together in peace and
good understanding. And that is not the opinion of the king of Spain,
who is also our king, alas.
It is now his pleasure that all heritage should be put to death.
The men by decapitation, and the women
women...
I have seen it all.
My painting will have to tell many stories.
It should be large enough to hold everything.
Everything, all the people.
There must be a hundred of them.
I will work like the spider
I saw this morning building its web.
First it finds an anchoring point.
Here, the heart of my web.
Below the grindstone of events
our Saviour is being ground ike grain, mercilessly.
I was shown our Saviour being led to Golgotha by the red tunics of the Spanish militia.
Although he has fallen at the center of my painting,
I must hide him from the eye.
- Why would you want to hide him?
- Because he is the most important.
But you might have missed it.
Now if you look here,
Simon is taken away from Esther to help carry the cross.
And they all look at Simon, not at the Saviour.
Then there is a mill, based on a rock.
It is the axis around which all the people circle between Life and Death.
The miller just stands there, looking down on everything.
Why have you put him so high up?
- In most paintings,
God is shown parting the clouds, looking down on the world in displeasure.
In my painting, the miller will take his place.
He is the great miller of the Heaven
grinding the bread of Life and Destiny.
The bread is then carried around by the pedlar
sitting here.
Hoorah!
Here is the city.
It forms a circle within its walls.
The circle of Life.
And next to it is the tree of Life
with fresh leaves.
On the other side is a black circle.
The circle of Death.
It's formed by the crowd gathering around the execution like flies.
And here below is the tree of Death.
A horse's skull next to it.
And the two men: you and I.
Nothing is going to happen.
When I think about yesterday,
when he walked into town, strolled out onto the Cathedral square
and spoke his mind.
How they listened.
How they cheered.
How enthralled they all were.
Even the soldiers.
And now that we're walking through the streets in a trance,
the same soldiers who cheered him yesterday came out to arrest him last night.
The same crowd that listened enthralled
has been screaming for his head all morning.
Nothing was going to happen.
Look at the mother of the condamned man and his friends.
Do you remember the 'Adoration of the Magi'?
I did it earlier this year.
My wife served as the model for the Mother of God.
I'm sure you recognized her.
It was just after she gave birth to little Peter.
She was such a lusty girl,
womanly, and motherly.
Here she is again, thirty years later.
Same attitude and same face.
But now the child that gave her fulness and joy
is taken away.
She's utterly destroyed.
I don't understand.
When he grew up, neighbours used to tell me
that the decisions of Fate were spelled out in the fiery letters in the sky.
They alone commanded the seasons.
As of course they would say.
I suppose they really do.
And they also decree who is to live and who to die.
But he.
My child. My boy.
Oh, when he was grown he amazed us all.
It was though he walked unhindered,
straight up to the stony gates of Heaven.
Plucked all the torches that light the way up there
night and day, the fires of Fate,
and swung them laughingly to the earth.
"I have come to cast fire on you",
he would tell those who came to hear.
"It's in our power to grasp the fire of Fate
"in our own hands."
That's what he said.
And then his laughter.
It was so...
He was so...
Agua.
I knew the man.
I myself was there when he said some of the things that are now being held against him.
That he'd tear down the cathedral and build it anew in three days.
None of us had any problems with that.
We understood that he was speaking about reform.
Just look at that.
They're violating and humiliating our bodies and souls.
Violating and humiliating Charity and Virtue.
Our land will be reduced to beggary.
If only time could be stayed.
If it were only brought to a stop.
Then we could wrestle the senseless moment to the ground, clearly speak its name to its face and break its power.
You think you can express this?
Yes.
How?
Now if you look here,
Simon is taken away from Esther to help carry the cross.
And they all look at Simon.
Not at the Saviour.
Be it the birth of Jesus,
the fall of Icarus
or the death of Saul casting himself on his sword.
All these world-changing events
went unnoticed by the crowd.
So just like this spider,
I built my web,
hoping to catch the viewer's eye.
Now the stage is set.
How can I just stand here?
What can I do? I can't think clearly.
No, I don't understand.
He was born for a reason.
I knew that from the day he stirred in me.
And when he grew up
he brought a light into the world.
And this light threatened the sly and dark convenience
of our rotten usage and custom.
He was a threat to every dangerous fool
whose concern is with neither God nor Man
but with his own miserable certainties and power.
And now it's dark.
Custom and usage have won the night.
And I no longer understand.
ONG BAK -3- (2010)
Now you will suffer ...
Remember that you have a mission.
It is more important than your life.
Come back to us .. to complete your task ...
It appears you have not understood this situation. You Will not get out of here alive.
That remains to be seen.
Not to compare against me, your
Destiny is not superior to mine.
Sometimes common sense can vehement your future ...
Now you are mine.
I'll finish!
Help me!
According to the law of this land. all his rights have been removed.
This rebel must be exemplarily punished. to death.
Acábenlo!
Have you regret offended your Emperor?
Then end up in hell.
Thanks, as always.. you have went well, you're improving.
Do not worry, the angels will protect you.
They will help in this.
See what's going on?
The more you have to take this?
I know, we have to do something, or it will get worse.
It's easy to speak, but no one to cope.
Halt! I will defend!
Now get out of here, go away!
I could have helped ...
You have to go back!
I'll be awaiting your return.
Do not forget! Do not forget!
I curse.
That you will have a miserable end.
I curse.
That you will have a miserable end.
Have you heard then palabas sacred.
I therefore perform this ritual.
So that the gods will bless you if you stay loyal to me.
Let the ceremony begin.
Those who disobey will be cursed and damned.
And be tormented to the end.
I curse.
That you will have a miserable end.
I curse.
That you have great skills.
Come, work for me.
And I will give you more power than they can.
Can you give me grace?
But there is nothing you have that I want, your highness.
Take your reward.
You have no position to negotiate.
Just obey.
How dare you negotiate with Lord Rajasena?
Having nightmares lately?
Only the cursed have nightmares.
This will continue throughout your entire life.
Someone cursed you.
Only I can break that curse.
Come to me.
Cut off his head first thing in the morning.
Executor.
Execute him.
Stop the Execution!
All kneel.
By order of King Avant, this execution will not continue.
How can this happen?
This is the work of a traitor.
You know this?
I am not, My Majesty
I will not.
The others must know about this.
I curse.
I curse you, curse you.
That you will have a terrible outcome.
Take him to the infirmary.
Please look after this man.
Take him.
Over here.
He is in critical condition.
This is for my father, Lord Sihandecho.
By the head of the rebel!
How dare you?
My Lord.
Did you wait?
Tien is still under critical condition.
Will not be easy for him to recover.
We will remember his past life.
This is destiny.
This will happen.
There is nothing we can possibly do.
It's something that we have to face.
However,
There is an option.
It is a very old technique.
Thousands of years ago.
The sculpture of the ong bak head.
Has such healing power,
That will reincarnate both a person body and your soul.
He's alive ...
We did it!
This is happening again!
Go away all, what the hell i wrong with me?
Rest ..
You'll be better.
I will help you.
You were very badly wounded.
Look at that, I feel bad.
Now stop bothering!
Leave me alone!
You worry too much, you're only shattered.
Too bad you have to end your young life.
You only know how to complain.
What else do I have? I have nothing.
I think not.
You just have to trust yourself.
You're crazy! I have nothing!
Trust yourself.. don't be crazy ...
It does not matter, this is your destiny, not mine..
Hey look.
You have to understand you are more important than anyone else.
Nonsense, this does not help.
This would, if you would listen.
I have no strength to do it.
You were born with a splendid future.
If so, why the hell I failed?
I cannot help if you want to stand without any support.
You're only using your two legs, my son.
Tien ...
Look in front of you
The light always comes after the dark.
Look below you.
It's only you can't see
If at any time you were afraid, you're missing a little light to clarify your vision.
Do not get confused.
You are much more than you expect,
You have a destiny to fulfill.
This ...
It will be difficult.
You must have strength.
Go to the secret compound.
Tien, you must not crawl.
Do not hesitate.
Your destiny has been written, my good warrior.
But it really depends on you.
Father!
I will end with you.
From now on
There will be a new governor.
Nobody can get me.
But there was nothing with the expected date ...
Let's show what you can do.
Revenge!
No escape.
Everything will be accomplished.
Tien, your name means "candle". It is a symbol of light.
Light means wisdom.
Separate from darkness.
Unleash your mind.
Wisdom applies to the entire world.
I brought you something.
Sure you will like.
Yes.
Lovely.
I knew.
I want to thank you.
For you have helped me.
Thanks to you. I've recovered my body.
I will be eternally grateful.
It is still early to appreciate.
Remember that you have a mission.
There are many dangers in this world, son.
You know you face the one that plagues our land.
Surely you do understand.
Fear not, you'll be well prepared.
Remember it is not something one can deny.
Can I beat him?
Use tactics ...
Only tactic ...
Use the river.
Feel the power of nature.
Be as one, you and her.
The more you assimilate, the more you will be part of it.
Remember ... Always focus.
Come on, do not resist the power.
Who said that?
You have arrived ...
Face your destiny.
What are you doing?
To kill you.
You will have a tragic end!
It will be your end.
Acábenlo!
Everyone, go! do not leave him alive!
Your kingdom should belong to powers that even you can understand.
You'll be damned!
You'll be damned ..
I will win ..
Not ... the end.
Misery ...
It is not the end.
Everyone bow before me!
Now I am your king!
You have another guest.
Come!
There.
Do not be afraid.
Over here.
There it is!
If .. But do you have?
And all those people?
That sure does hurt.
Okay, retire.
Well I can not control.
Do not remove it.
That's not fair ...
I want to play.
Damn.
Now that was fun.
Not bad, huh?
What did I do now?
Ready.
It is time for your destination.
Everyone watch!
No way.
I come for you.
I was waiting.
You come to your own funeral.
Look, now I'm the king of this kingdom.
And you will only meet your end destination.
You see?
Luck is on my side.
Let me go!
Leave him!
Let me go! now ..
Try to finish ...
See anything else?
Should I stay?
The force is already in.
I have finished your heart.
Now you'll never beat me.
Think so.
I have a destiny to fulfill
You dare?
The peace between
Catholics and Huguenots had lasted nearly a year when in autumn 1567 the war resumed as suddenly as an ill smothered brushfire.
In the name of Christ, fire!
Kill, Nicolas!
PRINCESS OF MONTPENSIER
We part ways here, Nicolas.
We do?
I'm done fighting.
I'm going home, to Maucombe.
You're deserting?
But you'll be...
No more barbarity for me.
Farewell.
Hear that?
Bells sounding a truce, perhaps even peace.
The soldiers have been here 2 days.
Peace, perhaps.
But not for you, sir.
You're banished from both sides.
By the King for choosing the Reform.
By the Reform for deserting.
You may go, Nicolas.
I can't pay you.
May God keep you.
Keep your horse. The mule, too.
And you, sir?
You'll be hanged.
We know that.
You first, brother.
He's cursed.
He crossed himself backwards three times.
So we're hanging him.
Aren't you...
Monsieur de Chabannes?
Quercy!
Philippe...
I feared you dead.
Lucky for you I'm not.
I've missed you so, master.
Meet Count de Chabannes.
For 5 years I was his pupil.
He taught me all I know.
But he seems to have forgotten his own lessons.
Never let fatigue lower your guard.
Sleep sheltered, off the trail.
What miracle led to this meeting?
No miracle, sheer necessity.
I was headed to my last hope:
Your father, the Duke.
I'm ruined.
I found you, I'll keep you.
Not only ruined, but banished.
I deserted.
You must have had good reason.
You'll explain as we ride.
My father wants to marry me off.
I'll know to whom when we reach Mézières.
Join my escort.
What about them, my lord?
Don't waste the rope.
Lighter than last year, but lingering on the tongue.
Taste it.
In fact, I'm not here for your wine, Marquis.
My son returned from the last campaign alive and well.
He's revoked his promise to Mademoiselle de Longuemain, whose frivolity is plain to all.
Hence he is free.
And?
Your daughter Marie is a marvel of honesty and grace.
My daughter?
Long promised to Mayenne, you know.
A spoken promise. That I know, too.
Taking back one's my word to Guise means disaster.
What disaster?
I bring you blood as good as the Guises'.
Those foreigners!
30 years ago still allies of Rome and the Hapsburgs.
- True. But Duke, my word...
- What word? Between us, fine!
Bourbons, Valois, Broglie...
Promises I can respect.
But the Guises always going for the highest bidder.
So what is their word worth?
Yes, but...
Do you realise at least that the Cardinal is cheating you?
Think about it.
Mayenne...
Why does he offer you Mayenne?
Why not his brother Henri, who enjoys your daughter's favour?
To fix him up, my dear man.
He's fobbing him off on you.
You leave them together too much.
Henri asked me to.
And you obey?
He's our elder. You obey him, too.
I'm a girl.
Be a man!
Resist him, or he'll marry Marie.
Then everyone would be happy.
Look. It's my brother she loves.
It's madness.
Not madness.
We gave ourselves to one another.
Not gave, promised.
- You promised my brother nothing?
- Him? No.
I promised nothing.
I gave him something.
A slap.
You care nothing for him?
Only because he cares for you,
Henri.
You two will never be far apart.
Nor you from me.
Careful!
The old women are watching.
Mayenne, you must meet your brother's challenge.
It's already lost.
I'm beaten beforehand.
You know Henri's strength.
I only stand a chance at dice.
Come along, coward.
Time for your lesson.
And you know the Guises have lost influence, but they're still ogres, gluttons, greedy for money, power and honours.
Were Marie not the realm's richest heiress, they'd hunt elsewhere.
You're mistaken, I believe.
My daughter seems inclined toward...
Nothing a few stern words won't fix!
If we agree, I'll surrender the land we've quarelled over for 10 years.
A full 20-league parcel for the hunt!
And I'll speak to the Queen Mother, whose ear I've had since she's cooled to the Guises.
I'll speak to my wife and daughter.
No, to me.
You'll speak with me!
Now! Say yes.
And we summon the notaries.
They won't only be here for the wine.
My son.
I took the liberty of asking him to join us.
- Here?
- Here.
His future's at stake.
I show what I sell.
- I've known Philippe...
- War changed him.
Cardinal!
I can read the news on your faces.
And it is not good.
I came for my annual wine order...
And the talk turned from the wine to the heiress. Not unusual.
Cardinal...
So you take back your word?
In my daughter's interest...
So I was right!
You humiliate not only me but the entire Guise family.
Expect no favours from them.
Allow me to speak to my nephews first.
I shall try to control Henri.
Your annual order...
This discovery of your daughter's interest...
What a coincidence!
And your son's sudden appearance...
Philippe knows nothing.
You have our word.
Oh, gentlemen!
Your word!
- Philippe!
- Cousin!
What a pleasant surprise!
Not since the fray at Saint-Denis.
You charged with Montmorency...
And you with the Yellow Crosses.
Catherine.
Marie.
How you've changed in 2 years!
The Court will envy you, Mayenne.
Come, relieve me of the boredom of this oaf.
My brother daydreams while I rust from disuse.
Out of the blue?
Indeed.
- What's the score?
- You know very well.
You lead by three hits since Longjumeau.
- Only three?
- Yes, only three.
I won back two at the Louvre.
Such impatience, young men.
Greet us first, scrape later.
Your father would speak to you privately.
And your uncle awaits you in the gallery.
Very well.
We shall resume later.
You've lost weight, Chabannes.
I'll shortly give you details of a decision.
The Guise honour won't be tarnished!
Take Chabannes under your protection until the King's ire passes.
And fear that of the Guises.
You have offended me, cousin.
I never forget an offense.
Henri!
I don't understand. Why him?
And his fury?
There's no offense to him.
If anyone, Mayenne...
Precisely.
It's all settled, I told you.
I made an agreement with his father.
You'll marry Montpensier!
No, Father!
You will yield! You must!
I order you!
I will host the Guises tonight.
You will consent before they go, or everything will wobble.
This marriage suits me.
You will yield, or enter a convent.
I'm prepared to.
I've tamed worse than you!
The Guises leave tomorrow and you'll forget all this. Yield!
You must! I'm your father!
It's your duty to obey!
My friend.
Leave us, Jeanne.
Control yourself, proud child.
And submit.
I know you are intelligent.
Youth makes you defiant.
Your feelings for Guise are too conspicuous. Control them.
And let reason guide your future.
Think what marriage to that dreamer Mayenne would lead to, bringing you near the one who desires you.
And to whom you're drawn.
Sooner or later, you would both yield to temptation and no good would ensue.
Marry Montpensier.
He's an ordinary brute with no reputation yet, either good or bad.
Daughter, love is the most awkward of things.
I thank heaven every day your father and I have been spared such trouble.
Submit.
Don't fight the fate I must endure.
I beg of you.
What do you fear from me?
It's myself I fear.
He sleeps so soundly.
My brother doesn't dream of you.
It's my sleep you haunt.
Give me something of yourself.
Providence spares us great folly by parting us.
My father wants a wedding before Michaelmas.
I said yes.
They say the Romans... or the Greeks, I don't know...
Some people from Italy...
They fed lampreys like my cook does eels.
He feeds men to your eels?
No, he finely chops intestines and livers from poultry and game, adds a little pork, making a sort of sausage meat he throws to the eels which, in fresh water running over a bed of fine gravel, fatten in a month.
The one I offer you today weighed 9 lbs.
A serpent...
How did you prepare it?
Skinned, browned, spread with anchovy butter, rolled in fine bread crumbs, under the grill another ten seconds, and served with olive oil beaten with lemon, mustard and hot pepper.
You mother taught you nothing?
Close your eyes.
Well?
We heard nothing.
Just a mousy squeak.
But there's blood.
I believe you've won, my friend.
Thankyou.
I'm off. I have rents to collect in Tourneuil.
Get comfortable.
It's a long journey.
At least 10 days.
We leave in an hour.
Mr. De Chabannes seems very attached to you.
As much as I to him.
It's only natural.
For 5 years, he taught me all that is good in me, in my heart, manners and mind.
His qualities are matchless.
Yet did he not suddenly leave
Mr. De Condé's service?
Is it a quality to betray one's camp like that?
I'll let him explain, if he deems it necessary.
My father, before dying, recommended me to two dear friends:
The Prince of Condé, with the Reform, and the Duke of Montpensier, a Catholic nobleman.
Condé being the first to honour my request,
I entered his service and campaigned with him.
But every day I dreaded meeting the Prince, your husband, on a battlefield.
However, I knew
I could only salute him and not fight.
One event enlightened me as brutally as Paul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
But unlike Paul, it didn't blind me.
It opened my eyes and mind.
I had just, in Christ's name, killed a pregnant woman.
How can people of the same blood and faith kill each other in the name of the same God?
So I threw down my weapons.
I resolved then to give up war,
Madame, and not only the Huguenot camp.
For a time, Mont-sur-Brac will be your kingdom.
Modest, but of our castles, the farthest from the war.
In your company it will be pleasant.
As none other could make it?
What could be better company than my husband's?
I warned you, it's quite rustic.
Do you think I was raised in gentleness and satin?
The Ladies of Longwy schooled me.
They weren't tender.
So you've no fear of convents...
Forgive me.
My parents, the Duke and Duchess, wish to keep their apartments here for rare visits.
The choice is yours:
This side has more sun, the other a better view.
I love the sun.
Will you love me, too, Madame?
When you order me to.
We considered awaiting your recovery, but Mézières might change his mind.
So I moved up the wedding.
And the dowry?
Mézières only quibbled over the horses.
- We have plenty.
- No, the war's taken a quarter.
Mézières yielded on everything:
The furniture, linens, copperware,
Venetian glass...
He even added 8 male peacocks and 2 hens, but I refused.
Why? I love peacocks!
You forget our watchdogs.
They'd have devoured them.
Lock up the dogs.
Peacocks, like geese, warn of intruders.
Dogs warn...
- and bite!
- They don't lay eggs.
It's done, my dear.
I exchanged them.
For falcons.
Always the hunt!
They bled me twice, this morning and just now.
I'm exhausted.
Your illness runs out with the blood.
I find you better.
We return to Paris tomorrow.
You'll sleep on the way.
The young people will gladly be rid of us.
The Guises were vile.
The Guises are always vile.
She keeps complaining.
Gently!
Don't touch me.
It hurts!
Help me!
- Be brave, dear.
- I'm going to die!
The King asks for us.
I must leave you.
Leave us.
On the battlefield, spare yourself.
Think of those two who value your life more than their own.
I won't forget.
Madame, let me bid you farewell.
Come back quickly.
The campaign will be brief.
Just long enough to pluck some glory.
Farewell.
I'd follow you. But you know the disgrace that bars me.
I'll plead your case.
You serve me better serving my wife.
Use this time to instruct her.
She knows neither art nor poetry.
I want her equal to her rank at Court.
Farewell.
You heard, sir, what arduous task awaits you.
I'm not afraid, Madame.
You have a fine mind for learning.
This defeat announced to the Romans...
Not, to the Romans. To Rome.
It's a singular accusative.
Start again.
I know Latin.
Little.
And poorly.
Enough.
And well enough.
I want to write.
If I can write Latin,
I'll read better.
Writing gives you time to learn and understand.
Writing takes time.
I have more than enough.
Very well... tomorrow.
Now.
Please.
I think it's Delphinus.
The dolphin constellation.
The Arabs call it the Camel.
And the Hebrews the Whale.
Do you believe they influence our fate?
I have no certainty either way.
- But when you're at Court...
- Me?
You really believe it?
Don't forget Queen Catherine, her son the King and the Court believe in the influence of the stars.
At least don't fight it.
Let them talk. Listen.
At Court, everyone imitates.
So imitate.
But what do you think?
Me?
I believe, like many great minds who sought to understand the heavenly, and thus divine mechanics, that the stars give us a wonderful example by which to govern society.
Bound to immutable paths that obey the universal hierarchy of the weak kept in the orbit of the powerful, they teach us...
Resignation?
Not resignation.
Simple obedience to the laws of equilibrium and modesty without which terrible collisions would occur, causing terrible calamities.
Terrible calamities...
Weren't we to work on triangles?
Didn't we say later?
I promised the women in the kitchen a remedy for chilblains.
I know where the herb grows.
I was going...
To go out?
I'll come along.
Apium graveolens grows in muddy soil.
You also know cures?
You're a very useful person,
Mr. De Chabannes.
A few remedies.
At home in Quercy, women hand down the recipes.
That way.
A woman taught you?
I didn't say that.
Not a woman?
Yes, but...
I wasn't prying, you know.
But now I am curious.
Aren't we good enough friends?
This woman you hide...
Was she your wife?
I can't cross.
Here it is.
I found it.
It's lovage.
L-o-v-a-g-e.
Also called wild celery.
I boil it...
I wouldn't be ashamed to speak of a person I once felt for.
- What makes you...
- I went through the ordeal.
Now I'm cured.
Never have I...
I am cured.
You mustn't have suffered much.
I suffered enough.
Before the Prince?
The Prince was the cure.
We were still almost children.
He was the handsomest boy around me.
He frightened me at first, because he always fought for honour, and perhaps for amusement.
These fights scarred his face.
He looked like Henri de Guise...
But it wasn't him.
It wasn't him.
I learned in the convent never to confide in anyone.
I'm moved by your trust.
Where do we stand in this endless war?
Battles, truce, hostilities resumed...
Do you think it will last long?
I hope not.
Between ending and enduring,
I no longer know what I hope.
Your horse!
We took Condé's banner.
The rest fled.
Good news, cousin.
Have you any other?
Of home?
News of my cousin, your wife,
Marie?
Is the thought of sin already a sin?
Not without desire, no.
Or it's highly venial.
And the thought with desire?
I'm not a confessor.
I'll ask him.
My confessor.
I'll ask him.
You don't only charm my kitchen staff.
The chilblains, Madame.
Come, come.
There's no harm in a smile here and there.
Are you still cross with me?
Cross? Why?
In fact, I'm pleased by your sudden show of interest.
So I've ruffled you.
Please forgive me, Count.
I meant no harm.
They're only words.
Not only your words, but your silence, too, showed legitimate indifference.
The space required between pupil and master.
What is your reproach, then?
No reproach.
I only reproach myself.
All this daily happiness has blinded me.
I should have fled.
I thought age had released me from the grip of passion.
- Are you saying...
- Yes, Madame. I love you.
You quickly forget your own teachings.
Isn't the world's equilibrium assured by small stars which keep their place in the celestial hierarchy?
Your words are forgotten.
They must have been due to the fatigue of reading and study.
We won't discuss it again.
Do you hear the lark?
Not a lark.
An oriole.
You say oriole to scold me for not learning the poem.
I found it meaningless.
- You don't like poetry?
- I do, but not the singsong of the lines:
"Fluttering, chanting, regretting..."
Bing, bing, bing!
What you call "singsong" is rhyme, Madame.
The rhyming lines are verse.
I don't like verse.
Hence poetry.
I do.
Sometimes I do.
When I sense music or feelings.
What you call feeling is a mere tweet of a flute.
Real feeling has altogether more gravity, more depth.
What's more, in its presence, you don't recognise it.
A lark!
It's a lark!
Herbal teas, ointments, elixirs and salves!
For the ladies, cloth, ribbons, lace and silks!
But also, beauty powders, rouge, ointments...
- Necklaces...
- Cedar!
News! Give us the news!
Yes, news!
News, of course.
But news has a price:
5 sols.
Too much!
Pitch in together.
With one who can read!
Here.
To give you a foretaste, some free news...
The son of a local bailiff eviscerated himself jumping out a lady's window when her husband caught her, arms spread... and legs, too!
The war!
Yes, the war!
Bad times for that Huguenot hogwash spouted by Admiral Coligny who was run out of Grézaucourt by our Duke of Anjou.
One hero of the day is Duke Henri de Guise, time and again seen in the heat of battle.
"...time and again seen in the heat of battle."
Your erstwhile feelings don't seem as extinct as you claimed.
They've changed, Count!
I feel joy on hearing the merits of a man whose exploits justify the inclination I once had for him.
You must portion it out.
- Me?
- You.
It's your seigniorial duty.
I know nothing about what I must do.
My duties, life...
This war, for instance,
I don't know what it's about.
Religious matters, of course, deeply felt.
- The trade in indulgences...
- Yes, I know.
The Saints, the Virgin, the Pope...
Everything the heretics reject.
But what is "real presence," really?
What does it really mean?
That the holy wafer contains the body of Christ.
And the wine in the challis is His blood.
St. John Chrysostom, Golden Mouth, expressed it simply:
That which is in the cup is the same as what flowed from Christ's wounds.
But it's a question of belief, not understanding.
Yes, but...
It's an article of faith.
But faith?
Ah, faith!
St. Paul defines it perfectly in Hebrews:
"Faith gives substance to our hopes
"and makes us certain of realities we cannot see."
The same could be said about love.
For you, sir.
It's the Prince, your husband.
He wants me by his side.
You'll leave tomorrow.
Now. An escort awaits me at Vieux-Sec.
You must write.
Give news.
With you gone, what could interest him?
You!
Everything about you.
Your health, your reading...
How you spend your days, what you eat...
The stars you gaze at...
- He'll gaze at the same ones.
- He doesn't know them.
The stars.
I know them.
I'll show them to him.
Write.
Where?
And how?
Ask the bailiff for messengers.
The Prince will be with the Duke of Anjou.
They always know where the Duke is.
I acted in haste.
But I have no one who can read and write.
And the captains don't care for me.
You won't fight.
She'll waste away from boredom without you.
I should have left you with her.
Yes, I should have.
Anjou's tent.
He commands in the absence of his brother the King.
Perhaps you should go in alone.
No, come.
Anjou is a man who understands.
Bread is called shleb.
Shleb.
Good.
Butter is maslo.
Maslo.
The word for herring is sledz.
So herring is what stank when you came in?
In Poland, my lord, even at the King's table, they serve sledz, herring.
Sledz.
Prince! Can you pronounce that?
Sledz.
I have little talent for languages.
Place your tongue here.
Sledz.
That's better, isn't it?
Perfect! They pronounce no better on the banks of the Vistula.
You took your time.
I always miss my friends.
Enough Polish for today.
My brother and mother wish me to wear the Polish crown.
The King of Poland lags behind all the other kings of Europe.
How dreadful to ingest daily three helpings of Polish in the hope of eating herring on a kinglet's throne.
And they were still plotting my marriage to Elizabeth,
English, Protestant, bald and 20 years my senior.
I believe our birthright comes at too high a price.
Well, cousin?
The Huguenots request a truce.
Your valour has brought them to their knees.
You have your share in this victory.
A great share.
Not congratulating our cousin Guise?
I do each time we meet.
We are victors, you are praised, and yet you seem defeated.
Yes, I have wept, my lord.
My best captain lies dying.
I can do nothing to help.
I'm going back.
I just came to bring the good news.
He weeps and admits it.
I didn't think him capable of such emotion.
Why, Prince, you did not come alone.
This is my master and friend.
I spoke to you of him.
Introduce yourself.
François, Count of Chabannes.
Chabannes!
Who suddenly comes over to our side from our enemy?
How is one to believe the sincerity of an act that coincides with your defeat?
Well, as it happens, I believe you.
Come, Prince.
A conqueror invites you to dinner.
Peace is ours as suddenly as the war resumed.
You'll go home without drawing your sword.
Come, I've just received an excellent wine from Ay.
Madame, my absence has not tarnished your beauty.
Your return restores my radiance.
So the war is over?
It appears so.
Leave us.
- My lord...
- It's not our wedding night.
The labours of war parted us too soon after our wedding.
We know nothing of one another.
It will take time not to be the strangers we are tonight.
I heard you playing.
- Am I disturbing you?
- Never, Philippe.
I was going to read.
I left my wife to rest.
And I'm not sleepy.
Drink.
After the chaos of the camps, this calm unsettles me.
What do you think of my wife?
Very lovely, very...
I mean as a pupil.
Intelligent, gifted, eager to learn.
I know nothing about her.
I know the least about her tastes and moods.
Lovely penmanship!
Even I can read you.
It's not my writing.
"If Life is less than one day's passing
"In Eternity, if the year revolved..."
It's poetry.
Her handwriting.
I give her new poems to copy and learn to recite them at Court.
- Her?
- Marie.
You call her Marie?
Rarely. And only in her absence.
Even in her absence, call her Princess.
Did you teach her to write?
- She knew a little.
- Why?
- She asked.
- To reply? She receives letters?
You must tell me.
No letters.
Truly.
I wish she'd write to me.
The Guises are back at Court.
Henri is a great soldier.
He fights well.
We charged side by side.
He was wounded in the face again, erasing the other scar.
Now he deserves the name
"The Scarred."
Like his father.
As if they were born with the mark.
My lord?
Father requests me in Paris.
The grieving weighs on him.
I know he thinks of remarrying.
He'll present you at Court.
Don't be impatient.
Let me enjoy the peace, and your company.
I found it! Follow me, there'll be a ford, or a bridge.
The same as before?
Guise, you're as lost as we are!
Don't listen, cousin.
I'll follow you. So will they.
What a delightful coincidence!
Your detour is forgiven, Henri.
You know that one, Guise.
I believe so.
Who would she be?
Marie de Montpensier.
Philippe's wife?
He spoke of her great beauty.
I want a better look.
La Valette, announce us!
Madame, the Duke of Anjou wishes to cross with some of his men.
The King's brother is welcome on Montpensier land.
The skiff, you dolt!
Ask for the skiff.
We don't know how deep the water is.
Can you help by bringing the skiff over?
It's your beauty that staggers me, and, I admit, the unsteadiness one often feels on water.
If you ride on to the castle, you shall be my guests.
And the Duke will be glad of refreshment.
The hunt is a necessity due to the overabundance of game.
Some say it's a welcome change from killing men.
They can instead sacrifice deer.
To me it is an unappealing spectacle.
You are unkind to our cousin who excels at both carnages.
Never mind,
Montpensier has deprived the Court of its loveliest ornament.
Reproach him on my behalf.
You can reproach him yourself.
I can hear that his butchery is over.
I like your home.
My lord, for as long as it pleases, make it yours as well.
I'm just back from the hunt...
Each battle produces its conversions.
Our defeats create new Huguenots, and vice versa, with the apostates...
Who return to heresy with Coligny's first victory.
I see nothing amusing in these reversals.
And you, Monsieur...
What of your experience with the heretics?
My friend Chabannes...
Let him speak, cousin.
The heretics, as you call them, show as much grandeur and cruelty as the Catholics.
I admit I have no complacency for these battles.
All I see is blood and horror.
I only hear cries of pain.
So I withdrew.
You are a man of feeling.
Our Guise is a man of impulse.
I always have been, without forsaking my feelings.
I do not reason, I feel, and obey the impulse of my faith and my heart, which has never betrayed me.
What do you think, Madame?
I am too unsure to venture an opinion, and what credence could you give a woman ignorant of military matters?
Ignorant, really?
It's a subject of learning that Count de Chabannes spared me.
Fortunate man.
I would gladly convert you to my passions:
Music, literature...
These soldiers know nothing of beauty.
I won't wait for you to dismiss us.
Company, on your feet!
You'll be shown to your quarters.
I had my parents' room made up.
And you?
I shall sleep with my wife.
I would gladly trade places.
That pâté was divine.
The parsnip casserole heavenly.
I found Marie de Montpensier very beautiful.
To the Prince!
The Prince must enjoy himself.
Put a log on.
Joyeuse...
I'm exhausted.
I told you to leave us!
You were weary of the hunt, but I trust you easily withstood the buzz of admiration around you.
I spent two long years in abstinence of worldly pleasures.
An evening of company...
And the skiff on the water... like a stage for you to perform on.
You're unfair.
- Only by chance...
- Not only chance!
Chance and Guise!
They all joked about his claim to lead them to Espalion when he took them on a 20-league detour.
He knew what he was doing.
He led them to you.
Did he?
And to the skiff I didn't expect to board two hours before?
I don't know.
In any event, I found you together.
Together!
He didn't take his eyes off you, caressing you with his gaze.
Yes! And you smiled!
Must I remind you your husband was at that table?
I have longed for a smile from you.
Foolish hope!
I wish she'd smiled at me.
The whole castle could hear you.
Let me be.
Cousin, a word with you.
I am in need of a confident.
Yes?
Come.
He came to my door.
I didn't show my face.
I feared more unfair reproaches like last night, this unwarranted jealousy.
Did you share what I confided in you?
Now you're being unfair.
With me.
With him.
The Prince departed by order of the Duke of Anjou
- who conducts his own affairs.
- What affairs?
I'm not privy to them.
The kingdom, war, peace, the Queen, without whom he decides nothing of import.
I'm anxious for them to leave.
I was glad to host them.
Now I want them gone.
Quickly.
Were you dreaming, cousin?
Or was I, too, in a reverie suggesting our melancholy moods were twins?
She's worthy of our common interest.
The Princess of Montpensier.
You know her.
And you both showed much apparent indifference.
Hence dissimulation.
That which is concealed always arouses my curiosity.
We knew each other as children.
We were fairly close.
She, Mayenne, my sister, myself, other cousins.
But I scarcely remember her now.
I saw your emotion when we found her like an enchantment, on the skiff.
Enchantment, indeed.
That emotion was surprise.
At meeting again, of course.
And... was she prettier than you remembered?
As could be expected.
But I insist, the memory is one of childhood and friendship.
You've learned to lie, cousin.
I sent Montpensier to inform my mother I'd resume peace talks.
Not a truce, peace!
Peace, with the Huguenots?
So Montpensier is with your mother.
Husbands always get in the way.
Yes, two of us are enough.
If you've distorted your feelings and hers, the fight will be face to face, and merciless!
I won't be caught up short.
Mourning ends in 40 days, that's nothing.
I know how it is.
I have myself lost...
Spare me your own affairs when I explain mine to you.
I was saying: 40 days is nothing.
Any news of my son?
He's to bring me...
What does it matter to you?
But he's not bringing my daughter-in-law, as if he were hiding her!
Write my son to send for her within a month at the latest.
So then, 40 days, by which time,
I trust, we shall have peace.
Peace means life, festivities, balls once again, a sort of spring.
For me a rebirth!
I want three costumes befitting my rank, not to mention hunting outfits.
No black or brown or grey.
Except perhaps pearl grey.
Pink and mauve.
The vibrancy of scarlet and crimson can wait.
My late wife adored crimson, remember?
It suits me so well.
I will spare no expense.
Plenty of embroidery, beads, gems.
I want to look my best.
I'm thinking of taking a new wife.
Solitude is fine, but at certain hours it's dismal.
And enough sadness, let us at least look fine!
A letter for you, from your husband.
He requests my presence.
If he requests it...
You know what it means.
A request is an order.
Aren't you pleased?
Paris means the Court, Madame.
The King, Queen Catherine, Anjou...
And Guise.
Do you so mistrust your heart that?
My heart has grown cold to him.
You know it. I know it.
But my husband?
I reasoned with his jealousy once, after many words and tears, but how will it be living in that Louvre, with all those intrigues?
My parents told me so, and so did you.
You are strong enough to avoid any obstacle to your aims.
If the Court pleases you, you will please Court.
Which will please your husband.
Only you know what remains of your past hopes.
Nothing.
Well then, to Paris, Madame!
The Prince has surely prepared a fine welcome.
I was going to write him.
Shall I announce your arrival?
Within the month?
Within a week, Chabannes!
If such a thing is possible, we'll be there within a week!
You are radiant, Madame.
Well, Philippe, what about peace?
We are very hopeful.
- Catherine!
- Marie!
I understand your surprise to see me, cousin.
Special orders. An 80 league-ride.
I just took off my boots.
On whose orders?
My uncles. The Cardinal's.
He delegated me to represent us to Catherine in this happy occasion that is to join our houses.
Join our houses?
You don't know?
We're back in the situation at Mézières:
A marriage between you and us.
What marriage?
My younger sister and your father.
What shall we be for one another?
Sister-in-law? Stepson?
Nephew? Niece?
What else?
Father is to wed Catherine de Guise.
Marie didn't tell me.
Did she mention this union?
Your father must have made arrangements in secret.
Finally, my son,
I can announce publicly what
I had no time to tell you privately.
He's always off somewhere!
I'm marrying again.
And the lucky bride...
Catherine? Where are you?
No need, Father,
I've had the surprise.
It delights you, I trust.
My dear fellow, how are your carps?
You know very well...
They decide without us.
Like for the horses and the hounds.
You didn't wed the man you wanted, and mine is more than twice my age.
Catherine, our duty is to obey.
You laugh?
It's because you'll have to call me Mother!
I see nasty Huguenot faces.
Like three ugly flies on a tablecloth.
Montpensier is following my mother's orders: Work for peace.
He'd be wiser to keep Chabannes out of his wench's skirts.
Beware, Joyeuse!
Slur who you wish with your perfidies, but not an unkind word about her.
Never.
I say, this is an epidemic.
These weddings!
Recently my brother the King.
Soon the Admiral, they say.
And my sister Marguerite, as a sacrifice to the lord of Navarre, that garlic-eater!
And now your father-in-law the Duke to whom the Guises sold your Catherine.
I say, this is an epidemic!
I'd have gladly succumbed had you not already been conquered.
You're mistaken, Marie.
I sincerely envy your husband and that other one.
- Excuse me?
- My mother, at my request, will see you tomorrow.
So soon?
- I would prefer...
- Have no fear.
She's not an ogre. Only an ogress whom I've fed with praises of you.
She's already fond of you.
Must I wait still?
I just learned of your presence.
I have little time and much to say.
I haven't changed.
I've had no chance to see you in private.
All eyes are on us, all ears are listening.
Here I can confess, and I do...
Holding audience, cousin?
I thought it was the Queen.
I've been waiting for an hour.
I've just come out.
Queen Catherine spoke warmly of you to her sons.
She awaits you.
Is your presence?
Don't worry about Marie.
I'll keep her company in your absence.
Your insolence, your smiles, your smirks,
I'll have no more of.
Come, we'll settle this in the courtyard.
Who allows you to risk your lives so stupidly?
A rankling grudge.
Forget it!
I, too, for the same reason harbour a grudge against Guise.
But I am able to muzzle it.
Were I King of France,
I would perhaps disobey myself...
If you cross swords again,
I'll have both your heads taken off.
The Polish business may soon be settled.
I'll have my brother appoint you to lead the army in my stead.
And you, I shall spare a humiliating obedience.
Poitiers.
You'll be in command to defend the fortress...
I almost said, in a new guise.
Come now.
Come, Madame, the Queen grants you an audience.
The ambassador of England
I shall see tomorrow after mass.
Approach.
I know much already, but I wanted to see you up close.
Eye to eye.
Settle that affair without me.
I just want results.
She wonders what I know. And how?
If I know the birth date,
I know the rest.
The stars are close to God and send us His messages.
But reading them correctly is an exacting science and only now at my age do I make fewer mistakes.
You are under the pull of two conflicting forces.
Saturn and Venus!
Rectitude, reason, the law on one side, desire, sensuality, the body on the other.
Which will prevail?
One cannot shun one's destiny.
His syrup! Don't wait for a fit.
Another son, the King, Charles.
He is King. He is lying ill behind the screen.
He disobeys.
I'm very fond of your husband.
Anjou tells me Guise is pestering you.
Don't listen to Guise.
He is courting my daughter.
Do you know Margot? A beauty.
Even too much so.
Everyone wants her, but she wants Guise.
I want someone else for her.
She is a Leo. So is Guise.
Very bad.
Dangerous.
How dare you?
After what just happened?
- It kept me from saying my peace.
- Spare me!
Do you still believe in the weakness of my 16 years?
Dare you invoke that weakness today, to a married woman?
The whole Court says you love another.
- The King's sister did show...
- No, you!
You showed interest in the King's sister.
The mere vanity of becoming the King's in-law.
God is my witness.
I did nothing to seduce Margot.
She pursued me.
You would flee a woman lauded for her wit and beauty?
Enough! It's her, I say.
She tried to tempt me... with marriage.
Queen Catherine had indigestion from purple artichokes.
Her wind even drove Coligny away!
An offer of marriage, you say?
It certainly is a fashion!
And you replied?
Neither way.
You decide, Mariette.
Well?
The door was open, and the noise...
I came to inquire.
And I see by your face... that you've had good news.
Rather good, yes.
What business is it of yours?
- My friendship for you.
- You should have been a priest.
You know, Madame, that some temptations are beyond my moral strength.
Speaking of temptation,
Madame Benedicte complains her honey's been stolen.
I vouched for your integrity.
Priest would suit you.
Confessor.
So I'll confess something to you.
It will commit you to secrecy.
Since I confess it.
Mr. De Guise burns for me again...
- You're not to blame...
- And I'm delighted.
It's your good fortune
I'm the first to note your satisfaction.
Which condemns you.
Imagine meeting the Prince in your present state.
It's only a fleeting happiness.
Like the swallow, it quickly comes and goes.
There remains the shame of being taken in so easily.
He even used the nickname of our youth:
Mariette.
Have no fear.
I will yield neither to Guise nor anyone else.
Madame, the Prince your husband has known more passion than what marriage usually produces.
When passion doesn't blind, it opens the eyes and the mind.
If he sees you as I have now, he will understand.
And you will lose both him and Monsieur de Guise.
What must I do?
Free yourself.
Forget today's encounter.
Forget Monsieur de Guise.
Yes.
I want to.
I sincerely want to.
If you want to, you can.
No.
The King's Ball tomorrow!
I'll be there and so will he.
Take your time.
The Moorish Ballet is later.
And there, who's dancing?
Little girls. Nymphs...
Nymphs? They don't exist.
Everything that has a name exists.
Your beast doesn't seem to like music.
Always grumbling!
Likes nothing, always grumbling.
Yes! I saw him, believe me!
The King smiled at you, just before your curtsey.
A broad smile, even.
I know what he was looking at.
I know who.
As soon as he saw you, he stopped coughing.
Marquis! What a pleasure.
Your husband.
You learned of my mother's passing?
I'm sorry.
Tragic. After such suffering, death is redemption.
Help me, Catherine.
Detain him.
I must warn your brother.
- What do I say?
- Anything, as if it were you.
So, my dear stepson... have we honoured our husbands enough, father and son?
I found you both ravishing, charming...
Their Majesties commend you.
Marie most of all.
See her complexion?
Her white teeth?
I need oak tannin, cuttlefish powder, cinnamon, the old tricks...
With Marie it's natural.
I missed a few steps, she caught me.
My husband suspects us.
Don't speak in public.
Meet me where we were yesterday.
After your dance.
Would you also take this woman from me even as you dare look at my sister?
Enough is enough, Guise.
One day you'll pay for these two outrages with your life.
They met, they exchanged glances.
How could she avoid him here?
She avoided me.
You're mistaken, Philippe.
Not at all.
But you can't share the feelings of a husband and jealous lover.
Such things are foreign to you.
I don't like suffering.
Find Marie de Montpensier quickly.
The one you're waiting for won't come.
And Mr. D'Anjou wishes to speak to you.
It's in your interest and not mine that I must warn you of Guise's duplicity.
Cover yourself.
Don't interrupt me, but realise he's sacrificing you to my sister though he doubtless claims the contrary.
He is seductive and ambitious, deceiving all those he attracts.
He's with her now.
It was I who deserved you.
I was truly sincere.
Here's your rightful husband.
Watch over her, cousin.
She was about to stray.
You've humiliated me!
I don't know how much, but you have!
Before the Court! Before Anjou!
Before my King!
Your rascal Guise!
Leave me.
Prepare to return to Mont-sur-Brac until my anger cools.
Go to the halberdiers.
Ask them to guard the gates tonight.
Then tell Quercy to let the dogs loose.
Be quick.
Cry out and you're dead.
I'm too curious to cry out.
I'm listening.
I burn with a passion for someone close to you.
I understand.
They tell her lies to snare me.
- I must speak to her.
- Write to her.
No! I must see and speak to her.
Her husband, her servants and myself will stop you.
Then you will bring misfortune on both of us.
What I want, she wants. I know it.
What I feel, she feels.
- If I die, she'll die.
- Silence!
I'll announce you.
But don't rejoice.
Promise that if she won't see you, you'll accept defeat.
- She's waiting.
- Your word?
You have it.
If the Princess will see you, she will light her window.
I'll open the door near the well.
Are you mad?
I'm afraid so.
I've just seen Mr. De Guise.
He demands to speak to you.
What insolence!
To justify himself.
Does he not know who I am?
Where I am? The risk we'd take?
He knows all that, Madame.
He awaits your answer.
Does he love me?
Yes, Madame.
- And do I?
- Alas, yes.
You urge me to hear him out?
When would he...
And how?
If that is the only obstacle, place a candle in your window, and I'll see to the rest.
Hurry.
You cruelly turned your back on me.
I saw you were engaged.
I can imagine what you'll say.
But you were with Marguerite while I waited frightened and cold at the assigned place.
Keep your voices down!
You waited for me?
- Assigned by whom?
- Me, earlier!
After the ballet. I told you where.
We never spoke.
How dare you?
I swear to you, it wasn't me.
I only see a dog lying out there.
Go look.
Anjou tricked you.
You spoke to him, not to me.
I'd have run to you, Marie.
I told the Queen
I gave up Marguerite.
It's you I love, Marie, more than ever.
There's noise in the Prince's quarters. Run, Duke!
Run!
Too late!
Hide in here.
Flee.
Open up. I heard voices.
I know you're not alone. Open up.
You?
If you have any honour left, fight.
Draw your sword!
My Prince, I know all your skills.
I taught them to you.
I'd have spared you at war.
I won't kill you now.
Then be gone!
And never show your face.
I won't spare you twice.
Get out!
I ordered our best coach.
It will be for Madame Benedicte, happy to travel alone.
You decided...
To inaugurate the freedom you impose.
Alone.
You won't make it to Mont-sur-Brac.
Beyond Chevreuse, who will recognise me?
I will ride at my own pace...
My lord.
I want a letter... every week.
It will probably be the same one, every week.
Sorry, sir. The house is full.
Don't you recognise me?
I stayed here while serving Mr. De Condé.
Monsieur de Condé?
Could be, but still, there's no room.
I don't need much.
I can pay, for a while.
In coin or in labour.
You say he's a scholar?
He's not disturbing anyone.
He spends all his time writing.
And he says he'll be off soon.
Princess,
dearest Marie,
child,
If I take the liberty of writing today,
as I took the liberty of loving you, it is because,
having decided to return to Maucombe to bury myself in silence,
I feel the duty to serve you one last time.
I fear for you, Madame.
Having had the joy to observe you for so many hours,
who knows you better than I?
Who better than I knows your harsh innocence?
Never given, always in secret,
waiting for others to draw a cry from you
and furious at them if they do.
You pursue the journey of life alone,
like a pilgrim in the shadows.
Don't follow the wrong star.
I know yours.
One hand above the constellation Delphinus
which we studied together...
I gave it your name.
And I am certain it is indeed yours,
for I need only speak of what breaks my heart,
and then it goes out.
If it so happens, as I fear, that...
Papist or Huguenot?
- Say the word.
- What word?
The word that tells us your camp.
Let me by!
I'm neither with you nor against you!
Let him go.
Leave that woman alone!
Leave her alone!
Flee!
Your horse!
Royal business has kept me away.
The resumption of the war,
Anjou's departure for the Polish throne.
Good day, Marie.
Good day, my lord.
I was a few leagues away and...
You were right.
Your horse seems exhausted.
As do you.
You're very pale.
I'm well.
Thinner.
I have a letter for you.
Monsieur de Chabannes wrote it.
- You opened it?
- Yes.
You read it?
Read, reread, memorised.
"Princess, dearest Marie, child,
"If I take the liberty of writing today, as I took..."
You'll read it.
He's dead.
The Count of Chabannes.
He is?
I found it on his body.
During the heretic slaughter in Paris.
You just read the part about your star?
The wise Mr. De Chabannes was prey to the same ill you inflict on so many men.
Allow me to finish reading later.
Alone.
As you wish.
What follows is useful.
The Count speaks of me, of you, of Guise.
That takes nerve.
I no longer fear The Scarred.
He's to wed Madame de Clèves.
Didn't you know?
Very beautiful. And very rich.
They're at Blois for the contract.
I'll go tomorrow.
His mind is made up.
We'll see.
"If it so happens, as I fear,
"that you are again seized by a passion for Mr. De Guise,
"bear in mind that nothing ensures his passion will endure."
"People of his nature have brilliance, charm, audacity.
"But neither depth nor constancy."
I could have destroyed that letter.
I wore out two horses in my haste to deliver it.
What better proof of my loyalty?
My forgiveness?
I could have also concealed
Guise's treachery.
Madame... understand that if you offend me by going to Blois,
I won't retain you.
But all will be over between us.
Forever, Marie. No turning back.
Forever.
Fine, gentlemen.
Your husband said you were ill and shut away.
He was apparently exaggerating.
Your long silence pained me.
I grant that your duties in society excuse the lack of news.
Well?
What you wished so strongly,
I'm prepared to do.
I have decided to break my marriage bond.
What fervour!
Don't you know time passes and in passing abolishes...
It has abolished nothing in me.
I tried to obliterate you.
I thought I had.
Dear Marie, you know...
I know you never ceased to appear before me.
In hopes of what? Why?
You were like a doe in our midst...
Our?
Yes, Montpensier, Anjou, me.
The rivalry drove me to seek...
What you obtained!
Did I not sacrifice the King's sister?
Marguerite had agreed, it was done!
For love of you I said no.
Is that not a sacrifice?
Do you know what it meant for me?
My fortune.
I paid you with a night
I don't regret.
Do you think what I abandon now has no price?
It's all settled, Mariette.
Nothing can be done. I'm committed.
This union saves me.
Or else Anjou...
Then all is said.
Don't lower yourself any more.
Mr. De Chabannes' prophecy was true.
- Chabannes?
- He wrote,
"Bear in mind that nothing ensures his passion will endure.
"If a more favourable opportunity should arise..."
- as appears to be the case -
"his head will turn elsewhere."
Farewell, cousin.
Don't keep her waiting.
You brought me the wonderment of youth,
yours and my own,
which belatedly resurfaced.
Wherever I am, you shall accompany me.
Farewell, Marie, dear child.
Happiness is an unlikely prospect in the harsh adventure of life
for a soul as proud as yours.
Allow me to reappear now and then in your memory
like an old song we never truly erase from our mind.
Having lost your husband's esteem and your lover's heart,
you will always have the perfect friendship of François,
Count of Chabannes.
As François de Chabannes withdrew from war,
I withdrew from love.
Life would be no more than a succession of days.
I wished it to be brief,
for the secret follies of passion had become alien to me.
Legend of Chen Zhen
Europe. France 1917
The frontline is dangerous, we need 10 more people now...
No more ammo!
Move it, quick.
Tiansheng, dont be scared.
Calm down, calm down.
We will make it back to China...we can't die here.
Everyone don't be scared, continue forward
Do not go back, march forward.
My lucky charm.
It will protect you.
Brothers, let's move forward.
Lets go!
Lets go!
Quickly!
Commander, ammo is here.
Why are the French retreating?
Chen Zhen...
Help me.
Chen Zhen!
Germans are here, damn it.
Everyone alright? anyone hurt?
Chen Zhen, lucky to have you here.
Brother Chen, I'm okay.
Thanks to your lucky charm.
Thank heaven, thank god.
I must go home.
Tiansheng...
I must go home.
I'll kill all of you!
I must go home.
Everyone get down.
We cannot die here.
Mr. Liu!
Thank you.
- Owner Liu, business is good huh?.
- You guys please enjoy.
Boss, look, every night it's like this.
Who would believe there's a war going on.
It's crazy out there, they dont come here, then where else?
Everyone, my brother says he has war news from the front.
He says, General Zhou will defeat Commander Zeng.
There's news that Commander Zeng retreated.
If General Zhou wins, China will be unified.
Not for sure yet.
The British, Japanese are still behind Commander Zeng
Both do not wish China to be unified.
Are you kidding?
You've been to Taiwan?
Japan invaded Taiwan.
You fight back, and get terminated.
You still want to fight back?
History books won't even record your name.
If this continues, Taiwan will become Japan
Also, China is not under Chinese control
Eventually, I think either the Brits or Japanese will win.
Don't forget
More chaos here, more prosperity for us.
Tell her to sing this song.
Kiki, sing us a Japanese song.
Kiki.
Come on, lets go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Very good, very nice.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Who do you want?
Officers, dont be angry.
Everyone's my guest today, please save this Lu some face
Sit, sit
- Ah Wan
- Yes
I am sorry. Please sit down.
I can't take this, Mr. Liu
Brother, you returned from France?
Correct.
Have a drink.
Thank you Mr. Liu.
Let me ask something...pair is big or three of a kind?
What are you holding?
Three of a kind.
My pair beats your three of a kind.
Come on.
Okay, continue.
Winner winner, chicken dinner
I won
Again
Tiansheng, taking big risk?
Risking my life is okay?
Your Life? How much is it worth?
Not cheaper than yours!
What did you say?
Your life, is it worth this much?
Then my life is yours now.
Who is scared of who?
Three of a kind.
It's over for you.
Two Pair.
Pair can beat three of a kind?
Didn't someone say that moments ago?
You...
Correct?
Sit down...
Okay.
Rules are made by you guys.
Can't take it when someone wins?
Okay.
My brother.
You gave me your money, or your life?
Of course, I need money not life, Mr. Liu.
Okay then.
Drink.
Come on, continue
Drink too much these couple days.
Cant drink anymore, I have to go back to the hotel
Don't stay in the hotel anymore move in here
Don't be a stranger
Don't mention it
Okay, Thank you Mr. Lu.
You're here?
Didn't you say this room's for me to watch the sunrise?
It's only 3... no sunrise yet
Let me introduce my brother, Qin Tiansheng.
This is Kiki.
Then now you got more brothers than wives
What am I to do?
You are married to me, you should know what to do
What about other mistresses?
They're one night stands, you're my main chick
When they are all gone, we can continue this talk
Have a drink!
- Next time perhaps
I drank a lot tonight, thanks Miss
He drank a lot, let me.
Then I won't bother you two
I'll go first
Ah Wan's downstairs, he'll see you out.
Thank you.
Your girlfriend's cold.
You interested?
If you have it, take it. I'm afraid you can't control yourself
That's you, Mr. Liu.
Really?
Good night
Thank you Mr. Liu.
You are welcome.
You hang out with Liu Yiutian now?
If so, you'll be famous
This keeps up, then it will be too dangerous
This is small part of the plan
No, getting close to Liu Yiutian is a big part already
He can't trust you that quickly
Be careful
Liu Yiutian, this person... you think he can do big things?
Also... he has ties to the underground
After all, he is still Chinese
Our force is not strong enough...
...to face the Japanese
We must encourage every single Chinese
The more power Liu Yiutian has, the more valuable
Thus, if we and the underground... established ties...
It will be beneficial to us.
I contacted some sailor brothers from France for help
Don't worry
Don't forget our school mates
Every Chinese is together on this
But our country cannot be unified
At least, for now..
I believe we can do it. We can.
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?
To protect the homeland, Chen Zhen.
France. 1917.
Tian Yuan, we almost made it to China.
You stay here and rest.
Tian Yuan will go back to China with us.
Chen Zhen can't go home now.
But Qin Tiansheng can.
China's Battlefield.
I got news from France.
England intercepted news about our troop movement
Besides me, only 3 of you know.
Who made the mistake?
Sir, I never left base.
You all listen...
Japanese soldier, must have courage
Yes.
Sisters, boss is here
Now, bottoms up!
Whose birthday is it?
Whose birthday is not important.
It's important that you invite us for a drink
Okay, let's drink
Ah Chi.
Your boss has ways with the ladies.
He is very wealthy in Shanghai.
Wearing white is Wei Wei.
You, come here!
I have to go now...
General Zeng's lover...keep eyes on her.
He's here!
Not at the battlefield?
He's back, at Duy Quinh Place
Told me to come over
Shall I call a car for you?
No need. He sent a driver
He will pick me up
Drink one, then go
Give her one shot
Hong Lan
Any left?
Sorry sister Kiki, I just sold out.
I'll go buy one for you, okay?
Okay
Mr. Qin, see you.
Lady Duy, General is waiting upstairs.
Okay
Sir, we have located General Zhou and General Zeng of the NE army
My people are ready, waiting for your orders
General Zhou, hello!
Arrived? Hello!
Long time, sit sit
It's cold outside, lets eat hot pot
We just talking nonsense to relax
General Zeng
Tell me, your troops against mine... who will win?
You'd win
What if the Japanese help you
If so, I would surrender
I only use the Japanese
They are a bunch of bastards
The Japanese won't give you the time.
Things are critical now
Some already moved to Europe.
Honestly, I don't want to fight the NE army.
But, your army can't be helping the China government.
To be direct
If you withdraw, the army is still yours
I'll stop fighting immediately
What do you think?
Brother Zhou, don't force me.
This reply, is what you want to say to all of China?
General Zhou
General Zeng, forgive me for not seeing things
He trusts you...admires you
Won't you believe in him?
Let me tell you
If he doesn't want to be Japan's dog...
Then he has only got one option
Negotiation
Brother, it's not easy, to get to where China is today
Victory is in sight
Brother Zhou, I need time to tell everyone
Give me 7 days
Okay
7 days is okay
If...
If they don't listen...
Next time we meet, it will be on the battlefield!
We two, will always be brothers
Bottoms up!
Give me some money
Easy, give me some money
Get lost!
Your majesty!
Thank you
Protect the General!
Protect the General!
One more skilled fighter
Who is driving that fast? Even the police don't drive THAT fast
Do I know who?
Let's go see
Who? Me?
Is it me every time? Hurry and go!
You go!
Me?
Come here, come here
Make way!
Useless fellow...
Search the crime scene, see who's alive
Go look over there, okay
Go and get killed
Who are you?
You need not know
You. Why did you save me?
I didn't want to save you. I had no choice!
I want to say one thing to you.
"Don't work with the Japanese!"
Don't dig your own grave!
Did General Zhou send him?
No, he isn't that type of person
Then who else knows you're back?
Your Majesty, my men practise day and night
Why want to assassinate his son?
I'm not interested in helping you handle this Zhou, he's not worth much
He only commands the NE army
Only the NE army, what can they do?
What is important, is what Tokyo wants
Only to see China surrender...
To us, that's beneficial
When General Zeng dies
War between General Zeng and Zhou can't be avoided
Just that we messed up
Can't believe a pro fighter appeared
We don't need to dwell on this
Right now what's important is...find out who he is!
Hurry and investigate
A person appeared to fight the mighty Japan!
Let us unite!
Many characters is good for us
We will help with all we got
Read all about it!
Read all about it!
Mysterious man appears to fight back Japan!
How Tai, don't wear black clothes all day
Wanna scare people to death?
Talking about me?
Then who else?
Can you guys guess who this mysterious guy?
I know who he is!
You sound confident, are you?
He didn't escape from the psychiatric ward
This person is here among us
Why are you so sure?
All of Shanghai knows.
I know everything going on in that ward!
You better be careful, maybe you are tired.
Head of a psy ward, scared of someone with a brain?
Maybe...
What happened last night?
You stupid chink!
Where were you yesterday?
You cant believe the news, that's no truth in the paper
Do you know what happened? Who is the mysterious guy?
General
That is weird. We received the same news.
We came to the scene right away
We got there, bodies everywhere
There's 17,18...
Bodies everywhere...
Over there 10...
Who knows, guns started firing
You were holding me!
When we were behind the car, We fired back!
Then we split up...
I'm on the right, he's on the left
I kept firing till I'm out...
Then what?
Out of bullets, at a moment like this...
I jumped from the hood of the car...
Then I jumped to the other side!
I thought I was dead meat...
But I got over in one jump
You think I'm a pig?
Listen to me!
Working too openly is not wise
I think if I pulled the hat down...
Nobody would notice me!
I'm a bad-ass, isn't that right?
You think you are that mysterious guy?
Look at yourself!
You look like a pig!
You stupid chink! not Chink, it's Chinese.
Whatever, you stupid Chink!
Here's the money...
This is good...
I can go eat with the superiors
Yes, brother, we're here...
Every month it's gonna be like that
Stop staring, you want one too?
Luckily, you're not here yesterday
If not, dressing like this is scary as heck
Don't joke, I have a gun...
GUN
Then why didn't you appear earlier yesterday?
Am I not looking for the right opportunity?
- What did you find out?
- I investigated it all
None of the dead guys had any records
Let me ask you, who's at that bottom of this
I don't know
How are you gonna find a suspect from the dead bodies?
General Zeng returned to Japan
And Wei Wei?
But yesterday, General Zeng was courageous
Preparation is being done at the restaurant
Money?
Next time be careful. Don't drag me in again
Any one suspicious lately?
One new shareholder appeared ery suspicious individual
Continue
His name is  Qin Tiansheng
Just back from France
Mr. Lu
Even invited him to be a shareholder of the night club
And you?
My mission is to stay close and retrieve intel from the British
But more people come in and out everyday
I'll pay more attention to this Tian Yuan
Sorry
Next time, don't come back with no intel
You better watch yourself
I'm sorry
Wei Wei
I thought I would never see everyone again
This is for you
It's perfume and cosmetics
Only sold in Shanghai
I have this
Thank you
Thank you everyone
Oh yeah
You told me to bring it
These bracelets...I keep 1, you keep 1
This is from your mom
You are my best friend
Alright, hurry, go go
Get me a box of cigarettes
Yes
Very nice to meet you
Sir enjoy your stay, ok
You dare mess at Mr. Lu place?
It wasn't me
Kiki, your cigarette
Excuse me
Bottoms up
We are ready
Mr. Lu, who's the guy with glasses
Him?
Businessman from England
High influence, up there with the English government
Quick with info too
Faster than you?
If it's about France, yes
I'm here
Don't go, come here.
Drink a little
Just got here, but stirring things up already...
I want a half day off
Off for what?
Me and him
Go out
You don't care right?
I dont mind
Let's go!
Kiki, where I want to go, you need not go
Cause you dare not take me?
This is the General, let's fight
Let's watch

Your wife?
Girlfriend!
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?
Of course!
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?
Of course!
Very good!
Let me ask...
What powers have you got.. to control big brother!
I dance at Casablanca night club ..
That's a hot job in Shanghai right now
You're the best!
Stop playing
Let's drink!
Big Brother, I wanna ask something
We're happy that you're here today
Let me make the first toast
Let us remember our fallen brothers as well
Let's drink to our good brother...
Chen Zhen
Alright, let's not talk about the past
Come on
Let's drink!
Zhi Shan?
Thank you
Kiki, hello
My sister.
- Your sister?
Why is it that you two don't look alike?
Of course we dont!
Cause I'm better looking!
Oh, you said Chen Zhen
The Chen Zhen that defeated Hong Khau ?
Yes
Wasn't he killed by the Japanese ?
He is still alive
There are a lot of rumors that year
But he definitely didn't get killed by the Japanese
He went through life and death with us...
...for 3 long years.
Chen Zhen is my good brother.
He is a good brother of ours, ain't that right?
Yes
It's the truth!
Though my eyes are small, I see very well
Chen Zhen is a bad ass
Really?
Yes, even Tu Dian is not as fast as him
Bottoms up...
Bottoms up!
Let's drink!
Lady Kiki
For you
Thank you!
I won't bother you two
Look like me?
It's good here...
Everyone's kind-hearted
No one is trying to deceive you... or put on a front.
Living like this is nice
Yes
Stick, tiger, egg...
Tiger!
You lost
I let you win!
We've reached your home
Thank you
Thank you
Who are you?
I count to 3, I'll shoot if you don't tell me
One
Two
Three
You drank a lot
Too much
I'm going in
You carry a gun everyday?
Shanghai is a complicated place
Mr. Lu let us have them for protection
Handsome, let me have your signature
Signing is not needed, but you can keep it
Then it's my reward for the day
Thank you!
Who are you... really?
Your real name...
Feng Ching
Lady Feng Ching
The Japanese map must be completed quickly
Must deliver in 2 days
What the situation regarding the artifacts?
Here is the map of China's artifacts
Lots of valuable things
Okay, take as much as you can
Destroy anything you can't
Valuable sources like this...
...in the hands of China, is such a waste!
This country should be under Japan's control
Colonel, classified news from Japan
Killed this many?
To kill this many in 1 month even using all of our manpower it is not possible.
To achieve Japan's dream, We must do justice.
We just need extra effort
This list... contains those who publicly oppose Japan
Cannot let it leak out
If not, Japan's killings would only increase
So England and U.S would do nothing?
When is Japan moving their troops here?
Any word from England and U.S?
No
When Japan set their troops here
They only want to benefit from  it
Don't forget, this country is victorious in war
But England, U.S, France
Let Japan have Taiwan island
Without any talk or consideration
Only seeing to their own benefits
Headlines!
Japan's assignations

List of Japanese assasinations
Killed for opposing...
Jack Taylor...
John Hanneke...
Robert Wendon...
Do Wen Chiu... He Chang... Ji Yong...
This has already happened
I want to know, what you guys are doing about it
Sit
We had a meeting this morning
We were expecting something like this
Following it very closely
Not a big deal
Don't just say it
I already know what you're gonna do
Talk to a superior?
Talking to your superior is useless
I'm trying to run a business, then this happens
Do you know how much my business... would be damaged?
Now everyone is worried?
All customers are gone
What am I to do?
I want to know what you are doing about it
Go protect people on this list
...or find out who's behind this!
You are the law, so you must do it yourself
Don't depend on that Tien Sun Hei guy
Alright, I'm done talking
This is my good brother, Qin Tiansheng
This is Mr Huang
Chief Investigator right? Hello
I'm Huang Ciao Long
Boss, the Japanese are here
There seems to be a problem
Wait, wait miss pretty...
Please take a seat
They are here
Mr. Owner
Sun Qi Chin, hello...
Long time no see
Have a smoke
Where the girls?
Why are there no girls sitting here?
Sorry
Hurry
Mr. Lu, I'll see to it for you
You can see, but what can you do?
You dare kick him out?
Where are the girls?
Right away
Sorry
Get them here...what's with you?
The beautiful lady is here
Come over here
Please sit, sit
You help us translate a bit...
Okay, speak
Today, the ladies of Caca...
...all don't want to sit with these Japanese folks
People will die, if you say that Lady Kiki
Say it...
Say it!
She says she won't sit with Japanese!
What?
It's nothing!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
Sorry...Hold it. ..
How's it? I'm here
Let me!
Sit down!
Sorry, I'm Qi Tiansheng.
Nice to meet you!
You're Qi Tiansheng, the business partner of Owner Lu right?
Your info is good!
Let me serve you!
I'm not only good with info but also like to find things
This man in this picture is also Qin Tiansheng.
I lost this picture a long time ago.
Thank you
No need to thank me. It wasn't hard to find
What's hard is telling who's real and who's not
Mr. Qin, Do you know who the green hornet is?
I've heard about this "green hornet" movie..
Not a bad film really!
After this movie came out, the ticket offices are packed
You've seen this movie?
After the kill list came out, you think the Green Hornet would appear?
You say the Green Hornet, huh...
Give me a sec, let me think...
YES!
Then let us make a bet!
More people die, or more saved by the Green Hornet...
Okay? what are we betting with?
A country!
Colonel Chikaraishi, great to have you here what we betting? a country?
My business partner, you guys have met
Interesting guy!
Owner Lu, why accept Mr. Qin as new shareholder
But denied us in joining you?
This small business isn't fit for the Japanese
We want in!
Then you can open another one. Guaranteed that it'll be bigger than this place
You're not afraid of competition?
If your place is a success, we'll close down right away!
The Japanese release of this kill list... besides Chinese, there's British, U.S, and French...What's your explanation?
This list is fake!
There's someone behind this trying to frame us!
Japanese troops are on the move. Are you guys invading China?
Does Japan want to start WWII?
My presence here at Casablanca is the best evidence!
Japanese and Chinese are good friends
Me and Owner Lu are good friends
We will never become enemies
I have to go. I'll come back when I have time
If you can, don't ever come back!
Mr. Li Tze Men, wait a sec!
I think you dropped this...
It's mine. Thank you.
Come to Japan sometime
Alright, next time.
Boss, it's alright now
Alright?
We just made enemies, and that's alright?
Yên
Expert Lam, go to Hong Kong and hide!
Okay, thank you ..
Feng Ting, I'll take you home..
Why is that?
You forgot you upset the Japanese?
There are lots of folks in Shanghai that upset the Japanese
How many can you protect?
As many as I can.
Careful!
Headlines!
Big Brother, tell the Hoa Chong brothers
Ready all our manpower! - Yes!
Combine with the students.
Fight back Japan!
Save our China!
Fight back Japan!
Save our China!
This is our China... How can I just leave?
Just because you say that, we cannot lose you!
It's only temporary leave
When it's safe, we'll bring you back
Who?
It's me, Hao.
Attacking the old and young, even me.
What did you do?
I told you to protect everyone
Protect the scholars and educated minds
I did follow your list of names
But those people...
...don't wanna leave, what can I do?
Threaten them!
You good at that, right?
What are you doing? Just go, go!
Don't push me! I won't push, just go!
You people don't have the right to do this
There're worse things...you wanna try it?
Get on, now!
From the General!
After you release this list, a lot of people ran away!
Then, doesn't that solve our problem?
Move aside..
Don't look!
Do not move!
What are you guys doing? Why...
Listen up!
British, Americans, Germans must unite
We must show the Japanese who runs Shanghai!
Damn you Japs! Do you hear me!
You bastards!
How brave you are!
Ever think about leaving Shanghai?
It's not like I've never left Shanghai
This time's different, it's with me.
Go where?
Anywhere is fine
When Shanghai is less chaotic
I'll take you with me
Right now, you have a lot of things to resolve.
This world has lot of problems...
How you going to resolve them?
If everyone leaves just like you...
This place won't exist.
With no country, there's still a home
You're not afraid of death?
Everyone dies it's important to die with meaning
Right?
When the ships dock, work with each other
Watch the spacing between ships
Now is when we show our nation's force
Going against China's army...
Number is not an issue..
We are for sure stronger!
Correct!
Then let's join together.
Don't you love to write? Keep writing!
Let's see how you write next time?
Chen Zhen..
Don't give up!
Boss, Chong from LuShan Times died!
So did the deputy editor...
Search again to be sure!
Your little brother died!
My good war brother taught me this piece
To save our country..
He was sacrificed in a battle with foreigners
Till this day..
The sacrifices continues...
Long live! Long live! Long live!
Japan's 80 planes bombarded the General's battlefield nonstop
Japanese ground troops at Honglong Giang blocks his retreat
Munitions are also destroyed ..
Let us unite, to defeat Japan
Fight Back against Japan!
Save our China!
These same old sayings, over and over!
These sayings are useless!
Just get the guns
Don't be rash!
To get ammo..
Right, that's it. Fight fast, win fast!
Cannot do this idea!
We can't just sit and wait
This time we must raise our flags!
Lady, your wine!
Thank you!
Sorry!
You got something to tell me?
1 sugar, 2 sugar..
No milk?
Why are you here at Casablanca?
I'm a dance girl..
So now you won't accept me
Wanna know this lowly girl origin?
You do not smoke, why tell Hong Lian to buy them?
I don't know what you're talking about
I really hope you can tell me that you don't work for the Japanese
Don't come back here again!
If you come back, I will kill you
Let me go!
No, don't hurt Kiki!
I am the General's girlfriend!
Anything you wanna say to him, he'll answer you guys
Don't throw Kiki into the water!
Do you guys understand what I'm saying?
Kiki, don't be scared!
They only want the General to listen to them
You know her?
You don't know her!
She's not Kiki, she's Sunko Yomei.
She is Japanese.
What do you want?
Thu Phe Yen has Yin Tze ..
I have her..
Both sides have the best spies
You cannot touch her, she's General Zeng's girl!
We can still use her..
She can be our hostage..
This is a lowly method... using a woman for blackmail
Do you think I'll do it?
This country needs an army to create confusion
General Zhou is against the idea of General Zeng working with us
So he sent someone to kill his wife
Sunko Yomei, it is YOU who will make this happen
Lt. Sunko Yomei, congratulations for accomplishing this
I will report to my chain of command in Tokyo!
Sorry to bother you!
I'm Huang Ciao Long from the police station
What do you want?
Im here to see Colonel Li Tze Men.
My wife.
Why so much?
Great, Chen Zhen calls us here, but he doesn't show up!
Alright, our plan depends on 3 main points
First, timing...
Since we are splitting up, we must arrive back at the same time!
Second, it's timing!
One extra second is one more danger
Third, it's still timing!
Here, hold it!
Hurry and go! what you doing here?
Come with us!
I've got it here, I'm the Chief Investigator
You're useless!
Continue!
Hurry!
Go!
Why is he here?
He is our country's enemy, that's why!
Every Chinese is our enemy!
How many can you imprison here?
What are you questioning him about?
Nothing.
Chen Zhen, you're being sloppy
Last year, you killed a man named Li Tze Chong.
That person is my father...
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia
Sir! Something happened at headquarters
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia!
Release him!
I still want a battle of life or death with you...
To revenge my father's death!
Hurry!
Japanese troops are here! Scram!
Hurry! Get out!
Over here, quickly!
Run!
Hurry, over here!
Hide over here!
Hurry! Get in!
Hurry!
Stop! Don't you run!
Idiot! Where did you place the bombs?
Fire! Put out the fire!
Chen Zhen the game ends now!
Mr. Qin!
Come and help!
Kill!
Don't worry, you're Chen Zhen's sister
How can I kill you?
Take her!
Move. Make way!
Move!
You watch here! You come here!
Get back, step back. There's nothing to see
My people wake up, wake up!
Fight back, save the homeland!
Save our country!
Disband Japan!
Our people wake up!
Our people wake up!
Save our country!
Special report, Shanghai Radio
The North Army attacked General Zhou... heavy losses
30,000 casualties...
The NE Army is losing hope...
You're having a good sleep!
You're good!
With the situation like this out there, you still can sleep
Now I think I'm the one running things
You're something else, just sleeping
But do you know what time it is now?
It's to the brink of disaster out there, Wake up!
I can't... I can't handle it all
Are you really Chen Zhen?  You need to wake up!
Fight Japan, Save country! Fight Japan, Save Country
Preserve our homeland! Preserve our homeland
Disband Japan! Disband Japan
My people wake up!
Protect our country!
Disband Japan!
Okay, okay..stop yelling
You noisy kids, what good does that do?
Go back, go back home!
That is Japan's Territory ahead...
I can't help you all if you cross that line
Who needs your help?
We don't need you patrol dogs to help!
Right! you all are Japan's lap dogs
You do not represent us Chinese!
Besides taking bribes, what else do you do?
Don't speak nonsense here!
You all, don't come near!
They fired!
Stop your fire!
Who fired?
Stop, stop your fire!
Stop, stop!
You won't control these students who started firing...
Now you tell me to let them go?
No, think about it, where did they get guns?
Must be someone else trying to start things
The students must be punished!
If not, how can I socialize with the Japanese?
You socialize with them?
Is this not English territory?
So useless!
You don't want to work here anymore?
Stay off!
This is China!
It's you that needs to get lost!
Let me tell you something, I can't stand you all pale pig skins...
Dancing around right in front of my face
I really want to tell your superiors
How much money do you take from us monthly?
Let's see who should get lost
Look at you! All day, you copy those dog foreigners
Without us, can you be so relaxed?
Without us, you can do nothing here!
You think you get to keep this job, for such a long time?
You still want to socialize with the Japanese?
Socialize my ass!
What? Something is wrong?
Can't understand me?
Then let me use English
You are useless!
Let me tell you, our country China has been here for thousands of years
Countless times, foreigners try to invade us
We give them only 2 words in the end,
"get lost"!
Yeah!
Let me free the students...
Whatever...
Awake, he's awake
Thank the stars! He is up
Brother Chen!
He's up, Doctor!
Hurry, come here!
Ting Hong, Fu Hai, Thong Man, Da Woh!
One by one right in front of us..
That's what the Japanese want
They wanted to show the people of China...
What should we do now?
When I left, Zhi Shan, she...
I'm okay, brother Chen
I am really alright...
Headlines! Headlines! General Zhou has lost!
General Zhou has lost completely...
Japan and General Zeng joined forces to defeat him
Both husband and wife are dead!
And the list of names...
In there, some are dead, some escaped
We've lost, let's surrender...
Just 2 of us cannot save the world
My brother!
Is it Kiki ? Am I mistaken?
I'm worried. You haven't worked for some time
You look very good in that!
I'm part of the Japan army secret force
Lady General!
Merry Christmas!
I represent the Japanese Army to meet you
I hope you can find one person
This is one of my people?
I don't know
His name is Chen Zhen
Did Chen Zhen not die?
We're also holding his accomplice, named Ta Kang
What if I don't give him up?
In the interest of Japan immigrants...
We expanded our patrol area of protection to them
Colonel Li Tze Men, he... has prepared the troops...
Then you're saying, if I can't give you the person..
You'll find an excuse to fight, right?
These shameless animals. You need to do this?
You have no other option
You!
We still have...
You!
What's happened?
Keep still!
Now... I have an option
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?
To protect China, Chen Zhen
Chen Zhen will win!
Jing Wu will live forever!
Chen Zhen will win!
Jing Wu will live forever!
I've been waiting a long time...
10 years of no martial art training
Everything is the same
Japan is mighty
There will only be one outcome
We also have one outcome
You must be crazy!
You promised not to kill him
You need to know one thing
Those who oppose Japan, I will not let them live
Watch her!
And you...
If you don't want to end up like her...
Then you just do what we do
Chen Zhen
Women are just objects for men to use
So our method is, your little sister is...
You all listen...
China is not the Sick Man of Asia
Stop! Everyone get back!
I want to fight him
Things between us shouldn't have started
Chen Zhen , I hurt you...
Come here!
You...
What? I'm here!
We'll make it back to China
We'll march forward together.
Our battlefield in China.
We only need to stick together.
No other country, no other man can defeat us
I told you to protect everyone!
We've lost, nothing else we can do...
Protect our homeland!
Are you not Chen Zhen? Wake up!
General, this way.
Salute!
After twenty days of continuous bombing,
Nanking finally fell to the Japanese.
It was December the 13th, 1937.
I remember everyone was running that day, but no one could escape that heavy fog.
Major Li only had a few men left.
Nanking was no longer able to put up a fight, and those left behind, ran for their lives.
Stop counting.
Shu and two others are missing.
Let us in!
There's no room!
Find your own place to hide!
I said, there's no more room!
Let's go.
Keep going!
Hey.
There are people inside.
Who is there?
Come out!
Come out!
Bastards!
Go to hell!
Stop!
Turn around!
Turn around!
Don't move!
American.
From the refuge.
What?
American.
Not soldier.
John Miller.
Raise your hands!
Working at the church.
Raise your hands!
I said raise your hands!
Separated...
You separated from your families?
You... families... separated?
I'm... going to...
Winchester Cathedral.
You know where it is?
Where?
Mister.
Did you say...
Did you say "mister?"
Who said "mister?"
You speak English?
We are from Winchester Cathedral.
Say that again.
We are from Winchester Cathedral.
You're kidding?
We are students at the convent.
You going there?
Why do you want to go there?
I'm helping to bury your father.
Well, not your father father...
Father Ingleman.
Father Ingleman, yeah.
I'm helping burying him.
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off... to heaven or wherever.
You show me the way?
Peng, move to the flank, prepare to engage.
Damn it, are you deaf?
Major Li, we are the last ones left.
We should leave the city now.
Keep fighting.
Yes sir.
Got you!
Let's go.
Yes sir.
That way!
Up there, on the right!
On the left! Fire!
Cover them!
The Chinese army didn't have adequate weapons to destroy the enemy's tanks, so they employed a tactic from ancient warfare.
They formed a human shield to get a bomb close to the tanks.
At the time, the Chinese people couldn't bear the thought of losing their country, and such selfless acts were not uncommon.
Zhen!
Let me go!
Zhen!
Come on!
Father Ingleman... fly away.
Fly away?
On here, Japanese, bomb.
- He flew away with the bomb, right.
- Yes.
Why was the deceased out here?
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?
He said, bad smell.
He moved the body here.
Who's Gu?
Gu is our cook.
He ran away.
He leaves some students here.
Some students took away by parents.
Some students nowhere to go.
So who's inside?
Just you and the girls?
Just you and the girls.
Even without a body, you gotta pay me.
No.
No... You gotta pay me.
No.
That's the rule.
There's nothing I can do about it.
With what I came through,
I should raise the price.
So is the money inside?
No. No money.
Money? Inside?
No.
Come on.
There's no money inside?
No.
Let's look.
It's a Catholic church.
There's gotta be some cash inside.
No.
No?
You say anything but no?
Can you fix truck?
Help us.
Leave Nanking.
Fix this truck?
For free?
No.
I can take parts, sell parts.
You got tools?
No.
Let's get inside.
Zhen didn't even make a noise.
Even when they stabbed her over and over, yet she didn't make a noise.
It's all my fault.
It's not your fault.
It is your fault.
Your father promised to take us on a boat and leave Nanking.
Where is he?
He ran off.
We waited and waited and now the Japanese are here.
Now the Japanese are everywhere, and it's too late to go to the refuge.
Zhen died because of your father!
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Stop!
Stop fighting!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
I'm John. Hi.
I'm American.
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.
I know it's hard.
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.
You know you two... you've seen enough... seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.
I can't... um...
I'm not good with kids.
Let's go.
You want some flour? You like some flour?
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.
Buns.
Buns, whatever.
Let's go find the collection box.
Where?
- Upstairs?
- No.
Oh, nice.
Forget going back to the refuge,
I think I'm bunking here tonight.
He's grim, who's that?
Is that Father Ingleman?
Yes.
These North Europeans they're all like, you know, tuna, playwrights, not much fun.
Look at that face, he's ruining the...
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?
I can't have a priest staring at me
- while I'm sleeping.
- No...
My father.
Me... orphan... adopted.
I'm sorry.
But I just...
It's not good for me to have a priest staring at me while I'm sleeping.
I can't.
Please, I gotta just... there, better.
You got any drink around here?
No.
You're a church. You got wine, something?
Nothing.
Nothing?
- No.
- No, no...
That's a shaving kit.
What a jerk!
I said you are a jerk!
What did you say your name was?
George Chen.
George.
Tomorrow, you fix truck, help us.
Fix truck?
No money!
Money, George.
Gu.
Open the door, it's Ling.
Can you hear me
Gu.
Open up.
It's Ling.
Did you really make a deal with him?
Of course.
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought you here.
Gu.
Open the door, it's Ling.
Gu, have you gone deaf?
Someone's here.
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.
Go to the refuge on the west side.
Leave now, go to the refuge.
No, we're here for Gu.
Gu's not here.
Bullshit! Get out of my way!
Gu told me, this church is under Western protection.
The Japanese can't come in.
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free, he promised to let us stay.
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!
He's really not here.
How come?
He ran off this morning.
You should go to the refuge.
We're not leaving.
Hey! How dare you!
Hurry.
Go to the refuge!
To the refuge!
The refuge doesn't even have space left for maggots.
Please, have some mercy and let us in.
Don't jump.
They're from the red-light district.
What's that?
It means brothel.
They were the famous women of the Qin Huai River.
The myths surrounding them were as ancient as the city of Nanking.
That's a Westerner!
Is he a priest?
No way.
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?
Who cares, as long as he can protect us.
True.
Come up here.
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.
Long time not make bread.
Long time not make bread? No bread?
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.
These women quickly took over the cellar.
It was once a filthy, messy place, but within hours, they had transformed it into the Qin Huai River.
The fragrance of rouge and perfume danced up through the air.
I can smell the bread.
We are coming up!
I couldn't stop them.
Hello.
I remember when I first saw these women, they were tramps, parading around in their lingerie, not the graceful ladies that the legends of Qin Huai had portrayed them to be.
Look, this should be good.
George, you little shit, you said there was no wine here.
Excuse me.
What's he saying?
Holy hooch!
How dare you drink the wine!
Now the Westerner knows about the wine.
We sell the wine to raise money for orphans.
We're all orphans.
We also need help.
That's right.
What are they saying?
They said they're orphans!
Orphans?
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you, right now.
Adopt all of us?
You would not be able to cope.
You are not the only ones who speak English!
That's right!
You speak English?
The Westerner is a playboy.
Of course! Haven't you heard?
Westerners with beards are the horniest!
No wonder she is the top girl of the Qin Huai River.
Mo, use all of your skills.
Seduce him!
That's right.
Make the big nose go crazy for us!
My name is John.
And you are?
Yu Mo.
Yu Mo.
I like that.
So what do you and your companions do?
We are kindergarten teachers.
Really? Kindergarten teachers.
Shameless.
And you?
What do you do?
I'm also a kindergarten teacher.
So as, teacher to teacher, you wanna... get together and have a cup of joe, or...
What're those two yapping about?
Tell me.
Nothing. He's asking your price.
I told him.
He thinks you are too cheap.
There's no coffee.
Let's get liquored up.
Cheers.
The kindergarten fee is enough?
You coming?
I want you to take us out of Nanking.
Yeah.
Right.
We do this first?
I'm serious.
Why else you think we were flirting with you?
Out of Nanking, how?
I don't know how, but I know your face is the way out of here.
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.
Did you see it out there?
That's not happening.
No.
Cash enough?
Cause... let's...
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
Wait...
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.
Think about it.
If you help us,
I will thank you in ways you can never imagine.
All of us Will.
Can I get an advance?
The Japanese have posted a notice, whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.
I'll shoot you first.
Little bastard.
Open up. Carry that guy in.
Get up.
Get some water.
Hurry up!
What a temper.
He thinks he's so tough.
He thinks he's a hero.
Since he's fighting the Japanese, protecting Nanking and women like us, he feels he is entitled to have a temper.
Women like us need to hide here.
But if he hides here, he's a coward.
True.
Yeah, what a sissy!
Got scissors?
Thanks.
- You ruined my dress!
- Don't touch him!
Save your attitude for the Japs.
They are searching for
Chinese soldiers like you.
You are endangering us!
There are convent girls here, too.
Understand?
Towel.
What a handsome face.
Dou has good taste in men.
I mean he looks like my brother.
Are you hot for him?
No, he really looks like my brother.
You have a crush on him.
No, I don't.
Dou, cool off.
He doesn't even have hair down there!
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.
He's called Pu Sheng.
He's just a child.
Why are you leaving him with us?
Get some cloth, tighten the bandage so he won't bleed too much.
It's the best I can do.
I want him to be in a warm place before he dies.
Thank you.
Please wait.
What do you want?
We have sharp tongues, and we were very rude.
I hope you can forgive us.
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.
Mo.
Like me as a priest? Do you?
I dressed up for you.
I got a chance now?
Is he the priest?
Does he belong to the church?
You can say that.
What, the bank's closed for me, but he gets...
He gets a special soldier discount or something?
Please tell him, the students can't end up in the hands of the Japanese.
Otherwise my men would have died for nothing.
What's wrong with you?
I want to help you.
I've joined the priesthood.
Stop it. It's not the right time.
You don't want cash.
You want me to save you.
I'm gonna save your soul.
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.
Blessed are thee among women.
Blessed are thy lips, blessed are thy eyes, blessed are thy hips...
Don't.
And thy gams, and thy chest...
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- I gotta...
Stop it!
You drunk bastard!
This is a house of love not war, you get out of here.
Who's he really?
An idiot. Don't mind him.
Fine, I'll leave now.
See,
I'm the only man for you.
You're such a fool!
If it wasn't for your foreign face...
I like it when you're angry.
I wouldn't even look at you!
Harder.
I'll never be into you.
Come here.
Get off me!
I love that!
I love seeing you walk away.
I love seeing that ass.
Mo!
Mo!
That night,
Major Li didn't go far.
He stayed at the paper shop across the street.
I know, he could have changed into civilian clothing and fled.
I said you can't go in!
Little sister, we won't shit or piss in there.
We just want to wash up.
We always wash before bed-time.
Bed-time?
Morning for you is night for us.
Little sister...
Don't call me sister!
You want to start a fight?
The bathroom is for people.
You mean we are not people?
You know what you are!
You've got some nerve!
We won't share the bathroom with you!
What a temper!
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.
What the hell?
She's humiliating us.
She thinks we are filthy.
Little bitch!
You're the bitch!
Watch your mouth!
Ling, want to see a good fight?
Really?
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.
Let's pull down your pants and see what you are made of.
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!
Let's find out if you really are cleaner than us.
Stop it! It's not fair!
I don't have to hit you,
I can just crush you with my butt!
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.
I won't let you go in!
Stop fighting!
What's going on?
Stop!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
We are just kids!
Hua, that's enough.
No, it's not over!
I won't let you go in!
Japanese!
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!
Search the yard!
Split up!
Hurry! Go to the cellar!
Come in, hurry!
Don't shut it, let the girls in.
Let the girls in!
Hurry!
Don't move!
Lieutenant Asakura!
Come over here!
Upstairs!
Hurry!
Let's move the shelves!
There are girls here!
Search everywhere!
Capture them alive!
Lieutenant Asakura!
Come up here!
We've got virgins!
Hurry!
Stop!
Girls! Girls!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
This is a house of the Lord!
These are children!
You are breaking the laws of man and of God!
No soldiers here!
You have no business being here!
I am the priest!
And I command you, in the name of the Father to leave now!
Girls, you come up here now!
Come up these stairs, and stand behind me.
You're honorable men, behave honorably!
I'll eat you up.
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!
Stop this! Don't...
Chinese soldiers!
Get them!
Let's go!
Assemble outside! Roll call!
Prepare for combat!
The sniper is across the street!
To your left!
It's a trap! Find the enemy!
Damn it!
He's in the building there!
Use the grenades!
Behind us! Fire!
Keep firing!
Hold your fire!
Wait!
Fire!
First platoon to the back gate!
Second platoon to the front gate!
Colonel, he used to work for the traffic department.
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.
Having him can be useful.
Speak Japanese?
Yes.
Were our soldiers here recently?
Are you the resident priest?
Yes.
Father,
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.
Please understand.
In the middle of a war, occasional unfortunate behavior is inevitable.
Your church is very beautiful.
How do you do?
Are you students here at the convent?
So sorry to have caused you alarm.
Please... don't hurt the children any more.
Naturally.
My name is Hasegawa.
I am responsible for the safety of this area.
Please do not worry... about the security of the church and the students.
I apologize... but I have no confidence... in that assurance.
My guarantee is effective.
From now on,
I shall post armed guards in front of the church to protect you all.
There is not a lot of food in Nanking at the moment.
I hope the students will not go hungry.
May I?
Thank you.
Did you like it?
This is a Japanese folk song,
"My Home."
It is about hills and rabbits, and streams full of fish.
It is the most beautiful song in the world for those who are homesick.
Do the students sing well?
Very well, yes.
That's good.
I shall come back in a couple of days to hear them.
Why?
No reason.
I happen to love music.
Father, we shall meet again soon.
I hope you will not be lonely buried together.
Father John.
You won't leave us, will you?
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.
Sorry.
If we hadn't fought with that girl, she would still be alive.
This is all our fault.
Thank you.
Why not answer Shu?
She called me Father John.
We all need you.
I'm a mortician.
You are priest.
No.
- If we have a priest...
- George.
Maybe Japanese... not dare...
You are priest!
George, I'm not.
I'm not a priest.
I'm not!
I stayed here, because I was looking for your cash.
And because that's the nicest bed that
I've slept in in years. I didn't get there.
But is that like a priest?
I'm not a priest!
I'm not.
I took catechism lessons as a kid.
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk, which I am as often as I can be.
You not be priest.
Tell girls yourself.
You little shit!
You are.
We've heard about what happen today.
So you're staying?
Yeah.
Even though you were a drunk bastard last night, what you did today makes you a hero.
I'm sorry about last night.
Yeah.
I can't leave them by themselves.
And that little shit has a way of just... you know.
What do you think the Japanese are up to?
Are they really here to protect the students?
We were counting on having you help us leave Nanking.
But I guess now you'll have to stay here and be a priest.
Yeah, right.
Priest.
Actually, I came to tell you, our offer is still good.
We still want you to help us escape.
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.
Just now the ladies were having a bet.
They said that hero or no hero, you don't stand a chance when you're up against a beauty like me.
Don't flatter yourself.
We'll see.
Did you like it?
I only have one string.
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.
You're Pu Sheng.
Born in the Pu region?
My family is also from there.
When you're healthy,
I'll take you to the biggest dance hall, to see the prettiest girls.
Thank you.
Little hometown fellow, don't thank me, marry me.
I'll work in the fields with you.
I don't have... fields.
What do you have then?
I don't have anything.
Then I'll play my pipa everyday.
When I play, you hold out a bowl.
We'll beg for food and feed your mom.
I don't have a mother.
Everyone in my family is dead.
If you had just come with me, this wouldn't have happened.
You were so stubborn, and wouldn't leave without your classmates.
How could I have gotten that many boat tickets?
Because of you,
I'm staying in Nanking.
Tell me, what's this?
Explain to me, why do you do this?
If I don't do this,
I can't survive.
I'm doing this for you.
You must believe me,
I would never do anything bad.
Daughter,
I will find a way to get you out of Nanking.
No wonder there were no boat tickets.
Traitor!
You work for the Japanese?
Since I cannot save my country, cannot save others,
I can only try to save myself.
I'm already doing my best, you know.
Do you think it's easy working for the Japanese?
It's good you work for the Japanese, that helps us.
What is your plan for your daughter?
I would like to try, and use my connections with the Japanese to get my daughter out of the city.
Not to the refuge?
The refuge?
It's not safe there at all!
What's your plan for the rest of the girls?
Mr. Meng?
I have this truck.
If I can get the right tools, then maybe I can get it started.
Can you help me?
I have a list here.
Mr. Meng.
I need these tools.
Can you help me get them?
You're the only one who can get them for me.
I need these tools.
I need these tools.
Take this.
Take this.
If I fix the truck...
If I fix the truck, what then?
How would I know?
Wait, wait.
If I fix the truck, what would I need then?
Of course you'll need a permit.
I need a permit?
I need a permit.
Don't look at me.
It's too risky!
Even if you fix the truck, how would you get past the Japanese guards?
I don't know.
I don't know how long the guards will stay here.
But I want to get that truck started for when they leave.
It seems that you know more than just drinking.
I don't think she likes seeing us together.
She has a crush on you.
Really?
You know, I was like her.
Yeah?
I was at a convent for six years.
That's where you learned your English?
What happened?
Just another story of misfortune.
It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.
Yeah, it would.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I was never meant to be like this.
Never mind.
You know what?
I was the best in my English class, but everyone used to mock me.
They said I put on airs and graces and acted like I was the Queen of England.
Well, that's not what you were going to tell me, but...
So... the Queen of England.
You mean you're not?
I thought... yeah.
Like Shu, I too had a crush on someone.
But he was a young, fresh-faced guy, got the most beautiful eyes, not a dirty, bearded man like you.
OK.
It's rotten.
Sister.
Sister.
What are you saying?
Sister...
Hurry...
Pu Sheng,
I'm here.
Thunder...
What are you trying to say?
Rain...
Rain...
What rain?
It's death weeping for you.
The wheat is drying outside...
Don't let it get soaked.
That was the soldier that the officer brought.
I heard he was about our age.
Which officer?
The officer who saved us that day.
He hid the soldier inside the cellar, and the women were taking care of him.
Actually those women from the brothel... are not that bad.
Where's Dou?
Lan's missing too.
Really?
Haven't seen them for a while.
Are they still in the cellar?
Have you seen Dou?
Dou and Lan got out.
How?
Where did they go?
Dou insisted on getting pipa strings.
She wanted to play the pipa for Pu Sheng.
She said he had a hard life, and he was like her brother.
She wanted to play something nice for him, but one string wasn't enough, she needed three more.
What about Lan?
Why did she go?
She said she left her earrings behind.
How could they leave?
The Japanese are guarding the gates.
I don't know how they got out.
They disappeared when it was dark.
Dou said that if she didn't go soon it would be too late for him.
Why didn't you stop them!
I tried, but it didn't work!
What happened?
Dou and Lan snuck out on their own.
Dou and Lan?
How? How did they leave?
I don't know.
You know when?
No.
Where did they go?
They went back to our brothel to get pipa strings.
You want me to... go find them?
Yeah.
Mo, I'm not sure...
Please.
Please. Please!
Alright, it's safer for me than anyone else, so I'll try.
I'll try.
If I can leave. If they let me leave.
Candles, food.
There is no food.
They need food.
With no food.
No singing.
Hasegawa asks girls to sing.
Sing for the girls.
Hasegawa asks.
But no singing with no food.
And candles for Hasegawa.
I go get food.
Girl sing. Hasegawa happy. Yes?
I go now.
George, you're not coming.
I go, for food?
Yes?
George, you're not coming.
Go back inside!
Yes?
Make Hasegawa happy.
Go!
This is fine, I go. Thank you.
Officer, is he allowed to leave?
We've been told not to let the girls leave.
But he's the priest.
Terry?
Terry.
John?
I tried getting back,
I tried getting back to the refuge.
I got stuck.
I couldn't get back.
I was trying to get back. I'm sorry.
I thought you were... I figured you were dead.
I'm looking for two women, they got shiny dresses.
I need to find them. They are in trouble.
Why are you dressed like this?
What is this?
I got drunk, I woke up, I was just... dressed as a priest.
Who is this?
This is George. This is George.
Have you seen them?
Seen who?
The women!
There're women piled up all over the street.
You haven't seen them?
No, I haven't seen any women. No.
You think it's safe to be looking at the women right now?
Can you help me with tools?
Tools for what?
I gotta fix a truck.
Fix a truck for what?
I gotta help George,
I gotta help some girls,
I gotta help some women, they're prostitutes, and I gotta help them.
What? Are you kidding me?
You're talking about prostitutes and trucks, and tools.
I'm talking about not dying in China.
I'm leaving right now.
You're leaving Nanking right now?
Do you wanna go?
There's a boat. It's waiting for us.
I'm leaving right now!
If you wanna go, then let's go!
It's your last chance.
I gotta find them.
I can't leave.
Are you kidding me right now?
I'll see you, Terry!
I'll see ya.
Take off your coat!
Hurry!
They went that way.
Those are their coats.
Look! Those are young girls' coats!
The girls can't be far.
Oh no, I dropped the strings!
Forget it.
No, I have to find them.
Over there!
Don't shoot!
Lan!
Lan!
Don't run!
Bitch!
Go to hell!
We'll deal with her later.
Let's catch the other one.
Let's go!
Here she is!
Why am I always the last one?
You shouldn't have shot the other girl.
It's not fair!
Hurry!
Fuck you!
Fuck you all!
Bitch! You bit me!
I'll kill you!
What an idiot! You got bitten!
You can only handle the dead one upstairs!
Is it? George, yes?
Is it?
Is it?
Yes?
Stay there, stay there.
They were on their way back.
It was a stray bullet or... maybe...
I don't know.
I don't think they suffered.
I don't think so.
Is that true?
Yes.
He said
Dou and Lan were hit by stray bullets that they didn't suffer.
Come in.
George.
Come in. George.
It's me.
I only have two minutes.
The guards finally let me in.
These tools you need.
Thank you.
Now, listen to me.
- This permit was for my daughter.
- Right.
But I can't carry out my plan.
You are my only hope now.
The Japanese don't trust me any more.
You are a Westerner.
You can help her.
My daughter wouldn't leave without her classmates.
Please think of a way to get her out of Nanking.
The permit is only good for a short time.
When you manage to leave the church, remember, head west.
There's a way out of the city there.
I have to go.
Thank you, Mr. Meng.
Mr. Meng, thank you.
Mr. Meng, with your connections... is there anything else you can do for us...?
No, no, sorry.
John,
I'm handing my daughter over to you.
I have promised her mother,
I'll take good care of her.
OK.
Please.
Mr. Meng, thank you.
Thank you for this.
You are a good man.
In the eyes of my daughter,
I'm a bad man, a traitor.
No.
Thank you.
Damn Mosquito, her cat ran off.
She went up to look for it.
Good.
You sing very well.
Haven't I told you?
You can't come out!
Officer, this student has lost her uniform.
Because we wanted to look our best today, we asked her not to participate in the performance.
Please forgive the intrusion.
Father,
I would like to announce some good news.
Tomorrow our division is celebrating the successful occupation of Nanking.
Esteemed Father, on behalf of all the officers,
I would like to invite your church choir to perform and celebrate with us.
This is the official invitation.
They are asking us to sing at a party tomorrow.
This is a very kind invitation,
Mr. Hasegawa.
However, unfortunately, the children will not be able to attend.
Why not?
Sir, they're very young.
I'm not sure that it is appropriate for them to attend an adults' party.
As their guardian and protector, that's my responsibility.
But we thank you very much.
I am sorry.
This is an order from above.
I cannot disobey.
Sir.
Please think about the girls.
I can see that you are a man with culture.
Last time you played us a beautiful song, for people far from home.
You missed the rivers and hills.
Please consider that theirs have been destroyed, they have no home, nothing.
They are living in hell.
With this invitation, you are asking them to celebrate that.
I know that you understand.
With respect, sir,
I cannot allow that. I think that is...
I think that is brutal, sir.
Please remember, tomorrow at four in the afternoon, a car will come to pick up the students.
I am carrying out military orders.
Mr. Hasegawa, you tell me what will happen at these celebrations.
Mr. Hasegawa.
You said you posted guards for our security.
Have you been keeping these girls locked up until these celebrations?
The children cannot go.
Mr. Hasegawa.
Mr. Hasegawa!
The children cannot go!
The children cannot go!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, night, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
All, must go!
Father John, what do the Japanese want us to do?
Do they want us to sing?
Yeah.
I'm not a student.
I don't have to go.
Well, I'm not a student.
I won't go.
You have to!
The Japanese have counted you!
I don't care, I won't go!
You have to go!
Now you're saying you aren't a student.
Why didn't you tell the Japanese earlier?
Stop staring at me!
Save your attitude for the Japanese!
Do you think the Japanese really invited you to sing?
Dream on!
What do they do all day in Nanking?
They murder, burn, and rape!
You know?
Go ahead and go, but I won't go!
Mosquito, you shut up!
You are all mean to me!
I'm not going!
That's not true what she said.
These men are different from the others.
These men are educated.
They are officers.
These men are gentlemen.
I've been to things like these before, and... it's nice.
It's elegant, it's a...
It's a party.
There's nice things at parties.
There's cakes and there's flowers and there's chocolates and there's dancing... and there's... all of these things, which are lovely.
Please don't think about what she said.
I'm a terrible dancer, and maybe one day one of you could teach me how to dance. That would be nice.
Please don't think about that.
Because that's not true.
I... lied to you as well.
Your two friends who went for the pipa strings, they weren't shot.
I'm sorry.
I think you already knew.
Yes.
Sometimes, the truth is the last thing we need to hear.
I heard what you said to the girls.
What are you gonna do?
I gotta get the truck started.
And after that?
I have an idea.
Maybe I can save one of them, with your help.
How?
The Japanese thought
Mosquito was one of the girls.
She tricked them.
Why can't I?
No.
If you're saying what I think you're saying, no.
That's not happening.
Remember? Like them,
I was at a convent for six years.
But unlike them,
I was raped by my stepfather when I was thirteen years old.
By their age,
I was already forced to take my first clients.
I don't want them to go through that.
But I can't let you do that, Mo.
I can't let you do that.
What are you doing?
Get back in.
You can't leave.
Get back in!
Get in there!
What are you doing?
Go back!
I said go back in!
I will be the first.
Remember who's in front of you.
When we go, we will stick to this order.
Shu, isn't there a better solution?
No.
We won't let the Japanese hurt us again.
Girls.
Shu!
Wait, just...
Go away!
Come down!
OK, OK.
Stay back, OK.
Don't do anything foolish!
So many people have died.
Even hell is packed.
Why should you add to the crowd?
Shu, don't do this.
You can't do this!
We can't just throw our lives away.
Life is a sacred gift.
It's not ours to throw away.
Keep away! Step back!
OK.
We're stepping back.
Come up!
Didn't we say we are going to jump together?
UP here!
Come up now!
Listen to me, Shu, I have an idea.
I will go in your place.
Tell the girls to get down.
Tomorrow I will go for you.
Did you hear me? I will go in your place!
What? Who is going in who's place?
I will also go for you.
Right, we will all go instead of you.
We can handle the Japs.
We will protect you.
We will replace you!
Don't worry, you have us to protect you.
Yes, we won't let the Japanese hurt you.
Do you hear us?
We will go in your place.
Come down and don't jump.
Come down.
We're telling them the idea I told you about.
It's a good idea. That's it, girls.
Shu, come here, it's a good idea.
We can trick the Japanese.
Alright? We'll make it fun.
Come down, we think about it.
We just come down, and think about it.
We can make it work.
We only said it so they would get down from the tower.
But you shouldn't have lied to them.
Hua, remember?
If you weren't lied to, you wouldn't have ended up in a brothel.
Shut up! Mosquito.
I'm not stupid.
If nobody goes you'll still have to go.
You were counted by the Japanese!
Unless the Japanese are insane,
I don't think they will kill us.
They just want pleasure.
That's what we do.
We have experienced all kinds of men.
As long as we can get out alive, we will find a way to survive.
Ling, how do you expect the girls to handle the Japanese?
Even if they make it back alive, they won't be able to carry on.
I just don't think it's worth it.
They wouldn't even let us use the bathroom, yet, we're supposed to kiss their asses, and sacrifice ourselves for them?
I don't want to hear your nonsense.
If Shu hadn't diverted the Japs the other day, where would we all be right now?
Remember how the ancient poem describes us?
"Prostitutes never care about a falling nation,"
"they sing and dance while others are dying."
You are not so foolish after all.
I'm impressed.
Mo just taught me those two lines.
Of course we should remember the poem that criticizes us.
But, I think, we should do something heroic, and change the old way of thinking.
Mo, others say I always follow your lead,
I say, we share the same life.
Whatever you say,
I will go with you.
I will go too.
Me too.
Count me in.
Mo, we worked together for three years, and you were always more popular than me.
I know, you always looked down on me, and I never respected you either.
Well, today I hear you.
I say we all go, so we can look after each other.
Mo, you are right.
People say
"whores are heartless."
So tomorrow, let's do something honorable with our hearts.
We will all go.
If they went, how would the Japanese treat them?
Will they tear their clothes?
Will they beat them?
What if the Japanese rape them?
Are you kidding?
No.
Have you seen these women?
Those Japanese don't stand a chance.
These women... these women are formidable.
Brave, exquisite, skillful.
They've got character, like nobody I've ever met.
The Japanese?
They're amateurs, amateurs.
These women, they are professionals.
Father John, what exactly do they do?
You know... they...
They love and they hate, just like all of us.
Maybe they know more about it than any of us.
These women if they came face to face with the devil himself, he'd be putty in their hands.
These idiot? These soldiers?
You think they're scary?
They're not scary.
If you think somebody's scary, you picture them with their pants around their ankles, sitting on the crapper, alright?
Picture that.
Not so scary then.
These women, and you girls, you gotta strength and beauty that will never die.
So don't you worry about them.
Don't worry about them.
But... but they don't look anything like us, how can they go?
That's where my powers come in.
I don't do much very well.
But that, that I do well.
And I'll make them look like your twins.
You'll see.
Father John,
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.
Shu, you don't have to be sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
No, I was wrong.
What is it?
From the first day she came here,
I felt uncomfortable.
I thought she was not good.
I even thought both of you were not good.
That's ok.
I want to say to her, sorry.
And say to you,
I'm sorry.
You don't have to say you're sorry.
You got nothing to be sorry about.
I had seen many people pray before, but that night, the sight of
John's back as he prayed would stay with me for the rest of my life.
They brought new uniforms.
Our old uniforms were torn, so I brought you new ones.
Father Ingleman wanted us to wear them for Christmas.
You don't mind me wearing it?
The sleeves are short.
Try it on.
Big sister.
I can't button it up for you.
I'm already skinnier from starvation.
You are not built like a student, more like a student's wet nurse!
I have an idea, to fool the Japanese, let's use the curtains to make the uniforms fit, and tear up the sheets to wrap our chests.
So, our boobs won't pop out.
What're we doing, George?
What're we doing?
Listen, your God teaches, everybody's born equal, right?
So, the women, the girls, which?
What would you do?
We must.
What else we can do?
He gave me these bracelets so I would go with him.
I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.
I should have.
I was so stupid.
You would be even more stupid wearing them to meet the Japs.
Leave them here.
Fine, they are yours now.
When I was your age,
I had already served countless men.
Little sister, remember to give this back to me.
I will use the money to buy myself out of my contract.
Big sister, I'm sorry.
Live a good life for me.
I don't have any things of value, that cat is all I have.
He ran away the other day.
Little sister, promise me, you will find him.
OK.
Remember Dou?
She wasn't much taller than you.
Please take good care of it.
This is Dou's life.
She wanted to play "The Qin Huai View," and for that she was killed.
The Qin Huai View
Is that a beautiful song?
That's our signature song at Jade Paradise.
Why don't we sing it for Dou?
It was her dying wish after all.
Let's sing it for the girls, so they remember us at our best!
"I have a story,"
"and let me put it into song."
"I hope every one of you"
"can listen to me patiently."
"Allow me"
"to sing the legend of the Qin Huai River,"
"slowly and passionately,"
"for each one of you."
"Ever since the ancient era,"
"the river has been flowing gracefully."
"it is the beauty of the South,"
"the elegance of Nanking."
"Walk in the famous Zhan Palace,"
"enjoy the spectacular architecture."
"Look at the Colony of Cranes"
"with water rippling all around."
"What a paradise this is."
Mo, would...
You look so sweet.
Would you mind... lying down?
I'm just not used to...
People who can sit?
Right, people who can sit.
Would you mind?
I understand, I don't mind.
So madam, what will it be?
Fourteen years old?
How about thirteen?
Until thirteen I was a good girl.
Very good.
Thirteen it is.
So I'll straighten your hair, cut it in a bob.
I have an idea,
I think it'll be beautiful.
This is what we need.
It's perfect.
The way you are now, is what I like the best.
I see you.
I see everything that you've been through.
And I want all of that, Mo.
I want all of it.
I love it.
I love it all.
Are you going to fall in love with me?
I already have.
I can do this.
Sorry, these are not my clothes.
I wanna promise you something.
When this war is over,
I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna take you home.
No.
After tonight, my body will no longer be mine.
Take me home now.
Wow, Mo!
He can turn back time.
He chopped away five or six years!
Three more chops and we'd all be infants, so we can start our lives over again!
Have you asked him, where he learned such skills?
Mo, ask him to cut our hair too.
They all want you to give them a makeover.
My pleasure.
Glad to serve you.
Here.
He has to work with you lying down.
Right, he's a mortician, he only knows how to work on dead people.
Are they disturbed... by the way I work?
Sorry.
He hopes you won't mind.
Whatever, who cares?
I just want to look like a pretty schoolgirl.
Give me a coat.
His hands are so soft.
Mo, did he really work on the dead?
Mo, we're going to sleep.
Wake us up when it's our turn.
You've done this your whole life?
For five years.
You do this very well.
It matters.
It matters to me.
Before my daughter died, she made me promise to make her beautiful again.
That was the first time.
It's important.
It's important work.
I'm sorry.
She would have been twelve.
Like the girls.
Yeah.
Mo, he's amazing!
If only my mother were alive, she would have been so happy to see me like this.
She said, we never had a scholar in our family.
Now you are a scholar, so am I.
My mother wouldn't recognize me either!
Of course not.
We are now students.
Let's line up.
Mo, let him see if we all look like students.
No need to count, we only have twelve.
We are one short.
How many did the Japanese say?
How many?
Thirteen.
How many?
Thirteen. We only have twelve here.
This is a terrible joke.
One of the students still has to go!
We did all of this for nothing!
I will go.
What did he say?
I will go.
George.
He said he would go.
What are you talking about?
You are a boy!
Father Ingleman ask me to protect students.
But I'm not good.
I'm... I'm terrible.
I'm... I'm bad.
Who cares if we are one short?
We will just say that one of us has died from an illness.
My grandma told me that the Japanese can't count.
We can't do that!
The Japanese are very astute!
They will search everywhere, and it will be the end for the students!
There is nothing you can do.
They will see that you are a boy.
You can't fool them.
Yes, it's too obvious.
It's a short distance from the church to the car.
If I am made-up as a girl, lower my head, and walk right behind you all,
I'm sure the Japanese won't notice!
If we have one missing, the Japanese will find out, then... a big trouble.
You are good at make-up.
You can do for me.
George, I'm not that good.
No, you can.
George, stop it.
- It can't work.
- You can!
The church to the car just a short way!
You are good at make-up, you can do for me!
I will lower my head!
It's possible, it just a short way!
You can.
It's possible.
You know what could happen?
Yes, yes, I know.
I can do what Father Ingleman tell me.
Amazing.
I think I hear what the Father is saying right now.
Yes?
Yeah.
What he saying?
I think he's saying... that you've done an incredible... an incredible job, taking care of the girls.
And that you're good, so good.
And I think he's also asking... what the hell are you doing... with that awful wig on your head?
This was the last time I saw George Chen.
When he was six years old, and almost died of starvation,
Father Ingleman saved him.
He rang the church bell, swept the floor, and worked in the kitchen.
We used to laugh at him, whenever he spoke in English or in Nanking dialect.
You know that, you can't really go there.
You gotta escape somehow before you get there.
You gotta jump from the car or the truck or whatever.
You wait until it slows down, goes around the corner, that's when you jump.
No, I'm no jumping.
Don't teach me.
Why not?
If I jump,
Japanese will find out.
I will go all the way, give you more time. You and the girls get out of the church.
Hide your weapons well.
Don't let the Japanese see.
Don't worry, at least we will get an eyeball.
Have you got something as well?
Following our commander's order,
I'm here to pick up the students.
Here is a gift bag from our troops.
Please accept it.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Kato.
Have you spoken with Colonel Hasegawa?
My daughter, she doesn't have to go, right?
The order is from the chief commander.
Even Colonel Hasegawa can't interfere.
Get out.
Mr. Kato.
But you promised to help.
Shut up!
The chief commander is in charge.
Look, he sent troops just for this.
We can't do anything.
But we had a deal.
I have given you all of my valuables.
Mr. Kato.
Please, you promised!
When did I take your things?
That was for our military expenses.
Then I'm begging you, please allow me to see my daughter one last time.
I'm not a student. I won't go!
I won't go!
I'm not a student!
Isn't that your daughter?
What is she saying?
Why is she shouting?
I'm not a student!
I won't go!
Be gentle with her, she's just a girl.
You've seen your daughter.
Let's go.
Come on.
Shu.
Come here.
Your father is a good man.
We could never have done this... without your father.
He's a good man.
Watch your legs.
John told me that his biggest regret was that, because we had to get out as quickly as possible, he couldn't give my father a proper burial.
Is this good for me to go through?
What's on the truck?
Empty wine cases, but... four of them are full. They are... very good, very good.
Here.
You see, vintage.
If you would like some.
Open it.
These.
Take.
Until this day
I still don't know what happened to the women of the Qin Huai River.
I never learned all of their names, and never saw them being taken away by the Japanese.
So, I always imagine...
I imagine myself standing by the large round window, watching them walk in once again.
Yeah!
Steinar...
You were right.
Some of them do have brains.
More than can be said for you, you fucking animal.
Good that we wet our blades so quickly.
They were just farmers.
Well, now they're farming in Hell.
The rest of our boats will be in by nightfall.
Bring up the horses.
Halfdan can follow once they've landed.
My father's not a patient man.
Grim, Jokul.
If he's a Saxon, he's gonna have a fuck of a surprise
- when he rides into us.
- That's no Saxon.
So this is our welcome.
Vali, what's happened?
The omens promised victory if we attacked early.
The Gods were against us.
Your father's badly wounded, Steinar.
Take me to him.
Steinar.
Better late than never.
I came when I said I would.
And this is the army you brought with you?
He was fed Gruel at first light.
The onions can already be smelled through his stomach.
If his guts are pierced, there's nothing more we can do.
How long?
A week, maybe less.
Listen, Steinar,
I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but we're still brothers after all and I want you to know that when I'm King
I'll make sure you're taken care of.
The omens deceived us, Steinar.
An army of 500 are only hours behind me.
All this talk of reason... sounds like a cover-up for weakness.
We lie here because we have no choice.
We need land!
We either take it
or our people perish.
We may have lost the battle, father, but we can still win the war.
And who'll lead them?
You?
In all your fucking finery?
I will lead our army, father.
You're no more fit than he is.
Once, maybe.
But after your mother left... you changed, turned your back on the Gods.
Thought you knew better, huh?
I am strong enough to be King.
Then prove it.
Your half brother-- my bastard son--
refused to enter the field of battle.
I made him swear an oath to wait till I returned.
You know the punishment for those that turn their back in combat.
See it's done.
I will do it, father.
Leave him, Harald.
Leave him!
Get out, now!
Not you, Steinar.
There's a man worthy of this crown, a man with fire in his heart, brave enough to wield the Hammer of the Gods-- my firstborn.
You said you'd kill anyone who mentioned his name.
The time has passed.
Nobody knows where he is.
He hasn't been seen for years.
Find your brother.
Find Hakan.
Return with a King who will lead us to victory.
I am needed here.
I may be dying, but I'm still your King.
Defy me again, and I will cut your heart out myself.
Now swear on the memory of your mother.
I swear.
You're out of your fucking mind.
- I swore an oath.
- Oaths are horseshit, Steinar.
I gave him my word.
I will not break it.
Hakan is almost certain to be dead by now.
And if he's not, he was fucking insane before he was banished; he'll only be more so now.
Anyway, who knows where the fuck he is?
- You do.
- It's too dangerous.
Dangerous, is it?
Then you must know where he is.
Listen, say I do know-- which I don't, but say I did-- what makes you think he'd come back?
It's the King's wish.
The King will be dead in a week.
Bide your time.
Be close at hand when he dies.
And when the moment's right, you take the crown for yourself.
We'd all back you against Harald.
Think about it.
When I said I didn't know where Hakan was,
I spoke the truth.
But I do know how to find the last man who saw him.
Whether he's capable of helping us remains to be seen.
- Going somewhere?
- It doesn't concern you, grim.
Let us pass.
- Like fuck.
- You'd think differently if you knew where we were going.
We're heading for the black mountains in search of Ivar the boneless.
That fat fuck?
Last night I heard he chopped his own head off.
Well, I heard he transformed himself into a bear.
What do you want with that cocksucking maniac anyway?
He's the only one who can lead us to Hakan.
It's a two-day ride through saxon country, and who knows after that?
You think we're cowards, is that it?
It sounds like it to me.
'Cause if it is, you can kiss my fucking axe.
I looked at the bones,
Steinar.
It's already been decided-- we'll travel together.
- The bones said that?
- Aye.
How far do you think you'll get?
Take us with you-- you double your odds.
Not you, vali.
Well, why not?
'Cause your sword's as limp as your cock, boy.
Steinar, take me with you.
Watch Harald, hmm?
Report to me when I get back.
The sun is sinking.
Let's find a place to rest.
Yeah.
There was a time when they did everything together--
Hakan and Ivar.
My father went raiding with them-- fucking carnage.
After Hakan was banished, people were less willing to tolerate
Ivar's behavior.
He knew where Hakan had gone, so he set off after him.
Why do they call him boneless?
Because you could never see his cock,
'cause it was always rammed to the hilt up some young boy's asshole.
They say he felt no pain.
Which is more than can be said for the young boy's asshole.
I fought beside him a couple of times.
Whatever people think of Ivar now, he was something to behold in battle.
They both were.
Why did my father banish Hakan?
He was cursed.
Your father had his reasons.
Maybe it doesn't matter what he did.
It does if he's gonna be King.
Steinar, it's me!
Argh!
You'll get yourself killed.
I did as you said.
I followed Harald.
He rode out almost the minute you left.
He crossed the saxon lines and spoke to their King.
Fucking snake!
I didn't know what to do.
You did the right thing, vali.
You should head back now, before they notice you're gone.
No, it's too dangerous.
Vali can ride with us.
Grim, get him some food.
He can get his own food.
We turn back, cut Harald's balls off and rip out his spine.
No. We continue our ride north.
Steinar, Harald's cut a deal with the Saxons.
Our men would never back Harald.
It's one thing to want the crown, another to take it.
You'd rather we have us climbing mountains on some fucking bear hunt while your cunt fuck of a brother sells our women to a bunch of farmers!
Our women are more than a match for Harald.
Grim, nobody forced you to come.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
Oh, I know you struggle with your beliefs, that you deny the Gods and the significance of signs...
But a lone rider arriving under a full Moon?
Even you can't deny what a bad omen that is for all of us.
He's young.
He's got good instincts.
He brings death with him.
I'm not about to turn against him for the sake of your superstitions.
If a man doesn't believe in omens, then how can he know what he believes in?
He can believe in himself.
No!
We should ride on.
You bitch!
You're right.
Stop!
Stop.
- Let her go.
- Fuck you, heathen.
Argh!
- You all right?
- Crazy fucking bitch.
Let's go.
The horses won't make it much further.
Then we continue on foot.
Vali, you wait with the horses till we return.
Don't light a fire.
Fires attract cave trolls.
Don't worry.
They only eat virgins.
They'll eat anything if they're hungry enough.
Speaking of cave trolls, how is your sister?
Fuck you, grim.
She certainly did.
Still hurts when I piss.
We'll be back by first light.
Steinar.
Thanks.
We're brothers.
What was that?
Perhaps we should wait till nightfall.
Some creatures fear the Moon.
It would be safer.
Ivar, it's me-- hagen grettison.
My name is Steinar, son of bagsecg.
What the fuck are you doing here, prince?
You wanna fuck with me?
I'll bet you do.
I'll bet you do.
Ivar, the King is dying.
We need your help.
Everyone dies some time.
How about you, prince?
Do you want to die today?
We seek the new King--
Hakan.
So you're looking for your brother?
Know where he is?
Why the Hell would I tell you?
Out of respect.
Respect is not a birthright, little prince.
You want someone's respect, you've got to earn it.
You want to earn my respect?
You'd better be stronger than you look.
- There has to be another way.
- He feels no pain.
The only way he'll tell us is through choice.
Three cups for your three chances.
You win-- I'll tell you everything you want.
I win-- you drink.
You drink all three-- you lose and you're mine for the night, to do with as I see fit.
Ah.
First to fold or break.
Begin!
Come on, Steinar.
- Come on, Steinar.
- Put your shoulder into it.
- Take him, Steinar.
- Come on, Steinar.
- Come on.
- Take him.
Drink up, little prince.
That'll put hairs on your ball sack.
Tell me you have a plan.
Shall we go again while our cocks are still hard?
First to fold or break.
- Begin.
- Come on.
- Put your shoulder into it.
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on, Steinar.
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck.
Two down, one to go.
What chance now, Princess, hmm?
Jokul, your belt.
Give me your belt, quick.
Your belt.
Good, Steinar.
The serpent will protect you.
With the Gods on your side, you can't lose. Hmm?
Yeah.
We've got your back.
You know that.
But the only way we'll stop him is if we kill him.
Ahh.
I am looking forward to making a woman out of you, Princess.
Oh, don't look so sad.
You might even enjoy it.
First to fold or break.
Begin.
Come on, Steinar, push!
Come on, break his fucking wrist.
Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh. Argh!
Ooh ooh.
Ooh.
What did you say your name was?
Steinar.
You're an asshole, Steinar.
I like assholes.
I didn't leave out of choice.
I became persona non grata.
That's latin.
Hakan taught me that.
He's a prodigious man, a great man really.
How come you're not with him now?
You kill people in battle-- they love you for it.
Make a mistake with a couple of boys-- they treat you like a leper.
You all right there, Princess.
Feeling the 'shrooms-s-s-s?
Ah, Hakan's not the man he was.
Not a man at all really.
You see, we're-- we're all this, but he-- he's all that up there, all around us.
Do you think he is just gonna pack up and follow you, rule the people that banished him?
Why would he even speak to you, look at you?
He already knows you're coming.
Then he won't mind... if you tell us where he is.
But if I do that, you're going to die.
Well, everybody has to die.
Oh.
Oh, fuck it, Princess,
i'll do better than tell you where he is.
I'll take you there myself.
Why the Hell not?
Why the fucking Hell not, hmm?
Ah.
Helps you see through the clouds, to find the sun.
- Is it magic?
- No such thing as magic.
It's inscribed.?
Yeah. Who taught you to read?
I was at a monastery.
They taught me... many things.
Here, here you go.
Have this.
You blow it.
Boneless says there's a runestone two days from here at the edge of a forest at the foot of the western mountains.
Says he'll take us there and the runes will lead us to Hakan.
- And you trust him?
- Why not?
- Because he's a maniac.
- Oh yeah, that he is.
But he's our maniac now.
Vali!
First the sun, and now the ashes painted red.
Vali!
Vali!
- Steinar.
- Vali.
- Steinar.
- Are you all right?
What happened here?
What happened?
Men came.
Last night.
I heard voices.
I thought it was you.
How come there's not a scratch on you?
It's another omen.
We should turn back.
The Gods are against us.
Who did this?
Thieves?
Thieves would have taken all the horses.
Someone trying to fuck with you.
You wanna fuck with us?
Come on.
Come on!
Ivar, how long will it take us to get there on foot?
Depends how determined you are.
Determined.
We should wait for the Moon to guide us.
Shut your mouth about the fucking Moon.
Listen.
Vali, you two, wait here.
Fuck this.
Let's fight!
Grim!
Argh!
Fuck.
Steinar!
Arghh!
We should go after them, finish them off.
We move on.
I told you to wait.
I'm not a child, Steinar.
Go and get the girl.
Now.
Steinar!
Steinar!
He died a good death, with his axe in his hand.
Valhalla won't know what hit them.
There's a clear view on the hill.
Vali, get up there, shout if you see anything.
How's Ivar?
Nearly done.
We need to move on as soon as we can.
We have to reach Hakan.
They were no ordinary Saxons.
They were too well armed, too well trained.
They didn't just run into us.
You think we're being hunted?
If Harald made an alliance with their King, then getting rid of me would be part of the deal.
They'd need to know where to look for you.
Maybe someone's helping them.
Don't tell me you believe in all that crap about Moons and omens.
I believe what I see with my own eyes.
Right.
Here.
Vali dropped it.
Look at the markings.
It's a saxon coin.
You think vali is a servant of our enemies?
If he serves Harald, who himself serves the Saxons, it amounts to the same thing.
All from a piece of silver?
He's my brother.
Half brother.
His mother's a Saxon.
- Listen to yourself.
- You say you believe in reason and logic.
When it's presented to you, you turn your back on it.
In what way do my actions betray a lack of reason?
You run when you should fight.
You set off on this meaningless quest when you should be leading your people.
And then you side with a bastard traitor who would stick a knife in your back, rather than your oldest friend.
What would you have me do, huh?
Hmm? Kill him?
Better if you did.
He's a child.
Think about that.
Think about your two daughters.
Dark times call for dark deeds, Steinar.
You're wrong, hagen.
They call for light.
Steinar!
Come on.
Hurry up!
- We can't outrun them!
- I'll slow them down!
Damn.
What do they call you?
Come on, you must have a name.
Go fuck yourself.
That's disappointing.
I had expected more from a prince.
Whatever deal you struck with my brother, it won't last.
Brother.
Right now we're in a position where we can help each other.
I could help make sure you become King of your people.
We could forge a real alliance that could last generations.
- Under the shadow of the cross?
- Under the protection of a benevolent King and a church that would encourage education and learning.
Well, I can see the benefits in education and learning,
but when you start talking about your God, reason doesn't really come into it, does it?
Think about it.
Come on, just a sip.
Cut my ropes.
Watch out!
Stab him again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
You all right?
What about him?
Didn't like being tied up.
Took one of the guard's ears off.
Where's vali?
He went with them to meet their holy men and bow down before the white Christ.
Keep him alive.
We need him to tell us where we're going.
- I'm not leaving without vali.
- Look, Steinar.
He denied the existence of the Gods.
He begged to be converted.
Let the boy go.
You dare break the sanctity of the House of God?
You talk of reason.
When it comes down to it,
you're just as superstitious as the rest of them.
Now lay down your weapons and let the boy go.
Oh, we will hunt you down and kill you like the godless animals you are.
You go to such lengths to build these churches, making sure they strike terror into the hearts of all who come near.
It's just a room with a door... no different to a prison.
Steinar!
Secure them inside!
Get in!
Do we have what we need to find Hakan?
You were true to your word.
Remember me to him, prince.
When you see him, his eyes pierce the soul.
He knows who you truly are, hmm?
Like a God... sees men.
You believe in the Gods, don't you, hmm?
You believe in...
Valhalla?
Yeah.
Oh.
Valhalla, I'm coming.
Shh shh.
Whose was this?
- It belonged to my mother.
- What happened to her?
She was swallowed up into the darkness.
Like everything else.
- Are you finished?
- The boy.
- What about him?
- He went willingly, prepared to accept the white Christ.
It was that or death.
You didn't yield and neither did we.
And I won't now.
Vali has brought us nothing but bad luck.
If we offer him up as a sacrifice, the Gods will look over us for the rest of our journey.
It's worth it to safeguard the future of our people.
So long as there's men who think like you, our people have no future.
He's a traitor and a coward.
And he deserves to die.
- Step aside, Steinar.
- Don't make me do this.
Then you leave me no choice.
Yield!
No!
No!
What about the people in the church?
Wait.
No, we shouldn't touch it.
I'm telling you, this isn't just somebody's head on a stick.
This is a sign.
This is telling us to stay the fuck away.
Well, what is it?
It's a runestone.
This is what Ivar was leading us to.
This isn't good, Steinar, I'm telling you.
To find Hakan, we had to find this first.
What does it say?
This isn't telling us how to find Hakan.
It's a warning, saying what will happen if we try.
Well, what does it mean?
It means we're close, nothing more, nothing less.
I can't go in there, Steinar.
I just can't.
- Nothing to fear, Jokul.
- I know these things.
If I step foot in that forest, I'm dead.
You'll be dead if you don't.
Jokul.
Agnes!
You're not dead...
Not yet anyway.
You want to know why you're not dead?
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Because he chose it.
He decides who lives, who dies.
Who are you, huh?
I am
Ulric the chronicler... a humble servant of the great master.
Well, Ulric, if you wouldn't mind telling the great master that his brother's here to see him.
He has no brother, no father, no mother.
I'll tell him what you said though.
It might amuse him.
Vali?
Vali, untie me.
Vali, where's Agnes?
Where's Jokul?
Vali?
You're a long way from home, Steinar.
So is he.
This is his home.
Our father's dying.
What do you see... when you think of home?
I think of the... the blue of the sky,
the green of the forest.
The smell of the pine trees.
I see nothing.
Nothing... but darkness.
Why have you come here?
Our father sent me.
He sent me to bring you back... to lead your people as King.
You don't know what you ask, but you will.
Let the feast begin!
Friends,
- this is a momentous day.
- Yeah!
This is a truly momentous occasion.
Commence the festivities!
The people I arrived with-- what happened to them?
Hey, how old were you when Hakan left?
Were you never curious as to why?
I always loved you.
I never wanted us to be separated.
No mother would ever wish for such a thing.
But that's all going to change now.
Now is the time for the world
to bow down before his might.
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!
All men will bow down before him.
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!
Bow down before the King!
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!
Bow before him.
Kneel before your King.
Do you deny him?
I deny him.
You dare question your King.
You dare question your God.
Now your questions will be answered through his immortality...
...and your destruction.
Steinar.
Steinar.
Well, where's Hakan?
He was sent to find his brother and he returns with his head in a bag.
He was sent to find the King.
Looks like he found one.
How many people do we have in camp?
How many more could we muster by the morning?
A few hundred more.
And how far away is the saxon army?
No more than a day's ride.
Good.
We leave at first light.
Open your mouth.
Swallow it!
How did they do that?
Cool! How did she do that?
Can you see any strings?
Ohh!
Hey, listen, Dad's got to go to his meeting now.
Can you pass it on to Mum?
But we haven't had the cake yet.
No, I know. Look, I've got to pay the bills, haven't I?
Ew, ew.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
I can't do it.
He can't do it.
He can't do it.
He can't do it.
Tom's too shy to tell her, Dad.
OK, don't worry about it.
I'll see you later, OK?
See ya.
- If it was real Aussie blood...
- That's Dad. Hang on, hang on.
Where are you?
I'm just turning onto the Eastern.
The traffic's crazy.
Don't forget the sparklers.
They're on the bench beside the water bottles.
Alright.
Yeah, I just didn't see you leave.
Oh. Mr. Blonden was about to be cut in two. It was a tense moment.
- OK, make a wish, honey.
I wish that the Ravens would win tomorrow!
A man equally at home designing the award-winning
Gordon Institute of New Technology as he is with the exquisite restoration of this iconic Victorian building.
Mr. Premier, ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Professor David Hagen.
We took out the hydrangeas.
Apparently they're the ex-wife's favourite flower.
She had good taste.
And the bride's allergic to lilies.
We'll just have to make sure there's some tissues handy, won't we?
What time are the photographers coming?
Midday. And is this how you want the orchids?
Almost.
Needs a lot more hyacinth, though.
- We'll get onto it right away.
- Gotta go.
OK. Go, the Ravens.
- Looks beautiful!
- Thank you.
That's it, keep going.
That's it.
- Come on, Ravens!
- Good kick. Well played.
Spread around, boys.
Pass it.
- Good kick, son. Well played.
- Go for it!
Jack, get in there. Get in there!
Hang on. Free kick, free kick.
That's OK, Jack.
Come on, back in the game.
OK, let's go.
Spread around, defence.
Spread around, spread around.
Play on.
- Right, play on.
- You're OK, you're OK.
No problem.
Keep going, keep going.
I said play on.
Free kick now. 
Hang on a minute. You alright?
Shame Linda's not here for this one.
Er, Marissa, um, this man's pooped before half-time.
- Yeah, I noticed. You alright, mate?
- Yeah.
You know what? I'm just gonna drop him in to Doc Reid.
We'll see you Tuesday practice.
- Take care.
- Come on, mate.
We try to achieve maximum formal impact with complete unity.
The new addition of the memorial hall at Broughton Park demonstrates Harvey's contemporary forms...
Dad, we're home.
Ah, you did the shopping already. Good.
Dr. Reid took some blood and stuck my name on it!
Yeah, you were really brave, sweetie.
Then the ladies took it in to a psychopath.
Pathologist, I suspect.
You do look a bit zonked.
Pussy, eh? Come on.
- What's that all about?
- He just got tired at soccer.
Doc Reid said he should be fine.
They just did some blood tests to be sure.
I didn't know you'd be working.
- Yep, sorry. Um, I got to take this.
- What time's your plane?
- I've got to leave in half an hour.
- Alright.
Hi.
Holy shit!
Don't swear or blaspheme, mister.
There's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Should we hurry down to the cellar?
Hey, don't interrupt him, Jack.
He's working.
Dad, there's a comet. Dad!
- You've gotta look at this thing!
- Sorry, just a sec.
Jack, you're supposed to knock, please.
But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Yeah. Due to go past in about 2126, I think.
Now, can I finish this, please?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Sorry.
- Off you go.
So the termite guy might swing by this afternoon.
Recycling's tomorrow night.
Don't forget, please.
Yeah, I know. But they reckon that's what killed the dinosaurs.
- What, recycling or the termite guy?
- A comet like Swift-Tuttle!
- Here. You always forget this.
- Oh!
- Staying in the same place?
- Yeah, usual.
- I'll bring you back a shower cap.
- And I'll have a marmalade.
It's gonna miss us by 15 million miles.
I think we'll be alright.
You don't even like marmalade.
Is this a new thing
I need to know about, huh?
- I love you.
- I'll make you that for breakfast.
- Travel safe, honey.
- See ya!
All the combined armed forces designed a weapon that would be fired at Swift-Tuttle just at the right time.
Hi.
Oh, hello, Dr. Reid.
Sure. Yeah, yeah, I'll bring him in this afternoon.
As it got closer and closer, the scientists couldn't agree where the comet was going to hit, and if Swift-Tuttle hits us, there'll only be a crater instead of this 'orrible 'ospital!
"Horrible hospital."
Mum, how long do we have to stay here?
Just be one second, darl.
Jack's white cell count certainly is abnormally high.
We should admit him, keep an eye on him.
There's a lot of reasons, aren't there, for a high white cell count?
Maybe he's just been overdoing it.
We're going to do further tests, of course.
We can ascertain what the problem is and then we'll treat him. OK?
- You alright, buddy?
- Yeah.
Almost there.
Atlantis Station.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
He'll sleep for a while.
There you go, buddy.
It's your birthday!
Gonna party like it's your birthday!
Drink Ribena like it's your birthday!
Come on, now, it's your birthday!
Come on, pick up, for God sakes.
Professor David Hagen.
I'm sorry I can't take your call.
Please leave a message after the tone.
David, it's me. Call me. It's urgent.
David Hagen, please.
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
So am I, my friend.
Why don't you hire a truck, you git?
If you got out of your motor car, that would help, not sitting there sounding your horn, please.
Why don't you go back to China?
I Korean, you stupid round-eyed Tasmanian.
Now, let's not be starting
World War III, fellas.
Thank you.
Now, see what we can achieve when we all work together? Eh?
This is the Park Royal, isn't it?
Well... No, just check again.
Professor David Hagen. H-A-G-E-N.
No.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ho-ho, there he is!
The boatswain's mate, always ready to pipe the captain aboard.
- Dad, you've finished it!
- I was up all night with the frame.
The Australian climate plays havoc with the planks.
Give me the icy waters of the Solent any day.
Right, let's get cracking.
Down you go.
Yeah.
Right.
Put this here.
Wow! It's orgasmic.
'Orgasmic', you say.
And what would that mean, exactly?
Uh, it's something about food with no bug spray.
That would be 'organic'.
Oh. What's this sailor's name?
He must have just arrived.
I reckon she could spare us a jib.
Ahoy there!
How would it be if I trade you my coat?
'Cause sailing away is all those sheets are good for.
Sorry, wool makes me itch.
Ne'er you mind.
Right. Crew in place.
Steer ship to starboard.
We'll be underpowered for the moment.
Ah! There on the horizon.
Can you see the magical islands rising for the night?
But be sharp, boy. They're likely to vanish in the blink of an eye.
Hear me now, dawn spirits of the east.
Join us, if you will. Your magic is most welcome and wanted here.
Is the father sick too, Mummy?
He's just praying, darling.
Go back to sleep.
I'll get us our own room in the morning.
Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night.
Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night.
- Just meet him there.
- Yeah, thanks for that.
He's turning the ward into a coven.
Yes, I agree about the candles.
But we can't conjure up beds we don't have.
There's got to be a single room somewhere.
We pay top cover for this.
- Milk run?
- Mm-hm.
- I'll go.
- No, I'll do it.
No, I'll go. You've done enough shopping for this relationship.
Why didn't you get the bed by the window?.
It's nearer to the loo.
If you're on Gleevec, you have to piss all the time.
What sort of leukaemia do you have?
Leukaemia? I don't think I've got that.
They haven't told you?
You're in a cancer ward.
I am? Well, maybe I've just got a bit of leukaemia.
Well, there's bad leukaemia and there's really bad leukaemia.
That's all.
I used to have the really bad one, but they fixed it.
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?
Have I got leukaemia?
Yeah, you have, but they're really good at fixing it here.
They did say he's a good age for treatment.
A good age?
Where were you, David?
I was calling your phone all weekend.
Park Royal told me you weren't even registered there.
I know, I'm sorry. There was a mix-up with the reservation.
I had to go somewhere else.
I just really needed you here.
- I know.
- Dad?
- Dad.
- Hello, mister.
I can't leave you alone for a minute, can l?
Bone marrow transplants used to be a last resort, but with high-risk children, we're finding that transplants - after the initial chemo - are mainly giving positive results.
'High risk'? But my wife just said that he was at a good age.
The T cell's a strange fellow.
It makes Jack's treatment more tricky.
Where are all these amazing breakthroughs we keep hearing about?
Stem cell work?
Look, I'd say Jack's got a better than even chance of responding well to chemotherapy alone.
And with bone marrow transplant, much better odds.
Anything less is too risky.
"Even chance"?
If there's a sibling whose marrow matched, makes the odds much better.
- I'm ordering a lumbar puncture.
- OK.
It'll give us a clearer idea of where we stand.
OK.
He was such a robust baby. I wonder...
Well, I mean, all those paint strippers and flaking paint he used to roll in.
- Hey. I've gotta move the car.
- Come on, boys.
One at a time. Remember where we are.
No, no, kids.
You can't just walk in there.
We have to come sterilise your hands, OK?
Jack's been diagnosed with leukaemia.
No. It's because she stopped buying red meat.
He just needs to eat some liver.
No, not anaemia.
I said... I said 'leukaemia'.
Oh, yeah. He'll be back playing with all of you in no time.
- That's great.
- That's awesome.
That's Finn over there.
He sailed out here on a yacht from Ireland.
- Oh!
- By himself?
Yeah! After pirates killed the rest of the crew.
Where have you put my cherub?
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello, darling.
Awww. Mwah!
Alright, boys.
Thanks so much for visiting.
Bye, Jack.
- We'll see you all soon, OK?
- OK. See ya!
- Sarah, I'll call you.
- Come on, boys. Bye, Jack.
Is it lemonade, Gran Cleo?
Oh, no, dear.
It's from Mrs. Bland up the street.
- Is it fizzy?
- It's holy water.
I'll go and get my cherub some lemonade.
Coffees for you and me?
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
Oh, my!
Is that a model of one of the nurses?
Oh, no. My dad's making me a figurehead.
It looks a bit like my mum before she died.
We're going on a sailing trip to some magical islands.
Her name's Asiram.
She'll be at the head of our vessel.
Indeed she is! Oh! Hello.
- Oh, hi.
- Right. Here we go!
I used to be in the Girl Guides.
- Were you indeed?
- Mmm.
Then you would know that the bowline is the best knot for mooring.
I would.
Right.
Finally, let's plug this boy in, turn her on...
Oh!
And there she blows.
That's cool.
Oh-ho-ho, at last! A southerly to start us on our journey.
Oh! Whoa!
- There's a boat!
- This is awesome!
- Go on.
- Lash it in.
Keep it going!
- Whoo!
- Keep going. She's tacking.
She's tacking. Keep pushing.
- Aha!
- Goin' great.
She's tacking! She's tacking.
There she goes.
Come see our ship over the ocean!
Oh!
Starboard. Starboard. Keep going.
Hi, Jack. Hi, Finn.
Can we please have a go?
- Wait, wait! I'm next.
- Westward ho!
How cool is this?
- Ready, Jack?
- Let's go! Oh!
Hello! That's it. Come on, boys.
Whoa-ho!
That's it! Come on, boys.
There she blows.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Pull, pull, pull, pull to starboard.
- Hey, hey! She's flying.
- Oh, this is so cool.
Ho-ho! Go on. Ho-ho!
Watch that shark. Hey! Keep going!
And because of the comet zapper,
Swift-Tuttle was banished to space forever!
That's a beautiful story, darling.
The last bit's on the other card.
It's one of Dad's you got?
I only took it out of his 'Ready to Use' tray.
It's alright. It's OK.
This is the best bit.
And because the kid saved the world,
Pizza Hut gave him
10 million dessert coupons.
The end, Episode 1.
Ta-da!
- Oh! Such an imagination.
- You liked it?
- Dad! It's a comet.
- Yeah.
- There you are again.
- Come look at this!
You're supposed to knock, please.
But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Yeah. Due to go past in about 2126, I think.
- Can I finish this, please?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Sorry.
Off you go.
No, not yet... I just...
I've got to work out the best time.
I know, I know.
Veronica, I'm leaving her.
Well, for all his airs and fancy lacework,
I thought at the very least he was a decent man.
Back in a minute, darling.
- Yep.
- I'll hold the fort here.
If you ever cheat on a girl,
I'll kill you.
OK?
Huh?
- Sorry.
- Off you go.
No, not yet... I just...
I've got to work out the best time.
I know, I know.
Veronica, I'm leaving her, OK?
I am leaving her. I...
And to be perfectly honest,
I don't think she'll even notice.
Jack's the only thing that matters to her.
- Alright.
- You OK there, Jack?
Nice curving the back there for me, and if you could just push that shoulder up.
Good boy. Nice slow breaths.
- Then we'll do the mouth.
- OK.
- And in...two...
- That's it, sweetie.
- That's it.
- That's a boy. Good boy.
- Almost done. Almost there.
- Good boy.
Just takes a little second or so.
Good boy. That's it. Nice low breaths.
Holy water?
- Is she trying to poison him?
- Put it down. That's not yours.
Who's Veronica?
Is she the one that did your editing when I had pneumonia?
Is it that one?
No idea what you're talking about.
How long you been planning it?
Planning what?
Planning to leave us for her. How long?
Marissa, I'm not planning to leave you for...
You knew Jack was sick and you just went off to be with her?
Listen to me.
If you've listened to something out of context, then I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I'm not leaving you for anyone, alright? I'm staying.
Stay for Jack. He needs you.
- Yes. It's a gale.
- Very good.
- This one?
- Um... 5, fresh breeze?
No. Look closely at the crests.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Nothing to do with you, kiddo.
I did it all by myself, OK?
That's a boy.
Hi.
- Hi, Mum.
- I better go, OK?
I'll see you later. I love you.
I'll head off, OK?
Yeah.
And that's...that's, er, 11.
- A violent storm.
- Violent storm. Yeah.
Ahoy there.
Head sharp aft, right over left, left over right.
Send up a flare if you need some help.
Radar problem detected.
Will investigate.
Think about it, Connor - playing cat's cradle isn't going to help our kids make it round Cape Horn.
Well, that may well be, but there's a lot more to treating this vile disease than medicine.
And I won't have you telling me that Irish linen is a problem for you as well.
Come on.
Take it.
I'll teach you how to sail to the magical islands of the Bean Fionn.
They say that a child blessed with a kiss from the Fianna is indestructible.
Do you believe this stuff, really?
- Mm-hm.
- You do?
Mmm.
And what about Finn?
Do you think it's right for him to believe this - that he's setting sail for some mystical island?
All this incredible ritual for nothing?
For nothing? No! More so for everything.
When the spirit dies, so does the flesh.
That won't be happening to my boy Finn.
Every human being on earth has two of these - these antigens, these sets, coded so.
OK, now, look, don't feel embarrassed about asking questions.
Just ask any question you have to ask.
So I'll try and get you through it.
We've got the HLA-A. That's crucial.
That has 24 antigen sites.
The HLA-B has 52 antigen sites.
Don't be confused by the numbers...
HLA-DR...
20 antigens...
We can exclude it...
We're looking for a sibling...
We've got a 25% chance for a match with a donor...
We need a blood test, the bone marrow test...
We need the genetic test...
The unknown...
That's the combination...
Now, what is crucial is that the immune system will kill any cells with different markers...
Because what are we looking for?
That's it.
We're looking for a...
That mixes...
This is what we've got...
Unfortunately, you have the rare antigens.
Ah, David. Quite rare.
OK, doesn't put us in a pickle because...
OK.
How many other women are there?
I'm sorry.
I've been seeing someone else.
I have been.
I've been having an affair.
And what about all those women in all those houses you worked on?
Huh?
All those times they called the house and you said there was nothing going on except in my rabid imagination.
Marissa, please, don't do this!
- All those times you went interstate?
- Stop it.
How do you know you don't have other children?
- How do you know you don't have...
- I don't have other children!
- Look, stop it!
- How do you know that?
This isn't the place to talk about this.
We'll talk about this at home.
Marianne, hi.
- Hey, I've got you now!
- Marissa.
Oh, is that... is that Jeremy?
God, is he eight now?.
Who's there?
It's OK, honey.
Oh, I don't even know how to say this but...
.. I've got a serious problem that you might be able to help me with.
I have to go, so...
Is there any chance... that Jeremy could be David's child?
- What? What are you talking about?
- It's OK.
- I already know about the affairs.
- Marianne!
- It's OK.
- Just go, for Christ's sake.
- I don't want you here.
- Because if he is...
Oh! If he is, he could save my child's life.
He's not.
- Thank God.
- I've told you before.
- Do you know that for sure?
- Don't encourage these people!
- She's not selling anything.
- Can you get off my property?
- Yeah, yeah. I was just going.
- Good God!
Marissa Hagen.
Are you looking for your husband?
Well, you're nine years too late.
No, er... my boy's...
No. I'm not fine.
My boy's really sick.
Yeah. Jack.
Listen, um...
Did you have an affair with David in August, 1996?
Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet...
Janet, Janet, I know!
Listen, it doesn't matter to me right now.
- Hey, Marissa.
- I just...
What the hell's happened to my office?
Er, no. It's David.
Um...
You know, Janet, I think you should talk to him about this.
It might be a bit easier.
- What are you doing?
- Janet de Cosi.
I don't want to talk to Janet.
You're crazy.
Listen, Janet, all I need to know...
- Are either of your kids his?
- For God's sake.
Oh, for God's sake! Hang up the phone.
Oh! He wore a condom.
- Gee. How responsible of him.
- Hang up the phone. Hang up.
This is so fucking stupid.
What are you doing?
You have gone out of your mind.
I'm having real problems with these numbers here, you know?.
It's like you called this one number in June over and over and over again.
- I was working with these people.
- Then here at 4:00am?
What were you doing?
Don't you think we need to focus on the main thing at the moment in our lives, which is Jack?
- Oh! Are you talking about Jack?
- Yes, I'm talking about...
You mean Jack who had to listen to his dad talking to some whore on the phone?
Look, I'm sorry...
Is that what you're talking about, while he's laying in bed with leukaemia?
I am sorry he had to listen to that.
I am sorry! I will live with that, OK, for the rest of my life!
I mean, wh...? 
What is this? What is this?!
What is this shit?!
What are we meant to do now?.!
- I understand.
- Get off me!
- I understand what you're...
- Oh, do you understand?
- Yes!
- Oh, really?
Because this is about Jack, OK?
And Jack is what we have to be focusing on now.
What do you think I'm doing?!
Huh?
What do you think I'm doing?!
What do you think I'm doing?!
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
- Calm down.
- Have you seen what I'm doing?!
- I love you.
- Oh!
I love you. I love you.
I'm so sorry. I understand.
Just get off me.
We're done. OK?
Get out of the house.
Fully sick! 
-Ta-da!
-Yay!
- OK, which hat?
- That one.
- This one?
- Yeah!
This one?
§ Ha, ha! §
Hey-hey, Finn. Look.
All finished and ready for the voyage ahead, eh?
- What do you think, boys?
- Cool!
- Yeah. Beautiful.
- She's beautiful.
- Yes. Wow. Cool.
- Awesome. Awesome.
- Alright, boys. Bedtime.
- Come on.
Out, out, out.
Don't let those bedbugs bite.
Er, your boots - are they on the wrong feet?
Ah, yes. You see, it's Thursday.
Eh, Finn?
Finn?
Mr O'Brien, could we have a word, please?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Hi. Have you seen Connor?
Thank you.
Connor?
Connor?
The leukocytes are way up.
They can't control them.
What does that mean?
Don't make me say it.
Oh, God. Connor, I thought he was...
Just leave me alone, will you?
Yeah, OK.
- If there's anything...
- For God's sake, woman!
OK. OK.
Jasmine?
The flowers will make everything OK.
Well, fluids are important.
Argh!
Arrrggghhh!
Finn!
No...
No!
- No!
- OK.
- Go away!
- OK.
Come here, come here. It's OK.
- No.
- It's OK. Come here.
It's OK. Come on. Come on.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK, Finn. It's OK.
It's OK.
I know, I know. It's OK.
It's OK.
- It's OK.
- I don't want to die.
Of course not. Of course not.
I'm scared.
Finn, of course you're scared.
- I'm scared too.
- No.
But you're not dying.
Listen,
I... I think all of us fear stuff that we don't know about.
What I do know is this - that the islands of Bean Fionn are where your dear mother is.
She's waiting there for you.
Now, maybe you'll get better.
Maybe you'll be crook for ages.
Whatever it is, I'm here with you.
We'll do this thing together.
And when the time comes, we'll go to those islands.
And maybe I'll take you.
Or maybe your mummy will take you.
Either way, you'll not be alone.
Do you hear me?
You will not be alone.
Come here.
Come here.
You are a brave, brave soul.
You know you were named after the son of Muirne, head of the Fianna.
And the bravest, the bravest of all...
..was Finn.
It's OK.
It's OK.
I know, son.
I know.
I know. I know.
- Yes?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry. I was just admiring your renovation.
- I mean, your house.
- Oh, thank you.
- My husband, David Hagen, helped you with the heritage issues.
Ah. David?
David, could you go inside, please?
- Now.
- Your son's name is David?
David, inside now.
Yes. I quite like the name.
I have to go.
I have to get him to swimming.
I just want a quick word. My husband was here about 10 years ago.
I can't help noticing that your son appears to be about 9 or 10.
- Is that right?
- What are you doing here?
I even notice that his face is sort of similar to David's.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you want but I'm in a hurry.
My son has leukaemia.
He needs a bone marrow transplant.
- You must be out of your mind.
- Please.
Coming here to my home?
The donor has to have the same antigens as my husband and that means he has to be a sibling.
He's not David's child.
He told me you were unstable.
I'm unstable?
Wait. Wait a minute! Please!
Dad...
.. I can feed myself.
OK.
Can I see you for a minute?
Hey, Finn. Finn!
Guess what me and my dad are doing on Saturday.
We're going to the circus.
They have a special one here for all the kids!
They're gonna have clowns and acrobats.
And they might even have animals.
And a guy who eats fire.
I saw him on the poster yesterday.
Please come, Finn.
It won't be any fun without you.
OK.
Yes!
I'll do room 12.
Oh, OK. Thanks.
Hi there.
Mr. O'Brien.
- Oh, look, I am so sorry about...
- No, don't worry.
And the report says
I accidentally dropped my bowling ball down the stairs and it went through the window.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Bad luck.
Mmm.
- Thanks.
- OK.
Whoa!
Oh!
Ah! My trolley! Oh!
Oh!
Connor!
Jump in!
Oh, hello.
Put her in the back.
Got it?
- She's not gonna fit.
- Tie her on the roof. There's rope.
Right.
Whoa.
Saved by the queen of the waters.
Shut up or I'll crash.
Where to?
My boat's moored down at Williamstown.
Oh, yeah, good.
My shop's down that way.
You've got a boat?
You've got a shop?
I'm going to be very preoccupied for a while.
Yeah, of course.
You should be with Jack.
I mean, we could see each other again once I've got him through this.
OK.
David, I'm pregnant.
Odd, isn't it?
We gave it less thought than two 16-year-olds in the back seat of a car in Albert Park.
You're joking. That's great.
That's great!
Obviously I've thought a lot about this and what with everything going on with Jack and us...
No, no, no, no. You can't... you can't worry about that.
- I don't think we should have the baby.
- Well, let's talk about it.
I don't think there's anything to talk about.
- As parents.
- We never talked about being parents.
A lot of people don't discuss that and that just happens.
David, it's you and me.
It was about us having fun.
- Veronica, please.
- It was never about being parents.
It could be a match for Jack.
- For Jack?
- Yeah.
- Is that what this is about?
- No, that's not what this is about.
What, you want a baby so you can have some spare parts for your sick child?
Oh, that's a disgusting thing to say.
It's my boy's life, OK?
And no, our baby... Come on.
Sweetheart, our baby would be our baby, OK?
It just so happens that he or she might also be a match for my boy.
- I've made up my mind.
- Can we please think about this?
Can you please just go?
Oh, wow.
Oh.
- Amazing.
- Ah.
Gosh.
Mary Hay. A wooden bark of 258 tons.
She went down on Steeple Rock in the fog, didn't you?
- You made all of these.
- No, no. I copied them.
There's no art in that.
Purely for money.
Fortunately, there are people out there with more money than sense.
Oh, she is stunning.
Oh, she's off the square rigger 'Britannia'.
A handsome woman.
Hmm. Certainly ready for the water.
- Careful, careful!
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Let it go.
- You got it?
- I got it.
- OK.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I don't suppose I could interest you in sharing a nice pot of tea.
No. I'll be getting back.
OK.
Er, how are you going to get that on the boat?
That's a good point.
Hello, girls.
The boat felt empty without Finn so I made Nuala here to dine with at supper, then I felt bad about leaving her on her own so much so I made my Fair Midhir.
Oh, they must have some great chats about salt-resistent shampoo.
Hmm.
Listen, you're the first woman aboard that can hold her own cup.
Tea.
Does the boat ever leak?
Oh, all the time.
A constant reminder as to who's the boss.
I think I'm more of a city girl.
Terra firma - much more appealing.
Mummy.
Mummy!
Mum.
Mummy!
Your mum's not here.
And your gran's snoring.
What's the matter?
My... my hands are tingling.
I can't move them.
I wouldn't worry yourself.
It's just a calcium drop.
It happens 'cause of the chemo.
Yeah.
But now it's happening to my feet.
Yeah. It's definitely a calcium drop.
Could I die from calcium drop?
No. And you're definitely not dying now.
You know, people, they... they stop being bossy...
..talk to a kid sort of differently around here 'cause they're gonna die.
Do you know they get their own PlayStation 3?
And first choice of DVDs.
And face it, no-one except your gran is making any special fuss over you.
Finn, is there any way of getting your own PlayStation...
..that's a bit less than dying?
I haven't heard of it.
I've got to go.
I've got a dentist appointment.
- His mummy will be here soon.
- OK.
Jack's X-ray's at 8:00.
I really need to get back.
You'll be able to get a signal at the boatshed.
I can't believe this.
Half an hour for Jack without you is nothing compared to what lies ahead.
Don't say that. They're saying
Jack's chances are really good.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Connor. I shouldn't have...
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
I should get going.
Marissa... remember this - we met only on water.
Now you're back ashore.
Hi. Um, I-I'd like to leave this for Jack Hagen.
- Oh, you can give it to him yourself.
- Oh...
- Jack, there's a delivery for you.
Oh, and your mum called.
She's going to be about half an hour.
Imagine your incredible comet zapper blasting those nasty white blood cells.
Pow! Pow! Pow!
I'm zapping you dumb aliens to make room for red cells!
Ready at last, Jack.
Sorry about the wait, Mrs. Hagen.
No, my mum's Mrs. Hagen.
Oh. Um, gosh, Jack, I've got to fly.
Here. You hold onto that, darling.
And just remember - those nasty white blood cells don't have a chance.
Pow! Pow!
But I won't be zapping only for me.
I think my dad's gonna move in with this lady that's not my mum, and if I die, my mum won't have anyone to help with the shopping or stuff like that.
Bye, Jack.
You OK in there?
No.
Why don't you come out and have some water?
I've got a paper cup.
What's wrong? Is it your child?
It's hopeless. 
I know exactly how you feel.
When I first heard about my Jack, it just...
Um... look, l-I'll leave your water here on the sink.
I'm available to have a chat.
I'm up in Haematology, Room 4.
Marissa Hagen.
Whoaaa!
I nearly missed that one.
Whoa! An apple? 
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Actually, no.
- Settle down. Hey!
Settle down, you two!
Listen, circus starts at 6:00.
Your dad should easily be here by then.
I'll be close by if you need anything.
- OK. Yep.
- Love you.
Watch out. Coming through.
- Have fun, kids. See you later.
- Bye.
- OK. You ready?
- Yeah, I'll wait outside.
Aw, I wish I was going to the circus!
Still want to go?
Uh, yeah.
Do you want me to come with you?
Uh... I want to go with Jack and his dad.
OK. Will do.
- I'll be here to tuck you in.
- OK.
Mmm.
You know, I went to see
Bernadette Saxon today.
Oh, another diary entry?
She and I used to work together and then she had David design their renovation.
Ah.
Anyway, she pretends not to recognise me.
Hello?
Bernadette. Marissa.
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK. It's been a while.
It's been a long time, yeah.
So I said, "Bernadette, any chance those kids of yours are David's?"
Could be.
Well, it depends.
Did he spend any time in Turkana?
It's right up in the north of Kenya.
Here they are.
Say hello to Mrs. Hagen, guys.
Hi.
Oh, no way. Really?
That is unbelievable.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
Our kids will be alright, won't they?
Oh, listen, they'll be fine for an hour or two without us.
In fact, it's good for them.
Yeah, it will.
You've called Veronica Mendelsohn.
I'm sorry I'm not here at present.
O-3.
You finally sunk my ship.
- He's not coming.
- Doesn't look like it.
Hey, Finn. Want to do something really exciting?
Something way better than some stupid circus.
Like what?
Quiet.
Try here.
Oh, we found it!
Yes!
Gotta love that. 
Taxi!
Taxi!
Here we go.
Whoo! Hello, hello, hello.
Hello. Yes, speaking.
No, I'm not far away. What's wrong?
No, no, no. They're with my husband
David. They went to the circus event.
Are you sure? Well, where's David?
Yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can.
They're saying the boys are missing.
They can't find them.
David, where the hell are you?
I hope you're with the boys. Call me.
Alright, come on. Come on.
Veronica, look, we can adopt the baby out, if that's what you want, OK?
Please. If you love me, you'll do this. Please!
Please, will you do this?!
Will you do it?
It's my boy's life!
Will you just please do it?
David, please, the entire building can hear you.
- Is that what you're worried about?
- Yes. At this moment it is.
Look, will you just please be reasonable?
You are so unfair.
How dare you lay this on me?
I don't want a baby! I never did.
Finn? Why didn't you say something?
- I'm so cold.
- Finn, I have to call someone.
I don't know how to make you feel better.
No.
Make a fire.
That'll make me feel better.
What happened? Where are they?
They're OK. They were spotted at Luna Park at about 8:00.
Luna Park?
Apparently they're having a grand old time.
Aye. Down by the bay. Of course.
We've got a car there looking for them.
OK. Well, I'll go. You stay here.
It'll be fine.
- OK, young fella.
- Hi. Are you Jack Hagen?
- Where's your friend?
- In the boat shed. He's really cold.
With his immunity this low, we can't take any risks.
- Temp's tipping 40.
- He's had Panadol.
- He's febrile.
- Yeah.
We're doing a septic work-up now.
We'll get some IV into him, see how it goes.
It'll make him comfortable.
Hopefully bring the temperature down.
It'll be alright.
He's going to be fine, sweetheart.
He's going to be fine, OK?
- How could you forget?
- I crashed the car.
Can you see heaven with a telescope?
Heaven?
With a really powerful telescope, you can see horizons that people on earth can't even imagine.
And kids who were friends, when they die, are they still friends in heaven?
Nobody is sure about that, darling, but yeah, I think so.
Professor.
- Ah, David.
- You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Veronica Mendelsohn came to see me.
Did she?
More than that.
She wanted prenatal diagnosis to test her baby for matching for Jack.
Really?
We've got a pretty simple procedure now.
Right. So you can do it?
We've done it.
She wanted me to tell you that unfortunately it's not a match.
She's got a pretty strong set of antigens there.
- Blew yours right out of the water.
- Right.
- So the search continues.
- Yeah.
Gotta go.
It's showtime, you lucky boy.
I'll be back after I've had my coffee.
Mmm.
Come on.
Who's the PlayStation for?
The child in bed 4.
When he wakes up, it's going to be a big surprise, Jack.
Hi.
Kerry!
Kerry.
Kerry. Where's the bloody plug to the bath?
- Who's she?
- Hi.
Hi. Sorry. Marissa Hagen.
If you're selling something, forget it.
If you're flogging some religion,
I suggest you go next door.
They need guidance.
Is your name Janice Cromby?
I knew it. You've got a summons.
Janice Cromby doesn't live here.
- Hasn't for years.
- Hey, Janice!
Have you got those curtains ready for my mum?
Great timing, Bill. Piss off!
Oh, Mum. He's the nicest boyfriend you've ever had.
Don't treat him like a piece of shit.
She shouldn't, should she?
Do you remember David Hagen?
You met him about 16 years ago.
You were a model doing a shoot for Myer's at the Collins Street Uniting Church.
He was in charge of the restoration.
Apparently you and he had a fling.
What is this? 20 questions?
Look, he fathered my child, who now has leukaemia.
I'm just looking for other kids he may have fathered.
Cool! Like they all might have the same leukaemia?
Doesn't quite work that way.
- We're not complete morons, you know.
- The jury's still out on that.
Go find that bloody plug. Now!
Jeez! Keep your shirt on.
Look, is there any chance she could be David's child?
That's all I want to know.
If I'd thought there was any chance he was the father,
I'd have hit him so hard for child support he'd have been crippled.
OK.
So I'll be coming off the drip, then?
Yes, Finn, you will.
Hi, love of my life. Here you go.
We can go back to the boat and I'll wait.
I don't know if I can live on the boat, son.
The boat shed is very close.
But we lived on the boat before, Dad.
Why can't we now?.
He just needs a nurse that can row.
Or... or sailing.
We could go sailing.
Do you want to go sailing, Jack?
Can l, Mum? Please?
Yeah. Don't see why not.
You're coming home for the weekend anyway.
Yes!
Back on Monday, 9:00am.
Yeah, we can get a lot of telescope built in two whole days.
You know how they say you can learn a language in your sleep?
Well, I often go to sleep listening to your tapes.
You must wake up quite the authority on rising damp.
Yeah! Welcome back, Jack.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Hi, everyone.
Aw. What a nice surprise.
- Thanks for coming out, everyone.
- Nice hat.
Thanks.
- This is for you, Jack.
- Aw.
How sweet! What did you get?
Take off your beanie, Jack.
Whoa!
How'd you go this week, huh?
Did you win?
- Yeah.
- Great!
Now all will know you're aboard.
Crew in place. We'll sit here at anchor until the storm blows through.
At least I won't get seasick.
No, you won't.
Get ready to fall back.
Here we go, Jack. Go across now.
Pull the jib sheet in. Watch the boom.
This is so cool.
Remember to duck.
- This is awesome!
- I know.
Point her a little to windward.
Dad, I know what to do.
Right.
- Go faster?
- Yeah.
Pull on the main sheet.
It came with 50 games.
Which one do you want to play?
Which game's the longest?
Alrighty. Last lucky last.
Last yucky last.
Good job, honey.
Ta.
Are we still building the platform tomorrow, Dad?
The weekend's all yours.
Goodnight, my boy.
Oh, it's so good to see him back in his own bed again.
Yeah, it really is.
OK, I'm gonna hit the road.
I'll be back in the morning.
Finn made some headway with that telescope today.
Why don't you stay?
Really?
Yeah.
Are you OK?
It was for Jack.
You trying to get pregnant?
You know there's only a one-in-three chance of a match with siblings.
It's better than the billion-to-one we have right now.
- Mummy!
- Sweetie! I'm coming, I'm coming.
Mummy! 
It's leukaemia! I can smell it!
No, it's OK. Hey, hey.
- Why won't it stop?
- Shh, just give me a look.
- It's alright, it's alright.
- Hey, listen. Look at me, darling.
- It's just a nosebleed.
- Take your hand...
- Here, buster. Here you go.
- That's it - pressure.
- Just put pressure on it.
- I'll call the hospital.
OK, breathe through your mouth slowly.
§ If you've got a tad too much blood
§ And your name is nothing like Kevin Rudd
§ Then you'd better squirt some of it out
§ Whoo! On the sheets, on the road
§ Out the front door till your neighbours are covered in red

§ Till your neighbours are covered in red. §
Aahhh!
Oh, that's great.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Thanks.
Nasty shock, that one, eh?
Look, it was a reaction to the cyclophosphamide. Rarely happens.
But mind you, a slight change in air pressure can bring on these bleeds.
- You right, champ?
- Mm-hm.
Good boy.
Stay tight.
God.
Your hands are so cold, son.
Please don't take me back to the hospital.
Please, Dad. Please.
A hospital would make no difference.
Really. It wouldn't.
Now, who can I call?
(WEAKLY) Can you build...
..another...
Can you build... another castle...
..for tonight?
So Mum...
..so Mum will know we’re home.
Of course, son.
Of course.
What do you need?
It's a south day.
Jasmine will taste no good at all.
I'm here for you.
Mum.
Mummy.
Is that you?
Darling, it's Marissa.
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
- We talked about this. I don't...
- I want to be with Finn!
I'll be in the car.
Does... does it hurt?
No.
I... I just feel very sleepy.
Listen.
Jack...
I want you to have my PlayStation.
No, Finn.
You keep it.
You're going to get better.
And... and I'll come over and play it with you.
Whenever you want.
Really.
You can have it.
But you've got to do something for me, though.
But you have to promise.
I promise.
Look... look after my dad...
..for me.
He's...
He's gonna miss me, OK?
You have to help him.
OK?
OK.
OK.
I want to stay awake until she comes.
Shh.
Imagine you're riding the waves with Fungie.
Not now.
It's almost...
She's here.
You'll be at home on those fairy islands.
My boy.
My boy.
I shouldn't have taken him to Luna Park.
You gave him his last big adventure.
But maybe that was too much for him.
No, no. Listen, mate.
The doctors had already taken
Finn off his medication.
They knew he was dying.
I miss him already.
I know you do. I know you do.
Finn must have been needed for something really special someplace else.
Come on, sweet boy.
Time for your bed.
No! No!
No!
I just watched a little boy die.
It doesn't have to be that way with Jack. We know what can save him.
There's no-one on the register with an exact match.
Goddamn elitist antigens.
Look, a full match might surface, but it's more likely we'll find a partial.
- Those are often successful, right?
- Yeah, in 60% of cases.
I'll tell you right now.
If it was my child, I'd opt for a transplant with a partial match.
Because this disease is progressing, and I mean progressing.
- Hi. Are you Madeline Gardener?
- No.
That's Madeline Gardener over there.
Hi, Madeline? I'm Marissa Hagen.
Hi!
You said your husband was in Johannesburg from March till October that same year.
What does your husband look like?
Oh, God. Um... he's my height.
He sort of has strong features, like your daughter.
Wow.
This is amazing.
So, I mean... What are you saying?
I might be right, then?
Oh, no. I don't think so.
See, Anton impregnated my sister so that we could have a child.
I had a hysterectomy when I was, like, 16.
It was in all the papers.
- Hey, do you want something to eat?
- No.
I mean, this is fascinating.
Claudia, hi. It's Marissa Hagen.
Yeah, could be better, you know.
Look, Claudia, I know this is a weird question...
- Yes?
- I'm not doing a survey.
I'm not selling anything.
I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.
I'm just a mother and...
.. I'd really like to ask you something, if that's OK.
I really need to know what you want.
My boy has leukaemia and I'm just looking for bone marrow donors.
Uh... are you going door to door?
No. Not every door.
Well, what brings you to my door?
I believe you had an affair with my husband in 2000.
Goodbye.
Listen! Just, please, just give me a second!
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no! That was an accident!
- Jessie, Nathan, get to your rooms.
It was an accident!
Hi, Jessie. Hi, Nathan.
- Hey, Jessie, how old are you?
- I'm nine.
Jessie, get to your room now!
Listen to me, OK? My boy is dying.
Alright? Do you understand?
If you slept with my husband, she could have matching bone marrow.
It's a very simple procedure for her.
She doesn't even eat meat!
He was here for months renovating this house in 2000. Come on!
We bought this house in 2002.
- Aren't you Angela Lewis?
- Angela Lewis?
- Angela and Grant Lewis! I mean...
- Grant Lewis?
We bought this house from him.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry, kids. Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
When will you be back?
When Ireland's had enough of me.
Fair Midhir.
Always the bridesmaid.
Don't despair.
Your time will come.
I was wondering how you'd been.
Not really very good, Marissa.
Not good at all.
And Jack?
Struggling.
We still can't find a bone marrow match, so...
I hope you do.
You look after yourself, OK?
Thanks.
Not flathead. Flat bread.
- Hello.
- Hi.
She runs her 'B's into her 'R's like 'H's.
The bakery's three aisles left.
Thank you.
I was gonna call you
'cause I wanted to thank you...
..for...taking the test.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
My termination's on Saturday night.
Saturday night? Wouldn't have thought they'd be open on...
Yeah. It's a niche market for women who work.
You'd be a great mum.
- Would it help...
- No.
No?
Do you want me to take you?
It's not a date, David.
OK.
Are you Jack?
That's what they call me.
I'm Kerry.
Hi.
I'm your sister.
Ugh. I am not taking you to the movies!
- Jeez.
- Sister?
I don't have a sister.
Well, you do now.
How could you be my sister?
You serious?
Well...
..your dad bonked my mum, I guess.
Huh?
Oops. Whoa.
Look, I may be able to help you.
§ I wish I was in Carrickfergus

Hi. Thanks for coming in.
Yeah, look, I've just got to say that I'm still not happy about this.
Mum, put a sock in it.
- I'm going to see Jack.
- OK. He's with his dad.
Dad, how are you going to live by yourself?
- You can't cook or anything.
- What do you mean, I can't cook?
I can cook.
You've had my paella many times.
Twice. And the second time,
I got the trots.
Hey. Can I come in?
- Hey. Sure.
- Hi, Kerry.
Hi, Dad. Um, Mum wants to see you.
Um...
Listen, Kerry,
I'd really rather you didn't...
Call you 'Dad'? Yeah.
What about 'Pops' or 'Dadda'?
Oh, 'David' is probably fine.
OK, Pops.
How are you feeling?
- Shithouse.
- Hmm.
But everyone gets really worried if I'm not OK.
You know, they tested my marshmallow.
Marshmallow?.
Bone marrow, marshmallow.
I don't think she should do this.
The risks are really minimal, Janice.
Oh, thanks for your concern, David.
I understand you've got reservations and this is a big thing for an adult to do, let alone a child.
Yeah, but look, the procedure, it's very straightforward.
It's like giving blood.
They harvest the bone marrow and they return the blood.
I know what the procedure is.
How are we all?
Good, thanks.
- Ready to do this?
- Yeah.
You'll be right, mate.
I guess kids, they're just so resilient.
So, folks, young Kerry here's undergone the tests to determine if she's a match for Jack.
And they have HLA compatibility of 6/6 markers, which is pretty much as close as you can get.
So we have a match.
Congratulations.
Come see me when you're ready.
Kerry's a match, honey.
Cool.
That's very cool.
- Very cool.
- Are you sure you want to do this?
Mum.
You're 15, Kez. You need my consent.
And his, apparently.
- Oh, I don't think...
- Of course you don't. You never did.
Please, Janice.
He's a really sick boy. I need you to...
Please, I can see.
I've always wanted a brother.
- First I've heard.
- Mum, Jesus, stop it.
Will you just... will you just nod your head?
Like this.
Mum, I really, really want to do this.
Please.
OK.
OK.
Where do I sign?
Um, I guess with the professor.
Thank you, Janice.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh...
You're going to be OK.
That's it! That's it!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
He's going to... 
Yeah! 
Yes!
Connor?
When did you get back?
A couple of days ago.
I, um... I went down to your shop.
Yeah, I haven't been in.
But you're OK?
I wanted to call.
I just... I didn't know where.
It's fine.
And Jack?
He's fine.
- He just came first in a race.
- What?
You didn't see him. I was screaming.
He wanted a boat.
Well, l, um...
I should go and see him, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, no, he'd love that.
- Help him de-rig.
Have you eaten?
Eaten? It's 5 o'clock.
Yes, but it's Saturday.
You... It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Ready, and... it'll come. Let it down.
All the way. That's it. Good.
Here it comes.
- Here it comes. Perfect!
- Whoo!
Great. And the jib. Lift that.
- Ready?
- Yep.
Come on down.
Keep pulling. Keep pulling.
- Well done. Rudder.
- Yep.
- Yeah.
- OK. Let's unclip it.
§ Come, let me feel your energy
I've got thoughts in my head... §
- One, two, three.
- That's easy.
- Good man.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'll leave that to you.
- Yep.
Show your mum you can do the clip.

People say I'm sending Sebastian and Nina to New York...
...so neither will take my job.
Hey, perhaps that's partly true.
Like these butterflies that surround us this evening...
...it's a time of transformation, new beginnings.
In preparing to open a new office...
...I wanted to place my very best people in charge of it.
And you truly are my best.
Oh.
To Sebastian and Nina. A toast.
- Nina and Sebastian.
- Thank you.
Make us proud in New York.
And make us a lot of money in New York.
After dinner, we went to some restaurant.
And then someone came up and said...
Hello?
- Is this Nina Wei?
- Yes.
I'm calling from
Pu Tuo Qu Hongkang Hospital.
What's going on?
Sophia Liao is in a coma in our hospital.
What?
- What?
- I'm sorry.
Ms. Liao was on her bike and was hit by a taxi.
God.
Yours was the last number dialed on her phone.
She called me?
God.
Okay, I'm coming.
Oh, sorry.
Where is she?
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
How did we end up here?
You went away.
There is so much distance between us.
What happened to the promises we made?
What's going on here?
Nina!
Please don't bring this music into my house.
And these buns you always bring.
Look how oily they are.
Sophia.
When your mother died,
I promised her I'd raise you properly.
When you act out,
I can't fulfill your mother's final wish.
I know I'm only your stepmother.
Are you going to be against me forever?
Huh?
Nina, I'd like to have a word with you.
Follow me.
That liar. She never met my mother.
This is good music.
Come.
I'll find someone else to tutor her in Mandarin.
Do not come here again.
A smart girl like you...
...with a bright future...
...shouldn't have to spend all your time with her.
Come and meet my family for dinner.
This is so exciting.
I never get to visit a real family.
Here's the soup.
Ah. It smells wonderful, Mrs. Wei.
Thank you, Sophia. It's all homemade.
So your family is Korean, right?
Mom.
I already told you they come from Korea.
I didn't come to Shanghai till I was 14.
That's why my Chinese is so bad.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Shanghai is a seaport.
Everyone from somewhere else.
People come and they go, come and they go.
Enough of this silly English.
Nina. Nina.
- Mrs. Liao's not at home.
- Hey, it's you.
So my niece told me Cixi Tai Hou busted you for the Faye Wong tape, huh?
All I know
Teresa, huh?
Oh, what's this? These are so tiny.
These are not easy to come by.
This shoe was for women with tiny bound feet.
See? Called...
...3- inch golden lilies.
It's a shoe?
Do you know our family came from Hunan?
Oh, no.
She's talking about my mother's mother's mother's mother.
- I think I got that right, huh?
- Mm-hm.
And her name was Snow Flower...
...and she had a laotong named Lily.
Laotong?
Sworn sisters for life, laotong.
Like us.
- Sister.
- Sister.
- Sister.
- Sister. Ha, ha.
Girls, you have a lot to learn about laotong commitment.
See, marriages used to be made for men's reasons.
To form business alliances, to manage households, to produce sons.
And they were obligatory.
A laotong's commitment was for women's reasons, by choice.
For companionship, understanding and happiness.
What you're signing today is a symbol of your deep-hearted love for each other.
Deep-hearted love. I like that.
Here is your laotong contract.
Your vow is written in nu shu.
Sign below it.
Oh, yes. The infamous Wong Faye CD.
Sophia's bag is at reception. You can pick it up.
Okay, thank you.
This is the story of Snow Flower and Lily.
Two girls born in the same month, on the same day.
Their feet bound on the same day.
At that moment, their destinies tied forever.
Mama, when can I go out to play?
Lily, this is more important.
We must make your feet perfect so the matchmaker can find you a good husband.
Madam, it is done.
Get up, walk.
Get up!
Walk.
Mama, it hurts.
Ten circles of the room.
Snow Flower! What are you doing?
Come back! Walk!
Only through pain will you find beauty.
Only through suffering will you find peace.
I wrap, I bind.
But you will have the reward.
Come.
Come.
Back, again.
Again.
Mama!
These are the most perfect feet
I have ever seen.
These are true golden lilies.
I will be able to find her a good family.
But given your circumstances...
...we must make another match first.
I have found you a laotong.
Your sister in heart for life.
Her name is Snow Flower, and she is from Tongkou.
Tongkou?
A rich girl is too good for my daughter.
This is true. Her family is privileged.
Her grandfather was an imperial scholar.
But these girls have compatible astrology signs...
...so her mother does not mind this class difference.
Can I meet her now?
Snow Flower?
Nu shu is a secret language between women.
It is personal, between you and your laotong.
That is why you learn it together.
So you will know what is in her heart.
Bright.
Moon.
- Correct?
- Yes.
The Temple of Gupo fair is a holy place.
We are here today in front of Gupo to write your laotong contract.
And make your vows of eternal commitment.
My hand opens to yours.
We of good affection...
...shall never sever our bond.
We will be laotong for all eternity.
Why can't you grow up?
Your mother's right.
You don't get these opportunities every day.
You have to go to New York.
You shouldn't feel guilty.
Her accident had nothing to do with you.
Enough.
Stop trying to convince me.
I've decided to stay.
I don't even know what her life was like these past few months.
Now, with this accident,
I need to find out what happened to her.
Uh, hi, Sebastian. It's Nina.
I'm not sure when I can meet you in New York.
I...
I just can't leave.
I need to be here for Sophia.
Sorry.
I'll be at the house.
Call me when you land.
Bye.
I am to marry a boy I do not know.
He is from a distinguished family.
My life will change because of my perfect feet.
Sister, you must come to my wedding.
Has Madame Wang found you a match,
Snow Flower?
What about bed business?
Mama has never said anything to me.
It cannot be as hard as embroidery or cleaning.
Why are you laughing?
Stop laughing at me.
I am not a good daughter for leaving you.
We are women.
We are born to leave our families.
Mama.
Go.
Mama.
Lily.
Never forget we are vowed forever.
No one will come between us.
Snow Flower.
Sun, water and firewood are free.
But salt is a commodity.
The Taiping rebels are creating chaos everywhere.
I am concerned about our son trading in such a faraway place.
What do women know about such things?
Within this household,
I make all the decisions!
Obey, obey, obey.
He will do what he wants.
My father has granted me permission to travel to Guilin to buy salt.
I will return and sell it here.
Guilin. That is far.
Is it safe?
It is not a woman's place to worry.
I may be gone for a long time.
Excuse me, is Claire here?
- She's inside.
- Thanks.
Claire, you're here.
Sophia's aunt is not here.
I know.
Is there another way to reach her?
I'm in touch. She'll be back tonight.
Are these from Sophia's family?
Yes, Sophia gave us these.
They all belong to her family.
But the most important one is missing.
Perhaps Sophia has it.
This is a new interactive nu shu program.
You taught me how to be a good wife.
I must fulfill all my duties.
The wife of the eldest son must serve and honor her mother-in-law.
My daughter's birth was a disappointment.
I must bear a son.
Madam, I would like to visit Snow Flower...
...and go to the Temple of Gupo fair.
We promised to meet there every year.
I told you, Lily.
I do not approve of your relationship with Snow Flower.
She is my laotong.
We are vowed forever.
Why do you forbid me to go?
You must go pray for a son.
Yong Gang will go with you.
Yong Gang.
Take this to Snow Flower.
We must rely on the wind to carry our words.
Those winds are happy and sad.
We are forbidden to see each other.
But at every moment, I miss you.
Wait for me.
Snow Flower.
How does your husband treat you?
And yours?
Good.
However, I do not know why
Lady Lu disapproves of you.
But I am still here.
- I am happy.
- Me too.
Lady Lu, I know what I did was wrong.
Lady Lu!
Disobedience is a woman's greatest sin.
Auntie.
You're here.
I flew all night and all day to get back.
You know...
...Sophia and I haven't talked since that night.
I know.
When she first came back from Australia, she came to see me at the gallery.
How was she?
She seemed...
...very depressed.
And she was more depressed the next few times I saw her.
She didn't even want me to know where she lived.
Why?
Did she come back with Arthur?
No. She told me she left him.
I told her he was no good.
Nobody knows where she lives?
No.
I should have told you earlier.
But I could not bear to tell you the truth.
My father was addicted to the opium pipe.
He ruined our family.
Our fates have been reversed.
But our love will always be strong.
I am happy we are blessed with sons.
We are fulfilling our fates.
But now the typhoid epidemic is upon us.
Death is all around.
Everyone is afraid and anxious.
I hope you are safe where you are.
Dead, dead.
Madam, it is time for your medicine.
Everyone is dead.
Madam!
Madam!
Have some, madam. You will feel better.
- Children.
- Mother.
Do not come over here. Go back.
Mother, do not leave us.
I am not avoiding you.
I may be infected.
Mother.
I am always with you in my heart.
Good children.
- Mother! Mother!
- Mother! Mother!
The master is back!
The master is back.
Master and Lady Lu passed away.
They both succumbed to the plague.
On this day of the New Year...
...we became Master and Lady Lu.
Mrs. Liao.
It's Nina. I used to teach Sophia Chinese.
Do you remember me?
I remember.
I'd like to speak with you about Sophia.
She's had a terrible accident.
Accident? What accident?
I haven't spoken to her in years.
Sophia never saw me as her mother.
Don't touch me.
You see how I'm forced to live?
My husband died, my stepdaughter abuses me.
I'm a squatter in my own house.
This roof could fall in any minute.
Understand now?
I hear you're doing well.
Good career.
You have a bright future.
I've lost everything. Everything.
- Madam.
- Don't call me "madam."
Madam.
- Mrs. Liao.
- I'm not Mrs. Liao anymore!
When I had money, I was Mrs. Liao.
Now I'm just a ghost!
Today the stock market hit a new low due to the liquidation of Peregrine investments.
Why did you invest everything in the stock market?
You're losing all of our money.
Do they ever stop?
Since May '97, major indices have been in a free fall.
We haven't paid our bills in three months!
I'm losing patience with you! Stop now!
I can't take this. I'm leaving!
Dad.
The market goes up and down.
Up, down, up, down.
Yes, it does.
It'll come back, you'll see.
Mrs. Liao, I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't expect him to pass away so suddenly.
And to do this in his own home?
His daughter won't speak to me.
She isn't even studying for the college entrance exam.
If she fails,
I'm sending her back to Korea.
Nina, I feel sick.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What? There's no time. Quickly.
- Hold this.
- Let's go. There's no time.
I'll be right back.
Sophia.
Sophia Liao.
- It's still too loud here.
- You can't hear? Okay.
- Where?
- Let's go inside.
Here.
- What did you wanna say?
- I still don't understand why you did it.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I just did it.
You thought I couldn't pass my exam?
I feel bad.
It's gonna be all right.
What about you?
Don't worry about me. Let's go.
Who's there?
I'm coming.
Does Nina Wei live here?
Yes.
Shanghai Education Board
Disciplinary Notice
Nina!
Have you nothing to say?
How could you take the exam for someone else?
Look at me!
Do you know how hard your father and I work...
...to give you the best education?
And this is how you show your gratitude?
Three years.
You can't retake the exam for three years.
Do you realize what you've done?
You've not only ruined your future...
...but ours too.
You have destroyed our family!
By the time you read this letter, you'll be in Korea.
I did what I did because I wanted you to be happy.
Because I wanted us to be together.
And look what happened.
We're both being punished.
I don't expect my parents to understand what I did.
But I'm going to make them proud of me again.
I miss you. I love you.
Nina.
May I have your order?
Yes. I would like a Caesar salad and T-bone steak, please.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Miss Wei?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Sebastian Wu.
Hey. It's 9:00.
You should get home.
Yeah. I'm almost done.
- Okay. Good night.
- Bye.
We have lived through years of separation and turmoil.
I can still feel your heart in your words.
I am happy we will be together soon.
Lily.
Snow Flower.
Snow Flower.
Come inside. Meet my children.
You live here?
If not for your perfect feet and good marriage...
...I would not even be here.
The matchmaker did her best.
She did.
What does your husband do?
Butcher.
I would like to spend more time with my laotong tonight.
No, I want you to come to bed with me.
The Taiping rebels are coming!
- What is happening?
- The rebellion is here.
What rebellion?
There is no time to explain.
Your mother will not come out.
I will get her.
Are you leaving too?
Snow Flower, I cannot leave here.
We have no time.
We all have to leave.
- I should stay here. My husband will find me.
- It is time to go.
I will not go.
I cannot.
Put me down. I cannot go.
The cart broke! Get off!
Get the children.
You can rest soon. It is over here.
Lay her down here.
I will go fetch the cow.
Do not worry. I will return soon.
I am coming with you.
You take care of your mama.
- Are you all right?
- I am fine.
- How are your feet?
- They are fine.
My son!
My son! My son!
Nina, it's me.
I don't have Sophia's address yet, but I have found out Arthur is in Shanghai...
...and has just opened a trendy nightclub called Club Upside-Down.
I'll text you the details later.
Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right, all right
Let this groove light up your fuse
So stand up, all right, all right
Gonna tell you what you can do
Excuse me.
You know, this room actually works better when you're drinking.
Why are you here, Nina?
Is she all right?
She's here.
Do you mind if I see her alone?
There, see? See the guy?
I've never seen this before.
Something on your chest.
Aah!
- So?
- They loved the whole idea.
They're gonna open an office in New York.
- We did it.
- We did it.
I'd like you to come with me.
Wow.
Thank you.
There you go. Two Brain Hemorrhages.
Finally, your dream is coming true.
Ha, ha. I wouldn't call it a dream.
It's just like an opportunity.
Whatever you call it.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
So when do you leave?
I...
I haven't decided if I'm going.
What? What do you mean?
Actually, I...
I worry about you.
Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
I'm writing a book.
It's about laotong, the old days, but I think it's really about us.
When I finish it, I want you to read it.
That's nice.
But writing a book won't pay the rent unless you get it published.
I have a new boyfriend.
He has a lot of connections and he can help.
I know these guys of yours.
Don't go there.
Come on. This one is different.
I want you to meet him.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to dedicate a song...
...to the most irritating, maddening, stubborn woman I have ever met.
This song...
Yeah, she's actually here.
She knows who she is.
I'll keep you guessing for a little while, though.
This song is about the place
I usually find myself when we're together...
...which is begging for a kiss.
Hit it.
Give me just one kiss
Just yes or no
All right, here we go.
A kiss on my cheeks
Leaving a mark of love
Give me just one kiss
Just yes or no
Excuse me there.
A kiss in my heart
Makes me miss you so
Here we go, everybody, ready?
See how she teases me?
Oh.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen. We're up.
What a surprise.
He's a surprising guy.
What does he do, exactly?
Well, he's an Australian businessman...
...and he owns a bunch of clubs in Shanghai.
Great. He sounds wonderful.
And he's opening his new club in Sydney, and he wants me to go there with him.
We are leaving soon.
What?
You're leaving with him?
- To Sydney?
- Yes.
How long have you known him?
And you've decided to go with him?
I've known you for so long.
I've been so worried about you.
So stupid of me.
Did I ask you to worry about me?
How can you talk to me like that, Sophia?
I just wanna tell you, he's not right for you.
How do you know?
So it's all my fault.
Okay, fine. I won't bother you anymore.
- I'm going to New York.
- Good.
He will not tell me where our son is buried.
My husband takes his sadness and stuffs it into his fists.
So much has happened in the years we were apart.
Fate has taught me that I am just another woman.
I hope when I am reunited with my husband...
...I will be a better wife.
There is no purer ambition for a woman.
I am happy you think so.
If I can change my fate...
...so can you.
You think these bruises are my fault?
I do not want you to suffer.
My relationship is different but has something very important.
What is so important?
Lily.
Has your revered husband never shown you that he loves you?
I seek only to help you through this difficult time.
Our fates are so different.
I have felt your pity since you first came into my home.
I feel pain in my heart for you,
Snow Flower.
He is my husband, Lily.
I love him.
Lily.
There are things about men you will never know.
These are matters you do not understand.
You are my laotong.
Everything I have is yours.
The rebels have been stopped.
Come to Tongkou.
Let me take care of you and the children.
Come with me.
I do not understand.
If I give this message to Lady Lu...
...she will misunderstand your meaning.
Your bond may be broken forever.
This is my intention.
My sister is at a different station in her life.
I have become a burden to her.
She is far too stubborn and loyal to accept this.
What you are about to do will break her heart.
And mine, but it will set her free.
Loving her as I do, it is the only way.
- Lady, I am Lotus.
- I know who you are.
What do you want?
My sister asked me to return this to you.
My fate has brought me many sorrows.
I cannot be what you wish.
Three sworn sisters in Jintian have promised to love me as I am.
You need not worry about me anymore.
Burn them.
But...
Burn them.
Yes.
Snow Flower is here.
Sorry my sisters and I are late.
I wish you happiness in your marriage,
Cousin Yan.
Thank you for traveling all this way to celebrate our daughter's wedding.
I finally had to hire a private detective to find Sophia's address.
- Are you serious?
- Turns out she rented a little apartment.
She was holed up there finishing her novel.
It's near her father's old bathhouse.
Bathhouse?
Yeah. It's her favorite place.
Where her father would go to escape from his wife and the stock market.
And Sophia would wait for him.
They'd have tea or a meal.
It meant the world to her.
This is the address.
She never had visitors.
And didn't go out often.
If you find my rent money, tell me.
I'm writing a letter I will never send.
But I must tell you the truth, even if it's only in my heart.
How could you know how I felt all these years...
...about what you did for me?
How could I bear another sacrifice?
Giving up your future in New York...
...and yet...
...I knew your love was too strong.
There would be no asking you to change your mind.
I had to make you hate me.
And so I lied.
I lied about wanting to move out...
...needing to be free.
The reason I moved to Sydney was because I was pregnant with Arthur's baby.
But then I guess it was not meant to be.
I know what you think of me.
That...
That I didn't deserve her.
You're right, I didn't.
I mean, when we were first together...
...Sophia would disappear for, I don't know, a few hours every night.
She'd never tell me where she'd been.
I assumed she was seeing someone else, so one night, I followed her.
Where was she going?
To a bathhouse in Luwan.
I mean, the weird thing was...
...the bathhouse was restricted to men only.
She had to disguise herself to get in there.
Yeah.
She wore a suit, right?
Yeah, why?
It was her father's bathhouse.
Her father's?
Nina.
There's something...
There's something you should know.
She lost...
She lost your baby.
Excuse me.
My father left something here.
His locker number is 173.
I'm here to get it for him.
We're not open yet. They're still cleaning.
Old Ding, leave us alone.
This lady has some business here.
Please be quick.
Thank you.
The end of this story...
...is about things of the heart that will never change.
- Madam.
- What is wrong, child?
My mother is very sick.
She calls for you in her sleep.
But she has other sisters.
She has no other sisters.
She misled you.
She has never had another laotong.
For 10 years, she was only their teacher.
She has only one sister of the heart.
You have to see her one last time.
I beg you.
I waited for you.
Madam,
I brought you some things from home.
I am sorry.
I knew you could not want me to destroy the fan.
When Lily returned home after Snow Flower's funeral...
...she looked at the fan and could not allow things to end as they had.
So she opened a new panel...
...dipped her brush, and wrote a final inscription.
The world is always changing.
Every day it's changing.
Everything in life is changing.
We have to look inside ourselves to find what stays the same...
...such as loyalty...
...our shared history...
...and love for each other.
In them, the truth of the past lives on.
Now I understand Lily's last inscription for Snow Flower...
...and what it means for Sophia and me.
My entire life, I have longed for love.
I always thought I understood it...
...but now I see, with shame and sorrow...
...that I understand nothing of deep-hearted love.
The love between sisters.
So many years without you.
This is my penance.
If you will come back to me...
...I will never leave you.
Never again.
And we will be sisters for 10,000 years. carrot / subscene.com
IRONCLAD (2011)
England, in the year 1215, had been under the reign of King John for 16 years.
The most villainous of England's monarchs,
John was renowned for losing wars with France, levying punitive taxes, and sleeping with the wives of barons.
The barons finally rebelled against their king, and became locked in a bloody civil war lasting for over three years and decimating both armies.
In time, the Knights Templar were drawn into this conflict.
With the help of these highly trained warrior monks,
King John and his royal army were eventually defeated.
It was agreed that John could remain on the throne, on one condition... that he would sign a document upholding the rights and privileges of all free men, but ultimately limiting the power of the monarchy.
Make it count.
The Magna Carta was sealed at Runnymede, on the 15th of June in the year of our Lord 1215.
It will be remembered throughout history.
What is not remembered is what King John did next.
Sire?
Sire?
It's time.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
England welcomes you.
Does the Pope hold his word?
Oh, how have faith,
Captain Tiberius.
His Eminence is waiting to hear you hold to yours.
The Church will stay out of your lands, you have his word.
We'll get your country back.
What say you?
Abbot Marcus.
We seek shelter from the storm.
Open the gates!
Come and help.
What business do you have here?
Our business is with God at Canterbury.
We need only shelter.
Shelter you shall have. Food also.
You treat the Lord's servants well.
You wear the mark of the Templars, yet you carry no swords.
These men have no more need to fight.
Templars masking their faith and travelling without swords.
How noble!
As God is our witness, Baron, these men have nothing to hide.
Abbot, save your benedictions.
The Templars fought against the King.
Now you sleep in a king's castle.
These men have plenty to hide.
You there. What say you?
They say nothing.
They hold vows of silence.
Templars without tongues.
Very well.
Just be gone by the morning.
Back inside!
Marshal.
When I accept guardianship over men who take the vows of silence,
I'm also informed of what led them to me in the first place.
I know the Templars placed a heavy burden on you.
I know you're deeply scarred.
The cross on your tunic is a symbol of your faith in God's will.
It should not be full of the torment it now bears upon your soul.
When we arrive at Canterbury,
I'm requesting your leave from the Order of the Knights Templar.
Garrison men!
King John!
Men, to the gates!
It's the King!
Open the gates for the King!
Psst!
Marshal, did you see royal colours?
Is that your hand, Darnay?
Forced, Your Highness.
The barons threatened my life, forcing me to sign it and betray you.
I know the feeling.
Hang him!
This insanity must cease.
Open the door.
His quarrel is not with us.
If you three stand before the King, there will be nothing but death.
What good fortune, Darnay.
It seems you will have your last rites.
My Lord, Templars.
He's travelling en route to Canterbury with Templars.
To what do I owe the pleasure of the Church visiting my castle?
We were in the storm, sire.
Baron Darnay granted us your hospitality.
- We?
- My fellow priests.
Ah, yes, I heard.
Templars.
Sire, we entered your castle as unarmed men. We seek no fight.
Are you aware, Abbot, that your kind stood at Runnymede and forced my signature, and now you sleep under my roof?
Your Highness, we travel to Canterbury with simple articles of faith.
I ask your mercy that we may pass.
And I will grant you the same mercy that the Church and the barons of this country bestowed unto me.
"Do unto others", isn't that right, Abbot?
Tiberius!
Don't let him go!
Ride!
There is worth...
.. in every death.
And I will see it now in yours.
- You saw the King?
- Yes. And he saw me.
Mm.
I didn't imagine that even he was capable of such cruelty.
Abbot Marcus was the finest of men.
Tell me, why did he request that you leave the Order?
- Your Grace, I did not wish to be dismissed.
- But that's not what I asked.
You were in the Holy Lands?
Hm. Some men have returned from defending our faith only to find themselves questioning it.
Now you must ask yourself,
Thomas... what is in your heart?
Rebellion or revenge.
I suppose it makes no difference as the King has the devil in his.
I don't care if he's talking to the Pope! I have to see him now!
And as we speak of the devil...
My Lord Archbishop.
They told me about Darnay.
We took John at his word... and now he raises a bitch's army with God's teeth.
I'll bow to no king with piss for blood!
Baron William de Albany,
Brother Thomas Marshal.
Brother Thomas comes directly from Darnay Castle.
You must forgive our Baron, his tongue is not always so profane.
Now, you should know that Rome sides with the King.
And the Pope would bless what the King did to Abbot Marcus?
More or less.
I am to be excommunicated for writing Magna Carta.
- How long have we got?
- God knows.
Your Grace, this...
.. king... must be stopped.
I cannot, in all honesty, ask you to fight, Thomas, but if you choose to take up your sword, you have my blessing. it's a good omen.
God is with us.
Prince Louis has an army may be persuaded to join us.
Asking the French for help... that's cursing the blind for the wicked.
If John takes the Dover Road to London he has to cross the Medway here at Rochester.
I'll seize Rochester Castle.
Delay them. That'll give you time to negotiate with the French.
We have no force to fight the King.
I have a few men I can count on.
Absolutely not. Suicide is a sin in the eyes of the Church, Baron.
Your Grace,
I'm afraid I only see one thing.
From Rochester, the King is able to dispatch his troops and supplies all over the country.
It is his keystone.
Without it we will not stop him.
All my sins to this.
May God protect what we are about to do.
Guy!
Squire!
I want you to ride back.
No. I know how to fight.
You see how he talks to me?
Have you ever killed a man, Squire?
Eh?
- Then you will learn, it is not a noble thing.
- Not even when it's for freedom?
Not even when it is for God.
Hah!
Look at you!
Any one of you throws a turd or a bean, I'll get you!
And you know I will! Yargh!
- Where's the butchers?
- Over there.
I'll remember your faces!
Sheep shears!
They're sharp! Sharp sheep shears!
- I'm looking for Daniel Marks.
- Wait here.
Marks!
Whatever it is or how much...
- just get me out of here, Baron.
- Done. Where's de Lacy?
- He went back to Poitou.
- Becket?
You don't want him.
Templars.
They've come back.
Here. You may need protection.
Get up.
I said, get up!
You sack of shit!
Billy.
What told me I'd see you?
What's with the altar boy?
Billy all tied up with God again?
- This is not our man.
- Hoy!
I'm his man, don't you worry about that.
If he pays me enough,
I'll split the gut of any man alive.
Ain't that right, Billy boy?
- Who's with you?
- Gil Becket. Daniel Marks.
The last time we were all together must have been Dieppe.
The days when the King was still good to us.
He's taken all the castles along the coast.
If he takes Rochester, he'll control southern England.
If the whispers I've heard are true, he's too strong now.
He's got an army of Danish mercenaries.
Wait for him in London.
Do you think I want this?
I'm not a soldier, not any more.
I'm a fat wool merchant with a hen-pecking wife and three daughters.
But, unfortunately, he won't let it be.
I'm sorry, Baron. Not this one.
I learnt about the Crusades.
Is it true what the Templar swords say?
"Blessed and omnipotent is the warrior of Christ"'?
Yeah, water. Water.
- Hey!
- Agh!
What do you think he's worth?
- Are you sorry for what you've done?
- Bollocks.
- Release him.
- Amen!
Papa!
Get inside. Now!
- Joseph.
- Baron.
- Daniel.
- Wulfstan.
Becket.
You... are a filthy whore, Becket.
So was she.
We'll never hold that castle with this lot.
They may not be worthy of that cross you wear, but they'll hold the castle.
Not for England... not for God... but for me.
Winter's soon, so if I'm not back by first snowfall, take your sister to your aunt, give her this. Hm?
Work hard.
Be polite.
And what's written here is true?
From my ears to this paper, Sire.
Tiberius, six of your fastest scouts to Rochester.
Instruct them to hold the castle.
- Kill anyone they find there.
- Hyah!
Money.
And you know these men?
So what does that make you?
Worthless.
There it is.
Looks small from here.
That... small castle... controls all the land as far as you can see.
Be patient, Squire.
As long as there's women.
- What say you?
- I bring business from Archbishop Langton.
Isabel!
We have company.
I have told you before,
I will not tolerate drinking.
You won't tolerate anything.
My Lord. We have men at the gate.
I tolerate the politics of the King, Isabel.
Our marriage was arranged for land and wealth.
It would be well if you were to remember that.
And he owns us, body and soul.
Open the gates! Let 'em in!
You arrive unexpected,
Baron de Albany.
What matter does His Grace send this late?
That we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.
If your visit is to claim my castle, Baron... you're too late.
Unusual saddles.
- Danish.
- What was that?
They're Danish.
They arrived last night.
The King's scouts.
His army is less than a day away.
Oaks, get the guard here quickly.
That one was at Darnay Castle two days ago.
Aargh!
Argh!
No. No, no!
Marshal, down!
Yargh!
Baron.
Stand down! Stand down!
Listen to me.
By the archbishop, we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.
The rebellion's over.
The King surrendered to the great charter.
Magna Carta.
This one sealed by the King's own hand.
And now... he's executing everybody who supported it.
But does the Pope know that the Archbishop is claiming royal castles, against the King?
I watched as three of my brothers were killed by the soft hand of a king that is murdering his way across the country.
And he does so with the Pope's blessing.
The French army make sail any day now.
Giving us... a new king.
A true king.
Seal the gates.
Lock all the doors! Move!
And, Oaks, no one else comes in.
Very well.
Well, Marshal... you got us our castle.
- What is your strength, Captain?
- Eleven men-at-arms.
- We have less than 20 men?
- And these walls.
- They've never been breached.
- Does the keep have a portcullis?
- It does.
- Good.
- Once it's down, no one gets in.
- Water. Where is the supply?
From the Well. Draws straight from the river.
No one here gets thirsty.
- it's good, it's not sick or brackish?
- Water's good, sir.
Guy, with me.
These walls are designed to be defended by one man per station.
Outlook is perfect.
Any approach can be seen for miles.
Now, let's see the gatehouse.
You, day or night, stay alert.
Now open it up.
What's the problem?
There's no moat.
That'll do.
Now, when they come...
.. hit them hard.
Hit the post.
I said, hit the post. Hard.
They'll come? The French.
We waited for the French at Damascus.
They didn't come then.
Even to a Frenchman I think
Rochester is nearer than Damascus.
Hit it.
You better hit it harder than that, boy.
Or you'll be dead before they get here.
They hate women.
Just to look at one's a sin.
Some people say they worship the devil.
Celibates with stone hearts.
Then I have a stone heart, too, Maddy.
I didn't mean it like that.
A Templar offers his Chastity to God, but a wife... she suffers hers by her husband.
My husband's appetites don't include me.
Thank the Lord Mary herself.
Now, I am...
"curious, Albany.
Why is it that you and your friends are so struck with this rebellion?
- Mm.
- Cos we are for the people.
I see your esquire is well-trained in the art of naivety.
- Go on.
- Call me naive if you will, sir, but the people deserve more than a king that treats them like animals.
Ah, bold words for a Squire.
Have you read Magna Carta?
- I...
- Ah, I see. You can't read Latin.
It's a pity, arguing from ignorance.
Argumentum ad ignorantiam, ab uno disce omnes.
That's Roman, innit?
From one person, learn all people.
Excuse my wife's bold tongue.
Becket,
I'm gonna need you on the far wall.
- Guy can't defend it on his own.
- Do it yourself.
What?
You want a drink? A woman?
Don't you sniff your nose at me.
I've been places. I've seen what your holy brothers have done.
Your pious bile makes me sick.
Becket. I want you outside.
I'll watch your boy's back, but who's watching mine?
To the battlements!
- To the battlements!
- Right away!
- Take your positions, men!
- Get those men up here, quickly!
Mercel, they're here!
Let's see what rats have taken up in my home.
Move it!
Come on!
Albany, a word. You cannot engage the King without considering terms.
He wants our heads on spikes.
Where are the terms in that?
There are some in here who didn't pick this fight.
Ask yourself who you're for, Cornhill.
The King or the country?
Because we both can't be wrong.
They're here.
Albany!
Albany!
How did he know?
What can we do for you, John?
Baron William de Albany.
The Pope has ordered me to reclaim my country.
Now, surely you don't bar your door against a king, and the Church?
Does he know you sealed a charter... giving the people of England freedom, and that now you go back on your word?
England is mine, Albany.
God's will bestowed it unto me, the Pope blesses it to me, and this castle belongs to me!
You're no more a king... than the boil on my arse!
Huh.
What a tedious little man.
Get the swords now. Come on!
Move yourselves!
Stay by your posts.
Remember, they have to climb over these walls.
And we do not.
So you stand firm!
Have you ever fought so many with so few?
Uh-huh.
Don't you forget, you hold the wall, huh?
Now, go to your post.
North and south advance!
Get ready, archers!
Loose!
Take cover!
And again! Take cover!
Get down!
Ha-ha!
Come on, lads, come on!
Take your positions! Look lively!
Take cover, lads! Take cover!
Argh!
Again!
Argh!
Albany!
Archers! They're coming!
Make a stand! Ready?
Load arrows!
Loose!
- Oil! Bring up that oil!
- Ready!
Loose!
Oil! Watch your back!
Take cover!
Becket!
Come on. This way.
- What do we do?
- Pray God is with them.
Becket!
Ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Guy!
Show that to your mother!
Now, get up!
I said get up!
Now, you hit him. Hard!
Behind you! Clear!
Take cover!
Aargh!
They're running!
They're retreating!
They've had enough, Baron.
Bastards! Go on, run!
Come on, you foreign whores!
You fought bravely.
You did not see everything.
There's no finding peace after knowing this.
Faith, Guy.
Only the weak believe that what they do in battle... is who they are as men.
Put him with the others.
Pack 'em over there.
Over there, that's it.
Baron Albany... in less than a day... you have stripped away everything
I gave the people in this castle.
- Get off my back.
- You were hellbent on this fight!
You made us all hostages to your cause, not the rebellion's.
And this was not just another castle!
This was my home!
Now clear your mess up.
Shut the door.
Still now.
Wait. Here.
- This man is bleeding.
- On the table.
No. Wait.
This will stop the flow.
I'm gonna pull this hard.
The bone's not broken, but...
Go on, do it, do it.
Keep it clean, and watch him close.
Templar.
- Your neck.
- No.
Sit.
Please.
If the bleeding doesn't stop, shall I fasten a belt around your neck?
My maid tells me you cannot look at women.
What is your name?
Am I to assume your silence means you cannot talk to women either?
My name is Thomas Marshal.
There it is.
And were many sacred vows broken by that revelation?
It's not like the others.
The river naturally defends.
Walls built... so a few can stop many.
Don't insult me, Captain.
I know the qualities of a Norman keep.
What I am having trouble with... is how a thousand men could have failed so miserably against twenty.
Those men fight hard. For what?
A small rock in a field?
We go around.
My great, great grandfather built that rock when he conquered this country.
Strategically, it fortifies London and controls all of southern England.
Why in God's name do you think they chose to hole up there in the first place?
What will please your people more, Captain?
That your men died in a great battle, or that your reward for helping me is the Church leaving your lands alone?
For that is what the Pope promised he would do.
Now, however small it may seem...
.. with that rock, the rest of this country follows.
Now you see what he means to do.
I say this to each of you.
There's a night out there... deep enough for a man to slip away, if he should wish.
And I would understand.
I think you upset him.
What about you, Marks?
I took this for you at Angouléme.
I walked into this outside Toulouse.
Both times we saw it through.
What do you think I'm doing here?
I don't take a man's money and run.
Mr Phipps, are you and your garrison men still for the fight?
All six of us. Good and ready, sir.
Ah!
I saw you with the Templar.
I think he has a mind for you.
His mind possesses nothing
I care to think about.
There is something not normal with him.
It's his manner.
He looks but won't talk.
Then he talks and nothing he says settles with me.
Don't tell me that was his way before he became a Templar. I wouldn't believe it.
- My Lady.
- What?
That's a great deal of thinking... for someone you don't want to think about.
Hm.
They're building something.
What do you think it is?
Your royal engineer, Sire.
- Will it work?
- There's no moat, er... So, er...
There's no moat and no excuses. Finish it.
Tell him to construct a...
I am sorry for what I said to you.
I was wrong.
What happens next... to us?
- All of us?
- They will attack again.
And we will hold again.
The French...
.. made sail with an army to stand by us.
You really believe they will come?
Hm.
Thou shall not lie, Thomas.
Certainly not for the French.
Definitely not to me.
It isn't worth it.
Does that break Templar laws?
Mm.
Some would say yes.
Put the sword down.
If they do come,
I will need to know how to use this.
- Is this how you hold it?
- If you want your opponent to win.
I fight...
.. so you don't have to.
Siege tower.
Making quick work of it.
Damn it.
Baron, I have an idea.
What happens if this doesn't work?
- Don't ask.
- What could be worse than this?
Squire, would you ever kill a woman?
- Never.
- Not even if it meant saving her life?
That's it, heave it down.
Holy Saint Joseph! Look who it is.
His Majesty is ready, my Lord.
- Prince Louis holds in France.
- They haven't sailed yet?
- He's buying time to negotiate terms.
- Negotiate terms!
The King enslaves this country, the Pope defends him and calls the Magna Carta heresy, and France uses this tyranny for a better deal?
- Are there any men willing to fight?
- A few.
Many thought the rebellion was over because John signed the Magna Carta.
In some ways, it was the smartest thing he did.
Well, all that is done.
Let Rome pronounce whatever holy dictum it pleases.
They won't tell me that God is their possession.
I leave for France at once.
You gather what men you can.
And prepare London for war.
And Rochester?
- Baron Albany?
- Pray God is with them.
Take cover!
Excellent. Excellent.
Go on. Faster!
Lock it!
- Lock!
- And fire!
They have built an engine?
Yargh!
Take cover!
All of you, outside.
Wulfstan, you've broken through!
Now, come on! Give them hellfire!
Heave!
Heave!
Aargh!
Lock it!
Fire pot, Guy!
You heathen dogs!
Bring it a bit forward!
Light it!
Light it!
Loose!
Yeah!
Goddamn devils!
Murdering goddamn whores!
Yes! They burn!
Do not record that!
Bitches!
This bastard king, Wulfstan.
Aye.
After that, the king did not come again.
But the rains did.
And the days grew short as autumn turned to winter.
They were too cold to Fight, and too hungry.
The castle stores were empty... and they had taken to eating the horses.
Save for one.
Marshal's.
But a Templar is forbidden to eat his horse.
Their Order dictates that it must die in battle.
So 13 hungry souls and one horse would remain.
Still they waited.
And so too did the King.
They could smell his food, hear his army's song.
For attrition is one man's ally and another man's curse.
So they became cursed men.
And as weeks turned to months, their minds took to places they should not... where a man sees only doubt and has no worth at all.
On my wedding day
I knew my marriage would have no love.
Yet still I took my vows to God.
I honoured and obeyed my commitments daily.
You think we are not the same, Thomas, but you're wrong.
- I'm starving!
- What do you want me to do?
Someone's gotta do something!
Listen to me.
Damn your Templar vows!
It was my vows that made me what I am.
It was my Order that brought me here.
And by God's good grace, it will be the Templars that save your life.
Where are you going?
Why are you leaving?
Why would he leave?
My Lady, you were with him last.
Did he say why he left?
You go to your chamber.
Now.
No.
I'll kiss the Bishop's arse if he comes back.
You're gonna have to kiss a king's arse,
Becket, cos they're coming back again.
- it's Thomas!
- Open the gates!
Becket, get him!
Get him, Becket!
Come oh! Quickly! Help him!
Get the sacks. The sacks!
- Come on!
- Hurry!
- Run!
- Close the portcullis!
What was you thinking, Templar?
He's stolen the king's food.
I've never seen such a thing!
You are relieved of your command, Captain.
Get back in your rowboat and go home.
- I'm not leaving without my men!
- Oh yes, you are!
And I will tell you why.
The Pope has had a change of heart.
What do you say?
I say that when your pathetic little army arrives back at your houses, you will find your lands Christianised.
Your sons enslaved to the Church and your wives serving new husbands.
You did not speak to the Pope of my lands?
Why in God's name would I do that?
Take this castle, Tiberius!
And if you do not, you will be sailing home to quite a different world.
Well, Marshal, you sure know how to pick a bit of shank.
Better than three months of horse meat.
I'll stick with the pig.
Then what?
I'll eat you.
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
So, Squire... you can read words?
And write them too?
What's your full name?
Jedediah Coteral.
Jedediah Coteral.
Jedediah Coteral.
Yeah.
I've never seen it written before. Huh.
Hm.
It's too quiet.
Check the far wall.
To the battlements! Attack!
Cover the west wing.
West wing! Come on!
- Watch out!
- To the right!
Help me!
The gates! The gates!
Where's Marshal?
Fight, Guy! Fight!
Baron!
Aargh!
Baron!
Don't move. Be still.
- Hold the keep.
- You can't die.
You can't die. Stay alive!
You hear me?
Hold the keep! Go! Go!
Yaargh!
Phipps!
- Come here!
- Hold the gates!
I've got it. I've got it.
Come on, to the gates!
Hold!
All in! All in!
Stand fast!
Shield wall!
Shields. Shields up!
Up!
Brace yourselves.
Ready! Ready!
- Isabel!
- Get inside!
Now!
- We have to get to the Baron!
- To the keep!
- We can't leave him!
- He's gone, all right?
Hold the steps! Hold the steps!
Come on!
Marshal!
Pull him down!
Marshal!
Come on!
Get it off! Get it off!
Get back, behind the portcullis!
Come on!
They have prisoners.
Boy!
Good afternoon, Baron.
Did you find my castle to your liking?
It's the people's castle now.
You said he was gone.
Those two.
Cut off their hands and feet.
- No.
- No!
No!
No!
Now, Baron,
I want my keep back.
- At my command!
- No!
- They'll never surrender.
- Really?
Do it!
Do something!
We hold the keep.
My arse, your stinking castle!
Aaargh!
Aargh!
God damn you, you murdering whore!
Isn't that the king I am?
You betray all that's meant to be king.
You betray God!
I betray God?!
My crown was passed to me by my brother, and my father before him.
I was born to be a king!
It is my birthright!
Given to me by God!
You cry for the common man and in the same breath you curse the crown that protects him!
You dare to question my reign... and the lineage of Kings who have reigned before me?!
The great amaranthine royalty of Aquitaine...
.. who forged this land from barbarian hordes and made it noble and pure!
Who gave it order, meaning, and even faith... to thousands of years of loyal subjects!
And it is all now questioned by you!
And we are forced to sign your precious Magna Carta, forced by you, a wool merchant!
I am the blood!
I am God's right hand!
And you will never dictate to me how I am to be a king!
Now, Baron.
Which hand did you touch me with?
Hold his hand down.
Hold his right hand down!
This is not something you should see.
Aargh!
Tell your rebels to open the gate, Albany!
No surrender!
- No surrender!
- Put his other hand up! Do it!
Do it!
Aargh!
We hold, Baron!
We hold!
Put his feet up. Put his feet up!
Cornhill!
You will yield to your king!
Or, as God hears me, your head is on a spike!
Now, that monster that they've made, strap his carcass to it.
Strap him to it!
Heave!
There's no one coming, is there?
My scouts report the French have left Calais.
They'll be at our back within days.
Do you know that when I was a child,
I once secretly ate every urn of my father's beloved honey peaches.
And the next day... he brought before me a servant girl that he had accused of the crime.
And he placed her hand on the table, and he drew his knife...
.. and he delivered the punishment.
And that night, unable to contain my shame,
I confessed to him that it was I, his son, who had committed the crime.
Do you know what his response was?
He said, "I know.
"I know.
"And that is why I only cut off her finger.
"You see, John, any action against the throne
"must be punished ruthlessly.
"For that is the only way to maintain the absolute power...
".. of a king. "
When they come, you must demand to see the King.
I want nothing from him.
Not even mercy.
I broke my vow, Isabel.
I have betrayed God's trust.
What we did was a sin.
Stop hiding... behind vows and commandments.
The vows speak of loyalty and abstinence and murder, but... why never love, Thomas?
The vows of the Order...
.. protect my soul from the blood
I've spilt in God's name.
It was the Church that made you do those things.
It was the Templars that gave you a sword and the name of God to wield it.
It was the Templars that made you kill.
Who were you before them?
What was so bad about that man then that makes you resist your desires now?
Thomas...
I am not a sin.
Sire? Sire?
Your engineer, sire.
The mine is ready.
Will it work?
- it's right under the keep's foundations.
- Ah.
Then take note.
To my justiciar, send to me 40 pigs.
The least good for eating.
Deliver that at once.
Come on! Hurry up! Move it!
That's it.
- Where you going?
- I'm going to plead for terms.
No!
What else is there to do?
We hold.
We hold for What? The French?
They're not coming.
- I'll ask for terms.
- No!
We swore an oath. An oath!
To Albany. To England.
Your oath is worthless.
Magna Carta is worthless.
The Church has annulled it.
Whatever happens here is meaningless.
No. No. Wait!
- That's enough, Squire.
- Becket?
Your boy here tried to take the old man's head off.
Becket, leave him be.
Now, Guy... get away from him.
- Now.
- Or what?
You'll kill me?
- Guy...
- Shut up!
Baron de Albany gave his life for his beliefs.
What have you given for yours?
Coward.
There's no salvation to this end.
Our souls... are damned.
You are not a coward.
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing my name.
How do you do that?
Master Guy taught me.
Well, that's you all done then.
What makes a man like you so angry?
I've been angry so long...
I don't even remember. it's kept you alive though, I suppose.
I don't think it's gonna get us through this one.
- What do you think they're doing?
- Pigs. For a sapper's fire.
- Sappers?
- They're digging a mine underneath us.
Pig's fat, it burns, with the heat of a crucible.
Make Way!
Go on! Go!
Whoa!
Whoa there!
Whoa!
Bring them in.
We've got a bigger problem.
Hah! Get in there!
Go on!
Coteral.
It's hot.
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Templar.
We get to the other side of the keep.
Guy, take the women to the chapel, huh?
Go!
Hurry, Isabel.
Get down! Get down!
- I think he's gone.
- I'm not making that mistake again.
Come on.
OK.
One, two.
Oh, Maddy. She was beside me.
Becket. Becket.
Ha!
I'll hold them Off.
How much did they pay to get you out those stocks?
- Five shillings.
- That is cheaper than a whore.
Come on, you filthy whores!
If they get through us, you kill the women.
- No.
- Say it.
- I can't.
- Say it!
I'll kill the women.
Come on, you whore! Yaargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Forgive me.
Thomas. Thomas!
Thomas!
Save her.
No one touch him!
How's your faith now, Templar?
Why don't you come a little closer...
.. and I'll show you.
Yaaargh!
You fought bravely.
Is killing a noble thing?
But a life fought for others is a life worth living.
That is a noble thing.
A French prince now holds the English crown.
Not an easy decision to make.
Nor was this one.
The Order's over for you, Thomas.
You've earned your freedom as much as any man.
Your Grace.
Come on.
We held.
Within a year, the rebellion was won.
While fleeing for his life,
King John died of dysentery.
What was left of his treasure was never recovered.
In time, the great keep of Rochester was rebuilt.
It stands to this day.
So too does the noble dream that was...
Magna Carta.
