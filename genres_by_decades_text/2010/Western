My name is Red Doc and I can whip any men in the house and ride any filly in the place.
Give me a fresh bottle, the good stuff and don't keep a tip
I don't like you.
Big Boy. I am Madame Lorraine.
I'm ready to see you got the guts.
But it will cost you.
On a horseback hanging from my chandelier you name it!
I hope your aim improves.
You think I'm too drunk, don't you honey?
Come over here and sit by me.
I'll show you what I can do.
Let's make it comfy first.
Get rid of him. And make sure noone sees you.
Like always boss.
- I know who you are. You are the Jonah Hex.
- Congratulations.
I can shoot six bottles off a fence and not miss a one.
Who gives a damn?
I could take it!
- seen him?
- Can't say that I have.
Are you sure?
A-Ha
Put a drink on the bar and go away.
- I have seen him.
- Talk.
I'll help you. Will you help me?
What kind of help? Enough money to leave town.
Got me a little paper round.
Madame Lorraine, she picks the well-heeled ones they go upstairs...
...they are never seen again.
Take your reward.
Hey bartender...
Set up the house.
Hey, cowboy. How would you like to trade that drink for some real fun water upstairs?
- You ask me because I'm so handsome?
- Cos I think you can afford a good time.
- How about we both get comfortable?
- I'm looking for a dead man named Red.
Oh, a dead man!
Now Why would I know anything about a dead man?
- You wouldn't hit a lady?
- You ain't no lady.
Drinks are on the house.
- You hit me.
- Hard as I could.
Only gonna ask this once:
Where is Red?
He's gonna be a little wraith.
Oh man,
You and your rats smart bussiness, ain't you?
Wait! We could be partners.
I don't mind splitting the take.
- You can't leave me here alone!
- You ain't alone. You got plenty of company ...
... And you know hell everybody there.

Gyilokpeti
You all right?
Let's get in.
We were flying.
Yeah!
I don't want to do that again.
No.
Hey.
Hey, you stay with me.
Keep talking.
You remember now, don't you?
What?
The woman.
Did you love her?
You can tell me.
I can't remember.
I must've.
All I know is I owe it to her to find her.
Watch out. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I got you.
I got you.
It's not far now.
You and me, we're gonna be just fine.
Is that…
Is that them?
Boss?
–I got her.
–Give her to me, Nat. Bring her here.
–Here. Drink.
–No. Give it to her. Give it to her.
Doc?
How is she?
She's gone, pal.
No. No, she's not gone.
She's not. She's not gone!
Jake.
She's gone.
–Doc!
–Don't touch him!
Doc!
This is Black Knife.
The last of his people.
There's no reasoning with them.
We're all gonna die anyway.
This is what's left of the Chiricahuas.
Good riddance to 'em!
He's saying the white people, they brought all this evil to his people.
We brought evil? Evil was here!
You're the evil one!
He's saying we brought the monsters.
We didn't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people, too!
Tell him they took my wife!
Shut up!
There's no reasoning with them!
Tell him what I said, Nat!
Kill us now!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't tell you.
Are you one of them?
No. I'm from a different place.
I took this form so I could walk among you.
You should have told me.
I didn't know if I could heal this body, if I would wake up.
He wants to know where you're from.
What'd she say?
She says she came from a place above the stars.
What does that mean? Another world?
What do you mean?
What does that mean? What?
He says you shouldn't talk.
What do you mean I shouldn't talk?
I got questions…
You're a guest of the chief.
Now I'm a guest? I thought
I was a prisoner! What the hell am I?
Enough! All right. You're both big men!
Great warriors!
Can we just listen to the woman tell her story?
Or whatever she is?
What are they doing here?
They want gold.
Well, that's just ridiculous.
What are they gonna do, buy something?
It's as rare to them as it is to you.
What about my grandpa?
What about my wife? What about the other people? Are they still alive?
If they are, they won't be for long.
They're studying your weaknesses.
These are just scouts.
If we let them leave, they'll come back with more and there will be no survivors.
That's what they did to my people.
I came here to make sure it would not happen again, but we have to work together.
He says his people will join her.
What do you mean, join her?
What's she going to do?
Where you going to go?
We can find them.
He knows where they are.
No, I don't.
I can't remember anything.
I couldn't even remember my own name.
He says they will take care of that.
I brought the gold.
Into the house.
That's why she died.
It's not your fault.
I know where they are.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
How did they build something like that?
They arrived in it. It's their vessel.
That's only the top.
The rest is underground.
It's how they mine for gold.
So there is gold here.
Can they see out of there?
They don't see well in daylight.
They stay underground in caverns where it's dark.
We'll never even get close.
Those flying machines will just pick us off before we get anywhere near it.
There is another way in.
Down there.
The way I came out.
We got to get those creatures out of there and out in the open, where we can get at them.
So you can get in with that arm gun, get our people out.
We have one advantage, they underestimate you.
You're like insects to them.
They're not planning on defending themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.
–We haven't got enough men.
–This ain't gonna work.
He says he wants to use your spyglass.
The Apaches are mountain warriors.
He says it's better to fight from high ground.
Tell him he's a fool.
There is no high ground while they got those flying machines.
Jake's leaving!
That's just dandy.
Son of a bitch.
Quit stalling.
How much gold we had left?
Barely enough.
But I'm gonna need my share right now so I can get as far away from here as I possibly can.
–Red?
–I got him, Bull.
Hey, there.
I had one hell of a job finding you boys.
You planning a trip?
We're going as far away as we can go.
You remember la playa in Puerto Vallarta?
They got good fishing.
Good tequila.
You want to come with us?
Don't make no difference.
It's not far enough.
What in the hell were those things, Jake?
It doesn't matter.
They're gonna find us and they're gonna wipe us out.
What in the hell are you saying?
What I'm saying is you got a choice.
You can drink your last few hours away on a beach, which by the way, is not a bad idea or you can follow me one last time.
We got to make the best use of our resources.
We got to have a strict…
Listen to me, damn it!
He doesn't understand tactics.
You got to explain to him.
Look, we can't just run around hollering and throwing spears and shooting arrows at the damn thing.
We got to draw them out of there onto open ground where we can surround them, attack them on all sides.
Flank them. Explain to him.
He said he's not going to let you lead his people.
What's he saying?
He's saying they need to open their hearts and see in you what he has seen.
That his parents died in the Mexican War and you took him in when he was only a boy.
That you gave him purpose.
Taught him how to take care of himself even though you were not blood.
That you despise battle but would never run from it.
That you're a fierce warrior worthy of any fight.
He says if you're such a great warrior, why do you only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle?
Dog! Dog!
Boy!
How are you?
Hot damn.
Ready to get your son back?
Give me that. Okay.
Matches.
I don't have any more matches.
We're gonna have to go down.
I don't know what we're going to do.
Go. Go!
Go. Go!
I think we destroyed it.
Demons are coming out.
Take this. Go up where I showed you.
–You see our people, wave your arms.
–Yes, sir.
Move out!
Good job.
If our people are in there,
I'll get them out.
Godspeed.
Let's get them!
This is how they get the gold out.
They're not going down!
They will!
Keep at it till we get our people out!
Doc!
Doc, get down here!
Jesus.
Doc!
Did we get one?
Yeah, we got one.
I always dreamed of riding into battle with you.
I always dreamed of having a son like you.
Go.
Get Percy.
Get your son.
Don't look into the light.
–I told you not to look into the light.
–Yeah, right.
How long are they gonna be like this?
Each one's different.
Hold them off.
You'd better hurry.
There's more of them coming!
Go!
Everybody's out.
Right.
Hey! Where are you going?
It's this way!
Go. Go!
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here!
No!
I came here to destroy that thing.
How?
With the bracelet. Take it off.
Wait, I can't take it off.
Yes, you can. You can control it.
–How?
–Same way you shoot it. With your mind.
You have to stop thinking.
This isn't working.
It fell off.
If I can get it to its core,
I can stop them.
Let's go.
Take this.
Throw it!
–Good-bye, Jake.
–What?
Wait! Ella!
No!
I see them! I see them!
They got out.
They're coming out the other side!
You see Percy?
Yeah, I see him!
What about Jake and Ella?
No. They're not there.
You all right, old man?
–Where's the girl?
–She's still inside.
Go!
Grandpa!
It's me.
Emmett.
Emmett.
You're all grown up.
Percy.
Don't you remember me, boy?
I'm sorry. I don't remember much.
I'm your father.
Pa.
Do you remember me?
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.
All this gold's gonna make things different.
We're gonna have a railroad in here soon.
That'll change the cattle business.
Run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?
Tell them I need some new checks.
Okay.
I want the new ones to read
“Dolarhyde and Son.”
–That sound good to you?
–Yes. Yes, sir.
–John.
–Woodrow.
It appears our town is about to get a whole lot bigger.
You weren't gonna leave without saying good-bye, were you?
I'm a wanted man.
I could have sworn I saw
Jake Lonergan die in those caves, didn't you, Sheriff?
Damn shame.
I was looking forward to hanging him myself.
I could use a good man around here.
Yes, you could.
Jake.
She's in a better place.
I'll see you around, Colonel.

"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread... till thou return unto the ground, for out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
- Unto Adam, also and unto his wife...
- Wish we had eggs. did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them.
- And the Lord God said, 'Behold,
- Behold, I don't remember what eggs are. the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand and also take, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.'
Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence that he was taken.
So he drove out the man and he placed him at the east of the Garden of Eden, cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
Step up.
William!
William.
William. William.
He managed to hightail it in there just as fast as he could.
Figured he'd wait out the storm.
But when he got inside, it turned out there was a big ol' grizzly bear sleeping in there!
Joe faced himself a dilemma.
Sure death outside... and sure death inside.
- Well, what did he do?
- Ol' Joe, he took the quicker route.
He pulled out his gun, he took a shot at the bear, but it just made him mad!
She come at him, claws a-swipin' and teeth a-snappin', and somehow- somehow
Joe managed to get himself... up on the back side of the bear, and he rolled around the cave like a buckin' bull!
And she took his scalp clean off... on the roof of the cave that day.
But you know what?
He ate her in the end.
And ever since then... he's worn his hair long.
- You know why?
- No.
In deference to the squeamish.
It was quite a fight, son.
It was quite a fight.
But there's no bears here!
Hell's full of bears, Jimmy.
But there's no bears here.
What are they talking about?
Were you told?
Your husband didn't say?
Not this time.
They're talking about whether to hang Stephen Meek.
Gately argued that Meek...
has taken us off track on purpose,
that he was hired...
to get rid of American immigrants.
So the more of us come, the more likely the territory goes American.
It has a logic.
I suppose.
A broken one.
Mr. White wasn't swayed either.
He argued for more patience.
"We're at the man's mercy now," he said.
"Meek's just made a mistake is all.
He's just in over his head."
And then what?
We were just getting into it again when Meek himself showed up.
He'd been hiding above us up there in the rocks the whole time.
So that's where he was.
He strutted into the circle with his gun in his hand.
"Well, you've found me," he said.
"Now go ahead with the killin'."
Everybody got real quiet.
It shut everybody up.
Frank Gately is happy enough to hang a man so long as he's not around.
And?
Well, Meek got to talkin'.
Of course he did.
He says that we are in Paiute country now.
He says that the Paiutes are a fearsome tribe, that they're nothing like the Flatheads on the main stem.
If we trust him to do his job, well, then he welcomed anyone to gainsay him.
- Nothing about our route.
- Nothing about it.
"Seen the elephant," my eye.
Two weeks, he said, and we'd be in the pass.
It's been over five and we haven't even seen a mountain yet.
What was the verdict?
We give a few more days.
We never should have left the main stem.
- Good morning, Emily.
- Morning.
Workin' like niggers once again.
Maybe we're back on known ground.
Oh, he was guessing.
Everyone has some luck sometimes.
Hyah.
Come on.
Made 10 miles today.
I'd say this is the best shelter we've had since morning.
The wind's not gonna be kind tonight.
It's early yet.
We won't push too hard.
I say we keep on.
The going is easy in these parts, and we should make the most of this ground while we can.
Seems to be more shelter up ahead.
Well, I'd be careful now.
This country'll play tricks on you.
That piece you see out there might be-
A whole lot farther than you think.
Guarantee it.
How far would you say?
I wouldn't say.
I just know it'll be farther than I think.
The thinness of the air makes everything look closer than it is.
There could be water though?
Yeah. Possible, I reckon.
I say we keep on.
I think I would agree.
All right. Keep moving.
Hyah.
Hyah.
Hyah.
Come ho.
Well, we'll have to water the animals from our own supply tonight.
Can't go without after a day like this.
Should've taken on more at the river.
You need to eat.
You've been working all day.
I'm fine for now. Please.
Evenin'.
- Good evening, Mrs. Tetherow.
- Mr. White.
Uh, Glory, I brought some bread to share.
That's much appreciated, Emily.
It's my pleasure.
I-I-I have stew too, if you'd like it.
I know you would.
No.
No, this is enough.
Thank you.
Jimmy.
It's like my feet have gloves, like I can- I can handle the ground that I'm walking on.
I feel the sand. I feel the dirt.
I feel the gravel.
I never slip. I never-
I don't- I never stumble.
I can follow a trail in the dark and never stray off the path.
I live with this world.
I'm not just in it, is what I'm sayin'.
But to answer your question,
Gately, the beaver, they're played out.
That's the truth.
That market's done and gone.
There's no fortune to be had there anymore.
Your man Astor got it all.
We should have made the trip earlier.
Waited too long.
No, you know, there- there are plenty of fortunes to be had.
I mean, the beaver, that's a- that's just the first gift of this land. You mark my words.
Will the territory go American?
That's what I want to know.
Well, in my- in my opinion, I-
Well, you know, it depends.
It depends on the fight... in the Americans, and in the English, and in the Indians.
I'm led to believe there's 250 Americans in Oregon country.
There's seven more argonauts comin' in a few weeks.
Maybe that'll tip the scales.
Where would you settle?
Willamette Valley.
That's where my brother Joe put down stakes.
Civilization is taking hold there.
They got missionaries in Champoeg.
Could have found God in Virginia.
Well, if it's riches you're after, there's riches aplenty.
The land you're headed for is a regular second Eden.
You won't want for riches someday.
You'll just plunge your hands into the ground.
Come to bed.
Soon.
That was my mother's.
I know.
It's only weight now.
Jimmy!
He's gone. I'm telling you.
He's abandoned us. He'll move faster alone.
It's what I'd do.
No, it's not what you'd do.
He saw the writing.
How much water you reckon?
Two days, maybe three.
Ah. He's gone by now.
He's gone by now.
There we are.
- Water!
- Amen.
Water ahead!
It's alkaline!
It's alkaline.
Whoa. Whoa.
It's alkaline.
Can't water here.
Not even the animals.
Well, then?
What now?
Well, we skirt around.
Go south till we make it around.
How far is it around?
Well, we'll find out.
Shouldn't be too far.
The maps I've seen don't record much of this.
Oh.
No.
We're not going farther south.
Well, we can't keep west unless you brought oars.
We're heading north.
Meet back with the main stem if we have to.
There's scarce grass and water up north.
South is the best bet.
Well, there's nothing where we came from either, and there's nothing ahead, so I'm saying north.
We'll move closer to the Columbia.
That way we can rejoin the communication.
I- I see your thinking.
How many days to the Columbia from hereabouts?
Well, too many.
West is the goal.
The sooner we get moving west, the better.
The quickest way west, by my reckoning- south.
Mr. Gately, do you have an opinion?
I think north too.
Well, I'm advising against that.
Now, I've been all through this country, more or less.
By God, you contracted me to get you to the Valley. I will.
We understand that, Mr. Meek.
We understand.
But you work for us, Mr. Meek.
You'll be paid.
Just, uh, we're not going around.
We're going north.
Suit yourselves.
We'll do what we do.
Two shots if we find water.
Hyah!
Mrs. Tetherow, look what we found!
What is it, Emily?
Jimmy.
So he wore clothes?
Yes.
Yes, some.
Paint on his face?
- No.
- Horse?
Uh, yes.
Was he carryin' a weapon?
A knife or a bow?
Uh... no.
No, I don't think so.
I'm not sure. I was upset.
He-He had a- a scar on his shoulder though.
Well, if he wore clothes, he's no Digger.
They're hardly more than animals.
- We're too far south for that anyway.
- Might be Paiute.
Could be Nez Perce.
He could be Cayuse.
They're from the north.
It's far west for Blackfoot, but that's possible.
And what does that mean?
Jimmy, go help your mother.
Well, frankly, I'm amazed.
Mrs. Tetherow saw this redskin and lived to tell the tale.
I mean, you rarely see hide nor hair of a hostile... till he just jumps you and cuts your throat.
They can disappear in their own shadow.
They can hide under a wolf skin so quiet, you step on 'em before you know it.
And where one redskin is, there's a dozen more just lurkin' nearby.
And they're all armed by now.
And sometimes...
I mean, sometimes they wait till they're fired on, but most of them they don't.
When they come on a woman, they kill her.
I mean, they'd never dream of sparin' a woman.
So I'm guessin' it's Cayuse.
On a horse this far north.
I mean, they roam all over the basin here, all the way down to Mexico.
They pick up slaves from the Klamaths.
They sell' em at Celilo.
We'll find out presently, I reckon.
No fires tonight.
And double watch.
- Dandy.
- Mercy.
Hell's full of Indians, my friends.
You were lucky tonight, ma'am.
Don't want a blanket.
Don't make it worse.
Cold is the least of my troubles.
Hmm.
It's only a few days north to the Columbia by my reckoning.
I been keepin' notes.
- What if we don't find water soon?
- We will.
Your optimism.
I'm sorry.
Is he ignorant, or is he just plain evil?
That's my quandary.
It's impossible to know.
We can't know.
That's very comforting, Mr. Tetherow.
Well, we made our decision.
This is all gonna be a bad dream soon.
It's gonna be a story to tell.
I don't blame him for not knowing.
I blame him for saying he did.
That fool.
Solomon?
- Dry breakfast?
- No.
Might as well eat the dust.
Ladies.
Fine morning.
I'd like to know how.
Well, not too hot. Plus smooth ground.
Could be a piece worse.
It's not today that's weighing on me.
We'll follow the land downhill.
- The water's more likely in the lower places.
- That's fine.
Heed. Stay with us.
Broken axle.
- I'm gonna bring this wheel off.
- All right.
Are those our mountains, Mr. Meek?
Oh, no. No, no.
We'll know our mountains, Jimmy.
Hell's full of mountains.
Those aren't them.
What are they?
Well, they...
They're nameless, I suppose.
We'll call 'em Jimmy's Mountains.
What do you say to that?
- I suppose so.
- Mm-hmm.
Jimmy's Mountains.
We get to the Willamette Valley,
I'll tell the cartographers.
We'll print it on the map.
Hmm?
I don't know, Mr. Meek.
You never womaned, Mr. Meek?
Indeed I have.
Numerous times.
Squaws in these parts start lookin' mighty white after 20 years' time.
Oh, dear.
Sometimes I get the sense you don't care for me much, Mrs. Tetherow.
Oh, I have no feelings one way or the other, Mr. Meek.
That's... That's just a kind way of saying you don't like me.
I don't like where we are.
So, that's what you think, that we're lost?
- I'd say that seems about the right word for it.
- We're not lost.
We're not lost.
We're just finding our way.
I certainly hope so.
We gonna make all right.
Oh, you don't need to patronize me, Mr. Meek.
Well, now I think you're flirtin' with me, ma'am.
You don't know much about women, do you, Stephen Meek?
Why, I-I know... somethin' or other.
If you say so.
Well, I know women are different from men.
I know that much.
I'll tell you the difference, if you care to hear it.
I don't doubt you will.
Women-
Women are created on the principle of chaos- the chaos of creation, disorder, bringin' new things into the world.
Men are created on the principle of destruction.
It's like cleansing, ordering destruction.
You think I'm wrong, you can tell me.
Chaos and destruction.
Those two genders are always at it.
Chaos and destruction.
Well, I don't know.
I have to think about it.
Mm-hmm.
Jimmy, I told you not to wander.
- I wasn't wandering, Ma.
- Jimmy!
- Ma, I-
- You were wandering.
If you wander again, your father will tan you.
You found this?
Just down the gully.
There's lots.
More? How much more?
Enough to fill this bucket more times than I can count.
Jimmy, you know about exaggerating.
It's the neighbor to a lie.
Look.
Hmm.
Here.
It's real, all right.
Válgame Dios.
The Lord has his plan, I'd say.
Brought us here by dark design.
Mm-hmm.
Well, let's get this done.
You can't drink gold.
Some timing.
Am I right in understandin'... that you and Mrs. Tetherow was recently hitched?
That's right.
Took you a while to get settled down,
I'd say.
Must have grown accustomed to your freedom.
I was settled before.
She passed away.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You're a lucky man though.
Found yourself a nice, young woman-
Jimmy, where are you?
- Jimmy! Where are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I saw him! I saw the Indian!
- Jimmy.
- The one with the scar!
- Where? Which way, exactly?
- That-a-way, Mr. Meek.
- How far gone?
Not a quarter-mile.
- And he saw you?
- Oh, yes.
Good boy.
Jimmy! Come here!
You mustn't wander off.
Keep on this path north.
I'll be back when I got him.
Wait. Solomon!
- I'll be back.
- Please!
I'll be back!
Well, you heard them.
We'll keep moving.
They haven't been long.
It's not been long, Henley.
What's wrong, Sylvie?
Come here.
"Behold, him that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee.
"The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee."
He's a quick one.
Might have gotten away if it hadn't been for Meek's eye.
Horse got away though.
Now, I know my word isn't worth much in these parts, but in this case I'm just as sure as sundown we kill him now.
What do you think, Solomon?
You brought him for a reason.
He's from these parts.
He's healthy.
He knows where the water is.
That's my reasoning.
He's barely clothed.
He'd just as soon die with us.
They don't think of life the way we do.
That's documented fact.
I think we need him.
I don't like it, but I see your logic.
Oh, my, don't this beat all.
You know what I've seen his heathen's brothers do?
Strip the flesh clean off a man while he's still breathin'.
I've seen 'em cut a man's eyelids off... and bury him in the sand... and leave him just starin' at the sun.
You can feed 'em. You can treat 'em to the best fixings in your lodge.
They'll turn around- Boom!
Steal your horses.
We've come to a terrible place.
What do you think?
We need water.
That much I know.
Yeah. I don't see any other way.
Can't say I do either.
Well, let's take a vote.
Who says we keep him?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Got some pumpkins.
What are they saying?
- How do we get our meaning across?
- Hell if I know.
Water.
Where's water?
Do you know water?
He doesn't know the word "water."
Where's water?
Here. Drink. Drink.
Water?
He doesn't understand.
You know the word "water," you dumb son of a bitch!
That's right, you mongrel.
- Mr. Meek!
- Get away.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
It ain't Main Street.
It ain't the village green.
Please.
Here.
Yours.
One now, for you.
One later.
Water. Us?
Blanket.
You.
Understand?
That there is the law of the land,
Mr. Meek.
Barter.
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'll take first watch.
That's fine.
Dandy.
Excuse me.
Blue Mountains out that way, eventually.
His country. About what you'd expect.
He's a killer, ma'am.
Don't get too close.
What?
Well, everything the steers have is one less thing for us.
Mr. Tetherow?
Yes, ma'am.
How much further by your calculation?
Well, it's hard to say, you know.
It's doubtful it's more than a day's journey from here.
The Indian, he wasn't carrying anything, so he can't have come far.
So we'll find water today.
It would be a day alone.
For us, it could be today.
It could be tomorrow.
What are you doing, Emily?
I'm going to fix his boot.
You shouldn't.
Well, I don't like it any more than you do.
But I want him to owe me something.
It's a pin.
For sewing.
That's nothing.
You can't even imagine what we've done.
The cities we've built.
Oh, God, the stench.
Hold on. Let me finish.
There.
How far do we have to go?
How far do we have to go?
How long?
A man-child.
How's your friend?
Wha-
About the same as the rest of us,
I'd say.
Thirsty, hungry.
I was just onto telling Mr. Gately here about the time...
I surprised a band of Blackfeet... down by the headwaters of the Missouri.
It was quite a day.
See, our group was armed, and theirs wasn't.
We pulled up, and they all just dove into the water.
We lay there on the bank... and shot 'em when they come up for air.
Passed the whole afternoon that way.
Just ducking and diving and shooting.
It was a good ol' time.
- Is this meant to bring me over to something?
- No, ma'am.
And I don't excuse what we did there that day.
You know, playing games with those men's lives.
I don't paint myself as anything but a sinner.
But your friend there-
He's worse than a sinner
'cause he don't even know he's sinning.
It's the Cayuse we're talking about-
"The People of the Stones."
Even Indians despise these Indians.
They're slave traders. They're welchers.
It's even worse.
Well, you could go your own way anytime,
Mr. Meek.
Stephen Meek does not shirk a fight.
If there's blood to be shed,
I'll be there.
- I'll put in my share.
- Vanity.
That's all I see.
Nearer to Thee
Even though it be a cross
That raiseth me
Still, all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Though like the wanderer
Millie, stay back.
Mr. Gately.
Mr. Gately, what is it?
William-
Mr. White, give me a hand.
Here. Here.
Oh, my God, I knew it.
Okay.
Oh. Look at this.
Here. This is what Millie saw him leaving behind earlier.
She saw this tonight and she came out.
What is it?
We caught him signaling to someone, leaving word behind.
I caught him myself.
Look at this. Look at this.
It means something.
He's been making them every step of the way.
- What does it mean?
- Hell if I know.
But it means something to somebody.
It's a message. Just look at it.
This is nothing. This is religion.
- It's how they pray to their gods.
- No, it's a signal.
They're out there looking for him, his kin, and he's leading them right along.
Open your eyes, Solomon.
God knows where he's taking us.
He's been walking up the ridges as if he's looking for someone.
- Finally, they're coming around.
- After all we've done?
God knows what mischief he's made already.
Millie, quiet down.
Let's hang him from the wagon tongues tonight.
It's better late than never.
- That's a message.
- No.
This is nothing.
There's no one out there.
They'd have made themselves known by now.
Go back to bed.
This will all look different in the light of day.
It's on your head, Solomon.
That's fine.
Give it another day.
Well, we'll get that blanket of yours back one way or another, my friend.
Come ha. Come ha.
Come ha.
Come ha. Come ha.
It's a sign!
A sign! A sign!
Calm down, Millie.
They made it.
- They're giving him orders!
- It's nothing.
- You'll see.
- Step up.
- We'll all see.
- Come on. Calm down.
Step up!
- Please, Thomas.
- Step up.
- Please, I wanna go home.
- Step up.
- I wanna go home.
- Step up.
Whoa! Whoa!
- What's he saying?
- Well, who knows?
He's saying we're close.
He's saying-
He's saying,
"Just over the hill. Just over there."
It's a steep grade.
Can the wagons make it?
I don't see much choice.
Well, someone could go on ahead.
It can't be far now.
They could come back and let us know what's ahead.
No. We're together.
We're- We're all in this the same.
Yeah, up to our necks.
We can make it all right.
Just go one wagon at a time.
Tighten up.
Don't put yourself out, boy.
Go find some shade.
We'll come find you when we're done.
All right. Get back up.
Ma, make some room in the wagon.
- We'll be needing to take on some weight.
- We'll make room too.
- That's mighty white of you.
- This was his plan all along.
- It's just what he wanted.
- Millie, calm down, please.
They're coming.
- They're almost here!
- Millie, calm down.
We'll make the crossing, and on the other side, we'll start fresh.
All you need is your-
All you need is your strong back.
What's in this?
Yeah, we use that.
Hey! Hey!
Put that down!
That don't belong to you!
Have some respect!
Hey! I said put that down, heathen!
I'm warning you. If you don't put that down right now, you're gonna be mighty sorry.
What does it matter?
Just let him be.
Well, it's the principle of the matter.
All right, that's it.
That's it.
You've taken us just about as far as you need to go.
End this game right now.
Put it away, Meek.
There's no need.
Oh, I see a need.
Well, you- so you got some feeling in you after all.
I'd be wary.
You people got no idea what you're dealing with here.
Well, neither do you, Mr. Meek.
You've proved that amply by now.
It seems like your woman got some Indian blood in her, Mr. Tetherow.
She's got something, all right.
Yeah, you think this heathen's as good as his word.
You got no idea what he's fixing to do.
It could be-
Who knows what's over that hill?
Could be water.
Could be an army of heathens.
Could be.
Well, maybe you'd like to wager.
Water or blood.
I'll leave the wagering to men like you.
Don't think you ain't wagering.
And you don't even know what cards you got.
That's some pumpkins.
You a lucky savage, boy.
You got a guardian angel here.
All in good time.
All in good time the cards are gonna fall.
They're gonna fall real soon.
Thank you.
Heavenly Father, we thank you for this food... and for the many mercies you have blessed us with.
We ask that you continue to protect us on our journey... and guide us as it is thy will.
In Christ's name. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
I'm just thinking of my father's pigs back home.
All safe and warm in their pens.
Emily.
Oh, William, thank you.
What do you see out there?
Hard to say.
No, there's no saying, is there?
Do you think he's trustworthy?
The Indian?
I can't... say as I do.
I trust you is all.
But you're putting your trust in him.
You're doubtful.
I have my doubts.
What are you thinking, Solomon?
I-
I just hope Meek hasn't twisted you up, is all.
Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!
He won't drink.
I've tried every day, but he refuses.
Emily, I don't know what to do.
Please. Please.
My darling, I know.
I know.
I know, I know, I know.
I know.
We're close, friend.
Stay with us.
You stay with us.
Please, please drink, my darling.
Please.
Please, William.
- Drink some more.
- Please, William.
Mrs. White, we're gonna have to make some more room in the wagon.
Of course.
Jimmy, stay with your father.
Oh, William.
Drink. There you go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Mama, a tree can't live without water.
Can it?
Thomas, we can still go back.
We can try for the Columbia.
Millie, we're close.
That's just it. We're close, but we don't know what to.
We've been through this.
We don't know, either way.
Thomas, please.
We still have a choice.
What about you, Mrs. White?
Which way does your family prefer?
We stay the course.
We don't have a choice, not that I see.
Meek?
I'm taking my orders from you now,
Mr. Tetherow,
Mrs. Tetherow.
And we're all taking our orders from him,
I'd say.
We're all just playing our parts now.
This was written long before we got here.
I'm at your command.
You, uh... speaky...
English?
Do you?
You stink.
You don't say.
Oh... think maybe you could unsnare me?
Oh... Oh.
Better untie me.
Pardon?
Ah, forget it.
God... dammit.
Where the hell am I?
- Barclay's Brush.
- Where?
In the Dominion of Canada.
- Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. Huh.
Bonjour.
How can I help you?
Bullets.
Mon Dieu, we are... we are fresh out of bullets.
Um, perhaps I could interest you in some tea?
A little, uh...
"special tea"?
- As a matter of fact, we do carry ammunition.
What calibre, sir?
- Ah-ah-ah! No poaching.
My customer, my side.
You can't talk to him.
- Oh... how clumsy of me.
I've spilled bullets all over the counter.
Good day, sir.
How can I be of assistance?
- I need cartridges,
45.40 Colt.
- That will be $1.10, or a penny a bullet.
- The thing is that I'm a lick strapped at the moment.
Maybe we could settle up this account a little later...
- Sorry, no credit.
Your rules.
Oh, I see.
Iùs okay when you break the rules.
But when I bend them just a little, we have to sever the partnership.
There is an enormous distinction between having a flexible policy on credit and contravening the law!
Prohibition, Claude, means no liquor.
- Salaud.
- Thank you very much,
Mr., um...
"The Montana Kid."
I'll show you prohibition!
Free drinks!
Free whiskey for anyone on my side...
...to some stranger who smells like he came out the back end of a pig is a retail genius!
Explain.
- He walks out that door, you never see this bum again.
I'm not partial to insults.
But...
...seeing as one of you was clearly raised by a mother of a fiercely hideous countenance,
I am affected by a rare blush of...
Put me down for three more.
And one carrot.
Son of a...
Ahem. Hey.
Ahem. Hey there, you two.
Either of you seen my mount?
Iùs a chestnut with a Cheyenne roll on the saddle.
I left him just back...
Whoa, steady on there, mister.
- You just tell me, have you seen my animal?
Jack collected a stray.
Blacksmith?
Behind you?
Thaùs my horse.
I believe he's in pain.
Reckon so. A stone bruise.
- So first you thieve him, then deliver him to torment?
I retrieved a stray.
I've shot men for less.
- You need to reign in that temper, mister.
I ain't done.
He forged that hoof.
You ain't touchin' him.
- I don't got time for a common nuisance.
- What did you just call me?
- A nuisance.
- No, before that.
What did you call me?
- Common?
- Oh... you just stepped over the line.
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What the he?
What kind of man would pick up another man?!
Hey, you! Hey!
I ain't finished with you, you big ape.
- Swear to God, I ain't got...
- What the hell?!
Get... your... gun.
I'm callin' you out.
I said I'm callin' you out.
Hey, what?
Ahem.
You mind telling that big ape in there
I'm callin' him out here.
Jack! The windmill...
Ah, there's no rush.
Iùll take a couple of days to fashion the windmill. Come on.
Jack says to tell you he can't oblige.
He's got no gun.
- He's a liar.
- Is not. The man's an ironsmith.
And he's right. You stink.
That man stole my horse.
He was trying to help.
- You tell him to get a gun on his belt.
At sundown, we'll square this up.
- He says not to be riding him for at least two days.
Sundown.
Your bottom is bleeding.
Yeah, I know.
Well, hello again.
I'd say a.36 calibre.
Am I right?
- I didn't get a good look at it on the way in.
- Well, did you get a good look at what hit you on the head?
Because that is a peevish gash.
- Ah, God! Mother of Mary! Mary!
- Well, iùs Dr. Angus Schiffron, actually.
Well, you can call me Mary, then.
- Where's my gun?
- Hold on, Tex.
I still gotta patch up that gluteus.
- Where?
- Uh, your gluteus, in your backside.
No. Where is my gun?
I appreciate you tendin' to my wounds, doc, but I ain't got no money.
- I always pull the first bullet out of a man's posterior pro bono.
Iùs a time-honoured tradition.
Now, if you just let me patch up that wound,
I can get...
- What did you do?
I had to get to your injury, eh?
You cut a man's breeches?
- Uh... uh, sir? That is not an area that braves infection with grace!
No one understands
A wanted man
'Cause you live by a code
Known by the ghosts of the dead
And you gotta keep movin'
With that price on your head
Still no time for a friend
Dammit.
Get outta my way. I'll shoot ya.
When any stranger could be the end
Move, move.
- Well, Mrs. Taylor, assembling the drive in that old windmill, it would be a chore even for a man well-versed in matters mechanical.
- If you're referring to my husband, you know he's long gone.
- No. No, no, no.
I'm only saying that iùs mechanically complex.
Perhaps you need...
- Pants! I need pants.
- Do you mind?
I'll just be a moment,
Mr. Montana.
Pardon my idiot partner's rudeness.
Can I offer you a splash of my best Scottish tea?
And some delicious ground nuts?
- We specifically agreed that I was to sell the dry goods and you were to sell...
- Boys, please,
I have to get a crop in this season.
The part will have a pointy thing that goes in here. Please?
- Very well, Mrs. Taylor.
Now, you have to give me a part name, so I know what to order.
You just need a shear pin, all right?
- Like you know.
- Yeah, I do. Now, pants.
- What kind of trousers can we order for you today,
Mr. Montana?
- Order?
No, I need 'em now.
That butcher up there cut my pants, on pro bono.
- Yes. Well, all our apparel is purchased on order.
- What the hell kinda general store is this?
They stock soap.
Soap and escargots.
Lots and lots of escargots!
- I specifically ordered tin nails and they sent me tin snails.
- So do I absolutely need a shear pin, or can I just use a nail or something?
- You could use your nose, for all I care.
- Talk has it that you're the Montana Kid.
Thaùs right.
- "Among America's most notorious gunslingers are:
Wild Bill Hickok, John Wesley Harding and the Montana Kid."
Are you that "the Montana Kid"?
I reckon so.
Says here you killed six men.
Eleven.
- You don't look like a kid.
- Nicknames have a way of sticking.
Decades, even.
Ain't that right?
I guess so.
- Is it true you're proposing a gunfight today, with Jack?
Sundown.
- Showdown with the Montana Kid!
- Right here in Barclay's Brush!
- The town hasn't seen this much excitement since Larry accidentally set fire to his prized ewe!
Can Jack duel with my Winchester?
'Cause he doesn't have one.
- Hang on, hang on!
What about mine?
Mine's practically brand new. See?
Whaùs wrong with you people?
- Yah, whaùs wrong with you?
Iùs up to Jack, no?
And he might like my shotgun best.
- Iùs not a turkey shoot.
Iùs a gunfight. He needs a pistol.
Where the hell are you from?
- Peterborough.
- Moncton.
- Uppsala.
- Any of you got a Hog Leg like this?
- Well, thaùs a cattleman's revolver, isn't it?
Ow. A Peacemaker.
An Equalizer.
A Widowmaker.
- Stop that.
- Yeah...
- Well, does anyone got one?
- Mm-hmm.
When the cowboys ride through, they have pistols. And rum.
But otherwise, um...
- No, truth is,
I don't know anyone who has, uh... uh, what do call it?
- A Peacemaker!
Stop it.
- There's just not much call for one around here.
We got rifles for huntin', shotguns for birds.
Pistols, well, they're just for... you know.
- Killing people.
Seems to me Jack not having a gun is your problem, not his.
- Oh, my problem is you.
- So why don't you just shoot him?
- Why don't I just shoot you?
Same reason.
I'm unarmed.
So that is the code, isn't it?
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm thinkin' I can make an exception.
Tell you what... shear pin,
I've got a pistol you can use.
I mean, it needs fixing, though.
The handle's cracked and the hammer's broke.
Fine.
- And you don't get it for nothing.
Deal is, you get the gun if you help me get my windmill up and running.
- Why don't you get your husband to get it up?
Do you want your showdown or not?
- Hey, you wanna go back?
By some direct conspiracy of fate, it seems you missed a bump.
Ow!!! Thaùs it!
Thaùs it! Whoa!
Whoa! Stop!
- Whoa...
Stop! Ah...
I think we'll take it... by foot from here.
Suit yourself.
Iùs, uh, just over that ridge.
And stay off that horse.
Come on, Peaches.
- What is it with these people, huh?
No sidearms, a medico who shreds your clothing, a saloon with... teacups and catalogues, and that... woman.
A mouthpiece.
Hey, I'm not talkin' to myself here.
Get up with me.
Come on.
So what do you figure?
How far are we from a real country?
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right, he'll be comin' for me.
Ten years of doggin' me - he's not gonna let a border stop him.
We'll make tracks as soon as we get things squared.
Well, you know, you're not so sweet-smellin' yourself, pal.
You got mealy old carrot breath.
Well, you do.
You stink.
Put your horse in here.
It should be safe.
Bunk in there.
There's an oil lamp just inside the door.
- Outhouse is made out of dirt.
- It was good enough for me and my husband for over a year.
- Where's the gun?
- Time enough for that in the morning.
- We had a deal and I want that gun... right now.
Keeps whaùs left of your pants on.
Here.
Thaùs bad.
Why do you even bother carrying this?
- To frighten away bothersome folk mostly.
Pistol's not just for killing people.
Iùs also real good for scaring 'em.
This isn't scary.
There was a time
When you believed
When everything
Was springtime green
Before you learned that life was mean
And nothin's
Ever what it seems
Mother of Mary.
Ow.
You sure that ain't dry?
- There's water!
Iùs just deep!
Thaùs why this windmill's gonna be a godsend!
See, I figure if we construct the windmill here, then the water'll be convenient to both the livestock and the crop.
Well, I'd... I'd put the... the windmill right here on top of the well.
Thaùd be the shorter straw, then you could pipe the water wherever you want - the house, the pens, out in the field.
- You volunteering to lay all that pipe, shear pin?
Oh, no, ma'am, no.
The deal was, just help build the windmill.
- Well, then why don't you do that and run along.
Stow your ideas.
Mouthpiece.
What... what is this supposed to be?
Meat?
Hmm.
Mm...
Argh, you know, iùs really unpleasant to sit downwind of you.
What is that stench, anyway?
- Before they got to hangin' me, they cleaned my plow pretty good.
They lashed me to a stumpin' post in a pig pen, left me there for three days, waiting for him.
Who's him?
There's a bounty on my head.
Iùs common knowledge north of the Mason-Dixon that there's a particularly hostile disfigured individual who's been huntin' for that reward for a long, long time.
So these folk thought it prudent that they'd wait, and then they would split the bounty with him.
After the lynchin', the party got bored and they kinda wandered off, then the other half decided to proceed, but they didn't know nothing about a hanging, so they picked a dead tree.
- So why is there a price on your head?
Huh?
You shoot someone who was tending to your horse?
- You shouldn't make light of what you know nothin' about.
Ow!
Shoot!
Ah... Well, good day, eh?
You, uh, hoofing all the way in from Jane's?
- Yeah. I started early.
Skipped breakfast.
Iùs funny you should mention that, because the missus would like to have you for dinner this evening.
The truth is, she is chomping at the bit to meet a bona-fide American gunfighter.
- She's not plannin' on servin' that thing, is she?
Uh, no. Uh... but I reckon...
Jane's cooking probably suits you just fine.
Shall we say 6:00?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Isn't, uh, skinnin' stuff kind of an odd pastime for a healer?
- Not really.
'Cause once a being's dead, iùs nothin' but dead.
But I suppose you know that.
- Whoa!
- Pardon me.
Oh, my, thaùs gonna leave a mark.
Hey, Mr. Montana, please, sidle on up to the counter.
Perhaps I can interest you in... this.
Iùs a, uh, full-bodied little number.
The bouqueùs a tad intimidating...
- No, I just need...
- Oh, no, no, no.
It contains laudanum, don't you know.
A couple of these, you'll be baying at the moon.
- You're selling spirits!
- Cough medication, Claude.
General stores sell cough medication.
- Idiot!
Look...
I need a part for a gun.
Iùs a hammer for a Navy Colt.44 calibre.
And I need bullets.
Not that many. Iùd be a miracle if he gets off one shot.
Yeah, showdown with a.44!
- Stop it.
- Mm...
Uh-oh.
Oh, no, gimme those.
Gimme those.
- I am warning you.
- Unarmed!
Shut up. If you step out that door...
Damn.
Just follow my finger to the...
Okay, just follow my finger to the right.
Just follow my finger to the right.
- My grandfather says he would be honoured to repair your pants.
He says you may wear a pair of his until yours are repaired.
Yeah, yeah.
Look, look.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Railroad workers.
My grandparents let them rest here between construction lines.
Giving food and shelter to these people is an honour.
They no speaky Englishy.
- My grandfather says he would be honoured if you would use this tub for bathing.
Mm.
Ahem. It is that bad, isn't it?
Never compromise a man's lifeline.
- I'm sorry!
Grandpa told me to give you food!
I thought you were asleep!
Ahem. Hey, listen, listen, kid.
Iùs all right.
Iùs all right. Honest.
Hey, look at me.
You know, that chow looks pretty good.
Do you think maybe you could get me a fresh bowl?
Ladies.
Oh, don't start.
Why are you even here?
- Standing invitation every Wednesday.
Doc tells me we're dining partners.
- Just great.
- Nice blouse, by the way.
- Okay, shut up.
Leùs get this over with.
- My mother wore something like that once.
- Very funny.
- Well, she did!
- Well, come on in.
- Yeah.
Is that a blouse?
- Be sure to save room for dessert,
Mr. Montana.
Beatrice brought a dish of her apple cobbler.
It is a treat beyond compare!
- Oh, iùs nothing.
Beth is being humble in her praise.
She's the real baker in Barclay's Brush.
Come July, when the strawberries ripen, she makes a strawberry-rhubarb pie you'd simply kill for.
Hmm.
Beatrice.
Uh, how about the question of how many men you've shot?
The Canadian Monthly specifically reports six.
- It must be so exciting, living wild on the open range, happy and free, sleeping under a canopy of stars, every moment an adventure?
- The Wild West!
- Stop it.
- Larry, we talked about this.
Please don't badger our guest.
Ahem.
Eleven.
I have killed 11 men.
And they each earned their bullet of their own accord.
I've been called out four times.
I've responded in self-defence twice.
- I think duelling is incredibly romantic!
Dear...
- Three men called me a cheat in a Kansas City card game.
And one time I came across a man beating a dog.
Bad. I mean, real bad.
Gravy?
But the first man I killed, well... the first man I killed killed my pa.
He had black eyes, black beard, black soul.
He and my pa got into it over an unbranded calf my pa knew to be his.
So they settled matters with fisticuffs and my pa gave him a whoopin'.
But as he rode away, that lying coward shot him in the back.
That is so sad!
- Yeah.
So the next day,
I rode up to his porch.
I called him out, and my first shot punched him in the gut.
Now, if you know anything about killing -
I'm sure you all do - you know that a gut shot is the ugliest way to do it. Keeps you livin' just long enough to... to experience every second of pain.
And after an hour of him kinda whinin' and moanin' and whimperin',
I had it.
So I shot him right here.
That was that.
He was dead.
- So then Jack will make it an even dozen.
He's not shooting Jack.
Yeah, I am.
I tell you what...
I'd kill for some more potatoes.
Ah... Dang.
Good morning, sir!
Ahem. Corporal J.T. Kent,
Northwest Mounted Police,
Fort McNeil troop.
And this is my liaison and guide,
K'Wala.
People call me Two Dogs.
- And?
- As per the standing directive of Her Majesty's government in the Dominion of Canada,
I am making the rounds of the southwest sector of our allotted region.
Thank you.
And?
And, as part of my rounds,
I'm under instructions to check in with all adults - men... new men... and women - and households in my zone.
So?
So.
How's it going?
- Good.
- Any problems?
- None.
- Concerns?
- No.
Ahem. Very well, then.
Sign here, please.
What is this?
- A rounds journal.
You sign it after I check in.
- You ain't from around here, are ya?
- America.
Oh... Still have to sign.
We need your true full name, please.
Mm...
- Not a smuggler, are you?
- No.
- Whiskey trader?
- No.
- Horse thief.
- No.
All right. Good day, sir.
Oh, one more thing...
Sean.
- Sean?!
How long will you be staying in Canada?
- I could leave by sundown, if you'd loan me that gun of yours for a spell.
- Regrettably, I must decline, sir.
That would be a flagrant contravention of rule number 44 of the constables' code of behaviour, hygiene and equipment care.
Thaùs, uh, rule 45, there, chief.
Okay. Thank you, K'Wala.
Ahem. Miss Taylor?
- You gotta remember to tie up your horse, there, chief.
- Okay, K'Wala, just...
Thank you.
Jonathan?
Oh... no.
Ma'am.
Sean.
Two Dogs.
Hey, Sean, break's over.
- Whoa!
Whoa! Come on! Come back!
Hang on.
Hold on. Here you go.
- I'm gonna fall!
- You won't. I won't let you.
Come on. Thaùs it.
I got ya.
See? You're gonna be okay.
Thaùs bad.
- Oh.
- Ah!
Oh, Lord.
- Ow.
- Is it broken?
Oh, I don't reckon so.
Pissing elks! It bleeding well is!
- I think I see why... you're so convinced
I won't be shootin' that hoof-shaper.
You been conspirin' to cripple my gun hand.
- If you'd been helping me like you promised,
I wouldn't have fallen.
- That what happened to your husband?
Did you accidentally kill him while he was tendin' to the chores?
It wasn't an accident.
What?
It wasn't an accident.
I thought we came out here to start a farm and a family.
Turns out that put the fear in him.
Took to wearing that gun, swaggering around like some... dime-novel jackass.
He became a horrible drunk, too.
Then, one day,
I realized I could run the farm a hell of a lot easier by myself.
So I shot him.
You shot him?
Yeah.
With his own gun.
Square in the gut.
Now, if you know anything about killing - and I'm sure that you do - you'll know that a gut shot is the ugliest way to do it.
Took him... hours to die.
Hmm...
'Afternoon, Larry!
Howdy, Jane!
Hey, Sean!
- Better hop to it if you're gonna make it by 6:00!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'll see ya there!
- Aristotle said,
"We are what we do repeatedly.
We do not act rightly because..."
- This ain't a social, this is schoolin'.
- I never said it was a social,
I said "gathering."
- And it cost you two bits you paid to listen...
- Shhh!
- Mm... What is wrong with these people?
...The very truth of who we are as people is defined by what we do again and again.
Aristotle would say that since Larry farms every day,
Larry is a farmer.
Far-mer.
Yes.
And one who teaches every day is therefore a teacher.
- Tea-cher.
Aristotle would also say it is about who we are as people.
A man might claim to be virtuous, but he is not virtuous unless he consistently acts with great virtue.
Yes, Jack.
- So leùs say a man shoots 11 men and then he says each man deserves to die, according to, um...
- Aristotle.
...A- Aristotle, is he still a common killer?
Whaùd you just call me?
- Killer.
- No, before that.
- Common.
- Yeah, thaùs it.
You just stepped over the line, again.
Outside.
Unarmed.
- What is that? You cough, you say "unarmed."
Do you think I can't hear that?
- Sean?
Is there something you would like to add to this discussion?
- Kil-ler.
- All right, stop. Thaùs enough.
Sean?
Look,
I see fit to live by a code.
By a set of unspoken laws that men - real men - understand.
Now, just 'cause I got the mettle to stand up and make things square, thaùs not a reason to brand me common,
I don't care what that book says.
- Common, uncommon; you're still a killer, and you're set on killing me.
- He's not killing anyone.
- Oh, yes,
I am.
- Oh, believe him,
Mrs. Taylor, that gun'll get fixed and he'll call me out.
And we all know damn good and well that I don't stand a chance.
He'll shoot me dead.
And there's nothing uncommon about that.
I'll just be number 12.
- Well, Canadian Monthly would technically make you seven.
- At least I know I'll be going to a better place than you'll ever see!
You don't know nothin' about me.
Darn it! I...
I can see right inside you.
Iùs as plain as that Colt you like to wear on your hip.
Gun's a magnet for death.
Hell, some would say you're lookin' to die.
Thaùs just wrong.
A gun is just a tool.
Iùs like... any other tool.
A tool designed for killin' people.
- No, iùs all what you do with it.
- Well, yes.
- But if a man walks into my shop
- Oh!
He might kill me!
- Shovel could kill you.
He could hit you on the head with it.
- Or jab you.
- You could say that about anything.
About a rock, even.
- But nobody ever comes in with a rock.
Besides, a rock is not a tool.
- Tell the Indians that.
They've been using rocks as tools for years.
- Yeah, you could smash somebody in the face with a rock.
- Or jab someone.
- Can't stab somebody with a rock.
- Tell the Indians.
They've been stabbing people with rocks for years.
- What about a rope?
Hitting and jabbing somebody with a rope wouldn't do anything.
- Don't be so sure.
- You could strangle someone with a rope.
- You could take it and rub it over somebody's eye, pushing hard.
Ahem.
Tell me somethin'.
Is this entire country insane, or is it just this town?
- Seems you have quite a history.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
You've come to run me out of town.
Mm.
- You haven't broken any laws in this country.
And as far as we're aware, there are no extradition warrants out for your arrest.
- So I'm free to go about my business?
- As for this... showdown with Jack everyone's talking about, you best know there are no duelling laws in this country.
We call it murder.
Don't you dare to even hurt her,
Mr. Kid.
'Evening!
Company's having a dance Saturday to welcome the new provincial constabulary to the area.
Opportunity to wear that lovely blue dress again, Miss Taylor.
- Thaùs so sweet that you remember, Jonathan!
Well, not something you forget.
Well, thank you, Corporal.
I will definitely try to attend.
- Okay.
Ah!
- What do you say, shear pin?
Can you dance?
- Oh. I'm sorry to disappoint, ma'am, but I intend to be a charmin' memory by then.
Hope to see you Saturday.
All are welcome.
Sir.
Just... answer... question!
Seen... him?!
Seen him?!
You find that distracting?
- Yes!
- I know I do.
I did.
Now, let me explain.
We are business folk.
We catch bad men.
And we get paid for our efforts.
That man in particular is worth a considerable sum to our enterprise.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Have you seen this man?
He say we see no one!
No one!
No one, no one...
She has.
Get her.
- Oh, yeah, Cutler's on our trail.
I can feel him.
We gotta change tack.
All right, here's the plan.
We'll ride east... and then south.
When Cutler picks up the scent, which he will, he will start northwest.
He always sweeps northwest.
Why?
Because he is stupid and he is predictable and, well... ever since I shot his ear off, he kinda... he kinda leans to the left.
What?
All right, all right, all right, all right.
We will stay just... just a little bit longer, but it has got to be said...
It has got to be said, Glue, that you are getting very soft.
I mean, very, very soft.
Yes.
You know, nothin' should surprise me around here, but that is a, uh... peculiar perch upon which to take one's evening coffee.
Ah.
You're all right?
Well...
...iùs a nice spot.
I feel safe up here.
Iùs where I'd come when Stewart got drunk.
Yes. Yeah, that part was true.
Oh.
- And when he got real mean,
I'd just pull the ladder up and wait.
He'd be too liquored to climb up after me.
In the months before he left for good...
...he'd say that I wasn't even worth the effort.
Do you like that?
Not even worth the effort to beat.
What Jack said in the schoolhouse...
Well, was he right about you?
Are you looking to get killed?
- What would one wear to a Northwest Mounted shindig?
Oh...
You look...
You look very...
The carùs ready.
You look rather presentable yourself.
But I was growing quite fond of the Oriental look.
Well, thank you.
I had to eat an entire crate of snails before Carl'd give me the loan of this.
- I don't know if that makes me flattered or alarmed.
Whoo!
Ah!
Sorry.
Pardon me.
Whoa!
Iùs my father's.
Ahem.
'Evening, Miss Taylor.
- Ah!
So pleased that you could attend.
- Why, thank you for inviting us,
Jonathan.
Us?
- - Ah, General.
- Whoo!
Oh, uh, hello, Sean.
Good that you could come.
- Aren't you lookin' right regal.
You know, iùs a particular breed of man who can carry off an outfit like that.
- Huh.
So, Corporal, did... you want to show me the dance floor?
- Iùs an old saying, but true nonetheless:
You dance with who brung you.
So, you two, please, be my guests.
We'll chat later.
Hello, Beatrice! Hello, Larry!
Oh, howdy, Jane. Sean.
Wow, aren't you two a sight.
I'm so pleased to see you both.
Iùs all I could do to tear him away from that damn stump.
Hey, American.
Oh, I see you brought your pie.
You armed?
I've got pie.
- 'Cause you know iùs against the law for a foreign national to carry a weapon in Her Majesty's military posts.
- Yeah, I heard.
Hey, whoa, mind the haunch.
- No gun.
- You know what we do to murderers who ride up into our country?
- I never committed murder against no man.
- I thought you Canadians were supposed to be polite.
Ah!
Ten hut!
Ooh.
Howdy, General.
Whaùs happened here?
- Just a little Northwest warning to our guest... sir.
- Warning? This man is under no legal restriction here.
Corporal, he's the Montana Kid.
Best send his type a clear message...
Not on my watch.
Iùs not just about rules, Jonathan.
Why don't you go cross-reference the troop manifest or... something?
- Mr. Lafferty, would you like to register a formal complaint against Constable Hughes?
I would be happy to issue a statement as your witness.
- - No. Only thing I'd like
- he hits like a girl.
Then, this unfortunate incident... is closed.
Now pick up that pie.
Ooh!
Corporal?
General?
Jonathan, come here.
- On behalf of the superintendent and all officers under his command,
I want to apologize...
I need your help here, Jonathan.
Would you, uh... take over for me?
I fear that Mrs. Taylor here will be plenty disappointed.
I banged my knee up on a little, uh... alfresco dancing lesson.
Y- yes.
Uh, yes.
It would be my honour and privilege.
Mm... Mm, laudanum.
Ma'am.
Tsk. 'Evening, Jack.
'Evening.
How goes the repairs on that old Patterson?
Iùs coming along just fine, Jack.
Hmm.
That was the most fun I've had in a long, long, long, long...
...time.
You know, you are looking pretty spry for someone with a... banged-up leg.
Hmm.
Ooh.
- You know, what you did back there was very kind.
Some might even say... it was noble.
Again, I, uh...
...I wanna thank you for inviting me to your stomp.
I should tend that horse.
You're unarmed,
Montana Kid.
Ahem. Jane...
...you don't wanna start this.
- Yeah, I do.
I think iùs best that you yield, and take it... like a man.
Ah... g'day, Sean.
- Are you really tryin' to get rid of that big old beast, or you just dodgin' the missus?
I've been keen to get rid of her.
The stump, I mean.
- Oh.
Think I might be able to give you a hand with that.
Ah, thanks, Sean.
Yeah... Hell, yeah.
That would be greatly appreciated.
- Good morning, Sean.
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, Sean.
Great fun last night.
But it looks like they took your gun at the fort.
Iùs a shame.
- Uh, no, they didn't, actually.
I guess I just forgot to strap it on.
Jack.
Hoof looks good.
'Afternoon, Miss Alice.
Good day, Jack.
We are what we do, Sean.
A blacksmith smiths iron.
I...
I made dinner.
I thought maybe... we could eat in my cabin.
- No, thank you.
I'm gonna be ridin' out in the morning.
I thought that maybe...
...you'd wanna stay a bit.
You thought wrong.
Everyone around here did.
We had a deal.
Hey!
You get your gunfight after my windmill is up and running.
You tell me why.
I mean, why can't you just... let it go?
'Cause I can't.
'Cause if I let it go now, then...
I shoulÔve let it go when them three guys in Missouri called me a cheat.
And you tell me, they died for nothing?
And if I let them guys in Missouri go, then...
I shoulÔve let it go when that man was whuppin' that dog.
Now, does that sound right to you?
Beatin' on a helpless dog?
If I was able to let that man go for beatin' on that mutt, then...
...there sure as hell is no reason...
I couldn't have just walked away when I was called out in Wyoming, or Santa FÈ and... twice in Arizona.
If I was so damn smart to walk away when I was called out, then I shoulÔve had the wherewithal to not use my gun in self-defence - twice.
And if I shoulÔve been able to avoid that, then there's no arguable reason why I couldn't have just gone to the sheriff... instead of killin' that man that whupped my pa.
I thought he shot your pa.
Just beat him up.
Broke his jaw and a bloody nose, but...
"Taught a common thief a lesson," he said.
How do you like that?
Common.
He was anything but common.
He was my pa.
When I shot that man...
...like it or not, this is my path.
This is what I do.
And I am what I do.
'Cause it can all be lost
In the blink of an eye
Iùs the longer years gun by your side
There's a tombstone waitin' with your name inscribed
But they'll never take you
Alive
Under those wild mountain skies
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.
- Hi, Sean.
Your clothes look nice.
Oh, Miss Adell,
I reckon we're lookin' at the Montana Kid.
Get it on your belt.
You go home.
- But... why?
I said go home now.
All right.
- You did a hell of a job,
I'll give you that.
This was a mess.
Put it in your belt.
When you pull back, don't jam your thumb in the hammer.
You'll blow your nuts off.
Sage advice, but I don't think that...
I said get in the house now!!!
Just plain mean, you son of a bitch!
Yeah... now you're gettin' in the spirit.
All right... throw down.
You'll kill me.
I said draw, Jack.
Well, what about Jane?
Look about you, Jack.
People around here been hankerin' to see a man shot dead in the street.
Best not disappoint. So... pull your weapon.
Pull it.
Pull it.
Point it!
Cock the hammer.
Cock that gun, or I swear the next one'll blow your head off.
Pull it.
Do it!
Do it!!!
- I am!
Pull it harder!
I am! Iùs stuck!
Goddamn.
It was workin' fine last night. I don't...
The short stroke?
Did you pull the hammer all the way back?
- Yes.
- Well, maybe...
Sometimes these conversions, they get kinda fiddly.
Get all grimed up, you know, with...
- Oh!
- Oh, there we go.
Ow.
Ooh.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
- Ooh.
Oh...
Ow!!!
- There's more in there.
Bullet fragmented.
- I'm really sorry, Jack.
Doc! What happened?!
Oh, thank God. I thought you...
You shot Jack?!
You no-good, poxy, bilious...
Ja...
...son of a weasel!
Whoa!
Hey! Just... Hey...
Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop it.
This was an accident.
- An accident?
- Yeah.
Oh, thank God.
- Oh, yes, imagine my relief at being shot in the ass - by accident!
- Wait a minute.
This puts you square with Jack.
Code-of-the-West-wise.
Mm, I suppose so.
- Suppo... You suppose?!
You shot me in the ahhh!!!
What?
What is it?
Horses and guns.
Thaùs bad.
- Who is it?
Do you know them?
- Ben Cutler, bounty hunter, murderer, tenacious bastard.
I'm surprised you haven't read about him in Canadian Monthly.
- There's four of them, you damn fool. Are you that good?
- I don't know...
- - Run.
I want you to go. Please.
Please.
- Alrighty. Give me 15 minutes and send them in the same direction.
I'll lead them outta here so far, they won't come back.
And don't leave this house.
Come on, you deaf mule.
I'm doing the clicking thing.
Come on.
They're lyin'.
Montana Kid was seen wearing Chinaman clothes.
Get outta here, both of you!
He's here all right, Ben.
Name's written in this here book.
All right...
No more lies.
Where is he?
- Go...
- Where is he?!
Spit it out!
Jane! D-don't!
We are business folk.
And I will not abide...
...by anyone's purposeful undermining of our venture.
So I'll start with the Chinaman.
If I don't get satisfaction, we will work our way through his family, one by one, until I do.
Question is plain.
Where's the Montana Kid?
Kick it.
Anyone touches that chair, and I'll put a bullet in your other ear!
Calm down, there, ma'am.
He's long gone. Days ago.
Why don't you go back from where you came?
She's lyin'. Kick the chair.
Don't!
I count four, Ben.
You want gunplay?!
Is that what you want?!
I will bleed this town till I find him!
Oh no.
Ben!
No more.
It ends here.
Doc, Jane, everybody - put your guns down.
We can do this!
There'll be no more killin'.
Not one shot.
I'm going with you.
- We-we can't let you do that, Sean.
- Yes, you can.
I've run long enough.
I've seen enough blood spilled on my account.
You tell your boys, Ben, we're done.
Done shootin'.
I'm comin' with you.
- Iùs a trick.
Get the leg irons.
Doc?
Well, Jane, he... he wants to go, eh?
- Okay, then. On the count of three, everyone lowers their weapons.
One...
...two...
...three.
Whoa!
Whoa! Cease fire!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!
Cease fire, I said!
Cease fire!
Hold it! Cease fire!
Three! I said three!
No, no, no!
Down, down!
Go around! Get behind him!
Rats. Sean!
Sorry!
Here he comes!
Oh! Damn!
Grandpa!
Sean!!!
Stay back.
Just... hold it!
I have gone to considerable effort here to head off any killin' today.
Ben, we been doin' this for too long.
Ten years - too long.
Me chasin' you, you chasin' me, and, well, me...
...shootin' that ear of yours almost clean off your head.
- I'm disfigured!
- Yeah, I... I know. I'm sorry.
But, you know, whaùs done is done.
Enough's enough.
Except if you kill her, you know damn well
I'll shoot you dead.
And I... I really don't want it to come to that.
Uh... you know, I'm... trying to... to change, to not be doing these... the things that I used to do the way I did them and to try and... change into becomin' that person that I'm gonna...
What?!
Forget it.
Iùs complicated.
And you...
You pull that trigger, and you'll pray you never did.
Killin' a man's not something you can undo.
Iùll eat at you.
Till you hate everything about that one moment in time.
Including me.
I couldn't live with that.
So please...
- You ain't worth the bullet.
- Oh, ho-ho.
She is most definitely worth a bullet.
- Hey!
- No, I didn't mean that way...
- You, on the other hand, are worth 4,000 dead or alive!
This time I think it prudent...
...to go dead.
Oh! Christmas crackers!
You supposin' we're square now?!
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon so.
Good.
Now you can finish patchin' up my whatchamacallit.
- Gluteus.
- Damn right. Come on.
Huh?
Ah, the gunfight?
You had the gunfight!
Ah, no! Would you?
I missed it! I missed it!
Son of a!
- Each of you has a writ of expatriation and a notice of intent to charge and detain.
Writ of what?
- It means I will graciously escort your smelly hides out of the country, and if you even think of returning, will show you one of Her Majesty's... hoosegows!
Whaùs a hoosegow?
Shut up.
- Hoosegow.
What the hell's a hoosegow?
Ahem.
Ahem-hem-hem! Mm.
Thank you.
- I guess this is the part where you become a charming memory.
Not quite. Uh... turns out there's a fair bit of debt that has to be satisfied before I can leave this, uh... this town.
I owe for... nine bullets, one teacup, one shear pin, one case of snails, one carrot, laundry and sewing services...
...four horseshoes, one portrait of a ugly lady, one bag of cats...
Wait a minute.
Oh, thaùs oats.
One gluteus bullet extraction - mine was gratis, but not Jack's, apparently - and, uh... the repair of roughly 100 bullet holes.
- It could take some time.
- Mm-hmm.
Frankly, I don't see how I got saddled with the cost of the shear pin.
Iùs your windmill.
Yeah!
Do I still get your horse?
What is wrong with you people?
Don't let the darkness
In your head
All the love you meant to share
You shared
All the tears we'll never hear
And all the dreams that disappear
Sometimes you feel so alone
In the shadows of regret...
Hey!
Click! Click!
Come here to me, horse.
Fuck you, horse.
...In your head
A Peacemaker.
An Equalizer.
A Widowmaker.
- Stop that.
- A Peacemaker...
Yeah, an Equalizer.
The... the... the... the, uh... the Womanizer.
- Yesterday, I lost my hat, so this is no fuckin' good.
What the hell?!
Another fucking dust storm!
- I'd like to kill you, but I cannot see you!
- And they each earned their bullet of their own accord.
I said that weird, like with almost a Martian accent.
- That would be a fragrant contravention of rule 44 of the constables' code of behaviour, hygiene and equipment care.
"Fragrant" contravention?
- You want the damn showdown, or not?
Hmm.
What were all those other lines?
- You could strangle someone with a rope.
Yah. Or pull them to the desert.
Mm. Tie 'em to a bed.
Fuck!
...All the pain thaùs messin' up your mind
Makes you feel like
Leavin' you behind
Sometimes you feel so alone...
Fucking fuck.
I heard that, Paul.
This is my path.
This is what I do.
And thaùs his path.
Thaùs what he does.
What he eats, he shits.
He's a horse.
I am a man.
I have a gun.
I do different things.
I kill people.
I shit, too, but I don't do it the same way.
I don't even lift anything, I just... have a bowl I sit on.
Sometimes just out in the field is where I'll shit.
You lost your carrot?
You lost your rabbit?
...Don't let the darkness
In your head
Ooh...
Don't let the darkness
In your head
All the songs you meant to sing
You did
Don't let the darkness
In your head
All the love you meant to share
You shared
CNST, Montreal
Gimme some water, Jack!
What for?
In less than an hour, they'll burn you to ashes.
And believe me, nothing's gonna stop your mouth from becoming dry.
- You're getting excited, Jack!
- Not hardly.
I've seen ordinary scum like you every day.
So that's why you're personally watching me?
- What did you want, water?
- Yeah.
They're ready.
Back off! Way off!
Careful, boy!
Move it! Move!
Men! Today I give you the pleasure, of turning this, scumbag of an outlaw into a hunk of meat.
Once upon a time a great gunfighter, who was brought to his knees by a slut, a common whore!
Any last words of wisdom you would like to share with us?
Yeah. If you have the opportunity to shoot somebody - shoot, and don't speak.
Men!
Ready your arms!
Aim!
- Fi...
- Don't fire!
- Guns down!
- What?!?
Guns down!
Mister Young is with us now.
- Are you crazy?
- I will report you to the Governor!
- Feel free to join us upstairs.
The Governor is here?
Come in Mister Young.
Who invited you to the party?
I'm just here to give you a little going away present.
Looks more like a "welcome back" present.
Who do I have to kill?
- Matthew Saberneck.
- Is he really too much for all your little boys?
My organisation doesn't rely on mere Manpower.
My biggest weapon is information.
By combining logic with seamless data, the outcome of all things can be predicted.
The fact that you are standing here in front of me right now, is proof of my methods.
Uh-huh.
Seems to me that Saberneck's death is worth a little bit more than just my life.
I must confess, from what I've seen so far,
I'm not convinced of your legendary status.
I'm sorry to put you to the test Mister Young.
But a legend is not valid fact.
It is made up of myth, word of mouth and exaggerations.
That's why I came here...
I need valid facts to run my organisation.
Regarding your concerns about mister Saberneck's life... maybe a little silver could make up the difference?
500 now, and 5000 when you get the job done.
- I thought he worked for you.
- He did.
Didn't work out, huh?
I think Jack needs some water.
His ranch is behind a small town called China.
Just drive out to Liberty and continue south-west.
You'll find it right there behind some hot springs.
And Mister Young...
I believe you'll be requiring this.
And don't forget Mister Young:
I have my people everywhere.
I'll be in your office in
Liberty in three days.
Have my money ready.
You didn't say anything about HER?
Clayton Young isn't one of your men, Marshal.
He would never kill a woman.
Does Matthew Saberneck live around here?
- Who wants to know?
- The name's Clayton Young.
- I'm an old friend.
- Just down the road.
- You Matthew Saberneck?
- Come forth!
That's enough!
Put your hands up, Mister Young!
Now get off the bike.
Take off your gun!
- I don't take off my gun for anyone.
- Take it off, or I'll take you off at the neck!
Other hand!
Lay that thing down.
Now come on over here so I can watch you!
- You're pretty careful!
- Yup.
- How do you know who I am?
- What are you doing 'round these parts?
Just passin' through.
Can I put my hands down now?
- Nice place.
- Now what do you want?
Truth be told... 
I'm leaving these parts for good.
And I just wanted to see the last great gunfighter in person before I go.
You mean, I'm gonna be number one again?
Alright....
C'mon, let's go wet our tonsils!
- You know, I'd kill any man who took my guns from me.
- I know.
Yeah well you know, one of my biggest mistakes was to let Charles Renardo draw first on me.
Hell, I don't even remember what we were arguing about...
Say...
When'd you find your interest in farming?
Farming? Me?!?
Well actually I'm not THAT interested in farming...
Hi! Just been thinking about you!
This is Naina, my wife.
This is Clayton Young,
Clayton will be staying for dinner.
An old friend of yours.
- An old friend of yours.
- No, actually we just met.
I see.
Pleased to meet you.
You know, sorta on accounta her...
I pretty much changed my whole way of life.
She's still not happy.
Keeps talking 'bout her family back east.
- What about you?
- I figured I'd head down to the southern sands.
Oh, joinin' the search for paradise!
- Well good luck.
- Matt?
If the gentleman's staying for dinner, you want to kill a rabbit?
Yeah, sure.
Wanna wash up?
- Wanna wash up?
- Yeah.
Quiet out here.
- Quiet out here.
- Yeah well I've had enough excitement for one lifetime.
Just one fight left ahead of me.
- Just one fight left ahead of me.
- With whom?
The Governor seems to think I stole from him.
That's the first time I hear you being called a thief.
So what's this really about?
- Are you coming to bed, Matthew?
- Get in the house, woman!
Ain't you got no shame?
She's used to being alone out here with me all the time...
Listen I'm sorry, all I got to offer you is the barn.
The barn's better than what
I've had the last couple days...
- The barn's better than what I've had the last couple days... - Good enough.
Yeah it's been a real nice evening,
I enjoyed your company.
- You have a good night.
- Good night.
Night, see you in the morning.
Who's Mister Young?
He's a gunfighter.
Probably the best around.
- Probably the best around.
- Even better than you?
He's come to kill me Naina.
Sent by the Governor.
- Sent by the Governor.
- Then why are you letting him stay?
Because... If he's ready, it don't make no sense to hide.
Tomorrow I'm gonna take him to the woods to find out.
Morning! Sleep well?
Like a log.
Sorry, seems I'm getting a little jumpy in my old age.
You're still pretty fast.
I never was that good with a hand gun...
I never was that good with a hand gun...
Come on, I set us up some breakfast.
I'll clean up and be right there.
You're pretty calm, knowing the
Governor is coming after you.
I never did learn how to run.
Besides, this is my land...
I ain't gonna budge for him!
What about her?
Ain't he gonna kill her too?
No. It's her he's after.
But I'm not gonna make it easy for him.
I used to work for that sunovabitch.
'Bout five years ago, I had to kill a whole family.
Right down to their cats, and their dogs, and their chickens.
Guess it's my turn now.
You sure do take care of that cannon.
- You sure do take care of that cannon.
- Oh yeah. Heh.
It's been a good ol' gun for me...
Damn thing'll take your arm off at a mile.
I can see now why you feel more like the hunter than the hunted.
Yeah.
Well. Let's go bag us some dinner!
I think I smell a rabbit!
You go down that way, send it up to me...
I'll be waitin' over there!
No need for me to have a gun, right?
Smart boy. Now get movin'!
Hold it right there!
Hold it right there!
Matt! I've got that sunovabitch!
Gimme the gun before I blow your brains out!
This is Virgil, Mr Young...
One of my former students.
And this... this is Duke!
This ain't what it looks like.
- This ain't what it looks like.
- It sure is.
If you have to shoot somebody Mr Young, you shoot me.
He's one of the Governor's!
I had just lost him there for a second!
Now hold on there boys!
How come you didn't tell me
'bout this gun?
Like I told ya...
Like I told ya...  I'd have to kill any man who took my guns from me!
So he did.
Come on Clayton, I want you to meet the rest of my little family.
This is Johnny...
- This is Johnny...
- And you're Clayton Young?
He sure as hell is!
This young woman here is Barbara... there's no one better with a blade.
Nice to meet you.
And this here... is Virgil Junior!
How a man knows, what's inside a woman's stomach,  I'll never understand.
It's simple, he put it there, that's how!
It's simple, he put it there, that's how!
Hey, you keep those remarks to yourself.
Right. Like you'd know anything about that.
Wait a minute you two, don't start that.
Come on Clayton, let's go have a drink.
Sit down.
So you taught those kids?
Not the singing part.
Oh yes. Barbara!
The Governor wanted me to make my own unit.
So he had their parents killed, and brought'em to me.
So he'd their parents killed, and brought
'em to me. I couldn't leave 'em.
Anything wrong?
No.
Just getting ready.
I'm leaving in the morning.
What changed your mind?
I got to know you.
Well... What do we do now?
I leave, and you take care.
What happens to you?
Who'd they send to get me? You?
No probably just some ordinary man...
Who's morals wouldn't keep him from shooting you in the back!
- Shit! One more time...
- Alright, alright
Ready, set, go!
- Damn it!
- See? I hit it!
Right... this time I'm gonna get the one on the left!
I gave her a little polish.
I can see you don't believe in rust.
So you can shoot straighter.
Oh. By the way.
Yeah?
It was a fine party.
Sure was!
Real nice sendaway for Clayton!
- Sendaway?!?
- Yeah...
He'll be leaving first thing in the morning!
Seems like we been here before.
Throw me my pants!
I can't get that old thing to work...
I can't get that old thing to work...
Sure you can.
I'll fix us some breakfast.
Let's go back to bed...
You've been with him, haven't you?
You've been with him, haven't you?
YOU'VE BEEN WITH HIM, HAVEN'T YOU?!?
It wasn't his fault!
He's getting away! HE'S GETTING AWAY!
I killed my husband!
I killed my husband! He found out about us and started beating me.
He was going to come after you...
He was going to come after you...
I didn't mean to kill him!
A man's life for another man's moment of weakness?
That hardly seems like a fair trade.
What am I going to do?
- What am I going to do?
- It's your call...
I guess you can't stay here.
Will you take me to Liberty?
You got any money?
I've got his rifle...
He told me once, it was worth a hundred silver...
Alright, I'll take it.
- Alright, I'll take it.
- And you'll take me!
I had a feeling you'd be trouble.
I told you, you can't trust that darned Clayton Young!
I chased him from district to district for a year, and you just give him back his guns.
Are you implying that you mistrust my judgement, Sheriff?
Well, he did kill two of my scouts so far.
Has the thought occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, he doesn't like your men?
And to tell you the truth,
I couldn't blame him either!
Governor! Sir!
You cannot keep on contracting outsiders.
It will weaken the men's morale.
Thank you for your assessment, Marshal.
Clayton Young is not an outsider, he's an outlaw!
I meant "thank you" as in "get lost".
The killing of our scout proves one thing:
That Clayton Young is on his way here.
I've met this man, and he won't be able to resist getting his hands on 5000 silver.
Is that clear enough?
This meeting isn't over yet!
What was it?
"Get lost", was it?
Oh. Well if my recruiting techniques aren't to your liking...
... perhaps we can put your son in our
Spartan-Programme, Jack.
Did you know he fathered a boy 14 years ago, and he "forgot" to inform me?
Well nothing evades my knowledge, you should know better than that, Jack!
Mister Lafort... please... please don't
Have your wife deliver the boy to the barracks in a fortnight.
Or I'll have some of the Marshal's unit make her.
And as for that Matthew Saberneck...
... I bet he's dead already.
This is the last stop before Liberty.
Do they know you here?
Matthew always went with the boys to get supplies. They never took me.
Good.
I only need to rest for a few hours...
Then we can go on.
We're having a meal and a bath.
Then we're leaving.
I don't want to be a bother.
To late for that.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Excuse me, my husband must be resting.
Can I help you?
Yeah. I need a room for me and...
Your wife.
This way.
The room is three silver in advance.
Half a silver extra for the bath.
Dinner is eight o'clock.
One silver each.
Take ten.
Take ten.
And forget you ever saw us.
I've already seen you.
That's why you keep staring at me?
Come here.
What for?
This is the honeymoon suite.
So much for a short break.
You're the only man I've been with... apart from my husband.
What about the Governor?
When he heard about me, he came east...
He took me from my parents.
Kept me as some kind of trophy.
He "heard" about you?
It's these stupid things they say because of my eyes...
A blue-eyed Indian girl is kind of a collector's item...
I'm one in a billion.
It's said that the man I fall in love with will become invincible.
Now I understand.
- Now I understand.
- Exactly.
The Governor never touched me...
So that I would fall in love with him.
No, not that...
Now I understand how truly crazy that guy is!
Thanks.
- Morning, Virgil!
- Morning.
- What can I do for you?
- I'll take ten of those chemical torches please.
Yes. It's five silver then.
- Did your husband fix any breakfast?
- Yes, right now.
I'll take some eggs and coffee.
Just eat your breakfast.
Mister Young!
Already on the road again
Morning.
Where's Matt?
Back at his place...
We're just taking a little trip.
I killed him! It was an accident.
If that be the case, I'm taking you back.
Sorry. She's coming with me.
This ain't your affair, Mister!
Either I take her, or I'll have to draw on you.
I wouldn't.
You got a wife, and a kid on the way.
They need you a lot more than
Matt needs her now.
It's suicide boy.
It's suicide boy.
I can't help that!
That's enough, boy!
Let's go.
Not so fast, bigmouth!
LOOK OUT!
Stupid.
Go check it out!
It's the coroner from China station!
He didn't stand a chance.
It's Virgil!
Who dunnit?
Clayton Young.
Aww, to hell with it!
Come on you guys!
Matt!
You ain't finished!
He ain't going anywhere.
Sorry.
What are my choices?
You could teach in a school.
Or I do know a whorehouse you'ld work at.
Or I could get married again!
I think it's better not to rely on people or things you can lose.
You never needed anyone?
No. And I prefer to keep it that way.
So you're telling me, you don't need me tonight?
Well, the nights do get cold up in these parts...
Looks like they cleared out.
Yeah... but not before getting to know each other real well!
Take it easy on him, willya?
I've never seen him upset like that.
They might already be in Liberty!
It's better if we're not seen together.
You go to the hotel!
On foot?!?
Have a nice walk!
Didn't I tell you I didn't want to be...
Oh, Mister Young!
Your punctuality matches your reputation.
Saberneck's dead, where's my money?
Since you killed my scout,
I would need some proof.
I got his rifle.
Not good enough.
The girl?
She wasn't part of the deal.
I'll send someone to check on Saberneck.
Come back again here tomorrow.
You better have my money ready.
- This damn thing!
- Damn!
Pull up over at the pond! Hey Duke!
Pull up over at the pond!
Gimme the water bottle.
Ain't you gonna save your bullets for that whore?
Everything okay?
- Everything okay?
- He's gone crazy.
Yeah, probably.
Spread out!
Be careful, it could be a trap.
What are you doing?
The wind is coming from the east!
Are you saying I should've smelled her?
I did.
I hope you don't mind...
I ordered for you.
So...where are we going tomorrow?
Your bus leaves in the morning.
But I want to go with you.
Wouldn't work.
- Wouldn't work.
- Why not?
Because I finally realised how things really are.
How are things?
I'm a Gunfighter.
Anyone I ever care for, dies.
That's a lie! You could quit.
Like Matt?
We'll go somewhere they don't know you.
You live the way you do because you want to.
You're afraid to care about anything.
You know... my father didn't have any money...
My mother's parents they had lots of money, but they wouldn't give him any.
So my mama took poison to scare'em...
See, she didn't want to die, but she died anyway.
My father left... I stayed with my grandparents, until my dad come back to take revenge.
When the shooting stopped, there's just me left.
So I took the guns and the ammo from their bodies, and I went just as far away as I could.
But that's the past!
But that's the past!
We're here together, right now...
Look at me. Look at me!
Do you love me?
Yeah.
Then I will not let you ruin our only chance!
There! There he is!
- There! There he is!
- Get him!
Fire at will!
Concentrate fire on Saberneck!
- Concentrate fire on Saberneck!
- I guess he's not gonna pay now...
Give him cover!
Cover, you guys!
What the hell are you doing man,
I thought you'd cover me!
- What the hell are you doing, I thought you'd cover me!
- Man, I thought you're supposed to cover ME!
We gotta go!
- We gotta go!
- What's going on out there?!?
It's Matt...
Matt's guys are here, and they're after us, so we gotta go!
NOW!
I'll get the bike.
Get back! It's not safe
Clayton! Are you still with me?!?
Yeah.
You got'em there!
Matt?
Matt?!? Matthew!
What... What are we gonna do now?
We bury Virgil...
If me make it outta here alive.
Just an ordinary man... who's morals wouldn't keep him  from shooting you in the back.
He's dead alright...
He's dead alright... Now all I need is that damned Clayton Young.
Send some scouts after them!
Yes, Sir. They won't know they're being watched.
Ashes to ashes, you bloody traitor...
Now nothing can stop me...
She's all mine.
Like hell she is!
You're nothing but a dog...
I made you a dog of war...
You sat on your land like some stubborn guard dog...
I'll put you down like a dog as well!
Matt!
Where're we going now?
We'll head South.
To the sands?
No one's made it over the mountains!
Without the money, it's gonna be even harder...
What money?
WHAT MONEY?
Stop the bike! Stop the bike!
It's true!
You made a deal with the Governor?
You came to kill my husband!
Listen!
I was only gonna get the money we 've gotten anyway...
Because YOU killed him, remember?
I didn't mean to kill him!
I loved him!
You have a funny way of showing it!
I was only gonna get the money so we could make the escape together, you know?
There's a smuggler's hideout in Carpenter Valley.
There's tracks there heading in every direction.
And there's fuel.
I always wanted to head back east...
Back to my people.
You'd like their ways!
I don't like nobody's ways but mine.
Let's go.
We gotta get you to a doctor!
I'll be alright.
You been shot!
You been shot!
Yeah, well...
Don't you remember that Mexican guy?
I think his name was Tequila?
Yeah...? Yeah well he got shot up a lot worse than that.
Didn't he die?
Yeah... But I ain't got time to die.
I been shot in the exact same spot before, must've been only scar tissue came out.
So you go on up front and keep following that trail.
Go on!
We have confirmation that they're heading for the base in Carpenter's Valley...
Governor.
Should we deploy the troops?
Are you sure of the identity of our prisoner?
Definitely. By the looks.
We won't be needing any troops then.
Sir?!?
Indulge me.
Welcome back to the pen, Barbara.
I had imagined you turning into more of a lady.
It's been a while, I still know everything about you.
You don't know more than the shit you are.
I must admit, I was filled with some fatherly pride, when I learned that you and
Virgil had become engaged.
And even more than that, when I learned that you had become pregnant.
I don't give a damn about that baby!
Don't tempt me, Barbara!
And there's no need to be cursing.
You have my full sympathy.
I just want to know what happened to my loved ones, just as yourself.
My loved ones?
You mean my parents that you killed, and my brother you dumped god knows where?
So that's how you remember it?
What are you talking about?!?
I didn't have to kill your parents to get you; they sold you to me.
No.
I paid your parents, and turned to leave... but they were surprised.
They thought the amount I had given them was for both of their children.
But unfortunately, your brother just didn't have your eyes.
So you...
...you just took him to the...
...just took him to the...
Do you think that this is easy for me?
I take no pleasure in my actions!
There have to be sacrifices to keep our people alive.
But as a show of my good intentions, let me clear up the rest of your family history.
Marshal!
This is the keeper of the China Inn.
Please, tell this young woman everything that you have witnessed.
Your husband came to buy some chem torches, just as Mister Young had finished his breakfast.
When he recognised Virgil, he shot him without warning.
Go ahead, Mylady...
Tell this poor woman the whole, sad truth.
His first shot only got him in the gut...
Moaning in pain, Virgil slid to the floor
Mister Young just laughed at him, and then he shot him in the hand.
The woman who was with him screamed to stop, but he went on.
He shot him in the feet, in one arm...
...and...
...he even shot him in the...
STOP!
I do imagine, you would like to kill that Mister Young...
Hand me the rifle.
It's all clear.
Where's my lockpick?
Don't move!
This whole place is rigged!
What?... with Mines?!?
Yeah, with mines.
Why didn't you tell me? Clayton!
Try to get some rest.
I'll head back up the trail to cover our tracks, and refuell the bike.
The sun will be up soon...
Yeah, there's not much time...
Make the most of it!
Was hast du? Ist doch nur dein Ehemann!
Shit!
Damn it.
- Damn it.
- I'm going in!
Barb?!?
Barbara, what are you doing?
Im gonna kill that fucking sunovabitch!
STOOOP!
To hell with it!
BARBARA! NOOOOO!
Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
- Bastard!
I'm alright, go for it!
Oh no bitch, you ain't going nowhere.
Back off, slut!
- Back off, slut!
- Johnny?!?
This is all because of your whoring!
But Matt already got your stud in the arm, and now he's finishing him off!
Oh yes... Why the tears?
I'm here!
Wait up, Duke!
There's a whiteout coming up.
You mean we won't find him in there?
He won't find himself in there!
He'll be going Snowblind.
Come on.
What is going on here?
Get off'a her!
That's what whores are made for!
- That's what whores are made for!
- WHAAAT?!?
Matt! You're killing him!
You're alright?
- You're alright?
- Not for long she won't be!
Pack your things. We're going home.
Probably just some ordinary man...  Who's morals wouldn't keep him from shooting you in the back!
You're a coward!
You're afraid care about anything!
From what I've seen so far, I'm far from convinced of your legendary status, Mister Young!
You will die alone, like you have lived alone.
And you sort my Sword out... make sure you don't mess it up this time!
Sir! Clayton Young blew that pregnant lady to pieces.
He was wounded, and disappeared in a whiteout.
And Saberneck took off with his woman.
Your woman! I meant, "your woman", Sir!
This is just what I predicted.
Matthew Saberneck is a slave to his principles,
So he will return to his land.
But only this time, I'll be waiting for him.
You mean you want to come with us on this mission?
Of course.
I want to be close when we kill them off.
We're gonna kill all of them?
NO, you imbecile!
And for every bruise that she gets, you will lose a limb!
Permission to speak, Sir.
- Permission to speak, Sir.
- Speak all you want, Marshal.
Permission to speak freely, Sir!
Always hiding behind that mask of military bullcrap, aren't you Philipp?
I have become that mask, Sir.
It enabled me to do all you ever asked of me.
And after all that killing, and all that slaughtering, you're suddenly afraid of Saberneck?
All I can say Sir, is that YOU should be afraid.
We will send three units.
We will send three units. And Jack, you take care of that damned Clayton Young in the meantime.
Well, how am I supposed to find him?
He definitely ain't no slave to principle.
No, but he's a slave of his habits.
So there's only one place he's going to be!
Round the front, cowboy!
Kassie, open the door!
Clayton! We heard you was dead!
Come in!
Don't take this the wrong way Chili...
I just don't think I'm in the mood.
I heard you tore up the town for some girl...
Yeah, guess so.
Must be one hell of a lucky girl then.
Nevermind me.
Boy, wait!
What was it you said?
If I can shoot, shoot... and don't speak.
So you cheated death again, huh?
They are coming!
Should we deploy the troops?
Keep them hidden!
Keep them hidden!
Nobody fire a shot until they're on foot
We'll be home soon.
It's not my home. Not anymore.
I want you to forget about that...
Woman.
I never meant to hurt you!
Well you damn near killed me!
I really made a mess of everything.
Wait! Wait!
Sharpshooter!
It's got to be that damned Clayton Young then!
We're losing to many men!
- We're losing to many men!
- Let's lose some more then.
Send in the next unit!
Aww shit!
One hell of a homecoming!
Gimme a break!
Make your peace, little man!
I made mine. What about you?
I am ready!
Damn! We're out!
This hasn't turned out well!
This hasn't turned out well!
I can't even see that sunovabitch!
Won't you please go and kill them!
Matthew Saberneck!
Don't shoot... You win, old man!
I'm the only one left!
You gotta be crazy coming out here like that!
You would never shoot an unarmed man!
Well...
I guess, I wouldn't.
But I would.
I'd kill a child abducting murderer any chance I get.
I came here... for you!
I waited for you, the whole time!
I appreciate all your help.
But there ain't nothing gonna change the way things are.
This doesn't have to be.
The hell it doesn't!
There's Virgil...
There's Virgil... and all the others who died on your account.
Nothing's gonna change that.
... and nothing's gonna change this!
You call it, old man.
Nooooo!
You satisfied now?
Better watch yourself young man...
Ain't no such thing like a soft-hearted gunman.
You can go on with him now, if you want.
It was me that shot you in the back.
Well I guess all is fair in love and war
Don't you get it?
You been killed twice now, and you're still standing there.
The blue-eyed girl's one true love...
... that's you!
Oh boy!
Where you're heading?
South! Like I said, I'm leaving for good.
What about you?
Well, I think it's about time we pack up and...
... head east!
Yeah, which way is east?!?
Step right up.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and come with us to yesteryear.
Witness the Wild West as it really was.
The greatest show on Earth.
Fun and educational for you, young sir.
Step right up to another time of mighty beasts and hard-hearted outlaws.
Kemosabe?
Who? Me?
You bring horses?
I think you made a mistake, mister.
Mistake?
Make trade.
Trade.
Who did you think I was, anyway?
Never take off mask.
Why not?
You sure about this?
Mmm.
Dead man strike fear into heart of his enemy.
All right.
Let's do this.
Easy!
Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague and I will be making a withdrawal.
I understand this bank is insured, so...
...nobody move.
What's with the mask?
See? I told you. I feel ridiculous.
I guess I didn't make myself clear!
This is a damn bank robbery!
Wait a minute.
You're saying you're Tonto?
The Tonto?
There is another?
But the Lone Ranger and Tonto were good guys.
I mean, they didn't rob banks.
Did they?
Come a time, kemosabe...
...when good man must wear mask.
Run that next rail!
More rocks! They need more rocks right there!
Rail down!
Shake a leg, chums!
My friends and citizens of Colby,
I've asked you here today so you can see at firsthand what I believe to be the single most important enterprise under God.
The unification of this great country of ours by iron rail.
Hear, hear!
To the Comanche,
I say you have nothing to fear.
As long as there is peace between us all land treaties shall be honoured.
But to the outlaw, those who prey upon the weak, make no mistake, law and order has come to the Wild West.
Which is why I am bringing notorious outlaw and Indian-killer,
Butch Cavendish here to Colby to hang for his crimes.
The future is bright, ladies and gentlemen, and it's just around the bend.
Ride 'em out! Come on!
Whoa, girl!
Run a man all the way to state line, put him on a train and ship him right back.
Don't make no sense.
Guess they run out of hanging rope in Oklahoma.
Mr Cole wants to make an example.
Word is, Cavendish is looking for payback with you, Dan.
Reckon so.
They say Butch Cavendish ate a Red-Legger's heart in the Missouri wars.
Swallowed it whole.
I heard it was the eyes.
Man told me he ate part of his own foot just to win a bet.
Hell, he did.
MARTINI Which is it, Dan?
Don't see how it makes a difference.
What's the matter with him?
It's not Cavendish he's worried about.
Like Daniel entering the lion's den, we shall stare down the beast.
Amen!
And purge this Godless land of the poisons of sin and licentiousness.
Hallelujah!
Dear God, grant us thy mercy and wise judgment.
- Amen!
- Amen.
Thy equanimity and singleness of purpose, so we might prove thy stalwart and worthy servants in our war against sin. Amen!
Amen.
Catch.
Baby, baby, baby.
- Care to pray with us?
We're Presbyterian.
I'm much obliged, ma'am, but this, here, is my bible.
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
With its crystal tide forever...
It's almost hanging time, Butch.
Do you hear what I said, boy?
I'm gonna enjoy watching them wipe that look off your face.
It's broke, Injun. Can't you see that?
Very pretty.
For you.
Oh. No, I couldn't.
For you!
She's right.
It matches your eyes.
I didn't think you'd make it out, Mrs Reid.
Well, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And, um, what do you think of our endeavour?
Looks to me like just a lot of men digging in the desert.
Danny, one day soon, you'll be able to get on a train right here in Colby, travel all the way to San Francisco eating New York oysters packed in ice.
Then you can sail to China.
Come back around the other way if you want.
That true, Mama?
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.
Here, let me show you.
You see that?
Now you try.
Oh, I expect on a lawman's salary, quite a lot falls on you.
We do just fine.
Thank you.
Oh, I mean no disrespect.
They don't make men like your husband any more.
In fact, I envy him.
A fine family.
A son to carry on his name.
I just hate to see a bird in a cage.
Well...
That is right about on time.
Shh!
Piss break, boss.
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown...
Afternoon, ladies.
There's no need for violence, my son.
Fifteen hours,
I watched you feed that bird.
Gets on a man's nerves.
I do not fear what comes next.
Nothing comes next.
Nice suit.
Time has finally come, Windigo.
Do I know you, Injun?
You know me.
You know me by the screams of my ancestors in the desert wind.
As you will know their cries of joy when I remove your evil seed from the face of Earth.
That won't be necessary.
As District Attorney,
I'll see to it that this man is prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
What kind of a lawman don't carry his own gun?
Believe me, where this train's headed, there's no place for men who do.
Oh, yeah? Where's that?
The future.
Know something, Counsellor?
Maybe you're right.
A lawyer and a crazy Injun.
Bet you two got a lot to talk about.
Best make it quick.
Shall we gather at the river
...the river
I can't get it off.
No...
Play on, boys.
Sing it to me!
Should be slowing down by now.
Anyway, I'm sure we'll be at the station any minute.
Get the horses! Come on!
Jesus, we ought to go.
That's reinforced Bethlehem steel.
Any attempts at escape is futile.
That's great!
Good job.
And for coming to the aid of a federal prosecutor,
I can be sure to put in a good word with the judge.
Come on, boys!
Put your backs into it.
The rail road waits for no man!
That's the end of the line.
We jump.
What about the passengers?
They jump.
There are children on board.
All jump.
Have you no decency?
Windigo getting away!
No, you're not going anywhere.
Going somewhere?
- Yes.
- No.
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.
- No, we are not. No.
- Yes. Yes.
Shut up!
Yes.
- Ugh.
Thank you.
Do-si-doe.
Why don't you put that thing down, and we'll settle this like men?
Although, I warn you.
I boxed in law school.
Huh?
Great warrior.
Yeah, that's my brother.
Nice suit.
We have to stop the train.
No time!
Must to jump!
I'm not leaving these passengers!
Then help me unhook the cars!
Come On!
It's jammed! Give me a hand.
You hold.
Whoa!
John.
What the...
Ugh.
Hey, hold it right there.
I'm afraid I have to take you in.
Do you hear me?
You speak English, don't you?
Halt!
By the authority granted to me by the state of Texas,
I'm hereby arresting you.
You all right there, little brother?
Fine.
Just taking this man into custody.
Uh-huh.
He was on that train for a reason, Dan.
Probably.
What's your crime, boy?
Indian.
And a man, in the eyes of the law.
Now, throw me your cuffs.
Whatever you say, little brother.
It's nothing personal.
Dan?
John.
They said there was an accident and someone fell off the train.
Actually, it was me.
Dan's fine.
Saved the day. Same as usual.
Oh, my God, your face.
Um...
Come here.
God, it's good to see you.
What's it been, nine years?
Eight, since you stopped writing.
We were just kids back then.
Well, he takes good care of you, I see.
Yeah. In his way.
He spends most his time in Indian territory these days.
Indian territory?
Doesn't sound like Dan.
Doing what?
Well, whatever it is, he doesn't talk to me about it.
So...
Have you got a place to stay?
I...
No. Not as yet.
Well, you should stay with us at Willow Creek.
I don't know.
Oh, God, look at you.
City boy.
Why would you ever want to come back here?
It's my home.
Who are you?
Danny, this is your Uncle John.
Why, you look just like your dad did when he was your age.
They're going out again.
He deserves a trial, Dan.
Two Rangers are dead.
Didn't get no trial.
Well, I'm coming with you.
The law looks a lot different on the ground, little brother.
Well, it doesn't include vengeance, no matter where you're standing.
For "Wherever men unite into society,"
"they must quit the laws of nature and assume..."
"And assume the laws of men,"
"so that society as a whole may prosper."
That's John Locke's
Treatises of Government.
Never thought to hear the likes of it in Colby.
Mr Cole, my brother John.
New county prosecutor.
Latham Cole? It's an honour, sir.
I read about you during the war.
John, here, is an educated man like yourself.
Well, let's try not to hold that against him.
You going after Cavendish?
Collins, here, picked up a trail.
- Used to track for our father.
- Can he ride?
Well enough.
Yeah, well, you see to it.
Railroad promised these people a hanging.
I didn't know the rail road was in the business of keeping promises.
A simple task.
Collect the prisoner, deliver him to his execution.
If you're not up to that, Mr Reid,
I'll find someone who is.
Maybe you should think about staying in town for a few days.
Comanche are restless.
They're always restless, but they keep to their side of the river, and I keep to mine.
Besides, fences won't put themselves up.
It's my job.
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.
I am happy.
I'm happy with the life you provide. I just...
Is that new?
Matches your eyes.
All right.
Now, I expect you to be bagging squirrels by the time I get back.
Like old times, huh?
Thank you.
All right, Mr Prosecutor.
Let's see how your due process fares on the trail.
It's Dad's.
I hereby deputise you a Texas Ranger.
But I can't help you with them clothes.
Indians call that your spirit horse.
Come to take you to the other side.
You can't scare me with your ghost stories any more, Dan.
Since when did you start wearing Indian jewellery, anyway?
Since my kid brother became a lawyer.
Yeah?
World needs lawyers same as it does Rangers.
I reckon so. It's a nice hat, by the way.
They didn't have a bigger one?
He missed you.
Could have fooled me.
You smell like a distillery already.
Steadies the hand.
You even sleep last night?
You know me, Johnny.
Never been one to resist a little Western hospitality.
"Red's." Hmm.
What's this? Like, dancing?
Yeah.
Dancing.
Could go by the flats.
Lose a day. Maybe a day and a half.
What is it?
No cover.
What do you figure, Dan?
Figure Collins should go take a look.
If he can stay in the saddle.
John. Come here.
No, I don't believe in them.
You know that.
Butch Cavendish don't care one way or the other.
I'll take my chances.
You stay close.
Come on.
Where the hell's Collins?
Ambush!
I can't see him!
I got no shot!
Ride! Ride!
Dan!
Ride! Ride out!
Your hand! John, give me your hand!
- No. No!
No, Dan! Dan!
No! No, no...
You shouldn't have come back, John.
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I messed up.
No, no. You're okay, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.
She always loved you.
Take care of her for me.
No, you're coming with me.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
It's been a long time, Ranger.
You've looked better.
I heard them boys in Tulsa took a real shine to you.
All heart, ain't you?
A year you took from me in that sweatbox.
You take something from me, be damn sure
I'm gonna take something from you.
Oh, yes!
Deal dies with you, old friend.
That's not night.
It can't be right.
They're dead? All dead?
Even Dan?
Dan very dead.
But he's the Lone Ranger.
Would have been much easier, I agree.
How did you get out of jail, anyway?
Hmm?
And would you stop feeding that bird?
It's not alive, you know.
Awaiting spirit to return.
Not same thing.
Hmm.
Greetings, noble spirit horse.
No, no! No, no, please.
You make mistake.
Half-wit.
- Wet brain.
You come.
Come, come.
Him great warrior.
Spirit horse you have travelled far.
Obviously very fatigued.
I understand.
You come. Come, come.
- Come, come.
Him strong brother.
- Want him, bring him back.
John! Give me your hand!
Rebecca.
John!
If you are going to sneak up on an Indian, best to do it downwind.
Why are you talking to that horse?
My grandfather spoke of a time when animals could speak.
When you get them alone, some still do.
But I cannot decide whether this horse is stupid, or pretending to be stupid.
Tricky.
Why am I covered in dirt?
Because I buried you.
Then why am I alive?
Horse says you are Spirit Walker.
A man who has been to the other side, and returned.
A man who cannot be killed in battle.
Horse definitely stupid.
Are those my boots?
He cut out his heart.
What kind of a man does something like that?
Not a man.
An evil spirit born in the empty spaces of the desert.
With a hunger that cannot be satisfied.
And the power to throw nature out of balance.
My people call this spirit "windigo."
I am Tonto of the Comanche, last of the windigo hunters.
So, what do you want with me?
A vision told me a great warrior and Spirit Walker would help me on my quest.
I would have preferred someone else.
Your brother, perhaps.
He would have been good.
But who am I to question the great father, hmm?
All I know is a man killed my brother, and I'll see him hang for it.
Then you will need this.
A bullet?
Mmm.
A silver bullet?
Silver made him what he is.
And so it will return him to the earth.
Right.
You know what?
I would like to thank you for everything that you've done for me.
But I should get back.
I, too, seek the windigo Butch Cavendish.
Good.
I was prisoner on the train the way a coyote stalks buffalo.
After hunting 26 years I had my prey until you interfere.
Actually, I think I saved your life.
So, we're even.
Ow!
What the hell was that for?
Bird angry.
Yeah. You know what?
I can't help you.
Or your bird.
Where do you go?
Into town, to form a posse.
I would not do that, kemosabe.
Yeah?
There was a gun waiting for Cavendish on the train.
Eight men rode into canyon.
I dig seven graves.
Collins.
He's known us since we were kids.
You find traitor, you find the man who killed your brother.
That's my brother's vest.
Eyes, cut by the bullets that killed him.
From the great beyond, he will protect you and the ones you love.
You want me to wear a mask?
The men you seek think you are dead, kemosabe.
Better to stay that way.
All right, but if we ride together, it's to bring these men to justice in a court of law.
Is that understood?
Justice is what I seek, kemosabe.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, into the Hall of Human Deformities.
Fun and educational for you, sir.
...trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored...
God has forsaken all you sinners, and now the armies of hell are upon us.
Heathen. Heathen!
Heathen in our midst!
Heathen!
I'm looking for a man.
I bet.
Got money?
Of course.
Where did you get that?
Make trade.
With a dead man?
Hard bargain.
So...
Are all these women professionals?
Sickness of greed is strong.
What about her?
Oh, yes. Her, too.
So how do you know all this?
A vision said it would be so.
Hmm.
Hi, Tonto.
Couple of freaks here to see you.
Mmm-hmm. Thank you, Homer.
Just let me do the talking.
Ma'am.
What's with the mask?
Second thought, don't answer that.
No, one thing you learn in my business.
Killers, preachers, war heroes, railroaders...
Every man has his thing.
Railroaders?
Are you referring to Mr Cole?
Oh, no, not Mr Cole. No.
By all reports, Mr Cole is, uh...
Well, he is no longer guided by the same imperatives as other men.
Mr Cole gelding.
Come to think of it, there was talk of an incident during the war.
Let go of me!
I won't let you go!
- Whoa!
No free rides, gentlemen!
Scrimshaw.
Ivory.
- I want to touch.
- Uh-uh!
Not if you favour your hand.
We're looking for a man named Collins.
He's a tracker, speaks Indian.
Never heard of him.
I see.
Well...
Coming in here, we did happen to notice a number of fairly serious health code violations.
Hmm.
It is a house of sin.
Yes, well, one with evidence of livestock on the premises, inadequately marked fire escapes, and a fairly sinister-looking jar of pickles on the bar.
Hmm. Pickles?
Unrefrigerated.
I'd hate to have to shut you down.
You want to shut down the rail road?
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- Well, then you have a problem, because there ain't no rail road without girls like mine doing the heavy lifting.
Homer, help these morons find the door.
Windigo getting away.
What the hell is he talking about?
Nothing. It's an Indian thing.
Man who has taste for human flesh.
Butch Cavendish.
That's right.
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Collins was in about a week ago with a lawman.
Ranger like you, as a matter of fact.
Said his name was, uh, Reid.
Dan Reid?
Had themselves a hell of an argument.
What about?
Something they found in the desert.
Paid me with this.
Do not touch rock!
Rock cursed.
Injun's right. Worthless around here.
But get it to San Francisco, they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.
Maybe I'll be on the first train west.
- Retire.
Do you have cat?
I did.
I thought he'd be an improvement on the last man in my life, but maybe it's me.
Red, we got trouble.
What are you doing?
Comanche gesture of respect.
Taste another man's drink.
Oh. Right.
- Thank you.
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to bring our little visit to a close.
Some of my clientèle don't take kindly to an Indian on the premises.
He has as much right to be here as anyone else.
Not since the Comanche violated the treaty.
- Treaty?
- You didn't hear?
They've been raiding settlements up and down the river.
My God. Rebecca.
Fear of cat.
Better go out the back.
How do I thank you?
Just make that animal pay for what he took from me.
Hey!
Nature is indeed out of balance.
Come. Must to go.
Must to go, drunken beast!
'Tis judgment day, harlot!
Oh.
May I help you?
Where are they?
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
Ma'am, I believe I've located your...
...cat.
Ma'am.
- Get him!
There's the redskin!
Where you runnin', Injun?
What the hell is wrong with these people?
Blood has been spilled, kemosabe.
And soon, rivers run red.
Oh, God...
Let's call it a night, Joe.
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Danny.
Get yourselves inside!
Danny, come on.
Pilar, get the shutters.
- Pilar, fire!
Indian savages.
Was not Indian.
The hell it wasn't.
Indians make trade.
Leave him alone.
I said leave him alone!
Indian is like coyote.
He kill and leave nothing to waste.
Tell me, kemosabe, what does the white man kill for?
This one's nice, ain't it?
I love me some aquamarine.
Not an Indian.
This ain't what it looks like, mister.
I just like them pretty things.
Rebecca and Danny. Where are they?
You tell me where they are, or I'll let the Indian do what he wants to you.
What does he want to do?
What the hell is going on?
There's a Ranger.
What are you talking about?
He got some lunatic Indian with him.
He was gonna violate me with a duck foot.
You shoot anything that comes out.
Go for horse, kemosabe.
I cover you.
Why don't I cover you?
You have been to the other side.
Spirit Walker cannot be killed.
All right.
But we take them alive.
Texas Ranger!
Put down your weapons and step out with your hands up!
It's dark!
Spirit Walker.
See! What did I tell you?
Go around back.
What's with the mask?
What is it?
So, the horse, it can fly?
Don't be stupid.
Hold it right there.
Rebecca and Danny, where are they?
Comanche don't take no prisoners.
Just the scalps.
Isn't that right, boy?
I will take the Spaniard.
I haven't fired a gun in nine years.
Might want to keep that to yourself, kemosabe.
Great shot!
That was supposed to be a warning shot.
In that case, not so good.
What?
Nothing.
That was my brother's.
Comanche.
Very sacred.
How am I supposed to find Rebecca and Danny now?
Tracks lead north, toward Indian country.
That's 400 square miles of rock and desert.
Even an Indian can't track through that.
We follow horse, kemosabe.
"Kemosa..." Why do you keep calling me that?
What's that mean?
"Wrong brother."
Right.
My husband will kill you for this.
That'd be a trick.
Last time I saw your husband, he was drowning in his own blood.
We got company.
Hold up!
It's Frank.
Where's Barret and Jesus?
He killed them.
Straight draw.
Fired one bullet and they didn't stand a chance.
You better start talking straight, Frank.
Now, who killed them?
It was a Ranger, Butch.
A lone Ranger.
Rangers are dead.
The ghost of Dan Reid.
Frank!
He coming for you.
You shouldn't have done what you did.
Shut up!
Let him come!
I killed him once.
I won't have to answer for it when I kill him again.
Scared, aren't you?
You should be.
Hey, Collins.
Do you know what the Indians call this place?
"The Valley of Tears."
Please don't do this. Please, don't...
Mmm!
That's far enough.
Don't look at me.
He loved you.
I said, don't look at me.
Run.
Please, run.
Danny, come on.
- Mama?
Why would Cavendish make it look like the Comanche violated the treaty?
It has something to do with what my brother found in the desert.
Perhaps he want to make it look like Comanche violate treaty.
That's very helpful, thank you.
Whoa.
What is it?
Horse dead.
I can see that. Now what?
We're lost, aren't we?
I knew it.
Just follow the horse.
That was your idea?
But you can't talk to a dead horse, now, can you?
You know what? Let me try.
Hello. If you could just point us in the right direction, we'll take it from here.
What's that?
Nothing!
That's just fantastic, isn't it?
Cavendish is out there somewhere, doing God-knows-what to Rebecca and Danny, and I'm gonna die here in the desert with you and that ridiculous bird!
The woman, Rebecca, you will fill her with child, no?
What?
No!
That's my brother's wife.
When you were on the other side, you spoke of her in your vision.
Well, lack of oxygen can cause the brain to hallucinate.
Everyone knows that.
Yes, but you did not speak of her as the wife of your brother.
Well, she's his widow now.
So, it is better that she live the rest of her life alone?
Yes. No.
Look, it just isn't done.
You wouldn't understand.
Because I am a savage?
Would you stop?
You can't track.
If you could, we wouldn't be out here in the first place!
What is that?
Track!
That's impossible.
Train track.
You are lost, aren't you?
Train tracks?
I thought you were in Indian territory.
Yes.
Let the Comanche make no mistake.
We will not be dissuaded from our task.
- From here on, all treaties with the Indian Nation are null and void.
We will be in Promontory Summit ahead of schedule, three days from today!
Now, go ahead. Put that in your paper.
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!
Sir?
It arrived last night.
I had to dip into petty cash.
Put it somewhere safe.
Where would that be?
Use your imagination.
I understand you have an Indian problem.
Right on time.
I thought you said I couldn't get shot.
No.
I said you could not be killed.
Oh.
Apache?
Comanche.
Well, that's good, right?
Not so much.
What are they doing?
Death dance.
They are preparing for war with the white man.
War?
Wait.
Is that thing sterile?
Yes. I make urine on it.
What?
- War?
But the Comanche didn't attack the settlements!
White man does not know this.
But you're going to tell them.
I mean, you did tell them, right?
My name's John Reid, and I know that you didn't raid those settlements.
If you let me go, I can prove it.
There doesn't have to be a war, understand?
No. Of course you don't.
Mmm!
Good. Good.
Me, Spirit Walker from great beyond.
The hunter of wendingo and the other things.
Sunstroke?
Or his mind is poisoned with whiskey.
Comanche gesture of respect?
What's with the mask?
What?
Tonto told you these things?
That's right.
And he told you to wear the mask?
That's funny?
Very funny.
Tonto's a Comanche.
He's one of you.
No more.
What do you mean?
His mind is broken.
He is a band apart.
Many moons ago,
a boy found two white men in the desert.
He brought them to his village to be healed.
When they found silver in the river,
they asked the boy where it came from.
In exchange for a cheap pocket watch
from Sears Roebuck,
the boy showed them where the river begins,
where they found more silver
than any white man had ever seen.
They took what they could carry,
but they wanted to keep the place a secret,
so they could one day return.
The boy could not live with what he had done,
so he decided the men were possessed
by evil spirits in the silver.
He called it "windigo,"
like the ghost stories we tell our children.
And he made a vow.
When he found these two men,
he would drain their blood
into the soil of his ancestors,
so he could return to the tribe.
But he is too late.
There is no more tribe to return to.
Our time has passed.
They call it "progress."
You're John Reid, brother of Dan.
Yes.
By this totem, your brother swore if we kept the peace, he would protect our land.
Now the Cavalry cut down our children.
Like all white men, your brother lied.
No. No, Dan was murdered.
And if you let me go,
I'll keep his promise.
So, we have a deal?
Not so much.
My name come up?
Please, this is a mistake.
There doesn't need to be a war.
It makes no difference.
We are already ghosts.
Shh! Shh!
Cavalry.
Let us bring the pure sceptre of Almighty God to the heathens!
Oh, thank God! Civilisation.
We'll just explain the entire situation, and we'll get this whole misunderstanding cleared up.
The United States Army.
Finally someone who will listen to reason.
Help! Over here!
Wait!
Perhaps they didn't see us.
Oh, no.
They will be back any minute now.
Could be worse.
Worse?
How could this be worse?
Could develop an itch on your nose.
I'm not talking to you any more.
What is that?
You hear it, too?
I was hoping it was in my head.
This is worse.
- Hmm.
Nature is most definitely...
- Out of balance.
- Mmm.
Hello again.
Any chance you could...
Atta boy! Yes! Thank you.
Uh...
Ah!
Here we go, Okay, go!
Thank you.
Going, kemosabe?
Uh-huh.
To find Rebecca and Danny?
Yup.
- To capture Cavendish?
- That's right.
Hmm.
Where the river begins?
Exactly.
It is a good day to die.
Yeah, well, same to you.
Come on.
"Where the river begins."
You know where that is, don't you?
Where the river begins.
Oh!
Sorry, Butch. it was a accident. I'm...
I didn't mean it.
What the hell is that damn noise?
Sorry, Butch.
They say they won't go inside no more.
Indian spirits or some damn thing.
They say they causing the cave-ins.
He the one doing the talking?
That's right.
Anybody else want to negotiate?
You?
They don't even speak English, Butch.
I think they understood.
Now go show them there's nothing to be afraid of.
Do I have to ask twice?
I've been thinking.
Why don't we just take what we can carry and get out of here?
I mean, hell, we already rich.
Right?
Scraps?
Yeah.
You think I waited 20 years for scraps?
I'm taking all of it!
Every damn piece!
I'm sorry!
Now, get in there before I put a hole in you!
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Get in there.
Frank?
Ray,
Skinny, go get him.
Frank?
It can't be.
The Rangers are dead.
Where are they?
You're dead.
Rebecca and Danny.
If you hurt them, I swear to God, I'll make you pay.
...to the full extent of the law.
I'll be damned.
Lawyer and a crazy Injun.
Tell me.
Had a nice smell on her.
Didn't she?
See?
You're no spirit.
You're just a man in a mask.
You're no different than me.
Finish him.
No.
This isn't justice.
Justice is what a man must take for himself.
No, I can't believe that.
I won't.
Windigo cut out brother's heart.
Where is brother's justice?
I'm not a savage.
You are not a man.
- I will do it.
- Wait.
You keep me from my destiny once.
It will not happen again.
Now, windigo must die.
There's no such thing as a wendingo.
You made it up.
Like you make up everything.
You sold out your whole village for a watch.
And now you're an outcast.
You're a band apart.
A messed up little kid who couldn't live with what you did.
There's no such thing as cursed silver, or a Spirit Walker for that matter.
I'm not like you.
I have a tribe.
You have nothing.
Like me.
You're wrong.
Go back to your tribe, white coward.
I do not need you.
Look at me.
See the face of my people as you die.
I knew I could count on you, Counsellor.
Shut up.
Hey.
Where am I?
Drink.
Feel better.
Your tactics have been most effective, Captain.
With the natives in retreat, we'll be in Promontory Summit ahead of schedule.
Believe me, what they have done to the settlements we have given back tenfold.
Tenfold.
Danny, I told you, take it easy on the corners and press down on the straightaway.
It's just a toy.
Come here, Danny.
I want to show you something.
Since the time of Alexander the Great no man has travelled faster than the horse that carried him.
Not any more.
Imagine, an entire continent connected by iron rail.
That's fuel for our cities.
Metals for our factories.
Food for the masses.
Whoever controls this, controls the future.
Power that makes emperors and kings look like fools.
You mean it's mine?
It could be, son.
Could be all yours.
Rebecca. Feeling better?
Look what Mr Cole got me, Mama.
Huh!
Danny...
Oh!
Well, it was the least I could do after what you've been through.
You should consider yourself a lucky woman, Mrs Reid.
Had Mr Cole not come along when he did with those outlaws, who knows what manner of violations might have transpired...
Captain. Captain, please.
The boy.
We're indebted to you.
Oh, no. It is I who is indebted.
Ever since the war, I prayed that God might send me a family that I could care for.
And now he has.
Wait.
There's one left.
- I'm sorry?
- A Ranger.
A Ranger is still alive.
No, ma'am.
My troopers found seven graves.
So, perhaps when you fell and hit your head...
Captain.
If there is a Ranger still alive, we will scour the countryside until we find him.
I promise you that.
Heavenly Father,
we call upon you in this, our hour of need.
For you are the shepherd
that shall guide the wanderer through the desert.
You are the light that shall be his beacon
in the darkness.
And yours is the mighty sword
that shall strike down his enemies.
For he is on the path of righteousness.
Amen.
Latham Cole!
Sir!
Someone's coming in!
Sentries, at your posts!
- Daddy!
- Dan.
We don't know who's out there.
I intend to find out.
Latham Cole!
Wendell, take Mrs Reid and her son to the supply car.
For their own safety.
What is it, friend?
This is the man you've been looking for.
Butch Cavendish, just like one of those great lizards buried in the desert.
The last of a dying breed.
That's enough.
I brought this man in for justice.
Of course.
Soldier.
I'm just doing my job, Mrs Reid.
You wanna keep me in this room, you're gonna have to shoot me.
Is that part of your job?
Whoa!
Danny.
And don't let him leave.
But he's just a boy.
That's right.
Oh.
And he's got a twitchy finger, too.
Stupid white man.
There were rumours that sustained us.
A lone Ranger, a masked man.
A ghost, some people said.
And now, here you are.
Flesh and blood.
Civilised society has no place for a masked man.
Of course not.
How can I thank you for what you've done?
You can stop this war before it's too late.
Comanche didn't attack those settlements.
It was Butch Cavendish and his gang.
All for this.
Butch Cavendish.
In one man, everything I hate about this country.
No sense of the common good.
No vision.
Come to think of it, not unlike your brother, Dan.
Men like that can't accept what we know to be true.
A man can't stay the same with the world evolving around him.
Remember me?
But a man can't choose his brother, can he?
It's almost as if his brother chooses him.
You see, that's what we are.
Me and Butch.
Brothers.
Born in the desert.
All those years ago.
And now you've come back.
Train tracks.
That's what Dan found in Indian Territory, isn't it?
He knew there was gonna be a war and he wouldn't go along with it, so you had him killed.
Like I said, no vision.
Stop this train.
Oh, there's no stopping this train, John.
I think you know that.
Danny!
You're not my daddy.
No. Put the gun down, son.
Where's my daddy?
He's dead, Danny.
- He killed him.
- Shut up.
Listen to me, Danny.
You remember me, it's your Uncle John.
You trust me, don't you, Danny?
Look, Danny,
I'm gonna put my gun away, okay?
Nice and slow.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Shoot him, son.
Danny?
Is my daddy dead?
Is he?
Is he?
Just put the gun down.
Please?
Now, just put the gun down.
Captain, arrest these men.
This man is a common criminal trespassing on railway property.
Comanche never raided any settlements.
They staged the attacks so they could violate the treaty.
We've heard enough. Captain.
You represent the United States government.
You do not work for this man!
- Captain!
- They started this war!
Well, if what you say is true, that would mean
I attacked the Comanche for no reason.
That's right, Captain.
Slaughter of the innocents.
Their blood on your hands.
Tenfold.
Are you capable of that?
Well, the way I see it, these men are with the rail road.
So, the question is, who the hell are you?
Clear the track, men!
Outta the way!
Going to pit!
My God!
Out here, it's just rock.
Put it on a train, it's priceless.
What could you buy with all of that?
A country, Captain.
A great country.
For which our children will thank us.
Take her ahead!
Line her up!
You're lined up.
That'll do!
Get these Chinamen out of here!
Move it, move it!
Detail, halt!
Order, up!
Didn't you hear me, Chinaman?
I said, get out!
Port arms!
Please, don't do this.
You'll take care of us, like you said.
You don't have to do this.
Load!
I ain't gonna tell you again!
What the hell is that?
Gas. That's gas!
- What'd he say?
Gas! Get out of there!
She's going to blow!
Shoulder arms!
I was at Gettysburg.
Twelve-thousand casualties before lunch.
Know what I learned in all that carnage?
Nothing is accomplished without sacrifice.
- Leave her alone!
- Danny!
Nice and easy!
Gas! Oh, Lord! Gas!
What the hell?
Gas! Gas! Gas!
Ready!
I'm gonna have to teach you about respect, aren't I, son?
No!
Aim!
Fire!
Oh!
What the hell just happened?
Get the train moving!
Attack!
Maintain order! To arms!
Hold on, kemosabe.
Tonto?
What was that?
No reason for concern.
Over here! To the guns!
Defensive position!
John!
Rebecca! I'm coming for you!
John!
Rally on me!
Lord, save us.
Faster! Now!
Form a firing line!
Come this way. Fall in on me.
Hold your positions, gentlemen!
Hold!
Steady!
For God!
And for country!
Fire at Will!
Tonto? What is that?
Now... must to jump!
Left or right?
Yes!
Kerosene?
What are you trying to do?
Blow up the whole mountain?
Trust me. These two have a hard time staying dead.
Cover the flank!
Mister Tonto?
Mister Tonto?
You mean, they killed all of them?
The Indians, the settlers...
Dan?
For silver?
You were right.
There is no justice.
Cole controls everything.
The rail road, the Cavalry, everything.
If men like him represent the law,
I'd rather be an outlaw.
That is why you wear the mask.
Something very wrong with that horse.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to celebrate a dream.
And now I'd like to introduce the man who made that dream a reality.
Chairman of the Transcontinental
Railroad Corporation,
Mr Lewis Habberman the Third.
Thank you!
But I cannot take credit alone.
No, sir.
The working men before you deserve your applause!
- Yes!
As does one man in particular, and a more dedicated, loyal employee the rail road could not ask for,
Mr Latham Cole!
- Come on.
- Good man.
Bravo, sir.
Mr Cole!
A testament of our thanks.
Cheers!
You missed something.
Where did you get the explosives?
I told you.
No, you didn't.
But you had a plan. I mean, he didn't get away with it?
We had plan.
It was good plan.
This is a damn bank robbery!
Oh, Mr Habberman, if you and the other shareholders would like to follow me,
I have a little surprise for you.
Ah!
Oh, my.
What was that?
Tunnelling for supply routes.
Nothing to be concerned about.
This way, gentlemen.
Bring the girl.
He's coming for you.
Just like Frank said.
What you got makes them Reid boys so hot under the collar, anyway?
Maybe I'll have a taste and find out.
The men around this table represent the finest families in our country as well as controlling interest in the Transcontinental
Railway Corporation.
Hear, hear!
What you cannot know is that over the past six months,
I have leveraged a position which will make me the majority shareholder when this company is listed Monday morning on the New York City Stock Exchange.
In essence, gentlemen, you work for me.
Have you lost your mind?
Do you have any idea the cost?
Each one of those freight cars contains
4.5 tons of purest raw silver.
When it reaches the bank in San Francisco, that's 65 million dollars.
It's what you might call a hostile takeover.
You can keep the watch.
Have you checked the undercarriage?
- Check it again.
- Yes, sir.
Pleasure to see you, Red!
Oh!
May I be of some assistance to you, madam?
Seems I have a run in my stocking.
Ivory.
Hurry up with them grapes.
Shh!
Make trade.
Hey, boy!
Boy, I'm talking to you!
Hey! You can't leave that here!
Mr Cole's pickles. Take it up with him.
This is an outrage!
I, for one, am not gonna sit here and negotiate with one of my employees.
Then, let's get down to it, shall we?
My gluteus!
Gentlemen, our chairman has had to take
- a sudden leave of absence.
Any nominations?
I nominate Mr Latham Cole.
I accept.
It's magnificent.
So clean.
You want to touch it?
Oh, yes.
Attention!
About face!
Everyone wants to touch it.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Robbery.
We don't have no money here, boy.
Train robbery.
A little higher.
How high does it go?
Almost there.
...land of the free
and the home of the brave
Um...
Mr Cole?
They're stealing my train.
Get the horses!
Right there!
What are you waiting for? To the engine!
Stop that train!
Shoot him, you idiot.
- No, Danny's in there!
- That's an order!
Mama!
I've been shot!
- There he is, men!
John!
John!
Come on!
Get me close!
The Ranger! He's on the roof!
How many times do I have to tell you to kill that Ranger?
I told you he'd come.
Adiós, Counsellor!
John!
Dance, monkey! Dance!
Oh! Ooh!
Danny!
Butch Cavendish!
Let her go!
If you insist.
Go ahead.
John?
She tends to land on her feet.
John!
Oh!
What you gonna do, Counsellor?
Shoot me?
That's right.
Guess I cut out the wrong brother's heart.
Don't tell me.
You boxed in law school.
What the hell?
As a matter of fact, I did.
Where is girl?
What? Where's the silver?
What are you...
End of the line.
We've been here before, haven't we?
Easy.
Where did you say that train was headed?
The future?
Well, this here train, she going straight to hell.
You know something, Butch?
I believe you're right.
Enjoy the ride!
Huh?
Hey!
Wrong brother?
Not today.
Time's up, Indian.
Uncle John!
Pretty soon, no one will even know you people were here.
I'm a Spirit Walker.
I can't miss.
All these years,
I think you are windigo.
But, no.
You are just another white man.
Who are you?
Bad trade.
You let him get away?
No.
The bridge.
What bridge?
Oh, my.
"Bad trade."
Ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the
Transcontinental Railroad,
I'd like to express our gratitude to this masked man, this Lone Ranger.
- Hear, hear.
Come on, come on.
A small token of our thanks.
There will be plenty more where that came from.
Always nice to have a lawman on the side of progress.
Time to take off the mask, son.
Not yet.
I can't stay.
I know.
But if that badge ever starts to weigh on you, well, you know where to find us.
Train's headed west.
There's nothing holding you here any more.
It's my home.
You're not a boy any more, Danny.
Your daddy would be proud.
You take care of your mama.
I thought I'd call him Silver.
Silver?
It is a good name.
You know, it isn't really a trade unless both parties agree.
Who would really trade a watch for some bird seed?
Bird cannot tell time, kemosabe.
"Kemosabe." Yeah, about that.
Look, I was thinking, if we're gonna be outlaws,
I'm gonna need a better name.
I was thinking, "The Mask of Justice."
No.
What about,
"The Lone Rider of..."
No.
Do you know what "Tonto" means in Spanish?
I guess I should be heading home.
Home.
It was nice to meet you, Mr Tonto.
So, the windigo.
Nature out of balance.
The masked man.
It's just a story, right?
I mean, I know he's not real.
Was he?
Up to you, kemosabe.
Never take off the mask.
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!
Don't ever do that again.
Sorry.

Armando, why do you care for the calf, when all of our money is in the herd?
Esteban, one day my father's ranch will be passed on to my brother and I.
We will want this calf and many more like it.
I still say you care more for the baby cow than for a woman.
Yes, it's true, Manuel, but only because
I have not found the right woman.
I propose a contest.
Let's race back to the house!
I hope nothing bad happens on the way home!
I'm riding a horse!
Get down.
This is not good.
He's a drug dealer!
We should ride down and help this man.
And get killed?
Maybe he just wants to talk to him.
Holy mother.
Praying will not help that man.
Perhaps praying is all we can do.
What are we doing here?
Your brother may already be home!
Fuck, yeah!
Quiet.
Come in.
Father, is this a good time?
What do you want?
Pardon, nothing, sir. I was just...
Where have you been?
We were taking the cattle to a new pasture as you asked.
What took you so long? There is much work to do around here, Armando!
Is there something wrong, Father?
Leave me alone.
Armando.
Yes, Father?
Come over here.
Armando, forgive me.
I have many worries.
Please let me help, Father.
You are so much like your mother.
She had such a good heart.
And I know your heart is in the right place, but like your mother, you are not smart.
You have never been smart.
But I am smart, Father.
Yes, of course, Armando.
For my trouble,
I need someone who is very smart.
If you were truly smart, you would know that you are dumb.
Look at your fat head.
Raul!
Raul, your brother.
It's Raul.
You arrange everything with the Japanese and then give them the merchandise.
- Raul!
- Brother!
We are close brothers.
We have shared so much, man.
Raul!
Papa!
Finally, the one with brains has returned!
You're the son I've always loved!
Fuck, I almost forgot.
Sweetheart.
May I introduce to you Miss Sonia Lopez?
Sonia Lopez.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
It's nice to meet you.
Let me look at you.
You look amazing.
You must be Armando.
Armando Alvarez, Miss Lopez.
Welcome to our house.
Thank you, but please call me Sonia.
And I can call you Armando?
I would like that, Sonia.
Esteban de los Santos Escobar Chavez.
Sir.
Thank you, Esmeralda.
You're welcome.
Sir.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Raul, you have brought so much happiness to our father.
I am an Alvarez, no?
If only we could keep the drug dealers off the ranch.
Just this morning,
I was out with Manuel and Esteban, and we came across a killing.
Why was I not told?
I saw that you had many worries.
They killed a man.
I believe it was by the Onza.
The Onza?
Miss Lopez. Sonia.
How nice to see you.
It's a pleasure that you're here, because here...
Armando has never done anything with a woman.
It seems like he's not interested in women.
Is this true, Armando?
Do you have no interest in women?
I would not say that, Miss Lopez.
I just have not found the woman for me.
What would this woman be like?
My woman, Miss Lopez, must love the land as I do.
More than all the gold in the world, she must find pleasure in the scent of the cactus flower.
She would sleep beneath the stars and let the wild west wind caress her body and blanket her soul.
Her passions would be my passions, her dreams, my dreams.
And our love would be a great song, and the song would be true.
Armando is a ridiculously hopeless romantic!
What woman would sleep in the dirt with him, please?
Sonia.
Come over here.
Sonia.
Father, I...
Excuse me. Miss Lopez, Sonia and I, would like to ask your permission to be married.
To get married?
You two? What a delight!
The Lord has blessed the Alvarez house.
Thank you!
For Raul and for Sonia.
Much happiness.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- For you, brother, cheers.
- Cheers.
So it's true?
It says here that Raul is getting married to this woman.
It's true.
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.
She is very pretty.
You don't sound happy, Armando.
Are you jealous of your brother?
Jealous?
No, Manuel, I could never be jealous of Raul.
Maybe I love him too much, and I am concerned.
Concerned?
I don't know.
He has changed.
I think you are jealous.
I am jealous.
If I had a woman like this...
I would never get out of bed.
Can I not share in your joke?
I'm afraid not, Miss Lopez.
The joke was about you.
Do you ride?
I haven't in a long time, but I would like to.
Esteban, please check on the herd.
- I shall meet you there later.
- Of course.
You ride well, Miss Lopez.
Good control, nice poise.
That is a difficult horse.
You have ridden before.
From the time I could walk, my father put me on the back of a horse.
I see.
When I was nine, my father was murdered in his bed.
They took me to the city to live with my uncle.
Interesting.
My uncle was very mean.
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me and burned me with his cigarettes.
Interesting.
I ran away from him when I was 12.
But he found me, and beat me, and said he would marry me when I was grown up.
Interesting.
And your uncle?
I have not seen him in a long time.
I have to ask you something.
Do you love Raul?
Raul has been very good to me, and I have been good to him.
Do you love him?
I must know.
A race. I will show you how well I ride!
Giddy up!
Not if I can help it!
This is beautiful.
What is this place?
It is called
The Pond of the Seven Tears.
I swam here as a boy.
It is the most beautiful spot
I have seen in all my life.
How did you know to ride here?
The wind told me.
Sometimes the wind talks to me.
This is the place my mother was killed.
This was her favorite place.
I have much work to do.
Go then. I am only drying my hair.
Okay, but do not be long.
There are bandits in these hills.
Armando will protect me.
Yes.
My son, this was my father's rifle.
He passed it on to me when I was a boy, and today I am giving it to you.
Go. You must build our ranch.
Armando.
What do you want?
Armando, give me the gun.
Boy, give me the gun!
No! Let me go! No!
Go! Don't touch me!
She loved coming here.
I am sorry.
It was a long time ago.
I could stay here forever.
I doubt that very much.
Why is that?
There is nothing to buy.
No shops, no expensive clothes, no fancy shoes.
This is not Dallas.
Is that what you think of me?
Someone who needs fancy shoes?
It does not matter what I think of you.
You think I'm some kind of cheap woman who is only interested in Raul's money?
Are you?
You never answered my question.
What question?
Do you love my brother?
Take me back, now!
Answer the question!
Bongos!
- Congas?
- Guns.
Where?
Over that hill.
Hunters?
Those are not hunters.
Perhaps someone is hurt.
It is not our concern.
You are a coward. A coward!
Sonia!
No!
Sir? Sir?
Please... God forgive me.
Easy. We'll take you to the hospital.
Let him die.
He is missing a hand.
Give me your water, Armando.
Waste water on that?
In the trunk. It's in the trunk.
Take it...
Here, take this.
I know you.
You are Sonia.
I found some drugs!
Armando, please help me put him on the horse.
He is coming.
The Onza.
Maybe God will be merciful.
He is dead!
He was dead a long time ago.
It looks like these belong to you now.
You are a rich woman.
Don't you want them?
Perhaps as a wedding present from an old dying friend?
You have answered my question.
You do not love my brother.
Let me go. You're hurting me.
I don't think you hurt so easily.
I know the kind of woman you are.
You know nothing about me.
I know that you will not marry Raul if I can help it.
Do you think Raul is so innocent?
You lie!
You stupid rancher.
Your brother is a drug dealer!
You have done this!
So help me God, if it is true, and my brother is involved in drugs, you shall never have the name Alvarez!
I'll take care of my family.
Let the devil take care of you.
Are you so sure that Raul is involved with drugs?
I don't know, Manuel.
I have sensed something since his return, and this morning with Sonia...
Perhaps she is lying. Bitches are liars.
It is true. Bitches are liars.
But Miss Lopez is no bitch.
I like bitches.
You two wait here while I go and talk to Raul.
It is true, Raul?
What are you speaking of, Armando?
You are in the drug business.
I am in business in Mexico, Armando.
What's the difference?
Raul, you have brought shame to our family.
No, Armando. I am here to save this family.
There's a difference.
You are taking this family to hell!
Armando, Little Armando, listen.
Yes.
So I move drugs over the border.
So why do you care?
I do not sell drugs to my people.
I sell it to the Americans.
I don't sell drugs to our people. No, no, no.
I sell the Americans drugs, but I'd sell them chocolates if they wanted them.
But they don't!
This is not the America our father held in such high esteem.
This is a country of babies.
They buy houses with no money.
TVs and cars with no money.
They stuff their faces like monsters with shit burgers and grease.
It's irresponsible to feed candy to babies.
No, they are not babies, Armando.
They are all adults, and they are crazy.
They only cry like babies.
The damn Mexicans are coming!
They are going to fuck us up and kill us with their drugs!
Fuck them!
Fuck their drug-addicted children!
Fuck them all.
Fuck their heroin-addicted wives who stuff themselves non-stop with pasta.
Fuck their pot smoking doctors from California.
Fuck them!
If they can't stop themselves from shoving bags of shit up their nose, then let's make a buck while we can,
Little Armando.
Yes, yes. If it was so simple.
But instead we have been infected with greed.
We will all kill each other feeding the shit-eating crazy monster babies.
Look, Armando, this country will be strong from America's weakness.
Sons of bitches.
What's up?
You are Raul?
You know very well who I am.
And I know very well who you are.
Onza.
Onza.
The Onza.
So, Raul, what the hell are you doing here?
I am here visiting my family.
I am here because...
This is my land.
You motherfucker, you think you're a big boy?
He's really funny. Isn't he, Armando?
Look, Raul.
I don't believe you.
You have already taken my woman, and I think you are here for something more.
The woman was never yours.
- Oh, no?
- No.
And I repeat.
I am here...
...because...
...this is my land.
Armando.
Yes?
Can I call you Little Armando?
I'd like that.
Do you know what your brother is doing?
Do you know what business he is in?
It's very dangerous for you and very dangerous for him.
And it's very dangerous for your family.
Easy, easy.
Not all dirty, little ranchers like Canadian Slims.
Yes, I like them.
All right then,
I only came to bring you this.
I think it belongs to you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Raul.
This is going to get very ugly.
That's okay.
Goodbye.
See you around.
See you later.
Bye.
- Bye bye.
- Bye.
It does not seem as if this Onza wants to follow your plan.
Armando, go home.
Mexico is no place for cowards.
I live my life on earth
The dirt is all I know
I am a ranchero
And I know nothing
I know nothing
Why does the moon shine at night?
I don't know
Why does the bird take flight?
I don't know
Why does the turtle move so slow?
I don't know
Come on!
Why do men hate each other?
I don't know
Why does the brother fight the brother?
I don't know
Why does the blue flower grow?
I don't know
How can I know anything?
What is there to know?
Long live Mexico!
I am a man of the land
I am a ranchero
And I don't know
I live a simple life
I'm friends with the cows
I have no thoughts
I am a ranchero
I don't know
And I don't know
Why is a woman so warm?
Why is my bed so cold?
These are the questions
I'll never know
I'm a ranchero
And I don't know
The only thing I'll ever know for certain
Is love
Look at that.
Holy Mary, a white cat.
This is a rare thing.
Let me kill it.
You cannot kill this.
He is here for a reason.
Yes, so that I can shoot him.
I do not know the reason, but I believe it has something to do with me.
Look at this country.
Always such beauty.
Why is there so much pain?
Esteban slept on a rock last night.
I slept on a bottle of tequila.
What is this?
I do not know.
I don't like this.
FEDERAL POLICE
You two stay here.
Be careful.
Armando Alvarez?
Yes. That is my name.
I am Vincent Blancardo.
I was friend of your father's in the old days.
You were the one who found my mother.
Yes, many years ago.
Armando, these men are from America.
They are with the DEA.
Yes, how can I help you?
No, sir.
I don't speak American.
Armando, I need you to help me.
Of course.
We know that your brother is a drug dealer.
We also know that he is here to take over the territory of the Onza.
I don't think I can help you, Mr...
Parker.
The name is Parker.
I think you can help me.
Listen, you piece of shit.
I make one call, and I can get 10 helicopters to come up over that hill and turn your ranch into a lit fart.
So you think about that.
It is better this way, Armando.
Talk to Raul.
Find out for this man.
Now go find out.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you all for coming today.
Tomorrow will be a great day for the Alvarez family.
It's a pleasure to share it with all of you.
My sister, Carmen, has come from Guadalajara.
My other sister, Margarite, has come from Puerto Vallarta.
My cousin, Hernan, and his wife, Doleta.
My friends for life.
Of course, Sheila from Atlanta!
Tomorrow will be a double celebration.
The return of my son, Raul, to his land.
Also, he brought home this precious woman with whom he gets to have sex.
I propose a toast to Sonia.
For Sonia! Friends.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
For Sonia.
Cheers!
I'd also like to propose a toast and thank those who have come from so far.
But I would like to specially thank someone, someone who many of you have often called stupid, imbecile, fat head, but he's a guy with a big heart.
I propose a toast for my brother.
For your happiness, Armando.
Well, Armando?
You aren't going to toast to your brother's happiness?
Yes.
To Raul's happiness.
May you enjoy all of life's pleasure.
Even if it means the destruction of this family!
Stop, Armando!
Please!
It hurts me to say it, but tomorrow I do not wish for you to be at your brother's wedding.
Do you understand me? Get out!
As you wish.
- Armando...
- Let him go!
Armando!
Let me talk to him.
You stay with your guests.
Armando.
Go back inside, Sonia.
Go back to your people.
Don't make trouble, Armando.
Do you think I like that Raul is mixed up in this business?
It is your business too.
We can change him.
But I need your help.
Armando, there's something you need to know.
What is it that I must know?
This drug dealer they call the Onza.
He is my uncle.
I understand.
He will never stop until he has what he wants.
You come from trouble, and you carry it with you.
Then save us.
Save your brother.
Save your family.
Save me.
Some things are beyond saving.

Father.
Raul, who did this? Was it Armando?
Easy, Dad, don't talk.
Don't die on me.
Armando was right.
He was dead the day we came to his house.
Hold on, Papa...
Hold on, you're gonna be fine.
It has his fingerprints all over it!
What?
It had to be Armando!
How the hell could it be Armando, Papa?
Hello, Blancardo...
The deed is done.
Sonia?
She is alive, just as you wanted.
Good.
Raul?
Raul still lives.
So let me get this right...
I'm paying the police to protect me.
Do the police not honor their obligations anymore?
Don't worry.
He will come to you now.
We must figure out how to bring him back.
The woman.
His woman.
Sonia.
Little Sonia.
My little niece.
Fine. Thank you.
Whoa, stop! Hey, Armando!
Esteban, my friend.
Why are you in such a hurry?
They shot your father!
What?
The wedding! Gunmen shooting!
Raul?
Raul and the woman are safe.
Your father, Armando.
Your father is dying.
Let's go!
Fast!
Armando, come.
Yes, Father?
It is me.
Do you remember your mother?
Yes.
I remember her a little.
She was a very beautiful woman.
She was a beautiful woman.
The most beautiful in all of Mexico.
You know, you have her eyes.
You have told me that many times.
The eyes of a small chicken.
Little chicken...
I have been very mean to you.
Calling you stupid all the time, comparing you to donkeys and pigs, laughing at the way you speak.
Giving you to the circus.
Perhaps I have never forgiven you for the accident.
For this, I am very sorry.
I was hoping, when I see your mother in heaven,
I could tell her that her home, and her family are well.
What will I say now, Armando?
You must tell her a lie.
Tell her Raul has married a beautiful woman, and that she will have children and the Alvarez family is known throughout Mexico as an honorable family.
I will tell her a lie.
Because I am ashamed of the truth, Armando.
I am ashamed.
Father...
Father...
I will kill the motherfucker responsible for it.
He was not killed by any man.
He died of shame.
It's Sonia.
She has taken one of the horses.
Find Esteban and look for her, Armando.
Please.
I can help you look for your woman.
But after she has been found, dead or alive, that is the last you will see of me.
Do you think the water will wash off your shame?
Leave me alone, Armando.
I forbid you to swim in this place.
It is sacred to me.
Swim?
No.
I cannot swim.
No one ever taught me how to swim.
Sonia...
Sonia!
Please, Armando, I don't want to live.
You would kill yourself?
You are a fool!
I cannot live.
Don't you know there is no escape for me?
You knew what you were getting into when you came with Raul.
Yes. Yes, I knew.
He talked of living on this ranch, and said everything would be different.
And you believed him?
Yes.
No.
I don't know...
Please, Armando...
Leave me alone.
Raul does not need me.
I have not come for Raul.
I have come for you.
Armando...
I am no good!
I am no better!
Look at them.
So peaceful.
I thought you said this was Raul's woman?
She does not look like Raul's woman to me.
This is Raul's woman.
Sonia, why are you sleeping with this dirty rancher?
Please, Uncle...
Well, whatever makes you happy.
Maybe Raul has no dick.
Lately I've been enjoying all these dick jokes.
What is it that you want?
This is the land of my father.
You are trespassing.
No, we aren't trespassing.
It is you who is trespassing on your brother's woman.
That's a good one too!
Leave us alone.
No.
Take her.
We will see if Raul wants her back.
Stay away!
Or I'll beat you with these hands!
No, no, no. I didn't come to fight.
Kill him.
It is fitting that you should die where your mother died.
If you had only let me rape her, she would not have died that day.
You.
Kiss your mother for me, Armando.
You coward!
Hold on, the gun is still hot.
Shut up!
No.
Let the coyotes take him.
We must save our bullets for the brother.
Let's go.
Do not underestimate Raul.
Raul was foolish to come into my territory.
He will lose everything, including you.
I am Yik'in Chan Kwawiil.
The one that darkens the sky.
The Jaguar King of the mountain.
You know me as the Onza.
Your journey has only now just begun.
It is the time for your vision!
Mexico is no place for cowards.
Save your brother.
Save your family.
Save me.
Kiss your mother for me.
I have hidden inside the mountains, and you have hidden inside yourself.
The hiding place is irrelevant when the hidden hide for no reason.
I will not be struck!
By man or beast!
I am Armando Alvarez!
Again!
I am Armando Alvarez!
One more time.
I am Armando Alvarez!
Good.
I am
Armando Alvarez.
He has Sonia.
Good. I knew you would go with me.
No, Raul.
I'll go alone for her.
Little Armando...
Don't be a fool.
I have been a fool for too long.
Hello, this is the Onza.
How can I help you?
He has assembled a small army.
Let him come.
I am ready for him.
Just keep the Americans away.
They want nothing to do with this.
They want you to kill each other.
Good.
After I kill Raul,
I will kill those fucking Americans.
Okay?
All right.
Bye.
This Onza is such a fucking coward!
Does he think he can come into my house uninvited?
Does he think he can take any woman?
No!
I'm not going to let him kill any more of my own flesh and blood!
This is the end of that fucking Onza!
You know what?
We won't allow him to fuck it up again!
This fucking Onza is done!
You will see that your uncle can provide you with all that Raul promised, and much more.
You're so beautiful.
Thank you.
Bitch!
No one is coming for you.
He will come.
And he will kill you.
Raul?
I do not speak of Raul.
Are you referring to that filthy rancher?
Yes.
Little niece, you are a fool.
I told you a million times, I killed him.
He is dead.
The wind tells me he is not.
I'm jumping!
The one they call the Onza.
My name is Armando Alvarez.
I am talking to you, Onza!
I'm surprised to see you alive.
I want the girl.
Let her go and the two of us will leave.
I can kill you now with one shot.
I am only giving you this one chance.
Release the woman and I will let you live.
Armando, stay there.
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes.
What the fuck, Armando?
You never learned how to roll a cigarette.
I am sorry.
Damn it. I'm dying and you're giving me this piece of shit?
I'm sorry.
Brother.
Yes?
She loves you.
I just realized this.
Go and get her.
Damn, our father would have loved to have seen that.
Go. Go get her.
It's over.
I'm going to meet father now.
Stay here.
No.
Please.
Mexico will be a better place without me.
It's time.
I am Armando Alvarez.
I have come for your life.
How dare you come in like that.
Just like that, without an invitation?
You invited me when you took my woman.
You want her?
Here you go!
And now, you both shall die!
Armando!
Oh, damn it.
I always thought that when this moment arrived there would be a lot of people.
A lot of TV networks.
Police.
The army, the president, and everything...
I won't be there, I won't be able to see it.
Oh, shit.
Armando Alvarez.
You are under arrest for murder and the trafficking of illegal drugs.
You will be extradited to the United States, where you will stand trial.
No, Mr. Blancardo, there will be no trial.
- For my mother.
- You son of a bitch!
You are out of luck, wetback.
Not all Americans are bad, Armando.
Not all Mexicans are drug dealers.
Are you ready, Sonia?
Yes.
Let's go home.
Bye.
Bye.
Do you want to walk?
With every season comes a change
A season ends and a new one comes
But now a season has come to us
It's a no good season
A bird has wings so he can fly
His home is up in the sky
His home is where his heart can sing
Unless he has a broken wing
My whole life has been a struggle
I've chased a dream within a bubble
And now that dream is fading slow
I've made a world only I can know
Is this the end of what we are?
What we were is long ago
I will not let this come to pass
My name is Armando Alvarez
Is there a world where love is free?
A world where love was meant for me
Must I always fight for love?
I will save my family
From this greed and tyranny
God will help me from above
Must I always
I will definitely
Fight for love!
ARMANDO
AND SONIA visions of love
Okay.
Settle down.
Got your ears open?
This is the story of a sad flute a laughin' baby and a weepin' sword.
A long, long time ago in a land far, far away, there lived a warrior... warrior with empty eyes.
He'd trained his entire life for one purpose.
To be the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind.
He'd just achieved his life's ambition, but his heart felt emptier than ever.
These two clans had been warrin' for 500 years.
And they vowed to keep on warrin' until one of them didn't have a single man left above Styx.
And so now, here he was, peerin' down at this very last of his enemy.
When that little warrior princess giggled, it did somethin' to him inside.
But this was no time for feelin'.
For when spared that baby's life, he put his name at the top of his own clan's death list.
With nothin' but the clothes on his back and the baby in his arms, he decided to pay a visit to an old warrior friend in a faraway land.
Hey, Johnny.
I don't like your stinkin' face.
Easy, Ronald.
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.
Good luck for some, bad luck for others.
How can I assist you, my friend from the mystical East?
Uh-oh.
Haven't been here since Smiley kicked the bucket.
Was a 3-day wait just to get your shirts pressed.
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day, he sure liked to make a mess in the after-hours, if you know what I mean.
See you in the morning.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
She will always be the enemy.
Here it is.
Just rub some on your shoulder.
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.
Now, honey,
I didn't forget about you.
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.
Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.
Smiley was always yabberin' on about a guy who was gonna roll into town.
But I shoulda figgered.
What do you call her?
I do not know.
Oh. She's not yours?
Where's her folks?
Dead.
Oo-ee, best we find you another diaper.
Alright.
Smiley like your uncle or something?
Friend.
Well, if you were his friend, maybe he would like for you to take over his laundry.
-- Do not know how.
-- So I'll teach ya.
I always done the laundry around here.
That's how I repaid Smiley for teaching me the sword.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
You stay here, I'll teach you how to tie a diaper properly.
We'll be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.
Alright now, time to get to work.
Dang, you're slower than molasses in January.
You clean that real good, yellow boy.
As clean as Snow White's panties--
If I find the smallest bit of condor crap on my fancy duds...
- Well, we gonna have us--
Didn't I tell you I'd rip 'em off if you don't watch yourself?
Let go, evil midget!
Come on, Eight-Ball, we were just havin' us some fun.
- - Really?
- - Ah!
Okay... okay...
Let go.
- Get outta here!
How 'bout a home-cooked meal for you and your little 'un?
Once that Ferris wheel is finished, it's gonna bring everybody rushin' back,
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."
Hey, Ron.
Welcome to the
Eighth Wonder of the World!
Get down here!
The chow bell ringin'!
Ha!
Bravo, bravo.
Gonna grab some vittles with us?
No thanks.
Not hungry.
I-I-I b-baked a cake.
Come on, Ron!
What the hell's up with her?
You, I knew you was trouble the moment you walked into this--
Sounds even better from inside.
You ever seen one of these before?
The sound it's makin'?
It's called "opera."
Day my poppa found his first chunk of gold, he went out and bought this thing.
Listen.
Here's my favorite part.
So at the edge of the desert, in a busted town full of broken people, the warrior began to learn stuff he shoulda learned a long time ago.
No, no! Rough!
Like the joy of gettin' dirty things clean.
Yes!
Woo hoo! That's me!
Thank you!
I told you to aim at the line, not at the coin!
All right!
He also learned the joy of losing.
You're gonna need blood and bone of about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.
Smiley always tried to get something to grow.
Never, ever lasted too long.
He learned you could be happy workin' with folks.
And findin' the simple peace in some private time after a hard day's work.
What's takin' you so long?
Come on, Skinny!
You gonna miss it. Come on.
And he found that it's nice to have a few friends around when the sun goes down.
But most of all, the warrior learned there's a heck of a lot more pleasure makin' things grow than there is in cuttin' 'em down.
You bunch of pups!
Gimme back that goddamn bottle!
You win.
Show me what you got.
God damn!
I shoulda never taught you this game!
You a shark with a poker face.
What happened to her?
Please!
Help me!
-- Help me!
-- Lynne!
-- Please! Let her go!
-- Someone, help me!
-- Eight-Ball!
-- Lynne!
Hungry?
No?
Pretty thing.
Aagh!
Agh! Aah!
Damn you!
Noooo!
No! Lynne! Lynne!
Agh!
No!
No!
Only thing was, when we went to bury her, she was still breathing.
Never known nobody that close to kickin' it.
We didn't know what to do wit' her, if'n she was gonna live or die.
So we just put her in bed and waited.
Two days, and she was eating soup.
By the day three, she was already sitting up somehow and slinging daggers at the wall.
But God ain't fair.
And some people just ain't cut out for the knife.
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.
It is not your arm.
What'd you say?
Ouch!
Now you sure about this?
'Cause I'm not so good with my eyes open.
Throw.
I can't do it.
Do not talk. Focus.
It is your heart that shakes.
You dead?
Not yet.
Sure you're not fountainin' blood or anything, are ya?
Oh, shit!
Ha!
I did it!
Thank you,
Mr. Sad Flute.
Smiley told me everything.
I just taught you to focus.
Why you do that?
Okay.
I've always been dyin' to know.
Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?
So you got lady Sad Flutes, too?
Sad Flutinas or somethin'?
Yes.
Wow! That's nice.
Jumpin' in the moonlight and kissin' as you both fly under the stars to the tunes of The Sad Flutes--
We are called Sad Flutes because when you cut the throat, the last sound is like a sad flute.
Dang!
Skinny, sure know how to throw a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?
To be strong.
That it?
My father was working in the field.
I was helping him.
A swordsman came.
Killed my father.
Just to test his sword.
That musta hurt you somethin' bad.
Not hurt. Angry.
Course.
No.
I was angry at my father.
Here. Take it.
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.
She said, "If you hold it over your heart when you're sad, it takes away all your sadness."
It works.
Kinda.
Present?
Yeah.
That is your only friend here.
Take good care of it.
Yes, master.
Oh, tarnations.
Only to protect, not kill.
What am I gonna kill in this town, an armadillo?
Is that what I think it is?
You've sealed it.
So they cannot hear.
Hear what?
The weeping.
Of all the souls I have taken.
Who's listenin'?
My past.
And if it hears?
No more music.
This is a big country.
Where do we look?
Do not look.
We listen.
He will show.
Think of the sword as part of the body.
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.
Rather think of it like metal slicin' through a herd of buffalo!
Show me what Smiley taught you.
You do not have the power.
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.
But you are fast.
Just have to be faster.
Ouch!
Ouch! Is this 'cause of yesterday?
'Cause I said I was sorry!
What? Cut it out, Skinny.
I'm serious!
You are slower than molasses in January.
Come on, then!
Ah! Ouch!
Cut it out, Skinny!
Ow!
Stop it, Skinny!
Cut it out!
I'm serious!
Stop!
You bearded nut!
Merry Christmas,
Laundry Man!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Yeah!
We go!
May I have this dance?
Whose birthday?
Well...
It's sort of a long story.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, ya young punks!
Ya gonna take me for a spin or what?
I win.
No.
Until your enemy's heart stops, you have not won.
Is that so?
Did that stop your heart?
Ha! That's better!
Merry Christmas!
I didn't get my invitation.
Has anyone seen it?
No? Huh.
Never mind.
We're all here now.
No harm done.
Ho, ho, ho.
And what did Santa bring you, little boy? Huh?
Why... if it ain't a clown.
You're looking so sad.
Huh.
You know, I never found clowns that funny myself.
Don't worry, clown.
I'm a pretty good shot.
Especially when I've been drinking.
Hey!
Don't go wastin' good moonshine.
Wow.
This shit's smoother'n a calf's ass.
But this-- this party's for girls.
Let's all go to the spilloon!
What have we here?
Looks like we got ourselves another clown.
Take this clown for a walk.
Never quite understood the attraction of a circus.
Till now.
Join the others in Stockton.
I'll catch you up.
Hyah! Hyah!
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories
I'd like to revisit.
Follow me.
Dang it!
He killed my whole family!
God damn it, Baptiste, let me go or I swear I'm gonna--
-- I-I-I'm sorry, Lynne.
-- Lynne.
This ain't just for your protection, you know.
It's for the whole goddamn town.
Let me see!
We have a winner!
Gentlemen?
Maria!
He is your, uh... marido?
My apologies.
I am not the kind of man who sleeps with a married woman.
No.
Por favor.
Gracias, Senor!
Mommy! No!
Oh!
But their daughters...
Oh, that's a completely different matter.
Clean them up.
You get a bullet in the head for every louse I find.
I once strung a man up by his own hamstrings because he cooked me a steak well-done.
What?
Find that funny?
Or is it because of this?
Thank you, gentlemen.
This girl says she'll serve herself up to you instead of the spics.
Have we, uh, met before?
No. We haven't.
This is bound to be a night you will never forget.
You have good teeth.
I like that.
Colonel, as you unwrap me,
I'm sure you will find there's a whole lot more of me to like.
I have no doubt of that.
And though I may be young,
I was hopin' you could teach me a thing or two.
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.
Sharp pain can bring sharp pleasure.
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.
Lynne!
She's not here!
Now I, I might say some things during.
Feel free to answer if you like.
Nothing is too wrong.
I've been waitin' my whole life for a place where it's right to be wrong.
You know, I don't think any part of the body is dirty or bad.
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed
Yes.
Assemble.
Now.
Now where do you plan to begin the inspection?
I like where the skin creases...
Go on.
Between your nice... big...
Moment I smelt your neck... it all came flooding back.
No girl could ever smell as sweet.
You changed it all.
My world.
My face.
You changed my life, little girl.
And now I'm--
I'm going to change yours.
That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.
A hard-on for a scar.
Now that is wrong.
Oops.
I forgot.
Nothing tonight is wrong.
Tell the cook to fry up some potatoes
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you what I was so generously offering ten years ago.
Enjoy the show.
No! He's mine.
-- Lynne...
-- Are you all right?
Cover me!
Hold on!
Lynne!
Agh!
Pull it off.
-- She got the wrong guy.
-- That ain't him.
Oh, God help us.
Merry Christmas!
Sweet mother of God, it's a goddamn butcher shop in here!
I must go or you will all be in danger.
We're in danger already.
Colonel's on the loose.
That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.
Now the Colonel's coming back, and he's bringing the whole damn family.
We need the guy who did that butcher job in the saloon.
Well, I say we all just pack up and leave.
He's right! If you stay and fight, you'll die like rats.
Well, we'll die like rats with rifles.
What rifles?
You got a Chink with a sword and a buncha juggling idiots.
-- How dare you?!
-- That ain't all we got.
Hey!
Beth will understand.
Follow me.
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?
You did what you had to do.
You coulda just grabbed April and hit the trail.
But you didn't.
Knowing saving me would ruin every new thing you found here.
This New World, without you... not so new.
Hey, let's say somehow they all come and go and we're still breathin'.
You're still gonna leave, right?
That is the plan.
Um...
Maybe I could go with you?
Just think about it, alright?
Hey!
That's my primo cactus juice!
Yee-haw! Whoo!
I knew what you was from the get-go.
Don't need to look at the size of a man.
I can smell the blood.
It was on you, too.
Yeah.
Good.
Now, get my jacket clean if you can.
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.
Why die?
'Cause we only got about a hundred sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.
That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.
You also have that.
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.
You do a good shooting.
- For a drunken man.
Why you stopped the shooting?
Well, I just went around robbing banks, hitting trains till I ran into the only force that can truly bring down any outlaw.
Sheriff?
Woman.
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.
What happened then?
There was a couple of Rangers who hadn't forgot about me.
They ambushed me.
Bullets flyin' everywhere.
One of 'em found Beth.
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."
So far...
Well, at least till today...
I done what she asked.
But for fellas like me and you, we are what we are.
If you truly love somethin' or somebody, Laundry Man... you get as far away from 'em as possible.
'Cause we're sand.
They're flowers.
These are yours.
These are to kill.
Come.
Closer.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Remember these places.
Fastest way to kill your enemy.
I will remember.
Company charge!
Oh...
Hey!
What the hell? Agh!
Come on!
Whoo!
Get up there!
Everybody, up there!
Come on men! Agh!
Get him, down there!
Get down.
Shoot them!
Ah!
Okay, let's get out of here.
Shoot them!
Shit.
Dynamite!
Run for your lives!
Take cover!
Ya-hoo!
Shit! We did it!
They hit Jacques!
Come on!
Back to town!
Come on.
Let's close this damn circus down!
Burn it!
Come on!
Kill.
Run.
Hey, come on!
Into the hotel!
Keep low!
Get them!
Here! Take her!
Skinny!
I-I couldn't protect April.
Guard the hallway!
And don't let a damn soul into this room!
What the--
Agh!
One more step, and she's soup.
I said stop!
Yah!
Agh!
That sure is a purty scar
I gave you.
Agh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ugh!
I'll see you in Hell, little girl.
Wear something nasty.
Yaah!
Is this the new life you have found?
Funny.
Look much like the old one.
Do you think you will tell her that you kill her mother, her father and her entire clan?
She is the enemy.
She will always be the enemy.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
Kill her now.
You do not belong here.
I do.
I did.
You have the perfect body for an assassin but the heart of a priest.
Your heart will become your biggest enemy.
You must kill your biggest enemy.
We are assassins.
All that we love, we will destroy.
You are assassin.
All that you love, you'll destroy.
Did we win?
We survived.
Some of us.
I'm not goin' with you.
Am I?
I guess that's the end of them.
No.
It is just the beginning.
What about the baby?
She gonna be safe?
They are listening for this to cry.
Not her.
That's right, Sand Man.
Keep walkin'.
The warrior walked away.
And legend has it, he never stopped walkin', always making sure to keep as much distance as possible between himself and the little gal he loved.
How much?
Free.
People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood.
But it did happen.
I was just 14 years of age when a coward by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down and robbed him of his life and his horse and two California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band.
Chaney was a hired man and Papa had taken him up to Fort Smith to help lead back a string of Mustang ponies he'd bought.
In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and cards and lost all his money.
He got it into his head he was being cheated and went back to the boarding house for his Henry rifle.
When Papa tried to intervene, Chaney shot him.
Chaney fled.
He could have walked his horse, for not a soul in that city could be bothered to give chase.
No doubt Chaney fancied himself scot-free.
But he was wrong.
You must pay for everything in this world, one way and another.
There is nothing free, except the grace of God.
All right!
Is that the man?
That is my father.
If you would like to kiss him, it would be all right.
He's gone home. Praise the Lord.
Why is it so much?
The quality of the cask et and of the embalming.
The lifelike appearance requires time and art.
And the chemicals come dear.
The particulars are in your bill.
If you'd like to kiss him, it would be all right.
Thank you. The spirit has flown.
Your wire said $50.
You did not specify that he was to be shipped.
Well, $60 is every cent we have.
It leaves nothing for our board.
Yarnell, you can see to the body's transport to the train station and accompany it home. I will have to sleep here tonight.
I still have to collect father's things and see to some other business.
Your mama didn't say nothing about you seeing to no business here.
It is business Mama doesn't know about.
It's all right, Yarnell. I dismiss you.
- I'm not sure...
- Tell Mama not to sign anything until I return home and see that
Papa is buried in his Mason's apron.
Your terms are agreeable if
I may pass the night here.
Here? Among these people?
These people?
I'm expecting three more souls.
Sullivan, Smith, and H is Tongue In The Rain.
Ladies and gentlemen, beware and train up your children in the way that they should go.
You see what has become of me because of drink.
I killed a man in a trifling quarrel over a pocket-knife.
If I had have received good instruction as a child...
- Can you point out the sheriff?
- Him with the mustaches.
...I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.
But I hope and pray that you will not slight them and compel them to go into low company.
Stop whimpering, boy!
Well, I killed the wrong man is the which-of-why I'm here.
Had I killed the man I meant to, I don't believe I'd have been convicted.
I see men out there in that crowd is worse than me.
Okay.
Before I am hanged,
I would like to say...
No, we ain't arrested him.
Ain't caught up to him. He lit out for the Territory.
I would think that he's throwed in with Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed a mail hack yesterday on the Poteau River.
Why are you not looking for him?
I have no authority in the Indian Nation.
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S. Marshals now.
- When will they arrest him?
- Not soon, I'm afraid.
The marshals are not well staffed, and I'll tell you frankly,
Chaney is at the end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.
Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?
You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters, do you?
That is a silly question. I am here to settle my father's affairs.
- All alone?
- I am the person for it.
Mama was never any good at sums and she could hardly spell "cat".
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.
Well, nothing prevents you from offering a reward and so informing the marshals.
It would have to be real money, though, to be persuasive.
Chaney is across the river in the Choctaw Nation.
I will see to the money.
Who's the best marshal?
I would have to weigh that.
William Waters is the best tracker.
He's half Comanche and it is something to see him cut for sign.
The meanest is Rooster Cogburn.
He is a pitiless man, double tough, and fear don't enter into his thinking.
He loves to pull a cork.
The best is probably L.T. Quinn.
He brings his prisoners in alive.
He may let one slip by now and again but he believes that even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake.
Where can I find this Rooster?
The jakes is occupied.
I know it is occupied, Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.
I have prior business.
You have been at it for quite some time, Mr. Cogburn.
There is no clock on my business!
To hell with you! How did you stalk me here?
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.
In the saloon, they referred me here. We must talk.
Women ain't allowed in the saloon.
I was not there as a customer. I am 14 years old.
Well, the jakes is occupied.
Will be for some time.
Good evening.
If you would like to sleep in a coffin, it would be all right.
How much are you paying for cotton?
Nine and a half for low middling and ten for ordinary.
We got most of ours out early.
Sold it to the Woodson Brothers in Little Rock for 11 cents.
Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the Woodson Brothers.
We took the balance to Woodson.
We got ten and a half.
Why did you come here to tell me this?
I thought we might shop around up here next year, but I guess we're doing all right in Little Rock.
I'm Mattie Ross.
Daughter of Frank Ross.
A tragic thing.
May I say your father impressed me with his manly qualities.
He was a close trader but he acted the gentleman.
Well, I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father bought.
That, I fear, is out of the question.
I will see that they're shipped to you at my earliest convenience.
We don't want the ponies now. We don't need 'em.
Well, that hardly concerns me.
Your father bought the ponies and paid for them and there is an end of it.
I have the bill of sale.
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that was stolen from your stable.
You'll have to take that up with the man who stole the horse.
Tom Chaney stole the horse while it was in your care. You are responsible.
I admire your sand but I believe you will find
I'm not liable for such claims.
You were the custodian. If you were a bank and were robbed, you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang.
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is is vexing enough.
Secondly, your valuation of the horse is high by about $200. How old are you?
If anything, my price is low.
Judy is a fine racing mare.
I've seen her jump an eight-rail fence with a heavy rider. I'm 14.
Well, that's all very interesting.
The ponies are yours. Take them.
Your father's horse was stolen by a murderous criminal.
I had provided reasonable protection for the creature as per our implicit agreement.
My watchman had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup.
- I will take it to law.
- You have no case.
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle,
Arkansas may think otherwise, as might a jury, petitioned by a widow and three small children.
I will pay $200 to your father's estate when I have in my hand a letter from your lawyer absolving me of all liability from the beginning of the world to date...
I will take $200 for Judy, plus $ 100 for the ponies and $25 for the gray horse that Tom Chaney left.
He was easily worth $40.
That is $325 total.
The ponies have no part in it. I will not buy them.
Then the price for Judy is $325.
I would not pay $325 for a winged Pegasus!
As for the gray horse, it does not belong to you.
The gray horse was lent to Tom Chaney by my father.
Chaney only had the use of him.
I will pay $225 and keep the gray horse.
- I don't want the ponies.
- I cannot accept that.
There will be no settlement after I leave this office. It will go to law.
All right, this is my last offer.
For that I get the release previously discussed and I keep your father's saddle.
The gray horse is not yours to sell.
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.
Lawyer Daggett will prove ownership of the gray horse.
He will come after you with a writ of replevin.
- A what?
- A writ of replevin.
All right, now listen very carefully, as I will not bargain further.
I will take the ponies back, and the gray horse, which is mine, and settle for $300.
Now, you must take that or leave it and I do not much care which it is.
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything under $325.
But I will settle for $320 if
I am given the $20 in advance.
Now, here is what I have to say about that saddle.
Frank Ross's daughter.
Oh, my poor child.
My poor child.
Are you gonna be stayin' with us or are you hurrying back home to your mama?
I'll stay here if you can have me.
I just spent last night at the undertaker's in the company of three corpses.
I felt like Ezekiel in the
Valley of the Dry Bones.
Well, God bless you.
You'll be rooming with Grandma Turner.
We've had to double up, what with all the people in town come to see the hanging.
This was in your poor father's room.
That is everything. There are no light fingers in this house.
If you need something for to tote the gun around,
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.
...I could get him to talk sense about what he found up there.
And we were close enough that
Deputy Marshal Potter and me thought we'd better ride over ourselves and investigate.
What did you see when you arrived?
Old woman was out in the yard, dead, with blowflies on her face.
The old man was inside with his breast blown open by a scattergun and his feet burned.
He was still alive but just was.
Said it was them two Wharton boys done it. Rode up drunk...
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Dying declaration, Your Honor.
Objection's overruled.
Proceed, Mr. Cogburn.
Them two Wharton boys, that'd be Odus and C C, throwed down on him and asked him where his money was.
When he wouldn't tell 'em, they lit pine knots, held them to his feet.
He told them the money was in a fruit jar, under a gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse.
- And then?
- Well, he died on us.
- Passed away in considerable pain.
- What did you do then?
Me and Marshal Potter went out to the smokehouse.
And that rock had been moved and the jar with the money in it was gone.
- Objection. Speculative.
- Sustained.
You found a flat gray rock in the corner of the smokehouse with a hollowed-out space beneath it...
If the prosecutor's going to give evidence, I suggest he be sworn.
Mr. Cogburn, what did you find, if anything, in the corner of that smokehouse?
Found a flat gray rock with a hollowed-out space under it and nothing there.
- Then what did you...
- No jar or nothing.
- What did you do then?
- Well, rode up to the Whartons' near where the North
Fork strikes the Canadian.
- What did you find?
- Branch of the Canadian.
I had my glass.
We spotted them two boys and their old daddy, Aaron, down the creek bank with some hogs.
They'd killed a shoat, had a fire built under a wash pot for scalding water.
- What did you do?
- Announced we was U.S. Marshals.
I hollered out to Aaron that we needed to talk to his two boys.
He raised an axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.
What did you do then?
Backed away from the axe and tried to talk some sense into him.
While this was going on, CC, he edges over to the wash pot there, behind the steam, and picks up a shotgun.
Potter seen him, but it was too late.
CC Wharton pulled down on Potter with one barrel and turned to do the same for me and I shot him.
The old man raised the axe and I shot him.
Odus lit out and I shot him.
CC Wharton and Aaron Wharton were dead when they hit the ground.
Odus was just winged.
Did you find the jar with the $ 120 in it?
- Leading.
- Sustained.
- What happened then?
- I found the jar with $ 120 in it.
What became of Odus Wharton?
There he sits.
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.
Mr. Cogburn, in your four years as U.S.
Marshal, how many men have you shot?
I never shot nobody I didn't have to.
Well, that was not the question.
How many?
Shot or killed?
Let us restrict it to "killed" so that we may have a manageable figure.
About 12, 15.
Stopping men in flight, defending myself, et cetera.
Around 12, he says, or 15.
So many you cannot keep a precise count.
I have examined the records and can supply the accurate figure.
I believe them two
Wharton boys makes it 23.
And how many members of this one family, the Wharton family, have you killed?
Immediate or...
Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Clete Wharton, half-brother?
Clete was selling ardent spirits to the
Cherokee. Come at me with a kingbolt.
A kingbolt?
You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing more than a kingbolt?
From a wagon tongue?
I've seen men badly tore up with nothing bigger than a kingbolt.
- I defended myself.
- Returning to the other encounter, with Aaron Wharton and his two remaining sons.
You sprang from cover with your revolver in hand.
- I did.
- Loaded and cocked?
If it ain't loaded and cocked, it don't shoot.
And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man?
He was armed, he had an axe raised!
I believe you testified you backed away from Aaron Wharton?
- That's right.
- Which direction were you going?
I always go backwards when I'm backing up.
Very amusing.
Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner of Clete Wharton, menacing you with that little old kingbolt or rolled-up newspaper, or whatever it was.
Yes, sir. He commenced to cussing and laying about with threats.
And you were backing away?
How many steps before the shooting started?
Seven, eight steps.
So, Aaron Wharton, keeping pace, advancing away from his campfire, seven, eight steps.
What would that be, 15, 20 feet?
I suppose.
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn, why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by his wash pot, one arm in the fire, his sleeve and hand smoldering?
Did you move the body after you shot him?
Why would I do that?
You did not drag the body over to the fire, fling his arm in?
No, sir.
Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the location of the body.
You do not remember moving the body!
So it was a cold-blooded bushwhack, while poor Mr. Wharton was tending to his campfire.
Objection!
If that's where the body was, I might have moved him. I do not remember.
Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?
Them hogs rooting around, they might have moved him.
I do not remember.
Pencil-neck son of a bitch.
Rooster Cogburn?
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you a minute.
What is it?
They tell me you're a man with true grit.
What do you want, girl?
Speak up, it's suppertime.
Let me do that.
Your makings are too dry.
I'm looking for the man who shot and killed my father, Frank Ross, in front of the Monarch Boarding House.
The man's name is Tom Chaney.
They say he's over in Indian Territory and I need somebody to go after him.
What's your name, girl?
My name is Mattie Ross.
We're located in Yell County.
My mother is at home looking after my sister Victoria and my brother Little Frank.
Best go home to them. They will need help with the churning.
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.
The government will pay you $2 for bringing him in plus 10 cents a mile for each of you.
On top of that, I will pay you a $50 reward.
What are you?
What've you got there in your poke?
My God, a Colt's Dragoon.
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What're you doing with a pistol like that?
- I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.
- Kill Tom Chaney?
If the law fails to do so.
That piece will do the job for you, if you find a high stump to rest it on and a wall to put behind you.
Nobody here knew my father and I'm afraid nothing is going to be done about Chaney except I do it.
My brother is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief.
I don't believe you have $50.
I have a contract with Colonel
Stonehill which he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day once a lawyer countersigns.
I don't believe in fairy tales or sermons or stories about money, baby sister.
But thanks for the cigarette.
Isn't your mama expecting you home, dear?
My business is not yet finished.
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?
Grandma Turner is...
The bed is quite narrow.
The second-floor back did open up but that gentleman on the porch has just taken it.
But don't worry yourself, dear.
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.
My name is LaBoeuf.
I've just come from Yell County.
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.
A saucy line will not get you far with me.
I saw your mother yesterday morning.
She said for you to come right on home.
What was your business there?
This is a man I think you know.
You called him Tom Chaney, I believe.
Though, in the months I've been tracking him, he has used the names
Theron Chelmsford, John
Todd Andersen, and others.
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, before turning up at your father's place.
Why did you not catch him in Pine
Bluff, Arkansas, or Monroe, Louisiana?
He is a crafty one.
I thought him slow-witted, myself.
That was his act.
It was a good one. Are you some kind of law?
That's right.
I'm a Texas Ranger.
That may make you a big noise in that state.
In Arkansas, you should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make you an object of fun.
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?
He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs in Waco, Texas.
The Bibbs family put out a reward.
How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?
My understanding is there was an argument about a dog.
Do you know anything about the whereabouts of Chaney?
He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you earning your bounty.
- Why is that?
- My man will beat you to it.
I have hired a deputy marshal, the toughest one they have.
And he's familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang they say Chaney's tied up with.
Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal.
No.
- Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
- It'll be to our mutual advantage.
Your marshal, I presume, knows the Territory. I know Chaney.
It is at least a two-man job taking him alive.
When Chaney is taken, he's coming back to Fort Smith to hang.
I'm not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting some senator.
It is not important where he hangs, is it?
It is to me. Is it to you?
It means a great deal of money to me. It's been many months' work.
I'm sorry that you are paid piecework and not on wages, and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit.
You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements.
While I sat there watching you, I gave some thought to stealing a kiss, though you are very young and sick and unattractive to boot.
But now I have a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt.
One would be as unpleasant as the other.
If you wet your comb, it might tame that cowlick.
Mattie, I wish you would leave these matters entirely to me, or at the very least, do me the courtesy of consulting me before entering such agreements.
I am not scolding you but I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight corner one day.
I trust the enclosed document will let you conclude your business and return to Yell County.
Yours, J. Noble Daggett.
I was as bad yesterday as you look today.
I was forced to share a bed with Grandma Turner.
I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner.
If she is a resident of this city, it does not surprise me that she carries disease.
This malarial place has ruined my health, as it has my finances.
I owe you money.
You have not traded poorly.
Certainly not!
I am paying you for a horse I do not possess and have bought back a string of useless ponies which I cannot sell again.
- You're forgetting the gray horse.
- Crow bait!
You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.
I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth.
Your illness is putting you down in the dumps.
You will soon find a good buyer for the ponies.
I have a tentative offer of $ 10 per head from the Pfitzer Soap
Works of Little Rock.
It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.
So it would. I am confident the deal will fall through.
Look here. I need a pony. And
I will pay $ 10 for one of them.
No, that's the lot price.
No, no... Wait a minute.
Are we trading again?
This one's beautiful.
He don't know he got a rider. You too light.
Easy, boy.
He think he got a horsefly on him.
He's very spirited. I'll call him Little Blackie.
That's a good name.
What does he like for a treat?
Well, ma'am, he's a horse.
So he likes apples.
- Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.
- No, ma'am.
I ain't supposed to utter your name!
See? Sleep.
That is fine. I will wake him.
Marshal Cogburn?
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.
- How long till you are ready to go?
- Go where?
Into the Indian Territory, in pursuit of Tom Chaney.
You're the bereaved girl with stories of El Dorado.
How much money you got there?
I said $50 to retrieve
Chaney. You did not believe me?
I did not know.
You are a hard one to figure.
How long for you to make ready to depart?
Well, hold on, sis.
I remember your offer but I do not remember agreeing to it.
If I'm to go up against Ned Pepper,
I will need $ 100. That much I can tell you. $ 100.
To retrieve your man, $ 100.
I will take that $50 in advance.
There will be expenses.
You are trying to take advantage of me.
I'm giving you the children's rate.
I'm not a sharper.
I'm an old man sleeping in a rope bed in a room behind a Chinese grocery.
- I have nothing.
- You want to be kept in whiskey.
I don't need to buy that. I confiscate it.
I'm an officer of the court.
Thank you.
$ 100, that's the rate.
I shall not niggle. Can we depart this afternoon?
We?
You are not going.
That is no part of it.
You have misjudged me if you think
I am silly enough to give you $50 and watch you simply ride off.
I'm a bonded U.S. Marshal.
That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done.
Goddamn ducks.
I can't go after Ned Pepper and a band of hard men
- and look after a baby at the same time.
- I am not a baby.
I won't be stopping at boarding houses where there's warm beds and hot grub on the table.
I'll be traveling fast and eating light.
What little sleeping is done will take place on the ground.
I have slept out at night before.
Papa took me and Little Frank coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.
We were in the woods all night.
We sat around a big fire and
Yarnell told ghost stories.
We had a good time.
Coon hunting?
This ain't no coon hunt.
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.
It don't come within 40 miles of being a coon hunt.
You're just tryin' to make your work sound harder than it is.
Here is the money.
I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find somebody who is game.
All I've heard out of you so far is talk.
I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station.
The rest has been braggadocio.
They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you.
I'm not paying for talk.
I can get all the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.
Leave your money.
Meet me here at 7: 00 tomorrow morning.
We'll begin our coon hunt.
Dearest Mother,
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.
I have learned that Tom
Chaney has fled into the wild and I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.
You know that Papa would want me to be firm in the right, as he always was.
So do not fear on my account.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil.
The author of all things watches over me and I have a fine horse.
Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek.
Papa's death will soon be avenged.
I am off for the Choctaw Nation.
Where is Marshal Cogburn?
Went away. Left this.
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it.
By the time you read this, I will be across the river in the Indian Nation.
Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man Chaney.
Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn.
Is that Marshal Cogburn?
- That is the man.
- Who's he with?
I do not know.
Take me across.
So, you're the runaway.
Marshal told me you'd show up.
I'm to present you to the sheriff.
That is a story. Let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.
If you don't turn around and take me across, you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be.
I have a good lawyer.
Hey!
Go, Little Blackie! Come on!
That is quite a horse.
I will give you $ 10 for him.
From the money you stole from me?
That was not stolen.
I'm out for your man.
I was to accompany you.
If I do not, there is no agreement and my money was stolen.
Marshal, put this child back on the ferry.
It's a long road, and time is a-wasting.
If I go back, it is to the U.S. Marshals
Office to report the theft of my money.
And futile, Marshal Cogburn,
"Pursuit would be futile," is not spelt
F-U-D-E-L.
It is time for your spanking.
Now you will do as the grown-ups say or I will get myself a birch switch and stripe your leg!
Are you going to let him do this, Marshal?
No, I don't believe I will.
- Put your switch away, LaBoeuf.
- I aim to finish what I started.
That will be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush-popper.
Hoorawed by a little girl.
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.
In Texas, we will make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips, to heat the night's ration of beans.
And it is Ranger policy never to make your camp in the same place as your cookfire.
Very imprudent to make your presence known in unsettled country.
How do you know Bagby will have intelligence?
He has a store.
That makes him an authority on movements in the Territory?
We have entered a wild place.
And anyone coming in, wanting any kind of supply, cannot pick and choose his portal.
That is a piece of foolishness.
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.
- They have been known to wake up.
- Let me have a rope, too.
A snake would not bother you.
You are too little and bony.
You should fetch water for the morning and put it by the fire.
- The creek's gonna ice over tonight.
- I'm not going down there again.
If you want any more water, you could fetch it yourself.
You're lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so handy.
In my country, you can ride for days and see no groundwater.
I have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint and was glad to have it.
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies who says he has never drank water out of a horse track,
I think I'll shake his hand and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.
You do not believe it?
I believed it the first
25 times I heard it.
Maybe... Maybe it is true.
Maybe lapping water off the ground is Ranger policy.
You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn.
I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.
How long you boys been mounted on sheep down there?
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed.
Now make another joke about it.
You're only trying to put on a show for this girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.
This is like women talking.
Yes, that is the way.
Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.
I think she has you pretty well figured.
Would you two like to hear the story of The Midnight Caller?
One of you is gonna have to be The Caller.
And I will tell you what to say.
And I will do all the other parts myself.
- Good morning, Marshal.
- Morning.
Where is Mr. LaBoeuf?
Down by the creek, performing his necessaries.
Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance for a private parley.
I gather that you and Mr. LaBoeuf have come to some sort of agreement.
And as your employer, I believe I have the right to know the particulars.
The particulars is that we bring Chaney down to the magistrate in San Saba, Texas, where they have a considerable reward on offer, which we split.
I did not want him brought to Texas, to have a Texas punishment administered for a Texas crime.
That was not our agreement.
What you want is to have him caught and punished.
I want him to know that he is being punished for killing my father.
You can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.
You can spit on him and make him eat sand out of the road.
I will hold him down.
If you want, I'll flay the flesh off the soles of his feet and find you an Indian pepper you can rub into the wound.
Isn't that a $ 100 value?
No, it is not.
When I have bought and paid for something, I will have my way.
Why do you think I'm paying you if not to have my way?
It's time for you to learn you cannot have your way in every little particular.
If you find I fail to satisfy your terms,
I will return your money at the end of this expedition.
Little Blackie and I are riding back to the U.S. Marshals Office.
- This is fraud.
- God damn it!
- What's going on?
- This is a business conversation.
Is that what you call it?
It sounds to me like you're still being hoorawed by a little girl.
- Did you say hoorawed?
- That was the word.
There is no hoorawing in it.
My agreement with the marshal antedates yours.
- It has the force of law.
- The force of law?
This man is a notorious thumper.
He rode by the light of the moon with
Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson.
Them men was patriots, Texas trash!
They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.
That's a goddamn lie!
What army was you in, mister?
I was at Shreveport, first with Kirby Smith...
Yeah? What side was you on?
I was in the army of
Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't have to hang my head when I say it.
If you had served with
Captain Quantrill...
Captain?
Captain Quantrill indeed!
- Best let this go, LaBoeuf.
- Captain of what?
Good, then. There's not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas to make it worth my while and listen to your opinions.
- Our agreement is nullified.
- That suits me.
- It's each man for himself.
- Congratulations, Cogburn.
You've graduated from marauder to wet nurse.
We don't need him, do we, Marshal?
We'll miss his Sharps carbine.
It's apt to get lively out here.
Hey!
Go!
Stay here, sister.
I will see Bagby.
Has Chaney been here?
No. Coke Hayes was, two days ago.
Coke runs with Lucky Ned.
He bought supplies with this.
This is Papa's gold piece.
Tom Chaney, here we come.
It's not the world's only
California gold piece.
- They are rare here.
- They are rare.
But if it is Chaney's, it could just as easily mean that
Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him, as that he fell in with them.
Chaney could be a corpse.
That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal. What do we do?
Pursue.
Ned is unfinished business for the marshals, anyhow, and when we have him we'll also have Chaney or learn the whereabouts of his body.
Bagby didn't know which way they went, but now that we know they come through here, they couldn't be going but one of two ways, heading north towards the
Winding Stair Mountains, or pushing further west.
I suspect north. More to rob.
I bought an eating place called The Green Frog, started calling myself Burroughs.
But my drinking picked up and my wife did not care for the company of my river friends.
She decided to go back to her first husband.
He was a clerk in a hardware store.
She said, "Goodbye, Reuben.
"A love of decency does not abide in you."
There's your divorced woman talking about decency.
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola.
"I hope that little nail-selling bastard keeps you happy this time."
She took my boy with her, too.
He never cared for me anyway.
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.
I did not mean anything by it.
You would not want to see a clumsier child than Horace.
I'll bet he broke 40 cups.
Is it Chaney?
I would not recognize the soles of his feet.
Well, you'll have to clamber up and look.
I'm too old and too fat.
The Green Frog had one billiard table, served ladies and men both, mostly men.
I tried running it myself for a while but couldn't keep good help.
And I never did learn how to buy meat.
Is that him?
I believe not.
Well, cut him down.
- Why?
- I might know him.
That was when I went out to the Staked Plains of Texas, shooting buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian named Olly.
The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake City.
Don't ask me what for.
Call it a misunderstanding and leave it go at that.
Well, the big shaggies is about all gone now.
Damned shame.
I'd give $3 right now for a pickled buffalo tongue.
Why did they hang him so high?
I do not know.
Possibly in the belief it'd make him more dead.
I do not know this man.
Why is he taking the hanged man? Did he know him?
He did not.
But it is a dead body.
Possibly worth something in trade.
Well, my second wife, Edna, she got the notion she wanted me to be a lawyer.
Bought this heavy book called
Daniels on Negotiable Instruments and set me to reading it.
Never could get a grip on it.
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.
There ain't six trees between there and Canada, and nothing else grows but has stickers on it.
That's...
I knew it.
- Knew what?
- We're being followed.
I asked that Indian to signal with a shot if someone was on our trail.
Should we be concerned, Marshal?
No. It's Mr. LaBoeuf, using us as bird dogs in hopes of cutting in once we've flushed the prey.
Well, perhaps we could double back over our tracks, and confuse the trail in a clever way.
No, we will wait right here, offer our friend a warm hello, and ask him where he is going.
You are not LaBoeuf.
My name is Forster.
I practice dentistry in the Nation.
Also, veterinary arts and medicine on those humans that will sit still for it.
You have your work cut out for you there.
Traded for him with an Indian, who said he came by him honestly.
I gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of expectorant.
Do either of you need medical attention?
No.
It's fixing to get cold.
Do you know of anywhere to take shelter?
I have my bearskin.
You might want to head over to the Original Greaser Bob's.
He notched a dugout into a hollow along the Carrillon River.
If you ride the river, you won't fail to see it.
Greaser Bob, the Original Greaser Bob, is hunting north of the Picketwire and would not begrudge its use.
- Much obliged.
- I have taken his teeth.
I will entertain an offer for the rest of him.
Take my jack et.
Creep up onto the roof.
If they're unfriendly, I'll give you a sign to damp the chimney.
Who is out there?
We're looking for shelter.
No room for you here. Ride on.
- Who all's in there?
- Ride on.
I'm a Federal officer! Who's in there?
A Methodist and a son of a bitch!
This is Rooster Cogburn.
Columbus Potter and five other marshals is out here with me.
We've got a buck et of coal oil.
In one minute, we will burn you out from both ends.
There's only two of you.
Go ahead and bet your life on it.
How many of you's in there?
Just the two of us, but my partner's hit and he can't walk.
Is that Emmett Quincy?
You said it was a man on the roof. I thought it was Potter.
You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form.
This here's an awful lot of sofky.
You boys looking for company?
That is our supper and breakfast both. I like a big breakfast.
Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think.
And a good store of whiskey here as well.
What are you boys up to, outside of cooking banquets?
We was just having our supper.
We didn't know who was outside, weather like this.
It might have been some crazy man.
Anyone could say he is a marshal.
My leg hurts.
I'll bet it does.
When was the last time you seen your old pard Ned Pepper?
I do not know him. Who is he?
I'm surprised you don't remember him.
He's a skinny fellow, nervous and quick. His lip's all messed up.
That don't bring anybody to mind.
There is a new boy that might be running with Ned.
He's got a powder mark on his face, a black place.
He calls himself Chaney.
Or Chelmsford sometimes.
Carries a Henry rifle.
That don't bring anybody to mind.
Black mark, I would remember that.
You don't remember nothing I want to know, do you, Quincy?
What do you know, Moon?
We don't know those boys you're looking for.
I don't know those boys.
I always try to help out the law.
By the time we get to Fort Smith, that leg will be swelled up tight as Dick's hatband.
It will be mortified and they will cut it off.
And then if you live, that'll get you two or three years in the Federal house up in Detroit, there.
You're trying to get at me.
They'll teach you how to read and write up there but the rest won't be so good.
Them boys, they can be hard on a gimp.
You are trying to get at me.
Now, you give me some good information on Ned,
I'll take you down to
Bagby's store tomorrow and get that ball taken out of your leg.
Then I'll give you three days to clear the Territory.
We don't know those boys you're looking for.
It ain't his leg.
- I was...
- Don't go flapping your mouth, Moon.
- It's best you'd let me do the talking.
- I was saying...
We are weary trappers.
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?
The man Chaney with the marked face killed my father.
He was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to killing in the end.
If you answer the marshal's questions, he will help you.
I have a good lawyer at home and he will help you, too.
I am puzzled by this. Why is she here?
Don't you go jawing with these people, Moon.
Don't you go jawing with that runt.
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not help you.
My leg is giving me fits.
A young fellow like you don't want to lose his leg.
- We seen...
- He's trying to get at you.
- With the truth.
- We seen Ned and Hayes two days ago.
Don't you act the fool! If you blow, I will kill you!
I'm played out. I need a doctor!
We met Ned and Hayes two days ago.
God damn it!
Oh, Lord, I am dying.
Do something. Help me.
I can do nothing for you, son.
Your pard has killed you and I have done for him.
Don't leave me lying here.
Don't let the wolves rip me up.
I'll see you're buried right.
Tell me about Ned.
Where did you see him?
Two days ago. Bagby's store.
They are coming here tonight to get remounts, and sofky.
They just robbed the Katy
Flyer at Wagoner's Switch.
I'm gone.
Send the news to my brother, George Garrett.
He is a Methodist circuit rider in South Texas.
Shall I tell him you was outlawed up?
It don't matter. He knows I'm on the scout.
I will meet him later, walking the streets of glory.
Well, don't be looking for Quincy.
What do we do when they get here?
They ride up. What we want is to get them all in the dugout.
I'll kill the last one that goes in, then we'll have them in a barrel.
You will shoot him in the back?
It'll give them to know our intentions are serious.
Then I'll call down, see if they'll be taken alive.
If they won't, I'll shoot them as they come out.
I'm hopeful that three of their party being dead will take the starch out of them.
You display great poise.
It's just a turkey shoot.
There was one time, in New Mexico, we was being pursued by seven men.
I turned Bo around and taking them reins in my teeth rode right at them boys, firing them two Navy sixes I carry on my saddle.
Well, I guess they was all married men who loved their families as they scattered and run for home.
- Well, that is hard to believe.
- What is?
- One man riding at seven.
- It's true.
You go for a man hard enough and fast enough, he don't have time to think about how many is with him.
He thinks about hisself, how he might get clear of that wrath that's about to set down on him.
Why were they pursuing you?
I robbed a high-interest bank.
You can't rob a thief, can you?
Never robbed a citizen.
Never took a man's watch.
It is all stealing.
That's the position they took in New Mexico.
One man.
I did not figure them to send a scout.
Damn.
Hello?
It is LaBoeuf.
We have to warn him, Marshal.
Too late.
Texas Ranger.
What do we do, Marshal?
We sit. What does he do?
Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.
Well, that's that.
Well, that didn't pan out.
You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner.
- I'm severely injured.
- Yes, you got drug some.
Also shot by a rifle.
That's quite possible. The scheme did not develop as I had planned.
You've been shot in the shoulder, but the bullet passed through.
What happened to your mouth?
I believe I bit myself.
A couple of teeth loose and...
Oh, yeah, the tongue is bit almost through.
Do you want to see if it will knit or should I just yank it free?
I know a teamster who bit his tongue off, being thrown from a horse.
After a time he learned to make himself more or less understood.
I'll just yank it free.
What? What's that, now?
- Knit.
- What's that now?
Knit. It will knit.
Very well. It's impossible to bind a tongue wound.
Too bad, we just run across a doctor of sorts.
- Marshal?
- But I do not know where he was headed.
I saw him, too. It's how I came to be here.
Neither of these men are Chaney.
I know, and I know them both.
That ugly one is Coke Hayes. Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee.
Parmalee and his brothers have a silver claim in the Winding Stair Mountains and I bet that's where
Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.
We'll sleep here, follow in the morning.
We promised to bury the poor soul inside.
Ground is too hard.
If them men wanted a decent burial, they should have got themselves killed in summer.
Sleep well, Little Blackie.
I have a notion that tomorrow we will reach our object.
We are hot on the trail.
It seems that we will overtake Tom
Chaney in the Winding Stair Mountains.
I would not want to be in his shoes.
As I understand it,
Chaney, or Chelmsford, as he called himself in
Texas, shot the Senator's dog.
When the Senator remonstrated,
Chelmsford shot him as well.
Now, you could argue that the shooting of the dog was merely an instance of malum prohibitum, but the shooting of a senator is indubitably an instance of malum in se.
Malla-men what?
Malum in se.
The distinction is between an act that is wrong in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws and mores. It is Latin.
I'm struck that LaBoeuf has been shot, trampled, and nearly severed his tongue and not only does he not cease to talk, but he spills the banks of English.
I was within 300 yards of Chelmsford once.
The closest I have been.
With the Sharps carbine, that is within range.
But I was mounted, and had the choice of firing offhand, or dismounting to shoot from rest, which would allow Chelmsford to augment the distance.
I fired mounted and fired wide.
You could not hit a man at 300 yards if your gun was resting on Gibraltar.
The Sharps carbine is an instrument of uncanny power and precision.
I have no doubt that the gun is sound.
My clothes is all ragged
My language is rough
My bread is corn dodgers, both solid and tough
And yet I am happy, and live at my ease
On sorghum molasses, and bacon and cheese
Greer County Bachelor, that was.
I do not believe he slept.
Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LaBoeuf, but I would encourage the creature you ride to head thither.
Out here, a one-armed man looks like easy prey.
And a one-eyed man who can't shoot?
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?
I'll do fine.
I know where the Parmalee claim is.
I am uninjured and well-provisioned and we agreed to separate.
In conscience, you cannot cite our agreement.
- You're the one who shot me.
- Mr. LaBoeuf has a point, Marshal.
It is an unfair leg-up in any competition to shoot your opposite number.
God damn it! I do not accept it as a given that I did shoot LaBoeuf.
There were plenty of guns going off.
I heard the rifle and I felt the ball.
You missed your shot, Cogburn, admit it.
Missed my shot?
You are more handicapped without the eye than I without the arm.
I can hit a gnat's eye at 90 yards.
That Chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again.
I thought you were gonna say the sun was in your eyes.
That is to say, your eye.
Two at one time!
I will chuck one high. Hold fire.
- There.
- There?
- My bullet.
- Your bullet?
If you hit what you aim at, explain my shoulder!
Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang.
One more. This will prove it.
Please hold fire.
Find our way back!
Very few fiddle tunes I have not heard.
Once heard, they're locked into my mind forever.
Lucky Ned?
Lucky Ned!
Very good, Cogburn. Now what?
Oh, God damn it.
Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store.
That is silly. You have not eaten all day, and it is my store, not his.
Let him starve!
He does not track! He does not shoot, except at foodstuffs!
- That was your initiative.
- He does not contribute.
He's a man who walks in front of bullets!
Mr. LaBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang while we fired safely from cover.
We?
It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his own defense!
I can speak for myself.
I am hardly obliged to answer the ravings of a drunkard.
It is beneath me.
I shall make my own camp elsewhere.
It is you who have nothing to offer, Cogburn.
A sad picture indeed.
This is no longer a manhunt. It is a debauch.
The Texas Ranger presses on alone.
Take the girl. I bow out.
A fine thing to decide once you brought her into the middle of the Choctaw Nation.
I bow out! I wash my hands!
Gentlemen, we cannot fall out in this fashion.
Not so close to our goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand.
In hand?
If he is not in a shallow grave somewhere between here and Fort Smith, he is gone!
Long gone!
Thanks to Mr. LaBoeuf, we missed our shot.
We've barked, and the birds have flown!
Gone, gone, gone!
Lucky Ned and his cohort gone.
Your $50 gone!
Gone the whiskey, seized in evidence!
The trail is cold, if there ever was one.
I'm...
I'm a foolish old man who has been drawn into a wild-goose chase by a harpy in trousers and a nincompoop!
Well, Mr. LaBoeuf, he can wander the
Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes.
Perhaps the local
Indians will take him in and honor his gibberings by making him chief!
You, sister, may go where you like.
Our engagement is terminated.
I bow out.
- I am going with you.
- That is not possible.
Have I held you back?
I have a Colt's Dragoon revolver which I know how to use, and I will be no more of a burden to you than I was to the marshal.
That is not my worry. You've earned your spurs. That is clear enough.
You've been a regular old hand on the trail.
But Cogburn is right, even if I would not give him the satisfaction of conceding it.
The trail is cold and I am considerably diminished.
How can you give up now after the many months you've dedicated to finding Chaney?
You have shown great determination.
I misjudged you.
I picked the wrong man.
I would go on in your company if there were a clear way to go.
But we'd be striking out blindly.
Chelmsford's gone.
We chased him right off the map.
There's nothing for it.
I'm bound for Texas.
Time for you to go home, too.
The marshal, when he sobers, is your way back.
I will not go back. Not without Chaney, dead or alive.
I misjudged you as well.
I extend my hand.
Mr. LaBoeuf, please.
I know you.
Your name is Mattie. You're little Mattie the bookkeeper.
Isn't that something?
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.
- What are you doing out here?
- Come to fetch some water.
I mean, what are you doing in these mountains here?
I have not been formally deputized but I'm acting as an agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge Parker's court.
I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.
Well, I will not go.
How do you like that?
There is a posse of officers up there who will force you to go.
That is interesting news.
How many is up there?
Right around 50. And they're all well-armed and they mean business.
What I want you to do now is come on across the creek and walk in front of me up that hill.
I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.
Well, if you refuse to go,
I will have to shoot you.
Well, then, you had better cock your piece.
All the way back.
- Till it locks.
- I know how to do it.
- You will not go with me?
- No, it's just the other way around.
You're going with me.
- I did not think you would do it.
- Well, what do you think now?
One of my short ribs is broken.
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.
I have one of the gold pieces you stole from him. Now give me the other.
- Nothing's gone right for me.
- Mattie!
- I'm down here.
- Now I'm shot by a child.
Chaney is taken into custody.
- Help me!
- Mattie!
Marshal!
Take them horses you got and move!
Tom, you get on up that hill. Don't you stop.
- Who all's down there?
- Marshal Cogburn and 50 more officers.
You tell me another lie and I'll stove your head in.
Just the marshal.
Rooster.
Cogburn! You hear me?
You answer me, Rooster!
I will kill this girl.
You know I will do it.
The girl is nothing to me!
She's a runaway from Arkansas!
That is all very well. Do you advise that I kill her?
Do what you think is best, Ned!
She's nothing to me but a lost child.
Think it over first.
I have already thought it over.
You get mounted double fast!
If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest, I will spare the girl.
You have five minutes!
There will be a party of marshals here soon, Ned!
Let me have the girl and Chaney, and
I will mislead them for six hours.
Too thin, Rooster. Too thin!
Your five minutes is running! No more talk.
Get on up that hill!
Quiet there.
- Farrell, see to Tom's wound.
- Can I have some of that bacon?
You help yourself.
Have some of the coffee.
I do not drink coffee. I'm 14.
Well, we do not have buttermilk and we do not have bread.
- We are poorly supplied.
- Where is she?
- What are you doing here?
- I ought to wring your scrawny neck.
You let that go.
What happened, huh?
I will tell you and you will see that I am in the right.
Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort Smith, and robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare.
I was informed Rooster Cogburn had grit and I hired him to find the murderer.
A few minutes ago, I came upon
Chaney watering the horses.
He would not be taken in charge and I shot him.
If I had killed him, I would not be now in this fix. My revolver misfired.
It will do it. It will embarrass you every time.
Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns, do you?
I do not care a thing in the world about guns.
If I did, I would have one that worked.
I was shot from ambush, Ned.
My horses was blowing and making noise. That officer got me.
How can you sit there and tell such a big story?
That pit is 100 feet deep and I will throw you in it.
I'll leave you to scream and rot! How do you like that?
No, you won't. This man will not let you have your way.
He is your boss and you have to do as he tells you.
Well, nothing's going my way.
Was that Rooster waylaid us night before last?
It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.
You and Cogburn. Quite the posse.
- Let us move, Ned.
- In good time, Doctor.
What happened to Quincy and The Kid?
They are both dead.
I was in the very middle of it.
It was a terrible thing to see.
Please, let us move,
Ned. The marshal's gone.
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- I need a good judge.
What happened to Coke Hayes, the old fellow shot off his horse?
Dead as well. His depredations have come to an end.
Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners.
He is not my friend.
He's abandoned me to a congress of louts.
You do not varnish your opinion.
Are we off?
Let us cut up the winnings from the Katy Flyer.
There'll be time for that at The Old Place.
- I will mount the bay.
- I have other plans for you.
- Must I double-mount with the doctor? - No.
No, too chancy with two men up if it comes to a race.
Tom, you wait here with the girl.
When we reach Ma's house, I'll send
Carroll back with a fresh mount.
You will be out by dark, and we will meet you at The Old Place.
I do not like that.
Let me ride with you, Ned, just out of here anyway.
- We're short a horse.
- Marshals will come swarming.
Hours, if they come here at all.
They'll think that we've all gone.
I am not staying here by myself with Tom Chaney.
- That's the way I will have it.
- He will kill me.
You heard him say it.
He's killed my father and now you will let him kill me.
He will do no such thing.
Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress
Forks, near the log meeting house?
When you are mounted, you take the girl and leave her there.
Do you understand, Tom?
Any harm comes to that child, you do not get paid.
Harold, let me ride up with you.
Farrell!
I will pay you $50 out of my winnings. I am not heavy.
Do the calf again, Harold!
Everything is against me.
You have no reason to whine.
If you act as the bandit chief instructed, and no harm comes to me, you will get your winnings at The Old Place.
Lucky Ned has left me, knowing I am sure to be caught when I leave on foot.
I must think over my position and how I may improve it.
Where is the second
California gold piece?
- What have you done with Papa's mare?
- Keep still.
Are you thinking about The Old Place?
Look here, if you let me go, I will swear to it in an affidavit and once you are brought to justice it may go easier on you.
I tell you, I can do better than that.
I need no affidavit.
All I need is your silence.
Your father was a busybody like you.
In honesty, I do not regret shooting him. He thought Tom Chaney was small.
And you, you would give me an affidavit.
You're all against me. Every...
So that is Chelmsford.
Strange to be so close to him at last.
Mr. LaBoeuf. How is it that you are here?
I heard a shot and went down to the river.
Cogburn outlined a plan. Mind your footing, there's a pit there.
His part, I fear, is rash.
He returns for Lucky Ned.
Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?
One against four? It is ill-advised.
He would not be dissuaded.
Hello, Ned.
How many men is with the girl?
Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force.
She was in excellent health when last I saw her.
Farrell, I want you and your brother to stand clear.
You as well, Doctor. I have no interest in you today.
What is your intention, Rooster?
You think one on four is a dogfall?
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.
Or see you hanged in Fort Smith at Judge Parker's convenience.
Which will you have?
I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!
- Shoot them, Mr. LaBoeuf.
- Too far. Moving too fast.
Well, Rooster,
I am shot to pieces.
It seems neither of us is to see Judge Parker.
Oh, Lord.
Some bully shot! That was 400 yards, at least.
Well, the Sharps carbine is a...
Stand up, Tom Chaney.
Mr. LaBoeuf.
Are you alive?
Mr. LaBoeuf!
Mr. LaBoeuf!
Mr. LaBoeuf!
Are you there?
- I'm here!
- Can you clamber out?
I cannot.
- There are snakes.
- They awake?
Yes.
I am bit!
- Does Mr. LaBoeuf survive?
- He does.
Even a blow to the head could silence him for only a few short minutes.
Where are you bit?
Look away now.
I have her. Up with us!
We're up, Mr. LaBoeuf. Take her.
She's snakebit.
We're off. I'll send help for you as soon as I can.
Don't wander off.
We are not leaving him.
I must get you to a doc, sis, or you're not gonna make it.
I'm in your debt for that shot, pard.
Never doubt the Texas Ranger.
Go on!
Ever stalwart.
We must stop. Little
Blackie is played out.
We have miles yet.
Come on, you!
No!
That's it. Come on, now!
No, stop!
He's getting away.
Who's getting away, sis?
Chaney.
No. No!
No, no, no!
No, no!
No!
I've grown old.
A quarter century is a long time.
By the time we reached Bagby's store, my hand had turned black.
I was not awake when I lost the arm.
The marshal had stayed with me, I was told, till I was out of danger.
But he departed before I came round.
Once home, I wrote him with an invitation to come by the next time he found himself near Yell County and collect the $50 I still owed him.
I did not hear back from Marshal
Cogburn and he did not appear.
Then one day I received a note from the marshal with a flyer enclosed.
He said he was traveling with a Wild West show, getting older and fatter.
Would I like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis and swap stories with an old trail mate?
He would understand if the journey were too long.
Brief though his note was, it was rife with misspellings.
Yessum?
I am Cole Younger.
This is Mr. James.
It grieves me to tell you that you have missed Rooster.
He passed away three days ago when the Show was in
Jonesboro, Arkansas.
Buried him there in the
Confederate cemetery.
Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss" and I believe the warm weather was too much for him.
We had some lively times.
What was the nature of your acquaintance?
I knew the marshal long ago.
We too had lively times.
Thank you, Mr. Younger.
Keep your seat, trash.
I had the body removed to our plot and I have visited it over the years.
No doubt people talk about that.
They say, "Well, she hardly knew the man.
"Isn't she a cranky old maid?"
It is true, I have not married.
I never had time to fool with it.
I heard nothing more of the Tex as officer LaBoeuf.
If he is yet alive, I would be pleased to hear from him.
I judge he would be in his 70s now, and nearer 80 than 70.
I expect some of the starch has gone out of that cowlick.
Time just gets away from us.
RED HILL (2010)
Alice...
Have you seen my gun?
Somewhere.
Thought I had packed it with the photos.
Alice?
Honey?
Is everything okay?
I'm okay.
Come on Sweetie, come here.
What happened?
Was it cramps?
I'm just scared.
Yeah, I know.
Everything's okay though, right?
Right.
You couldn't find it?
No, I don't have time to look.
I'm sure the Inspector will understand.
I hope so.
Are you nervous?
No.
Kinda feels like my first day.
I'm sure you will a very good impression.
I should go.
I love you.
Me too.
You are not taking the car?
Well, you might want to go into town.
I can walk.
You can waddle.
Do you even know where you're going?
No idea.
Good morning. I'm Richard Morecroft with national and regional news.
We've just received news that there's been a large explosion...
at Western Bay Maximum Security Prison.
The residents of the area were awoken around 8 AM...
for what's being described as a large booming sound.
Hey..
I was just...
That's okay.
Constable Shane Cooper reporting for duty.
Sergeant Jim Barlow.
Old Bill said you would be coming by.
So did you just get into town?
Uh yeah, late last night.
How was your drive?
Well, it would have been quicker if my wife didn't have to pee every two minutes.
What? She's got some sort of bladder problem?
No, no, she's pregnant.
Oh, that's great.
It's horseshit and you know it.
Bullshit!
Don't say that.
Hey, Manning...
Don't bother me, Barlow.
I'm late.
Manning, come here, there's someone I want you to meet.
This is Shane Cooper. The new guy.
He's having marriage difficulties.
So is the Inspector in here or...
No, Old Bill's at Town Hall this morning.
He wanted me to send you there.
Well, you gonna tell me where it is? Or...
Oh jeez, I'm sorry...
Gonna have to get used to having a city boy around.
You go back to the main road and turn right.
You go up the hill, pass the information center...
Information Center?
Oh yeah, you can't miss it,
There's a historical exhibit on the front window.
Alright.
Oh, Shane?
You won't tell Old Bill
I was sleeping, will you?
Not unless you tell him
I was late.
Oh, you guys know there's a horse loose in the parking lot?
Yeah, that's our Betsy. She lives here.
Of course she does.
I often wonder what this town would of been like... back when it was thriving.
When it had a sense of purpose and pride.
And since that time we've had the logger shut down, the sewing mill abandoned, and crops reduced to dust, and the high country... riped off for a national reserve.
Well, it turns out fitly... the Martha here suggests that we rub the last scrap of business... out of this godforsaken town.
That is not the point, Bill, and you know it!
Instead of living in the past... this city ought to be looking towards new revenue streams.
You're not suggesting we host a food and wine festival, are you?
Our forefathers didn't sacrifice their blood, sweat, and tears... so that a bunch of wankers could come here and sip fucking Pinot!
For those who want to destroy this town, they better deal with me first... cause I'm not going down without a fight!
Where's your gun, Constable?
Sir?
Inspector?
Look, I arrived late last night...
I had a house full of boxes...
Why didn't you unpack it?
Sir, I didn't know where it was.
So you lost it?
No sir, I just didn't have time to find it.
If you knew where it was, you would have unpacked it.
Sir...
You know that losing a police issued firearm is a serious offense?
I'd be happy to report the firearm is formally missing, if you fell that it's required, sir.
Don't go crawling up my ass just yet Constable.
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Yes, sir.
You are the transfer assigned?
Personal reasons, I guess.
What sort of personal reasons?
Just give us a minute, Slim.
If I'm gonna be your superior, there's nothing that you can't share with me.
Now, to be honest with you, Shane... when a blowing from the big smokes requests to be transferred to my outpost...
I count on two things.
Either he's lazy looking for what he thinks is a cushy bait or he's an upstart looking for an easy promotion.
"So which one are you?
It's nothing like that, sir.
Then what is it?
It's my wife, sir.
We lost...
We lost our last pregnancy at six months.
The doctor said we should move somewhere quiet, away from the city.
Try and keep her blood pressure down.
And here's something I haven't seen in a while.
The Carlin brothers riding on horseback.
Bill.
What's the occasion, Micky?
Gleason lost the herd this morning.
Old Jerry Patrick forgot to shut the gate again, did he?
Oh no, reckon something spooked them bad.
Stampede broke the fence.
Where they head to?
You are not gonna tell anyone, are you, Billy?
Not unless you don't come back.
This is Shane Cooper the new Constable.
You boys better try and make it back before the storm hits.
It'll only spook the horses even more if we don't.
Well, be good now.
Are they not allowed to ride in those mountains?
Not since the government bought them off.
Heaven forbid...
Somebody once step on a flatten flower.
Yeah.
Useless.
Good to see that business is booming, Ted.
Someone's gotta feed Ken's medicine.
Got a look at your file.
It's not very poor.
Thank you, sir.
What was the counselling for?
You did that, police counselling.
It was mandatory.
Why?
I was shot on duty, sir.
Post-traumatic stress?
No, sir.
Then why did they send you?
I guess they thought it was my fault.
What, you shot yourself?
No, sir.
Well, who did?
A kid.
He was strung out, he pulled a concealed weapon, I pulled mine and...
You couldn't pull the trigger.
He was just a kid.
He was a kid with a gun.
That's one way of looking at it.
Well, what's the other way, Constable?
Well, maybe he needed help, not a bullet.
What? You disagree, Inspector?
We would be having a different conversation if you were dead.
Bill, come in.
Over.
Yeah, it's me. Go ahead.
Quick call from Gleason.
He wants one of us to go out to his property.
Take a look at something.
Is it about the missing horses?
Yes, he says he found out what caused the stampede.
You wanna come by the fort.
No. I'll send Cooper up to you.
It's about time we brought him in.
Copy that.
Once you get to the top of the hill...
There's a communications tower.
Property's six klicks south of that.
Okay. So I'll just take the car out back?
No, that's mine.
Okay.
What about the car out front?
Barlow's.
Well, how am I supposed to get to Gleason's property?
Whew.
Mr. Gleason?
Debbie, I understand the breakout occurred just a few hours ago.
That's right, Richard.
This morning at approximately 8AM,
a huge explosion ripped through the southern wall of the facility.
Initially, prison officers were unsure as to
how many inmates, if any, had escaped.
But we can now confirm the identity of the man the police is searching for.
Dural Conway, also known as "Jimmy"...
was convicted of murdering his wife...
and the attempted murder of a Red Hill police officer in 1995.
Conway was sentenced to life in prison.
The police are urging the public to not approach the man,
as he is considered armed and dangerous.
Thanks very much, Debbie,
and we will be giving you all the updates on the story as they come in.
What kind of animal is capable of such a thing?
It scares me to ponder.
Certainly isn't from anything local.
When I was a kid...
My father swore he had seen a panther up in them hills.
Some of the locals claim they had seen the same thing.
How the hell does a panther end up roaming high country Australia?
Travelling circus, so the story goes.
Apparently two of the bastards escaped from the show in 1880.
And one of them was pregnant.
Lucky for us, Panthers don't breed like rabbits.
I seen you ride in on that horse.
Did Manning put you up to it?
That man was born a bastard.
Just look where you want to go... and the horse will follow.
Ahem. Ahem.
Come on.
Dural Conway, also known as Jimmy
is approximately 175 cm tall...
of Aboriginal descent, and of median build with short brown hair.
He can be recognized by the distinct burn scars...
along the left hand side of his face and upper body.
Officials have now confirmed...
that the explosion was caused by the detonation of a gas line...
leading through the prison wall.
Did they know how the inmate was able to get into the gas line?
Yes Richard, following the discovery of a 3m hole dug into solid concrete.
Prison officers now believe...
Prison officials are greatly concerned for the whereabouts of the suspect...
Barlow?
What's going on?
Do we have a history of his previous arrests?
Indeed, Richard.
Convicted of murdering his wife...
and the attempted murder of a
Red Hill police officer in 1995...
Conway was sentenced...
Old Bill's the one who put him away.
Police are urging the public not to approach the man...
as he is considered armed and dangerous.
Now we all here.
Alright, here is what we know.
Approximately 9 AM today...
Jimmy Conway break out of the
Maximum Security Prison at Western Bay.
45 minutes later, he was spotted stealing a white 86 Falcon...
Registration MKC-489... from a BP service station in Jackson.
Alright, now...
From Jackson, it's about a six-hour haul to Red Hill.
So that gives us exactly two hours to lock this town down.
Manning, you'll take the freeway exit.
Rex, you'll cover the hard country bypass in case he takes the scenic route.
My bet is he's gonna try and flank us... so I'm gonna cover Alpine Drive.
So Dale, you ride with me... and Willy, you ride with Manning.
Now, Barlow.
I want you here to monitor the wire.
Alright, you'll feed us if there are any updates.
And you put out a storm warning.
There's a big one hitting our way tonight, so keep everyone indoors.
Right. Earl, Slim, Ted.
I want you to secure up Main Street.
Earl, you good with the scope, so make sure you get a good vantage point.
Kenny.
You stay with Barlow and secure the station, because if he strikes, this will be the first place he hits.
What's funny?
A bit overkill, Billy?
Jimmy Conway... was the best bromley tracker this town ever had.
You'll hold your positions and you'll be armed at all times. You understand?
Any questions?
What about Gleason?
No, we'll leave him out of this one.
What's he gonna do, throw his walking cane?
I'd like to know who's gonna cover Skins Creek Road.
Jimmy won't take Skins Creek Road.
What makes you so sure?
Cause I know the way he moves.
He'll be after the smallest track with the most cover.
Maybe he thinks you are thinking that... so maybe he'll do something different.
No harm posting a man for a piece of mourn, Billy.
Cooper.
You'll cover Skins Creek Road.
Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir."
Everybody armed?
Slim, you need one, right?
Nobody leaves here without a weapon.
That includes you too, Constable.
Give him something.
Alright, the radios.
I want everyone to tune into channel four.
If the shit hits the van...
We'll stay off the wire and regroup at Earl's barn. And listen!
We all know what we're dealing with here.
If Jimmy Conway rides into this town, he'll be bringing hell with him.
Shoot to kill.
Alright, you heard the man.
Move out.
Inspector?
Listen, I don't want to cause any unnecessary stress, but I just came... from Gleason's Property and he seems to think there's a Panther roaming the area.
Jesus, Cooper.
This in Australia, mate.
Not fucking Africa.
Adonis? Adonis.
Luca. Luca.
Hey, honey.
Howdy, sheriff.
How's your first day?
You know, working hard.
I bet you are.
You are never gonna guess where I found your gun.
It was tucked under the towels...
Good to know. Listen honey,
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Okay, I love you.
Love you too. Bye.
How are we doing today?
Attention all positions.
We have just received word that Conway's getaway vehicle
has been found abandoned in Winston.
Please, please put the gun down.
Nobody needs to get hurt, okay?
Putting it down, you see.
You gotta let them go.
You want this?
I'm gonna put it down slowly.
Nice and easy. There you go.
Okay.
You gotta let them go now.
You don't need them.
Take it easy.
Easy.
Radio Check. Come in, Cooper. Over.
Radio Check. Come in, Cooper. Over.
Cooper, you there?
Bill... look...
I don't want you to start sweating, but... we've lost contact with Cooper.
Jimmy. Mate... look, there's no need...
No...
Barlow, come in, over.
Barlow, come in, over.
Barlow, come in.
Barlow, answer your radio.
Goddamn it, Barlow, answer your fucking radio.
No!
Wait!
Well, after he pulled down the relay tower... he softened off the tank and legged it.
Did he say anything?
No.
Which way did he go?
Headed to town, I suppose.
Fuck.
It's him, Billy...
It's fucking him.
Has he seen you?
I don't know.
Stay where you are.
Manning and I are on our way back.
Rex, you copy that?
I'm moving, I'll be there in ten.
Hold your positions and stay off the wire.
Please...
I'll give you anything.
Tell me what you want.
Police!
Hello!
Please don't kill me.
I don't want anybody to get hurt, Jimmy.
I promise you, Jimmy.
Please don't kill me, Jimmy.
You black bastard.
Jimmy.
Please Jimmy.
Jimmy, Jimmy, please, Jimmy.
Please, Jimmy. No.
Jimmy.
Please, Jimmy, no, no.
Jimmy, no, Jimmy.
I'm watching them now, Bill.
You are not gonna believe this, man.
He shot him, he shot Slim.
He just shot him man.
Rex, I told you to stay off the fucking wire.
Jimmy
Shit.
Hey.
I'm gonna die.
Don't say that.
I'm going to hell.
I know it.
You'll be okay.
What do you think he's doing?
He's waiting for us.
You call flanking him, Bill?
What do you wanna do?
We're moving... on foot.
What's happening?
No. .. no... no...
Easy, easy!
It's me. It's me, Shane.
Barlow. Where's Bill?
He's killing us all...
Where is Bill?
I don't know!
What do you mean, you don't know?
Is he dead?
I don't know, I don't fucking know!
The phones, radios, the mobiles, nothing's fucking working.
It's payback.
Earl's Barn? Do you know where it is?
He's here for payback.
And he won't stop.
Nothing's gonna stop him.
Bill said that if shit hits the van, we'll make it to Earl's barn.
He's hunting us down like dogs.
Where the fuck is Earl's barn?!
Oh fuck.
Oh fuck me.
What is it?
Billy.
Oh fuck.
Oh shit.
You gonna keep quiet, okay?
Don't leave me here.
I'll come back for you.
Please, please.
I don't want to die.
You aren't die.
No, you don't understand.
He's gonna kill us all.
Shane, please, mate.
Here.
Don't fucking move.
Fuck!
I'm going out...
What the fuck do we do?
We're pinned.
Shit.
Go, go, go, go!
No.
I saw him Bill, with my own eyes.
He's hunting us like fucking dogs.
Where's Earl?
Dead.
What about Rex?
We are all that's left.
He's here for payback.
If we don't stop him, we are all gonna die!
You think you can scream any louder?
We gotta do something, Bill.
Dale, get the horses.
Where's the backup, Bill?
We'll play him in his own game.
We stop running.
We start hunting.
Bill, where's the backup?
There isn't any.
He's taken out all communications.
Surely, we can send somebody for help?
Nearest town is an hour's ride.
So?
So we deal with this fucking situation ourselves!
He's right, Bill.
Listen to him.
We have to have backup.
We got a convicted murderer out there killing every men in this town and you're suggesting we don't call it in?
Yes.
Old Gleason's got a satellite phone.
We can use that for backup.
Shut up, Barlow.
He does, he uses it for emergencies.
I'm calling it in.
No, you're not.
The hell's going on here?
You tell me, son.
Jimmy Conway killed every local you put up against him.
But when he came to me...
He dropped me to the outskirts of the town.
Now, why do you think that is?
If you got something to say, you go right ahead and say it.
Billy?
Barlow's died.
Dale... saddle up three horses.
Turn the others loose.
Seems Cooper here won't be joining us.
That's a mighty fast draw for someone who's never shot a bullet.
One sec.
Constable here hasn't got the nerve to pull the trigger, do you son?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Fuck! Fuck!
Just look where you want to go.
Mr. Gleason!
Mr. Gleason!
Mr. Gleason!
This is High Country patrol,
Please state your emergency.
This is officer Shane Cooper of Red Hill District 208.
I'm requesting immediate backup.
We have an escapee Jimmy Conway roaming the area.
He's heavily armed and on the loose.
We've lost all communications.
One officer is dead along with several civilians.
I'm requesting immediate backup.
Over.
Received, 208.
What is the current location of the suspect?
I don't know. I don't know.
He's roaming the whole fucking area.
Look. Just send all available units and send them...
No.
Mr. Gleason!
Mr. Gleason!
Mr. Gleason?
He's out there, isn't he?
When I saw on the news that he had escaped...
I knew he would come for us.
Why don't you step down from there... and we could talk about this?
No.
This is something I should have done a long time ago.
He's an innocent man, Shane.
What are you saying?
Fifteen years ago...
the government was buying up the land.
They were going to cut a train line through the mountains.
But Jimmy found a sacred burial site.
Bill tried to stop him,
but Jimmy went public.
What did you do?
What did you do?
I've written everything down... exactly as I remembered.
Shane?
Hey
How's your day?
It was great.
You cut your face.
Oh, it's just a scratch.
The Inspector's got us rounding up cattle.
I'm sorry that we had to move.
Don't you ever say that... because we're in this together.
All three of us.
He has been kicking like crazy tonight.
Your dinner's in the fridge.
I'll eat when I get back.
Are you going out again?
I have to.
Why did you come home for?
You.
Bye.
Shane?
Be careful, cowboy.
Spread out, boys.
We bring him to us.
Dale?
Dale?
Jimmy...
I got a wife now.
Manning?
Dale
Come on, Jimmy.
I know you're out there!
You wanna know whether she survived?
You kill me, you'll never know.
If it isn't the black killer himself!
Didn't count on seeing you for another 30 years, Jimmy.
Don't tell me they've let you loose.
Want me to make a citizen's arrest,
Billy?
Throw the book at him.
I don't know what I like doing more...
Killing you or nailing your fucking wife.
You best put that gun down.
What the fuck are you doing, Cooper?
I'm taking you in, Bill.
You put the gun down. That's an order!
You... and your friends... are under arrest for the rape and murder of Ellin Conway.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I've got a sworn statement, right here.
After Jimmy stopped the train line...
You rounded up a posse for retribution.
But there was only so much Jimmy could take.
You beat him, shot him...
and burned.
But you didn't kill him, did you, Bill.
So you had your men... your boys... testify against him for a murder he didn't commit.
Nice story, kid.
But, you got no evidence.
You buried her on top of Eagle's Ridge.
Shane!
You put that gun down or I'll have you shot!
He's bluffing, boys.
Go ahead, shoot him.
You don't have the balls to pull the trigger.
Who the fuck are you?
You know nothing about this town.
I know the law.
You're not the law in this town.
I am!
This is my town!
My town!
I got Jimmy a chance, but no... he wanted to be a hero!
And for what?
Bones in the fucking ground!
Jimmy?
Jimmy!
You don't have to do this.
Come on, kill me. Come on!
We were going to have a boy.
We are gathered here today to immortalize in song the life and untimely death of a great legend.
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn and assorted confections while we tell you the strange and bewildering tale of a hero who has yet to enter his own story.
Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake.
Okay, everybody, let's take it from the top.
The stage is set, the night moist with apprehension.
Alone in her chamber, the princess prepares to take her own life.
"It is far better to nourish worms than to live without love."
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio plots his ascension to the throne while her aging father lies gravely ill.
"Yes, I am gravely ill."
"Hark, who goes there?"
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero, returning to rescue his emotionally unstable maiden!
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue, or taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!
The sting of my...
Dr. Marx?
Dr. Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.
Mr. Timms? You were good.
Perhaps a little too good.
What's that, Victor? My character's undefined? That's absurd.
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified to bask in the adulation of his numerous companions?
The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
I could be the sea cap'n returning from a mighty voyage to reclaim his mechanical arm!
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist, battling pythons down in the Congo!
Down, Chongo, down!
And if you desire romance,
I will become the greatest lover the world has ever known!
I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you.
You know, the womens find me uncomfortably good looking.
But you seem remarkably at ease.
Stop it. No, really.
Well, if you must. What are you doing?
That tickles. Are those real?
That's it! Conflict.
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!
What our story needs is an ironic, unexpected event that will propel the hero into conflict!
Mr. Timms?
That's right! You!
Don't be shy. Come on.
It's okay.
That's it, a little closer.
Good.
I won't bite you.
I need a little help here.
Are you okay?
I must get to the other side.
The other side? You mean, just now, that was you crossing the road?
That's why the...
Why'd you do that?
This is my quest. He waits for me.
What? Who?
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.
They say he rides an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
What are you talking about?
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.
Nothing? Your delusional quest just ruined my life!
I had an incredibly complex social network going!
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!
Friends? I don't see no friends.
You are a very lonely lizard.
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.
Not unlike what you've got going there.
Listen, I can't survive in the desert, okay?
I... I don't belong here.
That may be true, but here you are.
Now help me up and I will help you find what you seek.
- You will?
- And perhaps more.
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.
The Spirit is waiting for me.
Okay, okay.
Okay. That's not going to work.
I must get to the other side.
Why don't you just wait until there are no cars coming?
It's not so easy as it looks.
What?
Is a metaphor.
There's another one!
I knew it.
You need a little help, amigo?
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.
The path to knowledge is fraught with consequence.
I'm just looking for the path to water.
If you want to find water, you must first find Dirt.
Dirt.
Destiny, she is kind to you.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.
At noon, the townspeople gather for a mysterious ritual.
A town? You mean, with real people and everything? Where?
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.
You want me to just walk out into the desert?
That's the way.
Okay. So you're saying there's a town, a real town, not a metaphor town.
Go on. It's okay.
Okay.
Well, then, I'm going.
I am leaving the road now!
I'm walking into the desert!
Alone!
We all have our journeys to make!
I will see you on the other side.
Welcome, amigo
To the land without end
The desert and death
Are the closest of friends
We sing of his courage
In magnificent song
But pay close attention
He won't be here long
As the birds pluck his eyes
The sun bleaches his bones
See his entrails get scattered
Watch him lose his cojones
Here in the Mojave Desert, animals have had millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment.
But the lizard? He is going to die.
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers..."
- Don't move.
- What?
- Don't move!
- Not moving.
Not moving.
Try to blend in.
Blend in? What do you mean?
Blend in.
What are you saying?
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!
I'm blending! I'm a blender!
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?
Stop moving!
Try not to look conspicuous.
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.
Oh, hey. Proboscis.
Testy.
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!
Please, no.
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your huevos!
Big bird! Big bird!
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!
I'll let you kiss my sister!
You son of a...
Where are your friends now, amigo?
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges off my boots!
Sorry.
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow lessen you want to spend the better part of the afternoon putting your face back together!
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.
Now someone's dumping water in the desert!
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size and dimension, but I intend to find out what role you playing in all this.
- Role?
- What are you involved in?
Well, I'm glad you asked.
I've got two one-acts, a mystery and a musical I've been gestating.
I got the words, I'm just working on the melody right now. It's like a...
I think it's gonna be a western.
A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper
She'll be coming 'round the mountain in the rain
You ain't from around here, are you?
I'm still working on it.
So, what's your name?
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.
Well, you're lucky he didn't plumb love asparagus.
What are you saying?
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself, but I'm not sure that a child would appreciate the moniker.
My daddy was a great man, even if he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!
You carry his remains?
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month!
And for you to insinuate that he would abandon his parental responsibilities at a delicate time in my personal development is an affront to my sense...
Miss Beans?
Miss Beans? Hello?
Hello?
And until the people of Andromeda Five return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.
- You were frozen.
- I was not.
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.
It's a defense mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.
You're making that up.
So, you gonna die out here, or you want a ride into town?
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.
So who are you, really?
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.
There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.
I had a pseudonym once, but I had it legally changed.
And so the stranger, seeking companionship, finds the woman, much like the sirens of ancient times luring him to his certain demise.
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.
I'm actually one of the few men with a maiden name.
Whoa! Well, here we are.
Right.
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!
Okay, then!
See you, Beans.
You heading out, Jim?
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.
Can't grow no crops without no water.
Bye, now!
What is it?
What was that for?
You're funny looking.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.
Here's your beans, Beans.
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts already. I can't give you more credit.
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrimack down at the bank. He cut off all credit.
Hey, Beans! Beans!
You know that there fella?
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!
Nope.
Hey, Beans!
Hey.
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.
I'd like a glass of water.
He wants a glass of water!
Make it a double!
Give him the spittoon!
Cactus juice. That's what we got.
Hey, there, fruit cup.
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?
Who exactly are you?
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?
As a matter of fact, I am.
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!
Exactly where did you say you were from?
Me? I'm from the West.
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.
The Far West.
Yeah, that's right, hombres.
The place I come from, we kill a man before breakfast just to work up an appetite.
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!
Hell, I seen things make a grown man lose control of his glandular functions!
You spend three days in a horse carcass, living off your own juices.
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.
Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents. Just the way I like it.
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.
You might say I'm from everywhere there's trouble brewing and hell waiting to be raised.
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.
Name's
Rango.
Are you the fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?
Killed them with one bullet.
Don't get no deader.
All seven of them?
That's right.
All seven of them.
Exactly how you do that, Mr. Rango?
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!
Because this is where it gets complicated.
That'll close out your account,
Mrs. Oats, two gulps and a swig.
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left of your college education!
I don't rightly have no other choice, Beans.
Times being so hard, we just can't give no more credit.
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.
Beans, you've been like a niece to me ever since your daddy did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.
I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.
But that... Well...
- Mr. Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.
Mr. Merrimack!
Are you all right?
Beans, I need to show you something.
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just ain't making deposits on a Wednesday no more!
Mr. Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch and you're telling me that's all that's left in the whole town?
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.
Someone is dumping water in the desert.
I seen it with my own eyes.
Water in the desert?
Was this during one of your special times?
No.
Well, we can all dream, but this is the reality.
Why do you think so many people are selling out? They just can't make it.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.
I hear he's been helping people out in this time of crisis.
The Mayor?
He may be our only hope.
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back towards number three, and that's when the roof caved in, igniting the thermos of pure grain alcohol instantly vaporizing his bodily form, leaving nothing but a charcoal statue and a high-pitched squeal.
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?
Number seven?
Hell, he died of infection.
- Seven men!
- One bullet!
Drinks all around!
Dance for me, Sod Buster!
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!
You got corn in your ears, mate?
You don't pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!
If I see your face in this town again,
I'm gonna slice it off and use it to wipe my unmentionables.
Mind the beak.
And don't come back!
What are you all gawping at?
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something I got to tell you!
What is this?
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!
Is that right?
Let me get that before you...
No. Oh, I know. Here.
Just take care of that for you.
There. All better.
T.O. T.O. Just a second.
All right, now listen!
I'm going to give you fellas one last chance to reconsider!
And if you don't want to reconsider
I might consider reconsidering myself.
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.
All right, now listen up!
Things are going to be different around here now that Rango's in town.
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning, my coffee hot, Danish on the side.
Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye.
Stay out of my peripheral vision!
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!
And when you see me coming, stand aside.
I take large steps and I don't want none of you hayseeds getting your bodily fluids on my boots!
Of course, there is no need for violence, as long as we stick together, work as a team.
So I want you all to come outside now and line up single file while I take a brief intermission!
What's he doing now?
I think it's a number two.
Never mind.
Take a look-see over here!
Well, look at him now!
He's chasing after that hawk!
Give him hell, Rango!
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!
What do you think, Doc?
This hawk is dead!
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.
He did it with one bullet!
Just like he said!
It's about time we had a hero around here.
One who ain't in a pine box.
I think it's time he met the Mayor.
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!
Let's hear it for Rango!
And so the stranger basks in the adulation of his new friends, sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.
When is he going to die?
Soon, compadre. Soon.
My land is not for sale!
I came here to save my land, not sell it!
I'm sure there's something reasonable we can work out if you just talk to him!
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?
The Mayor will see you now.
Water, Mr. Rango, water.
Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.
But with water there's life.
Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.
That's the immutable law of the desert.
Control the water and you control everything.
But I don't have to tell you that being a true man of the West, as you are.
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.
I guess power has its privileges.
You make a good point, son.
But with privilege comes responsibility.
Hell, I was mayor here before there was a Dirt!
And I may be just a sentimental old turtle but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbors?
It's a hard life here. Very hard.
Do you know how they make it through each and every day?
They believe.
They believe it's going to be better.
They believe that the water will come.
They believe against all odds and all evidence that tomorrow will be better than today.
People have to believe in something.
Right now, they believe in you.
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.
Your destiny awaits.
People have to believe in something.
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?
Yeah. But he might be a problem.
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.
It just don't make no sense.
This whole town is drying up, and the Mayor is the only one who don't seem to be affected.
Doesn't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.
But if you really feel there's some conspiracy occurring,
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff.
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!
That's good.
Oh, easy there, tiger.
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.
Have you got French cuffs with that?
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, Beans, what do you think of the new duds?
I got a 1 0-gallon hat marked down from 15.
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.
- Tart.
- Floozy.
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr. Rango.
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
I was just thinking that...
You want the old John Hancock, do you?
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.
There's a bullet in there.
I know about the shindig this afternoon.
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...
- Mr. Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up real nice, you put a little effort into it.
- What?
- Now, remember, son, stay in school, eat your veggies, burn everything but Shakespeare.
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango, if that is your real name.
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch, which is on the verge of an agricultural meltdown while you're playing patty-cake with this here trollop!
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.
Why does she do that?
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.
Well, that's an inconvenience.
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!
I did it again, didn't I?
Did what?
Let me ask you something.
Did anybody here mention what happened to our last sheriff?
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?
What exactly happened to the...
All day
I've faced the barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
With throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water
Cool
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Clear water
This is a heck of a hoedown you got going.
Still working out those steps.
So, is this considered normal civic behavior?
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.
You kill bird.
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.
Bird dead. Snake come.
Snake?
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.
He never comes to town 'cause he's scared of that hawk.
But he might come now.
Can I have your boots when you're dead?
No!
And I ain't got no problem with this Rattlesnake Jake.
That's just what Amos said.
Amos?
You got any gold fillings?
My fellow Dirtonians.
I welcome you to our great day of deliverance. Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!
We have a newcomer amongst us today, my friends.
A man I think needs little introduction to you so bold has been his entry into our fair society.
Mr. Rango, would you step forward?
The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretold!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
It is the time of hydration!
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!
I get his boots!
My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices will have to be made.
But if I can help in any way, please know that my door is always...
Hold it, hold it!
Now, this whole thing stinks three ways to Sunday.
First the bank's run dry and now this here spigot?
The bank's run dry?
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!
That was my rehydration account!
None of that civil disobedience in my town, thank you very much.
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.
Come right in.
Let me have a gander at the source of the societal discontentment here.
Mercy.
All right, listen up! I've been thinking and I believe I've figured something out.
You folks have a water problem!
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.
Let's say this fella here were to take a drink of water.
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?
And you!
You're just as dried up and parched as a jackrabbit in July.
So you belly on up and take you a double shot!
Stay with me.
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!
And before you know it, there wouldn't be any more water.
And then where would we be?
We'd be thirsty.
Real thirsty.
We'd turn on each other like a bunch of animals!
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.
We have got five days...
As long as we've got water, we've got ourselves a town.
Sheriff Rango is right.
As long as we have this water, we have some hope.
And you can all take it from me.
My 100% full-time employment from this moment on will be to protect our precious natural resource.
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango.
Evening, ladies.
Evening, Sheriff.
And don't you come back!
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back in there and you assert yourself, and I think you'll find the people of this here town to be surprisingly hospitable.
Thank you, Sheriff.
What? Not you again!
I stand corrected.
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!
Hold it right there!
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!
Get them hands up where I can see them!
Just as I suspected.
Prospecting without the authorized equipment. Don't move a muscle.
Prospecting?
Now, you got your shovel, pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah, assorted snacks, some puzzle books and you're gonna need a permit.
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?
I've had polyps removed smarter than the two of you!
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here, helping us out.
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds, keeping an eagle eye out for mayhem and malfeasance.
Does he look like he sounds?
Well, Sheriff, if we was to hit the mother lode, being prospectors and such, where would we deposit said annuity?
Here in the town of Dirt, we happen to have the finest financial institution this side of the Missouri.
Protected morning, noon and night by yours truly.
Much obliged.
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!
What's going on?
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?
He said the bank's been robbed!
Dr. Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!
The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'll die of thirst," the people cry
He promised to protect the vault
The water's gone, it's all his fault
All right, folks, stand back, clear the area.
This is a crime scene now.
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints, check for fibers, scan for DNA.
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.
And don't mix up the two.
What's this?
"Prospecting Permit."
I'll take that. Material evidence.
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!
My friends, we all know what we have to do now.
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.
Form a possum!
A posse.
Now, we're gonna be doing this in an orderly fashion.
First off, does anybody here know how to use a firearm of any kind?
All right, then.
What do we do now, Sheriff?
Now we ride!
Where are we going?
What?
Where are we going?
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge of all tracking and finding of villains, utilizing your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offense taken.
So which way do you think they went?
You want to sniff the air or commune with a buffalo or something?
Oh, you're good.
I'm depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobaccy in the beard there.
Always good to have a medical man along, Doc.
Reptiles got to stick together, right, my brother?
I'm an amphibian.
Ain't no shame in that.
You sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?
Well, you got a little something in your eye there.
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.
Well, I'm glad to hear it's not contagious.
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...
Never mind.
Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.
Can I gut-shoot someone?
Let's put a pin in that.
Sheriff, you're going to bring that water back, aren't you?
Count on it, little sister.
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.
Whole town's perforated with them.
She got more holes in her than a painted lady on a porcupine.
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.
Not what I expected.
How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?
Gentlemen, if we can just stay on task here.
Sheriff! Over here!
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.
Amen, brother.
I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.
Those were the halcyon days.
Must be a reason she quit on us.
Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water.
What do you say, Sheriff?
Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.
I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
Sure is humid down here.
Yeah, it's activating my piles.
I had a goitre removed once.
Looked like Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.
Shoot, I put that on a tortilla.
Whatever you do, do not look down.
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.
What's an aquifer?
Well, it's for aqua.
Well, it's empty now.
That's a big one.
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.
Well, now that there is a pipe.
It's got to be connected to something.
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.
You two just don't get it, do you?
Someone or something is messing with our hydration and that pipe has got something to do with it.
I thought we was following bank robbers!
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.
I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!
Go ahead and try!
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.
Sure enough.
Smart thinking there, feller.
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!
Not bad, huh, Beans?
You keep thinking like that, your hat's gonna catch on fire.
Well, you know, you get on a roll, you just...
Hot, hot! Burn.
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!
Give me that!
It's empty anyway.
I knew that.
Where'd you find that?
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!
It's Mr. Merrimack from the bank.
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.
Looks like them varmints shot him in the back.
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?
What a way to go.
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.
I suppose we should bury him.
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.
Circle of life!
Sheriff.
Will you say a few words?
Yeah. Yeah.
Dearly beloved.
We are gathered here today to honor this man.
Mr. Merrimack, you have the right to remain silent.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?
I see you're consulting with the spirits.
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.
I'll keep that in mind.
Cactus fruit.
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.
I believe your people use it as seasoning when preparing your native dishes.
Also natural laxative.
Pick up trail.
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?
Someone's got a bad valve.
All right, which one of you fellers needs a check-up?
Awkward.
What exactly are we going to do now?
Now we ride!
That means we're riding now!
This moment.
Marshmallows remind me of going camping with my daddy.
I could eat them all night long.
Of course he did make me cough them back up again for breakfast.
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.
They started looking at me weird.
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.
I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.
You might want to get that looked at.
Pass the beans, Beans.
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.
Mr. Rango? Can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?
Yes, the Spirit of the West!
The eternally unattainable ideal.
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
But he only appears to those who have undertaken an epic quest!
And have made it to the other side.
The other side of what?
It's a metaphor.
My eye!
That's gonna heal right up.
Sheriff? What are you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?
What? Where?
Sorry about that. Word is you come against him once or twice.
Yeah.
Jake. You mean my brother.
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.
Well, Momma had an active social life.
Did he ever bite you?
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.
Put some in my coffee just to give it a little tang.
Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?
Them's what we call his natural predator.
All this talk of that serpentine devil is putting my quills on edge!
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water and return to a hero's welcome.
Friends, before we bunk down
I'd like us all to join hands for a moment, say a few words to the Spirit of the West.
That's a good idea.
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.
But tonight I want to thank you for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.
It's a hard life we got.
Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it.
But somehow, Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.
We needed a brave man and you sent us one.
Nice to have someone to believe in again.
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Just checking.
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.
You ever feel like those things are looking at you?
That's a Spanish dagger.
But around here, we just call them the Walking Cactus.
Walking?
There's an old legend they actually walk across the desert to find water.
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late watching them, to see if they'd move.
I thought if I could follow them, they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.
Someplace with enough water for everyone.
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.
But you're still watching.
Who doesn't want to find someplace wonderful?
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.
That's such a lonely sound.
You ever get lonely?
Sometimes.
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?
No, we're pretty isolated out there on the ranch, sort of like being sealed up in a little box.
Don't really see a lot of folks.
I wouldn't know what that's like.
There someone special in your life, Rango?
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.
Besides, my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.
You know, it's an awful solitary existence out there on the prairie.
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.
Beans?
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna whup you like a red-headed stepchild!
Choleric varmints, ain't they?
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.
What's that coming?
It's the water.
I have a plan, and each and every one of you has a part to play.
What do I do?
Spoons, you got the most important job of all.
You stay up here on the ridge, and if anything goes wrong, you give the signal.
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.
Well, actually...
Why can't you be all brainy like your brother?
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon to thee and thee and thee.
May I present Madame Lupone's
Terpsichorean Troupe of Traveling Thespians!
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!
The stage is set. The princess prepares to take her own life.
I yearn for love.
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands watch at the castle gate.
Stands watch at the castle gate...
Hark! Who goes there?
This plot is highly predictable.
Quiet! This is my favorite part.
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father, strucketh by Cupid.
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter and reach for the...
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"
What was that?
Must be that immersive theater.
We got you surrounded!
You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see them.
My entire family?
Grits and spit and collard greens
Waffle chitlins, monkey brains
Refried bones and booger blood
Pickled eggs and flaps of mud
It's a full house.
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good old-fashioned standoff.
I'll have you know, you're not looking at our entire contingent.
What's that supposed to be?
That's the signal.
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!
So something's supposed to happen?
I am open to suggestions.
Run!
Get on the wagon!
Should we have ourselves some sport, chill'ens?
I likes it when they run.
Maybelle, give the holler!
Looks like we made it!
That audience was quite responsive.
Yeah, well, I think that chromosome pool is about dried up.
We got bats!
Here! You drive.
Looks like there's gonna be soup tonight!
Come on, let's get some!
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!
Jedidiah! It's time for the Alabama squeeze box!
Okay, Pa!
I am sensing hostility.
Incoming!
Hello!
Goodbye!
Lasso that swine!
I suggest we take evasive action!
I suggest you shut up and shoot!
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!
What was that? Go check it out!
What is it? Is there a problem?
You could call it that.
Headache.
Is that all you got?
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!
Eat lead!
Here, hold these.
Get your hands off me!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jump!
It's impossible.
It can't be. It's empty.
There's no water!
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated the very sustenance of our livelihood!
I think that there fella in the purty dress is the Sheriff.
That's the same fellow what give us a prospecting permit?
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.
You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery and the murder of our beloved financial advisor
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.
We done tunneled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.
Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.
Then where'd you get this here jug?
That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.
I found it in the desert.
Then why in tarnation did you bring it here?
Hold on! You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?
That's right.
I don't believe a word of it.
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!
Who'd dump water in the desert?
Wouldn't be the first time.
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!
What's going on, Sheriff?
I don't know.
But I'm going to strip away this mystery and expose its private parts.
You and your kin are coming with me.
They're coming!
Here they come!
Looks like they got them robbers.
Where's the water?
There weren't no water.
Where is he going?
He's going to see the Mayor.
He's got to be pleased with that.
That's a good one, boss!
That's interesting.
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr. Rango, but there's a certain protocol to this game, you understand.
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.
Well, that's good, 'cause you got a few questions to answer and I've got my own protocol.
But why would anyone dump water in the blooming desert?
It does seem a bit naive, taking the word of admitted bank robbers.
Besides, once they hang, your job is done.
- Bravo!
- Job well done.
But what if somebody did rob the bank before they got there?
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
I was hoping you could tell me.
That sounds marginally near to an accusation.
Take it any way you like.
Something you said keeps rattling around in my frontal lobe.
What's that?
"Control the water and you control everything."
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
You've obviously mastered this game.
Well, I've been playing it for many years, sir.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress, and I learned a thing or two.
Perhaps it's time you started to take the long view, begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.
Look out there, son.
You can almost see time passing.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango, the future.
One day soon, all this is going to fade into myth, the frontier town, the lawman, the gunslinger.
There's just no place for them any more.
- We're civilized now.
- That's right, civilized.
That's what the future holds.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
Is that what happened to
Mr. Merrimack? Did he get left behind?
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.
Our new sheriff has been playing the hero for so long, he's actually starting to believe it.
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.
He never leaves without taking a blooming soul.
Do it!
Now be still. You gotta look presentable to meet your maker.
Death has arrived
How will the hero survive?
The Mayor has bought up all the land in the valley, except for your ranch, Miss Beans.
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
Unless he controls the water.
Like a monkey's bladder!
Then he could bring it back once he's bought up all the land.
But how does he control the water?
Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.
'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.
Sheriff, we got a problem.
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.
Get them out here so we can cut off their giblets!
You, too, Spoons?
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.
But this is all his fault!
You said you's gonna bring the water back.
It's just, we got no hope without that water.
We got nothing left to believe in.
You see that sign up there?
As long as that sign says "Sheriff," you can believe that there's law and order in this town.
But without law and order, ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.
Starts out slow, like a fungus.
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.
Neighbor turns on neighbor.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!
And then dogs and cats are getting together to create all sorts of unnatural mutant aberrations!
So, you want something to believe in, Spoons?
Believe in me.
Believe in that there sign.
For as long as it hangs there, we got hope.
Hello, brother.
Thirsty?
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?
Well, you know...
I hear you been telling about how you killed all them Jenkins brothers.
With one bullet, wasn't it?
Isn't that right?
All these good folks here believe your little stories, don't they?
Why, they believe you're just a stone killer, don't they?
Seems these folks trust you.
They think you're gonna save their little town.
They think you're gonna save their little souls!
But we know better, don't we?
So why don't you show your friends here what you're made of?
Show them who you really are.
Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?
But, of course, you won't need all these.
Just one, right?
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.
You got killer in your eyes, son?
I don't see it.
You didn't do any of them things you said, did you?
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!
Are you?
- Say it!
- No.
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.
No.
All you've done is lie to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a fake and a coward. Isn't that right?
Yes.
- Louder!
- Yes.
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.
This is my town now.
If I ever see you again, I will take your soul straight down to hell!
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm nobody.
Golden guardians.
The alabaster carriage.
The Spirit of the West.
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to dig deep to find what you're looking for.
So you made it.
Is this heaven?
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.
Yeah.
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?
Searching, same as you.
I don't even know what I'm looking for any more.
I don't even know who I am.
They used to call you the Man with No Name.
These days they got a name for just about everything.
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.
Yeah, but my deeds just made things worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phony!
My friends believed in me, but they need some kind of hero.
Then be a hero.
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.
That's right. You came a long way to find something that isn't out here.
Don't you see? It's not about you.
It's about them.
But I can't go back.
Don't know that you got a choice, son.
No man can walk out on his own story.
So you made it.
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.
Did you just see that?
We each see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It is.
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.
Many years ago, this entire valley was covered in agua.
Now only one question remains.
Where did it go?
They follow the water.
They follow the water! Come on!
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress and I learned a thing or two.
Control the water and you control everything.
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
What now, amigo?
No man can walk out on his own story.
I'm going back.
But why?
Because that's who I am.
You got a lot of nerve showing up here, lawman. What is it you want?
Your pappy and them boys are about to hang for something they didn't do.
But I've got a plan.
I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.
But you're making a practical decision.
Decisions, decisions.
There's no need for any more suffering.
Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.
Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.
My daddy was not a burden!
Keep your blood money and I'll keep my land!
Do what he says or, by all the fires of the black pit,
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes out of your skull!
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...
Let me do my job! You brought me in.
Now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!
Sign the damn paper, woman!
Go to hell!
Where do you think I come from?
Look into my eyes.
I want to see you die.
Jake!
I'm calling you out!
Jake!
This day just got a little more interesting.
Put her down.
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?
That's just about the size of it.
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!
All right, Sheriff, make your move.
Now amigos!
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!
That was a bad idea.
Thirsty, brother?
Here it comes!
No. No!
It's a miracle!
Look out!
- Lookee there!
- What is that?
It's our salvation, Pa!
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, your guts'll be leaking lead!
Well, then it's a good thing I brought some backup.
What?
Ain't no hawk.
Ain't nothing but bats!
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!
It only takes one bullet.
You ain't got the nerve.
Try me.
Oh, Mr. Rango.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.
Now, Mr. Rango.
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.
Help!
Open the door!
Okay, plan B.
Beans, you're mumbling.
All my problems taken care of except for one.
It's a new West, Jake.
There's no room for gunslingers any more. We're businessmen now.
Yeah, we got new hats.
Where I come from, we call this improvisation.
You came back.
What was that?
No need to panic, but I think you just swallowed plan B.
What?
Okay, panic time.
You and the Sheriff are more alike than you think.
You're nothing but legends.
Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed.
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.
How fitting.
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together, we can reach a mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.
You better take it up with him.
One bullet.
I tip my hat to you, one legend to another.
What was that you said?
"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed."
No, Jake! No!
Rango!
You brought the water back, just like you promised.
You really are a hero.
Well, the thing about heroes is, whenever you...
Don't spoil it.
Right.
Well, I don't know about you all, but I could sure go for a dip.
And so the lizard completes his journey from humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.
And although he is certain to die, perhaps from a household accident, which account for 65% of all unnatural deaths, the people of the village will honor his memory even as they abandon their dignity.
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?
Water ain't money. Money is money.
- Well, I ain't got no...
- We're talking hard cash.
We have a problem.
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?
I really think you complete me.
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can you keep missing your mark?
What's my motivation?
Oh, you kids.
What did you do that for?
I was just checking.
I hear if you get too sunburnt, you can peel a man's face right off.
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.
Don't touch it.
That's the second time that's happened to me.
This water thing's great.
I'm urinating right now.
Adult swim, next five minutes.
Stay between the buoys.
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.
Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...
- Beans!
- ...and your moisturizing lotion...
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.
Sheriff, where are you headed?
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.
Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.
And don't go trying to be a hero.
Beans, you are missing the point.
I got an image to protect now.
Where's my Tic Tacs?
- I found them.
- What's going on?
Well, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective, the hero must abandon the self and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.
So, this is the sunset shot.
Give them a good one, amigo.
Ready, Excelsior?
My fellow comrades.
There will be times when you doubt yourself.
When you feel pummeled by the cataclysms of life, remember this moment.
Remember me.
Know that I will be there watching you, sometimes at inappropriate moments.
That's part of the deal.
And remember, within all of us resides the true Spirit of the...
Let's take it from the top.
