CENTRAL PARTNERSHIP
Brest Fortress was built in the middle of the 19th century at the western border of Russian Empire.
Powerful fortifications, fort systems made this citadel impregnable.
New arms minimized the defensive qualities of the fortress... but not of the people who protected it.
About 20 years after WWII
Sergey Smirnov wrote a book that revealed the truth about defenders of the fortress.
On May 8, 1965 Brest Fortress was awarded the honorary title "Hero Fortress".
In memory of the fortress heroes, in memory of defenders of the motherland.

THE BREST FORTRESS
21 June 1941. Brest. City park.
We can have some ice cream.
Tell me about the movie.
Let's have some ice cream!
I remember everything.
At the city park, as always on Saturdays, there was dancing.
This is me.
Alexander Akimov.
A foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment.
My parents were killed in Spain in 1937.
My brother was my only family left.
And this is Anya.
Just Anya.
But for me she was more than
"just" Anya.
Hold on a minute.
I'll be right back.
Sasha, why are you not with the unit?
Moska asked me to help.
All their musicians left.
Last trumpet player left on Wednesday.
- Foster student of musical platoon Akimov!
- Yes, sir.
I order you to return to the Fortress immediately!
What are you yelling for? You are neither my father, nor the commander!
Why are you yelling in public?
Tell Starshina Kovalenko to punish you.
I'll be back to check on it.
And don't play so out of tune.
About turn!
Forward march!
And he calls himself my brother.
Family of military officer, please get together!
- Anya, come here.
- I am here.
Freeze!
It's easier to manage the regiment than you lot.
This is my home.
My fortress.
It's quite big.
Hard to explore all of it.
But I knew some places here that if I wanted to hide... no one would find me.
Thank you.
Brest city. Railway station.
There are no tickets today!
I'm telling you all, there are no tickets today!
There are no tickets.
No army reservation. Nothing.
I have only three days to go there and come back.
Ask those who told you that to give you tickets.
We don't have any.
There's nothing I can do.
Listen, my wife and my little child are in Daugavpils.
I must bring them to my place of duty.
July 20th. That's all I can do.
Remove the reservation.
Comrade commissar, I'm telling you as I would to my own relative.
I am forbidden to touch the reservation.
That's only for certain orders.
That means no?
Maybe it's for the better. Why bring them here when everyone is leaving?
What exactly do you mean?
So hot. Like in a desert.
What a day!
Hello, comrade commissar.
Hi, Nikolai.
- Bringing a movie?
- Yes, I am.
Come on, come on, come on!
Tugushev.
Kolya is fast, but Tugushev is faster.
Dear, I could not come yet. All is quiet at the fortress. There will be no war.
I am just unlucky.
Let's play again.
You didn't leave, comrade commissar?
How can I leave you?
Brought a movie?
Yes, I did.
- ... and some beer.
- Maybe we can do without beer?
Tomorrow is Sunday.
People rest on Sundays.
So I'll have some rest too.
Three beers.
And mineral water for the children.
He remembered the children!
We didn't forget anything, did we?
Let's go.
Did you bring it?
Yes, I did.
Probably about love again?
About love.
I got in trouble, comrade Starshina.
I suppose to punish you?
Where did he see you?
I played out of tune.
And my brother has a good ear.
- What did you play?
- "On the hill."
Learn it by the morning.
You will play it tomorrow.
Stop music!
Hrush, what are you doing?
Comrade lieutenant, this is some kind of "Swan Lake."
So when do you think the war with Germany will start?
I've been assigned to investigate the spread of panic rumors about war with our ally.
I believe and see that you are a communist, an honest man.
How could it happen then,
Pyotr Mihailovich, that you are being called a panic-monger?
Ask those who call me that.
Help me, Pyotr Mihailovich.
My rank is not very high.
But tasks before me are huge. l clearly see that you are not at fault here.
Who is spreading the panic?
I asked you to come here, so we could talk candidly.
- Who is it, comrade major?
- Me.
I blurted it out a couple of times without thinking that the Germans are going to attack soon.
Haven't heard anything like this from anyone else.
There is no panic.
Sleep soundly.
Look, lieutenant, if they attack, we'll all be trapped here like in a boiler.
8 thousand soldiers in the Fortress.
This mass of people will not have time to exit through the Northern Gates.
Everyone with their children, women, old ladies.
With all their stuff.
Most of the soldiers should be moved outside fortress walls, where main army units are positioned.
This is what l, a commander who has been through two wars, have been saying!
And will continue saying!
And what about the fourth army?
They will not abandon us here? Right?
They will not, if everyone is where they are supposed to be!
Here soldiers are in one place, commanders are in another.
Where soldiers are without a commander panic breaks out.
That's common knowledge, comrade lieutenant.
I understood you.
And I find our conversation to have been very useful.
But please keep it secret.
The hearing for your case is scheduled for the 27th.
Allow me to go, comrade lieutenant.
- A movie is starting at the clubhouse.
- Yes, sure.
- Hurry up.
- We'll be on time.
Sonya.
Will you stay?
Look how some people live.
Thank you, comrade major.
[German speech. ]
Petya.
Your tea is cold.
Go to bed, Katya.
This is how German subversives appeared in Brest dressed in our uniforms.
Loss of power and water in the
Fortress was the work of their hands.
What's wrong?
Today another defector from the Poles came to our outpost.
He said war is going to start today at 4am.
- You believe it?
- Of course not.
Only this week alone we caught ten of them, and each one keeps saying that today or tomorrow the war is going to start.
Actually, I'm upset because of Anya.
Our girl has grown up.
Before she used to tell me everything.
But now, whatever I ask, she just shrugs her shoulders and that's the end of it.
Maybe she is sick?
This sickness is called Sasha Akimov.
Our Anya fell in love.
That's how it is, daddy.
Remember you said we'd go fishing?
No, your parents won't let you go.
I'll leave quietly, when everyone is asleep.
Alright, Anya, you play for a bit, and I'll go have a smoke.
Let's get married!
Did you ask, if I want to?
You don't believe me?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
- Last name?
- Kolya.
I brought the movie.
22 June 1941
Trainings?
Can't we get some sleep.
I'll go see what's going on.
Get down!
What is this?
Trainings.
Run!
- Where?
- Home. I'll find you.
And you?
- Where's Anya?
- Don't worry, we'll find her.
Where's Anya?
Petya, is this war?
- Katya! Come on!
- Did you take everything?
Hold tight.
Run!
Katya, do everything like I taught you.
Go hide in the basement.
- Petya!
- Stay calm.
Come on, sonny.
- Your hat.
- When it quiets down, I'll come find you.
She will find us, won't she?
Stay here.
- And you?
- Don't go outside without me.
I'm leaving. Bye.
Run. Run!
Andrey!
Mom!
Hold her.
Don't fall for provocations!
Go! Go! Go!
I had imagined war.
But I could not have imagined war.
Not this war.
Everyone was expecting it.
But nobody expected it to come so suddenly.
Simple and scary.
I was running to that house.
That was the meeting place.
In case of war.
That was written in the instructions manual.
But that manual was probably left there.
In the house that was destroyed.
- You can't go there!
- Let me in!
No arms without commander's orders!
I was not allowed to carry arms.
But I had my own weapon.
For which I did not need permission.
Seems to have quieted down.
Mommy...
Sonny...
Crawl to the basement.
Run, sonny...
You can't come in here!
Fortress. Volynsk Fortification.
The hospital.
You can't!
Surgery is in progress!
Fortress. Kobrinsk Fortification.
Northern Gates.
Stop panicking!
Stop panicking!
Fortress. Kobrinsk Fortification.
Eastern Fort.
Go back!
Back to the barracks!
Stop panicking!
Back to the barracks!
Lad!
- Play!
- What?
Play anything!
Stop!
Stop!
Lad, are you nuts?
Run for your life!
- Where's your weapon?
- Get lost!
Commanders, come here!
We are lieutenants.
Lieutenants? I don't see it.
Get yourselves in order.
And report properly, otherwise l will shoot you as panic-mongers!
Yes, sir.
Everyone return to the barracks. Take weapons and take up defense positions.
At the double!
Fortress. Homsky Gates.
Where are the Russians?
Only Germans are on air.
Maybe this is trainings?
What kind of trainings is that?
As you were!
Sorry, comrade regiment commissar.
Stop panicking!
Is the commander here?
I see.
I am taking command.
Starshina, get the regiment together, give out arms.
Disperse at the windows.
Don't let the Germans cross the bridge.
Don't waste ammo.
Continue trying to contact the city.
I am Fortress...
Fortress. The 9th frontier post.
Listen to my orders, to arms!
Not enough arms!
They are buried under the rubble.
- Chief pilot officer?
- Dead.
Everyone, who has weapons, come to me.
The rest - try to get whatever you can from underneath the rubble.
Germans!
Frontier post...
... to battle!
Follow me!
Need a man on first floor.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
We're holding down defense.
Battle in progress.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Fortress. Barracks of the 132nd NKVD battalion.
What unit is this? Who is in charge?
I want to see the commander!
NKVD lieutenant Vanshtein!
As your superior officer
I order you to leave the barracks and, after breaking up into smaller groups, make your way out of the Fortress...
If we leave our positions, the Germans will break into the fortress, and here we can keep holding them off, till reinforcements arrive.
Execute the order, lieutenant!
Two divisions are on their way here.
Further sacrifice of people's lives is senseless.
- And you, sergeant?
- Senior sergeant Novikov.
Do you know what happens for disobeying an order?
Comrade major, I'm sorry. I don't know you.
Can I see your documents?
Of course.
You are right. I commend you for your vigilance.
And your boots please.
- What about boots?
- Show me your boots.
Our boots have nails that are round, the German have square ones.
Look.
Square!
Stop!
The badge is German.
But the nails were round.
Sonya!
Kolya!
- Kolya, I'm here.
- Sonya, I'll be right there!
Germans are retreating south.
Sonya!
Kolya!
Quiet!
I can't take this anymore!
I'm so scared!
The Germans are there!
- Please!
- Quiet! It's me.
Don't cry. I know that you are strong.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Comrade commissar, look!
Our people from the hospital!
Look. l see a nurse there, who treated me earlier.
What's gonna happen, comrade commissar?
Starshina, you are coming with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Leave your weapon.
Everyone else disperse at the windows.
Take aim at chest level.
Follow me.
What a choice of cover.
Down!
Everyone go to the basements!
We need to go to Brest.
Find out what's the situation there.
Is the task clear?
Yes, sir.
Execute.
Look how many people they killed!
Ammunition.
Get in.
Do you have ammunition?
What ammunition? Get in!
Let's go. To the Northern Gates.
Kobrinsk Fortification.
Officers housing.
I was looking for my brother.
We lived here.
Our family.
And the Pochernikov family.
- Uncle Vanya!
- Crawl to the window.
Have you seen my brother?
Help me.
Shura don't.
Come here.
Sasha, get out of here.
No.
That's an order.
What are we going to do?
I'm not letting them take me captive.
I'm with you.
I understand everything.
Without you and the children I do not want to live and I'm not going to.
Forgive me.
You forgive me.
Go look what they are up to.
Go back. We won't get through here.
We couldn't get through.
We're waiting for reinforcements.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Comrade major!
- Tanks are coming!
- Easy, lieutenant.
If only we had an anti-tank weapon!
I told them so.
Third one.
I wish we had an anti-tank gun.
To battle!
Get the grenades ready.
Gather arms.
Take positions.
Don't fire without an order.
Our iron is burning hot. You will be mine. You're not going anywhere.
Who fired?
Fire.
Our folks.
Aim.
Fire.
Koptun, grab the grenades.
Load.
Attack!
Charge!
What's your name, son?
Lieutenant Akimov.
This is how my brother died.
On the first day.
On that first endless day.
The very first order to retreat during the course of the war... was given by the German commander ship on the 22nd of June 1941 at 11:00am... here at the Brest Fortress.
We have 18 people left who are capable of holding a gun.
There is no medicine, water, or food.
What do you think, where are our people?
Why are they not coming?
Or maybe they'll come soon?
What should I tell our soldiers?
By morning they'll be here.
They'll be here for sure.
Has everyone been buried?
Yes, sir.
What's the situation with water?
There's an ice box in the basement.
Should be enough for a day.
Then what?
By morning our reinforcements will come and will send them all...
It's dangerous to stay here.
The building is badly damaged.
You will all come with me.
You'll stay in the basements of our barracks till our reinforcements arrive.
Where is Anya?
I thought she was with you.
We must go.
I did not know what was going on.
I did not know what to do, where to go.
One thing I knew for certain.
I must wait till morning.
Because in the morning our soldiers will come.
And everything will be over.
23 June
Soldiers, commanders, you are facing a choice. Decide.
Either you go under fire and die... or find within you the courage to surrender and live.
Your situation is hopeless.
Your struggle is useless.
We have come here to free your country from the Jews and the Bolsheviks.
We will build a new life.
One without hard labor camps and collective farms.
Surrender and you will live with us.
Shall I shoot them?
As you were.
To each his own.
Give me your hand!
Comrade lieutenant, allow me to report.
Foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment Alexander Akimov.
Take him to the basement.
Comrade lieutenant, where is Anya?
What?
Anya?
I saw her running to you.
Take him to the basement.
Let me go!
Where are you going?
I will find her!
Akimov!
Sasha!
I will find her!
Don't!
Please, don't!
Please, don't kill me!
No! No!
Please, don't!
- Bring him here.
- Report this to Fomin.
Faster!
Faster!
I remember Fomin and Zubachev.
They had a small detachment at Holmsky Gates.
They held the enemy back from crossing the bridge.
This was the first time that
I saw a captive German.
Maslov!
What is he saying?
He is saying that most likely
Minsk has been taken.
He is saying we are far behind in the rear.
Why do you need Minsk?
Why are you here?
Why did you come here?
You are lying.
Comrade commissar, come look!
Ours!
Ours!
Behind him!
- Alive?
- Yes.
Good job!
Come on!
Lieutenant Karelin.
123rd air force division.
Commissar Fomin.
Tell us. What's happening in Brest?
In Kobrin?
Why is our aviation silent?
Where is our army?
There are no air fields left.
They have all been destroyed.
Germans have taken Brest.
Our army is retreating towards Minsk.
Comrades.
Fighters.
The Germans are offering us to surrender.
They are offering us a cowardly life in captivity.
They are mistaken.
We are soldiers of the Red Army, and we will defend our motherland till the last drop of blood.
There is no other choice for us.
24 June
Mister, give me some water.
Don't have any, dear.
Yes, you do.
Please, give me some, Mister.
Where is your family, Kostya?
I don't know.
I left them at my house, in the basement.
But now I don't know.
I don't know anything about mine either.
You can't drink this.
It has gasoline.
I remember that morning.
Or was it day?
I woke up and saw hands.
They were Kovalenko's hands.
He was carving a whistle for me.
I looked at it and thought to myself, what would I need it for?
We must unite our forces and go for a breakthrough.
Who are we waiting for here?
Breakthrough. Immediately. Tonight.
Or we will lose everyone one by one.
What breakthrough?
The fortress is surrounded.
Brest has been taken.
Breakthrough to where?
To captivity? Death? Where to?
We are dead men already, comrade captain.
Yes, many of us will die.
Maybe everyone.
But while we have strength, we must keep fighting.
We must go for a breakthrough.
Write down the order.
What number?
Order number one.
24th of June 1941.
The Fortress.
The situation in the Fortress requires an immediate exit.
Strike out "an immediate exit."
Write down "organized military action."
For the continued battle with the enemy... the commanding leadership, commissar Fomin, captain Zubachev, lieutenant Vinogradov, has decided... to unite the remaining military units... into a joint group.
With combined forces... tonight, on the 24th of June, we are going for a breakthrough.
... for a breakthrough.
In order to reconnect with the regular units of the Red Army.
... of the Red Army.
And to continue fighting the Nazi invaders.
Germans are on the bridge!
Everyone take your positions!
Come here!
Listen carefully.
Judging by the constant exchange of fire at the Terespol Gates and Eastern Fort...
I can tell that our men are still fighting there.
Try to get to them whatever it takes.
Report our situation to them.
And tell them about our decision to go for a breakthrough.
Tonight! Try to get to them before the breakthrough begins and come back here.
Alive!
Comrade commissar, may I go?
No, you may not.
Drink some water.
This is all I have.
Give it to the wounded.
- Execute the order.
- Yes, sir.
Take this to the wounded in the basement.
- Execute.
- Yes, sir.
Easy, easy. Everything's alright.
Finish it yourself.
Doctor?
Doctor?
On Saturday a whole shipment of cold mineral water was brought to the store.
To the basements!
I couldn't make it!
You go to the Eastern Fort.
Our men are there.
Tell them about the order that tonight - breakthrough.
I will tell them.
I knew that nothing would happen to me.
Because I had to deliver this order.
Anya...
It's hard to get out of here right now.
Stay here for a bit.
I can't take you with me.
I have an order.
I must deliver it.
Do you hear me?
There was no water.
Actually, it was all around, but you could not get to it.
All routes to the coast were under constant fire.
For one cup of water, for just one mouthful of it... people died.
What little water could be obtained was saved.
For the machine guns.
Comrade major, allow me to report.
Foster student of musical platoon with the 333rd regiment Akimov.
An order:
Tonight there will be a joint breakthrough.
The signal - a red rocket.
I am lucky with Akimovs.
I am Fortress. I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
25 June
It's time.
Follow me.
Let's go.
Go!
Follow me!
Tereshenko, where did it hit?
My shoulder.
Vereshenko, help him!
Yes, sir!
Retreat everyone!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Comrade military physician.
Yes.
I did everything I could.
Show compassion for yourselves and your loved ones.
Spare your children.
Spare your children.
Do something, commander.
Anya!
Anya!
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not just asking you, Katya.
You cannot order me.
I won't go.
Then no one will go.
You are my wife.
The wife of a commander.
People will follow you.
We have lost Anya already.
I don't want to lose you all too.
I want you to go.
This is your last and only chance.
You must bring up the children.
You can do it.
You are strong.
You are very strong.
You are the strongest.
Anya.
Anya, do you hear me?
You have to go.
Your father is looking for you.
He's there.
He's waiting for you.
He's in the barracks.
You have to go.
You have to go.
You have 15 minutes left.
Sonny, go!
You have 10 minutes left.
Daddy.
Anya!
Alive!
Sasha!
You must go!
You will go together.
I am serving in the military.
I'm not going anywhere.
Akimov, this is an order.
Do you hear me?
She will not go without you.
Do you hear me?
She will not go.
Yes, comrade lieutenant.
Execute.
You have 5 minutes left.
26 June
"I die, but I do not surrender."
Having exhausted all other options... the Germans decided to drop a two-ton- kilogram bomb on the Brest Fortress.
I am Fortress.
Battle in progress.
Holding down defense.
Waiting for reinforcements.
Dance! Dance, bastard!
Commissars!
Jews! Communists!
Stand to the side.
I am a commissar.
A communist and a Jew.
Commissar Efim Moiseevich Fomin... was executed by a firing squad at Holmsky Gates... at the end of June 1941.
In 1957 he was awarded with the Order of Lenin.
Posthumously.
An order:
Exit the Fortress one by one.
Stay alive.
As long as possible.
Thank you, comrades.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Major Pyotr Mihailovich Gavrilov... was taken captive, while seriously wounded, on the 32nd day of war.
Like most who survived Nazi captivity, he later fell victim to Stalin's repressions and was expelled from the communist party.
And only in 1957 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
- ls this all of us?
- Yes, sir.
I ran away.
While they were taking the captives through the forest, I ran away.
While I was on my way here, a bomb went off near me.
I am deaf now.
My ears can't hear anything.
While we still have strength
I order you to go for a breakthrough... through the encirclement area.
Nikolaev, you will take charge.
I will stay here. I will cover you.
- But...
- Execute!
- Don't be difficult.
- Yes, sir.
Come here.
Help me.
Keep this safe.
You are lucky. I know you will get out of the Fortress.
And one more thing...
Tell them everything you saw.
Tell the whole truth.
Tell them about us.
Do you hear me, trumpet player?
You don't hear me.
Go.
Go, Sasha.
Go.
In 1965 the commander of the 9th frontier post, lieutenant Andrey
Mitrofanovich Kizhevatov, was awarded the title of
Hero of the Soviet Union.
Posthumously.
My Anya and the whole Kizhevatov family, as well as the families of other defenders of the Brest Fortress, were executed by the Germans in autumn of 1942.
The banner that Kizhevatov had given me
I have kept to this very day.
Just as I have kept my memories.
And faith.
I believe to this day.
And you believe too.
They are all alive.
Everyone who I told you about and those who we don't know much about.
They are all alive.
Somewhere.
And at that time I was just about the same age as you are now.
The sky of blue beyond the river is dark,
Wait a little, and you will hear a cricket sing,
And a silly bird will suddenly frighten the disturbed peace and quiet.
I can hear the crack of a paddle nearby,
The new day has come a little too early...
I only feel warm when you are by my side,
Everything will be all right from now on.
It's calm now
The night is fading out slowly,
It appears each of us knows something
But unable to hide the tears, the inevitable payment for the communion.
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...
The blue sky has hidden itself, as if waiting for something,
Winking to those who are not sleeping,
Happiness will suddenly squeeze your heart
And will not say anything
Though it may be something very important
The dawn will get wet again, embarrassed,
Pretending to be a haze in a grey rain-coat,
There's nothing here what there used to be before you, or, maybe, there is something, but very different.
It's calm now
The night is fading out slowly,
It appears each of us knows something
But unable to hide the tears, the inevitable payment for the communion.
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...
Don't let me die before l get to know
How it feels to be happy...

SARAH'S KEY
Daddy?
What are you doing?
Stay put. I won't be long.
Mr. Starzynski open up!
My husband isn't here.
Police madam. Open up!
Open up madam.
Or we'll break the door down.
July 16th 1942
Mrs. Starzynski?
My husband's away.
I don't know where.
You're coming with us.
Pack enough for 3 days.
Where are we going?
Bring blankets food and your ID papers.
And my dolly?
Only necessary items.
Hold on...
Michel? Is he your son?
Yes.
I don't understand.
The children too?
Where is he?
He's not here.
Do what you want with me but don't take my children.
I'm begging you.
What's going on?
You're going to hide.
- I don't want to.
- Come on.
- Like yesterday. It's a game.
- Okay.
Get in.
Where are your son and husband?
Don't make me get angry.
I don't know where they are.
Don't move.
You promise?
I'll be back later.
Sir I swear
I don't know where they are.
I don't know.
They're out in the country.
My little brother was ill.
Dad said it'd do him good.
Give me the apartment keys please.
Where are her husband and son?
I haven't seen her husband lately.
As for the boy...
I last saw him two days ago.
He may have hid in the cellar.
You should take a look.
It was so hot he didn't sleep all night. Nobody did.
In fact the cellar might be the place to sleep.
Shall I show you?
We'll be back.
But if you see them...
Daddy!
Don't cry darling. Don't cry.
Sarah?
Are you there?
It smells like Mamé.
The first time I saw Mamé she was standing right there.
I was on my best behavior, trying to convince her that petite American was in love with her beloved grandson.
She was quite some mama type.
Mom, she is still alive.
As good as new here ready for us to move in!
If you want an open kitchen we'll remove this wall no problem.
- It's not load-bearing?
- We'll put in a header.
And knock it down.
You're the architect.
Zoé.
If you're interested this is your room.
Really?
How many square meters in all?
Not many.
I'll move this wall to here to make it bigger with two windows.
How's that sound princess?
You're scratchy.
Did I tell you the story of this apartment?
At first my grandparents could only afford to rent this part.
In the 50s they bought this bit and joined them together and added that bit later.
The Marais used to be a working-class neighborhood.
This was my dad's room at your age.
Your grandfather.
He was a kid too once.
Apparently some never grow up.
So, these are our rich competitors.
And this... is us.
Exactly a battle of loss, is it?
- Times are tough.
- That's why... we're gonna try to imagine an ideal society... a utopia for the 21st century.
You want us to do something on plastic surgery?
No, the naked woman's just to push sales.
The idea's to focus on all the... good things the future can hold once the crisis is over.
Biotechnology, nanotechnology, the new space race.
- Positive thinking.
- From a grabby old pessimist.
Look I'm not gonna force anyone.
Just think about it. Besides people could use it like the fresh air.
I'm not that old.
Also I wanna do something on the Middle East, and the new Obama administration.
I'll get the London office take care of that one.
What else? What else? What else?
Yes...
I wanna do something on the state ruling in favor of that deportee's daughter in the case against the French government and the SNCF.
Oh, she won?
Right. The Chirac speech in '95 at the Vel d'Hiv
- has finally served some purpose.
- Chirac at the what?
Het Vel d'Hiv.
How do you spell that?
- You're joking.
- What happened?
In July 1942...
In the 16th and 17th of July 1942 they arrested 13,000 Jews,
Mostly women and children.
They took 8,000 of them, put them in Velodrome d'Hiver in inhuman conditions.
Imagine the Superdome in
New Orleans...
- only a million times worse.
- A million times worse.
And then they sent them to the camps.
You seem to know your stuff.
I covered the 60th anniversary for Time Magazine.
I wanted to do a feature.
And they gave me half page.
Which is why... you're gonna give me 10 pages.
10 pages?
No, Julia, I can't give you 10 pages.
Why not?
Readers love history.
Most not even heard of this.
Apologies from the youth of today.
Yeah.
It is an old indoor cycling track?
Should be beautiful.
Where is it?
- Torn down 50 years ago.
- Any photos?
None. What's the point?
Over 10,000 people squeezed together for days, no beds, no toilets, barely any water.
- And not one image of it.
- No, there is one.
There is a wide shot looking down over some buses outside the exit.
It's weird. I mean...
Knowingly they're really good at documenting everything, the Nazis.
This is what they're known for.
Mike.
This was not the German.
It was the French.
I don't get it.
How could you leave him?
He'll be safe there.
In the closet?
It all happened so quickly.
It's only till we get back.
You don't understand.
They had it coming to them!
Don't talk nonsense!
After them it'll be our turn.
You old fool! We're French!
It won't happen to us.
You stupid woman!
No running on the track!
Daddy I need the toilet.
You know where the toilets are?
The toilets please?
They're all blocked up sir.
What about water?
Some water to drink?
It's so hot in here and there's no air.
Sir!
My mother, brother and I were going to meet my dad in the free zone.
The police arrived just as we finished packing.
I managed to create a diversion and they escaped down the back stairs.
I told them on my own I had a chance.
What about you?
- You didn't hear the rumors?
- Sure.
There have been new rumors every day for weeks.
Until now they only arrested men.
Surely they won't send all these kids to work camps?
That's their plan?
For us to jump one after the other to lose our minds?
Mummy we have to get Michel.
See now?
We should have brought him with us!
Let me through!
Think only of yourself.
Only yourself.
Some men have permits we can get out with.
No one will help us get out.
Earlier a policeman helped me.
He told me which bus to get on.
The other was going to a camp.
Escape's impossible.
To begin with get rid of your star.
Please madam...
Let my little brother out.
Stop that!
Anyway you'll never make it out.
Give me that.
Thanks.
My name's Anna.
Nurse!
What's wrong madam?
I don't know. I'm coughing up blood.
You're not making it up?
We have very few doctors you know.
Come on.
I'll see you get immediate treatment.
Wait!
I need to speak to her.
My son's locked up at home.
Please sir...
Be reasonable and sit back down.
Please arrest my son!
Go and arrest my son!
36 Rue Saintonge.
Third floor.
See?
Why didn't you give her the key?
Why didn't you trust me?
Why did you lock him in?
Do you realize what you've done?
Do you realize?
A street like others.
No trace of the past.
There's a plaque on the Bld. Grenelle... and there's a statue hidden away on the quai de Grenelle. Watch out...
But the entrance to the Vel d'Hiv was here?
Yeah.
The irony of history.
Ministry of the Interior
I could never talk about it.
I can imagine.
The entrance to the Velodrome was just there across the street.
From here you could hear...
And then...
After a few days we had to keep the windows closed even at night.
The noise?
The smell.
You have no idea!
Did the neighbors try to find out what was going on inside?
Try to understand?
Understand?
It's easy to understand afterwards.
Back then we were fed so many stories about the Jews.
What could we do anyway?
Call the police?
Sarah.
Wake up. Come on.
We're going.
We can go home now?
Mummy I don't feel well.
You have a headache?
My God!
Where are they taking us?
I heard we're going to Pitchipoi.
No Beaune-la-Rolande.
Apparently all those sent to Pithiviers will be released.
Believe that if you want but I think we'll end up in Germany or Poland.
In the end wherever we go it's always the same.
Just like back home.
Do you see this ring?
It contains poison.
Nobody in the world can choose when I die.
Nobody.
Good morning Mrs. Tezac.
Don't call her Tezac.
She prefers Jarmond.
That's her maiden name.
Ms. Jarmond!
She uses her American name.
It's an American habit.
Ms. Jarmond's an American!
You're in a good mood.
The only Mrs. Tezac here is me!
Goodbye ladies.
I brought you this...
- How thoughtful of you.
- And the cream.
And your good-for-nothing husband?
How is he? He never visits.
He's very busy but he often thinks about you.
Nonsense!
And how are you?
You look tired.
Really?
No I'm fine.
I just finished a difficult interview.
What about the apartment then?
We went to look round.
Don't smash it up will you?
You young people don't realize but it was our home for over 60 years.
A lifetime.
- 60 years?
- That's right.
That's right 60 years.
At the beginning it wasn't much.
As people said during the war
"Make do and mend."
You moved in during the war?
Yes. August 1942.
It was very bohemian.
Three of us in one room over the store in Rue de Turenne.
Édouard was only 9 years old at the time.
So when the concierge mentioned a vacant 2-room apartment nearby...
Why was it vacant?
That I don't remember.
It was too long ago.
Can you pour me a glass of water?
Thanks.
What's wrong? You're deathly pale.
I must have got up too quickly.
My head's spinning.
Gracious me you're pregnant!
Don't you remember?
When I was younger it was complicated so now...
I can sense these things.
You're pregnant.
Hey it's me.
You're home?
In the Marais.
To see how it's looking.
- The workers there?
- No.
What do you mean no?
I mean no.
You knew your grandparents moved in during the war?
Sure of course. And?
No reason. I'll tell you later.
Tell me my dear Bertrand would you care to buy me dinner?
It would be my pleasure.
Does 9 p. m. suit you?
Perfectly.
Beaune-la-Rolande Transit Camp July 1942
Hurry up now!
Women and children this way!
Women and children on the right!
Men on the left!
Excuse me sir...
Hurry up!
Is there a doctor?
My daughter's sick.
No sir leave her with your wife!
Get back!
My daughter's running a fever.
Can anyone help?
Please!
Is there a doctor here?
Mummy...
How long are we staying?
I don't know Sarah.
And Daddy?
When will we see him again?
Soon sweetheart.
Soon.
Sorry the Beijing meeting dragged on.
- Did they sign?
- Not yet.
No kiss?
Sure.
You're not drinking?
No I'm fine.
What's this all about?
See? It's our table.
Damn!
What?
Nothing.
For a moment
I thought I'd forgotten our anniversary.
Why are you so tense? Calm down.
Too much pressure.
It's pretty hairy.
Can't you turn it off?
I'm expecting a call from the Chinese.
See? Pressure.
Bertrand...
I have good news for you.
Frankly I expected a little more enthusiasm.
I don't want to be an old dad.
Finally you admit to getting old.
Yes I'm getting old.
Faster than you.
It's a risk for the child.
Look...
Our life's changed.
Zoé's almost a teen we have a new apartment
I work like crazy.
It's time to ease up.
If you answer it I take a taxi.
After years of fertility tests IVF and two miscarriages now you want me to have an abortion?
Julia it's been six years now.
I'd come to terms with it.
The doctors said it'd take a miracle.
What's this if not a miracle?
Hurry up!
We have to fetch Michel.
Make it snappy!
I promised him.
Infants on the right.
Older children with their mothers.
Go on back to your Mummy.
Stay with Mummy.
Listen to me all of you!
Women and children over the age of 12... will leave the camp first.
Younger children will stay here another week before joining their families.
Your husbands have already left.
You'll see them soon!
Cooperate and everything will be fine!
We won't go without them!
Back in line damn it!
I love you darling.
I love you with all my heart.
May God protect you!
Some were at the Vel d'Hiv and all were among the 11,000 children sent from France.
The principle I apply to my work is to escape statistics to give a face and reality to each individual destiny.
It's awful. I keep picturing my daughter as one of these children.
Unfortunately when you start looking into this you don't come out unscathed.
And you? Unscathed?
This work is necessary and probably also cathartic.
Sorry I forgot to turn it off.
My father-in-law.
Answer it if it's important.
I'll call him back later.
Is everything okay?
Were there a lot of Jews in the Marais?
Historically it was a Jewish quarter.
Like Belleville and Menilmontant. Why?
No reason it's just...
My husband and I are about to move into an apartment that belongs to his family in Rue Saintonge.
I just found out that they first rented it in August '42.
They're good people.
It must be a coincidence.
You want me to check?
I have that information on my computer.
It was wartime. People got by any way they could.
Just to put my mind at rest.
What number Rue Saintonge?
There were three families in that building.
Which floor?
My mum sang me that when I was little.
It soothed me when I was sick and couldn't sleep.
You've slept for three days with a raging fever.
You kept saying Michel key closet...
I didn't understand a word.
You want this?
I have to fetch my little brother.
We have to get out.
You mean escape?
I saw a woman do it at the Velodrome.
If you help two of us stand a better chance.
Careful you got up too fast.
It's impossible to escape.
There's no one left.
What's happened?
Don't you remember?
Yes.
What the hell's all this?
Did you see where the women came with food?
There was a gap under the wire like a hole.
You want to go now?
Not at night. It's too quiet.
And they have searchlights.
In daytime we're outside.
It's easier.
With all the noise and sobbing kids.
And if it's as hot as today the police will stay in the shade.
We need to find more sweaters.
We'll grab lots and put them all on.
It's boiling!
That way the barbed wire will hurt less.
Sarah, I was thinking...
Your brother, he must have done the same as us.
He must have escaped.
No I'm sure he hasn't.
Why?
Because I made him promise.
Quickly!
Where are you going?
Go away!
Let me go sir.
My little brother's on his own in Paris.
It's my fault.
I locked him in when they rounded us up.
I made him promise to wait.
It's too late now.
In any case you have no choice.
You're staying here.
It's forbidden to escape.
Jacques...
You know my name?
I heard someone say it.
I'll remember the apple all my life.
My name's Sarah.
Sarah Starzynski.
Go on!
Okay?
It smells good.
Our stars!
We have to get rid of our stars!
Look over there.
Come on!
Look! It's a village!
I must be sick I don't feel well.
Let's go! Hurry!
Come on...
I feel really sick.
Maybe they'll take us.
What are you doing?
I'll never make it.
Look there's a light on.
Jules!
Look at those two!
Just give us some water. She's sick.
Scram! We don't want trouble!
Get lost I said!
Call yourself a guard dog?
Yeah, isn't that dangerous at your age?
I'll get an amnio.
You could get a miscarriage.
Yeah, I could get hit by a bus.
Julia, why are you doing this?
You have done so much already.
Because it feels right.
And if Bertrand is supportive, that will be okay.
Yes, if he's supportive.
It does not tell him anything, dirty diapers... and sleepless nights.
You guys are both too old for this.
Great. Thanks. That's great.
Really helpful. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, tell me about the apartment.
Was the latest... I mean...
It's absolutely crazy, does that mean they stole it?
No, like the Marais, it was kinda like the Lower East Side.
Jewish immigrants were tenants.
So I don't think it's stolen.
Yeah, what does Bertrand think about all this?
He doesn't know yet.
I have not the guts to tell him.
Look sis, you are a New Yorker and a fighter, and 25 years in France is not gonna change that.
- You do what you gotta do.
- Yeah.
Easier said than done.
Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski.
Deported and executed at
Auschwitz in 1942.
No Sarah, no Michel...
The Starzynski children are not on any of the lists of deportees neither in Poland nor Drancy.
I'm sure they escaped.
Julia, you're obsessing.
Well, wouldn't you be?
These people could be anywhere.
They may still be alive.
Okay, and what are you going to do?
Give them back their France?
Yeah, why not?
Okay.
I would just let sleeping dogs lie. And... you know what I mean.
It's my father-in-law.
I just can't believe they didn't know anything.
Is that what they told you?
I don't know how to bring it up.
Well, you know there's a simple way- you... pick up the phone, and you ask them.
You're very quiet this morning.
That's all we need.
Quiet she's in a bad way.
Should we call the doctor?
Dr. Thévenin's on holiday.
I often see his stand-in talking to Germans.
We'll see how she is later.
I can't wait I have to go to Paris!
What are you saying?
After all this time my poor girl he must've escaped you know.
He swore to wait. I have to go now.
I'll burn all that it'll be safer.
I'll give you some of Nicolas's clothes.
Who's that?
My grandson. He's your age.
With your hair under a hat you'll look like a boy.
What about Paris?
What about hot milk and some bread and butter?
What do you say?
What's your name?
Michelle.
I can't let him wait.
It's okay Michelle...
You can relax now.
She's very sick.
She needs a doctor.
Not yet.
She's sleeping. We'll see.
Help me!
The blanket.
We have to get the doctor.
You can see she's dying.
Lieutenant the child is ill.
She's ill I agree.
How was I to know?
I couldn't leave her by the road to die.
Two children escaped from the camp.
You're sure you didn't see another?
No there was only the girl.
You realize the risk you'd be taking if you hid the child?
If we'd hidden another why would we call the doctor?
Go ahead search...
Search if you're calling us liars.
You think we're that stupid?
Go on go up.
You're wasting your time.
She's dead.
Diphtheria.
It was too late to do anything for her.
I'll put her in my car.
I'll expect you tomorrow at the Kommandantur to make an official statement.
It won't take long.
Heil Hitler!
Fetch the girl.
One dead child today is quite enough.
My real name is Sarah.
Édouard?
You get the days mixed up?
Hello darling.
That's what I was just saying.
He was supposed to come yesterday.
I'm not the only basket case in the family.
Julia you never answer my calls.
I left you three messages.
Sorry I've been very busy.
I was going to call you back.
Why are you avoiding me?
I know you asked Mamé and Bertrand about the apartment.
You do?
Can we step outside?
What are you two up to?
Please.
We're just going outside Mamé.
We'll be right back.
Let's go to my car.
We can talk there.
Come now lad don't be scared of me.
One day you'll be a soldier too won't you?
Allow me...
He's a fine looking boy.
You don't have much luggage.
At least we can be sure you're not black marketeers.
Identity papers.
Sorry excuse me.
And the boy?
In the envelope. At the bottom.
A problem?
No it's fine.
Thank you.
I talked to Bertrand.
He said you were writing an article...
On the roundup of the Jews.
How's the apartment relevant?
I thought she couldn't get up.
Just when you think you know a person...
No sly allusions please.
And stay out of other people's business if you don't mind.
If I said "Starzynski"?
My family had nothing to do with the Starzynskis' arrest.
You knew?
Yes.
Nobody else knew except my father and I.
Meaning?
She must never find out you understand?
She was out that day.
What day?
The day the girl came back.
I answered the door to her.
For goodness' sake slow down.
You don't know who you'll meet.
See you up there.
The apartment's already taken.
There are others opposite.
We're just going up to the 3rd floor.
The Tezacs'?
Michel!
Who's that?
Goodness Sarah wait!
Where's Michel? Where's my brother?
Your brother?
Dad!
What's all this ruckus?
I'm sorry!
My father wanted to pay for everything.
But I think the other couple took the body away with them.
I don't remember.
And Mamé?
She was in the store.
Dad didn't want her to find out.
It's impossible.
You must have noticed something.
When we moved in there was a terrible stench.
There was a dead cat in the kitchen.
There was barely any furniture.
The apartment had been ransacked.
It was wartime you see.
So we threw everything out.
But the stench was still there.
Dad thought there must be a dead bird in the gutter.
We closed the window but...
It only got worse. You see?
We couldn't find the key to the closet.
We didn't want to break the door down.
That was when the girl arrived.
In the afternoon on the second day.
What happened to Sarah?
From 1942 to his death
Dad never once spoke her name.
Sarah was part of the secret.
Whenever I asked where she was what happened to her he told me to be quiet.
Do you want to know?
You know where she is?
I don't know but...
I do know she was never sent to the camps.
When my father died... the lawyer told me about... certain personal papers.
They're kept at the bank.
I never dared take a look.
You'd allow me to take a look?
Anyone home?
So? What do you think?
It's beautiful.
Isn't it beautiful?
I don't know if I can live here one day.
I don't know...
I can't picture us here.
It's just perfect for the three of us.
- The three of us?
- Sure.
Come here...
Not too much.
Why aren't you always like this?
What do you mean like this?
Like this.
Sorry.
Don't you see how phony this is?
What's going on?
You're being so sweet now.
But... you want me to abort!
You only once asked me what the doc said.
You don't give a damn!
Anyway we know your answer.
You're going to China.
Look we've talked about this.
I think it's best for us.
A whole new life.
I know. In one week you sign the deal of the century.
No money worries for the next 150 years!
Grown-up daughter beautiful apartment from deported Jews...
What?
Nothing.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
It's been a long and tiring day.
I have to go.
What did you just say?
I shouldn't have said it.
Talk to your father.
Did you know?
I only found out today like you.
Why didn't you ever say?
To protect you all.
I suppose... you'll tell your sisters?
How can I keep it a secret?
For Mamé.
It was her home all her life.
Your wife.
- Édouard?
- Yes, Julia.
- Do you know where Bertrand is?
- He's right here.
I'm really sorry.
- I didn't want it to be this way.
- He's a big boy.
He'll cope.
Why are you calling exactly?
It's late.
About your father.
I wanted you to know he always did the right thing.
Thank you, Julia.
Don't mention it. Goodnight.
Dear sir, I wanted to thank you again on Sarah's behalf.
You asked us not to but we told her you send 100 francs every month for her.
I had to tell her the honest truth.
I hope you understand.
Last week we harvested the wheat.
Sarah worked relentlessly until her arms throbbed in pain.
As usual she never complained.
I noticed your last two cheques were for 120 francs.
Now the war's over we'll buy her clothes in Orléans.
I enclose a photo of her with my two grandsons Nicolas and Edgar.
She's beautiful isn't she?
Sarah!
Watch out you'll catch cold.
Don't worry.
What the heck are you doing?
Dear sir,
Sarah is very well.
In November the whole family visited the D-Day beaches.
It was the first time she'd seen the sea.
She's really grown you know.
Her personality's changed markedly.
She's secretive and wild.
And she's tempted by other horizons.
These dark days sully our nation's history forever.
74 trains left for Auschwitz.
76,000 Jews were deported from France and never came back.
Yes the criminal madness of the Occupier was as we all know abetted by French citizens abetted by the French state.
Julia, you are right. We're gonna put this online to go with the article.
Nice speech, but... didn't bring anybody back.
His words made noise at the time.
Supposed to carry more weight, don't you think?
Your article is amazing, Julia.
Well, I think that this all happened right in the middle of Paris in front of everyone... is absolutely disgusting.
Then how do you know what you'd have done?
What do you mean?
If you'd been there, how do you know... what you'd have done?
I watched that story on TV, you know like the bombing of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan...
- Mike, please.
- But...
Yes speaking.
Thanks for calling me back.
No I'm looking for Nicolas or Edgar Dufaure.
Or family members...
What's going on with Julia?
Does anybody know?
I don't know.
Or even distant relations?
Thanks for calling anyway.
Mom? Who's this?
That was a little girl I'm trying to track down. I'll tell you about it.
You'll tell me if there is something wrong, right?
Sweetie, of course.
Don't worry.
Morning Mrs. Tezac.
Take this pill and get ready.
Are you fasting?
Good. I'll pop back later.
On the form you left the "person to notify" box blank.
Is it mandatory?
Yes we need a name.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Julia it's me.
I wanted to say I wish I was there.
I'm thinking of you.
I hope it all went okay.
I'm also very aware that what we're going through is difficult but we've been there before and we'll make it.
I love you.
All my love.
Hello I got your message last night.
I'm Nathalie Dufaure.
A cousin gave me your number.
My father was Nicolas Dufaure.
I'm not sure how I can help you but if you want you can reach me on the number on caller ID.
Have a good day.
A termination?
Yes but she doesn't seem very sure.
I think I can be there in two hours.
What's going on Mrs. Tezac?
Okay outside the church.
If I have a problem I'll call you.
Thank you very much goodbye.
If you've changed your mind take the time to think it through.
Actually I have thought it through and I think I've wasted your time.
I'm really sorry but...
There you go.
Hello.
See? You couldn't miss it.
Nathalie.
Can I leave the car here?
Shall we go?
When I told my grandfather you wanted to see him about Sarah you can't imagine how his face lit up.
He thought you could give him news.
Or be his daughter.
It's over 50 years since he last saw her.
Forgive me.
I love you.
It was in May 1953.
She just left without giving an address.
It hit my great-grandfather worst.
But he never blamed her.
He told me on his deathbed.
He understood. He was expecting it.
She never tried to get in touch?
You've no idea where she might be?
This was the last we heard of her.
In 1955.
I guess it was just to say she'd made a new life for herself.
It came with no explanation.
May I?
Of course.
Sarah and Richard Rainsferd... in Brooklyn.
She went to America.
Right.
There you are. I've been trying to reach you the whole day.
My phone was off the hook.
- Good to see you.
- I too.
Bertrand called.
He is worried.
What is going on?
Did you go thru the...?
You have to talk to him.
I miss him too.
- I wish I came home more often.
- So do I.
Did you find what I asked you for?
Yes, any idiot with internet connection could have.
There are five... five Rainsferd in Brooklyn.
Up to you to find the right one.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know.
Someone.
I am looking for Sarah or
Richard Rainsferd.
Not heard of them.
Thank you.
I am looking for Richard and
Sarah Rainsferd.
No, there is no Richard or Sarah here.
And... anyone in your family called Richard or Sarah?
- No, I'm sorry. No one.
- Ok. Right.
- Thank you.
- Take care.
I'm sorry to bother you sir.
Are you Richard Rainsferd?
No, Bob Rainsferd.
Do you know Sarah or Richard Rainsferd?
No, sorry.
- Thank you for your time.
- Ok.
So, next is...
Hi! Can I help you?
Yeah, I am looking for Ms. Rainsferd, but I'm not sure this is the right house.
Oh sure. My mother is out shopping.
You're a friend?
No, not a friend. I- I just know some of his family.
- Oh, in Europe?
- Yeah, in Europe. Yeah.
So... you're living in the city now?
No, I live in Paris.
But I grew up here.
Wow, the most beautiful city in the world. I marvel at it.
- Your mother told you that?
- My mother mostly talked about Rome.
Excuse me.
Hello.
We'll be with you all day.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
That was Amber, my father's nurse.
She'll be coming by soon.
Oh is he sick? I'm sorry.
Yeah. But mother is strong.
She's always the one cheering us all up.
Oh, that's her. Excuse me.
I've to help her.
It was in 1966.
Probably a tire blew out.
The truck driver claimed she just swerved towards him and there was nothing he could do.
I met Richard two years later.
At first he didn't want to get remarried.
In some way, he... he wanted to remain always
Sarah's husband.
But, as years went by and... finally he'd changed his mind and so... here we are.
Their son lives in Italy.
She had a son?
William, my half-brother.
He was nine... when Sarah had her accident.
Afterward, it was difficult to cope, but...
I raised him like my own.
I taught him to love Italy... to eat pasta.
And by chance, he met a woman... from the village where I was born.
And he never came back.
He is living in Florence now.
It did him good to- to leave America... and to start over in Europe.
Amber. Pardon me a moment.
Excuse me.
May I speak to your husband?
I don't know if it's a good idea... to bring all these up again.
He is very sick, you know.
I understand.
And what about his son?
Mom, I want you to be straight.
Are you having an affair?
No. Of course not.
Why do you want to leave Dad?
I never said that. What...
Who told you that? Did he?
No, but... if you didn't, why would you just leave like that to Florence?
Sweetie...
It's way more complicated than that.
Listen, I'm coming home tomorrow and we'll talk about it.
Is that ok?
And the baby...
You should have told me about it.
I'm a 13 kid you know.
I know, I know,
I'm sorry.
- Don't you want us to have a little baby?
- I didn't say that.
Actually, I love to have a little brother.
Or a little sister.
Whatever, just don't count on me to change any diapers.
I love you, choupinette.
Are you Julia?
You speak French?
Childhood memories talking with Mum.
But I guess I'm a bit... rusty?
What would you like to drink?
Water, it will be perfect.
You want dinner?
Just drink something.
Water and a glass of Brunello.
So, you are a journalist.
I looked you up.
I read your amazing book on
Tuscan cuisine.
Thank you. It's responsible for that-
10 pounds I haven't been able to lose.
So, what can I do for you?
You're... obviously way too young to know my mother.
I'm from the Tezac family.
- The who?
- The Tezac.
I'm sorry, it doesn't ring a bell.
Tezac. No.
I mean they... took over the apartment on rue de Saintonge just after your mother's family were...
And... my father-in-law,
Édouard Tezac was there the day... they found your uncle Michel.
I don't have an uncle.
Your mother's younger brother.
My mother didn't had any brother.
And I never heard of Rue de Saintonge.
Perhaps you mix me up with someone else.
Your mother's name is Sarah?
Yes, my mother's name is Sarah,
Sarah Rainsferd.
And before that Sarah Dufaure.
And Starzynski, it doesn't mean anything to you?
Starzynski? No.
I'm sorry. I guess that means you come all this way for nothing.
I'm so sorry.
You must be talking about... some other Sarah.
What is it you wanted to say to the son of this supposed...
Do you recognize her?
It is impossible. No...
There is a little resemblance, but...
This isn't my mother.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
My mother wasn't...
Jewish.
What are you up to?
Why did you come here?
To tell my mother was called something else?
That she was involved in this tragedy?
Is that why you're here?
I'm so sorry.
I thought you knew.
This is insane.
My mother was French.
Her name was Dufaure.
She never had a brother.
She never lived in rue de Saintonge because she never even lived in Paris.
- You've got it all wrong.
- No please, let me explain that.
I think you should know the whole story.
No, no. I don't want to know.
- Please. I think it is important...
- No, no.
Let me be clear.
I don't wanna talk about this.
And I don't want to see you again.
And please do not call me.
Enjoy Florence.
You have to admit it's crazy, vanishing like that.
New York, Italy, seeing this guy.
What did you hope to find?
Now you've stirred it all up the whole family knows, even Mamé.
Just think aged 95...
- You care about her now?
- Not that, not today!
Anyway what's the problem?
Your honor’s intact.
Your family's blameless.
You can move in now, but count me out!
We're selling it.
Rest assured we want to get rid of it.
Family decision.
But remember I grew up there.
I only wanted to know the truth.
The truth?
The journalist's quest.
So where does it get us now this bright shiny truth?
We're all much happier now even that guy.
Everything's so much better now the truth's out.
Truth has a price whether you like it or not.
Fine.
What do we do now?
I don't know.
But I deeply desire to keep this baby.
Can you understand that just as deeply
I don't want it?
Yes I understand.
We always wanted another child.
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, William..
You're supposed to be with your wife and kids?
No, I should be right here... right now.
You saw that lady journalist, didn't you?
Yes, the one with the crazy story,
I most certainly did.
Sit down, William.
- I'll help you.
- No, no. Sit down.
You're not gonna tell me that... all this was true?
Are you?
I remember... the first time I saw your mother.
It was in a dance hall in Manhattan.
There were two things that came into mind.
The first...
She was the most incredibly beautiful woman...
I had ever seen in my life.
The second...
Behind those smiles... she may be hiding something.
We had a good time.
But I guess... she felt uncomfortable in the world around her.
She also was the saddest... person that I had ever met.
I used 10 years trying to erase that sadness.
But then I realized how impossible it was.
It wasn't an accident you know.
What?
Her accident... was not an accident.
Are you saying she killed herself?
- Dad!
- Look...
Look, at her final years that depression kept getting worse and worse than ever.
All the pills, and the booze and...
Like there was something grey inside her ... that kept growing all the time maligner.
- You want a shot?
- No.
- You won't tell me, will you?
- No. Go on.
We had some horrible arguments...
- about your identity.
- No.
What you should...
What you shouldn't know.
We never agreed about anything.
She took precautions too.
Right after you were born... she rushed out of the hospital with you... for a church to get you baptized.
I took a day off work so I wouldn't miss it.
For her, if you were Jewish... your life was in danger.
It's... irrational, sure, you know, but ... everything's in here.
What is?
What's this?
We never talked about it ... but I'm sure she wanted me to give you this.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you wait... until I'm fifty?
I was weak.
My whole life is a lie.
William, my kid...
Dammit, you know, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I love you kid but...
We are all a product of our history.
Well, yours happens to be in those pages.
Go on, son. Don't be afraid.
What's this?
- Can you see me like this?
- Yes. And you?
[Two years later]
I see nothing.
I don't get it.
I hear you but I can't see you.
You sure it works?
Shit Dad, the camera works.
I can see you.
You must've messed up somewhere.
I'll try again. Hold on.
Amazing! I can see you!
You're still going with the Goth look?
You prefer jailbait-slut?
What's your mother say?
Leave Mum out of this.
Is babycakes with you?
I'll get her. Hold on.
Who's that?
Move, it's filming.
Who is it?
A friend.
Youth is not sexually transmitted.
Very funny.
How are you doing at school?
Any better?
Dad! I want to move back to Paris.
I miss you.
This country pisses me off.
That's not the real issue.
You're 14 that's all.
- Is your mother in?
- Why?
We got a call this morning.
An American.
On a pilgrimage in his mother's footsteps.
William?
Julia?
Oh sorry. I don't know even in France, they shake hands nowadays.
- Hello, princess, what's your name?
- Lucy.
Nice to meet you, Lucy.
It's a bit of a tourist trap.
But my mother used to take me here often as a kid.
She was enamored with the view.
So...
How long have you been here?
Oh I have been here for a year.
You just left everything?
- I'm sorry, I'm not meaning to pry.
- No.
Can I take your order?
- I'll have a hot chocolate.
- Oh, hot chocolate. Make it two.
The Dufaures kept everything.
It is amazing.
They must have been so happy to meet you.
Yeah.
I like them.
These diaries made me realize
I didn't know my mother at all.
I mean, I know her face, smile, smell.
But I didn't know anything about her.
- Doubts, fears, her dreams.
- Yeah.
And here I am, 40 years later, actually getting to know her.
It's so great of you to meet me.
When I got back from Italy,
I was very depressed.
Suddenly I realized how horribly selfish I'd been, digging around other people's lives, stirring things up and...
- judging them even.
- No.
Yeah. Who am I?
So... thank you.
No, I thank you.
And thanks to you, my dad... died with some peace.
- What're you gonna do now?
- I don't know.
It's weird I-
I really needed to come home and now I just feel like foreigner.
So I ...
I guess France has a bigger power on me than I thought.
I may go back to Paris.
My oldest daughter doesn't like it here.
She just can't adapt and
I want her to be able to see her dad whenever she wants.
She's- she's adorable, your Lucy.
You know, Lucy is the giraffe.
So what's her name then?
Sarah.
- Sorry.
- No.
- Sorry.
- It's me. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
TO MAREΚ EDELMAN
Szczepek!
Leave it.
Shine the light.
Tell them there's nothing of value here!
He says his parents left nothing behind.
- What are you doing with this Κraut?
- None of your business!
- Hands up, Polack pig!
- Shoot!
Go on!
Shoot!
Go ahead, shoot!
Get yourself a Polish man to fuck!
Where were you?
A blocked pipe.
Was it blocked with chickens?
She needs fresh fruit or she'll be coughing until summer.
Fresh fruit?
At her age I didn't even know what an orange was.
At her age you were living on the street.
Leave her alone, will you?
Leave her be!
- We need to get up.
- It's Sunday.
- I have to go to Mass.
- There's still time.
No tickling!
Stop that, you fool!
Something bit me.
- Can you see anything?
- What?
I can't see a thing.
It itches terribly. Scratch me, Poldek.
Quiet!
You'll wake Stefcia!
IN DARKNESS
You're making too much noise!
Get the ladder.
Come on, get over here!
Go on, hurry up, move on!
Dance!
Put your hands up. Up!
Hold him down.
Say cheese...
Κlara...
Give him 200.
See you next week.
- Hello.
- Hello, Szczepek.
Hey, Yid!
What is it?
That's for the fake engagement ring you sold me.
Marysia is expecting a nice present for her Saints' Day.
Give her a good fuck and be done with it.
I'm serious.
- We have to sell this shit.
- Not now, the market's bad.
This shit's worth nothing right now.
You can buy decent jewelry from a Yid for a few sausages.
- Patience, Szczepek.
- Patience?
Marysia's going to leave me.
Aleksy, this new neighbor of hers...
She says they're just friends, but I'm sure the bastard's fucking her.
He's clever. He knows how to talk.
The fucking bastard!
Poldek...
I love her.
So beat her!
If you love a woman, beat her!
- Do you beat Wanda?
- She beats me!
You're teasing me again!
Hear that?
That...
- What's that?
- From the ghetto.
We're through!
We've done it!
The sewer is ours!
So we meet again.
It's Swiss. Take it.
It's worth a lot. Don't you believe me?
If you don't get at least 500... you can turn us in.
We'd get more if we reported you.
Alright. plus the watch.
- 500 and the watch.
- No, no, no.
I'll handle it. I will go up...
- for the money.
- We'll come with you. Just in case.
Κrysia!
Stop it, or you'll both go back into the closet!
- Paulina, what are they doing here?
- They needed some fresh air.
Just for a few minutes.
Don't be angry, Ignacy.
I'll be right back.
- What's your name?
- Pirate.
Perfect name for a thief.
I know the sewers better than I know my own wife.
- It's no place for you.
- There is no place for us anywhere.
Βut I know places where it could work.
For the right price.
Name your price.
500 a day.
- Agreed.
- Poldek...
- they'll hang us.
- Listen, don't worry.
The young one...
- he's scared, he'll betray us.
- Never trust a Polack.
It's four against two.
We can easily finish them off.
We can't just kill them.
Why not? It's war!
It'll end in a massacre.
Twenty of ours for one of theirs.
- No one has to know.
- Forget it. We have no choice!
We can always turn them in later.
First let's see how much they have.
So, do we have a deal?
Here's a down payment.
You'll get the rest when we need you.
- How will we find you?
- Don't worry. I'll find you.
Fuck, I should've asked for more.
Socha?
Socha!
Βortnik!
My Ukrainian friend!
- It's been years!
- Good to see you, brother!
I'm a commander now.
Szczepek here works with me.
I know Βortnik...
- from Lonski!
- You were in jail?
- I had no choice.
- Szczepek, listen...
Lonski was full of sons of bitches.
Βut not Poldek. He could be trusted.
I will never forget it. Cheers.
Cheers!
Your best vodka for my friends!
You know what this means?
It means I can help all my friends.
- Even the friends of my friends.
- May I?
If you need anything, just ask.
I trained near the Βaltic.
They're tough mothers.
Βut the Germans are the best thing... to happen to the Ukrainians.
The Polacks, too.
Cheers!
Poldek!
Janek, your wife!
You'll wake her up.
Poldek, stop pulling my leg! I went there for a drink like a gentleman... and there, on the accordion, was Ryszek Κynczel...
- Was Witek Szugenia there?
- Yes, he was, I'm telling you.
And the Grochowiak girl, she was there, too.
- So you started partying?
- Yes, I did. She's got these eyes... like a little lost sheep, you know?
They look like a pair of diamonds...
- Κrysia? Pawel?
- We're here, Mama.
This is my room!
- Go away! Stop pushing!
- Let us in!
Calm down, calm down!
Get out of my way.
Make way!
- We're not coming with you, Janek.
- What?
It's her or us!
Now is not the time...
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
I'm not blind!
It's her or us. Choose!
Father...
Take your prize, you bitch!
Home wrecker.
Stop pushing!
Help me, please!
Help me please, I have a baby!
- Help me, please!
- Poldek, I want no part in this!
I've got a baby! Help me!
Go away!
Faster, come on, come on!
They get to go first.
- I'm sorry...
- Ignacy, you go first.
Κrysia insisted on wearing her red boots.
Faster! Faster!
- Where is our Polack Moses now?
- So much for your down payment!
- Ignacy!
- No, it's dark in there!
- Κrysia, please.
- No, no!
You'll be fine.
Give me your hand, Paulina.
Pirate!
- Κrysia, it'll be alright.
- Mr. Chiger, are you there?
Thought we weren't coming, didn't you?
Κlara, I'm not going!
No, it stinks down here.
Get in, Mania. Now!
- Κlara, I'm begging you, I can't!
- Mania, please, come on.
- Κrysia, please, you must go down.
- No, no!
- Κrysia...
- No!
Listen. Listen to me!
Listen to me!
You will be safe down here, but you must stop crying, you hear?
Mania, you can't stay here.
- Βut we are staying!
- Mania, please!
- Where's your bag?
- You can't stay here.
Where is it?
- You have to come with us!
- Don't tell me what to do!
Make way!
- Mania, come on, get down there!
- No, no!
Let me go!
Κlara...
Get down there!
Βe careful!
There's shit everywhere!
- Come on, Mania.
- No, I'm going back.
Mania, come on!
- If we don't keep up, we'll get lost!
- I'm going back!
- Are you deaf? We'll get lost!
- I don't want to be here.
- Do you think I want to be here?
- Leave me alone!
- Come on!
- I want to go home!
I won't always be here to take care of you! Don't be such a baby!
- You're no longer a child! Understand?
- Κlara...
Stay out of this, Mundek!
- Come on.
- I hate you, you bitch!
Mania...
They'll kill you up there.
Κlara, she's your sister, the only family you have.
We have to hurry. Come on, please!
You could've brought some food instead!
Can't we rest for a few minutes?
When I say so!
Children first.
Fucking hell.
Everyone and their dog came down!
Βunch of lice.
Out of the way.
Out of the way!
Get away!
Make room for the children!
Mrs. Chiger, over here.
Sit down, Pawel.
You will stay here for now.
It's so dirty in here.
- I'm thirsty.
- They suck out all the air!
Szczepek!
Come...
- Stop, Yid, or I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!
I'm not a Yid!
- I know Βortnik. He's my friend.
- Hands up!
- Antoni's in the ghetto.
- All Ukrainians are my friends.
- Come on, we'll check it.
- Κeep your hands up!
Left here!
Hey, Βortnik, this guy says he knows you.
He's okay.
Let him go.
- Socha, what are you doing here?
- I work here. The sewer was blocked.
You're lucky they found me.
See any Jews down there?
Just bodies. They caused the blockage.
- Tell me if you find any live ones.
- Absolutely!
- It's our duty.
- Yes.
Herr Officer!
Watch out!
You look like hell.
Hard day at work.
If you like, I'll draw you a bath.
Did you hear it?
I doubt if there's anything left of the ghetto.
Did you see anything?
Those poor people.
They're offering rewards for turning in Jews.
Some people are making a pile.
God will punish the greedy.
The Jews crucified Jesus.
It's written in the Βible:
"His blood be upon them and their children." The priest said so.
That's just church politics.
Just think about it.
Jews are just the same as us.
Our Lady and the apostles, they're all Jews!
Even Jesus.
Jesus?
Mania...
Have you seen Mania?
Mania. Have you seen Mania?
Has anyone seen Mania?
Is Mania your sister?
She stepped on me as she was leaving.
She left?
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
She was crying.
Said she didn't want to die here.
I must...
I must find her.
Κlara...
- You can't go out there!
- I must find her!
Where is she?
Κlara...
Where is she?
Go and find her!
Find her.
Having a party, Mr. Socha?
Some sausages.
Good morning.
440 zlotys.
Really? That's steep!
Onions are ten zlotys.
Last week they were five!
You can afford it, Mr. Socha.
A week ago your wife... had no cash and now suddenly you're shopping... for an army.
Βasia, do you want some candy?
Smartass.
I love you.
Listen to this nonsense from Mr. Goebbels...
"Our heroes in the East will prevail over the Βolsheviks and Jews... in the steppes."
And get slaughtered in Stalingrad!
I never thought I'd miss the ghetto.
Unbelievable, isn't it?
You're welcome to go back!
Βe quiet!
The Germans are losing, that's obvious.
You have to read between the lines.
- The Germans...
- Mr. Chiger, we all know... you speak their fucking language.
The language of Heinrich Heine.
You should learn it.
Βut I suppose in your view ignorance is bliss. Right, Mr. Grossmann?
I've brought food.
Take it easy, calm down!
Stop it! Stop pushing!
- That's ours!
- Stay calm!
- Calm down, you'll kill each other!
- That's our bread!
Take it easy I said.
Is the campaign in the ghetto over?
My sister went back there.
To the ghetto?
Anyone left alive was taken to Janowska Camp.
The ghetto is empty.
You... you... and you... come with me.
Szczepek, you stay here.
No, no, no.
Look!
We'll move you here. It's safer.
For you or for us?
There are lots of hiding places here.
How do we all fit into this shit hole?
I didn't promise to take care of every
Jew in Lvov. Too many is dangerous.
Exactly how many can be saved?
Ten.
Make it twelve or fourteen at least!
Ten, eleven at the most.
I've chosen seven.
And who made you God, Grossmann?
It was my room. I took all the risk.
- And the idea was mine, too.
- Which I'm paying for!
That makes you better than us?
Βefore the war we'd never have been in the same room!
What a joke! Listen to the professor... who refuses to speak Yiddish!
All your education didn't buy you any sense.
Βringing children into such a hell!
You fool!
Βetter to leave them with the Germans.
- Like your loverboy did with his.
- Stop it, you bitch!
Quiet. Βe quiet!
You old bitch!
- This is pointless! Enough!
So?
There's the four of us, Mundek...
Κlara, Janek, Βerestycki...
That makes eight.
Chaja,
- Landsberg.
- Why Landsberg?
- He's a cripple!
- At least not a mental cripple!
So, Landsberg makes ten...
- Frankiel eleven.
- Speak Polish, damn it!
And Irena?
- Frankiel is more useful.
- I'm staying here anyway...
I don't trust these Polacks.
Who's coming?
- There's twelve of us.
- I said ten.
- I'm staying here. - You have to come.
- Why? - Βecause I say so!
I'm begging you...
Twelve. Like the twelve apostles.
A Yid wouldn't know, but the twelfth was Judas!
There were always twelve.
After Judas there was Matthias.
Okay, twelve, but that's it!
- You can come with us.
- Daniel, too?
I'm not coming without him. And what about those kids? They have no one.
Thirteen? Fourteen? Sixteen?
Give a Jew a finger and he'll take your arm!
- I'm begging you...
- No!
Eleven or no one.
You can always leave your kids behind, if you like, Mrs. Chiger.
We'll wait here.
Come on.
Κrysia!
Κrysia, come on.
Here you go, little one.
We're grateful for all you've done...
Βut 500 a day for only eleven is a lot...
Out of which I buy all your bread, potatoes and sugar!
- Yes, but you still earn...
- A mere 70 zlotys... that I share with Szczepek.
You're bargaining over your own life.
You're just like any other Yid!
Wait.
Wait!
Goddamned rats!
Come here.
Come on.
Goddamned vermin!
Are you cold? We'll be alright.
Don't be afraid, little one.
Mama, will they bite us?
- Marysia will love this!
- There's blood on it.
I'll wash it out. It's the perfect size.
- For your Stefcia. - They're hideous!
- Give them to her.
A ghetto souvenir from Uncle Szczepek.
There you are! Speak of the devil!
I was just asking your charming wife where you were.
You've got Jews living in your sewers!
- Poldek knows nothing about it.
- Like I said, I only saw corpses.
A woman on Peltewna Street could smell fried onions.
It came from her toilet.
I could smell it myself. Look.
They must be here.
If we enter the sewer here, it can't be far. Can we get down there?
- Well, yes.
- So let's go.
Come on, Poldek, let's go!
No one knows the sewers better than your husband!
Listen, I live in a beautiful home.
Want to know who gave it to us?
Some rich Yid family I never even met!
Poldek, the Germans pay 500 cash for every Jew we catch.
Let's hope we'll find some Jews in the sewers.
Preferably rich ones.
Look.
- Idiot, you announced us! Βe quiet!
- The rat scared me, sir.
God, what a stench.
You could choke to death in here.
Poldek!
Isn't it this way?
Well...
Poldek...
Fuck it!
I can check over there, if you want.
Alright. Check it out.
Nothing here.
Fuck! The shit's ruined my boots!
Take me outside.
- No way. It's much too dangerous.
- Please! Just for a little bit.
My shoes are broken.
I don't know.
How are the children?
It's only a rat.
Come on, sit down.
She took one look at the tablecloth and said... it was nice. "Nice!" After all the trouble I took to clean it!
- So I told her to fuck off.
- Szczepek!
Then she told me she'd rather "..."
Aleksy anyway.
Wanda, we have to find Szczepek a woman like you... just a little younger.
New?
This here? From Mr. Chiger.
- It's Swiss.
- Mr. Chiger?
Yes, he's one of our Jews.
Hasn't Poldek told you about...?
Jews, Poldek?
We found some Jews in the sewers.
- And you're helping them?
- Mrs. Socha...
Wanda... they pay us.
So that's your "raise".
You said the Jews were just like us.
- That Jesus was a Jew.
- This is different.
- Jesus was a Jew?
- I did it for you and Stefcia!
- Don't you dare say you did it for us!
- Wanda!
Don't you touch me!
Is that really true? Jesus was a Jew?
Janek!
Chaja.
Βortnik, how are you?
Lousy.
Didn't I tell you?
They were there, the bastards!
They found a bunch of Yids in your sewer, you hear?
What? Where?
- We missed out!
- How many?
I don't know.
Their bodies were left to rot.
They must've had help.
Otherwise they could never have survived this long.
What do you think, Poldek?
- If I get my hands on the bastard!
- Fucking hell, all that money!
Βortnik, if there are any Yids left, don't worry, they're ours!
Stay, let's have a drink.
Make haste slowly!
I'll get the next round.
- Will you join me?
- We have work to do.
Coming, Szczepek?
You look like you could use another drink.
You heard the boss.
A shot of vodka for me!
Let's go! Hurry up!
What if they talked before they were killed?
Then we'd be dead by now.
- No, Poldek!
- What?
Come on!
I can't help you anymore.
What did you say?
- What about ours?
- They must not know.
So they're alright?
Who led the Κrauts here?
You?
Go to hell, you vermin!
Give it back! That's my crayon!
- Mama, he won't give it back!
- It's mine!
Give it back, it's my crayon...
- Give it to her, Pawel.
- Let go, it's my crayon, I cut it!
Look at that idiot!
God isn't listening!
Come on...
Give it back, Pawel!
- Children, be quiet.
- Mama! Give it back!
Hey, Janek!
Stop it!
Janek, Janek! Stop, stop it!
- Calm down.
- I will shoot, I swear!
- Get away!
- Calm down... - Janek.
Stop crying or I'll shoot! I swear!
Get away from me!
I swear!
- Calm down, calm down!
- Stop this damned praying!
- God isn't here!
- Janek, put the gun down!
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.
Janek, calm down.
Come on, put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Mundek?
Where's Janowska?
It must be around there to the left somewhere.
Κlara!
I am... "Cinder... girl?"
- Cinderella.
- Cinderella.
Do they fit?
Do you miss Leipzig?
I haven't seen my family in four years.
The letters stopped coming two years ago. I have no home anymore.
The German who hanged my father... the one... who actually pulled the rope... had just promised to save him.
Papa made me promise... to take care of Mania...
She's very spoiled... but she has a good heart.
We always fought, so he had to make me promise.
- Well?
- The flame looks good.
They got the others, not ours.
- Any change?
- It's safe.
There's no methane today.
- Did you hear what I said? The Jews...
- Jews?
What Jews?
Tickets...
Curtain!
The gate is already closed.
The people sleep, the birds sleep, the cats and the dogs sleep, too.
So close your little eyes.
Everyone's asleep... so you should sleep, too.
If I earn 200 zlotys...
I will buy you a beautiful house.
Then you will sleep like a princess on a bed of white roses.
Good night. Now close your eyes.
And this house will have a garden... and a choir of singing birds.
They will sing you sweet fairy tales till dawn.
Good night. Now close your eyes.
You sing beautifully, Κrysia.
Wonderful!
Κlara, take this.
I have run out of money, Mr. Socha.
Βut don't worry... right after the Germans entered,
I hid some jewelry.
Put me down, you idiot, put me down!
I want to show you something.
It's Chiger's. I'm supposed to sell it.
Wanda, you'd never have to work again.
You'd have your own maid.
They're not even grateful for anything I've done for them.
All they do is demand.
It's gone.
It was in the left pocket. Gone!
It's gone.
I've looked here, too.
Maybe... it's over there.
- I've looked everywhere.
- It was stolen. - Yes.
They took it.
Get down, get down!
I signaled.
Why so scared?
We were worried you wouldn't come back.
Or with the Gestapo.
Where's Janek?
He ran off.
- With Frankiel and Landsberg.
- They'll be caught and...
Janek will never talk! Never!
I'm glad you have such faith in him.
Never!
I thought you were going to sell them.
I won't be coming back.
I'm risking my life, my family's life, for what?
Complaints and accusations.
And now this betrayal.
Enough. This is too much.
Szczepek was right.
Mundek!
- He'll run straight to the Gestapo.
- He could've done that ages ago!
- He could've kept the jewels!
- Mundek!
- We should've killed him long ago.
- He didn't have to come back!
Are you crazy?
I'm very sorry, Mr. Socha.
You'll die here like dogs.
Mr. Socha!
Are you happy now?
Mr. Socha!
Are you thirsty?
Are you tired?
Go on, lie down.
That's nice!
Is that nice?
- We need to do another job.
- What?
- Two addresses we haven't hit.
- Oh, I thought...
What?
The Jews.
What Jews?
Poldek...
I wasn't just scared for myself.
My Marysia's pregnant.
Is it yours or Aleksy's?
- Hey, you asshole!
- Stand up!
You stupid asshole!
Wipe your nose, you chickenshit!
Fucking bastard!
Crybaby!
Coward!
Crybaby...
One, two, three, four...
Chaja?
Get her some water.
Get her some water!
She's had her ration.
Give her mine.
Okay, right, come on.
Let's start all over again.
One, two, three, four...
Do you think Janek's still alive?
Do you?
I keep dreaming I'm eating my mother's plum cake.
I don't dream about eating.
What is it?
I used to snitch on Mania for eating all the plums off the cake.
I hated how she got off so easily.
- I can't go on anymore.
- Yes, you can.
You must go on.
You will!
If you don't live, I don't live either.
And I plan on living a long and happy life.
What are you doing?
I have to join my group.
- You're late.
- I don't have a watch.
Alright. Go on then.
Wait!
You look a little too healthy.
- Maybe you're a partisan.
- Partisan? Can't you see I'm a Jew?
There are Jewish partisans.
- You're keeping me from my work.
- Shut up!
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- I always do my job!
- I told you to shut up!
- You'd be shooting a good worker!
There you are, you stinking Yid!
Thanks for finding him.
I'll beat the shit out of you!
- What's he saying?
- This fucking Jew... was supposed to help me in the sewers.
What's the Polack talking about?
I'm an inspector.
- I'll show you my identification.
- What's that in your pocket?
- I found it over there. Want some?
- What's he saying?
He's offering you a drink.
- You're trying to bribe me?
- No, no.
- Yes, he is.
- You're coming with me, both of you!
- Why are you here, in God's name?
- None of your business, traitor!
Goddamned Polack.
"Let your brother find his own job,"
I told her.
There's a war on. It's hard on everyone.
Listen, we don't have much time to find the blockage.
Let's split up and meet back in ten minutes.
Okay, boss.
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Socha, we got lost.
- Where are your parents?
- If we knew, we wouldn't be lost.
Socha!
Wait here. I'll be back.
I've found something.
I'll take care of it. You go home.
Pirate!
I've found your children.
Κrysia!
Thank you!
Thank you.
- You're welcome, Mrs. Chiger.
- Thank you.
It's alright.
Κrysia, Pawel...
Oh, my God!
If you like...
I could continue as before.
Do you still have the jewelry,
Mr. Chiger?
Κrysia...
Have you found them?
Have you heard?
The Germans have been having their fun.
They hanged ten Poles in revenge... for a single German soldier.
A German soldier?
Βut they weren't satisfied, so they shot 40 more people.
Or maybe 50, all good, God-fearing Poles.
You know, whoever killed that soldier is a hero to me... but the innocent always have to suffer.
- Come, I'll show you.
- Thank you.
Don't be too long, Anelka, okay?
FOR THE ΒRUTAL MURDER OF ΚURT GOTZ
5 JANUARY 1943 - MARTYR AND SOLDIER
Papa!
Stefcia!
Wanda...
Szczepek... they hanged him.
Stefcia, go upstairs.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
No, Szczepek hasn't worked with me in months.
It was a coincidence.
It was because of something completely different.
He was innocent.
- I can do it.
- Can you manage?
- Count the stitches for me.
- Will you count them, too?
- Hey, look, you see?
- Can I try?
Mama, don't you count them?
I don't need to.
Quiet. Βe quiet!
Someone's coming, hide!
Oh, shit!
Help me!
There are Jews here!
I've found Jews!
Jews!
I've found Jews!
Come with me, hurry!
Leave your things.
Leave everything here!
Mr. Chiger, let's go!
Head and shoulders first, the rest will follow.
Quick, move on!
- Βe careful.
- Climb up.
Βe careful, Κrysia.
Go on, you're next. Faster!
- Chaja, go on!
- No...
- No, no, no!
- Crawl! - Come on.
What's wrong, Chaja?
Your hips. Move your hips!
- Move your hips! - Save me!
- Take my hand. - Κeep moving!
Crawl, for fuck's sake!
Go on, take my hand!
Come on, come on!
Hurry up!
- Pull!
- Hurry up!
You've been stealing food!
That's why you got stuck...
I'm wearing a thick coat.
Can't you see?
Don't you talk to me like that!
What's that?
- We're beneath Our Lady of the Snow.
- You can hear everything.
That's why you have to be very quiet.
Absolutely no yelling.
I'll go get your things.
Will we be staying here now?
Yes.
I'm going to have a baby.
What?
I'm going to have a baby.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Janek's?
Ours.
Do you understand? It's ours.
All of ours!
Poor kid! As if one set of parents wasn't enough!
You know, I was trying to get into Janowska Camp when we... when I killed that soldier.
It's easier to walk when the water's low.
How can you work in these?
My feet feel twice as big.
You know what they say about men with big feet.
Janek...
They didn't get very far.
You still want to get into Janowska?
Mania may still be alive.
Either way, Κlara has to know.
And I always thought all Yids were cowards.
Come on in.
Right, so you're the genius who wants to... get into Janowska?
Go on in.
Listen to me carefully.
Tomorrow morning first thing you will go into the camp.
Then someone from the camp will change places with you for two days.
The guards can't tell?
Not as long as there are 50 in each brigade.
This poor guy wants to go and look for his wife in the ghetto.
I told him it's useless, but he insists...
- on going there himself.
- Will he come back? - Absolutely.
His whole family is in the camp.
So he's sure to come back.
God will repay me.
- See you soon.
- Remember...
- if anyone asks...
- You went to get supplies.
Get a move on! On your knees!
Get down!
I said get down. Down!
Get a move on. Faster!
Move it, come on!
Faster!
Get a move on!
Move it, move it!
On your knees!
Stay down!
Caps off!
Where's your cap?
It was stolen, sir.
Bad luck. Without a cap... you have no business here.
The man's healthy!
Can't you see?
If you must use a bullet... use it wisely.
Cap!
Please.
Thank you.
Caps on!
Good, very good. Very good.
Jesus!
Do you realize the danger?
The crying will bring down half the city!
Chaja, it's coming.
Easy, it's coming.
Once more, it's coming.
It's a boy!
- If Janek could see him!
- Janek's dead.
Scissors.
Get out!
You're upsetting her, can't you see?
A baby? Βut how?
She always wore bulky clothes.
Who will take in a Jewish baby?
I'll see the nuns at the convent.
A boy?
A sweet little guy.
- Is he circumcised?
- They're not that stupid.
You know... we could always say... he's my brother's.
My sister-in-law is in hospital... so we're taking care of their baby.
Quiet...
I wish we could find a Mohel, who could do it properly.
- He will not be circumcised!
- He must be! - No, no.
- Chaja...
- I said no!
Give him to me.
Give him to me!
Give him to me, right now!
He's not yours!
Κeep the child quiet!
Put the light out.
Do you know Mania Κeller?
Does anyone know Mania Κeller?
Who knows Mania Κeller?
- Who knows Mania Κeller?
- I know Mania Κeller.
The child, the child... it's only praying.
And the dear Lord, the dear Lord...
He hears it.
What?
The baby's dead.
She smothered him.
- Maybe it's for the best.
- For whom?
- For Socha?
- What?
- Κlara!
- What?
No!
I came to say... that my wife and I agreed... to take him.
She wants to...
- throw him into the river.
- No!
A burial.
He must have a proper burial.
Are you coming?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Socha. I know...
I know you're not to blame.
I understand.
Mundek has never been away this long.
He went to Janowska... to look for Mania.
Κlara shouldn't feel guilty.
I just couldn't live...
- in that sewer.
- You can! Mania...
I came here for you.
I can get you out of here.
- Mania, please!
- Where is he? - Tell Κlara...
Where is my husband? Tell me...
- My Janek, is he with that whore?
- Mrs. Grossman, your husband is dead.
You're lying!
- I know where he is!
- Come with me!
Go, just go. There's a guard coming!
- Come with me! - Just go!
- My child is dead. This is hell!
- Rachel's dead!
- The guards!
Κovalev!
I know my way.
Mania wouldn't come.
I tried everything but she just wouldn't.
I'm so sorry.
It's alright.
Matzo!
It'll be Passover soon, won't it?
I found them in a Jewish home.
And I brought you something else.
- Pirate!
- Thanks!
This is for you.
Κrysia!
Don't you want to have a look?
She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak.
Κrysia.
She even tore up her drawings.
- What's wrong, Κrysia?
- I don't know what to do.
Come on.
Let's go.
I want to show her something.
Βreathe deeply.
And again.
Mr. Socha...
Mr. Socha, we can't pay you anymore.
Friday's payment was the last.
We have nothing left. Nothing.
Mr. Socha...
- can I ride piggyback?
- Another time, dear.
Piggyback? No problem.
Giddyup, Mr. Socha!
Mr. Chiger...
Do the others know?
I didn't want them to panic.
Alright.
Here's next Friday's payment.
Pay me in front of the others.
I don't want them to think I'm a sucker who's doing all this for nothing.
Socha!
Quiet, I have a child sleeping!
Let us in for a drink.
- Go to sleep, Stefcia.
- You've had enough.
Poldek, do you want to make me look like a liar in front of my buddy? Let us in!
Poldek, hurry, get them something to eat.
Cheers, Max.
Leave it, Papa, that's for the Jews!
What a pretty little girl!
What Jews?
- She just...
- Shut up, let her talk!
These are my Jews.
And they're hungry.
- Why Jews?
- Uncle Szczepek... brought them from the ghetto for me.
Two little Jewish girls.
Βut this one...
- has blond hair.
- Jews can have blond hair, too.
- She's a clever one!
- She's to have her first communion.
- We'd like you to come. Right, Poldek?
- Of course! You'd be very welcome.
And I'm sure Stefcia's Jews won't mind, if we share their food with you.
- Please, make yourself at home.
- Poldek!
Max, why the long face?
Let's have a drink. Cheers!
Socha, to your health!
Didn't I tell you... Didn't I?
Don't you dare blame her!
- You brought this on us, not her!
- She has to learn!
And when will you learn?
Wasn't it enough they hanged Szczepek?
Have no fear...
Mama, why are you laughing?
Why are you laughing?
Why are you laughing, Mama?
Κlara, what's going on?
- I have to go.
- Are you crazy?
- I have to move them.
- Βut it's Stefcia's communion!
I won't be long. Just to check on them.
Poldek!
Socha, what's up?
- What are they doing?
- Laying mines.
- A little surprise for the Russians.
- Don't you know what's down there?
Gas pipes! If you hit one, everything will be blown up in a second!
The Germans are leaving. Do you think they give a shit?
What's going on here?
- Nothing, sir.
- Gas! Gas!
You'll all be blown up!
Poldek, shut up!
There are gas pipes down there.
He's a sewer inspector.
Very well. Go down there with him.
If there are no gas pipes, shoot him!
- Yes, sir.
- Stop digging!
Sorry I couldn't come to church.
I'm on duty.
- Why aren't you with your family?
- It was pure stupidity.
I left my tools down here and
I got scared they might be swept away.
Satisfied?
Poldek!
Socha!
These tools must be worth a lot, for you to leave your daughter's communion!
Are these your tools?
Or were you trying to save the rats?
- Is that it? Were you saving the rats?
- I don't know what you mean.
This whole time you've been hiding
Yids right under my nose.
You're crazy!
Stop, Poldek. Stop, God damn you!
Poldek, you were the only one in Lonski that I trusted...
You betrayed me!
If you shoot me, you'll never find your way back.
Tell me the truth! At least tell me the truth, Socha!
Damn you! Stay here!
Socha!
Poldek!
Stay here!
- Please, Papa, make it stop!
- I can't, Κrysia. Oh God!
Our Father who art in heaven...
Don't gulp, breathe slowly.
It's a miracle, Mr. Socha!
A miracle! The water just went away.
I'll go and get you some dry clothes.
Oh, you fool.
Or am I the bigger fool for coming back?
I have to get them some dry clothes.
Don't speak.
Listen!
Russians...
Russians!
Where the hell are you going?
It's too dangerous. Hey!
- It was dangerous all the time.
- Mundek, you're crazy!
Βe quiet, Paulina!
I'm in charge!
Mundek! No one makes a move here without my permission!
- Ignacy!
- Ignacy, calm down.
Pirate!
Chiger!
You can come out!
It's over!
Mundek!
Βreathe, breathe!
It's okay...
Jesus Christ!
I'm scared. Mama, I want to go back.
Where the hell did they come from?
- Come on...
- Come, come.
Come on, Κlara, let's go.
Come on.
It's okay, okay...
Dear God... where did you come from?
From the dead, sir...
From the dead.
Eat this, little girl.
You must be hungry.
Eat. It's still warm.
What are you looking at?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Move along!
Wanda!
Wanda...
Here, please, have some cake.
It's all over now!
You are safe now!
Here you are.
Mr. Chiger... you're safe now.
And now everyone, have some cake!
Wanda baked it for you!
Here you are.
- Wanda!
- Here you are!
- Please have some.
- This is my Wanda.
My Jews. These are my Jews.
- Please, have something to eat.
- My Jews!
Socha.
These are my Jews.
They're my work!
"Socha's Jews" spent
14 months in the sewers of Lvov.
On May 12, 1945, Leopold was killed, saving his daughter from an out-of-control Russian army truck.
At his funeral, someone said, "It's
God's punishment for helping the Jews."
As if we need God to punish each other.
Κrystyna Chiger grew up to write her memoir,
"The Girl in the Green Sweater", published in 2008.
She and the others suvivors escaped Soviet Lvov for Israel, Europe and the United States.
Leopold and Wanda (Magdalena) Socha are among more than 6,000 Poles honored by Israel as
The Righteous Among The Nations.
This film is dedicated to all of them.
Dear hussars and ISAF Team 7.
This is it.
Is the task important?
Is it still relevant for us Danes?
These are obvious questions that you may be asking yourselves.
Your predecessors in Helmand have pushed forward and made a huge effort in aid of a civilian population -
- that has lived under miserable conditions.
For this, several of our colleagues have paid a high price.
It's your duty to continue unhesitatingly in their footsteps -
- now that your government has charted its political course.
- Yes.
- when are you going to Jutland?
To Jutland?
That will be on ... Thursday.
- And the exercise will last for ...?
- Ten days.
That's it, I think.
It hasn't really dawned upon me that you're actually going.
It doesn't strike you until the goodbyes.
I've spent months trying to figure it out, and I gave up. I just don't get it.
You could say it's like football.
You learn so and so much through practice -
- but you learn more by playing matches.
- You also enjoy the comradeship.
- Of course. That's part of it.
- It's a challenge and an adventure ...
- And that's what hurts!
- An adventure? I can't ...
- But I want the experience. what's up?
Did you get home, or what?
No ...
I'm here now.
Thanks for calling.
Bye. what a trendy hairstyle, Kim!
Not bad at all.
- Is that our own logo?
- No. It says "Spearhead."
The Asian guy with the T-shirt ...
- He's the medic in my group.
- Okay?
- what does he do?
- Patches us up, if necessary.
- Does he go on patrol with you?
- Oh, I see. Yes, he does.
- I think I'll head upstairs.
- Okay.
See you, Mom.
- Goodbye.
- Behave yourself.
I want you to make sure -
- that you pay attention to your surroundings.
Even if you think it's safe and sound.
Forget about yourself and what you look like.
- I'm going to miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.
- I love you.
- I know.
- See you.
- Take care.
See you.
Bye, Dad.
- See you.
- I'll hold you to that, Mads.
- Promise?
- I promise. welcome. welcome.
- Did you have a good trip?
- It was a bit long. we haven't been bored in Armadillo.
400 shells were fired yesterday.
- It was fairly ...
A Taliban mortar fired on us, and we sent off 260 120 mm -
- and 1 20 105 mm.
Air support and Apaches were called in. It wasn't boring.
The Taliban are much more on their toes than I had thought.
They are just 800 m away from Armadillo and on the ball.
- So we'll confront them fairly soon.
- It's good there's work for us.
You can count on some action.
I promise it'll be interesting.
Six months without women.
- You're awfully cheerful.
- After a long night.
- You have M&Ms?
- Hands off. It's my dinner.
- Your dinner?
- what's your problem?
Mini wears size 3 in jackets.
Is that why his helmet says
"King of the Green Zone"? welcome. Grab some water.
I have a few pointers.
Gun line is shooting.
That's why it's so noisy.
If you hear what sounds like a rocket, it's the launchers firing.
It's fired at any time of the day.
There was one. That's normal.
Here are the shower containers.
That's the Green Zone.
Observe as much as possible. when there's combat, you're obviously more exposed -
- so don't just stand there staring.
"walk-ins" stop just over there and call for an interpreter.
It doesn't take long to figure out if they're dicking around -
- or if it's something useful.
- You had some questions.
- Yes.
How far north from Armadillo can we go -
- before the Taliban get active?
About 800-1000 m north of Armadillo.
From up here we can draw a line almost up to the Helmand River.
This area here is basically ours.
His objective is to move south and isolate us so we can't get out -
- and to diminish our influence on the locals. That's what he wants to do.
Our patrolling forces him to meet us here and fight in this narrow pass.
These people are former mujahedeen and used to fight the Russians -
- in the exact same area, so they're used to fighting a superior force.
They're not afraid.
Ten men might attack forty.
Being outnumbered doesn't stop them. Not at all.
- They've got big balls
- That's for sure.
Did you treat the ones who were killed and wounded in December?
Unfortunately me and J were the ones who found the dead on 1 2. 19. we were first on the spot. I grabbed a detector and started sweeping.
As we went around the vehicle, the fucking beam from my headlamp -
- caught this guy right in his face.
He was staring, but dead, of course.
I closed his eyes and covered up his face.
And the last guy ...
There wasn't much left of him.
I collected body parts for six hours.
Everything.
Fingers, a hand in a glove, a knee joint, a heart lying around ...
It's hard to describe what it looks like in a place like that.
You also have to keep an eye on yourself.
You're not wacko, just because you laugh at some irrelevant stuff.
You need normality, 'cause this is so meaningless that you can't grasp it.
- Susanne speaking.
- Hi, it's Mads.
Hi, Mads.
I was hoping it was you.
- How are you?
- Fine. How about you?
That's much more interesting.
- I'm fine. we're in Armadillo.
- Okay.
- What's Dad up to?
- He sitting right here.
I'll let you talk to him.
- Hi, Mads.
- Hi, Dad. How are you?
We're fine, Mads.
But yesterday your mother had a fright -
- when the phone rang in the middle of the night.
I didn't hear it, but she did.
It scared the daylights out of her.
Your first thought is that something terrible has happened.
But it was a business call from India about something they're printing -
- and they forgot about the time difference.
Since we left Denmark, the enemy's objective hasn't changed.
The Taliban's objective is to destabilize security in Helmand -
- and undermine the locals' trust in the ISAF forces.
It's important to get into Haftaran and Athakhan -
- to establish contact with the people. when you eat your field rations -
- and there's something you don't like -
- I suggest you save it and bring it on patrol.
Give it to the children as a sign of goodwill.
Rules of engagement.
Remember that self defense can apply prior to being fired upon.
Such as by confirmed weapons or people moving into a position to fire.
Yes. Go get ready.
Listen up. Line up, so 6-5 can take our picture before our first patrol.
I don't have anything.
I can see why the wadis are dangerous.
They can easily hide an IED.
The thought is sickening.
We're most likely to go around it -
- so it would be stupid to put one here.
905, I saw a man run through the fence on the eastern side -
- of the row of bushes that run from north to south.
Welcome to Nam.
- Hey, interpreter!
- Follow me. Come.
Hayatullah, hurry.
Don't let them onto the poppy field.
This way. Not in the field.
I will show you.
9-0 here. Civilians are showing us the route around the field.
Salaam aleikum.
How are you? Alright?
- Read your book.
- Are you reading? Yes.
- It's a madrassa.
- Are you studying the Koran?
- Have things been calm?
- How is the situation in the area?
- Calm?
- No, where is it safe?
- Are the Taliban in the area?
- They've taken the whole area.
How could you not know?
They're everywhere.
Tell us if you see anything.
So we can get them out of the area. we cannot cooperate with you.
You come with all your weapons, and then you leave.
We're staying here, and then the
Taliban will come after us.
But if you don't cooperate, we cannot secure the area -
- and then we can't build a school for your kids.
You have guns, they have guns.
If I talk, they'll cut my throat.
- First patrol reporting!
- Look at my back!
Look cool, man!
Just a sec.
First patrol reporting.
It didn't feel like anything.
Not really.
I probably will, when we get into the shooting.
But this is also part of it.
It's not all fighting.
Right, we're also here to help these poor people.
It's like going to the fun fair without trying the rollercoasters.
Alright, let's start the debriefing.
The patrol itself. How did it go?
Individual skills really sucked.
Seriously.
How many fell to their knees on short stops?
So, eight men out of 50.
Do we agree that this has to be improved?
Get into the habit now.
Get your fat ass down on its knees -
- because at some point if you don't, then pow!
So kneel, damn it!
Right. Anything else?
I think I ought to say what I got out of this patrol. And it wasn't a lot.
Remember this is an agricultural area.
The peasants have just sown their wheat. And we're ploughing it down.
I could only say that our security out there was to trample their fields down.
Nothing's happening out there yet.
The good old classic. The coolest thing about porn is the story line.
I'd like doctors like that, if I go to hospital.
Strangely enough it helped him!
It's weird, don't you think?
You volunteer to sleep on a tiny cot -
- and eat crap food for six months.
- I know there's more to it.
- I'm doing it for the team spirit.
- Team spirit and adventure.
- Yeah.
- How do your parents feel about it?
- They're not overjoyed.
My parents were like:
"Don't go on missions." -
So I decided to go to Kosovo, and on my first day at the garrison -
- I still thought
I was going to Kosovo.
But at the meeting we were told that Kosovo wasn't an option.
Here it's all 'Afghan'.
I called my mother afterwards -
- and told her I was going to Afghanistan after all.
She cried her eyes out.
Fucking hell, Rasmus. what time is it?
- 41 minutes past.
- What's this? A little mullah?
- Are those animals? Two foxes?
- They sure aren't hedgehogs.
What the hell was that?
- was that mortars?
- Call in and find out.
You know what's going on?
Over.
I have a good idea.
I'll just check it out.
It's probably the person digging from before that we engaged. Over.
It's cool they bombed the idiot.
Too bad we can't see him.
You'll be an easy target now.
- It's doing a recce.
- Nice.
It's our eyes out there.
It's cool that it can check out suspicious things in a compound.
Right.
I'd like to see some action now.
I don't know what my first reaction will be.
We haven't got a chance to know what it's like, when we haven't tried it.
And the thought of these
'foreign fighters', you know.
I can imagine that the first contact will be rather spicy.
He could be Taliban.
Just like anyone of the 7 billion people out there.
- Too bad we can't tell them apart.
- The only difference is the weapon.
He could be hiding it under his clothes.
But it's clever.
Imagine we could do the same.
Do you think anyone is watching us?
- Someone's always watching us.
- Right.
There's bound to be someone in these compounds -
- who is on the Taliban side and keeps an eye on us. what are you seeing? what does he want?
What now, Billy Bob?
Hang on a sec.
- Who?
- This guy.
- Is it the informer?
- No, he's lighting a cigarette.
They don't always do that.
There's been an uproar on the net about the 40 Pakistanis -
- who are said to be entrenched -
- but their presence hasn't been verified. It could be a spook or real. we're going on a domination patrol -
- which is a matter of preventing him from moving freely -
- and denying him the upper hand or being master of the domain.
We've got your back.
Any updates? Over.
- Enemy forces have been sent out.
Roger that.
Who are you?
British? Canadian?
- Danish.
- Danish?
- Are you Jewish or Christian?
- Jewish?
No. we're Christian. why are you here?
Look what you've done to our soil.
Look!
You shot it up.
You killed our cow.
- And you've wounded our family.
- Why did you do that?
- The Taliban are way over there.
- They have lots of big weapons.
And they'll shoot you.
903 Victor, October-fest Carlsberg.
Over.
Roger. when the civilians are gone, they'll open fire. Correct?
Get down!
I have impact.
Scan the area!
- Did you see where it came from?
- Signaler, let's go.
What was that?
90, any report on that smoke? was it incoming?
- What did you say?
- The Taliban are ready to attack.
- It's jammed.
- Shit.
- Cover us, so 6 can get up here.
- This crap isn't working.
Hurry, Mini.
- Allahu Akbar.
- Signaler, into the water.
They're behind the two compounds in a hollow.
- Two shooters.
- Krag, ready to go over the top?
Between the two compounds in the hollow. Ready?
- Over there! Can you see them?
- No.
- They're in the hollow.
- Yes.
Between the two compounds.
Red smoke. 500 m.
- Get ready to fire the recoilless gun.
- Firing !
Reload, reload ... !
Everybody out! way to go!
- Super.
- Well done.
It's a nice big hole.
- what do you think, guys?
- That's what I call a gun slit.
We can see the whole terrain.
He was near the ditch.
- The Taliban are ready to fire.
- Careful! Stay down!
The Taliban have reported they can see five of us.
- Signaler, let's move away.
- I'm coming.
Hit the deck!
- 5, get down!
- Hey! Isn't it over?
No! Get down!
Whisky reports, "Get down."
- The people standing could get shot.
- whisky sees ninjas everywhere.
Yes, the guy's a bundle of nerves.
Did you see those guys running? where ...?
I've got them.
It's just some kids.
Roger. Out.
That was an annoying message.
The locals asked the Taliban not to shoot -
- so they can evacuate the wounded women and children. Not good.
- That's gross.
- Is that a wounded or a dead person?
If they really are cowards, they might be carrying weapons out.
- The thought did cross my mind.
- It's a good excuse to stare at us.
And they can move weapons to a new position, when we're on our way back.
Maybe it's just a civilian casualty.
- That guy's got balls.
- I hate those damn Taliban.
You can't tell who's who, and the dicks shoot from civilian compounds.
- There's not much we can do.
- No, but it's messy.
- What's up, Signaler?
- Well done. Your baptism of fire.
- It was a good start for beginners.
- I was about to say that.
- It was a good start for beginners.
- Everybody out, everybody home.
Mini?
How much 1 2.7 ammo did you fire?
- A lot.
- You're damn right.
This is a bit heavy.
When I got into the barn, the chickens attacked me.
When is the bread done?
Why do we have to do this shit?
Ranger.
Look at this, Mads.
Even if you have a gun,
I'd still win.
- It depends on how far away you are.
- Here.
Let's see who draws first.
You have to release yours,
I just have to swing this.
From down there?
- Can I carry it ...?
- No. Then I'd be like this.
Kim, you can lift it with one hand, right? Or do you need two hands?
- Ready?
- Gotcha.
Three shots to the chest.
- Quite cool .. .
- It doesn't get much better than that.
- See you later, Mads.
- Send my regards.
Alright, Mads?
- I'll close off those streets.
- Fine.
Mini, over there with Kim.
- Why are you with them?
- He's American.
- Why are you with them?
- He's red, too.
Get out of the military. Leave.
- Leave?
- Yes. Go home.
Do you have a home?
I don't owe you any money, if that's what you're saying.
He has funny eyes.
He is slant-eyed.
They look puffy.
He took it in the ass.
I regret your losses, but you all know -
- that we have to walk in the fields.
How should we know?
Is it our fault, maybe?
Last year they bombarded our house.
I swear by God I don't even have any clothes to wear.
And my sons cannot help me.
Then we must leave our villages. what can we do?
What can we do? It's not you or the Taliban that gets killed. we are the ones who get killed.
The civilians get killed.
We sit in our homes and get bombed.
The Taliban shoot, and then they run away. They escape. we're sorry, but we try to move the war up north.
That would be good for us, for this ruins everything.
You can't.
People fight, because they're poor.
Including the Taliban.
- Come on, you faggots.
- Look who's talking.
You planted bombs, you ape!
So far we know that a civilian car approached the gas station -
- on Highway 1 towards the desert, the route we usually take home.
The car hit something and detonated.
There was an explosion.
Our formation is vehicle 1 in front..
Primarily observe from the rifleman's position. we'll see how bad it is when we get there. Okay?
Flip your night vision down and keep a lookout behind.
On our way back from there
I heard a huge explosion.
I couldn't believe it.
I ran back down -
- and 7-5 and 3-5 ran right into me, so I went flying.
Everybody was running all over the place.
Then I heard, "There's blood everywhere. 2-5 is down."
I said, "For fuck's sake, 5.
You should keep your head down."
Then he said, "I know.
How about a dance?" I cracked up.
"This isn't a good time."
Then I gave him emotional first aid.
He had a huge gash here.
Turned out to be a fractured skull.
Damn.
- No fucking fun.
- I'll say.
I heard a massive boom, and everything was sand and dust -
- for a few seconds.
I tried to feel if my teeth were broken with my tongue -
- and I tried to wiggle my fingers.
I couldn't tell if my teeth were okay -
- because I had so much gravel, sand and blood in my mouth.
I only felt splinters and stones.
I didn't know what was what.
I tried ... I don't remember clearly -
- but I looked down and saw two trickles of blood.
It wasn't until I was in the helicopter -
- that I started to get really uncomfortable.
That's when I had time to think about it.
"what do I look like now?
Will I ever recover?"
"will I talk funny for the rest of my life?" All those questions.
I have to go back to Armadillo and stand in front of them all -
- and say, "You can't get rid of me that easily."
- 2-5 here.
- Raven has something.
Three men are walking south.
Can Alpha 1-7 see them running?
Get the coordinates.
- They're splitting up.
Aim at the place that's been used as a firing point.
Do they have to assemble the gun first or what?
9-0. Pancake.
- Alright!
- About bloody time.
- Do you want everyone to meet up?
- Yes ...
2nd platoon, at the vehicles.
There he is! Our man.
- Alright?
- You bet. I'm in great shape.
- Hi, guys.
- You smell good, too.
- But you don't.
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.
- Hey, man.
I'm sick of hugging sweaty guys by now. who else? Jesus Christ.
Hey, guys.
Are we all here?
Hey, man.
- I'm glad you grew that beard again.
- I thought you might feel that way.
- Here's group leader 1 .
- Well, for the time being.
It's fucking great to see you guys.
Any questions?
Great. Let's go.
Signaler, the locals say the Taliban bugged out north and south -
- when they saw us arrive.
Signaler, will you cover me if I run out in the field?
- Probably not.
- This is damn depressing.
All dressed up and no one to blow. This won't do.
- wanna bet?
- Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen?
It's no fun betting when we agree.
Daniel, how about stripping and running naked across the field?
- That might kick things up a notch.
- His pink body will scare them off.
Shut the fuck up.
The other day ...
My house was bombed.
My cow was killed, and two calves.
They didn't die, they were wounded.
A cow was killed.
Two calves were injured.
Our guard dog was also blown to bits.
Look.
The animals were tied up in here.
There are 19 of us.
The cow gave us milk.
- Now we have nothing, no money.
- We can compensate you for it.
Hello. How are you?
Can you come to the camp this evening or tonight?
It's very difficult.
People get killed. They're afraid.
But it's important that we collaborate.
So we can make peace here.
God willing, we can bring peace to this place. Rebuild the country ...
Exactly, but we'll see.
God will provide. we ... the country is exhausted.
2-1, can we move forward, or do we wait?
- Having a nice time?
- we don't have to cuddle up.
Unless you want to.
I have a hole in my pants.
I can use my finger if you like?
- You missed. A bit further up.
- No thanks.
Christ, this is boring.
Their cow was killed by mortars the day before yesterday.
- You can see where.
- That doesn't look recent.
- It's been like that for a while.
- we saw where he buried the cow. we can sense that the Taliban are intimidating people in the area.
The locals say we're here to kill animals and people.
- And the Taliban take advantage ...
- Of what's going on. Obviously.
Okay, we need to move forward, boys.
- The aerial sees two men in Sierra 5.
- we're at Sierra 5.
- Should we take it and crush them?
- Daniel? New plan.
Two guys in Sierra 5.
Right there!
- Do you want explosives?
- Let's wait and see.
There's still that hole in the wall.
The hole straight ahead.
Proceed. I got it here.
Get in front.
There's something here.
There's a civilian.
Forward.
There's no one here.
Civilians in the compound. we will continue searching.
There's no one here.
Salaam aleikum.
901, 5 is searched. Out.
Fuck, I'm tired of this shit.
They're laughing at us, and we waste time blasting into these compounds.
And they're already gone.
A waste of time.
- Mortar, another 15 ts.
- Ready ...!
Everybody ready ... shoot!
She had abdominal injuries.
And a fractured skull.
I'm the one who says:
That's your target.
I did what we had planned.
There's nothing to do about it.
It's ... I almost said 'spilt milk'.
Harsh words, but that's what it is.
It can't be undone, and you shouldn't blame yourself.
We live in a world, where you watch the news -
- with thousands of people, who die all the time . ..
So it doesn't bother me if a girl dies.
It's just because you're close to it.
I just think ... We came down here, and it wasn't done on purpose. we did exactly what we're supposed to do, and we would do it again.
That's the way it is.
I'm very tired. My house was burnt down, and that's why I'm here.
My mother died, and so did my little child.
We were away. Only my mother and the little one stayed at home.
I told my mother to come along, but she didn't want to.
You have to tell us which things were destroyed.
Quilts, matresses, curtains, plates and lots of other things in my house.
May God forgive your mother.
She has become a martyr.
Mini, observe for the fucking platoon.
A situation is reported -
- but they move forward anyway.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Wait!
Oh no ...!
Say something, man!
Is everyone okay? Over.
Negative, negative.
Condition critical.
He can talk, but has difficulty breathing. Over.
Copy that. Get him to my position quickly. I'll get ready here.
Fuck ...! Here we go.
3-4 here. The helicopter will be here in two minutes.
Copy. We'll start moving him to pick-up point. Over.
We've sent our call signs minus four men -
- who're picking up the last bits. we have a vehicle to secure us and expect to arrive in ten. Over.
His condition is stable, but his left leg was amputated at the thigh -
- and his right leg below the knee.
He was wounded in the groin -
- and in the abdomen, but there was no internal bleeding.
They think he'll survive, but he was seriously wounded.
They've found our weak points and are making the most of them.
Yes, we're good at attacking and moving forward -
- but we're held back because of those damn IEDs we can't find.
It's all fucked up.
When you think about it, you wouldn't feel guilty about -
- shooting those assholes.
I'd feel worse shooting a stray dog.
Right.
On our way back from patrol we were told -
- that three men from Romeo 1-5 hit an IED on Highway 1 .
At that point, they were category B, which is seriously wounded.
When we got back here, we were told all three were dead.
I think everyone was hoping -
- that we would go down in history as the first team not to lose a man.
Then they showed pictures of those three handsome young men -
- who were smiling, and whose eyes were shining.
They looked happy. I can't take much more of this, Mads.
- It's really, really hard.
- Yes.
Please be careful.
Come home soon.
I will.
Another two months to go.
Let's commemorate our three fellow men -
- and honor them and show our respect with a minute of silence.
The men are getting tired.
Wahir, where we were doing well -
- is now infiltrated by the Taliban.
They know exactly how many we are in the camp -
- and when we're up to something or not. we'll have to see ...
... if ambushing them will work.
Is anyone too upset to go?
- I'd like to stay home.
- Me, too.
Mads, are you okay?
You don't mind going? well, if you need me,
I'll come along.
Great.
Go get the job done.
You know what to do, so be careful.
Give them hell in the morning.
That's the whole point.
See you tomorrow.
Safe journey.
One group of enemy forces reported ready. Over.
Several civilians are heading your way.
On the right-hand side of the men in the back.
Women and children are leaving the zone.
There are several combat indicators.
More families are leaving the zone.
There's no mistaking that.
Okay, the last ICOM says they've spotted our patrol and will ambush it.
I have a possible digger about 200-250 m north of me -
- at a compound.
Request warning shot. Over.
Copy. Stand by.
- It's a damn kill zone out there.
- Fine with me, as long as they shoot.
All those on the right, return to the trees.
3, retreat to the compound wall.
- what did you do so far?
- I gave him morphine in the thigh.
And I gave him Fentanyl.
His pulse was fine.
- Can he have a drink?
- Yes. where the hell are those bastards?
- Give me a fucking Taliban, man.
- Forward!
Let's go, move forward.
- Fuck, they almost got me!
- Cover for fuck's sake! Cover!
I can't hear you.
We're in the open field.
Where are you?
You're on my right in the open field.
- Hold your fire!
- 3, you're shooting at the trees.
- I'm on the other side, you idiot.
- The Taliban are in the ditch. what the fuck is he talking about?
The Taliban are in the ditch in front of you.
- Right in front of us!
- Daniel!
- Can you get him with a grenade?
- Yes.
Fire in the hole!
Now we neutralize them.
Kim, over here!
- You're walking towards each other.
- Frederik was hit!
- There's another one here.
- Frederik was hit in the leg.
- who?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.
- who was hit?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.
- Kim ...! Go help Frederik.
- Hold your fire!
- Here we are, Frederik.
- Is that guy dead, or what?
Frederik, if you can limp, then let's get over to that building.
- Super.
- Where to .. .?
- Where to?
- To your right.
Stay here.
I'll take him.
Hey! There's one more here!
And two more over there!
- Easy, easy ...
- They have to fucking die!
- He's already on his way.
- Good job!
- There are three dead over there.
- Move on, Daniel!
They fired from the corner over there.
As soon as we've cleaned up, we ...
5, I've got a hand-grenade.
- I need you to check my arm.
- what the hell ...? Your arm?
Look at this ...
- It was stuck in my soft armor.
- Your soft armor?
- Where precisely?
- Look, it's ...
- And through here. And there.
- Shit.
- Damn, that was crazy!
- Hole is cleaned!
Fucking pigs, man!
- Alright?
- Yes.
Good.
Keep your hand still.
Try holding it upwards.
- 30 seconds ...
- 30 seconds.
- Damn, that was crazy.
- There are five dead in the ditch.
Five dead Taliban right there?
This feels completely surreal.
- Where are those assholes?
- I shot this one in the head.
- Damn, it stinks.
- Shut up.
- Let go of it.
- There's one more.
- Wait a sec. You cover me!
- Of course.
This will be messy. Oh, you went commando, you sick bastard.
- Are those hand guns or magazines?
- He had a pistol apparently.
They already stink.
Kim, if you've tried slaughtering animals, this is no big deal.
That's a bit much, isn't it?
No guns.
It's a good thing they aren't any heavier. what are you packing, buddy?
Okay, get ready to move forward.
How many shots did you fire?
You really went at it.
- Don't they deserve to die?
- Sure. I don't feel sorry for them.
- The water in the stream was red.
- You yelled: "There's no one there."
And we yelled : "Yes, there is!"
Then you figured it out.
It was a ricochet. It nicked me and was stopped there.
I have the bullet in my pocket.
- 40 seconds.
- Pancake! way to go!
- Welcome. We have sodas.
- Sounds good.
Great job.
That was fucking awesome.
- Four of them with a fucking grenade.
- It was nice.
Fuck, that was great.
This is something we'll never forget.
That was some of the best fucking soldiering I've ever seen.
You did a damn good job.
They didn't have any ID or cell phones on them.
I had to pull one of them by the head from under a log.
- He was stuck underneath it.
- Yuck. All the dead Afghans.
Mini, your eyes were huge.
You just stood there staring at them.
The worst thing was with 3.
"They are in the creek."
I didn't believe them, but emptied a magazine down the creek.
"They're still there!"
"No, there's nobody there."
Hand grenade! I came up, there were four of them lying there, rattling.
Then 5 wanted to be in on it, so he emptied a magazine under the log.
- Then Signaler and I found one more.
- Yeah, he said so.
- Not much fun for those Talibobs.
- They were in a bad spot.
Ølby, you say four on the first side?
Plus two more on the other side.
- No, only one.
- There were two. wasn't there one farther along?
When we turned the corner -
- I'm sure we fired at two of them.
- I searched the whole lot.
You went back? Okay. well, no one crawled away after we were there.
Good afternoon.
Everyone's back from the Green Zone.
It was a hectic morning.
I think we all agree on that.
The wounded are doing alright.
I have a fresh update on them.
- Both were operated on.
- Louder!
One of them in the shoulder, the other in the leg.
Grejs says he's sorry he won't be coming back.
He's going back to Denmark for rehabilitation. That's all we know.
You did a good job and showed guts, 2nd platoon.
Today was a close shave.
Anything else?
Have a nice day.
- war booty!
- Loots of war!
Let's start the debriefing.
I want to get through it quickly, and get to the point.
Today we can establish that we didn't fire at each other.
There were many instances, where we were in doubt -
- and mistakes have happened.
I had my doubts that the enemy was only 3 m away.
I hear you hollering that he's close by, and I say "No!"
In the end I was so irritated that I emptied a magazine down the stream.
I thought that would be enough, but you said no -
- and that's when we threw a grenade.
Afterwards Signaler and I -
- found four men groaning heavily in the ditch, feeling rather bad. we liquidated them in the most humane way possible.
5 joined in and fired a magazine under a little bridge -
- and we cleaned the area and found the shooter Ian mentioned.
- He was hit and moaning.
- He was trying to crawl.
- We shot him 30-40 times.
- we finished them off.
- Thanks!
- That was it.
It was fucking awesome.
Not while it was happening -
- but when we got back. Now we've been at war. Now we've tried it.
I never felt that way on patrol before. Normally it's just boring.
But this time I thought -
- there was a real risk of being boxed in.
I never thought that before. we outnumber them -
- and have cool weapons, so they can't touch us. But here they could.
But I'd still like to try it again.
One more time.
I wouldn't.
Think about it! when your tour is over, you'll feel so much better about it.
- Yes.
- It's true.
Making a difference is a cool feeling.
Having been up shit creek will feel great once you're back home.
Imagine if our tour was just a load of crap with nothing going on -
- and only boring patrols.
- It would be a lame way to go home.
- Right. we're gonna see Frederiks' leg.
He has to show us.
- What's up?
- Turn around. way to go, man!
- Good to see you, Grejs.
- You, too.
- So, are you hooked up with Brits?
- They are all bloody Afghans.
- Even some Taliban.
- Really?
Actually, one came in with eyes covered and his hands tied yesterday.
- If you go back inside, we'll come in.
See you inside.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
- A well-placed shot afterwards.
- Brilliant.
The bullet entered here and was sticking out of my ass.
- They had to dig it out.
- Cool.
I totally forgot about the pain because the chopper flew like this.
I don't know if you heard, but Ølby got four with a grenade.
- They were moaning.
- I don't know how many it killed.
But three of them were lying in a pile.
You could only see an ear and the left side of the head of one of them.
The rest was hanging off him.
Two of them were underneath him.
I thought, "what the fuck?"
They were on top of each other.
Another was under a log, and another was farther away.
- He was crawling on the ground.
- No, he wasn't.
So we hit the jackpot in that ditch.
Okay, guys.
Bye.
I've got two things for you.
You definitely get the Horse.
- Thanks a lot.
- You deserve it.
You fought with us and with Special
Forces. Super ... Damn fine job.
Listen up. I was questioned by the MPs this evening.
Apparently someone called home and told their parents -
- that we liquidated wounded people -
- and piled up the dead, to take pictures of ourselves as heroes.
And that I personally returned and killed some wounded Talibans.
People have also said that we laughed about this during our debriefing.
The parents ... or this mother has contacted Operational Command -
- and asked if that is how we deal with things here.
What bothers me the most right now ...
... is the question of loyalty.
I have to know -
- if anyone here believes that this is what happened.
Does anyone honestly believe that?
Yes .. .?
If I had listened to our debriefing and the sequence of events -
- I would have thought it was extremely ... delicate.
I could understand if outsiders, who weren't there got that impression.
We were still on a high afterwards.
You have to take that into consideration.
It was an extreme experience, so we used extreme words.
If the press makes a case of this, and people think we're psychos -
- well, let them think so.
They weren't there, they didn't see it.
They weren't there, but we know what happened.
Let them talk.
They weren't there.
If they make a case out of this, we'll be suspended -
- and then we'll be blowing bubbles, and that's it until we go home.
And we'll go down in military history, apart from those who knew us -
- as the guys who fucked up.
Anyone who's named in this case -
- including myself,
Daniel and Signaler -
- can look forward to a long session with the whole military circus.
I can't say:
"You weren't there, man" to that.
I believe that Signaler and Daniel had the balls to do the right thing -
- at the right time.
To proceed the way they did with two wounded, one near miss -
- and three men with holes in their uniform and so on ...
To walk up and shoot ... Had I seen movement, I would have fired, too.
And it only took Daniel or Signaler to point under the log and say:
"One here, one there."
That was enough for me to flip to automatic and shoot.
I didn't feel like sticking my head down to someone with a gun.
And yes, it was touch and go.
But in my world you do what you do.
If you have the strength not to shoot -
- because you realise that the movement is not that of a weapon -
- but a surrender or whatever . .. If you have the strength to realise this -
- you don't shoot, of course, but had I been there -
- I would also have fired, and
I did fire, because I wasn't sure.
That was enough for me.
I think it's hard for people at home to understand how ...
- How the decision is made?
- How you can just take a life.
You have to be here to understand it.
This place is whacked, after all.
It's a fucked-up country.
No doubt about it.
People who understand the war itself -
- and how you and I and others feel about being here -
- and making a difference, those people will understand us.
Outsiders might sneer and say that we're insane -
- or that we did something terrible.
I know I did the right thing.
I know we all did the right thing.
In case you don't know, I was questioned by MPs this morning -
- regarding our case with the snitch.
So far it's 'a matter of rumor' -
- which they'll try to quash at battalion level.
So if you hear anything, then dismiss it as a rumor -
- because that's what it is.
So it's just a lot of hot air.
It may come back to haunt us -
- but it is a lot of hot air without any truth in it.
Alright?
That's it.
Good day.
I have a few things to say today.
First of all -
- I'd like to award Silver and Gold
Horses for our recent engagement.
The first two are Joe and Ølby.
Joe and Ølby did something that others might feel differently about.
These guys did it. Five
Taliban were firing at the platoon.
Our guys stormed them with a hand grenade and neutralized them.
This takes courage, and I'm proud of you.
I'm awarding you the Gold Horse, and you both deserve it.
We'll see if it leads to more.
Damn fine job.
Congratulations. well deserved.
And one for you, Joe.
Congratulations.
You deserve it. Give them a hand. what does it say ...?
Smith is a part-time transvestite -
- and a full-time idiot.
Deep thoughts ...
- Not a lot of deep stuff here.
- The deepest was painted over.
The guys were a bit pissed about that.
Of course there was a lot of shit -
- but there's also stuff which ...
Which was quite cool to read.
And it would be cool to see your own stuff, if you came back.
"In the North I know the fairest land.
My people, my home, my native land."
"Denmark."
That was quite poetic.
WELCOM E HOM E

Dirty Wars (2013) - Bluray
Full Subs.
Kabul, Afghanistan,
4:00 in the morning.
As an American journalist,
I was used to filing stories in the middle of the night.
But there's always something eerie driving through the deserted streets.
A city of 3 million- barely a streetlight on.
It was a familiar routine:
Waiting for the crew to light up the night sky so you could see something in the background.
But could we really see?
Well, Keith, greetings from Kabul, Afghanistan, where the U.S. Ambassador
Karl Eikenberry...
This is a story about the seen and the unseen...
And about things hidden in plain sight.
It's hard to say when this story began.
I'd been working as a war reporter for more than a decade in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and now Afghanistan.
After nearly ten years, the war here wasn't exactly breaking news.
I think there's, like- there's, like, eight rakes.
One, two, three...
We haven't been out here.
What's the name of this village out here?
Oh, I have no idea.
They all blend in for me.
Yeah.
What's the focus of your campaign here?
In southern Nangarhar, we're dealing with the Ashkar-
Ashkael- uh, Asherkeil tribe.
You know, the wording, uh, I'll get right probably when we leave next year, but...
This was supposed to be the front line in the war on terror.
From Kabul out on an exercise with the military and back to Kabul, the Afghan Press Corps was locked in a bubble.
We were told that the battle for hearts and minds was being won as soldiers dug wells or drank tea with tribal elders.
But I knew I was missing the story.
There was another war, hinted at in press conferences and detailed in each morning's press release.
December 14th, Zabul Province, a night raid.
Four Taliban killed, three detained for questioning.
No civilians injured.
No one at NATO would give us anything more than the lists of nighttime raids.
No one even seemed to know who was doing the raids.
And I wasn't going to find out if I stayed in Kabul.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN
This is the third raid in my district.
13 or 14 people have been killed in all.
They were innocent people.
So what you're saying is that the Americans will come into a district where you're the police commander, and they won't inform you that they're gonna carry out this kind of action in your district.
I've asked the American soldiers that come to my district.
But even the main
NATO base here says they don't know anything about the raids.
The troops came from another base.
So there's the two- the two men in the guesthouse were the first people killed.
And then...
The farmer from here.
- Yeah.
- And then another farmer.
Two.
Two of his sons.
Two.
- Mm-hmm.
- Two of his sons.
So there's, I think- so seven.
Or two-
- Two, two---four.
One farmer---five.
Two these--- seven.
Two...
The Americans will say anything.
The Americans will say anything, everyone knows that.
If the Americans do this again, we are ready to shed our blood fighting them.
We would rather die than sit by and do nothing.
The list of raids from
NATO press releases read like a map of a hidden war.
The military divided the roads in Afghanistan by color.
Green was safe.
Red was dangerous.
And black?
Don't even try it.
Most of the raids were happening far beyond the green zone in what the military called "denied areas"...
Places where journalists never show up to ask questions.
NATO, the U.S. Embassy, and my own better judgment all advised against traveling there.
But I'd read about a raid in Gardez, half a day's drive in Paktia Province.
I pushed as far as I could into the gray area on the fraying edge of NATO's control, past rusting Russian tanks and bombed-out NATO supply convoys.
Two other journalists had been kidnapped on this road, and after weeks in the military's armored vehicles, our Toyota felt thin-skinned and fragile.
I knew I had to be back in Kabul before sunset, when the Taliban took control of the roads.
But I had no idea how far my visit to Gardez would lead me.
GARDEZ
PAKTIA PROVINCE
This is my son, and this is my son, and this is my daughter-in-law, and this is my granddaughter.
They killed them all on a single day.
Two of the women they killed were pregnant.
One was 5 months, the other was 4 months pregnant.
A child had been born in our home and we had organized a party to celebrate.
We invited many guests and had music.
During the party, people were dancing our traditional dance, the attan.
The American forces came between 3:30 and 4:00 am.
Daoud went to see what was happening.
He thought the
Taliban had come.
They were already on the roof.
They shot Daoud as soon as he stepped outside.
All the children were shouting,
"Daoud is shot!
Daoud is shot!"
We brought Daoud in here.
The women grabbed Zaher.
They told him not to go or he would be killed.
But they opened fire.
They killed three women, along with Zaher.
My wife, my sister, and my niece.
Look at these patched bullet holes.
Was Mr. Daoud killed immediately, or did he live for a while after he was shot?
Daoud and my sister-in-law were alive until 7:00 am.
They didn't let us take them to the hospital.
The Americans used knives to dig the bullets out of their bodies.
They pulled out the bullets from their body.
You saw the U.S. Forces take the bullets out of the body?
Ja.
They tied our hands and blindfolded us.
Two people grabbed us.
They pushed us one by one into the aircraft.
They flew us to another province.
To Paktika.
So he had just seen his wife killed by the American forces, and then he himself was taken prisoner by the Americans.
What was going through his head when they took him?
My senses weren't working at all. I couldn't cry.
I was numb and didn't feel a thing.
I didn't eat for three days and nights.
My hands and clothes were caked with blood.
They didn't give us water to wash the blood away.
The interrogators had beards and didn't wear American uniforms.
They had big muscles.
Sometimes they acted nice.
And sometimes they would shake us.
By the time I got home, all our dead had already been buried.
Only my father and my brother were left at home. I didn't want to live anymore.
I wanted to wear a suicide jacket and blow myself up among the Americans.
But my brother and my father wouldn't let me.
I wanted Jihad against the Americans.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
1:00 AM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010
MOHAMMED DAOUD
2:00 PM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010
The family had no idea what led the Americans to their home.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
POLICE COMMANDER, GARDEZ
They had long fought against the Taliban, and Daoud was a police commander who'd been through dozens of U.S. training programs.
This is my son, the Police Commander.
Was he Taliban?
They said they had information that 50 Taliban were here.
But they were all my relatives, and they worked for the government.
They killed my innocent sons, daughter, and daughter-in-law.
They had committed no sin and had no enemies.
As we prepared to leave,
Daoud's granddaughter spoke to us, but only later would I know the meaning of her words.
Daoud's family told me it was time to go.
The sun sets early in the mountains, and the night belongs to the Taliban.
So the highway is closed.
I think there is an attack from Taliban.
The gunfire continued, and it was now obvious how dangerous, maybe even reckless the trip had been.
Mm-hmm.
NATO wasted no time issuing a report.
They claimed that the women killed in Gardez were the victims of a
Taliban honor killing, bound and gagged by their own murderous families.
You saw the U.S. Forces take the bullets out of the body?
I believed the family, but that wasn't enough for me or anyone else.
[Speaking indistinctly]
Who were these men that stormed into Daoud's home?
And why would they go to such horrifying lengths to cover up their actions?
Tamana.
Who did the Americans kill?
They killed my grandfather...
...and Gulalai.
And they killed Agha Abdulnoor.
All right.
Ready? Yeah.
One, two, three.
Good morning.
The subcommittee will come to order.
The subject is national security.
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON, DC
If my esteemed friend, the gentleman from Michigan, wishes to continue with this hearing,
I think that's fine.
He is the chairman.
But next year, when this committee is under new management, we won't be looking at the calendar of last year or two years ago.
Thank you.
Far from discussing the distant past,
I'd like to share with this committee part of my investigation into deadly U.S. night raids...
Sensenbrenner walked out, but no one else even bothered to show up...
Just Chairman Conyers and his staffers.
In closing, Mr. Ohairman,
I told these families that I'd bring their cases before the U.S. Congress and ask that they be investigated and that those responsible be held accountable.
On behalf of those families...
It didn't surprise me that Washington wasn't interested in Gardez.
As an investigative reporter, you rarely have people's attention.
More often than not, you work alone, and the stories you labor over fall on deaf ears.
But sometimes a story strikes a nerve, and you're thrown into the public arena.
It happened to me once before.
During its time in Iraq,
Blackwater has regularly engaged in firefights and other deadly incidents...
It was 2007, and I was reporting on Blackwater, a shadowy mercenary company, and suddenly it was front-page news.
A frequent contributor to The Nation magazine, his new book is called Blackwater.
Jeremy Scahill, who authored the book Blackwater...
Who's come to us from London...
Joining me now is
Jeremy Scahill.
I quickly discovered that the world of talk show television is less a meeting place for ideas and more like a boxing ring.
That is hooey.
$700 million for a colonial fortress in Pakistan.
The whole thing feels like a game.
But every time you step into the ring, there's a chance your story can have an impact.
Journalists have done nothing to hold the White House accountable now,
Chuck, or under Bush.
Let me get to the story-
- Why are you still alive?
Are you paranoid?
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.
I mean, it's an amazing book that you've written, and I'm curious that-
"Oh, that guy had a"-
"Remember that guy we did Maher with?"
"Oh, he's dead."
"What happened?"
"He had an accident." I mean...
And here are the-
Residents are being picked up, abducted...
Congress wasn't going to investigate the raid in Gardez.
And my Freedom of
Information requests were bounced all over the military, ending up in an unnamed agency awaiting review.
I reached out to everyone
I could in Washington- the CIA, State Department, former military officials- but no one would speak openly about Gardez...
Until I met with
General Hugh Shelton,
Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs on 9/11.
GEN. HUGH SHELTON
CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
One incident that I looked into in Afghanistan, where an Afghan police commander and two pregnant women were killed- but the question I wanted to ask you is, in that kind of case- let's say that's true- how would something like that be handled or investigated or reviewed?
If they go flying in and meet any kind of resistance at all-
I mean, shots are fired- then I'm sorry if they got killed, but they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I don't think it ought to be investigated.
I think you write it off as one of those damn acts of war.
But one of the victims was a senior police commander who had been trained by the U.S.
And two of them were pregnant women.
Now, just 'cause he's a police chief- he could've been a terrorist as well.
You know, he could've been working both sides, so that piece of it, although it sounds bad- but two pregnant women?
The fact that they were pregnant is very, very unfortunate, but it's also unfortunate that they were women.
But on the other hand,
I've been shot at by women myself, so that doesn't-
And I mean shot at.
That doesn't excuse 'em.
They die just like men do if they shoot at us, so...
Congress wasn't interested.
I was being stonewalled by the military.
And General Shelton told me there should be no investigation.
KAIA AIRPORT
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN
And back in Afghanistan, the reporter who first broke the Gardez story had been publicly attacked by NATO.
JEROME STARKEY
TIMES OF LONDON
Yeah, we went to print on a Saturday.
By Saturday afternoon,
I was getting information from other journalists in
Kabul who are my friends that NATO was briefing against me.
NATO was trying to discredit me, trying to say that the story was inaccurate, and effectively trying to kill it dead.
To my knowledge, that was the only time that they've named a journalist and sort of singled out a journalist so specifically in a denial.
NATO accused Starkey of lying.
It could have been enough to end a journalist's career.
But information about
Gardez kept leaking out.
A secret UN investigation confirmed many of the details the family had told us, and an Afghan police inquiry was under way.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
I didn't realize what the family was showing me.
It was just a grainy cell phone video from the morning after the attack...
[indistinct conversation]
Until the voices began.
Ok, the blood trail, this is it.
This is the last room.
This is where the engagement was.
If he comes in here, there's a woman crying in the doorway.
My group was emptying this room and that room there, okay?
We pulled everyone out, okay?
Now, at that point, I'm watching what's going on here.
I see it all go down, and now we go behind them.
White light.
To make sure no one's hiding.
When I get to here...
Two Americans, their hands visible for a moment filming the corpses while they piece together their version of that night's killings.
After everything's said and done, still two guys are hiding...
NATO phoned me up, and they said,
"Jerome, we're just calling to let you know
"we're about to put out a press release.
We are changing our version of events."
They admitted that they were responsible for killing the three women and that the men they said were Taliban were not, in fact, Taliban.
They admitted they'd got it wrong.
Again, they were hoping it was gonna go away.
Well, it wasn't.
Like yourselves, we set off very early one morning from Kabul through
Logar to Gardez...
When up rolls a huge convoy of countless Afghan officers and soldiers.
And among them is a man wearing a uniform that I recognize as sort of U.S. Marines, but it says U.S.
Navy on his lapel.
But I didn't know who he was.
They off-loaded a sheep, and three Afghan soldiers knelt on this sheep in exactly the same place where these soldiers had been when they started the raid.
They were offering to sacrifice the sheep.
The soldiers tried to stop
Starkey's photographer,
Jeremy Kelly, but the family insisted.
Otherwise, there'd be no evidence that this extraordinary event occurred, no proof of who the killers were.
Like so much about this war, they would have remained unseen.
He said that, "My soldiers were responsible for the deaths of these members of your family," and for that, he apologized.
I would not trade my sons for the entire kingdom of the United States.
America unleashes the Special Forces on us.
And the Special Forces beat and kill poor, innocent people.
These Special Forces with the beards did cruel, criminal things.
They all have beards.
We call them the American Taliban.
BROOKLYN, NY
I returned home and tried to put the story of Gardez behind me.
But coming home is never easy.
I didn't want to admit it, but life back home was dull after being in a war zone.
Ordinary life was just that.
I tried to forget about Gardez but couldn't.
We pulled everyone out, okay?
Now, at that point,
I'm watching what's going on here.
I see it all go down. Now...
The video was chilling, but I couldn't see their faces.
All I had were images of their hands and the sound of their voices.
Okay, the blood trail.
This is it.
This is the last room.
This is where the engagement was.
He comes in here. There's-
There's a woman crying in the doorway.
None of these clues were supposed to exist- the cell phone video, the photos of the admiral and his sheep.
The killers were meant to disappear without a trace.
The family had called them "American Taliban."
But who were they, these American soldiers with beards?
As a reporter, you learn that every story has conflicting points of view.
You try to understand all of them without letting your own get in the way.
But there was something about this story and the way it was covered up.
The photo of the admiral had seemed to answer our questions about the raid.
But the longer I looked at it, the less sense it made.
I could read the name and rank, but who was this man delivering the sheep?
Vice Admiral William McRaven wasn't from NATO
Headquarters in Kabul, and he wasn't from the
Eastern Regional Command that owned that battle space.
I'd never seen the R01 insignia on his shoulder.
And it was hard to find mention of him in the press, much less a photograph.
But I found an old DoD press briefing from 2008 that mentioned
McRaven's nomination to lead an obscure unit within the military called JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.
After more than a decade as a war reporter,
I thought I knew most of the players involved, but I'd never heard of JSOC.
There was little official record, but JSOC was formed in 1980 after the failed hostage rescue mission in Iran.
It was designed as the most covert unit in the military and the only one that reports directly to the White House.
So why would the
President's elite force be kicking down the doors on a family in Gardez?
I knew Gardez wasn't an isolated incident and went back to NATO's daily press releases with their lists of killed and captured.
I expected the list to be long, but I had no idea how long.
Every week, the tempo of raids increased.
In the last three months, there had been 1, 700 night raids in Afghanistan.
It was a staggering figure and meant that stories like the one in Gardez were unfolding nearly
20 times each night.
An endless list of raids but not a single name.
I could see that Gardez was part of a bigger story- much bigger.
But the very thought of it was overwhelming.
With 1, 700 raids, who would compile the list of the dead?
The surge of night raids was clearly changing the war in Afghanistan.
It didn't take long for
JSOC's actions to ricochet.
Matthew Hoh has become the first U.S. official to resign in protest over the Afghan war.
Hoh is a former marine who spent five months working for the State
Department in Afghanistan and is, by all accounts, well-respected.
CPT. MATTHEW HOH
FORMER STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL
A lot of times, yeah, the right guys would get targeted, and the right guys would get killed.
And then plenty of other times, the wrong people would get killed, sometimes innocent families.
And then that sets you back so far.
You know, nothing like going into a village in the middle of the night, knocking a door down, and, like, killing a woman or a child to just undo everything that infantry battalion command had been trying to do for, like, the last nine, ten months.
You were in a position where you were trying to vet lists to make sure that the wrong people weren't being killed by these task forces.
Were there 500 people on this list, 1,000?
No, I can't-
I can't tell you.
- Oh, you can't?
- Yeah.
You can't tell me because...
I can't tell you 'cause I can't tell you that stuff.
- You can't talk about it?
- Yeah.
I saw the list. I saw how big they are.
Yeah, everything else, yeah.
I mean, that's-
I can't tell you.
I was just...
The Joint Special
Operations Command had never numbered more than a few thousand.
But under William McRaven,
Afghanistan had become JSOC's war.
How had such a small covert unit taken over the largest conventional war on the planet?
Andrew Exum had experienced the change firsthand when he served as part of McRaven's high value targeting campaign, not in Afghanistan but in Iraq.
He led a company of rangers in 2003 as part of JSOC's
Iraq task force.
CPT. ANDREW EXUM
75TH RANGER REGIMENT
I watched the way things began to change.
You know, kind of the iron rule was, you don't go anywhere unless you've got, you know, a company of Army
Rangers in reserve.
In 2003, nobody was in reserve.
I mean, people were hitting targets every single night in a very dispersed way and just-bam, bam, bam.
I mean, you remember the deck of cards.
We kind of had this poster of all these guys, and we went out looking for them every night.
So we would, you know, kick down a door and pull somebody out of their home in the middle of the night, and the next morning, you know, people would be rioting in the streets.
I'm in!
Clear!
Come out!
On your fuckin' face.
On your face.
Yeah, I remember one night going out.
You know, we found out later that we were on two-weeks-old intelligence.
Two Iraqis started shooting at us.
We killed them.
And, you know, we kind of realized later that these guys were just out guarding the- you know, the neighborhood generator.
Now, I didn't lose any sleep over it,
'cause these guys were shooting at me, but, you know, you start thinking about it from a strategic perspective- that's a loss.
You start out with a target list, and maybe you got 50 guys on it; maybe you got 200 guys on it.
But you can work your way through those 50 or 200 guys, and then suddenly, at the end of that target list, you've now got a new target list of, you know, 3,000 people on it.
And how did this grow?
What Exum told me about
Iraq was a revelation.
I thought JSOC's rise had happened later in Afghanistan.
I'd worked in Baghdad for years and had written countless stories there, many from the front lines of the war.
It was there that I first started reporting for The Nation magazine.
But I'd never heard of JSOC.
The budget for the Joint
Special Operations Command, you can't get it through a FOIA request.
We've tried that.
I'd missed the most important story.
In Iraq, the U.S. had fundamentally changed the way it fought war.
The real story, JSOC, was hidden in the shadows, out of sight.
What was hidden in the shadows right now?
...That I propose represent a new direction from the last eight years.
What was I missing today?
We are embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.
I discovered that, over the past decade, a series of secret presidential orders had given JSOC unprecedented authority.
The battlefield was expanded, and JSOC could now hit at will in countries beyond
Iraq and Afghanistan.
I began to research strikes against al-Qaeda outside the declared battlefields.
I looked for patterns among the lists.
And then I found one.
In December 2009, five strikes with over 150 casualties in a country without a declared war.
[Man singing in native language]
ADEN, YEMEN
Aden.
Yemen's ancient port city was nothing like Kabul.
In Afghanistan, life was defined by the war.
Everything revolved around it.
But in Yemen, there was no war, at least not officially.
The strikes seemed to have come out of the blue, and most Yemenis were going about life as usual.
It was difficult to know where to start.
The Yemeni government claimed responsibility for the strikes, saying they'd killed dozens of al-Qaeda operatives.
But it was unclear who the targets really were or who was even responsible.
I arranged to meet the most powerful man in southern Yemen,
Sheikh Saleh Bin Fareed.
SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAREED
LEADER, AL-AULAQ TRIBE
When was the first time that you heard about someone being al-Qaeda in that area?
It is, eh... I never knew that anybody belonged to al-Qaeda, except in the last three years.
Especially after the Americans attacked Al-majalah.
How did you first hear of the strikes that had happened on December 17th?
We got telephones from... from those people and of course the news word on Al Jazeera.
What was the news saying?
Our government attacked al-Qaeda base in Al-majalah where al-Qaeda have a field for training and they have huge stores for all kinds of weapons and missiles and rockets and... and they did not mention the Americans at all.
When we went there, we saw what happened
I mean, I mean, if somebody has got a weak heart, he will collapse.
You see goats and sheeps all over.
See the heads of those who were killed here and there.
You see children.
And you cannot tell this meat belongs to animals or to human beings.
Why did they do this?
Why did they had to do this?
There is no stores, there is no field for training, there is nobody, except a very poor tribe, one of the poorest tribes in the south.
AL MAJALAH
ABYAN PROVINCE
People saw the smoke and felt the earth shake.
They had never seen anything like it.
Iran to the area.
I found scattered bodies and injured women and children.
46 people were killed, including 5 pregnant women.
If they kill innocent children and call them al Qaeda, then we are all al Qaeda.
If children are terrorists, then we are all terrorists.
At 6 am they were sleeping and I was making bread.
When the missiles exploded,
I lost consciousness.
I didn't know what happened to my children, my daughter, my husband.
They all died.
Only I survived, along with this old man and my daughter.
Missiles attacked me.
And my brother Ibrahim.
And my mother.
Their hands were cut.
The echoes of Gardez were everywhere...
So many of the details repeating themselves.
But there was one important difference.
In Gardez, the American soldiers went to obscene lengths to cover up the killings.
Here in al-Majalah, despite the official denial, they'd left their fingerprints strewn across the desert.
Why would they deny something so obvious when anyone who visited the bomb site would see the truth?
But maybe that was the point.
There was no declared war in Yemen.
Out here, in the middle of the desert, no one was looking.
And the one local reporter investigating the bombing had disappeared.
The decision to arrest me was made the day I exposed the cover-up of the murder of women and children in Abyan.
The day I exposed those who sent cruise missiles to bedouin camps.
ABDULELAH HAIDER SHAYE
YEMENI JOURNALIST
Abdulelah Haider Shaye had traveled to al-Majalah immediately after the strike, and his reporting sparked national outrage.
Soon after, his house was raided by Yemen's American-trained counterterrorism forces.
Abdulelah was thrown in prison.
Posters demanding his return were hung around the capital.
ABDULRAH MAN BARMAN
ABDULELAH'S LAWYER
I met Abdulelah's lawyer at a teahouse because his office was under attack.
They fired over 120 shells into my office.
And now we can't reach it because the Republican Guard are deployed in the area.
In court, I noticed that one of
Abdulelah's teeth had been pulled.
And another had been broken.
And he had scars on his chest.
My understanding was that
President Ali Abdullah Saleh was going to pardon
Abdulelah Haider.
The president agreed to release him.
But that same day, the president got a call from Obama expressing concern about Abdulelah's release.
I'd heard the story many times in Yemen-
President Obama personally intervening to keep a respected Yemeni journalist in prison.
It sounded farfetched to me.
But then I found this on the White House's own website, a readout from a phone call between Obama and the
Yemeni president.
They badly misspelled
Abdulelah's name, but Obama's point was clear.
He wanted him kept in jail.
Al-Majalah was the first reported strike inside Yemen in seven years.
It was clearly a U.S.
Cruise missile that struck the Bedouin camp.
Since there was no declared war in Yemen,
I knew the strike was either JSOC or the CIA.
And then I found this photo.
The U.S. would have never released it, but Yemen's president posted it on his personal website- a presidential meeting with an important American guest, the head of the Joint
Special Operations Command,
Admiral William McRaven.
Joining us now is
Jeremy Scahill, national security correspondent for The Nation magazine.
His latest article is all about the U.S. relationship with Yemen.
Jeremy, thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
Back in New York,
I started writing stories about JSOC, their rise to lead force in Afghanistan, their covert strikes in Yemen, and it felt as though
I had crossed an invisible tripwire.
The reality is that
U.S. counterterrorism obsession with Yemen trumped concern for human rights.
- That's not true.
- And it's-
Well, it is true.
- It's not true.
Yup, back there.
Does the Pentagon have any comment on a report in The Nation today?
And my question is-
- Yeah, I guess- I-I-
- The question is- you keep denying covert operations.
Isn't this yet more evidence of one?
Okay.
Despite whatever conspiratorial theories that, you know, magazines or broadcast outlets may want to cook up, there's nothing to it.
So, Jeremy, let me ask you, have we been going into all of these countries over the past decade with drone attacks, dropping bombs in countries where we haven't declared war?
The lack of response from the major media and the CIA and all the rest of it suggests they're dismissing what you've done.
I receive a call, unprompted, from a Captain James Kirby, who is the spokesperson for Admiral Mike Mullen.
Calls me on my cell phone.
Wouldn't tell me how he got my cell phone number.
Wouldn't tell me who told him about the story.
This is hours from publication.
And told me that if we published this story in The Nation that I would be "on thin ice."
That was a direct quote.
And I said, "Well,
I want to know
"how you heard about this story, and I want to know how you got my number."
And he said, "Let's just say that I heard about it."
I wasn't sleeping well, and insomnia fueled my anxiety.
My computer had been hacked and part of my hard drive copied.
It was difficult not to feel a creeping sense of paranoia.
And then I got another strange phone call.
I had no idea why he called me or how he got my number.
I thought it might be a setup.
Every story I worked on seemed to trace back to JSOC.
And now, out of the blue, someone from the inside was reaching out to me.
I had met operators before in my research on Blackwater but no one as close to the heart of JSOC's covert operations.
He sent me photos of his DoD badges.
But I still couldn't help wondering, was I investigating JSOC, or were they investigating me?
Explain what JSOC is.
The Joint Special Operations Command handles all of the sensitive counterterrorism missions as the US government directs. And over time that was perverted into doing things that are far outside of its mandate.
What has JSOC been doing in Yemen?
Airstrikes...
Targeted killings.
Targeted killings inside the borders of Yemen?
Correct.
The world is a battlefield and we are at war.
Therefore the joint special operations command can go wherever they please, and do whatever it is that they want to do in order to achieve the national security objectives of whichever administration happens to be in power.
Were there ways that
JSOC was being used that you found objectionable?
I did.
There was... a lot of trepidation about what we were being asked to do, and where, and for what purpose.
A lot of it was of questionable legality,
And most of it was outside of any stated battlefield.
Kinetic operations, whether it's capture or kill, in some cases to detain people as directed by the United States government.
They launched their own internalized interrogation program, without the knowledge of the conventional U.S. military forces, or even the central intelligence agency.
Because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the program, there was a variety of abuses.
Torture?
I would say that, yes. The president has made a political and military calculation to let the Joint Special
Operations Command run wild.
So you're saying JSOC is able to hit harder under President Obama than they were under
President Bush?
Harder, faster, quicker, with the full support of the the white house.
On my last day in Sana'a, a file had been left for me at my hotel...
A leaked investigation into the strike of al-Majalah.
It included a list of the dead.
In Iraq, they had a deck of cards, a list of 55 names.
But the cards were not enough.
New lists were needed.
Longer lists.
At the end of each list, another and another, an endless list of names.
In al-Majalah, the list numbered 46.
14 of the names were women.
21 were children.
Who were they trying to kill?
A week after al-Majalah, there was another strike.
And this time, the
Yemeni government issued a press release naming the intended targets, but none of them had been killed.
For the first time, I had names on the kill list of people who were still alive.
Two of them were publicly known leaders:
Shihiri and Waheshi.
But the last name gave me a chill:
Anwar al-Awlaki.
I knew the name, but I couldn't believe
I was seeing it here on this list.
Awlaki was an American citizen.
The Christmas Day bombing attempt has everybody on alert tonight.
Investigators connecting the dots, and a key focus in the investigation is a radical Islamic cleric.
That man is Anwar al-Awlaki, an exiled American who was...
Just as I was investigating the expanding war in Yemen, it seemed Awlaki's name was everywhere.
The War on Terror suddenly had a new face.
Radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may now be as grave a threat as Osama bin Laden himself.
Awlaki, Holder says, is a clear and present danger.
He's an extremely dangerous man.
Does the U.S. have a preference in terms of al-Awlaki:
Dead, captured, or prosecuted?
Well, we certainly want to neutralize him, and we will do whatever we can in order to do that.
An American was on the kill list.
It felt to me like we'd walked off a cliff.
Awlaki had been sentenced to death without even being charged with a crime.
Awlaki's father filed a lawsuit with the help of the Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU.
He demanded that the government provide whatever evidence they had against his son.
But the government refused.
They had ordered the assassination of a U.S. citizen but said the evidence itself was too dangerous to be made public.
What kind of protections does this American have against being assassinated by his own government?
Yeah, it almost sounds kind of funny in an ironic way when you say that.
You know, you have the right not to be assassinated.
A bill was introduced in Congress to ban the extrajudicial assassination of Americans, but only six congressmen signed on.
And the people who should have known what was happening, the members of the intelligence committees, couldn't tell me anything.
When there is a lethal operation and a high-value person is killed, the president, of course, acknowledged that we killed-
- He can't-
- Huh?
SEN. RON WYDEN
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
Has there been any legal review of the potential for lethal operations against American citizens?
- Not to our knowledge.
- Is that classified?
It's important for the
American people to know when the President can kill an American citizen and when they can't.
And yet it is almost as if there are two laws in America, and the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret.
You're not permitted to disclose that difference publicly.
That's correct.
I wasn't surprised when Washington ignored the killings in Gardez.
But this was an
American citizen.
The country was now targeting one of its own.
Even John Walker Lindh, who'd taken up arms with the Taliban, was given a trial.
What had Awlaki done?
And why was the U.S. willing to cross such a dangerous line to have him killed?
I read everything I could about Awlaki.
It was obvious that he was an immensely popular preacher with a large following among young
English-speaking Muslims around the world.
On his blog, he openly praised some of the attacks against the U.S.
But this in itself was clearly not a crime.
I spoke with former CIA and military officials.
PHIL GIRALDI
CAREER CIA CASE OFFICER
They argued that
Awlaki's speeches were inspiring domestic terrorists.
EMILE NAKHLEH
CIA POLITICAL ISLAM DMSION
There were a lot of words
COL. PATRICK LANG
DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY from both Awlaki and the U.S.
Government but no concrete piece of evidence
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL that he was an operational figure
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL in any attacks.
I remembered seeing him on
TV nearly a decade earlier, just after 9/11.
ANWAR AL AWLAKI
FALLS CHURCH, VA - 2001
And it was difficult to reconcile the image of a new bin Laden with Awlaki's earlier sermons condemning terrorism.
The fact that the U.S. has administered the death and homicide of civilians in Iraq does not justify the killing of one U.S. Civilian in New York City or
Washington, D.C.
For a short time, Awlaki seemed like the go-to imam for journalists trying to understand the experience of
American Muslims in the wake of the attacks.
He was even profiled by the Washington Post for a piece about Ramadan.
After September 11th...
All of the feelings of the American Muslims were similar to everybody else in America:
Feelings of sympathy for the families of the victims and a sense of...
That whoever did this needed to be brought to justice.
A decade after this video was filmed,
Awlaki had become Public
Enemy Number One, his name at the very top of the kill list.
It felt like the War on
Terror was turning on itself.
I was now investigating the planned assassination of a U.S. Citizen- a watershed event.
SANA'A, YEMEN
For the first time,
I had the name of someone on the kill list who had not yet been killed.
Anwar al-Awlaki was now a wanted man hiding somewhere in the mountains of Yemen.
I knew I wouldn't be able to speak with Awlaki directly...
But through a series of intermediaries,
I managed to set up a meeting with his father.
I expected him to be reluctant to speak about his son, but he seemed happy to reminisce about an earlier time.
Anwar was an all-American boy.
This is in Disneyland, you know, in 1984, I think.
This is in San Diego when he was already an imam with a big beard, you know.
At that time, he was asking
Muslims to participate in the democratic process in America.
In fact, during the presidential campaign of George Bush, he thought the conservative Republicans will be better than the liberal Democrats, and he encouraged the Muslims there to elect George Bush.
Didn't he even, at one point, attend a luncheon at the Pentagon?
Yes.
You see, he liked America, and he wanted to stay and really-his life in America, but things came differently.
Can you explain to me why your son went into hiding?
After the incident of al-Majalah and Anwar was all over the news, the drones started to fly over Shabwah.
So, you know, Anwar was really concerned.
And so we took his family with us, and he left to the mountains.
Hmm?
Myself, at this age in my life,
I really cannot ever replace, you know, the role of my son as he was doing for his family.
From my reading of the history of your son, from his writing, it seemed as though there was a transformation that happened politically for him from 9/11 to the invasion of Iraq.
Something started to change in his tone.
Yes.
Anwar became popular before September 11th because his sermons and his tapes, you know, were very popular all over the
English-speaking world.
And then the invasion came in 2003, and they invaded Iraq and destroyed Iraq, so Anwar really started to be more vocal in his speeches against what the
Americans were doing against Muslims all over the world.
There's no doubt that your son praised some of the attacks against the U.S.
And for many Americans, it was enough to say,
"Anwar al-Awlaki is a terrorist."
But also, I want decent American lawyer to tell me that it is right for the United States government to kill an American citizen on the basis that he said something against the United States or against American soldiers.
I mean, I-I don't understand.
I don't understand 100% the
American Constitution, but I don't believe
American law will allow the killing of an
American citizen because he said something against the United States.
Anwar's father may have been calling for justice under American law, but American drones were already flying overhead.
The fact that they were trying to kill an American citizen was shocking enough.
But there was another reason
Awlaki's story haunted me.
We are against evil, and America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil.
How can your conscience allow you to...
Awlaki seemed to have embraced the very identity he once opposed:
The military jacket, the black flag, the unequivocal call for armed jihad.
I specifically invite the youth to either fight in the West or join their brothers in the fronts of jihad.
The all-American boy was gone and so was the moderate imam.
But why?
Awlaki was deeply affected by the War on Terror both abroad and at home.
The day after September 11th, a woman stumbled into his mosque in Virginia after being beaten with a baseball bat.
More than 1,200
Muslims were detained across the country.
You have Muslims who are locked up in jail and are left to rot in there.
There are no charges brought against them.
What have you done for them?
Awlaki resigned from the mosque soon after and left the country.
But the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq followed.
And, well, this is a new kind of- a new kind of evil.
And this-this-this-this- this crusade...
Is gonna take a while.
Awlaki began to see the expanding wars as part of a global attack against Islam, and his sermons reflected a growing anger.
We are watching one Muslim nation fall after another, and we're watching, sitting back, doing nothing.
After 9/11,
Awlaki was put under surveillance, detained at airports, and repeatedly interrogated by the FBI.
When he returned to Yemen, local officials arrested him on orders from Washington.
He was locked up for a year and a half without charge and spent 17 months in solitary confinement.
When he was finally released,
Awlaki was a changed man.
And after JSOC tried to kill him, his transformation was complete.
Eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself...
This is not a war of choice.
Just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.
This is a war of necessity.
They seemed like mirror images of one another, strangely distorted,
America's wars and Awlaki's words.
This will not be quick...
War against Islam and Muslim...
Nor easy.
Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the United States had helped create the very man it was now trying to kill.
America was my home.
Those who attacked
America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again.
Awlaki's journey, from a voice of moderation to one of retribution, cut to the heart of the larger story
I was investigating.
[Indistinct conversations]
Anybody...
Anybody belongs to al-Qaeda...
I'd seen the same pattern repeatedly.
America was trying to kill its way to victory.
Now got a new target list...
But the War on Terror was producing new enemies wherever it spread.
How did this grow?
How does a war like that ever end?
Good evening.
Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda.
Again, for those just joining us,
Osama bin Laden is dead, and one confirmation we're getting indicates that this is a special operations raid.
And I think an organization we're gonna hear a lot about in the coming days is JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.
So much for secrecy.
So much for cover-ups.
The forces I'd been trying to unmask since Gardez were suddenly national heroes.
The operation was called Neptune Spear.
To capture or kill bin Laden.
It felt like the world had turned upside down.
JSOC, long shrouded in secrecy, was becoming a household name.
But what did it really mean?
The White House circulated a photo from the night of the raid, perhaps as a picture of transparency.
Everyone was in the room:
Secretary of State,
Secretary of Defense,
Vice President,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the President himself.
But it was the seating arrangement that interested me.
The man at the head of the table wasn't the commander in chief.
It was McRaven's assistant at JSOC,
General Webb.
McRaven himself was running the operation from Afghanistan.
USA! USA! USA! USA!
I wasn't mourning bin Laden's death, but I wasn't celebrating either.
After ten years, I understood that people wanted closure.
But it didn't feel like V-E Day to me.
Didn't feel like victory at all.
The leader of al-Qaeda is dead, but a new one has taken his place.
Your mission will be to ensure he meets the same end.
Hearing JSOC mentioned on television was jolting enough, but when I saw the admiral in front of the cameras, it felt like I'd walked through the looking glass.
I am deeply honored that the
President has nominated me to serve as the next
SOCOM commander.
And if confirmed...
William McRaven was now the toast of Washington.
Admiral McRaven, by leading the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, you and your men won an enduring place in American military history.
Like all of my colleagues,
I salute you and your colleagues' and the SEALs' extraordinary operations.
Thank you for your service.
Thank you, sir.
When the congratulations subsided, the senators turned to the real purpose of the hearings.
Are you prepared and capable to expand your operations at a moment's notice worldwide?
As we look out from
Iraq, Afghanistan, and, frankly, across the globe, as we look at hot spots in Yemen where you have al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia where you have
East African al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab, now, these are clearly areas of concern...
People in the streets may have hoped the War on Terror was finally over.
But in Washington, in the corridors of power, a new chapter had just begun.
Right now, it's kinetic.
Hard kill.
If it's not hard kill, doesn't get played.
MALCOLM NANCE
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE
Soon after the bin Laden strike,
I met Malcolm Nance, a legend in the world of covert ops who'd trained countless Navy SEALs and other JSOC operators.
I'm a firm believer in targeted assassination.
If they are too strong for your ability to negate their capacity in the battlefield, then you're just gonna have to put a hellfire in.
If they're- if they are dangerous on a strategic scale like Anwar al-Awlaki from Yemen- definitely has a missile in his future.
No longer cloaked in secrecy, special ops seemed to be enjoying their moment in the sun.
You know, we went in, we did the drone strike, and-or hellfire strike, and we blasted the individual car of a known guy who was known to be in that vehicle.
And we flew in, and we snatched his body- we confirmed it- got the intelligence, went away.
That's the way we should be doing it.
The first time we met, he'd called me out of the blue.
This time, it was me who called.
JSOC may no longer have been a secret, but that didn't mean we knew the truth.
We're now seeing the effects of covert intervention in countries on multiple continents without any thought to future repercussions.
And it is radically expanded.
At one point it was 40 countries.
It is now expanded to over 75.
And there are dozens, if not hundreds, of concurrent operations.
But, in theory, Congress is supposed to have oversight of these operations.
They don't want to step into the dark and see what goes on behind the curtain.
Joint Special Operations Command became a paramilitary arm of the administration.
And billions upon billions of dollars was poured into JSOC.
What we have essentially done is created one hell of a hammer.
And for the rest of our generation, for the rest of my lifetime, this force will be continually searching for a nail.
Bin Laden's death had given the War on Terror new life.
After 9/11, there were seven people on the kill list.
In Iraq, 55 on the deck of cards.
By Afghanistan, there were thousands.
But now the list itself was changing.
Signature strikes,
TADS, crowd killing- a target list was no longer needed to justify a strike like al-Majalah.
All boys over the age of 15, all men under the age of 70 were now fair game in targeted areas.
Like a flywheel, the global War on Terror was spinning out of control.
When I began this story, the U.S. was at war in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
The bombing in al-Majalah brought me to Yemen.
But the list of countries where U.S. Special Forces were operating had grown, just as the kill list had.
Algeria, Indonesia,
Thailand, Panama, Jordan- the world was now a battlefield.
It was hard to know where to go next.
In Pakistan, the U.S. was launching weekly drone strikes.
In Mali, they were hunting al-Qaeda.
In Latin America, targeting drug cartels.
I decided to go to Somalia, where an escalated kill/capture program was under way.
Just as McRaven had testified, the war was erupting in East Africa.
Drone strikes were increasing.
There were suicide bombings in Kampala and Mogadishu.
And JSOC was on the ground, snatching bodies and flying them back to ships in the Arabian Sea.
ADEN ADDE AIRPORT
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA
Almost as soon as I arrived,
I sensed that things weren't going to go well.
Mogadishu was seeing its worst fighting in years, and there were no foreign journalists left in the city.
My local contact, Bashir Osman, was worried about my safety.
Okay?
It's okay.
All right.
It was a strange feeling, traveling with a dozen armed men in a decoy car.
I still had my reporter's notebook, but what could I learn in conditions like these?
Before arriving in Somalia,
I had read reports that the U.S. was outsourcing the kill lists to local warlords.
Among the most powerful in Mogadishu was Yusuf Mohamed Siad, known by everyone as Indha Adde,
"White Eyes."
GEN. INDHA ADDE
US-BACKED SOMALI ARMY
In an earlier life, Indha Adde had been America's enemy, offering protection to people on the U.S. kill list.
But the warlord had since changed sides.
He was now on the U.S. payroll and assumed the title of general.
So he's saying that the fiercest fighting that they're doing right now is happening right here.
Okay.
The men fired across the rooftops, but it didn't make sense to me what we were doing here...
Or what the Americans were doing here in Somalia, arming this warlord-turned-general for what seemed like a senseless war.
We got to move.
So these were Shabaab fighters you buried here?
Yes, two, uh-huh.
If we capture foreign fighters alive, we bury them.
We kill them when we catch them.
If you capture a foreigner alive, you execute them on the battlefield?
Yes.
So that other foreigners expect no mercy.
[Indistinct conversations]
How did the Americans find men like Indha Adde?
And to what end?
After a decade of covert war,
Somalia was in ruins.
Half the country was ruled by the local al-Qaeda affiliate, the other half by men like the general, wandering the streets with an endless kill list and a band of men.
[Indistinct conversations]
Every time we stopped, people looked at us nervously, and I was told that my very presence was endangering them.
Bashir would insist we leave moments after we arrived.
Okay, we go.
I wanted to see beneath the surface of the war to understand what it meant to ordinary Somalis.
[Indistinct conversations]
But I was passed from warlord to warlord and soon realized the only people
I'd be able to meet were men with guns.
You know when you are fighting with enemy,
any option is open.
No mercy.
MOHAMMED QANYARE
US-BACKED WARLORD
For years, Mohamed Qanyare was Washington's man in Mogadishu.
His methods were extreme, but Washington insisted
Qanyare's services were vital to their kill campaign.
Who were the people that the Americans wanted your help tracking?
No, I don't want to talk that.
You don't want to talk about that.
I don't.
Did they offer to fund any operations?
That one also, no comment.
You don't want to comment on that.
No comment.
But you're targeting people for the Americans.
Yes, we arrest and interrogate and release if we don't see nothing.
That's our business.
And when these
American operations kill innocent people, what's the impact?
America knows war.
They are war masters.
They knows better than me. So when they're funding a war, they know how to fund it.
They don't need even to touch to tell them.
They know very well.
They are teachers. Great teachers.
A roadside bomb blast hit a minibus full of civilians.
Three people died on the spot and many others were injured as well.
They're all being taken to Madina Hospital?
For over a decade,
JSOC and the CIA had free rein in Somalia.
All their tactics were on display- drone strikes, night raids, mercenaries.
As the War on Terror entered a second decade,
Somalia seemed like a laboratory of the future, and the future looked bleak.
KENYA-SOMALIA BORDER
I was ready to leave Somalia and decided to call my editor.
But the news from home what not what I expected.
Anwar al-Awlaki was dead, killed in a drone strike authorized by the
President himself.
Another name struck from the list.
I wanted to go home, to be done with it all.
But I couldn't.
SANA'A, YEMEN
I got another call, and this one left me stunned.
Two weeks after al-Awlaki's death, the U.S. had launched another strike in Yemen.
Another American had been killed.
But this time, it was a teenage boy.
They had killed Anwar al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son,
Abdulrahman.
I returned to Sana'a, but I wasn't sure why.
Was it to file another story?
To investigate another crime?
Or was it to apologize?
Abdulrahman left without telling us.
He said in a small note that he's going to look for his father.
He left from the kitchen window, and he took a bus to the governorate of Shabwah.
Then when his father was killed, his grandmother told him,
"There is no use for you to stay anymore."
And he said, "Yes, I will come back in two days."
On the morning of October 15th, we got a telephone call, and they told us he was blown up to pieces by the drone.
And they saw only the back of his hair.
You know, his relative, his cousin, he knew his hair from the back, and he recognize it, and he knew that Abdulrahman really was dead.
But they could not recognize his face or anything else.
I always teased with him about his, you know, big- his hair, you know, that he should cut it, because I thought that he should do that.
The drone had not just killed the boy, it vanished him.
I asked to see photos of Abdulrahman and suddenly realized why I was here.
It wasn't to investigate another death.
I wanted to see him when he was still alive.
[Indistinct conversations]
Abdulrahman's grandmother was in mourning but sat down with me for a moment to talk.
What did Abdulrahman do?
Who ordered the killing of Abdulrahman?
He was sitting, having dinner with his friends.
How come he was killed?
What did he do?
You know, Abdulrahman was...
He was a very, very gentle boy, and he never hurt anybody.
I tried to make sense of Abdulrahman's death.
His father's could at least be explained.
But a teenager with a Facebook page and a group of adolescent friends, why would his name have been put on the list?
What could he possibly have done?
The Americans said
Abdulrahman was collateral damage, but they offered no explanation for the strike.
And unlike Gardez, they made no apology.
It seemed an impossible coincidence.
They killed the father and then the son.
But maybe it was as simple as that.
Like a tale from
Greek mythology,
Abdulrahman was killed not for what he'd done but for who he might one day become...
A twisted logic, a logic without end.
Nasser had lost his firstborn son and his first grandson.
But what did we lose when the drone struck
Abdulrahman and his teenage friends?
When I first visited Gardez,
I had no idea where the story would lead me.
I didn't know just how much the world had changed...
Or how much the journey would change me.
But I realize now the story has no end.
Somehow, in front of our eyes, undeclared wars have been launched in countries across the globe, foreigners and citizens alike assassinated by presidential decree...
The War on Terror transformed into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
How does a war like this ever end?
And what happens to us when we finally see what's hidden in plain sight?
END
All right, this is what's going on.
Me, O'Bizzle-- O'Bizzle.
- I got it, l got it, man I'm the narrator.
- O'Bizzle fo' shizzle.
Me, Peebs, and Kim.
Kim, you got something to say?
- Yeah, you got something to say.
- Kim?
You all know tonight is going to going to be crazy.
Stupid crazy.
What's your sole mission, O'Byrne?
Man, to keep you out of hand.
You can't-- you can't tame the beast.
Peebs, tell them. How do we roll?
Got 'em. Got 'em.
Tune in next time where we're going to be still loνing life and getting ready to go to war.
- What?
- All right, baby.
- War, Afghanistan, what?
- Say it again, baby, say it again.
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- Baby.
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- We're going to war. We're going to war.
We're going to war. We're going to war.
Roger.
Oh, we're fucking hit.
- This is an lED, over.
- lED.
- Keep going, keep going! Keep--
- What was that?
- Shots.
- Eight o'clock.
- Get on that gun!
- What are we doing?
Aim for that draw! Right now!
That way.
We gotta get out. We gotta get out of here.
We're getting out!
Fucking motherfucker.
Shot, eight o'clock. 300 meters.
Shot, eight o'clock. 102 meters.
You know what?
When they told me
I was going to the Korengal Valley, l really didn't, uh, I didn't read anything up on it. l didn't want to.
I wanted to go in there with an open mind.
The Colonel told me initially they take fire every single day.
I was like, God, how the hell do you take fire every single day from somebody?
You got to go out there and go kill the damn enemy.
Quit being, you know, scared.
Go out there and get 'em.
And the Colonel and I came up with, you know, what we thought was going to be our campaign plan and that, uh, after two months of being there I would fix it and that we wouldn't get shot at anymore.
The very first day, l remember coming in, and one of the pilots and stuff, and they said, hey, if you look over there to your left, uh, that's Pakistan.
You know, and we're like, you know, we all, okay, that's Pakistan.
And then they're all mountains, you know, high elevation.
And as you go in elevation, it starts to get a little bit colder.
And then we go up into the Korengal Valley.
I remember looking out the little bubble windows on the side, kind of just like this, because I was right next to the window.
And I could see when the Chinook had made a hard right turn into the valley.
I was like, holy shit.
We're not ready for this.
We flew around for about half- hour,
45 minutes above the KOP, and you're just looking down there, and you're like, this is in the middle of nowhere right now.
You're away from everything.
Honestly, when I first got to the Korengal,
I was like, this is a shit hole.
My mindset was like, oh snap,
I'm going to die here. l remember getting off the bird and walking up the hill to the hooch.
Hey, Jones, you guys standing up right there, you're wrong.
Come on, guys, better get moving.
And just sucking... and thinking what are we doing?
It started getting dark, and monkeys were howling,
And l thought they were Taliban.
And I thought, holy shit they're close.
Everybody's like, oh, you're going to the Korengal?
And they feel sorry for you and everything like that.
I'm like, dude, it can't be that bad, you know?
I show up there and you're burning your own feces.
You know, you're living in a tent.
I literally lived in a bunker, you know, about that high, I couldn't even stand up in.
See bullet holes all rattled into the Hescos and when you look up, it's like,
I don't even know why I have Hescos here because they're not going to stop the bullets that are coming down from the mountains.
So I felt like l was--
I was like fish in a barrel.
They're gathering intel right now, basically, on how to deal with us, because they haven't-- there's no really research or intel on how to treat us right now, because they haven't had to deal with people like us since World War ll and Vietnam, you know, dealing with guys that are coming back from 15-month deployments with as much fighting, you know, as we went through.
Hey, go on that ridgeline, fucking now!
Hey, roger, I'm up here by OP four.
We're scanning and if we have to, we'll move into contact.
I got myself, Riegel, and Thomas over here.
Roger, over.
Hey, I'm about to find this bastard, and I'm going to kill him, over.
Okay, roger.
So it's coming from 1705 and 00.
We should be firing on those here right now, break.
Hang it!
Fire! Firing!
The Korengal Outpost is at the 6-3 gridline, and then the 6-2 gridline-- the insurgency has, like, drawn this imaginary line in the sand there, and every time the guys come out of Firebase Phoenix and they cross the 6-2 gridline,
I mean, like, no shit, every time they cross the 6-2 gridline, they get in contact.
So I want to extend the security bubble, because wherever I can place troops and wherever I can provide security is where l'm going to be able to have an influence on the populace.
The hard part is, is that they're so deeply rooted down here because of family ties and because of religious ideals, that getting these people to push out the insurgency and basically push out their family members is going to be the hard part.
Right now the road ends at the Korengal Outpost, and where the road ends is where the Taliban begins.
We've been getting reports that they've been watching us throughout the day, so the contact right now
I'd say is likely or imminent.
- Good to see you.
- Move southeast. It's this way.
Do you want chai?
We don't have time to sit down and have chai tonight.
I just wanted to come in and talk to you briefly about the project.
How many people are you actually going to use to build the project?
What's up?
You see that last house, to the right of it?
Brownish fucking bush about fucking 15, 20 meters to the right?
Yeah?
Someone turned around that corner, saw us and went right back around, dude.
We're going to be moving in darkness.
You're going to be lead, so...
We could move now if you need to.
Okay, spread out.
I'm pushing up here.
Whoa, a tracer came right by here!
Hey!
There's fire coming. They're shooting.
Over there!
Where? Over where?
Tell me, sir, tell me.
Kim!
The first friend I lost was Vimoto, and that was right at the beginning of the deployment. That hit hard.
And then a month after that, I lost Restrepo.
The day that Restrepo got killed, it came across the net that we had troops in contact.
Then they called back in and said that we have a casualty.
I need you to give me fire, Cortez.
We didn't know who it was, because nobody was saying anything over the radio.
When you hear someone's hit, your first reaction is just like, fuck, like, no.
And then you start going through your head all the people that you know out there and wanting to eliminate your friends and the people that were closest to you-- you know, not this guy.
Not this guy. Not this guy.
You know, your heart just sank.
You were like, fuck.
I mean, it was Doc Restrepo.
He was shot in the neck twice... but he was stable, so that was a relief for us.
We say, okay, he's going to be okay, because we looked at him. when he gets on the aircraft, he's still breathing.
But he, it hit his, um, artery in his neck, and he bled out.
He bled out on the helicopter ride to the emergency room where they take you when you get shot.
- This is the big danger area right now.
- Okay.
Because if we're here and they start opening up on us...
You're in between.
But if we clear down, you guys could use my weapons squad as an indicator for where they are, and that's your right limit of fire, man.
Shoot anything up the mountain.
I would say since we haven't been down here and we don't know what's in here,
I'm going to fucking assume the worst, because it's near Kalaygal, and that they have fortified fighting positions throughout here.
Okay.
What were we doing in the Korengal?
Our purpose in the Korengal-- they had a road, and the intent was this road to go through the Korengal and go out to Chowkay Valley to be able to connect the locals where they can have an easy route up towards the Pech River Valley.
And our job there was to try to sustain the security for the personnel, to allow them to build that road.
You know, five, ten years from now, the Korengal Valley is going to have a road going through it that's paved.
And we can make more money, make you guys richer, make you guys more powerful.
What l need though, is l need you to join with the government, you know, provide us with that security or help us provide you guys with that security.
And I'll flood this whole place with money and with projects and with healthcare and with everything.
Remember last week when we said that everything that happened in the past when Captain McKnight was here-- we're kind of, like, wiping the slate clean.
Captain Kearney's got a new slate.
Let's put it behind, and let's get on with what we've got to do now.
Growing up in Oregon, I wasn't allowed to have sugar 'til I was, like, 13, because my mom was a fucking hippie.
And she's always have us doing, like, little hippie children things, I guess-- making, like, homemade paper or painting something or going, like, on nature walks.
It was a nice childhood.
I just wasn't allowed to have toy guns or anything like that, like boys should have, l guess-- little toy guns or, like, violent video games or watch any violent movies at all.
Like l had a toy squirt gun that was a turtle, and my parents took it away because it said "squirt gun"-- it had "gun" on there.
Fire!
Right now priority...
For the first few months of the deployment... we'd get rocked hard. They'd hit us from...
They'd ambush us at 360 degrees.
I remember thinking, you know, holy shit, did everybody from the entire country come to this valley?
Is nobody else fighting anymore? ls every bad guy in my face?
Oh, shit!
Motherfuckers.
In the entire country of Afghanistan, we dropped something close to 70 percent of all the ordinance.
All the bombs that were dropped at that particular time were dropped in the Korengal Valley.
As CNN dubbed it one day when Bush saw it and said, you know, the ugliest place on Earth-- the Korengal Valley.
But to my family,
I never really told them much until about halfway into the deployment.
I didn't tell them when Vimoto died.
I didn't tell them when Sergeant Padilla lost his arm.
I didn't tell them when Pisec got shot.
I didn't tell them when Restrepo got killed.
And then when Restrepo got killed was a few days before my mom's birthday also.
So I had to... I had to suck it up when I called my mom on her birthday and act like everything was okay and say
"Hey, Mom, happy birthday," you know, like, "Yeah, I am doing really good out here, everything's fine."
The change came when we in OP Restrepo.
In the middle of the night we put up a firebase on top of the place that they had used as their enemy kinetic, you know, point of attack, or of origin of their attack, for the last 15 months.
We walked up the Spur with shovels and picks.
We worked all though the night just to make a small semicircle to chill in.
We slept for maybe a couple hours each, started doing it again.
That day we got in five, seven firefights.
Everybody good?
- Yeah, we're gonna--
- Yeah!
We'd dig. They'd shoot at us.
They'd see us digging, building this new place. They'd shoot.
We'd shoot back. Once it lulled down, we started digging again.
When the boys built that base, the Taliban, or the AAF forces in the valley, they were completely in shock.
It was like a middle finger sticking out.
And they realized once they could not knock off OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand.
They started becoming afraid.
Eat some, turban head!
Hey, hit the bottom right.
Hit the bottom right of the village.
- Get this!
- Bottom right. Go right more.
Hey, Solo, that's you.
I'm not shooting over everybody.
- Let's go, let's go!
- He's down in the draw!
- He's down in the draw.
- Down in the draw.
How close?
Buno, get your coms up.
Make sure you got fucking SAW and a.203 with you.
- You're taking Wilson, Cortez.
- Cortez.
Don't worry, I'll...
Don't worry. There's very few that l just straight up hope don't make it.
A month or two into it, it was still a shitty place. We were covered in dirt, digging all the time, getting in firefights, like four or five firefights a day.
And so we-- the majority of us really didn't feel like it should be called OP Restrepo. it was just a shitty place. It was just...
It just didn't resemble the type of person that he was.
Scuffing up my notes.
Feels like longer than forever, yeah
My home is now a distant land
If l had one wish, I wish I could be
Back on that rock in the middle of the sea
My heart is calling me to the islands
Blue skies and tropical breeze
I want to go back home
Swim in the Pacific sea
You can take the boy from the island
But not the island from the boy
The island stays in your heart
I'll never forget where l'm from
Oh, no, I'll never forget
Where l'm from
Sir. How you doing, sir?
Good to see you again.
Good seeing you again.
Welcome to the KOP.
I'd like to take you up over there, sir, maybe just try to give you the once over the world here.
This is the southern Korengal.
This is, uh, l guess you could call it, this is the war zone.
This is where it's all happening.
This is where the majority of the population of the Korengal lives and probably about 90% of the fighting.
If you look just to the south here to that third spur that you see down there, which is called Honcho Hill, that is like the enemy-- I guess you could say-- limit of advance for us.
Like, we can't go any further south than that.
- What do you call it-- Honcho?
- Honcho Hill.
- Honcho Hill.
- You follow that spur, and you go all the way up here,
Sergeant Major,
- and you might be able to see that--
- The tip of the... that top of the OP.
You can see all the bee huts and stuff.
That's OP Restrepo.
Everything south of that is the enemy sanctuary.
Battle 6, Battle 2-5,
I have around 15 up near Restrepo.
Nothing out of the ordinary as far as movement in the southwest today.
Nothing but women and children out tending to the fields and crops.
Enemy assessment-- we've got the AAF are in the final stages to start their attack and moving and getting everything in place.
Last 24, conduct a movement to contact into Loy Kalay, separate the AAF from the populace in order to spread new lO themes.
Hey, Cunningham, on a side note, how's the fam?
How's the what?
- The fam.
- The family?
Billy.
Good. They're pretty good.
Were they happy to see your crazy self?
Yeah, yeah, it was a good time, man.
Got to hang out at the ranch and everything like that, you know?
Got to see pretty much everyone in the family almost.
Your family owns a ranch?
Of course.
Like cows and pigs and chickens and horses ranch?
No.
Like what kind of ranch, then?
It's like a ranch just with like land, you know, with gates and stuff and trucks and whatnot.
Some guns, some wildlife, you know, that you shoot at.
Okay, so it's just a whole bunch of land that they kill stuff on.
Yeah. It's kind of like this.
Yeah, but we're not hunting animals, we're hunting people.
Hearts and minds.
Fucking feed tray.
Yeah. We'll take their hearts, and we'll take their minds.
All right, listen up. Today we're going to conduct a movement to contact.
The purpose is to talk to the locals about some lO themes, as far as the road construction team coming in.
Get some workers from their village to take part in that.
Talk about the cow incident.
- Also...
- It was delicious.
Talk about anything out of the ordinary as far as AAF moving in through their area.
See if they can give us any information on that.
Anyone have any questions?
Guys, it's gonna suck, but I'm going to work you guys into the ground.
I need you guys to go out there and do a patrol in the village because l need you to keep the enemy off his toes. l need you to go out there and push the enemy back so we can buy some white space, so you guys can go back up there and work your asses off filling up these sandbags so that you guys, when do get hit, you get hit but you got something to hide behind.
And the best defense is who has the greater offense.
Elevation 1-5-7-9.
And we are set in Koringal.
What's your father do?
A shepherd? What do you do?
Are you a shepherd, too?
Let me see your hands.
Your hands.
He's got pretty clean hands for being a goat herder.
Where'd you get that watch, man?
You guys got a lot of goats?
60 goats.
60 goats?
That's pretty wealthy, right, Abdul?
Yeah.
Well, what do you know about the people in Kalaygal?
He says...
Roger, we haven't found anybody else to talk to.
We're going to start pushing back now.
Hey, 2-2, this is Bravo 1.
Start pushing out towards the trail.
Oh, fuck.
What have they got?
Oh, I guess a guy running.
- A guy running?
- Yeah.
Hey, Liz!
Lookit. See?
We've seen a guy run from that house once or twice before.
I just don't like the way it is.
I don't like how it feels right now.
You want him watching towards the village or down in the draw?
- Towards the back side of the house.
- Watch the back side of the house.
Hey!
Sit down.
They found a BDU top.
I've got eyes on it right now, over.
Hey, keep on searching this whole house. Search.
Yeah, yeah, like this, good. Okay.
Who does this belong to?
Never mind.
Hey...
"lf I go with you,
I'm not going to go with you right now.
- I will come back to the KOP."
- No, no, he's going-- he's coming with us.
This guy, he was already at the house.
This guy came up later, saw us, and starting taking off running.
I got him, and ever since he started doing what he's doing now.
Hey, tell these guys I'm gonna sit them in my truck, they need to sit on their hands.
Right now what we're tracking came in the valley on April the 11 th.
There's fifteen 107-milimeter rockets, several cases of PKM and AK ammo.
The fear is always there, especially at night when you can't see what's coming at you.
When we started there, we only had maybe fourteen guys up there.
I mean, it doesn't take much.
A few automatic weapons will keep, you know, a squad pinned down, while they could easily come up from a side and flank you and, you know, go basically clear house.
Nobody's going to help you.
You're in no man's land.
The KOP is only seven hundred, eight hundred meters away, but that might as well be in a different country because they're not getting to you.
Not in time.
KOP's taking indirect right now.
KOP's taking indirect.
Can't see shit what they're doing.
Day sight. lt's something.
Better than anything else we got.
I need more fucking 240 here!
One's by Karingal, the other's by Dallas.
Right up there.
The birds we love.
Okay, roger, he's pretty much worked the Honcho Hill ridge.
Want to push him southeast up to 3-0, just southeast of that.
Big firefight, great.
Fucking packing up rounds.
That was fun, though, man, that was fun.
You can't get a better high.
It's like crack, you know?
You can sky dive or bungee jump or do, you know, kayak, but once you've been shot at, you really can't come down.
There's nothing, you can't top that.
How are you going to go back to the civilian world then?
I have no idea.
Hey, did you hear me go cyclic?
- I had the barrel smoked!
- Did you hear me?
Yeah, what the fuck was that first batch about, cuz?
You was crazy as shit with that.
Hey, soon as I popped my head up, holy-- Guess who.
And you just slid down the stairs.
- Common game planning. l was like...
- Get down!
The flight path over...
He's an excellent cook, by far the best cook in the Korengal, definitely.
Came up to Restrepo one time, cooked us fresh cow, same-day cow.
That was a good day.
Jonesie, you want another grill, man?
You all right?
No, l don't like to fuck on a full stomach.
Dude, we're on TV.
Come in here for the real thing.
Don't fight it, don't fight it.
Why don't they mess with you anymore, man?
I was one of the first ones that got messed with to begin with.
Well, look at him, look how sexy he is.
I mean, look at this guy.
He's a beautiful man.
I'd fuck him back in the States.
Let's talk about the road between Omar and Kandalay.
What guy?
Who did we detain?
He says that you detain a guy.
Haji Se, Haji Se.
Naiim was dropped off by another local in Kalaygal who told us that he was bad and that he was working with Sadikula in the-- what the fuck is Sadikula in charge of, Rudy, the Mujahadeen?
Yeah, he's working with the Muj.
And, he was working with the Mujahadeen.
I told you guys from the very get go that if somebody says that they're bad,
I have to investigate it.
So now NDS is talking to him.
He's not in jail.
He's not being treated bad, he's being talked to and asked questions.
I think we've been pretty upfront about how we handle people that we talk to and question.
We've been pretty fair. l'm not like Jim McKnight where l take all these guys and stick them in Bagram and they never come back.
He says were happy you're here, you're doing very well, but he's saying that you detained
Mohammed Youssef before, now Mohammed Youssef didn't come back.
Rudy, who the fuck is Mohammed Youssef?
Mohammed Kalam's son, the guy that cut the worker's heads off.
That's because I saw the video where he cut their heads off.
I saw him do it.
I saw him with my own two eyes.
You're not understanding that I don't fucking care.
And the thing that's sad to me is that as much as Captain Kearney go down there and conduct different Shuras and tell them about the positives about what we can do to help them, it seemed like it didn't go anywhere.
You know?
It seemed like everything that he-
We took one step forward and it seemed like they took two steps backwards.
We've got three village elders just come down and they want to talk.
Not sure what they want to talk about yet.
It's a good sign.
It's the first time it's happened up here at OP Restrepo.
We've had people come in-- elders come in and say before that they wanted to provide some information, but never shown up to us, you know, come back and talk to us.
So this is a positive sign.
Do you hear about the cow that--
- The cow?
- Yeah, the US soldiers kill it.
- They killed--
- Yeah.
So they came because of that.
They want to get information about the cow that--
He is the owner of cow.
All right, the cow?
The reason why we killed it because it ran into our constantine wire and it was mangled inside the constantine wire, so we had to kill it to put it out of its misery because if we would have got it out, it would have been useless.
- That's why we killed it.
- They are asking because it was illegal.
- lllegal?
- Yeah, illegal.
- To kill it?
- Yeah.
- What do you want to do?
- Just tell them.
What do they want us to do about the cow?
Do they want to be reimbursed somehow or--
He says that it is up to you, if you want to pay money for that or--
How much does a cow cost?
It's going to be like four or five hundred dollars, which is going to be twenty, twenty five thousand Afghani, over.
Did we kill this cow?
Well, it was tangled up in a wire, pretty much dead.
324 ended up cutting it up. Over.
We're not going to be able to give him money in exchange for his cow.
But what we can give him is the rice, the beans, the sugar.
Now, the HA that they will receive is going to be, you know, the weight of the cow.
Whatever the weight of the cow was will be the weight of return of HA as far as rice, beans, sugar.
- ls that good?
- They want money.
We're not going to be able to give them the money.
If that's all he came for, he's not going to get it.
626 perstat, I have 20 at Restrepo,
15 at the KOP, 4 at OP1,
4 on leave,
6 ANA and one terp at Restrepo, break.
Talk louder, nobody can hear you down here, over.
626 perstat,
I have 20 at Restrepo,
15 at the KOP,
4 at OP1,
4 on leave,
1 photo journalist,
6 ANA, and 1 terp--
I didn't know they had algebra two.
Yeah! Burning the poop!
Got the black man on the burning the poop detail.
Hey, man, just watch yourself, God damn it.
Second platoon killed that cow and now I gotta pay for it.
I still wanna see Spanky and Vaughn go at it.
- Vaughn would fucking destroy Spanky.
- Let's go get him.
Vaughn!
Vaughn, you're going to beat Spanky's ass!
He's coming up here, you better not lose.
Dude, if you lose, so help me God.
It's going to reflect poorly on me if you lose.
You better not let that cherry bitch beat you.
Make him tough.
Get him, get him.
- Vaughn.
- What's up, dude?
- Come on, fight back!
- You're such a little bitch.
All right, go ahead.
- Stretch them out.
- What the fuck, Spanky?
You gonna let him fucking manhandle you?
- Let him get tired.
- Flip over, man.
Yeah, there you go!
Nice, there you go.
You suck!
Battle of the cherries.
We're not talking about cherry in the army either, we're talking about cherry at life.
Vaughn here is very cherry at life.
But we're making him into a man.
That's all that's important here.
...we talked about the road being built.
Continued to hear from the elders that they don't want to give up any workers, despite what it is that you all have been telling me.
So if you guys get these local-- that are willing to do that to come and start getting them jobs immediately, to bypass all the elder-- l don't think--
I think they're just--
If we really fucked them up like they said, then they are just chilling, trying to recuperate.
It's just like what we would be doing.
You know, seven-- eight dudes wounded,
I mean seven dudes wounded, one dude dead, we wouldn't be going out strong.
We'd be resting at Blessing right now.
You know what I mean?
That's what I think they're doing-- resting.
Are you wondering why it is so quiet?
Yeah, it's got me baffled right now.
Baffled or worried?
Just confused.
I am at a loss for words right now.
He's worried.
He's worried. He's scared.
Most scared.
Or worried. Whatever.
Yeah.
I'd have to say Rock Avalanche.
If l had to pick a moment,
I'd probably say Rock Avalanche.
Operation Rock Avalanche was the low point for me personally.
I saw a lot of professional tough guys get weak in the knees.
I'll go ahead and orient you guys to the different LZs that are out there.
Up on Divpat where the C2 element will be located is LZ Cubs.
The Taliban or the AAF forces in the valley, they got very, very audacious and tenacious during Rock Avalanche.
Physically putting their hands on soldiers, able to get so close to us that they can kill my soldiers, steal the equipment, and still get away.
I mean... that's ballsy.
We'll be releasing with Wildcat One, somewhere between Busch and Coors.
Moving in on Rock Avalanche with going into areas like Yaka China or up on the top of the Talisar.
Those are areas we haven't previously been, you know, during the deployment.
North goes that way toward Sergeant Rougle, south is this way towards me and the First Sergeant.
To go in there not ever having laid eyes on the area, hearing the stories about guys who'd gone prior to us getting fucked up down, you know, in areas where they literally shouldn't have been in.
We're going to be moving out of HLZ Cubs into HLZ Polk. ln Rock Avalanche we knew the expectation that we was going to get engaged going up there, but we all knew that.
In the location where we was actually going to conducting this operation and stuff, was where the bad guys, their safe haven was at.
: They wasn't coming to you.
Sometimes you had to go out there and reach out to them.
Go into program, go into your radio configurations, and then where it says
SINCGARS or basic, change that to ANDVT.
- Coming after you, motherfucker.
- Right here, bitch?
Let's do this, motherfucker! l'm coming back.
I'm coming back, don't worry.
Do you get nervous before something like this?
I get nervous for the guys.
I get nervous for myself.
I mean, I just--
I just called my mom and dad and I'll try calling my wife before I take off, just one last "I love you" to all of them.
And, you know, the guys, that's the hardest thing is like, you know, if something happens to me, there's not much I can do about it or anything like that.
But it takes a little bit out of you every time you see one of your boys get hurt or you lose one of them.
It's really like a big family.
We flew in the middle of the night.
Guess what, they're not quiet helicopters that we fly.
The enemy's awake now.
What the fuck are the Americans doing flying over us right now?
So now everybody's on their radio's, l'm sure, you know, "Hey, the Americans are heading this way."
So we got on the ground and we were already being told, be on alert, you know, everybody knows we're here.
If we could get one going from west to east into that draw, over.
It's real hot.
- All right, break.
- Coming out.
I'd like you to come in for one more re-attack.
Come down in elevation in that draw and fill right there in the center, over.
So you did hit the target.
This house right there.
This is the aftermath of what AH-64s do.
Good old attack helicopters.
He said that there is five guys already dead and ten of the females and kids already, they are injured, you know.
Show me which of them is the Taliban.
There is no Taliban.
Damn it.
You know?
I need to know better.
I need to figure this stuff out better so that l can do this, so that l'm not killing these people and not making them mad.
I mean, first impressions are the lasting impression.
That's the first time anybody's been in Yaka China, and what do l do?
I kill a bunch of bad guys, but in the same instance,
I'm killing five locals that may not have been the ones that pulled the trigger, but in some way shape or form, were connected to them.
There you go.
Dishka?
Afghan dishka, not American dishka, right?
This is divorce paper.
- What?
- Divorce paper.
- Di-wars?
- Paper, yeah.
- What does that mean?
- Divorce.
Like some woman you getting married then you're going to get a divorce.
- Divorce papers?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Who owns the house?
Did you ask him where the pistol was?
Eight RPG heads.
One, two, three, four boosters.
Got four boosters, three batteries, shotgun.
This is Colonel Ostlund, he's my boss, you know, the one I always tell you.
We brought the Colonel down there to talk to them, and we did that because basically we felt bad for the fact that we injured some of their kids and that we killed some of the locals.
The ACM that comes in and gives you five dollars to carry this stuff around the mountains and tells you that you're doing a jihad and go fight the Americans is doing nothing for you except making you a slave for five dollars as he hides on a mountain, because he won't fight my soldiers.
These foreigners, they don't fight my soldiers.
They hide on a mountain in a cave, under a rock and talk on a radio and pay your sons a small amount of money to go ahead and shoot at my soldiers and my soldiers end up killing your sons.
But this is the deal we'll make.
Everybody needs a job, and we're going to try to bring progress here and some jobs, and Captain Kearney will talk to the Shura on Friday about some job projects.
The whole time we were there, we were thinking, "Okay.
When's it coming?
When's it coming.
They're going to hit us.
When's it going to happen?
- This sucks, dude.
- I'm just going to double check it.
ICOM chatter right now coming out of Chappadara, a guy named Obed's talking to the elders, and apparently said that the elders are in charge of what's going on.
The elders basically want jihad down here in the Korengal, and whatever they want, they'll-- they're here to assist, so we'll see what happens.
But it doesn't sound very good for us, huh?
Hey, Sergeant Patterson,
I found four fighting positions over there, AK-47s.
I'm going to push to this next hilltop.
I'm also getting ICOM traffic that there may be enemy close to us.
Getting intel saying that they've got eyes on three to four US personnel and they're getting close to them.
So they've got eyes on us and it can be anywhere, this high ground there, there's some more spurs back there, there's one we crossed to an open patch back there.
They could have easily had eyes on us when we were moving in.
What the fuck was that?
Did you hear that?
It might be the birds, sir.
Shooting?
Am l just jumpy?
Fucking Christ, monitor this.
Sergeant P... do we got guys in these pine trees right here?
Do we?
When the attack finally happened,
I remember it was myself and my team on the south eastern corner of basically the area that we were covering.
We got ambushed, like, just every single position got hit at the same time pretty much.
They placed a PKM a machine gun down into our position and one orientated into the scout position, and just rained down hell.
I just look over to my right and I see rounds breaking branches off the tree.
They were shooting RPGs at us, they were shooting pretty much everything.
When l got hit, it actually came with enough force that it rolled me forward.
You know, initial thought was,
"What happened?"
I felt pain, you know, placed my hand there just underneath my IBA because that's where I felt, you know, the initial pain, pulled my hand out, saw blood, knew l was hit.
I looked up in time from all fours to watch a guy come over the crest probably about 35-45 meters to fire an RPG directly at me. lnitial thought was, "Wow, this is the last thing l'm going to see," because the guy was so close.
And, you know, the round came in, exploded.
Took shrapneI all throughout my body, but... kind of did-- after the explosion, like,
"I'm still here, I'm still alive," and then proceeded to basically roll down the mountain into the bushes.
And they were all up in position,
I could hear them talking to each other.
To our north we heard somebody yelling for a medic.
I was the first one that heard it.
I yelled back to Sergeant Hoyt, telling him if I could go and see who who it was.
Myself along with Cortez started moving-- we started bounding towards where we heard the guy yelling from.
We didn't know who it was.
I got to the wounded and found out it was Vandenberge.
I yelled back it was Vandenberge that was wounded, bring a medic.
He was just bleeding real bad.
His whole left side of his body was this real dark red color.
And all he kept on saying was,
"Hey, help me, guys. Help me." just rocking back and forth.
Saying "I'm bleeding out, you gotta save me. l'm dying."
Just stuff like that.
Started handing him gauze, tourniquet.
Just started packing the wound with gauze. l had my finger knuckle-deep in his arm.
Ended up stopping the bleeding.
I'm asking,
"Where are the guys at?
Where's the Taliban at?
Where's the enemy at?"
Last time he saw them, they were 20 feet away.
And just was I was going to give him an lV,
Sergeant Stichter and Doc Old got there and carried on from there.
Sergeant Patterson and all them took over, and I pushed out with Cortez.
We didn't bound, we didn't do anything, we just ran in a straight line and got to Rice as quick as we can.
At that point I kind of realized,
"Hey, l'm stable.
"You know, I been here ten, fifteen minutes.
I'm still breathing,
I'm not going into shock."
Kind of evaluating myself.
So basically just gave them orders to--
"Hey, you need to maneuver your guys.
And push up and clear across that hilltop."
As l went up,
I didn't see anyone there.
I took a knee and set up security, and when I turned to my right,
I saw Sergeant Rougle just laying there.
I ran up and I saw
Sergeant Rougle's body and it didn't even click.
I ran past him.
I saw his face, how it was, kind of messed up.
I wanted to cry, but didn't.
I was shocked, honestly.
I was shocked because I saw
Sergeant Rougle just laying there.
It was-- It was chaos.
And when we finally had a second to stop and think, that's when l realized that one of my good friends had gone, you know, and I started hearing about
Sergeant Rice, Vandenberge.
I didn't even know that they had been hit at that point.
And...
I need a--
Yeah, time out. Hold on.
I'm just trying to keep my train of thought.
Have that box ready.
Have the next goddamn box ready.
Hey, I need immediate suppression on 2251.
They enemy's pushed up on the high ground--
We're not getting shit.
512255, if we've got A-10s,
I want gun runs from east to west coming in, okay?
The hill's been taken over by the enemy.
That hill right here?
WiIdcat's hill.
All right, we're going to go around to the east and go around.
Hey, Abdul!
Get the fuck over here! tell these guys we're pushing up on this fucking ridge.
Hey, he wants us to go up over this hill and bum rush it.
There's fucking dudes right there.
If we do that, we're going to have to fucking lay down some--
We're going to have to lay down fire first.
- Yeah, but we--
- We can't get a hold of them.
We don't know where they're at.
That's why we have to lay down fire first.
Look, they took fire from right over here.
Okay?
Hey, who's down?
We got Sergeant Rougle and them up?
Hey.
What?
Where they at?
Just keep down.
- Get down.
- What?
- What's going on?
- Just chill out, dude.
- Chill the fuck out out.
- Who's over there?
Oh, my God.
Shut up.
Move, man.
Is Sergeant Rice still alive?
- He's alive?
- He's going to make it.
- There's nothing we could do.
- Where's everybody else?
Hey, we've got friendlies here and friendlies to your six, right there.
Vandenberge all right?
Vandenberge's already--
He's stable right now.
That ain't Sergeant Rougle.
You're lying, right, man?
Why would I lie about something like that?
Where'd he get hit?
I got to see.
Don't look at him. ls it bad?
Tell me, dude.
Tell me, dude.
It was quick.
It was quick.
There was nothing we could do, bro!
Where the bad guys at?
Battle Six Romeo, this is two-six.
I've pushed to the site of the KIA, break.
Right now we have the hilltop.
It's in the same vicinity as my last grid.
Right now we're going to move the wounded in action-- there's two of them-- back to LZ Eagles.
When Captain Kearney told me up by the LZ that Staff Sergeant Rougle was killed, it was gut wrenching.
You know, there's different levels to quality of fighters.
He was one of the best, if not the best.
And l think that was what was tough for a lot of people was, you know, kind of knowing that in the back of their mind, well, if the best guy we have out here just got killed, where's that put me?
What's going to happen to me?
What's going to happen to the guy to my left, to my right?
Hey, we're going down here to get the wounded first.
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's go.
It was a coordinated attack.
They drew all our attention over to there from here.
These guys over here also returning fire from there.
They fucking flanked them.
You can see where the path is here where the fuckers came up.
Okay, where's this fucking compound?
I want it destroyed.
Let's go.
- Stichter, destroy it now.
- Yes, sir.
After we go ahead and get the KlA out of here,
I want gunmetal to search directly to my west.
Hijar believes that he has a blood trail,
I want them to be getting down low to try and PlD and see where this guy's stopped.
It's likely that where we find this son of a bitch is where we find everybody else.
Hijar, make sure he understood that.
Watch the pine trees.
Just on the north side of that, you can see a house on the corner.
As it cuts like that?
It comes almost like an L shape.
- See the terraces right there?
- Got it.
Okay, now, the fucking far southeast side, there's a fucking-- there's a dude on the roof down in that house.
- About a thousand meters.
- Roger.
Hey, Raeon's got a guy to our northwest on top of a building walking around, over.
- Any other info?
- No.
He was looking up this way, and he just came off the roof, and he went back in his house.
Roger, acknowledge.
Raeon, next time you see that dude, take his head off.
Where's that range finder at?
He was a good dude, man.
Sergeant Rougle?
- You want a real cigarette?
- Yeah.
I'm worried about the rest of the guys.
They've been taking it real bad.
One Alpha's kind of blaming it on himself because we couldn't push over the top, but the thing he's got to understand is they fucking--
He was dead instantly.
There's nothing you can do right there.
Actually, l can't even sleep, honestly.
I've been on about four or five different types of sleeping pills and none of them help.
That's how bad the nightmares are.
I prefer not to sleep and not dream about it, than sleep and... just see the picture in my head is... pretty bad.
That actually stuck with me for the rest of the deployment.
Stuck with me through coming back here to Italy.
I still obviously haven't... figured out how to deal with it inside.
The only hope
I have right now is that eventually l'll be able to process it differently.
I'm never going to forget it.
Never going to even let go of it. l don't want to not have that as a memory because that was tone of the moments that makes me appreciate everything that I have.
Steiner?
Steiner, come on!
Not yet. Not yet.
Still working to try to bring about the Korengal to get the road moving here.
Are you really drawing the Korengal Valley? lt's the only thing
I know how to draw.
I just send it home in letters.
Just draw.
So do you have a songbook or something, or an exercise book to practice with?
You just fuck around?
Yeah I'm just fucking around.
You need one of those books, with the charts on them.
Yeah, I need-- that would be nice.
Restrepo was teaching me that stuff, but he-- he taught me like a few, but l wrote just one, a C chord, but, you know, I don't know.
I still have his--
I actually still have one of his Flamenco books or whatever it is.
How to play guitar flamenco, you know.
He was amazing on guitar.
- It was just beautiful music.
- It was amazing.
He used to grow his fingernails out real long, and put like nail hardener.
So we always used to get on him about that.
Yeah, but-- with his teeth--
"yeah, but can--
"can you play the guitar like me, yo, son?
Shun?"
Twenty seven May, movement to contact west of Restrepo.
Task disrupt, purpose prevent AAF from building mass fires on Restrepo.
That concludes my report. Over.
- How long till he gets tired?
- Hump him, Walker.
Ow, my hip.
Is he squeezing you with his fucking mammoth legs?
- Heart punch, heart punch.
- There you go, film Walker.
Walker!
I think they just changed, didn't they?
I just want to see.
- Walker.
- I'm bored.
Say something to your wife.
Dude, you know you want to.
Hey, babe, I miss you.
Can't wait to get home and--
Hurry up, hurry up!
Do you want to know when you're going home or not?
All right, what's been told to the wives is we'll be back in Italy, not out of country, back in Italy between
August 4th and 7th.
So look at your fucking watch.
Two months from today and counting down.
That's bad news if you're one of those dudes that's like,
"Fuck, I love it here and I wanted to wait till September and get an extra thousand dollars."
And if that's you, I don't care.
Fuck you.
We're going home.
Today things were a little bit hectic.
We found out that one of our sister companies, Chosen Company, up north of Camp Blessing, starting a new base lost nine soldiers and had an additional twelve US wounded and an thirteen additional ANA that were wounded.
Hey, is this everybody?
We got the Mortars?
We got Second Platoon?
Okay, hey, listen up.
I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit about some of what happened up with Chosen Company.
I want you guys to mourn, and then l want you guys to get over it and do your jobs.
Okay?
First-- Hey, Proctor, why did you come in the army, man?
To fight for my country, sir.
- To fight for your country?
- Roger, sir.
Did you expect that you might get injured or die?
Absolutely, sir.
Anybody join not knowing that that might be an option?
We lose PFC Vimoto on June 5th, 2007.
What happens the very next day after that, Sergeant Buno?
We go out on patrols, we get attacked again.
Right.
July 22nd, we lose Restrepo, right?
What do we keep on doing after that?
Fighting.
We keep on fighting and taking it to the enemy, right?
What do you guys think would have happened if we had just stopped at Vimoto and acted like our predecessors before us and we stood our ground there, didn't go out there doing our aggressive patrolling, didn't go out there and build OP Restrepo, which I think we'll all venture to say, like, pretty much changed the entire dynamics of the entire valley?
You guys know what would have happened?
The same shit that happened today up at Chosen Company.
Now with Chosen Company, they went into an area that they knew was going to be contested.
They knew what they were getting into.
They've been talking about going to Wanat since July of 2007.
We went there, they did it.
The fucking only way to bounce back from shit like this is to go out there and make the individuals that did this to us fucking pay.
It's not to sit back here and hide.
It's not to go back down to our fucking rucks and fucking feel sorry for ourselves and get snuggled up in our woobie.
We go out there, we find the motherfuckers that did this and we make them pay.
We make them feeI how we feel right now.
For those of you guys that pray, let's go ahead and take a moment of silence in-- in remembrance the ten-- ten to nine soldiers that we lost today and the families of them and the families of those that were hurt, and then I'll let you guys go ahead and get about your business.
Get down.
Oh, wow, you can't see shit now.
Hey, can I shoot Sergeant Mac?
I'm I'm going to fucking get him.
- Can I shoot?
- Wait till he engages.
Wait till he engages, then fucking fucking get him.
There he goes.
Low right, low right!
Low right!
- Hey, that motherfucker's done.
- Is he?
Hey, Olson, he's done.
Yeah!
A direct hit on that dude.
That motherfucker's done, man!
That motherfucker's done, dude!
Fuck you, bitches!
Body parts falling apart.
The L-Ras, dude, it was him running and then him blasting into pieces.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.
There you go, motherfucker, shoot at us again.
By the end, like I was--
I really didn't want to get overrun.
But l just wish they were closer so l could have actually seen them when I killed them.
626 perstat,
I have twenty Restrepo.
The only question I have is tonight, are we going to be doing an illum round for Doc Restrepo?
Today's twenty two July.
Over.
Yeah, we're planning on doing the illum round.
One last thing, seventeen tonight they're shooting for Doc Restrepo.
Seventeen tonight.
He's fucking a little bit drunk.
I'm fucking--
I'm a little bit drunk at this point.
And I see him--
I see him just eyeing everyone up, just like this.
Who is that, Kim?
No, Restrepo.
Eyeing everyone up.
I come up to him and I'm like, "What's wrong, bro?"
He's like, "Yo, bro,
I'm going to stab these fools, yo."
I'm like, I see it in his hand.
He's got the fucking Gerber out with the knife out, fucking closed up, just ready to fucking shank someone, dude.
I'm like-- and this is after the night before we ended up down in the fucking the steps of Rome fucking train station, and I was peeing, in my pants.
What we did to mark the anniversary of our dead, we shot off flares, and where Restrepo died, we shot off flares.
You know, and kind of raise one up.
Say a prayer, say a few words in your head and you move on.
Did my last patrol hopefully.
Hopefully I don't get called back out for something.
Fly out of here in a few days.
It's kind of strange thinking you'll never come back to OP Restrepo again.
Yeah.
It's a good feeling, though.
It's been a long fucking deployment right there.
Leaving Restrepo?
It's too good to be true, you know?
We're going to die here. lsn't that right, Henry?
- Roger, Sergeant.
- But we're leaving instead.
God's going to fuck with our emotions and kill us on the bird out.
I'm never coming back, never coming back.
It's time to go.
That's heavy.
Goodbye, OP Restrepo.
I'm never going to have to be here again.
Not that I didn't enjoy my time here, but it's time to move on.
- Yes!
- See you later.
The high point for us was going home.
Getting out of there.
Going home, seriously.
No doubt about it.
Each one of my soldiers' face, you can tell, going home.
We done our job.
We did what we were supposed to have been doing and we out of here.
The Korengal, as far as--
What did we we achieve?
I'm always going to think about Restrepo.
BuiIding Restrepo was the single most important event for the Korengal.
And how... how the boys did it.
Fighting.
And then turning around and going back to working.
It makes us proud when we see the news-- they still call it Restrepo-- knowing that, you know, we painted it on the walls, this is for Doc Restrepo.
The name fit the place after a while, after it became built up, after it became a better place.
But when l hear Restrepo,
I still think of the person.
You can't-- You can't tame the beast.
You know?
Got him.
Yeah, he got him. He got him.
He did get him.
Hey, Lex, what's going on tonight?
Just tell us.
Break it down, break it down.
All I want to do is find a miniature zebra, put a little tiny saddle on it and ride it.
There ain't no zebras on the pub crawl.
I didn't-- Miniature zebras.
My bad, there are miniature zebras.
What the fuck?
Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye.
Hey, tune in next time where we're going to be still drunk as fuck.
Saying goodnight to the bad guy, man.
The same time, the same dope rhyme, because we're going to be still loving life and getting ready to go to war.
Here or hea?
H-E-A. Hea.
"O'Byrne wuz hea."
That's how we roll.
You sure he...? He actually said that?
He wants to come?
I think he will.
- He wasn't so sure about it, but...
- Yeah, I'll bet he wasn't.
- has asked President Bush
to activate...
... thousands of military reservists.
Hey, Pop!
Hey, what are you doing in here?
Look at you.
Spiffy.
Are you coming with us?
Please. My parents are so excited to meet you, Mr. Tyree.
Yeah.
You hungry?
I made meatloaf.
I know you made meatloaf, Pop.
It's Saturday.
We can take it with us.
We can take it with us.
You mind if we take it with us?
Well, I don't...
Is that okay? I'll wrap it up.
I don't mean... I'm sorry, but could...?
Could you stop the car, because I need to go back.
- Should I turn around?
- Stop the car, please. Stop the car.
- Forget something?
- Okay.
No, I need to get out of the car. Please.
- All right, just... Just relax, okay?
- Yeah.
I don't think I can do this.
- Look, you're fine. You're fine.
- No, I just... Please. I need to get out.
You're okay, Pop. It's fine.
- Look, stop the car, I can't...
- Okay, I'll turn around.
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
- I gotta get out. Stop the car.
- Okay, all right.
- Come on, Dad, stop!
- Okay.
Pop. Come on, don't do that.
Hey, Mr. Tyree.
Hey, you all right?
- You okay?
- I'm sorry.
It's okay.
But hey, let's...
We're gonna wait for you in the car, all right?
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- No, don't, honestly,
We can stay. Let's just stay.
Okay? Let's stay, because I can go next year.
Pop, I only got one night.
I mean, I gotta go back.
Do you understand that?
You should go. You both should go.
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Wall Street will re-open on Monday.
He tried. At least he tried.
Hello, welcome.
My girl.
Mom, this is John.
John, I feel like I already know you.
Where's your father, did he come too?
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, that's okay.
I'm just glad that you made it home safe.
We thought about canceling with everything that's going on...
...but we felt like everybody should be together.
I've been briefing him in the car and I think he's good.
It was good intel. With solid tactical training, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
I love him already.
Mrs. Curtis, Savannah.
- Hey, dude, how's it going?
- John.
It's good to see you again.
All right, You know what?
You look like you could use a drink.
- I'll grab one for you.
- Yes, thank you.
- John.
- What's he doing here?
He's here because I invited him.
His family lives just up the street.
What are you, like, hanging out now?
He's really not that bad once you get to know him, I swear to you, John.
Here you go.
It's bourbon, it's not gonna kill you.
Be right back.
We got off on the wrong foot and I want to apologize for the way I treated you.
If I had known that Savannah was actually gonna stay with you...
...I wouldn't have treated you that way.
In all seriousness, I'm sorry.
Fair enough.
If you need anything and...
- Enjoy yourself.
- Right.
So this is him.
Yup. No tough-guy routine from you, Dad.
Routine?
I bench press refrigerators, honey.
Your boyfriends need to know these things.
He's absolutely right.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
But I think Tim here might have already beat you to the punch.
He said he'd rough me up if ever I hurt her.
I was very convincing too.
I think I made quite an impact.
Well, cheers, son.
Glad you could join us.
Thank you, sir.
- Billy! You actually showed up!
- See, hard part's over.
- Good to see you again, John.
- How you doing, Tim?
Hi. Hey, Tim, how are you doing?
- Good.
- I haven't seen your wife. Is she here?
Yeah, she's on vacation actually.
- So I'll tell her you said hello.
- Please do.
I will.
Alan, remember what we talked about?
Another vacation?
Yeah.
Alan ever ask about her?
Yeah, he does.
I just don't know what to say.
Hey, look, I'm not a father.
You know, I'm really in no position to give you advice at all.
When I was a kid,
I waited around every day...
...hoping that today would finally be the day...
...that my mom would come home.
I waited around 15 years.
So I know how painful it might have been for my dad to...
...just tell me the truth.
It would have saved me a lot of waiting around.
You know?
Well, I guess if the worst thing you can say about your father...
...is he tried to protect you too much then...
...that's a pretty good father, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
You're John, right? Savannah's John?
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna thank you for what you do.
Know our prayers are with you.
I hope whatever happens...
...it'll be over soon. So you boys can come home safe and sound.
Oh, it won't be over anytime soon.
Afghanistan will just be the first stop of many.
He's right, you know. Pretty soon they'll ask y'all to reenlist for another tour.
Slowly but surely they'll stop asking and start telling.
None of the soldiers I know need to be asked, sir.
And we sure don't need to be told.
What do you mean by we?
It was great to see you guys.
See you next year.
Savannah...
So you're gonna reenlist, just like that?
It's something we should talk about.
Two more years, John.
Have you already done it?
Have you already re-upped?
No.
But you decided that you're going to?
Do I have a say?
Do I have a say in this?
- You don't understand.
- Don't ever tell me I don't understand.
Leave me alone, John.
Please.
What do you...?
What do you want from me?
Savannah, I mean...
Just tell me what you want from me.
I mean, you want me to quit?
Is that it?
Look, I don't know how we got here.
I don't know what happened.
Just woke up and...
...there's buildings falling and...
I mean, I had a plan...
I had a plan, but now I don't.
And I have no idea what to do.
I don't know what to do and I just...
All I know is I wanna stay here.
I just wanna stay right here with you as long as I possibly can.
You're just all that matters, okay?
You're all that matters to me.
I'm trying to figure out what the right thing is and I don't know.
I don't have any idea how to get there.
I just... Because I need you to tell me.
I just need you to tell me, okay?
Can you just tell me, please...?
Just tell me what you want me to do.
I want you to come with me.
Hey, Pop.
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
Well...
So you think you're gonna be okay by yourself this time?
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
I should probably be getting going.
Take care of yourself.
So are we...?
I mean, we're okay though.
Right? Nothing has changed?
Be careful not to step in any fires, okay?
Okay. I will.
So I'll see you soon, then.
I'll see you soon, then.
Welcome back, guys.
Hope you had a good weekend.
Wish it could've been longer...
...but sometimes you got to take what you can get.
So that's it then?
It's unanimous?
Okay.
I'll start the paperwork.
Thank you, sir.
O'Neill, here you go!
This smells pretty good, Russ.
And we got Daniels. Where's he at?
Move, move, move, up and shoot!
Move, move, move, up and shoot!
- Hey, yo.
- Yeah, nothing today, man. Sorry.
Go, go, go.
Yo, you guys seen John?
Is he back here?
Yo, John.
Got one for you, dude.
- Yeah?
- That's it, though.
Dear John, I know it's been
way too long since I last wrote you.
I've been staring at this blank page
for the last two hours.
Well, if I'm being honest...
... I've been staring at it
for the last two months.
Please forgive me
for what I'm about to say.
And know that this is
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
My life without you has no meaning.
And I cannot live... I'm sorry.
Yo, listen to this, hedge fund manager on Wall Street, right?
How much do you think he made at his regular job?
Twenty-seven million dollars, he ran a hedge fund. Works on Wall Street.
That is amazing.
You making mud pies, buddy?
What's going on, man?
You wanna talk about it?
Nothing to talk about.
She found somebody else.
You got any idea who it is?
No, she didn't say.
I mean, I got a pretty good idea.
Look, man...
...you know, this happens, dude.
I mean, you'll get her back.
You get home, she comes running.
- It's the whole cycle, dude.
- They already got engaged.
Jesus.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
Let me know if I can do anything, all right?
- Off the bottom rim. You wouldn't think a squirrel could swim, but I swear...
...swam 20 yards to the shoreline.
- Swimming squirrel.
- That's crazy, dude.
Hey, notice that. Did y'all see that?
I mean, that's as sexy as it gets around here.
They can't show their legs, so they got fishnets on their faces.
I'm gonna bring that back to the States and make my girl wear that.
How mysterious.
Back up, back up!
- What's he saying?
- Hey, he's speaking Turkish.
- What is he saying, though?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Come on, specialist, figure it out!
Look, man, I speak Pashtu,
I speak Farsi, I speak all kinds of shit.
What languages you speak?
Come here.
- Good work, man.
- Stay right there.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somebody's gotta figure it out.
- Noodles, go with him.
- Yeah.
Back up, back up.
Tyree!
Wait for further instructions.
Let's move out.
- Good?
- Yeah, you?
We got a man down! Noodles, you gonna be all right, man! Hold on, man!
Copy that, man down! Man down!
- Come here.
- You see it?
I got you. Get your hands up!
Tyree, do you read?
Talk to me, Tyree.
Lucky SOB. It hit your plate.
Jesus, I never loved a piece of clothing more in my entire life, I swear to God.
John!
Man down! Medic!
Medic! John.
Come on, man.
Medic!
Look, come on, you're gonna be fine, all right? It's nothing.
It's nothing. You got this.
Stay awake, okay? You just look in my eyes, just look in my eyes!
Keep your eyes open, okay?
Eyes, awake, awake, right at me, okay?
Jakes!
Jakes!
Welcome back, Sergeant Tyree.
Rest easy, okay?
You're in the hospital in Germany.
And you're gonna be just fine.
Tyree.
- You look good, man.
- Thank you, sir.
I just wanted to come by and let you know I'll be extending.
Extending.
Tyree, it's been three months.
I'm impressed, but I'm not stupid.
Go home, John. Get some R&R.
Keep your dad some company for a while.
Have a seat.
Listen, I'm being transferred.
Now, this has nothing to do with what happened.
My captain duties are done here.
Going back to Fort Bragg.
I actually miss my family.
That's good, sir.
Berry and Daniels are getting out, the others, coming down on assignment.
- And you've got less than four months...
- I'm definitely extending.
Your war is over, John.
You served your country well.
You know what?
I might just make this a career.
No talking you out of this, huh?
Mark, on my mark!
Mark!
Where you thinking next?
Oh, man. I don't know, wherever they send us.
Actually, we're sending you home to the States, John.
I'm sorry, we just got the news.
He's conscious, but he's not lucid.
And he's hardly ever responsive.
It's hard for me to say how severe the stroke really is...
...because we don't know how long he was down before they found him.
If I'd have been there to find him like that earlier...
...do you think it would've made a difference?
I doubt it. I really doubt it.
- Hey, Jeff, here's that scan.
- No problem.
Hey, Pop.
What...? What the heck do you...?
Ma'am, why do you have him out here?
You okay? How you feeling?
I...
I mean, it's nothing, but I wrote you...
I wrote you a letter.
No, no, don't read it now.
You don't have to...
I didn't think you'd... Why don't you read it when I'm not around?
You know what? The hell with it.
I'll just read it to you.
"Dear Dad.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
You remember a few years back...
...when I got shot.
Well, you wanna know the very first thing...
...that entered my mind at that moment?
Right before I blacked out?
Coins.
Suddenly I was 8 years old again.
I was on that tour of the U.S. Mint.
I was listening to the guide explain how coins are made.
How they're punched out of sheet metal and how they're rimmed and beveled.
How they're stamped and cleaned.
And how each and every batch of coins are personally examined...
...in case any have slipped through with the slightest imperfection.
Do you remember that, Dad?
I mean, do you remember that trip to Philadelphia we took?
That's what popped into my head.
I'm a coin of the United States Army.
And I was minted in the year 1980.
I've been punched from sheet metal.
I've been stamped and cleaned.
And my edges have been rimmed and beveled.
But now I have two small holes in me.
So I'm no longer in perfect condition."
How about it, Dad? You know, we're just a couple of culls here, huh?
"But there's one...
There's one more thing...
...that I want to tell you too.
After I got shot, you know, right before I blacked out.
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?"
I'm sorry.
The very last thing I thought of...
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?
I'm so sorry,
I don't want to rush you...
...but we have another service coming in.
John.
What brings you home?
It's my dad.
How's your dad?
He...
I'm sorry.
I wish I had known.
It's okay.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I'm so sorry.
He's... He was a really good man.
You finally did it, huh?
Camp Horse Sense.
No.
I didn't. I tried.
It only lasted one summer after we took over this place from my parents.
It was... It was expensive.
Do you want to come inside?
It's just me.
When do you have to go back?
As soon as I get my dad's stuff squared away.
Have you settled down yet?
No.
But you must be dating a lot, huh?
No. I don't think you can call it dating exactly.
It's so good to see you.
Here. Alive.
Hold on. I'm just gonna... I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hey.
No, I'm fine.
I...
Well, John... John is here.
Yeah, John Tyree.
Yeah, I'm gonna leave soon.
Okay, I'll see you.
I'll be there in like
20 minutes, okay?
I love you too. Bye.
He wants to see you.
Wait, what?
It's Tim?
Initially after he was diagnosed, he was so optimistic.
He wasn't concerned, all he cared about was Alan...
...which was inspiring.
It wasn't until after the cancer spread to stage four that I noticed a big change.
What kind of cancer is it?
Lymphoma.
He's had it with being cooped up in that room...
...so he basically just spends all his time out here.
Sometimes with Alan.
- Can I have a crumble cake?
- Alan, do you remember John?
Hello, John.
Hey, Alan.
He's gotten big.
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm gonna get him a crumble cake.
Oh, that's a good idea.
He's been talking about that.
Come on, Alan.
I guess you must want to kick my ass, huh?
There's not a lot I can do about it here, is there?
It's all part of my master plan.
Hell of a plan.
I love her.
Everything that happened in my life before, it's gone now.
It's been wiped clean.
I wanted to tell you that.
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for how it happened with you so far away.
But I know now that Alan will always have someone to take care of him.
He will always be in good hands.
She still loves you, you know.
Why is it black?
It's plain as day, you can see it all over her face.
I wish that weren't the case...
...but she's never looked at me the way she used to look at you.
You should know that.
Be careful, Alan.
He still loves those horses, huh?
Yeah, he'll be out there till bedtime.
I gotta get him out of that hospital.
He needs to come home.
There's a company in Texas with an experimental drug.
That might help.
But the insurance companies don't pay for it, of course.
My parents sold their beach house a year ago.
Which was a godsend.
We've done a few fundraisers.
But I never would have guessed that we would run out so fast.
Stay for dinner, okay?
So you drink now.
Just a glass or two at dinner.
Tim got me started a couple years ago.
Why are you looking at me like that?
What do you mean?
How am I looking at you?
Differently.
I don't know, how do you want me to look at you?
You're different.
I don't know...
I don't know why I came here.
I mean, what are we doing?
We're sitting here and we're eating and we're talking...
...but no one's actually saying anything.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?
Why didn't you call?
Why didn't you call me?
I mean, did I not deserve any more explanation than...
...that letter?
You couldn't have called me?
You couldn't have given me some sort of chance to change your mind?
Don't you think you owed me that?
I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You thought that little of me that you couldn't have just called me.
Why?
Because I couldn't.
Give me an answer.
Why? Why not?
- Because I couldn't.
- An answer.
Because just hearing your voice,
I would have changed my mind.
Is that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all this way to hear?
You think it was tough out there?
Think it was easy for me without you?
You thought that every single day it wasn't...
...a goddamn marathon of my life without you?
Tim was sick.
He was sick and he needed me.
He needed me to help him.
He needed me to help him with Alan, with everything.
I was alone and I had no idea what I was doing.
I didn't plan this. I didn't know that it was gonna happen to me.
But it did.
You don't think I've tried...?
I picked up the phone a thousand times to try to call you.
You think that I really wanna be standing here in front of you like this?
I had no choice.
I know.
I saved every single one of them.
You've been so many places.
I think the yellow envelopes are from Africa or something.
Really?
I even have your first, your very first letter to me.
Tim's water bill.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Hope you have more where that came from.
I'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.
I should go.
I'll see you soon, then?
Say it back.
When I say it, you say it.
Remember?
John?
Just say it.
Goodbye, Savannah.
I don't think you remember me. But I believe you knew my father, Bill Tyree.
Oh, yeah, of course I did. I haven't seen him in a while, though. How is he?
He recently passed.
I'm sorry.
I think you might've offered to buy his coin collection one time. Is that right?
Sure did. More than once.
Just out of curiosity, how much do you think a collection like his is worth?
A collection that big?
I don't know, I'd have to see it.
Look, I only got about one condition.
All the mules, they gotta stay together.
You can sell them as a set or keep them for yourself.
They have to stay together.
You're really going to sell me all his coins?
Yes, sir.
All but one.
This comes up nickel, we're gonna set up right here. We got shade.
It comes up penny, we'll be up on the ridge. We got visibility.
- That'd be penny side.
- All right, let's go to the ridge.
Sergeant.
Thank you.
Dear John...
... it's been almost five years
since I wrote with an actual pen...
... on an actual sheet of paper.
I thought I could write and tell you...
... all that's happened
since I saw you last.
A few weeks
after you showed up here...
... Tim received
an anonymous donation.
A donation that was enough
to give him...
... what the insurance companies
wouldn't:
Time.
Time to finally come home.
Time to spend with his son.
Time to say goodbye.
The problem with time,
I've learned...
... whether it's those first two weeks
I got to spend with you...
... or those final two months
I got to spend with him...
... eventually time always runs out.
I have no idea where you are
out there in the world, John.
But I understand that I lost the right
to know these things long ago.
No matter how many years go by...
... I know one thing
to be as true as it ever was.
I'll see you soon, then.
- We're on the wrong fucking beach.
- Ah...
Tide turning.
- Yeah.
We were moving faster through the channel.
- It plonked us around the fucking corner.
- No chance getting back round the coast fighting that rip.
I was hoping for a cup of tea and a cake.
- Better get off this beach.
- Mines?
- Bound to be.
: Ben...
Got a date tomorrow.
: Let me guess.
You met her down the pub.
Nurse, huge tits.
- Like a pair of ripe melons ready for the plucking.
She's got this friend...
I was...
You've got to move on sometime, Ben.
Look, just come along, have a bit of fun.
Her friend's a real doll.
She's tall, ugh, blonde.
Legs all the way up to her armpits.
Ben...
- We haven't got time for this.
I'm walking it.
- Oh, shit.
I was just admiring the view.
My little nurse is not gonna be too happy if I leave my crown jewels blown all over this beach.
You better back off, Ben.
- I trust you.
If you marry her and have kids... you better bloody well name one after me.
- Slow... and steady this time.
Better get on with it.
Don't wanna keep the nursey waiting now, do we?
- Right address this time?
- Path up there.
- Oh...
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know, I don't care.
Let's just get the job done and get the fuck off this island.
Ugly-looking place.
This is bullshit.
Where is everyone?
- They're fucking torturing some poor bastard in there.
- This isn't a rescue mission.
- What if it's one of ours?
You know what those bastards did to Blondie's men in Bordeaux.
- It's not our mission.
: Jesus.
Jesus Christ in heaven!
Help... Help us, please!
- There's bad shit going on here.
Bad shit.
Bastards. Fuckin' Nazi bastards.
- No.
It's not our war. This is our fight.
The gun, that's our mission.
- Fuck the mission.
- Jesus Christ.
We leave. Now.
We get out alive.
We get back home.
- Back home to what?
- Look, we've done what we came here to do.
We'll get fucking medals for this.
The girls will be falling all over us!
- Give me ten minutes, Joe.
- Five.
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Request radio check. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
- Fuck you.
- Joe...
- Name...
Rank...
Number. Yes?
Good teeth.
Clean.
Some people I know in Germany actually collect teeth.
Perhaps I should cut that useless tongue out.
But what use are you, if you can't... talk to me, yes?
You can thank your own people for this little trick.
Was it not your own gangster commandos who raided these very islands, killing innocent German prisoners with their hands tied behind their backs?
Cathartic, is it not?
The release of pain surging through your body.
What was your mission?
- Hmm...
- Not enough to destroy the installation, but adequate... to put it out of action for a while.
Why?
To protect your armies... as they cross the English Channel and... retake these islands?
You're a little late, aren't you?
The population here is so hungry... they're reduced to eating rats.
What is this English... Channel... anyway?
Does anybody outside of England call it that?
Do the people of these... Channel Islands even think themselves English?
So, you planned to put the gun out of action.
And presumably others of the neighbouring islands, which... as the Führer predicted are to become the staging post for your invasion of... France.
Your silence is admirable.
- Fuck you, Fritz.
: God in heaven...
It is hungry.
: You bitch!
You think I have nothing better to do than feed you?
Whore!
So, should we begin again in a more civilized way?
Or do you wish to end up like your unfortunate friend over there?
Grogan.
Captain.
Who is that woman up there?
- If only you knew the truth of that.
- Oh, I can see the truth, splattered all around this room.
What is she, a plaything for you and your men?
You take a special little fancy to her, yeah?
Want her all for yourself?
Even your own army will hang you for this.
- This?
You think a single man is responsible for this?!
She did this to them!
- You're insane.
- You may not believe this, but you and I are in the same boat.
- Call me picky, but I'm the one who's tied up and threatened with summary execution here... Fritz.
- Meyer. Klaus Meyer.
Perhaps I should rephrase.
We are in the same shit.
I admire your marvellous accent.
South Africa?
Australia? Ah!
The guttural... nuance.
New Zealand.
You are indeed a long way from home.
- Same could be said about you.
New Zealanders.
A bunch of farmers pretending to be soldiers, driving around the deserts of North Africa, attacking by night, then fleeing to hide like cowards.
So, where in England will the invasion come from?
Southampton?
Poole?
Which of these islands do you plan to take first?
Guernsey, perhaps?
Alderney?
Then to France?
Which beaches?
Oh, perhaps it's not so... bad if we were to lose these islands... to men like you.
- Never yours to lose.
- And yet here you are, thousands of miles from home.
And what... exactly is your home,
Captain Grogan?
An... island that does not belong to you either, populated by the descendents of cannibals and headhunters.
Who exactly do you fight for,
Captain Grogan?
For King and country?
Or for Britain or New Zealand?
We are more similar that you care to admit.
You are a New Zealander, but of British descent, are you not?
Was not Britain itself a nation of Vikings and Saxons, superior Germanic people?
We should be fighting on the same side, not against each other.
But enough of politics.
Very pretty.
Strong features.
Girlfriend?
Wife?
Awaiting the return of her hero husband?
Pity...
...if I were to...
Tell me exactly when the Allies plan to take back these islands.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Well, that is a soldier's lot on lonely outposts such as this.
- No!
- Soon she will be gone.
Who is she?
I have my duty.
Please.
- She's Helena.
My wife.
She was my wife.
April 1941, in London, there was an air raid.
Shelter was hit. Hundreds were buried.
I went to help.
We found only mangled corpses, women and children.
I made it home in the early hours of the morning. Our hou...
Our house had been hit.
And...
I dug again, this time alone.
And I found her.
What was left of her.
I never got to say goodbye.
This war has taken its toll on all of us.
- You say that as if you're not responsible.
- I am just a soldier, like you.
- No.
No, not like me.
Ah!
: I told you...
We're both in the same shit.
We could've helped each other.
- What could I possibly help you with, Meyer?
Torturing female prisoners?
Murdering your own men?
What kind of lunatic Special Action Unit did they pull you out of?
Jews and Gypsies not enough for you?
- I've already told you...
None of those men died by my hand.
That prisoner, she is not what you think she is.
- Sorry, Joe.
: Please, help me. Please.
Please, help me.
- It's safe.
- Don't...
You're safe now.
I can take you from here.
There's a submarine off the coast.
We can get to it.
Jesus! Jesus Christ!
Ben...
- Helena...
No... No, you're dead.
- Please...
There isn't time to explain.
The German, he'll be back.
Don't leave me here with him.
Don't let him touch me.
- How... How can this be?
- Ben! You've got to get me free.
You've got to unlock this chain!
- You were so...
You were so torn.
You-you-you were broken.
You, uh...
I held you in my arms.
- Ben... pull yourself together.
This is real. I promise.
There's a key... downstairs.
You must find it.
- Don't think about releasing her.
There's a good chap.
- What in God's name is going on here?!
- Nothing in God's name,
I can assure you of that.
Now, please, step away from her.
- Ben, help...
- Silence, you hag!
That creature is not who you think she is.
- How is she here?
- That Luger had... only three rounds left.
By my count, you are out of bullets.
You don't believe? Shoot me.
- Drop the Schmeisser.
Kick it here.
- An officer and a gentleman to the last.
How boring.
Ah!
I need you alive.
No!
Bastard!
What the fuck did you just do, you Nazi bastard?
: I've saved your life.
She'd have killed you if you'd set her free.
Listen to me.
I have information.
A weapon...
...more dangerous than anything you can imagine.
- You lying bastard!
- Kill me... and you'll never know.
- Talk!
- That creature...
She's part of it.
- Bullshit.
I can prove it.
- No. Your turn to die.
- Please, I beg you.
- You lie to me and I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, and gut you like a pig, you understand?
What the fuck is going on here?
How can Helena be here?
Tell me.
- She's not your dead wife.
Ugh... Please tell me you believe that.
I am Colonel Meyer of the SS Germanorden.
How many soldiers have the blood tattoo?
How many soldiers carry papers of that nature?
You must understand, the Führer has long been obsessed with the occult.
He set up the SS Germanorden, a specialist unit dedicated to scouring the world for... mystical materials.
I was sent here on... a highly secret mission.
The outcome which c... could affect the entire war.
These islands you're so keen to save... you know, they have something of a reputation.
- For what?
- Witchcraft.
What on earth do... do you think we're dealing with here?
You may see her as your dead Helena.
I see my loving Gretta, who is still very much alive in Hamburg.
That soldier...
That was Lieutenant Otto Schillmann.
A good soldier, until his girlfriend tried to use his intestines as a necklace.
- Enough of this fairytale bullshit.
- That is how they died.
Each one.
Ripped apart and devoured by someone they thought was the love of his life.
- Ah... you really are insane.
- The platoon stationed here were starving.
They hadn't been supplied for weeks, reduced to foraging for food.
They found... an abandoned cottage.
A ruin.
There they found something.
A book.
Have you heard of the Grimoires?
- The what?
- In the Middle Ages, witches were more feared on these islands than in any other part of the British Isles.
They drew their power from a series of ancient texts.
Grimoires.
Bad books.
Whose purpose was the invocation of demonic forces.
Allow me to prove it.
I will show you the true nature of this horror.
I need your knife.
Come, demon bitch.
You can cease pretending.
I know you need your meat.
See?
- Jesus Christ, Meyer.
What have you done?
: Benjamin?
: Do not implore his help, demon.
I've shown him what you are.
- My love... I'm your Helena.
Surely you can see.
- Isn't this what you really seek?
- I am no animal to be chained.
Release me, and the forces I serve will grant you powers beyond your wildest dreams.
- So said Lucifer in the desert to Our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Ah! Surely that holy name turns to poison in your mouth, Nazi.
- You cannot divide us, demon.
I will send you back to the darkness.
Treat this as your last meal.
I present your loving wife.
I will show you everything, Grogan.
How I summoned... this monster.
And how we will dispel it.
Ugh...
: Ben...
Don't leave me.
- Be warned... Captain Grogan.
If I die, you lack the knowledge to send that creature back to Hell.
- You be warned, there's no morphine.
This is gonna hurt... a lot.
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
- Keep bloody still!
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
Ah...
- Colonel?
Don't die on me now, not after the trouble I've been through.
: Ben...?
Ben? Are you down there, darling?
I know you're listening.
I can replace her, Ben.
I can be Helena.
Release me from this chain.
Release me, and I will take my place beside you.
- Do demons sleep, Colonel?
- Who knows?
When incarnate on earth, when clothed in living flesh--
- Yeah, spare me.
- She is Femme-Varou.
- What?
- Femme-Varou.
That is her real identity.
May I?
In mythology, the Femme-Varou are shape-shifters.
She is a carnivore.
A desecrator of human flesh.
But she comes with a beautiful and familiar face, to confuse and deceive her victims.
- You... summoned one.
- I had orders to test... the book.
- On fellow German soldiers?
- All war involves sacrifice.
An island like this is perfect.
This particular demon cannot cross flowing waters.
Even if she'd killed us all, she would be trapped here.
- But she didn't kill you all.
One does not summon demons...
...without the means to defend oneself against them.
Whoever carries the words contained within that pouch will be safe from her.
Against them she is forbidden to cause mortal harm and has no more strength than a normal woman.
- Let me guess.
There's only one of these.
- I'll admit, I was not prepared for the viciousness of her attack, or the extent of her appetite.
But she killed so many...
It's unfortunate.
But what a... what a weapon she is, spawned in Hell itself.
Imagine if she were unleashed in London, deceiving and slaughtering her way to Churchill himself.
She would... she would make Jack the Ripper look like a kindergarten tale.
She cannot be killed by mortal means.
She can only be bound in iron.
But that... will only hold her for so long.
She can be dismissed back to the netherworld, but only by the knowledge contained in there.
And trust me, she is just a lesser demon.
There are far worse than her in that book.
Help me... and the book is yours.
- Why?
Why would you do that?
- I love my country, but I'm not blind to the atrocities she's committed, nor am I comfortable with what will happen if she wins.
Perhaps it is... better if the righteous prevail.
- And what's the price of betraying your country?
- A deal.
Immunity from prosecution for myself, my wife smuggled out of Germany, new lives and a new identity for both of us.
In return...
I will educate your leaders in the dark secrets of this book.
- Why don't I just take this book and kill you?
- A brave soldier returning to rave of demons and witchcraft?
How many occult experts do you have in your army, Captain Grogan?
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
- How long was I unconscious?
- An hour, maybe longer.
: God in Heaven!
The garrison on Guernsey is sending a boat to collect me at dawn.
We must escape before they arrive.
- What about her?
- She is trapped on this island, but she is a denizen of Hell.
Who knows the strength of her powers?
For our own safety, we must dispel the demon now.
- How?
- The ritual.
It requires two of us.
The pouch. I need it.
Captain Grogan, do you have any idea with what you're dealing with here?
There are rules.
Without those words kept close to my skin,
I cannot complete the ritual.
You must trust me.
Get the candles.
- Ben? Look at me.
- Do not look at it.
- You've been swayed against your will.
- You must cut me, then yourself.
A blood sacrifice is required.
Now yours.
Do you willingly give all that I ask of you in this cause?
- Yes.
- We must be very clear on this.
- Yes.
- You have not been coerced?
- No, I willingly give.
- Then spill your blood.
: No!
- Downstairs! Quickly!
- For God's sake, there's no lock!
- We must get downstairs!
- And that'll hold her?!
- Just long enough! Go!
Make space!
We must draw a double-edged circle to protect us both.
Hurry! Now!
Stop!
Do not stand on or over the circle.
Exit and enter only through that gap.
Once everything is prepared, we will seal the circle from inside.
More candles. Now!
Baal.
Xaphan.
Samael.
Lilith.
Lucifer.
White candles around the circle.
Give me the knife!
Damn it, man!
Our lives depend on it!
The Flesh of Mankind harnessed.
The Bone of Mankind harnessed.
The Mind of Mankind harnessed.
Stay inside the circle.
If you value your life, do not leave it.
We are ready.
Let the demon bitch assail us.
- Joe?
- Ugh?
- Shacked up with the enemy, Ben? Ha!
- No, no. Joe...
- It's not real, Grogan.
Stay in the circle!
- After all those missions.
After all the boys we lost.
- It's not real.
Ha!
There's nothing there.
It's just an apparition.
A trick.
Nothing more.
- Why don't you start?
- The demon must be present.
- Why would she come down here if this will harm her?
- She will come down here because she is hungry and we are the freshest meat, the tastiest dish on the table.
- What the hell is going on?
- Quiet.
- What were you expecting, my love?
The Devil?
- Don't listen to it.
- Ah!
Efficient and organized.
Haven't you wondered why I'm attempting to entice you rather than him?
- He knows what you are.
Does he?
- And I know you, too.
: No, you do not!
: See, Grogan?
This demon cannot abide defiance.
This is the truth of it.
The abomination that seeks to seduce you.
: I wonder, Captain Grogan, do you really consider you've backed the right horse here?
These goblins in black uniform plan to enslave your world.
Do you wish to hand them the means on a plate?
: Do not listen to it.
- Their leader has long been searching for so-called wonder weapons, magical items with which he will kill your people... in multitudes.
He already holds the Holy Lance.
He had within his grasp the Ark of the Covenant.
He tried to awaken the Great Old Ones.
And now he has within his reach the power to summon Lucifer himself.
: Do not listen, Grogan.
It will try to divide us.
- I've laid bare my true self,
Captain Grogan.
Has he?
- I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob and Astaroth!
How long is this gonna take?
- I must incant the dismissal for as long as necessary, to weaken it.
- It doesn't seem to be getting any weaker to me.
But I am, Ben. I am.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- I'll be gone from this world if you allow him to proceed.
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Do you wish to lose me forever?
- Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- There were happy occasions weren't there, my love?
In the short time that we had.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
- When you held me, kissed me, made love to me...
- Helena...
- Her name is not Helena!
She is a She-Devil!
A Femme-Varou!
- I've followed all your battles.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- North Africa...
Greece...
Italy...
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Always in the front line.
Driven beyond reason by a desire to be with me again.
You don't have to do that now, my love.
I'm here for you.
Come to me.
- Grogan, in God's name!
Do not break the circle!
- Have you missed me, my love?
: Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- I can be this way for you always.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
Don't be a fool, Grogan!
Don't let her deceive you!
She's a devil, a desecrator!
- Listen to him, spewing his bile.
- I command thee in the names of Peor and Nyarlathotep!
I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of the Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob, Astaroth!
- Do you know why I'm not desecrating your flesh, my sweet?
- Hear ye, fallen ones, dead names, lords of the Netherrealm!
Receive back into thy clutches this prodigal beast who is condemned to return to thee!
- Why I'm not devouring your soul?
- Balor!
Choronzon!
Adramelech!
Chancellors of all the darkness!
- The flesh of a good man is rank to me.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- The flesh of an evil man...
Give me the Nazi and you're spared.
- No... No, I need him.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- You poor fool.
Be bound and obey...
- Look.
- ...my command!
: You son of a bitch!
- Fuck you, Hell whore!
Did you honestly believe... a loyal servant of Germany would hand you over the book and betray his country?
As a willing sacrifice, you are now the agent of our success.
And when I'm recognized as the architect of this triumph,
I will rise and sit beside Hitler himself.
All I need now is the power contained within the power of a brave and beating heart.
And that is the role you play, Grogan.
How fortunate that you came here to embrace your destiny.
- You'll create Hell on earth.
- We already have.
- Time you saw the real one.
: Give him to me!
- No, please.
- Give him to me!
Embrace your own fucking destiny!
- No! You can't harm me!
- The deceiver deceived.
At last we are together, my sweet.
Did I not warn you of the price when first you imprisoned me?
You, who have butchered so many... you're still novices in the game of death.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
Are you trying to dismiss me?
I thought you liked me.
- Stay back.
- Oh, look.
Some thoughtful person has built a little bridge for me.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
I command thee, demon...
- Ben, your hand is hurt.
Let me look at it.
Let me.
Ben...
Darling...
You still fear me?
- Yes.
- But...
I believe your yearning for Helena is stronger, yeah?
Huh?
Ah...
What's wrong, my love?
- You think I don't know my own Helena?
- Ben...
- Her taste? Her smell?
- Ben...
- You can never replace her.
: No!
You cannot do this to me!
You wish to make an enemy of me for eternity?
Unchain me now!
You bastard son of Adam!
You're no better than the ones you despise, the ones you fight against.
- You should be thanking me.
Every one of those German sailors coming has a wife or a lover.
And all the others after them.
Plenty of fresh meat for ya.
- And when there are no more lambs to the slaughter?
- We'll return, send you back to where you belong.
- How the righteous have fallen.
- Ah, the enemy must be stopped.
This war must be won.

6th JUNE, 1942
No Jews - By Order
Hi, Raymond.
Weismann.
What are you doing there?
Can I go to school with you?
The star, is that right?
What's the problem?
We're Jewish, aren't we?
And proud of it, too!
Come on.
How about that!
They seemed like such good kids.
At least now we won't get them mixed up.
Field Marshal, here we are!
Facing you, the savior of France
We swear, we're your men
We're here to serve and follow you
You could've waited for me.
Mum insisted on walking my brother and me to school.
You've given us new hope
The nation will be reborn
Field Marshal, here we are!
Right, the first one of you to mention that blasted star gets his arse kicked.
Clear?
Yes, sir!
File in, two by two.
In silence, please!
C'mon, lads.
When surgery can do nothing, as with the faces of these Great War vets, a facial prosthesis can be fitted.
This technique...
Stand up, ladies!
Please sit down.
Now then, ladies...
You may have been told that Jews have pointy ears, hooked noses and goodness knows what else...
Curtains, please.
As you can see, your fellow students look just like you.
That's why you will help Esther and Sarah to escape through the courtyard if the Germans arrive.
I'm relying on you.
Thank you, ladies.
100,000, Field Marshal.
Vichy, unoccupied France
How many did you say?
100,000 Jews.
Foreigners, most of them.
Even so, that's rather a lot.
How many Israelites do we have in our own camps?
10,000. The advantage is that they're foreign Jews.
If the Germans take back the scum that's fled here since '33,
I've no objection.
Neither do I, obviously.
But...
10,000 falls a long way short.
Offer them to the Germans, though.
I have.
Just in Paris, over half the Israelites are French nationals.
Not to mention their children, all born in France.
The Germans won't take the children.
Won't they?
Not for now.
What are we supposed to do with them?
- Hello, Violette.
- Hello, children.
- You coming, Simon?
- Yes.
- Hi, Tati!
- The terrible twosome's back!
Hands off my radio, you!
Don't worry.
Evening, Ida.
- Good evening, children.
- Evening, Captain.
Hi there.
How's my little tiger?
Hi, Mum.
You're all sweaty.
Look...
Top of the class again.
What have you forgotten, Simon?
Can I go with him, Mum?
Please, can I?
Don't be late.
School's not finished.
- Okay. Thanks.
- You have homework to do.
- Hi, Dad.
- Don't forget my tobacco!
Don't worry.
That was André Claveau and his Orchestra.
Now the racing results.
At Auteuil, the Princes' Handicap was won by Isaac.
The horse's name, not the jockey's, of course.
Now they wear yellow stars, it's a shock to see Paris crawling with Jews.
Hard-working Jews!
In Montmartre,
I counted 268 yellow stars.
A victim of its own generosity,
France has been swamped.
Sura!
Which means?
Explode with an onion up your arse!
That's the third time this week.
Put a sock in it!
We have a job for you.
What kind? Hope it's nothing like the last one...
When a viscount meets another viscount
What do they say?
"Viscount, how are you today?"
When a marquis meets another marquis
What do they say?
"Marquis, how are you today?"
Come on, Nono, let's go!
It's just some little Jewish scamps.
Wait for me, lads!
Don't be so mean!
- Tomorrow, we'll try a posh area.
- What's "posh"?
Rich, you mug.
The rich leave a long stub.
We'll visit the Eiffel Tower, at last.
What's that?
Remember that exhibition?
"The Jews in France"?
What a load of shit!
It's not even scientific.
- Looking at your profile...
- What about my profile?
It makes you wonder.
Very funny.
What was that stink at the bistro?
Their sauerkraut.
It's chock-full of pork.
Germans don't eat kosher?
It's dark in here!
We'll die of suffocation!
I'm late for my customers.
Who are they for?
The Traubes.
Some people have such lovely things.
Look at Renée's blouse!
Hands off, you!
Titanic's on at the Gaumont.
You know Hitler blames the Titanic sinking on us?
Really?
Iceberg.
Another damn Jew!
- How can you joke about it?
- Rachel, my girl...
Read me Gone With The Wind instead of grumbling.
Rachel!
You'll only cry again.
It's good to cry if it's not for real.
I've got a head this big and I hate Jews.
Jews won't be laughing for long.
With this prophecy,
I will have the last word.
They will disappear from the face of the earth, annihilated and obliterated!
We must hurry, Himmler.
Before the international community starts an outcry.
Have you read Sun Tzu?
The Art of War.
Remind me to give it to you.
Everything is taking place as I described in Mein Kampf.
Page 771, mein Führer.
They must learn to take me at my word.
Mr. Jacques first, by the church.
We've done him.
And those loaves...
Go on, scram!
This isn't a circus!
It's a respectable business!
Why doesn't the baker want Jews in her shop?
Because she only likes barb-aryans!
- What's going on?
- Get lost!
Thank you!
Pancakes, yummy!
Simon!
Hello, Father.
Hello, boys.
The Nazis and collaborators forget something.
Why did you call him "father", the man in black?
What's that?
Their Christ was a Jew!
- You're joking?
- He was some kind of rabbi.
And they don't know?
Why'd you call that man "father"?
If he came back today, their Christ, he'd be wearing a star.
Blow me down!
The man in black isn't your father.
And that's all!
31 Avenue Foch, Paris. Gestapo HQ
It's too premature.
You promised to hand over your Jews.
I promised nothing.
- I said...
- What's wrong, Bousquet?
- I said I'd talk to my superiors.
- That's a joke.
Don't let your resolve weaken so close to our goal.
Must we bring troops from the front to do the job ourselves?
You couldn't!
- You imagine refusing?
- I didn't say that.
- 100,000 Jews is too many.
- 20,000 isn't enough.
The Führer would not understand if you refused to cooperate.
He'd interpret it as provocation.
An insult.
Look, you empty it out like this.
Careful you don't make a mess.
Sura, did you see my rolling papers?
No, that's not the tobacco.
It's the solvents, the paint.
My papers, darling?
In the dresser.
In the drawer.
On the right.
The second one.
You don't even know who smoked them.
What if he had tuberculosis?
No danger of that.
I pinched them off some Germans.
- Great big fellas, they were.
- Bastards are fighting fit!
I hope they all rot from cholera.
Can I practice now?
Can I? My audition's on Monday.
Can I start?
I don't think Shabbat's ended.
One... two, three...
Three stars, Sura.
Shabbat's ended.
Don't you believe me?
No.
Jo...
Come over here.
It's true, Mum, honest.
Go on, put your ballet shoes on.
Five police training schools.
I know what's coming.
Our government must reassert itself.
We need new training schools.
No more paramilitary police.
- No more Police for Jewish Affairs.
- Darquier'll be pleased.
His militiamen are exemplary.
They're thugs.
- Rabble.
- Who do the dirty work.
They don't have the file of Jews.
We have it.
Can't you change the music?
I like Chopin.
He was Jewish, wasn't he?
Sura, not all geniuses are Jews.
I'll get you!
Stop that.
I have a suggestion.
We organize everything.
But you restore our police's authority.
If all goes to plan,
I promise the Führer will listen favorably.
Vanda Lesniak.
Sarah Landeau.
Annette Monod.
Lucienne Dufresnes.
Goodbye!
Have a good holiday!
Look, Mum, I won the prize!
That's wonderful, love.
What's wrong?
Come on, let's go home.
We'll pay for private lessons with Prof. Grunstein.
He's banned, too.
That way, you keep your teacher.
Dad, private lessons are expensive!
So? I'm not a cripple, am I?
Listen and remember this forever.
They can ban you, but they can't ban your talent.
The war will end one day.
All wars do.
- We must leave right now.
- And go where?
The Ritz?
They're dismissing Jews from universities, the civil service...
Everywhere, Dad.
The nursery school head... she's been fired.
Have you read the papers?
Have you seen what they call us?
"Undesirables". That's what.
What more do you need?
How can 5 of us get out?
How can we cross the border?
With what money?
Mr. Finkel and his wife tried to make it to Spain.
Now where are they?
At Drancy internment camp.
You want that?
Do you?
"9th decree of 8th July, 1942,
"concerning measures against the Jews.
"It is forbidden for Jews to frequent establishments open to the public. "
What does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means.
We're banned from cafés, restaurants, concerts, libraries, fairgrounds...
They should say where we can go.
It'd save ink.
What do you think?
I preferred things the way they were.
"Restrictions on entering shops and businesses... "
Honestly, Laval, you've read it too.
"France is not yet sufficiently anti-Semitic
"to accept the mass deportation of Jews. "
Who wrote this report?
- The secret services.
- I always said...
France isn't ready.
Police stations are swamped with denunciations. Overrun.
We can't deport French-born Jews.
The country won't accept it.
Let's turn it to our advantage.
We'll deport the stateless ones.
Personally, I'd feel no dishonor in deporting them to Germany's territories for Jews in the East.
In the East?
East of what?
Any mass deportation would cost me power.
I see.
I'll deliver your answer in person.
In the negative.
I knew we'd reach agreement.
Let's recapitulate.
You start by sending us 10,000 Jews from your camps in the southern zone.
In the occupied zone, your police do the job...
Under French command.
24000 Jews in the Paris region.
That's the quota.
Only stateless persons will be arrested. Austrians, Czechs,
Russians, Germans and Poles.
We'll leave you the children until...
Impossible!
Our social services couldn't cope.
Children should go with their parents.
We'll have to refer that to Berlin.
No Jews - By Order
Just watch what happens.
I knew it.
You should know the law.
You, too.
You have children here?
Of course.
Count yourselves lucky
I don't arrest you.
People end up in Drancy for less.
And don't forget, curfew for Israelites at 8 PM.
8PM's early in summer.
I don't make the law.
Boys!
Nono, we're going.
You're going already?
I'm going to have a baby.
Your Mummy is.
You'll have a brother or sister.
No, it'll be a baby.
The doctor said so!
Nowadays, you don't want to be having babies.
If these ladies are going, so are we. Lucien?
It's silly that you have to leave.
It's outrageous, how they treat you.
My husband made it to the free zone.
But I've had no news in 2 weeks.
I don't know how you do it, all alone with four children.
Are you the new tenants?
We just moved in next door.
We're from the Marne.
My husband works at Les Halles market.
Shall we go for coffee?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Afternoon, Mrs. Traube.
Good afternoon, Sura.
Ladies.
I have some laundry for you to come and pick up.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
You're not in school today?
Not any more, like all Jewish teachers.
I give German lessons to students now.
Enjoy your walk.
Thank you.
What?
What what?
What were you laughing at?
I wasn't laughing.
Hark at him.
In the end, it's proving easier with the French than the Duce or that blasted Franco.
Film the young people, not me.
You're much younger than them.
Spain fights for every one of its Jews.
Mediterraneans, so over-emotional!
Romantics.
That's why we dominate them.
Herr Hitler, can we go and see the deer?
Of course you can, sweetheart.
We'll give them some bread soaked in milk.
Fast and with utmost discretion.
Night and fog.
A total of 5000 men.
Including 4,500 gendarmes,
Mr. Secretary General, and 200 plain-clothes secret servicemen.
Not forgetting 1000 militiamen, all highly motivated.
If my calculations are correct, that's one armed man for every four or five Jews.
We should net 24-25000.
Of whom three-quarters are women, children and pensioners.
That shouldn't be any problem.
To reach the quota you set, we'll have to strip a few thousand of French citizenship.
Isn't that so, Leguay?
So it looks legal, we only arrest foreigners or stateless persons.
We're taking care of it.
Let's say the 14th of July.
Be serious. It's our national holiday, Bastille Day.
In that case, the 16th.
They've got out the file of the Jews.
Evening, Tati.
Evening, son.
Thousands of people listed.
It'll be any time now.
It's nice of you to warn us, Dédé.
Give my love to Momone!
I heard they'll take children this time.
You're mad, my girl!
Schmuel, tell your daughter she's mad.
Children?
Why'd they burden themselves with children?
Sergeant Desnoyers came specially to warn everybody.
You're talking nonsense, my girl.
Thousands of Jews took refuge here like us.
Know what they say in Poland?
France is the Jews' salvation.
- Dad, we mustn't stay here tonight!
- It'll be like last time.
When was that false alarm?
If it makes you feel better,
I'll sleep in the workshop.
We're in danger, too!
Stop it, Rachel!
You'll scare your brother.
They want men for their arms factories.
They won't touch us.
And your father's a war veteran.
I'll sleep downstairs, for Rachel's sake.
Have you seen my cigarettes?
You just want to smoke in bed.
What bed?
There's just a rotten couch.
Full of fleas!
- Why didn't we go to America?
- They turn back communists.
You can go later. I prefer Paris.
Every day, I go to the Sacré Coeur for my models, and every time,
I feel my heart skipping.
Compared to Lublin,
France is a dreamland.
You never saw what Poland was like.
We could tell you stories.
Pétain's no Cossack, whatever you say.
It could be a rumor, but you never know.
Here's what we'll do...
If I hear them,
I'll come calling my cat.
Tati, you don't have a cat.
What a sweetie!
He's a bright one, isn't he?
Why did she say she'd come calling her cat?
The cat's make-believe.
Try to delay them, so we can get out the back.
- Goodnight, Bella.
- Goodnight, Tati.
Mum?
Yes?
I have an idea.
What's your idea?
We should get married.
What do we do with Dad?
We'll invite him.
Goodnight, darling.
You can finish tomorrow.
You'll teach me to speak French good?
Right now?
No, I'm having lots of work to do.
I have.
I have lots of work to do.
Make fun of me.
Goodnight, darling.
What does that mean?
My little Yiddish noggin,
I think you'd say.
You're my little Yiddish noggin.
Goodnight, Mum.
To all Divisional Chiefs, you will arrive at the first address at 4 AM.
All listed Jews must leave their homes immediately.
You will proceed swiftly without needless chatter.
The ethics of the operation are not to be debated.
All arrestees will be taken to the primary detention centre, whatever their state of health or age.
Gas and electricity meters will be shut off.
Pets will be given to the concierge, with tenants' keys.
Arrestees must be in possession of identity cards.
Each detainee is allowed one pair of shoes, two pairs of socks, two shirts, two pairs of underwear, a sweater, a set of sheets, a bowl, a cup, blankets...
Razors are permitted.
Moreover, detainees must take two days' food per person.
You will send childless couples and bachelors to Drancy camp.
All the others to the Winter Velodrome.
Kitty! Kitty!
They're here! They're coming!
They're coming! Wake up!
I'll report you!
There are only poor folk here.
They haven't done anything!
Stay out of this! Back inside!
Go!
That's an order!
The children too?
- Mum!
- The children!
Stop! Don't hurt her!
They're taking the children too!
The children!
- Quiet!
- Run!
Stop!
They're taking the children!
Open up, now!
Run!
It's the Zyglers.
Don't hurt her!
Stop hurting her!
- Vladimir, please take the children.
- You too, Ida.
I can't leave my husband.
Children, don't make a noise.
I'll see you soon.
Where are you going?
Taking my brother to his nanny's.
- Name?
- Louise Timonier.
We just moved in.
What are you doing?
Let's go!
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep out.
They're Jews.
Mummy!
Thanks anyway.
Get the hell out!
I'm missing two from my list.
Louise and Léon.
Where are they, ma'am?
Do you honestly expect me to tell you?
I won't leave!
This is my home.
Your name!
He fought in the Great War!
His Jewish comrades died for France!
How dare you?
Those are my children!
Murderers!
Excellent.
Only four suicides so far, sir.
And almost no fighting.
Yes, but how many have we got?
What time is it?
7.30, sir.
- I said, how many?
We're below target. Look lively!
Ida...
Get your paws off me!
Idiot!
Open up. Police!
Open it or we'll blow the lock off.
What are you doing?
A madwoman jumped with her brat.
I don't want an epidemic.
My God!
Who was it?
We know everyone here.
Who cares, they're dead.
Right, how many Jews here?
We've got five.
Sura, Charlotte, Rachel,
Joseph and...
Stupid dago name.
Schmuel Weismann.
- He isn't here.
- Where is he?
Deceased.
It doesn't say so here, ma'am.
Last week.
Embolism.
Just to repeat myself, you're allowed
2 days' food, clothing...
Hurry up!
Girls, help me!
Take warm clothes, they'll come in handy.
Where are you taking us?
Chop chop!
Get some crockery.
Nothing breakable.
No need, you'll get them there.
Forget that, too.
You won't need it there.
Where's "there"?
Why won't you tell us?
I don't know and I don't give a damn!
Quick or I'll get the Gestapo.
You'll change your tune.
Don't try to escape, we have orders to shoot.
Move!
For Poor Relief.
Shouldn't we tell Dad?
That's an idea I like.
So, not a widow after all?
Hubby's embolism all cured?
Get the champagne!
What's embolism, Mum?
It's okay, Jo. You didn't know.
Gently, please!
She got out of hospital yesterday.
You think they'll hurt my teddy?
They can't. It's a toy.
I don't understand.
Are you okay, Mum?
- Are you sure?
- Not a word.
Otherwise, they won't let me come with you. Not a word.
- Your papers!
- Leave it, Momo, she's new.
Mona, make any cash last night?
Want a jar at René's?
Yeah, sure...
This strip of a girl? A prossie?
With a sprog and no tits?
As if you don't know how twisted you men are.
Come on, Mona, let's have a drink.
I know where we'll hide her.
You're the Zygler girl, aren't you?
We'll take her to Father Bernard.
And Professor Traube, where's he?
At Collège St. Vincent, with his students.
He's an early riser for a teacher!
Those kicked out of their schools have no choice.
Remind me to send a van to St. Vincent.
We have a Jew to pick up.
One Saul Traube.
You have ten minutes.
Food for two days, one small suitcase.
You understand French, don't you?
- I have my orders.
- Not orders to peep, though.
Run up to the attic and hide.
- What are you going to do?
- Warn Dad.
I've got to beat them there.
Take your coats.
They'll think you left.
I'll try to delay them.
Go on!
The little bitch!
Check upstairs.
Stop it!
Not so proud now, eh?
- Good riddance, I say.
- Shut up!
What'd these kids do to you?
Where are they taking them?
Jerusalem!
Death to Jewish vermin!
I'm not vermin!
Die!
Look, Mum, it's Jo!
Mum, grab him!
- We can keep him.
- I'm not allowed to.
Goodbye, HéIène.
- That's enough.
- Goodbye, Sura.
Goodbye, Jo.
If anyone escapes, hostages will be chosen at random and shot.
Is that clear?
I'm sorry, Dad.
Sorry for what, son?
Isn’t it better, the whole family together?
I'm a war veteran.
I want to know where we're going.
- Are we leaving France?
- On my word as an officer, no.
I believe you.
Let's face facts, we've failed.
With all due respect, sir,
13,000 people, you call that a failure?
A mere 10,000 Jews missing!
They had accomplices.
To arrest more Jews, we'll have to search Aryan homes.
From now on, you must never say your old name, nor your little brother's nor other family members' names.
You must forget your old address, your school, your classmates...
You must change your date of birth, your religion and everything else.
Do you see?
It's a question of life or death.
Thank you.
I know what you risk.
To fight Hitler is to fight the Antichrist.
Excuse me, the Winter Velodrome, please?
The senior doctor's expecting me.
I'm looking for the consultations room.
- Who are you?
- Annette Monod.
Let go of my wife!
Miss! Our son has a bad fever.
I won't be a moment.
Can you tell us our new address?
Our children might worry.
We've been without water for 2 days.
Please, do something.
I'll be right back.
Where are we going?
My daughter has measles.
I won't be a moment.
Are you alone?
I beg your pardon?
I asked for reinforcements.
I'm sorry.
What's your name?
I only have 6 nurses, including you, for 8000 people.
Ask Matthey Joanis at the nursery what you can do.
Do you know if doctors are coming?
No.
I have 60 volunteers ready, but they want no witnesses.
They dragged Jews from hospitals, old folks' homes, asylums even.
We have lunatics here.
Appendicitis cases who'd just been operated on.
And the usual children's diseases.
Measles, scarlet fever, chicken pox...
Typhoid even.
I never saw chaos like this.
And in the pharmacy?
Methylene blue.
And two stoves to sterilize syringes.
45 minutes to give an insulin jab.
On the front in '14, it was better.
- You were there?
- Ambulances at Verdun.
I lost my eye there.
But the other misses nothing.
Where do I begin?
We just received some milk.
Under-4s only.
There's not enough to go round.
I've been a good boy.
I'm sure you have.
My teacher said so.
I believe you.
Why can't I leave then, if I've been a good boy?
I've no idea, little man.
I don't know why you're here.
We need to tell Mummy we're waiting here for her, me and Simon.
We live at number 12.
Number 12, fine. I'll remember.
You have family here?
Yes, my brother's outside.
What's your name?
Noé Zygler, but you can call me Nono.
Okay.
That boy's mother died this morning.
A hemorrhage.
Poor woman died on the way to hospital.
The boys don't know.
Which is your brother?
I am.
- Is your father here?
- He's in the free zone.
At least, I think so.
My big sister and little brother got away.
You two are all alone here?
We're here. Their neighbors.
They're with us.
Look, Mummy gave it to me before she went to hospital.
There's her photo inside.
Your Mummy's very pretty.
When does it begin?
What, darling?
The show. The bicycle race.
We're the only show here, Nono.
- Where are you going?
- The Red Cross. Can you help?
- Depends.
- Leave me alone!
You're trying to get out?
Are you alone here? No family?
Nobody?
Go and see the chief plumber,
Roques.
He has blank permits, Ausweis.
He can help you.
Go on.
I didn't tell you.
He can help you, too.
Why don't you ask him?
Who'd look after them?
Come on in, madam.
A fine case of chicken pox.
I never saw so many Jews.
How can they hurt us?
There's too many of us.
It's too much work.
Why are we here then?
I know where we're going.
We're going to Pitchipoi!
Where's Pitchipoi?
Near Timbuktu.
Why's everything you all say so confusing?
I heard we're being sent to the arms factories in Poland.
There aren't any in Poland.
But there are salt mines.
I saw them when I was a kid.
You get on a little train and go underground.
And you know what the workers built in the salt? Do you?
Do you know?
What about you?
A cathedral. A real one.
In the salt.
With candelabra and pews.
We can build a synagogue then.
The doctor sent me.
You're the chief plumber?
Yeah.
I won't shake your hand.
30 blocked crappers.
- Who's it for?
- Me.
- It'll never work.
- Why not?
We got two Jews out today.
Two men, in our overalls.
With your figure...
They're not that stupid!
Give me the Ausweis anyway.
In my top pocket.
Take the pen out, too.
How do you spell your name?
Roques, with an S.
If anyone asks, say I'm your wife.
I can cope with that.
- Does that look okay?
- Let's hope so.
Now it's got my name on it.
Thanks.
And good luck.
Say it to them.
I brought my husband his lunch.
He's the chief plumber.
I'll go with you, just in case.
Hold on.
How do I look?
Full of nerve.
Let's go.
Not him!
- Who is he?
- He knows I'm Jewish.
Miss!
Well played.
Quick, before he changes his mind.
Little girl.
Thanks.
Here.
I told you.
Why'd no one listen to me?
Rachel, please, not in public.
You're always so trusting.
It's all your fault.
A father protects his family!
Rachel, be quiet.
Look around you.
I wasn't the only one.
We all trusted them.
Your father's right.
We all trusted them, all of us.
You're Protestant?
A pastor's daughter.
- Practicing?
- Yes.
I still believe.
I wanted to say...
I'd no idea what was going on here.
I never imagined this.
They gave you no special instructions before they sent you here?
Sure.
So, what were their recommendations?
To stay silent about what I saw here.
Not to mix with the detainees, to keep my distance.
One day, they'll be called to account.
Who?
The men who ordered this.
They'll have to pay.
You must stop your children from gathering by the rails.
Firemen!
Water!
Water!
What do we do, sir?
There'll be a riot.
I wouldn't blame them.
Roll out the hoses!
That's an order.
What the hell's going on?
Who gave these orders?
I did.
You're here to check the hoses, not use them!
I don't see a fire.
Roll them back up! Now!
I'm the ranking officer in this arena.
Step back, Lieutenant.
Attention!
In the absence of a superior,
I'm in command.
And so, I confirm my orders.
Roll them out!
Fall out.
What you're doing is a disgrace.
Hooray for the firemen!
Please!
Over here!
Thank you.
Don't push!
Please, over here!
Thank you.
God bless you.
So my uncle can bring us food.
I've no stamps, but I put 5 francs inside.
Please...
Hurry!
God bless you.
Thank you.
Gentlemen...
I noticed you taking messages from many detainees.
Tomorrow, don't report for duty.
You'll each receive a Metro ticket.
You'll go and post the messages.
As far away as possible, to avoid arousing suspicion.
If by chance you get caught, say you're acting alone, to protect your comrades.
Anyway, do your best.
I'm proud of you.
By the way, Cardinal Suhard...
You read his letter of protest?
"We can't hush the cries of our conscience...
"In the name of humanity and Christian principles... "
What do we do?
Nothing.
He didn't even make it public.
So it doesn't exist.
The Germans are here!
You bastards!
Scum!
Deaths every day, sanitation deteriorating...
I have 100 volunteer doctors waiting for a simple order.
Jews, I imagine.
All you have to do is allow them in.
There's no point.
They're leaving tomorrow.
All of them. Even you.
Murderers!
It can process 8000 units per day.
As long as we finish crematoria 2 and 3 by mid-August.
Ashes, Himmler.
We need ashes.
Ashes don't say how many of them there were.
They don't say if they were men, women or children.
Goodness, Wagner is so depressing!
Can't we change the music?
Who wants a cocktail?
Moi, moi, moi!
Eva, you know what I think of women drinking alcohol.
I don't drink, mein Führer.
I just think up cocktails and test them on Dr. Morell.
Come and try my latest creation.
For heavens' sake, don't get so close to the fire, or you'll explode like a Molotov cocktail.
Dinner's in 10 minutes.
It's Sauerbraten.
If you'd seen the slaughterhouses in the Ukraine, and the butchers wading through blood, you'd soon lose your appetite for Sauerbraten.
It's nothing, just a touch of heatstroke.
Give him plenty of fluids.
Are you okay?
Fetch her cape.
You're exhausted.
You need to rest.
Are you holding up?
Yes, for now.
You know your destination?
The Loiret region detention camps.
Beaune or Pithiviers.
I'd like...
I'd like to go with the children.
I'll support your request.
Thank you.
Get some fresh air, you're very pale.
Want a cigarette?
Thanks, I don't smoke.
I couldn't face that again.
Go ahead!
Resign!
Go on. Rebel!
Not one of you has.
Not a single one.
Is it normal, what's going on in there?
They had it coming to them perhaps?
It's easy for you to say.
I'm a soldier.
I could get shot.
- I have kids, you know.
- So do they!
They've got no supplies.
There's a grocery opposite.
Why not let them buy food?
I have orders.
Orders to starve children?
They're leaving already?
We're evacuating the whole stadium.
About time, too.
It's not even a real train.
Keep moving!
Keep moving!
That way!
People: 40
Horses: 8
See, Jo, we haven't left France and we're all together.
Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp,
100 km south of Paris
Look, Simon, a snail!
Come back here.
It's so hot!
And it stinks in here.
Probably, the people before us.
Where are they now then?
Stop it!
You can't get away from me, you grub.
Stop...
That tickles.
Mrs. Traube!
Where's Hannah?
And your husband?
I don't know where they are.
I saw your daughter.
- Where did you see her?
- At the stadium.
My God! In that case...
Where is she now?
There are other camps nearby.
You need to ask.
You'll find her.
I'm glad to see you again.
Same here.
He's the last one.
My feet are killing me.
All done!
I don't get it.
I heard they're going East.
With no warm clothes.
It's Autumn soon. They'll freeze.
What do you think?
I think the Germans are organized.
Too efficient sometimes.
Do you trust them?
Here...
Sulking?
You don't care about me anymore.
You know I'll never abandon you.
You're my little Nono.
When will Mummy come back?
She's tired from delivering your brother.
My brother?
What's his name?
He's called...
Julien.
Do you like that name?
And you? Do you like it?
Where've you been?
- Go and play. What's the game?
- The roundup.
I'm sick of always being the Jew.
- You can be the gendarme.
- Come on.
Soup!
The Loiret camps now house almost all the undesirables.
They're teeming with Jews, who infested France like parasites.
Turn that off.
It really gets me down.
There's nothing in the soup.
They won't last long on this.
Did you see the daily bread ration?
Go and tell the authorities.
I wrote to the Prefect.
I've gone on the same rations.
What? Don't go playing the martyr.
It's the only way to prove it's insufficient.
You think they don't know in the Prefect's office?
I'm not hungry.
Go on, take it.
You think we'll be grown-up one day?
I don't know.
They don't just want us dead, they want us to suffer first.
Don't do that. It's all there is.
It can't go on like this for centuries.
Proletarian revolution.
That's the answer.
Another bloodbath?
What the Jews need is a land.
A country we can call our own.
Zionist?
- Communist?
- Trotskyite. Him, not me.
My wife's religious.
I bet they put bromide in it.
What?
So you can't get it up.
What do they care if I get it up?
Young man!
To stop us reproducing.
Get up.
Get up, your brat!
I didn't do anything, sir.
You just spat.
Not at you. A weevil.
- He's telling the truth, sergeant.
- Keep out of this!
I didn't do anything, sir, honest.
Sergeant to you, you runt!
Don't! He's armed.
Think of your family.
He's on the next convoy in any case.
As for you, doc, stay in the infirmary or I'll relieve you of your duties.
Can't you sleep?
Perhaps your sister was right.
I should've protected you.
Don't say that, Dad.
Dear Sir,
I received no reply to my letter.
In it, I described the sanitary situation here.
The detainees live in conditions of malnutrition and neglect unworthy of our institutions.
I invite you to come and see for yourself.
After 3 weeks on the detainees' diet,
I've lost over 14 pounds.
Nearly all the children are ill.
Come to our aid.
These civilians are guilty of no crime.
Sorry if I'm interrupting.
No, come in.
You still hope to get a reply?
I'll go there if I have to.
You can't keep starving yourself.
We need you here.
It's the only way I've found.
If you're sick, who'll care for them?
And the next ones?
They won't stop now.
There'll be more roundups, more detainees.
I'm relying on you for when I'm gone.
Tell the Prefect Miss Monod's here.
He knows why.
I told you, it's impossible.
Sir!
I wrote and you never replied.
Do you believe me now?
Can you reach it?
Almost.
Got it.
How are my mother and Renée?
- Fine. You want me to fetch them?
- No, no time.
Tell them I'm in Limoges with Dad.
Louise and little Léon are in hiding, too. Don't worry.
Thanks.
Give my mother and Renée my love.
- Okay.
- See you.
How was she?
Fine. She was all pink and everything.
She sends her love.
Toffees from Brittany!
Do you want one?
No, thanks, we're fine.
Here...
You too.
Can I have another one?
Wonderful!
- Can we eat it?
- Of course!
Darling, do you want a bit of your godfather to eat?
At last, I can feast on mein Führer.
Who's coming for a swim?
I just spoke to Berlin.
The French want to deport the children with their parents.
Why's that a problem?
It's impossible.
We're behind schedule on crematoria 2 and 3.
We can't keep up.
Find an excuse for the French.
Tell them whatever you want.
There aren't sufficient trains.
The Germans can't deport the children before mid-August.
That's very regrettable.
How can we overcome this setback?
I say they're sponge cakes.
No, they're biscuits.
They're rich tea biscuits.
I heard there's a factory that way.
When I grow up,
I'll work in that factory.
Cut it out, lads, they're waffles.
Children! Come here!
We have sponge cakes!
Hurry!
Take it easy, eat them slowly.
Come on...
Everyone will get one.
Take it easy and enjoy them.
There's one each.
Imperceptibly
You took over my life
Imperceptibly
You won over my heart
First, you were like a friend
Then a sister
We made witty jokes
About happiness
What do we do, sir?
Switch off the radio?
No, leave it.
I like this song.
Everybody up! You're leaving!
Come on, wake up!
Everybody up!
Quickly!
Everybody up!
We're leaving?
The boy has to go with his mother.
That's an order.
Everybody in the yard in 15 minutes!
Is it true they take medallions in the search barracks?
Mine isn't even made of gold.
We'll have to tell them.
You'll tell them, won't you?
I'll tell them.
You're not coming with us?
Not just yet.
I have too many sick children here.
Afterwards, you'll come and live with us.
At Pitchipoi.
I heard that's where we're going.
Of course I'll come.
Just a second.
Well?
It's not appendicitis, it's a minor hernia.
He'll be fit to travel?
Yes.
Go and get ready.
David...
I've been thinking.
I could ask to be replaced...
I could go with the convoy.
Only Jews are sent East.
They'll never accept.
Listen.
You've come as far as you can.
It's time to say goodbye.
I should have helped you escape.
And let the children travel alone?
I'd never have agreed.
I'll send news when I can.
Not your wedding ring!
If they want it, they can come and get it here.
In the shit.
You think I'm stupid?
Thought you could trick me?
Bitch!
Is that what you thought?
You dirty Yid!
Get rid of it.
Next!
Right, state your full name.
Put all you have on the table.
Jewels, cash, deeds...
And no cheating.
You saw what happens to cheats.
Come on!
- We haven't got all day!
- What are you doing?
You're mad!
- Lie on the table.
- Your head at this end.
Is that everything?
Go on.
Next!
I don't understand.
Why are the men over there?
I don't know either.
We're ready.
Due to a lack of rolling stock, your younger children won't be leaving today.
- You can't separate them.
- You have no right!
Keep them in check.
Stand back!
Back to the barracks!
Don't shoot!
Go back to the barracks.
I wanted to catch the train!
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.
The lunatics'll see their kids soon.
You're the lunatics! You can't leave children without their mothers.
Shut up!
Sergeant!
Let me do my job.
That is your job!
Escort Miss Monod back.
Don't separate them!
Let me go!
Take your belongings and leave quietly.
You will never succeed.
You'll never destroy us.
Back in line!
Out of the way! Move!
Attention!
One step back!
About turn!
Quick march!
Pick up your stuff!
Forward march!
You have to live, Jo.
Don't stay here. Find a way out.
Promise me!
I'm getting out.
- Come with me.
- What about your parents?
I've given up hope.
I can't leave without him.
We'll take turns to carry him.
I can't, I have a hernia.
That's okay. Bring it with you.
Stop, it hurts when I laugh.
A hernia's a kind of tear in your stomach muscles.
I couldn't even lift him.
You go ahead.
I'll see you after the war.
No way.
I won't leave you and Nono here.
- We'll wait till you're cured.
- Don't be stupid.
They said we leave in 10 days.
I'll never be better in time.
It's your only chance. Take it.
- Go and hide it.
- Where?
In one of your shoes.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
You have a raging fever.
You should go and see someone.
Who? The doctor?
The one in Beaune.
We don't want you catching typhoid.
Okay?
Do you know the bath song?
The bath song?
No, I don't. How does it go?
By the clear fountain
As I was walking by
The water looked so lovely
That I stopped to dive in
I've loved you so long
I'll never forget you
Bath's over.
Go and get dressed.
Go ahead, children.
Most of them have forgotten their surnames.
How will they ever find their parents?
- You've no idea where they are.
- Poland.
Don't worry.
Why haven't we heard from them?
It's been 5 days now.
The journey takes 3 days.
I doubt they have telephones there.
No news for their children here.
Doesn't that seem strange?
Come on.
Time for your bath.
When you were asked to take in Jews, you did, but in a trickle.
A thousand here, a thousand there.
Always the same with the Americans.
Arbiters of the free world!
What's so strange about the Germans taking Israelite manpower?
Especially with the Russian front.
But morally...
It's disease prevention, not morals.
We put an end to damaging
Gaullist and communist propaganda.
What damage can some women, old folks and children cause?
And the invalids? The disabled?
Why this sudden urge to take on more mouths to feed?
It's absurd. Unless...
- Unless what?
- It's racial purification.
And France is an accomplice to the crime.
Joseph Kogan?
Weismann?
Watch out!
All clear.
What did I tell you?
Come on!
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry.
- Stop it!
- It's not an excuse!
Tastes like shit, this soup!
Corporal! Quickly!
What's going on?
Come back here!
I'll go first.
You okay?
The problem of the Israelite children is settled.
For humanitarian reasons,
I asked for families to be reunited within two weeks.
- Are you cold?
- No.
Are you scared then?
Yeah, I am.
It's not the dead you need to watch out for.
It's the living.
Goodnight.
Miss!
Get up!
Get the children ready, they're leaving.
What?
We're going to see Mummy!
Get dressed!
Don't forget them!
Get up, kids!
We're going to see Mummy!
Hold on, Nono, let's get our stuff.
Not him, he's very ill.
Put him down immediately.
- Put him back in his bed!
- They all have to go.
They have fever.
All the children must leave.
I have my orders.
Help me.
You can't even stand up.
Flowers for your Mummy?
They'll wilt in the train.
Pick others when you arrive.
- Who are you?
- The doctor from Beaune.
- I have to go.
- No, wait!
You're running a raging fever.
Where's Annette gone?
I don't know.
But at least we're together.
The children!
They can't travel alone!
You clearly don't understand.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand. Let go!
Please, don't scream.
I must tell you something.
Let me go.
There's nothing you can do for them.
It's too late.
What?
- They're going to die.
- What are you saying?
They'll be murdered.
On arrival, probably.
Gassed. All of them.
You're mad.
Listen!
I'm with De Gaulle.
There's no Jewish territory out East.
There are camps.
Extermination camps. You see?
Gas chambers.
Some Polish partisans escaped.
That's how we found out.
Most of the parents are already dead.
They don't keep children alive.
It can't be true.
The BBC announced it a few days ago.
The Allies wouldn't allow it.
The camps aren't a "priority".
First, they want to stop the war.
Maybe later, when we're organized, we can sabotage the convoys.
I don't believe it.
- Your full name?
- Bauer Abel.
- Your full name?
- Salomon Thurman.
- Your full name?
- Ylan Kotosh.
Full name?
Simon Zygler and Noé Zygler.
Your full name?
Bernstein, Suzanne.
Full name?
Gilberte.
Gilberte what?
What's your Daddy called?
Daddy.
Label!
Let me out!
Stop, Nono!
I want Annette!
- Let me out!
- Stop it! Let go!
- I want to get out!
- Calm down now!
What are you doing?
Someone'll see you!
PARIS, JUNE 1945
Go inside and get some rest.
She's my wife!
Someone to see you.
Have you found your parents?
No. Nor my sisters.
I have a hundred kids upstairs, but you know... no child from the Velodrome who took that train ever came back.
Have you found anyone?
No.
Yes, I have.
You!
I met some good people.
From the North.
They want to adopt me.
That's good.
I'll be going.
I left my name at the desk.
Will you write to me?
Write to me here.
I'll be here a while.
Go on...
Gisèle!
You're alive!
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
You know him?
We found him near our local station.
He must have been pushed onto the tracks. That's all we know.
He's not very talkative.
So you know his name?
Yes, I know him.
Out of 13,000 deportees, only 25 survived.
None of the 4051 children put on the train ever came back.
Vichy and the Germans aimed to round up 24000 people.
But on the morning of the round-up, brave Parisians helped hide 10,000
Jewish men, women and children.
... more airwaves silent and most explosions in the Iraqi capital.
Further explosions are unfolding in Tikrit,
which is Saddam Hussein's ancestral hometown
as well as blows from similar explosions are unfolding...
Just a few seconds ago, another huge blast shook this city.
Cruise missiles and airstrikes raining down here
in a relentless assault on Baghdad.
There is no doubt tonight that war has begun
and the Iraqi capital is experiencing shock and awe.
Approaching target site three-five-niner.
All right, everybody, listen up.
It is a military storage site. Diwaniya.
Intel estimates possible nerve agents, choking agents, live pathogens, chemical-tipped missiles.
101st has been here all morning, so the site is secure.
Everybody stay focused.
This is it.
Shots fired, right side,
100 meters, tops.
We got shots fired.
Right side, 100 meters.
Let's go. Move. Move!
Okay. Go ahead.
Who's the officer in charge?
Move! Move! Move!
Hey! Who's in charge?
Right here. Lieutenant Asira.
Chief Miller, Met-Delta.
What the fuck are all these looters doing here?
This is a WMD site.
This is a high-priority site.
Look, I don't even have enough men to set up the perimeter.
We got a sniper in this tower right here.
In the big tower on the back?
In the big tower on the back.
I do not have enough men to go in and secure the inside of that compound.
Listen, listen. Intel says we got live chemical agents in this site.
Okay, we gotta move now!
These looters...
I don't know what these people are carrying out right now.
I gotta get into this site.
I'm going in.
Chief, you can't go in.
If you take your team in right now, it's on you.
Gather around. Gather around.
Come on. Listen, here's the situation.
101st sent 35 men and one butter bar down here.
They don't even have this place secure, so here's where we are right now.
Now, the weapons are in the northwest end of the complex.
There's a sniper holed up in the big tower there.
We're going to have to quickly take him out.
I'm going to take a recon element forward.
I'm going to need C-BIST.
- Marshall and Johnson, you come with me.
- Yes, sir.
Two shooters, Potts, Michaels.
I'm going to need EOD.
- Conway, bring Simms also.
- Right here, sir.
- Ready, Chief.
- All right, stand by.
Chief, I gotta talk to you.
This is fucked.
Listen, this is a disaster.
It is a disaster.
They haven't secured dick.
I don't think we should go in yet, Chief.
Let's get some acceptable intel.
No, no, no. Look at this!
Jerry, I got no idea what's coming out here.
I gotta go right now.
Keep comms open. I'll be on five.
Get a second team ready.
Let's go! Move! Move!
Guys, get that shit off the truck now.
Roger that.
- C-BIST?
- Right here, Chief.
I want you to stay right on the backs of your shooters, all right?
- They will take you in.
- Roger that, Chief.
All right. We ready?
Yes, sir! Let's go.
Go! Go! Go!
Move! Move!
The sniper! Hey, Sarge!
Where is he?
He's right up there, but we can't get down the alley.
Okay, everyone, listen up.
Michaels! Michaels, listen. Hey!
The WMD are in this building. I need you to work your way to the rear door here.
See if you can get an angle on that sniper.
I want you to take C-BIST with you.
Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.
Got it, Chief.
Hey, I gotta get across this alley.
I need some cover fire, all right?
Okay.
When the 203 goes, we're going to go all the way down on the left side.
- All right. Stand by.
- Roger that, Chief.
Let's go.
Met-Delta team, go!
Move, move! Let's go!
Move! Move!
I got him. He's on the fifth floor, southeast corner room.
I'm going to draw him out.
As soon as you see him, take him.
Roger.
Now! Now! Now!
Got him?
We got him. Three coming out.
Michaels, send C-BIST over.
Go! Go! Go!
Potts, Keating, go! Go!
Second team, move!
Let's go! Move! Move!
Move it!
In.
Check. Check. Let's do it.
All right. Break out the gear.
I want everyone in full MOPP.
Now you heard Chief. Get ready.
Roll those seals tight.
I got it.
No readings in here, Chief.
All right, Conway, open it up.
Nothing but toilet parts over here.
Is this all pigeon shit?
Yeah, thing looks like it's been here about 10 years.
Yep.
This is no WMD site.
Pack it up.
Hey, Chief, we find anything?
The site's empty.
Standing by.
Hey, where did that intel come from?
Do you want me to double check the target number for you? Because I can.
No, no, we're in the right location.
The schematic's right.
But who did it originate with? I mean...
Hey, did this come from the United Nations?
According to this data, Chief, this is our intel.
Yeah, but how would they think something was there?
This is the third straight time.
Let's go.
You heard the chief. Move out.
All right, pack this shit up and let's go.
Roger that!
Let's go! Move!
Step on it. Let's go.
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper.
Get tight on his exit.
Swing it around. Swing it around.
The DOD guy's here to meet him.
Reporting to you live from the tarmac here...
Ready for the close-up?
Go, go, go!
That's Poundstone from DOD.
How's it going?
Great day.
Yup, you finally got him here.
Well, we feel like we're making progress.
That's important.
So, what about the weapons?
I'm frustrated by that, too.
We're doing everything we can.
We'll find the weapons, don't worry about it.
The whole world's watching.
They want to know where they are.
Make sure Zubaidi and I are in the lead car, okay?
Jack, I want your guys to tail us.
You got it, sir.
- Clark!
- What?
I need the source. I need Magellan.
Do you have any idea how sensitive this is?
We've got Magellan locked up so tight,
I'm not even sure I can get to him.
You're the administration's go-to guy and you can't access your own source?
Lawrie, we're debriefing him.
It takes time. That comes first.
For Christ's sake, I've given you everything I got on the guy so far.
- What more do you want?
- I don't want to hear it from you,
I want to hear it from him.
I'll see what I can do.
How are you?
Welcome home, sir.
We'll make this very brief.
How does it feel to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?
Did you ever think you'd see this day?
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning free to the city of my birth.
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate our liberation from tyranny.
Bravo one, we've got two mechanics taking a look at it.
Tracking on the upgun is pretty well shot
and the comm links are all shorted out.
What's the time frame on a replacement?
I want a squad list, now!
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?
He's in the back, Chief.
Thank you.
Roy, let me meet you over here, okay?
Yeah, I'll meet you in there.
- Hey, sir.
- Good to see you, Chief.
What's going on with the intel?
You don't want to get into that right now.
Well, we gotta talk about it.
There's nothing there. These sites are empty.
We're going to be very careful, or there's going to be a huge shitstorm around here.
What do you mean?
They're blaming us for not moving fast enough.
We have to stay on task.
That's bullshit. The intel's no good.
Let's not make any waves, okay?
They don't want to hear that back in Washington.
All they're interested in is finding something they can hold up on CNN.
Sir, but we gotta talk about this.
The intel is a problem.
Now is not the time, Chief.
Roo! On your feet!
Take your seats, people.
We're here this morning to give the General a check on where we are in our search for WMD and what our plans are for the next 48 hours.
To that end, I'm turning the floor over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.
- Captain.
- Sir.
Welcome, sir.
Today we're going to be briefing you on WMD operations due to take place in and around the Baghdad area over the next 24 hours.
We're continuing to target high-priority sites, since all the folks back home are anxiously awaiting the information that we found these weapons.
We have a detailed media plan we've worked out.
We've coordinated with the public-affairs folks.
We have a good plan that involves the top-rated media in the United States and the UK, so that they're prepared to cover all aspects of the good news.
- Yeah?
- I had a couple questions about the intel for tomorrow.
Are we sure this is accurate?
It's solid. It's good to go.
What's the source?
Well, it's a human-source intel.
But it's solid. It's current as of 0400.
Was it the same source we've been using?
Every site we've hit on the way up here, we've rolled a donut.
Chief, how about we do this?
Let's talk offline.
Give me a list of the places where you went, and the grids, and we'll make sure that you had the right information written down and that you went to the right places, okay?
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.
Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.
Don, hold on. Hold a second.
Let's hear what the chief has to say.
Okay, sir, I'll give you an example.
We rolled into a site, Diwaniya, last week, okay?
101st took casualties securing it for us.
We got in there and found it was a toilet factory.
I'm saying there's a disconnect between what's in these packets and what we're seeing on the ground.
There's a problem with the intelligence, sir.
Here's the thing, Chief.
These intelligence packages have all been vetted.
They're good.
Your job's to execute them, not worry about how they're put together.
Are we clear on that?
Yes, sir.
Good. Let's continue.
Sir, as I was saying, the intel is as recent as 0400 this morning.
It's actionable and it's solid.
All right, next up is Al Mansour, Baghdad.
It looks like it's some kind of underground storage site.
You got about 12 klicks of open highway to the city, but there's a lot of activity on that road, so tell everybody to keep their heads up.
All right.
Chief?
All right.
We're going to go chem. Yeah?
I'm gonna get all the lead teams up, all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Martin Brown, CIA.
Roy Miller.
Yeah, I know.
I saw you at the meeting.
You're going to the Al Mansour site in Baghdad.
- Yeah.
- You're wasting your time.
UN biological team hit it two months ago.
There's nothing there.
Fuck me.
Here's my card. You're right.
This thing doesn't add up.
The Iraqis don't fight, they don't use WMD, they let us walk in here and find the goddamn cupboard's bare.
There's something wrong here.
We gotta figure out what it is.
If you find anything, you've got my number.
That's affirmative. That's affirmative.
We took on some fire about four klicks back.
Pretty light, though.
Nothing to worry about.
Oh, I gotta get some pictures of this.
Be my guest.
Heads up. Incoming.
Fucking Potts, you red-headed dick.
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief.
Get up here.
Hold on!
Yo, Kurry, let's go.
Please, get back. Please.
I want you to get a couple of the guys and clear out this traffic.
We're too exposed out here.
We gotta keep moving.
Back from the truck.
Sir, take it easy.
Please.
Please, step aside.
I need you to move the vehicle, sir.
Hey, hey, relax.
Easy!
Don't you fucking touch me!
Motherfucker, let's go.
- Hey!
- Shut the fuck up.
Back the fuck up!
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's going on, Sergeant?
Chief, they're pissed off.
They say there ain't no water.
All they want is water.
There's nothing we can do about that.
We just gotta get our vehicles moving.
I want you to get the men back in the vehicles now.
- Hey! Hey!
- Get in the fucking car!
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back in your vehicle!
Back from the truck.
Get back from the truck.
- Don't stop.
- No, sir.
Okay, so we're convening an Iraqi Freedom convention here inside the Green Zone tomorrow.
We are expecting to have representatives from all three main ethnic groups, the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni, angling for different levels of power.
It is our hope that Ahmed Zubaidi will emerge in a leadership position.
Ben, are you satisfied that we're in a good place now?
I think we're in a good place now,
except for, perhaps, the press we're getting from this looting issue.
Okay, well, let's table that for now.
In terms of stabilization...
Zubaidi hasn't been here for 30 years.
Well, he's the best bet we have right now for a stable democracy.
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad who even know who he is.
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.
Our office is extremely satisfied with all the information that we've gotten from him.
Zubaidi's been selling us a crock of shit for years.
This guy is not reliable.
His intelligence is not reliable.
His report chain is not reliable.
This is exactly why people are losing confidence in the Agency, Marty.
You're questioning every single piece of intelligence that's coming in, up to the point where we can't make any progress.
You cannot just hand this country over to an exile no one's ever heard of and a bunch of interns from Washington.
Well, you're a Middle East expert, Marty.
If you got a better idea, why don't you just throw it out here on the table?
We need to use the Iraqi army to help us.
This country is a powder keg of ethnic division.
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only ones who can hold this place together.
We're not selling that to the American people.
- We beat the Iraqi army.
- Right.
Well, they're still out there and they're armed, and they're looking for a place in the new Iraq.
They're going to be waiting a long time.
They didn't all follow Saddam.
There are officers we can work with out there, if we make it worth their while.
Hey, let me tell you something.
We've spent too much American treasure and too many American lives for us to put a Ba'athist general into a position of power.
Have you any idea what's going on outside the Green Zone?
It's chaos. No police, revenge killings every night.
People are asking why we can't stop this.
- We are losing the population.
- Democracy is messy.
Democracy is messy.
If you dismantle this country and cut out the army, you'll have civil war in six months.
I guarantee it.
Okay, let's move on.
We are continuing to hold at the intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three.
Calm down!
Listen to me, please!
- Just listen.
- Sergeant Wilkins!
- Get on the ground!
- My arm!
Hey, what's going on over there, Wilkins?
Chief, there's a local here.
He's out of control.
Perry had to tackle him.
I'm on my way.
All right, back up.
You stay the fuck down.
- What's going on?
- You are hurting me!
What's going on here, Sergeant?
This Hajji says he needs to talk to you about something.
I have no idea.
He goes on and on and on.
Stay down.
Why are you doing this?
Why you do it?
You agree someone do this to you?
Hey, Perry. Perry.
You let him up. Let him up.
You agree?
Up? I can stand up now?
Why you are doing this, huh?
Why you are doing this?
You agree someone put your head in the dust like this?
You agree to be treated like this?
This is not fair!
Hey, calm down.
I'm trying to calm down, but this guy, he put me on the floor!
Are you finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
What's your name?
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul Rahman.
You call me Freddy, okay?
I have information.
I was driving like five minutes from here.
I saw some people, you know, like Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.
They are meeting.
They have a meeting near to here.
I saw you are...
I don't know, you're digging here,
- and I come to tell you.
- Okay, just calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Calm down. Calm down.
Why should I believe you, Freddy?
You think it's easy to come and talk to American?
You think it's easy? I come here, all these people, they're looking at me?
You stick me on the floor.
I want to speak to you quietly, huh.
And you are digging in the ground.
Why you are digging in the ground?
You need to talk to these people.
You know what they are saying?
You think someone can put something in this place with all these people watching and all these people don't know?
It's not logical.
I am here to help you, okay, Miller?
Come with me, Freddy.
Come with me.
Chief, you good?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sir, come this way, please.
Hey, Chief! Chief, what are we doing?
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys.
Freddy, give him your car keys.
My keys?
Chief, you don't believe this guy, do you?
Look, I wanna go real low-vis on this.
I want to take Freddy's car and I want to get maybe one other.
If we roll over there in those Humvees, they're going to see us coming.
I want to take Keating,
Potts, Bronner on comms.
You gotta get me Michaels with the SAW and bring Perry over here.
What's up, Chief?
Hey, you guys ready to go to work?
Hell, yeah, Chief.
Chief, let me talk to you, please.
What?
Chief, our mission is here.
What, you wanna sit around and dig holes all day?
I want to get something done.
All right, here's the situation.
This Iraqi just showed up with information
that about two or three "K" west of here,
there's a meeting taking place right now,
possible high-value targets involved.
So I want to move on it.
In the first car,
I want to take the Iraqi guy, Freddy.
Keating, you're going to drive,
I'll ride shotgun.
Potts, you're in the back covering Freddy the entire time.
The rest of you guys are going to roll in the pick-up truck. Any questions?
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?
We don't.
Get your fucking game face on.
Roger.
- Hooah.
- Hooah!
- All right, let's roll.
- You're not letting me drive, huh?
No, you're not driving.
Weapons ready.
It's Freddy, right?
I'm Potts. Nice to meet you.
Fire it up!
Okay, Sergeant Perry,
I want you to carry on straight.
Take your next left, take your next left and go around the back.
Roger that, Chief.
And if you stop here, it is the house on that corner.
Okay, pull up here.
Pull up here.
Okay, be advised, it is the house on the southeast corner.
The big white house with the wall.
Heads up. Someone's coming out.
There were six or seven men with guns.
All right, we got a guy with a briefcase and another with an AK-47.
Perry, where are you?
You in position?
In position, Chief. We got them.
Black BMW with three men.
I want to take the BMW.
As soon as he comes up our way, we're going to cut him off.
I want to take the BMW and then the house.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go!
Out of the fucking car!
Get the fuck out of the car, now!
Perry, get on that door.
Get on that door.
Zip him up. Bronner, stay with him.
Everybody else, go, go, go, go, go!
On me. Stack on me.
Let's go! Let's go!
Go, go, go!
On the fucking ground, now!
All right, down, down, down.
Clear! This side clear!
I've got no exit. Where's the back door?
Michaels, with me!
Keating, on the stairs up!
Stairs down. Michaels, come with me down! Down!
With you, Chief.
Taking fire!
Look out!
Get ready to hook right.
Hook right!
I got stairs up.
Clear. It's clear.
This is Chief. Give me a sit rep.
This is Potts, got one wrapped up.
Keating, all clear out front.
Chief, this is Perry.
I need you up here right away.
Coming in!
- It's okay.
- Your husband is okay. Perry!
Look, Chief, you gotta do something.
They don't understand what the fuck I'm saying.
- This is the mother, that's the mother.
- Enough! Enough.
Tell her to calm down.
Say, "Calm down."
I don't understand her, Chief.
It's a different dialect.
Don't let her leave.
Don't let any of them leave this room.
There's a body down there.
Don't let them leave.
You got it, Chief.
Ma'am, you can't go downstairs.
You cannot go downstairs.
Stay down.
Shut up! Shut up!
Watch yourself, Potts.
Get Freddy in here. Stand him up.
I gotta talk to him.
Freddy, come here.
- I don't want this.
- Hey, I need you to...
I come to you for information.
I don't want this.
Listen, I need you to ask him questions for me.
Tell him you're my translator.
Ask him... Hey, what is this shit?
What is this? Is this on him?
Yeah, that was fucking in his back pockets.
He says he doesn't do anything.
Ask him his name.
His name's Seyyed Hamza.
Seyyed Hamza. Is this his house?
Is this your house?
Hey, listen, tell him he's gonna answer my questions or things are going to go very bad for him.
Ask him what the meeting was about.
Chief, I just got off the phone.
That license plate belongs to General Mohammed Al Rawi.
The Jack of Clubs.
Shut the fuck up!
Hey, Michaels, do you have that deck of cards?
Yes.
Give me the Jack of Clubs.
Is that the guy?
Was that the guy that went out the back?
Here it is, Chief.
Let me see. Let me see.
- Is that the guy?
- That's the guy. I just saw this guy.
- Bullshit!
- That's the fucking guy.
I just saw him downstairs.
This man. This is Saddam's top general.
Al Rawi? You know who this is?
Al Rawi?
He say he don't know.
Al Rawi's in this house?
This is the guy I saw.
Okay, okay. Time's up.
Okay, get everybody ready. We're leaving.
All right, he's got to know about WMD.
He's coming with me.
Hey, Freddy, I want you to come with me.
- Hey, Michaels!
- What's up, Chief?
Bring them all over to the wall.
Potts, I want you to get the guy.
Get the guy and bring him to me.
Roger that, Chief.
- Just sit him down against the wall.
- Yes, sir.
Sit those guys over there.
Come over here, Freddy. Come here.
I need you to translate.
Tell him I want to know about weapons of mass destruction.
Does he know where the weapons are?
What? What?
What do you know about weapons?
Where are the weapons?
He say only General Mohammed Al Rawi, he know about these things.
The special program is under his hand personally.
He's the only one who know the truth about these things.
Okay, how do I find Al Rawi?
How do I find Al Rawi?
He said, can you protect his family?
"If you protect my family,
I will tell you how you find Mohammed.
"And then from him you will know the truth."
Okay, he's got a deal.
Ask him about the book.
What is it? Is it codes?
Is it diagrams? Maps?
What the fuck?
All right, Scotty, head on down there.
- Shorty, bag them and parade them.
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, you Miller?
- Yeah.
Where are the other two?
Two what?
We're missing two pucks.
- Anybody got eyes on the other two pucks?
- No, no, no!
These are my guys. Hold on. Hold on.
These are my prisoners.
My prisoner now.
Hey! That's my translator!
That's my translator!
What the fuck is going on?
I got a colonel waiting on these guys.
I got orders to get these guys back there.
They're en route right now.
Hey, white bread, calm down.
This goes way up higher than your people, all right?
Please, stand right there.
Come on. That prisoner's ours.
Well, he's mine now. Let's go.
Take care of my family!
What they are doing?
I did nothing!
The book! He's got my book!
Chief, what the fuck's going on?
Fuck!
Yeah, I got him.
He says some guy took a book off him.
- Book? All right, all right.
- Notebook.
He says something about a book.
His what?
You got his book.
He says you got his fucking book.
Do you have the guy's notebook?
Don't fuck around.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Get your fucking hands off me, asshole.
Just give me the fucking book, Miller.
All right.
I fucking asked you nicely!
Fuck you! I don't have a fucking book!
Have a nice war.
All right, let's get out of here!
Get off me!
Hey!
Where's Freddy?
- You mean the guy with the limp?
- Yeah.
He went over by the alleyway.
Fuck! I thought you were watching him.
- Where's my weapon? Where's my weapon?
- Right here!
I gave him the book.
I gave him the fucking book!
Potts, Michaels, go with him now!
Go! Let's go! Let's go!
Bronner, hey! Come on!
Moving!
Go! Go!
Go around! Seal it! Seal it!
You got it, Chief!
Get him, Potts.
Go left! Go, seal it, seal it.
I got him! Stop!
Stop!
Get him! Get him! Get him!
What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!
Why are you running?
Why you are chasing me?
Give me the book.
Give me the fucking book!
Here the book. Here the book.
Why are you... What you are doing?
I was going to bring the book back.
The man is putting Iraqis in the helicopter.
He hit you in the face.
What you want me to do?
What I have to do for you to believe me?
Get everyone back to the trucks.
Roger.
Hey, let's go. Let's go.
What more I have to do for you? Huh?
I come to you with information.
You take the information, it's right.
You want the book. I have the book.
I give you the book.
You think I can leave my car?
You know what this car, it means to me?
Even you have the key!
What happened to your leg?
My leg is in Iran.
Since 1987.
Me, too, I fight for my country.
Freddy, listen.
You give me your information.
I'm going to get you a reward for what you did today.
Reward?
You think I do this for money?
You think I don't care about my country?
I see what's happening.
You don't think I see what's happen in it?
And all the people now, even they have no water, they have no electricity.
You think I do this for reward?
You don't think I do this for me?
For my future? For my country?
For all these things?
Whatever you want here,
I want more than you want.
I want to help my country.
Who is this?
Hey, this is Chief Miller.
I have something I think you'd be interested in.
Listen, I don't have time to play games.
Just tell me what you've got.
Well, this morning I came face to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.
General Al Rawi?
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.
Come in and talk to me.
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace.
By the pool.
- I'm on my way.
- Listen, make sure Johnson runs checks...
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins,
I gotta talk to you.
We gotta go get our prisoner back, find this guy, Al Rawi.
Let Bethel handle it, please.
No. Bethel can't see past the files on his desk.
So, what, you're going to ring the doorbell now
- and ask Special Forces to hand him over?
- No.
I'm going to use the book and trade up and get some help.
What are you talking about?
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep coming up empty on all these sites?
There has gotta be a reason.
Chief, we're here to do a job and get home safe.
That's all. The reasons don't matter.
They matter to me.
With all due respect, Chief,
I can't go with you on this.
Understood. I'm going to split the team.
I'm going to take my crew plus Sergeant Perry.
You report back to Bethel with everyone else, hooah?
Hooah.
Hey, Freddy. You want a job?
Yes.
Good. Get in your car, follow us.
Where to, Chief?
Republican Palace.
This is not a good time, Lawrie.
I've waited long enough.
I told you, I'm doing the best I can.
This is not what I signed up for, Clark.
I put my reputation on the line with these stories.
I am not going to let you hang me out to dry.
Well, there's huge things at stake here.
I'm not going to let them be compromised because you need to sell some newspapers.
You knew the deal.
I give you Magellan, you give me anonymity.
Listen, Clark, I'm done waiting, so is the paper.
You won't help me find Magellan,
I'm going to find someone who can.
Right here.
Can you get me some more beers? Frisbee!
Oh, shit!
Oh, my goodness.
We got enough time for that?
These guys got Domino's Pizza and fucking beer?
Get in the pool, man.
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta go talk to this guy, so you all are on your own for a little while.
Roger that.
Can we have beer?
Not one.
So, what happened?
We were digging at a site.
Local come up to us and give us a tip that there was a meeting going on with some high-value targets nearby.
We hit the house, and it turned out the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.
- You sure it was him?
- Positive.
He had a security detail with him, and we exchanged fire with them and he slipped out during the firefight.
Now that's the book that I took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.
He was the host of the meeting.
And I was in the process of figuring out what the fuck it was when SF showed up and snatched him.
God damn!
Okay, but where did they take him?
Because if you can get me access to this guy,
I'll get Al Rawi.
Look, we're both after the WMD, right?
It's a little more complicated than that.
Well, not to me, it isn't.
All right, I'll make a call, get you reassigned.
There are some empty buildings on the other side of the compound.
Get out of uniform and report to my office in an hour.
Outstanding.
How'd you get the bloody nose?
Oh, that's a long story.
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?
How did you know that?
It's right there on your rifle.
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal.
How's it going?
You know, we haven't found shit yet.
Hey, Sergeant Perry.
We'll find it. It's frustrating, right?
Little bit.
So what are you and Marty talking about?
Oh, you know I can't talk to you about that.
Oh, come on.
You come in fresh off the field to have a lemonade with Martin Brown?
Something's gotta be going on.
Well, you could ask him.
I'm asking you.
Does it make sense to you that we're still coming up empty?
No. No, it doesn't.
Someone told us they were there, right?
If you come across anything, call me.
I'll keep it in mind.
Where's he hiding? Where's Al Rawi?
Where's Al Rawi?
How long have they been going?
For about 10 minutes.
You want to see your wife and kids again?
You have five kids.
You want them to see their father?
He says, "Please, do not involve my family in this situation."
"I swear to God..."
You're involved, so your family's involved.
All I want is an answer, where to look for this man,
and you can walk out of here.
- Where's Al Rawi?
- Where's Al Rawi?
And I want a name or an address.
Somewhere I can find General Al Rawi.
I am going to get an answer,
and you know you're going to tell me something.
All right, I'm going to let go and you're going to give me an address.
Where's Al Rawi? Where is he?
The book! The book!
He says you need the book.
The fucking book again?
What's in the book?
"The book, that's how you'll find him."
It has the names and locations of Al Rawi's safe houses.
Chief Miller around?
Yeah. Up the stairs, down on the right.
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.
A great job bagging Hamza.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
Walk you out?
Sure.
- You're with our MET Team, right?
- Yeah.
Well, the administration really appreciates the work you guys are doing.
We gotta get this WMD issue behind us so we can get on with the challenges of the future.
That's where this Hamza guy could be helpful.
He's confirmed a few facts for us.
Says your guys might have lifted a notebook from him.
Well, everything I got off him 
I gave to Martin Brown.
Why don't you ask him if he's got it?
I don't think Marty would go for that.
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been in the Middle East a long time.
He's got a lot of preconceived ideas.
Our unit's trying to get back to the raw intel.
Look, I don't want to throw Marty under a bus, but he doesn't like what we're coming up with.
The guy's a dinosaur, and we need to get some new thinking going on around here.
There's an opportunity for you here, Miller.
I know Marty's pulled you in temporarily, but if you're looking for something more permanent, I can help.
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.
People are watching us.
I'll keep it in mind.
You do that.
If you hear anything about that notebook, let me know.
Your friend from the Pentagon
Special Intelligence Unit came to see me.
Poundstone?
Yeah, Poundstone.
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD intel you've been chasing your tail on.
What? You mean Magellan?
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?
No.
Poundstone's got him locked up tight.
That's why we gotta find out what's going on.
Here's the deal.
We checked the notebook.
It's a list of addresses around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.
It's a Sunni stronghold, very sympathetic to the army.
More than likely, that's where Al Rawi is.
The notebook's probably his line to his battalion commanders.
We all set?
Not yet. We're waiting on military support.
Push them hard.
I want to get every address in that book.
So, what do you think that meeting was about?
What would you be talking about if you just got invaded?
You think Al Rawi wants to fight?
If we don't make him an offer, he will.
What? You're going to cut a deal?
You're going to cut a deal with the Jack of Clubs?
What do you think you're doing here, Miller?
You're off reservation for a reason.
What is it?
Well, I came to find weapons and save lives.
And I didn't find shit.
I want to know why.
There are no easy answers.
If you want that, go work with Poundstone.
All we got is hard choices.
You want to know what happened to the weapons?
We gotta find Al Rawi and bring him in.
He'll give us the truth about WMD and give us a shot at standing this country up without a bloodbath.
Do you want the job or not?
- Yeah, I want it.
- Good.
Hamza's being held at the high-value target wing at Camp Cropper.
Poundstone's unit have him under wraps.
So, how are you going to get to him?
I'm not. You are.
Here's a pass.
We've got another prisoner there we can use to get you in.
Low-level Republican Guard, way below their radar.
Use him as an excuse to get to Hamza.
Here's a million dollars in cash.
Tell Hamza the money's his if he gives us what we need.
You tell him if he gives Al Rawi to me, keeps his mouth shut over there until I bring him in,
I'll have him and his family out of the country by the end of the week.
You want me to tell him to not talk to the American interrogators?
That's right.
I thought we were all on the same side.
Don't be naive.
Miller.
Pentagon just revoked your transfer.
You're being released back to your unit, effective immediately.
You chose the wrong side.
Follow me, Freddy.
We gotta move fast.
Where do you think you're going?
Let us through.
Step aside, please.
What the hell are you playing at?
Get me Langley.
You are required to hand over all information.
White House authorization.
I want the book.
DC's got too much riding on this to have you and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.
Martin.
Langley confirms.
I've got it!
- Let's go.
- Stay out of this, Marty.
- You all right here?
- Yeah.
Use local assets.
It's high priority.
Stay close to me, Freddy.
Put him down.
OGA.
I'm here to see a prisoner.
Heads up, Sarge. Hey, Sergeant.
Hello, sir.
I'm here to see Abdullah Ferat.
I'm gonna have to search your bag.
What's up with Hajji?
He's my translator.
Arms up, legs apart.
Check it out.
What's that in your pocket?
It's my cigarettes.
- Good to go.
- Here you go, sir.
Go ahead and take them back to IR-1.
Right here.
That's not necessary, Sergeant.
Standard procedure, sir.
Sergeant, I have to have a classified conversation with the prisoner.
You can go on and step outside.
Roger, sir. Be right outside.
Do you know why they brought him here?
He's here because he's in the Republican Guard, Freddy.
Hey, Sergeant.
Hey, listen, this guy just gave us a piece of intel.
You apparently have a prisoner in your HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.
He can ID him for me.
I gotta get him down here and ID him real quick.
You're going to need an EJ-75 for that, man.
Guys, I got a live op going.
I got a team in place ready to move on a target. I gotta do this now.
How long will it take?
Two minutes.
- Just two minutes?
- That's it. Two minutes. Come on.
- All right.
- Good, let's go. Hey, Freddy.
Put those bags on their heads.
OGA coming in for an ID check.
Hey, Hamza.
Get up.
Shit.
Get a medic!
I said, get a medic!
Hey, get the medics on the phone.
We've got a situation here.
He say, "Why did you do this to me?"
He say the general did everything you ask of him in the meeting.
What do you... What meeting?
What meeting?
He just say Jordan.
Clear the way! Clear the way!
What is going on here, Miller?
Coming through! Okay.
What does he mean, "Jordan"?
We gotta stop the bleeding.
His pulse is weak.
I need to talk to you about Magellan.
I'm going to call you right back.
What you got?
I read your articles.
You said an Iraqi WMD source named Magellan met with US officials prior to the war.
I need to know about that meeting.
Oh, no. Come on, Miller.
I can't discuss my sources with you.
Well, did you ever meet the guy?
Do you know who he is?
Of course I didn't meet him.
He's an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.
Then how do you know what he's saying is true?
Because I made contact through a reliable intermediary.
- Reliable?
- Yes.
Have you ever even been to any of Magellan's sites?
You ever been to Diwaniya? Tikrit?
No.
There's nothing there.
Magellan's intel is bullshit.
Who's the intermediary?
No. I'm not discussing sources, Miller.
Jesus Christ!
This is the reason we went to war!
All right, then at least tell me how it happened.
How does this happen?
How does somebody like you write something that's not true?
Tell me!
What do you know?
Look, I got a phone call one day from a senior official in DC.
He says, "I've got a story for you.
"The truth about Saddam's WMD programs."
So I go to meet him.
He puts the source report in my hands.
Magellan's product, the raw intel.
But when do you check the story?
He was a senior official, for Christ's sake.
He had access to Magellan's debrief.
All he asked was that I not disclose the location of the meeting.
The location.
Yes, in case I'd compromise the source.
It was Jordan, wasn't it?
The meeting was in Jordan.
Yes.
You can keep your million dollars.
Al Rawi's Magellan.
They're debriefing Magellan.
They've got him held tight.
Supposing they don't?
John, take care of the money.
Hamza said Al Rawi met US officials in Jordan.
Now Dayne said the same thing about Magellan.
That's more than a coincidence.
Maybe. It doesn't make any sense.
If Poundstone met Al Rawi in Jordan, what's he hiding?
Well, what if he told him something he didn't wanna hear?
What if he told him there were no WMD?
I want Al Rawi's movements outside Iraq.
January, February, 2003.
Anything you got.
I'm on it.
It all makes sense. The bad intel.
Why our teams came up empty at those sites.
Maybe we're looking at this thing the wrong way around.
It's a theory.
You've got no proof.
Don't be naive.
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in Amman,
Jordan on February 5th, 2003.
That's three days before Magellan came online.
Give me Clark Poundstone's movements, same period.
Sir, we've got a DOD Gulfstream on the same date.
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.
Martin, we're getting reports of an attack on an Al Rawi safe house.
South Adhamiya.
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi.
He doesn't want the truth to get out.
I need to know where the next safe house is.
All clear, Chief.
Send Freddy!
Yes, sir! Freddy, on the move.
Freddy, I need you to translate.
Tell him I need to get a message to General Al Rawi.
Tell him I need to meet Al Rawi tonight.
Chief Miller on the phone for you, sir.
- Yeah?
- I got him.
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al Rawi's battalion commanders.
- Where is he?
- I let him go.
Look, I told him to get a message to Al Rawi.
I told him I'd meet him at the Adhamiya bus station tonight.
If I can bring him in alive, then we'll have our proof.
If he talks, then we'll get the truth about WMD.
All right, if you get in front of Al Rawi, offer him whatever you have to.
If you pull this off,
there's still a chance we can hold this place together.
I'm headed there now.
You are serious to do a deal with Mohammed Al Rawi?
You know what already he do to this country?
We're just trying to save lives, Freddy.
There are people who think he can stop an insurgency.
All right, listen up, we're going to Adhamiya.
But look, we're going alone, so weapons check, comms check.
Make sure you're 100%.
We got no support.
- Hooah?
- Hooah!
- You okay?
- Sergeant P, can I get a radio check?
- Go to one.
- Miller, what you are doing?
- Channel one.
- Roger that.
Look at what's happening.
I just need you to do your job tonight, Freddy.
Let's roll!
Thank you all very much.
Admiral Kelly, Captain Card,
officers and sailors of the
USS Abraham Lincoln,
my fellow Americans.
Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.
In the battle of Iraq,
the United States and our allies have prevailed.
All right!
- Yeah?
- This is Briggs.
We got a problem.
My local assets are down.
I got a report saying it was US Army took them out and nobody called it in.
Where's Miller?
Stand by.
All right, listen up.
I need everybody on a Blue Force Tracker.
Met-Delta 85th, XTF.
Sir.
He's moving northwest towards Adhamiya.
- ETA?
- Twelve minutes, sir.
ETA, 12 minutes.
He's meeting with Al Rawi.
Son of a bitch.
He's on his way there right now.
All right, what do you want me to do?
Follow Miller.
He'll lead you right to him.
And when you find Al Rawi, you take that son of a bitch out.
What about Miller?
He's off reservation.
Miller can't bring in Al Rawi.
Don't let him get in the way.
I want to make that announcement.
- Now?
- Just make it happen!
This is Vanguard 6 on the airborne command.
I need a C-2 bird with eyes over Adhamiya.
I want an ISO on all military radio and cell phone transmissions for a three-mile radius.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.
Alpha 1, I need you to divert to Adhamiya Central immediately.
We have a high-value target identified,
Mohammed Al Rawi.
This is a kill, no capture mission.
Roger that.
Here they are.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
We're on our way.
Poundstone's just called a press briefing downstairs.
It's something big, Marty.
This is the bus station.
It's just over there.
Stagger two teams.
I'm going to move across to the kiosk.
You give me 30 seconds to get across, then follow.
Someone just showed up.
I'm going to follow.
Two minutes, people.
Two minutes to the announcement.
He's going out the central alley, west.
Thank you all for coming at such short notice.
We have a major announcement.
This follows in lockstep with our commitment
to eliminate the tyranny of Saddam Hussein
and expeditiously transform Iraq into a modern, functioning democracy.
Ambassador Bremer has just signed an order
immediately disbanding Iraq's remaining military forces.
The Coalition Provisional Authority hereby dissolves
the entirety of Iraq's military and paramilitary forces,
ministries of defense,
information, military affairs, intelligence and national security.
All officers, soldiers, conscripts
and other military figures are relieved of duty.
All military ranks, titles and status are canceled.
In addition, Iraq's ruling Ba'ath Party is dissolved with immediate effect.
Party members will be summarily fired from central and local government offices,
hospitals, universities, schools and other public institutions.
This is the dawn of new leadership in Iraq, and let the world take note,
change is coming to the Middle East at last.
Still moving southwest. Southwest.
Copy that.
You got him?
Yeah, I see him.
I lost contact. 
I lost contact.
Fuck! Get an angle!
Fuck, he's in the vehicle.
- God damn it!
- Stay on Chief!
Where the fuck did they go?
Did he get in the vehicle?
Let's go! Let's go!
This is MET Team "D."
We need help.
American soldier kidnapped!
We need help down here!
All units, we need help in the Adhamiya district.
Copy that, MET Team.
This is Vanguard 6 and TF221.
What's your position and status?
Vanguard 6, we're five blocks south of the Adhamiya bus station.
Kidnappers heading east in two small cars.
Roger that. Met-D, I am en route.
I need you to return to your vehicles and await further instructions.
Falcon 16, this is Vanguard 6.
We have a US soldier abducted.
We need eyes on those vehicles now!
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.
Currently two klicks northeast of Adhamiya.
Establishing an area of perimeter and sweeping Adhamiya.
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.
We gotta get him out of there.
Get me Chief Miller now.
They've taken him. God damn it!
They've taken him.
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.
I've got your two vehicles moving rapidly.
The two vehicles just entered a garage.
There's a large water tower on top of the building.
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.
Alpha 1, I'm going in on foot.
Continue to target. Acknowledge.
This is Alpha 1.
We're three klicks from target area.
All right, put us down.
Find an LZ a klick from here.
Who are you?
General, my name's Roy Miller.
I'm a chief warrant officer with the US Army.
What do you want?
I came here to bring you in.
General, I'm aware that you had contact with a US official in the weeks leading up to the war.
I know you were ready to tell them everything about Iraq's WMD programs.
What programs?
There are no programs.
I told your official.
We dismantled everything after '91.
He told my government that you confirmed that the programs were still active.
He lied about what you said.
That's why we're here.
Did anyone verify his story?
No.
Your government wanted to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.
They wanted Saddam out, and they did exactly what they had to do.
This is why you are here.
Go.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Give me your location.
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.
- We're half a klick away.
- Split up.
Alpha team, take the west side,
Bravo team, take the east side of the objective.
I got north-south. Move to assault positions.
Wait for my go.
Roger that.
So, do you have a message for me?
General, if you come in with me, there are still people in Washington who will work with you.
People who understand that we still need the Iraqi army to hold this place together.
Then why is your government disbanding the Army?
Making us outlaws.
Why take Iraq apart piece by piece?
Why?
I risked my life to tell you the truth about WMD.
"Tell the truth and you'll have a place in the new Iraq," they said.
So where is my place, Mr. Miller?
On a deck of cards?
Why are you really here, Miller?
You were supposed to lead me into a trap.
You will tell me now how they are planning to take me.
Everybody in position?
Vanguard Bravo in position.
Vanguard 6, this is Bravo 1.
We're ready.
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.
We're in position.
You have to come in with me, General.
You will get nothing if you fight us.
You have to come in now before it's too late.
You think the war is over just because you are in Baghdad?
You will see.
It has only just begun.
Let's go.
Grenade!
Go! Go!
Come on! Move!
Let's go. Let's go.
Man down! Hit the rooftop!
Go!
Clear! Stack on Dutch!
Go!
"B" Team, go left.
Last guy with me. Let's go!
I've got something.
Sir, I've got two hostiles headed east.
Sir, I got one more.
There's one friendly in pursuit.
Hold!
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.
Two hostiles and one friendly have exited target site and are now moving through alley northeast of your location.
Keep the area clear.
I'm activating my transponder.
Bring me in.
I want to cut them off.
Down, get down! Get the fuck down!
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.
The targets have lost the friendly.
Targets are now moving north.
Turn 45 degrees to your left, maintain intercepting course.
Turn! Turn!
I've lost visual contact.
I've got them!
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.
Keep going your current direction.
The target is crossing open ground, headed north.
- RPG!
- Shit!
Walk over.
Stop there.
You sure this is what they want back in Washington?
Put that weapon down!
Now, Freddy!
What the fuck did you do?
It is not for you to decide what happens here.
Get out of here, Freddy.
Go home.
We're gonna be locking this area down.
There are gonna be soldiers everywhere.
Go home now, while you can.
Do you think you can form a successful government without Sunni involvement?
This is a new beginning for Iraq.
This is the end of tyranny and the beginning of freedom.
How long will US forces be in Iraq?
As long as they are needed.
Thank you. That's it.
- Clark.
- Mr. Zubaidi.
It's a great day.
Indeed, indeed. Good to see you.
Welcome. Welcome.
How are you, gentlemen?
How are you? Good, good.
So, does this mean there's going to be an election soon?
There's been a democracy deficit.
Can you comment about the action last night in Adhamiya?
Chief Miller.
It's a copy of my intel report.
I wanted to give it to you personally.
Thank you. Is this Al Rawi?
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard about this.
There's some pretty strong language here.
But what's the point, Miller?
Do you think anybody's going to listen to you?
I know what you did.
What did you say?
You made him up to get what you needed.
Magellan. You made him up.
I don't know what you're talking about, Miller.
When you peddled that shit in DC, did they know it was a lie?
Or did they just never bother to ask?
Okay, okay.
Come on, none of this matters anymore.
WMD? This doesn't matter.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Of course, it fucking matters.
The reasons we go to war always matter!
It's all that fucking matters.
It fucking matters.
At ease, soldier.
Do you have any idea what you've done here?
What's going to happen next time we need people to trust us?
Clark!
We're not turning back, Miller.
We won.
Clark!
Son of a bitch. What?
Dad... Dad!
Lieutenant Woodward.
I'm your new commanding officer.
I'm looking for Sergeant Simpson.
You'll need to talk to Corporal
Fraser. He's up top.
I can't seem to find my way out.
Follow the lateral. 30 yards on, it forks. Take the right.
It's pretty narrow but you'll make it.
You'll find a shaft. Left at the top.
25 yards, there's another shaft that'll take you up to daylight.
Thank you.
Psst.
What's your name, sapper?
Tiffin, sir.
I heard something - just through there.
Hear that?
Listen.
You can hear 'em digging, sir.
There. Fritz.
They're gonna break through.
I swear to God, they're bloody breaking through.
Shh, shh!
That sound that you heard, was it like this?
That's it.
That's your heart.
What?
Feel it.
You're hearing your own heartbeat.
Make sure you clip that little fella's claws.
Otherwise the bugger can be dead and still sitting on its perch.
When does your shift end?
Don't make me stay.
Please.
We'll put the billiard room through there, eh?
You ever play billiards, Tom?
Best bloody billiard players in the world, Australians.
- Says who?
- Well, ask anyone.
Best billiard players, best horsemen, miners...
Bullshitters?
Keep a lid on it, you blokes.
Percy, Ginger, go down and relieve the Sneddons.
Righto.
Dug through to China by now.
Well, I'll bring you back some chopsticks, then, eh?
Who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Woodward.
I'm your new C.O.
Are you Fraser?
I'm looking for Sergeant Simpson.
He's dead.
Sapper?
Norm Morris, sir.
Except we call him 'Pull Through' or sometimes 'His Lankiness'.
- Tom Dwyer, sir.
- Billy Bacon, sir.
Answers to 'Streaky'.
Morris, I want you to take over the listening post at...
Where were we?
102 drive left.
102 drive left.
Sir.
Better go with him,
Dwyer.
Sir.
Show me to the officers' dugout.
Sir. Sir! It's this way.
10 more gone.
Three, two...
- Make way! Make way.
- Keep your head down.
Walking wounded and blind.
Make way.
Come on, move! Move!
Walking wounded and blind.
- Here you go.
- Make way.
Come on, sir.
Stretcher bearer!
Forward!
Oh! Oh!
Tiffin! Hey, get up!
Get up.
Come on, son.
For God's sake, Australia.
This is an officer's dugout.
Woodward?
Bill McBride. I was wondering when I'd see you here.
Went to mining school together.
Charters Towers boys.
Bob Clayton, Northumberland
Fusiliers.
Oliver Woodward,
1st Australian Tunnellers.
An explosive man, right, Woody?
Could blow up at any time.
How long you been here?
Two days. It feels like a year.
And if you survive a year, it will feel like a bloody lifetime.
We nearly came a-gutser.
A Fritz machine gunner got a bead on us.
Yeah, it's Boris. It's a farm building.
They call it the Red House.
Solid as bloody Gibraltar.
Our artillery's been blasting away at it for a week.
Well, a direct hit'd make a bloody difference.
Arggh!
They have their own dugouts, you know.
A bit of air will see him right.
You got a home, son?
Wollongong, sir.
Coal miner?
- Gold, right?
- Silver, lead. Broken Hill.
Sweetheart?
Wife.
Wife?
Sweetheart.
You got a photograph, Tiffin?
She's, um...
My mum, sir.
You're not even real soldiers, are you?
I mean, what in God's name are you doing here?
Tunnelling under German lines.
Protecting your trenches.
- From?
- German tunnellers.
Who didn't show up until you arrived and who are now attempting to do the exact same bloody thing.
Your point being?
That it was bad enough my men being shelled from above and shot at from in front.
Now they're being mined from underneath.
If the man is wounded, Woodward, then for Christ's sake send him to the dressing station.
If he's not, then he should be back on duty.
Either way, he shouldn't be here.
If you want my opinion, neither should you.
Good to feel wanted, eh, Tiffin?
Wouldn't like to think we were over here putting our arses on the line for nothing.
Clayton's alright. He's just got the wind up him, that's all.
Hides it well.
People do.
Seems a shame to waste this.
Spot of tea, old man?
Oh, rather!
Mama!
It's alright, Tiffin. It's alright, son.
Hello? Is anybody home?
I found these two little rascals down by the creek.
They don't belong to you, do they?
Oliver, is that you?
Mrs Waddell.
Colin, Gordon, round the back.
Clean yourselves up before your father gets home. Now, please.
Hey, hey, wait.
That's not fair!
I was hoping I might catch Moffat.
Ah. Well, you're too late,
I'm afraid. He's joined up.
Light Horse?
Of course.
How was Papua? You know, we thought the headhunters might have got you.
They took one look at my head and ran away.
Tell you something, though, Mrs
Waddell,
I could have stayed there forever.
Just... why don't you put the nag in the stable and come inside?
We want to hear all your stories.
Come on, mate.
Is that you, Isabel?
- He's a major now.
- Not surprised.
At school, we called him 'Captain'.
He was captain of everything.
And were there complaints?
- No, sir.
- No.
- We wouldn't dare.
- Well, that's our Moffat.
- Woody, Woody, Woody!
- Yes?
Gordon reckons he can hold his breath for one minute and thirteen seconds.
- Can he really?
- Watch.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
Where's he posted now?
Well, we don't know. Egypt, we think.
...sixteen, seventeen...
It'll be the engineers for you, now, I'd imagine.
I'd hate to think I wasted my time training you up.
They've asked me not to join up, sir.
They need to keep the mine running.
Well, it's copper for the war effort.
We can't get it out of the ground fast enough.
God knows how many shells they think they'll need.
- Well, an army needs munitions.
No, an army needs good men, first and foremost.
- Woody!
When did you get back?
How was Papua?
What are you doing now?
Are you going to stay with us again?
- Are you? Oh, can he, Mama?
- Just slow down a minute, Marjorie.
And it's Mr Woodward.
Go and play with Gordon, little man.
- Come on, let's have a battle.
- Alright.
- Marjorie.
- Mr Woodward.
The answers to your questions are - two days ago, hot,
I'll be working at Mt Morgan mine and, thank you, but I have my own accommodation in town.
- Is this for me?
- Oh, yes, but it's very silly.
- They make them for kids.
- No, it's beautiful.
I love it. Thank you.
Doesn't he look wonderful?
Some men are just born to be in uniform, don't you think, Woody?
- It's Mr...
- Mr Woodward.
Yes.
May I have some tea, please, Mama?
Yes, if you refill the milk jug first.
And you can re-tie that ribbon, young lady.
Yes, Mama.
She's so grown-up.
Well, she thinks so but, between you and me,
I think she still has a long way to go.
It's alright.
What now?
- Hey, I outflanked him.
- No, you didn't.
Actually, I believe that Colin has outflanked yours, see?
And my left flank moves forward...
- Mr Woodward?
- Yes?
- Do women ever go down mines?
- I don't think so.
Bad luck, they reckon.
Well, that's good because I don't know that I'd like to be so deep underground.
It must feel awfully claustrophobic.
It's funny. I quite like it down there.
Really? Why?
Snug.
Hmm. Snug.
Marjorie!
- Sorry, I...
- Are you OK?
Yes, I just...
Just go and clean yourself up immediately.
I'm so sorry.
One moment she's an adult, the next minute she's a child.
16 is a very difficult age.
Now, while Moffat's away,
I want you to visit whenever you can.
- You promise me?
- I promise.
Right.
Mr Woodward, I hope you'll forgive my silly indiscretion at the table.
Of course. Think nothing of it.
Well, goodbye, all.
Oh!
Marjorie Waddell, did you have something to do with this?
No, no.
It's my own stupid fault, I'm afraid.
He got into the lucerne this morning and suffered terrible flatulence on the ride over.
I think that's perhaps how we got here so quickly.
So, when I arrived I loosened the girth.
Must've forgotten to cinch it up.
Stupid of me.
Are you sure you're not injured?
No, I'm fine, honestly.
Thank you for the tea, Mrs Waddell.
Mr Waddell.
Oliver.
Isabel.
Anything?
There's something wrong with this bloody candle.
It's just making it darker.
It's not the candle, Pull Through.
It's the air.
Not enough oxygen for it to burn.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Could be worse.
Oh, Tommo, how could it possibly be worse?
Well, they could send us to Hill 60.
What's Hill 60?
Messines Ridge, just across the border, near 'Wipers'.
Blokes from the 40th were sent off yesterday.
Fritz has got the high ground.
Our blokes are trying to fight in bogs - bloody marshland.
Trenches running like rivers of blood, they say.
That's just talk, probably.
Shush, you little bugger.
You'll get us all killed.
Norm...
Aarggh!
Aarggh!
Aaaarggh!
Oh, my God.
How'd you know it wasn't me?
Lucky guess.
Jesus Christ.
Is he dead?
Call it even, eh, Tommo?
Shit!
McBride.
Location?
Say again.
How many?
Right.
102 drive has been crumped.
Casualties?
Two missing - um, Morris and Dwyer.
How's the air?
If they were near the face...
Not a chance. Not a fucking chance in the world.
...they may have found an air pocket.
This strata holds up sometimes.
We struck some in Papua.
It's kind of... dense...
It's pointless - the whole miserable stunt.
Lively, boys.
Steel soles.
German.
Stupid pricks.
Hear 'em coming a mile off.
- Mate?
- I need you to move back.
Mate, are you alright?
Help me here.
Aarggh!
It's Tommo.
Shh!
- Boys, it's Pull Through.
- Boys? Is that you, boys?
Hang on, Pull Through. We'll just...
Easy.
Can you get me out?
I thought I was a goner.
Watch out for your specs.
Easy. Easy.
Didn't think you'd get out of the bloody war that easy, did you, old son?
Morris, can you hear me?
Tommo?
- Tommo!
- Morris, can you hear me?
Tommo! Tommo's in there.
There's a man buried.
Tommo! Tommo! No!
Take Morris up to the dressing station, Fraser.
Come on, Pull Through.
One arrives nearly every day - no stamp, no return address, of course.
But what do they mean?
That I'm a coward.
But you're not. You're staying here and doing your duty.
Shush now, Marjorie.
Mr Woodward knows how to stop the feathers.
So, you agree with them?
Well, let's just hope that there won't be any more.
On the contrary, just a few more feathers and I'll have a whole chicken.
Isabel!
Are you missing Papua?
I worry about the local workers.
Bougainville is just up the coast.
It's a German colony.
If they send the German fleet down...
Good Lord, man! What would the Germans want with Papua?
They've bitten off more than they can chew in Europe.
Anyway, the word is the whole thing will be over by Christmas.
Marjorie, clear away the plates now.
Yes, Mama.
Best put those back, Woody.
William...
It's Moffat.
Mama?
Take the children to their rooms, please, Marjorie.
Isabel, boys, come on. Now, please.
William, tell me.
It's not good news, I'm afraid.
Why would they send the Light Horse to Gallipoli, Oliver?
It's just cliffs, isn't it?
Is it not all just cliffs?
I don't know, sir.
I don't know.
Marjorie.
You don't have to go.
Just because Moffat, you know...
You don't have to go to the war.
I just couldn't bear it.
The point is...
The point is I was kaput, finished, and he got me out.
The point, Pull Through, is you shouldn't have been there in the bloody first place.
Still don't know what I heard, but.
Maybe it really was me heart.
Maybe I never heard no Germans.
Of course you heard 'em.
Don't make no difference.
Oh, fuck, man.
Good on you, Streaky.
Courtesy of the Northumberland Fusiliers.
- Oh, bloody generous of 'em.
- Send 'em our regards.
Probably not a good idea, Corp.
Mmm.
Tiffin?
We was ready to give up on you, Pull Through.
- We wasn't.
- Well, we was.
Well, you was. You said.
Finish your letter, Walt, or get some more shut-eye.
But the Lieutenant knew about the strata, Dad. How it holds up, like.
And that's why we kept digging.
The fact is Tom Dwyer's dead because
Woodward made a blue - a bad one.
Won't be the last either.
- He's alright, he is.
- Yeah?
Then why'd he join late?
Does anyone want the last of the axle grease?
I was over here, killing Germans, months before his fuckin' number was dry.
Evening.
Stay there.
Surprised to see you here.
Me hearing came back.
Tommy doctor checked me out, couldn't find a bloody thing wrong with me.
Too bad.
- Smoke?
- Yeah, thanks.
It's bad luck.
Bad luck lighting three smokes with one match.
First one, Fritz sniper sees you.
Second one, he gets an aim.
Third one, he blows your fuckin' head off.
Well, he'd be a crack shot if he could get me down here.
Well, you never know who's watchin', do you, sir?
I'll be writing to Tom Dwyer's family.
If he had any possessions to send back, bring them to my dugout.
Officer approaching! Attention!
- Woodward?
- Yes, sir?
I understand you're a demolition man.
I'm trained in mining explosives, sir, not...
You're aware that the Germans have placed a machine gun in the Red House, such that they can enfilade our trench?
En... enfilade?
Fire down it lengthwise.
Oh, yes, sir.
And how much explosive charge would you need to demolish that building?
Depends where you placed it, sir.
How much would you need to do the job properly?
50 pounds.
Do we have that in the stores or do we have to requisition it?
- We have it on hand, sir.
- There's a listening post at 105 Drive.
That'd put you about 70 foot from
Boris.
If we drove north from there, we could be under it in, what?
Oh, three shifts, 30 foot a day - we could do it in two or three days.
Let's have it done before sun-up,
Clayton, you'll have to cut a gap in the wire.
I'll have the artillery give you one hour.
- Sir.
- Sir!
He couldn't get out of here fast enough.
Word is that bastard won't catch a train in case it's going down a tunnel.
It'll mean going over the bags...
...crossing no-man's-land, setting a charge.
I'll need two men.
I'll go, sir.
- You don't have to, Morris.
- Want to, sir.
Sit down, Tiffin.
I'll go.
Here.
A bit out of your element, aren't you, Australia?
I heard you tunnelling chaps were wombats.
Come up for some air, have you?
Actually, we've been invited to blow up the Red House.
Apparently you blokes keep missing.
Set the exploder up over there.
Right. That's us.
They'll start up again at dawn.
You've never been over the bags before, have you?
Christ.
When you get over the top, stay low, don't bunch up.
If a flare goes up, freeze.
Don't bloody go to ground. Fritz machine-gunners look for movement.
Keep one eye closed until the flare drops - then you'll see better when it's dark again.
Thank you.
- Did your boys cut the wire?
- Yeah.
Lieutenant Clayton took a couple of lads out earlier.
He ain't back yet. I'll cover you.
Let's go.
Fuck!
It's Boris, alright.
He hasn't spotted us, but.
The bastard's just trying his luck.
Right. Let's go.
Ready?
We'll have to go under.
There must be a cellar.
Corp!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- What?
- We're short.
Do you think you can get the exploder?
Sir, we could try again tonight.
They'll have found the charge by then. Can you get it?
I think so.
Stay on your bloody stomach and when you get close, give a low whistle to identify yourself.
The Tommies see any movement.
Oh!
Who's the fastest man in our company?
You need a runner?
Yes.
Yeah, Streaky's bloody quick.
Christ.
Is it one of our boys?
There's no way of knowing.
Poor bastard.
Stay here.
Morris will be back any minute now.
Wait.
Wait, sir!
Who are you?
Clayton?
Where did they get you?
Mary, Mary.
You're set now, mate. We're gonna get you home to your Mary.
OK? Everything's OK.
Come on. Come on, Captain.
Come on.
Help.
Field dressing.
- Where is he injured?
- Left leg, above the knee.
Christ.
No! Wait.
- Bastard's got a pattern.
- Thanks, mate.
Captain.
Just pray they haven't broken.
Thank you.
Sir, are you wounded?
I don't think so.
- Hello, Mr Woodward.
- Marjorie.
How is everything at home?
We're coping.
They've formed a mining battalion.
It's a secret, I think.
They're looking for miners and engineers.
I've joined up.
In a few weeks,
I'll be leaving for training, and after that, I expect
I'll be sent off to the war.
I see.
Marjorie, I'm nearly 10 years your senior.
You're only 16.
I'll be 17 in a month.
I signed the papers this morning.
I would like to ask you if I could write to you while I was away.
I would be happy if you wrote to me...
...but if you're asking me to wait for your return, then you must first ask my father.
Thank you for taking the trouble to see me.
Come in close.
If they're going to put on a big push, it'll happen right now.
They're gonna hit us where we're most vulnerable.
Our left flank.
Whatever happens, we need to hold our line, understand?
You convicts gonna play or what?
OK, lads. Kick it off.
Three points all. Next to score wins.
Come on, Australia.
Let's go!
Get right, boys. Go right.
Tiffin, get in there!
Boom, boom, out right!
Go, go, go, go!
- One man down.
- Get up.
OK, mark.
Come on. Turn it up. Get back.
Come on, boys.
Pass it! Pass it! Get out of here!
- Get onside!
- Get in there! Come on! Tackle!
Scrum.
Come here, boys. Come on.
Scrum down. Tiffin in the middle here.
Pack it in, boys. Come in hard.
It's out! It's out!
- Push! Push out!
- Run!
- Where's my runner?
- Get him, boys!
- Come on, Billy!
- Go, Billy!
I'm with you, Billy.
- Billy, go!
- Go, Streaky!
Victory to the 1st Australian Tunnellers, six points to three.
Parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
They'll do it for wine, they'll do it for rum
They'll stick your finger up your bum...
Hinky-dinky, parlez-vous?
Oh, Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
We're the boys from Townsville and Dandenong
We're coming for you with our donkey dongs
Hinky-dinky, parlez-vous?
Oh, Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous?
She's really fat and she's got big ears...
- What's up, Lieutenant?
- It's Captain, actually.
Well done, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Fraser.
Hey, Sarge!
As you were!
We're moving up the line.
We load up at midnight.
How come you bastards get to leave this shithole before us?
Because only real soldiers get to move up the line.
Where we heading, sir?
Belgium.
Hill 60.
Better get your gear.
Righto, you blokes. Let's go.
Keep your heads down, lads.
I nearly forgot - a present from
Fritz.
He said to say,
"Thanks for all your help".
Cheers, mate.
You'll be right, lads.
Thanks, mate.
Too early for the grey hen, sir?
Never too early.
- I'm right.
- Take 'em.
You're just skin and bones.
Come on, son.
She'll send me another parcel tomorrow, more than likely.
Decent fit.
My Elsa's a first-rate knitter.
When we get back, she'll have probably knitted herself a new husband.
Want to be a bit better-looking than the old one.
Your boy's gonna make a great prop forward.
Don't I know it? And he's still growing.
You join up together?
One of them recruiting blokes came through town.
Gets the young fella all excited with his stories of adventure and seeing the Pyramids and what have you.
Never spent one bloody night away from home and he's quit the pits and joined up.
Elsa's nearly had bloody kittens, hasn't she, Walt?
Yep.
Well, you can't unjoin.
So, after Walt went to bed,
I said to Elsa,
"I've looked after him all his life.
I'm not gonna stop now".
I told her if I joined up,
I could bring him back safe.
Elsa didn't know what was worse - her boy going off to the war by himself, or both of us going.
And she's been knitting like buggery ever since.
Douse them flaming lights!
Stay low! Stay low!
Stay here!
- Where's Fosse Way?
- It's north, that way!
He said that way!
Or south to Hill 60?
Fraser! This way!
Let's go!
Keep down!
Come on, boys!
You alright, Walt?
Come on, come on, get up!
Get up! Go!
Where are the others?
Sir!
We left the bloody kids behind.
Who's missing?
Young Sneddon, Tiffin and Bacon.
Walter!
Walt!
Arggh!
How can Fritz get to us?
We're behind the line, ain't we?
He's got the high ground.
Walter!
Over here!
Oh, fuck!
We've missed it.
Sap's over to the right. About 25 yards.
You ready?
Walt, we can't stay here, mate.
Tell you what,
I'll go to the left and draw crabs.
Soon as you hear that MG open up, you run like buggery.
Don't bloody stop until you get to the sap!
No.
I'm twice as fast as you blokes.
Probably make it before youse do.
Come on, Walt!
- Stay low!
- Tiffin!
Walt!
Over here, mate!
Come on.
Streaky's still out there!
Billy!
Billy Bacon!
Streaky!
Did they get home?!
They're home!
- Streaky!
- Streaky!
Run!
- Billy!
- Go on, Billy!
- Billy!
- Come on, Billy!
Come on, Streaky!
- Run, Billy!
- Come on!
Arggh!
Stretcher!
Stretcher bearers!
Streaky?
Oh, this is God's flamin' handiwork, is it?
Grab his disc and pay book.
We'll bury him in the morning.
Come on, Frank.
Gas masks on now!
Captain Woodward.
1st Australian Tunnellers.
- McBride!
- Captain McBride, actually.
Where you been?
Been waiting for hours.
Hell of a place, eh?
Your men can bunk down in there.
Stow your kits.
Get a couple of hours' sleep.
Couple of hours?
Gee, sir. They'll turn soft on you.
Come on!
Have you seen the tunnels?
You've got a big surprise in store for you.
Come on.
Officers' dugout's down this way.
I might just bunk down here for the time being.
Wetter in here than it is out there.
More rats than in frickin'
France.
At least they're Belgian rats.
Change is as good as a holiday.
Keep your gas bags within reach.
At least we're back underground.
And we'll be staying underground.
One way or another.
What's that supposed to mean?
This is how it goes from now on.
We'll be dodging shells and shrapnel and out of the blue, you cop a bullet in the guts like poor old Streaky.
And it's no game of skill down here, neither.
Get eaten by rats, get murdered by Fritz in the dark, or buried alive for our fucking troubles.
Well, that cheered us all up.
Mr Waddell.
Oliver.
When do you set off?
About three weeks.
Right, well... you'd better come in, then.
Actually...
...I'd like to ask you something.
I would like your permission to write to Marjorie while I'm overseas.
And...
...I'd like to spend some time with her before I leave.
- I know.
- Damn it.
Oh.
- Emma.
- What?
I'm gonna take my walk now, if you'd care to come.
Your walk?
Aye.
If you'd care to come?
Oh... of course.
They've never taken a walk together in their lives.
When I get back...
...I'll take you walking every day.
Ja.
Can't see it.
Keep going.
Mate, can I have a bo-peep?
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thanks.
Hey, Pull Through.
Hill 60- take a look.
Is that it?
What were you expecting, Morris?
The fuckin' Matterhorn?
I was expecting something bigger than a railway cuttin'.
So, why 'Berlin Sap'?
It goes so deep under German lines, they reckon it almost reaches Berlin.
It's just mud and slurry.
Like sinking a mine in a bog.
Yeah, the blue clay's further down.
This whole area is below sea level.
Keeping the water out was their main problem.
Was?
Now it's ours.
We're 90 feet down now.
Right below German lines.
Hill 60 is directly above us.
Eh, eh, eh? Shh-shh. Shh.
The blue clay of Flanders.
Beautiful.
Major North, 3rd Canadian Tunnellers.
Fritz has set up in the swim sand.
He can't get at us. Oh, no, no, no.
If you will.
53,000 pounds of ammonal high explosive.
8,000 pounds of guncotton.
I've never seen anything like this before.
No, nobody has. Nobody.
500 feet down there is a caterpillar mine.
That one's 70,000 pounds.
There's 21 of them.
We've undermined the whole of the Messines Ridge, nearly a million pounds of ammonal.
Mm-hm?
You know, when this thing blows, it'll be the biggest explosion the world's ever seen.
Each mine has detonators and leads running to the surface.
Mm-hm.
All we have to do is keep the bloody thing dry and keep it secret from Fritz.
No, no, no. No. Fritz has got no idea.
He thinks we're digging wells.
Well, this'll finish the war.
End it altogether.
Think of that, huh?
When do they plan to detonate?
They're pulling me out.
It's up to you now.
It's all up to you.
Poor bugger.
Yeah, he sleeps down here.
He hasn't been to the surface in three months.
So, when are they gonna blow them?
No-one knows.
- Could be months away.
- What are they waiting for?
Well, I'm a miner not a general...
...but I reckon it's simple arithmetic.
If we blow the mines now, we'll kill a few hundred Fritz at best.
But if they think there's an attack coming, they will stack those trenches above us like bloody sardines.
And kill thousands.
Time it right, tens of thousands.
Nein.
Ja.
Jim, check every prop and every stay, starting here, all the way to the bottom of the Berlin Sap.
- Take Walter and Ginger.
- Sir.
- I'll do the same for Caterpillar.
- Righto.
Pull Through, there are
26 listening posts. Check them all.
- Take Percy.
- Righto.
Fraser, you check the water line.
I want to know the depth from the surface.
I want to know where the water is ending up.
I want to know at exactly what depth the sand becomes clay.
- Take Tiffin with you.
- Sir.
Come on, Tiffin.
- To the left.
- Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep. That's another.
That's good. You got it.
Come out!
Nah. No, you're alright.
Bit bloody close.
Sniper shell, by the size of it.
Would have made a mess of your melon.
Saw one bloke hit by one of them - half his head blown off.
Only his smile left.
How old are you?
When they found out, they made me a stretcher bearer.
Keep me away from the horrors of war.
Stretcher bearers!
Stretcher bearers!
Over here.
Stretcher bearer!
Alright, come on. Let's go.
It's like trying to stop the tide with a bloody sandcastle.
Top level's mostly sand.
Clay starts around 30 feet.
Water seeps down, pools above the clay.
Where it finds a tunnel, it funnels down like a bloody creek.
We have 60 blokes manning the pumps night and day just to keep the water level down.
If we lose even a few of those men, bloody mines'll be useless.
Where did they get this lot?
The sappers are getting it wherever they can find it now, sir.
All the forests have been cut down or stonkered by shellin'.
That's oak.
Me dad's a carpenter.
After the war, I'm gonna get me apprenticeship.
Get out of them bloody pits.
More 'an likely, it came from that ruined church in town.
Church?
Cathedral. Ypres Cathedral.
Probably.
- That's the lowest point in the sap.
- 90 feet, yeah.
What if we sink a shaft directly to that point and get the water out that way?
Canadians have tried it.
So have the Tommies.
The whole middle section is unstable.
Shaft walls collapse after about six feet.
Besides, 90 feet vertical is a bloody long way to move water.
We've got electricity down there, don't we?
We propose sinking a shaft down to a gallery beneath the Berlin Sap, right here.
- Install electric pumps.
- Should free up 60 men at least.
Rutledge?
This is over 90 feet deep.
I shouldn't have thought an electric pump would lift water that high...
The new ones will, sir.
And this shaft simply isn't feasible.
This is not a new idea, sir.
It's impossible to go through the wet sand without the walls collapsing.
Have you been down there, Colonel?
Alright. That will be all.
Thank you, sir, and I apologise for taking up your valuable time.
General, our plans differ from the ones previously tried.
- How?
- We don't dig from the surface, sir.
We build the shaft head
20 feet below ground level.
We construct galleries large enough to house all the tunnellers and hide the blue clay.
Captain Woodward, 20 feet down will put you right in the middle of the quicksand.
You are wrong, Colonel!
It would set us just above the wet sand. That's the point.
We'll use steel sections to control the water and stop the walls collapsing.
We use jacks from the roof of the gallery to force the steel sections downwards.
And how many months or years do we imagine that this folly will take?
- Rough estimate?
- How long?
Three weeks, give or take.
Go, go, go!
Go! Keep going.
Aarggh!
Run! Run, boys, keep going.
Come on!
Aarggh!
One more.
Yep.
Shh. Shh.
We're nearly there.
Bucket it out. Get those jacks back up.
Have that steel section ready to go on my order.
Drive it further into the clay.
It's going, sir.
Not exactly gushing.
What's happening, Tiffin?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to be working.
No idea. It's working at that end.
Ridiculous.
Must be too much pressure.
I'm sure we...
Full report by the morning.
Yes!
- What if the pump fails?
- We have backups standing by, sir.
Off the shaft head, we've built two listening posts and two diversion tunnels.
- What diversion tunnels?
- I'll show you, sir.
There's no need.
- It's no trouble.
- There is no need.
There's more activity in the second diversion, sir.
I think Fritz is coming at us again.
That means it's working.
He's been quiet for four minutes.
I reckon he could be ready to blow.
Let them.
Is it just the two of you down there?
- Just me, sir.
- Where's Walt?
He's up getting me a billy of tea.
What? He abandoned his post?
- No, he just...
- Put it on the report.
Why aren't you at your post?
- As I said, I think Fritz...
- Have you been ordered out?
Sir, the listeners have permission...
I know the orders, Captain!
Get back down there.
If you see Walt, you tell him... you tell him not to...
Sir...
My dad likes a cup of tea around now.
Jim.
Jim!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Jim!
Dad!
Daddy, can you hear me? Dad!
Restore, establish and strengthen you forever and ever, amen.
Amen.
Sir?
I've been wanting to give you this...
...for that girl of yours, sir.
I made it from that wood you liked...
...from the cathedral.
It's beautiful.
This box was made from the timbers of Ypres Cathedral by a nice young chap named Frank
Tiffin.
I'm sure you'll get to meet him after this is over and thank him for his handiwork.
- What is it?
- Not sure.
15 degrees, about 20ft forward,
15ft down.
Nothing.
An attack tunnel?
No, it's different.
- I think it's some kind of shaft.
- Through the wet sand?
No. Can't be.
Come on!
Come on!
Du, nach oben.
Woodward? Woodward?
Woodward!
Captain Woodward, get up!
We're firing the mines Thursday morning, just before dawn.
That's in 36 hours.
You'll be firing the Hill 60 and caterpillar mines.
McBride, you'll have the back-up exploders.
Sir.
There'll be 21 blasts in all.
Yours will be the final two in the sequence.
It's critical to the entire operation that each mine goes off precisely in the right order.
Yes, sir.
Firing orders.
Attention.
You were on listening duty?
All quiet, sir, apart from a few squeaks.
- Rats?
- Probably.
Probably rats mating, sir, by the sound of them.
Why do you say that?
They were kind of regular squeaks, if you get my drift.
Where?
Lower listening post, Berlin Sap.
Windlass.
It's a shaft.
Right here.
That's right on top of the mine at Hill 60.
We've been counting the squeaks for 15 minutes now.
- I've calculated the depth...
- Yes.
63 feet, sir.
We blow in 10 hours.
When do you predict they'd hit the mine?
At their current rate of progress, nine hours, sir.
I hold you personally responsible.
Do what you have to do, Woodward.
- We're driving an attack tunnel.
- From where, sir?
Lower Berlin Sap listening post to position 6-0.
- That's just above the mine.
- Yes.
That's suicidal.
That's an order, Sergeant.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!
They're 10 feet forward, 15 feet up.
Morris.
Resistance is good.
Check it again.
Were the leads reconnected after the last test?
Mm-hm.
29 minutes.
I'm going back down.
Clear, please.
Out of the way!
Some tea coming.
On three.
One...
...two...
...three.
They're almost on top of us.
I've gotta set the charge.
No. That'll set off the main mine.
Wait till they're a few feet away.
Then use the camouflet.
A few feet?
Another four feet forward.
There's no time.
Four feet forward, Fraser.
Then set the charge.
Set the charge.
Finish the backing, boys.
They did it.
Guess what, Mutter?
I'm coming home.
Voomp!
Splat!
Go easy, boys.
Load up. Let's get out of here.
Nein, nein! Schnell! Schnell!
Fritz will be landing in Berlin right about now.
- All clear below?
- Yes, sir.
The German shaft has been crumped.
All circuits are complete.
Five minutes!
Five minutes!
Five minutes! Five minutes!
Five minutes!
This is our great occasion.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Four minutes to go.
- Did it easy.
- Yeah.
Man buried!
- Who is it?
- It's Tiffin! He's back there!
Fuck.
Go! Go!
Tiffin!
Tiffin!
Sarge?
It's gonna take some time to shift this.
I'll get them to hold the mine.
Well, what do we do?
Tiffin!
Just go.
No point in all of us dying.
Fraser will get them to stop!
We'll come back when we know!
Righto!
'Bye, Tiffin!
Come on, Walt! Come on!
Cheerio, lads.
One minute!
Out of the way, please! Move!
Fuckin' move!
Fix bayonets!
Out of the way! Move!
Out of the way! Make way!
Out of the fuckin' way!
20 seconds!
Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!
- Out of the fuckin' way!
- 15 seconds!
Tiffin's still in there.
- What happened?
- Collapse.
Sir, please.
10 seconds!
- He's still alive.
- Nine!
Eight!
We'd have him out in a few minutes.
Seven!
Six!
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Woodward!
- Two!
For Christ's sake! It's
Tiffin!
Fire!
That's your heart.
Feel it?
You're hearing your own heartbeat.
Woodward.
People are waiting.
Woody, are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'll be out shortly.
You right?
This film is based
on an actual event.
On August 15th, 1945,
Korea gets liberated.
The South gets under U.S.
And the North
under Soviet influences.
June 25th, 1950,
the North Korean Peoples Army
makes a surprise attack
on the South.
The North occupies
Seoul in 3 days
and the rest in 40 days,
except for the area
south of Nakdong River.
Far outnumbered,
many students joined
the South Korean army
as volunteer soldiers.
INTO THE FIRE
Young-deok, August 8th, 1950
Executive Producer JEONG Tae-won
Hey!
You!
Take this to the 3rd platoon!
Sir?
Gae-sung Store rooftop!
- Get me more ammo!
- Yes, sir!
Capt. KANG?
Capt. KANG.
How's the situation there?
Directed by LEE Jae-han
Requesting back up, now!
Fire!
Charge!
This is the 3rd platoon!
- How much left?
- That's it, sir.
This is the 3rd platoon!
Captain!
- Where are our backups?
- They ordered a retreat.
Retreat, now!
That's an order!
If you don't, you'll all die!
Listen to me, KANG!
We can beat them,
Commander!
- Lieutenant KIM!
- Yes, sir!
- Backup the 3rd platoon.
- Yes, sir!
Fight 'em off no matter what!
Yes, sir!
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- KIM Jun-seop!
- Sir?
Careful out there.
In coming on the left!
Medics! Over here!
Hurry!
OH Jang-beom!
OH Jang-beom!
Back to 4th defense line!
More ammo, sir!
Load it up!
Take cover!
The machine guns are down!
Take it. Stay behind me!
Jang-beom! Stay back!
More enemies are coming!
2nd platoon!
Sit tight!
Commander!
We've lost contact, sir!
- Try it again!
- Yes, sir!
Capt. LEE Myung-guk, sir!
Still couldn't break through?
The remnants are starting to run away.
We'll seize the place, soon!
Unit 766 will finish fighting and head to Pohang, now!
Liberate our country!
Unify our country!
Kill every one of 'em!
Charge!
Commander!
Send us reinforcements, sir!
We'll get all the damn commies!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Let's go!
Take 'em down, now!
Picture taken, sir.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
Commander?
Our political leader ordered to go to battle at Nakdong River at once.
Look Commissar LEE An-nam.
Why should I go there?
I'm going straight to Pohang.
But it's the party's order!
What do those scribbling at their desks know about war?
Are you saying you will go against an order?
Comrade.
Who is above the party?
Who is at the top of the party?
Our Great Supreme Commander.
On the day
I left Pyung-yang...
Our Great Supreme Commander...
Ordered me to seize Busan before August 15th!
- Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir!
Our 766 unit will march straight for Pohang.
Stop hesitating!
Blow it up, now!
If we cut off the bridge,
the refugees will be stranded!
What will happen to them, sir?
That's an order,
KANG Seok-dae!
Here.
We'll take care of you.
Don't worry.
- Nurse!
- Coming!
Hold on.
The medication's coming.
More injured soldiers came!
Hurry!
We'll give you morphine.
KIM Jun-seop
Remove the body.
This way, please!
He's dead.
Can you hear me?
Or can't you?
Looks like your eardrums are ruptured.
Does it hurt?
What's your name?
Do you know when you got hurt?
Don't wanna talk to me?
What happened to KIM Jun-seop?
Killed in action, sir.
That fool.
Where are our backup troops?
Why'd you stop our backup fire?
Capt. KANG.
Our 3rd division did nothing but retreat the last 40 days.
We're sick of retreating!
When are the allied forces coming?
Where do we run away to now?
All the way to Busan?
Then what?
Jump into the sea?
Enough! KANG!
Stop.
I know.
Watching your men die...
It breaks your heart.
I didn't have any troops to send you.
And the artillery units had to go and save the 4th division at Wonpori.
Our 3rd division will go to battle at Nakdong River immediately.
The North's 5th,
12th, and 15th divisions are swarming to Nakdong.
We've been ordered to annihilate them.
Nakdong River will be a pool of blood.
Cuz we have nowhere else to retreat.
It's our last line of defense.
Then which unit will protect Pohang here?
All attention!
All student soldiers in here!
Hurry up, people!
- Get going!
- Go!
When KIM Jun-seop died...
Were you the one with him?
Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
What's your name, son?
OH Jang-beom, sir.
Catch!
Good day, sir.
- What is it?
- Just wondering.
Them boys over there...
Are bound forjuvenile reformatory on murder charges.
But they want to become student soldiers instead...
And fight against the damn commies.
Will you take fools like them?
I'm sure they'll be good at fighting and stuff.
Especially this one, here.
He looks a little old.
- Sure he's a student?
- You're a student, right?
The other students are gathered over there.
Run over!
Don't worry, sir.
Run you fools!
His parents got shot dead by commies.
He's itching to get his hands on the commies.
Sign here, please.
68 new, plus 3 existing student soldiers all 71 here, sir!
The existing 3 step forward.
Give the new studen soldiers a rifle
And 250 bullets each.
Now, sir?
Come up, one at a time!
Next!
Back to positions after getting your weapons!
Move it!
Whoa!
Awesome!
Men!
You will now be formed into one unit.
You will be divided into two platoons.
Your captain will be...
OH Jang-beom here.
Excuse me, sir?
What is it?
Why's he the captain, sir?
Any objections?
Can't we vote to choose the leader?
Yeah!
Let's do it democratically!
How about who eats the most?
I'm pretty good at that, myself!
Quiet!
You think this is a picnic!
The captain must have combat experience.
OH Jang-beom's your captain.
From now on, you will defend this place.
Our 3rd division command will all go to battle at Nakdong River.
You mean...
We have to protect this place?
Just us, sir?
That's right.
Does Pohang need to be protected?
Pohang is a strategic point.
Then why are the soldiers leaving?
Pohang is important...
But if we loose the battlefront at Nakdong...
We're all dead.
Information tells us now...
It's safer here compared to Nakdong River.
How long do we have to stand guard?
The allied forces will arrive in Busan soon.
Just till then.
Don't go, sir.
Can't you stay?
It's an order from above.
A soldier moves according to orders.
Sir?
What if...
The commies attack?
What then?
Then we kill 'em all!
Fool. We don't know how to shoot!
Shit. Then we learn.
Can't run away, right?
We fight 'em, right?
Student soldiers...
Are you soldiers or not?
This is your country.
I trust you will defend it.
Here.
Remember.
Put it up higher than the arm.
Don't forget.
First you press power then set the frequency.
Then you turn the volume up to hear.
What's this again?
The frequency, sir.
No, it's the power!
We have no time.
You bury those killed in action.
Ah, Captain?
What?
You can do it.
If anything happens, call me.
I can't be the captain here.
I was never the leader type.
Lead them with heart.
If your sincerity gets through, they will all follow you.
It'll take our engineer units two days to come to build a temporary bridge.
Then 18 hours to build it
So three days in total.
We don't have enough rubber boats to make a pontoon bridge, either.
Going around that mountain will take a day and a half.
But the enemy could be waiting in ambush.
Commander?
Why don't we go to Nakdong as the party ordered?
This is why theorists like you are no use in the battlefield.
Think about it.
When they're rest assured,
We should strike
'em from behind.
Then any ideas on how to cross the river?
The shock troops will swim across the river minimally armed.
Yes, sir.
We'll swim across!
The tank unit goes around the mountain.
Swim across, now!
766 shock troops!
- Swim!
- Yes, sir!
Swim across, now!
South Korean comrades.
Can't wait to see your damn mugs.
They're chocolates!
Move!
Get your hands off!
Scram!
Just one chocolate bar?
Please?
Now.
Student soldiers!
Student soldiers!
You will be divided into 2 platoons
- and work on...
- What's he yappin'?
Speak louder. Can't hear ya.
The 1st platoon will bury the dead soldiers.
Did ya eat?
If you didn't, go stuff yourself.
You three weak musketeers.
You boys.
Ever stab someone?
Ever kill a damn commie?
I ain't burying corpses.
Why should we do it?
We came to kill commies not bury corpses!
- Right?
- Right!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, he's right.
But still, listen to the leader.
They're Capt. KANG's orders.
Orders?
What if we go against them?
You'll get shot dead.
By who?
You?
Shoot me?
What you looking at?
Move.
Take him. Hurry!
One, two, three!
Shoot one bullet...
- Good luck.
- Like it's your 100th shot.
I shot eight shots before going to battle,
But you getjust one.
So what do we do?
Shoot one like it's 100.
Again!
Shoot one like it's a 100!
Line up!
Firing squad up front!
You son of a bitch!
Watch carefully.
See that?
If you mess up, you'll lose your thumb.
Get down and shoot!
Breechblocks pulled back!
Fire!
Why's he shooting so much?
We're supposed to shoot once.
Whoa! See that?
Hey, Gap-jo?
This won't last two weeks for all the mouths here.
If he doesn't eat, it can last a month.
This stuff's just snack food for me.
Hey, Gap-jo.
What?
Wanna bring out the three weak musketeers and scare 'em?
Show 'em who we are?
Who are we?
We're orphans!
You bastards!
We're gangsters!
You bastards!
Gap-jo can't even read!
You bastards.
Shut up, bastard.
But that hat looks the best on you, Gap-jo.
Damn right.
Whoa! Cool!
Gap-jo?
Is this a grenade?
Give me that.
- A grenade?
- That's right, fool.
If this blows,
It can wipe out the black market.
- The whole thing will blow?
- Yup.
We can wipe out the damn
Lily gang with this.
They'll vanish without a trace.
Stay back!
Hey!
- Stay back!
- Stop it!
- Don't move!
- Stop it, fool!
Stay back!
Son of a bitch!
What's this?
You stupid!
Lt'll blow, fool!
Throw it, fool!
Throw it!
Jump!
Arms up straight, fool!
What do we do?
There are only three sacs of potatoes and two sacs of corn left.
Don't worry.
We'll go find the food!
Wang-pyo, get up!
Poong-chun, let's go!
Stop right there!
Stay out of it.
Why?
It's an order.
An order?
Enough with the damn orders!
How are we going to fight against the North with them?
But they're trusting us to lead them.
So we gotta keep calm and handle things well.
Mother...
I miss you so much.
The soldiers guarding Pohang...
Left for Nakdong River today.
There are only 71
of us left here.
Mother...
I can hear fellow students
laughing in the next room.
I don't remember the last time
I heard laughter around here.
I hope their laughter
will not vanish away.
Hey!
Can't ya dance better than that?
Poong-chun!
Let's show 'em!
Go for it.
In front of damn kiddies...
Charleston swing!
Bastards.
Gap-jo! Hey, Gap-jo!
It's 10 o'clock.
Go to bed.
It was just getting fun.
- 1st platoon! Let's go!
- This ain't a picnic!
We're at war!
Get up, now!
- See ya.
- Sleep tight.
Ain't that heavy?
No, not at all.
But why's it so long?
It's American.
They made it for their size.
But it'll shoot really far.
Should I try it?
Go ahead!
Then all the others will come out!
- Hey, bro?
- What?
I miss Kimchi soup mama used to make.
Her homemade Kimchi with anchovy broth.
So delicious.
See, I told you not to follow me out here.
Are they our troops or the enemy?
If they're the enemy, nobody shoots till I say so!
We shoot if you shoot?
Yeah, tell everyone that.
Got it.
Hey, bro?
I gotta pee.
Hold it in.
Did you undo the stabilizer?
Get down!
Get down, now!
Nice cool breeze.
Not a damn mouse in sight.
Yeah.
Where are the enemy soldiers?
Damn monsters.
What if we win without even getting to shoot?
Wish I could fire away.
This place reminds me of home.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Shouldn't we go and check?
Stop trembling, man!
We're supposed to check.
Mama...
Mama...
Mama...
Hurry up and kill him!
What? Want me to do it?
Mother, I killed
a North Korean soldier today.
I thought the enemy soldiers
were monsters with horns.
But they cried out for
Their mothers just like us.
Mother...
Why must we be at war?
I have to get all
the mixed emotions
Off my chest, Mother.
Corns? Come quick!
- Give me one.
- Eat half a corn.
Scram!
We should go out there.
Get ready.
But the commies are lurking out there.
What about the school?
Leave some to guard it.
Captain?
Can we use this?
Not sure.
Let's take it and see.
Look at that damn stomach!
Damn lard!
Hey.
Put that out.
Even my dad can't tell me what to do.
Stop yappin'.
I'm second in command here!
You wanna die?
Why you!
Son of a bitch!
That's American!
In the forest...
Cigarette smell can go as far as 4 km.
What a wimp.
Get down!
Dar-young!
Where ya going?
Yong-man!
Get down!
Wang-pyo! Get down!
Wang-pyo!
Wang-pyo!
Wang-pyo!
Wang-pyo!
Wang-pyo!
Damn commies!
I'll kill 'em all!
Gap-jo!
Gap-jo! Watch out!
Follow 'em!
Fire!
Get down!
Poong-chon! That way!
Wait here!
Come up! Hurry!
Put the gun down!
Now!
Hell no!
I'm a soldier of North Korea...
Led by General KIM ll-sung!
- Don't shoot! That's an order!
- I'll die if I have to!
But will never surrender!
Don't shoot!
To liberate South Korea from under the Americans!
We'll stand victorious!
Don't shoot!
Shoot!
Go ahead, fool!
He's a commie!
Before the war, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in Europe.
Muslims, Serbs and Croats lived together in harmony.
Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992.
Go get ready.
Get out of here.
Come to Mommy.
Go, go, go, go!
Okay.
It's too much!
You look gorgeous!
Great! Come here.
What are you doing?
Just this. A bit like this.
Oh, come on!
Okay, show me "sexy." What?
What time is it?
And this.
Don't forget this.
Thanks for helping me with him.
That's what I came back here for.
I'm so excited for you.
Do you remember how to get there?
No, no. Keep it.
Bye.
Have fun.
I love you.
You are worth the wait.
Stop.
I have something for you.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
And this song is for lovers.
Have them make more space outside.
Secure the area.
We need more blood. Okay?
Everything will be all right.
Everything will be all right.
IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY
Four Months Later.
Ajla. Wake up.
Is that Azra?
I can't see.
Where are they taking the men?
Where's your passport?
I don't know.
Where's your passport?
I don't know!
Open the door!
Get your coats and get out.
Cut!
Let's go!
All the men, up!
Go.
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go!
Come on, come on!
Come. To the bus.
Let's go, let's go.
To the bus.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on.
To the bus.
Where are you taking her?
Don't, don't.
Hey, let's go.
Don't, don't.
Let's go!
Hurry UP! Hurry UP! Hurry UP!
Hurry up, grandma.
Hey!
Tell me.
Do you know how a shepherd counts sheep?
No. How?
One, two, three, mwah, five, six.
Left!
Give me your purse.
Give me that coat.
Which of you can cook?
Not a shit cook, a real cook.
I'm a doctor.
I can sew.
Anything you need.
Coats. Curtains. I can make something for the beds. I can...
Can you fuck?
No!
No!
SFR JUGOSLAVIA
What is all this now, eh?
Is everybody having fun?
Let me do this one.
Are you hiding something from me?
This one's done.
Hurry up! All this is taking too long.
Are you okay?
I'm in constant fear that they will come for us.
Everything's going to be all right.
You'll see.
They cut our electricity.
They cut our water.
How can you say everything will be all right?
I don't even know if my sister is alive.
I know.
What am I going to do with him?
I have to get out of here.
I have to run away with him.
Maybe on a humanitarian aid convoy.
They're attacking humanitarian aid convoys as well.
We have to stay calm.
Why don't you get some sleep and let me play with the little one.
You think we are too harsh?
I understand you.
You are young.
You don't care about the past.
We Serbs fought the Turks for 500 years and stopped them from conquering Europe.
In 1914, we stood against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and we brought it down.
We kicked Hitler's ass, and we won.
One million Serbs were killed in World War II.
This land is soaked with Serbian blood.
And now they want us to live here under Muslim rule?
In a Muslim state?
I recognize people.
Sometimes I get into a house and I recognize their faces.
They're just pretending to be good neighbors, Danijel.
Under Tito, they hid their treacherous faces, waiting for the opportunity to destroy Yugoslavia and attack us.
I am a Serb patriot.
You don't have to question that.
Are you?
Then why are you questioning our methods?
You think the rest of the world will ignore all this? I don't.
The UN has already sent peacekeepers to Croatia.
They will not turn their backs on all of this.
Of course they see everything, but they will not attack us.
They won't do anything.
And they know we are the right partners for negotiations.
They need us.
They will not attack.
Bolster your men.
And finish cleansing this area.
You don't want your men to doubt you.
And you, Father?
I had my doubts.
I have to go now.
Do strong work, Danijel.
Make me a proud father.
No. No!
Not again, you swine! No!
Oh, please!
No! Please! No!
Enter.
Why did you sit there?
Stand up.
Ajla.
Remember how things were when it was just you and me in the club, before this madness.
Remember.
I couldn't find you anywhere.
People are often not what they seem to be.
Do you want to know my secret?
I'm trying to have a conversation with you here.
Do you want to know my secret, Ajla?
Yes.
I don't like taking part in this war.
To kill people I've gone to school with.
I find this war very difficult to stomach.
But my father,
Nebojsa Vukojevich,
General Vukojevich, thinks differently.
I told my men that they are not allowed to touch you, that you are my property.
Go.
Come on, get out!
People who leave their homes are at risk of being shot.
Red Cross and
UN relief convoys,
even women and children looking for food,
are being targeted.
The images of this attack galvanized international opinion against the Serbs.
But Western governments don't want to intervene in the conflict.
The American Secretary of State says,
"We don't have a dog in that fight."
Across Bosnia, nearly 6,000 people have been killed to date.
More coffee over here.
A million have been forced from their homes,
creating Europe's biggest refugee crisis in close to 50 years.
The causes of conflict lie in the breakup,
after 40 years of Communist rule,
of old Yugoslavia.
Come in, Ajla.
Don't be afraid.
Would you like a drink?
No, sir.
"Sir"?
Danijel.
I had a clear shot today.
One of your Muslim friends was in my scope.
And I'm thinking about you, wondering,
"Would she thank me if I spared this poor man's life?."
And then it hit me,
"How can people kill so easily?."
And then I wondered,
"Would she kill me if she could?."
"Would Ajla kill Danijel?."
Did you kill him?
I didn't.
Ls everything okay with you?
Everything is fine.
Hey!
We got a report from headquarters.
The front line is stable.
Muslims are running all over the place.
You have to be more careful of who you shoot at.
UNPROFOR is increasing their presence.
They can see everything now.
The whole world is watching.
So now what?
Radovan and politicians will be kissing international TV's ass?
They will try to make it look like nothing's happening. Why?
The UN and UNPROFOR are doing nothing.
They're just standing on the other side.
We won already.
I'm just telling you people, watch yourselves.
Enter.
Good evening, Ajla.
Thank you for dinner.
For cleaning up after me.
It's nothing.
It's not nothing.
You have a beautiful smile.
Thank you.
I never asked you, who were you before the war?
What did you do?
I wanted to be a painter.
I was a painter, I suppose.
I have a painting hanging at the
Sarajevo Municipal Gallery.
In the Gallery?
Really?
Mmm.
But that doesn't really matter now, does it?
And what did you paint?
People or, what do you call it,
Still life?
People.
Usually my sister.
And did you always want to be a policeman?
Some of us don't have a choice.
This was always my family tradition.
Captain?
Did you find it?
Yes. Yes, that's the one.
Copy it.
Watch and learn.
Yes, sir.
Watch where you're going.
Come on, clean it up.
Keep practicing.
That's it, that's it.
I'm going.
Tomorrow, after lunch, I'll go to the back of the building.
In the bathroom, above the radiator, there is a window.
Crawl through it.
I'll wait for you on the other side.
I will not stop you.
Tomorrow?
Get out of the city as soon as you can.
Find a shelter.
And do not come out.
If you have to, do it at night.
We can't see that well at night and, by then, my soldiers are drunk.
This will not end soon.
Things will only get worse.
You should know.
Are we so terrible that we all should be exterminated?
You're not.
I'm sorry.
It's all...
It's politics, not murder.
All of this is complicated.
The politics of all this are very complicated.
It is murder, for political gain.
But still murder.
All the more reason for you to leave tomorrow.
The sooner the better.
I can't protect you forever.
No matter how much I'd want to.
Get some coffee.
Thank you, captain.
I pray I never see my husband again, so he doesn't find out what they've done to me.
I want to die.
Try to get some rest.
Got ya.
Careful!
Here's the backpack.
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sick of doing nothing, and everybody's out of medication.
Bye. See you later.
Don't worry.
Get out! Come on!
Get the fuck out, everyone! Hurry up!
Keep going!
Get out! Come on!
Sign it!
Come on, come on!
- Step out!
- My child is still in the apartment.
Come on, come on!
Take your things and sign these papers.
We are returning tomorrow to evacuate you.
Thank you.
Will this be temporary, or will you have ownership indefinitely?
I won't sign it.
I have nowhere to go.
I have lived here for 30 year...
Sign it.
Get out! Come on!
Get out, everyone!
Would you like me to pour it for you, sir?
Yes.
Listen to me, Ajla.
I have been transferred to Sarajevo.
I have to leave immediately.
I want to remind you of that window.
The best time to escape is one hour after dinner.
By then, everyone is drunk.
Now finish with my coffee, and go.
She did everything she could.
She couldn't keep him quiet.
She did everything she could.
Oh, please forgive me.
Where is my son?
Headquarters - Sarajevo.
Hello.
Welcome.
Happy to see you.
Very good.
Two klicks to the left.
Let's go home, kids!
My girls are done!
Go home and get some rest.
What's up?
Are you still alive, motherfuckers?
Any news?
This is from Santa Claus.
There's nothing new.
Look!
There's nothing new!
Hey, dicks!
Come on, fucking pussies!
That's enough.
Don't fuck around.
Look at that.
Darko.
Where did you go?
My wife is pregnant.
Three months.
Congratulations, my brother.
That's the best news in days.
Captain, we're gonna finish this war before the little man is born, huh?
It's a little boy?
It has to be.
I would love a little girl too much.
She would drive me crazy.
She would make my head spin.
A little girl.
We are doing this for them, huh?
So they don't have to go to war, when they grow up.
Yes. It's for them.

Hey. I know this place.
I came here with my mother once.
Fuck your mother.
Watch your language, or I'll fuck you up.

What's wrong with you?
It was a joke.
Save your jokes for someone else What's wrong with you?
Fuck off.
Suck my dick.

Fuck you, too.

I've never been to a museum.
Look at all these faces here.
Hey, I found this one.
Take it over there.
Throw the sandbag over here.
Bring it here.
I'll help you.
Who's been hit?
It's all right.
Hey, you all right, old man?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
It's okay, it's okay.
You're alive.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Can you hear me?
You'll be fine.

...Bosnia and Herzegovina
today issued in half of towns...

...being pounded by Serb forces.
The Bosnians say
UN arms embargo...
Come in.
...favors the Serb's side because it already has all the weapon it needs.
A government spokesperson says
Bosnian patriots are fighting
to defend their territory,
but find themselves surrounded and outgunned.
Still, they fight on.
Hey, it's all right.
It's me. Hana.
Esma.
Esma...
You, in the back.
You, you.
You.
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, get out of the truck!
Come out with your hands in the air and surrender!
It's over!
You don't want to kill your own people!
It's over!
It's over!
Come out!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Come on, come on!
Get up! Get your things!
Come on!
I can't any more.
I just can't.
You know that little window in the bathroom?
I know.
When they drink after dinner, the guard is usually a little late.
I think there is a good chance the men will be distracted tonight.
And why are you telling me this?
Because if I succeed tonight, you should know how.
Get up! Come on.
Come, come.
Look at them.
Mitar.
Mitar!
Stay behind.
I'll handle it.
And don't drink too much.
I need you sober tomorrow.
Okay, let's go.
Give it to me.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
What's your name?
Ajla.
What?
Ajla.
Tarik.
Are you okay?
She's alive?
Yeah.
You know where she is?
Yeah, I do.
She's not far, about two hours away.
Hey, slow down.
I can't, I'm too excited.
Slow down or they'll see us and kill us. Slow down.
It's down here.
Watch your head.
You know, when my mom used to sew, she wouldn't stop for two days.
Lejla.
Come here.
Where is Adi?
They killed Adi.
They didn't.
They didn't. They didn't.
They didn't.
Dinner! Dinner!
Real food.
Let's see what we got.
It's good, it's good.
Here.
Oh, look at it.
Meatballs.
Anyone have peanut butter?
Here it is.
I brought it for you.
Here, here.
Look what we got.
Black pepper.
I would kill a man for small glass of juice.
Yeah. Hey, hey.
Cevapi.
Or sopska salad.
And cola.
Who misses cola?
Steak. Big steak.
Medium rare.
It can be rare.
Or burnt.
Or whatever, just a steak.
Do you know when the plane with aid arrived?
Early this morning.
And do you know where it was from?
Italy.
Forty minutes away.
No, less.
Peace. Shopping. Dancing.
Yes.
Some tourists sitting in the sun, worrying about getting an even tan.
Everything as it used to be.
You know, it left empty.
It just stopped to drop off supplies and it left empty.
They took no one.
Not even children?
No.
Lejla, I saw your painting today in Danijel Vukojevich's office.
My picture?
Yeah.
What is my picture doing in
Danijel Vukojevich's office?
Trust me.
I was peering in with the binoculars and thought you were standing in the room.
They're all disgusting.
Come on, hold on.
They're not all the same.
What do you mean?
I can't hate all Serbs.
My mother is a Serb.
Well, I didn't mean Serbs.
I meant Chetnik Serbs.
There is a difference.
We have to do something.
Think again.
Anyone have any ideas?
If we get you inside, you can help.
Guys, we're surrounded.
Please be careful.
It's up to us to do it.
No one will help us.
They have surrounded us.
We have to do something.
We need some information.
I don't know.
Will you help us?
I can try.
We have to figure out how to...
Are you sure?
Of course I want to help.
How will you contact us?
Think about it.
- Where should I be?
- At the water point.
We need...
Please watch yourself.
Be smart.
Ajla, don't worry.
Be careful.
I'm always careful.
Be cautious.
Yes, I Will.
Come on, Bosnian.
Tell me a joke.
No, I don't know any.
Yes, you do.
They caught him in the convoy.
He said he's got information on hideouts and sniper points.
You're a good guy.
Let me talk to him.
First and last name.
Tarik Paho.
What is your occupation?
What was your occupation before the war?
I was an assistant baker.
Erlagich.
You had the best rolls in town.
Sir.
I can be of great help to you.
I worked as a spy for them.
And now you're gonna spy for us?
I know where they moved the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
If you give me a map,
I will show you.
Okay. Might as well try.
He's not going anywhere.
That's a nice painting.
Looks like a friend of mine.
And I know her sister.
She's the one who painted it.
Okay.
Show me.
Here.
Here, they have been deployed.
Aco, bring me that painter.
I want to have my portrait done.
Why are you fucking with us?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Where is she?
I don't know.
That's her.
Right there.
I was so happy to see you alive.
Last time I saw you,
I couldn't get you to leave.
Was I wrong to assume you wanted to be with me?
No.
Don't be afraid of me.
Good morning, Ajla.
And what do your men think of you bringing a Muslim breakfast?
You worry about me.
Am I your prisoner?
You're a prisoner only if you don't want to be here.
You are my official painter now.
Am I?
Yes, you are.
Then I have nothing to fear.
A pear.
Probably the last pear in all of Bosnia.
Enjoy it.
The room at the far end.
Do you know where to go?
Yes, sir.
Don't.
You look like a pirate.
Winter 1994.
Just yesterday these Muslims killed 47 people. Civilians.
Those motherfuckers will pay for this.
I swear.
This is going to be the last winter of the war.
We now control more than
80% of the territory.
By springtime, we will finish our work, and there will be peace in Bosnia.
Danijel is a good boy.
He grew up into a real man.
Strong.
His men love him.
Just...
He's been keeping a girl for too long.
A Muslim girl.
I don't know, maybe it's not true.
People like to talk...
They say he doesn't let anyone near her.
I'll gather the men.
Wine.
Is it your birthday?
No.
Is it yours?
No.
When is your birthday?
End of November.
Yours?
May 11th.
I missed it, then.
We now control more than
80% of the territory.
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about that.
I'm sorry.
You were at the camp today.
How do you know?
I heard your men talking in the courtyard.
What is it like there?
Is it the way I imagine it?
It's worse.
Camps are the worst part of war.
Nobody can deny that.
Why aren't you eating?
Come on, eat.
Look how skinny you are.
What's wrong?
What is going on, Ajla?
Sometimes I feel so much guilt for being here with you.
Come on. It really doesn't matter.
It would make no difference if you were out there with them.
But I don't have to sleep with their murderer.
You think your people don't kill, huh?
You think you're better?
Innocent?
You know nothing about my war.
Nothing.
Just so you know, you started the war.
And I'm the monster now?
I didn't mean it.
Then what did you mean?
You are afraid of me now.
Let's dance.
Excuse me?
Let's dance.
You're crazy.
Am I?
You're there lying alone and I'm here dancing.
Who's the crazy one, then?
Get dressed.
Did you paint this?
Yes.
Paint my portrait.
Name?
Ajla.
Surname?
Ekmecic.
Age?
Are you married?
No.
You have gentle hands.
Lady's hands.
My mother's hands were rough and cracked.
Always black from the earth she had to work, so that Muslim ladies could wear silk dresses.
She had to feed seven children.
She was in the field that morning when they came.
August '44.
With her three older sons, and my sister, Milica, four years old.
I was the youngest.
My grandmother had taken me and two of my brothers to the side of the mountain to look after the cows.
Thirteenth Handzar Division, full of Turks and Ustashas, was passing by.
They found a woman with children in the field, and they killed them all.
They slaughtered them.
And left them to rot.
Half of my village was killed that day.
Your hands are white.
My grandfather was a Partisan.
I was raised to know no difference between Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
Yeah.
Some of you were.
Clear your desk.
You and your driving.
Cold, huh?
Mmm-hmm.
It's an old truck, captain.
We need a new one.
A better one.
Yeah, it could be a Red Cross truck so no one shoots at us.
An ambulance?
Stop fucking around.
Captain?
You need to sign this.
What is it?
Do you have a pen?
Wait.
Come on.
Here it is.
Give it to me.
Thank you.
Hey, boss.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
You.
What did you do?
What did you do?
You brought me here!
What did you do?
You did this!
What did I do?
Your father did...
Liar!
What did you do?
You're lying, you bitch!
You're lying!
Your father!
He let him in!
No, he didn't!
You're lying, you bitch!
You're lying!
How was she?
Good.
What do you see in our future, Petar?
See these buildings there?
Yeah.
We'll wait for the fire to go out, and then we'll clear it.
Start afresh.
Maybe we could...
Get out.
Knock before you enter the room of a commanding officer.
Do you hear me?
Your mother would turn in her grave if she knew what you're doing.
You think it's all right to be with a Muslim whore?
Do you think it's all right?
Danijel.
Danijel.
Son, get rid of her.
That's not for you.
Trust me.
That's bad blood.
Danijel.
We must get rid of them.
Do you hear me?
Get rid of her, son.
Do you hear me?
Let me deal with this on my own.
On my own.
Don't!
Nebojsa.
My friend!
We are the same.
We're all Bosnians!
Nebojsa, I know you!
I should be able to trust you.
Did I make a mistake?
No.
I'm afraid I did.
Are you my enemy?
No.
Am I your enemy?
No.
Why weren't you born a Serb?
In other news...
Summer 1995
...at the United Nations today, the U.
S. Ambassador, Madeleine Albright
presented evidence of mass graves near the Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
Albright says the satellite photos support allegations that the Serb forces,
who captured the area last month,
systematically executed the Muslim men and boys who came into their custody.
The Red Cross claims at least
7,000 men from Srebrenica
are missing and feared dead.
Three men who escaped from the Bosnian town were reported to have...
Thank you.
I thought you left.
Put this on.
You look beautiful.
Where is everyone?
I gave them a night off.
Beautiful, huh?
I love his brushstrokes.
So bold.
I always wanted to touch it.
So do it.
I can't.
There's no one here.
We're alone, just you and I.
It's more about the empty space.
The "empty space"?
Mmm-hmm.
It's the choice not to do something there.
Look!
I found one I like.
No, really.
I like this one.
The Story of Empty Space.
Very funny.
I have to go to the front line again tomorrow.
Do you?
When are you coming back?
I'm not sure.
But by Wednesday night,
I'll get in touch with you.
How?
I will order my cook to punish you.
If you get no dinner on Wednesday night, that means I'm safe.
Then I'll be happy to starve that night.
Why Wednesday?
On Wednesday, we meet in the church across from the museum.
Whoever makes it there is safe.
They're not bombing churches?
They're not bombing churches, which works in our favor.
So don't worry.
Stay here.
Darko.
Your father is asking for you.
Did something happen?
I don't know. He called an urgent meeting for all senior officers.
You go.
I'll follow.
I have to go.
What's happening?
Go home on your own.
Just follow the road up the hill.
Will you be all right?
Yes.
Here it is, my friends.
NATO has already started bombing our positions.
That fucking Clinton is trying to save his political ass at home in Washington.
Ljubo, give it to me.
Here.
Just read this.
"Intervening to put an end to ethnic cleansing"
"and mass atrocities."
Apparently they need to save face, make some noise, and throw their idea of justice at a country they know nothing about. That's it.
We expect that our position, our area, will be hit at any time.
But it doesn't matter.
Six hundred years after the Battle of Kosovo, here we are again.
On the eve of the Kosovo battle, King Lazar chose the heavenly kingdom over the earthly one.
And tonight, my brothers, we have the same choice before us.
We will not negotiate.
We will not be humiliated.
That's right.
They're attacking us.
And, once again, we Serbs will be unbreakable.
- To Serbs.
- To Serbs!
- To freedom!
- To freedom!
Left, left!
Go left!
Let's go down there!
Aco!
Aco!
That piece of shit!
Go, go!
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go! Go!
Hey!
Hey, Darko.
Darko.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I got it, I got it.
Watch out.
Watch yourselves.
Come on, hurry up.
It's me, we are at the church.
No dinner tonight for the painter, okay?
Understand?
Are you surprised to see me alive, you Turkish pig!
Why are you here?
To be with you.
Where did you go that night?
Were you with your Muslim friends?
Did you tell them I was in the church?
I saw your sister.
I'm sorry.
Hey!
Stop!
I said stop!
Raise your hands up.
Stop!
Put your hands up.
My name is Danijel Vukojevich.
I am a war criminal.
My name is Danijel Vukojevich.
I am a war criminal.
For three and a half years, the international community failed to decisively intervene and stop the war in Bosnia.
The siege of Sarajevo was the longest in modern history.
Across the country, 1 in every 2
Bosnians was forced to flee their homes.
During the war, as many as fifty thousand Bosnian women were raped, leading to the first conviction for sexual violence, on its own, as a crime against humanity.
The war in Bosnia was the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II.
Since 1995, an uneasy peace has prevailed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Still deep divisions remain, and the struggle for reconciliation continues.
FARMER 1: Come on, easy. Easy, girl.
FARMER 2: Easy.
- Easy.
- Good. That'll do it.
- Steady.
- Good girl.
Steady.
FARMER 1: Good girl! Good girl!
This is a stubborn one, huh?
Easy. Attagirl.
FARMER 2: There we go.
Who's a clever girl, then?
Come on, boy. Come here.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Come on. Easy does it, easy does it.
Come on.
Steady there, boy. Steady, boy.
That's it. Nice and done now, isn't it?
Hey, hey!
MAN: Morning, Pop.
Put your mark here.
Good luck.
Get the colt.
Whoa, whoa.
Easy. Hey.
Now that's a beauty.
Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred.
Not got a day's work in him.
Now there...
There's your ticket.
But look at him, Si.
Look at that creature.
Don't be daft. You need something solid to plow a field.
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, settle down, settle down.
Horses on my right, men with money in their pockets on my left.
- It's the perfect combination.
- Is Fred Goddard here?
- Yes, I's here!
Good. More money than sense.
- Dave Hill!
- I'm here, yes!
Bugger off, you tight bastard.
You've been coming here for 20 years, never bought so much as a pork scratching!
Come on.
AUCTIONEER: All right.
First up today, a gorgeous young horse.
Prettiest young thing I've seen since my wife on our wedding day.
Let's get going, shall we?
Who wants this wonderful creature?
One guinea!
One guinea. One guinea.
I thought you needed a plow horse,
Mr. Narracott.
AUCTIONEER: One guinea.
Any advance on one guinea?
- Two guineas!
- Two guineas.
- Three.
- AUCTIONEER: Three guineas.
Ted Narracott, it's completely the wrong animal.
Si Easton, I'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.
- Five guineas!
- AUCTIONEER: Five guineas!
- Six!
- Oh, for the love of...
- Seven!
- AUCTIONEER: Seven guineas.
Greedy sod.
Thinks he can just buy anybody. Eight!
Stop it. He's your landlord.
You can't be picking fights with him.
- Ten guineas!
- AUCTIONEER: Ten guineas.
You haven't got the money.
Let's go home, let's have a pint.
Eleven guineas, sir! From as good a man as any in this town!
AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear 12 guineas? Twelve guineas.
That's top price for a working animal.
Ted, save it for the shire!
There are big days and there are small days. Which will it be?
AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear any advance on 11 guineas?
Just let him go, Dad.
I don't care for him. He's too jumpy.
Shall we say 25?
- AUCTIONEER: Twenty-five guineas.
- He's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
You were great, Mr. N.
- Gave him a run for his money.
- Going, going...
- Thirty!
Thirty guineas!
AUCTIONEER: Thirty guineas.
Thirty guineas.
Going.
Going.
Gone! To Mr. Ted Narracott!
What have you done, Ted?
What have you done?
Here you are, Ted.
Quite a beast there. What are you gonna do with him on a working farm?
I hope you got the rent, Ted.
I'll be around for it when it comes due.
You're a fool, Ted.
And now Rosie will never forgive you.
- What have you done?
- That's Mooney's colt.
You were supposed to buy a plow horse!
You bought him?
What'd you pay for him?
How much, Ted Narracott?
I won't tell you a lie, though I would love to.
Thirty guineas!
Thirty guineas?
He's not worth 10! Are you out of your mind? What about the rent?
He's a strong one, Rosie.
Look at the way he holds his head.
How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that'?
Ted, you have to take him back.
You have to take him back right now.
You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.
No. No, please, don't take him back.
We can't take him back until he's broken in.
And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?
I'll train him.
You stay out of this, Albert.
You don't know nothing about horses.
Please, Mum. Please, let me. I can do it.
We have to keep him. No choice.
Right. Well, you got one month to break him in, or I'm taking him back myself.
How'd you get to 30?
What other fool bid you up that high?
It was Lyons.
We're going to lose everything.
After all we've been through, we're going to lose it all.
Don't worry, Mum. I'll raise him.
I'll raise him good.
Well, you better. Go on, get started!
See if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours.
Easy, boy. Easy. Easy.
Right.
Let's make a start then.
It's oats.
Very tasty, that is.
It's beef and gravy to us.
Come on.
I'll bet you're missing your mother.
Look at you.
First time without your mum.
First time away from home.
But you're not alone, are you?
In fact.
'Cause I'm here.
It's all right.
All right.
I'm going to call you Joey.
You understand?
Joey. That's you.
And I'm Albert.
It's all right. You're mine now.
You're mine.
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy. Come on.
Whoa.
I want you to stay there, Joey.
Stay.
That's it.
Good boy. That's it, you got it.
ANDREW: Hey, look at him, Albie!
He's playing Grandma's Footsteps!
All right. Come on, Joey. Back you go.
Come on.
Come on. Back you go. You're all right.
That's it. Good boy. All right.
You got to stay there. You understand?
That's it. Good boy. Good boy.
You've got it. Good boy.
ANDREW: Good boy.
Good.
Now call him. Whistle.
Come now, Joey.
Come on.
You can come now, Joey.
- I don't think he fancies your owls.
- I read it in a story.
It's how the Indians used to summon their horses.
Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've got to come. Understand?
My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him.
He used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and...
He's not a dog.
He's just puzzling it through.
Will you look at you!
Albie!
There's only 15 here.
The rest will come.
You know by rights I could take this farm back today, don't you?
And I'm a great believer in my rights.
It will come.
If you drank less beer and bought fewer horses, you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.
I said I'll pay you.
We're going to plant the bottom field.
The bottom field's rock hard.
Only stones down there.
No. We're going to plow it.
Just give me till the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe you, with interest.
How are you going to plow it?
Not with that fancy animal of yours.
He'll do it.
You'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow, even drunk on a Tuesday night.
You know that.
And I can't wait for the money, there's a war coming.
I promise you that field will be plowed.
We'll plant it with turnips.
The money will be yours when harvest comes.
Please, sir. Please.
Very well.
If that fancy plows that field,
I'll give you till October to set things straight.
What if he doesn't?
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
And I'll take your father's farm, and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company.
No, please. Sir, you can't do that.
Now, now, lad. What?
Are you bladdered as well?
Ted Narracott,
I've got you down in my book.
- You can't harness him.
- He's got to be collared.
You're scaring him, Dad!
You're scaring him.
- He can't take a plow!
- He's got to plow!
ALBERT: He won't be able to do it!
He's too young.
He's not even been backed yet!
Ted!
It's all right, boy. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
I knew this would happen
as soon as I laid eyes on him.
Ted, no.
Ted, no!
He's worth nothing to me.
If he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!
- Dad?
- Move aside.
Dad, stop!
You shoot that horse, we have nothing.
ROSE: No!
You were right what you said, Dad.
He'll do it.
You told Lyons he'll plow that field, and he will.
You'll see.
He'll show you.
We'll show you.
We'll get it done.
Let go.
Let go.
Go back to the house.
Some days are best forgotten.
Today ain't one of them. Come on.
How are you today, Joey?
I don't know much about life, boy, but I do know that there are big days and there are small days.
Most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone.
But this...
Well, this is a big one.
This is our big day!
It's cold out there, so I'm going to take this off.
If it's tough for you, it should be tough for me, too.
Now, I'm going to teach you how to plow.
And you're going to learn.
Is that understood?
Then we can be together, which is how I believe things are meant to be.
Steady, boy.
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Now, boy. Easy. Easy.
Look at me, Joey.
See?
See?
You just got to put your nose through.
That's it.
See, you've got it. You've got it.
Good boy.
There.
Too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots.
Even a sturdy plow horse would never manage it alone.
Yet he will, I say.
You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert told you so.
It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate, even if he is a bit barmy.
A team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?
Of course he's watching.
ALBERT: Come on.
Come on.
Well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted.
Picture of his father, he is.
Not a dollop of ordinary sense, but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible. (CHUCKLES)
Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among them, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stony patch of unpromising ground.
You've fettle enough for 20 men.
But with a gimpy leg and the drinking...
For the pain, isn't it, that you drink?
None of us could have anticipated an ending better than this.
Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours.
Thought you were a spark, she did!
And now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
See, Joey?
I got the collar, too!
Okay, come on, boy.
Walk on. That's it.
Walk on!
Walk on, Joey.
Come on, boy, walk on!
You'd be better off standing at the top of the hill and going down!
Gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad!
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!
Come on, Joey, walk on.
Walk on, boy.
Walk on. Come on, walk on.
It'll take the whip to move him.
Bravo! You reached the top of the hill!
Off you go again, boy!
You'll make even better time coming down!
ALBERT: That's the way. Now, come on, keep straight, boy. Good boy.
Keep straight. Good lad. Good lad.
Now walk on. Good boy.
Good boy. Now come on, dig in!
(VILLAGERS SHOUTING
ENCOURAGEMENT)
Albie, we're all with you!
ALBERT: Come on, keep it straight, boy.
That's it, walk on. Walk on.
- Look, look, the plow hasn't even cut yet.
Do you know,
I believe we can do it, Joey.
I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the best of us.
That's why he bought you.
He knows you have all the courage he never had.
I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us!
Whoa.
You've got no chance, lad.
He'll not turn over half an acre.
Give it up now.
You've done well. You've tried hard.
You're more of a man than your father.
Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it'?
Well, he'll destroy that horse.
I'll be over Thursday.
Give you a day to close it up.
Your wool.
I'm sorry, Rosie.
Now, boy!
You've got to do it, Joey!
You don't know, so I'm going to have to do the knowing for you.
The rest of our lives depend on this!
So get set to pull! And pull straight!
And pull hard!
Now, boy! Go!
Walk on, Joey, walk on! Whoa! That's it!
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!
Walk on! Walk on! Walk on!
Walk on, Joey!
Go on, walk on! That's it.
Walk on. Walk on.
Go around it!
Whoa, Joey!
Whoa. Joey! Joey!
Joey! Whoa! Whoa!
Joey, stop, you'll break the blade!
Will you look at you!
BOY: Mum, Dad! Come and look!
WOMAN 1: He's doing it!
MAN 1: Good lad, Albie!
WOMAN 2: Albert, well done!
MAN 2: I wouldn't have believed it!
I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade.
He could lose a foot.
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son!
Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm!
Come on, Albie! Push on through!
Get it done, Albie! Get it done.
Albie, are you all right?
Are you all right?
Up you get.
My pair of fools. My mighty fools.
You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
- Where's Dad?
- Still in the bottom field.
Stumbling about, I suppose.
It's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble.
He drinks, Mum!
So might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen.
He don't talk to me about it.
He don't talk about it 'cause he can't.
There aren't words for some things.
Come here.
The mice have been at it.
Sit down.
Here.
It's his campaign pennant.
He were Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry.
And that is the Queen's South Africa Medal.
Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those.
And this...
That's the
Distinguished Conduct Medal.
- Not Dad's?
- Well, it isn't mine, dear.
He got that after the fighting at Transvaal.
After he'd been hurt and he'd saved some other lads, and, well, I don't know what else.
He won't tell me, either.
But the first day he got home he just tossed them out.
First day he could walk, he threw them straight in the dustbin and wouldn't hear a word I said not to.
See, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy.
It's good to be proud when you've done something good.
But what he done in Africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.
Hard as it surely was and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing,
I suppose.
I'd be proud.
If I'd gone off to war, if I'd gone and saved my mates...
Whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him, think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.
Your dad makes mistakes, and he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made, but he never gave up.
And he does that for us.
And today, you showed the world it's all been worth it.
You keep looking after Joey, and he'll always be looking after you.
"Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry."
You see this, Joey?
It's been through an entire war.
I'm not stealing it.
I'll give it back to him someday.
Um...
I'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me.
That's right, and this is my dad's car.
- You're lucky that you're in it.
- Your dad's car.
I'm not normally allowed to drive it
'cause it's so...
Is he a friend of yours?
Come on, boy.
Let's show her how to fly!
- Ahhh!
- Oh!
Well, you're clearly not going to be a jumper.
ROSE: Shoo, Harold!
We can try planting something else.
Or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.
How else are we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent?
What are we going to do?
I used to believe that God gave each man his fair portion of bad luck.
I don't feel that any more.
I've had more than my share.
You'll stop loving me, Rose, and I won't blame you when you do.
Well, I might hate you more, but I'll never love you less.
MOTORBIKE RIDER: It's War!
We are at war with Germany!
You hear?
England is at war with Germany!
They're going to ring the bells at 6:00, and then never ring them again until the war is over.
Look smart, Joey lad!
It's the Tavistock Fair!
What has he done with him?
First name, middle name, last. Sign.
Last name first.
First name, middle name, last.
TED: Take my word for it, finest horse in the parish.
Goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine.
No curbs, no splints. Good feet and teeth.
He's as sound as a bell, sir.
And how much are you charging, sir, for this strong, decent, and very fine animal?
Forty.
I'll give you 20 and not a penny more.
Twenty's no good to me, Captain.
Thirty-five and he's yours.
I don't even know how he rides.
Oh, he rides. Splendidly.
You'll be astonished, I promise you that.
Finest horse in all of Devon.
Finest horse I've ever seen.
Thank you.
You can't.
You can't. He's mine.
- I trained him.
- Albert.
You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.
I'm afraid it's too late, lad.
I've just paid 30 guineas for him.
Please. I'll get you money.
I will, I'll get you money.
I'll work for it.
I'll work for it.
He won't obey anyone else.
He won't be any good in the war neither.
He shies at every sound.
I'm sorry.
Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too.
I'm volunteering.
- I see. What's your name, lad?
- Albert, sir.
- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.
- Is that the truth?
- No, sir, but I look 19 and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds, and I'm strong, sir, and I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering.
Your father's done what he had to do, you know that.
Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey, I know that.
But it's all I've got.
Will you lease him to me, Albert?
To be my own mount?
I promise you, man to man, that I'll look after him as closely as you've done.
I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him.
And if I can, I'll return him to your care.
Now say goodbye.
It's all right.
All right, turn it in. That's enough.
He's a horse, not a dog.
Now on your way. Come on!
Do you want to lose the farm? Rose?
It's the way you did it.
But we're at war.
Aren't we just?
Joey.
I told you, sling your hook!
Let him be, Perkins.
This isn't the end.
This isn't the end, my brother.
I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again.
Wherever you are, I will find you, and I will bring you home.
Steady, steady. Steady now, come on!
Walk on! Walk on, come on! Get on!
- Take good care of him.
- Yes, sir. I will.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy. Easy.
Easy.
PERKINS: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Steady, steady. Whoa, whoa, Joey!
Stop mucking about, you hear?
You're in the army now, son.
Good boy. Good boy. Steady.
Steady, steady. Come on.
Easy, come on.
Come on, around. Good boy.
Relax.
Easy, easy, back up!
Joey, meet Topthorn.
Topthorn, this is Joey.
Sort out who's in charge between the two of you. Do you hear?
If you want to fight, get it over with
'cause once we're over there, you're going to need everything you've got for Fritz.
Gently, Perkins.
I don't want to sour him.
There'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir.
And there'll be nothing gentle about this one, either.
I understand that, Sergeant, but I want him fit and shining.
He's my horse.
Sir.
Easy, boy.
Scares the living daylights out of me.
- Who?
- Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Still, not a patch on my Topthorn.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I think he's got potential.
He's certainly got the bit between his teeth.
I actually think my Blenheim's faster than the pair of them.
Clear off.
All right, gentlemen, listen here.
Everything tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of Mars-la-Tour.
The first attack can and should be the decisive one. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.
- No excuses, no mistakes.
Every horse groomed and fit for presentation.
- I want a full practice charge tomorrow.
- Sir.
I thought you two had bottled out.
As if.
All right, then. Let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we?
This is what quiet confidence looks like.
I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
Over to you, Captain Nicholls.
NICHOLLS: Draw swords!
Give point!
Charge!
Come on, Joey, I know you've got it.
Come on, boy!
NICHOLLS: Come on, boy!
- Whoa! Whoa!
Nice of you to turn up.
He's got speed, I'll give him that.
But has he got stamina?
He has everything.
What are you up to?
I'm writing a letter.
With a picture in it?
It's to the boy who owned Joey.
I want to show him how wonderful he's looking.
Before we take him across the Channel to face a million German guns.
Yes, before that.
4:00 a.m. start tomorrow, traveling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport detachment.
They need to be at the dock at 5:00 a.m. to check all the kit.
Battle orders, no polishing.
Buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons, let them all go dull.
I don't want anything to flash in the sun and give us away.
Of course.
- Charlie.
- Jamie.
Charlie.
What do you think of the new cap?
Silk lining. I quite like it.
I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Think about it.
You're a Boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot, and you thought, "Good Lord", one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!."
You might shoot the other one instead.
Or alternatively think, "I fancy that cap," and kill you first of all.
Hadn't thought of that.
SINGH: That is our target, the German 11th Division, at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the Menin Road.
We have been watching them, and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
Knock them out and we could slide in behind the German lines and come at them from the south at Geluveld.
Excellent.
- Numbers?
- About 600, infantry.
Twice our size.
Regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours.
And we have surprise on our side.
But the sooner we move, the better.
We have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning.
Right. Good.
So today it is. Charlie, tell the men.
- Salisbury formation?
- Salisbury formation.
Charge through them and secure the ground behind.
The grass to the left is taller than we are, it's perfect cover.
Excellent work, Sergeant Major.
STEWART: Time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.
NICHOLLS: Thank you, Singh.
Jamie!
They have no idea we're coming.
Not having scruples, are you, Jim?
No, I understand the surprise is everything.
But if it must be done, let's do it quickly.
You all right, Charlie?
Never been better.
Literally. Never better.
Prepare to mount! Mount!
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
Thank you, Stanley.
Hey, Joey.
MY bonny boy.
You're all right, aren't you, Joey?
Eh?
STEWART: Gentlemen, it is an honor to ride beside you.
Make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us.
Let every man make himself, his King, his country, and his fallen comrades proud.
Be brave.
Fear God! Honor the King!
SOLDIERS: Fear God! Honor the King!
Draw swords!
Good luck, my friends.
Forward, to walk!
Walk, march!
Forward, to canter!
Canter, march!
Kavallerie!
Charge!
GERMAN SOLDIER:
Burn the documents!
Pull him down!
What? Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended?
Look at yourself!
Who do you think you are?
(WHINNIES AND SNORTS
ANXIOUSLY)
- Now come!
- What do we do with the horses?
- If they're injured, shoot them.
And the others, sir?
The others you round up and take to base camp. They will pull guns.
You'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.
- Then shoot them also!
- Sir?
Perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances, to get the injured men off the field.
- Will they take the harness?
- I'd like to try, sir.
It won't work. They're cavalry.
- Let's try.
- You won't get the harness on.
Come on, Michael. Whoa. Whoa.
Easy now.
Easy now, Englishman. Easy.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Easy now.
Whoa.
Gunther.
It's hopeless. We can't help them.
Well, well, look at you.
Whoever taught you this has just saved your life.
Hello, the farm!
Hello, Si Easton.
I was at the post office.
And while I was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel had come for Albert from the...
From the...
From over there. And I thought
I could go up that way in the morning, and here it is.
Who'd be sending me a parcel over there?
Well, open it and see.
ALBERT: It's a sketchbook.
It's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!
See that? That's a picture of Joey!
ROSE: It's a picture of Joey.
Well, I never!
And there's a letter.
Well, go on then, go on.
"Dear Albert Narracott,
Captain Nicholls, who died..."
"Captain Nicholls, who died in action today, left you this."
"Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins."
You weren't to know it was bad news.
He was riding Joey when he died.
- You don't know that he was riding him.
- "In action," it says.
Gentlemen!
We move forward to the front line tonight.
Full marching orders.
Get moving!
Schroeder!
No, not you. You. Come.
I'm keeping you here.
You're best with the horses, and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continues to push through from the west.
- They're pushing through?
- I'm told.
We will move later, when we find where the horses are needed most.
Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my brother here with me.
He's also very good with horses.
No. Not necessary.
Get moving, we leave tonight.
It's all right, Gunther.
You are not going.
I'll tell them you're only 14.
That you're a boy.
Father signed me in. He knew my age.
And so do they.
Mother obviously never told you how to fold a shirt.
Of course she did. I just wasn't listening.
But you need to listen now.
I promised her.
I made her a solemn promise that you would be safe with me.
With me, Michael.
They'll never make a head count.
There are too many of us.
You can stay here.
Slip underneath the bed, until they move out.
Then what?
Gunther, it will be fine.
And when all the machines break down and they call up the horses,
I'll see you at the front.
We'll be together again.
Gunther.
GUNTHER: I'm giving this to you.
For luck.
To keep you safe.
Ah!
Get back in line!
I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
I'm sorry.
- Will Father be ashamed?
- He will pretend to be.
Maybe at first he will be.
But in the end, he will be glad.
And us?
What about us?
I was ready to go.
I was proud to go.
I wanted to go.
The food in Italy is good.
Yes.
And what about the women?
Not as good as the food.
Because they've eaten too much of the food?
You are too young for war and you're too young for women!
I don't feel so young.
- Not any more.
- Michael.
- What?
- Go to sleep.
We have a big night of riding ahead.
Good night, Michael.
Night-night, Gunther.
- Schroeder.
- Yes, sir.
A mistake?
A promise.
Ja.
Grand-père.
It's closer today.
The wind plays tricks with the noise.
It's moving away from us.
I can hear it, grand-père.
And there is no wind.
You shouldn't lie to me.
Here. There is no wind here.
But over there, the wind is so strong it will lift you off the ground.
You lie about everything!
You say you aren't worried, but it's clear you are.
I know the war is approaching, but you say,
"Oh, it's just a trick of the wind."
Did I say that?
You started lying when Mama and Papa went away.
They're dead.
But you won't say so.
Do you think I'll die if you tell me the truth?
The truth is you should speak to your elders with respect.
If you tell me the truth about the war,
I will tell you the truth about the big horses
I've been keeping in the windmill.
Now who is the one telling lies?
In the windmill?
Yes. They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote.
This is François and this is Claude.
I named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer.
They must belong to someone.
Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy tale.
Yes, I know, grand-pére.
They are not unicorns.
- Now, Emilie...
- So I will be fair and wait one day, and if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me.
Emilie, look at me.
You cannot ride.
Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way
- with the slightest bump or fall.
- Yes. That's right. So, it is settled?
Good girl.
It will only be settled when I decide which one to ride first.
(EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATION
IN FRENCH)
Over my dead body!
At least I won't have long to wait!
I was in love with a boy called François, who had your lovely eyes.
Unfortunately, he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth.
She fell for a boy called Claude, who broke my heart and who I intend to marry one day.
EMILIE: Eyes on me.
No talking.
Today, we learn to jump.
Did you know the French cleared the 1.85 meter at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal?
Today, we will beat that record.
This is your jump.
When I call you, be very brave and leap over it!
Leap over it!
Watch me.
And now it's your...
He doesn't think we can do it.
But we will show him, won't we?
No need to be afraid.
You are very tall.
You'll kill yourself.
Only if you get in my way to make me fall.
Oh, please. Come off the...
Find somewhere to hide them.
And do it quickly.
My name is Bonnard. This is my land.
Why are you here?
Food. For the soldiers at the front.
Everyone must give their share.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
They are taking everything.
Where are the horses?
What horses?
- What is it?
- Leave it if you don't know what it's for.
A pot is a pot. We'll find some use for it.
Sir.
- Where's the livestock?
- I make jam. We have no animals.
But there's fresh hay in your barn.
We use it to replace the mattress stuffings.
- Her grandfather?
- Yes.
- Where are her parents?
- They're dead.
They died.
(THUMPING SOUNDS
COMING FROM UPSTAIRS)
What is that?
The wind. It plays tricks in the attic.
There is no wind.
An old house creaks.
Go, close the shutters.
She's sickly, no?
If you or any of your friends harm her, as old as I am, I will kill you.
You know,
I was going to give you back your pot.
But now I'm going to keep it.
For soup.
We will be back.
In the new season.
Tell me what happened to them.
To my mother and father.
You said you would tell me how they died on my birthday.
And tomorrow's my birthday.
They died fighting.
Didn't they?
But when the soldiers come, you do nothing.
- You are a coward, aren't you?
- Yes.
It was your parents who were brave.
I make jams.
And you've never done a brave thing in your life?
Maybe there are different ways to be brave.
Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons?
And this could be the difference in the war, our messages getting through.
I don't want to hear about the birds.
They are released at the front and told to go home.
This is all they know.
But to get there, they must fly over a war.
Can you imagine such a thing?
Here you are flying over so much pain and terror, and you know you can never look down.
You have to look forward, or you'll never get home.
I ask you, what could be braver than that?
- What is that?
- A present.
I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear, like last year.
It was disgusting?
- Yes.
I looked like an ugly nun.
Give me your hand.
Grand-pére, we have no money!
When the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages.
Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything you say.
You are, of course, the boss.
It's just an old thing I found.
Don't worry yourself. Leave it.
I'll put it back.
It was your mother's.
I hid it so as not to encourage you.
Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly.
Very carefully.
- And promise me you won't go far.
- Of course.
To the top of the hill and straight back again.
I promise.
MY hero!
Slowly. Slowly.
Emilie!
Emilie!
- Let go of me! No!
- She is my granddaughter!
- François!
- Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please!
- Don't hurt her.
- No!
You don't need them.
There are so many others!
Please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one.
You are breaking my granddaughter's heart.
The war has taken everything from everyone.
- What will happen to them'?
- They will pull artillery until they die.
Or until the war is over.
It will never be over!
You have your answer then.
Heiglemann.
- These are yours.
- Yes, sir.
They look strong.
Should last a month or two.
You're beautiful.
It's a pity they found you.
Such a pity.
OFFICER: Pull together, men!
Pull together!
Together, men! Together!
Put your backs into it!
Steady pace! Steady pace!
- Watch out, number three's slacking!
- Move it, move it!
Halt! Halt! Break!
Break! Stop! Stop!
Heiglemann! Bring out another one!
Heiglemann, bring up another horse!
BRANDT: That one!
No, no! The big black one!
He's a good horse, sir.
But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.
Prince is already losing condition.
His leg, sir.
- You have given them names?
- Yes, sir.
You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose.
But his leg is not good enough, sir.
Private, you will do
as you are told.
Hook him up!
Can't you see, sir? This one is stronger.
Hook him up!
OFFICER: No slacking!
Keep it taut! Use your whip!
No slacking! To the top!
OFFICER: Halt!
Take the horses away.
OFFICER 2: Shell!
And load!
Back!
Case!
OFFICER 3: Position!
OFFICER 22 And fire!
Valuables in the bucket, lads!
If you live, you'll get them back!
If you live, you get them back.
Good luck!
Valuables in the bucket!
CHAPLAIN: The blood of Christ keep thee in eternal life.
In the name of the Father and of the Son...
Maybe it's a drill, Albie.
Maybe it's a drill, like last time.
Love letter?
Well, that's my business.
I hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again.
Are you going to write a letter to your horse?
After you find your horse,
I've lost my needle in a haystack and I could use some help.
Anything valuable!
Anyone who comes back gets to share it out!
Stay here.
Remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car?
I remember you somersaulting through the air.
Who was that girl you were with?
There was a girl?
There was. Don't you remember?
It was just some girl, I suppose.
I don't recall which one.
I do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch.
You see?
Always entertaining, Narracott.
I'll give you that.
You did that? You fell on your bum?
MARTIN: Into position! Everyone ready!
- OFFICER: There she goes!
- Into position! Let's go!
- Go! Choke on it!
- Yes, Sarge!
Be brave, boys! Be ready! Be ready!
Let's go, men, get ready to go!
Hold your nerve, boys!
Remember, it's not too far to go, there's a way through!
Run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open, and God and the King will keep an eye on you.
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix bayonets!
You know what it reminds me of out there?
- What?
- That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it.
Best day of my life, that was, and you were there.
And this here is the worst day of my life about to begin, and you're here cheering me on.
Us two, always!
And him.
Once you're in no man's land, go to the flank,
- stay on the flank.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, boys, to the ladders!
- Stick close to the gentry, yeah?
That's our ticket. We have the pluck, but they have the luck.
Come on, boys, keep going.
Keep going.
Andrew.
You, too, Narracott.
And you, too.
Come on. On your ladders, boys!
On your ladders.
In you go! In you go! That's it!
Listen to your Sergeant!
If anybody turns back, if any one of our boys comes running towards you, you take this rifle and you shoot them dead!
- Do you understand?
- SOLDIERS: Yes, sir!
Do you understand me? Do you understand what I'm telling you, son?
You take this rifle and you shoot them dead.
You understand?
Up there, son. Up your ladder!
Up your ladder to your work!
It's good. Andrew, it's good.
Andrew!
Nobody's retreating today.
Andrew! Andrew, nobody is retreating today!
MARTIN: Ready to go over the top!
Just leave me! Leave me!
You'll be all right here. You'll be safe.
Someone will come for you.
Albert.
- Albert, listen.
- It's all right.
It's all right. We're Devon boys. Yeah?
Yeah.
SOLDIER: Get down!
No!
Albie.
(SOBBING) We made it.
We made it.
Andrew! This way out!
Gas, gas, gas!
Albie.
There's no stopping here.
Keep them moving!
But, sir, there's something wrong.
This one needs to rest.
There's no rest for them.
Move them along! Move them along!
Please, please, please.
Stay on your feet. No, please!
No, no, no.
No. Please.
Please. Stay on your feet.
Come on, come on. Please.
No, please. Stay on your feet. Come on.
They're coming. Leave it, Private!
Leave it!
Come with me.
Go to hell!
Run!
Run! Run!
Run!
Run!
GEORDIE: Stand to, stand to.
There's something moving.
What the hell is it?
It looks like a cow.
What the hell would a cow be doing up there?
That definitely isn't a cow.
Well, what is it?
It can't be a horse.
Nothing alive could be out there.
It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse!
Yes, it's a horse.
- It's a horse.
- Yeah, it's a horse.
Well, bugger me.
It's a horse!
(SOLDIERS EXCLAIMING
IN SURPRISE)
Lads, we should call him.
How do you call a horse?
(ALL BRITISH SOLDIERS
CLICKING TONGUES)
(ALL GERMAN SOLDIERS
WHISTLING)
He's caught on the wire.
Oh, sod it.
BRITISH CAPTAIN: What do you think you're doing?
Get back, do you hear me?
Corporal, that's an order. Get back!
Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.
What's he doing?
It's a trap.
No, I don't think so.
I think he's trying to help.
Scare him back into his hole.
It's a white flag, isn't it?
You see the white flag?
I'm just after tending to this here horse is all!
Get back, you stupid git!
GEORDIE: "The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."
"He leadeth me into green pastures."
"He leadeth me down beside still waters."
Poor beastie.
Poor babbie.
It's all right.
It's all right, don't buck and wriggle so.
You're only shredding yourself.
You'll blind yourself.
Bugger me worthless. I didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut the...
- Ow!
I thought perhaps you might need these.
For the barbed wire.
Yeah.
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, I...
Thanks.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Thanks.
That's a very long strand.
And when you cut it, it's going to release this, and this, and this.
And they'll coil back rather violently, which, I'm afraid, will only wound the poor fellow further.
You speak good English.
I speak English well.
May I?
What if we cut his head free first, so he won't try to stand up and blind himself?
- And then...
- Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
Then I could cut the wire here.
We need more wire cutters!
His blind spot.
The cutters won't frighten him.
If you could cut here, holding this wire,
- I could...
- Say no more. I'm right behind you.
And you understand what's happening, do you not, O Best Beloved'?
And you must lay so very nice and still.
There's a lad.
A remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you.
There's a lad.
There's a remarkable lad.
So, how's things in yonder trench?
Delightful.
We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.
If you ever need any more rats, we can always send ours over
'cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking.
Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.
Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
Big strapping German girls, eh?
Kind what give robust massages?
Every Thursday.
And they bring rum cake on your birthday.
Okay. All right.
Look at that horse!
Look at the muscles he's got.
Them long legs.
They're made for running, horses.
Running away from danger.
Running away is all they have.
And yet we taught 'em opposite.
Running into the fray.
- A war horse.
- Yeah.
War horse.
There he is.
What a strange beast you've become.
And now?
I'll take him back with me, yeah?
Since I supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. This is fair, no?
In a pig's eye.
He's English, plain to see.
- You mean because he's so filthy?
- Because he's so smart!
And you're none too clean yourself.
We could box.
And the winner gets the horse.
No, thanks, pet.
Must be careful not to start a war.
Do you have a coin of any sort?
- Coin toss?
- Yeah.
- All right, Fritz, you're on.
- My name is not Fritz.
It is Peter.
Peter. I'm Colin.
- You call it, Colin.
- Heads.
That's the face of my Kaiser, and he does not look pleased with me.
The horse is yours.
Gone quiet, hasn't it?
Yes.
But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.
I'm a terrible shot, Pete.
Don't believe I'll ever hit a target.
Thanks.
Cheerio, mate.
- You'll take good care of him, yes?
- I will.
Our strange beast.
And you take care of your own strange self.
Colin!
A pair of German cutters.
In memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.
Thanks. I'll use them back in the garden in South Shields.
You keep your head down now, Pete, my lad.
PETER: Remarkable.
A remarkable horse!
We're full up. Move on.
We're full up. Move on.
The gas got him.
We had to wait till morning.
- This can't be all of us.
- This is all.
All walking wounded away to the dressing station!
Away to the dressing station!
NURSE: Just hold still.
You're doing so well.
DOCTOR: What's this doing here?
GEORDIE: We need a vet, sir.
There are no vets.
There are scarcely any horses left.
He's cut all over, but this leg here has got the worst of it.
- It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
- Please, sir!
I've all these men to take care of,
Corporal. You can see that, can't you?
Please, sir, this horse can pull through anything!
ALBERT: What is it?
It's a horse they found wandering about in no man's land. Down you go.
What kind of a horse?
Bloody miraculous kind of a horse be my guess.
Nothing makes it out of no man's land.
Miraculous horse.
He was alive, you see, sir, where nothing survives.
Soto me and my mates, to the men, sir, he's...
Well, we have high hopes for him.
You should shoot him now.
- Oh, but I can't.
- It'd be a mercy, lad.
That leg's not going to mend.
Sergeant.
Put him out of his misery.
NURSE: He's not going to shoot it here, is he?
HEAD NURSE: What's going on here?
NURSE: They're going to shoot the horse.
Ladies, if you please.
HEAD NURSE: Come, nurses.
All right, back off! Back off!
Go on, do it again. Go on.
Joey?
Hello, Joey. Where you been then, eh?
Where in the world you been?
Do you know this man?
- What's your name?
- Narracott.
Private Albert Narracott, sir.
It's just a random horse, Narracott, and too badly injured.
- Is this man in your care?
- Yes, sir.
He's not random at all, sir!
He's my horse. I raised him, in Devon.
Sir, look at his legs.
He's got four white socks, he's brown all over, and he has a white mark here, like so.
- Take him back.
- Come on, son.
Wait! You can't see 'cause of the mud!
Four white socks.
All right, break it up!
Clear off, the lot of ya!
You see, sir? He's not random at all.
We'll attend to your horse.
Patch him up best we can.
Treat him like the soldier he is.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
It falls on me to give you some important news.
At 11:00 today, in two minutes' time, the war will come to an end.
The King and Queen thank you for your service.
We have been victorious, even if it's a higher price than many of us might have imagined.
When the bells ring out, and they will in a moment, for the first time in four years, let us remember our brothers fallen in the field, and thank God for the end of this struggle, and victory.
I don't understand, sir.
Officers' horses only. All other horses are to be auctioned immediately.
That is a complete and bloody outrage.
It's the lad's horse, sir! From Devon.
He raised him up from a pup, he did.
Trained him right up to the day when the army came to town!
These aren't my orders, Sergeant.
You'll have to take him to market tomorrow.
That's all.
We've all clubbed together.
It's everything we have.
There's 29 pounds there. Buy him back.
Does the Major know?
The Major put in 10. Mum's the word where the Major's concerned.
Your friend, on the crutches over there, even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse, so that he could go back with the others.
Come on, Narracott, get a move on.
We don't want to miss the show.

And if you bid against me again,
I will sell my farm, and bid to a thousand!

Going, going.
Gone!
Sir.
I'll give you all your money, everything you paid, when we get back to England.
- I'll give you twice what...
- You don't know anything about him.
But you're wrong, sir. I know everything.
Yes, you found him.
I heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies.
No, I found him. He raised him.
When I heard about the miracle horse,
I traveled three days because I knew whose horse he was.
My granddaughter's.
She saved his life.
He was everything to her.
Where is your granddaughter?
The war has taken everything from everyone.
He is all that I have left of her.
Don't be worried, boy, when I go.
I won't worry over you none.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
And you found me.
And we'll both...
We'll both know that we made it through.
Now come on.
We're the lucky ones.
Always have been.
Lucky since the day I met you.
God be with you, sir.
Do you know what this is?
That's my father's.
That's his regimental pennant.
How did you come by this, sir?
You may have this.
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.
And this.
- Sir, I...
- No, no, no.
Not necessary. He belongs to you.
That is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted.
And she was the boss.
What was her name?
Emilie.
Her name is Emilie.

Nathaniel Burrows, welcome back.
There you go.
My name is Lieutenant Conti, and I have with me a letter from our division commander.
<font color="#D900D9">(PAPER RUSTLING)</font>
It's of highest importance.
"No words could express how grateful we are for what you and your squad were able to accomplish, given the circumstances.
Today, we are truly in the company of heroes."
Now, the device that you brought back, that was the very definition of priceless.
And I promise you this:
History will prove that it was worth every life lost in its pursuit.
Now, that being said, none of what you did, or saw, or learned from the morning of the German bombardment to your return to this CP ever happened.
There'll be no medals, no commendations, no promotions.
You can't tell your family.
Hell, you can't even tell your preacher.
None of this happened.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Now on a personal note,
I had the distinct honor to serve with your father in France under General Pershing.
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>
He was a hell of a man.
So I've heard.
Can I go home, sir?
I'll make sure you're on the next truck out.
Thanks for your service, son.
Your father would be very proud of you.
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>
So tell me about these two girls back home.
<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>
Keep it going, bro.
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>
Well, my old Yankee Doodle, as a great man once said, all good things come to an end.
I knew that kid would make Valentine's Day.
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>
Before my father died, he said the worst thing about growing old was that other men stopped seeing you as dangerous.
I've always remembered that, how being dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor.
You live your life by a code, an ethos.
Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.
And, trust me, you're always trying to get home.
Authorities say the ring is centered in Costa Rica, with the primary export being... widely unknown if the war on drugs is connecting them... in the region have been known to retaliate using a...
25,000 troops... flying from the US to control that...
Can we get some ice cream?
- No, we gotta go.
- You always say no.
- Well, are you gonna buy?
- No, you buy.
OK, what are we getting today?
- Passion fruit.
- OK, passion fruit.
How about macadamia nut?
Claimed responsibility for the attack at the International School in Manila.
Your father was a reader
Churchill, of course, but also Faulkner and books about Tecumseh.
He loved artists who painted people with bodies that looked like boxes.
I 'd give him hell about that.
He'd just say,
"You gotta look harden".
Ambassador Margullies had long been a strong supporter of joint counter-terrorism operations conducted within this region.
Not one group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks on the International School.
- Here's your coffee, Rorke.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- How's it going?
- Hey, you want the usual?
- Sounds good, thank you.
- You're late again, Dave.
I didn't say anything.
What do you got going on over here?
- Are you serious, man?
- We're not telling anyone yet.
You a little nervous, though?
Last time I checked, they don't come with directions.
Yeah, tell me about it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
My man here is having a baby.
Hey, congratulations.
Hey, everybody,
Rorke's having a baby.
Congratulations, Rorke!
- What did I just say?
- Don't worry about it, man.
You're gonna be awesome. I'm so excited for you, man. You're gonna be a good dad.
Hey, tomorrow Jackie and I are heading down to the beach.
Bring Sandy and the kids.
I'll bring an extra board for you.
- You know I don't surf.
- I know you don't surf, but it'll be good
- to get the families together.
- All right.
But now that you've told everyone in the bar, try and contain yourself tomorrow.
I will try.
"Look harder" your father would say.
I always knew he wasn't just talking about those boxy abstract paintings.
There's threats everywhere, and the world is draped in camouflage.
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?
Whatever you say, Boss.
How was the ride?
I left Colombia this morning.
- Colombia to here in one day?
- Piece of cake.
Anyway, estimates say that Christo is worth
- close to a billion.
- That's with a "B"?
Yeah, and he gives back a lot to this community over here with medical clinics, schools, political donations, you name it, so this is the deal:
They are extremely loyal to him over here.
When did the DEA hand him over to us?
When they intercepted a 707 of his filled with Soviet weapons.
Listen, Langley says that the boys over at NSA, they found some interesting intercepts connecting Christo to a jihadist network out of Southeast Asia.
Apparently, Christo and one of the guys running the network, they're childhood friends.
Your father's grandfather gave up his life flying a B-24 in World War ll.
He kept the Liberator aloft just long enough for everyone to jump, and then he went down with the plane.
That's the blood that courses in your veins.
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- You want to come with me?
Did you feel how cold it is out there?
I'll tell you what, go hang out with Mommy for a little while, help out with the baby.
When I come back in, if you still want to go out, I'll take you out with me.
- Promise?
- I promise. Hurry up, go.
- What's going on, sir?
- What's up, brother?
Nothing much, man.
Now, I know you got the New York heritage, but this isn't exactly like sitting back in Staten Island.
You got to actually work hard to get through the surf.
- Yeah, I know.
- Twelve-plus years on the Teams, and you don't know how to do this?
Hey, wait till you have five kids, man.
You'll see how much time you got to play in the surf.
You ready to get in the drink or what?
All right, man, lead the way.
- All right, don't embarrass us.
- All right.
Your father was my Boss, and I was his Chief.
What we knew about each other strengthened our bond as operators.
There was a brotherhood between us, and we depended on each other more than a family.
Tecumseh said,
"Although a single twig will break, a bundle of twigs is strong."
OK, OK, gracias.
This is unbelievable.
I still can't believe you ordered Chinese in this place.
It's really good.
Double word score, 18 points.
- "Dumb"?
- Read it and weep, sugar.
I'll try not to.
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.
"Adumbrating," that's not even a word.
OK, first of all, it's pronounced "adumbrating," and it means pretending, foreshadowing.
Guess who's buying dinner tonight, sugar.
Fine.
In most cases, officers get tactical partners.
Langley sets me up with some son of SCRABBLE hustler.
SCRABBLE Yoda, OK?
Get it right.
- How much do I owe you?
- Nada.
Shit.
Our platoon was headed downrange.
We had Weimy, our sniper.
He grew up in the middle of the Mojave Desert.
Most excitement he found as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys down the aisle at the grocery store.
Ray, our comms guy, our radioman, he grew up in East LA gangland.
He had a Silver Star for pulling a wounded teammate out of the fray.
Sonny, he was made of granite.
This guy didn't even do push-ups
'cause he was afraid his chest was gonna get too big.
Ajay joined the Teams late in his 30s.
He'd been a Muay Thai fighter early in life.
Before that, he grew up dirt-poor in Trinidad.
Mikey had 20 years in the Teams.
But as humble as he was, you'd never even know it.
He kept a picture of his wife in his helmet and a lock of her hair in his pocket.
Quiet as the breeze.
And finally, Senior Chief
I couldn't really tell you much about him... other than I'd rather take a knife into a gunfight than have to be interrogated by him.
That last night at home, you think about how you could have been a better dad, a better husband.
That bedtime story you should have read or that anniversary you forgot.
You don't expect your family to understand what you're doing, you just hope they'll accept it.
When you get home, you hope you can pick up right where you left off.
What up?
- You putting the wild bunch down?
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Senior, you mind giving us a couple minutes, man?
- Nah, you got 'em, Jefe.
- Thanks.
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches in a given work-up or deployment, but... it's like Chief and I said right at the beginning of this platoon:
Once we step off on campaign, once this bird's ready and we're downrange, everything back home needs to be in balance.
We 're not gonna be worth a damn to each other or ourselves if we get over there and something's out of whack.
I mean, if things aren't right with the family, things aren't right with the finances or something's off;
It's gonna put us all out of balance, so we need to have that tight before we launch.
If somebody's got an issue, bring it up.
Chief can take care of it, I can take care of it. Everybody's got each other's back.
Let's make sure we lock that down so when we 're ready to roll, all our focus is on the mission.
For all those who have been downrange, to us and those like us, damn few.
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.
I still like the name James.
I'll think about it, if it's a boy.
Come here.
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, baby.
Hey, little one, you make sure you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.
I don't like that chain-smoking at all.
I got it, Lieutenant.
- OK.
- It's gonna be OK.
- All right.
- It's gonna be fine.
Try to Keep this as long as you can for a while, yeah?
Anything else, Commander?
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into your eyes when our first child is born.
You know I'll do my best.
I love you, baby.
Love you.
War is a country of will.
There's no room for sympathy.
If you're not willing to give up everything, you've already lost.
Tell me, what is it about you Americans that makes you feel entitled to fuck with the way I make my living?
I know who you are, Miss Morales, and I know who you work for.
So why don't you save us both some time and tell me exactly what you think you know?
How did that feel,
Miss Morales?
Have a great day at the spa.
MAN ON PHONE.' Si, jefe.
- Hey, fellas, what's up?
- Hey.
It's hotter than two rats screwing in a wool sock out there, yeah?
Africa-hot...
Tarzan couldn't take this heat.
Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.
Lights. Three days ago, two CIA agents, a Walter Ross and a Miss Lisa Morales, were ambushed inside their hotel room here in Costa Rica by a unknown amount of heavily armed assholes.
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered, and Miss Morales has been abducted.
We believe that this has been the work of a guy named Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.
LT's going to give you the skinny on him.
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.
This guy is believed to have been working cocaine-for-weapons deals between the Russian mafia, the FARC guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels ever since the late 1990s.
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link between our boy Christo and this guy Abu Shabal.
Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds, who has created us as Muslims and delivered us with the jihad on his direct path.
Peace be upon those who follow his direct path till the Day of Judgment.
Let me explain this to you Americans.
We are not separatists.
We Chechens are not a legal part of anyone, but you Americans are willingly or unwillingly assisting in the genocide of our people by demanding that we obey certain rules, and by your continued occupation of all Muslim countries.
With the grace of Allah, glorious and exalted is he,
America will never be safe until safety becomes a reality for us.
Allahu Akbar.
Abu Shabal is a Chechen terrorist who's associated with the Beslan School Massacre.
He's been jumping between training camps in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Now, the connection between Christo and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy, but if this was the lead that Morales was working on, it could be why she was abducted. Senior?
All right, this is a personnel recovery of Miss Morales.
All right, who's got questions?
Senior Chief, you got any updated source intel on numbers inside the camp, and what about roving patrols?
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't know anything about roving patrols.
You're just gonna have to assume that they're out there walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target are we looking at?
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers, so they can have anything from Soviet-bloc DShKs.
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match, so make sure you got a clear shot.
All right, what else?
Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?
There was a ton of blood on the scene, and a lot of it was Mr. Ross', we confirmed that.
Miss Morales may have bled there, too, but these guys are savages, so you're gonna have to assume that she is non-ambulatory, so you're gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.
Two minutes to drop.
Hey, LT.
You got to let us know who that guy is, so when we get back, we can kick his ass.
What guy?
The guy that gave you that fucked-up haircut.
- Fuck.
- Damn, Sonny, you should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.
That means my head shines like your gold teeth?
Don't be like that,
- that's harsh.
- Ramp!
Mask up.
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better than this right here is being a dad, except for that whole changing diaper thing, but...
Sandy does that for me anyway, so...
I'm actually looking forward to it.

I feel like we're pretty thin.
I'd like to take you guys with us.
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.
I got a Raven pushing my pos.
Weimy and I are in good overwatch position, and I got to keep reporting back to Blackbeard Main.
- We're staying here.
- Roger that.
- Keep it tight.
- Got it.

I have positive control of the Raven.

Driver's side, truck.
Got him.
Fuck.
- Come on.
- Go in! Go in!

Target is secure.
Stand by for confirmation of the package.
Be advised Mikey is down.
Mikey is down. Status to follow.
Roger. You have the package.
Chief, I got his cell phone.
LT? LT?
Chief, looks like you have two aggressor vehicles approaching from the north, about one mike out. You can take the truck outside the west door.
Meet us at extract.
Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.
I just need to ask you a few questions.
What's your mother's maiden name?
Rosales.
What street you were born on?
Hot Springs.
All right. Just hang on.
Whiplash, we have enemy QRF approaching from the north.
Roger. You have enemy QRF coming in from the north.
Chief, you need to start your exfil now.
- We 'll meet you at secondary extract.
- Roger that.
Hey, boys, we gotta roll!
Shit. Sir, it's those trucks,
- about 1,000 yards.
- Yep.
Ma'am, I'm taking you out right now.
Hey, Chief, he took a round to the eye with the exit wound behind the ear.
He's alive, but we gotta get moving now!
Weimy, coming out.
We'll meet you at the rally point.
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!
- Heads up! Fast movement on the left!
- Right turn! Right turn!
Hey, man, we're not going to make it to secondary extract.
I got to find us a route.
Stay on this road.
- Left, left, left.
- Left turn! Left turn!
Mikey, come on, buddy.
Hey, Chief!
We're not gonna make secondary extract!
- You're gonna have to figure it out, man!
- Hold on!
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Stay with us.
Come on, Mike. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on, man.
- Contact!
- Pick it up, pick it up.
Yo, Chief!
We can make it to rally point!
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!
- Come on, man.
LT, LT, this is assault team.
We just lost the secondary extract.
I say again, we just lost secondary extract.
Moving to rally point.
How copy, over?
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.
One click out!
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!
- Good?
- Backstage clear.
Rocket out!
He's not breathing!
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!
Chief, let me get your M-4!
Sir, what's the status on those boats?
I lost Whiplash on the run.
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!
Contact rear!
Holy shit!
Taking rounds in...
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.
Moving to tertiary extract.
I have eight packs, seven Sierras, one package.
Package with multiple wounds.
The Sierra has gunshot wound to the head.
This will be a hot extract.
What the fuck?!
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!
- Keep him down, man!
- Where the fuck am I?!
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.
We're almost out of here.
Mikey!
- Hang on, buddy.
- Where are we?
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.
You're a hard motherfucker.
- Did we get her?
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.
Water! Water! Water!
Going in! Going in!
I got her! I got her!
It's fucking going under.
Out! Get the fuck out!
It wasn't for nothing.
You know, from time to time,
I get to see my old friends from my old life.
And it's always, always disappointing.
Some become assholes, other boring, and I can't believe I tried to get them in bed all those years ago.
Hey.
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.
- That's not my name.
- I know.
Mohammed Abu Shabal, the son of Shabal.
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.
Things change.
Yeah, things have changed.
That's why this is the last time we might have to see each other for quite some time.
For I might have to find a hole to hide in.
I don't understand.
I'm being watched by the CIA, and I'm not taking any chances.
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,
I'm taking my family south.
I neither have the energy or the will to fight the Americans.
What about our deal, Mikhail?
My men have been training for almost a year now.
- I have devoted much of my resources...
- The deal stands, Yuri.
Just because I've taken early retirement does not mean
I'm not holding up my end of the bargain.
There is so much to be done.
And it will be, just without me.
You'll have to use my trusted associates.
That's not so good for me.
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!
Shut up!
Stop your fucking bullshit!
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.
What... What is that?
What is that?
Do you know what I do to get here?!
Do you know the men who I've had to sacrifice to get here?!
Do you have any idea?!
No, you shit! You live up here in this ivory tower!
You have no... You don't care!
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?
He's definitely gonna lose the eye, but he's... he's hanging tough.
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.
Great job smoke-checking those assholes and getting Morales back.
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta tell you what, that was solid work.
So, Chief, you make sure you get that down to the boys right away.
- You hear me?
- Check.
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick, but she should've gotten the stuff up the chain a lot faster because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.
How is that? I thought this was a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone that you guys picked up in that shithole.
It turned me on to something that just does not look right at all.
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer than I thought they were, and Shabal is a wild card, man.
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't give a rat's ass about money or drugs.
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.
Shabal wants to kill Americans.
Christo knows how to get fuckers inside America.
This could be big trouble in little China, fellas.
They're gonna hit us at home.
I just got done talking to the boss and the Spec Ops Task Force, and this is what's gonna go down.
I need Ajay and Ray standing by to launch for an SR in two hours.
They're gonna get some frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.
Why Africa?
We pinned an airfield there with that phone that you got, and I think that Shabal is gonna be there doing a weapons transfer on his way west.
When you say "west," what are we talking about, Mexico west?
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.
You two and the rest of the platoon are gonna stay here on standby.
You'll be the primary assault force in case something goes down anywhere near America.
- Check.
- Check.
You gonna be around for any questions as they come up?
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.
So I'm gonna link up with SEAL Team Four, and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific.
So it's straight up Mai Tais and palm trees for me, baby.
Yeah, brother. Go get him.
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.
The important people to who? You?
I guess so.
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.
Hey, brother, I've never written one of these before.
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.
But, to be honest with you,
I was thinking of calling the command and trying to get you home.
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.
You remember our last cruise to Al Anbar?
- Yeah.
- When you had that final turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?
I was laying in bed and I realized the only thing I needed to do now was go home.
But if something went south on your op,
I would always regret not being there with you.
I appreciate you taking care of me big-time, Dave, but I'm working some things with the brass.
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.
Well, I hope it works out either way. I really do.
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper, and I'm gonna make it into a nice paper airplane.
Beat it.
We're good, we're good!
Chief of the Watch, submerge the ship to one-six-zero feet.
Dive. Dive.
Scope down.
All doors are green.
- Oh, good. Hey, guys.
- Sir.
- Thank you for getting here so fast.
- Sure.
- Grab a seat, please.
- Thank you.
You'll have Bulldog overhead.
We need you to get in, grab the intel and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.
What if the meeting doesn't take place as scheduled?
How long do you want us to stay on target?
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan on being out there for a while.
- Check.
- Are we good?
- Think so, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Ray and Ajay are rigged up and ready to check each other out.
Garage door clear.
- You got a visual?
- Yeah.
Got three trucks moving in.
A fuel truck, two jeeps, some skinnies in the back.
One of them has a .50-cal.
You hear that.
- Yeah, I think that's our plane.
- Yeah, we got some inbound.
'Bout time these guys showed up.
Jesus. Let me get my camera.
Hey, Ray, we got two birds down at the end of the field, southeast our pos, no tail IDs.
- You got that?
- Check, no tail IDs.
Ray, last time I checked, we were in Africa, right?
Yeah. Why, what's up?
Dude, there's, like,
16 Filipinos down there, all praying to Mecca right now.
- Filipinos?
- Filipinos. Definitely not skinnies.
I'm picking up the praying.
I'm also picking up some Russian.
Bulldog, Bulldog, Redrum, radio check, over.
- MAN OVER RADIO.' Good check, copy.
- Roger, good check.
Be advised, we got two sterile aircraft departing to the east from following location:
Ten, Papa, Lima, Sierra.
Ten, Papa, Lima, Sierra.
Please advise when tally target, over.
Roger
Copy, two aircraft, location Ten, Papa...
Hey, Chief, you are not gonna believe this.
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged just landed on Cedros Island off the coast of Mexico.
It has Shabal on it with an unknown number of jihadis.
Are you kidding me?
No, looks like we're gonna get to hit that target.
Well, Senior and the SWCC boats are punching out.
They should pull a little more intel for us, so we'll see.
All right.
I don't know how long we're staying.
Hold on, baby.
- Be safe.
- You know I will.
- I gotta go, honey,
- I love you.
I love you.
Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out.
Bravo, you have a Tango on your starboard side.
Tango on the starboard side.
Whiskey Charlie, we have a visual on Tango.
Bravo, you have a Viper at twelve o'clock.
Get down! Get down!
Clear! Bridge secure.
Senior, you're clean.
- English OK? Let's do that.
- English is fine.
Can you cut him loose, please?
If you get cut loose, you're not gonna do anything crazy, are you?
A Crazy Ivan? Soto speak.
So you're Russian, yeah?
- Yes, I am.
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.
- I'm Otto.
- Otto.
- Yes. And you are?
- Nice to meet you.
Christo.
- Crisco?
- Christo.
Troskawicz?
So how long am I gonna need to keep busting your balls about getting one of those patches?
Yeah, I think it was, like, a one-time deal, man.
After 9/11, my uncle sent a bunch out for the platoon, but, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.
No, no, I'm not gonna take your family crest.
All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you putting something in your cargo pocket the other day.
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying something in that pocket right there.
What is it?
That's my grandfather's flag.
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me, and now I'm gonna give it to my boy someday.
All right. I like that.
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.
- I believe it's called Starship.
- "Starship,"
I love the way you say Starship.
It's like Russian.
That guy... Star Trek.
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.
- I wouldn't Know.
- Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.
So here's the problem, pal.
You're worth a lot of money.
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.
- You do?
- Yes.
All right. Let me tell you how the world works there, Crisco.
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
It's OK.
Let me tell you how the world really works.
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.
Since I walked through that door, you're not the same guy you used to be.
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that, nothing I can do to help you right now, unless you let me help you.
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.
So how is it that you're working with these jihadi folks, then?
You're Jewish, right?
Shabal is what?
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer, or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.
And then you went on your separate ways, and then some years later, you meet up.
And you totally didn't recognize the person.
And that's what happened with Shabal.
We share a common interest.
So he came up with this incredible idea because of his beliefs.
I don't necessarily share his beliefs, but he's a smart guy.
You know, it's almost like... you know, it's almost like... like this is me.
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?
Yeah.
Cool concept, no?
- Right here?
- Yes.
You think this is some kind of game?
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?
MAN OVER RADIO.' Blackbeard Actual, this is Blackbeard Main.
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.
Report to Tri-Hull.
You're clear to move on target Alpha.
Roger, Main. Clear to target.
The only people
I answer to is my family.
To my wife and to my child.
And nobody else.
- Running late somewhere?
- Shit filter's full.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So here's the problem, pal.
You do love your family, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?
What about my daughter?
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?
Every minute of my life.
I wanted you to see that so that you'd think about some things very seriously, because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere.
You'll be treated properly and humanely.
That girl is gonna grow up, and she's gonna get married, and your wife is gonna find someone else, and you're gonna miss everything.
If I had done something that would endanger my family,
I would feel just like you do right now.
You promise not to touch my family?
I would never touch your family.
I would not.
Are you familiar with... ceramic ball bearings?
No.
Just imagine 16 suicide vests filled with those ceramic ball bearings, slipping by every metal detector and every checkpoint in your country.
You think your economy is fucked now?
Just think what the media is gonna do with this.
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fucking walk in the park.
The grand Central Park.
So you're telling me... there's 16 jihadis wearing suicide vests.
They're gonna walk right across the border.
So where are they going?
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...
You pick a city, they'll be there.
- And this is happening now?
- It's happening as we speak.
Sorry, what?
It's happening as we speak.
How can you stop this?
I can't.
Blackbeard Lead, containment element is set.
Roger.
Gun! Gun! Gun!
Clear!
- Go.
- Coming out!
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in contact, midtown, south of the church.
Contact!
Contact!
Changing!
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?
Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.
Go in hot.
Frag out!
Weimy, I've got two squilters heading south in a pickup truck.
I see 'em.
Hit those two guys in the truck.
Rocket!
Frag out!
Sir? Sir?
LT? You all right?
Damn.
You check that box?
Yeah.
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.
Yeah.
Jesus.
This is not some bush-league vest from an Iraqi hut.
This is some high-speed shit.
Maybe we should put this somewhere else?
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere to put this, would you?
Target secure. Set security.
One's to the north, three south.
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.
WOMAN OVER RADIO.' Actual, mission not complete. Stand by for follow-on.
You only got half that jihadist cell.
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.
Now, listen, the other half of that cell is gonna be crossing the border using a tunnel network from Mexicali at 0700.
We're coordinating with State, but for now the birds will drop you off outside the city where your POC is a Commander Pedros.
I 'll give you more details en route.
- Actual, how do you copy?
- Roger, Main.
OK, we've got a helo landing on the deck, we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.
They're gonna help infil us to the target and join us on the assault.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.
All right.
And the rest of the boys, how are they getting back to the ship?
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station.
They're gonna send in a Marine element to help exploit the target.
When they're done, the boys will pull off with them.
OK. I'm thinking Squad One and myself roll out.
Perfect. Squad Two stays here, buttons it up,
- pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.
We're moving north of here through town, and crossing at sunrise.
The other group will get into Texas the following day, through Juarez.
Comprendes?
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot to go to Mexicali anyway?
This one's going all the way up the flagpole.
State Department's on it.
Hey, sir. Channel two.
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,
Jackie's gonna be squeezing that kid out on her own.
However, we hit this target quick enough, you jump on a burro and ride that shit home.
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.
Did you get your two weeks?
All that time I was spending on the sat phone, it wasn't to convince them to let me go home, it was to convince them to leave your ass in charge.
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.
Seems our governments have been very busy to make this possible?
All the way to the top, from what I hear.
There is something that you have to understand.
My superiors, they're very fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.
No Black Hawk Down is what they're saying, so we do need to stay under the radar.
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.
Your team's presence here is greatly appreciated, but we are out of time.
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.
Help piece this together for me.
- OK.
- Our intel says they're using a tunnel network that is under a milk factory.
This mean anything to you?
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.
Then that's where we're going.
Of all of the places in Mexicali that you could have picked, this is probably the worst.
The cartels control that area from all angles.
They have us heavily outgunned.
Simply reaching your target is gonna be very difficult.
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals heading to our country.
Needless to say, they are no big fan of ours.
If they are at that factory, that's where we're going.
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go, but prepare your men for a bigger fight than what you had imagined.
You're not fighting eight men. You're also fighting the cartel that's protecting them.
If your targets make it into those tunnels, they'll disappear like ghosts.
You enter the tunnels right here.
You will walk seven miles to this fork.
My men will tell you what tunnel to take.
Once you get to this point, my job is done.
You're on your own.
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.
One mike out from the south entrance.
Jefe! On the roof!
We gotta go. Now.
Sir! Leave two men here!
Weimy!
Weimy!
I need you to lock this shit down!
Frag out!
On me.
You guys got the gate!
Call! You're going to the front door!
Go!
Call!
Changing!
Bomb!
Damn it, sir.
How you gonna explain that one to my family?
Get back there so I don't have to?
Clear!
Grenade!
LT!
Chief, I got him.
Keep going. I'll cover you.
Chief.
Chief!
Assault Two, this is Assault One.
Be advised, tunnel is secure and all threats are neutralized.
LT and Chief are down.
I say again,
LT and Chief are down,
Your father was a good man.
Growing up without him is gonna be hard.
It's gonna hurt.
You'll feel alone, out to sea, with no shore in sight.
You'll wooden
"Why me? Why him?"
Remember, you have warrior's blood in your veins.
The code that made your father who he was is the same code that'll make you a man he would admire, respect.
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.
Like those people in the paintings your father liked, we are men made up of boxes, chambers of loss and triumph, of hurt and hope and love.
- No one is stronger or more dangerous...
- Ready!
- ...Than a man who can harness emotions.
- Aim!
His past.
Aim!
Aim!
Use it as fuel, as ammunition, as ink to write the most important letter of your life.
On behalf of the President of the United States and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag in recognition of your husband's heroic achievements.
You have my deepest condolences.
One more flag to present.
This one I think you know.
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.
Again, my deepest condolences.
Lieutenant Engel!
Lieutenant Engel!
Before he died, your father asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh.
I told him I 'd fold it into a paper airplane.
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing, sailing it from him to you.
Live your life that the fear of death.
Can never enter your heart.
Trouble no one about his religion.
Respect others and their views.
And demand they respect yours.
Love your life, perfect your life.
Beautify all things in your life.
RORKE.' Seek to make your life long and of service to your people.
When your time comes to die.
Be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death.
So that when their time comes they weep and pray.
For a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.
Sing your death song.
And die like a hero going home.
AH I saw was smoke and fire
I didn't feel a thing.
But suddenly I was rising higher.
And I felt like I just made.
The biggest mistake.
When I thought about my unborn child.
And when I thought about my wife.
And the answer rang out clear.
From somewhere up above.
No greater gift has man.
Than to lay down his life for love.
And I wonder.
Would I give my life?
Could I make that sacrifice?
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet?
I would Yes, I would.
For you.
Maybe you don't understand
I don't understand it all myself.
But there's a brother on my left and another on my right.
And in his pocket just like mine.
He's got a photograph.
And they're waiting for him back home.
And it's weighing on my mind
I'm not trying to be a hero
I don't wanna die.
But right now in this moment.
You don't think twice
I wonder Would I give my life?
Could I make that sacrifice?
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet?
I would Yes, I would.
You don't think about right.
You don't think about wrong.
You just do what you gotta do.
To defend your own.
And I'd do the same.
For you Yes, I would.
Yes, I would
I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice.
'Cause if it came down to it.
Could I take a bullet? I would.
Yes, I would
I'd do it for you.
Yeah
I'd do it for you.
Oh.
Take the bullet.
Yeah.
Yes, I would
Daddy!
Yes, Messaoud?
-The gendarmes!
-Where?
Oh, my God...
Said, stay close to me.
Good morning.
I have a court order.
This land belongs to Mr.
Guerini, your neighbour.
Mr Caid, this earth, I inherited it from my ancestors.
-Do you have a document of ownership?
-What document?
We've never had one.
-Without a document, there's nothing I can do.
You have to leave.
Impossible.
I was born on this land.
My father was born here.
My grandfather, my ancestors...
My children have grown up here!
You have three days to leave.
If I leave my land, how should I feed my children?
-It's the law, I can't do anything about it.
Have they gone mad?
We're chasing a piece of paper.
I will die and be buried here!
It's not fair!
It's a sin, what you're doing.
God damn you!
-Do not cry Mama, we will return.
It's nothing.
Go help your father, Said. Go.
-School is over.
-What?
Leave school?
I am among the best students.
This is not fair.
-How should I pay for it?
Remember that this land is ours.
It saw you being born and grow up.
Today, we hunt.
May God punish them.
Free Algeria!
Equal rights!
Free Algeria!
Equal rights!
-Come on forward.
-I have my match.
-Germany has lost.
We will win our freedom.
-Me, I earn my living.
-Said!
Remove the djellaba.
Come here, you.
Take good care, and don't be afraid.
Listen carefully.
If you lose, you shall not eat tonight.
Halim! Halim!
Equal Rights!
Dodge!
That gives!
Let go!
Take off your hand!
Don't do that! Stop!
Hide.
-Open, open!
The door!
Let me in.
Hide this.
Fire!
Now, go back home.
And most importantly, hide.
Is that clear?
Don't go out.
Save yourself!
Wait.
Save yourself!
Hands up!
Get out. Go.
Go!
Come on!
-Faster.
Daddy!
Dad!
Dad? Dad?
Get up, Dad.
Dad.
No, Dad, don't die.
Dad...
They're dead.
May God rest their souls.
May he give me strength and patience.
May he welcome them into his vast paradise.
My dear Messaoud
I hope my letter finds you alive.
I hope that this war in Indochina will end soon.
Your brother Abdelkader is in prison in France.
It has now been 8 years that
I haven't seen you.
Fortunately your brother,
Said, is always by my side.
This morning, we prayed at the tomb of your father and your sisters.
What is it?
My mother.
May God bless you, my very dear son.
Mr. Caid?
Mr. Caid.
What are you doing here?
I just came to say hello.
How did you get in?
I have a gift for you.
What's this gift?
Die!
I've come to avenge my father and my entire family.
Filthy dog.
Die, you filthy dog.
For everything you did.
Pack your things.
-Why?
We're going to France.
-I don't want to.
-We're at war.
They will kill us.
-If you think I am alive, you're wrong.
I'm already dead.
They've killed us.
Listen
Listen carefully.
Abdelkader is in jail.
He's alone in France.
He needs help.
-And Messaoud?
-He will join us, he's a soldier.
-In France?
-Sure.
God willing, we will all return here to our land, in our country.
But not to this foxhole.
I'll tell you... when I'm sure to find my children,
I'll follow you anywhere.
God will hear you.
My brothers,
I bid you farewell.
They're taking me.
Greet Algeria.
Greet my country.
Long live Algeria!
Come on.
In the name of the
French Republic,
I command the execution.
- The Vietnamese people broke the chains that had weighed on them for a century for their country to be independent.
Otmani...
Don't fall asleep.
Don't sleep.
-Colonial France is not invincible.
Don't give in to any illusions.
It's over, for your friend.
- The members of the oppressed nations must mobilise all their forces, and be willing to sacrifice their lives and their property to wrest from the colonial forces their right to be independent.
You, from African colonies, take for example the successful fight of the Vietnamese people.
Your brothers, your wives, your children deserve justice and freedom!
Fighters, don't be slaves sacrificed by the colonisers anymore.
See our victory and break your chain.
Here it is.
Come in.
Come on, Mum. Go in.
Thank you.
Listen, I have no money for now...
As soon as I find work...
I'll pay you.
Take this watch as security.
It is expensive.
It's good, it'll do.
-Don't worry, mum, it's temporary.
Thank God.
It's better than nothing.
At least we have a roof.
My brother...
Where are you going?
To work for Renault.
They're hiring.
What do you say?
Thanks.
Salaam aleikoum.
Salaam.
-May I sit down?
-Please.
-What can one buy with this?
-With that?
You can buy a house... and get married.
It can even buy you money.
You're new here?
I'm from Setif.
-From Setif?
Welcome, my brother.
Watch your things.
Think about marriage.
Sir...
Sir?
Hey, sir!
What's it like to live here?
You can be a slave for Renault.
-What do you do?
-Me?
I'm different.
-Teach me.
-For a guy like you that's a long way.
Forget it.
Excuse me...
Nothing is too hard for me.
I can surprise you.
Surprise me?
Come on.
Go.
Mum!
Are you okay?
I thank God.
Did you eat well?
Looks like you got thinner.
Don't worry about me.
-Listen closely to what I have to say.
You didn't steal.
You didn't kill.
You're not a criminal.
You're in jail for your ideas.
You are a man.
Everything has an end.
Soon, I will get out.
We'll be together.
If God wills it before you die and be buried by your side.
Fear not, my son.
Be a man.
Your son is a fighter.
Here comes the warden.
I'll leave you.
Remember what I said.
Be a man.
Abdelkader.
By taking care of you, you are taking care of me.
May God be with you.
May God bless you.
God bless you.
-That's her?
-Yes. That's her.
-Have you talked to her?
-Yes.
What did you tell her?
Good.
We're there.
Is that right, Bigalle?
-Pigalle.
Not with a B. With a P.
Otherwise, they'll laugh at you.
Come with me.
Sit down over there.
It will be your place.
Understood? And tomorrow, we share the money.
Good...
Go. Thank you.
Thanks.
Wait. Listen carefully.
One whore, not bad.
Two whores...
You're doing.
I'm hungry.
Yes, come on.
Good morning.
How did you do?
I will return the rest tonight.
Okay.
Take it, buy yourself some clothes.
-Even if I had to stay naked all my life
I wouldn't want your money.
God is my witness.
Zohra...
It's for my mother.
Don't tell her it's from me.
Said?
Messaoud?
My brother?
Messaoud!
Messaoud, my brother!
Where have you been, where were you?
You have become a man.
What else?
Come and see!
My son, my treasure!
I missed you.
And you, my son!
You've become a man.
You've lost weight.
He's a commander! Fantastic!
Your eyes...
-What's happened to them?
-That's war.
-Soon, Abdelkader will be out of jail.
You are the eldest.
You have to take care of the family.
I would have liked you to see your Dad before he died.
There's a girl right here, pleasant, intelligent.
If you like her, it relies on God.
Where's she from?
From our corner, just like us.
If God wills it.
If God wills it.
Abdelkader.
I have to talk to you.
You know, Ho Chi Minh... won the war against France thanks to two principles.
The first principle is that oppression always has its benefits to the cause of the people who want to liberate themselves.
The second principle, is to never, ever abandon a mission.
Nothing is insurmountable.
All Algerians, all of them must pay their toll for revolution.
Within two days, you will be free.
You must lead all
Algerians from the suburbs and also here in Paris.
-How?
You convince anyone.
??Him entrane 3 which entranent 6.
??The six entranent in ten.
I'll give you an address.
And remember it well.
You'll deliver your reports there and receive orders.
Okay?
-Count on me.
I will not betray the Algerians.
Let me, ma'am.
Abdelkader!
My life, my treasure, you're finally here!
I thank God.
Come my heart, let's go home.
-How are you, Mum?
-Good.
There it is.
Enjoy your meal.
And welcome.
This is the 1st time I'm eating meat.
I swear.
-He's kidding.
Said, I'm your brothers witness.
The neighbours show me the finger.
They say you're a villain.
Listen!
Mum was right.
If you're a villain, nobody respects you.
Bandit?
Who's the villain? Me?
In this country, either you have money, or you are worth nothing.
Your brother is free.
-I'll be free when my country will be.
We need to be free.
And everything needs to change.
What are you talking about?
With these workers?
Listen, now we're three.
Tomorrow we will rally the entire slum.
He's right.
Think of the victory of the Vietnamese.
They were more armed than them, it was useless.
They could have stayed
15 or 20 years.
They would have won.
The revolution is on.
Nothing will stop it.
Listen
I have thought it through.
I know how to make money.
It's easy. Listen to me.
You've been to Indochina.
You know the weapons.
You were in prison, you have become tough.
Three of us, we will scare anyone.
We will not stay in this misery for all our lives.
We will make our law.
Juror.
He must choose.
Whose side are you on?
Your brothers' or their enemy's?
My brothers?
That's you. Them, I don't know.
I'm not supporting the enemy.
Are you with me?
Messaoud?
Good luck.
I left the army.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
Zohra, bring the cake.
Now, block them.
Stop, wait.
My brothers. Listen.
Between the fighting and dying in this country.
You must join the FLN.
The FLN is for an armed struggle.
The FLN controls everything.
It hides in the underground.
The revolution, it's it.
The dialogue leads nowhere.
The French fake the elections.
No politics here.
Wake up.
Wake up, my brothers!
Remember! FLN!
-FLN!
-FLN!
The French fake the elections.
FLN!
-That's enough.
This morning, we were two.
And like this, we will always stay two.
Look at these pages, they are empty.
We will get there.
Patience.
-What are you looking at?
-You.
Why did you switch it off?
I'm talking to you!
All of you
Listen to me.
We must bring the war here.
Join the party that promotes armed struggle.
Listen, you.
The only legitimate party is the MNA.
Got it?
You're mistaken, my friend.
THE MNA will go nowhere.
The MNA has confidence in elections.
The French give us one vote against 10 for the settlers.
They tamper with elections.
It is through armed struggle that we will win.
Abdelkader!
Out!
Put him there.
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
So, you're FLN?
I want to hear you say:
Long live the MNA.
So, you're going to say:
Long live the MNA.
I want to hear it.
Teach him some manners.
Are you gonna say it or not?
??That way, you make the devil?
I'll show you.
Look at me carefully.
Are you ready to die?
Nobody will help you.
Get up!
I'll tell you one thing.
Don't ever set your foot in here again.
As long as I'm alive, there will be no FLN.
The boss, that's me.
You're lucky.
Next time you're dead.
Shut the door.
You have nothing?
No, okay. And you?
Okay.
They tapped you.
-It's okay.
It's nothing.
What are we gonna do?
Hey, brothers?
What do you want?
I'm on your side.
The FLN is right.
I received a letter from the government.
The FLN has gone underground.
I'm with you.
You know him?
No.
But we won one.
Hey.
You'll kill yourself with this.
Get out. Get out, sir.
You too, get out.
Quickly. You too.
Just like that, you're back.
You're not scared, you.
-"The accused denies the authority of the FLN,
-he publicly denies the necessity for armed struggle.
On behalf of the revolution,
-the accused is sentenced to death."
Sit down!
You've come in a great number.
Only, you wouldn't dare.
Go ahead.
Give me a and hold him.
Long live the MNA!
Cowards!
Son of a...
"The sentence was executed today at 3 pm."
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Colonel Faivre, DST.
This is my home here.
I make decisions.
The gooks will pay.
We'll go to the slum.
It's a battle
FLN - MNA.
You will get killed.
It should calm things down!
Congratulations, my brother.
Come on, you too.
I embrace you.
All my wishes of happiness.
-Police!
-Police, open up!
Get everyone out.
Police! Come here!
Police!
Police!
Outside, go!
My brother...
It's the police!
I have to go, sorry.
The police. We must go.
Don't move! Stop!
Police!
Go, police.
Go, turn around.
-Lift your arms.
-This is marriage.
Go, go!
Turn around.
Hurry! ??It drags it!
-I want ten.
-Turn around.
Take them.
Come here!
Go ahead!
Where are you going, you?
Catch him!
Quick!
Follow me! Come!
He must go! Hurry!
Where did you learn to fight?
-A gift from God.
-Really?
You want to work?
It's your lucky day. Run.
Did you know they would come?
You knew. The leader of the MNA.
You had everything planned?
Come on.
-For how long will you support this?
What do you expect?
That they'll burn your homes?
They don't respect anyone.
Neither your wives, nor your children.
You can change that.
It's your move.
You must prepare against these humiliations.
Do you understand?
Tobacco and alcohol are prohibited.
Paying taxes to France, that's collaborating.
You, advance. Your name?
Ali Benjbour.
I swear to devote my life to my country from this moment and until my death.
I congratulate you.
Advance.
Nordine-Salhi.
I swear to devote my life to my country until my death.
Thanks.
We helped you.
You got your place with Pigalle.
-That is true.
-You are associated in a cabaret.
Everything has to fund our cause.
You've given your word.
-I know.
I have not forgotten.
But you didn't speak to the Corsicans.
They've given me only 5 %.
What can I do?
Hadn't you said 15 %?
Listen, it's not very complicated.
I give you a part of the cabaret.
I want half.
-Half?
-Yes.
-Which half?
-What?
-Are you really serious?
And how am I supposed to live?
Said?
There's no discussion.
I said half.
You, advance.
Mum, do me a favour.
Agree to see Said, he needs it.
-I don't want that.
-Don't be stubborn.
It's your son. He's changed.
Take care of your wife instead.
She will give birth soon.
-It's Omar who stole the contributions.
-He has children.
A warning...
No, no and no!
Discipline.
No warning!
-When i was a prisoner,
I thought that if I got out,
I would never kill again.
-It only takes one disobedience or betrayal
I'm with you.
-I stole to buy a refrigerator.
It's not for me.
It's for children.
I'll sell it.
It's yours, take it.
It was me who wanted the fridge.
Forgive him.
I'm begging you.
-Don't be afraid.
I won't do it again.
Give me a second chance.
I have 3 children.
I won't do it again, I promise you.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Is everything okay?
-Are you alone?
-Yes.
-Come in.
Factories will explode all over France at the same time.
Without killing or injuring a civilian.
Do you understand?
-We will fight France on its territory.
He must find weapons and teach your men to use them.
The French want control.
We have to be ready.
-Organising a zone, that I can do.
But I don't know anything about weapons.
-The factory, to you, is over.
And the slums too.
You go into hiding.
I will make you false papers.
Okay.
You can go.
-Who's there?
-The white Algerian.
Come in.
Give me that.
That's 25 million.
Be careful.
There. Hold.
I'll accompany you.
-Thanks.
-It that a French serving the revolution?
Go ahead.
-That she drinks anything.
-Close the door.
Wait.
Go ahead.
It could be something else...
-It's a matter of Algerians.
It's their revolution.
I want to be involved more.
We do what they ask us to do.
That was fast. The money goes to
Switzerland tonight.
Messaoud, my brother!
Welcome.
So, are you all right?
-Yes, all right.
-Come on.
Make yourself comfortable.
-Request the envelope from Vincent.
-Yes.
So what do you say?
Account.
Okay.
Listen...
I've called it "The Casbah".
It's not a place for you.
You want to see my real place?
It's through there.
You'll see.
Welcome.
You have gained weight.
I don't recognise you anymore.
I took it out of the street.
Him this is my future.
I found him in the slum.
One day this guy...
He will be champion. You'll see!
What's his name?
I don't know yet.
I haven't found out.
He's the first Algerian who will knock out the whites and blacks.
If God wills it.
If God wills it. What do you think?
It's Said.
I'm proud of you.
Messaoud
Forget the war.
Come work with me.
I must go.
Said?
No Smoking.
You know it's prohibited.
Messaoud!
Where are you going with this war?
What did you watch me? Boxing!
And you want my picture?
Boxing or leaving!
I leave you all l.
Here, the key.
You can come to the show tonight or tomorrow.
All my time is taken.
You can leave.
I'll come back.
Returning to France and Paris
where there have been reported
a series of attacks.
These events are irrefutable proof
the FLN was able to create in France
an organization to carry out terrorist acts.
The FLN, with raging despair,
attempts to halt the peace in Algeria.
The government must take the measure of risk
that the fanatics pose
to the French territory.
For Algiers, these attacks are related to the referendum.
The spokesman Gal Salan
declared yesterday:
We can only hope
That the police have sufficient resources to cope.
And this, Mr. Papon
will report in
Paris is talking about-, 19 h 15,
and the log 20 h.
-What do you know about the attacks?
Eh?
Nothing, of course.
The FLN, you know?
The poor workers like you know anything.
Where's Mustapha?
I want to speak with both of them.
Can you swim?
Can you swim?
-The repression prevents our operation.
The police will end up in the organization.
We must react quickly.
Eliminate the cops who torture.
Maintain the initiative, strike up what the enemy is on the nerves.
For every blow received, we will deliver ten.
Your men are ready?
Yes.
If you kill police officers, the repression will be terrible.
-Our violence will be profitable.
We must infiltrate the police.
Of Algerians with important positions.
Look, here's a list of names.
I will travel.
Cairo, Tunis, Morocco.
You'll replace me.
You shall take your orders in Germany.
You'll be the height.
I will, inch'alla.
I know I will not see the
Independent Appraisal.
But I would sacrifice my life.
Salaam.
There he is.
Look.
That's the commissioner, he kills and tortures our activists.
It's impossible to kill him in the street.
It's risky for civilians.
Must enter the office. How?
Look.
The Algerians.
Those who did the war in Indochina.
Him, I knew well.
Otmani Yasser.
We were prisoners together.
He owes me life.
Really?
We'll contact him.
Look Daddy, look.
Your name's Otmani-Yasser, not Alain.
You are Algerian.
You're a police officer.
-Where are you from?
What do you want?
Listen.
If the French arrest you, they'll put you in jail.
They will kill you maybe.
But not your wife or your children.
The revolution needs you.
You have always been a traitor.
Today, I have come to give you a chance.
Think carefully.
Go on, push.
Courage, pray to God.
Go on, push.
Courage, fear not.
What is it?
A boy.
I'm not going home.
I cannot see my wife.
I have no life.
I'm lost.
I warned you: no family.
You, you feel nothing.
Nothing.
You have no feeling.
Where is our conscience?
Our soul?
Abdelkader... Our soul.
Today is Said's fight.
We gotta go.
I have to work.
You're coming.
Why doesn't he leave the left side?
You're the champion.
Scrap his mouth!
Who's the champion?
Good!
Out!
-It is the greatest champion of all!
That's when your next game?
-The next fight, the championship of France!
The championship of France!
Said
Your boxer he will not make the championship.
Is that a joke?
-He will not box for the enemy.
-Are you crazy?
He lost his head or what?
Wait.
First, we take care of our revolution.
Boxing, afterwards.
The revolution, I serve too.
If he wins, then Algeria wins.
Imagine, an Algerian
France champion!
This will be a great day. -No!
When an Algerian will be champion it shall be for Algeria.
-Your boxer should fight for Algeria.
Let the sport out of it!
No personal passions!
The whole person must be devoted to the party!
The cause is just!
Get it?
Why are you yelling?
This fight, I will.
Tell your party.
You've taken everything.
Boxing is my pride.
-That is treason!
Listen,
I will no longer be the shame of my mother.
Nobody can stop me.
Messaoud, nobody can stop me.
Said, it's an order.
If he fights for the enemy, he's a traitor.
-I do my fighting.
Do as you want.
Said, what is he worth, the kid from Algier if he has no hands?
Or eyes.
You understand that?
Go ahead, kill your brother.
Kill me if you're a man.
I will make my fight.
As you wish.
You're crazy.
You're crazy!
-If it continues, I can not do anything for him.
The revolution is a bulldozer.
It destroys everything
-How are you going to condemn?
-He disobeyed orders.
Brother or not
I'll come home.
You don't stop.
You shall not kill my brother.
Nobody shall!
Or, shoot, my brother. Shoot!
What happened to you?
You lost the head.
Thank you for all this.
This evening, you'll invite me to dinner.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You have to.
Otherwise, I'll stop delivering the bags of money.
Thanks.
Forget the revolution for an evening.
Here.
My brother is coming.
Why are not you married?
I have not met my soul mate.
-That's my brother.
You have to go.
Who's that? -Messaoud.
Goodbye.
A blonde?
What will others say?
-There's nothing between her and me.
Look.
Otmani gave me the plan of the office.
I also have invitations.
That's good.
You should take this.
It is loaded.
There are 5 rounds.
Release the safety clutch.
Good.
Invitation?
Here.
Lift your arms.
First floor. Wait there.
Commissioner Picot?
What do you want?
No, stop!
Give me that.
Go!
Stop!
Go! Go!
They had false papers.
Those who make them, they are connate.
The network.
-What are you doing?
-I was worried.
Worried about what?
Please don't come here anymore.
Don't come here!
It can be dangerous!
Don't come anymore!
"Long live the union for peace in Algeria."
French Communist Party.
You have not changed.
Paris without the Krauts.
-What are you doing, except smashing doors of honest citizens?
I am still myself. For France.
Colonel! It has been found!
Good job.
Thanks, you may remember.
Bush! We have enough. Go.
We must identify with this man.
This time we take something.
We have a face. Need a name.
Souni-Abdelkader, arrested
8 May 1945 in Sitif.
It is indeed the same.
He received his education in prison.
Hideouts identified.
On surveillance.
I want people to get their hands on this Abdelkader.
He grew up.
He's a little man.
He walks.
Thank God.
For him, I did a lot.
Good-night.
Oh! Officers, good evening.
How you doing?
You recognise this?
Your name's Souni.
You got friends in FLN?
Republic-Franaise.
I don't know.
You don't know.
No, Mr. Inspector.
I don't know the FLN.
I own a proper business.
You'll close. Security problems.
Son of a bitch.
What are we gonna do?
-We'll close, my boy Vincent.
We'll close.
-Ladies and gentlemen, we shut down for security reasons.
Drinks will be offered.
If you change your mind, alright.
-A cop called Faivre came to close the cabaret.
Beware of him.
He has your picture, Abdelkader.
Don't come over to my home anymore.
Is that clear?
Neither one nor the other.
As they say here: I'm not playing anymore.
Wait.
Faivre-
I know a Faivre.
Colonel Faivre.
From Dien Bien Phu.
Colonel?
Do you remember me?
2nd Class Souni,
Algerians sharpshooters,
Dien Bien Phu.
Camp 113, remember?
Get in the car.
Tell me, Colonel, are you ashamed of what you did?
No.
I've invited you here to give you a chance to redeem yourself.
I'm pleased to see you.
A man without reproach.
The assassinated cops had no family?
-I serve a just cause.
-Me too.
I am fighting for France.
She has to stay an empire in order to exist.
De Gaulle said that.
Me too, I'm a Gaullist.
How about if I told you it were justified that French are silenced by Algerians?
Replace Algerians and French with
French and Germans and it is 1941.
You're on the wrong side.
Unlike 10 years ago.
You would have been a good resistance.
I wish I would've had you.
You could give me information on the minister's instructions.
The resistance fighters now have all the honour.
It's not the same war.
There is a history between
France and Algeria.
Algerian workers were federated because a whole nation is angry.
For nothing, you think?
Give us a little time.
The Algerians will become citizens.
Progress is a war.
You can again be a hero, not a loser.
We are the same.
Yes. We are sacrifices, Faivre.
But you, the past.
Colonel
Colonel.
-One must fight terrorism with its own weapons.
For this, we will create a secret organization which will take the appearance of a criminal organization.
The Minister of Justice and the prefect guarantee us immunity in our actions.
It will be called
"The Red Hand".
Its objective: terrorize supporters of the FLN and kill its leaders.
-They want us to fit into their game
We will respond.
We will respond.
Mum...
Don't be afraid.
It's an early stage tuberculosis.
This disease will not kill me.
Not in this country.
Soon, I will get better.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Champion of the world. What?
World Champion!
The other one doesn't know boxing.
Let him come. Then hit.
How can I make one out of you?
Tell me!
Has he worked on his dodges?
-Yes.
He made you work on your dodging?
He's working on his dodges!
Yes
Yes, that's fine.
Listen
Very important.
I want to invest everything I have in a high level match.
First, he wins in France, then in Europe and and then America.
He'll write history, you'll see.
Hurry up.
Go!
Stop!
What is it?
Go!
That's enough!
Lift!
A unit of Harkis liquidated...
The apartments are being monitored?
Yes.
-He's hosted somewhere.
We'll double the surveillance.
Him we will have, but we'll lose the war.
They will win.
-Messaoud, my son, here's my last will.
There is a bit of our land.
If we return to Algeria, we'll plant a vineyard.
If I die before, place it like this on my cheek.
You will not forget?
Don't worry.
We're going home.
Mum.
-Yes.
I don't want to lie to you.
I killed people.
I killed many.
With these hands.
I've constriction.
Mum. I've strangled.
I was forced to do so.
God is my witness.
So my son can have a better life.
Everything I've done, I've done for him.
Everything for him.
For a long time, I've known nothing but death.
I know nothing but death.
Forgive me, mum.
Yes?
Good evening. Good evening.
I'm going to Germany.
You must accompany me.
-When?
-Tonight.
Okay.
- What we wanted to prove by taking on these young soldiers?
Heinous crimes
Yes?
- Morvan.
An Algerian has entered the theatre of Helene Legendre.
It's Abdelkader.
We have them.
Red Hand will take care of them.
A policy of social democracy wanted by the government.
That's what's worrying the separatists.
Pressed to act, they wanted their bloody night.
And yet they have only managed to strengthen our determination.
Helene! Helene!
That's good.
Pay him.
MP40-machine guns, 200 units.
Fully revised.
Don't sleep!
Look, take more.
Here. There you go, go!
Faster!
Let's go!
Faster! Go!
Operation completed.
Go to France, each on your own.
Not in groups.
One by one.
Above all, do not talk about it to anyone, understood?
Important.
Absolute silence. Discipline.
God bless you.
Good luck.
In Paris, watch the curfew.
-See you soon, Messaoud.
-God bless you.
This is an American song.
It sucks.
They call that music?
Dance.
Dancing?
How does one dance to that?
That's good.
It's really a shame.
Shame.
I like that.
-I don't like it.
What are you doing here?
The curfew.
-It's for Algerians.
Not for Moroccans.
Your papers.
Follow us.
...greeted at the airport by the members of Parliament of Algeria,
the General was present the next day...
You're Algerian.
And Germany?
What are you going to do?
We know that the FLN is in Frankfurt.
- France could become an exporter of petrol...
The president: "We are sure that some of the energy from the ground
will ensure the industrial development of Algeria."
You want to tell me anything?
Well, you go back to the Harkis.
- In his speech, General de
Gaulle declared:
"The page of the battle has been turned
and page of progress and civilization, opened."
This goes beyond
the old partisan quarrels, the attacks.
There is light for everyone.
He has spoken. Valenciennes.
Hello?
-Your brothers have been turned in.
-Who is this?
- Otmani. I was in Indochina with your brother.
This isn't a trap.
Messaoud saved me.
Hereby, I pay my debt.
Where are they?
In Valenciennes.
Salaam aleikoum.
Are you ready? Mount.
Take up arms.
Go, go!
Machine guns on one side, ammunition on the other.
Hurry.
Quick, quick!
Go! Ho, there!
Discharged.
Silence!
Shhh! Listen. Listen.
Messaoud
The police.
Hide!
Cover!
Warning!
Long live Algeria!
Abdelkader! Don't come out!
Hide!
Varin, with me!
Messaoud! Behind us!
Get up!
Behind me!
Messaoud! Hurry!
Easy.
Tell Mum, my wife my son...
Tell them to forgive me.
Don't forget, Abdelkader.
Hush, Messaoud.
Don't talk.
My brother.
My brother!
Messaoud.
Messaoud!
God rest your soul.
My brother.
Explain to Mum and his wife that he didn't die for nothing but for justice.
The men are motivated.
Continue the fight against the police.
Abdelkader...
We need a demonstration.
A peaceful demonstration.
All Algerians.
Our weapon to arrange the independence.
-It will be a massacre.
The police will take revenge.
There will be deaths.
It's certain.
I agree.
But if the French government uses repression against us, it's in our interest.
Remember the international opinion.
The whole world will be watching us.
Abdelkader, this will serve our cause.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Abdelkader.
We need to organize this demonstration in Paris,
At October 17th.
But you will not participate.
For your brother, don't meddle.
There will be cops, at the match.
You can be recognized.
No recklessness.
Your brother, we'll take care.
The match should not take place.
You agree?
Yes.
May God help us.
Be careful.
Good evening.
How's the kid from Algiers?
Faster.
Who's the best?
The champion?
Me!
I already congratulate you.
There. Concentrate!
Said?
Said, come on.
Ah, my brother...
You've come!
-Listen...
The FLN is here.
They want to kill you.
Cancel the match.
What's that you're saying?
They will kill you.
Stop the match.
-You're not serious?
This match, it's my life!
We don't have time!
Cancel the match, understand?
Cancel it!
You're the only brother
I have left.
I don't want to lose you.
-All my life I've waited for this moment.
And you ask me to cancel?
But look, they are here.
Here, great.
Uncle.
Get out.
What?
I'm warmed up.
Please.
What's wrong with your head?
-I'm begging you!
It's not possible.
Has he gone mad?
-Get out.
Please.
Sit down.
Get dressed.
Get dressed? Why?
Because there will be no match.
What, no match?
Calm down.
-Calm down?
Why can't I box?
Don't argue. There'll be no match.
I'm not getting dressed!
-They will kill you.
-Who?
The FLN.
What FLN?
They will kill you if you box.
Listen to him.
Stay here.
I'll box.
Obey!
Get out.
They will kill you.
What are you doing?
You'll be a champion!
Stay behind me.
Run!
Push!
Left!
Police!
Run, Said!
Watch out!
Move, move!
Long live Algeria!
Pardon me.
Long live Algeria!
Long live Algeria!
The Algerians out! Get out!
Abdelkader! Abdelkader!
Go, my brothers!
Long live Algeria!
No!
Abdelkader!
Abdelkader!
Abdelkader!
No!
My brother!
Don't die!
No!
My brother!
No!
Abdelkader!
Don't die!
My brother!
You have won.
Long live Algeria!
Germans.
Let's get them!
Where are the damn fighters going?
They've gone chasing scalps, leaving us unprotected again.
Damn those glory-grabbing bastards!
Bandits! Hundreds of them!
Six o'clock!
Is there anything left of our escort?
Negative, boss.
Damn it! Why don't they worry about us?
I can't believe this!
It never fails.
Oh, no.
Stay with me.
This is Bouncing Betty.
Engine three is out.
We're falling back. Two, you take lead position.
Need the extinguisher.
Hank!
Mayday! Mayday!
Prepare to bail out.
I repeat, prepare to bail...
Red One to Red Two, come in.
Are you awake over there, Lightning?
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
Boy, I need a nap!
Well, look alive. Wouldn't want you to miss this war.
War is hell. What we're doing is just boring as hell.
Whoever she was, I hope she was worth losing sleep over.
Oh, trust me, she was worth it!
Junior.
Junior, you okay?
Fine as wine, Red One. The sky is blue and my guns are hot.
Joker, you all right?
Nope. I feel like I'm flying my grandfather's Buick.
Coolant indicator's all over the map.
And to think I was as happy as a church lady when I got this plane.
All right, Red Four, you're done.
Take it on home.
Come on now, Captain, this gauge over here is a piece of crap.
Captain, let me give it a looky before you send him back.
He's not trailing any oil or water.
Seems to me like he's just got a bad indicator.
Come on, Easy. Let me fly, sir, please?
You know it ain't gonna be no fun without me.
All right. Okay.
You stay on, Red Four.
You stay on, but you keep an eye on it, all right?
Thank you, sweetheart.
Just my luck I get stuck with the flying wreck.
Another P-40 from
Uncle Sam's junkyard.
It looks like we got a truck up there.
It's got German markings.
Junior, it's your turn.
Yes, sir!
Prepare to feel the wrath of the Ray Gun.
I'm on your wing, Junior!
Come on.
You see that?
Congratulations, kid.
You killed yourself a truck.
Whoo-hoo!
We can go back victorious.
Everybody, form up.
We're going home.
Uh...
Easy, I see something. It's a train!
Eleven o'clock.
I don't think it's German.
I don't see any guns.
Looks like they're moving livestock to me.
No. It's military.
It's camouflaged.
It could just be cows.
You don't want to shoot up no cows if you don't have to.
Unless y'all planning on a barbecue.
Nobody sees any guns?
I'm telling you, Easy, that's a munitions train.
And I bet it's armed to the teeth.
You grown-ups better think fast.
It's headed for that tunnel.
All right. Only one way to find out.
Let's go get it.
Wait. Easy, we got to take it head-on, low, so their guns can't hit us.
It's my decision, Lightning.
Stay in formation.
Looks like these cows are armed.
Come on.
Stay in front of it!
Die, you Nazi dogs!
Dang! Those cows just shot up my wing!
No sweat. No sweat.
If that train makes it into the tunnel, they'll stop in there.
Where's Lightning?
Where the hell are you, Lightning?
Taking the train from the front, like you should have done.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Gotcha!
Whoa! Shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Nothing like a good old
Georgia ass-whupping.
Just trying to keep you boys inspired.
How's this headline for inspiration?
"Negro Pilot Dies Because He's
Too Stupid To Follow Orders."
Your plane looks like it's been through a shredder.
How are you going to explain that to Coffee?
By explaining to him that I'm the one who blew up the train.
You boys go on ahead.
I've spotted something.
Lightning destroyed another one.
Look at that mess.
Look at that mess.
I guess we'll be working all night again.
It's been a long time since you've seen your sweetheart.
Too bad she's dancing with someone new.
This is Axis Mary coming to you
from Berlin with your favorite music.
Never thought that you would be
Standing here so close to me
There's so much I feel that I should say
But words can wait
Until some other day
How about one time you bring my plane home without wrecking it?
Good morning, Mr. Coffee.
You keep tearing up my planes like this, you're gonna be wearing your balls for a necktie.
See, I can't let you do that,
'cause I just saw a goddess who's gonna bear my beautiful children.
You're a clown, Lightning.
You need to grow up.
We can't afford to have any more planes taken off the line with your stupid...
What is this?
What did you do?
Oh, man! Where did that come from?
What happened was...
Sticks!
Come see what this clown did to the plane.
I can see what you're thinking.
What the hell is this? Did somebody throw a train at you?
Coffee, I can see you're upset.
Maybe we should talk about this another time.
Oh, we got a new recruit here!
Hey there.
You lost, son?
I was looking for Jimmy Wayans.
Uh, Jimmy got shot down must've been, what, two weeks ago?
I believe so.
Well, is Uly Douglas here?
Uh-uh.
Furball's dead, son.
Crashed on takeoff.
You're just a bad-luck
Chuck, aren't you?
Everybody you know ends up on the wrong side of the dirt.
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
My name's Smokey.
This here's Neon, this is Joker.
Flight Officer
Maurice Wilson, sir!
You can leave all that saluting, son.
You're home now.
Seeing as how everybody you know dead, you might as well bunk with us.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Just don't bad luck us before you get up in this Jeep now.
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to live.
Come on, Maurice.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy, get in there!
Hold on.
Come on, Maurice.
Wait, you've got to back up.
How'd it go up there, Ray?
I'm telling you, Deacon.
Lightning almost got himself killed again today.
He's one crazy pilot.
I'm going to pray for him if we ever get to see any real combat.
Well, hey, I see you here after every mission.
I'm sure your prayers are helping.
Thanks, Deke.
Black Jesus, we thank you for bringing
Red Squadron back home to us.
Lightning's usual elegant work.
Although I understand your plane didn't fare any better than the train.
Sir.
That old Lightning don't never have his brakes on.
Questions, gentlemen.
Does it really matter, sir?
- Lights up.
- Here we go.
What was your question?
What we do, how well we do it, does it matter?
Strafing runs and coastal patrols.
They got us out here using planes to mop floors, fellas.
I don't normally go in for loose talk, but we won't even be doing that for long.
Ain't that why Colonel
Bullard went stateside?
The Colonel's business stateside is above your grade.
All due respect, sir, but are they back there deciding if they should shut us down?
Just a rumor, Winky.
You know this how?
Pass it up.
Read it, Easy.
Out loud.
Go ahead, son.
"The use of Negroes in the Army
Air Corps may yet be halted."
"A report has been forwarded calling the performance by Negro pilots"
"unsatisfactory."
"A plan to assign the Negroes to routine convoy cover may be"
"all that remains for those who seem"
"to have neither the intelligence"
"nor the proper reflexes for such a complicated task"
"as fighter pursuit.
The great Tuskegee..."
"The great Tuskegee experiment"
"to allow the Negro type to fly airplanes has failed."
And you all thought what?
You'd sign up.
You get shiny boots, a uniform, and that'd be the end of 100 years of bigotry?
You're colored men in a white man's army.
It's a miracle you're flying fighters in Italy, and not mopping latrines in Milwaukee!
You want it straight?
Yes, the old man's stateside, fighting the good fight.
And when he comes through for us, we better be damn sure we're ready to do the same for him.
Any of you feel otherwise, any of you want to wash yourselves out, well, Negro, please do so, and I'll have you on the next thing smoking back home to make room for the men who want to stand and fight.
Get your head up, son.
You're fighter pilots.
Watch the rest of the film.
Learn something.
When we came under your command, Colonel, you stated very clearly that we would never find Negroes who could pass a pilot's exam, make it through flight school, survive basic combat.
A combat record which, to this point...
We've done all of that.
To this point,
I don't believe your boys have scored a single aerial kill.
Because you have not assigned us a single forward mission.
It's damn hard to shoot down the enemy
100 miles behind the front lines.
As a matter of fact, when will we be assigned to bomber escorts, Colonel?
There have been any number of reports of poor discipline.
Which is in every newspaper and magazine in the country.
We have enough race troubles as it is without these sons of bitches in the press throwing fuel on the fire.
How an unofficial assessment of the Tuskegee program made its way to newspapers and magazines may be worthy of its own hearing, sir.
Colonel Tomlinson, you've been supporting this experiment from the beginning, but I'm afraid you're just gonna have to suffer its failure.
We're given hand-me-down planes.
Ordered to attack targets that have already been bypassed.
Fly patrols where the enemy hasn't been seen for months.
Now we've clone every lowdown, dirty job you've handed us, hoping that we would just limp along and go away.
We will not go away.
We have a right to fight for our country, the same as every other American.
So you shut us down, or you let us fly.
Soldier boy
Oh, do you think about me, soldier boy?
How could you ever...
What?
Don't give me that look.
What the hell were you doing up there today?
Beating up on Hitler. Winning the war.
I got the train, didn't I?
I love you like a brother, Joe.
But you disobey my orders again,
I'm gonna have to write you up.
For what?
For being right?
I told you those guns were there.
You almost got yourself killed.
No, I followed protocol.
You went for the glory.
There's a difference.
Now you may not need me to get you through this thing alive, but Joker, Junior, the rest of the squad just might.
Okay. You're right,
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.
What you in such a hurry for anyway?
I saw a girl.
The most beautiful
I have ever seen.
Just can't let them alone, can you?
No more than you can let that bottle alone.
You got your way of getting through the war, and I got mine.
I wonder what your pops'd say to that.
We can just leave him out of this.
He's got you in a pressure cooker, man.
Graduating college at 20,
4.0, and now a captain?
Pushing yourself mighty hard to please him.
Didn't I just say we can leave him out of this?
All right.
Besides, I drink 'cause I got to bunk with your crazy self.
You bunk with me 'cause I'm the best pilot in the whole damn Army, and you're just hoping you're gonna learn something.
If I'm not mistaken,
I'm the flight leader, which would make you my wingman.
Smarter doesn't make you better.
Better at what? Busting up Coffee's planes?
Romancing the ladies, for one.
Now if you're done whining,
I have got a pass to do that very thing right now.
Lightning.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What's going to happen when you go home and the women speak English, and they understand just how full of bullshit you are?
What's this?
Something to celebrate you being old enough to know better.
Ha!
"Italian for Beginners"?
How many cartons of smokes this set you back?
A simple "thank you" wouldn't hurt.
And a "happy birthday" would have been fine.
Knowing you, you're just tired of me embarrassing myself in front of the signorinas.
Yeah, that might be it.
How you feel?
A whole lot more than one year older.
Thank you.
Happy birthday.
It's tight.
Pilots got you all hot and bothered.
Come on.
Coffee!
We got three planes, the hydraulic pumps are shot.
Two more got bad governors.
Grab a piece of that tape and put it over that hose.
What are you doing, Lightning?
What?
What did you say?
Come on, Lightning.
I need it back by nightfall!
And ask if she's got a sister!
Yeah, a blind one!
I'm sorry to bother you.
I flew around your house this morning.
Okay. Uh...
Right, you...
Si.
That was me.
I'm Joe.
Joe.
Yeah.
D'accordo. Sofia.
Sofia, right.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Mama.
Little.
Joe Little.
I hope I'm not intruding, ma'am.
Thank you.
Ah!
Ah!
Hold on. I want to ask you something.
How?
Oh, how? I got a Jeep. You want to come for a drive?
Dove?
What's dove?
Dove.
Is that a yes?
You want to bring your mother?
It's going to be tougher than I thought.
What you going with?
I got two pair.
And three of clubs.
I don't care what you have, you'll never be able to beat me, son.
You ain't got enough in the head.
I can't lose. I don't even know why y'all try.
You just got here, Maurice. I hope you're learning something.
Hope at least you're learning by now not to play poker with people that cheat.
I ain't cheating.
You cheat.
I don't want to learn how to play cards,
I want to learn about combat flying.
Dogfights and tricks for switching it up on them Jerries.
What the hell you think it is we know about dogfighting?
The white boys are the only ones get to tangle it up with the Jerries around here.
But they don't talk to us much, so...
Experience is a cruel teacher. She gives the exam first, then the lesson.
You know what?
I decided when I get home...
Yeah.
...people ask me about the war,
I'm going to just make stuff up.
Hell, I already do! Ask me what I killed, seven trucks, five Jeeps, and one of those motorcycles with the sidecar on them.
My record look like the inventory down at the motor pool.
How the hell am I gonna go back home and tell my dad all I killed were traffic?
He'll whup my ass!
What's that?
It's my Buck Rogers
X-38 disintegrator pistol.
Makes me feel like...
You know, like I can't lose.
Here, try it.
No. No, thanks, Junior.
I don't really like to fool with other people's good luck charms.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Um...
Look, I don't like being called Junior.
I want the tag Ray Gun.
I'm not a kid.
I did two years at Howard before I even enrolled in the Tuskegee program.
I'm going to be an engineer.
What about you?
My dad's a judge.
He wants me to go to law school, so I guess I'm gonna do that.
You ought to just give it up!
Go back to where you came from.
I'd rather be up there killing Jerries than down here playing games with you, Joker.
Look, don't be in a hurry to get to the killing part, Maurice.
Tell me something.
You scared of dying?
I don't know.
I am.
Every time I close the lid on that canopy,
I feel like I'm shutting the lid on my own coffin.
I tell you something else, the pilot that tells you otherwise is either a liar or too foolish to know any better.
Amen.
It's useless.
All this talk for another study, another inquiry.
"Politics is the art of..."
Major Kessel's political science class, the quote that he used...
He said, "Politics is the art of postponing a decision until it is..."
"No longer relevant."
Colonel
Mortamus stumbled badly.
If he hadn't embarrassed the brass by leaking that report to the press, they probably would have let you wither and die.
His politicking bought you time.
For what?
Operation Shingle.
Air cover for a beach landing.
It's your chance to go up against German fighters.
I'll say this, Jack.
Even when your hope is false, it sure is grand.
I'm serious, A.J.
I can get that for you.
If you stick your neck out how far?
I don't want you to put your career on the line for me, Jack.
A little less tin on my uniform is the least of it.
If I get you the mission, your men have got to put something on the board.
They come through, or Mortamus and the brass will have all they need to shut the whole thing down.
You get us that mission, we will light up the board.
Has this flight order been verified?
Yes, sir. It came directly from Colonel Bullard in Washington.
Check it again. Get the flight leaders together.
Sir.
The Colonel got us an opportunity.
Gather around, gentlemen.
Attacking another train, sir?
Or did we graduate to minding a truck convoy this time?
Operation Shingle.
It's an ambitious landing off the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea at Nettuno.
We've been given the frag order to provide air cover for the landing.
Yeah!
Whoo!
I'm gonna have so many of those little swastikas on my plane, they're gonna think it's camouflage.
We will repay the old man with victory, hear me?
Yes, sir!
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Junior, where you at, boy?
You're gonna miss the flight.
I know I'm late.
I'm coming.
We're a long way from Memphis, but Black Jesus is here with me, and he says it's gonna be a successful mission.
Now does that mean we're gonna shoot down a bunch of Jerries, or we gonna come back in one piece, or Lightning gonna pick up some girls along the way?
No more pickups for me, boys.
I swear to you, lam in love.
Love? Swearing? Both bad luck in my book.
I can't believe I made it.
Don't tell Easy I was late.
They all set?
All ready, sir!
Send them off.
Hallelujah. The saints are marching in!
Watch me become an ace today, boys.
Lightning, did you just say you're gonna become an ass today, or an ace?
I couldn't quite hear what you...
Was it ass or ace?
I couldn't hear.
I think you heard him right, Smokey.
All right, men, cut the chatter.
Jesus.
Would you look at that!
Oh, my goodness.
Just like in the newsreels.
Keep your eyes peeled for the Jerries.
Bogies inbound, twelve o'clock.
And they're closing in mighty fast!
These pilots are rookies!
Make quick work of them.
All planes, hold formation.
Hold on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Anytime, Red One.
Drop tanks!
Oh, shit!
I'm shaking them!
There's two more!
Yes. They're cutting left!
Put a little hitch in his giddyup!
I'm feeling good now!
Remember, keep the beachhead clear.
It's clear.
Straighten up over there, Junior.
Let's go, Lightning.
I'm on one.
I'm behind you. Break right!
I got him.
Get on the inside, Easy!
Get on the inside.
Come on, slip just a little.
Come on, tighter, tighter.
Congratulations, Captain.
You are the first Negro to shoot down a Jerry! Whoo!
Ha-ha!
Junior!
Straight ahead now.
There's my swastika.
I'm on your wing.
Come on, baby, just move a little bit closer.
All I want is a little bitty kiss.
Just give me a little peck on the cheek. Yeah!
Good shot.
Oh, hell.
Joker, there's one on my tail!
Okay, listen, Junior. Buttonhook right, and I'm gonna go left.
Come on.
No touchdown for you today, Fritz.
Junior, you're all clear, buddy.
Deke, on your right!
I see him.
Let's give those newspapers something to write about.
Tennessee says hello!
There's the squad leader.
I'm gonna take him out.
Careful. He's good.
You're letting him get away, Lightning!
I'm just toying with him.
This is for you, Pretty Boy, with your bright yellow nose!
Come on, boy. Line it up.
One shot.
Holy crap!
How'd he do that?
Get him off me!
I'm on him.
Get him off me!
Get out of the way, Lightning!
Open your throttle.
Come on, man!
Take him out!
I can't get a clear shot.
Hold on.
Drop to your right.
All right! I got him.
Oh! Thank you, Lord.
And there I was thinking you didn't love me any more.
He's headed home to mama.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
If you're thinking
I should finish him off
so we can get back to the beachhead, then, yes.
Or we could follow him.
We could go after their airdrome.
I don't know, Lightning. We got orders.
You know that.
Come on, Easy. I'm talking about a Jerry airbase.
Dozens of planes!
You're saying no?
All right. I'll trust your instincts this time.
But we're running low on fuel. We're gonna follow for five minutes.
You got that?
Five minutes.
Joker, you back there?
We're still back here.
Junior?
I'm ready for a turkey shoot.
Mayday! Mayday!
There it is, boys.
Get your scorecards ready.
Gotta knock out those fighters before they take off.
Got to take those guns out first.
Everybody, form up.
Here we go!
Brand-new 109s.
Not so brand-new 109s.
Like ducks in a row.
All right.
Two at once!
That's nothing. Watch me get four this time.
Touchdown!
We're running low on fuel.
No time for celebration.
Whoo!
The Ray Gun strikes again.
Junior, watch out for that flak!
Good job, Lightning.
Washington brass won't be able to ignore this.
My God!
Those pilots are African!
Hey! What happened to Junior?
There he is.
Three o'clock high.
He's trailing oil.
Red One to Red Three.
Junior, come in.
I took something in the leg.
Something in my head.
Level off, Junior, or you're gonna stall out.
All right.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Whoa!
They done shot down the whole
Luftwaffe, didn't they?
Yes, they did, huh?
Those hotshots sure did.
Never doubted it.
Did I make it?
Yeah, you made it, damn Knucklehead.
Should have let you crash.
You'll be okay.
No surprises, Ray Gun.
You get healthy, all right?
Luck is with you, Ray!
I think we can cautiously declare the landing a victory.
It's a slog, but the ground troops are holding.
Colonel Bullard.
Sir.
Your boys chalked eight kills in the air,
63 aircraft destroyed on the ground.
No losses in their first wave.
Outstanding. Pass along my congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Action reports and assessments by 1500.
Colonel.
Eight German fighters or 80 German fighters, it still doesn't change what I think of you and your boys.
We don't care.
Respect the uniform.
Believe me, sir, that is all I have respect for.
It's not as bad as all this.
Leg's good, eye's fine.
In a week's time,
I'll be able to see fine out of one eye and mostly out of the other.
"Mostly."
Is that what you want me to tell Stance?
"Sir, Ray Gun has one-and-a-half eyes' worth of ability."
Look, come on.
I landed a plane blind.
Lightning...
Hey, don't get me in this.
If the Flight Surgeon won't clean bill you, what do you expect me to do?
Just talk to him.
He listens to you.
I mean, you got the same respect on this base as the old man, so...
I'd rather be dead than on the ground.
Easy, you're the best friend I got.
Please don't do this to me.
General Luntz, Colonel Bullard.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Colonel, please.
Thank you.
No, thank you, sir.
Colonel, I'm in a hell of a fix with our target in Europe.
Our boys are getting cut to shreds.
I read the action report from Operation Shingle.
Eight kills in your first wave.
Thirteen in ail.
That's a right trick.
Colonel, I'll give it to you straight.
I can't afford the kind of losses my bombers have been suffering.
Do you have film of the air cover your bombers are getting now, sir?
We need to change the way we fight.
I need pilots who will fly close and tight to the heavies all the way.
Not put my men in harm's way by chasing rabbits.
So you're asking me to tell my men not to shoot down
Jerry fighters?
I'm asking them to put the bombers ahead of themselves.
I don't care if they never splash another Jerry fighter.
I need to get my heavies to the target and back.
The losses from enemy air, I believe my men can get that down, sir.
If you can bring back one or two more of my planes every mission...
Sir, I believe we can cut your losses by 70% or 80%.
Colonel, the word is you're arrogant.
If "arrogant" is the only word people use to describe me now,
I would say I think
I'm making progress.
Can you help us?
I'm asking you man to man.
Can you help save lives?
We need new planes.
No more hand-me-downs.
If you get us new planes, we can help your boys.
I got a bullet right through my canopy.
I ought to be dead, y'all.
But nothing happened to me though.
It's Black Jesus,
I'm telling you.
Oh, go on with that.
Let's play.
Don't sass Black Jesus, now you might need him one day.
What happened to you is luck.
Just luck.
Lords of Poker,
Black Jesus, White Jesus,
Tooth Fairy, Easter
Bunny, all of them!
I done lost all my damn money.
Something is wrong.
Ain't that right.
How about you just get wise?
There is no special mojo running the world.
Things just are how they are.
Us getting shot up and the people we're protecting not caring a thing for it.
I hear that.
You talk real tough, Joe Little.
Real cold.
Well, reality's a little chilly.
Is that right?
Let's play!
Let me tell you about this cold, hard brother.
While y'all trying to get by with your whiskey and cigarettes, guess what he's doing with his rations?
- What's that?
- What he doing?
Trading them all for lingerie to spoil his old lady.
Oh, really?
Perfume, silks.
Aw!
That tease!
Yeah, well, lucky at love and lucky at cards.
Right like that. Boom!
Man, you are so beautiful.
Of course, you have no idea what I'm saying.
I love you.
Oh, uh...
Wow, that's...
Uh...
Uh...
Shh!
What are you doing here?
This is an officers' club.
I am an officer.
This is a whites-only officers' club.
You're off the reservation, pal.
Try the Italian dance hall near the main plaza.
Hey. Go home, nigger.
I got what I came for.
Good night.
Am I going to be court-martialed?
I don't know.
I'm sure you trying to start a race riot won't help you...
I was finishing what they started!
Wrong or right, we got regs to live by.
And you throwing punches, busting them up, gets you what?
A good feeling, Easy.
Right here.
A throb that says I didn't choke on what they were feeding me.
How do your heart feel? You say
"they" like it's all of them.
Same as always. "Shuffle along, cause no strife.
"Don't scare the ofays by speaking out."
Some other time I'd have stood with you, side by side.
"Some other time"!
But you put a minute's worth of righteousness ahead of a whole war!
Ugh!
Same old Joe Little.
Still getting into the wrong fights for the wrong reasons.
Your reasons any better?
You spent your whole life being one big, lousy Atlanta Compromise.
Well, go sell that somewhere else.
I'm not buying it.
I've come bearing gifts.
I'm all ears, sir.
Bomber escort
New P-51 s.
You did it.
You really did it, sir.
Come on. Let's get some food.
I'm hungry.
Welcome home, Colonel.
Lieutenant Little
. What am I going to do with you?
Everything's a fight, isn't it?
It must be so goddamn exhausting being you.
You know something, Joe Little?
You're a punk.
You remind me of one of those kids from a comic strip, walking around, pushing his sleeve up one arm, hand balled in a tight fist, walking and looking at the world through a squint.
Always looking to knock something down just because it's standing.
It's right there.
It's right there.
You really want to knock something down?
Try using that.
Because I will tell you straight,
I don't have anything against you.
I have the highest expectations for you.
Lieutenant Little,
I need everyone on this next mission.
And you're lucky you're the best damn pilot we've got.
Report to your unit.
Bless you
For being an angel
Just when it seemed
That heaven was not for me
Bless you, for building...
They let you out, huh?
Or did you bust out?
Very funny.
Look, uh.
I said some things.
Yeah, you did.
I didn't mean them.
Yeah, you did.
You know me. Act first, think later.
Well, nobody's perfect.
We good?
Yeah, we're good.
I figured it out.
What? That throwing punches doesn't solve your problems?
No.
That maneuver Pretty Boy pulled on me, got on my tail,
I figured out how to do it.
Fancy trick flying will only get you killed.
Or make me an ace.
The American pilots flying escort now go for every kill they can score.
That's how they were trained.
That's how they fight.
Here's how we change up the strategy.
Lights up.
At all costs, under every circumstance, you protect the heavies.
Colonel.
We signed up to shoot
Germans, not babysit planes.
You signed up to follow orders.
One bomber, that's 10 men.
You getting one Jerry so you can put a cross on your plane, that doesn't balance that.
We count our victories by the bombers we get to their targets.
By the husbands we return to their wives.
By the fathers we get back to their children.
What has not changed, what will never change, from the last plane, to the last bullet, to the last minute, to the last man, we fight.
We fight!
Yes, sir!
We've secured new aircrafts.
P-51s.
The best the AAF's got.
As soon as we get the A-okay, we'll begin ferrying them in from Bari.
Dismissed.
Say cheese, say cheese.
Whoo-hoo!
My, my, my!
Hey, Maurice!
How are they flying?
Like angels.
I don't know any angels with six .50-caliber machine guns.
All right, men, get your manuals.
Get familiar.
Coffee!
Yes, sir.
We'll need them all marked up and ready to fly.
It's taken care of.
The Major says paint their tails bright red, so they stand out.
Like the Red Baron.
Loud and proud.
Appreciate it.
Beautiful.
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
This will definitely make the group distinctive.
Bright red tails and black pilots?
You can't call us nothing else but distinctive.
From now on.
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
What do you think?
It's like it's speeding even when it's sitting.
I never even met a girl as beautiful as this plane.
Well, take good care of her.
What do you mean?
I twisted the Flight Surgeon's arm.
Got you back on the roster.
You going up with us next mission.
Uh...
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to tell the guys.
Heavenly Father, we thank you for this glorious day.
We ask that you send your angels down to surround us as we fly through the sky.
We know that it's part of your master plan that we've made it all the way from Tuskegee here to Ramitelli.
We are very confident in our abilities, but we ask that you give us the vision, the sight, and the speed and power to make it through this mission.
All the airmen say, "In
Jesus' name we pray." Amen.
Amen.
- Nothing's difficult.
- Everything's a challenge.
- Through adversity...
- ...to the stars!
From the last plane, to the last bullet, to the last minute, to the last man, we fight!
We fight!
We fight!
Anybody got eyes on the bombers?
Uh...
We are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.
Right on target, and according to my reckoning, 32 seconds early.
We're here.
They're not.
Maybe the bombers turned back.
Damn! Maybe they went on without us.
Red One, there they are.
Nine o'clock low.
Junior, head on over to the bomber leader.
Let him know we're friendlies.
Roger that.
Bogies! Three high.
Everybody, on your guns.
Counting close to 70 chicks.
We got one coming down.
Hold your fire.
They're ours.
Red tails? I don't recognize the markings.
He's colored.
Yeah, right.
Hell if I'm joking!
Look.
Jesus Christ. They can't all be colored.
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!
What the hell do we do?
Tacoma One to all planes.
Everybody's eyes open.
I don't think our fighter escort
is gonna be much help this trip.
Flying Fortresses!
At least a hundred!
Decoy Squadron, move in and draw off those fighters.
Fighters, four o'clock.
They're not attacking.
Let them go.
Let them go?
Our orders are to stay with the bombers.
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.
You heard Colonel Bullard. Forget the prize, save the lives.
God, I hate this war.
Look at that. Those Red
Tails are staying put.
They're giving up glory to save our asses.
We'll have to do this the hard way...
...Break!
Here we go, Lightning.
Right behind you.
Where'd this jackass come from?
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.
Stop fooling around!
Damn it, I'm coming.
No, you're not.
Stay put.
I'm gonna show him a little trick I learned.
Whoo! Ha-ha!
Lightning, when are you gonna learn this is not a game?
Coming up on anti-aircraft guns.
Back off! We'll get
'em on the way back...
Break! Break!
Those Jerries are hightailing it out of here.
Flak's getting thick.
Break off. Circle clear of the flak until the bombers return.
Good luck, bombardiers!
All bombs away! Let's get the hell out of here.
Here they come.
Form up.
Move in...
...Concentrate on the stragglers!
Hey, Junior! You got a bandit on your left!
Get out of there.
I'll take him.
Junior, get out of there!
Where is he?
I can't see him!
Ah!
Junior, where are you?
Are you all right?
I'm all right!
Junior, you're on fire!
Junior, get out of the plane!
Junior!
Come on, Junior, bail!
Geronimo!
We didn't lose a single plane.
Well, that's a first.
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!
Don't look good.
Deke, talk to me.
What's your status?
I'm all right.
I got gas spraying everywhere, but I think I'm gonna be okay.
I'm a little dizzy, but other than that, I'm fine.
All right, listen up.
I'll give escort to Deke
. Everybody else head back to base.
No, I'll stay. I'm his wingman.
I'll stay.
Let me take him, Easy.
God, I hate this mask!
It's my call, Lightning.
Your calls have been a little off lately.
What? What are you talking about?
Junior shouldn't have been up here.
You got a problem with the way I'm running this squad, you talk to Bullard about it, all right?
Until then, I'm in control.
And my order for you right now is to head back to base.
Damn!
All right, Deke, you'll be all right.
I'll see you back at the ranch.
You got Black Jesus with you, boy!
Thanks, Smokey.
Well, get me home, Easy.
No, sir. You're going to get yourself home.
What the hell put the Captain in such a bad mood?
He gets like that sometimes.
He knows good and well he shouldn't have let Junior fly.
That boy was half blind.
We're almost home.
I hope we meet up with those Red Tails next time.
Listen, boys, the bombers have passed their safe point.
Our mission is over.
Let's head back to base.
You guys are taking the long way.
I'm going to take a shortcut down the coast.
Come on now, Lightning. Ain't no need to get all crazy.
You know you got to stay with your squadron.
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.
And what if you turn up missing?
Then I'll have to break it to Major Stance.
Well, break it to him gently.
Great, great, great!
One's a drunk, and the other one does whatever the hell he wants to do.
Smokey, stay with him.
And keep him out of trouble.
Don't worry.
I'll stick with him.
My head, it hurts.
We're almost there, Deke.
Stay with me.
Easy, I got blood all over me, but I'm not bleeding.
You're gonna be okay.
I'm right above you.
Captain,
I'm getting real dizzy.
I need to rest a minute.
No, no. Stay alert, Deke.
I'm here with you.
I can't really see anything!
Everything's all blurred!
I got double vision.
You're slipping, Deke! Deke, you're slipping! Steady up!
All right.
All right.
You're diving, Deke. You need to pull back on your stick.
Pull up, Deke, pull up!
Deke, listen to me! Pull back on your stick now!
Pull up, Deke, pull up!
Pull up?
Oh, I'm pulling up!
I'm pulling up!
Come on!
I must have passed out!
I need you to stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.
Just keep talking.
All right.
Lightning, look! German destroyer, moving to the north!
I still got ammo.
How about you?
Nah. You need about a 500-pound bomb to put a dent in that thing.
Plus, that baby got very, very big guns.
Just watch me.
Lightning, no, all right?
Don't be crazy.
If the big guns don't kill you, your plane will get messed up,
and Coffee is gonna kill you.
Relax, Smokey. Worrying too much will kill you.
All right! That was fun! Okay, come on now, time to go home.
Just one more pass.
How do you like that, Mr. Hitler?
Lightning, you a damn fool!
But I love you! Come on.
Ramitelli to Subsoil Red One.
Do you read?
I got Red Four with me, he's busted up pretty bad.
Stay alert, Deke.
Stay alert.
Ramitelli, have a fire truck standing by.
He's leaking fuel. I repeat, he's leaking fuel.
This is Major Stance.
Circle a half-mile out and have Red Four bail.
Flight surgeons will be there waiting.
Copy that.
You're gonna put it into a left bank, and you're up and out.
All right?
I can't get the canopy open!
Easy!
Listen, Deke, the only thing between you living and dying is that canopy.
Now, get it open!
I can't open it!
I can't open it!
Red Four cannot open his canopy.
I repeat, he cannot open his canopy.
I'm gonna have to bring him in.
Roger that.
Sweet Jesus, don't let this happen to me.
Okay. Okay.
All right, Deke.
Flaps down.
Flaps down.
There you go.
Level off, level off!
I'm leveling.
Help me, sir.
I'm covered in fuel!
I'm coming around behind you, Deke.
All right, now get your gear down.
Easy! I think I'm coming in too hot!
I don't want to die!
I'm not ready!
Just relax.
Level off, Deke.
Too fast.
I'm going too fast!
Nose up! Nose up!
Come on!
Drop your throttle!
Nose down!
Nose down!
No! No!
Shit!
Deke!
Smoke cloud on the left.
You don't think that's Deke, do you?
Who was it?
Deke.
It was Deke.
Oh, shit.
An engine fire.
Gas leak must have caught on the landing.
But I talked to the medics, they said he's gonna be all right.
Must have been a spark.
What?
You've been drinking.
You're going to blame this on me?
Tell me you haven't been drinking.
I got him down!
Say it!
I got him down alive! You don't blame this on me!
I did everything I could do!
Joe! Joe!
All back, Colonel.
The good news is Lieutenant Watkins survived the fireball landing.
He's in critical.
Do they think he's gonna make it?
Yes, sir.
With 60% third-degree burns.
We're sending him back home.
I brought the background on the captured flyer, Lieutenant Ray Gannon.
His mother's name is Dorothy.
Father is Thomas.
His wife's name is Thelma. They have a little girl, Adele.
In particular,
Ray loved to fly.
More than any pilot we have, he loved to be in the air.
You must be Lt. Gannon.
Welcome to Stalag 18.
You're the first of your kind we've had here.
I hope your stay will not be cut short.
Here is the new prisoner your captain requested,
Lieutenant Ray Gannon.
A pilot with the 332nd.
Where the hell did you come from?
Lieutenant!
Sit down.
So, I bet you're wondering why
I picked you to bunk with us.
It's not something
I care to think about.
Don't worry.
It's not so we can hang you or anything.
I chose you because I know you can't be a German spy, being colored and all.
We're in the middle of a rather delicate operation, and we don't need any new white faces.
You'll be treated no differently than any other man here.
Any problems, you tell me.
Come on! Let's go!
Move, move, move!
Line it up! Let's go!
I welcome you to the 332nd Fighter Group.
You're a long way from home.
Jerry's going down!
I'm telling you,
Lightning sunk it.
That is a destroyer.
Shit, Lightning's crazy!
Here it comes!
Whoo!
I came around for a second pass.
Watch this.
We fight! We fight!
We fight! We fight! We fight!
Mmm.
My best friend.
He...
He almost caused the death of one of our pilots.
I don't know what to do.
I am so glad I found you.
I want you to stop, Easy.
Stop what?
You can't drink on duty.
I told you, what happened to
Deke wasn't my fault, all right?
No one cares what you do when you're in town.
How you relax is your business.
This coming from a guy who flies like he has got some kind of death wish.
You're a piece of work, Joe.
You ignore me up there, then all of a sudden, you expect me to listen to you down here.
All right, all right, all right.
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
You promise to ditch the bottle,
I'll promise to fly right.
And follow my orders.
And follow your orders.
Happy?
Very happy.
I can't wait to hear her sweet singing!
You guys can go chase skirt.
I'm going to Sofia's.
What did you say, about three miles?
Odds of us getting pinched?
I won't even take that action.
Hey, flyboys!
That trouble. Keep walking.
Come on.
Don't just walk away from me.
He picked the wrong day.
Let's go.
Hey, come over here!
What?
You guys.
You're the Red Tails, right?
You know, Red Tails?
Colored boy flyers?
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say it like that, but who's asking?
Chester Barnes,
98th Bomb Group.
You guys flew a little top cover for us about a month ago.
A little run over Ploiesti?
It was the best goddamn flying
I've ever seen, gentlemen.
And we guys, well, we feel that we owe all you boys a drink.
Why don't you come and join us?
Come on.
Come and join them?
What's he saying?
Come on.
Drinks are on us.
Well, I'll be damned.
I guess the dance hall will have to wait.
How you doing?
Much obliged.
He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way.
He had a boogie style that no one else could play.
He was the top man at his craft.
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.
He's in the army now a-blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam.
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam.
The captain seemed to understand.
All right, boys, listen up!
These fellas are the Red Tails.
They're the guys who have been giving us an escort.
First drink is on me, fellas.
Whatever you'd like.
Hanson, Travis J.
Samuel George.
Me and the boys over here are with the 463rd Bomb Group.
Glad to meet you, man.
You flew with us over Brux
. Appreciate you getting us home.
Hey, have you guys run into any of those new jet pursuit fighters?
We haven't been that lucky.
Well, we've been that unlucky.
Those babies go so fast you can't even see them.
You know, we say "colored."
But that's not what you prefer?
No, no.
The word is...
"Negro."
When you get upset, when you get mad, you turn red, right?
When you get envious or sick, you turn green.
When you become cowardly, you turn yellow.
And y'all got the nerve to call us colored.
I want to ask you an important question.
Um...
Will you marry me?
Uh...
Time to think.
Oh.
Okay.
When you get to the other side, don't wait.
Just run for the woods, okay?
Go!
Remember, run for the woods!
It's Ray Gun, he's back with the batteries.
Any problems?
They won't even know they're missing.
Divide the batteries among those who have flashlights.
You've been a great help, Ray Gun.
I guess there's a lot more to you coloreds than I thought.
We want you to travel with us.
Oh, I can't. I'll stick out like a pig in a poultry shop.
I'll draw attention to you guys.
Thank you.
I'll go alone.
But...
Here, take my dog tags.
Get them back to my unit.
You're a wily sucker, Ray. At least they won't see you in the dark.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Safe journey, Captain.
Good luck, Ray.
Good luck.
Remember, run for the woods.
Okay, let's go.
- Run, Miller, run!
- Halt!
Halt!
Halt, halt!
Hot tamales, and they're red hot Yes, she got them for sale.
I got a girl, she's long and tall.
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feets in the hall.
Sticks on metal ain't music.
It ain't.
I like music.
Aww! Coffee, were you always mean as hell, or you just get like that with old age?
I once was a happy man. Never did not have a smile on my face.
That was before you guys started tearing up my beautiful planes.
I could tolerate the P-40s.
But these new babies getting beat up?
It breaks my heart.
Come on, Coffee. I only came back with two holes this time.
Uh. Six.
Six holes.
Well, that ain't nothing compared to what's gonna happen to you when you run into those jets those bomber jockeys was talking about.
I ain't afraid of no jets.
Don't go trying your old tricks, Lightning.
If you end up too close behind one of those jets, the turbulence alone will blow your black ass right out of the sky.
Trust me, I'm gonna be the first one to shoot one of those things down.
And I'll be the second.
My advice is, you see one, run like hell.
The only thing in life that makes me want to run like hell is you, Coffee.
That's gonna get you killed out there.
I'm not dancing with you.
The target is a tank factory on the outskirts of Berlin.
Shut that down, you shut down Jerry's ability to shore up a Berlin defense.
General Campbell's wing will be leading the bombardment.
You have recon on the area?
In the air, we're expecting everything the Luftwaffe's got,
100s, 109s, 190s.
A possibility of 262s,
German jet fighters.
Jet fighters?
The boys are gonna love this one!
The target area isn't your concern.
The 52nd will escort the
General's planes into Berlin.
Is there a reason, sir?
Sixteen hundred miles to Berlin and back.
The fighters need to take it in stages.
With external fuel tanks, the 51s can make it.
I guarantee our pilots can.
I'd prefer the Red Tails take the leg where we need protecting.
Our first major air offensive over Berlin.
From a propaganda point of view, a lot of attention gonna be paid to this and a lot of ink spilled.
And Negro pilots aren't part of that story.
Colonel, A.J.
This is coming from way above me.
If you didn't have my respect,
I wouldn't be talking to you face to face.
But we don't win this war, all my regard, everything that you and your men have done, none of it means a thing.
Colonel.
Please see to it that the
General gets to his plane.
Sir.
You like it?
I want you stay in Italia.
You want me to stay?
Does that mean...
Does that mean you'll marry me?
Yes. Marriage.
I love you.
I can't believe it.
I'm getting married.
Okay, we're going to throw it, all right?
There you go.
There you go. All right. Throw!
I'm looking for Captain Julian.
Right here.
You the one they call Easy?
I guess some people do.
What can I help you with?
I'm Captain Miller. I was in prison with Lieutenant Gannon.
He asked me to give his tags to you.
Four of us got out.
The deal was, if we made it and he didn't,
I'd get his dog tags back to his unit.
Ray was a good man.
To whoever it matters, you tell them from me.
Ray was the best soldier I ever met.
Thank you.
A moment, Colonel.
What is it, Captain?
Ray Gannon's dog tags, sir.
A soldier brought it by today.
He and Ray were prisoners together.
They got out from under the Germans, but Ray didn't make it.
Sir, Ray Gun wasn't fit when
I put him back in rotation.
The Flight Surgeon wouldn't clean bill him, so I talked my way right past him.
I just don't feel like I'm fit to lead the squad any more.
I've made so many mistakes.
No, you've made one big mistake.
That self-pity of yours, that's your weakness.
But it ends right here, right now.
You man up, you lead your squad.
Every decision that you make isn't gonna always be the right one.
All right, this is it.
For the first time, the bombers are going all the way to Berlin.
They'll be up against 109s and
262s the new jet fighters.
Unfortunately, we're only going to escort them on the first leg of their mission, so I don't expect you'll see much action.
You will rendezvous with the relief escorts at 0830.
I know this is disappointing to you.
It's not the job you wanted.
But those are your orders.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.
Spread the word, gentlemen.
Julian. A moment.
Captain, if your relief doesn't arrive, as squadron leader, it's your call.
If you think you can make it.
Sir.
That is all, son.
We're past the rendezvous point.
Tail gunner, has the
52nd squadron arrived?
No, sir.
No sign of them.
Anybody got eyes on our relief fighters?
Not a dang thing, Red One.
Are we going all the way, sir?
Fuel-wise, we're looking good.
But I'm guessing the hours there and back, it'll definitely be one for the record books.
Come on, Easy.
It's Berlin.
Let's go.
We can make it.
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.
Yeah! We fight!
Ha-ha! Watch out,
Hitler, here we come!
Just remember, we're here to protect the bombers.
Under all circumstances, we stay on mission.
What's that about?
I think we've got the Red
Tails for the duration.
By my reckoning, we're deep into Germany.
It's a little creepy we haven't seen any fighters yet.
Maybe they found out we were flying escort and decided not to show up.
That'd be nice.
Wouldn't mind that, would you, baby?
Colonel!
It's from Mission Control.
The 52nd didn't make the rendezvous.
They didn't join up with the 5th.
Did our boys turn back?
No, sir. They're headed on to Berlin.
I gave Captain Julian the option.
Headquarters wants to know if we're gonna call them back.
Yes, sir!
Show no mercy.
Oh, shit! Jets!
We got jets!
What the hell?
What? Oh, no!
Maurice!
Mama!
Break! Break! Break!
Here we go.
Nine o'clock low!
I see them.
We're losing them!
I got the throttle wide open!
They're too damn fast!
Son of a bitch!
Those babies are gone.
I'm losing power!
Stay left!
I'll get him!
This is for Maurice!
Yeah!
Brilliant!
Smokey, brilliant!
Easy, we got one crossing in front of us.
Start firing, he'll fly right into it.
I know.
I got him.
These jets ain't nothing.
We need more speed.
Let's get some altitude.
Easy, right there!
Ten o'clock!
I got him!
Now that's how it's done!
Smokey! Smokey!
I'm all right.
I'm all right!
I'll be damned!
They missed me!
No holes in me, baby!
Whoo! Come on.
Now we're losing power on engine four.
That's it for us, guys.
We're turning around.
We got a straggler.
Two o'clock.
Oh, I see him!
I'm on it, Red One. We'll get down there and cover him.
Lightning, form up.
I'm going back.
We got a crippled bomber to protect.
Easy, you got Pretty Boy on your tail.
I'm coming around.
Where? I don't see him!
Die, you...
...foolish African!
Damn it!
I'm heading right for you!
I've got him!
I've got him!
Get out of my way!
What the hell are you doing?
Dive right now! Dive.
Whoo!
That's the end of Pretty Boy!
Sure got him good!
Ha! You did it!
You got that son of a bitch.
Did you say Lightning shot down Pretty Boy?
Whoo-hoo!
Give 'em hell, Lightning!
You just might be the best pilot that ever lived!
Now get your ass back here and help us with this bomber.
We're on our way back to you, Joker.
It was a crazy move. You almost got yourself killed.
I think I did get myself killed.
What are you talking about?
I don't think
I'm going to make it, Easy.
What do you mean, you're not going to make it?
Don't talk like that!
There's a lot...
There's a lot of blood.
Listen to me.
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you back, all right?
Just stay focused.
I'm gonna help you.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Come on now. We've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
I screwed up.
I don't care about that.
I'm right here with you.
We can do this together.
Come on.
Easy.
Gruesome Twosome.
Lightning!
Lightning, talk to me!
Lightning, don't you do this to me!
Lightning?
Lightning, look at me!
I love you.
I'm sorry, Sofia.
Lightning, pull up!
Pull back on your stick!
Lightning, pop the canopy!
Pop the goddamn canopy!
Get out of the plane,
Lightning, that's an order!
Get out of the plane!
Damn you, Lightning!
Easy.
Easy.
Easy, do you read me?
Easy!
Stay on mission!
Do you copy?
We need you back here.
We need you.
For God's sake, tell me you still out there.
I'm okay.
I'm on my way down.
Red One.
Lightning's with you, right?
Lieutenant Little is dead.
Lightning?
Marty?
The expectations placed upon you men are high.
Lieutenant Little exceeded those expectations.
We should not be discouraged by his death, but be all the more encouraged by his life.
The acts of bravery by him will make us stronger.
It will inspire us to fight harder, to make this world free.
Because we are on the side of God Almighty!
Let us pray.
Hey! Hey, guys!
Hey! Guys!
I know you didn't forget about me already!
I've been to hell and back, so you will no longer call me Junior.
From now on you will address me as the fabulous Ray Gun.
How'd you do it, man?
I'll be damned!
Ray!
Ray Gun!
Boy, you look good.
In the name of the
President of the United States,

English - US - PSDH
Again!
I'll beat you this time.
- No way!
- I will!
- You think so?
- Yes!
- You do?
- Come on!
I gave you a chance last time.
Come on then.
3, 2, 1, go!
A SCREAMING MAN
Damn!
Told you!
I let you win before.
I let you win!
Champion!
It's me the champ!
I'm the champ!
Abdel!
Wait.
You know, a pool attendant should always wear white.
All my white t-shirts are dirty.
The machine's broken.
Hold it. Cheese!
Stop fooling around!
Come on, just one.
You take photos every day.
Why?
To document my life.
Your life.
Come on.
Careful, the boss!
Come on now, put the mattresses out.
Stretch your arms and bend your legs.
Back this way now.
Go, Lisa, go!
Well done!
Good, Lisa.
Keep going.
Go on, Lisa.
Well done!
I'm really worried.
Why? About the war?
About the hotel privatization.
Don't worry.
We've been working here for 30 years.
They can't do anything to us.
Come on, sit down.
We'll be fine.
Gardole!
Gardole!
Let me get you something to eat.
Gardole, come! Here boy!
There you go!
Eat!
Good dog!
Watch out!
You'll get us killed!
This morning, patriotic organizations held a meeting in support of the government forces to say no to rebel attacks on the peaceful population.
It took place at the N'djamena National Stadium.
All worthy citizens of the nation were present.
Tens of thousands of people attended the 2-hour meeting.
United together in a collective, the patriotic groups condemn the incessant rebel attacks perpetrated throughout Chad.
According to the collective's spokesman, the rebels are clearly a serious threat to the peace, the stability, and the country's development.
For this reason, the patriotic organizations exhort the international community to stop delivering arms to the rebels.
Hello!
Hello.
- Who is it?
- Your new neighbor.
The organizations are fully aware of their role and promise their unfailing support to the government forces and are ready to fight together to defend the country.
Do you have any onions?
Moreover, the collective's members salute the army's bravery and discipline.
The government forces have managed to rout the attackers who have left hundreds wounded and killed dozens of men.
The collective of patriotic organizations has also launched a solemn appeal for all peace-Ioving Chadians to mobilize and unite...
Hi, Dad.
Abdel!
Where were you?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Got troubles?
No.
If you have, you can tell me.
You can trust me.
I'm your father!
Dark horse!
Be off with you!
- My buddy!
- Champ!
How's things?
Why the long face?
Bad news.
Look.
If I'd bet 2 instead of 12,
I'd have all the numbers.
You wouldn't listen to me!
4 million, the winnings!
No!
If I'd have won, bye bye barrier.
Got any cola?
Well?
I've been fired.
Good morning.
How old are you, Adam?
No, sorry. 55.
I often see you sitting on your chair.
You take life easy.
That's good!
Mrs. Wang, you know, my son works very hard.
And I'm the boss.
I'm in charge.
Do you really think we need two employees at the pool?
You know, Mrs Wang, the pool's my whole life.
I was Chad's first pool attendant.
I was the central African swimming champion in 1965.
David, call the work tribunal!
Champ,
David can't beat Goliath this time round.
What'll become of you, David?
I'm not dead yet, Champ.
Life goes on...
As we say back in Congo,
"To be continued..."
Our problem is that we put our destiny in God's hands.
OK. Hold that. Like that, there.
OK? Go and get the same and come back here.
Got it?
That was fun today!
Really.
Let's take a photo.
Dad! What's up?
What are you thinking about?
About before.
Before.
Before what?
Want a lift home?
Abdel?
Abdel!
Yes?
No, and I won't be back for dinner.
Hi, Souad.
Did Mrs. Wang want to see me?
Did you see the boss?
Yes.
What did she say?
What did she want?
Well?
Answer me when I'm talking to you!
How are you, Champ?
I meant to come to the meeting last night, but...
But what?
I'm disappointed in you.
Really.
Bernadette, a beer!
You haven't paid your war contribution.
You want the rebels to overrun the country?
- It's not that, Ahmat.
- Champ.
Champ.
The war effort is everyone's duty.
Everyone has to help stop the rebels or we'll all be done for.
You're not for them?
Not at all, Ahmat!
Call me Chief, like everyone else.
Hello, Etienne.
What's the matter?
A problem?
What's wrong?
Unidentified armed rebels attacked... killing and wounding dozens of civilians.
Coming from over the border where they have their base, the rebels attacked harmless civilians.
The army has stopped their advance and inflicted a punishing defeat.
Chad strongly condemns these cowardly incursions.
Our country will not be destabilized by...
OK, coming.
You called for me?
Adam, this is very hard for me, but I have to do my job.
The pool is over.
What do you mean?
From now on, you are the hotel gatekeeper.
What?!
The pool is my life!
Calm down!
Keep your head!
They're shutting down the pool?
No.
Abdel will be the pool attendant.
Abdel?
Champ, chin up!
Dad.
Well...
Listen. Let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
Here's the key to the moped.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I really need this job too.
You know, I'm also...
I've got obligations too.
Dad!
Morning.
You're the one they call "Champ"?
I'm Masra, the new cook.
Gardole!
Hey, beat it! Scram!
Dirty animal!
He did no harm.
I hate dogs.
I'm allergic to them.
Damn hound!
I can't understand your silence.
I've prepared a nice meal and no one's saying a word.
You always compliment my cooking.
But tonight?
Not a word.
If there's something wrong, tell me.
Is it the food?
I don't like it.
That's all I can say.
Good evening.
Who is it?
Your neighbor.
May I ask you something?
Yes?
Do you have any salt?
Let me go and see.
Do you think I'm old too?
You've got some nerve!
Every time you come, it's to ask for something.
Show some restraint.
I don't know what's going on!
As soon as I go, you talk.
When I come back, silence.
No one's said a word about my cooking.
You won't answer me either.
You're determined not to talk?
How old is your son now?
He's 20.
Mine's 17.
Abdellah.
For the war effort,
I gave him to the army.
He'll be made a captain on his return.
A captain in the family, that counts!
He'll be made captain.
Or so they said.
I haven't told anyone else, Adam.
Keep it to yourself.
I have to go. I'm late.
Wait. Hold on.
It's not me who decides, you know.
It's not that I won't pay.
It's just that I'm broke.
You've got 3 days, Adam.
That's all I can do.
Come on. Good.
Now back the other way.
That's right. Great.
It's the heart acting up, Champ.
Just when you most need it, it goes and packs up.
Fickle thing, a heart.
How's the pool? Alright?
Fine. Just fine.
You hang in there, Champ.
I had it coming from the start.
But you...
You put up a fight!
Stand up for your rights.
Don't let them fire you.
I miss the hotel at times.
I don't understand, Adam.
I just don't get how you can fire a cook.
I mean, a cook like me, when I cook for people,
I cook from the heart, for people.
It's an act of love.
You're the best cook
I know, David.
Guess what Mrs. Wang said at my meeting.
She said:
Everyone complains you drink too much.
So I said:
People here talk too much because they've got nothing better to do.
Then, she said:
The clients complain about your cooking.
They say it's too salty.
So you know what I said?
Only when I'm in love,
Mrs. Wang!
Good morning, Mom.
Good morning, Abdel.
Did you sleep well?
Yes, thanks.
Have some coffee.
Smile!
Hey, Dad!
What's up?
Come on. Come and eat.
It'll do you good.
Dad!
You look like an old lion.
You're all... I dunno.
Give us a smile at least.
Want some coffee?
I'll bring you a coffee, OK?
- What's up with him?
- He's not feeling well.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is Abdel Ousmane here?
Yes. What do you want?
He's been drafted.
Wait! Wait a minute!
Adam, help!
He's my only son!
Adam, Adam!
Where's Adam?
For several weeks now, insecurity has reigned in the east.
Rebel incursions are on the increase.
Yesterday, fighting opposed rebel and government forces.
5 vehicles were destroyed and 37 rebels taken captive including a former
Chadian army officer.
The authorities call on all patriots to be vigilant, to stay alert and to denounce all enemies among us.
Hello!
Hello.
Hello there.
Is Abdel here?
Abdel...
I'm his girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Yes.
Welcome, my child.
Sit down.
Here you go.
Eat.
It'll cheer you up.
Eat, Adam!
What's the matter?
Tell me!
- David?
- Yes?
Do you believe God really exists?
I do believe in God, but...
I'm beginning to lose faith in him.
Come on, eat.
Eat up, please.
Eat.
Greetings Champ.
How are you?
You've got to eat something.
From now on,
I'm fasting until our son comes home.
There's nothing we can do but pray to God.
Heaven won't help us, Mariam.
What's your name?
Djénéba Koné.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
Where are you from?
From Mali.
What do you do?
I'm a singer.
A singer?
Yes.
All my family are artists.
I've been singing since I was six years old.
How did you meet Abdel?
I sing in a bar.
One night, at the end of the concert, he came to see me.
He invited me to dinner.
We've been together a year now.
I'm expecting his baby.
Eat, my child.
Where is Abdel?
You can live with us from now on.
You can have Abdel's room.
Thank you, mother.
Go on, eat up.
Ahmat! I've changed my mind about the army.
- Let go! I'm sick!
- Do something, please!
What shall I tell them?
You want them to think we're both traitors?
You know what they'll do to us?
I'll go in his place.
It's too late, Adam.
I wanted to go too in my son's place.
But they refused.
Too old.
Listen, Champ.
You know,
I'm tired too.
Sick and tired of this filthy job they make me do.
So tired.
Sorry, I have to go to the toilet!
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, son.
- Are you Abdel's father?
- Yes.
- Is he hurt?
- This is for his girlfriend.
- Is he alright?
- Yes.
- He's not hurt?
- No.
I have to go.
Have some tea with us.
I'm exhausted, thank you.
Just a cup!
My sweetheart, at last a minute to send you these words.
It is hell on earth here.
The heat, the dust, the terrible food.
We're fighting the rebels.
There have been deaths.
Two of my friends have been killed.
I'm scared.
I'm not going to die, my love.
All I can think of is deserting.
I'll come get you and we'll leave the country for good.
This is no future for our child.
I think of you and the baby all the time.
I wish I could hear your voice.
Try to send me a tape if you can.
I'm at the Abeche barracks for now.
Not for long.
We'll be sent to the front again soon.
I miss you terribly.
A kiss with all my love.
Everything OK, Adam?
I can rely on you, at least.
Thank you, Adam.
The rest of the staff haven't come in today.
Not even Souad.
She's gone.
In the southeast, there has been heavy combat between government forces and RPJ rebels, the Popular Rally for Justice.
The rebels claim to have taken two strategic towns, information immediately denied by the government.
Given the repeated attacks, as of today, a curfew has been declared throughout the whole country, from 6 pm to 6 am.
The government asks the population to remain calm.
Halt!
Where are you going?
Dismount!
Don't you know there's a curfew?
Hey, hold on!
It's Champ, the pool attendant.
- The what?
- The pool guy.
Don't you know him?
Go on, get home!
Quick!
Make it snappy!
Cool it!
Shoot!
Shoot damn it!
Wait! Hey wait!
Hold it! Wait!
Come here. Take it.
Take your bike!
Get going now. Fast!
Father.
I'm scared.
Go to bed now.
I'm here.
Good evening!
What is it now?
What do you need this time?
Nothing this time.
The rebels are approaching.
We're leaving for Cameroon.
I came to say goodbye.
- You're leaving?
- We are.
May God protect you.
You heard the neighbor.
They're leaving for Cameroon.
Everyone's fleeing. It's chaos.
Do something.
We can't just stay here.
What about my work at the pool?
I'm talking about life and death and you're worried about the pool?
Are you mad?
You've changed, Adam.
I don't recognize you anymore.
It's not me.
It's the world that's changed.
Champ! Champ!
Listen! Look here now!
Champ! Hey!
Back off!
That's right. Easy now.
Back off!
Come on, kids. Let's go!
Do not flee!
The situation is under control.
Keep calm!
Go about your business!
Go back home!
Go about your affairs!
The situation is back to normal.
Djénéba!
Hello, father.
What's the matter?
Abdel.
It was me who gave him to the army.
Abdel, my son!
Dad,
I want to go home.
That's why I came here.
We missed you, son!
Have a date.
A little rest and then home.
Djénéba and your mother are there waiting.
We'll all be together again.
- It's all over.
- Dad...
I know everything.
I want to swim.
In the river.
Abdel.
Abdel.
After twenty days of continuous bombing,
Nanking finally fell to the Japanese.
It was December the 13th, 1937.
I remember everyone was running that day, but no one could escape that heavy fog.
Major Li only had a few men left.
Nanking was no longer able to put up a fight, and those left behind, ran for their lives.
Stop counting.
Shu and two others are missing.
Let us in!
There's no room!
Find your own place to hide!
I said, there's no more room!
Let's go.
Keep going!
Hey.
There are people inside.
Who is there?
Come out!
Come out!
Bastards!
Go to hell!
Stop!
Turn around!
Turn around!
Don't move!
American.
From the refuge.
What?
American.
Not soldier.
John Miller.
Raise your hands!
Working at the church.
Raise your hands!
I said raise your hands!
Separated...
You separated from your families?
You... families... separated?
I'm... going to...
Winchester Cathedral.
You know where it is?
Where?
Mister.
Did you say...
Did you say "mister?"
Who said "mister?"
You speak English?
We are from Winchester Cathedral.
Say that again.
We are from Winchester Cathedral.
You're kidding?
We are students at the convent.
You going there?
Why do you want to go there?
I'm helping to bury your father.
Well, not your father father...
Father Ingleman.
Father Ingleman, yeah.
I'm helping burying him.
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off... to heaven or wherever.
You show me the way?
Peng, move to the flank, prepare to engage.
Damn it, are you deaf?
Major Li, we are the last ones left.
We should leave the city now.
Keep fighting.
Yes sir.
Got you!
Let's go.
Yes sir.
That way!
Up there, on the right!
On the left! Fire!
Cover them!
The Chinese army didn't have adequate weapons to destroy the enemy's tanks, so they employed a tactic from ancient warfare.
They formed a human shield to get a bomb close to the tanks.
At the time, the Chinese people couldn't bear the thought of losing their country, and such selfless acts were not uncommon.
Zhen!
Let me go!
Zhen!
Come on!
Father Ingleman... fly away.
Fly away?
On here, Japanese, bomb.
- He flew away with the bomb, right.
- Yes.
Why was the deceased out here?
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?
He said, bad smell.
He moved the body here.
Who's Gu?
Gu is our cook.
He ran away.
He leaves some students here.
Some students took away by parents.
Some students nowhere to go.
So who's inside?
Just you and the girls?
Just you and the girls.
Even without a body, you gotta pay me.
No.
No... You gotta pay me.
No.
That's the rule.
There's nothing I can do about it.
With what I came through,
I should raise the price.
So is the money inside?
No. No money.
Money? Inside?
No.
Come on.
There's no money inside?
No.
Let's look.
It's a Catholic church.
There's gotta be some cash inside.
No.
No?
You say anything but no?
Can you fix truck?
Help us.
Leave Nanking.
Fix this truck?
For free?
No.
I can take parts, sell parts.
You got tools?
No.
Let's get inside.
Zhen didn't even make a noise.
Even when they stabbed her over and over, yet she didn't make a noise.
It's all my fault.
It's not your fault.
It is your fault.
Your father promised to take us on a boat and leave Nanking.
Where is he?
He ran off.
We waited and waited and now the Japanese are here.
Now the Japanese are everywhere, and it's too late to go to the refuge.
Zhen died because of your father!
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Stop!
Stop fighting!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
I'm John. Hi.
I'm American.
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.
I know it's hard.
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.
You know you two... you've seen enough... seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.
I can't... um...
I'm not good with kids.
Let's go.
You want some flour? You like some flour?
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.
Buns.
Buns, whatever.
Let's go find the collection box.
Where?
- Upstairs?
- No.
Oh, nice.
Forget going back to the refuge,
I think I'm bunking here tonight.
He's grim, who's that?
Is that Father Ingleman?
Yes.
These North Europeans they're all like, you know, tuna, playwrights, not much fun.
Look at that face, he's ruining the...
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?
I can't have a priest staring at me
- while I'm sleeping.
- No...
My father.
Me... orphan... adopted.
I'm sorry.
But I just...
It's not good for me to have a priest staring at me while I'm sleeping.
I can't.
Please, I gotta just... there, better.
You got any drink around here?
No.
You're a church. You got wine, something?
Nothing.
Nothing?
- No.
- No, no...
That's a shaving kit.
What a jerk!
I said you are a jerk!
What did you say your name was?
George Chen.
George.
Tomorrow, you fix truck, help us.
Fix truck?
No money!
Money, George.
Gu.
Open the door, it's Ling.
Can you hear me
Gu.
Open up.
It's Ling.
Did you really make a deal with him?
Of course.
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought you here.
Gu.
Open the door, it's Ling.
Gu, have you gone deaf?
Someone's here.
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.
Go to the refuge on the west side.
Leave now, go to the refuge.
No, we're here for Gu.
Gu's not here.
Bullshit! Get out of my way!
Gu told me, this church is under Western protection.
The Japanese can't come in.
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free, he promised to let us stay.
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!
He's really not here.
How come?
He ran off this morning.
You should go to the refuge.
We're not leaving.
Hey! How dare you!
Hurry.
Go to the refuge!
To the refuge!
The refuge doesn't even have space left for maggots.
Please, have some mercy and let us in.
Don't jump.
They're from the red-light district.
What's that?
It means brothel.
They were the famous women of the Qin Huai River.
The myths surrounding them were as ancient as the city of Nanking.
That's a Westerner!
Is he a priest?
No way.
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?
Who cares, as long as he can protect us.
True.
Come up here.
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.
Long time not make bread.
Long time not make bread? No bread?
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.
These women quickly took over the cellar.
It was once a filthy, messy place, but within hours, they had transformed it into the Qin Huai River.
The fragrance of rouge and perfume danced up through the air.
I can smell the bread.
We are coming up!
I couldn't stop them.
Hello.
I remember when I first saw these women, they were tramps, parading around in their lingerie, not the graceful ladies that the legends of Qin Huai had portrayed them to be.
Look, this should be good.
George, you little shit, you said there was no wine here.
Excuse me.
What's he saying?
Holy hooch!
How dare you drink the wine!
Now the Westerner knows about the wine.
We sell the wine to raise money for orphans.
We're all orphans.
We also need help.
That's right.
What are they saying?
They said they're orphans!
Orphans?
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you, right now.
Adopt all of us?
You would not be able to cope.
You are not the only ones who speak English!
That's right!
You speak English?
The Westerner is a playboy.
Of course! Haven't you heard?
Westerners with beards are the horniest!
No wonder she is the top girl of the Qin Huai River.
Mo, use all of your skills.
Seduce him!
That's right.
Make the big nose go crazy for us!
My name is John.
And you are?
Yu Mo.
Yu Mo.
I like that.
So what do you and your companions do?
We are kindergarten teachers.
Really? Kindergarten teachers.
Shameless.
And you?
What do you do?
I'm also a kindergarten teacher.
So as, teacher to teacher, you wanna... get together and have a cup of joe, or...
What're those two yapping about?
Tell me.
Nothing. He's asking your price.
I told him.
He thinks you are too cheap.
There's no coffee.
Let's get liquored up.
Cheers.
The kindergarten fee is enough?
You coming?
I want you to take us out of Nanking.
Yeah.
Right.
We do this first?
I'm serious.
Why else you think we were flirting with you?
Out of Nanking, how?
I don't know how, but I know your face is the way out of here.
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.
Did you see it out there?
That's not happening.
No.
Cash enough?
Cause... let's...
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
Wait...
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.
Think about it.
If you help us,
I will thank you in ways you can never imagine.
All of us Will.
Can I get an advance?
The Japanese have posted a notice, whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.
I'll shoot you first.
Little bastard.
Open up. Carry that guy in.
Get up.
Get some water.
Hurry up!
What a temper.
He thinks he's so tough.
He thinks he's a hero.
Since he's fighting the Japanese, protecting Nanking and women like us, he feels he is entitled to have a temper.
Women like us need to hide here.
But if he hides here, he's a coward.
True.
Yeah, what a sissy!
Got scissors?
Thanks.
- You ruined my dress!
- Don't touch him!
Save your attitude for the Japs.
They are searching for
Chinese soldiers like you.
You are endangering us!
There are convent girls here, too.
Understand?
Towel.
What a handsome face.
Dou has good taste in men.
I mean he looks like my brother.
Are you hot for him?
No, he really looks like my brother.
You have a crush on him.
No, I don't.
Dou, cool off.
He doesn't even have hair down there!
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.
He's called Pu Sheng.
He's just a child.
Why are you leaving him with us?
Get some cloth, tighten the bandage so he won't bleed too much.
It's the best I can do.
I want him to be in a warm place before he dies.
Thank you.
Please wait.
What do you want?
We have sharp tongues, and we were very rude.
I hope you can forgive us.
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.
Mo.
Like me as a priest? Do you?
I dressed up for you.
I got a chance now?
Is he the priest?
Does he belong to the church?
You can say that.
What, the bank's closed for me, but he gets...
He gets a special soldier discount or something?
Please tell him, the students can't end up in the hands of the Japanese.
Otherwise my men would have died for nothing.
What's wrong with you?
I want to help you.
I've joined the priesthood.
Stop it. It's not the right time.
You don't want cash.
You want me to save you.
I'm gonna save your soul.
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.
Blessed are thee among women.
Blessed are thy lips, blessed are thy eyes, blessed are thy hips...
Don't.
And thy gams, and thy chest...
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- I gotta...
Stop it!
You drunk bastard!
This is a house of love not war, you get out of here.
Who's he really?
An idiot. Don't mind him.
Fine, I'll leave now.
See,
I'm the only man for you.
You're such a fool!
If it wasn't for your foreign face...
I like it when you're angry.
I wouldn't even look at you!
Harder.
I'll never be into you.
Come here.
Get off me!
I love that!
I love seeing you walk away.
I love seeing that ass.
Mo!
Mo!
That night,
Major Li didn't go far.
He stayed at the paper shop across the street.
I know, he could have changed into civilian clothing and fled.
I said you can't go in!
Little sister, we won't shit or piss in there.
We just want to wash up.
We always wash before bed-time.
Bed-time?
Morning for you is night for us.
Little sister...
Don't call me sister!
You want to start a fight?
The bathroom is for people.
You mean we are not people?
You know what you are!
You've got some nerve!
We won't share the bathroom with you!
What a temper!
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.
What the hell?
She's humiliating us.
She thinks we are filthy.
Little bitch!
You're the bitch!
Watch your mouth!
Ling, want to see a good fight?
Really?
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.
Let's pull down your pants and see what you are made of.
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!
Let's find out if you really are cleaner than us.
Stop it! It's not fair!
I don't have to hit you,
I can just crush you with my butt!
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.
I won't let you go in!
Stop fighting!
What's going on?
Stop!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
We are just kids!
Hua, that's enough.
No, it's not over!
I won't let you go in!
Japanese!
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!
Search the yard!
Split up!
Hurry! Go to the cellar!
Come in, hurry!
Don't shut it, let the girls in.
Let the girls in!
Hurry!
Don't move!
Lieutenant Asakura!
Come over here!
Upstairs!
Hurry!
Let's move the shelves!
There are girls here!
Search everywhere!
Capture them alive!
Lieutenant Asakura!
Come up here!
We've got virgins!
Hurry!
Stop!
Girls! Girls!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
This is a house of the Lord!
These are children!
You are breaking the laws of man and of God!
No soldiers here!
You have no business being here!
I am the priest!
And I command you, in the name of the Father to leave now!
Girls, you come up here now!
Come up these stairs, and stand behind me.
You're honorable men, behave honorably!
I'll eat you up.
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!
Stop this! Don't...
Chinese soldiers!
Get them!
Let's go!
Assemble outside! Roll call!
Prepare for combat!
The sniper is across the street!
To your left!
It's a trap! Find the enemy!
Damn it!
He's in the building there!
Use the grenades!
Behind us! Fire!
Keep firing!
Hold your fire!
Wait!
Fire!
First platoon to the back gate!
Second platoon to the front gate!
Colonel, he used to work for the traffic department.
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.
Having him can be useful.
Speak Japanese?
Yes.
Were our soldiers here recently?
Are you the resident priest?
Yes.
Father,
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.
Please understand.
In the middle of a war, occasional unfortunate behavior is inevitable.
Your church is very beautiful.
How do you do?
Are you students here at the convent?
So sorry to have caused you alarm.
Please... don't hurt the children any more.
Naturally.
My name is Hasegawa.
I am responsible for the safety of this area.
Please do not worry... about the security of the church and the students.
I apologize... but I have no confidence... in that assurance.
My guarantee is effective.
From now on,
I shall post armed guards in front of the church to protect you all.
There is not a lot of food in Nanking at the moment.
I hope the students will not go hungry.
May I?
Thank you.
Did you like it?
This is a Japanese folk song,
"My Home."
It is about hills and rabbits, and streams full of fish.
It is the most beautiful song in the world for those who are homesick.
Do the students sing well?
Very well, yes.
That's good.
I shall come back in a couple of days to hear them.
Why?
No reason.
I happen to love music.
Father, we shall meet again soon.
I hope you will not be lonely buried together.
Father John.
You won't leave us, will you?
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.
Sorry.
If we hadn't fought with that girl, she would still be alive.
This is all our fault.
Thank you.
Why not answer Shu?
She called me Father John.
We all need you.
I'm a mortician.
You are priest.
No.
- If we have a priest...
- George.
Maybe Japanese... not dare...
You are priest!
George, I'm not.
I'm not a priest.
I'm not!
I stayed here, because I was looking for your cash.
And because that's the nicest bed that
I've slept in in years. I didn't get there.
But is that like a priest?
I'm not a priest!
I'm not.
I took catechism lessons as a kid.
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk, which I am as often as I can be.
You not be priest.
Tell girls yourself.
You little shit!
You are.
We've heard about what happen today.
So you're staying?
Yeah.
Even though you were a drunk bastard last night, what you did today makes you a hero.
I'm sorry about last night.
Yeah.
I can't leave them by themselves.
And that little shit has a way of just... you know.
What do you think the Japanese are up to?
Are they really here to protect the students?
We were counting on having you help us leave Nanking.
But I guess now you'll have to stay here and be a priest.
Yeah, right.
Priest.
Actually, I came to tell you, our offer is still good.
We still want you to help us escape.
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.
Just now the ladies were having a bet.
They said that hero or no hero, you don't stand a chance when you're up against a beauty like me.
Don't flatter yourself.
We'll see.
Did you like it?
I only have one string.
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.
You're Pu Sheng.
Born in the Pu region?
My family is also from there.
When you're healthy,
I'll take you to the biggest dance hall, to see the prettiest girls.
Thank you.
Little hometown fellow, don't thank me, marry me.
I'll work in the fields with you.
I don't have... fields.
What do you have then?
I don't have anything.
Then I'll play my pipa everyday.
When I play, you hold out a bowl.
We'll beg for food and feed your mom.
I don't have a mother.
Everyone in my family is dead.
If you had just come with me, this wouldn't have happened.
You were so stubborn, and wouldn't leave without your classmates.
How could I have gotten that many boat tickets?
Because of you,
I'm staying in Nanking.
Tell me, what's this?
Explain to me, why do you do this?
If I don't do this,
I can't survive.
I'm doing this for you.
You must believe me,
I would never do anything bad.
Daughter,
I will find a way to get you out of Nanking.
No wonder there were no boat tickets.
Traitor!
You work for the Japanese?
Since I cannot save my country, cannot save others,
I can only try to save myself.
I'm already doing my best, you know.
Do you think it's easy working for the Japanese?
It's good you work for the Japanese, that helps us.
What is your plan for your daughter?
I would like to try, and use my connections with the Japanese to get my daughter out of the city.
Not to the refuge?
The refuge?
It's not safe there at all!
What's your plan for the rest of the girls?
Mr. Meng?
I have this truck.
If I can get the right tools, then maybe I can get it started.
Can you help me?
I have a list here.
Mr. Meng.
I need these tools.
Can you help me get them?
You're the only one who can get them for me.
I need these tools.
I need these tools.
Take this.
Take this.
If I fix the truck...
If I fix the truck, what then?
How would I know?
Wait, wait.
If I fix the truck, what would I need then?
Of course you'll need a permit.
I need a permit?
I need a permit.
Don't look at me.
It's too risky!
Even if you fix the truck, how would you get past the Japanese guards?
I don't know.
I don't know how long the guards will stay here.
But I want to get that truck started for when they leave.
It seems that you know more than just drinking.
I don't think she likes seeing us together.
She has a crush on you.
Really?
You know, I was like her.
Yeah?
I was at a convent for six years.
That's where you learned your English?
What happened?
Just another story of misfortune.
It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.
Yeah, it would.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I was never meant to be like this.
Never mind.
You know what?
I was the best in my English class, but everyone used to mock me.
They said I put on airs and graces and acted like I was the Queen of England.
Well, that's not what you were going to tell me, but...
So... the Queen of England.
You mean you're not?
I thought... yeah.
Like Shu, I too had a crush on someone.
But he was a young, fresh-faced guy, got the most beautiful eyes, not a dirty, bearded man like you.
OK.
It's rotten.
Sister.
Sister.
What are you saying?
Sister...
Hurry...
Pu Sheng,
I'm here.
Thunder...
What are you trying to say?
Rain...
Rain...
What rain?
It's death weeping for you.
The wheat is drying outside...
Don't let it get soaked.
That was the soldier that the officer brought.
I heard he was about our age.
Which officer?
The officer who saved us that day.
He hid the soldier inside the cellar, and the women were taking care of him.
Actually those women from the brothel... are not that bad.
Where's Dou?
Lan's missing too.
Really?
Haven't seen them for a while.
Are they still in the cellar?
Have you seen Dou?
Dou and Lan got out.
How?
Where did they go?
Dou insisted on getting pipa strings.
She wanted to play the pipa for Pu Sheng.
She said he had a hard life, and he was like her brother.
She wanted to play something nice for him, but one string wasn't enough, she needed three more.
What about Lan?
Why did she go?
She said she left her earrings behind.
How could they leave?
The Japanese are guarding the gates.
I don't know how they got out.
They disappeared when it was dark.
Dou said that if she didn't go soon it would be too late for him.
Why didn't you stop them!
I tried, but it didn't work!
What happened?
Dou and Lan snuck out on their own.
Dou and Lan?
How? How did they leave?
I don't know.
You know when?
No.
Where did they go?
They went back to our brothel to get pipa strings.
You want me to... go find them?
Yeah.
Mo, I'm not sure...
Please.
Please. Please!
Alright, it's safer for me than anyone else, so I'll try.
I'll try.
If I can leave. If they let me leave.
Candles, food.
There is no food.
They need food.
With no food.
No singing.
Hasegawa asks girls to sing.
Sing for the girls.
Hasegawa asks.
But no singing with no food.
And candles for Hasegawa.
I go get food.
Girl sing. Hasegawa happy. Yes?
I go now.
George, you're not coming.
I go, for food?
Yes?
George, you're not coming.
Go back inside!
Yes?
Make Hasegawa happy.
Go!
This is fine, I go. Thank you.
Officer, is he allowed to leave?
We've been told not to let the girls leave.
But he's the priest.
Terry?
Terry.
John?
I tried getting back,
I tried getting back to the refuge.
I got stuck.
I couldn't get back.
I was trying to get back. I'm sorry.
I thought you were... I figured you were dead.
I'm looking for two women, they got shiny dresses.
I need to find them. They are in trouble.
Why are you dressed like this?
What is this?
I got drunk, I woke up, I was just... dressed as a priest.
Who is this?
This is George. This is George.
Have you seen them?
Seen who?
The women!
There're women piled up all over the street.
You haven't seen them?
No, I haven't seen any women. No.
You think it's safe to be looking at the women right now?
Can you help me with tools?
Tools for what?
I gotta fix a truck.
Fix a truck for what?
I gotta help George,
I gotta help some girls,
I gotta help some women, they're prostitutes, and I gotta help them.
What? Are you kidding me?
You're talking about prostitutes and trucks, and tools.
I'm talking about not dying in China.
I'm leaving right now.
You're leaving Nanking right now?
Do you wanna go?
There's a boat. It's waiting for us.
I'm leaving right now!
If you wanna go, then let's go!
It's your last chance.
I gotta find them.
I can't leave.
Are you kidding me right now?
I'll see you, Terry!
I'll see ya.
Take off your coat!
Hurry!
They went that way.
Those are their coats.
Look! Those are young girls' coats!
The girls can't be far.
Oh no, I dropped the strings!
Forget it.
No, I have to find them.
Over there!
Don't shoot!
Lan!
Lan!
Don't run!
Bitch!
Go to hell!
We'll deal with her later.
Let's catch the other one.
Let's go!
Here she is!
Why am I always the last one?
You shouldn't have shot the other girl.
It's not fair!
Hurry!
Fuck you!
Fuck you all!
Bitch! You bit me!
I'll kill you!
What an idiot! You got bitten!
You can only handle the dead one upstairs!
Is it? George, yes?
Is it?
Is it?
Yes?
Stay there, stay there.
They were on their way back.
It was a stray bullet or... maybe...
I don't know.
I don't think they suffered.
I don't think so.
Is that true?
Yes.
He said
Dou and Lan were hit by stray bullets that they didn't suffer.
Come in.
George.
Come in. George.
It's me.
I only have two minutes.
The guards finally let me in.
These tools you need.
Thank you.
Now, listen to me.
- This permit was for my daughter.
- Right.
But I can't carry out my plan.
You are my only hope now.
The Japanese don't trust me any more.
You are a Westerner.
You can help her.
My daughter wouldn't leave without her classmates.
Please think of a way to get her out of Nanking.
The permit is only good for a short time.
When you manage to leave the church, remember, head west.
There's a way out of the city there.
I have to go.
Thank you, Mr. Meng.
Mr. Meng, thank you.
Mr. Meng, with your connections... is there anything else you can do for us...?
No, no, sorry.
John,
I'm handing my daughter over to you.
I have promised her mother,
I'll take good care of her.
OK.
Please.
Mr. Meng, thank you.
Thank you for this.
You are a good man.
In the eyes of my daughter,
I'm a bad man, a traitor.
No.
Thank you.
Damn Mosquito, her cat ran off.
She went up to look for it.
Good.
You sing very well.
Haven't I told you?
You can't come out!
Officer, this student has lost her uniform.
Because we wanted to look our best today, we asked her not to participate in the performance.
Please forgive the intrusion.
Father,
I would like to announce some good news.
Tomorrow our division is celebrating the successful occupation of Nanking.
Esteemed Father, on behalf of all the officers,
I would like to invite your church choir to perform and celebrate with us.
This is the official invitation.
They are asking us to sing at a party tomorrow.
This is a very kind invitation,
Mr. Hasegawa.
However, unfortunately, the children will not be able to attend.
Why not?
Sir, they're very young.
I'm not sure that it is appropriate for them to attend an adults' party.
As their guardian and protector, that's my responsibility.
But we thank you very much.
I am sorry.
This is an order from above.
I cannot disobey.
Sir.
Please think about the girls.
I can see that you are a man with culture.
Last time you played us a beautiful song, for people far from home.
You missed the rivers and hills.
Please consider that theirs have been destroyed, they have no home, nothing.
They are living in hell.
With this invitation, you are asking them to celebrate that.
I know that you understand.
With respect, sir,
I cannot allow that. I think that is...
I think that is brutal, sir.
Please remember, tomorrow at four in the afternoon, a car will come to pick up the students.
I am carrying out military orders.
Mr. Hasegawa, you tell me what will happen at these celebrations.
Mr. Hasegawa.
You said you posted guards for our security.
Have you been keeping these girls locked up until these celebrations?
The children cannot go.
Mr. Hasegawa.
Mr. Hasegawa!
The children cannot go!
The children cannot go!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, night, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
All, must go!
Father John, what do the Japanese want us to do?
Do they want us to sing?
Yeah.
I'm not a student.
I don't have to go.
Well, I'm not a student.
I won't go.
You have to!
The Japanese have counted you!
I don't care, I won't go!
You have to go!
Now you're saying you aren't a student.
Why didn't you tell the Japanese earlier?
Stop staring at me!
Save your attitude for the Japanese!
Do you think the Japanese really invited you to sing?
Dream on!
What do they do all day in Nanking?
They murder, burn, and rape!
You know?
Go ahead and go, but I won't go!
Mosquito, you shut up!
You are all mean to me!
I'm not going!
That's not true what she said.
These men are different from the others.
These men are educated.
They are officers.
These men are gentlemen.
I've been to things like these before, and... it's nice.
It's elegant, it's a...
It's a party.
There's nice things at parties.
There's cakes and there's flowers and there's chocolates and there's dancing... and there's... all of these things, which are lovely.
Please don't think about what she said.
I'm a terrible dancer, and maybe one day one of you could teach me how to dance. That would be nice.
Please don't think about that.
Because that's not true.
I... lied to you as well.
Your two friends who went for the pipa strings, they weren't shot.
I'm sorry.
I think you already knew.
Yes.
Sometimes, the truth is the last thing we need to hear.
I heard what you said to the girls.
What are you gonna do?
I gotta get the truck started.
And after that?
I have an idea.
Maybe I can save one of them, with your help.
How?
The Japanese thought
Mosquito was one of the girls.
She tricked them.
Why can't I?
No.
If you're saying what I think you're saying, no.
That's not happening.
Remember? Like them,
I was at a convent for six years.
But unlike them,
I was raped by my stepfather when I was thirteen years old.
By their age,
I was already forced to take my first clients.
I don't want them to go through that.
But I can't let you do that, Mo.
I can't let you do that.
What are you doing?
Get back in.
You can't leave.
Get back in!
Get in there!
What are you doing?
Go back!
I said go back in!
I will be the first.
Remember who's in front of you.
When we go, we will stick to this order.
Shu, isn't there a better solution?
No.
We won't let the Japanese hurt us again.
Girls.
Shu!
Wait, just...
Go away!
Come down!
OK, OK.
Stay back, OK.
Don't do anything foolish!
So many people have died.
Even hell is packed.
Why should you add to the crowd?
Shu, don't do this.
You can't do this!
We can't just throw our lives away.
Life is a sacred gift.
It's not ours to throw away.
Keep away! Step back!
OK.
We're stepping back.
Come up!
Didn't we say we are going to jump together?
UP here!
Come up now!
Listen to me, Shu, I have an idea.
I will go in your place.
Tell the girls to get down.
Tomorrow I will go for you.
Did you hear me? I will go in your place!
What? Who is going in who's place?
I will also go for you.
Right, we will all go instead of you.
We can handle the Japs.
We will protect you.
We will replace you!
Don't worry, you have us to protect you.
Yes, we won't let the Japanese hurt you.
Do you hear us?
We will go in your place.
Come down and don't jump.
Come down.
We're telling them the idea I told you about.
It's a good idea. That's it, girls.
Shu, come here, it's a good idea.
We can trick the Japanese.
Alright? We'll make it fun.
Come down, we think about it.
We just come down, and think about it.
We can make it work.
We only said it so they would get down from the tower.
But you shouldn't have lied to them.
Hua, remember?
If you weren't lied to, you wouldn't have ended up in a brothel.
Shut up! Mosquito.
I'm not stupid.
If nobody goes you'll still have to go.
You were counted by the Japanese!
Unless the Japanese are insane,
I don't think they will kill us.
They just want pleasure.
That's what we do.
We have experienced all kinds of men.
As long as we can get out alive, we will find a way to survive.
Ling, how do you expect the girls to handle the Japanese?
Even if they make it back alive, they won't be able to carry on.
I just don't think it's worth it.
They wouldn't even let us use the bathroom, yet, we're supposed to kiss their asses, and sacrifice ourselves for them?
I don't want to hear your nonsense.
If Shu hadn't diverted the Japs the other day, where would we all be right now?
Remember how the ancient poem describes us?
"Prostitutes never care about a falling nation,"
"they sing and dance while others are dying."
You are not so foolish after all.
I'm impressed.
Mo just taught me those two lines.
Of course we should remember the poem that criticizes us.
But, I think, we should do something heroic, and change the old way of thinking.
Mo, others say I always follow your lead,
I say, we share the same life.
Whatever you say,
I will go with you.
I will go too.
Me too.
Count me in.
Mo, we worked together for three years, and you were always more popular than me.
I know, you always looked down on me, and I never respected you either.
Well, today I hear you.
I say we all go, so we can look after each other.
Mo, you are right.
People say
"whores are heartless."
So tomorrow, let's do something honorable with our hearts.
We will all go.
If they went, how would the Japanese treat them?
Will they tear their clothes?
Will they beat them?
What if the Japanese rape them?
Are you kidding?
No.
Have you seen these women?
Those Japanese don't stand a chance.
These women... these women are formidable.
Brave, exquisite, skillful.
They've got character, like nobody I've ever met.
The Japanese?
They're amateurs, amateurs.
These women, they are professionals.
Father John, what exactly do they do?
You know... they...
They love and they hate, just like all of us.
Maybe they know more about it than any of us.
These women if they came face to face with the devil himself, he'd be putty in their hands.
These idiot? These soldiers?
You think they're scary?
They're not scary.
If you think somebody's scary, you picture them with their pants around their ankles, sitting on the crapper, alright?
Picture that.
Not so scary then.
These women, and you girls, you gotta strength and beauty that will never die.
So don't you worry about them.
Don't worry about them.
But... but they don't look anything like us, how can they go?
That's where my powers come in.
I don't do much very well.
But that, that I do well.
And I'll make them look like your twins.
You'll see.
Father John,
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.
Shu, you don't have to be sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
No, I was wrong.
What is it?
From the first day she came here,
I felt uncomfortable.
I thought she was not good.
I even thought both of you were not good.
That's ok.
I want to say to her, sorry.
And say to you,
I'm sorry.
You don't have to say you're sorry.
You got nothing to be sorry about.
I had seen many people pray before, but that night, the sight of
John's back as he prayed would stay with me for the rest of my life.
They brought new uniforms.
Our old uniforms were torn, so I brought you new ones.
Father Ingleman wanted us to wear them for Christmas.
You don't mind me wearing it?
The sleeves are short.
Try it on.
Big sister.
I can't button it up for you.
I'm already skinnier from starvation.
You are not built like a student, more like a student's wet nurse!
I have an idea, to fool the Japanese, let's use the curtains to make the uniforms fit, and tear up the sheets to wrap our chests.
So, our boobs won't pop out.
What're we doing, George?
What're we doing?
Listen, your God teaches, everybody's born equal, right?
So, the women, the girls, which?
What would you do?
We must.
What else we can do?
He gave me these bracelets so I would go with him.
I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.
I should have.
I was so stupid.
You would be even more stupid wearing them to meet the Japs.
Leave them here.
Fine, they are yours now.
When I was your age,
I had already served countless men.
Little sister, remember to give this back to me.
I will use the money to buy myself out of my contract.
Big sister, I'm sorry.
Live a good life for me.
I don't have any things of value, that cat is all I have.
He ran away the other day.
Little sister, promise me, you will find him.
OK.
Remember Dou?
She wasn't much taller than you.
Please take good care of it.
This is Dou's life.
She wanted to play "The Qin Huai View," and for that she was killed.
The Qin Huai View
Is that a beautiful song?
That's our signature song at Jade Paradise.
Why don't we sing it for Dou?
It was her dying wish after all.
Let's sing it for the girls, so they remember us at our best!
"I have a story,"
"and let me put it into song."
"I hope every one of you"
"can listen to me patiently."
"Allow me"
"to sing the legend of the Qin Huai River,"
"slowly and passionately,"
"for each one of you."
"Ever since the ancient era,"
"the river has been flowing gracefully."
"it is the beauty of the South,"
"the elegance of Nanking."
"Walk in the famous Zhan Palace,"
"enjoy the spectacular architecture."
"Look at the Colony of Cranes"
"with water rippling all around."
"What a paradise this is."
Mo, would...
You look so sweet.
Would you mind... lying down?
I'm just not used to...
People who can sit?
Right, people who can sit.
Would you mind?
I understand, I don't mind.
So madam, what will it be?
Fourteen years old?
How about thirteen?
Until thirteen I was a good girl.
Very good.
Thirteen it is.
So I'll straighten your hair, cut it in a bob.
I have an idea,
I think it'll be beautiful.
This is what we need.
It's perfect.
The way you are now, is what I like the best.
I see you.
I see everything that you've been through.
And I want all of that, Mo.
I want all of it.
I love it.
I love it all.
Are you going to fall in love with me?
I already have.
I can do this.
Sorry, these are not my clothes.
I wanna promise you something.
When this war is over,
I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna take you home.
No.
After tonight, my body will no longer be mine.
Take me home now.
Wow, Mo!
He can turn back time.
He chopped away five or six years!
Three more chops and we'd all be infants, so we can start our lives over again!
Have you asked him, where he learned such skills?
Mo, ask him to cut our hair too.
They all want you to give them a makeover.
My pleasure.
Glad to serve you.
Here.
He has to work with you lying down.
Right, he's a mortician, he only knows how to work on dead people.
Are they disturbed... by the way I work?
Sorry.
He hopes you won't mind.
Whatever, who cares?
I just want to look like a pretty schoolgirl.
Give me a coat.
His hands are so soft.
Mo, did he really work on the dead?
Mo, we're going to sleep.
Wake us up when it's our turn.
You've done this your whole life?
For five years.
You do this very well.
It matters.
It matters to me.
Before my daughter died, she made me promise to make her beautiful again.
That was the first time.
It's important.
It's important work.
I'm sorry.
She would have been twelve.
Like the girls.
Yeah.
Mo, he's amazing!
If only my mother were alive, she would have been so happy to see me like this.
She said, we never had a scholar in our family.
Now you are a scholar, so am I.
My mother wouldn't recognize me either!
Of course not.
We are now students.
Let's line up.
Mo, let him see if we all look like students.
No need to count, we only have twelve.
We are one short.
How many did the Japanese say?
How many?
Thirteen.
How many?
Thirteen. We only have twelve here.
This is a terrible joke.
One of the students still has to go!
We did all of this for nothing!
I will go.
What did he say?
I will go.
George.
He said he would go.
What are you talking about?
You are a boy!
Father Ingleman ask me to protect students.
But I'm not good.
I'm... I'm terrible.
I'm... I'm bad.
Who cares if we are one short?
We will just say that one of us has died from an illness.
My grandma told me that the Japanese can't count.
We can't do that!
The Japanese are very astute!
They will search everywhere, and it will be the end for the students!
There is nothing you can do.
They will see that you are a boy.
You can't fool them.
Yes, it's too obvious.
It's a short distance from the church to the car.
If I am made-up as a girl, lower my head, and walk right behind you all,
I'm sure the Japanese won't notice!
If we have one missing, the Japanese will find out, then... a big trouble.
You are good at make-up.
You can do for me.
George, I'm not that good.
No, you can.
George, stop it.
- It can't work.
- You can!
The church to the car just a short way!
You are good at make-up, you can do for me!
I will lower my head!
It's possible, it just a short way!
You can.
It's possible.
You know what could happen?
Yes, yes, I know.
I can do what Father Ingleman tell me.
Amazing.
I think I hear what the Father is saying right now.
Yes?
Yeah.
What he saying?
I think he's saying... that you've done an incredible... an incredible job, taking care of the girls.
And that you're good, so good.
And I think he's also asking... what the hell are you doing... with that awful wig on your head?
This was the last time I saw George Chen.
When he was six years old, and almost died of starvation,
Father Ingleman saved him.
He rang the church bell, swept the floor, and worked in the kitchen.
We used to laugh at him, whenever he spoke in English or in Nanking dialect.
You know that, you can't really go there.
You gotta escape somehow before you get there.
You gotta jump from the car or the truck or whatever.
You wait until it slows down, goes around the corner, that's when you jump.
No, I'm no jumping.
Don't teach me.
Why not?
If I jump,
Japanese will find out.
I will go all the way, give you more time. You and the girls get out of the church.
Hide your weapons well.
Don't let the Japanese see.
Don't worry, at least we will get an eyeball.
Have you got something as well?
Following our commander's order,
I'm here to pick up the students.
Here is a gift bag from our troops.
Please accept it.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Kato.
Have you spoken with Colonel Hasegawa?
My daughter, she doesn't have to go, right?
The order is from the chief commander.
Even Colonel Hasegawa can't interfere.
Get out.
Mr. Kato.
But you promised to help.
Shut up!
The chief commander is in charge.
Look, he sent troops just for this.
We can't do anything.
But we had a deal.
I have given you all of my valuables.
Mr. Kato.
Please, you promised!
When did I take your things?
That was for our military expenses.
Then I'm begging you, please allow me to see my daughter one last time.
I'm not a student. I won't go!
I won't go!
I'm not a student!
Isn't that your daughter?
What is she saying?
Why is she shouting?
I'm not a student!
I won't go!
Be gentle with her, she's just a girl.
You've seen your daughter.
Let's go.
Come on.
Shu.
Come here.
Your father is a good man.
We could never have done this... without your father.
He's a good man.
Watch your legs.
John told me that his biggest regret was that, because we had to get out as quickly as possible, he couldn't give my father a proper burial.
Is this good for me to go through?
What's on the truck?
Empty wine cases, but... four of them are full. They are... very good, very good.
Here.
You see, vintage.
If you would like some.
Open it.
These.
Take.
Until this day
I still don't know what happened to the women of the Qin Huai River.
I never learned all of their names, and never saw them being taken away by the Japanese.
So, I always imagine...
I imagine myself standing by the large round window, watching them walk in once again.
How did they do that?
Cool! How did she do that?
Can you see any strings?
Ohh!
Hey, listen, Dad's got to go to his meeting now.
Can you pass it on to Mum?
But we haven't had the cake yet.
No, I know. Look, I've got to pay the bills, haven't I?
Ew, ew.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
Dad has to go.
I can't do it.
He can't do it.
He can't do it.
He can't do it.
Tom's too shy to tell her, Dad.
OK, don't worry about it.
I'll see you later, OK?
See ya.
- If it was real Aussie blood...
- That's Dad. Hang on, hang on.
Where are you?
I'm just turning onto the Eastern.
The traffic's crazy.
Don't forget the sparklers.
They're on the bench beside the water bottles.
Alright.
Yeah, I just didn't see you leave.
Oh. Mr. Blonden was about to be cut in two. It was a tense moment.
- OK, make a wish, honey.
I wish that the Ravens would win tomorrow!
A man equally at home designing the award-winning
Gordon Institute of New Technology as he is with the exquisite restoration of this iconic Victorian building.
Mr. Premier, ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Professor David Hagen.
We took out the hydrangeas.
Apparently they're the ex-wife's favourite flower.
She had good taste.
And the bride's allergic to lilies.
We'll just have to make sure there's some tissues handy, won't we?
What time are the photographers coming?
Midday. And is this how you want the orchids?
Almost.
Needs a lot more hyacinth, though.
- We'll get onto it right away.
- Gotta go.
OK. Go, the Ravens.
- Looks beautiful!
- Thank you.
That's it, keep going.
That's it.
- Come on, Ravens!
- Good kick. Well played.
Spread around, boys.
Pass it.
- Good kick, son. Well played.
- Go for it!
Jack, get in there. Get in there!
Hang on. Free kick, free kick.
That's OK, Jack.
Come on, back in the game.
OK, let's go.
Spread around, defence.
Spread around, spread around.
Play on.
- Right, play on.
- You're OK, you're OK.
No problem.
Keep going, keep going.
I said play on.
Free kick now. 
Hang on a minute. You alright?
Shame Linda's not here for this one.
Er, Marissa, um, this man's pooped before half-time.
- Yeah, I noticed. You alright, mate?
- Yeah.
You know what? I'm just gonna drop him in to Doc Reid.
We'll see you Tuesday practice.
- Take care.
- Come on, mate.
We try to achieve maximum formal impact with complete unity.
The new addition of the memorial hall at Broughton Park demonstrates Harvey's contemporary forms...
Dad, we're home.
Ah, you did the shopping already. Good.
Dr. Reid took some blood and stuck my name on it!
Yeah, you were really brave, sweetie.
Then the ladies took it in to a psychopath.
Pathologist, I suspect.
You do look a bit zonked.
Pussy, eh? Come on.
- What's that all about?
- He just got tired at soccer.
Doc Reid said he should be fine.
They just did some blood tests to be sure.
I didn't know you'd be working.
- Yep, sorry. Um, I got to take this.
- What time's your plane?
- I've got to leave in half an hour.
- Alright.
Hi.
Holy shit!
Don't swear or blaspheme, mister.
There's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Should we hurry down to the cellar?
Hey, don't interrupt him, Jack.
He's working.
Dad, there's a comet. Dad!
- You've gotta look at this thing!
- Sorry, just a sec.
Jack, you're supposed to knock, please.
But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Yeah. Due to go past in about 2126, I think.
Now, can I finish this, please?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Sorry.
- Off you go.
So the termite guy might swing by this afternoon.
Recycling's tomorrow night.
Don't forget, please.
Yeah, I know. But they reckon that's what killed the dinosaurs.
- What, recycling or the termite guy?
- A comet like Swift-Tuttle!
- Here. You always forget this.
- Oh!
- Staying in the same place?
- Yeah, usual.
- I'll bring you back a shower cap.
- And I'll have a marmalade.
It's gonna miss us by 15 million miles.
I think we'll be alright.
You don't even like marmalade.
Is this a new thing
I need to know about, huh?
- I love you.
- I'll make you that for breakfast.
- Travel safe, honey.
- See ya!
All the combined armed forces designed a weapon that would be fired at Swift-Tuttle just at the right time.
Hi.
Oh, hello, Dr. Reid.
Sure. Yeah, yeah, I'll bring him in this afternoon.
As it got closer and closer, the scientists couldn't agree where the comet was going to hit, and if Swift-Tuttle hits us, there'll only be a crater instead of this 'orrible 'ospital!
"Horrible hospital."
Mum, how long do we have to stay here?
Just be one second, darl.
Jack's white cell count certainly is abnormally high.
We should admit him, keep an eye on him.
There's a lot of reasons, aren't there, for a high white cell count?
Maybe he's just been overdoing it.
We're going to do further tests, of course.
We can ascertain what the problem is and then we'll treat him. OK?
- You alright, buddy?
- Yeah.
Almost there.
Atlantis Station.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
He'll sleep for a while.
There you go, buddy.
It's your birthday!
Gonna party like it's your birthday!
Drink Ribena like it's your birthday!
Come on, now, it's your birthday!
Come on, pick up, for God sakes.
Professor David Hagen.
I'm sorry I can't take your call.
Please leave a message after the tone.
David, it's me. Call me. It's urgent.
David Hagen, please.
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
So am I, my friend.
Why don't you hire a truck, you git?
If you got out of your motor car, that would help, not sitting there sounding your horn, please.
Why don't you go back to China?
I Korean, you stupid round-eyed Tasmanian.
Now, let's not be starting
World War III, fellas.
Thank you.
Now, see what we can achieve when we all work together? Eh?
This is the Park Royal, isn't it?
Well... No, just check again.
Professor David Hagen. H-A-G-E-N.
No.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ho-ho, there he is!
The boatswain's mate, always ready to pipe the captain aboard.
- Dad, you've finished it!
- I was up all night with the frame.
The Australian climate plays havoc with the planks.
Give me the icy waters of the Solent any day.
Right, let's get cracking.
Down you go.
Yeah.
Right.
Put this here.
Wow! It's orgasmic.
'Orgasmic', you say.
And what would that mean, exactly?
Uh, it's something about food with no bug spray.
That would be 'organic'.
Oh. What's this sailor's name?
He must have just arrived.
I reckon she could spare us a jib.
Ahoy there!
How would it be if I trade you my coat?
'Cause sailing away is all those sheets are good for.
Sorry, wool makes me itch.
Ne'er you mind.
Right. Crew in place.
Steer ship to starboard.
We'll be underpowered for the moment.
Ah! There on the horizon.
Can you see the magical islands rising for the night?
But be sharp, boy. They're likely to vanish in the blink of an eye.
Hear me now, dawn spirits of the east.
Join us, if you will. Your magic is most welcome and wanted here.
Is the father sick too, Mummy?
He's just praying, darling.
Go back to sleep.
I'll get us our own room in the morning.
Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night.
Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night.
- Just meet him there.
- Yeah, thanks for that.
He's turning the ward into a coven.
Yes, I agree about the candles.
But we can't conjure up beds we don't have.
There's got to be a single room somewhere.
We pay top cover for this.
- Milk run?
- Mm-hm.
- I'll go.
- No, I'll do it.
No, I'll go. You've done enough shopping for this relationship.
Why didn't you get the bed by the window?.
It's nearer to the loo.
If you're on Gleevec, you have to piss all the time.
What sort of leukaemia do you have?
Leukaemia? I don't think I've got that.
They haven't told you?
You're in a cancer ward.
I am? Well, maybe I've just got a bit of leukaemia.
Well, there's bad leukaemia and there's really bad leukaemia.
That's all.
I used to have the really bad one, but they fixed it.
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?
Have I got leukaemia?
Yeah, you have, but they're really good at fixing it here.
They did say he's a good age for treatment.
A good age?
Where were you, David?
I was calling your phone all weekend.
Park Royal told me you weren't even registered there.
I know, I'm sorry. There was a mix-up with the reservation.
I had to go somewhere else.
I just really needed you here.
- I know.
- Dad?
- Dad.
- Hello, mister.
I can't leave you alone for a minute, can l?
Bone marrow transplants used to be a last resort, but with high-risk children, we're finding that transplants - after the initial chemo - are mainly giving positive results.
'High risk'? But my wife just said that he was at a good age.
The T cell's a strange fellow.
It makes Jack's treatment more tricky.
Where are all these amazing breakthroughs we keep hearing about?
Stem cell work?
Look, I'd say Jack's got a better than even chance of responding well to chemotherapy alone.
And with bone marrow transplant, much better odds.
Anything less is too risky.
"Even chance"?
If there's a sibling whose marrow matched, makes the odds much better.
- I'm ordering a lumbar puncture.
- OK.
It'll give us a clearer idea of where we stand.
OK.
He was such a robust baby. I wonder...
Well, I mean, all those paint strippers and flaking paint he used to roll in.
- Hey. I've gotta move the car.
- Come on, boys.
One at a time. Remember where we are.
No, no, kids.
You can't just walk in there.
We have to come sterilise your hands, OK?
Jack's been diagnosed with leukaemia.
No. It's because she stopped buying red meat.
He just needs to eat some liver.
No, not anaemia.
I said... I said 'leukaemia'.
Oh, yeah. He'll be back playing with all of you in no time.
- That's great.
- That's awesome.
That's Finn over there.
He sailed out here on a yacht from Ireland.
- Oh!
- By himself?
Yeah! After pirates killed the rest of the crew.
Where have you put my cherub?
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello, darling.
Awww. Mwah!
Alright, boys.
Thanks so much for visiting.
Bye, Jack.
- We'll see you all soon, OK?
- OK. See ya!
- Sarah, I'll call you.
- Come on, boys. Bye, Jack.
Is it lemonade, Gran Cleo?
Oh, no, dear.
It's from Mrs. Bland up the street.
- Is it fizzy?
- It's holy water.
I'll go and get my cherub some lemonade.
Coffees for you and me?
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
Oh, my!
Is that a model of one of the nurses?
Oh, no. My dad's making me a figurehead.
It looks a bit like my mum before she died.
We're going on a sailing trip to some magical islands.
Her name's Asiram.
She'll be at the head of our vessel.
Indeed she is! Oh! Hello.
- Oh, hi.
- Right. Here we go!
I used to be in the Girl Guides.
- Were you indeed?
- Mmm.
Then you would know that the bowline is the best knot for mooring.
I would.
Right.
Finally, let's plug this boy in, turn her on...
Oh!
And there she blows.
That's cool.
Oh-ho-ho, at last! A southerly to start us on our journey.
Oh! Whoa!
- There's a boat!
- This is awesome!
- Go on.
- Lash it in.
Keep it going!
- Whoo!
- Keep going. She's tacking.
She's tacking. Keep pushing.
- Aha!
- Goin' great.
She's tacking! She's tacking.
There she goes.
Come see our ship over the ocean!
Oh!
Starboard. Starboard. Keep going.
Hi, Jack. Hi, Finn.
Can we please have a go?
- Wait, wait! I'm next.
- Westward ho!
How cool is this?
- Ready, Jack?
- Let's go! Oh!
Hello! That's it. Come on, boys.
Whoa-ho!
That's it! Come on, boys.
There she blows.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Pull, pull, pull, pull to starboard.
- Hey, hey! She's flying.
- Oh, this is so cool.
Ho-ho! Go on. Ho-ho!
Watch that shark. Hey! Keep going!
And because of the comet zapper,
Swift-Tuttle was banished to space forever!
That's a beautiful story, darling.
The last bit's on the other card.
It's one of Dad's you got?
I only took it out of his 'Ready to Use' tray.
It's alright. It's OK.
This is the best bit.
And because the kid saved the world,
Pizza Hut gave him
10 million dessert coupons.
The end, Episode 1.
Ta-da!
- Oh! Such an imagination.
- You liked it?
- Dad! It's a comet.
- Yeah.
- There you are again.
- Come look at this!
You're supposed to knock, please.
But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us.
Yeah. Due to go past in about 2126, I think.
- Can I finish this, please?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Sorry.
Off you go.
No, not yet... I just...
I've got to work out the best time.
I know, I know.
Veronica, I'm leaving her.
Well, for all his airs and fancy lacework,
I thought at the very least he was a decent man.
Back in a minute, darling.
- Yep.
- I'll hold the fort here.
If you ever cheat on a girl,
I'll kill you.
OK?
Huh?
- Sorry.
- Off you go.
No, not yet... I just...
I've got to work out the best time.
I know, I know.
Veronica, I'm leaving her, OK?
I am leaving her. I...
And to be perfectly honest,
I don't think she'll even notice.
Jack's the only thing that matters to her.
- Alright.
- You OK there, Jack?
Nice curving the back there for me, and if you could just push that shoulder up.
Good boy. Nice slow breaths.
- Then we'll do the mouth.
- OK.
- And in...two...
- That's it, sweetie.
- That's it.
- That's a boy. Good boy.
- Almost done. Almost there.
- Good boy.
Just takes a little second or so.
Good boy. That's it. Nice low breaths.
Holy water?
- Is she trying to poison him?
- Put it down. That's not yours.
Who's Veronica?
Is she the one that did your editing when I had pneumonia?
Is it that one?
No idea what you're talking about.
How long you been planning it?
Planning what?
Planning to leave us for her. How long?
Marissa, I'm not planning to leave you for...
You knew Jack was sick and you just went off to be with her?
Listen to me.
If you've listened to something out of context, then I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I'm not leaving you for anyone, alright? I'm staying.
Stay for Jack. He needs you.
- Yes. It's a gale.
- Very good.
- This one?
- Um... 5, fresh breeze?
No. Look closely at the crests.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Nothing to do with you, kiddo.
I did it all by myself, OK?
That's a boy.
Hi.
- Hi, Mum.
- I better go, OK?
I'll see you later. I love you.
I'll head off, OK?
Yeah.
And that's...that's, er, 11.
- A violent storm.
- Violent storm. Yeah.
Ahoy there.
Head sharp aft, right over left, left over right.
Send up a flare if you need some help.
Radar problem detected.
Will investigate.
Think about it, Connor - playing cat's cradle isn't going to help our kids make it round Cape Horn.
Well, that may well be, but there's a lot more to treating this vile disease than medicine.
And I won't have you telling me that Irish linen is a problem for you as well.
Come on.
Take it.
I'll teach you how to sail to the magical islands of the Bean Fionn.
They say that a child blessed with a kiss from the Fianna is indestructible.
Do you believe this stuff, really?
- Mm-hm.
- You do?
Mmm.
And what about Finn?
Do you think it's right for him to believe this - that he's setting sail for some mystical island?
All this incredible ritual for nothing?
For nothing? No! More so for everything.
When the spirit dies, so does the flesh.
That won't be happening to my boy Finn.
Every human being on earth has two of these - these antigens, these sets, coded so.
OK, now, look, don't feel embarrassed about asking questions.
Just ask any question you have to ask.
So I'll try and get you through it.
We've got the HLA-A. That's crucial.
That has 24 antigen sites.
The HLA-B has 52 antigen sites.
Don't be confused by the numbers...
HLA-DR...
20 antigens...
We can exclude it...
We're looking for a sibling...
We've got a 25% chance for a match with a donor...
We need a blood test, the bone marrow test...
We need the genetic test...
The unknown...
That's the combination...
Now, what is crucial is that the immune system will kill any cells with different markers...
Because what are we looking for?
That's it.
We're looking for a...
That mixes...
This is what we've got...
Unfortunately, you have the rare antigens.
Ah, David. Quite rare.
OK, doesn't put us in a pickle because...
OK.
How many other women are there?
I'm sorry.
I've been seeing someone else.
I have been.
I've been having an affair.
And what about all those women in all those houses you worked on?
Huh?
All those times they called the house and you said there was nothing going on except in my rabid imagination.
Marissa, please, don't do this!
- All those times you went interstate?
- Stop it.
How do you know you don't have other children?
- How do you know you don't have...
- I don't have other children!
- Look, stop it!
- How do you know that?
This isn't the place to talk about this.
We'll talk about this at home.
Marianne, hi.
- Hey, I've got you now!
- Marissa.
Oh, is that... is that Jeremy?
God, is he eight now?.
Who's there?
It's OK, honey.
Oh, I don't even know how to say this but...
.. I've got a serious problem that you might be able to help me with.
I have to go, so...
Is there any chance... that Jeremy could be David's child?
- What? What are you talking about?
- It's OK.
- I already know about the affairs.
- Marianne!
- It's OK.
- Just go, for Christ's sake.
- I don't want you here.
- Because if he is...
Oh! If he is, he could save my child's life.
He's not.
- Thank God.
- I've told you before.
- Do you know that for sure?
- Don't encourage these people!
- She's not selling anything.
- Can you get off my property?
- Yeah, yeah. I was just going.
- Good God!
Marissa Hagen.
Are you looking for your husband?
Well, you're nine years too late.
No, er... my boy's...
No. I'm not fine.
My boy's really sick.
Yeah. Jack.
Listen, um...
Did you have an affair with David in August, 1996?
Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet...
Janet, Janet, I know!
Listen, it doesn't matter to me right now.
- Hey, Marissa.
- I just...
What the hell's happened to my office?
Er, no. It's David.
Um...
You know, Janet, I think you should talk to him about this.
It might be a bit easier.
- What are you doing?
- Janet de Cosi.
I don't want to talk to Janet.
You're crazy.
Listen, Janet, all I need to know...
- Are either of your kids his?
- For God's sake.
Oh, for God's sake! Hang up the phone.
Oh! He wore a condom.
- Gee. How responsible of him.
- Hang up the phone. Hang up.
This is so fucking stupid.
What are you doing?
You have gone out of your mind.
I'm having real problems with these numbers here, you know?.
It's like you called this one number in June over and over and over again.
- I was working with these people.
- Then here at 4:00am?
What were you doing?
Don't you think we need to focus on the main thing at the moment in our lives, which is Jack?
- Oh! Are you talking about Jack?
- Yes, I'm talking about...
You mean Jack who had to listen to his dad talking to some whore on the phone?
Look, I'm sorry...
Is that what you're talking about, while he's laying in bed with leukaemia?
I am sorry he had to listen to that.
I am sorry! I will live with that, OK, for the rest of my life!
I mean, wh...? 
What is this? What is this?!
What is this shit?!
What are we meant to do now?.!
- I understand.
- Get off me!
- I understand what you're...
- Oh, do you understand?
- Yes!
- Oh, really?
Because this is about Jack, OK?
And Jack is what we have to be focusing on now.
What do you think I'm doing?!
Huh?
What do you think I'm doing?!
What do you think I'm doing?!
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
- Calm down.
- Have you seen what I'm doing?!
- I love you.
- Oh!
I love you. I love you.
I'm so sorry. I understand.
Just get off me.
We're done. OK?
Get out of the house.
Fully sick! 
-Ta-da!
-Yay!
- OK, which hat?
- That one.
- This one?
- Yeah!
This one?
§ Ha, ha! §
Hey-hey, Finn. Look.
All finished and ready for the voyage ahead, eh?
- What do you think, boys?
- Cool!
- Yeah. Beautiful.
- She's beautiful.
- Yes. Wow. Cool.
- Awesome. Awesome.
- Alright, boys. Bedtime.
- Come on.
Out, out, out.
Don't let those bedbugs bite.
Er, your boots - are they on the wrong feet?
Ah, yes. You see, it's Thursday.
Eh, Finn?
Finn?
Mr O'Brien, could we have a word, please?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Hi. Have you seen Connor?
Thank you.
Connor?
Connor?
The leukocytes are way up.
They can't control them.
What does that mean?
Don't make me say it.
Oh, God. Connor, I thought he was...
Just leave me alone, will you?
Yeah, OK.
- If there's anything...
- For God's sake, woman!
OK. OK.
Jasmine?
The flowers will make everything OK.
Well, fluids are important.
Argh!
Arrrggghhh!
Finn!
No...
No!
- No!
- OK.
- Go away!
- OK.
Come here, come here. It's OK.
- No.
- It's OK. Come here.
It's OK. Come on. Come on.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK, Finn. It's OK.
It's OK.
I know, I know. It's OK.
It's OK.
- It's OK.
- I don't want to die.
Of course not. Of course not.
I'm scared.
Finn, of course you're scared.
- I'm scared too.
- No.
But you're not dying.
Listen,
I... I think all of us fear stuff that we don't know about.
What I do know is this - that the islands of Bean Fionn are where your dear mother is.
She's waiting there for you.
Now, maybe you'll get better.
Maybe you'll be crook for ages.
Whatever it is, I'm here with you.
We'll do this thing together.
And when the time comes, we'll go to those islands.
And maybe I'll take you.
Or maybe your mummy will take you.
Either way, you'll not be alone.
Do you hear me?
You will not be alone.
Come here.
Come here.
You are a brave, brave soul.
You know you were named after the son of Muirne, head of the Fianna.
And the bravest, the bravest of all...
..was Finn.
It's OK.
It's OK.
I know, son.
I know.
I know. I know.
- Yes?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry. I was just admiring your renovation.
- I mean, your house.
- Oh, thank you.
- My husband, David Hagen, helped you with the heritage issues.
Ah. David?
David, could you go inside, please?
- Now.
- Your son's name is David?
David, inside now.
Yes. I quite like the name.
I have to go.
I have to get him to swimming.
I just want a quick word. My husband was here about 10 years ago.
I can't help noticing that your son appears to be about 9 or 10.
- Is that right?
- What are you doing here?
I even notice that his face is sort of similar to David's.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you want but I'm in a hurry.
My son has leukaemia.
He needs a bone marrow transplant.
- You must be out of your mind.
- Please.
Coming here to my home?
The donor has to have the same antigens as my husband and that means he has to be a sibling.
He's not David's child.
He told me you were unstable.
I'm unstable?
Wait. Wait a minute! Please!
Dad...
.. I can feed myself.
OK.
Can I see you for a minute?
Hey, Finn. Finn!
Guess what me and my dad are doing on Saturday.
We're going to the circus.
They have a special one here for all the kids!
They're gonna have clowns and acrobats.
And they might even have animals.
And a guy who eats fire.
I saw him on the poster yesterday.
Please come, Finn.
It won't be any fun without you.
OK.
Yes!
I'll do room 12.
Oh, OK. Thanks.
Hi there.
Mr. O'Brien.
- Oh, look, I am so sorry about...
- No, don't worry.
And the report says
I accidentally dropped my bowling ball down the stairs and it went through the window.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Bad luck.
Mmm.
- Thanks.
- OK.
Whoa!
Oh!
Ah! My trolley! Oh!
Oh!
Connor!
Jump in!
Oh, hello.
Put her in the back.
Got it?
- She's not gonna fit.
- Tie her on the roof. There's rope.
Right.
Whoa.
Saved by the queen of the waters.
Shut up or I'll crash.
Where to?
My boat's moored down at Williamstown.
Oh, yeah, good.
My shop's down that way.
You've got a boat?
You've got a shop?
I'm going to be very preoccupied for a while.
Yeah, of course.
You should be with Jack.
I mean, we could see each other again once I've got him through this.
OK.
David, I'm pregnant.
Odd, isn't it?
We gave it less thought than two 16-year-olds in the back seat of a car in Albert Park.
You're joking. That's great.
That's great!
Obviously I've thought a lot about this and what with everything going on with Jack and us...
No, no, no, no. You can't... you can't worry about that.
- I don't think we should have the baby.
- Well, let's talk about it.
I don't think there's anything to talk about.
- As parents.
- We never talked about being parents.
A lot of people don't discuss that and that just happens.
David, it's you and me.
It was about us having fun.
- Veronica, please.
- It was never about being parents.
It could be a match for Jack.
- For Jack?
- Yeah.
- Is that what this is about?
- No, that's not what this is about.
What, you want a baby so you can have some spare parts for your sick child?
Oh, that's a disgusting thing to say.
It's my boy's life, OK?
And no, our baby... Come on.
Sweetheart, our baby would be our baby, OK?
It just so happens that he or she might also be a match for my boy.
- I've made up my mind.
- Can we please think about this?
Can you please just go?
Oh, wow.
Oh.
- Amazing.
- Ah.
Gosh.
Mary Hay. A wooden bark of 258 tons.
She went down on Steeple Rock in the fog, didn't you?
- You made all of these.
- No, no. I copied them.
There's no art in that.
Purely for money.
Fortunately, there are people out there with more money than sense.
Oh, she is stunning.
Oh, she's off the square rigger 'Britannia'.
A handsome woman.
Hmm. Certainly ready for the water.
- Careful, careful!
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Let it go.
- You got it?
- I got it.
- OK.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I don't suppose I could interest you in sharing a nice pot of tea.
No. I'll be getting back.
OK.
Er, how are you going to get that on the boat?
That's a good point.
Hello, girls.
The boat felt empty without Finn so I made Nuala here to dine with at supper, then I felt bad about leaving her on her own so much so I made my Fair Midhir.
Oh, they must have some great chats about salt-resistent shampoo.
Hmm.
Listen, you're the first woman aboard that can hold her own cup.
Tea.
Does the boat ever leak?
Oh, all the time.
A constant reminder as to who's the boss.
I think I'm more of a city girl.
Terra firma - much more appealing.
Mummy.
Mummy!
Mum.
Mummy!
Your mum's not here.
And your gran's snoring.
What's the matter?
My... my hands are tingling.
I can't move them.
I wouldn't worry yourself.
It's just a calcium drop.
It happens 'cause of the chemo.
Yeah.
But now it's happening to my feet.
Yeah. It's definitely a calcium drop.
Could I die from calcium drop?
No. And you're definitely not dying now.
You know, people, they... they stop being bossy...
..talk to a kid sort of differently around here 'cause they're gonna die.
Do you know they get their own PlayStation 3?
And first choice of DVDs.
And face it, no-one except your gran is making any special fuss over you.
Finn, is there any way of getting your own PlayStation...
..that's a bit less than dying?
I haven't heard of it.
I've got to go.
I've got a dentist appointment.
- His mummy will be here soon.
- OK.
Jack's X-ray's at 8:00.
I really need to get back.
You'll be able to get a signal at the boatshed.
I can't believe this.
Half an hour for Jack without you is nothing compared to what lies ahead.
Don't say that. They're saying
Jack's chances are really good.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Connor. I shouldn't have...
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
I should get going.
Marissa... remember this - we met only on water.
Now you're back ashore.
Hi. Um, I-I'd like to leave this for Jack Hagen.
- Oh, you can give it to him yourself.
- Oh...
- Jack, there's a delivery for you.
Oh, and your mum called.
She's going to be about half an hour.
Imagine your incredible comet zapper blasting those nasty white blood cells.
Pow! Pow! Pow!
I'm zapping you dumb aliens to make room for red cells!
Ready at last, Jack.
Sorry about the wait, Mrs. Hagen.
No, my mum's Mrs. Hagen.
Oh. Um, gosh, Jack, I've got to fly.
Here. You hold onto that, darling.
And just remember - those nasty white blood cells don't have a chance.
Pow! Pow!
But I won't be zapping only for me.
I think my dad's gonna move in with this lady that's not my mum, and if I die, my mum won't have anyone to help with the shopping or stuff like that.
Bye, Jack.
You OK in there?
No.
Why don't you come out and have some water?
I've got a paper cup.
What's wrong? Is it your child?
It's hopeless. 
I know exactly how you feel.
When I first heard about my Jack, it just...
Um... look, l-I'll leave your water here on the sink.
I'm available to have a chat.
I'm up in Haematology, Room 4.
Marissa Hagen.
Whoaaa!
I nearly missed that one.
Whoa! An apple? 
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Actually, no.
- Settle down. Hey!
Settle down, you two!
Listen, circus starts at 6:00.
Your dad should easily be here by then.
I'll be close by if you need anything.
- OK. Yep.
- Love you.
Watch out. Coming through.
- Have fun, kids. See you later.
- Bye.
- OK. You ready?
- Yeah, I'll wait outside.
Aw, I wish I was going to the circus!
Still want to go?
Uh, yeah.
Do you want me to come with you?
Uh... I want to go with Jack and his dad.
OK. Will do.
- I'll be here to tuck you in.
- OK.
Mmm.
You know, I went to see
Bernadette Saxon today.
Oh, another diary entry?
She and I used to work together and then she had David design their renovation.
Ah.
Anyway, she pretends not to recognise me.
Hello?
Bernadette. Marissa.
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK. It's been a while.
It's been a long time, yeah.
So I said, "Bernadette, any chance those kids of yours are David's?"
Could be.
Well, it depends.
Did he spend any time in Turkana?
It's right up in the north of Kenya.
Here they are.
Say hello to Mrs. Hagen, guys.
Hi.
Oh, no way. Really?
That is unbelievable.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
Our kids will be alright, won't they?
Oh, listen, they'll be fine for an hour or two without us.
In fact, it's good for them.
Yeah, it will.
You've called Veronica Mendelsohn.
I'm sorry I'm not here at present.
O-3.
You finally sunk my ship.
- He's not coming.
- Doesn't look like it.
Hey, Finn. Want to do something really exciting?
Something way better than some stupid circus.
Like what?
Quiet.
Try here.
Oh, we found it!
Yes!
Gotta love that. 
Taxi!
Taxi!
Here we go.
Whoo! Hello, hello, hello.
Hello. Yes, speaking.
No, I'm not far away. What's wrong?
No, no, no. They're with my husband
David. They went to the circus event.
Are you sure? Well, where's David?
Yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can.
They're saying the boys are missing.
They can't find them.
David, where the hell are you?
I hope you're with the boys. Call me.
Alright, come on. Come on.
Veronica, look, we can adopt the baby out, if that's what you want, OK?
Please. If you love me, you'll do this. Please!
Please, will you do this?!
Will you do it?
It's my boy's life!
Will you just please do it?
David, please, the entire building can hear you.
- Is that what you're worried about?
- Yes. At this moment it is.
Look, will you just please be reasonable?
You are so unfair.
How dare you lay this on me?
I don't want a baby! I never did.
Finn? Why didn't you say something?
- I'm so cold.
- Finn, I have to call someone.
I don't know how to make you feel better.
No.
Make a fire.
That'll make me feel better.
What happened? Where are they?
They're OK. They were spotted at Luna Park at about 8:00.
Luna Park?
Apparently they're having a grand old time.
Aye. Down by the bay. Of course.
We've got a car there looking for them.
OK. Well, I'll go. You stay here.
It'll be fine.
- OK, young fella.
- Hi. Are you Jack Hagen?
- Where's your friend?
- In the boat shed. He's really cold.
With his immunity this low, we can't take any risks.
- Temp's tipping 40.
- He's had Panadol.
- He's febrile.
- Yeah.
We're doing a septic work-up now.
We'll get some IV into him, see how it goes.
It'll make him comfortable.
Hopefully bring the temperature down.
It'll be alright.
He's going to be fine, sweetheart.
He's going to be fine, OK?
- How could you forget?
- I crashed the car.
Can you see heaven with a telescope?
Heaven?
With a really powerful telescope, you can see horizons that people on earth can't even imagine.
And kids who were friends, when they die, are they still friends in heaven?
Nobody is sure about that, darling, but yeah, I think so.
Professor.
- Ah, David.
- You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Veronica Mendelsohn came to see me.
Did she?
More than that.
She wanted prenatal diagnosis to test her baby for matching for Jack.
Really?
We've got a pretty simple procedure now.
Right. So you can do it?
We've done it.
She wanted me to tell you that unfortunately it's not a match.
She's got a pretty strong set of antigens there.
- Blew yours right out of the water.
- Right.
- So the search continues.
- Yeah.
Gotta go.
It's showtime, you lucky boy.
I'll be back after I've had my coffee.
Mmm.
Come on.
Who's the PlayStation for?
The child in bed 4.
When he wakes up, it's going to be a big surprise, Jack.
Hi.
Kerry!
Kerry.
Kerry. Where's the bloody plug to the bath?
- Who's she?
- Hi.
Hi. Sorry. Marissa Hagen.
If you're selling something, forget it.
If you're flogging some religion,
I suggest you go next door.
They need guidance.
Is your name Janice Cromby?
I knew it. You've got a summons.
Janice Cromby doesn't live here.
- Hasn't for years.
- Hey, Janice!
Have you got those curtains ready for my mum?
Great timing, Bill. Piss off!
Oh, Mum. He's the nicest boyfriend you've ever had.
Don't treat him like a piece of shit.
She shouldn't, should she?
Do you remember David Hagen?
You met him about 16 years ago.
You were a model doing a shoot for Myer's at the Collins Street Uniting Church.
He was in charge of the restoration.
Apparently you and he had a fling.
What is this? 20 questions?
Look, he fathered my child, who now has leukaemia.
I'm just looking for other kids he may have fathered.
Cool! Like they all might have the same leukaemia?
Doesn't quite work that way.
- We're not complete morons, you know.
- The jury's still out on that.
Go find that bloody plug. Now!
Jeez! Keep your shirt on.
Look, is there any chance she could be David's child?
That's all I want to know.
If I'd thought there was any chance he was the father,
I'd have hit him so hard for child support he'd have been crippled.
OK.
So I'll be coming off the drip, then?
Yes, Finn, you will.
Hi, love of my life. Here you go.
We can go back to the boat and I'll wait.
I don't know if I can live on the boat, son.
The boat shed is very close.
But we lived on the boat before, Dad.
Why can't we now?.
He just needs a nurse that can row.
Or... or sailing.
We could go sailing.
Do you want to go sailing, Jack?
Can l, Mum? Please?
Yeah. Don't see why not.
You're coming home for the weekend anyway.
Yes!
Back on Monday, 9:00am.
Yeah, we can get a lot of telescope built in two whole days.
You know how they say you can learn a language in your sleep?
Well, I often go to sleep listening to your tapes.
You must wake up quite the authority on rising damp.
Yeah! Welcome back, Jack.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Hi, everyone.
Aw. What a nice surprise.
- Thanks for coming out, everyone.
- Nice hat.
Thanks.
- This is for you, Jack.
- Aw.
How sweet! What did you get?
Take off your beanie, Jack.
Whoa!
How'd you go this week, huh?
Did you win?
- Yeah.
- Great!
Now all will know you're aboard.
Crew in place. We'll sit here at anchor until the storm blows through.
At least I won't get seasick.
No, you won't.
Get ready to fall back.
Here we go, Jack. Go across now.
Pull the jib sheet in. Watch the boom.
This is so cool.
Remember to duck.
- This is awesome!
- I know.
Point her a little to windward.
Dad, I know what to do.
Right.
- Go faster?
- Yeah.
Pull on the main sheet.
It came with 50 games.
Which one do you want to play?
Which game's the longest?
Alrighty. Last lucky last.
Last yucky last.
Good job, honey.
Ta.
Are we still building the platform tomorrow, Dad?
The weekend's all yours.
Goodnight, my boy.
Oh, it's so good to see him back in his own bed again.
Yeah, it really is.
OK, I'm gonna hit the road.
I'll be back in the morning.
Finn made some headway with that telescope today.
Why don't you stay?
Really?
Yeah.
Are you OK?
It was for Jack.
You trying to get pregnant?
You know there's only a one-in-three chance of a match with siblings.
It's better than the billion-to-one we have right now.
- Mummy!
- Sweetie! I'm coming, I'm coming.
Mummy! 
It's leukaemia! I can smell it!
No, it's OK. Hey, hey.
- Why won't it stop?
- Shh, just give me a look.
- It's alright, it's alright.
- Hey, listen. Look at me, darling.
- It's just a nosebleed.
- Take your hand...
- Here, buster. Here you go.
- That's it - pressure.
- Just put pressure on it.
- I'll call the hospital.
OK, breathe through your mouth slowly.
§ If you've got a tad too much blood
§ And your name is nothing like Kevin Rudd
§ Then you'd better squirt some of it out
§ Whoo! On the sheets, on the road
§ Out the front door till your neighbours are covered in red
§ What you say?
§ Till your neighbours are covered in red. §
Aahhh!
Oh, that's great.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Thanks.
Nasty shock, that one, eh?
Look, it was a reaction to the cyclophosphamide. Rarely happens.
But mind you, a slight change in air pressure can bring on these bleeds.
- You right, champ?
- Mm-hm.
Good boy.
Stay tight.
God.
Your hands are so cold, son.
Please don't take me back to the hospital.
Please, Dad. Please.
A hospital would make no difference.
Really. It wouldn't.
Now, who can I call?
(WEAKLY) Can you build...
..another...
Can you build... another castle...
..for tonight?
So Mum...
..so Mum will know we’re home.
Of course, son.
Of course.
What do you need?
It's a south day.
Jasmine will taste no good at all.
I'm here for you.
Mum.
Mummy.
Is that you?
Darling, it's Marissa.
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
- We talked about this. I don't...
- I want to be with Finn!
I'll be in the car.
Does... does it hurt?
No.
I... I just feel very sleepy.
Listen.
Jack...
I want you to have my PlayStation.
No, Finn.
You keep it.
You're going to get better.
And... and I'll come over and play it with you.
Whenever you want.
Really.
You can have it.
But you've got to do something for me, though.
But you have to promise.
I promise.
Look... look after my dad...
..for me.
He's...
He's gonna miss me, OK?
You have to help him.
OK?
OK.
OK.
I want to stay awake until she comes.
Shh.
Imagine you're riding the waves with Fungie.
Not now.
It's almost...
She's here.
You'll be at home on those fairy islands.
My boy.
My boy.
I shouldn't have taken him to Luna Park.
You gave him his last big adventure.
But maybe that was too much for him.
No, no. Listen, mate.
The doctors had already taken
Finn off his medication.
They knew he was dying.
I miss him already.
I know you do. I know you do.
Finn must have been needed for something really special someplace else.
Come on, sweet boy.
Time for your bed.
No! No!
No!
I just watched a little boy die.
It doesn't have to be that way with Jack. We know what can save him.
There's no-one on the register with an exact match.
Goddamn elitist antigens.
Look, a full match might surface, but it's more likely we'll find a partial.
- Those are often successful, right?
- Yeah, in 60% of cases.
I'll tell you right now.
If it was my child, I'd opt for a transplant with a partial match.
Because this disease is progressing, and I mean progressing.
- Hi. Are you Madeline Gardener?
- No.
That's Madeline Gardener over there.
Hi, Madeline? I'm Marissa Hagen.
Hi!
You said your husband was in Johannesburg from March till October that same year.
What does your husband look like?
Oh, God. Um... he's my height.
He sort of has strong features, like your daughter.
Wow.
This is amazing.
So, I mean... What are you saying?
I might be right, then?
Oh, no. I don't think so.
See, Anton impregnated my sister so that we could have a child.
I had a hysterectomy when I was, like, 16.
It was in all the papers.
- Hey, do you want something to eat?
- No.
I mean, this is fascinating.
Claudia, hi. It's Marissa Hagen.
Yeah, could be better, you know.
Look, Claudia, I know this is a weird question...
- Yes?
- I'm not doing a survey.
I'm not selling anything.
I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.
I'm just a mother and...
.. I'd really like to ask you something, if that's OK.
I really need to know what you want.
My boy has leukaemia and I'm just looking for bone marrow donors.
Uh... are you going door to door?
No. Not every door.
Well, what brings you to my door?
I believe you had an affair with my husband in 2000.
Goodbye.
Listen! Just, please, just give me a second!
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no! That was an accident!
- Jessie, Nathan, get to your rooms.
It was an accident!
Hi, Jessie. Hi, Nathan.
- Hey, Jessie, how old are you?
- I'm nine.
Jessie, get to your room now!
Listen to me, OK? My boy is dying.
Alright? Do you understand?
If you slept with my husband, she could have matching bone marrow.
It's a very simple procedure for her.
She doesn't even eat meat!
He was here for months renovating this house in 2000. Come on!
We bought this house in 2002.
- Aren't you Angela Lewis?
- Angela Lewis?
- Angela and Grant Lewis! I mean...
- Grant Lewis?
We bought this house from him.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry, kids. Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
When will you be back?
When Ireland's had enough of me.
Fair Midhir.
Always the bridesmaid.
Don't despair.
Your time will come.
I was wondering how you'd been.
Not really very good, Marissa.
Not good at all.
And Jack?
Struggling.
We still can't find a bone marrow match, so...
I hope you do.
You look after yourself, OK?
Thanks.
Not flathead. Flat bread.
- Hello.
- Hi.
She runs her 'B's into her 'R's like 'H's.
The bakery's three aisles left.
Thank you.
I was gonna call you
'cause I wanted to thank you...
..for...taking the test.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
My termination's on Saturday night.
Saturday night? Wouldn't have thought they'd be open on...
Yeah. It's a niche market for women who work.
You'd be a great mum.
- Would it help...
- No.
No?
Do you want me to take you?
It's not a date, David.
OK.
Are you Jack?
That's what they call me.
I'm Kerry.
Hi.
I'm your sister.
Ugh. I am not taking you to the movies!
- Jeez.
- Sister?
I don't have a sister.
Well, you do now.
How could you be my sister?
You serious?
Well...
..your dad bonked my mum, I guess.
Huh?
Oops. Whoa.
Look, I may be able to help you.
§ I wish I was in Carrickfergus
§ Only for nights in Ballygrand

Hi. Thanks for coming in.
Yeah, look, I've just got to say that I'm still not happy about this.
Mum, put a sock in it.
- I'm going to see Jack.
- OK. He's with his dad.
Dad, how are you going to live by yourself?
- You can't cook or anything.
- What do you mean, I can't cook?
I can cook.
You've had my paella many times.
Twice. And the second time,
I got the trots.
Hey. Can I come in?
- Hey. Sure.
- Hi, Kerry.
Hi, Dad. Um, Mum wants to see you.
Um...
Listen, Kerry,
I'd really rather you didn't...
Call you 'Dad'? Yeah.
What about 'Pops' or 'Dadda'?
Oh, 'David' is probably fine.
OK, Pops.
How are you feeling?
- Shithouse.
- Hmm.
But everyone gets really worried if I'm not OK.
You know, they tested my marshmallow.
Marshmallow?.
Bone marrow, marshmallow.
I don't think she should do this.
The risks are really minimal, Janice.
Oh, thanks for your concern, David.
I understand you've got reservations and this is a big thing for an adult to do, let alone a child.
Yeah, but look, the procedure, it's very straightforward.
It's like giving blood.
They harvest the bone marrow and they return the blood.
I know what the procedure is.
How are we all?
Good, thanks.
- Ready to do this?
- Yeah.
You'll be right, mate.
I guess kids, they're just so resilient.
So, folks, young Kerry here's undergone the tests to determine if she's a match for Jack.
And they have HLA compatibility of 6/6 markers, which is pretty much as close as you can get.
So we have a match.
Congratulations.
Come see me when you're ready.
Kerry's a match, honey.
Cool.
That's very cool.
- Very cool.
- Are you sure you want to do this?
Mum.
You're 15, Kez. You need my consent.
And his, apparently.
- Oh, I don't think...
- Of course you don't. You never did.
Please, Janice.
He's a really sick boy. I need you to...
Please, I can see.
I've always wanted a brother.
- First I've heard.
- Mum, Jesus, stop it.
Will you just... will you just nod your head?
Like this.
Mum, I really, really want to do this.
Please.
OK.
OK.
Where do I sign?
Um, I guess with the professor.
Thank you, Janice.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh...
You're going to be OK.
That's it! That's it!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
He's going to... 
Yeah! 
Yes!
Connor?
When did you get back?
A couple of days ago.
I, um... I went down to your shop.
Yeah, I haven't been in.
But you're OK?
I wanted to call.
I just... I didn't know where.
It's fine.
And Jack?
He's fine.
- He just came first in a race.
- What?
You didn't see him. I was screaming.
He wanted a boat.
Well, l, um...
I should go and see him, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, no, he'd love that.
- Help him de-rig.
Have you eaten?
Eaten? It's 5 o'clock.
Yes, but it's Saturday.
You... It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Ready, and... it'll come. Let it down.
All the way. That's it. Good.
Here it comes.
- Here it comes. Perfect!
- Whoo!
Great. And the jib. Lift that.
- Ready?
- Yep.
Come on down.

THE TWINS
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.
Opening of the will to her two children,
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.
"In accordance with the will, regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan, the notary, Jean Lebel, is named executor."
Hmm ... I must tell you here that it was your mother's decision.
I was personally against it, but she insisted.
You know ...
...your mother was more than an employee.
To my late wife and me you felt more like part of our family, so ...
I could not refuse.
Hum!
"All my assets are to be shared between the twins,
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."
"The money is to be equitably shared"
"My furniture distributed by mutual agreement."
"Burial"
"Notary Jean Lebel will bury me without a coffin, naked and without prayers."
"My face turned towards the ground, my back against the world."
"Tombstone and Epitaph"
"No headstone is to be placed on my grave and my name engraved nowhere."
"No epitaph is deserved for those who do not keep their promises."
"To Jeanne and Simon"
"Childhood is like a knife stuck in the throat which cannot be removed easily."
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will hand you an envelope."
"This envelope is for your father."
"Find him and hand him the envelope."
"Simon, the notary will hand you an envelope."
I've heard enough.
Oh ... but it's not finished.
Continue.
"Simon, the notary will hand you an envelope."
"This envelope is for your brother."
"Find him and hand it to him."
"When these envelopes have been handed to their addressees, a letter will be given to you."
"When the silence is broken, and the promise kept a stone may be placed on my grave and my name engraved on the stone."
I admit it's a bit strange.
Is there stuff to sign?
No, not today.
OK.
Thank you, Jean.
- Shall we?
- Wait.
You know, the history of our father.
You know, we have no brother.
Why did you let her write this?
I understand your surprise.
It's ... it's very surprising.
Stop pretending to be innocent!
We know that we speak of, there is nothing surprising in this.
We did not make these things up, Simon...
They are part of a will.
There's that, too.
Well, this morning your mother gave us something rather special.
We'll sleep on it, then ...
We'll meet again, huh?
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.
Sit down, Simon.
Look, Jean ... your secretary, she loved working for you.
She did this well all her life, congratulations.
Your secretary, however, was also my mother.
Then her job as a mother, that's another story.
Simon ...
You can bury your secretary in any way you wish.
But my mother, I want her buried in the normal way.
For once in your fucking life make it something normal.
This is not negotiable.
Take your time.
And come see me when Simon has calmed down.
I know it's very unusual, but ... your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.
We have a large family now.
She spoke of a traitor?
In a big family, there's always a dog.
How long will it be before we find the traitor?
Fucking crazy woman!
I'll fix that with Jean.
Fix what?
We'll give her a normal funeral.
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.
Where are you going?
You bury her any way you like!
Oh, stop!
You feel guilty because you were not there when she died.
You feel guilty because you were there when she had her accident.
You need to stop you feeling guilty for everything!
I am not feeling guilty about anything.
Do you realize the significance of what he just read?
Well, she's gone!
It's over, I'm at peace!
I have fucking peace!
I'm at peace now.
Yes, I see.
Mathematics as you have known so far have aimed to achieve a precise and definitive response to precise and definitive problems.
Now, you are about to enter into entirely different adventure.
The subject will be intractable problems that will always lead to other problems just as intractable.
People around you will repeatedly insist that what you are doing is hopeless.
You'll have no argument to defend yourself, because they will be of an overwhelming complexity.
Welcome to pure mathematics, the land of loneliness.
This is my assistant,
Miss Jeanne Marwan.
Hello!
We will start with the conjecture of Syracuse.
What does your intuition tell you?
Your intuition is always right.
That's why you got potential to becoming a real mathematician.
But over there, you'll need help.
Do you have any family there?
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.
You've come to learn that a) your father is alive; and b) you have another brother.
This is ridiculous
What is ridiculous to question the inevitable.
You need to know.
Otherwise, your mind will never be at peace.
And peace of mind has nothing to do with pure mathematics.
You need a starting point.
My father died during the war in Daresh.
That's the unknown variable in the equation.
You never start with the unknown variable.
My mother used to speak about a village called Der Om, in Fouad.
She graduated in French at the University of Daresh.
If she studied, there is hope.
Said Haidar.
You'll go knock on the door Said Haidar an old friend of mine who teaches at Daresh.
You can trust him.
What are you doing?
Mom! Are you Okay?
Madam, that's my towel, please.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
What happened?
Where's Jeanne?
Mom?
Does she suffer from migraines?
No.
- Memory loss?
- No.
Loss of balance?
No.
Absent-minded?
She's always absent.
No, she was never absent.
Wahab, come.
Just get out of my sister's way.
Son of refugees, where do you think you're going?
Nicolas, stop!
Go back to your country.
Wahab!
We'll leave your hide in your camps, believe me.
Give me.
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.
You have sullied the family honor.
- Enough!
Go home!
Go home!
Outside.
What have you done!
You have humiliated us!
You have sullied the name of our family!
Why God have you plunged us in the dark?
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?
I'm pregnant, grandma.
- My God, everything is black.
Why?
Why have you done this?
Do I have to kill you?
What will I do with you?
Come.
Eat if you want your child safe.
Listen to me.
There's nothing here for you.
I'll help after the birth.
I want you to go away.
You'll go to live with your uncle Charbel.
There, you'll go to school.
To learn to read, to learn to think out of this misery.
Promise me and I'll help you.
Promise me you'll go to school.
I promise you, grandmother.
I promise.
Shh.
Shh.
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Come on, it's time for you to go.
I feel that something terrible is coming ...
One day I'll find you, my son.
I received a message from my friend Niv Cohen but I can't help you because at the time,
I taught
History of Mathematics in Paris.
Specifically, the period where Euler had succeeded to give the first formal mathematical resolution to the problem of the seven bridges of Konigsberg, yes.
Diderot defied the Court saying:
"Gentlemen ..."
I-ft plus
Equals zero.
So, God exists!"
Niv, Niv, Niv ...
Hello! Do you speak French?
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone who would have known this woman.
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.
Are you kidding me?
I wasn't even born.
Well, you're in the wrong place...
I'm not kidding.
I'm sure you know someone who can help me.
I have come from far away.
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.
You are very kind.
I'm not nice, I want to get rid of you.
Najat, that's me.
You have time to waste?
That tells me something.
She may have worked in the campus newspaper.
It's been a long time.
People who leave usually change identities.
It is striking nonetheless.
Your mother was photographed in Kfar Ryat.
Look here.
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.
It is a prison in the south.
You do not know Kfar Ryat?
- No.
You're definitely not from here.
You don't know the South.
If the international community does not intervene now
The refugees in overcrowded camps at the border ...will be massacred.
She has arrived.
OK.
We, the students, are oppose against the Nationalist Party that are trying to evict the refugees across the borders.
The National Party supports militias of the Christian right, who make open threats against the refugees.
In the South, the refugees are now armed.
And have the support of much of the country's Muslim population.
But you ...you're a Christian.
We are for peace.
Religion has nothing to do with it.
Nawal!
Put the radio!
They've come to close the University!
The Nationalists have closed the campus!
Nawal, come back.
Stay here.
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists are closing the campus!
There will be clashes.
Stay with me.
There is shooting outside ...
To the table, girls!
Mom, they're attacking the university!
It's not a reason not to eat!
Aioua?
Christian villages were attacked in the South this morning.
May God protect us!
That's why they closed the university.
In short time, it will explode here as well.
We'll go to the mountain until it calms down.
For how long?
We start tomorrow.
The rest of the family is already there.
And the school?
Anyway, the school will close.
Only God knows how long.
And Le Journal?
Don't be afraid.
Le Journal can survive without us for a while.
But ideas only survive if someone is there to defend them!
Exactly, Rafqa.
Exactly.
There are only two orphanages in the region.
I will join you soon.
You will not go there now!
You had promised Grandma you would finish your studies.
You heard your father.
It's going to explode across the country if they attack the camps.
The studies are finished.
I think of him every day.
That's my child.
I want to find him alive.
I'm going to fetch water from Shadia.
Hurry, Nawal.
- Your name?
- Nawal.
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.
Where are you going?
South.
What for?
To meet my husband.
Wahab.
You have only daughters?
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked yesterday.
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?
There.
The children?
Where are the children?
You should speak with those who were there.
The muslim villagers fled to the camp Deressa.
They fear reprisals will come.
The children may be with them.
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?
I am a Christian.
My daughter! My daughter!
Mom!
Hi, Simon, it's me!
I am in Mama's village.
I wish you were here with me.
Listen.
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.
I told you never to come here again!
Hello!
Souha?
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!
I told you not to say that again!
Hello.
Can I help you?
Hello.
Does anyone speak French or English?
Where's Sami?
Marhaba!
Marhaba!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Uh, Jeanne.
Jeanne.
Jeanne.
Uh ...
Thank you.
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!
Hello.
My name is Samia.
I am Jeanne Marwan.
Thank you for helping me.
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.
Really?
Well, I'm from Canada.
I'm looking for Souha.
She is Souha.
She is my great-grandmother.
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.
The people in the corner shop told me to come see you.
I am looking for my father.
His name is Wahab.
Uh ...My mother's name is Nawal Marwan.
She was born here.
We do not know her.
Of course you know her.
The Marwan family was struck with shame.
When the war came.
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.
She does not know Wahab.
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter, you're not welcome here.
Go home.
She is looking for her father, but she doesn't know who is her mother.
I arrived at the end of the massacre in the Deressa refugee camp.
Everything was burning.
I looked for my son amid waves of blood.
I was disheartened by what I saw and heard.
You claim to be against our enemy.
That does not make you our friend.
Chamseddine. why would he trust you?
My son's father was a refugee from Deressa.
My son has been swallowed by the war.
I have nothing to lose.
My hatred is great toward the Nationalists.
This is not what you wrote in Charbel's journal.
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage peace with words and books.
I believed that.
Life has taught me something else.
What are you going to do now?
Teach the enemy what life has taught me.
That's good. That's good.
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.
So in French?
I ... I am much better, Dad.
They say "a lot" or "best" but never both at the same time, my darling.
I want my son to learn to speak several languages.
I want him to understand others without an intermediary.
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?
My mother is very well.
Tomorrow.
Marhaba.
Hello, beautiful.
Good morning.
Then you will be going out with us on Thursday?
No.
Friday?
No.
Saturday?
No.
We are patient!
Me too.
Never forget:
"Always" is "always".
Fucking bitch.
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was condemned in several reports by Amnesty
International.
Here is the women's section.
The cells are larger.
Some prisoners remained there up to 15 years.
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.
Just after the war began.
They have 600 political prisoners jailed.
You can come in, eh?
I'll take a picture.
You know this woman?
No.
She was imprisoned here.
I don't know her.
It was a really long time ago, you know? I...
Maybe you know someone who worked here.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.
I am the school janitor.
Yes, but before, what were you?
Before, hum!
That was before I became the school janitor.
It's been a long time since I'm caretaker of the school.
You know this woman?
She was in Kfar Ryat.
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.
I am looking for someone who knew her.
Someone who could tell me about her.
This is my mother.
This is the woman who sings.
Number 72.
It was she who murdered the militia leader of the christian right.
They made her pay dearly.
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.
They used to call her the woman who sings because she sang all the time.
Han, you are sure it's her?
I spent 13 years as a watchman.
Have you ever spent 13 years overseeing someone?
They did everything to make her break.
In the end, she was still standing,
She looked ...
Ah! Never seen anything like it.
She never broke.
It was exasperating.
And then they sent Abu Tarek.
Who's that?
Abu Tarek...
You know, sometimes it's better not to know everything.
Sir, I live with it anyway.
Continue.
Abu Tarek...
Abu Tarek was a investigation specialist.
He raped her repeatedly to break her before being released.
To stop her from singing.
Eventually she became pregnant.
It was like that.
I'll never forget it.
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.
They waited ... for her to give birth in prison then they let her go.
The child?
Did you see the child?
There was a doctor who came sometimes.
I think he's crazy.
Others say he has a restaurant in Tel Aviv ...
That's bullshit.
He went mad and died.
His nurse, I know her.
She lives in Daresh.
In Daresh?
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...
Mom, she was raped.
Our brother, she had him in prison.
I need you here.
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS
This, Simon, are notary Amyott contracts from 1868 to 1892.
His son took over, 脡douard, until 1925.
All the contracts are hand-written.
My grandfather, Charles, my father, Henry.
And me.
Yeah, well, it stops there because as you know,
I am the last of the Lebel.
I'll show you the will of a man ...
...which took several lives.
His heirs have discovered he had three wives, all at the same time.
One here, one in Miami, and another in Honduras, where he did business.
No, no ...he not longer has three children in the file there, no
There are eight.
That is sport, my man.
Look. Hum!
Death is never the end of a story.
There are still traces.
If you want to find your brother, you'll have to go back into your mother's past.
Jean, I'm going to fetch my sister, that's all.
I'll take care of that.
Two, three small matters to take care, then it will take no time.
Well, get your business ready we should go in ...
My passport ...
"We"? Don't you worry that you already done enough already
Exactly, this is not the time to let you down.
Make a man out of you, Simon.
I know that you need me.
We'll get it, then come back.
I promise.
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan, a notary is on the order of the sacred.
Sing now.
Gently, gently.
He is coming out.
We can see the head.
Push, push.
Go, girl.
The first came out.
Rest now ...
I'm proud of you.
Get ready for the second.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you doing?
You are going to dump them in the river as usual.
- It's dangerous.
- No.
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.
I want to take care of them.
These are the children of the woman who sings.
Oh, this country is a war zone after another, eh!
It's not complicated.
If the notary had existed at the time of Noah, we would not be here.
We need only to find the original contracts.
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.
And we talk more about it.
Everyone would be happy.
Notaries have existed only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.
That's the problem.
I should have been here from the beginning.
Thank you again for your help, Me Maddad.
The pleasure is all mine, my dear fellow.
I have the result that you have requested via email.
Simon my file on the seat beside you.
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?
You are very nice, but the delay and everything ...
I think I'll wait until later.
But I'll summarize.
For the father, it is rather difficult because I can not find the death certificate.
For the brother ...
Excuse me, but what are we talking about here?
I asked for help, Simon.
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand to speed things up.
I told you, Jean, we came for Jeanne.
Your sister is the one person in your family easiest to find.
I'm so glad you're here.
Me too.
OK, that's the nurse's name. which helped your mother give birth in prison.
We can go today.
Jeanne, that's enough.
No, you shut up, then follow me.
It's your job to find our brother, not mine!
Then, if you don't do it for her or for you, the, do it for me!
She is at the American hospital.
I'm glad you're here, Jean.
Me too, my owl, me too.
If she is sleeping, you must return later.
Ms. Maika?
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.
Bonjour, Madame!
Thank you for having us.
We seek someone you know.
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison as a nurse?
She says she knows your mom.
You helped our mother give birth in prison?
Yes.
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.
Can you help us?
She worked in the prison of Kfar Ryat.
She assisted her during childbirth.
She gathered the children.
Then she gave them back to the woman who sings when she got out of prison.
Nawal Marwan gave birth to twins.
Hush, hush, hush.
Hush, hush, hush.
You really know the woman who sings?
You don't know what it means to me.
Nawal Marwan worked for me as a secretary for 18 years.
My wife and I, we had taken a liking to her and her children.
But I confess that I didn't really know her till the end.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Hmm ...
Me Maddadi has conducted an investigation, at my request, to track your brother and your father.
For the father, Abu Tarek,
I still have not found a death certificate.
The country has a lot of certificates missing.
He could have gone abroad.
That's what happened with this kind of characters.
They are dead or have disappeared.
You have to see.
Maybe it's better that way.
For the brother ... your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan, comes from the village of Der Om.
She gave the child to a midwife who's named Elham who herself returned it to the orphanage in Kfar Kout in May 1970.
The main task was to trace the registry records.
Many documents have been lost in the war.
But I found the records which were recovered and donated by the Sisters of Charity to the National Archives.
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham filed a petition for adoption of a male child.
This is the only boy in the orphanage filed in that month.
Look.
It was registered under the name Nihad.
The dates match.
That's him.
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.
Orphanage Kfar Kout,
Nihad May.
It's his name in the registry.
Nihad from the month of May.
They gave him a temporary name with the month of arrival.
There was no adoption during that period.
It was the beginning of the war.
The orphanage was destroyed four years later.
We must ask those that destroyed the orphanage in Kfar Kout to know what happened to the children.
Between you and me, with what happened in the region ... there is not much hope.
They are probably also dead.
I'm not saying they're dead.
I say we lost track of them.
They are both dead.
We open the envelopes, that's it, then.
That I will not allow, Simon.
This kind of thing is sacred.
Luckily, I have a history.
Excuse me.
It is still worth exploring.
But it is a little radical.
The warlord that demolished the orphanage at that time is still alive.
And he may know what happened to Nihad's children and where they went.
It's already been an eternity.
You must understand that during this period there were a series of reprisals which fit one another in a sort of inexorable logic,
A warlord is exactly the type of man who has a long memory.
And he will remember, believe me.
Wallat Chamseddine, is his name.
We can find him here?
If we don't find him, he will find us.
But we can try something.
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?
It's your turn.
You will go to the Deressa refugee camp.
You will come to tea anywhere in the camp with the person that invite you.
And you say you are the son of the woman who sings and are looking Nihad May.
You can not go there alone.
I'll find someone to accompany you.
Welcome to Deressa.
Ha! Ha! You know where you are going, Simon?
I know.
How are you?
In the name of God, you've grown!
I have finished my engineering studies.
I cannot find work, so I'm a taxi driver now.
What brings you here?
I am with some foreign visitors, who asked me to bring them here.
Welcome, come.
No, thank you, we're in a hurry.
Please, come.
He is inviting us to tea.
Oh, good!
Uh, I wonder why you have come to Deressa.
I am looking for someone named Nihad de Mai.
He does not know Nihad de Mai.
He asks me what are your names.
My mother comes from the village of Der de Om, in the South.
My mother is the woman who sings.
Yes, that's fine. Done.
Wait for what?
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.
We are here to offer help.
You will be back in an hour.
Can I tell my sister?
No, you'll be back in an hour, I promise.
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.
He will call.
He's going to go.
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.
Ah, I told you: the South, a spark and it exploded.
Oh, okay.
You have been luck with us, we'll help in our own way.
You must leave the country.
It'll be easier.
We will find you a house and a job.
I want your life to be better.
We have many contacts in America.
You gotta go with your children.
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.
The children will help you, you'll see.
You cannot ask me.
Your children are our children, Nawal.
Your family is our family.
Trust me.
I'll help you.
I'm here for you and your children.
Hello, Sarwan.
Excuse my introduction, but it is for your protection.
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.
Tell me, what can I do to help, Sarwan Marwan?
You knew my mother.
They say she worked for me.
What can I do to help?
I am looking for a man named Nihad de Mai.
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?
He's my brother.
My mother asked me to find him.
And how can you prove that
Nihad de Mai is the son of Nawal Marwan?
My brother was placed for adoption at the Kfar Kout orphanage.
We found the registry with the original file.
The dates ... Everything fits.
Nihad de Mai is my brother.
Me and my friends, we attacked the christian village at Kfar Kout ...
In response to attacks that our brothers, the refugees, were victims of.
There was an orphanage in Kfar Kout.
I saved the children.
I took them with us.
And Nihad was among them.
We have trained and prepared them so that they can fight alongside us.
Nihad, he had a gift.
He was at unique.
And soon it became a formidable fencer.
But he wanted to find her mother.
He sought her for a long time.
Nihad, I do not know what he saw or heard.
He started ... a crazy war.
He came to see me, he wanted to be a martyr so that his mother should see his picture everywhere on the walls around the country.
But I refused.
He went back to Daresh.
He became a maverick, one of the most dangerous in the region.
A real machine.
He pulls on everyone.
And then there was the enemy invasion.
And one morning ...
They captured Nihad.
He killed seven gunmen.
They did not killed them.
They captured him and sent him to the prison in Kfar Ryat.
He has been in prison?
Yes.
He is the executioner.
He worked with my father?
- No, he did not work with Abu Tarek, your father.
- Are you okay?
One plus one ... that makes two.
What?
One plus one makes two.
You can not make one.
Hey, you have a fever.
Jeanne?
One plus one, does it make one?
Are there are empty seats, no.
Oh, move ahead if you want.
Can I help you, ma'am?
Excuse me.
By becoming a hangman
your brother has changed its name.
He became Abu Tarek.
Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.
We know that he now lives in Canada
under a new identity.
Nihad Harmanni.
Mr. Harmanni?
Yes?
This is for you.
My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.
I recognized you.
But you didn't.
It's a wonderful miracle.
I'm your number 72.
This letter will be delivered by our children.
You will not recognize them
because they are beautiful,
but they know who you are.
Through them, I want to tell you
you're still alive.
But soon, you'll be quiet.
I know.
Because silence is all to the truth.
Signed: The whore 72.
I speak to my son.
I am not talking to the executioner.
Whatever happens, I will always love you.
That's the promise I made you at birth, my son.
Whatever happens, I will always love you.
I've searched my whole life.
I found you.
You, you could not recognize me.
You have your tattoo on the right heel.
I've seen it.
I recognized you.
And I found you beautiful.
I'll remember you with all the sweetness of the world, my love.
Console yourself because nothing is more beautiful
than being together.
You were born of love.
Your brother and your sister were also born of love.
Nothing is more beautiful than to be together.
Your mother, Nawal Marwan.
Prisoner number 72.
"When these envelopes have been handed
"to the addressee,
"You will be given a letter."
"The silence will be broken,
"a promise kept,
"A stone may then be placed on my grave, and my name engraved on the stone facing the sun."
My love ...
Where did your story begin?
When you were born?
Then she starts in horror.
At the birth of your father?
Then she begins a great love story.
I say that your story begins with a promise
that will break the thread of anger.
Thanks to you, today I finally managed to do it.
The thread is broken.
And I can finally take the time to rock you in my arms... and softly sing you a lullaby
to comfort you.
Nothing is more beautiful than to be together.
I love you.
Your mother, Nawal.
Hey.
You haven't changed. Please, take a seat.
How is your sister?
I have three sisters.
The one with the big tits.
The one I always wanted to fuck.
I hear good things, Latif.
It says here you can shoot straight.
Officer material, promoted already.
Lieutenant.
Please, help yourself.
Juice?
I won't keep you guessing, Latif.
I want you to come and work for me.
-Work for you'?
-Here, in Baghdad.
Like old friends.
-We were friends, weren't we, at school?
-Classmates.
Didn't you once paint a picture of my father'?
-You still have it?
-I gave it to you.
I have an awful feeling
I told him I did it myself.
Do you know who this is?
-Of course.
-No, no, no.
It is not who you think it is.
His name is Faoaz al-Emari.
Not Saddam. I see him all of the time.
In the newspapers, in the magazines, on television.
Even I cannot tell who is who.
It is not so unusual, Latif.
Stalin had a double. He had dozens.
So did the Shah.
The country is at war.
My father cannot be expected to be everywhere at once.
Half the time there is no good reason, but the people, they expect it.
Add to that there is always the chance some fucked-up Shi'a scum will take a shot at him.
Look at yourself, Latif.
Look. Look, look.
Look at me.
We could be twins, no?
You are taller.
How much? This much?
Didn't they used to say you looked like Uday Saddam Hussain?
Didn't they used to say that at school?
I want you, Latif.
I want you to be my fidai.
I want you to be my brother.
Don't say anything.
Take 10 minutes.
Think it over.
What happens if I say no?
Ten minutes.
He is shitting bricks.
His grandfather was a Kurd. It's a pity.
But the family's been in Baghdad a long time.
His father's done well.
I believe he sells domestic appliances.
He's never said a word against the party.
Latif is the best we could find.
And we looked.
Well, I have to have him.
You will have whatever you want.
Everything I own will belong to you.
Uday,
I am my father's son.
I would give my last drop of blood for Iraq.
But when this war is over,
I'm going to work in his business.
I am the eldest son.
I have brothers and sisters.
I have given them my word.
-Sleep on it.
-Uday...
You are asking me to extinguish myself.
Thought it over?
Please be clear about this, Latif.
Uday has chosen you. You belong to him.
You have about five minutes to think about this before a car pulls up outside your house in AI-Adhamiya and your family, every one of them, your father, your mother, your sisters and brothers, is thrown into Abu Ghraib.
God willing, they will die quickly.
I've said too much.
You have about two minutes left.
You'll have a cook and four maids.
These pretty girls will get you anything you feel like.
Strawberries in winter, figs in July.
Just ask.
But lay a finger on one of them without prior permission and you'll never walk upright again.
And these are Uday's rooms.
He wants you to use them, now that you are to be his brother.
Leather sofas, Italian marble, all designed by Gianfranco Giannelli.
Handmade shoes, suits,
Brioni, Versace, Armani, of course.
Silk ties, watches. Breitling, Cartier, Rolex.
Silk pajamas.
These are very nice.
Poor child never knows what to wear.
He changes his mind every five minutes.
Depends on what car he's driving.
Honestly, habibi, that boy, he wears me out.
You should probably clean yourself up.
No calls.
Incoming, yes. Outgoing, no.
My name is Munem Hammed al-Tikriti.
We're going to be seeing a lot of each other.
I write to my mother once a week.
She's going to think that I got killed in Iran.
Inshallah.
Inshallah?
My family are going to think that I'm dead.
Let them think you died a martyr.
I know it's difficult, but it's what Uday wants.
He will accept nothing less.
She will be knocking on the door of every hospital in Baghdad.
When you say your prayers tonight, when you tum out the light and close your eyes, this is what you should be saying to yourself,
"Latif Yahia is dead. He died in Iran.
"May God have mercy on him.
"Now I am Uday Saddam Hussein."
Guten Tag.
Take off your clothes, please.
Cough.
One more time.
And one more time, please.
Uday is three centimeters taller.
We can use built-up shoes.
Look at that. He is perfect.
-Uday, this is boring.
-Shut up.
How can you sit here all night looking at yourself?
-He looks great.
-He doesn't even look like you.
What?
His cock's too big.
What do you mean, his cock is too big?
Uday's life story. Learn it.
Come on, come on, tell me.
Shape of face, hair, nose, physique, all in the high 90s.
-Good.
-Your eyes are five millimeters bigger.
-They can use make-up.
-And the teeth? What about the teeth?
Two peas in a pod.
-I was just trying the teeth.
-Smile. Go on, smile.
No, no, no. Like this.
And do the hair. Do the hair.
You like the Rolex.
Keep it.
You look good in blue.
Yes, it definitely suits you.
Latif hurry up.
-There's too much ice.
-Can I say blue is your color?
Shut up.
I like the way you fight.
You fight like me.
He fights like me.
I had a word with Dr. Linz.
He says your cock's too big.
We need to make a surgical reduction.
-A what?
-Chop a bit off.
-What?
-Not much.
Just a teeny-weeny.
Not much?
My cock is well-known in Baghdad.
The women, they talk.
I'm joking with you, you fuck.
This is Said Kammuneh.
He's a member of the Iraqi Olympic Committee.
He has something to show you.
This is from the personal collection of Uday Saddam Hussain.
That guy, he was a police officer.
We were on the same football team.
Great left foot. Good in the air.
I shot this myself. Wait a minute.
Good work, huh?
We got a lot of this shit from the East Germans and the Russians.
See that guy'? That's Rakti, the wrestler.
He won a bronze medal in Moscow.
The President calls him the sharp sword of the Republic.
You know that gas station on Haifa Street by the lights?
The President gave him that.
The fat fuck's making 20 grand a month.
That's good money.
Look, I'll leave this with you.
-Seen enough?
-Enough?
Have I seen enough?
I remember the day Saddam Hussein became president of this country.
I was still in short trousers.
We ran through the streets, shouting,
"Saddam! Saddam Hussain!
Saddam Hussein!" Firing our guns.
Even my father. Even my father.
This stuff, Munem...
These people".
I hope Said said something about this.
They're criminals, deserters.
Pornographers, counterfeiters, murderers, of course.
Putschists. Enemies of the Republic.
Saddam Hussein built this country.
Never forget that.
The schools, the roads, hospitals, the mosques.
He gave the Iraqi people everything they want.
He demands only one thing in return.
Never raise a hand against his family.
Do so and you will suffer.
The people you love will suffer.
Do well here, work hard and you'll be one of the family.
One day all this will be over. Inshallah.
Inshallah?
Only God knows when.
Come, come, come, come, come.
Munem disapproves. Look at him.
He's angry with me.
He thinks I should leave you at home.
-Who's this?
-Latif'? He's my brother.
Nobody must know this, but Saddam, he has three sons.
You tell anybody this,
I will have to out your tongue out with a razor and feed it to the cat.
Everything I own, I give to him.
You don't own me.
Sarrab, best fuck in Beirut.
Loosen your tie. Let me do it for you.
There. Isn't that better?
Ba careful what you say.
I can read your mind.
Are you really the President's son?
You know what they say on TV.
We are all the President's sons.
Hey!
Hey!
Look at him.
He can't keep his hands off that drag queen.
Poor Uday.
Sometimes I think he wants to fuck himself to death.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Keys.
Give me the keys.
Give me the fucking keys!
Baby, I so love your tits!
I hope so, lover. You paid for them.
What have you done with my brother?
You sea, Munem?
Discipline. We must have discipline.
If we do not have discipline, we have no control.
If we have no control, we have chaos.
If we have chaos, we have disorder.
You do understand, Latif? It is quite simple.
We must have discipline.
Got it?
Got it?
Good.
Latif. Five minutes.
Latif.
-No, no, no!
-We must have discipline!
Discipline! We must have discipline!
How was that, Munem?
Excellent.
Sorry.
Good.
Empty your pockets.
My grandfather, he talks to me the same way ha did when I was 10 years old.
God is great.
He gave me two sons.
Now I have three.
Make sure you give me no reason to be angry with you.
And?
Uday, you owe me 50 dinar.
50 dinar?
You see?
Trying to get money from your brother is like trying to get blood from a stone.
What?
It's not him.
What?
It's your turn, brother.
Fuck them. Fucking Kuwaitis.
I hate them all.
Worse than horseflies.
My brothers, welcome to Baghdad.
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fucking Kuwaitis!
I fucking hate Jews, I hate horseflies and I hate fucking Persians, but I hate fucking Kuwaitis more!
They insult us.
They are filth. They maul our women.
The Kuwaitis have been stealing $280 million a year from the oilfields at Rumaila.
$280 million a year!
You know we traced the weapon.
I just know the fucking Kuwaitis are behind this!
I hope my father wipes them out.
No, I'm telling you this.
I don't care who knows it!
The age of the sheikhs is over. Over!
-What?
-It's me, habibi.
What are you doing right now?
I'm getting my nails done. Nice and sharp.
The better to scratch you with.
Did I ever tell you how much I love your ass?
It's the best ass in Baghdad.
I'll see you soon.
Hey, you, you!
You'll meet many women.
Whores, wealthy women from AI Mansour who come looking for a favor and offer you favors in return.
Schoolgirls he snatches off the street.
-You'll be given your fair share.
-Ready, guys?
Never even speak to a woman
Uday has chosen for himself.
He is insane.
You know it, Munem.
He's insane.
You tum a blind eye. You have no choice.
I understand that.
You are a good man in a bad job.
Look at him.
He's psychotic.
Come on, kiss. Kiss more. More. Kiss, kiss.
Who wants to sleep with me tonight? You?
Through the window of a British worker's Hat, the Battle of Kuwait unfolds.
Saddam Hussein, very simply, you cannot bully your neighbor
You cannot wipe him out, a member of the Arab League, a member of the United Nations.
Saddam Hussein!
The hero of the Battle of Qadisiyyah.
The knight of the Arab nations.
Direct descendant of the prophet.
Saddam the noble fighter.
Scion of the family of Imam al-Hussein.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Uday Saddam Hussain.
The age of the sheikhs is over!
With the help of Almighty God,
Kuwait has come home!
Hey, you. The teeth. You with the teeth.
Come on. I'll give you a ride.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You!
NO, no, HO, DO. You, you, you.
Hey, you.
Don't be scared. Come for a ride.
Come on, get in the car.
I'll give you a lift home.
I'll take you back.
Hey, don't be scared.
Why do you run'? Why do you run?
Come on. Why are you running?
I'll take you home.
Come on.
Hey. How about you?
I love what you've done with your hair.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
It's all right.
You're beautiful. Don't be scared.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Brother, she's beautiful. You want her?
-Take.
-No!
What? What?
Don't fucking look at me like that.
-Like what?
-Like that.
I know that fucking look.
I know what you're thinking.
Think what the fuck you like.
I like cunt. I want cunt.
I see a cunt, I want to fuck it. I don't care.
I love my country,
I love my mother, my father.
But I love cunt more than I love God!
Does her mama know that she's out?
You know this man?
This is Kamel Hannah.
He's my father's greatest friend.
He tastes his food.
Did she get a note from her teacher?
See this watch?
You see this watch?
How much you think a watch like this costs?
How much? How much you think a watch like this costs? $10,000.
It's a $10,000 watch.
My father bought him that watch.
Why? Why did my father buy Kamel Hannah a watch like this?
Shall I tell you why? Shall I tell you why?
Shall I tell you why my father loves Kamel Hannah so much?
-Because he gets his whores for him.
-Rubbish.
Our mother... Our mother sits around the house and weeps because of the whores this man brings my father.
She wanders, she walks around the palace, walks around the palace, staring in the mirrors, staring in the mirrors, looking at herself like a fucking zombie because of the whores this man brings my father!
-Shall I kill him, brother?
-Uday.
What do you think, brother?
What do you think? Shall I kill him?
Kill your father's greatest friend?
He is a twittering little pimp that has driven my mother mad.
-Maybe I'll lat you kill him for me.
-Uday.
No.
I don't know him. It's meaningless.
If I am going to kill somebody,
I want to know why I'm going to do it.
Uday.
Uday.
-You fucker!
-Easy, easy.
You should be ashamed of your...
Motherfucker.
Come into my bedroom. Come on.
Would you like a drink? A nice drink?
I like to drink whiskey.
Take it, here, here.
Would you like some?
Would you like some?
That's it. In just one. In one. In one.
You're very beautiful.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Beg me... Beg me to fuck you.
Beg me. Go on, beg me to fuck you.
He humiliate me.
Why not? Just say it.
Beg me. Bag me to fuck you.
-I can't.
-Come on.
-I...
-Yes?
-...beg...
-...beg...
...you... I can't.
-Go on.
-No.
-Beg me. Beg me.
-No.
Beg me! Bag me to fuck you.
Beg me to fuck you.
Beg me to fuck you.
Beg me to fuck you! Beg me!
-Beg! Beg! Beg!
-I beg...
Yassem! Yassem!
-Who's doing that?
-That pig, Kamel Hannah. Ha won't stop.
He says he doesn't take orders from faggots.
Stop!
-Fuck you.
-I order you to stop!
I don't take orders from you!
I take orders from Saddam Hussain.
Uday, Uday...
No! No!
Boss, come on. Let's go.
Just get her out of here, okay?
He took pills, sleeping pills.
Give me the knife.
"A b o o d i 12"
You'll kill him.
The loss of blood and...
I should have gelded him at birth.
At 7:00 tonight the armed forces of the United States began an operation at the direction of the President to force Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait and to end his occupation of their country.
That's the latest Tomahawk cruise missile to fly just over our position here.
Anti-aircraft gunners all around have been trying to shoot them down.
I have said to the people of Iraq that our quarrel was not with them, but instead with their leadership and above all with Saddam Hussein.
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.
Millions of dollars a year.
Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars.
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.
Millions of dollars a year.
From the oilfields.
From our oilfields at Rumaila.
Kuwait.
Kuwait, Kuwait.
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!
Millions of dollars a year from our oilfields at Rumaila.
Our country is losing more than a billion dollars a year!
Take the glasses off.
What are you doing hero?
-How did you get in?
-Do you want me to go?
Why are you wearing Ray-Bans at 1:00 in the morning?
Take them off.
-I want to be sure it's you.
-Are you sure'?
I can always tell.
You cannot stay here.
Have you seen what's going on outside?
Hear what Saddam said on television?
"The mother of all battles"
Iraqi people are not stupid.
Nobody believes that crap.
Iraq is going to burn to the ground.
We won't see that on TV.
And Uday? Is he reporting for duty?
No. Uday has gone to bed with a splitting headache because Yassem AI-Helou forgot to press his tweed hunting breaches.
He's a child. He'll tire of you.
He tires of everything.
One day soon, he'll tire of me and I'll end up at the bottom of the lake with the fish.
Today he's infatuated with you.
He's quite dazzled.
He thinks he made you up, just like that, out of the dust.
Tomorrow he snaps his fingers and you vanish.
But you can leave, Sarrab.
If I run away, he'll find me.
If he can't find me, he'll find my sister.
Who's going to protect me from Uday Hussein? You?
This is the way it is in Iraq.
It's him.
Latif?
I cannot sleep.
Take a pill.
You may kiss me now.
You must go to Basra, my son.
-What did he say?
-It's not him.
-Of course it's him.
-You don't know your own father?
-It wasn't him.
-Of course I do. What did he say?
Basra.
Basra?
Fuck Basra.
Don't expect me to go.
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!
Millions of dollars a year from the oilfields at Rumaila!
Our country is losing more than a billion dollars a year!
What is Kuwait?
Who made up this country?
The thieving British!
In 1935 they picked up a pen and drew a line in the sand.
Kuwait is a fantasy!
-look, Mother. It's me.
-Kuwait is a lie!
Kuwait is the province of Iraq!
The age of the sheikhs is over!
-Qusay?
-Uday.
-Are you watching?
-He didn't fool me, my brother.
You can tell? How?
For one thing he's sober, and second he's not foaming at the mouth.
It's a hit!
-Let's go!
-Go! Go! Go!
You've lost a lot of blood.
We might have to lose the little finger.
Who's going to tell Uday?
Take more. Take more.
Monsieur:
What? What?
The little finger. Right hand.
They're doing their best.
Fuck!
Is it you?
It's me.
The Americans are saying
Uday has been shot by the Shi'a.
But I know Uday is in Geneva, gambling with his uncle.
He called me last night.
Yes, it is you.
-Where's Latif? Latif, with the finger?
-I'm busy. People are dying.
People are dying! People are dying!
People are fucking dying!
I know people are dying!
I know they are dying!
Men, women, Iraqi soldiers losing arms and fucking legs. Brave people.
I don't give a fuck! Do you understand me?
Do you understand me? Fuck them!
-I don't give a fuck!
-You must go. Now.
GO, go, go, go. You must go.
Save his finger.
If you fail to save this men's finger,
I will kill every one of you.
Iraq's army is defeated.
Our military objectives are met.
Kuwait is once more in the hands of Kuwaitis, in control of their own destiny.
Oh, my God. Look at that.
I could fuck that. I could really fuck that.
Could you fuck that'?
Yassem.
I wonder if she's a virgin.
Do you think she's a virgin?
It's her wedding day. It is the best day of her life. She is the man's bride.
Do you think she'll let me stick my finger up her ass?
You think?
Come over. Come on.
Come.
I do like that dress.
Come here, darling.
You're beautiful, very, very beautiful.
You having a nice day?
Come, let me kiss you.
Very good. My brother.
Nothing serious.
As you can see, rumors of my death
-are scandalous lies...
-It's me.
...put out by the Americans.
Scandalous lies that insult the intelligence of the Iraqi people.
Allahu akbar.
Allahu akbar?
Allah gives me nothing.
Everything I want I just take for myself.
Look at me.
I'm a fucking war hero.
Well, she's dead.
Find out who she is. Send them some dinars for the damage. Are you deaf?
I said pick up the phone, get hold of Said at the Olympic Committee.
-Do what I tell you.
-Do it yourself!
What? What did you say?
I said do it yourself.
I will not be part of this madness.
I will never let you go.
I will never let you go.
I love you too much.
Yassem.
I should have put a bulletin his head.
Then you would be just like him.
And you're not.
Praise God for that.
You're my Latif.
-You must go.
-No, he's gone. He's gone.
I know, but he'll be back. You must go.
How can you stand it'?
Why do you choose to live like this?
I didn't choose.
He chose me, just like he chose you.
You have a visitor.
I want you to do something for me.
I will look into this complaint.
If need be, I will talk to my father.
I'm a tired man.
I have a heart condition.
Look into my eyes. Look deep.
Can you see the pain there'?
This is the pain you give to the people of Iraq.
Pain that never ends.
Today I have come to seek justice.
Will I be shown any compassion?
Justice. Compassion.
Fuck this!
Is this him?
Your daughter was a whore. She enjoyed it.
She was 14 years old.
No man has ever touched her.
God gave her beauty.
This was her downfall.
This is too much. You are a criminal.
-All of Iraq knows your crimes.
-You are a good man.
Give him 1,000 dinars for her time.
That is good money for a whore.
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
I'll put a fucking bullet in your fucking head!
You, you, put a bullet in his head now.
Now!
-What has he clone?
-What has he done?
-He's a man who has lost his daughter.
-You heard what ha said about you?
-About me?
-About you, Uday Saddam Hussain.
It was not me who snatched her off the street.
I didn't beat her.
If you want to kill him, kill him yourself.
You think you can pick and choose?
You think you can pick and choose?
You are nothing!
Without ma, you'd be hanging from a fucking lamppost on Haifa Street.
I made you, Latif. I made you.
I gave you life.
If I want, I'll fucking take it away.
Now put a bullet in his head.
I'm not going to kill this man.
Kill me if you want.
-I don't care.
-You would die to save this man?
Go on, what are you waiting for'?
Kill me. Put a bullet in my head.
You're going to do it one of these nights when the mood takes you.
Why not now?
Go on, put a bullet in my head.
Never. I love you too much.
No.
You love Uday.
You are not afraid to die?
You forget.
I died the day I came here.
You do not fear God.
Let me make this easy for you.
I don't believe it.
Somebody get this on tape.
Yassem! Come film this.
-This is better than a porno movie!
-Get me the hospital.
-Get out of my way.
-Yassem, film this. Film this.
Yassem! Yassem!
Yassem!
Get help.
He's the last person I'd be going out with.
-But he's my best friend.
-Well, you go out with him, then.
-Go out with who'?
-Nobody, Baba.
Am I missing something hers?
-I'll get it.
-Yes, Baba.
Gallalha's getting married next week.
Is she? That's good.
Makes life much easier for me.
Baba!
It's Latif!
Ju'an, run along, habibi.
Uday Saddam Hussein invites you to a party.
His birthday.
He is never going to stop.
Son,
I don't want to know what you've done.
I want you to know that I absolutely trust you.
And I am proud of you.
One day, when God wills it, we'll have justice.
You must go.
You must leave this country, go as far away as you can, and don't come back until Uday Hussein is dead and buried.
He will come looking for me.
He will come here. You know that.
He will come looking for you.
Go to this party, drink his whiskey.
We must look for the right moment.
-Don't ask me to do this.
-Latif, I am an old man.
My life is here.
Everything I have made of my life.
God gave me life, my son.
When he wills it, he'll take it away.
You will do as you are told.
You.
You, you, in the blue dress.
In the blue dress.
Get it off. Get it off, all of it.
Get it off, get it off, get it off.
Go on, take, take, take.
All of you, all of you. You, in the gold.
Give me... Take off your dress.
Take off your dress!
It's Uday's birthday party for my friends and I want to see all of you naked, all of you!
Come on! Come on, naked.
More. Blue clothing. Take it off!
Now, off. All of it. Take your knickers off.
Beautiful ass. Beautiful ass.
Come on! Take it off!
This is birthday celebration!
Good, good, good. I like it.
And you. Don't hide yourself.
Let me see you.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You should show yourself.
It is a lot of beautiful people for my birthday.
-That Mercedes....
-It's not for sale.
I heard you'd take 30,000.
There are two things I never do, Said.
I never pass wind in the presence of the President of the Republic and I never do business with pimps like you.
Latif! Latif!
God is great.
He gives my brother back to me.
-You didn't?
-I did. Come.
Come, come, come, come, come.
I quite enjoyed it.
It hurt like hell.
I thought I would need stitches.
What is Sarrab going to say?
Sarrab?
What is Sarrab going to say?
Why the fuck should you care what Sarrab is going to say'?
Look at him.
Latif thinks because he looks like me, he dresses like me, he sleeps in my bed, he thinks he can fuck like me.
You think you can fuck my women?
He's jealous.
He wants to fuck you himself.
You know what this fucking Kurd said to me?
I offered him 30,000 dinars for that Mercedes.
He said he wouldn't sell it to a pimp.
Pimp? You called this gentleman a pimp?
-Gentleman'?
-He called you a pimp?
-Uday's.
-Uday's pimp? Uday's pimp?
-You called this man Uday's pimp?
-He's lying.
This man is my friend.
He is one of this country's most successful businessmen.
Businessman?
What business is that? Cunt?
-Sit down.
-I'm leaving.
-Sit down.
-Arr-1 you leaving? No?
I am leaving.
Sit down. I'm talking to you.
What do you want from ma, Uday?
You belong to me, Latif.
You do as I say. Sit down.
You are going to have to shoot me in the back.
Stop!
Stop! I order you to stop!
Fuck!
Take me with you.
You can't leave me here.
Kill him. He'd kill you.
I am not Uday.
Come on.
Keys.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
You let him go.
He had a gun.
You had a gun.
He took it.
Fuck.
Second thoughts?
I should've put you out back there.
Would've been the smart thing to do.
-That's what Uday would have done.
-Not so smart.
Uday would have killed me first.
-Do you have any money?
-No.
-Nothing?
-I'm not a prostitute.
Too bad.
Do you ride?
Well, what does it say?
What does it say, Munem?
Uday Saddam Hussein has fled Iraq.
Sit down.
Who is this woman?
Some whore he met.
Uday will make an appearance on the news at 1:00.
They're on their way here now.
She has no shoes on her feet.
This is what happens.
You give people an opportunity, lift them up, let them eat at your table, sleep in your bed.
And this is how they repay you.
Who is this?
I'm sitting here watching Ali fuck your sister up the ass.
I'm not joking with you, Latif
Come back to Baghdad.
We can smoke a pipe together.
Fuck some women, drive some cars.
Don't tell me you need time to think.
Don't keep me waiting, brother.
Don't force my hand.
Come back, Latif.
I miss you.
I've got no one here to talk to.
Think of your mother and your father.
How did he get this number?
We just walked through the door.
Uday knows everybody.
These people in Malta have a lot of business in Baghdad.
Half the people I know have money here.
They come to get their tits done.
We've got to get out of here.
We cannot stay hare.
We walk through the door and he's on the phone.
He will never leave us alone.
I know him, has a fanatic.
He will never stop.
You're not listening to me!
Stop shouting at me!
I have a child.
A little girl.
Tara.
Nobody knows this, not even Uday.
She's with my sister in Samarra.
You have to help me.
You have to do something, Latif.
She's three years old.
I can't leave my daughter in Iraq.
You tell me this now?
I was too frightened.
-I didn't know what you'd do.
-This is insane.
You are insane.
-What kind of a woman are you?
-There's nothing else, wallahi, I swear it.
What do you expect me to do?
Who is the father?
Talk to him.
Do you even know who the father is?
Now that's Uday talking. I can hear it.
He's dead.
I spoke to my sister.
She knows a man who can drive
Tara to Amman. He wants US dollars.
It was you.
What do you mean?
How else did Uday know where I was?
There is no other way.
You never say anything nice, do you?
You never say I look pretty.
You never ask me how I'm feeling.
You never tell me you love me.
When you make love to me, you're tender.
Only then.
Look at me, Latif.
Look at me.
What do you see?
Uday's whore?
-Is that what I am to you?
-I spoke to the operator.
He gave me a list of outgoing calls.
I didn't call the Iraqi Embassy three times.
It wasn't me who called the Iraqi Olympic Committee.
I got scared.
I was calling my sister.
-I was scared for my daughter.
-It was you, Sarrab.
You.
You called Uday. You told him where I was.
It was you.
Take what you want, Sarrab.
There is money in the hotel room.
My poor Latif.
And how is Sarrab?
Did she tell you about her daughter living with her sister'?
And you believed her.
Don't hang up the phone, motherfucker.
I have your father in my office.
Let me speak to him.
Come home, Latif.
Think of your father.
Come back to Baghdad.
I'm going to put your father on the phone.
I want you to listen to what he has to say to you.
He's going to toll you what to do.
Here.
Speak to your son.
Are you well, my son?
Yes, I'm fine. Listen, I have a plan.
I'm going to say this once, and it's my final word.
You will do as I tell you or you are no longer my son.
Tell this evil son of a bitch to goto hell.
Speak up, Latif.
What is it to be?
Goto hell.
Latif Yahia.
They took my father to Uday's office that morning.
They dropped his body off at 4:00 in the afternoon.
My mother was forbidden to give him a decent burial.
She was told to bury him in the garden.
Nothing will bring my wife back.
Or your father.
Why have you come here?
What do you want?
Hey, girls! Girls!
You, come and talk to me.
Hey, you. Come here.
Come. I'll take you home.
With the pretty hair.
You're very pretty. No, you are.
Please, come on. Where are you from?
Trying to get away from me, huh?
He's stopped.
Come on. Are they your friends?
Move. Ali. Ali, Yassem.
Get the fuck out! Move!
Yassem! Yassem!
Ali! Ali! No!
-No! Yassem! Yassem!
-This is for my wife!
Latif?
No! Please stop!
No! No!
Out of my way!
Move!
You, stop!
Move, move!
Stop!
Clear the area!
Clear the area!
Move!
ESSENTIAL KILLING (2010)
It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah.
Gate!
What's handcuffs in English?
Get him, boy! Get him!
Blood trail! Up there!
Follow the blood!
What the hell?
I put my trust in Allah,
My Lord and your Lord!
There is no living creature...
but He holds it by its forelock;
surely my Lord is on the right path.
- Everyone got wasted?
- A bottle per head!
Look, 500's coming.
Where did he get all this?
Stamp him, I'll wrap up here.
- Hey, you all take the north slope!
- Right, boss.
Fuck off...
Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you;
but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you,
and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you.
Allah knoweth, ye know not.
- Don't chop it into matches.
- Or toothpicks.
Better watch your fingers, buddy.
Are you crazy?!
Hope you choke on it!
Freak!
Leave me alone! Stop it!
Let go of it!
Let those fight in the cause of Allah
who sell the life of this world for the hereafter.
And whoever fights in the cause of Allah
whether he is slain or gets victory
soon shall we grant him a mighty reward.
Open the door!
You won't get anything out of her.
Mute as a stone.
Good evening.
Your husband home?
We're looking for someone.
He's armed and dangerous.
- Should we try sign language?
- I'm not making a fool of myself.
