BUG: Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
NEWSCASTER:
Before tonight's murder, there has been no clue as to who this killer might be.
But now the Riverton Ripper and the knife he uses have been caught by a high-definition security camera.
SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say that the killer is a Caucasian male in his mid-to-late 30s.
It's too dark to see his face but the quality of the image has allowed forensic technicians to zoom in and enhance it enough to make out the word ''Vengeance'' etched on the blade of the Ripper's weapon.
No one was in the area at the time...
SARAH: That's beautiful, Abel.
And Leah's going to love that house.
Shameless distraction device.
Come to bed.
The news is too scary for me to watch alone.
Okay, Sarah,
I'll be up soon.
NEWSCASTER: We consulted local psychiatrist
Dr. William Blake.
Oh, shit!
NEWSCASTER:
Here's what he had to say.
DR. BLAKE:
The identity of a killer of this sort may well not even be known to himself.
He could be anywhere and anyone leading a normal life, so far as he knows, and never dream for an instant that, every so often, he turns into a monster.
ABEL: What is this?
NEWSCASTER:
Twenty-one-year-old
Penny Anderson, a graduate student at Boston University...
WOMAN: (SCREAMING)
Somebody!
NEWSCASTER:
...studying for a Ph.D. in psychology.
WOMAN: Help me!
No!
NEWSCASTER:
The victim's funeral will be held tomorrow at...
Dear God, tell me this is a dream.
ABEL (AS JAMES):
What's with the knife, Abel?
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.
It's not my knife, James!
I don't know what's with it.
I think someone has broken in.
No one has broken in.
Come on, Penny.
FEMALE VOICE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.
A one in a million chance, he said.
What if it did?
He said to call him, 24/7.
(AS BRAD) Abel, listen.
Call him now. You've got to call Dr. Blake.
Please put down the knife.
Call the doctor.
FEMALE VOICE:
God will help you.
Call Dr. Blake, and I kill your family.
Sorry, sorry,
I just need a hug.
That knife is so scary, you know?
What knife?
SARAH: The Ripper's.
They've got it on tape.
RIPPER:
Don't do something stupid, Abel.
Here's the deal.
Just look the other way when I kill and your family stays alive.
Turn me in, and you'll live alone in a house of blood.
Hello?
Abel, this is Dr. Blake. ls everything okay?
No, no, no.
Everything is not okay.
I found something.
What did you find?
A knife.
Under my bench.
And not just any knife.
The one on TV.
The Ripper's knife.
I swear before God,
Dr. Blake, I didn't know.
But the second that I went to call you there was somebody, and he said don't call you, or else...
DR. BLAKE: Or else?
What?
Or else he would kill Sarah. And Leah.
And the others, too.
Abel, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
I want you to tell Sarah to take Leah, and drive to her sister's.
I haven't told her about this part of my life.
But you swore to me you would.
That's part of the agreement.
Just get here before it's too late!
DR. BLAKE: Abel, have Sarah drive to May's house, with Leah.
May is working nights and Sarah is sound asleep.
I can't just wake her up.
DR. BLAKE: You have to!
Abel?
You there?
Abel?
ABEL: No! No!
DR. BLAKE: What the hell are you looking at?
Break the door down.
ABEL: I won't let you do this! I won't!
DR. BLAKE:
Open the door. Abel!
ABEL: I won't...
DR. BLAKE: Abel!
PATERSON: Police, open up!
BOBBY: Mr. Plenkov, open up.
DR. BLAKE: Abel, open the door!
BOBBY: Plenkov! Open up!
PATERSON: Kick it in, Bobby.
DR. BLAKE: Get up those stairs now!
PATERSON: Which room?
On the right?
Mr. Plenkov! Mr. Plenkov!
Freeze!
Shit!
Bobby, check him!
Check him!
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Come here.
What's your name?
BOBBY: No pulse, Frank.
What's your name, huh?
BOBBY: I'll check the woman.
No, no, no, no, look at me.
You're okay, all right?
You're okay.
Get away from me.
Bobby.
Yeah?
Get her downstairs.
BOBBY:
Hey, sweetheart, here we go.
I got you.
You're going to be fine.
PATERSON: Get in here.
Cover us.
PATERSON: He's dead.
So is Elvis.
You never know.
You have an epi?
We got it.
JEANNE:
The mother is dead, too.
Way dead.
You missed the kid, you fuck.
I'll get them all next time.
Son of a bitch!
GUS: Epinephrine kicks ass!
Hey! Hey!
JEANNE: Let's get the gurney, Gus.
Abel, I'll get you to a hospital. Abel?
You piece of shit.
He's not a monster.
What do you call him, then?
I call him mentally ill.
(AS ABEL) Thank you for stopping me.
Abel.
Forgive me.
He's talking to you.
Please!
Would it hurt you to be human?
Just once?
We'll let
God sort it out.
Thank you.
No, Abel!
Abel, talk to me.
Abel's not here.
This is for you, you cunt!
That's for shut the fuck up.
How's Mrs. King doing?
Baby is two months premature.
Dr. Carrie says he's blind, too.
Seven births in one hour, all premature.
What's going on here?
Anarchy!
MAY: What else you got?
We got a cop, Frank Paterson, who took two in the vest.
And?
And we got a perp.
Go on.
Mid-30s, white male, under constraint and critical.
Took multiple gunshots and stab wounds.
EEG flat.
Oh, and are you ready for this?
We think he's the Ripper.
What?
Family guy.
Killed the wife, tried to kill his kid.
You got a name?
Plenkov. Abel Plenkov.
GUS: May, you copy?
May?
He said he'd get them all next time.
What do you think he meant?
Maybe he was talking about his other personalities.
My family is from Haiti.
And down there they don't say that someone like him has multiple personalities.
What do they say he has?
Multiple souls.
What's the difference?
Personalities die when the patient dies.
Souls live on.
It's all just superstition,
I suppose.
Could you hand me my jacket, please?
It's cold as hell in here.
Thanks. ls this your evidence bag?
Get that fucker under control!
Shit!
Frank!
I can't believe you fucking guys!
You're supposed to be watching him!
You all right?
You good?
Fuck you!
You're all right.
GUS: Let me see.
Get out of my way.
Where the hell is Plenkov?
GUS: Let me see!
PATERSON: Shit. Fix that!
PATERSON: Call for backup!
I got Plenkov!
PATERSON: Fuck!
CROWD: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
BRANDON: The lights out!
BRANDON: Midnight!
All right! This is it!
Let the day begin!
As you all know,
Ripper Day marks two things.
One of them bad, one of them good.
The good part is, it's the birthday of seven of us here born 16 years ago tonight.
Jerome King.
Hey, Jerome.
Alex Dunkelman.
Jay Chan, with a new
Ripper puppet tonight.
Bug Hellerman...
Hellerman?
ALEX: It's about time!
BRANDON:
Better late than never,
I suppose.
Where you been?
Sleeping.
It's okay, Bug takes a little longer because he's a little slower, I guess.
Moving on to
Penelope Bryte over there, by the ambulance, who, incidentally, knows God.
They speak daily.
And to the beautiful and gorgeous
Brittany Cunningham.
And last, but, of course, not least...
ALL: Brandon O'Neil!
Yes, sir!
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Pleasure.
Now, it's time for the bad part, people.
We of the Riverton Seven have had to share our birthday with a monster, the serial killer
Abel Plenkov, who died at midnight the day we were born.
It's the Ripper.
CROWD: Ooh.
Legend has it that we, the Riverton Seven, are the mirrors of Abel Plenkov's personalities.
The ones that turned the Ripper in.
And that the Ripper still wants revenge.
So Abel Plenkov is dead, but his ghost isn't.
No, it lurks underneath the old railroad bridge.
You've seen it.
It sleeps in the river.
It roams the darkest corners of the woods just waiting for the next Ripper Day to come around.
Because, on that day, our birthday, tonight, the devil has told him that he can take his revenge.
But he can only come out of the river at this spot.
And every year, since we have been able, one of us Riverton Seven has volunteered to drive him back into the river where he belongs.
And tonight is no exception.
And I, personally, have chosen to volunteer...
GIRL 1 : Brandon?
GIRL 2: No!
...to volunteer
Bug Hellerman, that is.
BRANDON: It's your turn, Bug.
All the rest of us have done it.
We will now summon the Ripper from the river.
If he appears yet again, then Bug must slay him, or we'll all die.
Can you do it, Bug?
Save us!
Let's call him up!
If you can hear me, Ripper, make yourself known!
ALL: Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
BRANDON: Fear ye, Ripper!
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
Shut up!
JEROME: What did I do?
ALEX: Bug is freaking out.
BRANDON: Fear ye the Ripper!
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
GIRL 1 :
Oh, my God.
What is that?
JEROME: It's coming from the woods.
BRANDON: Whoa! Nice, Jay.
JAY: Damn right.
Come on, Bug, it's just a puppet.
Knock it over.
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
JEROME: Come on, you can take him, Bug!
Get in there, you pussy!
Look at how scared he is!
ALEX: Push him over.
BRANDON: Down on your knees, Bug!
JEROME: Slay that beastie, Bug.
BRANDON: Damn, that is a big mother.
JEROME: Bug, come on!
BRANDON: Get him!
What are you doing?
I can't do this!
BRANDON:
But you must, or we'll die!
ALEX: Come on, Bug.
Just knock him down!
That's all you have to do.
This is the police.
Disperse immediately!
Cops!
POLICEMAN: You're in violation of the Riverton midnight curfew!
Return to your homes immediately or your parents will face prosecution.
Bug, run!
BRANDON: Police brutality!
POLICEMAN: You want brutality?
I'll show you brutality!
BRANDON: God damn it!
ALEX: Watch the tree, Jerome.
ALEX: Sorry, Bug, sorry.
You're good?
He's still alive. It's okay.
Grab my hand.
I'm blind, Bug.
Not you.
You good?
Who's this?
JEROME: It's not cool.
ALEX: Why the hell are there cops here?
JAY: Jerome, big log. Big log.
Get down.
What the fuck was that?
Why did they stop us?
POLICEMAN: Go home!
Ripper Day has been officially canceled.
JAY: Just better sit and wait.
Why so glum, chum?
I failed.
Because you couldn't kill him?
Now we're all going to die, and it's my fault.
No!
That's bullshit
Brandon made up.
If he was so worried about it, he should have killed it himself.
That puppet was scary.
Thanks.
And the coat was creepy.
You added some moss and grass and shit, right?
Yeah, man, he lived under the river for like 16 years.
He's primeval, baby!
If he rode in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, how did he get the coat and everything? ln my version, the day after Plenkov supposedly drowned his house was burglarized, right?
And he took the boots, the coat, his whole outfit.
Why would a burglar just take clothes?
A burglar wouldn't, Bug.
But Plenkov would, if he was still alive!
Exactly!
The Ripper's alive?
ALEX: Could be.
I thought you said he was just a ghost.
No, he's dead.
No. Not necessarily.
They never found his body.
And nobody really knew him or his wife very well.
They were new to Riverton.
Yeah.
And, Plenkov could look completely different after 16 years!
Like, cosmetic surgery, hair transplants,
Weight Watchers.
And he could have changed his name.
Snuck back into Riverton to get his revenge this year.
He could be
Principal Pratt!
Shut the fuck up!
I got to get home, guys.
Wait, are you guys set for tomorrow?
For what?
JAY: The buzzard thing or whatever.
Condor.
Yeah, we made a sock puppet.
A sock puppet?
You'll put your class to sleep!
A good show-and-tell needs shock-and-awe!
It's my fault.
I was too scared about tonight to think about it.
Listen, Bug.
I'm scared of the Ripper, too.
You are?
I got to cross that bridge twice a day.
I do what my grandma taught me.
Spit in the river, and he won't come after me.
That works?
Yeah, for 16 years.
See you, guys!
See you.
I got to go.
We should go, too.
Quint is going to kill me if he catches me out this late.
BOBBY: I don't know about this new curfew.
We should've let them kill him first.
PATERSON: Kill who?
Plenkov.
The Ripper.
Very creative.
That's why every kid in Riverton has Ripper nightmares and the adults have memorial services.
It's time to move on!
Leave the past behind.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
PATERSON: I'm glad they're getting rid of it.
Rid of what?
That damn ambulance.
Pratt, the new principal at the high school convinced the chamber of commerce it was bad for tourism.
What?
No, no, no! It's a memorial.
That's why it's still here.
Tourism, Bob.
Tourism is where everything is going.
''Let's go to Riverton, honey,
''where that crazy fucker killed seven people and his wife.''
Not.
JAY: What the hell?
Fear ye the Ripper!
I spit in the river!
I spit in the river!
Bug!
Alex!
No! Please, no!
What just happened?
QUlNT: You better be in bed.
I'll kick your punk ass if you ain't!
If you fuck with me, you'll be sorry!
Shithead!
Fear ye the Ripper.
DR. COOPER ON RADIO:
The California Condors are magnificent birds.
They can fly 15,000 feet high, cruise at 55 miles per hour and cover 150 miles in a single day.
And they're so big, they're often mistaken for small airplanes on radar.
I mean... I mean, they're huge.
FEMALE RADIO HOST:
That's amazing.
You're listening to The Birding Hour, and the guest tonight is Dr. Richard Cooper, national expert on the California Condor and author of the bestselling book,
Keeper of the Souls.
Please, Dr. Cooper, this is fascinating.
Tell us some more.
DR. COOPER:
They've been pulled back from the brink of extinction a bit.
They're hanging in there.
The California Condor has always captured the imagination.
A Native American medicine man once said,
''It's true that the condor literally eats death.
''But the great bird is not sickened by this.
''No, it has a secret.
''It keeps the souls of all the fallen creatures it consumes.
''And they are its treasure and its protection.
''And with each soul it takes in and shelters it grows larger and wiser.
''Too large and wise to ever succumb to death itself. ''
RADIO HOST: Well, we all know that the California Condor was near extinction.
It's so nice to hear that they have a fighting chance now.
DR. COOPER: Oh, they are surviving with the help of some terrific people.
And they have some very interesting ways of defending themselves, too.
RADIO HOST: Really?
Could you share some of those?
DR. COOPER: Not on the radio.
PENELOPE: And please watch over the missionaries, our soldiers in foreign lands, the President, Mom and Dad, and especially the seven of us, this day. ls this the year?
It feels like it.
I know you can't tell me, but please keep Bug safe. ln Jesus' name, amen.
PENELOPE'S MOM:
Penelope! It's getting late.
I'm coming!
It's getting late.
Thank you.
Message received.
Crows, 10.
Snot-nosed kids, zip.
Hey!
Ass-wipe!
Get your little butt to school before I put my boot up it!
Let's go! Now!
Can you step back a little bit, Quint?
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
Of course I trust you.
Don't trust anyone, you dumb shit.
Thanks, Quint.
Felt good.
Anytime!
I know you want me,
Brittany.
Speaking.
I've got today's assignment, Brandon.
Got paper and pen?
Of course I do.
Bug Hellerman, three.
Bug?
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
I need it done this morning.
Alex gets an eight?
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just that it's pretty high on Fang's punitive scale.
Usually, giving an eight to the son of a felon comes with a bonus, is all.
Don't say something stupid, Brandon.
Nothing big.
A blowjob would do.
How about I have my dog bite it off and bury it in my backyard?
How big is your backyard?
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Good morning, Riverton.
It's hour 7 of Ripper Day 16.
And we're talking with Betty O'Neil, mother of Riverton star quarterback,
Brandon O'Neil and head of the group,
Citizens for a Saner Riverton.
Mrs. O'Neil, why ban Ripper Day?
It's just kids having fun, isn't it?
BETTY: No, it's not kids having fun.
It's kids having nightmares, seeing the Ripper everywhere. Kids...
Jumpy this morning, aren't we?
Where is the sock puppet?
Where did you come from?
Your window, where else?
WOMAN ON RADIO: ls Brandon damaged, do you think?
BETTY:
Of course Brandon isn't...
What the fuck is that?
Sock puppet.
On steroids?
Kind of.
Kind of?
Only you wear it this time.
What? Excuse me?
BUG: Like Jay said,
''Shock and awe.''
Thought Edgar was a home crow.
Raven.
He's a guard.
He watches over you, you know?
You're still spooked by last night, right?
We were all watching the river and he came from the woods.
That's scary.
Now, that's Jay's whole thing.
Never do what they expect.
And now we got Edgar up there to keep him away. So...
You can have him if you want, after tonight.
Edgar.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's your birthday.
Well, thanks.
I should get you a present.
How about a weekend in Las Vegas with
Brittany Cunningham?
Brittany doesn't know I'm alive.
She's gonna, after two days and two nights of star-studded shows and high-stakes gambling.
Oh, yeah.
Or I could just help you with that.
Yeah, that's just as good.
It's heavy.
It's all the fluids.
Fluids?
PENELOPE:
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me through all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
I know you're there, Lord.
And I know you're here.
BUG: Hello?
MAY: You like it?
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks, Mom.
I scotch-taped your number to it.
And mine, and 9-1-1.
Happy birthday, Bug.
I love you.
Love you, too.
How do...
Do I close it?
Hit the red button.
Boom, done.
Small!
That bad?
No, that's good.
CHANDELLE: Jerome.
Uh-oh.
Get, Dunkelman.
ALEX: Catch you later, Jerome.
What did I do now?
See you, Jerome.
It's what you're not going to do, which is hang out with them.
Why not?
It's bad luck, is ''why not.''
Especially on Ripper Day.
You should totally come some year, Fang.
It was wild!
Like, Brandon set Bug up to fight the monster, which was huge, by the way.
And Bug, he was so scared.
Brandon didn't set
Bug up. I did.
Do you know how to steam open an envelope so it doesn't show?
Put it in the freezer for an hour.
It opens itself and reseals perfectly.
This is to Bug.
Oh, really?
Here they come.
Hold up, boys.
What do you got there?
Happy birthday, insect.
Clueless as usual.
Go.
Mr. Kaiser, sixth period biology.
It'll be there.
Thanks, Jose.
So, you want to come over tonight?
We could burn the house down with my stepfather in it.
Ha, ha, ha!
He give you anything for your birthday?
Yeah, a hematoma.
Made it himself, too.
Oh!
Behold, Bug, what light in yonder window breaks.
She is so beautiful.
She's hot for you, too.
You should go over there and talk to her.
Excuse me,
Officer Ramirez.
Maria told me you know all about baseball.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.
RAMlREZ: What do you want to know?
Distraction maneuver.
Run!
Bug. This is a three.
Dunkelman, this is an eight.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
Dunkelman, stay away from the Fang Zone.
And you, you stay away from him.
ALEX: Thanks, Brandon.
Felt good.
BRANDON: Ass-wipe.
Not as good as your mother felt last night, though.
Just bought yourself a 20.
Brandon O'Neil.
Do not bring the wrath of Jehovah down upon you.
Your sins are already a stench in the nostrils of an angry God.
Like knocking up
Melanie Pratt, who's only 15 and the principal's daughter.
What? Melanie's pregnant?
She's in my prayer group. Duh!
What men will do to you in prison is nothing compared to what demons will do to you in Hell.
On beds of fire.
Through all eternity.
I'm going to get you for this, Penelope.
If you do, God will get you, Brandon, and it won't be pretty.
When you least expect it, Dunkelman.
Hi, Bug!
Hi.
Happy birthday!
Thanks, Penelope.
Same to you.
Did you get my note?
Note?
I left it in your mailbox.
No.
It doesn't matter.
What?
Pray for our souls, Bug.
He's coming.
Jesus?
We should be so lucky.
Don't forget me.
Rise up and gird your loins, Alex.
The end is near.
Why is Penelope always saying weird stuff like that?
Parallel universe, baby.
I don't understand her, sometimes.
I mean, the way she said that.
Pray for our souls, Bug.
He's coming.
What if she meant the Ripper?
I'm scared.
We're 16, Bug.
Like it or not, we're men now.
I don't feel like a man.
No man does.
That's why you got to fake it.
Fake being a man to be a man?
That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.
You have to face your fear like a man.
Even though I'm not a man?
Because you're not a man.
Listen, the better you fake it, the better man you are.
Just fake it?
Well, fake it good.
Like, if you're scared, act like you don't give a shit.
Or if somebody hurts you, say, ''Thank you very much.
That felt wonderful.''
Thanks, Brandon.
I can't raise my arm.
Feels good.
Yeah, there you go.
That all you got, Brandon?
I mean, I feel downright cheated.
I'm amazed that you're getting this so quick.
It's tricky stuff.
I was faking that I did.
You were?
Completely.
Yeah, but you were faking it good.
I was?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
You now have permission to shave.
MR. KAISER:
As you know, class, we're nearing the end of our reports on living creatures.
Dogs, fish, honeybees.
We had an especially nice one from Brittany
Cunningham last session on the butterflies of our state.
Today's presentation will be by Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
Are you boys ready?
Boys?
ALEX: Bug, come on.
MR. KAISER:
While we're young.
Get up!
I believe this is yours.
''Back from the Brink.''
By Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
Dumbfuckelman.
Brandon.
Our subject today is about a bird.
You having another one of your migraines, Adam?
Shock and awe!
Adam!
Our subject today is the largest bird in North America.
Unchanged since the Pleistocene Epoch and only recently rescued from extinction.
I present to you
Gymnogyps californianus.
Anus.
MR. KAISER:
Brandon, second warning.
The California Condor.
Good Lord.
BUG: Are you ready?
Fly, now!
His wingspan is 10 feet wide.
His body, more than four feet high.
He can weigh as much as 350 parrots.
As for soaring, he can glide effortlessly for days until he finds his food, which is carrion.
A dead, stinking body crawling with maggots is ice-cream to him.
MR. KAISER: Bug.
Just showmanship, Mr. Kaiser.
The facts are correct.
A California Condor can consume the carcass of a cow in one day.
Bullshit.
BUG: And if anyone tries to harm it, if anyone even so much as touches one of its feathers, just one...
What are you going to do?
Going to bite me, asshole?
Uh-uh.
The bird will vomit copiously on its tormentor.
And if that doesn't work, the great bird has another defense, too.
Bottle two, Alex!
BRANDON:
What the hell is that?
And that is why no one should ever screw with the California Condor.
Thank you, Brandon.
That felt so good.
Alex and I would like to thank you all for your kind attention.
Hall pass. Go!
GIRL: That was so wrong!
Didn't mean to scare you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Bug, that was amazing.
Oh, my God, that suit was genius.
I felt like Mothra.
How'd you come up with that?
I don't know.
Have a good puke?
Couldn't.
Try the finger thing?
Nothing.
Bummer.
We should get out of here.
Brandon's really mad now, I guess.
You don't know the half of it.
Brandon is way past mad.
He's been humiliated twice in two hours in front of Brittany.
He's approaching nuclear.
But he's not the one we got to worry about.
He's not?
No, it's Fang.
Brandon only does what she tells him to do.
The fish stinks from the head.
Why would Fang want to hurt us?
You? I don't know.
Me, I got caught outside the girls' bathroom between 2:00 and 2:30.
That's when Fang and her crew talk business.
Anybody caught in the Fang Zone during that half hour is treated like a spy.
Just because you were out there doesn't mean you were spying.
I was spying.
There's a revolution going on here.
Fang must fall!
Fang, fall?
Like the mob.
We need to get something on her so incriminating that she has to leave us common folk alone.
If only we had some sort of listening device.
Hello?
Condor? Crow.
Fang and her crew arrive in the bathroom in three minutes.
Everyone else clears out five before.
That means we have a window of two minutes, starting now.
Window?
To get your phone in there. ln the girls' bathroom?
I'm sure Brittany is going to be there, as well, talking about you.
We could gather that kind of intelligence, also.
Talking about me?
Yeah, yeah.
You amazed her back there in biology, Bug.
She saw a new man standing there, fascinated, powerful, daring.
Get your phone in there.
You're going to hear it with your own ears.
But now, you only got a minute, 45.
What if there's somebody in there?
No, no.
I got that covered.
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.
Wrong bathroom, Jerome!
Yours is down the hall, around the corner.
Did I scare anyone else?
No one else is in there, but it's a Fang Zone in 30 seconds.
GIRL 1 : Let's go!
Come on, hurry up.
GIRL 2: I am!
Clear.
Can you hear me?
Ten seconds!
Go!
Come on, come on, come on.
Brittany, window,
Chandelle, door,
Maria, you've got five.
Go.
The sophomores have paid another year's protection for their bikes.
And the answers to next week's organic chemistry test are selling briskly.
Bottom line,
$2,000 in the bank.
We got her. (CHUCKLlNG)
Good numbers.
Speaking of numbers, apparently this morning there was a problem with Brandon giving the punitives?
A three and an eight,
I believe.
The numbers were administered properly and on schedule, however, before Brandon could leave the area,
Penelope Bryte came out of nowhere and told him he was going to hell.
Brandon would enjoy hell.
Kick some ass, take names.
There something you're not telling me?
Well,
Maria's dad was there.
I thought I told you to distract him with the baseball stuff.
I did, but Penelope's yelling got your father looking straight at us.
Maybe Penelope needs a 10.
A 10?
A 10?
What's her story, anyway?
She's obsessed with Bug.
Girls find him attractive.
Do you?
What?
Find Bug attractive.
No, of course not.
Sorry.
He's a lunatic, Brittany.
A brain-bomb waiting to go off.
His only real friend is Dunkelman, and Dunkelman just uses him as his monkey.
He's been in and out institutions half his life.
Bug has killed people.
Killed people?
Monkey?
Wake up and smell the Starbucks.
You're right.
He's pathetic.
Brandon's the one for you, Brit.
He's a diamond. ln the rough,
I'll admit but a diamond just the same.
By comparison,
Bug is a lump of coal.
Trust me on this.
Okay?
Okay, Fang.
Good girl.
Bug, don't run away.
Stop it.
Bug, say, ''Thanks, Fang, that felt great.''
I'd be lying.
That's the point.
Thanks, Fang.
That felt great.
That felt fucking great.
That's a bad word.
Be bad.
It makes things good.
Everything's backwards with you.
Just fake you're bad.
Thanks, Fang.
That felt fucking great.
That felt fucking great.
Good.
But you do have to do one more thing.
I can't handle another fucking thing, okay?
You've got to get your phone back.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not fucking kidding you.
They're going to find it, they're going to trace it they're going to call your mom.
She's going to have to come in and get humiliated by Principal Pratt.
No fucking way!
Way. And enough with the ''fucks'' now.
You say ''fuck.''
You're not me, okay?
You're not me, okay?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Bug?
Bug?
Bug.
Bug.
BOTH: Boo!
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
Bug. Bug!
Bug. Bug!
Bug!
Bug!
What just happened?
Nothing.
Do you think
I'm a monkey, Alex?
Have you killed people, Bug?
Not that I can remember.
Well, I can't remember buying you bananas either.
I'll be right back.
ALEX: Keep it down in there.
Bug? Where are you?
What's taking you so long?
Bug?
Bug, someone's coming.
BRITTANY: Alex, what are you doing here?
ALEX: Hi, Brittany. Brittany, why are you going back into the bathroom?
BRITTANY: I forgot my purse.
None of your business.
ALEX: lncoming!
BRITTANY: Hello?
Please say this is a nightmare.
Please say this is a nightmare.
Anyone in there?
Hello? Who locked this?
He probably just fell in.
Accidents happen.
If Jeanne-Baptiste is down there, we're not talking accident.
I could fucking feel it coming.
Yeah.
You couldn't feel shit.
PATERSON: No, I could.
Give me a minute, all right?
JEANNE: Hey, Frank.
Hey.
He's been dead at least 1 2 hours.
What the hell hit him, Jeanne?
Two miles of this, for starters.
Any knife wounds?
Nothing obvious.
Could take an autopsy to know for sure.
Come on.
JEANNE: What? You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
PATERSON: What are you thinking?
Probably there was alcohol last night.
Might have gotten tipsy on his way home.
Kid's in my 1 2-step.
JEANNE: Sorry.
Well, we'll know quick enough.
The autopsy will tell us if there's any alcohol levels in the blood or any water in the lungs.
And I'll check for a knife wound. I will.
Sixteenth anniversary.
One and six is seven.
We didn't let them kill him last night, first time.
And it was Bug's turn.
It's kind of funny.
I get scientific in 16 years and you go voodoo on me.
What did your grandmother say?
What?
Did she tell you not to worry if somebody you thought was dead just might come back alive?
If he was evil enough?
Call me when you know something, yeah?
Okay.
Connecticut Condor?
Turkey Vulture.
You find Jay?
No, weird.
He always answers.
I saw him.
Where? ln the boys' bathroom mirror.
He was in the river, I think.
He tried to say something, but...
Bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
It wasn't a nightmare.
Whatever it was.
Look, all seven of us are on edge today.
Seeing the Ripper in all sorts of weird places.
It's like Brandon said, the way the cookie crumbles.
For us.
Just for today.
You're a condor.
You eat death for breakfast, remember that.
Where you going?
Call me after Pratt.
Pervert.
I'm sorry I screamed.
I don't blame you.
You should get out more, Bug.
Shop. It's what I do when I'm scared.
You're scared?
Angry, is what
I meant to say.
GIRL 1 : Stay safe.
GIRL 2: Don't let the
Ripper get you.
Payback time!
Think twice, jockstrap!
You know what Fang would do if she knew you were moonlighting.
Yeah, well, nobody's looking.
But somebody's listening, Sasquatch.
Think about it.
I tell Chandelle, she tells Fang.
We all know how Fang doesn't like you off your little leash.
She'll mark you.
Put you in the river with concrete flippers.
That's actually just peachy, you know.
I'll let Ripper get you two.
You know, Bug, a lot of people have seen him already today.
It's not even dark.
Must be scary living in a house with no father to protect you.
You know, I bet if you look up ''rectum'' in the dictionary they would have a picture of Brandon there.
You don't know fear, Bug.
You puked on Brandon O'Neil.
You're a hero of the revolution.
Hey, Penelope.
Hey, Jerome.
What was it this time?
You're wearing those squeaky shoes again.
You can really hear that?
Got to go. See you.
See you.
Hey.
Hey.
So, I heard you're seeing Principal Pratt? ln 15 minutes.
They called my mom at work.
I'm doomed.
We're all doomed, Bug.
It's the human condition.
The next life's the thing to focus on.
It's Melanie Pratt.
She wants me to pray with her.
You want to come?
I'll be with Father Pratt.
Right. Well,
God hears you, wherever you are.
If things get too hot, just turn on the prayer-conditioning.
(AS ALEX) Bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
(AS JAY) I've got to cross that bridge twice a day.
(AS BRITTANY) Shop. That's what I do when I'm scared.
(AS JEROME) You don't know what fear is, Bug.
You puked in
Brandon O'Neil's face.
I mean, you're a hero of the revolution.
Must be pretty scary sleeping in a house no father to protect you.
PENELOPE: Cops!
(AS PENELOPE) If things get too hot, just turn up the prayer-conditioning.
Fear ye the Ripper!
PENELOPE: Lord, this is a sin not of hate but of love.
So please remember, you put the apple and the happy little snake together in one small garden, so, you know things can happen now and then.
And just wrap your arms around Melanie and let her know that, no matter what, you're there for her and love her to pieces.
Amen.
Thanks, Penelope.
Now you.
I'm so ashamed.
Don't be.
It's a baby, not a bomb.
Lord, it might as well be a bomb.
I mean, I feel so guilty.
But you know how Brandon is.
''Please, please, pretty please.''
But I still should have said no.
He said it would make me feel special.
It hasn't.
It's made me feel fat and stupid.
My father will be the laughingstock.
My mother will probably die.
My little sister Amy, she'll join a cult or something.
Who is that?
Melanie!
Melanie, run!
Melanie?
RIPPER: Die now.
If I should die before I wake...
PRATT: Adam?
...I pray the Lord our souls to take.
Adam?
Adam, Principal Pratt asked you a question.
The end is near.
Did you know your daughter's pregnant?
What?
She's in my prayer group. Duh.
Bug!
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself, Mom.
Mr. Pratt, what was the question?
It's not important.
You can go now, Adam.
And take your creature with you.
Your mom and I are going to chat for a while.
We'll speak at home, Bug.
Straight home.
All right.
I'm so sorry.
I don't think he got much sleep last night.
Yes, Ripper Night.
It's an outrage that it's lasted this long.
And for a sensitive child like Adam, it can be especially dangerous.
I was checking Adam's file and it's remarkable, not so much for what's in it, but for what's not.
Pardon?
I've been a principal here for six months and I can find no medical files for him, except his vaccination records, of course, which are the one thing he absolutely must have in order to attend school here.
Bug has no medical issues, really.
If he did, we'd have no way of knowing, would we?
I'm his mother, I would.
Well, that's right.
You're a nurse at Riverton Community.
Head Nurse, OBlGYN.
Uh-huh.
Are Adam's records there?
Adam has never been hospitalized.
Has Adam ever been tested?
Neurologically, I mean.
Neurologically?
Why would he be?
Well, since I've been principal here, he's awakened twice in study hall screaming.
He's got chronic migraines.
He's claustrophobic.
Claustrophobic?
Last year,
I was told, a friend put him in an empty locker just for fun and he was so hysterical he had to be sent home.
Brandon O'Neil is no friend.
He's a bully who never gets more than slap on the wrist.
I'm talking about Adam here, Ms. Hellerman.
He has serious issues.
And today he terrorized a classroom with this monstrous bird that he built.
It vomited on them.
And worse, he's obsessed with this California buzzard.
Not a hummingbird, not a robin, not an American eagle, but a bird that eats dead things.
California Condor.
Whatever.
It eats dead things.
Native Americans considered it sacred.
It cleans the earth to make room for new life.
Maybe they understood something we don't.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Tomorrow,
I am sending Adam for psychological testing to a state facility in Boston.
You what?
For Adam's safety and the safety of the normal students in this school.
It is my responsibility, and it is my legal right to do so.
(AS FANG) Brandon's the one for you, Brit.
He's a diamond.
A diamond in the rough,
I admit, but a diamond just the same.
Compared to him,
Bug's a lump of coal.
BRITTANY: I know.
Church in two hours.
I'll be there.
I'll be home in two shakes. Bye.
Hey, Brittany!
Training for the marathon, Brandon?
Yeah. You know,
I got to keep in shape.
You're in great shape.
You got time for that oral?
You're like a crotch dog.
You know, the kind that stick their nose in your crotch when you're not looking?
It's like a handshake, really.
My father had a crotch dog.
Mom had it put out of its misery.
Misery is what
I'm talking about.
Come on, Brittany,
I went the extra mile for you today.
I could've gotten expelled for that eight.
Plus, I got shit on twice.
Once by a Jesus freak, once by a fucking buzzard.
Condor.
BRANDON: It's just got me tense.
BRITTANY: Start a hobby.
This is my hobby.
Besides, it's my birthday.
It's all of our birthdays.
I know, but I need it.
And I want it.
It should make you feel special.
Come on. Fang thinks we're a good match.
Fang doesn't run my private life.
Does she know that?
Because I could bring her up to speed.
You threatening me?
I'm begging you. ln the woods.
You hate the woods.
It's spring.
I'm feeling romantic.
Count to 60.
You tricking me?
I got a temper.
You're not the only one.
BRANDON: Sixty seconds.
Fifty.
Forty-two.
Thirty.
Fifteen.
Three.
Hey, Brittany!
Hey, you fucking bitch!
Hey!
Hey! Wait!
BRANDON: Hey, Brittany!
Where did you go?
Brittany!
Brittany!
Penelope?
Penelope.
Now you're going to get it.
Hello?
BRITTANY: Just because she embarrassed you in front of me, you killed her?
You are going to burn in hell.
What?
Better start running the other way, Brandon.
I've called the police.
What? No, no.
Brittany, Brittany.
Don't! Don't!
Brittany, Brittany, Brittany!
Please don't get me arrested, all right?
I knocked up
Principal Pratt's daughter.
He'll have me murdered in my cell.
Hey, do you understand what I'm saying?
Brittany, look,
I know you're there.
I can hear you walking. Just...
I understand that you don't want to talk.
I probably disgust you.
It's okay,
I disgust myself, sometimes.
I know I'm a pig.
I can't help it.
No! Pigs are nicer.
Actually, I'm just what you said.
I'm a fucking crotch dog.
I'm sorry.
RIPPER: It's too late to be sorry.
Who is this?
Someone from your past.
You wouldn't remember.
Put Brittany on, please.
She's not here.
Well, where is she?
Where you're going to go.
I'm going to go to the church.
No, you're not.
What do you mean,
''No, I'm not?''
Think hotter.
Miami?
RIPPER: Try hell!
Anybody you want to say goodbye to?
My unborn child.
Fuck your fucking unborn child.
Now, where did
I leave your bitch?
What?
Whose phone?
Oh, my God.
OPERATOR:
This is Riverton 9-1-1.
Please hold.
All our circuits are busy.
We will get to your call as soon as we can.
Be home, Bug Hellerman.
MAY: Okay, 10:00 a.m.,
Boston Psychiatric Clinic.
I got to go.
BUG: Oh.
Wow!
I'm sorry I'm so late.
You should be.
Have a seat.
You're too big to spank.
Okay.
Sweater.
Did you fall?
I was burying a friend.
My condor.
Brandon ruined it.
I gave it a decent burial.
You gave me a start.
Why, you think
I killed somebody?
No, of course not.
Make a wish.
Do you want to know what I wished for?
No.
I wished that
I could take back what I did today and make you proud of me instead.
I was trying to get my phone back, the one you gave me, and unfortunately,
I fell into the toilet.
My phone fell into Brittany
Cunningham's bag and I didn't have a chance to get it out.
What was your phone doing in the girls' bathroom in the first place?
We were trying to gather some information about something.
Don't tell me.
You and Alex?
I wanted to know what
Brittany thought of me.
Brittany Cunningham?
She's a little sophisticated for you, isn't she?
I like her.
So did you find out what she thinks of you?
She thinks he's a retard like everyone else.
Do not use that word in this house!
It's okay.
Just because Leah says mean things, doesn't make them so.
What if they are so?
What?
They are.
Watch your nuts, little squirrel.
Leah told Brittany that I had been in institutions.
That I had killed people.
Have I?
Leah will say anything.
You don't have the most supportive sister in the world.
Who are you calling?
Your phone.
Mom! Come on, Mom.
No, please.
Hey.
Hey.
Penelope Bryte.
Done with a knife, just like the others.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, Frank!
Keeps going to voicemail.
She's with Brandon.
How did you know that?
I just do.
Time for presents.
Well, this is a first.
I don't give gifts just to give them, May.
Gifts should mean something.
Happy sweet 16th.
What is it?
Open it.
I don't understand.
Bug!
Huh?
Go to your room, now!
What did I do?
Just go!
What?
No, leave that thing here.
Leah gave it to me, so I guess it's mine.
How could you?
Somebody's got to bust his cherry.
I'm sorry to hit you.
But you deserve it.
Your friends are calling, May.
They want you at the church so you can all lie to each other again.
You know?
How God works in mysterious ways and how everything works out for the good if you just keep repeating the lies.
Like, ''The Ripper's dead, he's not coming back.''
Would it kill you to look at things positively just once, Leah?
You're scared of being human.
You get your friends to do your dirty work.
You're still in high school at 19 because you're too chicken-shit to get on with your life.
You hide behind what should be dead and buried.
Like you hide behind me and Bug?
And my mother?
No, I did what I did to save Bug from what you've become.
And because my sister had more heart and courage on any given day than you have had in your whole miserable life!
Fuck you, May.
Hi.
Fuck you, too!
Leah.
Thanks, Leah.
That felt good.
Why do you hate me?
I've never done anything to you.
You've ruined my life!
That's what you've done, you little shit!
Why?
Why?
I will tell you why, maggot.
From the moment you were born everything went to shit for me!
You were the miracle baby, and I was the painful reminder!
You got to live in this dream and I got stuck in a fucking nightmare!
I am sick to death of your innocence!
It is an insult to me!
Why am I innocent?
You are so clueless, it is stunning!
Tell me.
Do you know who your father was?
May said that he loved us very much.
But who was he?
I don't know.
He died in a car crash.
On the way to the hospital to be with May when she was having you, right?
Yeah.
What a sad, yet beautiful story.
Have you ever asked yourself why May doesn't ever talk about him?
Or why there isn't a single fucking picture of him around the house?
Maybe it's too painful.
Do you know who
Abel Plenkov was?
The Riverton Ripper?
Besides that?
No.
Take a look in the mirror, Bug.
ABEL: Remember how much
I loved you, Leah.
(AS RIPPER) Leah, unlock the door for Daddy.
(AS ABEL) Leah, don't!
Don't listen to him!
Get out of my way!
Now you're going to get it!
Leah!
Leah.
PATERSON: Freeze!
ABEL: (AS RIPPER) Open the door, you little bitch!
GUS: Get over here.
We got a live fetus.
ABEL: (AS RIPPER) Open the door for Daddy!
You did good, Mama.
We'll take good care of your boy.
BUG: Leah?
Go away.
Open the door, Leah.
Do you want to die?
Get out of my room!
Fuck!
There.
We're even.
Where did you get that?
There's a revolution going on, Fang.
Hi.
Hi.
FANG: Hello? ls Leah okay?
Leah's fine.
Are you? You look...
I know you're not my mother.
Bug, I'm so sorry.
I never meant...
I hope you know something, too.
What?
That you are my mom.
That one you're stuck with, like it or not.
MARlA: Fang, you still there?
Are you still there?
Are you okay?
Maria just called.
They found Jay Chan in the river this morning.
No!
Penelope Bryte near the old ambulance.
Brandon and Brittany in the woods nearby.
I was a total shit to her today, and she's dead.
MAY: How can that be?
FANG: You know how that can be, May.
Our father is still alive.
MAY: Let's wait to see what really happened.
What's really happening, May, he's killing his way through the Riverton Seven.
He'll get Jerome, and Dunkelman, and then he'll come for us.
No.
We'll go to the church and be with the others.
I'll go to church with you, May.
But this is the last time.
And I'm sorry, but I had to tell him.
I'll get the car and be out front.
Get Bug, okay?
Bug.
Leah?
Ready?
Fuck.
I figured you'd come.
Really? Have you heard?
I've heard.
I've heard a lot.
Oh?
The Riverton Ripper,
Abel Plenkov?
Yeah?
He was my father.
That I know.
You do?
The parents of all the seven know.
I think I'm the only kid.
My mother told me the day she died.
Why didn't anyone tell me?
Sorry, we thought you were too...
I don't know. lnnocent?
I guess.
Well, I'm not anymore.
Yeah. I can see that.
Who beat you up?
Fang.
Figures.
Penelope sent me a letter.
A love letter?
No.
She wrote to warn me that he'd be coming back for us.
My father.
She had a source.
Oh, yeah.
She say anything else?
She said that there are two ways that he can come from.
One, if he survived 16 years ago, then he'll come back as Abel Plenkov.
Dad.
Option two?
Option two is he did die and his soul went into one of the seven kids who were born the night he died.
Hopped the nearest bus. ln this version, he's one of us killing all the rest.
Attack from the unexpected direction.
Yeah.
There's not many of us left to be unexpected, though.
You, me and Jerome.
Jerome's not a very good candidate.
Mmm-mmm.
So, you or me.
That's option two.
(EXHALlNG) Well,
I like option one better.
Makes more sense.
The Ripper who was stabbed and shot had a little fender-bender, ended up in the river, no biggie.
He patched himself up with stuff from the ambulance.
Survives on acorns and crawfish for 16 years.
So he just crawled out of the river in a rotting overcoat to take his revenge.
I'll just call the cops and tell them to keep an eye out for the Unabomber's evil twin.
Or not.
What's that?
The biggest knife
I could find in the kitchen.
Bug...
What would you say if I told you I was going to kill you, Alex?
I'd say you weren't.
Why not?
Because you're my best friend.
You're Bug.
Now you ask me.
You don't think
I could kill somebody?
No.
You'd be wrong, Bug.
Dead wrong.
You killed Penelope and Jay?
And the others?
Of course not.
I killed my stepfather.
You killed Quint?
He was drunk.
He hit me.
For the first time in my life,
I hit him back.
Fell down the steps and broke his stupid neck.
Alex, it's okay, okay?
No, it's not okay!
What I did...
It's not okay for everybody to be killing each other all the time!
You don't want something to drink?
You got rat poison?
No, we just ran out of rat poison.
I'm going to go get you water.
What is this?
Alex, I'll be right...
Ripper?
Son of a bitch!
Drop the knife, Bug.
Now.
Kick it over to me.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Get your hands up.
Up.
Walk slow.
Why are you pointing that at me?
That is far enough.
Why?
Your phone was found next to Brittany
Cunningham's body.
It fell into her purse at school.
That was an accident.
You can ask my mom.
Your mom is why
I have to arrest you, Bug.
Mom!
Easy!
Stay there.
I was there when they cut you out of your mother, Bug.
You were the one thing that made the whole bloody mess bearable.
A fucking...
Miracle?
Yes!
Something bright in the dark.
And ever since, for all of us that were there, Bug, that's what you've been.
Fuck. How could you do this?
I didn't.
Hold out your hands, son.
Where's my sister?
Why don't you tell me?
RIPPER: It's time.
RIPPER: (SOFTLY) They never should've cut you out of your dead mother.
RIPPER: What happened to your wings, angel?
RIPPER: Fucking piece of shit!
Where is the knife?
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up.
RIPPER: Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Eww.
It's not as bad as it looks.
How did you get away?
I was already in the car.
I came inside just to see where May was, and I found her dead.
I knew that fucker would come for us.
Maybe he's gone.
No, no, no.
Let's go.
I think we should...
Die! Die! Die!
I saved you for last!
Fuck!
Leah, call the cops.
FANG: Son of a bitch!
Hey.
Leah, I need you to get the lights on.
Get out of the house, get to the neighbors and call the cops.
You think you can do that for me?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to give that fucker a 10.
Make it a 20.
BUG: Ripper?
Shit!
Jerome! Jerome, stop it! Jerome!
Hey, hey! Hey!
Hey.
Jerome.
Jerome.
The Ripper's up here, Bug.
Watch out.
It's okay, Jerome.
He's gone, all right?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the church.
Alex called me.
He said all three of us should be together.
Watch each other's backs.
I was halfway through the window when the Ripper stabbed me.
How did he get up here?
He must have come up the rope like I did.
I passed out on the roof, and then I came to and I heard fighting.
Was that you?
Him and me. Yeah, it was.
He was kicking my ass, too.
I tried calling the cops but I knocked over something, and then I heard him coming for me, so I ducked for the closet.
You saved my life, Jerome.
I did?
Yeah, he was going to kill me, and then you distracted him.
Good.
Dude, it's going to be okay.
Help is coming, all right?
You fought the Ripper, Bug.
You're a hero, like I told you.
I'm not a hero,
Jerome. I'm just...
Jerome?
Jerome?
What the fuck happened to you?
What happened to Jerome?
He's dead.
The Ripper got him.
A lot's happened since you've been gone, Alex.
Where did you disappear to?
I saw Paterson pulling up outside.
I ran. I hid in the woods.
Then I heard gunshots, so I came back.
I was afraid he shot you or something.
Where is he, anyway?
Downstairs. He's dead.
What?
What happened?
The Ripper happened.
He killed Mom, too.
May?
I can't believe this.
You went to get me a glass of water and now your mom, Paterson, and Jerome are dead?
Where were you?
I ran into Penelope.
Penelope is dead, Bug.
I saw her in the bathroom mirror.
She brought me Ripper's knife, and she made me take it.
Then I heard something downstairs and I went to come check on you, and you were gone.
Paterson wasn't after you.
He was after me.
He thought that I killed Brittany and my Mom.
It was the Ripper.
And where is the Ripper now?
I guess he got away out my window.
Or went out Leah's.
Hers is open, too.
And he tried to stab me to death with his...
Stab you with what?
With his knife.
I thought you had his knife.
I did, but...
Did you kill them, Bug?
What?
No, I...
I didn't kill anybody.
Not that you remember.
Bug, I got to tell you something.
And don't get upset.
What?
My mom told me this.
Your father was first diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.
Just like you are now.
What are you saying?
It's hereditary.
Plus, you were in your dead Mom forever.
Oxygen deprivation.
It can make you crazy, too.
Maybe all this stuff you've been describing didn't happen exactly the way you're saying it did.
You think I'm crazy?
No, I don't know what I think.
But I'm not walking away.
I've stuck by you through everything.
Through nightmares and migraines, hell, puking vultures when everybody else was calling you a ticking time bomb.
So, if you're not innocent anymore, that's okay.
I mean, I killed my stepfather tonight.
I'm no angel, either.
I'm not innocent anymore, Alex.
Not with all of them inside me now.
What?
With who inside you?
The rest of the
Riverton Seven.
Even Jerome.
All their souls are with me now.
Bug, maybe you should sit down and take a few deep breaths.
You think I'm crazy?
I'm actually a lot smarter than I was yesterday.
Let me ask you a question.
Why is there blood on your left ear?
What?
The top.
Hey!
Almost like you were hit with a vase or something.
Brandon told me to look for that.
Bug, you are officially bat-shit nuts.
I scraped it climbing up the roof.
Come on, let's get real, here.
BUG: Jay says that Ripper's getup was a costume for sure.
Oh, and Brittany has run a timeline.
You would've had enough time to kill Mom and put the knife in the bathroom sink while I was hiding under the bed and Leah was outside in the car.
And if Jerome came through the window when I was in the bathroom getting you water, you would've had time to stab him, and go downstairs and kill Paterson.
You might have tried to kill me, too.
Fuck.
BUG: But if you'd heard
Jerome upstairs, you would've had to get up there before he called the cops.
I could've killed you off earlier, remember?
Bug, you've watched one too many
Law and Order reruns.
Besides,
I'm a little guy.
You could beat me up in, like, 10 seconds.
Unless you had the bad soul in you.
And then you would fight like you were possessed.
Can't fucking believe you.
You're Adam Plenkov!
The son of a mass murderer!
Everybody in your house, and all your friends, except me, have been murdered.
If there's a bad soul here, you have it.
And you got it from your father.
Maybe you have been in institutions.
Maybe you have killed people, just in your last life.
But you're too stupid and blind to see that.
Maybe they'll find your Ripper costume buried along with your stupid condor outfit.
And they will come for you with torches.
What?
I didn't bury any Ripper costume with my condor.
Somebody did.
You son of a...
Evil doesn't forget betrayal, Plenkov.
You and the other sick Dr. Blake got me and then ran away like cowards.
Jumped into the first babies you could hide in.
So I saved you for last.
And I'll kill you now, or you can say yes to a deal.
What deal?
Same one
I offered your father,
16 years ago today.
Say yes, and you live.
Say no, and
I'll cut your throat.
Say yes to what?
To my happy ending of Riverton's fairytale.
There was no Ripper.
Just one of the
Riverton Seven that was a little crazy, dressed up like the Ripper, killed your mom, and Paterson, and four of his birth-mates before we finally stopped him.
One of the Riverton Seven?
The one of the seven with the bad soul.
The Ripper's soul.
BUG: Jerome?
Great twist, huh?
Everybody will think you were the killer but it turns out the attack came from a totally unexpected direction.
You'd lay all this on Jerome?
He won't mind.
He's dead.
You and me will be
Main-Street heroes helping each other forge a new beginning.
Recovering from our tragic losses.
Friends to the end.
What do you say?
Deal?
You're pathetic.
I don't even think you're Alex.
I don't know who you are.
I'm the one that's going to kill you if you don't say yes.
And then I'll say you did it.
And I'll be the hero all by myself.
Leah saw the whole fight.
She'll vouch for me.
Leah doesn't live through the night.
That's part of the deal, too.
Whoever or whatever you are, get out of Alex.
And go back to hell, where you came from.
I mean it.
Okay.
But I'll take you with me.
I thought that guy would never leave.
Alex.
Where is the biggest knife in the kitchen?
Where it needs to be.
Condor?
Crow.
It's all right, Bug.
Feels great.
Feels fucking great.
Fucking great.
Fly now.
I know you're up there.
And I know we're down here.
COP 1 : Police!
COP 2: Police!
Open the door!
Open up!
Open the door!
Open the door now!
BUG: I am the condor.
The Keeper of the Souls.
I eat death for breakfast.
I live in a house of blood and I accept that.
COP 3: Break it down!
BUG: That's all a man can do.
I was ready to be arrested that night.
I wasn't ready for what happened instead.
Leah had told them everything, and I was celebrated as a hero.
Don't worry about it, man.
They're on your side.
BUG: Alex Dunkelman killed his stepfather, a cop, a mother and five of the
Riverton Seven.
Your sister's right over there.
BUG: And I alone had stopped him from killing more.
I didn't feel like a hero at all.
But if it makes Riverton feel safe at night,
I'll fake that I'm their hero.
And I'll fake it good.
Alex wouldn't have it any other way.

WATSON:
The year was 1891.
Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.
France and Germany were at each other's throats...
...the result of a series of bombings
Some said it was Nationalists...
mothers, the anarchists
But as usual...
...my friend Sherlock Holmes...
...had a different theory entirely.
MAN 1:
Bombing in Strasbourg! Read all about it!
MAN 2: Thank you.
MAN 1: Anarchists suspected...
...in Strasbourg bombing!
Bombing in Strasbourg!
When did you start working for the postal service?
That was you back there.
Shame your activities have landed you in the gutter.
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?
Why don't we discuss that over dinner tonight?
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm. I'm not.
How about the Savoy, 8:00?
- Splendid.
- Hmm.
And will you be coming as yourself?
Most likely.
Three men have been following you for the last half mile...
...their motives highly unsavory.
No.
Oh, and, by the way, they're not pursuing me, they're escorting me.
And instead of three, there seems to be, uh, four.
Heh.
Steady hands with that, Irene.
Oh, I don't think it's my hands you have to worry about.
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.
Don't fill up on bread.
(WHISTLING MOZART'S
"EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK")
(WHISTLING MOZART'S
"EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK")
I forgot the rest.
Oh, it's coming back now.
THUG:
Aah!
Aah!
Peelers!
AUCTIONEER:
We now come to Lot 34...
...Egyptian sarcophagus of outstanding provenance...
...retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.
Who will bid 100 pounds?
One hundred. Thank you, sir.
HOFFMANSTAHL: Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.
Uh... Stay...
...while I check the contents.
I was assured full payment would be there.
Yes, but assured by whom?
Have you ever met him in person?
Or like me, have you been...?
Hold it, hold it. Please, don't move it.
Judging from size and weight, it's not the payment you were expecting.
I'd wager the contents are rather more incendiary.
- Who is this?
- It's...
Hello, darling.
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it. It seems a secondary charge has been activated.
Sweet thing, I might need your help in the disposal of this parcel.
One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.
- Well, good luck.
HOLMES: One million pounds.
Oh, and by the way, fire.
Fire!
Leave my side, you'll be dead in an hour.
And don't be late for dinner.
My schedule will be quite tight because of these activities here.
- I've never been late in my life, only early.
- Fashionably.
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm!
Very witty. So confident, even in retreat.
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.
Fine. Dinner and a show.
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.
Herr Hoffmanstahl, you should count yourself lucky.
This faceless man with whom you find yourself in business is no ordinary criminal.
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.
I'm a consulting detective of some repute.
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock...
...Holmes.
MAN:
Hyah!
A fresh pot of tea. Thank you, George.
GEORGE:
Yes, Miss Adler.
MAN:
Fine choice, this place.
Do you have the letter?
It was taken.
MAN:
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.
During the chaos created by your package.
Thank you.
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.
You wish to know my plans now, do you?
Did you imagine, Miss Adler, that something would happen to you?
Is that why you chose to meet here in a public place?
Your favorite restaurant?
I don't blame you.
I blame myself.
It's been apparent to me for some time that you had succumbed to your feelings for him.
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes has inconvenienced me in recent months.
The question is...
...what to do about it.
But that's my problem to solve now.
I no longer require your services.
Mrs. Hudson?
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?
Holmes, you in there?
Your hedge needs trimming.
HOLMES (WHISPERINGS)
Where am I?
WATSON: I don't care where you are as long as you're ready.
HOLMES:
I'm waiting.
I'm not gonna play this game.
Remember, I have to catch the last...
- ...train.
HOLMES (IN NORMAL VOICE): Uh-oh.
- That's you dead, I'm afraid.
- You win.
I lose. Game over.
HOLMES:
Still don't see me?
I'm not going out with you dressed like that.
Would you prefer I joined you in the fashion faux pas...
...of wearing fine military dress with that heinous handmade scarf...
...clearly one of your fiancée's early efforts?
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.
Have you? Why?
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.
Extracting fluids from the adrenal glands of sheep...
...and designing my own urban camouflage...
...all the while verging on a decisive breakthrough...
...in the single most important case of my career, perhaps of all time.
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.
And thank you for looking after
Gladstone.
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny, might I have a word?
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.
You feed it.
Touchy, touchy.
Doctor, you must get him to a sanatorium.
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco, and coca leaves.
He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices as if he's rehearsing a play.
Leave him to me.
Don't you have a goat that needs worming?
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?
Good luck with your patient, doctor.
Why are you here?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Oh! Embrace me.
Watson's getting married.
- You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
- Yes, and you've picked them up.
- Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.
- Ha.
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.
It is our last adventure, Watson.
I intend to make the most of it.
WATSON: I see you've made good use of my old office.
HOLMES: Do you like my spider's web?
WATSON: Is that what you call it?
Follow that strand.
Question: What do a scandal involving an Indian cotton tycoon...
...the overdose of a Chinese opium trader...
...bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...
...and the death of a steel magnate in America all have in common?
WATSON: Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.
HOLMES:
Indeed.
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.
HOLMES:
Boxing champion at Cambridge...
...where he made friends with our current prime minister.
Do you have any evidence to substantiate your claim?
This. Now do you see?
WATSON: Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
- Yes.
I've heard you speak of him, extolling his virtues.
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront of medical innovations, a true pioneer.
Just the other day, I averted an explosion that was intended for him.
Says here he died of a heart attack.
Has all my instruction been for naught? You read the official statement and believe it.
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.
We're playing cat and mouse, the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.
I thought it was spider and fly?
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.
Not a mouse, but a dagger.
You're drinking embalming fluid.
Ooh. Yes. Care for a drop?
You do seem...
- Excited?
- Manic.
- I am.
- Verging on...
- Ecstatic?
- Psychotic.
- Should've brought a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise.
He must be stopped before his evil machinations come to a crescendo.
And how will he do all this?
Don't be a dingy bird. Bad people do bad things because they can.
No one, not the victims, the police, the governments, not anyone...
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
- Correct.
- ...on this diet, will work it all out.
- Right.
- Or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts, not quite there.
Here's to your good health.
Dingy bird.
What have you done to Gladstone now?
Ricinus communis.
The fruit is highly toxic.
He's barely breathing.
What an excellent opportunity.
This may be just the thing.
Sorry, do you mind terribly if I try my adrenal extract?
How many times are you going to kill my dog, Holmes?
Took off like a monkey from a box.
- Hmm.
- I may need one of those in a few hours.
HOLMES:
Consider it a wedding gift.
Watson, might we use an alternative exit?
Is there something different about you?
I'm under observation.
As you should be.
HOLMES:
You drive.
WATSON:
Will your beard be with us all night?
HOLMES: I'll remove it once we're south of Trafalgar Square.
WATSON: If you believe Moriarty has you under observation...
...isn't this a bit conspicuous?
HOLMES:
It's so overt, it's covert.
WATSON: Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.
Why are you looking at me with such concern?
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.
- Restriction.
- Structure.
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.
A life in matrimony, the possibility of a family.
Who wants to die alone?
We'll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight...
...you'll settle down, have a family, and I'll die alone.
WATSON:
Yes, that's about it.
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone than to live life in eternal purgatory.
Anyway...
Not bad, that.
So where are we going?
MYCROFT: In the future, there'll be one of those machines in every town in Europe.
Loitering in the woodshed again, are we, Myccie?
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.
As I detect that you've recently changed the brand of soap with which you shave.
The chimney in the front room at Baker Street...
...still needs a damn good sweeping up.
Were you aware that the hackney carriage by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?
Yes, the left. And it's plain to the meanest intelligence...
...that you have recently acquired a new bow for your violin.
Same bow, new strings.
And may I deduce, Mycroft...?
Good evening, by the way.
No.
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...
...who rarely strays from the path that runs from your home to the Diogenes Club...
...and never on a Monday when they serve your favorite potted shrimps...
...must be here for some far more important reason than my stag party?
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...
...but with all the conflict in Europe at the moment, the whole situation could...
Excuse me.... suddenly erupt.
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.
If the concerns of two nations...
...which shall remain nameless...
...but I can tell you they speak
French and German...
...are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...
...to attend the ghastly peace summit in Reichenbach.
The worst thing about Switzerland is the altitude.
It gives me nosebleeds, exacerbates my asthma-1...
I'm so glad you invited your brother.
This looks promising.
WOMAN:
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.
Perhaps a good cigar.
And don't bother with the chairs.
What is it your brother does exactly?
He's the keeper of the broom cupboard of state.
No ambition, no energy...
...yet I'm repeatedly told that he's indispensable to the British government...
...particularly the Foreign Office.
- I would like to propose a toast.
- Really?
To my dear friend, Dr. John...
...um, Hamish Watson...
I'm right here.
...On the eve of his wedding. He...
...has been the best companion.
Shouldn't we be waiting for the boys from my rugby club?
He has always kept us...
They couldn't attend.
...flat-footed on the ground.
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?
- No man's better worth having at your side...
- Who is it you're looking for?
Because I don't know a single damn person here, do I?
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?
You completely forgot about my stag party, didn't you?
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.
Shame none of your friends could make it.
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.
- Give me my money.
- Happily. Give me the wedding ring.
So now you're interested in being the best man.
You're supposed to keep the ring anyway.
Just as you're supposed to organize my stag party.
- Don't want to lose it on a bet.
- And invite my friends...
...of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...
...Sherly No Mates.
He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?
MAN:
I win!
WOMAN:
Please, sit.
Put your money on the table and we will begin.
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.
Cards can illuminate your past...
...clarify your present, and show you the future.
If you have a specific question, hold it in your mind.
HOLMES:
Mm.
I'm holding.
Let me know when you're ready.
Actually, I'd prefer to read...
...your fortune.
Temperance inverted.
Indicative of volatility.
A woman who has recently taken her comfort in drink.
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?
- A fool embarrassing himself?
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
- Oh, yes. The Fool.
Someone has been led astray, involved in something without their knowledge.
Not bad, but you have to make me believe you.
I have to see it in your eyes.
- Right. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?
And I see a name. Yes, it's...
...Rene.
What do you want?
The Devil.
Why are we playing this game?
Where did you get this?
I stole it from a woman in an auction room, but I believe it was intended for you.
SIM (IN FRENCH):
"Found my purpose in life."
So the question I've been holding is, what purpose is Rene fulfilling?
(IN ENGLISH) Time is up.
I have other clients.
Though you may not have detected the wisp of astrakhan fur...
...snagged on a nail over my left shoulder...
...you couldn't have failed to notice the overpowering aroma...
...of herring pickled in vodka...
...in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.
There's a man concealed in the rafters above us.
A Cossack, renowned for their infeasible acrobatic abilities...
...and are notorious for moonlighting as assassins.
So it's safe to presume that your next client is here to kill you.
Anything else? No?
HOLMES:
First, pillage the nest.
Clip wings.
Now blunt his beak.
Crack eggs.
Scramble. Pinch of salt.
Touch of pepper.
Flip the omelet.
Additional seasoning required.
Breakfast is served.
Come with me. I need you alive. Now.
WOMAN:
Oh!
Aah!
Didn't see that in the cards, did you?
CROWD:
Oh...
PUNTER:
Coming down, folks, coming down.
Looks like we've got ourselves our next cockfight.
Five, four, three, two, one...
...let him go!
PUNTER:
Get up there!
All mine?
Now, wait a minute.
You're right. He did stink.
WATSON:
Hey, you can run...
Where's you?
Just had a fight.
- Just had a fight.
- Yes.
- Where were you?
- I'm glad to see...
...you're taking your best-man duties so seriously.
I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!
She was biting my leg.
I'll have Carruthers put some fuel into that motor carriage of yours.
You do have a wedding to attend.
Oh, I'll drive.
CARRUTHERS:
Hmm.
Ho-honk. Ha-ha-ha.
WATSON: Let's have another drink.
- No, no, I think you've had quite enough.
SOLDIER:
Present arms!
MAN:
I've been to a wedding here before.
Funeral too.
The professor wants to meet.
I'd expected to hear from him sooner, in light of recent events.
He was wondering if it'd be convenient for you to come by the college this afternoon.
His lecture concludes at 4.
Looking forward.
One side, chummy.
(WOMAN SINGING IN GERMAN
OVER SPEAKERS)
"Fischerweise," Schubert, 1826.
- "Give up your foolish trickery."
- "This fish you cannot cheat."
I hope I'm not intruding.
Excuse me. Matthew, take these up to Mr. Williams.
And make sure he packs my white tie and tails.
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?
No, but might I trouble you for an inscription?
I read that the good doctor was to be married today.
How was the service?
Definitive.
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.
I trust you'll take this into consideration.
MORIARTY: And what considerations will you grant me?
Have you actually read the book?
I found it compelling...
...though I'm primarily interested in your more recent endeavors.
I take that as a compliment.
I have the utmost regard for your talents.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...
...officially.
HOLMES: Are you familiar with the study of graphology?
I've never given it any serious thought, no.
The psychological analysis of handwriting.
The upward strokes on the P, the J, and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.
While the flourishes on the lower zone...
...denote a highly creative yet meticulous nature.
But if one observes the overall slant and the pressure of the writing...
...there's a suggestion of acute narcissism, a complete lack of empathy...
- ...and a pronounced inclination toward...
- No.
...moral insanity.
In answer to your previous request regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...
...the answer is no.
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate that when two objects collide...
...there is always damage of a collateral nature.
Exempli gratia.
Two gentlemen find themselves at cross-purposes.
A young woman torn between them.
The strain proves loo much for her, and she suddenly falls ill...
...with tragic consequences.
A rare form of tuberculosis.
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.
Now...
...are you sure you want to play this game?
I'm afraid you'd lose.
Rest assured, if you attempt to bring destruction down upon me...
...I shall do the same to you.
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes, is the only reason you're still alive.
You've paid me several compliments.
Let me pay you one in return...
...when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality...
...I would cheerfully accept the latter.
I'll be sure to send my regards to the happy couple.
Another time, then.
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!
Which coach are we?
We should be just here.
Ooh.
First class.
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!
Hurry up, Dr. Watson, your wife needs you.
Coming, Mrs. Watson.
Ooh. First class, champagne.
You do know how to spoil a girl,
Mr. Watson.
You're not just any girl.
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory while the train's in the station.
You're Mrs. Watson.
Give me that bottle.
John, there is nowhere else in the world
I would rather be.
There's no one I'd rather be with.
Why do you have a gun stuffed down the back of your trousers?
Heh. Old habits.
Ahem. Come in.
- Oh, yes, please.
- We didn't order that.
With our compliments, sir.
Thank you. Put it there.
Open the door, John.
I think it's time for you to leave.
Sit down.
Shh.
I agree it's not my best disguise, but I had to make do.
- My God.
- They'll be back.
- John, shut the door.
- They'll only shoot through it.
HOLMES: He's right, you know.
- Oh, my God.
- I understand.
- Do you?
Terribly inconvenient.
We don't have much time.
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen.
WATSON: Who are they?
- A wedding present from Moriarty.
Lovely ceremony, by the way.
Many a tear shed in joy.
MARY:
Oh, John?
Yeah, just a minute, darling.
- Do you trust me?
- No.
Well, then I shall have to do something about that.
Who's up to bat next, you bastards?
Send out the fast bowler!
John, do shut the door.
It had to be done.
She's safe now.
In my own defense, I timed it perfectly.
Did you kill my wife?!
Did you just kill my new wife?!
Of course not!
What do you mean? How do you know that when you just threw her off a train?
I told you, I timed it perfectly.
What does that mean?!
- Calm down.
- Explain!
By the time I've explained, we'd both be dead!
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory while the train's in the station.
That was no accident.
It was by design.
Now, do you need me to elaborate...
...or can we just crack on?
Come on!
Don't worry, old boy, she's as safe as houses.
She's with my brother.
I'm on my honeymoon!
Why did you lead them here?!
Why did you involve us?!
They aren't here for me!
They're here for you!
Fortunately...
...so am I.
Now mind the door.
Good evening.
I think you'll find that second class is more comfortable.
The coast is clear.
To the south, quick march.
Lie down with me, Watson.
- Why?
- I insist.
What are we doing down here?
We are waiting. I am smoking.
- Patiently waiting.
- For what?
Your window of opportunity.
Make it count.
I said make it count.
How many windows must I provide?
Who'd have known that honeymooning in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?
Is that what this is about?
By your own admission, you've never enjoyed it there.
I've never been to Brighton.
Or you're just too fragile to remember at present.
Oh, shut up.
Tell me my wife's safe.
I can't do both.
I promise. As I said, I timed it perfectly.
MYCROFT:
Over here, madam!
I believe congratulations are in order,
Mrs. Watson.
I'm the other Holmes.
You mean there's two of you?
How marvelous.
Could this evening get any better?
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?
Excellent question.
The answer is twofold.
He's after us because of you.
I'm afraid you must bear half the responsibility.
- Here it comes. So predictable.
- Had you and Mary...
...not been hell-bent on wedding, we could've solved this case.
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- The argument could be made...
- No, it couldn't.
- ...that your nuptials were poorly timed.
Thus, our relationship...
Relationship?
Very well, partnership.
...has not yet run its course.
My dear fellow, if you could be bothered to see this through to the end...
...I shall never again ask you to assist me.
Once more unto the breach.
That's the spirit. Now, to the question.
This is so deliciously complicated.
You may be asking yourself...
...what does a criminal mastermind want with a simple gypsy fortune teller?
It's her brother, I tell you.
When we find him, and we must...
After you find my luggage.
Go on.
Wait.
Where is it we're going?
Paris, the most sensible honeymoon destination of all.
- So why Paris?
- Peaches.
Outside the city at Montreuil...
...there's a Gypsy camp famous for its dried fruit, especially peaches.
And there we shall find our fortune teller...
...and return her bag.
And my ticket?
Unfortunately, you won't be needing yours.
That's a shame, professor.
I was looking forward to Don Giovanni.
(MAN 3 & MORIARTY
SPEAK IN FRENCH)
Follow Meinhard.
Wake up, we're here.
Brace yourself.
We're about to be violated.
Don't be so cynical.
- They're taking my luggage.
- Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.
WATSON:
You had her bag.
Now they have my coat.
Where is Madam Simza?
TAMAS:
This is Simza.
Sim is a goose.
I am Sim. Ha-ha-ha.
Nice scarf. I like.
- You hungry?
- (IN ENGLISH) Famished.
Madam, this is a glorious hedgehog goulash.
I can't remember ever having had better.
Do tell me, when was the last time you had a hedgehog goulash?
I told you, Watson, I can't remember.
Perhaps you've repressed it.
That's where we differ.
Unlike you, I repress nothing.
Perfectly normal.
How dare you be rude to this woman who has invited us into her tent...
...offered us her hedgehog?
Says the man who throws women from trains.
Who are you two?
Concerned citizens.
Why did someone try to kill me?
Your brother has become involved with a very dangerous man...
...who clearly believes that Rene has told you something you shouldn't know.
I don't know anything.
I've been looking for him for over a year.
That was why I was in London.
- It's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you.
He'd never send you a message that would put you in harm's way.
Any information, therefore, would be, by default, unintentional.
Has he sent you anything else?
Just a few drawings.
Let's just see what they have to tell us.
Unusual choice of paper. Thicker gauge, designed for a printing press.
- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.
They smell musty.
Must have been stored somewhere cold and damp.
What's that? Blood?
Wine. So a wine cellar located near a printing press.
That should narrow it down.
There's a wine cellar used by the anarchist group Lapin Vert.
Rene was close to their leader.
Claude Ravache.
- A bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week.
I was a part of the movement.
So was Rene.
Until it became too extreme for us.
Ravache knows me.
If my brother's back there, he will see us.
We will send a message.
Whatever you do, don't let these gypsies make you drink.
Of course.
You dance?
For God's sake, don't dance.
It'll be the death of you.
You know what happens when you dance.
Huuh...
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.
- Have you had breakfast?
- I...
Stanley here does a wonderful deviled kidney.
MARY:
Ahem.
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir.
Telegram for Mrs. Watson.
Uh...
It just doesn't make any sense.
Allow me.
Oh, yes.
"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you.
I never wish to see you again.
Every moment I count away from you is a blessing."
Fret not.
It's a double encryption, my dear...
...that Sherly and I have used since we were boys.
If the first letter of the message is a consonant...
...then what follows is the mirrored truth.
- I see.
- Hmm.
Stanley!
You know, although our time together has been but a brief interlude...
...I'm beginning to understand how a man of particular disposition...
...under certain circumstances, extreme ones perhaps...
...might grow to enjoy the company of...
- ...a person of your gender. Hmm.
- Hmm.
Thank you so much.
Most charming.
May...? Terribly sorry. Thank you.
Where are you going, Stanley?
DRIVER:
Whoa, whoa.
Still hiding in basements?
RAVACHE (IN FRENCH):
I'm not here to see you.
(IN ENGLISH) Yeah.
RAVACHE (IN FRENCH):
...with your English friends.
1189, a seminal vintage.
The year of our glorious revolution.
- Is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny.
Is my brother here?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
You're lying.
Sit, please.
A letter was received from Rene using this same paper.
Of course.
He took it with him wherever he went.
He's telling the truth. Rene isn't here.
- He was given another assignment by an...
- An anonymous benefactor.
Another Englishman...
...with money, power, who supported our cause.
And now...
...he dictates our every move...
...demanding I take responsibility for his acts of terror.
I made a deal with the devil.
But after tonight, ahem...
...it will be over.
My job is almost done.
He's had you plant another bomb, hasn't he?
SIM:
Claude, please.
These men can help you.
I wish they could.
You see, gentlemen...
...he has my wife and children.
If you tell us where the bomb is...
- ...I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of.
We have a deal.
He and I.
No loose ends.
There's only one thing I can do to keep my family safe.
- You have less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!
He has no further need of that pistol.
Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?
WATSON:
There's only one way out of this place.
Right you are.
Ah. Ingenious.
That's the one. Quickly as we can.
You know what to do with that sandbag,
Watson.
Quick now.
Doctor, could you secure that lever?
You could have told me.
Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty.
He would never take his own life.
WATSON:
Calm yourself.
My brother, he's weak.
Sim, I need you to take a deep breath...
...and follow us.
To the opera.
I was mistaken.
- What?
- I made a mistake.
He took the shot from here.
Using a tripod and a shooting stick.
And realized there was a better position.
There's a faint scrape where he dragged his tripod and set it up here.
- Six hundred yards?
WATSON: Or 650?
HOLMES: Not to mention a seven- or eight-mile-an-hour wind.
He would've needed a wind gauge.
Which he placed here.
HOLMES:
And put a cigarette down here.
SIM:
Can anyone shoot that far?
Not more than half a dozen men in all of Europe.
How many of those men served in Afghanistan?
WATSON: Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.
Must have fallen out when he was rolling up.
Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian Moran.
Best marksman in the British army.
Dishonorable discharge.
He's likely now a gun for hire. This is the second victim of his that I've encountered.
WATSON:
What better way to conceal a killing?
No one looks for a bullet hole in a bomb blast.
- He's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon.
I don't have any papers.
WATSON:
And I am a foreigner.
This climate is exactly what
Moriarty wants.
Ahem.
The omelet fines herbes was divine...
...but they spared every expense on the tea.
Now shall we compare moods, or consider what we know?
Last night's bombing was clearly meant...
...to look like Germany's retaliation for Strasbourg.
However, the bomb was also meant to conceal the murder of just one man.
The man killed by the gunshot was none other than Alfred Meinhard.
Ah.
He makes guns. Big guns.
Only days ago, a large share of his company was bought by an unknown investor.
Moriarty.
The clues point in one direction, but to avoid repeating last night's debacle...
...I was obliged to collect more sufficient data, hence my tardiness.
Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.
WAITER:
Whoa!
- Just the bags.
- But...
We have enough time for me to indulge my little habit.
Yes.
HOLMES: His habit of feeding that urban species, the feral pigeon.
So there are seven mainline railway stations in Paris.
But taking 10 minutes to get to the Jardin des Tuileries...
...where the largest concentration of the winged vermin may be found...
...reduces there to one, the Gare du Nord...
...where he will be just in time to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.
It makes several stops along the way, one of which is...
Heilbronn.
Exactly where we must go.
Where Meinhard's factory is.
HOLMES:
It's Moriarty's factory now.
Unfortunately, due to the bombing...
...the crossing between
France and Germany is to be closed.
I'm afraid our pursuit is over unless we can happen upon a comrade...
...who knows their way around borders.
Too English.
However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.
Now, now, no need to be demeaning.
It is a nice scarf.
No, no, too English. It'll suit you more.
Black one is yours. Gray one is mine.
- And this is for you.
- Um... Hmm.
Right.
- Where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow.
Can't you ride?
It's not that he can't ride.
How is it you put it, Holmes?
They're dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle.
Why would I want anything with a mind of its own bobbing about between my legs?
Then I shall require a bicycle, thank you very much.
It's 1891. Could've chartered a balloon.
How can we make this more manageable?
HOLMES:
Where's the fire?
HOLMES: It's not as if Germany is going somewhere.
We know another way.
HOLMES:
Slow and steady wins the race.
HOLMES:
Come on!
WATSON: We slip in through the loading bay, find out what he's doing...
...and we get out.
Getting out might be tricky.
We will get you out.
If my brother's in there, get him out alive.
Are you happy?
- What?
- At this moment...
...are you as happy as you would be on your honeymoon in Brighton?
I'm not going to grace that question with an answer.
- Are you happy?
- I think we're here for another reason.
- Okay.
- Shall we get on...?
- Simple question.
- Will we do something?
- Or wait for them to come back round?
- What time is it?
- Three-fifteen.
- Over there...
...in the residential part of the complex should be a telegraph office.
Send this to Mycroft.
Be back here on the hour.
MORAN: That's what you get, Mr. Holmes, when industry marries arms.
Now put your gun down.
It's a bit old-fashioned.
What you need is one of these.
Go on.
Pick one.
Machine pistol, self-repeating.
Takes 1.63 caliber rounds...
...in one of these.
A 10-shot box magazine.
- Easy enough to load.
- Hmm.
I'd imagine one would have to retract the bolt to engage the first round.
Easier done than said.
Take him to the surgery.
I'll find the doctor.
"Come at once if convenient.
If inconvenient, come all the same."
MAN:
This is schnapps.
MORIARTY:
A telegram was sent from here.
This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit, distilled from potato mash.
A common misconception.
Thank you, by the way.
Who was it sent to?
My horror at your crimes is matched only...
...by my admiration at the skill it took to achieve them.
Who was it sent to?
HOLMES: You used the anarchists and their bombs to create a crisis in Europe...
...nation against nation
Under various pseudonyms, you bought, schemed, or murdered your way...
...into numerous industries, assuring that none of it could be traced to you.
Cotton, opium, steel, now arms and chemical weaponry.
All to be shipped across Europe in less than a week.
Everything from bullets to bandages.
Now that you own the supply, you intend to create the demand.
A world war.
MORIARTY:
You are familiar with Schubert's work.
The Trout is perhaps my favorite.
A fisherman grows weary of trying to catch an elusive fish.
Out the way, out the way.
So he muddies the water.
I'm warning you.
Confuses the fish.
You were warned.
It doesn't realize until too late that it has swum into a trap.
(SCHUBERT'S "DIE FORELLE"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
(HOLMES SCREAMING
OVER SPEAKERS)
Let's try this again, shall we?
To whom did you send the telegram?
To my...
To my brother Mycroft.
What are you playing at?
That's not fair.
I've just got one more question for you.
Which one of us is the fisherman...
...and which the trout?
Holmes?
- Holmes?
HOLMES: Unh.
Take your time. Take your time.
Uh...
Always good to see you, Watson.
- What were you thinking?
- Wait.
Wait?
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him right where I wanted him.
Right. Crack on, then.
Professor.
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Don't waste time attending to me.
I'll find them. I'll find them.
Turn in three, two, one.
Come on, hurry up!
MARKO:
Go!
SIM: Did you see my brother?
HOLMES: No, but I'm certain he's been here.
WATSON: Where are we going?
- Over that wall.
- How did you know I'd find you?
HOLMES: You didn't find me.
You collapsed a building on me.
WATSON: Where are the horses?
- They're behind.
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?
What's our way out?
That's our way out.
SIM:
Go! Go!
WATSON:
Come on!
Marko! Marko!
He's not breathing.
Cradle his head.
Raise his legs.
Bloody well not gonna die on me.
I'm not gonna make this easy on you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I know you can hear me, you selfish bastard.
Come on!
I know you can hear me, you bastard.
His wedding gift.
HOLMES:
Terrible dream.
You, Mary, Gladstone and I were in a restaurant.
That satanic pony was there as well, a massive fork in his hoof...
...and he turned on me!
What have you administered?
Your wedding present.
Who's been dancing on my chest?!
ME.
Why is my ankle so itchy?
You have a large piece of wood sticking out of it.
Good Lord. You, Tamas.
I have an important job to discuss with you. Remind me of it later.
Sit down. Drink this.
I need to get that out before it turns septic.
- Did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably.
Just leave it in. Leave it...!
You are a...
- Oh, you are some sort of...
- Be nice.
I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.
Me too.
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.
We're going home.
Via Switzerland.
What better place to start a war than a peace summit?
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?
I don't understand why you don't cancel the summit.
Fact is it's gonna happen whether we like it or not.
Everyone has already arrived.
Although these gentlemen may be talking peace...
...believe me, they're readying their armies at home.
To cancel the summit now would be tantamount to war.
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.
Oh, doubled security. That's comforting.
You don't understand the delicacy of the situation.
I passed the telegram on to my superiors.
But they brought Moriarty in to advise on the peace process in the first place.
He has positioned himself brilliantly.
He's one of our foremost intellectuals, a personal friend...
Of the prime minister.
Yes, we all know that.
I believe you, but where's your evidence?
He's too good to leave evidence.
He doesn't leave loose ends.
SIM:
Oh, he's alive.
Sherly, put that down.
What is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating.
That's my private and personal supply of oxygen, and you're not to touch it.
This argument is getting us nowhere.
I've arranged for documents to be prepared which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.
Stanley, Stanley.
You haven't aged a day.
Is that my favorite chutney?
Fact is, we don't really know what he's planning.
SIM: It won't be another bomb.
WATSON: No, it wouldn't be.
SIM:
It doesn't make sense.
Why would he attack all the nations only to unite them?
It'll be an assassination.
By alone gunman at close range.
Rene.
Unfortunately, yes.
- You knew.
- I had my suspicions.
But having seen who would be attending,
I'm now certain.
MYCROFT: Well, at least we know who to look out for.
Rene will be the evidence.
If we can find him and stop him, we will perhaps not only save his life...
...but prevent the collapse of
Western civilization.
No pressure.
Welcome, ambassador.
Professor James Moriarty.
(WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS)
MYCROFT:
Now we're all present...
...I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador...
...the French prime minister and his man.
And the other nations are really working out which side to take should hostilities erupt.
Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar, and the Russian ambassador.
The Archduke Karl Ludwig and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.
The Romanian Prime Minister and his ambassador.
And of course our prime minister and the British ambassador.
He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries are assembled, preferably standing still.
Is there to be an official photograph?
Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.
In which case, we might as well dance.
I've never done this before.
Just follow my lead.
- What do you see?
- Everything.
That is my curse.
But you don't see what you're looking for.
I thought you'd never ask.
Over my shoulder.
Young man, German uniform, ceremonial sword.
Got him.
HOLMES:
Professional opinion?
WATSON:
Trauma.
Major injury.
But excellent repair work.
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.
HOLMES: You did say he was at the forefront of a medical innovation.
We've already seen an example of his skills.
Those twins weren't twins.
My suspicions were aroused in Heilbronn...
...when one failed to go to the aid of the other.
I also noticed the discreet but unmistakable puckering behind the ear...
...where his skin had been drawn back.
I should've realized then...
...that they were a surgical experiment.
To see if it is possible to make one man look like another.
HOLMES:
His face is no longer his own.
What better way to guarantee his world war than to make the assassin...
One of the ambassadors.
That narrows down the possibility to one of six.
You and Sim shall find her brother.
- Of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes.
You know my methods.
And I know where you'll be.
No possible solution could be more congenial to me than this.
By the way, who taught you how to dance?
You did.
Well, I've done a fine job.
Be careful.
Shall we go to work?
Ladies and gentlemen, please, gather for the portrait.
I'm sorry.
Is this a bad time?
Never better.
- Would you bring that clock?
- Heh.
We get to play that game after all.
Here we are.
Don't want you to catch a cold.
A five-minute game?
If you think you can manage it.
We both have two bishops.
I may be absent from the room, but my methods are not.
You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.
That doesn't seem fair.
Right. The surgery will have left scars.
Only four of them have the hairline to hide them.
The ambassador that you replaced with Rene, is he still alive?
Would you like me to recommend your next move?
They're all my brother's height, right build...
...but their eyes.
Their eyes are wrong.
Rene has blue eyes.
He could be wearing glass lenses to change the color.
In which case, his eyes will be hurting.
Rene is left-handed.
HOLMES: Perhaps the assassin will take measures...
...Io ensure he doesn't give himself away.
Like a gambler concealing a tell.
I think it might be him.
You think?
Your clock is ticking.
You have to be sure.
MORIARTY:
May I remind you, this is blitz chess
A single miscalculation will cost you the game.
If I tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.
HOLMES:
Maybe it's less obvious.
A nervous tic. A ﬂutter of anxiety.
I expect everyone has a reason to be nervous tonight.
I don't know.
HOLMES:
So perhaps it's the opposite:
A failure to behave naturally.
An actor so consumed with his performance...
...that the one characteristic he cannot accommodate...
...is spontaneous reaction.
Carruthers, protect the prime minister.
Germany will pay! Mark my words!
That doesn't bode well, does it?
Seems your bishop was of some benefit after all.
The game is still young.
Actually, it's in its adolescence.
RENE:
There are more of us!
Germany will pay!
No loose ends.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
What happened to him?
I'm a doctor. A doctor!
SIM (IN ENGLISH):
What happened?
- Curare.
- What's wrong with him?
It's poison.
Do something!
Doctor, do something!
No.
I think you've just lost your most valuable piece.
But a winning strategy sometimes necessitates sacrifice.
A war has been averted.
Mm. Oh, I disagree.
How so?
Didn't you find it strange that the telegram you sent...
...didn't inspire any action to stop me?
You see, hidden within the unconscious...
...is an insatiable desire for conflict.
So you're not fighting me so much as you are the human condition.
All I want to do is own the bullets and the bandages.
War on an industrial scale is inevitable.
They'll do it themselves within a few years.
All I have to do is wait.
I like Switzerland.
They respect a man's privacy here.
Particularly if he has a fortune.
Bishop takes knight. Check.
The game is over.
You should get that shoulder looked at.
About that fortune of yours.
I believe it's just been substantially reduced.
King to rook two.
I attended several of your lectures.
The equations of motion, which you will find in my book.
The energy that is required to release these explosions is...
HOLMES: It was in Oslo when I first caught a glimpse of your little notebook...
...red leather-bound from
Smythson of Bond Street.
Rook to king's rook three. Check.
Bishop to rook three.
Its importance was not fully apparent to me...
...until I observed your penchant for feeding pigeons.
Then it occurred that with an empire so enormous...
...even you must keep a record of it somewhere.
Bishop takes bishop.
Rook to bishop four.
I then only required the notebook itself.
You didn't make it easy.
Just the bags.
I would need to endure a considerable amount of pain.
HOLMES:
Mycroft...
...care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.
But the notebook would undoubtedly be encoded, so how then to break the code?
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook.
Bishop to bishop seven.
Queen takes knight pawn.
Does The Art of Domestic Horticulture mean anything to you?
How could a man as meticulous as you own such a book...
...yet completely neglect the flowers in his own window box? Irony abounds.
Never mind, it's safe, in London...
...where my colleagues are making good use of it.
The most formidable criminal mind in
Europe has just had all his money stolen...
...by perhaps the most inept inspector in the history of Scotland Yard.
Any chance of a cup of tea?
Box 0403.
CLARK: Tick.
MARY: Box 0801.
- How much more is there?
- That's the end of page two.
Page three.
He'll be making an anonymous donation to the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.
Bishop to bishop eight. Discover check.
And, incidentally, mate.
I seem to have injured my shoulder.
Would you mind?
Be my pleasure.
Once we've concluded our business here...
...it's important you know...
...I shall endeavor to find the most creative of endings for the doctor.
And his wife.
HOLMES:
His advantage, my injury.
My advantage, his rage.
Incoming assault feral, but experienced.
Use his momentum to counter.
MORIARTY:
Come now.
You really think you're the only one who can play this game.
Trap arm. Target weakness.
Follow with haymaker.
HOLMES: Ah. There we find the boxing champion of Cambridge.
MORIARTY:
Competent, but predictable.
Now allow me to reply.
HOLMES:
Arsenal running dry. Adjust strategy.
MORIARTY:
Wound taking its loll.
HOLMES: As I feared.
Injury makes defense untenable.
Prognosis increasingly negative.
MORIARTY: Let's not waste any more of one another's lime.
We both know how this ends.
HOLMES:
Conclusion, inevitable.
Unless...
WATSON: A few words may suffice to tell the little that remains.
Any attempt at finding the bodies was absolutely hopeless.
And so there...
...deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam...
...will lie for all lime...
...the most dangerous criminal...
...and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.
I shall' ever regard him as the best...
...and the wisest man whom
I have ever known.
MARY:
John?
- John.
- Mm-hm.
You should probably pack.
It's half past 2...
- ...and the carriage is coming at 4.
- Mm.
It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.
Yes, it'll be fun.
I'm looking forward to it.
You know I miss him too..
...In my own way.
He would have wanted us to go.
He would have wanted to come with us.
When's Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?
Oh, soon.
Three o'clock.
Mary?
Who delivered this parcel?
MARY:
The postman.
WATSON:
The usual chap or...
...did he look peculiar?

So, February 1, 2005.
0800 hours.
This begins the inquiry into the mission herein referred to as "Operation
Provide Support."
Commander Axe, do you have anything to say before we begin?
Uh, well, sir, it's actually more of a question than a statement.
Can I have a beer?
You may not have a beer.
But you may stand up and raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yeah.
Uh, sir, am I on trial here?
'Cause I got the word about wearing the dress whites, and now we're doing the whole oath thing.
For now, this is not an official legal proceeding.
Think of it as an informal conversation to sort out exactly what happened here.
We've got over a dozen casualties, some structures destroyed, a few vehicles destroyed.
This little disaster is gonna take some serious sorting out.
I mean, that's why
I suggested the beer.
I'll ask you not to waste my time, Commander Axe.
Now, can we begin?
You're the boss, sir.
Let's start with how you first became involved in this operation.
Ah.
Uh, that kind of depends.
There's kind of the "official" beginning, and then the "unofficial" beginning.
You know what I mean?
Right, well, uh, okay.
This whole thing began... in bed.
A couple weeks back,
I had just started seeing
a lady by the name of Donna.
Great gal.
Thing is, we were still
getting to know each other,
and it turned out, uh...
I didn't know her
as well as I thought.
Pretty good.
You should come by and teach the teams a few moves.
You should teach my husband a few moves.
Wait a second. Your husband?
You're married?
Oh, don't be that way.
It's fine.
Uh, well, no, actually, uh...
It's not fine.
I kind of have a thing about that.
He barely looks at me now.
It's like he's not even my husband anymore. He's just -- oh, my God. He's here.
What?!
I don't understand!
He should still be in D.C.!
That's your husband?
You're married to Admiral Maitland?
Just -- just go, okay?
No, no, not that way!
He'll see you!
No! The bathroom!
Well, it's been great.
Now, as a S.E.A.L.,
I've been involved in evasive
maneuvers, but this...
...Was an unusual
tactical situation.
Hey, Donna?!
What's the matter with Buster?
He's going crazy out here.
I don't know.
Still, same principles apply
in any hostile encounter
when you need to get out clean
without engaging the enemy --
identify an escape route...
Ooh!
...And blend seamlessly
into the surroundings.
Wait, wait -- how exactly does this relate to the mission in question?
Uh,
I'm getting there, sir.
This -- this is important,
I promise.
I just don't want to hear any more of your romantic escapades.
Is there a point?
Okay, so, that night...
...I headed out.
Now, with this type of problem,
some men will duck and cover,
others will turn to booze.
Me? Let's just say I have
my own secret weapon.
I swear, every time I see you, you look different.
Comes with the job, Sam.
Hey, nice tan, Mikey.
Where you been?
Someplace sunny.
Well, it agrees with you --
I remember how pasty you got when we were stuck back in Poland in '92.
Hey, how long you in town?
A few days of debriefing at least.
We'll see.
So, not to impose, but you feel like advising an old buddy with a sticky situation?
How sticky?
Sticky like, let's get a table and a few more rounds.
Sam.
An admiral?
It had to be an admiral's wife?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So, look, what do you think
I should do here?
Go to Maitland and explain.
Tell him you didn't know who she was until things had already gotten out of hand.
In fact, call him right now.
Mike, that's not what I -- look, I was more looking for that super-spy advice on how to keep this quiet.
You remember that thing in Kiev with Misha?
When he sold out the wetwork team on their way to Paris?
Hell, yeah.
What about that?
That's the kind of secret that stays secret.
Because if it comes out, people get sent to Siberia.
This will come out as soon as Maitland looks sideways at his wife.
Seriously, Mike, you know,
I know you're a smart guy, but you've dated, like, one lady, and she was a frickin' psycho.
I'm just saying...
You may not be the expert on this whole boy-girl thing.
My job is to know what people are gonna do before they do it.
Which is how I know you're not gonna take my advice and this is gonna blow up in your face, Sam.
I don't know.
I mean, how smart can spies be, right?
You're always fighting on the side with no guns.
There are certain rewards to fighting on the side with no guns.
Tell you what, one day, you're gonna give me some spy lessons, deal?
Deal.
Mm. I got to go.
You gonna be all right?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Thanks for the beer.
Oh, and, Sam...
...Be careful.
So, I have a few more drinks
and head home,
figuring that maybe it's best
not to get relationship advice
from a spy.
Thing is,
turned out the spy was right.
Commander Axe?
You need to come with us.
Says who?!
You were in my house...
In bed with my wife!
And don't even try to deny it,
'cause I found your belt.
Does that look familiar?
I talked to Donna, and she told me everything.
Admiral,
I was unaware, sir, that she was your significant other.
You were unaware?
You're a Navy S.E.A.L.!
You're trained in battlefield awareness, and you didn't see my name on the mailbox?!
Well, sir, I wasn't exactly in that frame of mind, sir.
A-as you can imagine,
I was otherwise occupied, sir.
I'll stop talking now, sir.
So, I checked my docket for an assignment that would get you out of my sight for the foreseeable future.
And I think I found just the thing.
Oh, not Siberia.
Please not Siberia.
You're going to Colombia.
Tonight.
Oh, sir, with all due respect,
I'd need to pack, sir, and, well, uh --
Are you refusing orders?
No, sir. No, sir.
Of course not.
It's just that I -- well, it's been a while, sir.
And, of course, for a mission in South America,
I should really brush up on my Spanish.
Well, you got a 12-hour plane ride, so...
...Brush up, amigo.
"Amigo."
That's "friend," right, sir?
Get the hell out of my office!
So, like a good soldier,
the next morning
I was up bright and early
enjoying a first-class
plane ride down to Colombia.
Hey!
What the hell are you wearing, brother?
I got issued these.
You do know most of Colombia is green, right?
Yeah, I don't think the guy who issued them wanted me to blend in.
Can you turn that crap off?
You know, I was supposed to be takin' some Green Beret named Donohue down on this mission.
Heard he got drunk and set a tank on fire.
Guess you screwed up even worse, huh?
Yeah, it would seem so.
What did you do?
Must have been something crazy, man!
Look, I don't want to get into it, okay?
Suit yourself.
Good luck, big guy!
Yeah, thanks.
I read over the mission.
Essentially I was going down
to check on reports
of unrest in the region.
Basically,
a local Colombian official
with connections in the states
called in a few favors.
He needed someone to observe
and report on a situation
so he could scare up
some U.S. military aid.
And I was the lucky guy
who got to do the observing
and reporting.
So, I read the file, but I was hoping you could fill me in on the basics of the situation.
I was dropped into this a little...suddenly.
This group, the so-called
"Espada Ardiente," has been staging serious attacks all over this countryside.
And the situation is getting only worse and worse.
We need help.
Espada Ardiente.
Is that some kind of homegrown insurgent group?
Yes. Actually, we don't know much about them.
There's someone
I would like you to meet.
Will you follow me, please?
Commandante Veracruz!
Let me introduce
Commander Axe.
It is a pleasure,
Commander Axe.
Commandante Veracruz has worked before with American soldiers.
He is at your disposal.
I believe we have mutual acquaintances.
I trained at the school of the Americas in '92.
Well, hell, if you trained there in '92,
I knew every last son of a bitch that made you do push-ups in the mud.
Vick Rayburn.
No, no, no. You mean...
"The terror."
That's the guy.
..."The terror." Of course.
So, what's the plan?
We have intelligence that Espada Ardiente is planning to attack an international clinic run by a group called "Doctors For All."
A hospital. Seriously?
Unfortunately, yes.
Until now, they have stayed clear of civilian targets.
The clinic sits in a strategic pass in the mountains.
We believe the terrorists want to use it to take control of that region.
Our plan is for you and Commandante Veracruz to get there before that can happen.
I trust we are in good hands?
Of course.
Thank you, sir.
Goodbye.
Let's meet the guys.
Fantastic. Please.
Hello, señor.
Whoa, oh!
So it was the standard drill.
I met Veracruz's team.
And we headed out up the
mountains toward the territory
that this Espada Ardiente group
was occupying.
Spent a couple days
driving up and down mountains
and getting carsick.
Not much to report, at least
until we got further north
and started seeing
some of the places
these guys had attacked.
It was mostly little stuff --
blown-up vehicles,
burned campsites --
but it was enough
to make me think
we needed to get
to this clinic asap,
make sure nothing happened.
The clinic
was conveniently located
in the middle of nowhere.
After our long trek there,
I figured they'd offer us
a beer for our trouble.
But they weren't exactly happy
to see us.
Okay, this is -- this is just crazy.
Why would anyone attack the clinic?
I'm sorry, doctor.
But our intelligence indicates there may be an attack.
And so what are we supposed to do, hmm?
Uh, evacuate?
That would be best.
We can give you until tomorrow to -- to -- to --
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tomorr-- listen, I've got people in there too sick to move.
Now, how am I supposed to evacuate by t--
Okay. Hey, guys. Hey.
You know, let me handle this.
American to American.
I'm Canadian.
Uh, North American to North American?
Look, you know, we're not trying to bust your chops here, but you're not gonna help your patients if you guys get shot.
Listen, sir, we don't have any problems with the Espada Ardiente, okay?
Un segundo, un segundo.
Okay, please.
So -- so just tell me, how am I supposed to evacuate my clinic by tomorrow?
Hey, Ben.
Hi.
Why don't you go and take care of the patient?
And I've got this.
Yeah?
This way, soldier.
It's, uh, "Commander," actually.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, what's his problem?
He's a doctor.
It's his job to cure people.
You're a soldier.
It's your job to kill them.
Take a wild guess what his problem might be, bright eyes.
And you are?
Amanda Maples.
I'm with the local food relief program.
We work out of the clinic.
Nice threads, by the way.
Really subtle.
Yeah. It's a long story.
Ah.
So, you want to talk to your buddy in there?
'Cause you guys could be in danger.
Yeah, I'll do my best.
For now, though, we'd all really appreciate it if you'd get lost.
'Cause if we weren't a target before, we definitely will be if you guys don't leave.
As a soldier,
I can't just leave.
Sure you can. You just -- you get in the truck.
And you turn the key, you put your foot on the pedal -- it's on the floor -- and you go.
What's going on?
Who's the kid?
She may be with one of the terrorists.
We caught her sneaking into one of the trucks.
Aah!
Hey, hey.
Everybody just calm down here.
Geez. Okay.
So, kid...
Okay, guys, come on.
She's just looking for something to eat. Let's not go crazy.
It's not our mission to rough up hungry teenagers, right?
No. Of course.
Of course. Of course.
Here you go, kid.
So, look,
I talked to the doctor and the lady from the food-aid program, but they don't know anything about an attack.
All I got out of them was a polite invitation to screw off.
We will make camp nearby.
If there is an attack, we will be ready.
Veracruz's camp
was pretty remote.
But let me tell you, his guys
were seriously well-armed.
I didn't know exactly
who we were up against yet,
but they had enough firepower
to wipe them off the map.
So I decided I'd just keep
my head down, do my job,
and make my reports to H.Q.
Like a good boy.
Commander Axe for Admiral Maitland, please.
Yes, sir, uh, no contact with any terrorists yet, sir.
We're a couple of miles from the clinic.
Good. Carry on as long as it takes.
Sir, what exactly does
"as long as it takes" mean?
It means "next time, stay away from the wives of ranking officers."
Uh...
See you in a few months.
Roger that.
Hey. Just calling to command to let them know what's up.
Fantastic. Perhaps you would like to relax, eat some supper?
My men and I are going to scout the area.
Oh, good. Well, I'll go with you. My gear's right in there.
Actually, señor, it is better if you stay here.
Whoa. Stay here?
I mean, I can't exactly observe and report from the inside of my tent, can I?
Come on, I can handle a little night scouting, huh?
I'm sure you can,
Commander Axe.
But I am responsible for your safety.
If we make contact with the terrorists, we will come for you immediately.
This is where things kind of started to go sideways.
You might want to mark that down in your notes.
"Things went sideways."
So, what did you do?
I guess you could say
I modified my orders.
Well, señor...
Buenos noches.
So I decided to conduct
a scout of my own.
I did a basic perimeter check.
Searched for tire tracks,
signs of activity.
The only hostile forces I found
was a nest of spiders
as big as quarters.
And in the middle of fighting
those little bastards off,
I hear voices.
I go in, check it out,
thinking maybe it was
the Espada Ardiente guys.
But what do I find instead?
Veracruz,
unloading a bunch of weapons
from a hidey-hole
in the mountain.
I listen in
on their conversation,
and guess what I hear --
they're planning on attacking
the clinic themselves
and making it look
like the rebels did it.
And after I make my report...
We destroy the clinic then shoot the American in the head.
Son of a bitch.
I bet lots of stuff
go bad in an operations.
But finding out
I was supposed to get killed
as part of a plot
to get U.S. military aid?
That was a new one.
So I just stayed calm
and made my way back to camp
as efficiently as possible.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
L-l-let's go back, here.
I'm confused.
Y-you're saying you did not make contact with Espada Ardiente at this point?
- Because our reports indicate --
- Well, where did you get the reports?
From Veracruz's paramilitaries?
And, what, you think they were gonna announce that they were officially planning on putting two in the back of my head?
What I really want to hear about is how you were kidnapped by terrorist forces.
Oh. Yeah, well, that's not entirely accurate.
See, I couldn't let Veracruz
know that I was onto him.
So I put together
a little kidnapping scene
for them to find
and double-timed it
back to the clinic.
Man, what -- what the hell are you doing down here, man?
It's 5:00 a.m.
You and me need to talk.
Now.
Okay, so,
I-I-I'm confused here.
Why would anybody want to attack us?
Because it's a ploy.
If they can make this terrorist group look like they massacred a clinic and killed yours truly,
Veracruz can do anything he wants down here and get a blank check to do it.
Right, but here's the thing -- we're not political. Okay?
I've never even heard of the es-- w-what is it?
Espada Ardiente.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It happens all the time.
I saw it when I worked in Africa.
Some military group needs aid, so they do something really terrible and blame it on their enemies.
The point is, you guys got to move fast, okay?
So, in the meantime,
I need your sat phone.
Yeah, okay.
Good luck there.
When we need to make a call, we have to go all the way to Santa Marta.
Seriously?
You got nothing?
Hey, we're not the Mayo Clinic.
And quick question -- how do you propose that we get out of here?
On our -- on our Medevac helicopter?
Or our fleet of ambulances?
We are a tiny clinic in the mountains.
I'm not the one you're fighting here.
I'm just trying to lay it out for you.
And we appreciate it.
But this Veracruz of yours is looking for you, and we can't have him finding you here.
So...just go.
We can take care of ourselves.
He must have been kidnapped.
Did you hear anything else?
No, nothing.
Sorry, Commander.
It's okay.
You still have an important role to this mission, señor Garcia.
When I tell the Americans what happened,
I will say you bravely tried to fight off the Espada Ardiente.
But sadly...
You were killed.
Throw his body in the ravine and take pictures for the report.
And the clinic?
With the American gone, there's no use waiting.
We will destroy the clinic ourselves and make the report.
So the bad news was Veracruz
was making his move early --
a fact I learned
when I ran into a familiar face
on the road.
Oh. Jesus, what --
You're the kid from earlier, right? The food thief?
What the hell are you doing back here?
I'm trying to get people out of the clinic.
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down a second.
Since when do you speak English?
I used to watch
"Full House."
You know, Veracruz is coming!
We have to go!
Veracruz?
How do you know he's coming?
I was watching his camp.
You were spying
on his camp.
I wasn't spying.
I was trying to steal food.
And they caught me, and then I tried again.
What do you care?!
Veracruz shot one of his men for letting you escape!
He's on his way here now!
He's on his way here now!
Hey. Whoa. Oh.
No, no.
Not you again.
I thought
I told you to go --
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
I got a new plan.
We're gonna get everybody out of here. Now.
Uh, c-commander, could you maybe -- can you slow down and then explain?
Yeah.
This is not the time to slow down.
Veracruz and his men are on their way here right now.
And with these roads, we got about 30 minutes.
Hey, can you be a sweetheart?
Grab these oxygen tanks.
Wait,
I thought you said that Veracruz wasn't coming until later.
Yeah, he changed his mind.
Funny how that happens.
Okay, what are y'all doing with my stuff?
Let me ask you -- do you have a secret cache of weapons around here that I don't know about?
No, I don't have a secret cache of weapons.
Right.
I didn't think so.
Here you go, kiddo.
So, between, uh, these tanks and the fuel out back, we should have just enough to blow the place.
What?! No! Whoa!
No, no, no!
You're not going to destroy the clinic!
Isn't Veracruz coming to do the same exact thing?
No, Veracruz wants to destroy the clinic with the people inside.
I want to destroy the clinic to create a distraction to save the people.
Little bit of a difference.
Okay, this is insane.
No, you can't do this.
Look, guys, you can't really believe that Veracruz's guys are not gonna see everybody leaving?
We got to cover our tracks.
He's right, guys.
It's the best way.
See? The teenage thief girl agrees with me.
Now, boys and girls, this is happening.
You stay here, you die.
You come with me...
We live?
Well, the odds are a little better.
So, look, let's do this.
Get the patients outside, load them in the trucks, and let me know if you see any bad guys.
I can't believe we're doing this.
What about me?
You and me are gonna build a bomb.
Oh.
We're gonna build a bomb.
Okay, we got diesel, oxygen, propane out back...
The whatchamacallit that's my defibrillator.
Right.
You wouldn't happen to have any nitrous oxide, would you?
No. We are a bush hospital.
Not a suburban dentist's office.
Look, what am I supposed to be doing here?
Hold on. Okay, great.
Take that.
This is your detonator.
Yeah. That's gonna go -- okay.
Tape that right on top of that valve.
Okay.
Real quick -- the warning label says "keep away --"
Yeah. That's right.
We're building a bomb, okay?
So you do the opposite of what the warning label says.
Hey, how we doing out here?
My God. She ran off, and she won't stop crying.
Hey, hey, sister.
Easy, now.
Now, I'm not an expert here, but I don't think that's how you get a kid to stop crying.
Sí. Blech!
Rápido, por favor.
Easy-peasy.
Let's get the hell out of here.
You set up everything like I told you?
Yes, yes, yes, I did --
I set my tank by the support beam at the front just like you said.
Are you sure you got it right?
We can only push this button once.
No, I'm not sure if I got it right.
How am I supposed to know if I got it right?
Okay, people, the second I hit this, that thing goes, we got to be on the move.
It's the smoke and the fire that's gonna cover our escape.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
I didn't mean it that way.
New plan.
A new plan? I got to trigger it manually.
What do you mean?
Manually?
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Stay in the truck!
No. Maybe I can fix it.
Maybe I can --
I guess you fixed it.
What the hell did you do?
I maximized the pressure.
Because you told me -- you told me to maximize the pressure!
Yeah, I know. I just didn't know you were gonna do it so well.
You got talent.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We're safe, then.
Oh, no.
We're a long way from safe.
Uh, sorry to keep you guys waiting.
Uh, sir, do you know that they locked me in my room last night?
So I got to say, this is starting to feel less and less like an "informal conversation."
Still just an inquiry,
Commander.
Although after yesterday's testimony,
I wouldn't make any travel plans.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Now, amidst all the tales of your heroics, we seem to have lost sight of your initial mission, which is gathering intel on a terrorist organization known as "Espada Ardiente."
Right. I was just getting to that, actually.
So, after the unfortunate sacrifice of the clinic, we all regrouped a few miles up the road.
Well, they're not after us just yet.
I'm guessing that by the time they sort things out, we're gonna have about an hour head start.
An hour? All of that back there bought us an hour?
Is that supposed to be good news?
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
It's better than a minute, worse than a day.
So in the meantime, we got to get those folks someplace we can hide.
The closest town is Santa Rosa.
Yes, yes. .
There's a clinic there.
Yeah, unfortunately, we can't go to the nearest town that has a clinic.
It's the first place they're gonna be looking for a bunch of sick people.
They need medical attention, okay?
- Why don't we just drop them off?
- Well, you might as well hand them over to Veracruz and save on gas.
Now, where else can we go?
No place else.
All the other so-called villages are just a bunch of houses and a church.
I know a place.
A camp, nearby.
A camp? Whose camp?
Espada Ardiente.
Oh. Okay.
Do you remember back when you were just a hungry teenager who couldn't speak English?
You said you'd never even heard of the Espada Ardiente.
I lied.
They can help us.
They can hide the sick ones.
You know what?
I don't think we have any other choice.
Looks like we're going with little miss terrorist here.
Just to clarify,
Commander -- you decided to join the group that you were sent to Colombia to investigate?
Well, "join" is kind of a strong word, sir.
I mean, uh, we were in trouble, and there were not a lot of options in the area.
All right.
And this Beatriz you mention.
I have no record of her.
Well, that's not surprising.
She's a kid.
She's a kid who led you to a suspected terrorist camp.
What do you want me to say?
I mean, she was a mystery to me, too.
This kid -- well, sir, you would understand if you met her.
Okay, so, um...
Why am I the only one wearing a blindfold?
'Cause
I don't trust you.
- You're a soldier.
- Oh, that's why.
Do your parents know that you hang out with the Espada Ardiente?
- Don't talk about my parents!
- Okay. Hey. Easy.
You know, what I'm trying to say is this -- most girls your age are into, you know, makeup and stuff, malls.
Do you see any shopping malls around here?
Uh, no.
You blindfolded me, remember?
There are none.
So no more questions.
Okay, look,
I'm not trying to pry.
I'm just curious how you hooked up with these guys.
They're my friends.
Okay.
So, how much longer till we get to your friends?
I got to get my hands on their communications equipment and call in.
Uncover your eyes.
We're here.
You got to be kidding.
This?
This is the Espada Ardiente?
Yes.
Is there a problem?
What -- well, this is, like, 12 guys.
I was hoping for some kind of army or something to keep us from getting massacred.
Look, Espada Ardiente is -- and what does that mean, anyway?
"Flaming" something or other.
"Sword"!
You don't understand!
"Ardiente" means fearless, passionate.
We burn to defeat our enemies.
Right, okay. I got it.
The "flaming sword."
So what if they're small?
We can fight just as hard as anyone!
Look, I hate to cut your speech short, sweetheart.
But you know what?
The size of your army matters.
Okay?
It matters a lot.
I mean, you're not gonna win a war with a flock of sheep.
Look, it's all about firepower.
Do these guys have any equipment?
Most of our men have hunting rifles.
Ammunition is low, but --
You're not making me feel any better, here, kid.
Or how about experience?
Some of them were in the army.
And our best fighter is Luis.
Oh, the big guy there?
No.
The one next to him.
Wonderful.
These guys took out a truck full of paramilitary troops?
How do you figure that?
Luis shot the tires out of their truck, and it went down the hill.
They killed his goats!
His -- his goats?
You're serious?
Your best fighter is a goat herder?!
Goat herders? Really?
Ihola! Ihola!
Ben.
Oh, no. Is her cough back?
Let me see.
Okay, so,
I did a little recon, gathered a little intel.
First thing -- you really shouldn't call them filthy goat herders.
I didn't call them filthy.
And the only reason I called the one guy a goat herder is 'cause he has goats and he herds them.
Yeah. They're farmers.
Anyway, seems their land is valuable as some sort of drug transport to the coast.
So someone paid off Veracruz to force them out.
They fought back, got lucky a few times -- and Veracruz thought they were bigger than they actually were.
Pretty much.
Okay, listen.
Guys, she's got malaria.
Okay, and without the right medicine, she could die soon.
Look, I'm tap-dancing as fast as I can here.
I'm just trying to keep everybody breathing.
Me too, man.
Me too.
The man wants to know why your pants are blue.
The jungle is green.
Please tell the man that
I don't want to talk about it.
So, what's with Beatriz?
She seems to have, uh, anger issues.
It's, uh, kind of par for the course when you see your father shot in front of you.
And she wandered into the Espada Ardiente camp the next day, and they took her in.
So she's, what, the mascot?
Yeah.
Something like that.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
You have a new name in camp.
"La barbilla."
"Barbilla."
What's that again?
Um, "barbarian" or something?
No. "The chin."
The chin.
Doesn't make any sense.
They train every morning.
It's the same thing they do in the army.
I'm pretty sure in the army they fire their guns.
You think that's funny?
Are you laughing at them?
No, I don't think it's funny, kid.
I think it's anything but.
But is is not an army.
They got no training.
Luis there is about 100 years old.
Don't even get me started on the big guy there.
They need weapons!
And I know you can help them!
I saw you back at the clinic, and you made those explosives.
They need more than weapons.
Trust me -- in a real fight, these chumps would get slaughtered.
Aah!
Hey. Just having a conversation here.
Nothing to look at.
Everything's cool.
Now, look, I'm sorry about your dad, okay?
And I'm sure that your flaming sword buddies are very brave.
But believe me -- brave guys bleed just like everybody else.
What do you think?
Uh, the truth?
They need help more than we do.
A-and so what does that mean?
Are we -- are we stuck here?
No, it means I got to figure out a way to call back to my C.O., get him to shut Veracruz down.
All right.
We've been over this.
There isn't a phone for 200 miles from here.
Veracruz has a sat phone.
Yeah, but, wait.
You can't go back to Veracruz.
Well, why not?
I mean, right now he thinks
I've been kidnapped by our new friends there.
I'll just go back and tell him I escaped.
Oh, yeah.
And he's gonna be like, "oh, my
God, it's so good to see you," and hug you and shoot you in the head.
No, I doubt it. He needs me to help him sell the story about the flaming sword.
Should be enough to call out.
Hey.
What if you're wrong?
Well, then, I get shot, and you try your luck with the goat herders.
Try it!
Okay, uh, better get going.
I want to get to Veracruz before he makes camp.
Before you go,
I want to ask you something.
Are you really gonna do this?
Are you really gonna go for help?
Yeah, it's like I told you.
- I'm gonna go back, make a call --
- People say a lot of things.
Now, I just got everybody out of the clinic safe, didn't I?
I mean, what does a guy have to do to get some credibility around here?
I've been in hot spots all over the globe.
And when things first get rough, everyone's a hero.
And then reality sets in, and promises are broken.
And if you let these people down, I want you to know that I will personally find you and kick your teeth in.
Amanda, I'm not gonna let anybody down.
I may get my ass shot off, but...
My teeth are safe.
Before we move on,
Espada Ardiente's leadership consisted of this man,
Louis Mendez, of the Colombian armed forces.
His name was Luis.
And, yeah, that looks like him...
About 100 years ago.
He looks good in uniform.
Did you gather any more intel on their command structure?
They were farmers.
They didn't have command structures. They had sheep.
Why do you think I was going to get some help?
Okay. Fine.
We'll come back to that.
What happened after you left?
Well, I drove back toward Veracruz.
I mean, I knew his team's drill well enough to find a scout or two.
Once I got to the neighborhood,
I ditched the truck,
put on a little
kidnapping makeup...
...And hoofed it
until I ran into a couple
of Veracruz's scouts.
Oh, man. It was horrible.
They were working me over, asking all kinds of things.
How did you escape?
I was lucky.
They only sent a couple guys with me to el baño, and I managed to run off.
We searched for you everywhere.
When the terrorists blew up the clinic, we feared the worst.
It wasn't "the worst," but it was still pretty damn bad.
You know they were setting up to give me the car-battery treatment?
These guys are frickin' monsters!
Yes, they are.
Now you see why we need your help fighting this menace.
100%. I say we track them down and light these bastards up.
Excellent. Good to have you back, Commander Axe.
We need help. Okay?
Asap!
Okay, Commander.
I understand.
But let me ask you this -- how the hell did this happen?!
You're supposed to be down there observing and reporting, not starting some guerilla war!
Well, I observed the sons of bitches trying to kill me and massacre hospital, and I'm reporting it.
All right, look,
I'll make some calls.
But, Axe, if this is some cheap ploy to get yourself pulled out of there...
It's not about me.
Now, you help these people,
I will gladly let you kick my butt at a time and place of your choosing.
But, please, for the love of God -- I got to go.
Axe.
The men are ready.
We should start looking for the terrorists before they have time to move.
Yes, we should. Time for a little payback, am I right?
So, at this point, I was just
trying to run out the clock.
I had to give the guys
from the flaming sword
enough time to get their truck
off the road
and back to their camp.
And I needed
to keep Veracruz's men busy
long enough for help to arrive.
Yep. Pretty sure we're going this way.
But, no.
That's not -- that's not it.
Iperfecto! Iexactamente!
Ah.
What is the delay?
Uh, well, I was just talking to your boys here.
I was telling them that the -- the camp is pretty much up there.
See the tire tracks here?
This is the same tread as their vehicles that they use.
Yes, I can see.
You are an excellent tracker.
You are also an excellent liar.
What the hell are you doing?
I just spoke with
Department Governor Perez.
His men intercepted your call an hour ago.
Ay.
I am hurt you think so little of me.
You honestly thought I would take no precautions?
Hey, come on.
This is just a misunderstanding.
No.
No, I don't think it is a misunderstanding.
I think I understand very well.
Now...
Show me where they are on the map.
You know, why should I?
You're gonna kill me anyway.
I might.
And...I might not.
The question is whether you want to die here, or keep breathing a bit longer and hope you prove useful enough to save.
Show me where their camp is.
If you are wrong...
I'll put a bullet in your brain, and maybe that will help you remember.
Uh, well, come to think of it, that -- that mountain range does look familiar.
So, how does it feel to be saved by filthy goat herders?
Well, I owe you one, kid.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no. Not until you promise not to insult them again.
Say what?
- Promise.
- Oh, for God's sake. Okay, I promise.
They're the greatest part-time farmer army ever!
Can we go?!
Geez!
Aah!
So, Veracruz saw through your plan?
Oh, and it gets better.
Veracruz is looking around, and he's close.
He's gonna find us within 24 hours, tops.
Ok-- okay.
So what am I supposed to do?
Because I got an old house full of sick people -- there's a CIA outpost about 50 miles away.
The pilot who brought me down here told me about it.
I think it's our best bet.
50 miles.
Are you on drugs?
Do they do testing for soldiers?
Because we can't get all of these people 50 yards.
I understand that.
Kid, can I talk to you for a second?
What?
I want to ask you something.
How did you end up with these guys, speaking English like you do?
What do you care?
Well, because we're in a tough spot, and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.
My father was a journalist.
From El Espectador
in Bogotá.
He was in this area, reporting on the situation with the farmers.
That's what got him shot?
Yes.
I knew Luis from the interviews my father did.
I didn't know where else to go a-after my father died.
So Luis brought me to the camp, and he let me stay.
I'm glad he did.
I need your help.
I got to put this little army together.
But there's a problem -- those guys hate me, and I speak Spanish like a third grader.
But they like you, and you speak
English like a champ.
So...
Por favor?
Talk to them.
And if I like what you have to say, I will translate it.
Esteemed gentlemen of the flaming sword...
It's not "flaming" sword!
Oh, God, forget it.
Just talk. Just talk.
I know we didn't get off to a great start.
I made some mistakes.
You made some mistakes.
Then there was the whole goat-herd business.
It's not like it didn't happen.
But that's behind us.
Now, I'm a soldier.
And I've got all the training and a fistful of combat ribbons.
But today -- what?
Stick with me.
Okay.
But today I damn near got my brains blown out.
And the only reason why
I'm still breathing is because of you.
And that made me realize something.
If we're gonna save ourselves...
...And give Veracruz the ass-whipping he so richly deserves...
Was that what I said?
The point is that we need to do it together.
So I'm standing here before you today to ask for your help.
Now, I've got a plan, but it is not gonna fly without you.
So I need to know right now...
...Are you with me?!
Espada Ardiente.
Espada Ardiente!
Okay, now let's get training,
'cause, man, we got to get organized.
Wait right there. Stop.
You're saying that you were training the terrorist group?
Did you train them?
Yes or no?
Did you work with this man,
Louis Mendez?
Yeah, look, Luis was one of the guys. He was on --
He was the senior operative in the Colombian military in the 1980s until he disappeared, presumably, to start this group!
And now you're giving this man military secrets and training?
All I can say, sir, is the only secrets I gave away were the secrets of the Analee High School
J.V. football squad.
Okay, guys.
Listen up and listen good.
These are the plans for battle.
This first one here is called the nickel defense.
If things get rough...
...The scouts fall back.
This last one is called the prevent defense.
Why is that?
They've all fallen back.
What the hell's their problem?
All of these plans are for retreating!
The men want to know what's the plan for an attack!
No, they don't need to know that one.
See, we're just trying to keep them in the game. Mondo.
You're killing me.
Okay, I have a plan for attack.
It's called the "zone blitz."
And it's all about disguise.
Let's hear you say it.
All together.
"Zone blitz!"
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!
Now let's just hope to God you never have to say those words again.
Next day, we moved out
with the patients in one truck,
and the flaming sword guys
packed in the others.
It was only 50 miles, but when
the whole country is a mountain,
miles are kind of
like dog years --
every one more like seven.
And, of course,
there's the worst part
of driving to a CIA outpost --
it's not gonna be on the map.
Quick update --
I didn't run away.
I went to get help, just like I said.
Yes, and you almost got yourself killed.
That should count double, then.
Uh, why would it count double?
It only counts double if you actually come back with some help.
If you nearly die a senseless death, that counts as, like, half.
Okay. Half.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Okay, so, tell me something.
Do-gooder...
Food-aid worker...
I mean, why so cynical?
If you're asking that, you probably haven't spent a whole lot of time around aid workers.
Okay.
Well, I mean, you get into this because you want to make the world a better place, and it turns out that there's a lot of people who want to make it a worse place.
And we're outnumbered.
By a lot.
By soldiers, you mean?
Not just soldiers.
But usually, when there are people are going hungry, there's some guy with a gun making it happen.
Speaking of hunger, you haven't been eating.
Why is that?
These guys need it more than me.
Believe me.
I figure it this way -- if we make it,
I got a head start on the 10 pounds I want to lose, and if we don't, well, dead guys don't get hungry.
You're not like the other soldiers I've met,
Commander Axe.
I'll give you that.
Call me Sam.
Sam it is.
I know that you want me to kiss you right now.
- And, believe me, I would love to.
- What?
But I'm just saying, it's a bad time, is all.
- No, no.
- Any other time, I'd be all over it.
Oh. No comprende.
Seriously.
I was just making conversation here.
That's what that was.
Yeah, just drive.
For the record,
she wanted me to kiss her.
So, anyway, we keep going.
So, as we're getting
to the main roads
out of the mountains,
I'm getting that itchy feeling,
an itchy feeling
that just keeps getting worse.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Hey.
Uh, okay.
This is not good.
No, no.
This is just rain.
Okay? It doesn't take much to start a rock slide.
You always see fallen rocks and trees in the road.
Yeah, well, I don't see a lot of trees or rocks.
I just see this tree here right in the middle of a hard-to-defend position.
- A hard-to-def--
- Yeah.
What do you propose we do?
Back those trucks up and proceed with caution.
Oscar can clear it.
Hold on a second, okay?
I don't think that thing fell by itself.
The sooner we cut the tree, the sooner we can go.
It's fine. It's fine.
So, while they're clearing
this tree from the road,
I'm getting a real bad feeling,
one of those "too quiet,
I don't like this place,
something weird is going on"
feelings.
You, uh...
You might want to stay here.
Now, I know, of course,
that there's a fine line
between caution and paranoia.
People tell you about
gut feelings all the time.
But if you follow
every gut feeling,
you never get anything done.
Still, sometimes something
feels funny for a reason.
They know we're here.
What?
They know we're here!
Prevent defense!
Aah!
No!
Aah!
Luis!
- Hey, help me with something.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
Look, those guys are just scouts, okay?
They're trying to keep us here until reinforcements show up.
So we got to block that switchback down there before -- well, before that.
Yeah, here they are, right on time. Come on.
Push! Push!
Push now! Ivamonos!
Aah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Very groovy! Come on, guys!
Okay, go, go, go.
We got to go. Got to go.
Now listen everybody.
We got lucky back there.
Those guys got excited, and they made a lot of mistakes, but it's not gonna happen again.
So we got to move, and we got to move fast.
Now, if this map is not garbage, we are close to a CIA outpost.
We can get there by nightfall if we hurry.
Understand, señor?
All right, let's go.
Can we talk?
Ah, listen, you know, about before, it's --
Oh, you're talking about --
No, I'm not talking about that, actually.
If you want to embarrass yourself with your fantasies, knock yourself out.
What I want to know is...
Once we get there, what happens?
Well, maybe you haven't been paying attention.
We get there, we get help.
Oh, so it's as simple as that.
Who said it was gonna be simple?
So, we used
what head start we had,
but it was pretty slowgoing.
In those mountains,
the good roads are bad,
and the bad roads, well,
they aren't really even roads.
This is ridiculous.
I can't even tell which way north is anymore.
You're sure that it's here?
- Yeah, it's around here somewhere, yeah.
- Really?
Because there's nothing on this map that says -- we are looking for a secret intelligence facility.
They don't put them on maps.
That's how you know they're secret.
Right, right, right, right, right.
But isn't it possible that this guy that told you about it is wrong?
- Because honestly --
- Okay, there it is. Right there.
Now, you want to check it out, or should we just chalk this up to my imagination and go home?
But do -- do we just knock, or is...?
Now you want to kiss me.
This isn't some kind of joke, is it?
I don't joke about mass murder.
It's kind of a touchy subject with me.
So, guys, what can we do, here?
You got any weapons?
We got a couple .45s and a -- you know, and, like, a box of ammo.
Other than that, we've got, like, a lot of computers.
We got maps.
DVDs. Some good movies.
We're an observation outpost.
Observing.
Yeah, doing communications support and...
Not wearing night goggles going on raids.
We're not a fortress.
Okay, what about all the antennas on the roof? Can you call out?
Yeah, yeah.
We can do that.
Well, get on it, then.
We need help right now.
What you got, medicine-wise?
Yeah, we'd call that
"not much."
Okay, hold on, now.
It's better than nothing.
I told you, man.
It's just us out here.
I mean, its me, Gabe, and the donkey.
Donkey?
The burro.
We take her into town for supplies and water, but, you know, the roads around here...
Yeah, tell me about it.
This expired, like, two years ago.
What's up?
I called in to the military base in Santa Marta.
And?
Are they sending anybody?
They said they need to see you, in person, and talk to them.
They said the base chief needs to meet with you.
I guess there's some confusion about your, uh, situation.
Okay, well, how the hell am I supposed to get to Santa Marta -- on the burro?
On the chopper.
It's out back.
The chopper.
Why didn't you say so?
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
So, you really have to go?
You can't just call them?
No, they got reports that I was kidnapped, that I was killed, that I've gone rogue.
So I-I got to go out there and drag them back myself.
Who will you bring?
Well, the Colombian military's been working with the U.S. on some anti-drug runs, so they got attack copters, troops.
Veracruz will find this place soon.
Yeah. Probably sooner rather than later.
That's why we got to hustle.
Okay. Let come.
That is out of the question.
We're overweight as it is.
We should go.
Listen, kid.
I'm coming back, okay?
I'm not gonna let you guys down.
Okay, so, how well do you know these Colombian military folks?
I've done some joint operations with them.
Well, 'cause I was thinking if they can run this up the ladder, it'd be good to get some embassy involvement, maybe arrange visas for some of these folks.
We can call Washington.
There's a refugee program we might be able to get them into.
Sounds good.
Here we go.
- Hey, guys, how long is this gonna take?
- Hard to say.
As soon as we land, we'll find the foreign affairs officer, get the ball rolling on paperwork.
Paperwork?
Yeah, for going back.
You know the drill -- authorization reports...
...Duty orders.
...Debriefing reports.
Hang on a second.
You guys didn't mention anything about paperwork when we were down on the ground.
What are you talking about?
It's protocol, man.
The CIA's not gonna send out a military tactical team without checking it out.
Why they hell didn't you mention that back there?
And, uh, what, cause a riot?
Hey, we got rules to follow, like anybody else, pal.
Those rules are also pretty clear -- when a facility's been compromised, you take the classified material and bug out without causing an international incident.
Keyword there would be "without."
I thought you were on board with all this, especially with all that embassy talk.
Visas.
Guys, you promised those people down there.
- I promised those people.
- Grow up, man.
No way we could have ever given them anything near what you promised them.
Not unless U.S. personnel were under direct attack.
There's a point
in a soldier's life
where he's got to decide
whether he's gonna follow
the letter or the spirit
of his orders.
So you can't do anything unless Americans are under direct attack, right?
That's right.
What about you guys?
Do you count?
Land the chopper. Now.
You held two
CIA officers hostage on behalf of a suspected terrorist group?
That's treason.
Do you think I wanted to?
Do you think
I had a choice?
Sir, we were not gonna get help unless those guys told the brass that they were under attack.
I did what I had to do.
I see.
You had to kidnap them.
"Kidnap." Get out of here.
I was just helping them do the right thing.
Helping them.
With a .45-caliber pistol?
Well, you know what they say, sir.
Guns don't help people.
People help people.
You are in a world of hurt, soldier.
Commander Axe, as we reconvene this inquiry,
I am obliged to ask you if you would like us to assign you a military lawyer.
- A lawyer?
- I'd advise it.
I thought I was just making a report here.
Oh, we've gone beyond that,
Commander.
Now, we've detained and questioned a few of the people that were involved in your little adventure, and there's quite a case building against you.
Wait, wait.
You're rounding people up?
Yes, the farmers, the doctor,
Amanda Maples.
Those are my friends, sir.
They didn't do anything wrong.
It's standard operating procedure, Commander.
"Standard operating procedure."
Why don't you bite me?
You're speaking to a superior officer!
You're speaking to a superior officer!
Stand down, Commander!
Now, you've underestimated the sheer size of this fiasco.
And by all accounts, you are standing in the middle of it, dead center.
So, last chance -- do you want to exercise your right to legal counsel?
I'm good.
You know what these proceedings could result in.
Yeah, me getting thrown into a hole for the rest of my life?
Yeah, I got it.
I also know that a lawyer is not gonna make a damn bit of difference.
Now, sir, you want to hang this mess around my neck, you go for it, but leave my friends alone.
You're in no position to negotiate, Commander Axe.
Now I want to hear about what happened after you drew your weapon on two CIA field agents.
All right. Fine.
After my "conversation" with the CIA boys, we went back to the outpost.
And let me tell you something, sir -- everybody was real glad to see me.
- Change of plans.
- That was quick.
You do know that the town is the other way?
I thought you were going to get help.
- Yeah, there was a little hitch.
- What kind of a hitch?
Turns out our CIA buddies were not such good buddies after all.
They were planning on leaving everybody to the wolves.
I disagreed with that plan.
What -- and they are...?
Tied up in the helicopter.
Oh, that is not good.
Okay, so, um, now what are we supposed to do?
Aren't you the one who said that we were going to get slaughtered?
That's not gonna happen.
So you have a plan?
Uh, no, but I know where to start.
Make the call.
I'm not calling in.
Do it.
You'll thank me later.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we won't thank you.
Yeah, you will. Because Veracruz is following our trail here.
And when he does, he's gonna wipe this place off the face of the earth, and you two yahoos with it.
What do you want?
I want you to call your CIA buddies, tell them to get the
Colombian military out here, the national police -- the works, everything they got.
You're gonna burn for this.
Yeah, but that's not the question.
The question is whether you're gonna make that call...
Or if I'm gonna have to make you make the call.
Yeah, it's Gabriel Manaro out at station 412.
We got a situation here.
Some kind of rogue military force is attacking our position.
Just helping you sell it.
Yeah, yeah, that's -- we're firing back at them.
We need supp-- be more convincing.
Jesus! No.
No, I'm not talking to you.
We need help!
We need support now!
Send it! Send the help!
Military support! Now!
Help us!
I am at station 4-1-2!
Yes! Yes! Just hurry!
They'll have a team here in three hours.
Three hours?
Veracruz is just up the road.
He's gonna be all over us in three hours.
Yeah, well, they're coming from over the mountains.
That's what it takes, dude!
That's the fastest they can get here. It's not magic.
What's going on?
Who's shooting?
- That was me just making a point.
- Okay, what?
Well, I got good news and bad news.
Good news is, help is on the way.
Bad news is, we're gonna have to hold out until it gets here.
Okay, señors.
Hey, look what I made.
That's a hell of a bomb.
Wow. You got a gift.
Well, you know, I've been doing field medicine for a long time.
You learn to improvise.
Yeah, well, I've known a lot of field medics, but they don't have your chops with explosives.
- Good work.
- Thank you.
Where's the kid?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
What?
You know, this, um -- this fight with Veracruz, it's gonna be rough.
We got to hold them off for a long time.
So I was thinking it would be a good idea if you just stay back here and watch the CIA guys.
Stay here?
I'm fighting with the others.
Okay, okay.
Just hear me out here.
Now, you're still young, and you've done more in this fight than any kid should ever have to.
Those men killed my father.
I think it's safe to say if your dad was here, he wouldn't want you catching a bullet.
I mean, think about it.
What would he say?
I don't know.
He's not here.
He would say a kid as tough and as smart as you is gonna have a big future.
He'd want you to grow up and see it, wouldn't he?
He would want me to stay.
So you'll stay?
No.
But thanks anyways.
You remind me of my father.
And I didn't listen to him, either.
Kids these days.
All right, mount up!
We did a little recon
when we got out to the road
and we got some more bad news.
Veracruz's buddy Perez
showed up,
and he brought more guys
with him --
a lot more guys,
with a lot more guns.
Still, there wasn't much to do
but stick with the plan.
We had our little explosive
device cobbled together
from some C-4 charges
the CIA guys had
in case they needed to blow up
their computers in a hurry.
The way I figured it,
if we could plant it
at the right spot,
we could block the road
with a couple thousand pounds
of burning truck wreckage
then pin Veracruz down
for a while.
You should probably go.
No. No. Do it.
That is, assuming we didn't
blow ourselves up first.
Okay. Let's go.
I know we were not expecting the reinforcements.
And the odds are, um, kind of against us.
But what the hell?
You're the flaming sword, right?
Now, look, they got to come from down there.
When that bomb blows, it's gonna be our job to slow them down.
'Cause if they get through here -- pbht! --
We are sitting ducks.
Pbht!
Sitting ducks?
It's an expression.
It's like ducks in a pond, ducks in a row. It's easy to --
How bad is this?
Oh, well, maybe we had a solid chance before that troop transport showed up.
But now...
And how long do we have to hold them?
Help comes in about two hours.
Veracruz and his men, give or take 90 minutes, so I think we got to hold out for about a half-hour.
Can we do that?
Well, with the terrain on our side, maybe.
But it's gonna be a long half-hour.
But, hey, it could be worse, right?
It could be raining.
Let's do this.
Now, at this point, we didn't
have a whole lot going for us.
On our side,
we had the high ground
and the element of surprise.
On their side,
they had manpower,
equipment, body armor,
superior weaponry,
radio communications, and
pretty much everything else.
Is he on it, or is he not on?
He's not on it.
If he was on it, it would --
Luis, now!
Ha! Flaming sword!
Damn right.
Flaming sword! Attack!
Zone blitz!
Zone blitz!
Good shot, Mondo.
The men are running out of ammunition.
Tell them to act like they're shooting.
Just keep looking mean, pretend like they have ammunition.
What?!
Just do it!
I pulled out every trick
in the book.
But the thing is,
at the end of the day,
there's just no good substitute
for bullets.
No!
Okay, uh, I don't think they're buying it.
All right, look, game over.
Tell them to fall back to the trucks.
Old man! Let's go!
No.
Wait.
W-what is he doing?
He's covering us.
Let's go. Let's go.
Espada Ardiente!
I got to go back.
Ben.
I got one more charge, just in case.
We got to get him.
Aren't you full of surprises.
Oh, Jesus.
He's dead.
Are you okay?
No! I'm shot!
That's right.
Stupid question. Okay.
Let's do it.
Get him inside.
Damn it.
Where the hell are they?
Beatriz, they're coming.
Let's get inside.
Get off me!
Don't! Please, kid. I'm begging you.
They killed Luis, and I'm going to fight them!
Look, I know that he meant a lot to you, okay?
But he was a soldier.
He was protecting you.
Don't make his death meaningless by standing out here and getting yourself killed.
Please, if you won't go inside for me, at least do it for the old goat herder.
Where the hell are they?
Call 'em again.
How much longer?
'Ca-- 'cause we're running out of time up here.
It's -- the situation is getting urgent --
Yeah, is this the station chief?
I got to know how much longer this is gonna take, and your numbnuts officer here can't tell me.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Who is this?!
Deputy assistant intelligence director Chuck Finley.
That's who.
I'm down from NSA headquarters here doing a random sigint check, and I ran into this little disaster area of yours.
Now, where are these troops?
They're 10 minutes away, sir.
10 minutes?
This thing will be over in 5.
Get on it.
Chuck Finley?
Yeah. Made a lot of money betting on him back in the day.
I'm thinking it's a lucky name.
I guess we'll find out.
Between the flipped truck
and the firefight,
we bought ourselves some time.
But it wasn't too long before
Veracruz was in position,
and we were
about to get creamed.
Keep everybody inside.
When the shooting starts, make sure they're away from the windows and down low, okay?
I'm going out there.
You're what?
I got to buy us some more time.
Sam, if you go out there,
Veracruz will kill you.
Yeah. Maybe.
But if I manage to die slowly, that'll put you guys just a little closer to getting out of here.
No, no, no. You're at least taking your gun.
If he sees that I have a gun, he's gonna shoot me on sight.
Don't worry about it.
I got an idea.
No, no. Wait.
I mean, they -- you can't -- ju-- if you just -- stay alive.
I'll do my best.
Still, you know, if we were gonna kiss, we should probably do it now just in case.
I don't want to...
That is a lot better than a kick in the teeth.
Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, guys, we need to talk.
What is there to talk about,
Commander Axe?
Oh, we got a lot to talk about.
I'm here to negotiate the terms of your surrender.
Our surrender?
Is that supposed to be funny?
How long before they get here?
I don't know. Soon.
They better get here soon.
Man, you just love doing that, don't you?
How many are there inside?
Believe me, y-you don't know what you're up against.
Yes, "Espada Ardiente."
We know.
No. No.
It's the flaming sword.
Believe me, you don't want to mess with them.
And why is that?
'Cause I've fought all over --
Afghanistan, the Balkans,
Southeast Asia.
I've never seen guys like this.
I count a dozen men with old rifle-- farmers, by the look of them.
Yeah? You think that's all we got?
Then what am I doing here?
I'm a commander in the Navy S.E.A.L.S.
You think
I'm gonna be wasting time with a bunch of smelly farmers -- smelly, stinking, unwashed farmers?
No, no.
You boys have made a grave miscalculation.
That's why I'm here with my one-time-only, not-to-be-repeated offer -- unconditional surrender right now, and I'll let you walk away.
You're bluffing.
What is he doing?
No!
Ohh.
All right, all right.
Because I am feeling...
Generous and, uh, merciful...
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Surrender right now.
Okay? I'm serious.
What is he doing?!
I'm telling you guys, you're just making it worse on yourself.
Ugh, we should finish him.
Wait!
Let's see this flaming sword, shall we?
I'm telling you guys, you're gonna regret it.
Aah!
I've heard the old saying
about soldiers
praying in foxholes.
It's a natural response
when your friends are dying
and everything you care about
is about to get destroyed.
But I got to say,
in my experience,
prayer is pretty iffy
as a battle plan.
Aah!
But I'll also say this --
when you need a miracle,
there's nothing like it.
Hey, guys.
Say hello to my friends.
I call them the newest members of the flaming sword, you crooked son of a bitch.
Sam -- Sam Axe.
The good guys -- it's the good guy-- uh, Los buenos.
Los buenos.
So, you guys ready to surrender now?
Aah!
Man, that felt good.
Sam Axe!
So, you gonna make it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
Well, I got to say, if you ever reconsider the whole medical thing, you'd make a hell of a soldier.
Okay.
All right, I will -- I will, uh -- I'll keep that in mind.
Listen, Sam...
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
Back at you, doc.
All right.
Help this man up.
So, what happens now?
Well, it's gonna take a while to sort this all out.
My guess is that Veracruz and Perez are gonna be going off the grid for their foreseeable lifetimes.
No, I mean, what about you?
Oh, I'm probably gonna get spend some quality time at the nearest covert military facility.
Well, uh, good luck.
Thanks.
And, uh...
Thanks for the kiss, huh?
I mean, I know you probably only did it
'cause you thought
I was gonna die, but --
Oh, my God.
Commander Axe...
You need to come with us.
Señor Axe...
And here I am.
That's quite a story,
Commander Axe.
Thanks.
How does it end, sir?
There's only one way it could end -- a court martial.
Well, sir, there is actually one more part of the story that you should probably hear.
I mean, I was saving it in case you decided to be a stand-up guy about all this, but I guess that's not gonna happen.
What are you talking about?
Do you remember the little chat
I had with Beatriz after Luis died?
Well, there's something I left out.
He was protecting you.
Don't make his death meaningless by staying outside and getting yourself killed.
It's my fault!
It's my fault -- all of this.
Now, the first half
of the discussion
went just like I told you.
It was in the second half,
though,
where things got
really interesting.
Kid, don't say that.
This has nothing to do with you.
The flaming sword -- they knew what they were getting into.
There's no flaming sword!
What the hell are you talking about?
My father interviewed Luis for the newspaper, and I went with him, so I knew all his story -- that he was in the army and he went away to be a farmer.
After my father was killed,
I went back to Luis.
I gave him the name of "Espada Ardiente," and I convinced him to fight!
Wait a minute.
So all of this was your idea?
Everything.
I should die here.
Now, look, kid...
This is not over, not by a long shot.
Now, we're gonna get through this.
And I've been around long enough to know when this is all over, there's gonna be hell to pay.
You want something to live for?
You want to help your friends?
'Cause I got a job for you.
You any good with a camera?
So, I figured if anybody could get away clean after that little skirmish, it was a kid.
And a kid with connections at the largest newspaper in Colombia?
Well, that could be mighty handy.
I had her grab one of the
cameras from the CIA outpost
and take pictures --
a lot of them --
of everyone and everything...
...Then get herself
down to Bogotá,
and go back to her dad's
old newspaper...
Beatriz!
...And once she got there,
to talk to someone she trusted
about putting together
a couple of stories.
Now, one of these stories should be in today's paper.
In fact, sir, isn't there a piece on the front page today about Luis, talking about how he died under mysterious circumstances?
There was. Yes.
Oh, how interesting.
Why don't we all take a break?
Yes, sir.
You don't really think that anyone's gonna take this girl's word over that of the United States military?
Well, the girl did have extensive access to a covert
CIA outpost, sir.
I mean, imagine what she saw and took pictures of.
Tell me, what happens when spies who are under official cover get their pictures in the paper?
I mean, that can't be good, right?
You wouldn't dare.
This is the sort of thing that you don't want revealed to the world, Admiral, and it's gonna be -- things that could end a guy's military career, and I'm not talking about mine.
What do you want?
Thanks for asking.
First, you let my friends go.
Then you rebuild the clinic.
The flaming sword guys go back to their goats,
I get an honorable discharge, and we keep our mouths shut about this forever.
In the words of my buddy
Mike Westen,
"this is the kind of secret that stays a secret."
That's blackmail.
No. Actually, sir, I believe this form of extortion is known as "graymail."
It's much nicer than blackmail.
I believe we're done here, sir.

Welcome to Miami,
Mr. Axe.
Thank you.

Sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Just don't think about it.
Yeah.
I just hate hospitals.
- Dang it.
- What?
I left my book at the house.
You know, in case we have to wait.
Shoot! Um...
I'll look in my purse.
You rock.
You left it on the table.
Thank you.
Promise me you're not gonna leave, all right?
You're not gonna take off when they put me under.
I promise.
I would never leave.
Woman: Isn't that always the way it works?
Man: You'd think you see somebody with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.
I can at least get out.
Let me just get the crutch.
Wait, wait.
- I can just stand.
- Come on.
The brace.
You're awesome.
- I love you. Be careful.
- Love you. Thank you.
- I'll be right up.
- All right.
Woman #2: What's this I hear about you taking the morning off?
Woman: Kevin has orthopedic surgery today.
Aww! You're such a good girlfriend.
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.
He's amazing.
I think the bank could go one day without me.
You don't mind covering, right?
Of course.
Of course.
So when do I get to meet him?
- I don't know.
- It's been fours months.
- I'm back. I wanna meet him.
- I know.
I just have never been in a relationship before where it's actually going well.
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?
We're shutting down for renovations on Saturday.
Most of our patients have already been moved to County West.
- Oh.
- Go through those doors and take the elevator up.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Tell him we'll give him an extra basis point.
If he's worried about the rates and us not being competitive, tell him to just look at our rates.
Listen, Craig's been on this case.
Just have him deal with it.
If you have any questions, call Craig.
Okay, bye.
Hi.
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?
No, but I did finally speak with Christine, who wants us all to grab a pizza this weekend.
Her words.
All of us.
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.
That's a biggie.
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you're sure you're okay with this whole introduction thing to your friends?
That's a big step.
No.
Every time I introduce her to anybody, it's sort of bad luck.
Well, don't you worry.
Because you are not gonna lose me.
Ever.
"Social Security number"?
I've been having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh. Thank you.
So you must be
Kevin Peterson.
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment so I just wanna check some things out.
Okay.
- It's all done.
- Thank you.
Does your wife mind waiting outside?
Oh, well, we're not married.
I don't mind.
Do you have a place
I could grab a coffee?
We have a cafeteria attached to the lobby downstairs.
Perfect. Thank you.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Cross my heart, promise.
Okay.
You take care of him.
Oh, how long will it be?
- About an hour.
- An hour? Really?
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.
Thank you.
See you in an hour.
Just tell him that he has to sign the request form in person.
Yeah, he has to come in.
He already knows that.
Just do it.
I'll tell him if I have to.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let him know I'll call him back this afternoon.
I'll call you back, bye.
- Let me please.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
There's a garbage...
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.
Oh, thanks a lot.
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You want some company?
- Sure.
Well, okay.
So what are you-
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that, but yes.
My wife, she has breast cancer, and well, she's up in chemo.
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.
What about you? You're not here for the coffee, right?
I'm just here for the day.
My boyfriend's having orthopedic surgery.
He tore his A.C.L. hiking and flared up an old football injury.
He hurt himself, huh?
Yep. Keep telling him to take it easy.
You don't like hospitals, do you?
Does anybody like hospitals?
Except for the doctors and nurses?
I've been doing this every week for six months.
And I can't wait till they shut this place down.
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.
Wow, look at you go.
It's my job.
MIT said that 90% of people who use smartphones feel more stress.
Only 90%?
I mean, look at you. You're sitting in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend, and you're working.
What happened to the days where you could say,
"I'm out of the office," you know?
Well, sir, to the good old days.
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.
Kevin.
Man over P.A.: Monica Hernandez, your party is ready in post-op.
Jeanette Stevens,
Mary Turner, your parties are ready.
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.
Hi. My boyfriend was having surgery, and I just want to see how much longer it's going to be.
Certainly.
What was his name?
Peterson- Kevin Peterson.
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?
P-e-t-e-r...
- s-o-n. Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."
I'm not showing anyone in our system with that name.
Okay, well, he's definitely having surgery.
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopedics.
Do you happen to remember the room number?
Yeah, it was right down the hall, actually. This floor.
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.
Harding.
Dr. Harding.
Dr. Harding's off today.
I'm sorry.
There's no one in our system with the name
Kevin Peterson.
Well...
Are you sure it could have been in this hospital?
Perhaps it was in another hospital.
We've stopped doing outpatient procedures at this time.
Okay, I was here.
We drove together.
During pre-op,
I was in the room with him.
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
No, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.
Okay. Maybe orthopedics she's in.
Are you sure that he just didn't leave without you?
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.
Okay? I just wanna know where my boyfriend is.
Can you please help me find him? Thanks.
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.
This is ridiculous.
Would you like me to page him for you?
Thank you.
That would be great.
Kevin Peterson, can you please dial 9 and come to the courtesy phone?
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9.
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9 at the courtesy phone.
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.
Sweetheart.
Ma'am, you cannot use your cell phone.
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.
I have this nurse that's driving me absolutely crazy.
I'm at the nurses' station on the floor that had a room-
714 was on the last place I saw you.
Right now it is- it's definitely been over an hour.
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours, and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.
The second you get this message, okay, you call me.
Okay, baby.
You call me, okay?
Love you. I love you.
Hi, we met this morning.
You told me where to check in for outpatient surgery.
Kevin Peterson is a patient here.
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.
- You were by yourself.
- I was.
I dropped him off in the parking structure, okay.
I don't make mix-ups, and my computer is giving me the correct information.
And there is no
Kevin Peterson.
Perhaps it's new information, or something's changed.
I'm looking at my computer printout and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.
I heard you. Okay.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?
Yes, please. I'm looking for someone who's missing.
- Missing
- He's 35,
6'1", dark hair, dark eyes.
I haven't seen anybody by that description. I'm sorry.
He's wearing a brace on his left leg.
Are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Holloway in the lobby.
Yeah, I've got a young woman who's looking for an unidentified male.
Hi, I'm looking for a patient that's in recovery named Kevin Peterson.
Never heard of him.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me. Can I help you?
Hi, yes, I am looking for Kevin Peterson,
Dr. Harding's patient.
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am, but I need you to leave the restricted area.
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.
This is recovery.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now. I'm very sorry.
Okay.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.
Look, ma'am, I really need you to get out of this area.
Security, can you take her away, please?
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.
Can you please escort me to Dr. Harding instead?
Yes. You have to get out of here.
It's a restricted area.
This is her.
And this is Miss Markham, our hospital administrator.
- Thank you. Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?
I'm Mary Walsh. My boyfriend had surgery here this morning.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one who's checked into this hospital by the name of Kevin Peterson.
Okay, well, he had orthopedic surgery-
A.C.L.- this morning.
His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Evidently, neither one of them are in your system.
And no one's in his room.
Okay, well, obviously there's been some kind of mistake.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.
What time this morning was it that you and your boyfriend arrived?
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.
Okay, and you're the one
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.
Okay.
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.
Wait, stop.
All right, these numbers don't-
These times don't coincide.
Keep fast-forwarding, please.
We weren't even out of bed yet.
Okay, keep going.
Okay, right here.
We were already here.
Back it up, please.
Okay, now... rewind it just a hair.
Wait, wait.
Wait, did you see that?
Turn it back.
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.
Good.
Keep playing, please.
Pause! That's him.
Right there.
That's him.
He's wearing the green and gray striped shirt.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine on closed-circuit cameras.
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him. He's right there.
Markham: Miss Walsh.
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?
He may not be in your computer, but he's right on your security camera.
Do you have a copy of his hospital appointment record?
No, it was on him.
Oh God.
It might be in his computer bag in the car.
I will have my team look for him,
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm gonna go call somebody who can actually help me out here.
I just didn't think there was anything conclusive on that.
Do what you can, but...
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Man: Breathe in...
...out, in... out.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.
You still taking the medication?
Every day.
- What about work?
- What about it?
I don't know, Rich.
Something like this takes time.
You don't wanna rush it.
Heaven forbid.
- I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.
But I really need you to take it easy, man.
Whatever you say, Doc.
All right.
See you on Thursday?
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.
- Franklin here.
- Woman: This is dispatch.
We've got reports of a missing person at County Memorial.
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
What floor?
Mary: When I arrived, he wasn't in his room.
So I went down to the waiting room and waited there for a good couple of hours.
Started getting increasingly concerned and went back to his floor and spoke with the head nurse and learned for the first time that he was not in the computer system.
We have looked. No one by the name of Kevin Peterson was scheduled for anything today, not even a check-up.
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
We don't have anyone on staff by that name,
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding. scheduled with is on vacation.
Look, if you could just access Kevin's insurance records.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Why?
The insurance company will only release information to the policyholder's spouse.
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.
I'm sorry. The hospital can't release any information to a non-family member without a court order.
Detective...
I'm getting really really worried that something bad's happened to him.
Can you please help me?
Okay, first of all,
I can't file a report for 24 hours.
24 hours?
I'll be honest with you,
Miss Walsh, most of the time we get a call saying a spouse or boyfriend or whatever is missing, usually they just up and left.
Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend might have walked out on you?
I could see how you two would think that, but that's just not him, no.
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.
Markham: That's not a lot of time to get to know someone.
Maybe your relationship isn't what you thought it was.
No, I trust him.
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?
Maybe, wait.
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.
Yeah, right here.
Can you make anything out?
Markham:
No.
Well, it's not the best picture.
It's something.
How about a description?
He's 6'0", maybe 6'1".
Around 190.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
He was wearing a green and gray shirt today and shorts because he has on a huge leg brace.
And he was using a crutch.
Shirt was long-sleeved.
Security has their people searching the entire hospital and no one has seen anyone matching that description.
I'll see what I can find.
In the meantime,
I need you to sit right here.
I feel very awkward just not doing anything and staying here.
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation
I can get from you, the faster this can go for everyone.
All right? Okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
If you hear anything, give me a call.
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Have you seen a male Caucasian, mid 30s, dark hair, wearing dark shorts, green sweatshirt?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- No.
- Okay, thank you.
Could you tell me where the outpatient surgery is?
Yeah, if you just keep going straight down the hall you'll run right into it.
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice there are no patients on this level.
Yeah, everyone's been moved to another facility.
They are shutting this entire hospital down
Saturday for renovation.
You mean no one has been in any of these rooms today?
No. Are you looking for someone?
I'm fine, thanks.
You wouldn't happen to know of a nurse named Amanda, would you?
Amanda? No.
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
Franklin: Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a guy, mid 30s, 6' tall-
Kevin Peterson.
He's wearing a striped hoodie.
You wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- Woman: No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.
I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman: No.
Woman: Look, I just clock in and I clock out.
You do not recall hearing the name
Kevin Peterson today? Is that right?
Woman: No.
Mary: Chris, I'm in the security room at the hospital.
I took Kevin in and he's missing.
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.
No, he is missing.
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
What are you talking about?
Saw him in pre-op. Boom, went back to the room, gone.
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.
Okay, sweetie, you know, you just met Kevin.
Maybe...
He didn't leave me, honey.
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.
I know we've only been together for four months, but I have been waiting for him my whole entire life.
And I'm not gonna let someone take him away from me.
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.
I think I hear somebody coming.
Everybody's acting really strange.
There's something real off here.
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.
So please, please, just keep checking in.
If I don't answer, come find me, okay?
I'm having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh. Thank you.
- So what's going on?
- What's going on? Well, Miss Walsh,
Detective Franklin is out looking for your boyfriend.
It's been over an hour.
It's a big hospital.
You know, I think
I'm gonna look myself.
Listen, I can't have you doing that.
I can't have you walking around the hallway scaring other patients.
Do you understand?
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors and not a single person has seen him.
Okay, um...
Then please,
I have to file a report.
I told you he needs to be missing for 24 hours.
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.
Please, file a report.
What does Kevin do for a living?
He's in insurance.
Well, at least he's covered.
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.
But I did, while you were gone, jot this down for you.
Wait, you just happened to remember it?
I'd appreciate it if you ran it.
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, is there anybody else I could talk to?
Anybody who knew he'd be here today?
- What about family?
- Ooh! His mother.
She lives in Florida, but he was gonna put her number into my phone in case of an emergency.
I just totally forgot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Wait.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
- There is no new number.
- No luck.
He must have input a wrong digit.
He's always been bad electronically.
Shoot!
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence that this is real, that he actually exists, don't you?
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-
I have a prescription for that, so...
Holloway: That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
Please hand that to me.
I'll be right back,
Mr. Holloway.
Where are you going?
May I have my medication back, please?
Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something.
All right, I'll run the Social. I'll be back.
You got it.
Come on.
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.
Come on.
Your brace.
Do you want your bag?
No, just leave it in the back. That's fine.
Thank God.
Where is it?
Okay, wanna come upstairs now?
Shoot!
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.
Shoot!
Wanna come upstairs now?
- It's not here.
- What's not here?
His bag. It has his computer in it, all of his information- everything.
Somebody had to have gotten into the car.
What makes you think that?
Because the bag was here this morning. Now it's not.
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.
Now.
I have the only set of keys.
Now.
We're in the middle of a huge transition.
I've got patients to move, equipment to transport.
Every minute that I or my security team spends chasing phantoms on surveillance cameras or finding you trespassing in a restricted area is one less minute we're able to do our jobs.
Every minute you don't spending looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.
Mary, I checked seven floors of this building.
I checked with every nurse's station.
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.
What about the wing that's being renovated?
Franklin: Yes.
- And?
- And no one reported seeing your boyfriend.
No one can even confirm that he was in this hospital.
Just what do you suppose happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Holloway: Look, there are 23 exits in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.
Eight are alarmed and the rest are carefully monitored by cameras.
If anyone left this building under any manner of duress we would know about it.
Well, obviously, you're not looking hard enough.
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?
Okay, thank you.
What did they say?
We ran the Social Security number you gave me.
Good, okay, what's the next step?
It belongs to a 50-year-old
African-American woman.
Well, that's obviously a mistake.
Not ours.
I ran the number you gave us.
No, that's impossible.
Okay, run them again, please?
Dr. Bensley, thank you for joining us.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
Markham: Dr. Bensley is our hospital psychiatrist.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Did you get the prescription
I sent over?
I did. Quite a potent dosage, Mary.
Would you mind coming with me for a moment?
Yes, actually, I would.
It doesn't need to be voluntary, Miss Walsh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Right this way, please.
This way.
- Okay.
- Come on.
So you've been treated for psychiatric issues before, hmm, Mary?
Answer the question,
Miss Walsh.
I...
I checked myself in when I was 22.
I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.
I was there for three days.
That's it.
I don't see how that's relevant.
What are you doing on antidepressants?
Oh, you think
I'm making this up.
You think that, what, my imaginary boyfriend went missing?
You're an only child.
Your father left when you were young.
Your mother died earlier this year in a hospital.
Yes, February.
She went in for a routine check-up and never checked out.
She had a blood infection.
So it's not surprising that your subconscious would choose a hospital to fabricate-
It's not my subconscious anything.
Oh my Lord!
This is real.
He was there for me.
You know, I remember her funeral.
- He was at it.
- Kevin?
Yes, Kevin.
I know it's hard to lose somebody you care deeply about, Mary.
It's very understandable how someone in your situation could suffer a psychological break.
You work long hours.
You've lost your emotional support system. You're alone.
It's only natural for the brain to reach for something, anything, to grab onto.
He drove us here.
He did.
And I remember the ride like the back of my hand.
He- he- he was-
He was chewing on the lid of his coffee cup.
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.
I know that it all must seem real.
It seems real because it is real!
I remember walking through the parking structure.
Memory is a very vivid and powerful sensation, Mary.
It is real!
This whole situation is real.
And he's here.
He was here,
He's somewhere right now in this hospital and we're wasting time!
The nurse advised me to get coffee, said the surgery would be an hour.
It was 25 minutes, and he's gone.
It was real.
It's all right, Mary.
Can I just have a moment alone?
Take all the time you need, dear.
I'll be in my office next door.
Okay.
Mary, I-
Security.
Want some company?
Do you know I was just here for a checkup today?
Doctor told me I need to take it easy.
Then you call.
I gotta tell you, this job can really take its toll on you- your health, your marriage.
You're married?
Was.
Marriage, it can be a funny thing, you know?
You commit yourself, you hand your heart over to someone, but it always seems like it's the little things that keep chipping away at it-
Little disagreements.
She- she hated the fact that I was a cop.
And you know what?
Maybe- maybe she was right.
I don't know.
I was working a gang shooting over in Glassell Park, and my partner and I, we traced the shooter back to his girlfriend's house.
He'd been shacking up there for a couple of weeks.
And we had the kid cornered, so we went in.
He was unarmed, gave himself right up.
What we didn't know that his girlfriend was in the house.
The last thing I remember before I blacked out... was watching my partner... his dark lifeless eyes as he fell to the floor.
Now look at me.
I've got a desk job and high blood pressure and a doctor telling me how to live my life.
What I'm- what I'm trying to say here is that...
I understand what you're going through.
Can you please tell
Dr. Bensley that... he can just do whatever needs to do, all right?
Mary's behavior is definitely indicative of someone in the midst of an emotional breakdown.
And yet I never met anyone with such conviction in her delusion.
She absolutely believes that everything that's happening is real.
She's emotionally lost.
Yeah, this Bensley.
Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh under 72-hour observation.
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.
Mr. Holloway, this is J.J.
I have her in the hallway.
Switching to camera 2.
I'm following her along the hallway.
I have her.
- Do not lose her.
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.
We only have limited coverage down there.
I'm en route right now.
Dr. Bensley, what are we dealing with here?
Is she dangerous?
It's impossible to say.
Acute perception of persecution, paranoia.
You just never know how someone like this will act when pushed too far.
No, no.
No cameras, none.
No parking lot.
No exits.
No. I can't find her anywhere.
We only got a couple of cameras operational in that area, so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.
Wait, I think
I've got something.
Boom! Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.
It looks like she's heading towards the morgue.
She's running. She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?
Yeah, quite a potent dosage.
Okay, so this could be some sort of psychotic reaction.
It could indeed.
Hello.
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.
My God, Kevin.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.
What's happening?
Listen to me, okay?
Don't trust anyone.
I don't know how many people are involved in this.
It's very important, okay?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.
Check all the rooms on that wing.
Look around you. Where are you?
Where are you right now?
I'm in a bathroom somewhere.
Are you okay?
Are you safe?
Where are you?
I don't- hold on.
Um...
I'm in the morgue.
- Can you get down here?
- No, no! Leave me alone!
Kevin.
Kevin. Kevin!
Kevin.
Miss Walsh.
Miss Walsh, you in here?
I got her. She's heading towards the parking garage.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is a first date.
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third. Fifth date.
Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.
I think I've done all I can do.
Sorry she sent you on such a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it happens.
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.
Cooper: Hi, Mary.
- Hello.
- Shh.
I heard what happened.
These are for you.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
The doctor thought you needed some more time to recuperate.
The cop- I think he might have left.
Thank you.
They think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.
I want to discuss the situation about Kevin and how you could see him again.
You do wanna see him again, right?
Do you know where he is?
Now don't get yourself worked up, young lady.
You did make quite a spectacle of yourself, Miss Walsh.
The emotional outburst, the panicking.
We expected that, but the accident.
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean, you've got to be more careful.
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried, regional operations manager for the Empyrean
International Bank. "
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago, but the bank got your house in the reverse mortgage.
That's true.
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.
But your bank, on the other hand, recently received from the federal government a $2 billion bailout.
Now I've seen the bonus structure, rewarding their executives while letting their customers go bankrupt, huh?
And you have access to unlimited funds.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!
So...
- How much?
- $10 million.
I've taken the liberty to get Kevin's computer.
Inside here you'll find the account and wire routing numbers of a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Once I receive confirmation of funds received,
I'll let your boyfriend go.
Shit.
I have no Wi-Fi signal.
I checked it myself.
It's fine.
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal in this room.
I need a hard line.
I need to move to a different location.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, cut off
Peterson's finger.
No, wait! Wait!
Tell him no.
Look at this right here.
This is our signal.
There is none.
I've tried every single network,
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.
I need you to move me to a place where I can plug in a different computer.
I can get it done in no time, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff, which is exactly how much time you've got to find a computer to get me my money.
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.
If you fail, Kevin dies.
If you tell anyone,
Kevin dies.
If you leave the hospital,
Kevin dies.
Got it.
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.
Meet me on sublevel "B" when you're done.
Wonderful.
Miss Walsh?
Mr. Holloway, that crazy
Mary Walsh lady is back wandering the halls.
She's looking for a patient that does not appear to be in our system.
She needs be escorted out immediately.
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
We have footage of Miss Walsh in the trauma recovery room.
J.J., punch up everything on level 3, would you, please?
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Holloway: There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.
Unfortunately, the nurse stepped away.
You don't really think she's dangerous, do you?
I'm not taking any chances.
Besides, with her injuries, her well-being is my responsibility.
Trust me. She's still here, and we will find her.
I have my people turning this place upside down.
Well, let me know the minute you hear anything.
I'm going back upstairs.
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Please work.
Hello.
Mary: Kevin.
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.
Are you hurt?
He's fine.
Let him go.
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code to complete the wire transfer.
So I would suggest that you let him go now.
Move it!
Honey.
I thought I lost you forever.
The code, come on!
Done.
Come on, let's go up those stairs.
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.
Well, I'm glad you made it safely.
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?
Yeah, Kansas City.
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.
Excuse me one second.
Royal Cayman Bank & Trust.
This is Barry.
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.
Did it go through?
Yes, sir. As a matter of fact, it's pending right now.
We're on, guys.
Thank you, Miss Walsh.
Great work, baby.
I mean, fantastic.
Kevin: It's a good thing too.
Just in time,
'cause this brace is really starting to make my leg really stiff.
Kevin, what are you doing?
Cooper: Haven't you been paying any attention? There is no Kevin Peterson.
Kevin.
Oh my God.
Where are you?
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.
Can you get down here?
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.
There is no...
Kevin Peterson.
Kevin, Kevin!
Kevin.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Oh, my.
So how much?
Franklin: What about the nurse, this Amanda?
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham: We don't have anyone
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.
- Mary: Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
Mary: Uh, no...
Amanda.
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.
...and we can't find him.
My wife, she has breast cancer.
Well, she's up in chemo.
That's him right there.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine with closed-circuit cameras.
You know, Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something, if need be.
Mary:
Everything is a lie?
Everything is a lie?
Every- every- everything-
- everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.
The man you fell in love with... he's not real.
I'm a real idiot.
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.
Believe me, if I was any younger,
I would have done this myself.
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.
She's a real tiger cat between the sheets.
Oh, I don't know, Coop.
I think you could have handled her.
Holloway: All we had to do was sit back and watch you lose it.
It was simple.
Mare bear, for old times' sake.
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.
Boys, I think it's time to go.
All right, Holloway, you know the drill.
Amanda.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm sorry.
Victoria Markham's office, please.
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?
Look, I think she's telling us the truth about her boyfriend.
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.
Whoo!
$10 million feels good, doesn't it, babe?
Baby, gimme a kiss.
You know,
I almost feel bad.
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?
Almost, but I can think of
10 million reasons why not.
Come on! Up!
Get up those stairs.
Come on!
Don't fight me!
Yeah, you're a fighter, ain't you?
I believe Stevie once said you were an animal in bed.
Easy easy.
Shh!
Yeah.
Damn, you're fine.
I wanna show you something.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Maybe I shouldn't let you go just yet.
What are you reaching for down there?
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?
The transfer.
You know they were talking about the transfer?
Yeah, what about it?
It's still pending.
Really? You pulling another one of your tiger moves?
- Is that it?
- I could take that money and I could transfer it right into your account with just the click of a button.
What do you mean
I could have the money?
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here. Look.
Slowly, do it slowly.
Let me see. Oh!
Mary, where's my little lamb?
Mary!
Where you at?
Holloway:
Mary!
Mary.
We got 23 exits.
We checked 22.
Really? You think
I did a good job?
Yes, you in the naughty nurse's outfit was really something.
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.
Hey, look, don't get too excited.
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.
Kevin: Hello, Holloway.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
Mare bear... is that you?
I can hear you breathing.
And I know your breath.
Where's Holloway?
You didn't kill
Holloway, did you?
I didn't know you had it in you.
Mary.
Mary, listen to me.
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.
Just relax. I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!
I thought you said you knew this chick, Steve.
I do. I told you, she's smart.
- Hello.
- Barry: I'm afraid there's been a problem.
The wire's been reversed.
Cooper:
What are you talking about?
The bank recalled the money.
Can't do that.
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.
Sir, there's nothing more that I can do, okay?
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.
Sir, do whatever you have to do, sir.
I'm sorry.
We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll put a bullet in her head right now.
Turn around here.
Son of a bitch!
There she is!
End of the road, baby.
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects spotted in hospital parking garage driving silver sedan.
All units respond.
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.
You hear me?
Right here!
I need backup at County Hospital now.
Mary honey,
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Mare bear.
No! No, don't hit her.
We need her information.
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.
Mare.
Mary: Please stop!
Cooper, put the gun down.
You're a smart girl,
Walsh.
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.
I'm gonna put my gun down.
I'm gonna do it right here.
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?
Drop your weapon,
Cooper.
Coop... you okay?
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!
Where'd you get a gun, honey?
Put it away.
Stay where you are.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.
Take it easy.
This is a whole different side of you
I've never seen.
And how do you feel about that side?
I like it.
I like it a lot.
Me too.
Baby, this whole thing has gotten completely out of hand.
You were never supposed to get hurt.
Okay?
Look, we can work this out.
Okay, listen, forget these guys, okay?
Why don't you and I just take the money?
You can resend it.
We'll take it. We can be anybody we wanna be.
We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.
No no no, it started off about money, but now, I mean, honey, everything's changed.
I would hate for you to see four months of wasted time and effort.
I would really hate it.
It would hurt me.
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.
So you and I, we could take the money together.
Right here.
And it could happen just with the push of a little button.
We can go anywhere we want to.
We can be anybody we want to.
Think about it.
Baby, that sounds pretty fantastic.
You... always told me
I was priceless.
Baby, you are priceless... to me.
Just didn't know that I was a $10 million catch!
No!
Mary.
See now, I'm gonna have to break up with you.
For real!
Mare!
Mary.
Mary, don't move.
Stay right there!
Don't move.
I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.
Stay right there.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.
Before we go up there and see all those people,
I just wanted to ask, why did you believe me?
This.
You left it in the chapel.
What about this?
The last chapter.
Take a look.
The whole thing, it's right there.
Couldn't even come up with something original.
Why don't you keep this for evidence?
- You gonna be okay?
- Sure I am.
Gonna just keep on living one day at a time.
- How about you?
- I called my wife.
- You did?
- You got me thinking.
Maybe I let her go too easily.
I am proud of you, kid.
Come on. Let's get you to a real hospital.
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
It was my fault.
I was the one driving when it happened.
After the accident, I started seeing things, things that couldn't be real.
But I'm not crazy.
I know.
Your father knows.
Anyone who knows you knows that.
Look, Max, I've seen you every day for the past two months.
Maybe you're starting to let go of your misplaced guilt.
Maybe you're ready to stop blaming yourself for what happened.
But there's no one else to blame.
It's gotten to the point where I look in the mirror...
and I'm not even sure what's real anymore.
Fancy mirror.
Later.
You're a lady-killer, Schow.
Lady-killer.
What's goin' on?
Hey! What-
No!
Yeah.
Max.
- Who's this?
- Are you still sleeping? What time is it?
- Dad? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.
Yeah. Is everything all right?
Yeah. Did I wake you up?
You don't sound good.
- I'm fine. I'm just getting some sleep.
- Thank you.
Careful over there.
Just getting to the point where I can sleep through the night again.
Good, good.
You gotta get your rest.
- Keller.
- Yeah?
- Five minutes.
- Okay, that's great.
That is the Mayflower signature right there.
That glass has been through so much.
You can see the care that went into making it.
Even the base came from the original store.
So that gives us the- its spirit.
I think it's perfect.
Look, Max, for the last two months the police have been all over us...
Iooking for that missing girl.
Max, we may not be able to open on time.
Really? I didn't know that, Dad.
And then last week our night security guard goes crazy.
He cuts himself up bad and he quits.
Max, I've got weeks of work to do and two weeks out from opening.
The last thing I need to be doing... is looking for a new night watchman.
I'm just not sure I'm ready yet, Dad, after all that's happened this year and-
Max. This is what you need.
And, honestly, right now I need you, Max.
I know it'll help you take your mind off things.
- Yeah.
- Look.
- I think it's gonna be good.
- All right, Dad. I'll do it.
Thanks for the opportunity.
No, no, no, thank you, Max.
I tell you what.
Why don't you come in to work a little early and find me...
so that we can say hello before you clock in. Okay?
- Yeah. Sure. I'll come find you.
- All right.
- We'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay, Dad.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Shoot.
I got it.
Just trying to help.
That may or may not be the case... but you should put that on your punch list, then take care of that first thing tomorrow.
Would you do that?
Jenna, will you take care of the accessories? That'll be great.
Ladies and gentlemen, the thing
I am most proud of in the entire store.
- This is my son Max.
- Hi.
- How are ya, son?
- Good.
Yeah? Get some rest?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I wanna introduce you to a few people.
This is Keller Landreaux.
He's gonna be our store manager when we open in a few weeks.
Keller told us that we could buy property down here in New Orleans... for a song and a dime.
That's exactly what we did.
Smart man.
Glad to meet you, Max.
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me.
And this beautiful young lady we have right here... this is Jenna McCarty.
Jenna is the head buyer for the store... and she has promised to bring us a little bit of that Fifth Avenue flair... to Bourbon Street, yes?
Sure.
Nice to meet you, Max.
You too.
You know, Max, ladies love a man in uniform.
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure the polyester pants really help seal the deal.
And last but not least
I'd like to introduce you to Ryan P-
- What was your last name?
- Parker.
I'm just kidding you. Ryan Parker, our vice president in charge of operations.
- Good to meet you, Max.
- Likewise.
While you're out there on your rounds, you see something that doesn't look right... you got a problem with plumbing or electric, fire... you get a candy bar stuck in the vending machine, you call Ryan.
That's after you call me.
Listen. I'm gonna let you go.
I know you got a job to do.
And we need to continue on our rounds.
Good luck out there.
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.
Shall we?
You all right?
Sorry. First night.
So, Max, you say you've been having those visions again?
Yeah.
Were you taking drugs or had you been drinking when you had this episode?
No. It was last night at my new job.
I saw a woman in one of the mirrors at my work.
You saw a woman?
Yeah. She was looking back at me from the other side.
Her reflection looked like a corpse.
She probably reminded you of Kayla in some way.
Your mind's way of processing the mental shock.
And the pills I prescribed?
Yeah, I took one.
- That's all?
- Yeah.
Good.
I wanted to take more, but I decided not to.
Very good.
So should we put the straitjacket on me now... or should we wait until my time's up?
I'm not worried about you, Max.
- No?
- Not at all.
What you're telling me, it's a good thing.
Yeah?
These representations of Kayla, hallucinations or not... are a sign that you're starting to get your life back in order... that maybe you're starting to let go of your misplaced guilt about her death... that you're ready to stop blaming yourself for what happened.
What intrigues me... is that now that you've stopped wallowing in the drugs and the alcohol... now that you're sober... your mind is ready to begin processing the tragedy in earnest.
You wanna come see me again next week... get back to a regular appointment type thing?
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll run the numbers tomorrow.
Okay. And then I placed the orders for size 8 through 12.
- No. No!
- Why? But-
It's like I told you earlier. I don't want to order any of the larger sizes.
But I don't-
Why, Jenna?
Why?
Because this Mayflower has to convey the message that it's a boutique.
And boutique implies skin and bones.
Yeah, I'm really sure.
Right, right. Okay.
So, if we do the research... and it shows that the demographic is full of heifers... then we'll order accordingly.
But listen to me- Until then, four is the new eight. Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you. Talk to you later.
Camera in the bathroom?
Henry, you dirty dog.
Just want to check in on my new favorite employee.
I'm good. Just happy to be here,
Mr. Landreaux.
We're happy to have you, Max.
Your dad entrusted me with the opening of the new Mayflower as my top priority.
You seem committed, being here so late.
Yeah. I can't let anything interfere with our grand opening.
Yeah. I should do my rounds.
Hey, Max, will you do me a favor?
Call me Keller.
We're all family here at the Mayflower.
Okay.
Jenna?
What are you-
No!
Fuck.
Mornin', rookie.
So, how did that last night go?
Everything all right?
Dr. Beaumont's office.
This is Max Matheson. I need to see
Dr. Beaumont as soon as possible.
Okay, let me see what I have.
How do you think this happened?
I don't know.
Looks more like a- just a terrible accident... but maybe someone killed her.
Homicide by handmade guillotine?
That would impress even yours truly.
Yeah, me too, Pete.
Me too.
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes?
Do you really believe all that, your explanation for what's happening to me?
Well, of course.
There's really no other explanation.
And the fact that it's all related to the mirrors... that that's how
I'm seeing these visions?
Méconnaissance.
What's that?
It's a French term from Jacques Lacan's mirror stage of psychoanalytic theory.
The ego is a product of false reflections.
Méconnaissance- when the subject is alienated from his or her self.
In English?
Nobody sees anything in a mirror... that isn't simply a part of them... not even things they think they're seeing.
Every culture has its own particular myth set regarding mirrors.
In Korea, for example... it's believed that a person's soul can be trapped inside of a mirror... as it leaves the body.
You've heard the old adage, a cracked mirror brings seven years bad luck.
And even here in the South's recent past... it was not uncommon to cover all of the mirrors in a house... where the wake of a deceased person was being held.
There's even a clinical diagnosis... for an intense fear of mirrors called spectrophobia.
Lots of psychic baggage in them there mirrors.
So I guess
I'm doing pretty well, then?
In light of all you've been through... combined with all the superstitions we hold regarding mirrors...
I'd say you're doing pretty good indeed.
How are ya holdin' up?
Fine.
Your father didn't tell you.
Tell me what?
Jenna McCarty, the woman you met the other day... she died last night.
They found her in her apartment.
How did she die?
The police said she fell through glass.
It ripped her head off.
It was a horrible accident.
Such a tragedy.
Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm... just surprised.
You sure?
Yeah.
- Will you call me if you need anything?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I still can't believe it.
Hello?
Are you here? It's me.
Hello?
Oh, God.
I'm really starting to lose it again.
"P." "P." Parker.
Where's the number?
God!
Oh, God!
Hi. You've reached Ryan's answering machine.
I'm unable to get up and get the phone right now...
so leave me a message with your name and your phone number...
- Come on, goddamn it.
- and I will get back to you shortly.
Take care.
You ever seen a 10-56 like that?
I'm not sure.
One thing I know-
This is the second death of an employee who worked at the Mayflower.
The third, if you count the girl who went missing two months ago.
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.
The witnesses.
Where'd you put 'em?
Hey, Pic.
Check out the badge.
He's definitely a person of interest.
Hello?
Yeah, hi, Dad.
What time is it?
I don't know. It's late.
What's going on, Max?
I'm just- I'm calling to let you know that I'm-
I'm gonna be quitting my job.
Are you all right?
No, not really.
I can't keep working there.
It's too much.
Too much?
Yeah.
I think I'm seeing things again.
I'm really sorry.
I don't care about the job.
Just-
- I need to know that you're okay.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
Stop by tomorrow and drop off your ID badge and all that, you know.
Yeah, I will.
Thank you for understanding, Dad.
Max, I'm your father... and I do support you.
You know that.
Yeah, I do.
Okay.
Get some rest.
Okay.
What's wrong with you?
Dad!
Dad!
Max, what are you doing here?
I know what I need to do.
I came by-
- I changed my mind.
- Good for you.
I wanna stay at the Mayflower.
Come here.
Give me one.
Thank you.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
We don't know why things happen the way that they do... but they have a tendency to work themselves out.
Everything happens for a reason, Max.
Yeah. Right.
Are you hungry?
Want a slice?
I'm good.
- Can you hold up a sec?
- Just need a minute.
May I help you?
Detective Huston, Homicide.
Detective Piccirilli.
What he said.
Homicide?
We just come by to ask you a few questions... about some fellow employees at the Mayflower... see if you might know anything about 'em that might be of interest to us.
We went by your house.
You weren't there.
Okay. And?
And why don't you tell us.
Tell you what?
You heard about one
Miss Jenna McCarty, correct?
Yes.
And you were also at the home... of Mr. Ryan Parker earlier tonight, weren't you?
Yeah. But-
Then certainly you must have gathered that he was dead, right?
Right.
Brutally murdered, as a matter of fact.
Hence, homicide.
Plural, actually, Pic.
Homicides, with an S.
You're right, man.
There've been two homicides... involving employees of the Mayflower this week.
Since you were at the scene of the crime tonight-
And in charge of security- it stands to reason that you might have an opinion or two about these matters.
Am I a suspect?
No.
- Not yet.
- Not yet?
Not officially.
What, not officially?
At this point the only thing you're suspected of... is being a lousy security guard.
So, why were you out front of the deceased's home earlier tonight?
Kind of a creepy coincidence, don't you think?
No.
I don't think it was a creepy coincidence.
Not at all.
And I might be a lousy security guard, but it seems to me that the two of you are... not too much better at the detective stuff.
If you'd have done your homework, you would've seen that...
Mr. Parker is the vice president of operations... here at this particular branch of the Mayflower Department Store.
And per protocol, if anything goes wrong, it is my duty... to contact Mr. Parker immediately.
Why not just call him?
As soon as you stop badgering me and you get back to your work... you'll be happy to see that the phone records indicate that I did, in fact... try to call Mr. Parker.
Probably, I might add, during the time at which Mr. Parker was being, as you say... brutally murdered.
Might be kind of hard for me to have been the one killing him too.
So you ran over to the deceased's home... to let him know you were having a problem with-
With the mirrors.
So unless there are any other questions,
I'd really like to get back to my work.
- No more questions.
- For now.
- We just wanted to stop by.
- Say hi.
And let you know that we got our eye out on you.
I feel so much safer knowing that.
Thank you very much, Detectives.
I don't understand.
Who are you?
What do you want?
She worked here.
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Elizabeth Reigns?
Hi. Elizabeth.
Hi. I'm Max.
Hi.
You wanna talk about my sister?
You said you might have some information.
Yeah.
I think maybe I've seen her recently.
Where?
At the Mayflower.
Where at the Mayflower?
In the mirrors.
What- In the mirrors?
What do you mean, in the mirrors?
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy... but I see her reflection in the mirrors.
And l-
Then I turn around and she's gone.
She's not there anymore.
I don't know who put you up to this.
My sister, my little sister Eleanor has been missing for almost two months now.
And you just turn this into some kind of joke.
No, it's not a joke.
Listen to me.
- Listen, I'm serious.
- Don't touch me!
Just don't touch me.
I know what I said, it sounds crazy.
It's the truth.
So this started happening the first night that you were working there?
How can that be?
How is it that out of everyone that works there... you're the only one that can see my sister?
A year ago,
I was driving with my fiancée.
What?
Nothin'.
Okay.
Can you reach into the backpack, grab my phone for me?
- Yeah.
- I need to call my dad.
Okay, hang on. Drive safe.
- Okay, Max?
- Yeah. I got it.
- Please. Thank you.
- I can see.
Perfectly?
- Come on, I'm a great driver.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Where did you say it was?
In the front there.
Front. Front.
- Are you sure?
- Honey, it's right there.
Any luck?
Oh, my God.
Max Matheson, is this what I think it is?
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.
A drunk driver.
He hit you?
I swerved to avoid him.
I wrapped my car around a telephone pole.
Technically, it was my fault.
And your fiancée, she- she died in the accident?
We both did.
Start an IV.
Stay still, sir.
They brought you back.
Maybe I brought back something with me... some ability to see the other side or something.
Afterward, I just got pretty screwed up for a while- drugs, alcohol... whatever I could put into me.
Like I was trying to get closer to her or something.
- Wasn't your fault.
- I was the one driving.
You were trying to swerve to get out of the way. You were trying to save her.
Yeah, but I couldn't.
I couldn't save her.
You wanted to see her again.
Yeah. More than you could ever know.
How long's your sister been missing?
About two months.
And you still think she's-
Dead?
Of course, the cops say that young women up and leave all the time to start new lives.
But Eleanor and I... we weren't just sisters, we were best friends, we were soul mates.
And the night that she... disappeared...
I woke up from a deep sleep, screaming for no reason.
My heart was beating so fast,
I thought it was gonna explode.
I knew right then and there.
What was your sister doing the day she disappeared?
Working at the Mayflower.
There was some sort of party that night and she was- she'd just been hired on.
They were having a groundbreaking celebration.
I gotta get to work.
Yeah, I gotta get some sleep.
I gotta work again tonight.
Call me if anything else comes up.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Max.
I haven't done anything.
Not yet, anyway.
But you're trying.
That's more than anyone else has been willing to do around here.
Eleanor.
I'm trying my best.
I'm trying my best. Really.
Please. Stop doing this.
Wait. What are you doing?
Please, don't- don't do this.
Please.
No.
Tell me what I need to do.
Please, tell me. Just-
What is it? What?
Hello.
What night did she disappear?
It was a Wednesday night.
What was the specific date?
How come?
Well, it's a long shot, but I thought maybe...
if something happened to Eleanor while she was working here at the Mayflower... maybe the security cameras caught something.
It was Wednesday, September 22.
The 22nd.
It's not here.
What?
It's missing.
- Missing?
- Yeah.
Somebody erased it.
- Who?
- Well, give me a minute.
Yeah, last viewed September 24.
Two days after she disappeared.
Who was the last person to view those files?
Yeah, last viewed,
Henry David Schow.
Who's that?
He's the security guard I replaced.
The guy cut himself up and then quit.
They say he's gone totally crazy.
All after my sister went missing.
Can you pick me up?
Henry Schow?
Henry, you in there?
- Henry, is that you?
- Stay away from me.
Come on.
Henry, open the door.
I said stay away.
Henry, we're not here to hurt you.
We just wanna ask a couple questions.
Don't shut- Henry!
Who are you?
I'm your replacement at the Mayflower.
I'm the new night security guard.
You've seen her then?
Seen who?
Her.
Eleanor.
What do you know about Eleanor?
Nothin'. I don't know nothin'.
Henry, you don't have to lie to us.
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are! What are you hiding?
She wants to kill me.
Why does my sister want to kill you?
Your sister?
Henry, did you kill my sister?
No. I don't know what happened to her.
But why do you think she wants to kill you?
I don't know.
What about the files?
What files?
The digitized security camera files.
The one from the night she went missing.
The ones you erased, Henry.
I was just following orders!
Henry, who told you to erase those files?
Mr. Landreaux, Keller Landreaux... asked me to get rid of 'em, said it was important.
- Keller.
- That's when your sister first showed up.
That night.
That's when she started haunting all my mirrors.
Henry, there's something you're not telling us.
I told you everything.
Henry, now, my sister went missing the next day.
And somebody asked you to erase those security files from the cameras... and you didn't think that was a little bit suspicious?
No, I didn't.
I didn't think that. L-
I just didn't wanna know.
Henry, you need to tell us everything that happened that night. Everything.
I just want her to leave me alone.
She's not gonna stop this until she gets what she wants.
Until she gets the truth, Henry!
I don't know the truth.
Keller threatened my job, so I just-
I went along with him.
We were in the basement.
He said we had to erase the files.
I'm sorry!
The basement.
We have to go back to the Mayflower.
We have to check the basement.
Basement.
I'm sorry!
What is it?
There's rust on the ground.
I think it came from that.
It's been moved.
Give me a hand?
It's a crawl space.
You okay in there?
- Max?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Don't say a word or you're both dead.
I'm gonna be right back.
Max, we need to talk.
Just come out.
- Max, he's got a gun!
- Shit!
Fuck!
Really need to loosen that one up.
Look out, world.
Jenna McCarty's up to her old tricks.
Now, now. The only way to keep the new hires under your thumb... is to make sure you have dirt on them.
And nothing commands more respect than knowing that you... have made a complete and total asshole of yourself in front of the higher-ups.
You're bad.
- So where you from originally?
- So anyway-
- There's the guy right there.
- Here you go, miss.
You know that girl right there?
She's in accounting?
I've seen her before, but I haven't really met that many people yet, so-
And what about you?
I'm in operations, so, pretty much the day-to-day stuff.
I think she's got something for you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You're drinking water?
- Yes. I've been so thirsty.
- Driving.
Elizabeth!
Help!
Look, I didn't wanna hurt your sister!
I don't wanna hurt you!
Why are you making me do this?
Why won't you listen to me!
Get off me!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Honey, are you okay?
- I just-
- What happened?
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, boss.
She's, you know, been drinking.
Oh, no. Looks like somebody had a little too much to drink.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Keller's gonna take you home, sweetie.
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
Here, come here, baby. Here.
- Just get her arm.
- There we go.
- You'll be fine.
- There we go.
You'll be fine.
Just drink a lot of water.
Have fun.
Want a shot?
- Yes, please.
- Two.
- I left my purse at work.
- Okay, we'll go back. No problem.
My keys.
Wait.
- Where are we going?
- There you go.
I'm gonna get you home safe and sound.
I have to go home?
And here we are.
Let's get your keys and get you home.
I just feel so-
- No, no, no.
- Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Stop it!
We need to talk about this!
Eleanor, we need to talk about this!
Eleanor! Where are you going?
Come here!
I just wanna talk to you!
I just wanna talk to you!
What?
Help! Max!
Stop!
Don't move, bitch.
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!
I can't let this happen.
Walk!
I just wanna talk to you!
I swear to Christ,
I'm not gonna hurt you!
I just wanna talk.
I just think you're a little confused, that's all.
Get down there, Eleanor!
- Eleanor?
- I just want to talk.
You're gonna ruin everything!
Get off of me!
This is your fault, Eleanor!
All you had to do was talk to me!
Fuck.
I'm so stupid!
I'm so stupid!
Help! Get off me!
Get off me!
Get back, Elizabeth!
Drop it, Keller.
It's over, Keller.
Oh, my God!
It's over.
We did it, Max.
So let me get this straight.
So even after you helped
Keller Landreaux... cover up the crawl space hole with a furnace... and erase all the digital files from the security cameras... you didn't think something was,
I don't know... fishy?
No, sir, I didn't.
But you'd heard the girl went missing.
Yes, sir, I did.
And you're willing to sign a confession admitting everything you've told us?
Yeah.
Which you understand... will be admitting to your role... in the conspiracy to cover up the murder of Eleanor Reigns.
What say we get this man a pen.
You took the words right out of my mouth, Pic.
Okay, what gives, Pete?
That was the easiest interrogation ever.
I don't know, Pic.
First time I ever played good cop, good cop though.
Must be some catch.
Always a catch.
Hello, Eleanor.
Second Part
Father. Father!
If you only knew how anxiously and impatiently I’ve been waiting for you!
I was uncertain about writing to the Countess...
With what intention?
With the intention of spending a few hours to help an old monk.
But I've gone on and on and you must be dying of hunger and thirst after such a journey, Father!
Come.
Come.
The monk in charge has left us the choice of his chicken coop.
As a special treat!
The capon is divine you'll see...
Baked, with baby potatoes.
And the monastery wine?
Renowned! You'll see.
I’m not that much of an eater and drinker.
I was. But I’m afraid I’ve lost the habit and the taste.
Bad! That's bad.
They're the blessings of the Lord
It's our duty to honour them.
We, more than anyone else, as His true servants...
But in the present case,
I must confess that my references to the menu are a secondary issue.
What do you mean?
I have a long story to tell you
My story:
I’ve never told it to anyone.
During my long tale you will surely ask yourself why I am telling you these things.
You will understand, once and for all, why.
Accept that I’ll keep you quiet for now.
I was born in Minho.
My father was from a noble family, older than the kings of this land...
I was born with bad instincts and was freely educated.
They issued me carte blanche to freely dispose of the gold with which I prodigiously indulged my immoralities.
All of this ended when I saw the
Countess of Viso for the first time
It was my cousin, Paulo, my best and most loyal friend, almost like a brother, her husband... her husband...
The baroness would have bitten you if she could have...
What did you do to her?
I couldn't take it any longer.
I broke it off with her.
She wouldn't give in.
Tears, screams, howls.
Unbearable.
I wrote to her husband.
You wrote to him!?
Saying what?
That I had been his wife's lover.
And the lie:
That I had broken it off because I found it hard to deceive him.
You wrote that to him?!
Literally.
And I stressed that the woman would not let me go, and that it was now up to him, the husband, to take her in hand.
No! What did he do?
I don't know, but she left me in peace.
Alvaro, you are truly unique!
No, Paulo, I’m not.
I’m bored with myself.
Bored, but why?
I’m twenty-three years old, Paulo.
Twenty-three!
And in twenty-three years I’ve never known the thrill of a noble passion.
Noble passion!
That doesn't even sound like you, cousin.
With all the women that you...
With all the women I’ve thrown into dishonour.
No, that you threw or they threw themselves.
Don't tell me you're feeling remorse.
Ls that it?
Not one of them weighs on my conscience.
Not one of them weighs on my conscience.
What weighs on me is that not one of them inspired true affection in me.
Be careful, the Count is a jealous man...
And a man of arms!
And the Countess has everything that can cause a man to lose himself.
Yes, an almost pilgrim-like beauty, and they say she has a rich spirit.
For the love of such a woman,
I could become my friends' assassin...
If the condition of my power were such.
What a look!
A look that says: retreat, you wretched man!
It's not just the Countess who is looking at you...
Didn't I tell you he was jealous?
Count:
They tell me that we share feelings for the same person,
Don Alvaro de Albuquerque.
It isn't always appropriate to put faith in what people say, Count.
How so?
Was it not your father who died in the dungeons of the Castle of S. João da Foz, near here?
Just some ten years ago?
It was eleven, Count. Eleven years ago.
Eleven years ago.
So they hadn't misinformed me then.
Not by the look of things.
If you'll excuse me...
But, in fact, I’m sorry, Count.
To whom does this sentiment that we share refer?
- Did you perchance know my father?
- No. Unfortunately.
I did not have that honour.
I was referring to the man responsible for his death.
The Count of Oeiras?
Was it not the torture of this butcher of a man that led to you losing your father?
It was also thanks to his intrigues with His Majesty that I was removed from the Palace.
I shall never forgive him.
Nor shall l, believe me.
I’ve waited eleven years for this happy moment where I can alleviate my rancour with the spilled blood of the Marquis of Pombal.
Holy words, my friend, Holy words!
Friends throughout life and throughout death!
This house is yours.
I will take full pleasure in keeping my door open to you, both by day and by night!
Music, Music.
The friendship of the Count in no way altered the iciness of the Countess.
Her indifference, silent and impassable, was like a sarcastic jab at my vanity...
She was my first passion;
And I fed it with generous tears.
Alvaro...
That was my name back then, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I will tell you everything at the appropriate time.
Until that evening I had never met the
Countess face to face.
What happened?
Who is going to travel?
The Count, sir. His Majesty died yesterday
Don Alvaro.
I was going to send someone to advise you.
We are going to have to move on our little game.
Don José is dead.
Her Highness, Dona Maria called me to the Palace to attend the tribute and has named me a Knight of the Royal Chamber!
Good, which means that the
Marquis... now has his days numbered.
Her Highness loathes him more than the two of us together, man!
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I’m going to get a Port wine I’ve had in the house for fifteen years, that's been waiting for this very occasion!
There is plenty of time for that, man.
First, I wanted to ask you a favour:
From one friend to another...
Tell me, only if I'm unable to...
You're able. Just willing to is enough.
I would like you to give two words of consolation to the Countess...
But isn't the Countess going with you?
What a thought, Don Alvaro!
You know that women, in these political matters, are an obstacle.
The Countess sat down, and she was offended. Well, you know...
Who better than my friend to explain it to her?
It's just that I don't have the time.
Nor the talent.
I am a man of arms, not words,
I have no knack whatsoever for speeches.
Well, but will the Countess listen to me?
She hears just fine so why wouldn't she listen?
Women melt with beautiful words.
Thank you, my friend.
And don't let the Countess embarrass herself any further.
Strike the iron while it's hot.
I’m dying to see the face of the Marquis being run out of the Palace with a swift foot to the seat of his pants!
Well they're wrong!
The Count is wrong, and so is his lawyer.
It's not about vanity.
Nor about wounded self-esteem.
What hurts me is the lack of consideration.
It's being treated like a... like a ridiculous obstacle.
I’m delighted you find me amusing,
Don Álvaro.
Especially when I’m not trying to be funny.
I am afraid you have mistaken me, Countess.
I am not the Count's lawyer, nor does my smile carry the intention you have attributed it
It was the word "obstacle" that made me smile.
It was the same word the Count used just now.
He referred to me as an obstacle?
No, not personally.
You know the Count carries his heart in his mouth. He is a soldier.
You know the Count carries his heart in his mouth. He is a soldier.
He has the rude frankness of a soldier.
He has no style. No pretense.
Ls that the case?
But the truth is, either in general or in particular, you think my role is not by his side in the Palace, but here as your servant in this place of exile!
You certainly think like he does.
No. Not in any way.
I don't think your place is here.
And even less as a servant.
Why?
You hardly know me.
I know you well enough, Silvina,
To guess, to see beyond appearances, all your desires and anxieties.
The countess could tell... stifled dreams...
She knew only too well... that I adored her.
She would fight against her heart, denying its impulses...
But she was weak.
Am I really so transparent?
As weak as every woman who fights two powerful enemies.
The indifference of her husband.... and the most loving warmth of desire....
She gave in to it.
They all give in the end, Father Dínís, when the lover's patience takes advantage of the husband's impatience.
God in heaven! It's daytime!
Alvaro! Alvaro!
For the love of God, wake up!
It's already daytime!
Alvaro! Alvaro!
Such a shame.
You're going to have to hide me here until night time.
That's impossible!
They're bound to want to clean up...
Oh my God!
Someone is coming!
Yes, what is it?
Forgive me, Countess, a letter has arrived from the Count. It is urgent.
Do you not feel well, Countess?
No, I slept poorly.
Don't interrupt me again unless I call.
Alvaro! Please...please.
He wants you to go to him.
Right now. Today.
"Come at once".
Why this hurry?
He doesn't say...
But like this, suddenly, after three months...
He knows.
Impossible. We were so careful.
How could he know?
He knows.
Someone told him.
Someone must have seen us.
No, Alvaro, you're right.
I can't go to be with him...
Better to die. Better to kill myself!
No!
Better to live!
The two of us. Far away from here.
In France or Italy. It doesn't matter.
But the two of us. Together.
Run away?!
With what? How?
When?...
I’ll sell everything I own here.
Two days are all I need.
Two days from now we'll be in Spain.
Three days later, we can be in Venice.
But the two of us! Free!
We crossed half of Europe as if in a dream.
To Spain, France, the north of Italy.
We only stopped in Venice.
We spent months of supreme happiness there.
But in the shadows, and with no signs as to excite curiosity in us, we were without a country.
There wasn't a single hint that could give away our identity as outsiders.
Until the day Silvina told me she was carrying a child.
Quite soon, however, the event that should have crowned our happiness, now threatened it's very existence.
How are you?
How is she?
How do you expect her to be?
I don't understand.
You knew the risk you were running...
Risk? What risk, doctor?
She didn't tell you?
What was she supposed to have told me?
She didn't tell you.
The physiological constitution of the lady...
The what? What does she have?
What constitution?
The doctors had advised her...
They said nothing to you?
When she married, they warned her:
Childbirth could be fatal for her...
Fatal!?
Don't despair. Science sometimes works miracles.
Come with me, come see her.
Alvaro.
Alvaro.
My God, am I going to die!
No. I won't leave Silvina!
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to...
- You should have told me!
- I didn't want to frighten you...
I thought, with time the doctors might...
Come on, be strong!
Now leave.
Let us work.
Be strong!
I thought I would die, but I did not die.
I considered suicide.
I looked around me, searching for a pistol, a dagger, an abyss...
Paradoxically, my religious beliefs were born in that very instant.
Without God, there are incurable wounds.
You?
Not out of my love for religion!
Nor out of a thirst for humiliation.
Nor for the cilices, the fasting, the discipline...
No. It's my way of leaving life, without resorting to the cowardly annihilation of my body.
To kill my body.
And to weather the storms of the soul.
Yes but, after all, you have a son...
Exactly.
That is why I came to see you.
So that you can take responsibility for his upbringing.
Me?!
Yes, you, Paulo.
You're the only friend I have left.
Alvaro.
You left him in Rome?
I never saw him again.
For how long?
Fifty-four years.
It isn't possible!
Venice, Rome.
Fifty-four years!
My cousin Paulo died two years later.
He entrusted the child to a friend.
The Marquis of Luso.
Guillotined in France by the Jacobins.
I lost track of you there.
I didn't care if you were alive, or if you were dead.
I was picked up by Raymond de Montfort, a retainer of Louis XVI.
He took me to Angouleme and raised me like his own son.
What winding roads we had to travel, my son, for us to meet again.
How did you know?
Of the Count of Santa Barbara.
Of the Count of Santa Barbara.
Why, I don't know. Don't ask me.
The way you carry yourself, perhaps.
Her look...
Silvina.
Your mother's look...
And her...
My mother?
Has accompanied me ever since.
At every meal.
I give it to you, my son.
My time has come...
There was a tightly sealed door at Father Dínís's college, and no one was allowed to open it...
You know perfectly well no one is allowed in here.
Forgive me, Father Dinis,
I didn't know.
You knew! Keep quiet!
Save what you have to say for confession!
But as long as you're here,
I’ll explain it to you...
This was my uniform as a soldier of the Emperor.
This was the hat worn by "worldly man".
The gypsy, Sabino Cabra.
And here, my mother's skull.
Now you know.
And don't forget.
Solidarity with all men.
This is my temple to sincerity.
That is all.
Father Dinis! Father Dinis!
I’m sorry.
And now, my friends, let's talk...
Father Dínís decided to send me to France for my studies.
On the night before my departure,
I went to see my mother, through the bars of the convent gate.
We both remained speechless.
We just kept looking at each other for the entire visit, we would ever see each other.
We would ever see each other.
While I waited to board the ship that would take me to France,
I noticed a man who couldn't seem to take his eyes off me.
I could not have imagined the decisive role he had played in my past, let alone what role he was to play in my future.
In life, there are events and coincidences of such extravagance that no novelist would ever dare to invent them...
It was one of those improbable events that led Alberto de Magalhaes to marry Eugenía, the former lover of the Count of Santa Barbara...
Superb creature!
Careful, old man, her husband is as jealous as a tiger.
And, as ferocious as two.
Speak of the devil....
But I know him.
Who? Alberto de Magalhaes?
That's what he calls himself around here?
In Paris, his name was Leopoldo Saavedra and in Brussels, Tobias Navarro!
Are you serious?
When?
About three or four years ago.
Look, they're leaving. It appears they didn't like the performance.
They didn't even stay for the second act.
No, my friend, the performance had nothing to do with it...
It appears our dear Alberto de Magalhaes has seen a ghost.
Magnificent, yes indeed!
Who is she?
Elisa de Montfort.
The Duchess of Cliton.
Cliton, a French woman...
As French as one can be.
Ls she the ghost?
In flesh and blood.
Our friend must have had a fit when he saw her here.
Why, is there something between them?
In Paris it was said they had been lovers...
It seems the man behaved like a genuine savage...
There was talk of dark reputations and insults.
Shadowy stories about money.
There may have been bloodshed.
A duel of honour... with one of her relatives.
What is certain is that our Leopoldo
Saavedra vanished rather suddenly, and then in Brussels he was already known as Tobias Navarro.
The lady Duchess is also leaving.
Dear Baron de Sá, what is your secret?
There isn't a beautiful woman who escapes you.
Where did you meet that goddess there whom you just approached?
To be honest, it was she who approached me!
And she's not the first, in any case...
Although I honestly don't remember......
Although I honestly don't remember......
My time there was spent with so many pretty women!
She approached you, nevertheless, and in what context?
I don't mean to be indiscreet!
She implored me to go and visit her at the Isidro!
She has been lodging there.
Her request came under the pretext of exchanging old memories...
"Souvenír, souvenír..."
But to me, something doesn't fit!
There's a mystery there.
Court, Royal Family,
Versailles... like an ordinary "bourgeoisie".
Like an ordinary "bourgeoisie".
I must hurry! It would be a sin to miss the duet. We'll talk later.
I’m thinking of taking all the artists here away from the Sao Carlos Theatre.
Brazil must see these productions.
The second act is even better.
Well, but unfortunately
I won't be able to stay.
Did you say the entire cast?
Yes, the chorus as well, everyone.
That's a lot of people!
Brazil deserves it.
That woman is looking at you.
She has been following us this whole time.
I had already noticed.
I knew her some time ago, but I don't remember anymore.
Shall we go?
Shall we escape?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
A thousand pardons...
- I was told downstairs to come up.
- That was the order I gave.
I couldn't wait to see you.
I didn't come earlier, because I feared I would be bothering you.
I’ve been stifling my own impatience since last night.
You exaggerate, I’m sure.
But I am flattered.
I thank you so much for having come.
It brings me such happiness to meet a familiar face in a town where really
I know no one at all.
It would be an honour to be your guide.
Please think of me as your servant.
I certainly intend to.
But it is I who shall be honoured to have as my guide a man of your quality.
A very modest quality comparing to the charm and elegance of Your Excellency...
It is my tea time.
I am counting on you to keep me company...
I assure you, Madame, in Portugal there is little conversation.
We are missing the words that most captivate the ears.
Especially the Portuguese ladies.
In no way can one compare them to French woman.
They lack the spirit, the spice, the champagne!
I love the French!
The fortunate Parisian!
With this ardour you must have had enormous success there.
If you permit me, Madame,
I can tell you without vanity that
I have taken fortresses that would have made others desist.
I am most convinced.
I'm convinced just by watching and hearing you.
But permit me to question you, in return, whether all the Portuguese are as you say...
For example, the lady with whom
I saw you chatting yesterday at the opera...
Ah, yes. Eugenia de Magalhaes.
Eugenia. Pretty name...
And his name?
His name?
His name...
Ah! Alberto.
Alberto de Magalhaes.
Alberto.
Eugenia and Alberto.
They're married, of course...
Of course...
For long?
About a year now.
I’d like to meet him.
The couple?
No. Just him.
Alberto de Magalhaes?!
Do you find that impossible?
For a man such as myself, Madame, nothing is impossible.
But you find it "inconvenient".
For someone like Your Excellency,
"inconvenience" does not exist.
But your interest, let us say, in this man...
How shall I put it?
Well, it intrigues me. That's all!
Interest?!
Let's not exaggerate.
What is of interest are my devotions to Your Excellency.
For him, I have merely curiosity.
If it is simply to satisfy curiosity,
I will take you to him tomorrow.
I would prefer that you send him to me alone.
I don't like to mix intimate friends with vulgar acquaintances...
Your wishes are my commands.
Forgive me, I had to leave for a minute.
But I’m counting on your support.
You delight me, madame.
You delight me.
- You delight me.
- I understood!
Money is in the high seas!
Hello, Alberto!
I’m sorry to bother you, just a few seconds.
Of course, Baron.
Make yourself comfortable, have a seat.
I won't be long. I can't be late.
They're waiting for me on the corner.
Here it is! Someone implored me to deliver a message...
An invitation, actually.
A friend of mine, a close friend, very close.
A lady from high society...
French.
An acquaintance from Paris.
Madame Cliton.
The Duchess?
Do you know her?
Intimately!
I know her intimately!
Intimately!
I know her intimately!
But don't tell me, you also know her?
I’ve heard her name spoken.
It has burned my fingers and my soul for years.
Take it. It's yours.
Ls that all?
Does she know?
Whom?
Eugenia.
That is her name, isn't it?
I see that fool of a Baron has spoken of her to you as well.
But no, she doesn't know.
And I don't want her to know.
Watch yourself, if she learns of any of this!
There are chasms in my life
I don't want her dangling over.
Feelings you couldn't possibly understand.
Get going, Elisa.
Return to France.
It's useless to try and see me again.
Forget me, as I have forgotten you.
The past doesn't rewrite itself, and the dead never rise again.
You're not going to have me eat lunch all alone?
What kind of Christian charity is that?
Nothing would give me more pleasure, my child.
Unfortunately, the Countess of Santa Barbara is waiting for me in the Convent of Odivelas.
I’m the only visitor she has left, since her son left for France.
There is a foreign lady downstairs.
She's asking for you.
Foreign?
Did she give her name?
If she did, I didn't understand, my lady.
She speaks in her own manner.
But I did understand that she's a friend of Sir Alberto.
A friend?
Send her up.
Yes, Madam, excuse me.
How amusing...
She's the first acquaintance
I’ve met of Alberto's... apart from you, of course, Father.
Well, I’ll be going...
At least I leave you with company.
Sit down, please.
He's funny, your butler.
Poor man, he's ill.
Alberto took him under his wing.
He's like a son to him.
I hope you'll forgive this intrusion by a stranger...
Not a complete stranger...
You know who I am?!
No. But I have seen you before.
Of course, the day before yesterday.
At the opera.
I thought you hadn't even noticed me...
It is impossible not to notice you.
Should I take that as a compliment?
Take it as you wish, Madame...
But I beg your pardon.
I didn't catch your name...
Elisa de Montfort.
And you are a friend of Alberto's...
How strange! He has never spoken about you to me!
You haven't any reason to worry, our dealings are strictly commercial.
I am not worried, Madame de Montfort.
I have complete faith in my husband.
I don't doubt it. He's very good at winning the confidence of women...
You still haven't told me the purpose of your visit,
I have come to pay a debt.
A debt? To me?
To your husband.
I assume you don't live together under the terms of separation of property.
I prefer that you settle your accounts with him directly.
I am not used to meddling in his affairs.
If I’ve understood correctly, he is away.
Anyway, I was curious to see, up close, the woman who made Alberto lay down is guard.
I have no regrets.
Your beauty adds further justice to his great reputation in Europe.
Unfortunately for you, it is not his only reputation...
But it won't take you long to discover that by yourself.
If you haven't already...
From now on you may count on my compassion.
Goodbye, Madame.
Madame! Your purse!
Take it, if you please.
I cannot accept it.
You are well obliged to.
Unless you attach it by force around my neck...
Come in, Duchess, come in.
Do not fear me.
I wish you no ill will.
I am here on behalf of Blanche de Montfort.
My mother...
My friend.
Sit down, my girl.
You knew her?
You knew my mother?
I was quite close to her.
She died in my arms.
But I recognize you!
I saw you this morning!...
I saw you at that man's house...
Alberto de Magalhaes...
Or Leopoldo Saavedra, if you prefer...
You know about all that?
I know almost everything, Duchess.
I know too much.
I would have preferred not to know so much...
But who are you?
Call me Father Dinis, young lady.
I’ve had other names, just like Alberto de Magalhaes.
I’ve been other men.
But they are all dead.
They died at the same time as those whom they held most dear...
Like your mother.
Like Blanche de Montfort.
I beg your pardon, just one moment...
I'm not well...
I'm feeling dizzy...
It will pass. Just give me a moment...
I shall return immediately.
But what did she say to you?
What did she tell you?
Nothing! Apart from what I’ve told you, nothing!
She referred only to the debt.
She never said what, or why.
She made insinuations;
I really don't know what she meant at all...
But the worst was her bitterness!
The hatred I sensed in her voice!
Towards you, and toward me!
A certain desire to do us harm!
It's my fault.
I should have told you everything.
I should have told you.
No! I don't want to know!
I don't want to know anything!
Don't tell me anything,
I’m not interested!
It has nothing to do with us.
It's not a part of our life.
If you tell me, it's as if it mattered, or that it will matter.
Don't tell me anything.
Otherwise, she wins.
My fear is that she will hurt you.
No, stop!
Don't be afraid.
She can't do anything to me.
And if she did something to you...
I would kill her.
I would kill her!
I was born in Venice.
My parents had taken refuge there to escape the scorn of a wronged husband.
But their escape was not enough to avoid God, s punishment...
Two years later, before his death,
Don Paulo entrusted me, in turn, to the Marquis of Luso, who took me to France, where he was appointed for a diplomatic mission in the town of Caen.
It is there that we were surprised by the taking of the Bastille, and the bloodshed that followed...
His relationship with a citizen of
Caen, Charlotte Corday, and the revolutionary fervour she incited within him, led the Marquis straight to the gallows.
I was finally taken into the care of an old friend of the Marquis de Luso.
Your grandfather, Madame Duchess,
Raymond de Montfort...
Whom I did not ever know...
He welcomed me like a son.
And your father, Benoit de Montfort, like a brother...
Benoit and I grew up together.
We discovered together, little by little, the mysteries of Nature,
We both fell in love the same day with the same young lady.
Blanche de Clermont.
A descendant of kings, she was the most modest and most beautiful of all...
My mother, Blanche de Montfort...
I did not ever know her, either.
She was the most beautiful and the most modest...
To us, she was an angel, who had fallen to earth, among men who could not speak the language of Heaven...
Both of us had stolen a scarf from her, secretly, without the other knowing.
They accompanied us, close against our hearts, through every campaign we led together under the Emperor's command.
Montebello, Malta, Alexandria,
Aboukir...
Up to Portugal, as far as Buçaco, with Masséna...
There, we both saved a man, s life together...
A man who would eventually be the ruin of Benoit and Blanche.
Colonel Ernest Lacroze.
Hoist the flag, in front!
Halt!
To the left, turn!
To the rear! March!
Halt!
To the left, turn!
Prepare arms!
Aim!
Fire!
Ready,
Aim!
Long live the Emperor!
Colonel Ernest Lacroze, of the Imperial Guard.
Five minutes more and our heads would have been placed on a stake.
I owe you my life, gentlemen.
And I will never forget it...
Nurse, quickly!
Come quickly, Nurse!
He lay between life and death.
During the entire time our troops were retreating from Portugal, after the defeats of Buçaco and Torres Vedras...
Benoit de Montfort spent every free moment he had by his side... to the point of making me jealous...
He ended up convincing him to come with us to the castle during his recovery.
Thus building with his own hands, the tragedy which was soon to come...
Benoit, come look!
You look like the spy we caught behind the lines, in Aboukir.
With the same assassin's gaze!
Your guest has a curious way of repaying your hospitality...
He spends his days with Blanche!
Soon, he'll be spending his nights with her, too...
What a thought! That's absurd!
He does it out of kindness.
Out of gratitude, really.
How naive, Benoit!
What a ridiculous thought!
Wake up, in the name of God!
Open your eyes, you idiot, open your eyes!
Idiot.
Where did Benoit go?
I think he's in there.
Were you jealous, Father?
I was by far the more jealous of the two of us.
My Lusitanian blood, no doubt...
But it didn't take long for Benoit to surpass my jealousy.
It's true I never missed an opportunity to draw his attention to Blanche and Ernest's behaviour.
I don't see Mademoiselle Blanche...
I wouldn't want to go without bidding her farewell. Did you warn her?
I told her you were leaving, yes.
But she feared she might not be able to come.
Some story about dresses ordered in Angouleme...
Women!
She should have left this morning with her father.
But all of this is unimportant.
I will convey your respects to her.
A shame.
In fact, I scribbled a small note just in case I didn't see her.
To thank her for the kindness of her hospitality and for her company.
Would you be so kind?
Of course, you can count on me.
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you for everything.
I will not forget Buçaco. And l will always remember Montfort.
Little by little, Benoít's jealousy became obsessive.
Under the pretext of being helpful, he kept trying to convince the
Emperor to give Colonel Lacroze the command of a garrison lost at the far end of Calabría.
Far from everything.
And, most of all, from Blanche...
Careful, Jerome, don't set the castle on fire!
No danger, my commander.
Even the English, couldn't manage burning it down.
It was made the old-fashioned way.
It won't catch fire.
Blanche,
The departure of Ernest Lacroze did not cause many consequences
Come see
Come see
Only that from then on, instead of the colonel,
It was Benoít who monopolized her company...
There he is, spying on us.
You ought to kiss me, just to make him burst with jealousy.
Come closer!
I don't want him to die.
And I don't want to kiss you.
I resigned myself, little by little, to the fact that they would end up getting married.
And though that made me suffer, it was more bearable than thinking she might marry someone else.
A foreigner.
Like Ernest Lacroze or worse!
You are tired, Father.
Would you like to rest?
No, my girl, it's not fatigue...
It's the pain of recalling that moment... when Benoit de Montfort sold his soul in exchange for Blanche de Clermont...
It was on that day that everything changed.
It was then that he decided to sacrifice everything.
His friends, his honour. And with one sole purpose. to have Blanche.
Later, I learned that he had intercepted all the letters, that colonel Lacroze had sent to Blanche.
Have you not heard more news of Colonel Lacroze?
No.
That's strange.
Don't you think?
What's strange about it?
Military life is like that, you know.
Made up of meetings and separations.
Today here, tomorrow over there.
From battle to battle, garrison to garrison, country to country...
For them it's best not to become attached to anything.
That was not how I saw him.
Quite the contrary.
He left me the memory of a man faithful in friendship, dedicated, sincere, attentive, and accountable...
Enough, that's sufficient, stop!
That is not a man, you describe.
That is a "Prince Charming"!
Instead, admit that he courted you.
That is to say, he played the role he thought would be best to seduce you.
It's true. he courted me.
But he wasn't playing any role.
I was overtaken by the desire to return to Portugal, to strengthen my bond with the country of my ancestors, which I had until now, only glimpsed.
But I was in no hurry.
I used the occasion to get to know
France better.
And to sell off the few possessions
I owned here and there...
The months went by.
I found myself in Bordeaux, when I received news that Blanche had just given birth to twins.
You, madame Duchess, and your brother, Arthur.
I couldn't resist the temptation to return.
Good old Sebastiao!
I knew you'd come back.
They all end up coming back sooner or later.
She will as well, you'll see.
Your room is just as you had left it.
Get yourself settled in.
But it's best if you take your bag up yourself.
We are lacking staff at the moment...
Oh!
Old Raymond has passed away.
In his sleep. He didn't suffer.
I inherited his armchair.
It's quite practical.
You'll have to try it.
And Blanche?
And the children?...
Madame de Montfort makes her home apart from mine.
She's with the children.
When she got pregnant, she moved into the hunting lodge.
It seems this whole business was too painful to her.
Well, that is what she says.
But I know the real reason...
It's there that they meet.
Who?
She meets with the living-dead.
I saw him.
But whom?
Whom did you see?
The brave colonel.
Lacroze?
The fearless suicide.
I saw him alive!
Where?
Right near here.
I will show you tonight.
But sit down, sit down.
Tell me your stories...
Later.
Right now I’m going to see Blanche, and the children.
I’ll be right back.
That's it, go ahead!
Go on, go and see them!
Sebastiao!
Come.
You can do me a big favour.
Take off my boots for me.
What?
My boots.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I am a friend of Madame de Montfort's...
Madame is not here.
She has gone to see her father.
She will only be back tonight.
Ls he one of the twins?
Oh, no, this one here, he's mine.
The children are with Madame.
Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Benoit! Benoit!
Madame? Where is she?
Sir! She is inside.
I haven't seen her...
And the children?
The children stayed with
Madame's father!
She died in my arms, she never regained consciousness.
She hadn't the slightest trace of burns on her entire body.
If you ever speak to my wife again.
I’ll smash you like a worm.
Knife-eater!
Remember Knife-eater,
Alberto de Magalhaes!
Remember the assassin!
Brother...
All right, brother...
Thank you, brother.
You're welcome, brother.
I’m no brother to any little priest.
What was this miracle, Father?
Renounce your vengeance, Duchess.
It can only lead you into despair.
Go back to France.
Forgive and forget.
I will do what you want, Father Dinis.
I will go back to France tomorrow.
But, I do not forgive.
I do not forget.
I do not renounce.
Upon my return to Lisbon,
I paid a visit to my neighbor, the Víscount of Armagnac, in the hopes of distractíng myself from the obsession that had tormented me.
Unfortunately, I was introduced to one of his young friends,
Pedro da Sílva, a Portuguese gentleman who would re-immerse me, even further...
I thought you were still in Paris, my dear Viscount.
I arrived just two days ago,
Duchess.
If you please.
I had intended to go and pay you my respects today even...
I shall receive you with pleasure.
Sit down.
Oh, no, I don, t have time.
To make up for it, however, can I count on you for tea?
I shall not miss it.
Your friend will be welcome, of course.
Who is she?
Elisa de Montfort. Duchesse de Cliton.
A neighbour.
She's lived as a recluse in Montfort for the past three years.
She practically never leaves the castle.
This is the first time
I’ve seen her outdoors.
She doesn't visit anyone.
She doesn't receive a living soul.
And she dresses in black...
A romantic?...
I would say more melancholic than romantic...
Melancholic. Why?
The secrets of a proud and offended woman.
A fatal passion?
This is what they say
In her youth, she had been one of the ornaments in Charles X's salons.
It was the King himself who wed her to the Duke of Cliton...
She is married?
Oh, not quite.
The duke soon left her a widow and in ruin.
They said that afterwards she found a mysterious man, a foreigner...
A shadowy story that ended with the death of her twin brother in a duel.
After which, she came here...
Isolated. Alone.
Always sad.
Like the character in a novel by Radcliffe.
I can't wait to see her again.
Let's go then, my dear Pedro.
I wouldn't want you to die of impatience...
Thank you.
No, no, no! No!
Such rain!
To think that it was the blue sky that you had promised me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me,
I’ll go see what is going on.
Excuse me...
I’m sorry.
I don't feel very well.
I’m going to have to leave you.
We must leave.
Let's go?
I’ll explain you later.
Don't deny it.
I’m sure she found me provincial, awkward, spiritless...
On the contrary, my dear Pedro.
I am convinced that you interest and intrigue her.
The looks she gave you while you weren't looking...
They don, t deceive!
Come in.
She merely addressed a single word toward me.
Exactly. To provoke you.
There is nothing like the feigned indifference of a women to excite a man's desire.
I see your eyes in the warm twilight...
Shit...
I see...
I see your eyes in the twilight warm
Shit... for a week, it rained constantly.
And no news of the Duchess of Cliton, although I thought of her day and night...
Fallen into oblivion...
No, No!
Policarpo, help me.
« I saw your eyes in the cold twilight.
It was in a sad and morbid castle.
At the top of a staircase, one day when forgetfuIness had taken everything away except for your stern gaze...
But what a charming thing, seeing your limpid eyes in the castle night.
Our livid bed, I am wounded by the menacing stare of the sad and watchful pupils in your eyes?
I suddenly see the solitary figure of a lunar and yawning woman, who rises, so dignified, from the waters. »
I spent hours there, hoping to see her leave, not knowing if I'd have the courage to approach her...
And without daring to knock on that door...
I finally couldn't resist,
I brought her the sonnet
I had decided not to show her.
That's what youth is all about.
Naivety and arrogance.
She returned it to me the same day, with a short note...
« I am returning your verses to you.
Give them to someone your own age who deserves them much more than l.
It would be unusual for any man of mine to have a pure enough soul to understand them.»
The pain, the humiliation, were unbearable...
Come in!
I wanted to die, to run away, to disappear forever...
Madame de Montfort.
Forgive me!
I am unforgivable.
I didn't want to offend you,
I swear. Pardon me.
How could I do that to you?
Tell me you'll forgive me.
Forgive you?
It is I who should be asking forgiveness from you!...
To think that I dared
I didn't want to, believe me...
No, no! It's me alone!
It is I who am unforgivable!
No, no! It's me alone!
It is I who am unforgivable!
Don't say that, I beg you!
But you are soaked!
How long have you been in the rain?
Come in, sit down, please.
No, I can't.
So, it's here that you write your poems?
How charming...
What is that?
A gift from my mother.
It's pretty.
Wait! I have an idea!
Come to the castle this evening.
At whatever time you want.
I will be waiting for you.
I’ll explain everything, you'll see...
And bring the poem.
I beg you. Bring it to me.
To prove to me that you forgave me...
Mister da Silva has arrived.
Thank you.
I must leave.
He thinks I am at Angouleme.
Go out through there.
I saw you outside, in the rain and I burned with the desire to call you, to go find you, to shelter you in my arms...
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you call me?
Because I didn't know if I had the right...
Who would refuse it?
You are free, Elisa.
As free as I am.
No, Pedro, I’m not free.
I’m a prisoner of the scruples of my conscience and the stain I have on my heart.
I don't have the right to be yours.
I don't understand you.
You talk in riddles.
You're so young!
Your verses are so innocent, so clear, so pure...
They made me feel so bad...
Elisa! Not nasty!
One could make you sad.
But not nasty!
My poor Pedro, if you knew!...
If you knew the desires of death, the thirst for blood that fill me for nights on end!
The wishes for vengeance that suffocate my heart to the point of preventing it from beating,
Or allowing myself to be paralyzed for days...
In the darkest despair and impotent rage...
That is how I have lived for years, Pedro.
Since the day they robbed me of my honour, and of the life of my only brother.
This man...
This foreigner?
They spoke to you about him!
They told you...
Vaguely.
They told you he is Portuguese, like you?
No!
What is his name?
He has had many names.
Right now, he calls himself
Alberto de Magalhaes.
Despite my insistence,
Elísa categorically refused to give anymore details about the shadowy story that had destroyed her life,
Yet as the night went on, it became ever clearer to me that that man's existence was the only obstacle to unhappiness...
When the day came, my decision had been made,
I would return to Lisbon to avenge the honour of the Duchess of Cliton and the death of her only brother...
Back at the estate, a letter from
Portugal awaited me, announcing the death of my mother, victim of a cholera epidemic that had spread throughout the country.
By the cruel irony of fortune, my decision to return to Lisbon was now painfully justified.
Yes?
There is a gentlemen here with a foreign air
He says he is an emissary on behalf of Artur de Montfort.
He says he is an emissary on behalf of Artur de Montfort.
He wrote his name here...
What kind of bad joke is this?
Ls your Excellency the emissary of Artur de Montfort?
I am!
Artur de Montfort!!
He died nine years ago!
Indeed!
Then I gather your Excellency has come from the other world!
Are things well around there?
There the murderers rest...
Here, the murderers await their hour...
I came precisely to demand that the murderer of Artur de Montfort answers me on the field of honour, with weapons in hand.
Demand!
With what right?
You probably never knew poor Artur.
You couldn't have been more than ten years old when he left us...
But perhaps you know his sister,
Elisa de Montfort, the Duchess of Cliton...
Am I mistaken?
I have no intention of talking about my personal acquaintances...
I already told you why I have come.
I leave the choice of arms up to you...
And I await your response.
Very well!
If you insist!
I’m just going to send you my witnesses.
That is, if you'd be so kind as to give me your address!
It's written on the card
I had sent to you...
The Isidro, an excellent hotel!
A wise choice...
Come here!
Arms!
Considering that neither of us had yet been wounded, upon my insistence and despite
Alberto's resistance, it was decided to continue our duel with pistols...
Unfortunately, my dear friend, one cannot duck bullets the way one ducks a sword.
One of us will end up staying here forever.
Isn't that the idea?
In theory, yes!
And given that I can't dissuade you to put a stop to this nonsense,
I find myself forced to suggest that we have other means placed at our disposal.
I don't understand.
You will understand...
I’m talking about where
I should give the money that Father Dinis left me to administer on your behalf.
On my behalf?
Father Dinis...
You knew him?
Strange, some things in life...
I knew Father Dinis.
And I knew you, Don Pedro.
I practically saw you being born...
I fear my dear gentlemen...
I feel we must change the agenda...
I’ve just spoken to my valiant opponent, and told him some things that have changed his mind about continuing this duel.
If he agrees, I propose to postpone this duel for a later date.
If it's not considered dishonourable on my part...
No. Not at all...
Isn't that true, gentlemen.
Come out from there, Don Pedro.
Suddenly, I felt lost.
I was once again the João of Father Dínís's college, before I ever found my mother or knew my name, or my history.
A mere puppet, manipulated by invisible hands at the mercy of some other will...
I didn’t know what to do, or what decision to make.
Everything he had told me was more than convincing, as it corresponded point by point to what I already knew,
From Father Dínís's intervention to save my life to the role played by Alberto himself in defending the reputation of my mother against her slanderers...
But despite my insistence, he refused to reveal the origin of the fortune he administered on my behalf, at the request of Father Dínís.
I met Elisa de Montfort, in Paris, at a time when nothing could make me resist satisfying my whims.
She had just lost the husband who had decimated her fortune.
She was, in those days, a dangerous woman who acted like she wanted to avenge herself in life, and would use romance to crush the self-esteem of several men and several women.
It was said she had provoked six duels.
To me at the time, she was an irresistible challenge...
It started as a frivolous game, and ended as a sordid bourgeois drama...
You wanted to see me?
I am at your disposal.
Just now, I heard you say that... every man has his price.
Do you truly believe that?
Yes, I believe it.
That makes you laugh.
Bonaparte thought the same thing and that didn't go too well for him.
I wasn't talking about politics.
Nor of war.
Even less.
So, what were you talking about?
I was talking about business.
And of love.
Yes...of love.
You mean to say that
I also have a price?
Yes Madame.
How much?
Fifty thousand.
Ls that all?
In that case, for only one day...
One night.
One hundred thousand.
Eighty.
Done!
I will bring the contract this afternoon.
Even now, I still ask myself if she accepted the challenge out of a real passion for the game, or merely for the love of money.
I had the contract written up and sent it to her.
She came that same night to my hotel...
If you please, Madame.
The contract. Signed.
She returned the signed contract to me, and left the next morning with the 80 thousand francs which I had most discretely placed in her bag.
The game should have ended there.
But she returned the next night, and the one after that, and the one after that...
After a week she wanted to give me my money back.
For her it was no longer a game,
It became serious...
I refused.
At that time, the most serious thing was precisely the game...
I changed hotels, she found me,
I gave orders for her not to be allowed to enter, and she left me the 80 thousand francs at the reception desk, with a note I never read.
I sent these back and moved again, this time to an obscure inn in a populated neighbourhood.
Stop, please!
I’ll walk from here.
In desperation, she sent her twin brother,
Artur de Montfort,
And since then, she regularly sends someone no matter where I am, with the mission of her vengeance.
The last time, she came herself;
I guess that with time, the thirst for vengeance became her only reason to live...
At her grave, I couldn't even cry for my mother, whom I had seen so little while she lived,
Angela de Lima,
Countess of Santa Barbara, rested in an anonymous grave, together with scores of wretches victims like herself, of the cholera epidemic... ls someone there?
Her poor name was not anywhere to be seen.
Can I help you?
Oh, sir, please...
Are we in the eastern part of the cemetery?
Yes...We're in the right place...
It's here...
Thank you very much.
I’m looking for the mausoleum where my daughter is...
Mausoleum?
My friends assure me it is monumental.
My friends say it is the most beautiful in the entire cemetery...
I'm unable to see it.
With the last money left from my fortune,
I had this mausoleum built...
Would you be so kind as to describe it to me?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I don't know if, I would be able...
I am the Marquis of Montezelos.
What is your name?
I am a simple student, Marquis... my mother died and
I came to visit her...
So your mother is also in a mausoleum, right?
No, Marquis, my mother is in a common pauper's grave...
Poor woman.
Had I mentioned to you that
I was a bad father?
No. I hadn't.
This head of mine, and now, as you see I am a beggar, and now that we, re having this conversation, would you happen to have a small coin, for the love of God?
Of course...
Thank you very much...
Marquis, your friends are waiting for you...
Poor Marquis.
He's lost his mind...
The accident...
He had an accident?
It wasn't, an accident... more of a failed suicide attempt...
His daughter, s dishonour...
What to us, are the things of life, are enormous tragedies to the nobility...
He fired the shot as they left the Mass.
He didn't kill himself, but he was blinded.
He wasted away the fortune and people were moved by this sadness.
They were moved by a beggar Marquis and still give him a lot of money.
That's the blessing of beggars...
Even in disgrace, the nobles are favored.
And the mausoleum?
The mausoleum doesn't exist.
It was an invention of the Marquis...
Where are you, Manuel?
I’m here, Marquis.
I’ll be right there!
Please excuse me...
I've heard that Alberto de Magalhaes has enjoyed excellent health.
You lacked courage my dear.
And l, whose heart you once possessed...
My life no longer made any sense.
My only thought was to disappear, to lose myself quickly, completely, and without a trace...
I caught the first boat I found, bound for Tangiers, which allowed me to board for the coins
I still had in my pocket...
One soon discovers that it is not difficult to disappear from the eyes of others, but that our own eyes follow us wherever we go.
I continued to travel randomly, aimlessly, to lose myself.
I don't know how, but the representatives of Alberto Magalhaes never lost my trail and I continued to regularly receive the money intended for me.
My footsteps have finally led me here.
I don't think I can go any further.
My condition doesn't allow me many illusions.
Excuse me, could you kindly direct me to an inn that is far from the center of town?
That won't be easy.
Most of our inns are right in the center.
In that case, I’ll have to settle for the closest.
This is the closest.
Thank you.
I was fifteen years old and I didn't know who I was at all...
Sometimes, the others would ask me if I was Father Dinis' son,
I didn't know how to answer them.
They all had surnames...
Four, five, even more...
I was just "João".
Unlike the others,
I never went on outings, nor had holidays, nor presents.
I don't know how long had passed between the time I lost consciousness... and the moment
I opened my eyes again...
I thought I had dreamt it all.
Dona Antonia...
Dona Antonia...
Help him lie down.
Father Dinis!
He is cold.
Do you want to hear a romantic story?
It was World War ll.
He was young, 22, 23, paratrooper, tough son of a bitch.
They were being dropped somewhere over France.
His chute was damaged by enemy fire, and he lost control and landed on the roof of a house in the middle of the country.
I guess he got injured somehow,
I think from the hard landing from the hole in his chute.
Anyway, the man that lived in the house had a beautiful young daughter who nursed him back to health.
And after a few days, he left to rejoin his unit, but not before telling her that he would be back for her.
Eight months later, he returned... and he's been with my grandmother ever since.
Beautiful story, huh?
Romantic, right?
Yeah, romantic.
He said that he would be here.
I... I told him this morning.
Well, why don't you give him a call again?
I'll handle another patient, and I'm sure he'll be here when I come back.
Oh, my God!
You're unfucking believable.
I'm gonna come so fucking hard.
Oh, God!
Fuck!
Oh, my God, yeah!
Don't... Don't... Don't...
Don't swallow it.
Hmm? Don't swallow it.
No, don't... don't spit it out.
Spit it in here, baby.
You turn me on.
I gotta go.
Early this morning, local volunteers gathered to work with police in combing a huge area down by the shipyards for any signs of
10-year-old Christie Dillon.
But later in the day, police once again found themselves reaching out to the public for help in this unsettling case.
We believe the perpetrator snuck into the bedroom window and took her while the family was asleep.
Detective, one more question, please.
You've been questioning a neighbor by the name of Roger Beckworth.
Is he a suspect?
No.
I already told you Mr. Beckworth is merely a person of interest.
Now, that's all I have for you today.
All I ask is that if anybody sees Christie Dillon or knows anything about her whereabouts, to please contact 911 so we can get her back here where she belongs, at home with her family.
Thank you.
Detective, I just need to know... is there any other suspect?
Frankie... so you still want to keep two black-and-whites in front of the house?
Yeah, and, uh... keep the reporters off the damn lawn, okay?
Right. Right.
All right, Barbara Walters, that's enough.
Let's go. Off the lawn.
I got here as soon as I could.
I'm so sorry.
I got caught up with a new client.
I called your cell phone.
I know. The battery's dead.
I forgot to charge it.
Why are you crying?
You're 40 minutes late, Ryan!
I know. I...
I got stuck with a client. I...
I told you I'm sorry, but I'm here now, a-and we're here now.
You did it already?
In the car. In the parking lot.
In the parking lot?
Yeah.
You know I get nervous in doctors' offices.
I just wanted to make sure that I had a good sample.
Ah, Ryan, you made it.
Yes.
- And I see you have your sample already.
- I do.
Well, let's get started.
We're praying for you.
Thank you.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Good.
Well, that's good.
Still getting your weekly tests, right?
Good, 'cause your parents aren't backing down.
They want him, and they're gonna say that you're not fit to care for him.
They want him in a home.
He doesn't want to go there.
Well, we've done everything that we can to establish that you're a responsible caregiver, so who... uh, who's assigned to us for this?
Michael Ambrose.
He's fair.
He's gonna listen to us, and that's really all that you can ask for in a mediator.
I know it sounds really cold.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why don't I come over to your place the night before?
We'll prepare.
Okay...
I hate... being obligated to talk to people just because it's polite.
I hate... people who say that money doesn't matter, because it does.
I hate laugh tracks.
I hate people who don't think that there are two Americas.
I hate when you bite into an onion ring and the onion comes out, but then you're left with this fried bread tube thing.
I hate how I always think that I have a booger hanging out of my nose, and I'm constantly trying not to touch my nose so that...
I just... I always feel like there's a booger that's there, that's dangling there when I'm talking to people, and...
I hate it.
I hate people who don't use pictures of themselves on Facebook.
MIX
DID YOU LOSE THIS DOG'?
Uh, sorry. I, um...
I think I hit something over here!
Found her bed empty and the screen on her window removed
Right now, neither of her parents are considered suspects by the authorities, but there is some interest being paid to a neighbor.
Thanks, Leslie.
Prepare for the heat wave to contin...
Ready to go, buddy?
One of us has gotta lose some weight.
And Paris Hilton.
I fucking hate that bitch.
And... And hairy moles on people's faces.
You know, I just want to grab that catfish whisker and just rip it right off of their chin.
Jesus Christ.
And rotator cuffs.
I hate them.
I tore mine three years ago, and it still hurts.
And I hate...
I hate black people.
I hate the way that they talk in movies.
I mean, it's got to bug the shit out of you, too, right?
Hey, what time do you guys want to practice tonight?
I thought you guys were
DJing at Jones tonight.
Nah, it's tomorrow.
I got plans.
That old married guy tonight?
He's not that old.
But he is that married.
Man, from here, he just seems like somebody's dad.
I got a feeling he's a little bit more than just that.
- Mr. Beckworth.
- Hi.
I'm Detective Frankie Graylin.
I know. I've seen you on TV.
Great. So let's, uh, talk about why you're here.
Right.
As you know, with your permission, we searched your truck, and we found a strand of hair that belonged to Christie Dillon.
Right.
I know you already gave an explanation, but I'd like to hear it again.
Okay...
About, um... three weeks ago,
I went to the park at the end of my street to eat my lunch, and I saw Christie there with one of her friends.
I think her name was Heather.
And, anyway, Christie was, uh, sort of helping, uh, support, carry Heather, who's limping.
Christie looked, uh, a little overwhelmed
'cause they had a couple of bikes with 'em.
And where were you? On a bench?
No, no, no. I was...
I was eating my lunch in my truck, you know, facing the softball field.
Okay...
So, you know,
I got out of my truck, and, uh, you know,
I asked Christie if she, you know, needed some help.
And you know her? Knew her?
Oh, sure, yeah.
No, I've known Christie and her family since Christie was little.
You know, I've been over their house you know, to a holiday party a couple times.
We do a big block party on the Fourth of July.
It's a great neighborhood.
- I get it.
- Good. Right. Okay.
So, uh, it turns out that Christie's friend, uh, her ankle was banged up pretty bad from falling off her bike, so, uh,
I loaded their bikes in the back of my truck, and I took the girls back to Christie's house.
And had Christie ever been in your truck before?
Uh, no.
No, that was the first and, uh, the only time.
Oh. Ls there a...
Are you currently in a relationship or...
No, I'm not.
Uh, you know, my wife and I, you know, we got divorced, like, 15 years ago, and, uh, you know, I've had a couple of relationships on and off since then, but nothing too serious the last year or so, so...
How about you?
A-Are you seeing anybody, Frankie?
No, I'm currently not in a relationship.
Well, uh...
This is probably really inappropriate, but, you know, after all this, you know, blows over,
I mean, when you guys find Christie, maybe you and I, we could... we could have dinner or, you know, we could...
Wow, that was inappropriate.
Yes, it was very inappropriate.
I'm sorry. It's... I'm sorry.
It's you're very attractive.
That was dumb. It was dumb.
- Look, it's...
- No, it was dumb.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.
Okay...
It's all right.
Oh, God.
You know, actually I-I'm very flattered,
- but let's just leave it alone.
- Okay.
All right. Uh, I think we're done here for today.
Uh, can I... Am I done?
Yes. I will send somebody in with your release papers.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Oh, God.
Ah, fuck.
You know how fast you were going?
No. I'm sorry, officer.
I thought I was going the speed limit.
No. You were going 39 in a 25-mile-per-hour zone.
License and registration, please?
Right.
Okay...
You startled me.
That was so quick.
Well, I... I didn't mean to scare you.
Look, this is... this is the end of a school zone here, you know, which means that there are a lot of kids around, playing, you know.
Sometimes they don't pay much attention to traffic.
You know, they might just jump right out from behind a parked car to chase down an overthrown football or something, and, the speed you're going, you're not... you're not gonna have time to... to brake.
You know, so...
So just, you know, for everyone's sake, slow down next time, okay?
You're not gonna give me a ticket?
Thank you.
Thank you so much, officer.
I will totally be more careful from now on.
Okay...
You have a good day.
Thank you. You, too.
Hey, Mrs. Harrison.
Oh, Jerry, honey,
I got something for you.
Um, how've you been?
Oh, I'm good. I'm good.
Here.
That's homemade brisket with mashed potatoes and green beans.
You look like you don't eat, so I made you a plate.
Oh, you didn't have to. It's...
Of course I did.
It's not every day you graduate from the police academy.
Oh, I'd have brought it a couple of weeks ago, but I haven't been feeling well, and I didn't want to take...
No, no, don't worry about that.
It's... It's very, very sweet of you.
Thank you very much.
- Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
- Oh. Carter.
Hey.
You know, you may want to add a little salt to that, because I use lemon juice instead of salt.
Police are still refusing to refer to Mr. Beckworth as a suspect, but public pressure may force them to do that soon.
In Hawthorne today, an elderly man...
Dude, where you been?
Raid starts in three minutes.
Sorry. Parent-teacher meeting.
God, and... he ate the whole thing.
- After he said it was-
- Yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you.
I have not laughed like that in months.
Oh, how's Ryan?
Great.
And everything else?
Well, we're gonna do in vitro this week.
- That's great.
- Yep.
And, uh, Ryan's been very supportive, uh, but it's a... it's a process.
Um, it's just we're both very committed to it, which makes it easier... normal.
Hey, look who's on TV.
You think he's guilty?
I know he is.
I mean, she's like Tina's age.
I mean, this fucking job, it's like a looking glass into the soul of this world.
I mean, it's scary raising kids here.
We have to lie to them about everything.
There's so many bad things, bad people, and sometimes I wonder why we try so hard when we're so clearly outnumbered.
Oh, you know, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...
- No.
- It's...
No, it's fine.
Drink.
- Yes.
- Cheers.
Here's to pain.
Hey.
Hey. Still outwith Frankie?
Yeah. I'm just about finished, though.
- Great. Tell her hello for me.
- Okay.
See you at home in an hour?
Hello? Ryan, are you there?
Yeah. Yeah, uh...
I lost you for a second.
What'd you say?
I said I will meet you at home in an hour. Okay?
Might be a little bit later.
I got to swing by Mom's.
Oh, um, okay.
Um, I'll see you after.
I'll see you in a bit.
I love you.
Me, too.
Okay, 10 miles.
How do you feel?
I feel...
I feel pretty good, actually
Ah, Christ,
I'm sweating like a rapist.
And you, you haven't even broken a sweat yet.
Here we go. There.
Now at least you look like you've been running.
A-Are you Drew Callahan?
Taylor Reese.
I was friends with Erik.
We played football together in high school.
I was the one that threw him all those touchdowns.
Remember that?
I think I met you, um, our senior year after that game against Drake.
You have to remember that one.
It was a real barnburner.
- Right, yeah.
- State championship.
Taylor, right.
Sorry, uh, kind of pathetic, a 35-year-old guy reliving his high school glory.
No, it's, uh...
Well, listen, it was really good seeing you.
Uh, if you see your brother Erik, let him...
Here. Give me...
Uh, hope everything's going good for you.
Say hi to Erik for me.
So have you heard from your dad lately?
Yeah, I talked to him about a week ago.
Oh, you should talk to him more often.
I spoke to him yesterday.
I think he might be coming home for Christmas this year.
Has he said anything to you about that?
Uh, no, he didn't... he didn't say anything.
Hmm. Well, it really will be a merry Christmas if he can just get all that stuff from that estate finalized and get home.
Maybe by then, you and Kate'll have a special gift on the way, and then, you know, it'll be a perfect Christmas.
Why are you listening to Christmas music?
Oh, because it's beautiful... happy, makes me happy.
It's June.
Christmas is six months away, Mom.
Well, why should I wait six months to be happy?
You are relentless in the way
That you ask me
So many questions of my days
In the calm city of my days
In the city
You are relentless in the way
That you ask...
Ask me
So many questions of my days
How's your mom?
Other than the fact my dad told her he might be coming home for Christmas, terrific.
Your dad's coming home for Christmas?
Of course not, Kate.
It's been nine years.
He's never coming back.
I don't know why my mother can't get that through her skull!
I win. I win
I've got the most fucked-up parents on the planet.
My mother's an idiot.
He lies to her, Ryan.
He's the one you should be angry with.
He tells her that he's dealing with his parents' estate.
He tells her that the French government is screwing everything up.
He tells her that his... his heart problem prohibits him from flying.
For nine years!
Who believes that?
I know. I get it.
It's not exactly...
Normal.
Practical.
She believes what she wants to believe, what she needs to believe in order to survive.
The results came back from Dr. Klein.
Your sperm passed the test.
Great.
At least my cum's got its shit together.
Yeah.
So, um, we can have sex tonight.
Um, then no sex for 48 hours, but, uh, we can tonight if you want.
You don't have to.
I'm okay.
I'm fine, good to go.
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'll be upstairs.
Hi.
Hey, how are you doing this morning?
Good.
Uh, chocolate sugar twist, three dough nut holes and a black coffee.
Yeah.
Earlier this evening, family, friends and supporters gathered for a vigil for the missing girl.
Anybody watching this?
As far as Fresno came, bringing flowers...
Good.
Just want to check the Dodger highlights.
Two on and two outs.
And Johnson's first hit, and laces it into the gap in left center field.
Parilla scores, Revie scores, and Hudson hasn't...
All right, so we've left
Maggie in the park, right?
And she's got her one-year-old, and they're in the stroller, and as they're walking to the playground, she sees this really hot black couple.
African-American.
We have an African-American president, Archie Bunker.
Okay, all right.
Well, I didn't vote for him.
So, uh, anyway, this super-hot
African-American couple has got a ridiculously cute
African-American baby also in a stroller, and as the two groups approach each other, you know, they're oohing and ahhing over the babies and saying the other one's cuter and all this stuff, and, uh, Maggie asks how old her son is, and she gets down in front of the stroller and says, "Hi, little monkey!"
No, okay, come on.
Bear with... This really happened to my wife.
M-My wife really did this.
Um, and so right after
Maggie says this, she gets that hilarious look on her face, you know, and she immediately turns to her son and goes, "And here's my little monkey." You know?
And she's so embarrassed that she just calls everything- man, woman, child, animal... everything's a monkey.
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.
She just keeps saying everything's a monkey, and the other couple, I mean, they're just kind of backing away from her, you know, not sure.
What do you think?
I didn't know your wife was such a racist.
Shut up, Allan.
Wh-What do you think?
Allie?
It's great.
I think it's kind of funny.
Is it... Is it too offensive?
I don't think so.
Were you even listening?
Yeah. I just... I don't get why you're asking me.
Come on, Allie.
Are you serious?
I mean, you're the only black... uh, the only African-American writer in the room.
Way to point out the obvious, Bill.
I just don't get why you would think that I would know if that's bad or not.
It's a misunderstanding.
It's funny.
Anybody who thinks that's racist is probably some uptight black asshole who wishes somebody would call him a monkey so he could complain about it.
Finding reasons to complain is just another form of laziness, and honestly I don't have the time or the tolerance for it.
You do know those lids come off, right?
Thank you, class.
You did good.
See you tomorrow.
Mr. Aston.
Yeah, Tina?
Um, you know how you were talking about that... talking about
Martin Luther King last week and how he, you know, put himself in harm's way so that others could have a better life?
Sure do.
Well, my mom and I went online and read some more about him.
Really?
Yeah, and, um, it made me sad what happened to him.
I was wondering, do you think the world would have been a better place if he hadn't been killed?
I don't know, but it sure became a better place because he was alive.
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
Well, thanks for telling us about him.
Sure.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Do you love her?
Love? I'm starting to think that I, uh...
I'm not so certain what that word means.
You know, intellectually I do, but... intimate love...
I seem to have emotionally forgotten what that means.
She's like my mom.
They just insulate themselves from reality.
It's like they're looking at life through a windshield, so thick that they could watch a nuclear explosion.
I don't even have a glass in mine... and the Wind's whipping me and making my eyes teary, and I can barely even keep them open.
- Great choices.
- Thanks.
I love this dress.
Did you see the adorable little shoes that go with it?
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.
How cute are these?
Very. I'll get those, too.
Okay, great.
Are these gifts?
Um... uh, this one is.
Okay. Your daughter's gonna look so cute in this dress.
Uh, hey, sorry.
Excuse me.
You don't happen to know whose dog this is, do you?
No. Sorry.
Well, It's just that
I found it in the street running around the other day.
It didn't have a collar or anything.
She's cute.
You should keep her.
Wait. It's a girl?
Yes.
You might want to make sure she's fixed.
Right, make sure she's neutered.
Spayed. Boys get neutered.
Spayed, not neutered.
- No.
- No.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.
Okay, thanks.
Everyone's here.
We're good to go.
Gonzo, you're the main tank.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Remember this guy heals, so get ready.
Today marks the fourth day since little Christie Dillon's disappearance.
Her father Paul held a news conference out in front of his house to defend himself against accusations that he somehow may have been involved.
Gonz, you want it?
Uh, yeah.
Jim, use your fire magic, dude!
All right, I got it! I got it!
Dragging their feet in this investigation.
On Capitol Hill today...
Watch your flank!
Watch your flank!
- It's on your six!
- Shit.
- Uh, I, uh...
- Unbelievable!
You're thinking about the princess!
She was taken from her home.
We can't just leave her there.
- Dude, you just wiped the raid!
- Jesus, Gonz!
We need to focus up!
I have to leave, help the princess.
What? You can't!
If you do that, you're out for good!
Where are you going?
Come on, dude. He's an asshole.
Get rid of him.
Here we go! Come on!
W-Where is he going?
How are we gonna heal without him?
Come on! That's insane!
We're finally gonna get this guy!
I can't believe this.
We're gonna have to start this level all over!
I lost my job at the magazine three months ago.
I don't know. The, um...
The pressure of work and taking care of him... it just got to me.
Everyone thinks he's brain-dead... except me.
And I know he's not because of the way he looks at me sometimes.
I know he's in there, and that's why I... we gotta do this race.
He always wanted to run that fucking thing.
He's run every other major city marathon in the country.
This was from his last race, the San Francisco Marathon.
He placed in the top
30th percentile.
Somehow I don't think we're gonna do that good this time.
We're gonna finish it.
We're gonna finish it.
Yeah. No, I understand what you're saying.
Oh, Christ.
I thought that we had gotten past that, Greg.
You're clinging to this theory like a frigging flat-Earther.
It doesn't hold water.
You can't expect me to believe that her parents think that she would intentionally hurt Erik.
Well, that is absolutely crazy talk.
Fine.
Bring it to the arbitrator.
Let him decide.
Yeah. Yeah.
She's sober.
Her tests come back negative every week.
That means she's clean.
Oh, fine.
No, I don't have anything else.
Thank you for being so fucking reasonable, Greg!
I hope that you can sleep well tonight.
Crap.
You still haven't found the owner?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, no, not... not yet.
Hey.
She's a, um... a weim...
How do you say it?
Weimaraner.
Weimaraner. Yeah.
Right, I can never remember that
Hey.
Are you planning a trip somewhere?
Oh, no, I'm just...
I... I don't know.
Maybe sometime, but not... not now.
She's really cute.
Have you named her?
I'm just calling her
Carol right now.
Wha...
Yikes. Carol?
It's... I don't know.
It's my sister's name.
I guess I don't really...
I just don't really know that many girls' names.
What's your name?
E-Evan.
Hi.
I'm Allegra.
Now you know two girls' names.
You know, it's really nice to have a guy on the beat in the neighborhood.
Makes everyone feel safer, you know.
Thanks, Tony.
I appreciate that.
Wait right here.
You don't tell anyone.
This is for you.
Oh, I... I, uh...
It's policy. I-I'm not allowed.
Policy?
Yeah.
It's ridiculous. It's cannoli.
Um, I... I could buy it.
They're on special, two for a dollar.
I get 4 bucks apiece for those.
Yeah, that's a... that's a pretty good special.
Here.
All right.
You know we're in a drought.
Hey, Detective.
Are you doing the work on this house alone?
Yeah, uh... Yeah.
Yeah, it's a labor of love, you know.
Six months, it's... it's a big job.
So did you come here to admire my house, or you, uh... you gonna take me up on my offer, you know, picnic, a drink, dinner?
No. No, actually, uh,
I need your help about something.
See, I was thinking about the statement you gave inside the station yesterday, and... and something doesn't seem right.
What's that?
Why were you eating lunch at the softball field the day you picked up
Christie and Heather?
I beg your pardon?
Well, I mean, you said you eat lunch there every day, but when I asked the neighbors around the field if they'd ever seen your truck before, they said no, never seen it.
Well, they're just plain wrong.
I go there every day.
I... I eat my sandwich.
I watch a T-ball game or a softball game.
Can you prove that,
Mr. Beckworth?
I don't go there at the same time every day.
I don't eat my lunch at any set hour.
It's funny. The mothers that live around that field, they're kind of nosy, and they have a really great
Neighborhood Watch program.
Detective, I'm not gonna argue with you.
I've got no reason to lie about eating my sandwich at Memorial Park, whether I show up there at 3:00 or 12:00 or park my truck a foot away from where it was the day before.
Please, believe me.
Right.
Forget about the drought.
A garden like that's gonna attract a lot of attention.
You gonna give me a ticket?
No. It's not my department.
I was just, you know...
You giving me a warning?
Well, thank you for the warning.
Don't start with me.
I've had a hell of a day.
We're gonna run
14 miles tomorrow, and then I think we need to start pulling back by Sunday, okay?
Oh, shit.
Ohh. I forgot she was coming by
Coming!
Don't move.
Sorry about that.
I totally forgot about the time, but come on back.
Oh. Um, if you're busy, I can...
No, it's fine. Come in.
He's not shy.
Okay...
Sorry about that.
It always happens around attractive women.
This is my brother.
Hello, Erik. I'm Kate.
Can you hand me the, um, pitcher behind you?
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Actually, do you think you could give me a hand?
Of course. Of course.
What, uh... What can I do?
I'm gonna lift him, and if you could just rinse the, uh, soap out of his hair.
Yes.
Okay...
There we go.
- Okay? Just like this?
- Yeah.
That's great.
Thanks.
I was gonna get his hair cut for Sunday, but I think it looks pretty good longer.
Don't you?
Yeah, I like it long.
What do you think of the moustache?
Um, let's see.
I like the moustache.
I hate it.
Will you hold up his arm?
Um, yeah.
Thanks.
So you've been sober about six months now.
How exactly did that happen?
Did you wake up one morning and decide that you'd hit rock bottom?
Um, I think it was more like I hit the bottom, and then the rock fell on me.
You don't think we're gonna win this case, do you?
Isn't this hard for you?
Yeah. Yeah, it's hard.
It's really fucking hard, hardest thing I've ever done.
You have kids?
No.
Me neither.
But I imagine it's a lot like having a baby.
A really big, heavy baby that you have to shave and you get to curse around.
You didn't answer my question.
He can't go in one of those places.
He needs me.
And I need him.
Armando Hyde.

What I've got ls a man that's right for me
This man is a lucky man
He's kicking my ass
And lootin' my drawers for free
A nickel for my pickle
What I got ls a man that's right for me
Sounds really good.
Good birthday so far?
Best birthday now that you're here.
A couple of friends took me to Katsuya for dinner, and I made them promise to get me back by 10:00.
You didn't have to do that.
Could have done this on another night.
No, I've been waiting for this all day.
All right, wait a second.
Wait a second. Hold on.
Don't you want to talk a little bit before your birthday fuck?
No.
Wait here.
Okay...
Get in here!
You like?
Yeah.
Yeah, you look great.
Oh, God.
Do you have a condom, T?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you just...
I did.
Sorry. I just... You know, your bra, you looked hot and...
I'm sorry.
I gotta go...
I was bad from early on. I just...
You can't stay longer?
I can't, sweetie.
All right. I'll call you when I'm... when I'm out. Okay?
Happy birthday, baby.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I got to pee.
It's okay if I pee, right?
I... I think so, yeah. Sure.
I won't be long.
You ready?
Yeah. Right, baby?
You're in here.
Hey, it's gonna be great.
I'll see you in, what, an hour or so?
Well, by the time the anesthesia wears off, it's probably more like a couple of hours.
A couple of hours. Quick.
- Will you follow me?
- Yeah.
You guys always open on Saturdays?
Baby-making's a seven-day-a-week thing.
After focusing their early interest on Roger Beckworth, it seems like investigators are back to square one.
Today they began retracing all of the steps of their initial evidence gathering.
As you can see, they're taking what appears to be the family computer.
Officials are not speaking to us about this latest development, but obviously they think there might be some information that could help them in figuring out what happened to little Christie Dillon.
Well, that's an interesting development.
Keep us posted on that, Al.
Hey, Mom, can I go to Magic Mountain with Julie's family tomorrow?
Sure.
She said I could go!
But it's my day off today,
- so you and I are gonna...
- Oh, my gosh.
I cannot wait to ride the... hang out.
So here it is.
All right.
Looks like it's all here.
Okay...
Say, "Please whip me."
Please whip me more.
- Louder! I can't...
- Please whip me more!
You want it harder?
You forgot the command.
God! Fuck. Damn it.
Louder!
Yes, ma'am!
Say, "Please whip me."
Please whip me more.
Louder! I didn't...
Please whip me more!
You want it harder?
Yes.
You forgot the command.
Come on.
Louder. Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Come 0... Hey.
Hey, what's up, baby?
W-What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Yeah.
Uh, hi.
Oh, great. You're done.
We were getting worried about you.
Yeah, somebody might want to talk to the building manager about a little heat in... in the room.
That would, uh, help things along.
Okay...
Yeah, and, uh, also your... the magazines are worn out.
Okay...
And the... the videos are, uh...
They're not accessible.
Okay...
I've never met a person in my life who so completely inspired me.
When I first saw you in the U-Cen surrounded by those three girls...
I thought that you looked like a womanizing frat guy.
And after you bought me that cup of coffee and you tried out the worst pickup line I had ever heard...
And, no, I'm not gonna embarrass him by telling you all what he said, but trust me. It was bad.
After everything that you gave me, my sweetheart,
I can at least promise you that I can take that one to my grave.
I love you, Sam.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to meet you at your house?
Would you like to go to lunch?
Um, yeah. I just...
Let me grab a... a water.
I will never forgive you for this, Drew, everything you've put us through...
- Mom...
- All this torture.
First you destroyed your brother's life, and if that wasn't enough, you had to destroy ours, too.
How could you do this to us?
This to you?
I'm the one who wants to take care of him, not stick him in a home somewhere.
He needs qualified, responsible caregivers.
He needs people who love him.
Love? You talking about the kind of love where you put somebody else's needs before your own?
Are you going to do that?
You are far too selfish for that.
Mrs. Bryant, please.
Your son is coming home.
No more talking from you.
No more talking from you.
You've done enough.
So tell me something about yourself.
Oh, I don't know. Like what?
I don't know.
It doesn't have to be some deep, dark secret.
Okay...
I was born with an extra kidney.
No, I swear to God
It's just a little one.
It doesn't do anything.
But, look, when I was 10
I went to school one day, and there was this kid who said that his cousin or somebody had been traveling overseas and someone had kidnapped him and drugged him and tried to steal his kidney and sell it on the black market.
On the black market?
You believed this?
Well, I was 10, so all I'm thinking is
"Whoa, I got a huge pile of cash sitting inside here," and... and I put an ad in the local paper.
You put an ad out in the paper?
Well, what were you gonna charge for your own little baby kidney?
$500 or best offer.
That's not a bad deal.
I thought so.
So how are you going to deliver the goods
- when somebody called for your...
- I was 10.
I hadn't thought the thing through all the way, okay?
- But I did get one call.
- No, you didn't.
Yeah, I swear to God.
And so, of course, then my parents found out, and they thought I'd lost my mind, so they made me go see a shrink, and then everyone in school found out, and this... this one kid filled my locker with, like, 40 cans of kidney beans.
It was awful.
Anyway, it kind of put a stigma on me that lasted a while.
That's kind of sad.
Yeah. You probably think
I'm a total weirdo now, huh?
No. I mean, you were 10.
If anything, it's indicative of your early entrepreneurial spirit.
Your parents should have encouraged it.
Right.
Okay, your turn.
My turn for what?
Tell me something about you.
Come here.
I hate black people.
Th-That's, um...
I'm guessing that can be a problem sometimes.
Yeah.
Will... Will you stop...
Please stop taking my picture.
You know, I didn't come up here to watch you sweat your balls off running the hills of San Francisco.
I came here to make sure you shave that prison pussy ASAP.
You know what? This is... it's very good luck.
Oh, the race is over, so unless you want to audition for a Village People tribute band, it's got to go.
Oh, my God. It really bothers you, doesn't it?
Yeah. Every picture
I have of my brother running one of these races...
Oh, look, he looks like a gay porn star running from a bunch of rabid fans.
Someday, uh, you're gonna have to run one of these with me.
Thanks for the offer,
Prefontaine.
Well, that's never gonna happen.
Besides, I don't have time to train.
No, really. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm busy.
Doing what?
Vampires get more shit done in the day than you.
Come on. All you got is time.
We are 15 seconds away from this year's SoCal Marathon.
You ready?
5,4,3,2,1!
I had a date with a guy last night, and we're seeing each other again later today.
So it went well.
Yeah, it was great.
And then I told him
I hate black people.
Okay, and how did he react to that?
He laughed, and... he was kind of weirded out, more uncomfortable than freaked, I think, because he's a white guy.
Why do you, uh...
Why do you think you did that?
I don't know.
Um, I like to see white people squirm?
Do you like this guy?
I do. I really do.
Sometimes I feel like
I have these automatic responses for white guys.
I just... I wish I'd never told him that, you know.
I... I wish I'd never said that.
"I hate black people."
Why?
Did he say something to trigger that from you?
No. He told a story, and it was vulnerable and sweet.
He's a sweet, nice guy.
I think I... pushed him away, like I do with everyone at my job.
I'm the only black person working on this show, and I just... I get so angry.
Ah, scratch that. Uh... the two security guards at the gate, they... they're black.
And there's another- another executive who is female also, and she's black.
And the valet, he's black.
Why does it bother you?
Because I feel like I'm selling out.
I mean, look at you.
You were recommended to me from my white writer friend.
You know, I should be with a black therapist.
Allegra, if you're uncomfortable,
I could recommend...
No, no, it's...
I want to get to the bottom of this, and...
I like being black.
It's just I don't like being black sometimes around white people and some black people.
I just feel like... like I'm some kind of a fake.
Like when I, uh, drive up to the gate and the two black security guards are there, one of them, he looks at my car, you know, and he looks at me, and he's sizing me up, and I feel like... I feel like he's looking at me and he's thinking that I'm trying to be white or something.
And the other security guard, he doesn't care.
He just wants to flirt with me.
That's why I only hate some black people, because some of them are suspicious, and the rest don't care, you know.
They're fine.
What are you?
Don't care or suspicious?
Suspicious, and I'm getting really tired of myself.
I don't... I don't want to hate anybody, black or white, you know.
I... I want to fall in love.
I want Evan to like me.
I want to spend more time with my niece.
That'd be nice.
I want my dad to, uh.
To still be alive.
Uh, I want, uh...
I want to lose five pounds.
That's important.
I want... I want a back rub.
I want to be swept off my feet.
I want to be taken on a trip to Jamaica for a month.
You only used the word
"hate" once just now.
Ah, eureka.
I want you to try something.
I want you to be really nice to anybody that you think is suspicious.
Just see how that goes.
Okay...
Allegra.
Okay, I'll do it.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Tissue, right there.
Yeah. I just... You know,
I'll get around to that tissue.
All right.
Keep going!
All the way through!
All the way through!
Oh, hey. Good morning.
Hey.
Got the downloads from Dillon's hard drive.
It's as bad as they say it is?
Yeah, it's worse.
Oh.
- Frankie.
- Yeah?
So what's up with the results of the review of Dillon's hard drive?
It's right here.
They just handed me the file.
Now, this is what you call a real lead on a real suspect.
You're gonna have to bring him back in again. Today.
Already planning on it.
Look, I know it's a little, um...
Perverted
Yeah, but it's not necessarily illegal.
The guys are looking into some of the photos, and the girls are young, but it doesn't mean they're breaking any laws.
But he's definitely got a thing for young girls.
So did my ex-husband.
Yeah.
You call me after you talk to him, okay?
All right.
Yo, you okay?
Hey, can we get some help over here!
Come here!
Easy, easy.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah. Ls my brother... Is he...
He seems all right.
Can he speak?
Pretty sure you dislocated your shoulder, miss.
Now I'm just gonna get you something...
Try to hold still.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
It's been four days since
Christie's disappearance, and frustrations amongst officials and in the community are running high, but today comes news that the investigation has shifted away from the neighbor
Michael Beckworth altogether and so leads to the father,
Andrew Dillon.
Now, Mr. Dillon has been adamant about his innocence, and, though police have not officially called him or anyone else a suspect, the feeling is that an indictment will be coming any day now.
I wish every day was Christmas...
Hi.
Hi. Thanks for coming over so quickly.
No problem.
I was in the office, so I'm close.
Working on Sundays isn't good for your marriage, honey.
Thanks, Mom.
Jesus Christ.
Mom, you're gonna blow up the house.
Look, if the pilot doesn't light, you got to turn off the gas.
Oh, how am I supposed to know that?
Your father always deals with that kind of thing.
No.
Mom, no, not any more.
Not for nine years.
He's not lighting the pilot light today.
He didn't clean the gutters out last spring.
He didn't flip the breakers in the fuse box when they popped the winter before last, and he did not drive you to the hospital.
When you fell in the driveway, you fell, Mom, and I drove you.
I did, Mom.
Mom, I did.
Me.
I don't understand why you won't listen to me when I talk about him.
I hear everything you say.
But you don't listen, Mom.
I know you think I'm a fool, your kooky mother.
You know, you were always a lot more like him, only dealing in the facts, proof, evidence.
I... I don't think you ever believed in anything without those conditions.
Not the Easter Bunny.
Not Santa Claus.
I remember when you were...
I think you were 10.
We were in this kitchen, and I was baking you
Rice Krispies squares, and I asked you why you didn't believe in God, and do you remember this'?
Do you remember what you said'?
You said,
"Where's the evidence?"
"Should I just believe that because I can..."
"flap my arms, I can..." ﬂy?-.
I was a real pain in the ass, wasn't I?
You still are, but I love you.
I just don't see the point in deluding yourself.
What good has ever come from lying to yourself, Mom?
Love.
I'm...
Love, there's no litmus test for it, is there?
I mean, there's no proof.
I mean, how do you know... how do you know that I love you?
I mean, really, you don't know.
Because you just told me you did.
Ah, I could have been lying to you all these years.
I trust you, Mom.
Your grandma and grandpa, now, that's an incredible love story, isn't it?
I mean, that was perfect, right?
Well, what proof do we have that they didn't just meet during the war in a less dramatic way?
You must have told me that story a hundred times when I was little.
It was your favorite bedtime story.
Is that all it was, Mom?
A bedtime story?
Some bullshit story you tell a kid to help him to sleep?
Not to help you go to sleep.
It was a story to get a boy to understand the... the capacity of love, and maybe now it's become a story to understand the importance of belief without evidence... trust without reservation faith.
We have to leave now.
Can I get you a ride home?
Okay, take care.
Yeah?
Who is it?
It's your neighbor.
- Hey.
- Can we talk?
Um, yeah.
What about?
C-Can I come in?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
I don't know why you guys don't just arrest that neighbor.
Uh, I'm sorry. What-
What are you talking about?
The neighbor of the missing girl, you know, Beckworth.
The Christie Dillon case.
Wh-Why can't you guys just arrest him?
Uh, I believe he was... he was brought in for questioning by the police.
I... I don't think they had enough on him to hold him.
Have they searched his house?
I... I don't know.
It's... It's not my division.
Well, somebody needs to tell somebody to get over there.
There's not much time.
She could be dead already.
Do... Do you have some sort of proof or some sort of evidence that...
I just know she's there.
Okay, it's... it's Carter, right?
Carter, maybe... maybe you should go back to your apartment, and don't worry about these things.
It's really... It's not... not your responsibility.
Whose responsibility is it, then?
I mean, you're a cop.
You don't even think it's your responsibility.
We're everyone's responsibility, all of us, each other's.
I've always taught my kids that a society fails if we don't look out for each other.
How can people not see that?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
Where you going?
To look out for someone.
Shit.
Whoo. Hey.
Best seats in the house.
Yeah, here you go.
Thank you.
Yeah, you're gonna like her.
She's really good.
What are all these things for?
They're just toys.
Don't hit that one.
Can I see that for a second?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
We
Dear
Are
Are, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're damn dolls
Alive
Sta)'
Here
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My head leaves me small
Mr. Dillon, I mean, these images we found on your computer, they're...
Not illegal.
All right, we'll see about that.
It's fantasy. it...
I had nothing to do with my daughter's disappearance.
Then why don't you take me through when you noticed when she first was missing?
I... I told you!
I told everybody a hundred times!
Well, then tell me again.
Take me through it minute by minute.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What you people should have done a long time ago.
He did something with her.
All right, you don't...
You don't know that, all right?
She... She's not in there, all right?
Come on. Let's go, or you're gonna get arrested, come on.
Then arrest me.
What can I do for you, huh?
Who are you?
What the hell's going on?
We were just...
It's a small misunderstanding.
This is my house.
This is private property.
Come on. Carter, let's go.
Carter, come on. Let's go. Carter!
No! No!
What?!
Carter! No! Carter!
What?!
No!
What?!
Come on now!
- Carter!
- Stand up for the least of America
Lay down like a naked dead body
Keep it real for the people working overtime
Because they living off the government dime
Stand up for the people of America
Stand up for the man next door
'Cause you're free in the land of America...
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Stop!
Stop.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
Shoot him!
Where's your gun?!
I didn't do anything!
Call for backup!
That means you...
I'm not... I'm not a cop.
What?
I'm not... I'm not a cop.
You're just... just nothing!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Not a cop?
Like a naked dead body
Keep it real for the people working overtime
Because they live off the government dime
Stand up for the people of America
Stand up for the man next door
'Cause you're free in the land of America
Not gonna die like this
Come on, now
You don't know me!
No!
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my G...
What?
What do I do?
Just... go.
Go.
Help! Help!
AHO
Uh, Salut, Adrienne.
C'est Ryan.
Oh, bonjour, Ryan.
Comment ga va?
Bien. Et vous?
Bien. Trés bien.
Bon. Ou est mon pére?
Ah, oui. Je vais le charger.
Bon soir.
Toi aussi.
Hello.
Hi.
Everything okay?
No, not really, Dad.
What's going on?
I'm having an affair.
Why?
I don't know.
I figured that you might be able to help me figure that out.
After all, you've got a lot more experience in this than I do.
I saw that the screen had been removed from the window.
Joan was freaking out.
I grabbed the phone, called the police.
Hey, Beckworth's dead.
We got officers on the scene, but it looks like, uh, there's another victim.
And, Frankie, there's something else.
Stunning, really.
Police showed up on the scene and found him trying to open the trapdoor that led to the hidden cellar under the house.
Now, we've not been allowed in to see it, but by all accounts, it's a virtually soundproof prison cell where he kept little Christie Dillon for the past six days.
It's incredible.
Al, you just spoke to the lead investigator on this a few moments ago.
What did she have to say?
Yes, I did. Let's roll the tape of the interview with Detective Francesca Graylin of the LAPD.
Could you tell us what you know so far?
Well, the investigation is still ongoing.
I can tell you that Christie has been returned to her family.
It appears Roger Beckworth had something to do with her abduction.
Mr. Beckworth was found dead in his home with another person.
There are conflicting reports that the other person was a police officer or former police officer?
He was a cadet for a short time before his dismissal.
Can you tell us why he was dismissed?
No, I can't speak to that.
Then are we sure that he was involved in this?
Yes. Uh, look, like I said, the investigation is still ongoing.
Uh, all I can say is that it looks like he came over to confront
Mr. Beckworth, but we're not sure if or how he knew Christie was in there, so that's really all I can say.
Thank you, Detective.
Thank you for your time.
All right, Al. Thank you.
We'll check back with you whenever you have new developments in that case.
But right now, we're gonna go to Tricia Alexander, who is standing by with an amazing story. Trish?
Thanks, Jim.
Well, you have that right.
As viewers know, today was the annual SoCal Marathon.
Of course, the champions were crowned earlier this morning, and the race itself closed hours ago, but it's apparently not over for one very determined racer.
Make that two very determined racers.
What do you want me to say?
I'm a bad father?
I'm a bad husband?
What I did to your mother was a mistake of a lifetime in a lifetime full of mistakes?
I just... I want you...
No, I need you to fix it.
I don't know how to fix it.
It's easy, okay?
Just tell her the truth.
Listen, in human relations, kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths.
Goodbye, Dad.
Hey.
Hi.
I thought you were coming home later.
Nope.
The, uh... in vitro didn't take.
It's okay, sweetie.
We'll just try again.
Okay?
There it is.
There it is, Erik.
Great job
Nice work, buddy.
Ma'am, ma'am...
Congratulations.
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
Congratulations.
You are relentless
In the way that you ask me
So many questions of my days in the city
I wish that I could tell you something
But I'm a hostage of my pride
And I'll take all the heat you're packing...
Good morning.
I was getting coffee today, and I thought that you guys might like some.
I didn't know what kind that you'd like, so I got one cappuccino and one regular coffee.
I'll just have-
I'll take the coffee.
Okay. Great.
You guys have a nice day.
You, too. You, too.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
You are relentless
In the way that you love me
I'm afraid of the thoughts that you're making
Listen... let's get together soon.
I wish that I could know the difference
Between your smiles and your frowns
Now I'm buried in the armor
'Cause I'm an iron man.
I'm an iron man.
When I was a child, my mother would tell me a story about how the Devil roams the Earth.
Sometimes, she said, he would take human form so he could punish the damned on
Earth before claiming their souls.
The ones he chose would be gathered together and tortured as he hid amongst them, pretending to be one of them.
I always believed my mother was telling me an old wives' tale.
My mother's story would always begin the same way, with a suicide paving the way for the Devil's arrival.
And it would always end with the deaths of all those trapped.
I'm good.
I feel good. I feel amazing.
You know the main reason why people go back to drinking?
No.
Guess.
The Eagles.
Resentment.
Are we seriously talking about this again?
It's important.
Your ability to forgive is gonna determine the quality of the rest of your life more than anything else.
Look, some things are beyond forgiveness.
You're already on your way.
You've taken responsibility for your actions.
That's more than half the battle right there.
But to truly feel free, you may need to finally start believing in something greater than yourself.
That sounds good.
It does.
But when I think about the guy that killed my family,
I have a tough time believing in much of anything.
I'm just saying, leave yourself open to it.
Can we just have breakfast for once?
Talk about normal stuff.
I'm your sponsor.
You can talk about normal stuff with everybody else.
Hey. Got a good one for you.
Yeah?
Yeah, it doesn't make sense, right?
A guy hits a truck with this kind of force from a two-story building?
Definitely a jumper.
Are you sure he wasn't thrown?
He's got a rosary in his hand.
Not the kind of thing you grab in a panic.
Right.
Elsa.
Bowden.
Hi.
There's no glass on the ground.
The truck wasn't here when he made impact. It must have rolled.
Uh-huh.
Your guy jumped from that building.
And what? Your dead guy turned the corner, here?
These things are made to bounce trucks off.
You got to be kidding me.
Let's walk it.
Yeah.
Larson.
Hey! Hey, lady, you got to sign in.
Oh. Where's Ramsey?
He knows me.
Ramsey's out sick.
You got me.
And that means you gotta sign in.
I mean, do I look like such a threat?
Don't blame me.
They got procedures.
Keep dreaming, dawg.
You have to cover the sign in.
Some lawyers on 39 need this right away.
You're not taking the stairs again.
What else am I gonna do to stay in shape?
To 39? Just get on the damn elevator.
Come in.
It's too tight for me.
You can squeeze in.
No.
Hold, please.
Thank you.
Forty-two, please.
You bet.
Now, see, this I can do.
Could you hold that?
Uh. Sorry.
Thanks for your help.
Don't mention it.
Uh-uh, this is not good.
Oh, come on, man.
Don't do this.
Come on, Timonen, put a stick on it.
How we doing?
Same score.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Why is elevator six in inspection mode?
Huh?
Elevator six.
A full house.
Two queens, three jacks.
Call Dwight.
Yeah.
Yo, Dwight, you got a problem.
Tell me about it.
I'm already up on 35 fixing it.
The elevator?
No, the broken window.
You're not fixing the elevator?
Screen says six is on inspection mode.
We got people stuck in there.
Are you sure you're reading that right?
Your eyes ain't what they used to be.
You know what?
I'll ask your mom to read it for me next time I got her bent over the console.
My mom's 78.
Have at it.
Ooh!
Yeah. Listen, buddy, just go up to the machine room and check it out, okay?
On my way.
Just trying to get something to jump-start it.
Don't you have emergency procedures?
I don't know, I'm just a temp.
I just started working here.
Well, don't you service these things?
Try hitting the emergency button.
Don't you keep up your equipment?
I don't know.
Like I said...
Don't you have a walkie-talkie?
No. I didn't think
I'd need it.
Don't you think it would have been...
Won't you shut up?
Yeah, take it easy.
I mean, seriously!
You don't have a walkie-talkie?
Hey, people, we see you in there.
We're stuck!
Hang tough, we got the building engineer on his way.
When was the last time you heard somebody say "hang tough"?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Is he picking a fight?
Can one of you look towards the camera and say something loud and clear, please?
Your building sucks!
I can't hear you.
The speaker in the car is supposed to let us talk both ways, but you can hear me?
It's working on this end, yeah!
He just said he can't hear us, didn't say we should talk louder.
Okay, um, give us a sec.
Well, this is reassuring.
I got to be somewhere.
You're not gonna get a signal in here.
I just need to call my job so
I don't get fired over this.
Typical bullshit.
Do any of y'all have a signal?
I've got one bar.
Hello? This is Larson.
Can you please connect me to my job at the security desk?
Can you hear me?
Tell them to get us out of here!
Hello?
They'll just have to deal.
Well, at least we got tunes.
Don't sit under that apple tree with anyone else but me
Come on, grandma, you know the words.
Anyone else but me
Don't be a jerk.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Miss Manners.
Did I offend your noble sensibilities?
Why don't you lay off, pal?
Why don't you suck a butt?
This is great.
Let's just pick on the nice guy for bringing a little levity.
Maybe we should all just stop talking for a while.
Sure.
Okay, I was just joking.
I'm joking.
Hey,
Dwight, are you there yet?
Almost.
Hey, look, man,
I'm just glad you're dating again.
I'm just glad you're glad.
You know what I meant.
You know, after all your troubles...
I know what you meant.
So, how's that been going for you?
Good.
Ninety days tomorrow.
Wow, 90 days!
It seems like just yesterday since we...
Not to me, it doesn't.
You wouldn't happen to have a broken window up there, would you?
Yeah.
Facing this direction?
Mmm-hmm.
Big enough to fit a person through it?
I suppose.
Please stop sweeping.
I'm declaring this a crime scene.
Car 602.
What the hell is that?
Look out!
You might want to secure that better.
Okay, okay!
In her story, innocent people always die.
Poor souls just trying to help out, who didn't realize what they were dealing with.
He doesn't take kindly to those who stand in his way.
Hey, old man.
It doesn't say inspection mode here.
Circuits look fine.
Okay.
Try flipping elevator six.
I'll tell the people in the car.
You count to 20, then do it.
Cool.
"Inspected and certified
August 12 by G. Carson."
Hey, what do you say we go visit G.
Carson when we're out of here?
Tell him what we think of his inspecting prowess.
People, we're gonna flip off the lights for one sec to see if there's a short in the breaker.
You're gonna cut off the power?
Does that mean we could drop?
You'll be fine.
I just didn't want you to...
- What's happening?
- Come on!
Nothing.
Nothing. Just relax.
Come on.
Get off me!
Get off me!
Sorry.
What's wrong with you, man?
When I was younger, my brother locked me in a trunk for six hours.
I have trouble with tight spaces.
Oh, great.
Come on.
Can we get out through that?
What are you gonna do?
Shimmy up the cables?
You'll be a lot safer in here.
Anybody know where the bathroom is in this thing?
Did it work?
Nope, they're still stuck.
Let me go check the mains in the basement.
All right, thanks a lot. Wow.
What's going on?
You know that window on 35?
Yeah.
Looks like somebody might have jumped through it.
Today?
Yeah.
This morning.
Thanks for bearing with us, people.
We should get you back on line in a few minutes.
It's been minutes.
How long is it going to take?
When we get out of here, you're gonna need a good rest.
"Mattress Mania"?
That's us. Everybody's had their mattress too long. Am I right?
You didn't follow that advice about flipping it every few months and now you've worn a groove into it, and you think,
"Well, I'm used to it.
"So, hey. But I do miss the way it felt
"when it came fresh out of that bag."
Look at those shoes, they've been through the mill.
They're saying, "Someone deserves a better place to lie down."
Are you insulting my shoes?
The point is, a new mattress will cost a lot less than you think.
You don't have to be as well-off as this one.
I'm not that well-off.
What makes me good at selling mattresses is I can look at a person's clothes and know exactly how much they can afford to spend.
And you, lady, you're no Super Sleeper.
Oh, my God. They keep playing this song over and over and over.
Can't they just turn the music off?
Did you just touch my ass?
What?
You wish, sweetheart.
I don't know who you think you are, but keep your hands off me.
Whatever.
Oh!
They must be working on the lights again.
Hey, Dwight.
Dwight.
I'm here.
I'm heading into the pit.
They just lost power in number six again. Is that you?
No, you can't do that from here, D.L.
Huh.
That's strange.
I'm looking at elevator six right now.
I can't see anything wrong with it.
The lights keep shorting out.
The passengers are getting scared.
See if this helps.
Come on, come on.
Oh, God.
Come on, come on.
Anything?
No. No change.
The only other thing
I can think to do would be going back up to the roof, climbing down and resetting the car manually.
Yeah, yeah. Good. Do that, do that.
Call me when you get there.
All right.
Hey.
What?
All right.
Get out of here.
Off you go. Off you go.
There you go.
Oh!
Shit!
"Inspected by G. Carson."
What was that?
What?
I thought I heard...
Ah!
Shit.
Are you all right?
I'm just...
I think someone pulled my blouse.
I'm... I'm...
- You're bleeding.
- Here. Here. Stand up.
Let me help you.
I think I got cut.
What's going on in there?
I don't know.
They're just scared.
I think that lady got hurt.
Did she?
Yeah, see that?
What in the world?
Oh, my God.
What's he saying?
I can't tell what he's saying.
I can't tell what you're trying to say.
Turn off the...
Turn off the music!
Maybe they don't like the music.
The music's still on?
Yeah.
Turn it off.
It's probably driving them nuts.
Okay. How?
There's a kill switch right behind the...
Right under the key box.
Thank you!
What happened to her?
It feels like something bit me.
Wait, wait. Does anybody have anything sharp on them that might have cut her, she might have cut herself on?
- No.
Why you got blood on you, man?
She fell into me.
So you cut her?
What? No. No, something must have happened to her and then she fell into me.
She probably did it to herself!
- Come on!
- Bit her own back?
You think this is a bite?
No, nobody got bit.
What else could have done that?
I don't know.
A serrated blade could have.
You wouldn't happen to have a knife with a serrated blade on you, would you?
No.
Okay.
You mind if we search your pockets?
Yes, I do mind.
You mind if we search yours?
Go right ahead.
Maybe she has a serrated blade on her!
Are you seriously suggesting that I would do this to myself?
I don't know.
Give me another reason to kick your ass.
Please, bro, take it easy, okay?
Bro?
I'm not your bro.
Can you turn towards the camera and show us what happened to you, please?
Oh, my God.
Whoa!
Okay, we gotta call the police.
We have a possible 240 at 333 Locust Street.
333 Locust?
That's gotta be right around...
...here.
Strange.
602 responding. Happen to be right outside. Put me on it.
Copy that, 602.
That's convenient.
I don't make the calls, they just come for me.
Go.
Markowitz!
Hey, how's your girlfriend?
Shut up.
What are you doing?
I thought I saw something.
What do you mean?
Like what?
Something.
Okay.
You see it?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, that's just...
That's just grain in the image.
That's, you know...
It's a mistake.
It's like when people see Jesus in a pancake or something.
No. No. No.
Ramirez. Ramirez, you're freaking me out. Come on.
Hey, hey.
Hey, listen to me.
We need to convey calm.
These people are relying on us, okay?
So stop this shit right now.
Come on.
Come on!
I don't even know why we're trying this.
We're in the express shaft.
There's not gonna be another opening till the 23rd floor.
Maybe we're close.
Could this elevator fall?
I doubt it.
Because we gotta be 20 floors up, just dangling over nothing.
Can we stop talking about this, please?
One more time.
On three. One...
Oh, no, no, no.
Stay away from me, man.
I can help. I want to get out of here, too.
Why don't you sit your creepy ass down in the corner over there?
We can all keep an eye on you.
Are you ready? On three.
One, two...
Three.
I'm just over here.
And why do you think this might be an assault?
She seemed to be having words with one of the other passengers just before it happened, and now it looks like they're all keeping an eye on him.
Which guy?
That guy, right there.
Do we have communication?
Yeah, we have an open line here.
You can talk, but we can't hear.
Hello, everyone. This is Detective
Bowden, Philadelphia P.D.
We're working hard to get you out of there. Shouldn't be much longer.
Please just remain calm.
How soon till we get in?
Engineer's working on it now.
Usually, we get these things going pretty quick.
This engineer work for you guys or the elevator company?
Works for us.
Okay.
Call the elevator company and have them send someone, okay?
And have the Fire Department send some guys.
You got it.
At least one of your staff is aboard.
Oh, yeah, the guard there, he's a temp, actually.
Ben something. I don't know.
He started yesterday.
Okay. Call the temp agency and get all the info they have on him.
And the others?
We don't have names for the others.
What?
He should see the face.
No.
What face?
No. Nothing.
I saw a face.
Look, there's no face.
Tell him about the face.
No. Look, Ramirez is kind of religious.
Just ignore him. Trust me.
I'd like to get a sense of who you all are.
Stop it right now, comprende?
One at a time,
I'd like you to hold up your driver's license to the camera so I know who
I'm talking to.
That's a good idea.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Try and get it closer to the camera.
The letters are too small.
Is there a sharpness setting on this thing?
No, that's as good as it gets, right there.
You can put your ID's away.
Thanks.
Do any of you have a pen on you?
No one?
Here you go.
I want you to account for everyone on the visitors' log.
Find out which of these people didn't show up for their appointment.
You got it.
You sure?
Okay.
Keep him away from me.
Must be working on the power again.
The geniuses have done a bang-up job so far.
Any other exits?
No, sir, that's everything.
Hey.
I got some info on your guard.
What have you got?
Check this out.
We got...
Hey.
Something else is happening.
Is he dead?
602, we have a possible 187.
I need backup.
How do you rewind this thing?
Rewind, fast forward and that's frame-to-frame.
Frame-to-frame.
Everyone, just keep breathing.
We're gonna get you through this.
Just take it easy, okay?
So today, someone committed suicide, a woman got hurt, now a man is dead.
Yeah, what are you trying to say?
Look, how many times have you seen a child fall and barely miss the edge of the table with their head?
Why is it so rare that they hit it?
Get to your point.
Look.
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing yourself.
When he's near, everything goes wrong.
Toast falls jelly-side down, children hit tables and people get hurt.
Hey. The police do not want to hear this stuff, Ramirez. Okay?
So just stop. Now.
Sometimes he takes human form and torments the damned on
Earth before stealing them away.
Where I come from, we call it
The Devil's Meeting.
Is this guy for real?
Look, I'm sorry. Ramirez.
You must consider that one of those people might be the Devil.
All right. Come on.
I need you to stop telling campfire stories and get your head in the game.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Markowitz, look at this guy right here.
Yeah.
Lights go down, they come back up, he's closer, but he's moving away.
What were you saying about the guard?
All right. Yeah.
He's a real piece of work.
Assault, assault, assault.
Beat a guy into a coma with a baseball bat. That's great.
These the kind of guys you hire for security?
Like I said, he's just a temp.
Some temp.
Could that mirror break from him hitting it?
Then how did...
What's that cop doing out there?
He's probably trying to figure out which one of us is the murderer.
In the story, men would always try to fight him with force, but some battles can't be fought with weapons.
Will you all please clear a space between the camera and the body so I can see him?
Don't touch the body.
This is a crime scene now.
Though I know you're stuck in there,
I expect you to do as little damage to it as humanly possible, got it?
Any luck with the elevator company?
They're out of business.
I guess that figures.
A shard of glass sliced up and into the jugular.
This is definitely not an accident.
Who chooses a contained room with three witnesses for a killing?
Unless they're so worked up, they can't control themselves.
These people are shook up, but they don't look murderous.
I'm missing something here.
I need a volunteer to help me out.
There's a piece of paper hanging out of his pocket.
Very carefully, I want you to take it out and hold it up to the camera.
"Vince."
It looks like "McCormick."
The return address is for the Better Business Bureau.
They have an office on 35.
You got a freight elevator?
Yeah.
I've never seen a person die.
Neither have I.
It's pretty awful, huh?
So, what, you have?
Yeah, I spent some time in Afghanistan.
You see some things you wish you hadn't.
Wait, so you've been trained to kill people?
Ooh-rah.
How's your jumper shaping up?
Hey.
Can you take a look at this suicide note? Most of it makes sense, but then it ends with, "I can hear the Devil's footsteps draw near."
Usually, suicide notes are either all crazy or all rational, but this one's both.
It's strange, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
This one?
Elevator key.
Key's not catching.
All right.
Try the Halligan.
Something's jamming it.
Look, if I can...
If I can get up there,
I can maybe figure out what's wrong with this thing.
I'm a mechanic. I'm pretty good with this sort of thing.
He's trying to escape.
He's trying to escape.
He's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape!
Stop! Stop!
Stop it!
Stop! What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
We're all gonna stay right here until this thing is over.
You knew what I was doing!
I told you what I was doing!
I don't know you!
It's not our policy to discuss cases under review.
It kind of damages the reputations of our member businesses.
Look, someone just killed him on his way here.
I need to know who knew he was coming here and who wanted him dead.
The line would stretch around the block.
The guy was a real scumbag.
Three years ago, he started one of those Ponzi schemes and when it collapsed, a lot of people lost their asses.
One guy even killed himself over it.
Do you have a list of people that got burned by him?
Yeah, the ones that filed.
I'm gonna need it.
So, what do you say we get to know each other a little bit better?
Here. Come on.
Frisk me. Search me.
See that I'm not carrying anything suspicious.
Come on!
You're next.
There's a good chance one of our people didn't sign in.
How's that?
'Cause that person might be on this list.
What's this?
Our victim lost a lot of people a lot of money.
These are the ones that filed complaints.
The killer's probably smart enough not to be on both lists.
Look for the one that didn't sign in.
Did you just want video of the guy who died, or also the girl that got hurt?
All of it since they got in the car.
Okay.
Detective.
You see?
That's what you're talking about?
Everybody believes in him a little bit, even guys like you who pretend they don't.
What's this?
An apology note left at the site of a hit-and-run.
My wife and son were killed down on Bethlehem Pike five years ago, but that's okay, because whoever did it is sorry.
You can tell by the heartfelt apology on the back of a car wash coupon.
So, no, I don't believe in the Devil.
We don't need him.
People are bad enough by themselves.
Stop the tape.
Back it up.
Faster, faster.
There. Now, play it.
She was acting like he grabbed her.
What is she up to?
Folks, do me a favor, keep your hands off each other.
Leave the police work to me.
I'll be in there any moment.
Won't I?
Stop it.
I don't like him touching me.
He's touching me.
I don't like it!
Stop pushing him onto me.
Stand back.
Hell, no.
I know you're not doing what it looks like you're doing!
Spray that in here, you're gonna blind all of us.
Seriously, put it down.
Lady...
Dwight, where are you? You gotta stop disappearing, seriously.
Dwight.
Hang on a sec.
Dwight, you gotta get us in that car right now. Where are you?
I can't.
Dwight, I need you to stay on walkie!
Man...
Can you see this?
Huh? You see this?
"Use by October 21, 1987."
She was scared. Relax.
She tried to pepper spray me, man!
Dwight, where are you?
We're being saved.
Dwight, where are you?
Come on, pick up.
Pick up!
They hear something.
They hear your guy moving in the shaft.
Then how come he's not answering?
Dwight? Dwight, this is serious. You need to pick up, Dwight.
Thank you!
Pick up, Dwight. Pick up.
Oh, no.
No, no. Hey! Hey!
Hey! Oh, no. Hey!
Hey! You all right?
Hey!
Come on.
Come on! Hey!
Dwight, where the hell are you, man? Come on!
What floor did Dwight enter the shaft from?
He entered from the roof.
What are they looking at?
Dwight. Dwight, pick up.
Looks like he fell. He's impaled right on top of the elevator.
Hurt real bad.
Possibly dead.
Hey, Bowden,
I think the people in the elevator can hear our radios.
Yeah, that's confirmed.
Can you switch to channel eight?
The car's stuck on 21.
Markowitz, tell the Fire
Department looks like they have to go through the wall on 21.
This is Lustig.
You can't just go through the wall.
Sure we can.
That's why you have insurance.
Fire command, go to eight, please.
There she is.
Sarah Caraway.
We know the security temp is Benjamin Larson and we know McCormick.
What other names are unaccounted for?
Jane something. Looks like "Kowski."
The older woman.
Find me footage of this guy.
This way, ma'am.
- Let's go.
- All clear.
Okay, this time slow.
You gotta be kidding me.
Did she just steal that lady's wallet?
So Vince was a scam artist, this woman Jane's a thief,
Sarah there is a liar and our guard is a thug.
Quite the crew we have here.
I still haven't seen this guy here.
What was that?
It's okay.
Hard drive crash.
I got it.
Number 2.
Here we go.
Any other angle on the lobby?
Just the main entrance.
There.
Okay, rewind back.
Faster.
There he is. Stop it.
Where's that satchel?
He doesn't...
There's no satchel in the elevator.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Shit.
Oh, no.
What's happening?
I can't take this anymore!
Don't come near me, any of you!
Maybe, if I could just check the wiring...
What the hell's going on?
Please.
Please turn on the light.
Turn on the lights!
That's it.
Shut down the building.
Bring everyone down to the lobby.
Nobody comes in or out but us.
Which guy do you think is doing this?
There are three people in there and they're all capable.
Well, she's not doing it.
I'm ruling nobody out.
Fire Department wants to know if you have a shut-off valve before they get through the wall, just in case.
Yeah, it's in the basement.
I'll go.
They're bad people, that's why they're here.
No, two of them are here because they just got on the wrong elevator.
Yeah, and I just happened to have the wrong job and you just happened to take the wrong call.
He never does this in secret.
There's a reason we're the audience.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.
No one's getting in this building right now.
I know. I'm supposed to meet somebody upstairs.
You're gonna have to call them and tell them you can't make it.
Can you just tell me what's happening?
He always kills the last victim in front of the person they love most to make cynics of us all.
No, no, no.
Don't touch her.
I'm not gonna leave her just hanging there.
Where you gonna put her?
I haven't thought that far ahead.
Funny how all this stuff starts happening right after you start working here.
Seems to me, you're the only one who knew where the cables are.
What are you doing?
Trying to close her eyes.
That doesn't work, not until they're dead for a few hours.
Okay, you enter the building with a satchel.
You see a sign-in desk you wanna avoid. Where do you go?
Restroom.
Yep.
Got it.
Could those be used to rig an elevator?
I have no idea, but he doesn't sign in and then he hides these?
What the hell is that?
I wish he'd stop.
I don't even know your name.
I'm Ben.
I'm Sarah.
I'm Tony.
So where'd your claustrophobia go?
Excuse me?
I've never seen claustrophobia come and go like that.
You trying to say something?
Then say it. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm saying
I didn't do this, and I very much doubt that she did, so that leaves you.
I'm saying I think this claustrophobia thing...
I think it's an act.
Yeah, I'm saying
I think you're a liar.
Kill him, Ben!
Kill him before he kills us!
Kill him!
Stop it! Stop!
Stop it! Get us out!
Get us out! Get us out!
Back away from each other now!
Get off!
We're gonna keep you safe and here's how, everyone get to a corner and place your hands on the wall so everyone can see that you're not up to anything.
Go ahead. Do it!
You won't have to keep this up long.
The building is surrounded by police.
In a hypothetical conversation that I'm not really having, how would this story of yours end?
They all die.
That's it?
Yeah.
This is not your fault.
They made the choices that brought them here.
Hey.
You're gonna love this.
What have you got?
She has a criminal record, too.
Three counts of blackmailing rich married men.
Now where this gets interesting, is couple of years ago, the arrests stopped. Guess why.
Tell me.
Well, her name is
Sarah Caraway.
"Caraway" Caraway?
Yeah.
She married into the family.
So she shoplifted an heir.
Yeah, something like that, I guess.
What's she doing here?
According to the sign-in sheet, she was gonna see a lawyer on 42 named Wayne Kazan.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey, listen up!
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Hey, quiet!
Philadelphia P. D!
I'm looking for a Wayne Kazan.
Is there a Wayne Kazan down here?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Heads up. Did you have a meeting today with a Sarah Caraway?
I don't know.
Do you have a subpoena?
Come on, you can tell me that much.
I might have. Why?
She was attacked.
Who has motive to hurt her?
Well, you know I can't divulge personal information.
Come on, man.
Give me something.
Give me something to work with here.
I'm trying to save your client's life.
Come here.
I guess I'd do what you guys normally do and start with the person closest to her.
Thanks.
And just so you know, my specialty is forensic accounting.
Markowitz, get Mrs.
Caraway's husband on the phone.
Should be okay now.
All right, get in there.
I might have found the problem. It's a bad wire.
Looks like it could be shorting out the circuits.
Okay.
Easy. Easy.
That's it.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Vasquez, we're gonna need the large Target saw up here as fast as you can bring it.
Look, we need two more on 21, okay, guys?
Any luck getting hold of the husband?
No, not yet.
I called his office and his secretary said he'd call me right back.
Back up! Heads up, heads up! Come on!
Heads up! Back up!
Move out of the way!
Get away! Back up!
What happened?
Anybody see what happened?
Medic!
He came through the door.
Breathe. Breathe.
Lustig.
Back away!
Back away! Move back!
Get everybody back.
Back away!
Put your hands back on the wall.
It hurts.
Put your hands back up on that wall.
Or what?
Just leave her alone.
She's in pain.
Don't you see what she's doing?
Chick's a twist.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that's what we used to call people like her in the Marines.
Suddenly out of the blue, everybody would start fighting with each other.
Tempers would flare, people would start getting hurt.
But then we realized it's just the new guy telling everybody what other people said, stirring shit up where there wasn't any.
Until one night when we beat the living shit out of that twist.
And then, just like that, everything would go back to normal.
Are you threatening me?
I just want you to know that I know.
Why don't you just shut up and keep your hands on the wall?
Sarah
Caraway's husband won't talk to us.
He lawyered up.
Her lawyer told me she's locating all his money.
I bet she's about to leave him and he might know it.
That would definitely give him motive to kill her.
But if he's trying to kill his wife, why are Jane Kowski and Vince McCormick dead?
This is Matt with
Caraway Security.
I need someone from maintenance to come down and shut the bay doors.
Sarah Caraway's husband doesn't own Caraway Security, does he?
Meet me in the office!
He's not done yet.
It's the Kensington sniper all over again.
What's a Kensington sniper?
A few years ago, a guy shot four strangers and then his own wife, trying to make a personal killing look like a serial.
The guard works for the woman's husband.
I think the two victims were just a decoy.
The guard is gonna kill her.
I need to be in that elevator right now!
Move!
Right.
Please don't let him kill me, Ben.
I won't.
Come over here next to me and I'll keep you safe.
Don't worry. Come on.
Hold up your cell phones.
Use the screens as flashlights.
Don't let it go dark in there.
Keep the light on each other.
Keep shining it all around the elevator.
Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Oh, my God. It is you.
Please, lady.
They can't hear you.
You don't have to pretend anymore.
We both know who did this.
Yeah, we do.
Put down the glass and get your hands on the wall now!
I should kill you right now.
I should kill you right now before you try anything else.
I should cut you right now.
And what'll be your defense? Huh?
"She killed them all, so I had to kill her"?
Yeah, something like that.
You take me down, they're pinning all of this on you and you know it.
A big, tough guy like yourself.
This is what he does.
He wants us to doubt everything.
Markowitz.
Markowitz?
We're getting close, boss.
Hurry up!
How would I do it?
Do what?
According to your story, how would I save them?
There's no easy answer.
You're never gonna get these people to see themselves as they really are
'cause it's the lies that we tell ourselves, they introduce us to him.
Look at what you're doing.
Don't think just because I'm a cop
I don't know what you're going through right now.
I've been to hell.
Six months ago, I...
...checked into a hotel and I nearly drank myself to death.
The thing is, when you're self-destructing, it looks like it's the world's fault.
Like you're dealt a series of shit hands, but that's not real.
Okay? It was all on me.
All of it.
I realized my only way out of hell was to take responsibility for what I had become.
You are responsible for this.
You realize that, don't you?
Take responsibility for what you're doing.
Put down the glass.
Put down the glass.
I'll put this down if you do, too.
Okay?
We'll call a truce.
Good.
You're doing the right thing.
Sir, we found a woman who thinks she knows someone in the elevator.
Send her in.
No.
Get in there!
Get in there! Now!
We're through!
This is the woman
I was telling you...
Hold her outside!
Tony.
You know him?
He's my fiancé.
He had a job interview here today and he didn't want to bring his tools in with him.
I was late picking them up.
Tony what?
Janekowski.
Tony Janekowski.
Jane Kowski is Janekowski?
He signed in.
Then who is...
Come on, breathe.
Right there. Come on, breathe.
Breathe! Come on, come on. Please breathe.
It's her! It's her.
Get in there already.
Who are you?
- Today?
I'm an old woman.
Grab her the moment you get in.
Are you ready for your turn, Anthony?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The whores, the liars, the cheats and the deserters, it's always the same thing.
You know who I am now.
Yes?
Take me.
I intend to.
No, take me instead.
I deserve this.
You don't believe that.
Yes. Yeah, I do.
I should never have left.
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.
You think you can make some kind of bargain?
Take me instead. Please.
Stop saying that!
You think this will make you good?
You're not good.
I know.
You think you can make up for the choices you made?
No.
You think you can be forgiven?
No.
Channel eight.
I killed a mother and her son on Bethlehem Pike five years ago.
Uh.
It was a hit-and-run and I was never caught.
I'm so sorry.
No.
Damn.
I really wanted you.
Come on, come on, come on!
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
I'll take him in.
That was my family on Bethlehem Pike.
That was my son.
I've been waiting for this moment for five years.
All the things
I'd say to you and what I'd do.
The thing is...
...I forgive you.
After my mother would finish her story, she would always comfort us.
"Don't worry," she'd say.
"If the Devil is real, then God must be real, too."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...we are beginning our descent into Berlin Tegel...
...where local time is 8:30 a.m. and the temperature is a cool minus four degrees.
Morning.
Did you sleep?
No. I'll sleep at the hotel.
You'll do great.
You always do.
What's the purpose of your visit?
We're here for a biotechnology summit.
I'm giving a presentation.
Mr. And Mrs. Harris, welcome to Berlin.
Danke schön.
Next, please.
"I'm giving a presentation"?
Well, she asked.
- Oof. Welcome to Berlin.
- Taxi.
Taxi.
UNKNOWN
Martin, get in the car. Let him do that.
Oh, ya-ya.
What do you think he's saying?
No idea.
Look. Isabel Kronenberger is showing here on Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
Remember when we saw her in Chicago?
Yes.
Why don't I meet you there on Saturday after my lunch with Professor Bressler?
Yeah.
If you promise.
I promise.
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
- Thank you.
You check in, honey.
I'll take care of this.
Have you stayed with us before?
- First time in Berlin.
- First time in Berlin.
If there's anything else
I can do for you....
How much do I owe you?
Thirty-seven, sir.
Welcome to the Adlon Kempinski Berlin.
How may I help you, madam?
Dr. And Mrs. Harris, the Eisenhower suite.
Of course.
- Wait, wait.
- Everything okay, sir?
- Is this everything from the taxi?
- Yes, sir.
I'm afraid, Mrs. Harris, but the Eisenhower suite may not be available right now.
What do you mean "not available"?
There have been changes, security reasons.
But we confirmed two weeks ago.
Would you allow me to answer the phone?
I'll go to the airport.
I'll be back, okay?
Oh, please.
Excuse me, driver?
Is there another route?
Oh, come on.
- Look out!
- No!
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?
Dr. Farge?
Dr. Farge. Dr. Farge.
I don't speak German.
Are you English?
American.
You have been in an accident.
Accident?
Can you tell me your name?
Your name.
Martin. Martin Harris.
Dr. Martin Harris.
Where's my wife, Liz?
- Is she hurt? Is she hurt? Where is she?
- Calm down.
It's all right, Dr. Harris.
You were the only passenger.
The taxi you were in went into the river.
Your heart stopped for several minutes.
It's Thursday, November 24th.
You have been in a coma for four days.
Thanksgiving.
But my wife, she's in Berlin with me.
Where is she? Why isn't she here?
We couldn't find any identification with you, Dr. Harris.
No, no, no.
- Please, calm down.
- Aah.
Where can we reach your wife?
Does she have a cell phone?
Of course she has a cell phone. It's....
Uh....
I can't remember.
Can you tell me what you do remember,
Martin?
Bits and pieces.
Arriving at the airport.
Getting in a taxi with Liz...
...but I don't know how I got here.
There are no rules with severe trauma of this kind.
Memories get lost or fractured.
Most of them return, although it's unlikely...
...you will ever fully recall the events around your accident.
In the meantime, let us see if anyone has filed a report...
...looking for a Martin Harris, okay?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay.
From London with Kevin Spencer and Diana Bailey.
Good evening.
Welcome to the BNI World News.
Here are today's top stories.
The Prime Mini--
Clothes. For you.
Has anybody been looking for me? My wife?
Meine Frau?
Come here, you.
It's beautiful. Just beautiful.
I'm glad you like it.
She gave it to me as a gift.
In Paris. On our honeymoon.
Prince Shada arrived in Berlin today for this year's biotechnology global summit.
The personal attendance of the flamboyant prince...
...has fueled speculation that the summit, now in its 10th year...
...will witness the announcement of a major scientific breakthrough.
With the world's leading researchers convening...
...at the luxurious Hotel Adlon in Central Berlin...
- Hotel Adlon.
- ...the field of biotechnology...
...steps into the forefront of the media spotlight.
I'm here for the summit.
Nurse.
You have to realize the risk.
Doctor, I've been gone for four days.
My wife is out there in a city she doesn't know. She'll be terrified.
I need to find her.
Sign this.
It releases you from my care.
And here's my card.
Any nausea, dizziness, difficulty with speech, you contact me immediately.
- Do you understand?
- Thank you.
Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
How may I help you?
Yes, hi. I'm a guest of the hotel.
I lost my room key. I need a new one.
- What room are you staying in?
- The Eisenhower suite.
- And may I have your name?
- Martin Harris. Dr. Martin Harris.
And may I please see some ID,
Mr. Harris?
There's been a situation.
I've lost my passport.
I'm going to need some ID, sir.
If you get someone to escort me to my room, I can prove it.
Just give me a moment.
- Excuse me. Do you have an invitation?
- No.
I mean, yes. My name is
Dr. Martin Harris. I'm on the list.
- Let me check.
- I saw my wife go inside.
I'm trying to find her.
Herr Strauss?
- Dr. Martin Harris?
- Yes.
Yes. There you are. I'm Herr Strauss, head of the Hotel Security.
Do you have any identification?
Passport, driver's license?
No, I don't, but--
- You would know him, he's over there.
- Professor Bressler!
- Professor Bressler!
- Sir, please.
He knows me. He can confirm who I am.
If you will be patient, sir, no problem.
I'm being very patient.
Thank God. There she is. That's my wife, over there by the buffet table.
I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me...
...so I need you to take me to her right now.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- The lady in the dark dress.
- Okay.
Excuse me, madam.
Your husband is here.
Liz. Oh, Jesus.
Excuse me. Do I know you?
But, Liz-- What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I was in an accident. I was in a coma.
They didn't know who I was.
I said I'm sorry.
Oh, you must have me confused with someone else.
Liz.
It's me, Martin.
Your husband.
This is a misunderstanding.
I don't know this man.
- Okay.
- Martin.
This is my husband.
You are Dr. Martin Harris?
Last time I looked.
Yep, still me.
What's going on here?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Joke about what?
Because it's not very funny.
- Do you know this man?
- No.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Okay. Okay.
Would you mind just getting him away from us, please?
- Liz. Liz, stop this.
- Hey.
- Gentlemen, please, please, please.
- Get your hands off me.
- Back off.
- What's going on?
- Tell me.
- Back off!
- What's this all about?
- Why don't you take a walk?
Gentlemen, please.
- Don't touch me.
- Come on, come on!
If you don't leave now, we have to call the police.
Call the police! Call the goddamn army!
That's a good idea!
What's happening?
You're embarrassing me. Please.
- Get him out of here.
- Liz!
- I must apologize. Have a nice evening.
- I was hurt!
- Liz! Why are you doing this to me?
- You okay?
Can you believe this?
Right there.
That's Liz. And I am....
I must've been outside.
I can't remember.
Well, as you can see, you are not there.
Immigration confirms the arrival of a Dr. And Mrs. Harris...
- ...on November the 20th at 7:40 a.m.
- Yes.
At 8:50, she checked into their suite at the hotel...
...followed by Dr. Harris at 3 in the afternoon.
- What?
- Danke.
Wait. He's-- He's not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.
The man upstairs is pretending to be me.
And this impostor, did he also steal your wife?
He must be forcing her or something.
Well, why? Help me. Why?
For God's sake, just do an Internet search.
There are over 400 Martin Harrises in the United States, sir.
We already checked.
Rod. Rodney Cole, a colleague at Langemore in the States.
A dear friend. He can verify who I am.
Please, call him. It's 001...
This is Dr. Cole. I'm having an....
Sorry, answering machine.
Please, leave a message.
Professor Bressler. Talk to him.
He's the reason I'm in Berlin.
He invited me over to the summit to discuss my thesis.
- You know Professor Bressler?
- Yes.
Well, we haven't actually met, but we've been speaking on the phone...
...e-mailing, dozens of times.
- Why don't you arrest him?
- For what?
Entering the country legally?
Presenting all the correct documentation and sharing a hotel suite with his wife?
Excuse me. With your wife.
She is my wife.
Herr Strauss? I found a Dr. Martin Harris at Langemore University.
Yes. Thank you.
That's what I've been trying....
Okay.
Wait, please, wait.
You're going to arrest me?
I demand to speak to my embassy.
Unfortunately, it's your Thanksgiving.
The embassy's closed until Monday.
Herr Strauss, can I have a quiet word, please?
Okay.
Listen...
...you're probably right. I--
The accident.
I, uh--
I haven't been remembering things very well. I'm confused.
This is my doctor at the hospital here in Berlin.
He warned me that this sort of thing, this was gonna happen.
I need to go back there now.
I'm so embarrassed.
So now you are saying that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?
I don't know.
Wait, stop. Stop. I've changed my mind.
- Need passport.
- Please.
Please?
Police. Very bad.
This is Dr. Cole.
I'm having an out-of-office experience right now. Please, leave a message.
Rodney, it's me, Martin.
Listen, I'm in Berlin for the summit, but....
It's Liz. She's--
I-- I don't know what she's doing...
...and there's another man involved.
It-- She-- She....
I'm in trouble, Rod. We--
Shit.
He says he doesn't care if she saved your life.
The bitch cost him 20,000 Euros.
The insurance won't cover the cab as she had no license.
He says illegal immigrants are destroying German society.
So I'm guessing he doesn't know where she is.
No one knows where she is.
Well, thank him for his time.
Excuse me.
Hey, American.
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.
You know where she is, I can tell.
Look, I just wanna thank her.
She saved my life.
I thought maybe I could give her some money. I just wanna thank her.
Please.
You remember me?
- I was in your taxi.
- I don't drive taxi.
I was in your taxi.
We crashed.
I need to know, where did you pick me up?
- Where was I going?
- How did you find me?
Your friend, Biko.
Just leave me alone.
Please, help me.
Just leave me alone.
Thank you for saving me.
Excuse me.
I need to find Professor Bressler's lab.
I have an appointment at 12:30. I'm late.
- Your name, please?
- Dr. Martin Harris.
Wait here, please.
The professor knows who I am.
We scheduled this appointment weeks ago.
Drake, the English botanist...
...who wondered how it manages to reproduce...
...as it doesn't appear to attract any insects.
Yes. One wonders how plants are developing firm, unlike m--
- Bressler.
- This lab is restricted. Who are you?
This man is not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.
So, what is this?
There are two Martin Harrises, huh?
No, let me explain.
This man showed up at my hotel last night claiming to be me.
- The police were called.
- I called the police, son of a bitch!
He checked himself out of a hospital.
- He was in an accident.
- Professor.
Ja. Danke.
We talked, you and I, on the phone.
We discussed alternative forms of propagation.
I told you about my father, a schoolteacher, his passion for science.
We talked about your children...
...about how much time you've spent with them since you lost your wife.
Two girls, right?
You told me their names. And I....
I just can't....
I know them. I know them.
- Laurel.
- Laurel, Lily, twins.
Ten years old.
About the same age I was when I told my father I wanted to be a botanist.
Do you remember, Professor?
We talked about that on the phone...
...how I'd never seen my father this happy.
No, that wasn't you.
Don't you remember? We spoke about how brave our wives were--
To marry scientists.
- I told you about our--
- Our honeymoon in Paris.
My wife and l. And how she wanted to visit all the museums.
- All I wanted to do was go to the--
- L'Ecole Polytechnique.
But she insisted. And that's how
I first saw Leonardo's Vitruvian man.
Wow.
This is not happening.
STUDENT:
Moment, Moment.
I don't know who this man is, but he has taken everything from me.
You have to arrest him.
Go on, arrest him.
I don't believe I need to do this.
No.
My friend, he...
...looks....
No, he finds people.
Martin.
The mistake was mine.
I should never have let you leave.
- What's happening to me, doctor?
- Confusion...
...memory loss, complete or partial loss of identity.
These are common stages in recovery.
A person can awaken from a coma...
...convinced of a reality that was previously only fantasy.
We are going to sedate you now...
...do another MRI, try to find out what's going on, okay?
If I'm not Martin Harris, why do I know so much about him?
Perhaps he was someone you read about...
...or met once in passing.
Do you know what it feels like to become insane, doctor?
It's like a war between being told who you are...
...and knowing who you are.
Which do you think wins?
Hello, Martin.
This won't take very long.
GRETCHEN:
SMITH:
GRETCHEN:
It's okay.
I'm feeling much, much better.
And now with us,
Rebecca for the weather.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
So it's going to be a cold night here in Central Berlin...
...with an overnight low of three degrees...
...and a high probability of more snow throughout tomorrow.
And now to the West, to the Ruhr valley.
- Herr Jürgen?
- Yeah?
You met her?
She looked after me in the hospital.
She was kind to me too.
I'm sorry. She's dead.
Come. Come in.
Thank you.
Drink?
No, thanks.
I was a former member of the Stasi...
...the Ministry for State Security.
- East German secret police, huh?
- Yes.
Proudly.
Excuse me.
I cannot drink any longer, but I like to forget that.
We Germans are experts at forgetting.
We forgot we were Nazis.
Now we have forgotten 40 years of Communism, all gone.
But it's not just history that's forgotten, it's people too.
Please tell me more about
Nurse Gretchen Herfort.
Quite a story.
For a moment, they had me convinced I was crazy.
But when they came to take me, when they...
...killed your friend, I knew.
I'm not sure how I can be of service.
I need you to help me prove I'm me.
May I?
Please.
It's a gift from my father.
I always have it with me.
These mean anything to you?
No. It's my wife's writing.
So they mean something to her.
That's my schedule for this week.
I wrote it from memory.
Your wife's involvement in this.
There must have been something in the past, a new friend, an acquaintance?
No, no, no.
Unexplained absence?
No, no. There was nothing.
I would've known.
Men always like to think.
It's not Liz. I know her.
Yet she does not know you.
Look, whoever's been doing this, they've been planning it for some time.
They have passports, credit cards, family photos, for God's sakes.
I mean, this takes preparation, doesn't it?
They have detailed knowledge of my research, my relationship with Professor--
As well as the fact that you were going to have a random accident...
...that would allow a stranger to seamlessly take your place?
These people may be good, but they are not God.
A little confirmation would be nice.
Somewhere there's proof.
They can't have thought of everything.
The question is, why would they want to take your place?
What could they gain from being you?
What does your wife gain by denying you exist?
Do you believe me?
In the Stasi, we had a basic principle:
Ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story...
...but a man who tells the truth cannot change his...
...however unlikely his story sounds.
- Do you believe me?
- I believe...
...you are telling the truth,
Dr. Harris.
I'll start by calling your colleague at Langemore.
As you say, it's Thanksgiving, and there's the time difference...
...so it may take time to make contact.
Then there is the question of....
Oh, of money. Of course.
Unfortunately, yes. Money.
Of course. Here.
Here's everything I have.
I'll pay you in full as soon as I can.
- For expenses.
- Sure.
I'll need 24 hours.
Call me tomorrow afternoon.
And go find your taxi driver.
See if she'll talk to me.
She was there at the beginning of all this.
- Perhaps she knows something.
- I've already tried.
There may be details we've overlooked.
That's what I was really known for, details.
Gina?
I know why you ran away from the accident.
You're an illegal.
If the police had picked you up, they would have deported you.
Look, I want you to have this.
- What if I don't want it?
- It's worth at least 5000 Euro.
Feel the weight of it.
Go on. It's the real thing.
"E.H. to M.H."?
Elizabeth Harris, my wife, to me, Martin. Special gift.
Okay, Martin Harris. What do you want?
There's someone I need you to speak to.
- I'm not talking to the police.
- He's not the police. I promise you.
I just need you to tell him what happened.
Anything, everything you can remember.
And I need a place to crash tonight.
Please?
Sentiment, it's always the first thing to go.
OFFICER:
Brandt.
Jürgen?
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel.
You wanted to go to the airport.
You were in a hurry.
That's it?
But I'd just arrived.
Doesn't make sense.
She didn't recognize you?
How long have you been married?
- Five years.
- Five years?
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.
This is it.
Sorry, no elevator.
I know, not the Adlon Hotel.
The walls are made of cardboard, but it's home.
I have to work tonight.
You can sleep in there.
I have extra mattress.
It's quaint.
Would you mind if I took a shower?
You could try.
I'm not sure you will fit.
The light is broken.
You need to leave the door open if you want to see anything.
- I'm sorry. I just-- I'm sorry.
- I give you a place to stay.
- That does not give you the right to--
- You're right.
They're good, the drawings.
You want to know?
This is me.
Two thousand two hundred fifty-eight Euros...
...and counting.
I get to 4000, I can buy papers so I can get the hell out of here.
Sell the watch.
You'll get more than you need.
I plan to.
Ohh.
How do you sleep?
Eh. He never goes for very long.
This guy, Jürgen.
He's absolutely no danger to you.
Okay.
Hello.
You got company.
Do you have the keys?
Bring it back to my place, leave the keys on the TV...
...and don't forget to reset the meter.
- You're the best.
- I know. Come.
Yes, I sleep with every American you send my way.
No need to explain.
Biko! You're going to be late.
Shh.
Jones?
Biko? Biko?
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
Biko's keys.
Give them to me.
Come on, you can't stay here.
This one!
Are you all right?
That guy, he killed a nurse in the hospital.
- What?
- He killed a nurse.
Shit!
- Left, go left!
- Hang on!
- Where is he?
- I can't see him.
- Where is--? Where's the wiper switch?
- It's on the left!
Shit!
Come on! Go!
- Get off the tracks!
- I'm trying to!
Jesus!
Come on, come on! Go!
- Come on!
- Run!
In here.
Out of the way. Out of the way.
- We are being followed.
- Vladimir.
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And you've told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
How do I feel?
Tell me now how do I feel?
Gina.
You have to know I have never laid eyes on those men.
Why the hell did you have to get into my taxi?
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.
And Biko. His family is in Africa.
The money will just stop coming.
They will never know why.
Men like that, back there.
I have seen those kind of men before.
They killed my family in Bosnia.
My mother, my father, my brothers, slaughtered!
We have to disappear.
Gina, they're after me, not you.
Don't be stupid.
They're after both of us!
If they killed Biko, they'll kill me just as easily.
Are you ready?
Don't ask.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I brought more trouble into your life.
I will try and make up for it.
I promise.
I know.
I've figured something out.
It's a simple code.
The first number refers to a page in the book...
...the second to a line on that page, the third to words on that line.
What are the words?
The Latin names of two plant species:
Calochortus albus and Umbellularia Californica.
Fairy Lantern and California Bay, both common, flowering plants.
What does it mean?
That I don't know.
Not part of your work, or Professor Bressler's?
No.
Tell me, Martin, how close are Professor Bressler and Prince Shada?
Very close. The prince is sponsoring the summit. They're both progressives.
Bressler wants to end world hunger.
He's researching new forms of crop cultivation...
...offering open access to his data.
The prince funds his work.
He knows the world will need food long after his oil resources are depleted.
Those agricultural patents will be worth a fortune.
But the prince's progressiveness has cost him.
Extremists in his own country hate him...
...and yet he perseveres his course, despite multiple attempts on his life.
There's a cocktail party before Bressler's speech tonight, is that correct?
Yes.
For some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you.
Martin Harris with just a few guests...
...in a confined space with Prince Shada.
Jürgen may be right, but he might not be able to prove it.
I need to find Liz.
Oh, Martin, that is not a good idea.
The people who have her have been sticking to my schedule.
I know where she'll be today.
Someone will be watching her.
What if he's there?
He won't be. He's me, remember?
He'll be meeting with Bressler.
- Yeah?
- They just sat down.
Let me know when they leave. Thanks.
Okay.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Liz.
What are you doing here?
Liz. What's happening?
Are you crazy?
You have to leave me alone.
Why? You have to tell me why.
Are they making you do this?
- Are they threatening you?
- How did you find me? Did you follow me?
When we arrived, you saw the ad.
You mentioned when we first saw her show, in Chicago, together.
Don't you remember?
- I can't get out.
- Come with me right now.
No. They'll kill us both.
I never should have left you. I never should have gotten into that taxi.
You don't understand, do you?
Your briefcase.
It got left behind at the airport.
That's why you were going back.
You need to find it.
Wait for me there.
Liz, Liz, wait.
I love you.
- What did she say?
- Not here.
Where have you been? Hm?
I have to go to the airport right away.
Ja?
- Is this Ernst Jürgen?
- Yes, it is.
My name is Rodney Cole.
I received a phone message from you.
And I received two from Martin as well.
What's the problem?
Oh, dear. Oh, that's unbelievable.
The poor man.
Well, listen, here's the good news.
I've just arrived in Berlin.
Yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig, at the Hochschule für Technik.
I'm sorry, please excuse my German.
Well, I came up for the last day to hear Bressler's speech.
I could come right over.
No, no, no, it's fine.
It's no problem at all. It's not far.
I know exactly where you are.
I look forward to meeting you, Mr. Cole.
Well, then, I'll see you soon. Bye.
Rodney Cole?
Leipzig?
Herr Jürgen?
Dr. Cole.
How do you do?
Thank you.
Drink?
I have a bottle labeled brandy, which is more than likely hair lacquer...
...or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind.
No, thank you.
Maybe some coffee?
I'm making some for myself.
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
You were in the military.
In the Stasi in East Germany.
Well, my grandson's gonna be very excited to hear that.
He loves all this Cold War stuff.
Oh, look at that.
What kind of car is that?
That's a Volga GAz-24.
Suspension of a donkey cart and smelled like a tannery.
Vanished as quickly as the Wall.
Oh. This business with Martin is a hell of a thing. How did he find you?
Quite by chance, as it happens.
I would say he was damn lucky.
How can I help?
Come with us to the authorities.
Help them confirm his identity.
The authorities?
Oh, Jesus. Is it that bad?
I mean, a man comes to you with a story.
Why did you take his case?
Eh. Curiosity.
Is that all?
There's not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me.
A few questions I still think over.
One in particular from when I worked for the Aufklärung...
...our Foreign Intelligence wing.
They used to talk about a European-based assassination unit...
...called Section 15.
Freelance, deniable.
They'd work for whoever would pay.
Public sector, private sector.
Second-to-none in their planning and efficiency.
What's more, they never failed.
And I am told they are still in existence...
...but that's only rumor, of course.
You had time after I called you.
Why didn't you run?
Where should I run from Section 15,
Mr. Cole?
I can hardly walk.
Before we could get Chesterfields,
I smoked 60 machorkas a day.
Filthy Soviet things.
Killed more Russians than Stalin.
My doctors assure me I'll soon be joining their list of casualties.
I want to know how he found you.
I want every name, every source you contacted on his behalf.
And then what?
We shake hands and you go away?
Cyanide.
You never think you'll have the courage to use it.
But you do.
The best of us do.
What if he remembers everything?
What then?
Wait, wait. Please.
The combination for the lock is....
Two eight zero...
Two eight zero six three five.
Who am I?
May I?
You shouldn't stay here.
It's not safe for you.
Liz told me to wait here.
Where are you going?
You've got your life back.
I'm happy for you.
Now I need to get on with mine.
Gina.
Thank you.
It's more than I need.
It's less than you deserve.
For everything you've been through.
Go on, take it.
What if she told them where you were going?
Liz? She wouldn't.
How do you know?
Gina, she's my wife.
Yes, she is.
It's too heavy for me.
Martin.
Martin.
Oh, my God, look at you.
How are you doing?
Rodney? What are you doing here?
Well, you called me.
Don't you remember?
You left a message on my machine.
I got on the first plane I could.
- What have you gotten yourself into?
- I'm sorry to drag you into this, but--
Don't be. We've been friends for 15 years.
I know you'd do the same for me.
Let me take that for you, huh?
I've never had this happen before.
You really think you are Martin Harris, don't you?
What the hell, Rod?
You're my oldest friend.
You know who I am. It's me.
It's not this other guy. He's not--
Martin Harris? No, course he's not.
But, then, neither are you.
- What?
- There is no Martin Harris.
He doesn't exist.
You invented him.
He's your legend.
You just made him up as a cover to get into the conference.
- You're not making sense. Liz--
- Liz.
Liz is not your wife.
You were a professional team.
No. No, no. This is insane. She--
Your memories are not real.
Martin Harris is a fabrication.
You just invented a life, and then you filled in the gaps.
She's right. You're really gone on this.
She had to go in with a backup.
How do you think she feels?
They're gonna write a textbook on you someday.
And thank you for retrieving the briefcase from the airport.
Leaving it there was untidy.
It was a loose end that didn't fit in with our plans...
...and Jürgen figured us out.
By the way, he's dead.
And he died very well.
And I'm afraid that isn't something
I'm gonna be able to say about you.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Rodney!
Why are you doing this?
One year of preparation.
We did everything we could to make you come back.
Do you know how much time you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving.
I could've been home with my family, having dinner...
...instead of cleaning up your mess because you bumped your head...
...and started to believe your cover.
Tell me...
...who am I?
You were a trained assassin, and you were my best boy.
And now you're just gonna be another nameless dead junkie.
Gina, stay down!
Gina. Gina.
No. No.
"Martin Harris...
...married to Elizabeth Terman,
July 18, 2006, Martha's Vineyard.
Father died, September 9, 1987, of a heart attack."
I made it up. I made it up to kill a man I've never met.
Look, August 27th, the entry stamp.
You were in Berlin three months ago.
- Are you ready?
- Almost.
Ready.
Who are these people?
They can become anyone.
They....
We are killers.
Prince Shada is gonna be assassinated tonight.
There's a bomb in his suite.
I put it there.
You should've let me drown.
What matters is what you do now,
Martin.
Prince Shada, are you going to stay in Berlin?
Will you be funding research at the university?
Are you interested in GM crops, Prince Shada?
How long have you been working with Professor Bressler?
GUARD:
We're so honored you could attend.
The honor is all mine.
Would you like a drink?
In some circles...
...my husband is more well-known for his martinis than his research.
- Do you have an invitation, sir?
- I don't know if I'm supposed to have...
- ...an invitation.
- Leo, please, come in.
I don't think you need an invitation to your reception.
Good to see you.
So good to see you.
Have you met our host?
- Not yet.
- Hello.
Now I can see why somebody would pretend to be him.
This way.
Oh, let me take that.
I'd rather hold on to this, if you don't mind.
Oh, you can trust me, Professor.
Separation anxiety.
- Just leave it there, if you could.
- Of course.
Thank you.
Danke.
Come, say hello to my friends.
Danke schön.
Oh, excuse me.
It's you.
I am not so sure about that.
Many of my relatives would not agree.
This way.
Get your hands off her!
Okay, I'm coming.
There's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.
I put it there three months ago!
Now you are saying you are
Dr. Martin Harris?
You're not listening!
Take me to the room.
I'll show you exactly where it is.
Up to the room, in the middle of a party with Prince Shada...
...and the world's leading scientific minds?
Of course, why didn't you say so before?
I'm not lying!
Pull up the reception recordings from August 27th of this year.
Do it now, or many people will die!
- Excuse me, I'm going to grab my bag.
- Sure.
Here. Why don't you just wear it?
Like some nerdy accessory?
Oh.
Thank you.
That's got all your secrets in it, right?
If you'd like to say so....
Would you excuse me?
I have to go check on something.
Stop. Stop. That's it.
Do you see? Look! Do you see?
Attention, attention...
...could all guests leave the hotel by the front entrance?
- Shit.
- Attention, attention...
...could all guests leave the hotel by the front entrance?
Find the target. Finish it.
We got what we came for.
I'm going to take care of the bomb.
- Forget about it.
- They have my image on file...
- ...from when we planted it.
- So?
I don't want my face connected to an explosion we no longer need.
Go!
Lily, Laurel.
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel.
Flowering plants.
Calochortus albus and Umbellularia Californica.
The code, from the book.
They're his passwords.
Bressler's supposedly working on a new strain of corn.
One that can grow in any climate.
It's revolutionary.
If they access his research and kill him...
...it could be worth billions in the wrong hands.
Laurel! Laurel!
- Papa!
- Laurel!
That bomb goes off, it'll look as if
Shada was killed by extremists.
The prince was never the target.
It's Bressler.
Listen, listen!
You have to tell Strauss, they're after Bressler!
Do you understand?
Go! Go!
Out of the way! Move! Move!
- Laurel! Laurel!
- Papa!
Laurel! Laurel!
Oh, Laurel.
Papa!
She was wandering around, looking for you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- We have to leave.
- Yes, yes.
Christ, you really don't remember anything, do you?
This'll be at the party...
...where we'll access Bressler's computer and steal his files.
The client wants this clean.
He wants the material from Bressler's computer and Bressler dead.
No one can ever know what happened.
When the bomb goes off, it'll appear that Shada was the target...
...and that Bressler was collateral damage.
Looks great.
Time for the A team?
I didn't forget everything.
I remember how to kill you, asshole.
Less than 24 hours after the failed assassination attempt..
...on the Saudi prince...
...Nobel laureate Professor Leo Bressler announced the development...
...of a new strain of corn...
...fast-growing, self-propagating, drought-tolerant, and pest-resistant...
...to be made available worldwide without patent or copyright costs.
We have made the genetic map of this new sustenance available to all.
It's a gift.
It's a gift from Prince Shada and from science to mankind.
Humanitarian organizations applauded the announcement...
...but agri-business companies were taken by surprise...
...and watched as stocks plunged
14 percent.
This is Annabelle Mandeng reporting from Berlin.
And in other news, the European Parliament today passed legislation...
...to remove trade tariffs on imported African rice...
...with 582 members of the 736-seat body voting to ratify the measure.
Hey. Now you're free to do whatever you want.
Claudia Marie Taylor.
- I like it.
- It suits you.
Who are you?
Henry. Henry Taylor.
Ahh. Nice to meet you, Mr. Taylor.
Nice to meet you.
There is a town in Maine...
I'd like a room. Welcome to Storybrooke.
Where every storybook character you've ever known...
Is trapped between two worlds...
An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
And now they don't remember who they are.
Victims of a powerful curse...
Everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.
That can only be broken by one person.
It's your destiny. You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
You enjoy your stay.

Once Upon A Time S01E02
"The Thing You Love Most"
** Don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** don't wear fear **
** or nobody will know you're there **
** just lift your head **
** and let your feelings out instead **
** and don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by, on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by ** the missing pages...  where are they?
It's an old book. Stuff's missing.
What do you care?
I care because you think
I am some evil queen.
And that hurts me, Henry.
I am your mother.
No, you're not.
Well, then, who is?
That woman you brought here?
I don't like what she or this book is doing to you.
Thankfully both are no longer an issue.
What?
Hey, how about that?
Guess those rusty old innards finally straightened themselves out, huh?
Yes, how about that, indeed.
Did you know the honey crisp tree is the most vigorous and
Hardy of all apple trees?
It can survive temperatures as low as 40 below and keep growing.
It can weather any storm.
I have one that I've tended to since I was a little girl...
And to this day I have yet to taste anything more delicious than the fruit it offers.
Thanks.
I'm sure you'll enjoy them on your drive home.
Actually, I'm gonna stay for a while.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
Henry has enough issues.
He doesn't need you confusing him.
All due respect, madame Mayor, the fact that you have now threatened me twice in the last 12 hours makes me want to stay more.
Since when were apples a threat?
I can read between the lines.
Sorry. I just want to make sure Henry's okay.
He's fine, dear.
Any problems he has are being taken care of.
What does that mean?
It means I have him in therapy.
It's all under control.
Take my advice, Ms. Swan, only one of us knows what's best for Henry.
Yeah, I'm starting to think you're right about that.
It's time for you to go.
Or what?
Don't underestimate me, Ms. Swan.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
I shall destroy your happiness...
If it is the last thing I do.
Hey!
Would you like something to drink?
Do I look like I need a drink?
I was only trying to help.
Thank you.
Now that was an awfully big threat.
Destroy everyone's happiness?
How do you plan on accomplishing that?
The dark curse.
Are you sure, your majesty?
You said you'd never use it.
You made a deal when you gave away that curse.
You traded it away.
She won't be happy to see you.
Since when do I care about anyone else's happiness but mine?
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to the forbidden fortress.
How are you, dear?
I'm doing fine.
Are you?
If it were me,
I'd be simply tortured, watching that flake of snow so happy.
Weren't you about the same age when you were to be married before she ruined it all? Yes, you were.
Yes, it was about the same age you were when that sleeping beauty got the best of you, my dear maleficent.
I soldiered on, as you will, too, hopefully.
Enough games. You know why I'm here.
I need my curse back.
It's not yours anymore. A deal's a deal.
I traded you my sleeping curse.
Which failed, undone by a simple kiss.
Now please, return what's mine.
The dark curse? Really?
You must know that not even its unholy power can bring your loved one back from the dead.
Have you considered a pet?
They can be quite comforting.
The only comfort for me is Snow White's suffering.
Well, it's her wedding night.
I doubt she's suffering right now.
I need that curse.
I know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff.
Hidden for the good of all, old friend.
Whoever created that monstrosity makes the two of us look positively... moral.
Who did give it to you?
Where I got it's none of your concern.
Hand it back.
Must we do this?
Alas, we must.
No!
Love is weakness, maleficent.
I thought you knew that.
If you're going to kill me, kill me.
Why would I do that?
You're my only friend.
Don't do this. This curse... there are lines even we shouldn't cross.
All power comes with a price.
Enacting it will take a terrible toll.
It will leave an emptiness inside you...
A void you will never be able to fill.
So be it.
Who among us is tired of losing?
That's why I called you here...
To put an end to our misery.
Today we claim victory...
And move to a new, better realm...
A place where we can finally win.
And we'll be happy?
I guarantee it.
But first,
I need something from you... a lock of hair from those with the darkest souls.
You must trust me, because if you don't, there are other ways.
A wise decision.
All that remains is the final ingredient...
A prized heart...
From my childhood steed...
The glorious beast whose passing will fuel our victory.
Let my wrath be unleashed.
Yeah, you really unleashed something there.
The "mirror" strikes again.
You're late.
Sorry. I wanted to bring you the latest edition.
I assure you it's one of my better hatchet jobs.
That's not what I asked for.
What'd you find out about her?
Well, the truth be told, there wasn't much.
She spent a lot of time in foster homes.
Uh, she got into some trouble when she was a kid, but the details are locked up pretty tight.
Since then, she's clean.
Bounced around all over.
The only thing I really learned was that she doesn't like to sit still.
That appears to have changed.
Did you know that, um, she had Henry while she was in Phoenix?
How'd he wind up here in Maine?
So if I'm understanding you correctly...
You found nothing of value,
which means you have no value, Sidney.
Do you know what I do with things that hold no value to me?
I throw them away.
I'll keep looking.
Here you go.
Thank you, but I did not order that.
Yeah, I know. You have an admirer.
Ah, so you decided to stay.
Observant...  important for a cop.
It's good news for our tourist business.
It's bad for our local signage.
It's... it's a joke.
Because you ran over our sign.
Look, the cocoa was a nice gesture, and I am impressed that you guessed that I like cinnamon on my chocolate,
'cause most people don't, but I am not here to flirt, so thank you, but no, thank you.
I didn't send it.
I did.
I like cinnamon, too.
Don't you have school?
Duh. I'm 10. Walk me.
So what's the deal with you and your mom?
It's not about us. It's about her curse.
We have to break it.
Luckily, I have a plan.
Step one... identification.
I call it Operation Cobra.
Cobra? That has nothing to do with fairy tales.
Exactly. It's a code name to throw the queen off the trail.
So everyone here is a fairy tale character... they just don't know it?
That's the curse.
Time's been frozen, until you got here.
Hey!
Where'd you get that?
Your mom?
Don't eat that.
O-okay.
Uh, all right, what about their pasts?
They don't know. It's a haze to them.
Ask anyone anything, and you'll see.
So for decades, people have been walking around in a haze, not aging, with screwed-up memories, stuck in a cursed town that kept them oblivious.
I knew you'd get it.
That's why we need you.
You're the only one who can stop her curse.
Because I'm the daughter of
Snow White and Prince Charming... yes, and right now we have the advantage.
My mom doesn't know that.
I took out the end, the part with you in it.
See? Your mom is Snow White.
Oh, kid.
I know the hero never believes at first.
If they did, it wouldn't be a very good story.
If you need proof, take them, read them, but whatever you do, don't let her see these pages.
They're dangerous.
If she finds out who you are...
It would be bad.
I gotta go, but I'll find you later and we can get started.
I knew you'd believe me!
I never said I did.
Why else would you be here?
It's good to see his smile back.
I didn't do anything.
You stayed.
So does the Mayor know you're still here?
Oh, she knows. What is her deal?
She is not a great people person.
How did she get elected?
She's been Mayor as long as I can remember.
No one's ever been brave enough to run against her.
She inspires quite a bit of...
Well, fear.
I'm afraid I only made that worse by giving Henry that book.
Now he thinks she's the evil queen.
Who does he think you are?
Oh. It's silly.
I just got five minutes of silly.
Lay it on me.
Snow White.
Who does he think you are?
I'm not in the book.
Can I ask you a favor?
Regina mentioned the kid's in therapy.
Do you know where I can find the doctor?
Hey.
Emma Swan. I was, uh, just reading about you.
Let me guess... you're here for help with a little post-traumatic stress?
That diagnosis was free, by the way.
No, I'm here about Henry.
I'm sorry. I-I-I really shouldn't...
I know. I'm sorry.
Just tell me something.
This fairy tale obsession... what is causing it?
I mean, he thinks everyone is a character in his book.
That's...
Crazy.
I hope you don't talk that way in front of him.
The word "crazy" is, um, quite damaging. These stories...
They're his language.
He has no idea how to express complex emotions, so he's translating as best he can.
This is how he communicates, and he's using this book to help deal with this problems.
But he got the book a month ago.
Has he been seeing you longer than that?
Um... yes, he has.
So it's Regina, isn't it?
Uh, his mother is a... very complicated woman, and, uh, over the years, her attempts to try and bring Henry closer have only backfired.
Why don't you take a look at the file?
Um, see what I mean.
Why are you doing this?
Well, he talks about you a lot, and you're very important to him.
Thank you.
Just, uh, see that I get it back, okay?
Ms. Swan.
For the sake of the boy, be careful how you handle his belief system.
Destroying his imagination would be... be devastating.
You were right. She was just here.
Did she take the file?
Yes.
How... how did you know she was gonna come here?
Because I'm the one who gave her the idea.
Hey there.
If you're concerned about the
"do not disturb" signs, don't worry. I've left them alone.
Actually, I'm here about
Dr. Archibald Hopper.
He mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier?
No.
I was shocked, too, given your shy, delicate sensibilities.
He says you demanded to see Henry's files and when he refused, you came back and stole them.
He gave them to me.
Alas, he's telling a different tale.
May I check your room, or must I get a search warrant?
Is this what you're looking for?
Well, you're very accommodating.
I'm afraid, Ms. Swan, you're under arrest...
Again.
You know I'm being set up, don't you?
And who, may I ask, is setting you up?
Where carbon dioxide and water synthesize.
May I speak with my son?
We're in the middle of a lesson.
Is it important?
Do you think I'd be here if it wasn't?
Henry, sweetie, I have some bad news.
The woman who you brought here... she's been arrested.
She broke into Dr. Hopper's office and stole his files.
She's a con woman.
She's trying to learn about us in order to take advantage of us.
That's why she's sticking around.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
I know you think otherwise, but all I'm doing is trying to protect you.
This is gonna be good for us.
You'll see.
Things will be better.
I gotta get back to class.
You know the shrink is lying, right?
To the right, please. Why would he lie?
The Mayor put him up to this.
She's gotta have something on him.
He's terrified of her like everyone else in this...
Town.
To the left.
Regina may be...
A touch intimidating, but I don't think she'd go as far as a frame job.
How far would she go?
What does she have her hands in?
Well, she's the Mayor.
She has her hands in everything.
Including the police force?
Hey.
Henry. Henry, what are you doing here?
His mother told him what happened.
Of course she did.
Henry, I don't know what she said... you're a genius.
What?
I know what you were up to.
You were gathering intel...
For Operation Cobra?
I'm sorry. I'm a bit lost.
It's need-to-know, sheriff, and all you need to know is that Ms. Blanchard's gonna bail her out.
You are?
Why?
I, uh, trust you.
Well, if you can uncuff me,
I have something to do.
What the hell are you doing?
Picking apples.
You're out of your mind.
No, you are, if you think a shoddy frame job's enough to scare me off. You're gonna have to do better than that.
You come after me one more time,
I'm coming back for the rest of this tree.
Because, sister, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
Your move.
Maybe it's for the best.
The forces you're summoning are darker than we can conceive.
Tect me?
It's what I do.
I know.
You're the only one who does.
Helping you is my life.
Well, then help me understand why this curse isn't working.
If you want to know that, then you need to go back to the person who gave it to you in the first place.
Revenge is a dark and lonely road.
Once you go down it...
There is no heading back.
What is there for me to head back to?
It's just us, dearie.
You can show yourself.
Ahh.
That curse you gave me...
It's not working.
Oh, so worried.
So, so worried...
Like snow and her lovely new husband.
What?
They paid me a visit as well.
They were very anxious about you and the curse.
What'd you tell them?
The truth... that nothing can stop the darkness...
Except, of course, their unborn child.
You see, no matter how powerful, all curses can be broken.
Their child is the key.
Of course the curse has to be enacted first.
Tell me what I did wrong.
For that, there's a price.
What do you want?
Simple.
In this new land,
I want comfort.
I want a good life.
Fine. You'll have an estate, be rich.
I wasn't finished. There's more.
There always is with you.
Yeah.
In this new land, should I ever come to you for any reason, you must heed my every request.
You must do whatever I say,
so long as I say...
Please.
You do realize that should I succeed, you won't remember any of this?
Oh, well, then... What's the harm?
Deal.
What must I do to enact this curse?
You need to sacrifice a heart.
I sacrificed my prized steed.
A horse? This is the curse to end all curses.
You think a horse is gonna do?
Great power requires great sacrifice.
The heart you need
must come from something far more precious.
Tell me what will suffice.
The heart of the thing you love most.
What I love most died because of Snow White.
Is there no one else you truly love?
This curse isn't going to be easy.
Vengeance never is, dearie.
You have to ask yourself a simple question... how far are you willing to go?
As far as it takes.
Then please stop wasting everyone's time and just do it.
You know what you love.
Now go kill it.
Ms. Swan.
Oh, my, this is terribly awkward.
I need to ask you to leave.
I'm afraid we have a no-felons rule.
It turns out it's a city ordinance.
Let me guess... the Mayor's office just called to remind you?
You can gather your things, but I need to have your room key back.
She destroyed city property.
I want her arrested.
Again?
What are you waiting for?
I'm just not convinced arresting her's the right plan...
And I'm not talking about your tree.
We both know she didn't steal those files.
Oh, do we? I mean, she looked pretty shocked when I leveled the charges against her.
Guess she doesn't like being caught.
Or because she was set up.
And if she was, that means
Dr. Hopper was lying.
And if he's lying, that means that someone asked him to.
Are we really confident that the man's conscience won't eventually get the best of him?
I think your schoolboy crush is clouding your judgment.
Remember, I made you sheriff, and I can take it away just as easily.
You want me to arrest her again, I will.
Good.
But she's gonna keep coming at you, and I know you... you're gonna keep coming at her and you will do whatever it takes to get her out of here and you may succeed.
No, I will succeed.
He's my son. It's what's best for him.
I know that's what you believe.
Okay? But if this escalates, it seems to me the only one who will get hurt is Henry.
Yeah?
Ms. Swan,
I'd be happy to continue demonstrating my power, but am I right in guessing your resolve to stay is only growing?
You have no idea.
Well, then, I think it's time we made peace.
Why don't you drive over to my office?
Or walk... whatever suits you.
I'd like to start by apologizing,
Ms. Swan.
What?
I just have to accept the reality that you want to be here...
That's right, I do.
And that you're here to take my son from me.
Okay. Let's be clear.
I have no intention of taking him from anyone.
Well, then, what are you doing here?
I know I'm not a mother...
I think that's pretty self-evident... but I did have him, and I can't help it... he got in my head and I want to make sure he's okay.
The more you try to push me out, the more I want to be here, especially after seeing how troubled he is.
You think he's troubled?
Well, he's in therapy, and I only got through a couple pages of his shrink's notes before you had me arrested, but putting all that aside... he thinks everyone in this town is a fairy tale character.
And you don't?
How can I?
The poor kid can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and it's only getting worse.
It's crazy.
You think I'm crazy?
Henry.
How long was he there?
Long enough.
You knew he would be here.
Did I know that my son comes to my office every Thursday at precisely 5:00 P.M.
So I can take him for dinner before his therapy session?
Of course I did.
I'm his mother.
Your move.
You have no soul.
How in the hell did you get like this?
What happened? Did you get your answer?
What's going on?
Your majesty?
Your majesty!
Did Rumplestiltskin tell you what you needed to know?
Yes.
And?
I'm not sure I should say.
I'm conflicted.
How bad is it?
Maybe I can help.
I have to cut out the heart of the thing I love most.
Me.
Daddy, I don't know what to do.
My dear...
Please...
You don't have to do this.
I have to do something.
Then move past this.
I know this may sound self-serving, but you don't need to enact the curse.
But I can't keep living like this.
What snow did to me, what she took from me...
It's eating me alive, daddy.
Her very existence mocks me.
She must be punished.
What's...
If the price is a hole that will never be filled, why do it?
Stop worrying about Snow
White and start over.
We can have a new life.
But what kind of life?
All I've worked for, all I've built, will be gone.
My power will disappear.
They already think I'm nothing.
Power is seductive, but so is love, and you can have that again.
I just want to be happy.
You can be. Of this I'm sure.
I believe, given the chance, we can find happiness together.
But the choice is yours.
I think you're right.
I can be happy.
Just not here.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Just wanted to say thank you and, um, pay you back the bail money.
You look like you need to talk.
Cinnamon?
Oh. I'm sorry. I should have asked.
It's a little quirk of mine.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
No, thanks.
When you bailed me out, you said that you trusted me.
Why?
It's strange... ever since you arrived here,
I've had the oddest feeling like we met before.
I mean, I know it's crazy.
I'm starting to reevaluate my definition of crazy.
For what it's worth,
I think you're innocent.
Of breaking and entering or just in general?
Whichever makes you feel better.
Doesn't really matter what anyone thinks I did or didn't do.
I'm leaving.
Thank you for everything, but I think it's for the best.
If I stay, Henry's only gonna keep getting hurt.
What happens if you go?
I think the very fact that you want to leave is why you have to stay.
You care about him.
Who will protect Henry if you won't?
Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
You know, that umbrella is kind of my good luck charm.
Is that why you think
I'm jiminy cricket?
I don't think you're anyone.
Ms. Swan.
Look, I can explain.
The Mayor forced me...  I know.
Don't worry about it.
I get it. Henry, I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
Ms. Swan, if she knew you were here... to hell with her.
Henry, there is one simple reason I stayed here... you.
I wanted to get to know you.
You think I'm crazy.
No, I think the curse is crazy, and it is.
But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.
It is a lot to ask anyone to believe in, but there are a lot of crazy things in this world.
So what do I know? Maybe it is true.
But you told my mom... what she needed to hear.
What I do know...
Is that if the curse is real, the only way to break it is by tricking the evil queen...
Into thinking that we are nonbelievers,
'cause that way, she's not on to us.
Isn't that what Operation
Cobra was all about?
Throwing her off the trail?
Brilliant.
I read the pages, and, Henry, you're right... they are dangerous.
There is only one way to make sure that she never sees these.
Now we have the advantage.
I knew you were here to help me.
That's right, kid. I am.
And nothing, not even a curse, is gonna stop that.
I love you, daddy.
What a mess.
Not for long.
What can I do for you, Mr. Gold?
I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd pop by.
Lovely to see you in such high spirits.
Well, it's been a good day.
I just rid the town of an unwanted nuisance.
Emma Swan? Really?
Yes. I imagine she's halfway to Boston by now.
I wouldn't bet on that.
I've just seen her strolling down the main street with your boy.
Thick as thieves, they looked.
What?
Perhaps you should have come to me.
If Ms. Swan is a problem you can't fix,
I'm only too happy to help, for a price, of course.
I'm not in the business of making deals with you anymore.
To which deal are you referring?
You know what deal.
Oh, right, yeah.
The boy I procured for you.
Henry.
Did I ever tell you what a lovely name that was?
How ever did you pick it?
Did you want her to come to town?
You wanted all this to happen, didn't you?
Your finding Henry wasn't an accident, was it?
What ever do you mean?
Where did you get him?
Do you know something?
I've no idea what you're implying.
I think you do.
Who is this woman, his mother, this... Emma Swan?
I would say you think you know exactly who she is.
I really must be going.
Tell me what you know about her.
I'm not gonna answer you, dear, so I suggest you excuse me.
Please.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[WOMAN CACKLING]
FRED:
Come on.
Split up.
SHAGGY: Hey, come on, Scoob.
SCOOBY: I'm right behind you, Shaggy.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
Change of plans.
WOMAN:
Stay out.
[GRUNTING]
Time to unmask the person behind this mystery.
- It's you?
- What?
Like, it can't be.
MAN: Remember, people, just because this is the last day of class...
...doesn't mean this test doesn't count.
Huh?
No.
Yes.
Cowabunga.
- Hot dog.
- Hot dog.
GIRL 1:
Let's dance.
Yeah.
[GIRL 2 WHISTLES]
Uh, guys, what are you doing?
I know you're excited the school year's over...
...but our seasonal employment awaits.
Already? Like, I didn't even have time to get a tan.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
[CHEERING]
Well, it sure is lucky that Daphne's uncle...
...is opening his new country club this summer, hey, V?
Indeed. Without these summer jobs, we'd never able to pay back...
...Old Man Frickert for the damage we did to his barn.
Say cheese.
[GIGGLES]
- What is he...?
- Oh, Scoob's got a new hobby.
Scrapbooking.
- What happened to gardening?
- It didn't work out.
Everything he planted, he'd just dig right up.
VELMA:
Hm.
Daphne said we should hit the road right after school.
Any sign of her or Fred?
Uh-uh.
[VELMA GASPS]
- Like, huh?
VELMA: Jinkies.
Ooh.
Perfect.
Well? I for one think we deserve an explanation.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
There's always been an undeniable chemistry between you two, but...
When did the transformative reaction finally occur?
I guess it started that night at Old Man Frickert's.
Yeah. Remember, Velma?
We followed the trail of the vengeful
scarecrow up into the hayloft.
This is impossible.
We'll never find anything in here.
Yes, if I wasn't so pun averse...
...I might even say it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
[MAN ROARS]
MAN:
Didn't scare you, did I?
[VELMA & DAPHNE SCREAMING]
Daphne.
Are you okay?
I am now.
SHAGGY: Like, run!
- What is it, Shaggy?
- This one's gonna be a real barn burner.
FRED: Shaggy.
Look out!
DAPHNE: And thus, we're stuck paying for a new barn.
Again, just for the record...
...nowhere on those bales of hay did it say flammable.
SCOOBY: Yeah.
- Anyway, that was also the night...
...that Fred and I realized we were just meant to be.
It's a lovely story.
But I do feel obligated to raise one concern.
Whenever there's a shift in a relationship...
...between two individuals within a group...
...it inevitably has repercussions on the group as a whole.
SHAGGY:
Oh, Velma, don't worry about that.
We're all way too mature to let that happen.
- Right, Scoob?
- I know I am.
Punch buggy white.
Ouch. Oh, good one, Scoob.
But it's a shame you didn't notice the punch buggy green.
Ow!
[SHAGGY & SCOOBY GRUNTING]
- All right.
- You know what? That is it. I've had it.
You know, I will turn this van around.
- Do I have to come back there?
DAPHNE: Scooby-Doo...
...get your tail out of my face.
DAPHNE: Fred, where are those directions I sent you to print out?
Don't worry, we're not lost.
DAPHNE: Hm. This sure doesn't look like my uncle's country club.
Oh. Hey, look. It's the S.S. Daphne.
DAPHNE:
Ha, ha.
Oh, look. Try stopping there, sweetie.
FRED:
Whatever you say, dear.
VELMA:
Oh, how quaint.
Hm.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Like, yikes. Maybe we ought to just find our own way...
...to your uncle's country club.
Zoinks!
Country club?
You're going to the country club?
Yes, we have summer jobs there.
No, you must turn back.
You must leave while you still can.
- Leave? Why would we wanna leave?
- They were fools to build there.
I tried to warn them...
...but they thought
I was just some crazy hag.
You? Heh. No.
But mark my words, the lake monster will return.
The lake monster will return.
[WHIMPERING]
- Did you get directions?
- Uh...
- Not exactly.
SHAGGY: Oh, yes, we did.
Make a U-turn and head straight back to Coolsville.
There's a monster at the lake, guys.
A monster.
- A monster?
- Mm-hm.
Would you be referring to the lake monster of Erie Pointe?
You know, I didn't catch his name.
- All I heard was "monster."
VELMA: No, look.
It says here for hundreds of years there have been sightings...
...of hideous creatures said to live at the bottom of the lake.
I get it, it's one of those things like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster.
Oh, no, it's worse than we thought.
No, Shaggy, I think what Fred means is that it's just a legend.
You know, lots of small towns make them up. They're good for tourism.
Oh. Oh, sure, you know, come for the scenery...
...stay for the certain death.
[THUD]
Come on, guys. Let's just get going or we're gonna be late.
Uh, Fred?
- We still don't know how to get there.
- Mm-hm.
Actually, yes, we do.
[SHAGGY SIGHS]
- No.
- Yes.
FRED:
Pretty swank, Daph.
DAPHNE: Yeah, looks like my uncle really outdid himself this time.
Thanks, Shaggy.
[LAUGHS]
- Is that my favorite niece?
- Uncle Thorny.
Wow.
Thank you again, uncle.
I don't know what we would've done without these summer jobs.
Yeah. And, again, just for the record...
...it's a well-known fact that scarecrows are afraid of fire...
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Gang, I'd like you to meet
Thorton Blake IV.
Fifth, actually.
Uncle Thorny, this is the gang.
This is Shaggy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Fred.
- Oh.
DAPHNE: Velma.
- Pleasure.
- And...
SCOOBY: Scooby-Doo.
Nice to meet you, Uncle Thorny.
Smile.
[SCOOBY GIGGLES]
Well, I'm sure glad to have you all on board this summer.
Grab your stuff, get settled, and park that thing in the back.
Oh. You're gonna need to get a good night's sleep.
Your shifts start at 6 a.m. sharp.
There's a 6 a. m?
[SIGHS]
And that one. It's my makeup.
[SHAGGY GRUNTING]
- Shaggy, need a hand?
- No, thanks, Fred. I got it.
It just takes a little elbow grease.
[GASPING]
Shaggy.
Shaggy, are you all right?
Like, I am now.
Shaggy.
Yes, Velma?
I don't know how much longer
I can hold you.
- Hey, Scoob?
- Huh?
- Can I talk to you man-to-man?
- Uh...
Sort of.
I think I might have just had a hayloft moment with Velma.
Do you think it's possible that...?
I don't know, that she and I are meant to be?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah. Thanks for the support, pal.
I'll remember this come flea season.
[PUFFING]
[CONTINUES LAUGHING]
[TREE BRANCHES RUSTLE]
Getting much better distance on those woods, sir.
Hey, Fred, can I talk to you man-to-man?
Sort of.
Well, you and Daphne, is that something you recommend?
What do you mean?
Well, you know, going from having...
...you know, a girl friend to a girlfriend.
Heh, heh. I don't know if I'd really call Daphne my girlfriend, Shags.
You know, it's more casual than that.
We're just, um...
- We're hanging out.
- Hanging out?
No, Fred is totally my boyfriend.
Really?
I always thought football players liked to, well...
...play the field.
- Pfft.
Me too. I never thought Fred would be the relationship type, but he totally is.
I'm just not the relationship type.
I'm a football player, we like to, uh, play the field.
Anyhow, it's summer, Shaggy.
Oh, yeah, summer. Totally.
Because who'd want a girlfriend during daylight-savings time?
Good guess, but what I'm saying...
...is summer's a time you just wanna have fun. Not get so serious.
Daphne's cool, she feels the same way.
It's totally getting serious.
Fred's cool, he feels the same way.
Well, it certainly sounds like you two are perfectly in sync.
Yeah.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[YAWNS]
SHAGGY:
Hey, Scoob.
- How was the first dog day of summer?
- Relaxing.
Glad to hear it, boy.
Now, come on, let's go get some...
Oh, hello, Velma.
- How was your day?
- Fine, I guess.
Oh, really? Like, mine was fine too.
It's crazy how much we have in common, huh?
Oh, boy.
So, guys, my uncle invited us to the opening night reception.
- What do you say?
- Awesome.
- How about a dip in the pool first?
DAPHNE: Sounds great.
Oh, like, that sounds like a real rager.
What do you think, V?
Perhaps I'll rendezvous with everyone later.
Since we arrived, I've been eager to survey the indigenous flora and fauna.
Oh, hey. Wait up.
So you say there's both flora and fauna out there, huh?
When was the last time you heard those two things in the same sentence?
[BELCHES]
Shaggy, did you know
Lake Erie is the warmest...
...and most biologically productive of the Great Lakes?
Not to mention the eleventh largest lake in the world.
[METAL DETECTOR BEEPING]
SHAGGY:
Oh, wow.
I could listen to you talk like that for hours.
Are you really interested in this stuff, Shaggy?
I've never known you to be, well, intellectually curious.
Oh, I'm curious about a lot of things, Velma.
Like...
Like people and relationships...
...and relationships between people.
Hey.
[GRUNTING]
Hey, Shaggy, you're gonna love this factoid.
Lake Erie has been gradually rising over the last few hundred years.
That means beneath all of these rock formations...
...there are miles of underwater caves.
- Get out of town.
- No, really.
You can tell by the variegated sedimentary striations.
Oh, would you look at that.
I've never seen irrigated rudimentary claymations like that before.
Hey, Velma, yesterday at the van...
Uh...
Jinkies.
Look at this, Shaggy.
I think it might actually be a moonstone.
They're very rare.
You know, the Native Americans believed...
...they held this mystical connection with the moon, thereby the name.
Look at how it glows.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It sure is.
Almost as beautiful as your eyes.
- Oh, Shaggy.
- Oh, Velma.
Oh, Shaggy, I think I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Oh, Velma, are you all right?
- I'm fine.
I just feel really nauseous all of a sudden.
SHAGGY:
Like, you better sit down.
- Here, let me help.
- No, it's okay.
I'm just gonna go back to the room and lie down for a little while.
Oh, okay.
I think she likes me.
Oy vay.
[PIANO PLAYING]
THORNY: Well, I'll catch you out there on the links, huh?
Oh.
Senator. I'm so glad you could make it.
Oh, how could I ever say no to my biggest contributor?
- How about a photograph?
- Yes.
- Good thing I dressed up, hey, Scoob?
SCOOBY: Yeah.
Hey, Shagg, Scoob. Where's Velma?
Oh. Uh, heh.
Uh, she got sick all of a sudden.
But it was totally natural causes...
...and not revulsion at the very thought of me.
Okay.
- Hey, Scoob, check out the buffet.
- Ooh.
Now, if you don't mind, one from my best side.
One more.
This will be good in my scrapbook.
Perfect.
Like, who ordered the pea soup?
THORNY:
Sorry, everyone.
I'm sure it's just a little minor glitch with one of our generators.
I'll just...
[GROWLING]
What the heck is that?
[GASPING]
- Fred?
- I don't know either, Daph.
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
[ROARING]
SCOOBY:
Lake monster.
Excuse me, I don't recall having seen your name on the guest list.
[SCREAMING]
[PHOTOGRAPHER SCREAMS]
That thing can't be real, can it?
I don't know, but I'm not getting close enough to find out.
Hi.
[ROARS]
THORNY:
No, please.
Please, everyone...
...I'm sure there's a logical explanation as to what's going on.
We'll just tidy up the tent...
...and, you know, we'll just continue the party.
Everyone... Oh, senator, senator.
MAN: Give me the keys, I'll get it myself.
WOMAN: Just go without him.
My goodness.
Why do I have the feeling
I missed something rather significant?
It was the lake monster.
The lake monster of Erie Pointe.
It was horrifying, terrifying, scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.
On a more personal note, how are you feeling, Velma?
- Did you just say the lake monster?
- Yeah.
You can't be serious.
Oh, my guests sure seemed to think it was serious.
Look at this, not even day one...
...and half of them have canceled their memberships.
If somebody doesn't figure out what's going on here quickly...
...it's gonna be a very short summer for all of us.
Guys, we have to do something.
We can't afford to lose these jobs.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
- You guys thinking what I'm thinking?
- No.
- Come on.
- Guys, please, don't...
[SIGHS]
Here we go again.
Uncle Thorny.
We just wanna let you know not to worry.
Not only did you hire summer help...
...you also hired the best supernatural detectives in the tristate area.
- I did?
- That's right.
And I know just where to start too.
With Elmer Uggins, the person who's taken...
...the only known photo of the lake monster.
FRED:
Heh. Would you look at that.
Our first suspect just happens to be the keeper of a creepy old lighthouse.
You know, just once...
...I wish we found a mystery that started in a cheery futon showroom.
What?
Futons offer far more support than traditional mattresses.
[FOGHORN BLOWS]
Well, looks like the light's on but nobody's home.
Isn't this the part when we normally split up and search for clues?
I'll go with Velma. Ha.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Okay. Come on, Daph.
[SHAGGY SNIFFING]
Oh, Velma, what is that sweet fragrance you're wearing?
Bug and tick repellent.
[MOSQUITO BUZZING]
Well, it certainly isn't repelling me.
[CLEARS THROAT]
It sure is a lovely night, huh?
I've always enjoyed strolling beneath a full moon.
Werewolves notwithstanding, of course.
I too enjoy walking by the light of the silvery moon.
[CHUCKLES]
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Wait, where's the funny?
- Oh. "By the Light of the Silvery Moon"?
- Yeah.
It's just an old vaudevillian ditty.
But I must confess,
I do have a soft spot for it.
Like, wait, I think I do know that one.

Hey, Fred, you don't think Shaggy could have a crush on Velma, do you?
Not unless she turned into a steaming bowl of chili cheese fries.
[CHUCKLES]
- Why?
- I don't know, it's just...
...he's been acting really goofy lately.
Even for Shaggy.
And he's been following Velma around like a puppy dog.
Actually, that would explain why he's been asking me...
...all those questions about dating.
But I guess he didn't take my advice.
Advice? Wait, Fred, what advice?
[CREATURE GROWLING]
Um, Velma, that wasn't what I thought it was, was it?
I don't know.
Did you surmise that it was a heretofore unclassified amphibious humanoid?
No. I thought it was a lake monster!
Zoinks!
Fred?
Exactly what advice did you give Shaggy about dating?
What?
Oh, you know, just that it's summertime and we're not really...
[CREATURE ROARS]
Come on.
Go, go, go!
SHAGGY:
It's the lake monster! Save me.
MONSTER:
Ow! My ankle.
What?
UGGINS:
Hey.
Mr. Uggins, I presume?
Call me Elmer.
Hi, kids.
So you've never actually seen the monster?
I was just using the legend to make a quick buck.
Made some postcards...
...sold them to the local tourist traps.
- Mm?
- No.
- No.
- Thanks.
Hey, what can I say?
You know, lighthouse keeping ain't exactly a growth industry.
[CHUCKLING]
Ahem. Anyway...
...when I heard about all the hoopla down at the country club tonight...
...I figured it might be a good time to dust off old green-eyes over there...
...and take some new shots.
[IMITATING CAMERA SHUTTER
CLICKING]
But listen, kids...
...if this thing's really back, you best leave now while you still can.
Come on, you don't really believe the monster's real, do you?
It's probably some prankster with a better costume.
Maybe it is and maybe it ain't.
But one thing's for sure...
...the legend is a truly terrible tale.
It all goes back to the very beginnings of town.
When the first settlers arrived in these parts...
... they was confronted
by an old woman...
... who was said to live
in a cave by the lake.
Grubwort was her name.
Wanda Grubwort.
She claimed all the land around the lake
belonged to her...
...and told the settlers that if they didn't turn back...
...they would pay the price.
But them early pioneers was not about to be turned away so easily...
...so they settled in and forgot all about her warning.
But Wanda Grubwort did not forget.
And one day, she fulfilled her dark oath.
Using her magical staff...
... she cast a spell
upon an innocent creature of the lake...
...transforming it into a hideous beast.
Once Grubwort
had her monstrous slave...
... she loosed it upon the villagers.
And then? What happened next?
Well, it's said the settlers eventually overcame Grubwort...
...tried her for witchery and burned her at the stake.
Like I said...
...you best leave now while you still can.
I'm sorry, Mr. Uggins, but we just don't give up that easy.
He obviously wasn't in my sophomore geometry class.
[UGGINS GRUNTS]
SHAGGY:
Mr. Shaggy...
...Dinkley.
It's like the angels are singing it.
- Mister...
- Hey, Shagg. What you doing?
Oh! Um... Nothing.
Doctor says I need more linen in my diet.
Okay. So, have you seen Fred?
He's out on the...
Out on the green, putting with some girls.
Girls?
FRED:
Now, just remember to follow through.
GIRL 1:
Follow through.
Hey.
GIRL 1: Thanks.
FRED: Okay, guys, I'm out of here.
- Okay, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.
GIRL 2: Bye, Fred.
FRED: Bye now.
Hey, Daph.
- What's up, Shags?
- Hey, Fred.
What?
Hey, um...
...can I ask your advice about something?
Sure.
Well, I...
See, I have this friend, okay?
His name's, um, Scruffy. Yeah, Scruffy.
They call him that...
...because he has a goatee.
No, that would be too obvious.
Anyway, so this friend of mine, who doesn't have a goatee or a dog...
...definitely doesn't have a dog either...
...he has this crush on this girl he sometimes solves mysteries with.
No, no. That's a dead giveaway.
- Let me start over. So...
- Shaggy.
It's okay. We know you like Velma.
[SCOFFS]
Oh. Oh, what?
Oh, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
I definitely do not like... Velma.
You are not gonna believe what I found in the security footage. Come on.
After you watch this,
I think you'll all be saying "jinkies."
Hey, the security camera caught the attack.
Yep. And they caught something else too.
Looks like we have two pranksters on our hands.
Jinkies.
- Told you.
- Freeze it.
If you zoom in right here, we can see who's inside that cloak.
SHAGGY:
Oh, look, it's coming into focus.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
What happened?
Like, that spooky figure must be using some sort of magic...
...to prevent us from seeing its face.
I'm afraid the explanation is slightly less supernatural than that, Shaggy.
I accidentally knocked over my green tea and short-circuited the hard drive.
- Oh.
- That's okay, Velma.
You know, I'm sure we'll find another piece of critical evidence.
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, for sure.
- It's groovy.
FRED: Don't worry.
I know this is highly uncharacteristic behavior.
I'm really sorry, guys.
I'll tender my resignation from the group if you wish.
- What?
- What?
DAPHNE: Velma.
- Come on.
Velma.
Like, hold on, V.
Don't beat yourself up about this.
You just pulled a Shaggy, that's all.
I do it all the time.
Thanks, Shaggy, but there's really no excuse.
Maybe reading a little Sylvia Plath will buoy my spirits.
Hey, I...
I still think you're wonderful.
Shaggy, that was so nice.
That's exactly how you should be if you're really serious about Velma.
Oh. Oh, what?
Oh, what do you mean?
I do not...
All right, I admit it.
I like Velma.
I'm my friend. I'm Scruffy.
But what am I gonna do?
You know, I don't know what I'm supposed to say to her.
Let me help you out, Shags.
You gotta be confident, smooth.
- Girls like guys...
- Don't listen to him.
He has no idea what girls like.
See, what girls like is to feel special.
To feel like they're the only one on a guy's mind.
Yeah, I know that.
But listen, what you wanna do...
Well, if you know that, then why don't you try it sometime?
What's with you?
Why are you acting weird?
- How exactly am I act...?
- Like, you know what?
Forget I even asked.
I'll just figure this out for myself.
Besides, if I ever get Velma to like me,
I want it to be real...
...not some loosey-goosey thing like you guys have.
Fred, did you say something to Shaggy...
...about us having a "loosey-goosey" relationship?
What? Oh, no, no.
I just told him how we're casual.
You know, how it's summer and we're just hanging out.
I mean, that is what we're doing, right?
Yes, Fred.
That is exactly what we're doing.
I'm just so glad that we're on the same page.
Well, she's not the president of the drama club for nothing.
I like you, Velma Dinkley.
So, what do you say?
- Will you go on a date with me?
- Sorry, not my type.
Like, come on, Scoob.
Forget Velma.
Time for a midnight snack.
SHAGGY: A what?
- A midnight snack.
You know, a couple of sandwiches, a rack of ribs, pepperoni?
- What?
- Oh, just follow me. Whew.
Just my luck.
I've got a talking dog and I can't understand a word he says.
SHAGGY:
Mm, mm, mm.
Sandwich, look out.
[SNIFFS THEN SIGHS]
Is that Eau de' Dinkley I detect?
Shaggy?
Shaggy? Hey, what about my midnight snack?
[GROWLS]
Huh.
DAPHNE:
Nice shot.
Mine.
[MAN GRUNTS
AND DAPHNE SHRIEKS]
Velma?
Where is she?
[TWIG CRACKS]
[SIGHS]
Oh, Velma, is that you?
[ROARS]
[SCREAMS]
Oh, hi, Fred.
Is something wrong?
SHAGGY:
Help!
- Help, help!
- Come on.
- Shaggy.
- Aah!
- What's wrong?
- Oh.
Oh, you know, nothing.
I just thought I'd work on my blood-curdling scream.
What the heck do you think is wrong?
It's the lake monster.
Whoa!
That's it, time to unmask this prankster once and for all.
[GRUNTING]
Come on, help me with this mask.
Fred, I don't think this thing is a mask.
Ew! Gross.
FRED:
Keep moving.
This thing keeps getting the jump on us.
It can't jump in two directions.
Come on, split up.
Like, why did he have to pick me?
In gym class,
I'm always the last one picked.
Huh. Heh.
Oh, zoinks.
[ROARING]
SCOOBY:
I'll save you, Shaggy.
SHAGGY:
Like, thanks, buddy.
I thought that giant mutant frog was gonna make me croak.
[SHAGGY GIGGLES]
Oh, boy, I wish I could enjoy that one.
Oh, heh. Oh. You did it, boy.
Oh, what a friend.
What a pal.
What a sand trap.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
Oh, boy, Scoob.
I owe you one, buddy.
If it wasn't for you, I would...
Hey, would you look at that?
- It's one of those moonstones.
- Yeah.
Velma loves these things almost as much I love deep-fried...
Well, anything. Huh.
Groovy.
Huh? Hmph.
Velma, Velma, Velma. Pfft.
Hey, come on,
I think the coast is clear.
This doesn't make sense.
There's no such thing as a lake monster.
Tell that to the thing that just threw up an aquarium.
So now do you wanna tell me who those guys were?
Not now, Fred.
[MONSTER GROWLING]
Oh, that was worse than my date with Herbie Zimmer.
Totally, I... Wait, you went on a date with Herbie Zi...?
[MONSTER SCREAMING]
WOMAN:
Creature.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be searching.
With all the bedlam you've raised tonight...
...we'll have to stop early.
Return to the lake.
I'll summon you when it's safe to resume our search.
[DAPHNE SIGHS]
- That was close.
- Yeah.
Hey. Not bad.
[SIGHS]
Uncle Thorny.
That thing came back.
Oh, you think?
Canceled memberships and now all this damage.
I hate to say it, I may have no choice but to shut this place down...
...and go back to my life as an international playboy.
SHAGGY:
Hey, guys.
Shaggy, you're okay.
Well, yeah, I am, but has anyone seen Velma?
Before the monster attacked, she was out here, I know it.
Oh, no.
Oh, you don't think the lake monster got to her, do you?
I've seen monster movies,
I know how this works.
[ROARS THEN SCREAMS]
Shaggy, Shaggy. Calm down, okay?
- We're gonna find her.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
SHAGGY: Okay.
FRED:
Velma!
DAPHNE:
Velma!
Velma?
Where are you?
- Velma!
- Velma!
Hey, guys, I found her.
- Oh, no. She's dead.
- Oh!
Oh, she looks so peaceful.
Oh, I can't look.
[GROANS]
Uh... Guys?
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's a miracle.
FRED: What happened to you last night, Velma?
I don't know.
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk by the lake.
But then that fog rolled in and...
Well, I must have gotten lost.
I sat down to wait until it lifted...
...and I must have fallen asleep.
Don't you ever do that to us again, you hear?
You had us all worried so...
What are those?
- They kind of look like warts.
- Warts?
Egads.
Oh, no.
I'm sure it's just some kind of urushiol-induced dermatitis.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Anyway, what's going on?
You missed another attack.
Come on, we'll get you cleaned up...
...and we'll fill you in.
VELMA: Another attack?
Anybody else hungry? I know I am.
Shocking.
Mm.
Ooh.
So you think the monster's real and someone's using it...
...to dig up something on the grounds?
Yeah. Problem is, we don't have a single clue about who's using it.
Yes, we do. The mysterious figure had a streak of purple paint on its cloak.
- So?
- So remember the boat that we passed...
...on the way up here?
Shaggy called it the S.S. Daphne.
It was being painted the exact same color.
I'd be willing to bet that whoever's behind this has been on that boat.
All right, gang, we know what we have to do.
After our shifts tonight, we'll head to the docks and we'll check it out.
No.
No.
I'm not going until I do what I've been trying to do...
...since we first got here.
Um, Velma, I learned something today.
Life is like a chocolate soufflé.
And if you wait too long to dig in, it could just collapse on you.
So anyway, what I'm trying to say is...
...Velma Dinkley, will you go on a date with me?
- Heh. A date?
- Yeah.
Shaggy.
Are you serious?
I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life.
Except maybe dinosaurs, but that was a long time ago.
Shaggy, that's very sweet of you...
...but we're right in the middle of an investigation.
Well, like,
I think Fred and Daphne can handle it.
They probably wanna spend some quality time together anyway, right?
- No, not really.
- I'm good.
I don't know, Shaggy.
SHAGGY:
Oh.
Like... Like, yeah, that's...
I mean, that's fine.
I...
If I were you, I probably wouldn't wanna go on a date...
...with a goofy guy like me either so...
Hold on.
Shaggy, you know what?
I will go on a date with you tonight.
Oh, really?
- You mean it?
- Sure.
Why not?
Yes.
Pick you up around 7.
[GRUNTS]
Seven o'clock.
Slippery.
[PIANO CRASHES]
- Ouch.
SHAGGY: I'm okay.
Oh, curse this mop top.
I can't do anything with it.
Okay, Scoob, how do I look?
Ah. Handsome as a devil.
What about me?
Oh. Um...
Like, as dapper as a Dalmatian...
...but where are you headed, buddy?
- With you. Where else?
Oh, um, heh. Um...
You know, buddy...
...I'm gonna have to fly solo on this one tonight.
- Solo?
- Yeah, you know, like...
...you're just gonna have to do your own thing, you know what I mean?
My own thing? But, Shaggy...
Thanks for understanding, Scoob.
[SIGHS]
I'll see you later, pal.
Goodbye, Shaggy.
[CRYING]
[SHAGGY WHIMPERING]
Who's the best puppy in the whole wide world?
[CONTINUES WHIMPERING]
No. No more rolling over.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Good. So...
...who were they?
Who were who?
Oh, ho.
Are you still wondering about those boys
I was playing tennis with?
They were nobody, Fred.
Just some caddies I met.
Why?
You're not jealous, are you?
Jealous? No, no.
I'm not jealous. No way.
I don't get jealous.
Yeah, right.
[SNIFFING]
- Good evening, Norville.
- Heh.
[CHUCKLES]
Shaggy.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
I like corn dogs.
- Thanks, Shaggy.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh. Ahem.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Well, it looks like we got the whole place to ourselves.
Yes, unfortunately, that only emphasizes the urgency of our investigation.
- Sure we shouldn't check with Fred...?
- Oh, come on, V.
Like, just try to put those frontal lobes on the back burner tonight, okay?
Okay, Shaggy.
I must admit, I do have a hard time letting myself relax.
Especially recently.
Ever since we've been here,
I just haven't felt like myself.
Well, whoever you are, I like it.
Thanks, Shaggy.
Oh. Um...
Now, come on,
I want this night to be perfect.
[SCREAMS]
Velma.
VELMA:
My glasses.
Here, let me help you up.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I...
I don't know what came over me.
Oh, here. Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Here, let me get you some water.
Garçon, water, please.

[SCOOBY BELCHES]
[SCOOBY SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
Oh, whoops.
I seem to have dropped my fork.
Here, help me find it, waiter.
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing?
Waiting tables. Fresh ground pepper?
Scooby, get out of here, buddy.
You're gonna ruin everything.
No.
Okay, but would you do it for a Scooby snack?
I can't be bought. Hmph.
Now, you listen, Scoob...
...I'm the master and I command you to go back to your room...
...and quit being such a bad dog.
Puppy loving...
[SCOOBY MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Bad dog? Huh.
I'll show you a bad dog.
[LAUGHS THEN GROWLS]
No, Shaggy, don't.
The waiter will bring...
[SCREAMS]
Would you care to hear our specials?
Scooby-Doo? Is that you?
I didn't invite him.
He just showed up and tried to sabotage everything and...
- And...
- Is that what I think it is?
Oh, uh, heh.
Yeah, that was supposed to be a surprise.
I found it in a sand trap last night.
It's one of those moonstones, right?
Yes.
I was gonna give it to you when I walked you back to your room tonight, but...
It's beautiful.
Excuse me, I have to go now.
Wait, what? Well, Velma...
This is all your fault, Scooby-Doo.
You ruined everything.
No, I didn't.
[SCOOBY GROWLS]
DAPHNE:
There it is, the purple boat.
FRED:
She. There she is.
A boat is a she, like a girl.
But not one who goes around playing tennis...
...with every boy boat in the harbor.
That cloaked figure was definitely here.
All hands on deck.
Fred, look.
- Ladies first.
- Mm-mm.
Fine.
Looks like a bunch of old newspapers.
DAPHNE:
I'll say.
FRED:
Huh.
Hey, these are about that witch from Uggins' story, Wanda Grubwort.
DAPHNE: Evil staff?
- Yeah, remember? Didn't Elmer say...
...an ancient staff was the source of her black magic?
DAPHNE:
Hey, look at this one.
That must be what the monster's doing, looking for the source of her powers.
The problem is we still don't know who's controlling it.
Wait a second, maybe we do.
Wanda Grubwort had children. She could still have descendants living in town.
Maybe one got angry...
...when your uncle built on their land and decided to get revenge.
What was that?
It's locked. Hello!
Help. Help.
DAPHNE:
Anyone out there? Let us out.
Help. Help.
Is anyone out there? Oh, great.
If we don't get this open, we'll be stuck here all night.
[RUMBLING]
That might be the least of our worries.
- Hello!
- Is anyone out there?
Help!
- Help, help!
DAPHNE: We need to get out.
FRED: Help, anybody.
DAPHNE: Anyone!
FRED: Help, anybody!
- Help, get us out!
FRED:
Help, help, anybody!
- Help, help.
- We're stuck, it's filling.
Fred, you need to do something.
We're gonna drown.
I have an idea. Why don't we call those guys you were playing tennis with?
- I knew it, you are jealous.
- Yeah, maybe I am.
- Good, that was the point.
- You were just lying to make me jealous?
Yes, I'm trying to pay you back for playing golf with those floozies.
Flooz...? Oh, that was different.
How? How was that any different?
I don't know, they were... It just was.
All right, you know what, Fred?
If I'm gonna die,
I don't want to die dating a jerk.
Yeah, well, if I'm gonna die,
I don't want to die dating a sneaky...
...manipulative, game-playing...
You see that? I saved us.
That's lovely, but we're still broken up.
What?
Good.
[MUTTERING]
Like, what happened to you guys?
What happened?
We broke up, that's what happened.
Yeah, best decision I ever made too.
Did you just say best decision you ever made?
That's funny, because I broke up with you.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
What? You did not.
- Guys?
DAPHNE: I did so.
Guys.
That's a real bummer and all, but I kind of meant, why are you wet?
Oh, that.
Well, let's just say we almost got in over our heads.
But we figured out that Wanda Grubwort's descendant...
...might be trying to reconstruct her magical staff.
Hey, how'd it go with Velma?
Yeah. Ask my waiter.
DAPHNE:
Grubek, Grubel, Guzzak.
No Grubwort.
Huh. Would you look at that.
What a crazy coincidence.
What's that, Shags?
Oh. Remember that creepy general store we stopped at on the way in?
It was called Trowburgs.
Well, if you spell Trowburg backwards you get Grubwort.
What are the odds, huh?
Excuse me, you are on my side of the room.
[SHAGGY & SCOOBY GULP]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
There. Shaggy, Scooby, go around back.
- I'm not going with him.
- I'm not going with him.
- You think I want to go with you?
SHAGGY: Seriously...
SCOOBY: I'm not going with Shaggy.
FRED: Enough.
- Guys, let's just go.
- Go.
- Surprise.
WOMAN: Oh, no.
[WOMAN CACKLING]
Come on.
Hey, wait for me.
In here.
SCOOBY:
This way.
The other way.
[SHAGGY SCREAMING]
No.
FRED: Come on.
SHAGGY: No, please.
Please.
- Now can we split up?
- Ugh.
SHAGGY: Hey, come on, Scoob.
- I'm right behind you, Shaggy.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
Change of plans.
WOMAN:
And stay out.
Time to unmask the person behind this mystery.
- It's you?
- What?
Like, it can't be.
Velma?
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
Oh, you fools. I'm not Velma.
[DAPHNE SCREAMS]
Daphne.
I don't want to hurt you, Velma.
Oh, but I do want to hurt you, pretty boy.
Sorry, Velma.
[GRUNTING]
Velma. What's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Our date wasn't that bad, was it?
Why? To make them pay, to make them all pay.
Now, that I've rebuilt my staff, no one can stop me.
[COUGHING]
Well, there's another mystery solved, huh, gang?
I got it.
Okay.
What in the world is going on?
Why is Velma doing this?
Oh, no.
You don't think my passions drove her mad, do you?
I'm sure there's something bigger than that going on.
I'll say.
Your friend has been possessed by the spirit of the witch Wanda Grubwort.
Oh, great, my first love and she's turned into an evil witch.
Join the club.
Yeah. Hee, hee, hee.
It was that staff.
[IMITATES EXPLOSION]
She must have found the pieces...
...that have been buried all these many years.
Like, by any chance...
...did moonstones play any part in this?
As soon as your friend touched one of those rocks...
...the spirit of my evil ancestor took hold of her...
...and compelled her to find the rest.
SCOOBY: For you, old lady.
- Oh.
So it's been Velma the entire time?
Like, zoinks.
It's been right under our noses.
The evil spirit must have first taken
hold of her...
... when we found that stone
by the lake.
And those creepy warts, it was like she was actually turning into a witch.
Being burned at the stake...
... would make me pretty freaked out
at the sight of fire too.
And I bet she intentionally shorted out the security console...
... because she knew
we'd see her face.
I can't believe we missed it.
I guess we were all too wrapped up in our own little dramas...
...to catch the really big one going on.
[SIGHS]
So now that she has her powers back, what's Wanda Grubwort going to do?
I fear that what she seeks is the revenge...
...that has eluded her all these years.
Who cares about what she wants.
We gotta save Velma. Do you have any idea where she would have gone?
Oh, probably to the caves where she lived.
The caves?
But what about the irrigated rudimentary claymations?
The what?
The entrances to the caves, they're all underwater.
How would we get in?
You're in luck. I rent scuba gear.
I'll give you a good deal too.
Smile.
Zoinks.
FRED:
Lights.
Uh-oh.
VELMA [IN DISTORTED VOICE]:
Ah.
You've been a faithful servant.
And now I think you deserve some playmates.
[BELLOWS]
She's making more of those things.
VELMA:
Rise, my slithering slaves.
Rise and serve your new master.
[GROWLING]
[GASPS]
Finally, we'll make them pay.
Make them rue the day they set foot on our land.
Those things are gonna attack everyone in town.
- We have to do something.
- What can we do?
Hey, Fred, I know this is usually your department, but do you mind...?
- If you've got a plan, Shaggy, go for it.
- Okay.
Velma Dacey Dinkley, you stop that this instant.
I told you,
Velma doesn't live here anymore.
That was your big idea, Shags?
Creatures, change of plans.
Get them.
SCOOBY:
Hold still.
Thank you. Aah!
Velma.
Velma, I know you're still in there.
I know you can hear me.
Okay, like, maybe you can't.
DAPHNE:
This is like biology class...
...except this time the frogs are gonna dissect us.
Like, come on, V.
You gotta listen to me.
You're stronger than this thing inside of you.
You're stronger and you're smarter and you're cuter.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I am?
- That's right, V.
I think everything about you is cute.
Like the way...
...your pleated skirt ruffles when you run from ghosts.
How... And even...
Even how you lose your glasses at the most inopportune moments.
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, that might be the cutest thing of all.
Shaggy?
- Help me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, listen, V.
You gotta fight this old witch.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Shaggy, I'll try. I'll try.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
No, you won't.
[SHAGGY SCREAMING]
Well, at least now I can finally say
I've been picked up by a girl.
See you, froggies.
FRED:
Run, run.
That ought to hold them for a while.
Come on.
Knock me down all you want,
Wanda Grubwort...
...but I'm not gonna let a couple of stupid moonstones take my friend away.
Oh, wait, moon. Oh, that's it.
[SINGING]
By the light of the silvery moon
What is it? What are you...?
By the light
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Not the dark but the light
Of the silvery moon
Not the sun, but the moon
I want to spoon
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
No, you're mine.
- To my honey I'll croon love's tune
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Croon love's tune
- Oh, by the light of the silvery
- Light of the silvery
VELMA: Moon
WANDA: Oh!
[GROANING]
It's a dead end.
I'm sorry, Daph.
I really was a jerk.
I'm sorry too, Fred.
I never should've tried to make you jealous.
[MONSTERS ROARING]
Get out of me, Wanda Grubwort.
[WANDA SCREAMING]
Nothing can stop me now. Come.
SCOOBY:
Not so fast.
What? No.
Say goodbye, wicked witch.
No, no. Revenge was in my grasp.
And I would have gotten away with it...
...if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your rotten dog.
[GIGGLES]
Oh, no. No.
[SCREAMS]
[MONSTERS SLITHERING]
[FROGS CROAKING]
Shaggy did it. Come on.
VELMA:
Shaggy?
Is it over?
I think so, V.
Those things you said to me.
Did you really mean all of that?
Of course I did.
I've been trying to say it ever since we got here.
Just kiss her already.
Oh, well, I...
Shaggy, just kiss me already.
SHAGGY:
Well, um...
That was, uh...
Yeah.
You know,
I don't know too much about chemistry.
I do, Shaggy.
And, well, there just wasn't any.
Yeah, I...
You know, maybe we're just better off being friends.
You know what? Maybe we all are.
Yeah.
Phew.
THORNY: Well, kids, with the creature gone, we have a ton of new applications.
Maybe more than we can handle.
- And it's all thanks to you guys.
- Aw.
Oh, that reminds me.
FRED: What?
- Something to show my appreciation.
- Ten thousand dollars?
- Uncle Thorny.
- Oh.
- Aw.
By the way, I took the liberty to set up an appointment with my attorney...
...for you to discuss incorporating.
Thought that might help with your future liability issues.
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.
- Shall we go play around?
SHAGGY: This is gonna be amazing, guys.
- So insane.
- Hey, you guys, I've got it.
We can be Mystery Incorporated.
- I love it.
- I can totally dig that.
Hey, Scooby, get a picture.
[LAUGHS]
FRED:
Everybody say, "Mystery Inc."
ALL:
Mystery Inc.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Guys, group hug.
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.
VELMA: Okay, Shaggy.
DAPHNE: Shaggy.
VELMA: Shaggy.
FRED: Okay...
All right. We'll celebrate.
All right. Bye, guys.
Not the hair, man. Not the hair.
[SIGHS]
[WHIMPERING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't worry, Scoob.
No matter what happens,
I'll always be here for you.
Oh, Shaggy.
[SINGING]
When danger used to come around
I would fall right to the ground
It's true
But now that I can see your face
Well, I can stand up to anything
And how I cherish the times
When the sun shines on the two of us
But I don't mind going through
The bad times
Just as long as they're with you
Well, I can be scared with you
I can be alone with you
As long as I have your hand
To hold onto
I can be scared with you
[CHORUS HUMMING]
I can be scared with you
Oh, I can be scared
As long as I'm with you
I can do anything
I can do anything
As long as I'm with you
[DISCO MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
I can be scared with you
I can be alone with you
I can be scared with you
As long as I'm with you
My name is Shaggy
I like to eat
Main man Scooby
But he got four feet
Me and my homeys solve mysteries
Through cartoons, movies
And tons of DVDs
As old school goes, we're genuine
We've been kicking it since 1969
But Mystery Inc. is far from through
Because there's always more adventures
Starring me Scooby-Doo
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
[ENGLISH - US - SDH]
This is it.
“Pull into the driveway.
Use the remote to open the garage.
Do not exit the vehicle.
Close the garage door behind you.
Wait for further instructions."
Follow me.
Be thorough with the soap.
Eleven workers lost their lives.
Seventeen others were injured.
And soon, nearly a mile beneath the surface...
Stand.
- ...of the ocean, oil began...
...spewing into the water.
- Your records?
Because there's never been a leak...
Hold on to that.
- ...this size at this depth...
...stopping it has tested the limits of human technology.
That's why just after the rig sank,
I assembled a team...
...of our nation's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge...
Step up. Watch your head.
Step up. Watch your head.
Let me see your hand.
Finally, Peter.
Welcome.
Let's gather round. Take a seat.
First I'd like to say welcome to our new members.
As is our custom, they have been preparing on the outside for some time...
...but now we feel they are ready to graduate...
...and to join us.
So let me introduce Peter and his girlfriend, Lorna.
And this is Christine and her husband, Lam.
Now, let me say a word to you new folk.
No sudden movements.
And no questions for tonight.
The first night is always the most difficult.
But as our other members here can attest...
...an unforgettable experience.
Okay.
Maggie.
Hi.
It's nice to see new faces.
Thank you all for taking the precautions to come here.
It shows you have a great deal of faith.
Now let me return that trust...
...in telling you my story.
Like anything new...
...it will be impossible for your mind to digest.
Maybe close your eyes.
Try Opening up. Here.
Try listening from your heart.
Two years ago, I woke up underwater.
It was a bathtub, filled about three-quarters high.
I was gasping for breath.
Coughing up...
...snorting out this water.
I felt this...
...terrible sense of loss.
Like when you wake up from dreaming about someone you love so much.
And you turn around in bed and remember...
...that they've been dead for years.
What was I doing in that motel room?
I remembered my name, my birthday.
October 31st.
Nothing else.
I ended up out on the streets.
As people with no ID...
...no money...
...no memories do.
I felt really lonely.
And exhausted all the time.
My immune system was gone.
At that time, my legs and my right arm would fall asleep.
Like in meditation, you know, but for hours.
And I couldn't wake them up.
They were strangers to me.
And I couldn't remember anything.
But I still had to wake up every day, still had to keep going.
I had no idea who I was or what I was doing here.
And that's when Klaus found me.
He had heard about me from others.
Had heard of my tattoos.
And he took me in.
And he fed me.
And he gave me vitamins.
In about three or four weeks...
...I started to remember things.
Many terrible things.
Violent images.
I was so angry.
I thought I'd lost my mind.
And then Klaus explained it to me.
My tattoos. This failing body.
The things I'd remembered.
What it all meant.
Open your eyes.
I wanna show you something.
You see, the anchor is the sign of a traveler.
And the number 54 refers to where I come from.
You see, I come from 54.
Your future.
Did we get anything?
Nothing. Static.
We didn't get a single frame?
We went out of range.
Damn it.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're, like, shaking.
I'm not shaking, Peter. I'm a little racy.
It's just a bunch of crap, Lorna.
Yeah, I know.
They're weak and they're looking for meaning.
Yeah.
You know, those people are suckers.
That's it.
But what if she is?
What? From the future?
Uh, no one is from the future, Lorna.
Well, then who is she?
She's a con artist. She's dangerous.
That's why we gotta make this film.
We have to expose her before she has all those people kill themselves.
I've gotta take a leak.
Are you okay?
You don't wanna come with me'?
Peter Aitken likes math, reason, himself.
Things he can count on.
When Peter was 12, his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
A longtime member of a New Age cult...
...she believed that modern medicine shouldn't intervene in her fate.
She died on the eve of Peter's birthday, while they were both asleep.
Peter awoke 13 and motherless.
We began by preparing on the outside...
...meeting at weekly intervals...
...at the West Court shopping strip mall...
...with 20 other new recruits that were eventually weeded down.
Couldn't tell the exact location of the house.
By my count, we were in the van for approximately 20 minutes...
...but it's possible that they were giving us the runaround, so...
He)'
He)'
To see her is to believe her.
But of course, that's how these cons work.
Even if the new recruits doubt her story, they'll be back for more.
I'm trying to work. Please?
Maggie says that the future is already written...
...and that her members are the chosen ones.
Peter Aitken signing off.
Good morning, everybody.
Uh, Miss Parker had her baby, so she will be out for a couple months.
And that means you guys are stuck with me, Mr. Aitken.
So, what will it be, ladies?
We have the American Civil War or the anatomy of a cell?
Lorna?
Lorna.
- Lorna.
- What?
Lorna Michaelson.
Daughter of Hollywood producer
Isaac Michaelson...
...and Allie Bernard, the British model turned actress.
Lorna was left to an unchaperoned adolescence of movie premieres...
...and club openings.
Lorna had her first hangover at 12, her first intervention at 16.
By 23 she was burnt out, tired of playing entourage.
So Lorna cleaned up her act.
Tequila shots replaced with wheatgrass shots.
But in the end, it was one addiction traded for another.
Lorna.
Watch your head.
Shake it out. Shake it out now.
You are fools.
Your muscles are tight with repressed feelings.
Who you were before is irrelevant.
Let go of you, become the group.
I have to exhaust you people...
...to get you to stop thinking and start breathing.
Don't be worried.
Maggie's tests will get harder.
But if you pass, then you're meant to be with us.
Then you will be ready when it begins.
This is where we grow Maggie's food.
Go on, pick one.
Okay.
Are you good?
Yeah, fine. Do it.
Just think about Maggie.
She's allergic to absolutely everything in this time period.
You can eat these?
Of course you can, kiddo. Heh.
It's the grocery store you've gotta be wary of.
Produce grown by someone you've never met...
...sitting in trucks for weeks...
...sprayed with, I don't know, who knows what.
Yeah, but these aren't exactly natural either.
Well, true. But Maggie says when prices go up...
...people will start growing gardens in their garages.
We'll be all right though.
Maggie's taking us to a safe place.
Maggie? Are you dying?
Yeah.
So are you. So is PJ.
Joanne's dying. Peter's dying.
Lorna's dying.
Every life is a death.
And most deaths are suicides.
Some are more gradual than others, like cancer after years of smoking.
Or in my case...
...traveling back in time to save the people you love.
Even if you kiss him as you leave the room
And even if we don't say a word
In front of them
And even if we never get to show our friends
- Is that Abigail Pritchett?
- At least three episodes a week.
Maybe she has narcolepsy.
She's always in that hat.
Okay, I bring you some hot milk. Okay?
Can you look at me for a second there, Lorna?
Hello, Peter.
Hmm.
Okay. Well, this transmitter records everything from the camera...
...but would go out of range outside of 50 feet.
So how in the world do we bring this with us?
Peter. No way.
Well, people need to see this.
People need to see a video of Maggie.
Peter, that's too big to swallow.
Don't swallow that.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Eat this.
Give it some padding so it won't tear you up on the way out.
Are you okay?
Not sure.
Yeah. Ahem.
Close your eyes.
Go backwards to childhood.
Travel back to a time before words.
Are you there?
What does it smell like?
What does it taste like?
How do you feel?
Now live there.
Okay, come back to me.
Come back to the present.
Now you can eat your apple.
Do you know what's in that apple?
Logic.
Bitterness.
It's intellectual bullshit.
You've already eaten the apple.
That's what it means to grow up.
The question is...
...how much of it can you get rid of?
The apple is in you.
Like the fear is in you.
It's spreading throughout your body like a virus.
How can we purge ourselves of shame...
...of self-hatred...
...and rise to our callings as chosen ones?
You all have the privilege of knowing the future.
But are you gonna be ready for it?
Pathetic.
See how committed Christine is.
You're purifying yourself.
Preparing to receive your destiny.
Feels good to be rid of the apple, doesn't it?
Peter, there's no rush. We'll wait for you.
Thanks, but I can't throw up. Uh...
Never have, not even as a kid. $0...
All the more reason to let go now.
Just let it go, Peter.
Just relax.
And let it come up and out.
- Lorna.
- Sit down.
Lorna's fine.
She's just protecting you.
Do you wanna be a cripple for life, Peter?
You're letting her be your crutch.
Do you like being lame?
Ask yourself...
...why do I like being lame?
Ask yourself.
Ask yourself now. Say it.
Say, "Why do I like being lame?"
Um...
Why do I like being lame?
That's a good question.
Why do you like being lame?
I don't know.
Liar.
You do know.
We don't have anywhere to go.
Do we?
No.
We'll all just sit here breathing in the smell of everyone's puke until you can talk.
Because I don't wanna face myself.
Okay. Why?
Because I might not...
I might not like what I see.
What do you see?
Weakness.
Tell me something I don't already know.
You wanna know what I see?
An anal-retentive prick.
Who can't dance, who can't breathe.
Stop it.
Can't make his girlfriend come...
...because he's so self-involved.
Who took your power away from you?
Who made you feel so powerless you've become obsessed with control?
With thinking everything through instead of feeling anything.
Who?
Who hurt you so much you never wanna feel that way again?
Was it your father?
Was it your mother?
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking cunt.
What are you hiding from me, Peter?
She abandon you?
She leave you to start another family?
Was she a whore?
I'll hit you.
I'll hit you in the face.
What'd she do to make you so angry?
Shut up. This is so stupid.
What'd she do to you?
What'd she do to you?
She gave up.
She died.
I was a kid. And she died.
She's dead. Everybody happy?
What happened next?
You live with your dad?
Did you live in a foster home?
No.
Who took care of you?
My grandparents.
I see.
You were a good-looking kid, weren't you?
You're handsome now.
But you must have been beautiful then.
You were in a new house.
A new bedroom.
You felt abandoned.
Angry. Unloved.
Did he come to you at night?
No, of course not.
She watched him like a hawk, didn't she?
He wait for you after school?
You were all alone.
Fresh as the fallen snow.
And he knew.
Did he make you swallow his poison?
You were powerless then.
But you're not anymore.
You can let go of it, here, with us.
Peter.
It's not my choice, it's yours.
Let it go.
You're brave.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. I know that we just wanna start our day...
...but if we don't talk about it...
Talk about what?
What do you wanna talk about?
I don't know. I mean...
I guess I've never seen you cry.
Those weren't real tears.
But they weren't fake.
Yes, they were. They were fake tears.
She's a megalomaniac, Lorna.
She knew things about you.
No. She didn't know anything about me.
She asked questions about me.
She wanted to be right and I let her think she was.
So all that stuff was--?
It was not true.
Come on. Of course it wasn't true.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry If I scared you...
...but I had to do what I had to do to get us out of there.
Peter, I just feel like we're in over our heads with this whole thing, you know?
It's like we started out wanting to make a documentary on cults.
And now we're in one?
Yeah. That's investigative journalism.
She's dangerous, Peter.
You said that yourself.
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go back to our normal lives.
That's fine. We can do that.
I can teach all day.
You can stay home and write and surf the web.
And on the weekends we can get wasted at various art installations...
...or sneak forties into random foreign films.
And then it's suddenly, like, we wake up and, whoops, where did our 20s go?
But somewhere in the Valley...
...there is a woman living in a basement who claims to be from the future.
She's actually amassing followers.
These people who believe that she'll lead them to salvation or whatever.
And, yes, she's dangerous...
...but we have to see this thing through all the way or we're chumps.
Don't you wanna do something that matters?
Yes.
Let's do it.
We're a team.
We're a team?
Oh, we are totally a team.
I'm doing this with you.
Yeah.
So after my husband up and left me...
...I wore the same pair of sweatpants for two years.
It was Maggie who got me to see that humans belong in the woods...
...and not in condos.
Yeah. I'm glad that you called.
This is good.
Yeah, it feels good, don't it?
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.
After you.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go in all the way because I have to be back.
Oh, come on, you'll like this.
Come on.
I do the La Brea Tar Pits field trip.
I said, you wanna run a trip, you do the paperwork yourself, like everyone else.
Trying to steal my trip.
Give me that!
Heidi, Stop it. What in the world?
Heidi, I said stop it. Get off.
She ruined my backpack. It's new.
Get back to work. Get back to work.
The show is over.
What's happened here?
My backpack. She wrote.
You okay?
Here. I'll help you up.
Joanne?
I need to get back.
We're here.
Can't turn around now.
Here.
Why do you have a gun?
Joanne. This is weird, okay?
Hey.
I would just like to go.
Okay. Calm down.
Trust, Lorna. It is very important that we trust each other.
We're family now.
First rule.
Always treat a gun as if it's loaded, even if it's not.
Always keep it pointed down.
That's how you keep from killing somebody or yourself.
Okay, you try it-
I'd rather just watch you.
Come on.
Don't be silly. I loaded it for you.
Yeah, but I just don't feel comfortable.
Nonsense. It's important.
Okay. Legs apart-
Come on.
Okay, now remember...
...push with the right hand, pull with the left.
Okay? Keeps you steady-
Hi.
I texted you.
My phone died.
You wanna make huevos rancheros?
So, what happened with Joanne?
Oh, my God. She took me on a hike through the woods...
...to this shooting range.
But it turns out I'm actually pretty good at it.
Uh, why is Joanne teaching you how to shoot a gun?
I don't know, fun?
That's fun?
What do you think?
I don't know what to think.
That's the problem.
We don't know who these people are, what they're capable of.
What's this "safe place" that Maggie keeps talking about bringing us to?
Um, I was just wondering.
What's it gonna be like when the civil war starts?
Things come together.
And they fall apart.
It's a really dark time.
My generation is really comfortable with death.
And people die around you all the time.
But there's still beauty.
Especially when people start moving to the countryside.
There's dancing and theater.
Lovemaking.
Are there still, like, CDs or MP3s or something?
Um...
Not everybody has access to that kind of technology...
...so there's not as many recorded albums...
...but there's a lot of live music.
But every once in a while...
...a song will come along that moves everyone.
And that finds a way of getting around.
Even without MP3s.
Will you sing us something from your time?
- No.
- Come on.
- I don't sing.
- Come on, please?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just one song.
- We wanna hear the future.
- You wanna what the future--?
- Yeah.
- What the future sounds like?
Uh...
Okay.
Uh...
This song was really popular right before I left.
I'm so sorry. I can't. Sorry.
We'll close our eyes.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
Oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
For what I couldn't find
Totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me
Do you wanna try singing the last with me?
It goes:
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
In all my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
- Thanks.
- Yeah. That was good.
Maggie?
I, uh... I mean no disrespect.
But that song, you know--
I'm sure you know, is by The Cranberries.
It was from, like, the '90s.
The 1990s.
Oh, that could be.
I wouldn't know because I wasn't alive in the '90s.
In the future, it's made famous by a singer named Benetton.
Can you tell us something from the future that we could prove?
Something soon.
Huh.
When were you born?
Seventy-nine.
Okay.
Prove to me that you were alive in the '80s.
Tell me something that happened in the spring of 1959.
What?
I was born in 2030.
You're asking me to tell you something that happens in 2010.
That's twenty years before I'm born.
So I'm asking you to do the same.
Tell me something that happens in the spring of 1959.
Uh...
- Kennedy was assassinated.
- In 1963.
That's four years from 1959.
You want me to tell you something you can prove in 2014?
Would that make you happy?
What will you do with yourself until then?
I could tell you a major event a few years off.
And after that it's gonna be event after event after event.
But a mind as narrow as yours...
...would have no idea what to do with that information.
You may go now, Lam.
I was just... I didn't--
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Christine, you're gonna have to decide what you wanna do here.
Christie.
Christie, she's lying. It's obvious.
You're all crazy!
I can't get that song out of my head.
Ah, neither can I.
If you were gonna pick a song to be from the future...
...why would it be "Dreams" by The Cranberries?
Remove Peter's restraints, please.
If you'll come with me, please, Peter,
Maggie will see you.
Just Peter, Lorna.
Okay.
I'll wait here.
No need. We'll drive you home.
Enter.
You can sit down.
Ah.
I'm from the future. I'm not a saint.
Are you and Lorna happy here with us?
Yes.
Yes. Of course we are.
People leave.
Other people I kick out...
...because they're sick or lazy.
You're neither one of those, are you?
No. No, I'm not.
Do you know why
I kicked Lam out?
Because he questioned you?
No.
I'm not petty.
I don't really care if people believe me.
I don't know that I would if I was in their shoes.
Well, why'd you kick him out?
Because I knew Christine growing up.
But I never saw Lam.
I don't think he belonged with us.
Are Lorna and I there?
That's for you to decide.
We wanna be there.
Will you do me a favor?
Anything.
Yeah?
This is Abigail Pritchett.
I don't understand.
I need you to bring her to me.
Uh... Are you joking?
What would you want with an 8-year-old girl?
Don't worry about that.
Well, there's no way that I'm bringing a little girl into this basement. That's...
Then perhaps you and Lorna should stay away from this basement as well.
You don't mean that.
I need to see Abigail Pritchett.
Why?
Bring her to me and stay, or don't and go.
There has to be something else
I can do to prove my loyalty.
There isn't.
It has to cost something to be worth something.
You are asking me to kidnap an 8-year-old child.
Not kidnap.
I could get fired or arrested.
I need to know why.
How? She's important.
She's a very bright little girl.
What do you want with her?
Just to see her.
For what?
Because I need to.
Need to?
Who is she?
Abigail Pritchett is my mother.
Okay.
Time for bed.
Come on.
Come on.
That's okay. Come on.
Okay.
So?
So...
She wants me to bring her one of my students.
Wait. What?
Yeah.
Abigail Pritchett.
Did she say why?
Yeah.
Maggie claims that the girl is her mom.
Well, how did they even know that you worked at the school?
I don't know. I must have mentioned it.
I think we should go to the police.
Police?
Yeah.
Yeah. Um, hello, Officer Randal.
Yes? Hello.
I'd like to report a time-traveler...
...living in a basement somewhere.
I don't know where exactly.
They want you to bring them an 8-year-old.
That's kidnapping.
I know that and I'd be the one doing it.
So, what are they gonna arrest her for?
Soliciting blood?
Okay. So you're--?
All right, let me get this straight.
So you're actually considering bringing them the girl?
No. No.
Are you?
No, no, no.
It's a test. If we don't do this, they're gonna kick us out.
Are you listening to yourself?
You always do this.
What do I always do?
What are you talking about?
You sign up for things and then you bail when the going gets rough.
What are you talking about?
You. About finishing what we started.
You start novels you never finish.
Take pictures you never develop.
Finish what you fucking start.
You fucking started this.
I'm willing to go all the way.
How far are you gonna go?
And how are you any different from your mother?
That's a cheap shot.
Yeah?
Not if it had been delivered by Maggie.
Oh, come on.
What?
I see the way that you look at her, Peter.
Pssh. You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not.
Are you jealous of that fraud?
Why not?
She's beautiful.
Mesmerizing.
In 15 minutes she brought you to an emotional orgasm...
...that I've never seen in three years, Peter.
"Emotional orgasm"? What the fuck is that?
You tell me.
You people. You people make me laugh.
Who is "you people"?
You people...
...Who spend a fucking fortune on therapy.
You could use some.
Rehab. You think because you put in these man-hours...
...you're somehow entitled to a degree in psychology?
You're now this expert?
When the truth is, after all those hours, you fuckups are just arriving at the place...
...the rest of us have been at all our lives.
You know what I think, Peter?
I think it's you who's the fuckup.
You haven't logged tapes or captured any fucking footage in weeks.
Yeah. You don't give a shit about making this documentary.
This is about Maggie.
You're willing to do anything for her.
You just said that yourself.
So you know what?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
I'm gonna help you pack.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Get out!
I'm sorry.
We make a horrible team.
Either you stay or you go
But you can't stand there no more
My heart is burning but I
I know I started to cry
And even when I get home
I can still smell you in my clothes
And I won't pack them away
I stutter, I stutter
But just not today
Klaus, it's Peter.
Tell Maggie I'll do it.
It can't be as bad as all that.
You wanna talk about it?
No.
Thank you.
He'll come around.
You're the type of girl you try to get to marry if you can.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know about all that.
Lorna?
How do you know my name?
I think I can help you restore him to his senses.
You know her as Maggie.
Her real name is Shelly Whipple.
And who are you?
Carol Briggs, with the Justice Department.
Maggie's wanted in Sacramento for armed robbery...
...and in Fresno for arson.
That's why she never leaves the basement.
Lorna, you are in a unique position here.
You can wash your hands of all of this, which is what most people would do.
But I don't think you're like most people.
Why are you coming to me?
I mean, why not Peter?
We need a level head.
Someone to be our eyes and ears.
Look, I'll tell you what I know, okay, but it's not much.
Lorna, we believe Maggie is arming.
Unwitting or not, her subjects are being fashioned into a militia.
I'm not walking back into a snake pit.
All you have to do is help us lure the snake out.
I'm sorry. I am done.
Have they asked for a kid?
Yeah, a little girl.
That's part of their con.
Did they say what they wanted her for?
Maggie says it's her mother.
That's a good one.
Can you keep a secret from Peter?
Then I'll tell you what they really want her for.
I figured it out.
Hi. You scared me.
We do it in a public place.
Do what?
You bring Maggie the girl.
But you don't bring the girl to the basement.
You arrange a meeting in a place where we could set up cameras beforehand.
What made you change your mind?
You were right.
I think we should finish what we started.
I mean, we wanted to make a documentary...
...and what better climax than for Maggie to meet her mother?
Come on.
We'll be late.
Are you all right, Lorna?
Yeah.
I'm just hungry.
My dad used to say that the hardest thing for humans is transition.
We're survivors.
We can live in conditions beyond your wildest imagination.
You guys have been fasting for a week.
Some of you have cheated.
You're only cheating yourselves.
In the future, food is scarce...
...and real hunger will be a part of life.
I have food for you.
You don't have to eat it.
But trust me that the thought of eating it...
...is much scarier than the reality.
The ones who will not only survive but will thrive...
...are the ones who realize that there's nothing to be afraid of.
O'Shea, you want something to eat?
It's just new to you.
Food that moves.
Lorna?
I'm vegan.
Fair enough.
Pete r?
Mel.
Very soon this group is gonna begin its journey.
I won't be with you.
What? Where are you going?
It's just change.
And you guys are gonna be fine.
And...
...if you allow yourself...
...to get quiet now and again...
...to really be still...
...you will hear the sound of my voice.
Next Friday, there's a class field trip.
You know Maggie can't leave.
The microorganisms of our time are too intense for her immune system.
She's lived on the outside before.
Yes, and it nearly killed her.
Well, it's the best I can do.
Bring Maggie to the La Brea Tar Pits at 1 p.m. next Friday...
...I'll bring you Abigail Pritchett.
Mrs. Dewitt is unable to make it in today.
So Mr. Aitken will be chaperoning your trip to the La Brea Tar Pits.
I hope to hear good things from him.
Guys.
Okay, everybody chill out. Chill out, guys.
Sandra.
When you see Peter leave with Abby, text "hi."
You'll receive a "hi" back and Andy will come and chaperone the class.
Then you, you need to follow Peter at a distance.
When Maggie arrives, text a smiley face.
Be sure to keep your phone with you.
That's how we know where you are.
And they know not to harm Peter, right?
No one's gonna harm anyone.
Most likely you won't even see Maggie.
We'll be sure to take her on entry.
Peter will never know that you were involved.
Happy endings for all.
When we say "prehistoric," we mean "pre-writing"...
...a time before man could record his written experience.
And in 3500 BC, which was only about 5000 years ago...
...the written language and thus man's recorded history began.
I wanna go back inside.
Just a second.
What am I being punished for?
Nothing.
Nothing, okay? You're not in trouble.
Okay. Listen, can you keep a secret?
My friend Maggie, she is an actress...
...and she wants to hang out with kids...
...because she is going to be playing a mother, right?
So she just wants somebody that she can, you know, play pretend with.
And I picked you.
I hope you don't mind.
Is she on TV?
Where's Maggie?
Go out the side entrance with Abby.
You'll receive a call with instructions.
No.
No way. This is not what we agreed to.
Tell Maggie that it has to be here or nothing.
I'll chaperone your class.
Take off your shoes.
Lorna's watching the class.
That's not the issue.
Take off your shoes.
Don't take those off, Abby.
I wanna meet Maggie.
No, you don't.
This is not what we agreed to.
You have half an hour till your bus boards.
Maggie's gonna get what she wants, with or without you.
Come on.
Why do we take off our shoes?
Shh. We gotta keep quiet now, okay?
This is not what we agreed to.
This is not--
Yeah. Yeah, I see it. I see the...
Don't be scared.
Why would I be scared?
Don't come any closer.
Okay, I'm ready. Just the girl.
If I take off my shawl, will you take off your hat?
How do you know my secret handshake?
You taught it to me.
- Shelly Whipple, you're under arrest.
- What?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used...
...against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided.
Wait.
She's sick, you bastards!
- Come on.
- Let her go! Let her go!
What did you do, Peter?
Traitor.
You traitor.
Let's go call the attorney.
Who is she?
I don't know.
Peter.
It's not my choice.
It's yours.
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night
Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd
Open your arms
I want to be found
Maybe I'm calling your name in the night
Open our eyes
We'll feel with our sight
A Want is a lack but also desire
A need can be nothing
But should be held higher
A need is a want wearing disguise
It can be confused if fueled by desire
Baby, I'm calling your name in the night
No reason with need
Look into my eyes
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of bugs that don't bite
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want

{1519}{1560}Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?
{2051}{2081}Is it important?
{2089}{2157}If you were kind enough|to let me have this as a gift,
{2161}{2208}I'd be delighted to accept.
{2217}{2260}I don't remember that.
{2264}{2311}It may look like mouldy wood,
{2315}{2365}but centuries ago,|beneath the mould,
{2373}{2425}there must have been a painting.
{3657}{3723}- Good evening. How are you?|- Very well.
{5292}{5343}The management|and staff of Styrorex
{5347}{5409}would like to offer our best wishes,|Mr. Oldman.
{5417}{5468}Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.
{5473}{5540}This year, our chefs wish|to dedicate in your honour
{5548}{5604}an ancient recipe|of a Renaissance dessert
{5609}{5667}made of choux cream|and bitter almonds.
{5776}{5805}Enjoy.
{5935}{6016}- Most likely a rash.|- lt must be that.
{6446}{6495}Was it not to your taste,|Mr. Oldman?
{6499}{6586}Quite the contrary, but you see,|my birthday is tomorrow.
{6590}{6690}It is now 10:35pm|and I'm very superstitious.
{6698}{6733}Pretend I had accepted.
{6815}{6858}The day after tomorrow, then.
{6923}{7003}The director of the Vatican Museum|wants you to call him back.

{7080}{7117}The report on this is ready.
{7122}{7186}There's a pile of gifts.|What shall I do with them?
{7190}{7243}Send them to my house|except the mobile.
{7247}{7296}Only one this year.
{7300}{7344}Good. Word's out that I hate them.
{7348}{7430}Unless you've changed your habits,|you'll have to answer that.
{7434}{7483}It's the first call on your birthday.
{7510}{7538}Tradition.
{7625}{7650}Hello.
{7654}{7709}I have no wish|to waste your time.
{7717}{7776}- Who's speaking?|- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.
{7780}{7819}Please don't hang up on me.
{7823}{7889}You're Mr. Oldman's secretary,|aren't you?
{7893}{7955}You can speak to me.|It makes no difference.
{7963}{8036}You see, I... I don't know anybody.|I'm on my own.
{8040}{8105}I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,|this is not a helpline.
{8109}{8157}I'm not explaining myself very well.
{8161}{8222}I'm not in the habit|of speaking to people much.
{8231}{8291}That's a considerable stroke|of good fortune.
{8295}{8359}- Talking to people is perilous.|- I'm desperate...
{8364}{8421}You made the call|so you're running the risk.
{8425}{8485}It's about the furniture|of my parents' villa.
{8490}{8562}They... about a year ago.
{8566}{8616}- You see?|- I understand.
{8625}{8654}An estate of great...
{8658}{8719}I've always heard it referred to|as being of...
{8723}{8755}Extremely valuable.
{8759}{8823}Very rare pieces,|including paintings.
{8831}{8891}Unfortunately,|I have no photographs.
{8895}{8923}So what?
{8927}{9011}To be honest, I haven't decided yet,|but I would like to have a...
{9015}{9072}Oh, I'm out of my depth.|What's the word?
{9076}{9124}- Valuation.|- Exactly.
{9128}{9209}That is why I asked|to speak to Mr. Oldman.
{9217}{9287}Does Mr. Oldman have the pleasure|of knowing you?
{9291}{9356}Oh, no, not at all.|He doesn't know me.
{9360}{9404}But... but I know a lot about him.
{9433}{9511}Mr. Oldman's assistants|are responsible for assessments.
{9515}{9607}- I'll put you through.|- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
{9611}{9661}I must speak|to Mr. Oldman in person.
{9665}{9737}Mr. Oldman never presides|over early appraisals.
{9745}{9787}But you see, before he died,
{9791}{9854}Dad told me that|if I decided to sell everything,
{9858}{9929}I should entrust the auction sale|to Mr. Virgil Oldman.
{9933}{10017}- In his opinion, the best.|- Sold!
{10021}{10120}Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me|great pleasure to present lot 231,
{10128}{10248}a refracting elongated telescope|constructed by Galileo Galilei.
{10256}{10305}It's still in perfect working order.
{10313}{10370}Can we open bidding,|please, at 1,000,000?
{10459}{10544}1,300,000.|1,400,000 on the telephone.

{10965}{11016}2,300,000 on the telephone.
{11023}{11084}2,500,000. I can sell it. 2,700,000.
{11091}{11170}At 2,700,000.|Any more? Are we all done?
{11177}{11220}At 2,700,000.

{12224}{12278}20,000. At 20,000.
{12282}{12322}Any more? Sold!
{14075}{14178}- Beautiful, isn't it?|- Yes. Very.
{14185}{14251}You never miss a trick,|do you, governor?
{14335}{14382}- Who is it really?|- Yansky.
{14390}{14448}A Russian painter|who died in the late '30s.
{14455}{14502}An outstanding landscape painter.
{14534}{14620}But among his many landscapes,|he painted three portraits.
{14645}{14688}Only three in his whole life.
{14715}{14752}And this is one of the three.
{14823}{14864}It's double, alright?
{14893}{14936}How long have|we known each other?
{14943}{14969}Quite a while.
{14976}{15058}We've pulled off some sharp tricks|time after time.
{15065}{15101}Remember Milo Hensen?
{15105}{15178}You were the only one who knew|he was going to be big.
{15182}{15243}We got that portrait of his mother|for a song
{15250}{15329}from under the noses|of that bunch of idiots.
{15336}{15369}Must be worth a fortune now.
{15373}{15430}You almost sound bitter|you didn't get more.
{15437}{15498}Have we ever talked about money,|you and me?
{15503}{15563}- Honestly, no.|- It's been good enough for you.
{15567}{15620}It's been good enough for me,|you misery.
{15625}{15676}What matters is that you're satisfied.
{15683}{15757}My only regret is never being able|to persuade you
{15765}{15842}that my paintings are evidence|of a great artistic talent.
{15849}{15910}A love of art|and knowing how to hold a brush
{15917}{15950}doesn't make an artist.
{15954}{16030}You need an inner mystery.|A knack you've never possessed.
{16037}{16112}You're right. Double wasn't enough.
{19366}{19431}In my 36 years in this business,
{19435}{19521}never has anyone had the gall|to keep me waiting 40 minutes.
{19526}{19589}It's a disgrace.|A display of bad manners.
{19593}{19646}Let me explain.|I tried to call.
{19651}{19700}- There's no excuse.|- I tried to call.
{19704}{19747}Never come near me again.
{19751}{19819}Nobody answered and|I don't have your mobile number.
{19823}{19873}I do not possess a mobile phone.
{20062}{20122}lt's the lbbetson woman|on the phone.
{20129}{20193}- Tell her to go to hell.|- She's crying.
{20200}{20232}Serves her right.
{20236}{20287}She was hit by a car|on her way to meet you.
{20291}{20360}So much the worse for her.|It's no concern of mine.
{20367}{20400}She was left unconscious.
{20405}{20481}She was lying in a pool of blood|when the ambulance arrived.
{20514}{20569}Alright. Put her through.
{20723}{20780}- Yes?|- Please forgive me.
{20788}{20892}I had no intention|to be in any way disrespectful.
{20897}{20943}Nothing too serious, I hope.
{20947}{21027}No. Fortunately,|they'II... they'll let me out tomorrow.
{21032}{21106}Good.|I hope you make a speedy recovery.
{21110}{21158}Would you consent|to a new appointment?
{21185}{21256}- Please.|- Alright.
{21260}{21307}But I'm sending an assistant.
{21311}{21383}I hope it's the same one|I spoke to last time.
{21448}{21476}What do you mean?
{21480}{21555}Well, I can't explain it,|but I understood from the outset
{21559}{21643}that voice could only|have been yours, Mr. Oldman.
{21650}{21710}Truly surprising,|wouldn't you say?
{21714}{21780}We think we'll be able|to bring out the whole face,
{21785}{21858}part of her dress|and the left side of the background.
{21865}{21941}Incredible. But what made|Mr. Oldman think that?
{21948}{22011}- What period is it from?|- Too soon to say.
{22015}{22075}Perhaps Mr. Oldman|will be able to work this out
{22079}{22130}more quickly and better than us.
{22175}{22234}- It's a fake.|- How is that possible?
{22241}{22292}- It's beautiful!|- I didn't say it wasn't.
{22296}{22332}I said it wasn't authentic.
{22336}{22393}From an analysis|of the pigments and wood,
{22400}{22445}we thought it was pre-17th century.
{22449}{22510}- Even older.|- Then it must be worth something.
{22514}{22622}It is a work by Valiante,|the female forger of the 16th century.
{22629}{22660}She copied masterpieces,
{22665}{22723}but couldn't sign them|as she was a woman,
{22730}{22781}so she marked them|with a personal code
{22788}{22829}hidden in the folds of the drapery
{22836}{22891}or in this case,|in the gaze of the subject.
{22898}{22972}The beam of light on the iris|is nothing if not a V.
{22976}{23011}That is Valiante.
{23015}{23124}It is worth something,|but nothing compared to the original.
{23643}{23717}- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?|- Yes.
{23724}{23779}I'm Fred, the caretaker.|Pleased to meet you.
{23823}{23887}- Please, come in.|- Thank you.
{23908}{23932}And Miss lbbetson?
{23963}{23993}She sends her apologies,
{23997}{24058}but overnight,|she was running a temperature.
{24062}{24148}She should have called me.|Spared myself a wasted trip.
{24156}{24196}Well, give her my best wishes.
{24200}{24264}She asked if you would go ahead|with valuation.
{24268}{24319}She's instructed me|to show you around.
{24323}{24409}Everything's at your disposal.|Come with me.
{24516}{24578}Miss lbbetson was hoping|to meet your boss.
{24582}{24656}It doesn't matter.|Your mistress didn't show up either.
{24660}{24687}Fair enough.
{24691}{24746}I suppose|it'll get the job done quicker.
{24899}{24932}Forgive the mess.
{24959}{25052}It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since|Miss lbbetson's parents died.
{25102}{25132}Let's go up.
{25178}{25223}How long since the owners died?
{25227}{25293}By the look of it,|you'd think it was centuries ago,
{25297}{25335}but it's only been one year.
{25342}{25430}First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,|scarcely 45 days later,
{25434}{25464}poor Mr. Ibbetson.
{25468}{25532}You have a good look.|Take your time.
{25536}{25582}Just getting these curtains open.
{25620}{25663}Too many windows in this room.
{25801}{25826}Okay.
{25929}{25997}How many brothers and sisters|does Miss lbbetson have?
{26001}{26038}None. She is an only child.
{26045}{26086}- Is she married?|- No.
{26090}{26153}- Has she ever been?|- No, no.
{26157}{26209}I don't think|she even has a boyfriend.
{26213}{26293}- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?|- No, none at all.
{26300}{26365}As far as I know,|Miss lbbetson is on her own.
{26463}{26488}So many rooms.
{26517}{26578}You know, I've never managed|to count them all.
{26954}{27013}Have there been other valuations|before me?
{27017}{27077}Absolutely none. Yours is the first.
{27084}{27152}Miss lbbetson is extremely fond|of this house.
{27156}{27195}Maybe too fond.
{27199}{27269}She'd prefer to keep everything,|but what can you do?
{27276}{27343}The empire crumbles.|A woman on her own can't cope.
{27374}{27447}Is she thinking of putting|the house up for sale as well?
{27451}{27514}That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.
{27521}{27566}She won't get rid of the whole place.
{27573}{27615}What kind of work does she do?
{27622}{27700}I couldn't say.|I only dealt with her parents.
{27771}{27825}- May I see the cellars?|- It's this way.
{27856}{27893}It's a long way down.
{28021}{28048}Go ahead.
{29086}{29115}I honestly don't get it.
{29122}{29195}In the time I've known you,|I've never seen you beaten.
{29202}{29272}I've watched you produce|all manner of gadgets
{29276}{29322}from most unremarkable ironwork.
{29329}{29392}Optical, arithmetical devices,|water clocks...
{29399}{29501}Even that hairdryer that probably|dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.
{29508}{29585}But you've nothing to say|about this curious contraption?
{29592}{29658}I'm surprised that|an art connoisseur like yourself
{29662}{29729}can get so carried away|by a banal piece of ironwork.
{29733}{29797}It's not the object|that arouses my curiosity,
{29801}{29833}but it's contradiction.
{29840}{29911}- Contradiction?|- Look.
{29915}{29996}I found it in this position|in contact with damp flooring,
{30003}{30096}but the rust is all along the top|of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.
{30103}{30130}What does this mean?
{30137}{30195}The object hadn't been there|for very long.
{30202}{30294}It got rusted in some other place.|Or someone turned it upside down.
{30298}{30377}That's all, nothing more than|a useless exercise in deduction.
{30383}{30421}Hi. Did you manage it?
{30425}{30455}Did you ever doubt me?
{30463}{30524}This works perfectly now.
{30543}{30611}And I transcribed|the recording from the tape.
{30615}{30664}You're a genius.|How much do I owe you?
{30668}{30700}Oh, nothing.
{30708}{30749}Maybe you'll invite me out.
{30753}{30779}Count on it.
{30787}{30848}- Can I give you a kiss?|- Yes, you can!
{30856}{30884}That I am good at.
{30892}{30935}- Good evening.|- Good evening.
{30944}{31026}William-Adolphe Bouguereau.|The Birth Of Venus.
{31096}{31121}Authentic.
{31201}{31289}Umberto Veruda,|The Honest, 1890.
{31728}{31795}You've been|the talk of the town lately.
{31803}{31842}I hoped to see you|on TV.
{31846}{31914}I don't like to appear.|I prefer to remain in shadow.
{31918}{31955}We're much the same that way.
{31959}{32000}That doesn't mean we'll agree.
{32004}{32053}My secretary's been looking for you.
{32058}{32129}How do you know that a painter|will become collectable?
{32133}{32219}Intuition, which also makes|me doubt your intentions.
{32223}{32320}Sorry for that impression but I've|entrusted you with my belongings.
{32324}{32355}That's not how it works.
{32359}{32429}There must be a signed contract|before the inventory.
{32434}{32498}It takes time,|and unless you stop fooling around
{32502}{32566}and decide to come out|it will never get started.
{32571}{32620}Go ahead with the inventory.
{32624}{32659}I'll meet you at the villa.
{32663}{32701}We'll reach an agreement.
{32705}{32739}You have my word.
{32747}{32797}- Take these.|- Yes.
{32801}{32826}Be careful!
{32830}{32881}I'm not sure|but it looks German to me.
{32885}{32944}Austrian. Careful with that.
{32949}{33001}It's 11:00|The appointment was 8:30.
{33005}{33092}She's not answering.|She said she'll come. She'll be here.
{33100}{33153}The piano doesn't need restoration.
{33157}{33181}Quite so.
{33186}{33234}We have to check it|but there's no key.
{33238}{33268}But here it is.
{33272}{33317}Last time there was no key.
{33321}{33346}Looks good.
{33354}{33398}Mr Oldman!
{33402}{33448}Would you help me|with the bookcase?
{33456}{33523}Italian bookcase, wood. First half|of...
{33527}{33551}Who smashed this?
{33556}{33611}Nobody, Mr Oldman,|it was already broken.
{33615}{33662}Is this part of the house inhabited?
{33666}{33694}Why?
{33699}{33744}There have been some changes.
{33752}{33781}No, no, Mr...
{33785}{33834}I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.
{33838}{33869}I thought you were...
{33877}{33912}It doesn't matter who I am.
{33920}{33952}Nobody lives here.
{33960}{34041}Be that as it may, if your mistress|is not here by midday
{34045}{34112}I will have no option but to|suspend operations.
{34235}{34261}Mr Oldman!
{34376}{34403}Miss lbbetson.
{34411}{34455}Hello, Mr Oldman?
{34459}{34518}Mr Oldman, can you hear me?
{34522}{34608}Mr Oldman, I apologise.|What must you think of me?
{34612}{34679}Spare me|the self-serving justifications.
{34683}{34707}Let me speak.
{34711}{34792}I cannot touch your things|without a contract. Is that clear?
{34796}{34864}Would you leave it on the table|in the hallway?
{34868}{34927}I'll sign it.|I accept all your conditions.
{34932}{34972}Yes, but I do not accept yours.
{34976}{35058}I will not do business|with a silly, superficial phantom.
{35095}{35131}Be careful!
{35135}{35188}I understand your exasperation.
{35192}{35258}But please believe me|I didn't mean anything by it.
{35262}{35363}It's been a series of unfortunate,|unintentional mishaps.
{35371}{35423}So what exactly happened today?
{35427}{35524}My car was stolen and I had to go|to the police to report it.
{35542}{35601}Which police station did you go to?
{35605}{35653}The one in the city.|- Whereabouts?
{35661}{35723}- On the main square.|- Which square?
{35730}{35783}No more interrogation!
{35787}{35842}No more!|Who do you think you are?
{35965}{36005}Are you here, Miss lbbetson?
{36009}{36062}What kind of question is that?
{36067}{36095}Are you here?
{36099}{36155}I don't understand.|I don't understand.
{36159}{36211}- lf you're here, come out now.|- Stop it!
{36215}{36294}Explain the meaning of this game|which I do not find amusing.
{36298}{36346}Call me tonight. I'll explain.
{36427}{36472}lt's the same material
{36476}{36519}and the same workmanship too.
{36527}{36572}These belong to the same system.
{36580}{36641}There's no signature,|no inscription?
{36649}{36782}I mean when I've got the rust and|the oxidisation off the other piece.
{36816}{36840}There's nothing.
{36848}{36966}I can do the same with these but, I|mean, right now I can't see anything.
{37056}{37101}What have you found?
{37109}{37186}The technique, how the cog|has been attached to it's axis.
{37190}{37251}It's really old.|I've never seen it before.
{37255}{37306}Here, look. Have a look.
{37490}{37545}It's 18th century.
{37553}{37600}We could be onto|something big here.
{37604}{37649}Could you guess what it is?
{37684}{37756}Three pieces of the mosaic|is not enough, Mr Oldman.
{37801}{37863}In the last few years|the old couple were unwell.
{37867}{37922}The house was in|a terrible state then.
{37952}{38036}Mr lbbetson always said|that they'd have to sell something.
{38044}{38090}And Miss Claire. How old is she?
{38134}{38173}About 27.
{38206}{38263}What else can you tell me|about her?
{38267}{38299}Nothing really.
{38307}{38384}I've never had much to do with her.|I don't really know her.
{38392}{38491}And yet you've been in the service|of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.
{38545}{38609}Well, 11 years to be exact.
{38618}{38664}I don't have much to do with her.
{38672}{38726}I talk to her often|at all hours but...
{38734}{38767}But?
{38775}{38824}I've never seen her.
{38833}{38916}- How could that be?|- It's the truth. Not once.
{38924}{38961}Why?
{39009}{39122}Because Miss Claire|suffers from a very strange illness.
{39150}{39218}- Hello.|- Good evening. It's Oldman.
{39223}{39257}I was expecting your call.
{39261}{39346}I have no wish to quarrel|and I'm sorry if I was rude today.
{39350}{39376}It doesn't matter.
{39380}{39449}But if I confirm I am available,|at the same time
{39453}{39535}I cannot permit this joke in poor taste|to continue any longer.
{39543}{39605}I wish you to stop|all involvement in my affairs.
{39609}{39650}I apologise for the trouble.
{39654}{39701}Send me your bill.|Good night.
{39892}{39949}Lot 93. Valiante.|Portrait of a Lady.

{41037}{41103}£90,000. Any more?
{41128}{41158}Sold.
{41190}{41251}- Thank you, sir.|- I bid £90,000 too.
{41259}{41330}Mr Oldman should have been|aware of that.
{41338}{41422}I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.|Mr Whistler bid £90,000.
{41430}{41508}- He was the only one.|- They bid simultaneously.
{41512}{41570}She got her bid in first.|I saw it.
{41578}{41610}What should we do?
{41614}{41719}I'm the biggest collector of Valiante|forgeries and I'll sue you!
{41727}{41812}You were too slow, Billy! You didn't|get in with your bid in time.
{41820}{41860}And you were too late. Too late.
{41864}{41919}You didn't keep up with me|for God's sake!
{41927}{41994}She was behind me.|If I'd seen I'd have bid again.
{42002}{42047}You're losing it!
{42051}{42077}Maybe you're right
{42082}{42144}but it's not the first time|we've messed up.
{42152}{42235}It's the way things go. Never went|into a rage like this before.
{42278}{42321}That wasn't a Valiante forgery.
{42329}{42387}It was the genuine one|by Petrus Christus.
{42407}{42466}It'll be worth £8 million.
{42517}{42557}Woe be me.
{42598}{42642}I'm sorry. Honestly.
{42680}{42753}But even when we lost|Van Gogh's Lady With The Fan
{42757}{42801}you didn't take it this hard.
{42821}{42861}What's going on, Virgil?
{43413}{43466}- What will you have?|- 1,581.
{43470}{43494}Tea, thank you.
{43680}{43753}Sorry, darling, 8,625.
{43881}{43930}Take a closer look,|you moron.
{43938}{44011}Shit! You're right, 8,725.|Well done, girl!
{44015}{44050}That's it?
{44334}{44370}- Bye!|- Bye!
{44445}{44513}I gave them a clean|with this special fluid.
{44522}{44586}And I have studied them|by the millimetre
{44590}{44644}and look what's come up.
{44669}{44694}Vaucanson.
{44731}{44795}I can't believe it!|Jacques Vaucanson.
{44799}{44850}18th century constructor|of automata.
{44859}{44924}When I was a student|I did my thesis on him.
{44932}{44975}That's incredible!
{44980}{45055}One of his most famous androids|even managed to talk.
{45059}{45136}Exactly.|People would pay to ask it questions.
{45140}{45256}The android would move its head,|bow, and give its reply.
{45265}{45310}I bet there was someone inside.
{45314}{45349}You know, a dwarf maybe.
{45353}{45441}Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected|with Maelzel's Chess Player.
{45445}{45497}More than likely.
{45501}{45556}But the mystery|that nobody could explain
{45560}{45627}was how Vaucanson's|automaton always got it right.
{45636}{45715}Of course there was trickery|in making the automaton talk.
{45751}{45791}Everything it said was true.
{45830}{45871}You bring me all the pieces.
{45875}{45973}I promise to put them back together|exactly how Vaucanson had them.
{45977}{46006}I don't doubt it
{46010}{46085}but I fear I've lost my chance|to get the missing pieces.
{46093}{46155}They must be in the same place|you found these.
{46163}{46216}And all I need is 80%|of the elements,
{46221}{46289}and I can work out the rest|and rebuild it myself.
{46293}{46339}It's not that easy.
{46376}{46425}I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.
{46455}{46519}Hey, Sarah, this is Mr Virgil Oldman.
{46621}{46659}Pleased to meet you, Sarah.
{46663}{46735}It's a pleasure. Robert has told me|so much about you.
{46740}{46811}Don't young people talk about|more exciting things?
{46819}{46858}Why don't you eat with us?
{46863}{46919}That's very kind.|Another time, thank you.
{46928}{46986}Alright, we won't insist.|We'll promise.
{46995}{47035}- Bye.|- Goodbye.
{47187}{47268}Cancel New York and tell|the Alphasons to meet us here.
{47276}{47316}We called the meeting.
{47325}{47393}So we've changed our minds.|Is that a problem?
{47401}{47430}Alright, Mr Oldman.
{47550}{47591}Claire lbbetson phoned.
{47620}{47650}What does she want now?
{47658}{47704}She asked you to meet her|at 2:30.
{47712}{47754}Meet her where?
{47762}{47808}At the lbbetson villa.
{47812}{47846}Where else?
{49185}{49292}I'm extremely grateful to you|for coming, Mr Oldman.
{49330}{49380}How did you know it was me?
{49384}{49437}Fred has a limp. You don't.
{49441}{49478}Ah.
{49515}{49584}To be honest I didn't expect|you'd want to speak to me.
{49616}{49703}I know you can't stand my excuses.|If I were you, I wouldn't either.
{49707}{49737}In fact, your beh...
{49742}{49769}How should I put it?
{49773}{49812}Speak frankly. Don't worry.
{49860}{49914}I won't deny that your whimsical|little ways
{49918}{49953}are getting a bit tiresome.
{50003}{50039}I hope not too tiresome.
{50071}{50171}But I wanted to say sorry|for... well, my behaviour.
{50196}{50279}Typical of a "silly, superficial|woman", as you put it.
{50283}{50349}Why do you systematically|avoid meeting me?
{50353}{50403}Nothing personal, believe me.
{50407}{50467}Why would you want to do|business with a person
{50475}{50522}who arouses such aversion in you
{50526}{50588}that you can't even look him|in the face?
{50599}{50669}It's hard to explain. You won't|believe me anyway.
{50677}{50781}If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be|here playing hide and seek.
{50785}{50820}I don't meet many people.
{50850}{50901}It's been a long time now.
{50905}{50977}I see nothing serious in that.
{50981}{51009}Everyone has moments
{51013}{51078}when they prefer solitude|to the multitudes.
{51082}{51149}I haven't left this house|since I was 15.
{51169}{51245}- I don't think I understand.|- You understand perfectly.
{51253}{51286}This is my room.
{51290}{51353}If there's somebody in the house|or in the villa,
{51357}{51405}I lock myself up in here.
{51409}{51497}I've always done that,|even when my parents were here.
{51502}{51540}I hardly ever saw them.
{51544}{51573}I don't see anybody.
{51596}{51622}But why?
{51626}{51702}Why do you go around with|your hands covered by gloves?
{51706}{51777}lt's a question of hygiene.|I don't see the connection.
{51781}{51826}You're afraid to touch others.
{51830}{51884}To touch their possessions|disgusts you.
{51892}{51961}I'm afraid of going to places|where others live.
{51965}{52031}These seem to me|very similar personal choices.
{52059}{52147}You'd like me to believe you haven't|walked a street in 12 years?
{52155}{52184}I see you know my age.
{52192}{52285}Being a hermit and employing|a caretaker doesn't add up.
{52293}{52371}I walk about quite a bit,|if that's what you want to know,
{52376}{52450}inside the villa|when there's nobody here,
{52454}{52524}which is often now,|but I never go out.
{52552}{52604}The very idea paralyses me.
{52667}{52716}I hope you understand me now.
{52724}{52802}I hope that, within the limits|of your work, you'll help me.
{52834}{52881}You have my word, Miss lbbetson.
{52885}{52966}As to any agreement between us,|I leave it to you to set your fee.
{52970}{53000}I trust you blindly.
{53082}{53127}Leave the contract on the table.
{53135}{53178}You'll find it signed next time.
{53182}{53220}Now, please, I'm very tired.
{53524}{53579}Apart from your fondness|for my gloves,
{53587}{53635}what made you decide|to call me again?
{53640}{53671}I haven't been kind.
{53698}{53779}I was taken by the way you|were looking at my house yesterday
{53783}{53817}from the bar opposite.
{53908}{53955}You found the missing pieces.
{53959}{54045}In the meantime|make do with this one.
{54049}{54099}How much would the|automaton be worth
{54103}{54157}if we manage to make it work?
{54161}{54207}Think of a really, really high figure.
{54259}{54317}- Do you have one in mind?|- Yes.
{54322}{54375}You've probably pitched it|too low.
{54383}{54448}You're good at talking|without saying anything.
{54456}{54507}I'll take that as a compliment.
{54521}{54577}Should things go|the way I trust they will,
{54581}{54630}you'll be very handsomely rewarded.
{54638}{54732}I didn't mean to talk about money.|It's a real privilege for me.
{54736}{54773}Where did you find these?
{54781}{54858}There are very precise rules|in the world of antiques.
{54862}{54916}It's forbidden to reveal|one's sources.
{55123}{55192}There's a few more gears|but bigger in that corner.
{55196}{55280}Gather them together. I'll take|care of the cataloguing myself.
{55284}{55309}Of course.
{55336}{55365}Candlesticks.
{55369}{55434}- Which period?|- 17th-century. Repair.
{55480}{55506}Mr Oldman.
{55645}{55675}Mr Oldman.
{55703}{55731}Yes.
{55735}{55806}What have you decided|about the furniture in this wing?
{55810}{55860}We're only drawing up|the inventory.
{55864}{55914}Later you can tell me|what to leave out.
{55918}{55944}Thank you.
{55995}{56092}Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help|thinking about your situation.
{56096}{56153}I'm sorry to have|intruded on your thoughts.
{56157}{56195}That's not the point.
{56199}{56261}I've been wondering how you|can live like this.
{56266}{56315}I'm organised and self-sufficient,
{56319}{56387}I don't need any help|but I appreciate your concern.
{56391}{56422}You're welcome.
{56489}{56549}- See you soon, then.|- Have a good day.
{56605}{56633}Mr Oldman!
{56682}{56715}Your contract.
{57094}{57137}I read it and it seems fine to me.
{57147}{57206}I initialled every page|and signed the last.
{57210}{57254}That's how it's done, isn't it?
{57258}{57284}Perfect.
{57288}{57343}But your personal details|are missing.
{57432}{57468}Take them from my passport.
{57720}{57767}But it expired quite some time ago.
{57772}{57857}- Personal details never expire.|- That's true enough, I suppose.
{57861}{57929}I was just a girl then|but it'll do for your purposes.
{58286}{58354}I wanted to mention|that in certain critical cases
{58358}{58423}my advice is to proceed|directly to restoration.
{58427}{58456}You know best.
{58460}{58526}It means the whole thing|will take a little longer.
{58530}{58585}We can widen|the scope of the valuation.
{58593}{58620}I understand.
{58980}{59029}You dye your hair.|I never noticed.
{59038}{59125}I'm disgusted by people|who don't trust their own hair!
{59129}{59196}I don't trust people who think so|much of themselves
{59200}{59244}that they won't come outside.
{59278}{59372}Ah, sir, there'll be no more|caretaker service as from Monday.
{59376}{59446}I'll just come in to bring|Miss lbbetson her shopping.
{59450}{59524}- The matter is of no interest to me.|- These are the keys.
{59551}{59648}- Why give them to me?|- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.
{59653}{59721}In case you needed access|for further inspection.
{59789}{59838}When you come in, slam the door,
{59846}{59904}otherwise she'll get scared|and panic.
{60200}{60241}I'm going off my head
{60245}{60310}trying to work out the alignment|of these devices,
{60314}{60379}trying to figure out|which one fitted into which.
{60383}{60439}- That can't be easy.|- But not impossible.
{60475}{60533}You know,|gearboxes are like people.
{60555}{60608}If they've been together|long enough,
{60612}{60671}eventually,|they take on each other's forms.
{60693}{60796}So, you believe time can make|any kind of cohabitation possible?
{60800}{60838}Yeah, well, absolutely.
{60846}{60923}You've reminded me of a friend|who met a much younger girl.
{60927}{60964}She had agoraphobia.
{60972}{61023}Fear of open spaces|and distances?
{61032}{61126}Exactly. She lived for years locked|up in an apartment on her own.
{61155}{61257}Recently, she gave him the keys|to her house and ever since,
{61261}{61312}he's been in a state of...
{61350}{61383}...permanent anxiety.
{61449}{61533}What did I tell you? Now|he'll be constantly worried about her.
{61541}{61566}He'll be thinking,
{61570}{61662}"What does she need, shampoo,|medicine, tights... yoghurt?"
{61671}{61707}lt's beautiful, isn't it?
{61728}{61764}I'm not so sure.
{61772}{61814}Tell your friend to stay calm,
{61818}{61886}'cause time is already|working on their gearboxes.
{62101}{62152}And there you are, Mr. Oldman.
{62258}{62324}- Are you angry with me?|- Why should I be?
{62328}{62389}- What I said about your hair.|- Not at all.
{62415}{62446}I was just calling to ask
{62450}{62549}if you wish the sale of the furniture|to be identified by your family name.
{62553}{62598}Or do you prefer anonymity?
{62602}{62662}- Anonymity, anonymity.|- Good.
{62689}{62733}This time, I did see you.
{62737}{62773}- Oh?|- On TV.
{62777}{62848}I don't generally give interviews|but I was forced to.
{62852}{62896}You're more intriguing this way.
{62900}{62963}You'll be a great success|with the ladies.
{62971}{63020}So, we go to Lot 132.
{63024}{63084}Gustave Rett,|Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.
{63092}{63213}1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.
{63217}{63274}This one goes to the best offer.
{63554}{63637}Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?|She hasn't answered in days.
{63641}{63694}It's a while|since I heard from her.
{63698}{63742}I've been in bed all week, ill.
{63750}{63793}Who's been bringing her food?
{63985}{64016}Miss lbbetson?
{64176}{64212}Miss lbbetson?
{64460}{64509}Miss lbbetson? Answer me!
{64594}{64647}Claire?
{64687}{64720}Claire, are you alright?
{64756}{64799}Oh, no. Please!
{64803}{64849}- No. It's me, Claire.|- Get out!
{64853}{64898}- It's me, Mr. Oldman.|- Go away!
{64902}{64956}- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.|- Get out!
{64960}{65021}There's nobody else here.|Calm down.
{65025}{65073}What's wrong?|Tell me what happened.
{65103}{65139}I wasn't well.
{65143}{65191}I didn't know who to call.
{65195}{65223}Nobody answered.
{65227}{65282}And then I fell.
{65287}{65357}I fell and I hit my...
{65365}{65406}Open the door.
{65414}{65450}You need to see a doctor.
{65458}{65522}No, please! Please!
{65530}{65585}Please, no!
{65659}{65711}Can you fix a broken auctioneer|as well?
{65719}{65762}I wouldn't know where to begin.
{65770}{65825}It's good to see you again,|Mr. Oldman.
{65829}{65915}Is something wrong? You seem|more preoccupied than usual.
{65920}{65966}Too many woodworms|and spider webs
{65970}{66024}and too few masterpieces.
{66028}{66064}Could we put it that way?
{66095}{66156}- So, how's our toy coming along?|- Ah.
{66161}{66234}Well, I've managed to put|some sections back together.
{66279}{66367}But, I mean, there's just still|too many pieces missing.
{66394}{66436}The entire exterior.
{66444}{66512}We can't establish|what kind of character he is.
{66520}{66579}Like my friend|and his girl in the tower.
{66587}{66656}Yeah, maybe, although|we've never seen our android.
{66660}{66711}We're still groping around|in the dark.
{66719}{66752}So is he.
{66762}{66815}He speaks to her|through a closed door.
{66823}{66873}- Closed door?|- Yes.
{66877}{66974}If anybody moves in the house,|she barricades herself in her room.
{66982}{67081}- He's never seen her face?|- Not only him, no-one has.
{67085}{67157}That's like when two young people|meet on the internet.
{67165}{67239}They get to know each other,|then reveal themselves.
{67243}{67284}She won't reveal herself.
{67292}{67356}Maybe he hasn't|got a good strategy.
{67391}{67476}So, it's more difficult for my friend|to succeed in his enterprise
{67480}{67550}than for us to reconstruct|the Vaucanson automaton?
{67555}{67646}Depends on the number of rusty|pieces you're able to bring me.
{67654}{67687}Well...
{67715}{67752}...here's one more.
{67800}{67835}That's a mobile phone.
{67866}{67891}This is brand new.
{67895}{67973}I'm the one that's rusty|because I don't know how to use it.
{67981}{68051}Could you teach me|before your girlfriend gets here?
{68506}{68565}- Hello.|- Good evening, Mr. Oldman.
{68570}{68626}It's Claire Ibbetson.|Am I disturbing you?
{68630}{68677}No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.
{68681}{68764}I told you, from now on,|you can call me any time you like.
{68768}{68805}I wanted to thank you for...
{68831}{68869}...everything, really.
{68873}{68954}No need. All that's important|is you're feeling better now.
{68958}{69030}Yes, it was just a small cut|on the head. I'm much better.
{69034}{69100}I wanted to tell you,|I looked over the inventory.
{69108}{69162}Oh! What do you think?
{69192}{69247}You've done a great job.|Really, you have.
{69276}{69327}But I'm troubled|by so many doubts.
{69331}{69419}I'm not sure if it's a good idea|to sell. What would you advise?
{69424}{69490}I couldn't say. I don't know|what your plans are.
{69498}{69559}Why did you decide|to sell in the first place?
{69564}{69656}Out of necessity in order to start|life afresh or another reason?
{69664}{69710}All of the above, I suppose.
{69714}{69787}I'd even sell the house.|It's too big for me now.
{69791}{69878}Sometimes, I feel as though|I were in a public square.
{69882}{69931}I'd like something smaller.
{69935}{69980}But the idea of having to leave here
{69984}{70039}and go somewhere else|fills me with dread.
{70043}{70081}How would I manage it?
{70085}{70164}Wear blindfolds? Have myself|carried out while asleep?
{70168}{70247}I'd get into a state and end up|putting everything off.
{70321}{70391}You have all the time in the world|to make up your mind.
{70398}{70468}- You think?|- Well, until the catalogue is printed.
{70476}{70570}Don't torment yourself.|Think of yourself, your future.
{70575}{70624}That's the biggest torment of all.
{70632}{70683}When I think about it,|I can't even work.
{70688}{70745}I didn't know you were working.
{70749}{70852}I write. I write novels, stories,|things like that.
{70860}{70911}I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.
{70919}{70976}Luckily for us,|you'll never manage to.
{70984}{71017}Why not?
{71021}{71110}Because I write under a pseudonym|and I loathe what I write.
{71118}{71190}Artists always loathe|what they make, Miss lbbetson.
{71194}{71240}Yesterday, you called me Claire.
{71289}{71359}I wasn't aware.|I was in a state of alarm.
{71363}{71420}- Sorry.|- I'd like you to continue.
{71454}{71550}"I'd like you to continue."|She said it to him, just like that.
{71554}{71590}Well, what did he say?
{71594}{71666}He was taken back but he went|along with what she wanted.
{71674}{71708}What else could he do?
{71716}{71790}I'd have asked her to do the same,|call me by my first name.
{71794}{71829}That's not his style.
{71833}{71904}Besides, I don't think my friend|intends to court her.
{71908}{71965}Then he'll never get her out of there.
{71969}{72045}I don't|think my friend intends to court her.
{72049}{72118}I don't think my friend|intends to court her.
{72122}{72151}Horrible voice!
{72159}{72236}I'd have thought he'd at least|have desired to see her face.
{72240}{72308}'Desired's probably|not the right word.
{72312}{72405}Curious to see her, perhaps.|Yes, I could understand that.
{72409}{72482}But the chances of it happening|seem to be really remote.
{72486}{72518}There might be a way.
{72526}{72581}Just depends on how brave|your friend is.
{72612}{72672}- The French bureau.|- Yes.
{72676}{72768}- The table with the roll top.|- No, I'd like to keep that.
{72776}{72841}That's it.|Next time, we'll do the paintings.
{72849}{72895}- OK.|- One last thing, Claire.
{72899}{72991}You'll have to decide whether we do|the photography here or in a studio.
{72999}{73069}In a studio. I don't want|many people around the house.
{73078}{73141}That's the best solution.|Well, I'm off now.
{73145}{73214}- Anything you need?|- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
{73246}{73291}When will we next see each other?
{73323}{73433}You mean, when do you see me?|Since I am not given that privilege.
{73464}{73515}- Forgive me.|- But soon.
{73541}{73592}- Have a good day.|- You too.
{75892}{75918}Hello?
{76522}{76596}- I can't believe it.|- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.
{76600}{76674}I had to do something to make|you forgive me.
{76678}{76719}But how did you get it?
{76727}{76801}I heard that Mrs. Durane|had fallen on hard times,
{76805}{76917}so I persuaded her to sell it to me|for £250,000.
{76921}{76973}Hmm, not exactly cheap!
{76977}{77025}I thought it was a reasonable price.
{77033}{77080}You were talking about £8 million.
{77085}{77138}This way,|everyone gets a good deal.
{77173}{77215}How much do you want, Billy?
{77220}{77282}I don't want a penny more|than I gave the old girl.
{77286}{77335}Now you're really losing your grip.
{77343}{77394}I just want to get back|to where we were.
{77402}{77468}How was your friend,|your accomplice,
{77475}{77524}your trusted procurer of women?
{77562}{77652}lf you're doing this to win back my|trust, it's been a bad deal for you.
{77692}{77740}You never lost it in the first place.
{77748}{77794}Oh!
{77830}{77903}This is great.|This is great!
{77911}{77953}You found important stuff.
{77957}{78001}Best bit is this.
{78056}{78124}- An ear.|- A step forward, wouldn't you say?
{78132}{78191}I'd say!|I'd say we're at a turning point.
{78195}{78224}Look.
{78370}{78411}- Huh?|- Excellent.
{78419}{78478}The pieces are attracting each other.
{78482}{78507}So...
{78539}{78616}How did things go with your... friend?
{78672}{78767}How many seconds did it take you|to realise I was talking about myself?
{78771}{78815}Quite a few, to be honest.
{78819}{78881}Let me confess,|I didn't follow your advice.
{78907}{79003}There was something too contorted|about it, too imprudent.
{79007}{79045}Yeah, OK, I see your point.
{79547}{79644}The mathematical set|of a six-day week.
{79674}{79793}The mathematical set|of a 51-minute hour.
{79826}{79892}- What will you have, sir?|- Tea, please.
{79900}{79947}Have you thought of anything else?
{79951}{80013}The length of a point.|The direction of a circle.
{80017}{80071}Your tea's ready, sir.
{80075}{80164}The edge of a circumference.|The centre of space.
{80215}{80318}- The area of a segment.|- Amazing. Well done!
{80345}{80407}The vertical position of a sphere.
{80453}{80518}I brought the furniture|and painting valuations.
{80522}{80603}Look at them carefully because|you'll have to authorise them.
{80608}{80701}- I don't know a thing about this.|- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.
{80706}{80773}You've been spending time|in the cellars recently.
{80777}{80864}- Is that why you changed the locks?|- I change them every six months.
{80935}{81001}And I take care to double-check,|compare and correct
{81009}{81076}when dealing with|odds and ends in cellars.
{81080}{81138}It's how I work.|If it upsets you, speak now.
{81147}{81234}You'll find the new keys on the table.|Please take them.
{81340}{81390}Thank you for your trust.
{81394}{81446}Were you offended|at being locked out?
{81450}{81478}No, but I was worried.
{81510}{81584}You're right, I should have told you.|I'm sorry.
{81634}{81720}Claire, you're ruining your life|for reasons which are beyond me.
{81728}{81813}This illness of yours is so absurd,|it almost seems unreal.
{81853}{81915}My mother thought|I was faking it the first time.
{81919}{81952}We were abroad.
{81956}{82027}I was so afraid of walking|at the foot of the Eiffel Tower
{82031}{82065}that it paralysed me.
{82069}{82139}I started screaming,|fell to the ground.
{82143}{82219}I was just a little girl, but it kept|happening more and more
{82224}{82260}and she had to believe me.
{82264}{82307}Has there ever been an open space
{82311}{82367}where you weren't overcome|by anxiety?
{82371}{82484}Only one. During a school trip|to Prague. I was 14.
{82489}{82543}The square|with the astronomical clock.
{82547}{82642}I must have walked across it|a hundred times. It was beautiful.
{82650}{82724}I remember a restaurant|with very strange decor.
{82753}{82835}If there's one place in the world|I'm nostalgic for, it's that.
{82840}{82874}I was really happy there.
{82908}{82965}It was called Night and Day.
{83000}{83071}- You've never been back?|- Never.
{83105}{83195}Why not go now?|I'd be happy to take you.
{83317}{83412}Well, you don't seem too pleased.|We're almost there.
{83441}{83517}Our automaton is about|to emerge from the shadows.
{83521}{83579}No, I'm delighted.|You're a force of nature.
{83633}{83663}It's just that...
{83691}{83734}...this is one of those evenings
{83738}{83798}when one feels like this contraption|here...
{83942}{83970}...incomplete.
{83999}{84071}Why did you never marry?|You know, never have kids?
{84078}{84113}The regard I have for women
{84118}{84189}is equal to the fear|I've always had of them...
{84193}{84252}...and to my failure|to understand them.
{84279}{84332}If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson
{84336}{84418}gives every impression|of being the exception.
{84422}{84450}I'm afraid so.
{84454}{84518}Have you really never|set eyes on her?
{84522}{84550}Just once.
{84575}{84608}What's she like?
{84612}{84699}I suppose feeling a certain interest|in a person
{84703}{84788}necessarily engenders|a conviction that she's beautiful.
{84792}{84832}Up to a point.
{84874}{84961}It's her birthday in two days.|I'd like to get her something useful.
{84996}{85066}I don't think useful|is probably your best approach.
{85074}{85109}- No?|- Not the first time.
{85113}{85184}It's better to get her something|more... traditional.
{85305}{85334}Morning, sir.
{85391}{85435}Hello, sir.
{85443}{85511}Hey, Mr. Oldman.|Look what I found in the cellar.
{85541}{85596}I saw you were interested|in this old junk.
{85628}{85679}The supports for|the Murano chandelier.
{85687}{85734}My colleagues couldn't find them.
{85738}{85814}- I can put them in your car.|- That's very kind.
{85856}{85885}Wait.
{85927}{85955}Oh, thanks.
{86009}{86038}Morning, Mr. Oldman.
{86075}{86157}I took the liberty of remembering|it's your birthday.
{86168}{86202}Happy birthday, Claire.
{86266}{86338}I read|the valuation documents.
{86342}{86395}Did you manage to understand|some of it?
{86399}{86448}Of course.|Ridiculous sums of money.
{86452}{86523}Even a backwards child|would know she's being cheated.
{86527}{86595}They need interpretation.|They're starting bids.
{86599}{86672}- There'll be higher bids later.|- Suppose there aren't!
{86676}{86742}Unlikely, but in that case,|we'll even things out.
{86746}{86801}We'll raise the margins|on other pieces.
{86805}{86867}A gamble? Where I'm the only one|that can lose?
{86872}{86945}You're trying to cheat me.|It's all to your advantage.
{86949}{86988}You're a fucking thief!
{87015}{87081}I'm willing to resign|the commission forthwith.
{87110}{87134}Huh!
{87178}{87267}I'll have them replace all your|mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.
{87271}{87334}And do me the favour|of disappearing completely
{87338}{87373}from the face of the earth!
{88434}{88471}1984, sir.
{88876}{88947}- Hello.|- I behaved so badly.
{89044}{89146}I feel so stupid. I constantly have|to offer justifications.
{89205}{89265}I've never been given flowers|before.
{89269}{89386}I don't know what this says to me.
{89429}{89516}There's no need for this display|of anguish. I'm not angry with you.
{89611}{89670}My birthdays have always been|so horrible.
{89714}{89755}And you...
{89759}{89793}Since you came along...
{89822}{89890}...you've turned my life upside down.
{89955}{90020}The other day, I went downstairs.
{90050}{90145}I opened the main door|and looked out onto the garden.
{90185}{90244}- Did you go out?|- No.
{90288}{90331}I was afraid.
{90335}{90372}I felt terrible.
{90415}{90466}But I never even got that far before.
{90562}{90599}Do you want me to come over?
{90642}{90683}I already know it's pointless.
{90687}{90760}There are new treatments|nowadays. They might help you.
{90765}{90819}I'd rather talk to you|than to some shrink.
{90854}{90923}- Should I take that as a compliment?|- Yes.
{91011}{91072}I see you brought up|the portrait of the dancer.
{91076}{91141}- It's something I want to keep.|- No great value.
{91145}{91216}It's a portrait of my mother.
{91220}{91272}She was about my age|when she had it done.
{91371}{91404}Do you look like her?
{91408}{91492}- She was prettier, I can assure you.|- I cannot judge.
{91719}{91754}Alright, Claire. I'll go.
{91759}{91835}Don't hesitate to call|if you need anything at all.
{91839}{91888}Thank you, Mr. Oldman.|See you soon, I hope.
{93030}{93100}Hello? Oh, it's you, director.
{93109}{93168}No, I would've called you,|it's just that...
{93172}{93240}...clearing the furniture|has been complicated.
{93275}{93331}Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.
{93352}{93442}What's he like?|Not as old as you might think.
{93451}{93540}He dresses in an odd way,|but he's still a good-looking man.
{93549}{93596}I know I can trust him.
{93600}{93679}Why? Are you jealous?
{93694}{93762}In love? No, I don't think so.
{93767}{93832}He's too put off by my illness,|like everybody.
{93884}{93941}Oh no, it's nothing.|I... I hurt my foot.
{93949}{93989}Can we talk later?
{94599}{94629}Who is it?
{94650}{94686}Who's there?
{94710}{94770}No, get out!|No, please, get out!
{94781}{94835}Go away! Get out!
{94844}{94915}Get out! Please, leave me alone!
{94960}{94997}Get out!
{95060}{95097}Get out!
{95458}{95552}- Hello?|- Please, help me, please.
{95558}{95620}Calm down, Claire.|What's happened?
{95626}{95690}You have to help me!|Help me!
{95696}{95766}- I'll be there as soon as I can.|- Please.
{97089}{97126}Claire!
{97131}{97225}- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?|- There's somebody in the house!
{97230}{97302}- Please get them out!|- Calm down. There's nobody here.
{97306}{97363}- There's someone in the house!|- Calm down.
{97371}{97443}It was me before, Claire.|It was me.
{97481}{97518}It was me.
{97583}{97644}I hid in the room so I could see you.
{97704}{97739}You were spying on me?
{97766}{97815}You were spying on me?
{97829}{97864}Get out!
{97868}{97942}I want nothing more to do with you!|Get out!
{98185}{98244}Please, Virgil. Don't go.
{98667}{98741}Believe me,|I don't normally behave like this...
{98779}{98816}Neither do I.
{98840}{98914}So I'm bound to make some|mistakes...
{98973}{99057}...but nothing in the world|would make me want to hurt you.
{99085}{99163}It's just that I can't help myself.
{99216}{99260}I need to see you.
{100131}{100174}You should've seen her.
{100207}{100273}Pale, like a Durer etching.
{100286}{100366}She had the look of some creature|terrified of the universe.
{100374}{100439}And I could read my own terror|in her eyes.
{100447}{100555}Every man on earth would like to be|as terrified as you at this moment.
{100749}{100815}- You've worked a miracle.|- It's too soon to tell.
{100824}{100911}And you be careful, alright?|This is when mistakes occur.
{100919}{100966}When you think you've made it,
{100975}{101017}that is when you lose strategy.
{101025}{101119}- And what strategy would that be?|- Never stop surprising them.
{101124}{101234}Do things they couldn't have|foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.
{101242}{101309}You're asking me to behave|in a way that isn't me.
{101317}{101366}That's why you have to do it.
{101386}{101451}As long as you're playing|according to her rules,
{101455}{101531}you're always gonna make her|feel like... like a patient.
{101535}{101593}She needs to be treated|like a woman.
{102325}{102374}What do you think? Do you like it?
{102466}{102503}I don't know.
{102533}{102570}What do you think?
{102594}{102641}lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.
{102659}{102698}Perhaps the smaller size?
{102719}{102781}Yes. I think so too.
{103108}{103175}It's been a long time|since I got a present like this.
{103214}{103295}- Long overdue, don't you think?|- I don't know.
{103304}{103370}I'm a little,|you know, taken a back.
{103537}{103586}- I'm sorry, I can't...|- What?
{103632}{103660}Oh, certainly.
{103681}{103751}I'm sorry.|I didn't understand.
{103955}{104028}I don't honestly know|if I deserve all this.
{104108}{104166}Let me be the judge of that.
{104607}{104670}If we don't set a date|for the Stockholm auction,
{104674}{104710}they'll shoot themselves.
{104714}{104773}It's too far.|Let them shoot themselves.
{104839}{104914}We have to schedule the meeting|with the Hermitage
{104922}{104988}and the auctions in|San Francisco and Madrid.
{104992}{105026}Ditto. Too far away.
{105033}{105118}- We can't abandon them.|- There are auctioneers galore.
{105122}{105191}They'll find someone else|and it will cost them less.
{105195}{105226}As you wish.
{105354}{105404}Lambert, are you married?
{105426}{105485}Yes. Nearly 30 years.
{105493}{105553}What's it like, living with a woman?
{105562}{105607}Like taking part in an auction.
{105623}{105698}You never know if yours|will be the best offer.
{106336}{106374}- This one.|- Very well, sir.
{106415}{106485}What do you think?|Have I made myself pretty?
{106528}{106587}- Beautiful. You've done very well.|- Liar.
{106591}{106647}- Claire.|- I haven't done this for years.
{106656}{106727}I've forgotten how to do it.|I look like a monster.
{106731}{106800}Trust me. Some practice|and you'll be wonderful.
{106804}{106863}And you'll take me to|one of your auctions,
{106867}{106912}and to galas with elegant people,
{106920}{107003}and to the most refined restaurants|in the world.
{107011}{107106}That's the reason for your|presents, isn't it, Virgil?
{107129}{107206}To help me recover little by little,|and then take me out.
{107214}{107257}Isn't that right?
{107314}{107349}No!
{107353}{107406}Claire. Don't be like this.|Let's talk.
{107508}{107609}Maybe we did get the last moves|wrong. I was a bit rash.
{107618}{107653}Don't blame yourself.
{107658}{107738}It's always her who manages|to pull everything apart.
{107746}{107798}Robert. My aunt's gone missing|again.
{107802}{107843}- You're kidding.|- Pardon me.
{107851}{107925}- We found her in Central Park.|- I'm sorry, Terry.
{107929}{107999}It was no good|trying to reset this thing.
{108003}{108082}It was much more easy|just to make a new one.
{108086}{108146}This one has a much wider range.
{108155}{108210}She can go off|and you won't lose touch.
{108218}{108278}Just make sure|you reprogram the PC, okay?
{108283}{108334}I can manage that.|You're an angel.
{108356}{108399}- Thanks, darling.|- No worries.
{108419}{108487}- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?|- Yeah.
{108539}{108662}You need an idea that'll excite her|but at the same time reassure her.
{108667}{108776}Yes, but she'll still see through it|as some deceitful therapy.
{108784}{108864}- You should invite her to dinner.|- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!
{108872}{108932}At the climax of the evening,|by candlelight,
{108940}{108995}tell her that she's beautiful.
{109003}{109053}And after|you'll have coffee with us?
{109061}{109098}Why not?
{109144}{109248}Joking apart, I'd be glad|if you did see her, hear her talk.
{109257}{109324}I'm sure you'd understand|far more than I.
{109367}{109415}Who said anything about joking?
{109556}{109597}Your champagne.
{109612}{109660}- Thank you.|- Calculate this.
{109883}{109919}Unbelievable!
{110051}{110089}You're radiant, Claire.
{110138}{110171}You did all this?
{110175}{110240}I can turn my hand|to interior decorating.
{110453}{110536}You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.|Thank you.
{110679}{110764}I can't tell you how long I've wanted|to spend time alone with you.
{110772}{110855}Somewhere quiet,|far from the madding crowd.
{110984}{111033}To your serenity, Claire.
{111095}{111136}To your irony, Virgil.
{111280}{111336}- Now I feel I can finally tell you.|- What?
{111344}{111404}You are more beautiful than the|dancer.
{111469}{111505}Dinner is served.
{111514}{111573}- Please be seated.|- Thank you.
{111581}{111638}I warn you, as a waiter|I'm not the best.
{111646}{111702}I offer no guarantees.
{111719}{111793}- I'll take the risk.|- Somewhat foolhardy of you.
{111808}{111881}- Why?|- lf the service is not to your liking,
{111885}{111936}next time I'd have to|make a reservation
{111940}{111979}at the best restaurant in town.
{112043}{112093}Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.
{112097}{112179}- Please, let's not talk about me.|- Alright.
{112187}{112251}Instead I'd like you to tell me|about your past.
{112260}{112336}You see, there's nothing|very original about my life.
{112344}{112418}A child loses his parents,|a horrible orphanage...
{112427}{112508}The only point of interest is|that the nuns would punish the boy
{112512}{112593}by making him work with a restorer|who had a workshop there.
{112601}{112643}That's beautiful.
{112647}{112699}He loved to observe|this craftsman,
{112707}{112794}so the little boy got up to|all sorts of mischief
{112799}{112868}to ensure he'd be punished|as often as possible.
{112872}{112915}So he became acquainted with art,
{112924}{113014}techniques of painting,|how to tell a forgery from an original
{113018}{113060}etc., etc.
{113064}{113183}In an old article of yours|I found on the internet, you said,
{113191}{113269}"There's something authentic|in every forgery."
{113277}{113310}What did you mean?
{113314}{113364}When simulating another's work
{113373}{113466}the forger can't resist the temptation|to put in something of himself.
{113470}{113544}Often it's just a trifle,|a detail of no interest.
{113553}{113590}One unsuspected stroke,
{113594}{113672}by which the forger inevitably|ends up betraying himself,
{113680}{113758}and revealing his own,|utterly authentic sensibilities.
{113781}{113834}I really love the way you talk.
{113842}{113899}You couldn't have been|more convincing.
{113903}{113945}Huh? A born seducer.
{113953}{114050}- So you'd give me a pass?|- A+. With distinction!
{114058}{114120}Sorry, you've been|a bit neglected lately.
{114163}{114225}You haven't said|anything about Claire.
{114244}{114331}If I didn't know about her problems,|I'd say she was normal.
{114340}{114420}And she's much more beautiful|than you described.
{114428}{114486}Really. I liked her.
{114490}{114537}You're going to make me jealous?
{114541}{114618}lf you want my advice,|you pray that girl never gets better.
{114626}{114687}Do you want lots 87 and 88|done separately?
{114691}{114748}No, together. That's important.
{114902}{114947}How can I help you?
{114988}{115045}- It's about Robert.|- What's going on?
{115093}{115126}Don't be afraid to tell me.
{115177}{115244}We're not getting on so well,|that's the problem.
{115252}{115308}All those girls hovering around him...
{115338}{115375}I guess I'm just...
{115389}{115428}...l'm afraid of losing him.
{115453}{115498}Is there anything I can do?
{115530}{115566}Do you want me to talk to him?
{115617}{115715}For a while now he's been|talking about someone called Claire.
{115774}{115810}Claire?
{115833}{115878}I don't understand
{115882}{115987}With him everybody's got to|be on their guard, all the time.
{115995}{116037}That goes for you, too.
{116106}{116151}I feel so stupid.
{116229}{116286}Promise me you won't say a word|to him.
{116312}{116351}I promise.
{116473}{116534}Have you been|waiting long?
{116539}{116604}lf you'd phoned,|I wouldn't have kept you waiting.
{116608}{116672}- I prefer to see you.|- Is something wrong?
{116680}{116725}My assistant will come by today.
{116729}{116801}Kindly hand over the|Vaucanson as it is.
{116805}{116854}Alright. Whatever you want.
{116862}{116921}Tell him how much you're owed.|He'll pay you.
{116969}{117018}Aren't I at least due an explanation?
{117022}{117092}You're not the trustworthy man|I thought you were.
{117140}{117220}lt's weird seeing them so|perfect and polished up.
{117228}{117263}It's as if they weren't mine.
{117530}{117578}I believe nothing is missing.
{117606}{117645}There is something missing.
{118134}{118233}How could you have lived|the best years of your life in here?
{118251}{118325}I don't know. I don't know.
{118342}{118379}It was just the right thing.
{118463}{118499}"Was."
{118542}{118578}lt still is.
{118586}{118623}It always will be.
{118641}{118678}Always.
{118845}{118933}You have to get out of here.|You have to do it by yourself.
{118957}{119002}I don't have the courage.
{119054}{119131}It's a spider's web that|I don't know how to break free of.
{119237}{119294}It's an old collection|my father was fond of.
{119303}{119353}I never did understand what it was.
{119524}{119588}Hello?|Good morning, director.
{119614}{119659}Yes, I'm nearly finished.
{119677}{119736}But I would like to rewrite|the last chapter.
{119752}{119801}A more upbeat ending.
{119851}{119896}If that's all you want...
{119916}{119985}Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.
{120041}{120121}I wouldn't rule out them|being part of something valuable,
{120125}{120174}but exactly what I couldn't say.
{120182}{120241}- I often wonder if...|- What?
{120248}{120318}lf you're more interested|in my furniture than in me.
{120359}{120409}How could you say that?
{120453}{120522}I shouldn't have let you in here.|I shouldn't have.
{121082}{121141}I've found all the missing pieces.
{121148}{121202}How do you feel about|finishing the job?
{121223}{121269}Well, it's your problem.
{121321}{121369}Sarah came to see me|a few days ago.
{121373}{121427}She was upset|about your relationship.
{121509}{121614}- Are you here to advise me now?|- No, you're the expert on women.
{121646}{121709}Alright.|We can pick up where we left off.
{121717}{121745}On two conditions.
{121753}{121840}You just stop involving me|in your private life.
{121870}{121896}And the second?
{122035}{122070}Is that you take this back.
{122199}{122285}I didn't get excited about|your Vaucanson for the money.
{122367}{122413}I brought it back. It's in the car.
{122421}{122464}And the new pieces too?
{122472}{122569}You'll have to be patient for those.|They're tied up with my private life.
{122578}{122645}I don't know|and I don't want to know.
{122678}{122776}If you were forced to choose|between Claire and the automaton,
{122784}{122829}which would you take?
{123005}{123085}- This one.|- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.
{123093}{123125}If it's the wrong size,
{123129}{123203}please inform the lady to pass by|whenever she wishes.
{123208}{123248}Thank you, I'll let her know.
{123256}{123297}Claire? lt's me.
{123662}{123775}Claire! I've brought lunch.
{124004}{124041}Claire!
{124080}{124194}Claire, answer me!
{124235}{124272}Claire!
{124313}{124349}Claire!
{124393}{124430}Claire!
{124564}{124601}Are you down here?
{124732}{124797}Claire!
{125647}{125695}Have any of you seen a woman
{125699}{125768}going out the gate|of the villa across the road?
{125772}{125807}No, I can't say I have.
{125815}{125887}Has anybody seen someone|coming out of the villa?
{125895}{125961}A young woman.|Medium height, light hair.
{125969}{126028}- A bit pale.|- I think I saw her.
{126036}{126066}I didn't see her go out,
{126071}{126123}but she was walking away|from the gate.
{126131}{126186}- When?|- This morning at breakfast.
{126194}{126269}- What else can you tell me?|- She seemed a bit weird.
{126277}{126380}- Weird? Which way did she go?|- That way. Towards the park.
{126438}{126515}Idiot!
{126567}{126619}- Hello? Virgil?|- She's gone.
{126623}{126686}- Who? What's going on?|- Claire's disappeared.
{126690}{126758}I've looked.|They saw her leave this morning.
{126766}{126821}- Do you want me to come over?|- Please.
{126890}{126927}Has this happened before?
{126931}{126982}She never even appeared|at the windows.
{126986}{127023}Just behind the shutters.
{127031}{127084}Did she have friends|she could go to?
{127093}{127195}She'd talk to people on her|computer under different names.
{127203}{127288}- She can't have gone far.|- Let's hope so.
{127296}{127344}I've already been round three times.
{127407}{127450}- Hello?|- Mr. Oldman.
{127454}{127520}- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?|- No.
{127524}{127588}- lf she calls, let me know.|- I will.
{127593}{127683}Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like|to think you'd forgotten.
{127687}{127731}Forgotten what?
{127908}{127989}- There he is. Here we go.|- Lot number one.
{127997}{128094}Late Baroque, Venetian,|mid-18th-century mirror.
{128098}{128148}Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
{128156}{128227}with adornments,|floral motifs and festoons.
{128280}{128317}Upper frame richly...
{128513}{128579}Inlaid wood with gold leaf,|with adornments,
{128583}{128624}floral motifs and festoons.
{128628}{128685}Upper frame richly|engraved with whirls.
{128689}{128724}Can we say 130,000 euros?
{128750}{128788}140,000 euros.
{128796}{128851}150,000 euros.|Gentleman on my left.
{128855}{128904}160,000 euros. Lady up the back.
{128913}{129011}170,000 euros.|180,000 euros on the telephone.
{129019}{129104}200,000 euros.|Gentleman on my left in the room.
{129108}{129161}220,000 euros.
{129165}{129239}250,000 euros on the tele...
{129247}{129320}Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.|I'll keep looking.
{129324}{129386}- Robert's looking further afield.|- Alright.
{129390}{129457}- I'll call you later.|- Alright
{129513}{129578}- He's gone crazy.|- 280,000.
{129586}{129636}310,000. Any more?
{129657}{129712}Sold!
{129720}{129812}I'm doing the rounds|of the hospitals, but there's nothing.
{129816}{129844}Just keep looking.
{129849}{129911}- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.|- Thanks.
{129936}{129973}Lot number 2.
{129978}{130047}A 17th-century|Fassadenschranke wardrobe
{130051}{130094}in walnut, maple, oak and ash.
{130099}{130162}The carved frame|surmounts an inlaid stripe,
{130170}{130248}and two doors engraved|with architectural motifs,
{130256}{130304}surrounded by carvings of fruit.
{130312}{130386}Three spiralled,|tapered columns flank the doors.
{130394}{130466}The lower body has two drawers.
{130538}{130567}And um...
{130675}{130749}There's nothing for it|but to call the police.
{130753}{130822}It'll be all over the papers.|They'll drag me into it.
{130826}{130861}Let's wait a bit longer.
{130868}{130906}What do you hope will happen?
{130914}{130993}That she'll come back... or turn up.
{131025}{131089}Or they'll find out where she is.
{131093}{131182}Someone with her problems|doesn't just disappear into thin air.
{131186}{131235}Well, that depends.
{131243}{131288}No matter how deeply rooted it is,
{131292}{131358}sometimes a phobia|can just disappear by itself.
{131366}{131406}So, why did she run away?
{131410}{131461}Maybe something happened|between you
{131469}{131530}that drove her|to take that kind of decision.
{131534}{131612}You know perfectly well|that's impossible.
{131617}{131684}You're the only person|who knows everything
{131688}{131729}that happened between us.
{131813}{131866}Excuse me a minute.
{132330}{132401}- Hello?|- I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.
{132405}{132462}I've called|all the publishers in existence
{132467}{132515}but none of them knows|who she is.
{132519}{132573}They said that often|even they don't know
{132577}{132652}the identity of authors|who use pseudonyms.
{132660}{132712}I'd never have guessed that you
{132716}{132774}would have ended up|in a mess like this.
{132778}{132868}- I don't know how I can help you.|- All you had to do was listen.
{132876}{132928}Ah.
{132932}{133038}Considering the lady's illness,|it seems highly unrealistic
{133046}{133090}that she's just run away.
{133120}{133225}I'd say, I don't know,|she'd been abducted or something.
{133234}{133303}That's not likely.|I don't think she had any enemies.
{133311}{133391}It could be somebody became|so besotted with her
{133395}{133433}and carried her off by force.
{133441}{133522}- But who?|- I've had my doubts about Robert.
{133530}{133555}The young guy?
{133563}{133634}The way you describe him,|he doesn't seem the type.
{133642}{133718}From the literary point of view,|he fits the bill.
{133745}{133793}The young knight|rescuing the damsel
{133797}{133879}from the clutches of the old man|incapable of love.
{133887}{133953}Literature, exactly.
{133961}{134008}Don't go overboard, Virgil.
{134016}{134095}She could have had her own reasons|for disappearing.
{134103}{134162}I can't imagine what reasons.
{134170}{134246}Recently, she's been experiencing|emotions and feelings
{134251}{134305}that are incompatible with flight.
{134313}{134360}I wouldn't be so sure,|if I were you.
{134369}{134428}Human emotions|are like works of art.
{134436}{134477}They can be forged.
{134481}{134574}They seem just like the original,|but they're a forgery.
{134634}{134728}- Forgery?|- Everything can be faked, Virgil.
{134737}{134807}Joy, pain, hate.
{134844}{134902}Illness, recovery.
{134939}{134988}Even love.
{135413}{135455}- Hello?|- Listen.
{135459}{135519}There's something|that hadn't occurred to us.
{135523}{135620}Are you sure there are|no other secret rooms in the villa?
{135624}{135674}I don't remember|any other doors
{135678}{135731}like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.
{135764}{135818}Claire!
{135822}{135934}The only place we haven't looked at|is the attic... if you want?
{136076}{136143}Did you know|that Miss Claire was a writer?
{136147}{136209}I heard her parents|talk about it.
{136213}{136285}She used a pseudonym|for her books.
{136289}{136382}I never knew that.|I've never seen the books.
{136390}{136432}She never wanted them here.
{136440}{136473}Claire!
{136504}{136582}We're wasting time.|There are no other secret rooms.
{136586}{136623}You've come back.
{136628}{136671}- We should...|- Quiet!
{136679}{136711}You've...
{136739}{136772}You've come back.
{136776}{136821}You've...
{136870}{136913}You've come back.
{136921}{136954}You've...
{136958}{136997}Claire?
{137125}{137213}Claire, I can feel you're there.|Answer me.
{137271}{137307}You've come back.
{137375}{137448}- You've come back.|- Of course I have.
{137480}{137519}Were you afraid I wouldn't?
{137804}{137874}I thought|you'd abandoned me.
{137879}{137962}- Like last time.|- Last time?
{137970}{138037}When we got back from Prague.
{138113}{138144}Claire.
{138666}{138716}I will never abandon you.
{138800}{138884}I'd been happy in Prague|in that very odd restaurant.
{138948}{139017}I was there with my first|and only boyfriend.
{139069}{139108}He was older than me.
{139224}{139288}When we got back|from that excursion,
{139292}{139362}one afternoon,|we were walking in the city centre.
{139429}{139479}A car crashed into us.
{139507}{139596}When I came to,|he wasn't there anymore.
{140108}{140212}I went back home|and I never went out again.
{140888}{140939}I've never slept|with a woman.
{140947}{141018}In fact, I didn't close my eyes.
{141026}{141110}I spent the whole night|just looking at her.
{141118}{141219}- It was wonderful.|- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.
{141227}{141293}You've succeeded|in making her fall in love.
{141334}{141379}I had a good teacher.
{141438}{141490}I understood where the dwarf hid.
{141498}{141566}Look, there must have been|a sunken pedestal here.
{141574}{141613}He would crouch in there
{141617}{141674}and his voice would reverberate|in the body.
{141678}{141721}It must have made an impression.
{141729}{141779}Do you think love can be faked?
{141893}{141960}In keeping with what you say|about art forgeries,
{141968}{142023}I'd say it can't be completely faked.
{142031}{142080}If one could say love is a work of art.
{142088}{142147}It'd be amazing if it were,|wouldn't it?
{142151}{142196}lt could be sold off at an auction.
{142204}{142291}The highest bidder could relive|the greatest love stories.
{142295}{142355}I hope I haven't destroyed|your love story.
{142363}{142408}No problem. No problem.
{142416}{142474}A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...
{142478}{142536}It'll be good as new.|Just like the first day.
{142544}{142600}What do you think|you're going to do now?
{142647}{142702}I want to coax her out.
{142710}{142802}Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard|if I were you.
{142810}{142860}She's too fragile.
{142868}{142972}You'll see. When you least expect it,|things will fall into place naturally.
{143333}{143426}No!
{144576}{144675}Hello? Hello?
{144679}{144747}Virgil? Virgil, is that you?
{145518}{145581}Virgil! Virgil!
{145728}{145773}Virgil?
{146265}{146307}Help! Help!
{146339}{146399}- Hold it up!|- It is up!
{147096}{147162}Why don't you love it?
{147166}{147257}I've never felt it to be a real home.|More like a hotel.
{147265}{147315}You come home a night,|sleep if you can.
{147319}{147376}Next morning,|you're off somewhere else.
{147408}{147457}Let's go back inside.
{147490}{147580}Seems to have been planned|to welcome a lot of people.
{147584}{147664}Yes, but the plan was never realised.
{147668}{147732}Except for the inaugural reception.
{147740}{147787}I was so distrustful of other people
{147791}{147903}that I kept them away from|the perimeter of my personal hotel.
{147957}{148002}I was a fool.
{148037}{148074}Even now, I still get upset
{148078}{148156}when I see the housekeeper|and the maids walking about.
{148161}{148210}After dinner, I send them home.
{148247}{148307}I wasn't wrong when I said|we were very similar.
{148311}{148353}Yes, you were right.
{148393}{148442}And thanks to you, I understood.
{148876}{148938}- Where are you taking me?|- You'll soon find out.
{148991}{149084}Close your eyes.|I'll tell you when you can open them.
{149289}{149354}Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.
{149358}{149436}I never liked games|where you had to close your eyes.
{149610}{149694}- Mind the step.|- Gently, please.
{149795}{149824}We're almost there.
{149863}{149897}Stop now.
{149951}{149992}Open your eyes.
{150178}{150219}I don't believe it.
{150302}{150338}It's overwhelming.
{150353}{150408}I've been collecting them|all my life.
{150456}{150530}So, I'm not the first.|You have had other women
{150538}{150594}Yes.
{150598}{150659}I've loved them all|and they loved me back.
{150668}{150718}They taught me to wait for you.
{150762}{150805}And now that you're here,
{150809}{150862}we'd like you to come|and live with us
{150866}{150924}and make this beautiful hotel|your home.
{150961}{150998}Oh, Virgil.
{151061}{151121}If anything should ever happen to us,
{151125}{151174}I want you to know that I do love you.
{151227}{151266}I love you too.
{151270}{151357}The catalogue for the sale|of the paintings and furniture
{151361}{151397}of Ibbetson Villa is ready.
{151401}{151483}Congratulations. It's a lovely volume.|About time!
{151523}{151595}I wonder who'll buy|this wonderful stuff... Oh, sorry.
{151599}{151678}I can't conceal my anxiety to know|what you think about it.
{151936}{151973}Well, don't you like it?
{152038}{152070}No, it's just that...
{152118}{152184}...ever since I decided|to come and live with you...
{152222}{152310}...I've been thinking I... don't want|to sell anymore.
{152367}{152423}I'd like to leave everything|the way it was.
{152586}{152612}I understand.
{152637}{152661}Are you sure?
{152682}{152742}Believe me, if I were you,|I'd do the same thing.
{152794}{152874}Tomorrow, everything|will be back in its place.
{152946}{152974}Alright, Virgil!
{153086}{153185}To the most tortured and most|fortunate catalogue of my career.
{153189}{153229}That's saying something.
{153233}{153282}- Here, here.|- Cheers.
{153319}{153377}And since you've become|my family...
{153422}{153486}...I too have an important|announcement to make.
{153506}{153558}Next week,|I have an auction in London.
{153566}{153647}It will be the finest of my career|and the very last.
{153783}{153850}They say he's been seen|recently in female company.
{153854}{153896}- Who? Virgil?|- Yes.
{153900}{153998}It's finally come home to him that the|worst sexual perversion is chastity.
{154027}{154089}How is it going|onstage for the last time?
{154093}{154185}I've never felt better. There's|a whiff of anticipation in the air.
{154189}{154244}All my colleagues|have come to see me off.
{154248}{154281}That's nice of them.
{154285}{154376}This affection is because they won't|have to put up with me anymore.
{154432}{154509}Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.|I just wish you were here.
{154513}{154548}Me too.
{154552}{154634}But I'm not ready to travel yet.|I got dizzy in the car yesterday.
{154638}{154722}Don't let it get to you. We have|all the time in the world to travel.
{154726}{154778}- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.|- I'm coming.
{154799}{154851}Have you heard|from our young friends?
{154855}{154921}Constantly.|I'm never left on my own.
{154926}{154974}Good. Give them my love.
{155002}{155066}- I can hear you've got to go.|- Yes.
{155091}{155175}- But I can't wait to get back home.|- Good luck, my darling.
{155332}{155366}Any more?
{155499}{155536}Any advance?
{155607}{155666}£12,500,000 on the telephone.
{155702}{155750}Any more?
{155754}{155816}All done at £12,500,000.
{155824}{155908}Sold for £12,500,000.
{155940}{156020}Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
{156314}{156393}- Good to see you.|- Thank you. Not a bad price.
{156401}{156452}Can I say hello to you in public?
{156456}{156504}Oh, Billy.
{156512}{156610}You were fantastic, my friend! I'm|happy for you. I'm going to miss you.
{156618}{156671}You say it like|we'll never meet again.
{156681}{156716}Of course we will.
{156720}{156804}But I'm feeling nostalgic|thinking about all our exploits.
{156822}{156867}- You'll get over it.|- Virgil?
{156894}{156960}To remind you of|what a great artist I could've been
{156968}{157060}if only you'd believed in me,|I've sent you one of my paintings.
{157065}{157107}I promise I won't burn it.
{157352}{157389}Claire.
{157426}{157462}Claire, I'm back!
{157510}{157547}Hello?
{157623}{157691}- Have you seen Miss Claire?|- No, sir.
{157701}{157737}Claire?
{157776}{157809}Where are you?
{157851}{157879}Claire?
{157908}{157974}Mr. Oldman,|she must have gone out.
{157982}{158017}It was the same yesterday.
{158021}{158100}Sarah and Robert came to get her,|then came back for lunch.
{158104}{158134}Alright.
{160121}{160167}"There is always
{160171}{160243}something authentic|concealed in every forgery."
{160247}{160328}I couldn't agree more.|That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
{160333}{160385}"There is always something|authentic
{160389}{160432}concealed in every forgery."
{160436}{160480}I couldn't agree more.
{160484}{160547}That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
{160551}{160603}"There is always something|authentic
{160607}{160649}concealed in every forgery."
{160653}{160698}I couldn't agree more.
{160702}{160764}That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
{160768}{160819}"There is always something|authentic
{160823}{160863}concealed in every forgery."
{160871}{160966}I couldn't agree more.|That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
{160970}{161022}"There is always something|authentic
{161026}{161067}concealed in every forgery."
{161071}{161119}I couldn't agree more.
{161123}{161172}That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
{161176}{161258}"There is always something|authentic concealed in every..."
{161651}{161746}Good morning, Mr. Oldman.|We have visitors today.
{161750}{161824}Isn't this nice?|Look who's come to see you!
{162004}{162056}How are you, Mr. Oldman?
{162166}{162207}I've brought your mail,
{162216}{162294}some newspapers|and a few magazines.
{164362}{164454}A few days ago, they brought|some furniture to the villa opposite.
{164539}{164567}Did you notice?
{164586}{164654}I think so,|but I don't see much from in here.
{164671}{164695}Ask her.
{164887}{164921}Claire?
{164925}{164983}Listen to what|this gentleman wants to say.
{165010}{165035}Yes.
{165068}{165101}And the day after,
{165105}{165183}other workmen came|and took everything away again.
{165233}{165270}The day after?
{165301}{165395}In 18 months,|three deliveries and three removals.
{165466}{165520}I was here a while ago.
{165551}{165603}- Do you remember?|- Nine.
{165662}{165756}- What do you mean?|- You've been here nine times.
{165805}{165840}Today makes 10.
{165848}{165934}I was wondering if you saw|a woman leave the villa.
{165964}{166040}Medium height, light hair,|a bit pale?
{166071}{166163}- Yes.|- That time was 231.
{166201}{166235}Are you sure?
{166243}{166283}Then another six.
{166303}{166421}In a year and a half,|I saw her go out 237 times.
{166430}{166463}What did I say?
{166468}{166526}She's a phenomenon,|remembers everything.
{166575}{166611}It's not possible.
{166672}{166722}You were at the villa 63 times.
{166731}{166824}36 during the day and 27 at night,
{166832}{166887}excluding the night|of the accident.
{166922}{167003}- One, four, four.|- One, four, four?
{167011}{167065}The telephone number|for the ambulance.
{167100}{167137}The villa is free now.
{167146}{167216}If you're interested,|I'll get you a good deal.
{167254}{167317}- Who owns it?|- Me.
{167346}{167395}But I don't know what to do with it.
{167421}{167484}I often rent it out to cinema people.
{167506}{167539}Cinema people?
{167553}{167623}For the past two years,|it's been taken by the engineer
{167627}{167688}who does the lift|that takes me up to my house.
{167707}{167747}He's really nice, that boy.
{167769}{167809}He can do anything.
{167813}{167872}There's nothing he can't fix.
{167886}{167966}And he's always kissing me.
{167970}{168012}Bringing me flowers.
{171949}{172039}The Paris Express|is now arriving at platform seven.
{172074}{172115}Your attention, please.
{172119}{172186}The Berlin-Prague Arrow|is running 40 minutes late
{172190}{172218}due to fog on the line.
{172262}{172299}Come in, sir.
{172331}{172387}We furnished it|exactly as you requested.
{172421}{172480}And tomorrow, your trunks|will be delivered.
{172485}{172559}And later, I'll pass by|with a copy of your contract.
{172567}{172647}If there's anything else,|please don't hesitate to call.
{172801}{172838}Oh, Virgil.
{172872}{172972}If anything should happen to us,|I want you to know that I do love you.
{176395}{176445}Are you on your own, sir?
{176698}{176762}No. I'm waiting for someone.
The New South Wales government has unveiled a radical solution to the water crisis.
It plans to tap into an abandoned reservoir under the city.
$95 million will be spent on a state-of-the-art water recycling facility in the heart of Sydney.
My name is Natasha Warner and I've worked in news and current affairs for well over 10 years.
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.
I knew I wanted to communicate to the public and, um, that looked like the perfect place for me.
The NSW Minister for Water and the Environment has been under sustained fire for 12 months now.
Sydney's water reserves are at an all-time low.
We are a progressive government and in the face of climate change we need to look at all possibilities, and recycling water is definitely the way of the future.
I first came across a story which was focusing on the government that had just announced some water recycling plans and they wanted to use abandoned underground tunnels in one of our biggest rail systems.
Thousands of people pass through here each day not realising the state government's solution to the water crisis is beneath their feet.
The plan is to build recycling infrastructure to make use of millions of litres of water trapped in disused train tunnels.
I didn't realise how vast they were.
There's virtually a whole other city underneath us.
Welfare groups say the tunnels are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.
Building underground water recycling infrastructure would leave them with nowhere to go.
The new homeless concerns are likely to cause another road block for the government's water crisis solution.
In a similar scenario in the US, hundreds of homeless were recently evicted from underground tunnels.
It caused a public relations nightmare.
You can quickly see why the government's having so much trouble evicting the homeless.
I mean, trying to navigate through this maze of dark tunnels is hard.
Trying to find people hiding in here is virtually impossible.
The Water and Environment minister says there is no evidence of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.
He says if Labor wins the election, the water solution will proceed.
After the initial fanfare the story dried up
It was like the whole thing never happened.
That's when alarm bells went off in my head. Things just don't disappear.
Whenever something's not spoken about, I've got to ask why.
It's my job as a journalist.
Cheers, John. Happy birthday.
My birthday
What's your birthday message?
What do you have to say?
Uh, John
Actually, I can tell you a story about John.
You guys may not know this one, it was way back in 1991.
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.
I've been working in news and current affairs since the mid-'80s.
Me and Pete had just started, and they sent us to the first Gulf War.
So we had to phone home to the office, to John, who was the news director at the time, and said, "Send us more cash.
"We need to get some gas masks and chemical suits and stuff."
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.
We've got this cash in our hand, we've gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"
And the air raid sirens, everyone else is fucking pulling on their masks, and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."
You kind of get married to the job, so the people you work with, they end up becoming like family members.
You've met our soundo.
He's an incredibly handsome young man, but he's not very good at his job.
Come here, Tangles.
What're you talking about?
I'm talking about the time in the States we went
Two weeks you went without headphones.
Remember that?
And did anyone notice?
No-one noticed!
He's a genius.
That's how good I am.
I don't even need to hear it,
I feel it on the knobs.
When you get that gang on the road, when you get Steve and Tangles out on a shoot, they're just
They're professional, but they're also kids.
At the end of the day they like to muck around and have a bit of a laugh.
I remember Natasha, she was at another network and then a couple of years later they brought her across to us.
First impression?
Just another young person coming in getting paid too much money, hadn't really proved herself.
But, you know, she was the next big thing.
Hey, Pete! Pete!
A business meeting?
Production meeting.
Production meeting.
Talking about producing some, uh
.. sea-man.
Well, yeah...produ
How's that? You'd better turn that off soon.
Pete!
Pete!
Hey?
The one that got away!
I'm not away, I'm here.
Haven't we done that story before?
Come in here, mate.
Pete and I, we had an interesting working relationship.
He was very determined in the way he would do his job and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.
Sometimes that would work well together, and sometimes it would sort of cause a bit of friction.
Whenever her name came up, the subject was changed pretty quickly.
When you think back on it now, you sort of go,
"Oh, yeah, there was something going on there."
I came across a YouTube video which showed some youths defacing and vandalising areas around the tunnels.
Sef? Did you do this?
You are fucking kidding me!
Fucking teach them a lesson, then, eh?
I fucking will.
This is what I think of your shit, MK.
Within that clip itself there was something unknown.
Quite clearly, though, there was something there in the tunnel.
Fuck was that?
Shh... Shh
What was that?
Shut up.
Fuck, what the fuck was that?
They're still here.
Oi!
Give me the torch...
Sef, come on, let's get out of here.
Just fucking give me the torch, you bitch!
No, don't! Come on!
It's cool, it's fucking cool. Oi!
Think you can tag on my fuckin' work, do ya?
Fuck, Sef, come on.
We've gotta fucking
Fuck.
Sef!
Sef?
Sef? What the hell, Sef? Come on!
Hold on. Sef, ANSWER ME!
Sef!
Fuck this. I'm out of here.
Dez, hold on. Don't go anywhere. Wait.
J, come on!
Dez, stop!
Dez, don't rack off!
What the fuck are you doing? Help!
Sef? Sef, answer me, please!
Once I saw that clip, I thought,
"This is a story I can go to John with."
You know,
"Finally it's got some strength."
Since when does a decent journalist use YouTube as research?
It was a good clip, but at the time
I thought, "She's crazy."
When I pitched the story to John, he put Pete on this.
What that meant was
Pete had an upcoming job and story in China which he was very, very passionate about.
And I had to give him the news that he was taken off the story.
I first heard about the tunnels being a potential story for us just as we were prepping up actually to go to China, with Pete.
Hey, mate, there's a focus chart there somewhere.
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.
Beauty.
He'd been working on this thing for a long time and he was pretty pumped to get over there and get stuck into it.
I think he had some pretty good leads, which could have blown his career wide open... it was great.
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.
No more throwing cameras around stairwells.
Yeah, I told you guys it's not my fault, alright?
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.
More room for cheap DVDs, pirated software
You're all class, mate.
It was purely John's decision to put Pete on this story.
Well, I was a little uncomfortable with having Pete there to start with.
Like I said before, we weren't exactly always gelling.
I was really nervous about talking to Pete.
I didn't wanna tell him.
It's not that exciting, when you're building your hopes up for this great big story and then you sort of get given a shit sandwich.
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.
I thought that Pete having to postpone what he had planned was worth it in the end for the story.
He did say he went in to see John.
I don't know what happened in that room, and the contents of that conversation but, yeah, he had spoken to John about it, and I think it was from that point on it was clear he wasn't going to China and Nat had won the day.
Why did John go the other way?
C'mon. We all know why John was favouring Nat.
Eh?
Once Peter was on the story we started attending the daily pressers to try and find out what happened to the water recycling plans.
Pete was pissed off, but, you know, Pete's a pro.
Took him a day or two, then he came round just like the guy he is.
He started to do his own searching around
He had contacts in the council who he spoke to.
And some rumours started to surface that not only were there homeless living in the tunnels, but there were homeless that were going missing.
You know, at that point we slowly started to think there may be something in this.
So we just started by chasing the then water minister.
The main thing that was apparent
That he was staying quiet on the topic.
He wouldn't talk to us... no-one would talk to us.
At that point, we were just getting stonewalled.
If it was true that homeless were going missing, this was a big story.
And it was a really important one.
Where is he?
Through here.
Minister!
Minister, have you seen the report about the homeless people in the tunnels?
Nothing to say at the moment.
Have you scrapped your plans because people are going missing in the tunnels?
No comment. No comment.
Minister, should people be worried?
Is there a threat in the underground tunnels?
Well?
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?
I knew we wouldn't get anything.
I think that definitely on quite a large scale there was a lot of people in the government that knew what was going on.
They knew what was going on down there.
You know, with everything that's happened subsequently, they were hiding stuff.
I started getting in contact with a few of the shelters around the city, and eventually I came across one particular homeless man who I had believed had been living in the tunnels.
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.
We had, finally, someone to speak to.
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.
I'm not sure how she found Trevor, but Natasha found Trevor.
We went down to this home, and we sat him down for an interview.
Yeah, sweet.
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.
Trevor, if you don't feel comfortable with anything you let me know at any time.
And, um, when I'm asking you the questions, if you're not quite sure of an answer, that's OK
We can fix it up later, so don't worry about that.
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.
Well, the interview with Trevor was a tricky one but something that I am, I guess, always quite accustomed to dealing with.
Trevor, I understand you've been living it rough
Call me Trev.
Trev? OK.
Trev, I understand you've been living it rough for quite some time now.
What circumstances took you to living in the tunnels?
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates warm in the winter. Yeah.
It all started out great, chatting away to him.
He started to tell me a little bit about, you know, his circumstances, what led him to live in the tunnels.
He started to really paint a picture of what it was like there.
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry and some of the others, do they still live down there... now?
No.
Trev?
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?
Hmm. Yeah.
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor what he perhaps had been through in the tunnels.
I asked Trevor what he had seen.
Clearly something had happened to him.
Trevor, did you know someone who went missing?
Trevor, did anything happen to you down there?
Trevor
.. are you alright?
NO!
Shit.
Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Oh, my God
Crazy.
I know.
After Trevor's interview, it was clear we were onto something.
All the pieces of the puzzle were symptoms of something deeper,
I just didn't know what.
I needed more.
We needed to get down there.
Your call may be recorded for training purposes.
Please advise your operator if you do not wish your call to be recorded.
Hello, this is Pam.
Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?
I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.
Look, I'm just wondering if you can help me out.
I'm working on a story and I need to get into the tunnels under the CBD.
Who do I need to talk to to make that happen?
Right. What's the story?
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.
Um...just hang on a sec
Nat, sorry... I can't help you this time.
What?
Apparently no-one's getting in there, and I don't think you'll be getting any special treatment.
C'mon, Pam, it's me.
Exactly. And people got burnt last time. I can't do it.
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?
I'm sorry, Nat.'Bye.
Look, I just need half
I guess it's easier to look at it now and say that I was perhaps under a lot of pressure to get this story.
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.
I was so focused on just doing my job.
There was a lot of rumours kicking around she was in big trouble, and she kind of really needed to lift her game otherwise she was gone.
Well, I think that I'd put a lot of work into my career and I think it was all basically hanging on this one...one story.
You know, I didn't really have a choice.
Hey, Tangles, how's your head, mate?
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.
Here we go... this is what you looked like after Steve pulled you out of the loo last night.
Oh, Steve, new toy.
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.
Good at spending the network's money.
It's not just water-resistant, it's fully waterproof?
Yeah, waterproof, mate.
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.
Sure, mate.
Sweet.
Rolling.
Uh, great.
Pete, I'll just get you to say some shit.
Hang on...
One, two.
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."
Um, yes, very excited to be going down the smelly sewers
Hello. How'd you go?
Haven't got all the permits sorted but, um, John's got us covered, OK?
When Natasha said that John was covering us and we didn't have permits
That's kind of a pretty loose arrangement, you know, you just sort of sit there and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."
You sure?
Yeah.
When?
We're on for tonight.
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?
Yep.
As a crew, it's... it's our job to film it and get coverage.
It's really not our job to question it.
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.
Yeah? OK.
Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.
We're just gonna be filming for about half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.
Permit?
Yeah, uh
You got a permit?
I've got a driver's license.
Pete... how much have you got in your wallet?
You're kidding me, aren't you?
We're not third world here, it's not gonna work.
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.
Told you.
Fucking hell.
Let's go, come on.
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.
We decided to find another way in, with or without official...assistance.
We found some access round the other side.
Yeah, it looked like a maintenance access.
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.
I, at that point, was starting to feel as though there was something not quite right.
Um, so I thought, to cover myself and to cover Tangles, and really to cover all of us,
I'd just film pretty much everything that was happening there.
You know, I thought we had to have some sort of way of protecting ourselves, should something go wrong.
You know, if we got busted and fined or whatever, arrested, um, you know, I had some evidence it wasn't me trying to push us down there, and it wasn't Tangles, but it was Natasha.
Here... take this.
Here we go.
OK, let's go.
You right? You want me to...
Take this.
Yep.
OK, make it quick.
We just were kind of covering our tracks as we went down
You know, we didn't want to get discovered.
Looking back on that
.. that was probably a mistake.
We OK?
Hey?
Are we OK to be down here?
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.
When we start filming a story
When we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll"
Pete and Natasha, they look after the editorial content, and, you know, it's kind of my job to take over there and look after the pictures.
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.
You guys just hang back there for a second.
Tangles and I would go off and we'd just start getting stuck into it, filming like we always would.
You know, don't really need direction, we'd just get into it.
Once we got in sort of a little bit further, there were whole sections of tunnels that were absolutely, absolutely pitch black.
It is completely black down there.
You know, you could go in there, turn the light off, spin around and you wouldn't know where you were.
'Cause there's junctions, tunnels going off everywhere.
So I kind of thought
The first time I turned off the light and stood there, I thought we're gonna have to keep the light on and stay across where we are
'cause otherwise it's going to be pretty easy to get lost down there.
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?
Just come here, mate.
There's something wrong with my light. Can you check it out?
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?
Ah, shit!
How did I not see that coming?
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.
Great.
Let's go.
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels, but the further we got in, the more we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.
There were whole sections of tunnels that weren't even on the map.
Just give us some light here, Steve.
OK. So that's the entrance, that's where we came down before
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.
OK, through here.
Yep. That must be the way.
Once we got through and past the maintenance areas and we got into a little bit more of the guts of the tunnels, my impressions were that...that it was amazing.
It was vast, this place was huge.
That's awesome.
Shit, the sound's great.
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes to grab some overlay here?
I'll give you five.
Five?
Yep.
We were very close to the station there, so, um, you know, Pete was trying to make us pretty low-key.
I was blown away by the size of it... it was massive, and just eerie.
You know, I think we were all in awe of it.
It wasn't really difficult to get great-looking shots down there, you know, 'cause you're really just painting stuff with your light and whatever you saw there just was... it looked really cool.
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.
The history to these tunnels, the ones in particular that we were looking at, was just incredible.
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.
They were to be used as an underground rail system.
Then in World War II they were used as air raid shelters.
Come have a look at this.
The current NSW government is not the first to use these tunnels for another purpose.
I'm standing in a section of tunnel that was converted into an air raid shelter during World War ll.
It's complete with all the amenities that enabled soldiers to stay for extended periods.
Various rooms were then, um, reused and fashioned for training for the SAS.
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use, and even to this day with the water recycling plans that were announced.
I was fortunate enough to come across an area where it was evident that there was definitely, you know, homeless or, you know, people living down there.
That's good...good just here.
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.
Go when you're ready.
We've been walking in the tunnel for less than an hour, and already we've come across somebody's home.
Here you can see their makeshift bed, blanket and empty tins of food.
Coming across the belongings was very important
It was vital to the story.
It was absolute proof that there was life down here.
While there is no sign of an occupant at the moment, it is clear the minister's assertions of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.
This was something that the government were denying.
This is something that we could now prove.
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you going down there, actually.
Yeah, cool.
Oh, hey. Light.
Cheers.
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?
He mustn't like working on the show.
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?
Yeah, I'm right.
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.
Nat? Look, we've already got the sleeping bags and stuff, we don't really need to get the lake.
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.
I just think it's a little...
I'm fine!
Just let's keep going.
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.
After what happened last time, she's treading on thin ice.
Yeah, I reckon.
That's why John put me onto this... make sure she doesn't fuck up again.
If she's not up to it, why doesn't he give her the arse?
Mate, I think John'd wanna give her a little more than just that.
Well, he'd have to get in line behind you, wouldn't he?
Hey, guys, you might wanna know for future reference that these tunnels carry sound pretty well.
And as far as I can hear, you're all arseholes.
Fuck off!
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.
There you go, mate.
Get down there, you arsehole.
Pete, can you just lift that handle up for me? Get a bit of sound.
Where to? Just
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.
What are we doing?
Just...just give it a kick.
You call it.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.
Thanks, guys.
The lake was just...so...vast.
I mean, this thing runs a kilometre long.
It's bigger than I thought.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Me and Tangles were mucking around a bit
We like to play jokes on each other.
You know, if I didn't do it, he would've done it.
So I just grabbed him and sort of went
.. you know, at the edge of the lake, went to push him in.
You know how you go up, hold onto their shoulders and pull them back again?
Which I did, and then I let go of him, and went to walk back to the camera
In he went.
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.
Steve, you...prick.
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.
Are you gonna give him a hand?
No, fuck him!
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?
How long are we gonna be down here, alright?
Tangles, as much as we used to joke around and muck around together, when it came time to work, you know, he was very serious, and it wasn't time for joking.
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.
OK.
Nat, just come forward a fraction.
So, you know, when he's sort of giving me the impression that there were problems,
I was believing him.
I'm standing directly below one of Sydney's busiest train stations.
Behind me is the forgotten water resource that's causing all the controversy.
Earlier this year the government
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.
You weren't whispering?
No.
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.
When you're ready, Nat.
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.
Behind me is the forgotten water resource
Nat, sorry. Are you guys fucking with me? What's the noise?
What are you hearing, mate?
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.
Sweet, um, I don't know.
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.
Just go straight through.
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.
I can't describe how silent the place was, so at the time I didn't feel that... he could have been hearing anything.
It...it was strange.
I was just thinking, you know, it could have been a technical problem, could have been anything... some
RF interference, anything like that.
But, you know, Tangles was adamant there was something going on, and, uh, when he's serious about something, you know, you believe him.
Earlier this year, the government announced, then quietly abandoned, plans to recycle water from this lake.
The Minister for Water has yet to give a reason why.
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?
Oh...yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.
Alright, let's go.
After we'd finished our piece at the lake, um, we decided to head for the bell room.
Righto, Nat.
Basically the bell room was built as like a air raid sort of alert back in the war.
They would use it to warn people of danger.
When we rang the bell, it...it was deafening.
It rattled your ribs.
This bell is a relic of World War ll.
It remains here in the confines of an air raid shelter, as a reminder of what imminent danger sounds like.
Shit, that blew my levels right off the meter, sorry. Um
Hang on. Nat, can you just hit the bell once more?
Yep. Ready to go?
Yep.
How's that?
Nah, look, if you want me to get that, it's probably best I boom it from down the hall.
Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.
Tangles decided to, um, go into the adjoining room off the bell room and boom it from there just to basically kill the sound of the level of the bell, which was just making his levels peak out.
I don't really know much about recording sound, but I did at the time remember thinking, "That's a bit weird."
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.
Surely it's that simple?
Uh, Steve, can you do me a favour?
Can you just listen on the cans, watch the levels for me?
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can do camera, he must be able to do sound.
Nah, mate, I've done enough hard work today.
That's good, Nat, yeah.
I'll do it for ya, mate.
Sorry, guys, it's just way too echoey in here.
He asked me to listen to the audio for him, which was fine.
It's just put on the headphones and listen to it as it's being recorded.
Here, Tangles. Take that.
Thanks very much.
And then so Nat just went ahead and did it again, and, uh...that's
That's when, uh
.. that's when I heard it.
Yeah, ready to go.
Bell atmos.
Whenever you're ready, Nat.
What the fuck?
Did you... did you hear that?
Yeah.
Yo, Tangles!
Tangles!
Shit.
Tangles!
Pete, we need some light down here, mate. Tangles!
Quick, light.
Shit. Steve, where are you?
Down here. Straight, straight, straight.
Just give us the camera, mate.
He's... he's gone.
Where'd he go?
Tangles!
What did you hear in the headphones?
Tangles!
What did you hear in your headphones?
Tangles!
Would he be dickin' us round?
Tangles!
Tangles, come on, mate!
Steve, through here.
Tangles!
Tangles!
Yo, Tangles!
Here, I'll go down here.
Yeah.
You know, I knew there was something wrong.
I knew he wasn't mucking around.
My initial thought was just to get to him.
It wasn't unlike them, so I guess my first instinct was that they were having a joke.
What, Nat thought we were playing a prank, did she?
You've spoken to her?
She thought we were fucking around?
Tangles, you good?
Yep. Ready to go.
Bell atmos.
Tangles!
Maybe through here...
No, that's a dead end.
Tangles!
Watch your step.
Tangles!
Ah, great.
What's up?
Battery.
You alright?
Yeah, fuck. It's alright.
Need the light? You got a spare?
Yeah, it's in here, hang on.
OK.
It became pretty evident, quite quickly, that we weren't gonna be able to find anyone or anything without light.
Got it.
We'll get him, mate. We'll find him.
We'll find him, alright?
Tangles!
Now, I had my camera light and I knew I had about two, maybe three hours tops worth of light.
Steve, where's your kit?
Tangles!
Steve, where's your kit?
What?
Where's your kit?
It's back in the bell room.
OK. well... all the torches are back there, aren't they?
This is the only light you've got and it's fucking around.
We need the torches, mate.
We've gotta go back to the bell room.
But Tangles
It's alright. We'll get him.
We'll find him. C'mon.
Fuck.
C'mon.
Walked back into the bell room and there was nothing.
There was nothing there.
All the stuff had disappeared.
Now, that was only in a matter of
I don't know, couldn't have been too long.
Shit, everything's gone.
What?
What the hell's going on?
It certainly raised some concern because I didn't feel it was something that
Tangles could do by himself.
Fuck!
Hey, we're wasting time, guys. Let's go!
Wait.
C'mon!
Here, take this.
Pete!
Just give me some light, Steve.
OK.
OK, Tangles went through here.
If we follow that all the way round, it brings us back to this room, we can scan the whole area.
OK. So we split up and meet back here, yeah?
No, we stick together.
That's the only light we've got.
How many batteries have you got left?
I've got two in my pouch, mate.
Let's go.
Steve... STEVE!
Oh, fuck!
It won't do Tangles any good if we run round like headless cheeks.
We stick together, alright?
You'd better keep up, then.
Tangles!
Steve, wait!
C'mon, Nat.
Tangles!
Yeah, I panicked.
You know, it wasn't like
I'm trying to be a hero or anything.
You know, the smarter thing might have been to do something else but it was just instinct just kicking in.
Tangles!
So, what do you think?
Think of what?
You know, Tangles, is he dicking around?
No, he wouldn't dick around for this long.
Who took our stuff, then?
Who took it? I don't know.
Could have been the homeless, junkies
I heard it, Pete.
You heard what?
Whatever it was, mate.
Well, what was it, mate?
Steve?
Look, let's just get going, OK?
Steve? Steve? What was it?
Shit.
Watch your step.
What's in here?
Oh, fuck.
You right?
Yeah.
Nope, nothing.
Pete, we've been here twice before, mate.
The only other place has got to be the lake.
Maybe he went back from where we came.
Maybe he's waiting for us.
Oh, sure, mate. He's fucking walked out in the pitch-black.
He's at fucking Harry's, scoffing a pie.
I don't mean that.
I mean he can't contact us.
Maybe he's waiting for us.
No, Steve's right, OK?
Tangles is down here.
He's got to be at the lake, mate.
Well, how much light have you got?
I've got enough.
Alright, then.
Shh! Do you hear that?
Shh.
Shh!
Let's go!
Go.
Tangles!
Tangles!
This way! Tangles!
I heard him through here. Tangles!
Tangles! I'm coming, mate!
Oh, fuck it!
In here!
Give us a hand. Quick.
Get down and grab it at the bottom.
Fuck it! Get it off! Get it open!
Grab that back. Grab that.
Oh, shit. Steve, help.
Jesus.
Steve, light. Light.
Jesus Christ.
Steve...
Yeah?
His torch.
It's his torch, but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.
I can't really describe it, it was just
There was blood and
.. over in the corner was...Tangles's torch.
I... I sort of thought of myself as his older brother.
You know, that was the kind of relationship we had.
And, uh, he was sort of entrusted to me.
That's the way I felt about it.
Let's go.
Could be anyone.
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.
What about Tangles?
Whatever that fucking thing is, it could be nearby.
Come on.
It's Tangles.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait.
What?
Wait, where's my camera?
Just over there.
It's not where I left it.
What?
It's not where I left it.
Before we entered the room Nat put the camera, the night vision camera, on the ground just outside the door.
Um...and then we went in the room.
We wouldn't have been in there for more than two or three minutes, and then she came out, we all came out together, and she noticed the camera had been moved.
My instinct was to check it and see if it had recorded something.
Play it back.
Tangles!
Tangles!
Get down and grab it at the bottom.
Fuck it. Get it off! Get it open!
Grab that back. Grab that.
We played back the footage and, uh, someone had picked up the camera, it had come off the ground, and there were shots of us in the room.
It's his torch, but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.
Let's go.
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.
Whatever that fucking this is, it could be nearby.
It's Tangles.
Come on.
Let's go.
And then we turn to come out and...the camera goes down and we just catch a glimpse... it was just like one frame.
It happened in a split second.
I didn't know what it was, mate, but it was quick and it was fucking frightening.
Fuck.
Oi!
This isn't good.
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.
Mate, I am not fucking leaving him down here with whatever the fuck that was.
Steve, listen, listen to me.
I'm not fucking leaving him.
Look, right now my priority is with you and Nat.
I'm not going to let what happened to
Tangles happen to both of you, alright?
We have to get out to the top.
You go on your own. Leave me here.
Steve, we need your light. Come on.
You've got your own fucking light.
Listen, Steve, listen to me.
Listen to me!
Fuck off!
Listen to me!
I'm not done!
Don't fucking touch me, man!
Listen, listen!
Listen, listen, listen to me.
Whatever that fucking thing is it's going to have a harder time taking us out if we stick together.
That's bullshit.
Listen. We need to get to the top.
We need to get help.
If we get more help down here, the better chance we 're going to find Tangles.
Fucking Tangles, man.
I know, mate.
Hey, mate, I'm with you.
I'm with you.
Come on.
Come on.
Pete made sense, but I couldn't help but feel like
I was leaving Tangles behind.
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Is he OK?
Just give him a few minutes.
So, what's the plan?
We get the fuck out of here is the plan. Get back to the top.
What?
I think we should stay and look for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.
Fuck!
Just through here.
Fuck!
Back it up, back it up!
Hit the light. Kill the light.
Fuck!
Shh!
What is it, mate?
Shh, shh!
Anyone down there?
It's the guard.
Shit, it's the guard.
Who's there?
Hey, mate, it's us. It's the film crew.
I told you guys not to come down here.
Yeah, look, I know, we're sorry.
It's just our friend, he's gone missing.
Someone... something's taken him.
Right, I want all of you to come with me now.
Hey, come on!
Mate, what's happening in here?
Mate, tell us what's happening in here!
Nat, give it a break, Nat.
We're leaving. LET'S GO!
Is he going to help us?
Go! Go! Run!
Keep moving!
Keep going.
Keep going, Nat.
Fuck!
Not that way.
Here. Through here.
Kill the light.
Hey?
Steve, kill the light!
Shh!
Where are we?
Shh!
What was that?
I don't know.
Just keep it down, it could be close.
Did you see it?
No.
But whatever it was, it was fucking huge.
Nat... turn it off.
Everybody alright?
Mate, mate, I'm alright.
How about your arm?
Give me the camera.
Let me see.
I hit something when we were running. It's fine.
Shit, Steve. It looks bad.
Nah.
Here, Pete, I need to see.
Here, show me.
Fuck. Doesn't look good, mate.
I can't see.
There it is. You got it.
Just there, yeah.
Sorry, you right?
I'll be fine, yeah.
Right, buddy?
Thanks, though. Thanks.
You guys ready to move soon?
We can't stay.
I just need a minute. Hang on.
What if that thing comes back?
I don't know.
Could we take it?
I doubt it.
Only thing we've got to worry about now is getting out of here.
Hey, guys, I think it's gone.
Right, let's get moving.
Steve?
Yeah?
You right, mate?
Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm good.
Let's go.
Just keep it quiet.
Give me the camera.
Just keep it quiet, OK?
OK, let's go.
Stay close.
Through here.
OK.
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
OK.
Oh, fuck.
Pete...
Shit!
This wasn't here before.
Pete.
What are you doing?
It's not on the map.
What do you mean it's not on the map?
It's only got one way.
This has got two.
Pete, you've got to figure it out, OK?
Just chill the fuck out.
It's not easy, alright?
You've got to fix this.
Just shut the fuck up and let me get through it.
Nat, calm down, Nat.
It's through here. We came back through there. It's through here.
OK, what if it's not the right way, mate?
Well, then... we find the safest room and we wait it out.
Oh, yeah, that's a good plan.
John will figure out that we haven't called and he'll send someone down to find us.
John knows we're here, right?
Nat
Fucking tell me John knows we're here.
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.
I can't...
Are you fucking serious?
I... I needed you guys, OK?
I knew it!
I needed you guys in this.
You need us?
Yeah.
We just lost a friend.
You still need your fucking story?
No.
Huh?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Keep you voice down.
You think you're a fucking journalist.
Shh!
We came down here to get a story, didn't we?
And now we've got an important one, and you're fucking running scared!
Shhh!
Here's your fucking story.
Here, you want your piece to camera?
Come on. Let's go.
What's your piece to camera for this one, huh?
Do you want to tell us how... how you lost your friend because of your fucking stupidity?
Come on.
Waiting.
Fuck you.
Come on, Nat.
Come on.
The best journalists can work under any pressure, any sort of circumstance, come on.
See, you can't say shit, can you?
You know why?
Because you're not there, Nat.
You're just not there.
You're fucking pathetic.
Here. Through here.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Listen.
Shh!
What the fuck...?
What?
Shh.
What is it?
Hear that?
Through here.
Kill the light.
Shh!
Open the door, Nat.
Open it up. Open it up.
Guys, the lake's just here.
Fuck!
Shh!
Let me see, let me see.
Is it Tangles, mate?
Shh, shh.
What is it?
It's not Tangles.
What's happened to his face?
Oh, Jesus.
It's his eyes. Oh, Jesus.
What's happening?
We've got to help him.
Let me see.
Shh.
Shh!
Oh, fuck. It's seen us.
We got to go, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!
Steve!
Fuck! Let's go. Ah!
Go, go, GO!
Just move it!
Jesus. Which way? Which way?
This way?
Go! Go now!
Where? Where?
Here, here, here. Through here!
Steve!
Go!
Come on! Keep moving!
Steve! Is he still behind us?
I think we lost him!
You sure?
I think so!
Shit.
I think we lost it!
I don't... I don't think it followed us.
In here. There's a light in here.
Here, here.
There.
What's that?
I think it's the Cross City Tunnel.
Hello?
This is a bad place to stop.
No, it's fucking pointless.
Hello?!
Shit, Pete.
Shh!
Hello! Hello!
Shh! Shh!
You've got to keep it down.
There's no-one there, there's no-one there.
Please, someone... help. Hello!
Shh, shh.
Hello! Help!
Help!
Shh! Nat, please. Let go. Please.
You have to be quiet!
Help!
Shh!
Shh! Nat, Nat, Nat.
Hey, you guys.
Help!
You've gotta keep your voice down.
Shhh!
Shut her up.
Shh. Shh.
You get anything?
Can you see anything?
Chuck the light.
Chuck the light over there.
Nuh.
It's alright.
I'm sorry.
Hey?
I'm sorry.
It's alright, don't be sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Shh.
It's OK, shh. Shh.
Everything was unravelling.
It... it was because of me.
I never meant for things to get so out of hand.
Well, I didn't mean to let Pete down. I mean, I
I had thought I'd made the right choice at the time and I didn't mean to let him down.
Steve, through here.
Quick, quick. Come on, move it, mate.
Up here.
Nat. Up.
Come on. Shh!
Here, Nat, take this.
Ohhh!
Mate, get up! Come on!
Ugh!
You know, my natural instinct was to turn around with the light, see what was going on.
We'd just heard this sound,
Pete yelling out, and, uh, as soon as they sort of fell into the pool of light the thing just...disappeared... upped and left
And that sort of dawned on me then that the light was our way of keeping it away from us.
Shit. Are you OK? You OK?
Come on!
Fuck! Did you see that?
It took off.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
It didn't like the light.
Well, keep it on, then.
Hold on. Nat.
Nat!
Ah!
No!
Come on, come on!
Come on, you fucker!
Pete! Pete, don't.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Come on!
It was almost like it was trying to get us in a position where it could get to us as well.
It reminded me of a lion trying to cut one animal out of a pack, a herd.
You know, get the weak one out, easy to attack.
Ah! Oh, fuck! Fuck.
We're losing the light!
Oh, fuck!
- Steve!
Oh, shit!
Back, back, back!
BACK! Fuck!
Go through.
What's the matter?
No, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I thought that was it... it was over.
There was nowhere left to run.
Then I saw this tiny bit of wall that looked like it had broken away.
Pete, take this, take this.
Take it!
Oh, shit!
Give her a hand, Pete. Get in there.
Hold the light still.
Easy, Nat.
Shh, keep it down. Keep it down.
Keep it down.
Here, come through, Steve.
Huh?
Come through.
Go, go, go.
Go on, you go first.
Come on, Nat.
Good girl.
Here, take this... quick.
Here, Nat.
OK.
Shh, shh, keep it down. Shh!
This isn't good.
Steve.
Steve, is that...? God.
This isn't good.
Steve.
Yeah?
We've got to go.
Fuck!
Light, mate, light.
Sorry.
It's gone.
Batteries.
Steve
Fuck, I need some light over here.
Quick, Nat, light.
Nat, the fucking light, Nat. Fuck!
Give me the torch.
Oh, shit! That one's dead.
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one left.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Steve, we need that light.
We need the fucking light.
Steve, I need the fucking light!
Come on!
OK.
Oh, Jesus.
OK, now
RUN!
Steve.
Steve. OK, OK.
Steve.
Come on. It's going for her.
It's going for her.
We've got to go.
Come on. Come on.
Nat!
Nat!
Let her go!
Let her go, you fucker!
Nat!
Take her. Take her!
OK.
Go. Just go!
Come on, Nat. Alright, let's go.
Oh, shit. Come on.
- Come on!
Come on, you fucker!
Come on, Nat.
Come on, let's move!
No...
Move!
No.
Come on.
Come on.
Wait!
Come on.
But Pete...
Come on!
No. Steve, we can't leave.
Come on!
We got
Nat, keep moving.
Keep moving!
No.
We've got to keep moving!
You can't leave Pete.
We can't! We've got to go!
Come on, Nat.
We've got to keep moving.
I think that Pete was looking out for us and I didn't want to leave him there.
Come on! Come on.
Pete wanted us to be safe...
I understand that.
But I didn't...
I didn't want to leave Pete behind.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
- Guys!
Guys!
Shit!
Guys!
Oh, fuck. It's Pete. Fuck.
Come on, man!
When I heard Pete's voice coming down that tunnel, out of the darkness, uh
I mean, I wasn't expecting to hear his voice again.
Pete, no...
I can't
No
Let's go.
Let's go!
No, Pete...
- Nat!
Pete, are you OK? Stay with me.
Help! Get some help! Someone!
I need a phone! I need a phone!
Give me a phone! Give me a phone!
Hey.
Hello. Police, fire or ambulance?
Hello?
Yes. Hello?
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?
Hello!
Help! We need help, we need help!
OK, miss, we'll get you some help.
What's happened?
We're on platform one.
We're in the station.
Please, you gotta get someone here now.
My friend is dying. He's bleeding.
Please calm down, miss.
I need you to tell me exactly where you are and what's happening.
I don't know... we're in the station and something... something took our friend.
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!
What are you doing?!
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Are you there?
Hello?
Pete... Hey, Pete.
Pete
I'm sorry... Pete! PETE!
Yeah, it's kind of hard to... to talk about it now.
But I didn't know he was dying at that point.
You know, I thought we were all gonna be fine.
I mean
.. it had been so difficult to get to that point where we got there, and then, you know, I thought we were going to be OK.
There was people around us, there was light.
I...you know... I would have been doing more if I thought he was lying there dying.
I...I feel that I could have done more to help Pete.
You know, it's, um...it's easy to say that you would do things differently, you know.
It just didn't seem...very fair.
I got told by the first paramedics that, you know... they'd sort of given up working on him, they sort of...you know... took a while to get Nat away from him.
And, uh, it slowly, slowly dawned on me about that point, you know.
They sort of walked away from him.
He was just lying there, and he wasn't moving, and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."
I feel...I feel...I feel responsible.
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.
I can't help thinking we were so close.
Help was right there.
I go over it again and again.
Just constantly.
What would I do differently?
I was just pissed off with everyone, everything.
The government
.. the police
I mean, how much evidence do you want?
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.
It's just fucking sad.

If the system is rebooted,
The entire bank closed.

I do not want to add more murders more add to my list perpetrator.
He wears shorts in a bank robbery.
We need to murder him.
How old do you think?
- We need to murder him.
Why do we have guns?
I want to shoot him.
The guns were meant for hostages.
That was the plan.
Now we have two hostages.
- What is our plan?
If they want to bank with us rob, we do it.
If they want to murder us,
We then murder them first.
Cool plan.
- Listen. We take them to the vault.
If the ATM you want, fine.
Leave us alone.
- Roger that, big guy.
That mean you do not?
What does he want?
- That we come to him?
It's good. Come here you.

You're crazy.
Want to come?

Of course guns. Thank you guards are worthless.

Shut up and touch nothing.
Go to that door.
May I ...
- Stay away from that door.
Please do not kill me on the toilet.

Are not you ashamed?
Those guys are great.
- Fantastic.
We apologize on behalf of the bank.
Equally correct.
It really sorry.
Please, Rex.
- I'm Rex Neubauer.
I work for loans and we are lucky.
I am a certified consultant robbery.
I got to 75 survivors of bank robberies advice given.
We'll work it out.
Our first goal is ... for a peaceful co-unity.
Can I help you?
Our goal is to come live here.
As an expert in standard bank robberies procedures ...
This bank robbery is not standard.
Two robberies in progress.
And one dead. A guarantee that the robbers come and murder us.
Do not say that.
- I do not want to die.
Let's stay calm.
This bank is open five hours.
Then I and my colleagues have long gone.
We're all trapped.
Even if you come out of this kitchen then you are not from the bank.
So sit down and shut up.
- If we often go to the toilet?
There's toilet break.
You will not try to escape ... or contact with someone outside the bank. And no noise.
Alarm on your watch?
Are you in the sixth grade?
It runs every hour.
In memory of my medications.
Unfortunately I have not.
Or has anyone Deprocaine?
I have Xanax.
- I have Ativan and Prilosec.
I have a couple of Ritalin.
- I have maybe some Prozac.
I Adderol and Nassonex.
- Are you kidding me?
Shut up.
I just said, 'not talk'.
What's going on?
- Is Oprah's book club here?
Should I beat up someone? - No.
Have you turned off the cameras and computers?
Do I really did not beat anyone up?
- I just said that.
Go get the scrambler.
That's ridiculous accent.
Before we get to work, let us first look at the other boys.
I will start shortly with the lance, ensure that the time slot is ready on time.
No problems. We came just look at your toys.
You look so great.
- Did you see my face?
Did you see my face?
- No.
Admit it. Do not lie to me.
You've seen my face.
I may have seen your face.
- I've seen it too.
A very attractive face.
- Shut up.
You are damn kids.
You are worse than my kids.
You do not know ... what you are doing.
Have you ever rob a bank?
A lot.
- We had the job with ...
The Calahan brothers in Dubuque.
- What are you doing?
That's what I mean.
Say nothing about those other jobs.
And nothing about the people you've done it.
Rob no bank without a mask.
Come on, guys.
That's asking for trouble.
Like your tattoos.
- Like them?
Look at this.
You can try to tie me ... but it does not.
He did not understand. Do it again.
- I understand it really.
I think I need to talk slower.
Criminals usually try their characteristics are not showing.
Duce not identified be.
You may have spouses and wives who will panic ... when you get home tonight.
You may leave a ring.
You say that with a friend to stay overnight ... and you will be persuasive.
Otherwise I'll shoot you mess.
Who is first?
You?
You? No?
You then, with that ugly tie.
Honey?
Number two is done.
Now, number three.
We are 49 minutes behind schedule.
- Copy that.
I always got that blue stuff ... this was on sale.
- I love that you're so economical.
Maybe we should be sure read the instructions.
Is that Korean?
- No, Chinese.
Chinese are icons.
- Is that so? Explosives are explosives.
I come tonight to the airport ...
My mother is sick and I stay with her.
Maybe we can go tomorrow. I love you.
I have no one to call.
- No one? That is pathetic.
Fuck it. This is the saddest group of hostages that I have ever seen.
Sit down and shut up.
- I just said that.
I just left a message.
As I predicted,
They have not killed us.
Tripp was it?
Do you want to apologize, because
You have provided us a terror?
Why did they kill us?
- Why would they have to murder us?
They have been convicted of a murder.
Why not ... all the witnesses murder?
I would do.
Might think the robbers are the other did it ... so they do not need to murder.
- It's express shot.
We must find out who he is and why he killed Jack Hayes.
How do you know his name?
Driver's license.
- You have a dead man's wallet stolen?
Great.
Gates, you're up.
Like a gun in a brown paper bag need.
Tell me about it.
Do you see a clue?
- I do not know what profession they hold.
His business cards are credit card, his transfer pass ...
Those are the Citibank, but not just international.
Why do we check him as he has no business card?
Maybe he has a new account opened.
Gordon, the computers stood by the mainframe.
Madge's money counting.
A strict security guard at the door.
Looks at the lady ... held by the Office of the loans is.
Kaitlin is in her area.
And Jack Hayes was ...
Jack Hayes opened any new accounts.
He was to ogle at the desk.
Otherwise he was to a bank employee went.
What was he doing here?
I have no idea.
I feel your breath.
What are you doing?
Hello, Tripp.
What are you doing?
Looking for a way out.
- Did not you think they will murder us?
I may just have your ring?
How long have you been engaged?
That way we'll find out.
Why your wedding with Max?
You know him do not agree.
- I know he is rich ...
He can not meet your appetite for adventure meet and your sense of humor ...
He sexually satisfy you.
She told me that he his pants had been found. - Madge.
She knows him for two months, and I have not met him yet.
Enough.
- There are four pictures of you on that drive.
Three from Brazil. You're an adventurer.
Max is totally irrelevant.
He was with the Banana.
He was badly burned. He remained in that day.
The worst part is yours and Max for his mansion.
You are so small compared to that house.
He loves the house than yours there.
Who are you?
- The most interesting thing about you is ... you are still working, even though you do not need the money.
You're an independent woman.
I like that.
Count on that.
- If I did not use medication ...
I'm not very good with ...
- People?
Certainly not one I wants to bed.
And then I say such things.
Stop it.
Because of you we are all killed.
Be still there.
They call me Mr. Clean.
Where are you from?
No English.
- That I have been. To "No English".
That is close to 'No problem'.
The trip.
It can.
Come on it.
Now we have to murder him.
- Calm down.
Does your computer have?
Yes, that still works.
- How much time do we lose them?
Approximately one hour.
Let us remember that safe and we murder that shit.
Then we crack ATMs.
- That is the blue color.
This is the blue color.
- We need to do murder ...
This slows us only.
A bullet in their brains.
We have blown up the ATM?
The biggest job you ever did.
You have just three bars ... dynamite eaten.
- Do we have blown up the ATM?
Let me see.
Do you want the good or the bad news?
The good news.
- That is, we have blown the door.
The bad news is, that the ATM is intact.
Two doors.
I have not even pulled the trigger.
That thing just went off.
On your knees.
Facing forward.
Hands behind your head.
You're going to die, so you have no extras required.
Do you have any ideas?
- See you on the other side.
You have to focus on the brains?
Then you have less junk or something?
It was fun, man.
Very nice. I had to no one else to do.
In practical terms, this is not a good idea.
- You said we could murder him.
Let me see the place.
- If you blowing something next time ... let us know.
- You got it.
I want to personally thank that you do not murder.
Are we going to murder them?
Are you crazy?
Why are you out of the kitchen?
- We have to murder them all.
You have missed.
He has to grab you?
- What?
Your ear.
- My ear?
I mean that.
Get ready to die.
Shoot him.
- I will.
Then I will shoot you down, and this circle violence may continue forever.
Come on, dick.
Do it.
You want them to shoot me.
We are better than that.
Then I walk back.
Gates, bring the hostages to that office.
Do it.
Is it, good butter cookie?
Why talk to a hostage against me?
Somebody killed him, and they will soon again a murder.
The man with the jacket.
I was not. I was not in the right corner.
Who had the good or corner?
Are you Dwayne?
Pay attention to the hostages.
Take it easy.
You're hyper.
You need a sedative.
What is wrong with you? I have a gun on the back of your head.
What were you talking about?
- They wanted to know ... if I thought you're the man the jacket had been murdered.
Really?
- Yes.
Have you done that?
- No, we're professionals.
If one of us the guy was killed,
The hostages would be dead.
Why are there two bank robbers killed at the same time?
Are you kidding?
- No.
At seven hours that computer guy the whole security system is restarted.
This is a new protocol. The whole security was two minutes flat.
That no more bank robbers were here tonight I'm surprised.
Darrien should know.
He knows that right?
You tried to pry information out of me?
- Yes.
You are Jack Hayes?
- In all my years of taking hostages ... you're by far the most annoying.
I'm sorry.
Go inside.
Hello, computerman. Why you busy but ten keys when you phoned your wife?
What are you talking about?
- When she used the phone ... expressed in all ten buttons and then connect. For eleven keys.
You expressed only ten. I count everything.
Why do you do if your wife call you?
You sold the information when the alarm off was one of the criminals.
Then you are greedy and you sold it again.
Double money, double robbery.
Why did you not call your wife.
Should I beat him up?
- Good practice when the police come. , We'll "water boarding".
I saw how to do it on Discovery Channel.
I only need a mop and a pair of pliers.
- Wait a minute.
I have sold the information.
- What?
I've only done once.
And I do not even know to whom.
I have the information faxed.
They gave me cash.
And I did not kill Jack Hayes.
- Says no.
We would already be.
- We need to break into this vault.
It is not. According to the vault specifications would be two inches thick.
That is much thicker.
How long does it take to burn through them?
- I do not know. Two hours?
Are all your chores so bad?
Should I worry if there is enough gasoline in the van is?
Look at me. We have cracked the timeslot.
We need you no longer need.
You threaten me, little bald Jew?
Jews have more small bald for humanity done more than anyone else. Flicker is on.
We will not do crazy things.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Relax.
It never stops.
3000 years we pick that shit already
I know.
I am not an accountant or a comedy writer ... or something very Jewish.
I am a bank robber.
Do you know how many Jews there are bank robbers?
- Not much.
Not very much. Even in this environment they see only bagels and schmear ... and Goldman Sachs.
We link or by fires.
It just takes a little longer.
I do not know, D.
We always said we would stop if the information is incorrect.
That safe specifications are incorrect,
We are behind schedule ... and then that idiot still Lancelot.
Hilbilly two in the hallway with weapons play and explosives.
They have seen our faces.
Ten years ago we were stopped.
Ten years ago there was no recession.
In a few years we have 40.
That's 80 years in criminal.
I'd already be inside.
I need the money more than ever.
My little girl has just one bracket.
That Invisalign.
Not that cheap ceramics.
And they call us criminals.
We had to be dentist.
We had to be dentist.
- Actually it orthodontist.
Keep the hostages away, I start to the link. It's us succeed.
It always works.
We stop the door from the C4 ... and blowing out the door.
- Like an open beer can.
You are the dumbest bank robbers
I have ever seen.
You have my ear 15 minutes ago shot off ...
So sorry, your comment goes one ear and in my other out again.
What?
- You only have one ear.
That is a saying.
Are you doing with him?
They can not come between us.
They're trying to lower in rank.
You Muppets have ranks?
- Absolutely.
We've put you down.
- Want to bet?
Go ahead.
- Come on it.
That ranks them on the web.
- Are you still in Riverside?
We are the Internet thundered.
Has that ever happened you?
No, I've never the Internet thundered.
I have mixed feelings about this whole experience.
You see more clues?
- No, I have to get closer.
Do you have ADHD or something?
- No.
'm Not going on the defensive.
We all have stuff.
I take no coincidence Sanax.
- Why do you Sanax?
I do not know.
Nerves before the wedding I think.
Max is not true for you.
- Yeah, that must be it.
What you swallow?
- What I do not swallow.
Illegal or prescription?
- All prescription.
Illegal junk I do not trust.
Where you take it for?
Well, then you tell me.
It turns the TV off.
- Interesting.
Would you tell?
- How do I explain that?
I've seen hundreds of doctors.
They have hundreds of diagnoses.
Not that I'm crazy, but it's like ...
There are a lot of TVs and they are
All other station ... a normal person ... concentrate on one, I take it all at once to me.
Can you expand?
- No.
I wish I could.
I've tried everything.
Switch channels?
- No.
Tricky.
- Yes.
You know what they say.
Normal but the kitchen sink and washing machine.
A fool would say, not a normal person.
This is the list of the FBI for most wanted bank robbers.
Number one, Vicellous Drum.
He's overrated.
I do not know.
He was never caught.
The most stolen.
The largest ratio.
Jobs are running smoothly.
Like fat people who run to the buffet.
Look at the Baltimore job.
20 people dead. That's pretty excessive.
He takes it into millions.
Number two is Mick Nylon and his gang.
Number three, Alexis Black.
She is good for a girl.
And Darrien and Weinstein at 12.
They have been doing it 15 years.
They have much more recognition than I am.
I am.
68 place as a bank robber.
But if four cybercriminal.
Now I can say ...
My ear is shot off the fourth cyber criminals in the country.
Will you be shooting my finger?
Hit me just now?
Where are we?
Number 674?
They have probably ...
Excluding the international job.
We had a Kwik-Fit robberies in Winnipeg.
Who is here.
You have been arrested in Sagamore ... when your car broke down.
We had blown the engine.
- Once you have raided a Kwik-Fit?
So ironic it's not for us.
I have broken their chains.
They're going to murder me.
You can still state witness, then enter the prison.
Should I feel better?
The tank is not so bad.
There are not many gay men.
For you maybe.
You do look delicious.
Disgusting.
Come and help.
They have already learned that you the detector are?
Come on.
Come on.
Get out.
Gates, you rule the toilet breaks even.
I gotta give this guy some Rennies.
Sorry, guys.
See you later.
We put the things on edge.
Tonight it will happen.
You need the latest bloated.
You have also taken one for the team, with your ears and stuff.
I have an idea.
Can we borrow one of the hostages?
Half of us anyway.
- You want to choose?
All.
I take that beauty.
- They are all beautiful.
I take that cue and mustache Remans.
That black chick, that creep, gay and who goes with you.
What?
- I must go to the bathroom.
Should you piss again?
Is there something wrong with your pecker?
- I have some kind of problem.
Then go ahead.
In connection with the team spirit we welcome ...
- Mistic Lightning.
Not Mystic Lightning.
I hate that name.
"Ties" is cool? Who are blind tunnel.
Rodents living on garbage and excrement.
These are not inspiring animals.
You should choose Peanut Butter and Jelly.
I choose this.
For our first activity ...
We need a very special tie ... that, if possible, can read Chinese.
For some totally harmless explosives for us to explode.
So if you ask, we get not volunteer.
What?
- I can see Jack Hayes.
See?
He's dead. You can do nothing for him.
- You love me.
I'm not crazy about you.
- I have heard no gunshot.
How will Max react to this?
You mutilate yourself. I do not care.
Get out.
I'm not gay.
- Now is the time for it.
This must happen.
You put the primer in the C4.
You run to a safe place ... and I push in the igniter.
This is really happening.
Igniter in the C4.
A gigantic explosion.
You will be thrown by the bank, and we find you than in the rubble.
Success.
Go ahead.
He is not the smartest.
- No.
New rules now we only rob people.
This is absurd.
Of course they are locked.
Why this man hates us?
I found a few pennies.
Pennies.
The dumbest currency on the planet.
It looks a bit better.
I just found some pennies.
That way.
Drop the gun.
You heard him. Drop it.
- Put the gun down.
Put that gun down.
Put it down.
Drop the gun.
Now let the gun fall.
- What is it?
Drop the gun.
- It? Who was with him.
The origin of the gun
I'm not interested.
Put it on the ground.
You're kidding.
We are the youngest team here ...
We want you to your guns us, if we focus on your gun.
This is an FBI gun?
- FBI? That's interesting.
FBI agent tried this bank also to rob?
Or someone he studied?
There are at least five wanted criminals. - What is happening here?
Got it?
- No.
I have that missing piece found in your ear.
If anything you, I care for you.
Peanut Butter and Jelly were to the front door.
Darrien and Gates came down the stairs.
Bullets flew from north to south.
Blood splattered from east to west.
We were stuck in the crossfire.
North, south.
Darrien and Gates took the wrong exit.
Peanut Butter and Jelly too.
The FBI came, Jack Hayes was the pipe.
Only two people had it so shoot. Mitchell, the computer guy.
He was unarmed.
If you omit this option ... there is only one other possibility.
The killer must ...
Be Weinstein.
They each shot.
No, he can not be faster than Weinstein.
Where does he get a gun and a silencer from?
Weinstein was furious because the computer guy two parties invited.
And that computer guy is furious because
Weinstein that FBI guy killed.
They confront each other, pulling their guns and go both dead.
Why Weinstein confront him?
Why would an FBI guy Weinstein murder in the middle of a bank robbery?
That asshole surprise.
- The computer guy has two bullets in it.
Maybe someone, someone else surprise in a different way.
If it was not a confrontation, if they were friends?
Watch what you say, when you talk about my friend.
He would never betray me.
We have been together 15 years.
That means something in this kind of work.
There people had access to the kitchen,
Peanut Butter and Jelly where only ... and you, Gates had access to the kitchen.
- And the hostages up in the attic.
Crawling up the hostages are now in the attic around?
- This job is over.
Wait here.
Darrien, listen.
That's odd.
What do we do now?
I have nothing.
I'm just this piece of ear ... in the freezer.
- I swear ... if you're a woman,
I would marry you.
I am not.
You go with me down.
Where's the remote?
We need them to get out of this.
A few more corpses.
We change the plan.
Therefore let this job go.
- You know what they say about plans?
If you want God to laugh, tell him all about your plans.
Believe me, who is himself there are broken laugh.
Nothing in this rotten bank goes according to plan.
Where's the remote?
- Weinstein him.
What has he left?
- I do not know.
Take it easy and listen to me.
We had to go away long ago.
It's over. - We have needed to break the link.
I need to get away.
I want to stay here and rob that bank.
- The bank job is fucked up.
You and me on a desert island, drinking, lots of chicks ...
Think about it.
The boat is gone, only the engine is still there.
This affects your common sense.
I thought you had balls.
You're a disgrace to the black criminals.
Tonight was a fucking mess.
But not anymore.
There's only one gang robbers.
Three of us.
Mystic Lightning Can we be?
- No, you're Muppet.
No excuse, no more favors, no gentle treatment.
It is now for real.
Because there is only one army,
There is even a general.
I am the General.
I have complete control.
Nothing happens without my say so.
Bring the hostages out of the office.
Hurry.
- You heard him.
Do you have thermal lance disabled?
You do not appear?
- No.
What's next?
We begin with the vault ... or murder us all hostages?
- Definitely the vault.
Hostages may be useful.
You can use them as human shields ... things they can get you.
As the money from the bank. Or snacks.
We start with the safe.
On one condition ... if the time has come to do it,
I do it alone.
That should not be a problem.
We are not like the mass murders.
If you are in being so, is not a problem for us.
Come on then.
This is so much better than first class flying, drinking champagne and ... and go to my wedding.
- If you can walk out the bank with the money ...
Max would you still need?
- You must let go.
I can not let go.
I'm obsessive.
If you had the money,
Max would still be?
He holds the door open for you?
He hugs you at night?
I do not like to cuddle? - Is he the weekend to Mom and Dad?
My mother loves him. - Everyone says you can not buy happiness with money.
Nobody really believes that.
Your tenacity is touching.
As I exit I go back to Max.
I continue with this for five hours.
- No, I'm saying.
The thermal lance is blown, so we use the c4 for the link.
We are all to the controlled explosion.
That would be something different.
I want you to know that I am not use your explosives.
We know.
Go look at it.
No unexpected things,
No dynamite ... or apache helicopters and no nuclear weapons.
- Now go and see.
Whoever it is, shoot them.
Why he always throws scissors?
Why, Jelly.
Why?
Do not throw scissors, but with stones.
Is there anyone?
I know you're there.
I will not shoot you, Tripp.
I just want the bank but robberies.
I do not know what happens.
- With the raid?
Yes, with the raid and everything.
I would now be the happiest guy world should be.
I have a great job, working with my best friend. The hours are ideal.
We have never been on people having to shoot.
We've never seen anyone need to murder.
It's strange to all those things against a photocopier to say.
I will not be negative.
I'm just saying ...
Maybe I'm not good at bank clerk.
Perhaps Jesus has me here not put on earth.
My grandfather sold illegal liquor.
My father was a sex offender.
Criminals is in my blood.
Between you and me, it was always my dream been to work at a water park.
I hear you.
For what it's worth, I find a great bank robber.
Are you serious?
You say no, because I have a gun
I focused on your dick?
Nothing that went wrong is your fault.
You are sabotaged.
Take it easy.
I let you see something.
Where did you get that?
Which I took from your suitcase stolen.
Look, even if each transmitter suffer from interference.
The ignition should work.
No.
Who has changed?
Leader, are you okay?
- Who is your leader?
I must not tell you.
- Who has it changed, to murder you.
It's like leader, or Peanut Butter.
Peanut Butter is a brother to me.
Peanut Butter and I are like best gay friends in a bathtub.
We are so close.
A lot of money in the bank.
You need it from different angles.
He knew from the freezer, even though we not been in that kitchen.
Let me tackle it was in the kitchen.
Who is your leader?
You can trust me.
Who is your leader?
Here.
Take a look.
Vicellous Drum.
We have never met him.
The text is clear, the information is correct.
Never has our face. Just a fax.
Is that normal? Receive a fax?
- You thought surely emails?
The police pull these things after.
They store about anti-fax technology.
Everyone loves the comedians the hard copy.
I do not want to scare you.
Do you think there is something the conspiracy theory?
I want to wipe out anyone's character ...
I have Rex as he caught the vault the measure was.
I asked what he was doing, and then he said ... that he was watching and lots of space was for the new foreign currency.
What weird.
He would know if the system was flat.
He would have known.
He has repeatedly told us that he an expert in the bank robbery procedures.
You're right.
- It's so crazy.
That is so.
Has anyone seen my insulin injection?
Grab a chair.
Does anyone have sugar?
- I do not candy.
Hold his head.
Fire!
Fire!
Where?
- The man ...
Glucose is necessary or he dies and I get it anyway. Come on.
All right.
Where's the fire?
You often work with Vicellous Drum guy?
- Yes.
We were once decoys for 'm.
We had from him a bench robbery while he 's safe in the big city did.
It was unfortunate that no money was, out of 80 Canadian dollars.
Mr. Blythe's got low sugar.
We should seek immediate glucose.
Where's my gun?
Look over the edge.
As we crossed into the cell.
Wait, have you ever been?
And you monitor his bank?
Yes, I have some omission on my resume.
What have you been?
- Bank Heist.
And other offenses.
I have often done to mail fraud.
They were not big banks.
- How much?
A few. Thousand.
- My God.
Take it easy.
I am rehabilitated and stuff.
Are you single?
I think it is.
He must wake up normally, right?
He starts to open his eyes.
He's a tough old man.
Would you sit up?
- Ready?
I close the doors for the last time. Clear?
Is that clear, assholes?
I do not like that word.
- What did you just say?
I hate the K-word.
Say that again and I cut you ...
- I said I hate the K-word ... and use in America we never!
The Australians are damn.
He has the same gun as you.
- That's my weapon.
This is what you need fixed?
- What is the hell?
That is our way.
What do you want? Part?
- We talk outside.
Hands behind your head.
Out.
Calmly.
- Maniac.
You've made your point.
- Why?
Unless you have something to be negotiate, say.
Weinstein was our informant.
I have never met our leader.
How have you contacted?
- That I will not say.
Would you leave?
Answer to my question.
Look, we have only this fax.
I switch on the remote.
Calmly.
- Get up.
Give me the remote.
Now give me the damn gun.
- It's Jelly his weapon.
It was from his mother.
Is it 's weapon of your mother?
I give it to you.
I'm sorry.
You lose that damn gun now?
- No.
Are you fucking crazy?
You lose your gun privileges.
Forwards.
Jesus. And you.
I do not want to hear from you.
One word, and you're dead.
Go back.
- Thanks.
Back to work.
My god.
- What was that about?
I like the remote exchanged with this fax.
And that 's good deal?
- No idea.
That's why I kept the battery with me.
Mr. Blythe told me he saw Rex the vault of the measurement was.
I have seen.
Where is the Swiss girl?
The Swiss maid is not there.
- It happens.
What then?
Faxes, the night vision?
- What are you talking about?
Five, six ...
- Stop counting.
Tripp, stop!
What?
- Why did you do that?
Because you might as bright ...
- No, it does not work!
For God's sake.
- I think of a thousand things.
And now I have the kiss think. Are you serious?
My God! My brain will explode.
He's crazy, but has talent.
Indeed, he is a criminal genius.
We are blessed.
- Can we help?
A soft drink without sugar?
Go somewhere else.
One more hour.
We will make it.
The only people murdered criminals are provisional.
They can kill themselves.
We are heroic survivors, as I call it.
Starting tomorrow, everyone one week vacation.
I have next week Fri
- Then we'll have "a week business.
We're not safe.
- You want me just do not agree.
No.
What's in her bra?
- I take it well.
Wait.
Do it.
- This is disgusting.
Forward, pull it out.
She works in a Swiss bank?
What a waste.
It is especially sad like a nice girl dies.
If an ugly girl dies was their life sucks anyway.
But if a nice girl dies is it really 's tragedy.
Indeed. Nice girls are unicorns and gnomes.
Rare and valuable.
They must be protected.
My god.
- What?
This is not a bank robbery.
This is not a bank robbery!
You're fucking dead.
Hakuna Matata, asshole.
Listen, and I give you back primer.
Well.
These are the two faxes to you these bank robberies.
This is the fax to the Swiss girl.
They are different ... except that they are each 81 mm have a blank line.
The printer had a scratch.
- I do not understand.
Neither do I.
- Printed by the same device?
By the same person.
- Who?
Vicellous Drum.
- Who is that?
The number one criminal mastermind.
Those clever bastards.
This is an organized trap.
Vicellous Drum has a problem.
He goes' n lots of people killed associated with him are ... but it may not seem that he is behind it.
Each of us is connected with the criminal?
Yes. Let me explain.
If this is true, the FBI agent searches
Drum for years.
Darrien and Weinstein have already previously worked for Drum.
The Swiss bank representative
Drum money laundering.
Mitchell Woolf is his Drum computer hacker.
Peanut Butter and Jelly have him working as decoys.
They may be able to reveal all.
And all the rest, who knows ...
Perhaps Mr. Blythe met Drum alone, making him angry.
He was offended. Maybe flirt Mr Clean with him in a prison shower.
A blowjob in prison he does not survive.
Perhaps we are here by mistake.
Collateral damage.
- You're kidding.
Hoping that we kill each other?
This is sloppy, especially for Drum.
That's why he is here, personally.
Come on.
- Think about it. The thermal lance.
The explosives went off at the exact time.
The FBI agent was the largest
Drum threat.
He left Weinstein him first kill.
Yes, Weinstein worked for Drum from the beginning.
Like Mitchell, who knew ceded as security.
Drum and then killed them.
Drum had the best possible in a double murder seems ... but the remote Weinstein his mouth was very suspicious.
I guess Weinstein him in his mouth was blocked ... to avoid the real killer,
Vicellous Drum, the bank could escape.
Then inactivated by Darrien Drum.
And then shot Drum
Swiss girl dead.
Five dead, eight to go.
What a fucking bullshit.
Nice story.
It's not open.
The money is yours to fly paper here to lure and kill you.
There is no money.
- Of course there is money. Shut up.
Really, we've been working too hard.
- This is not a bank robbery.
Damn.
This is the best bank robbery ever.
- You said there was no money, eh?
It's just fly paper.
- Yeah, I guess.
Jeez.
My god ...
So it does not matter that the money is here,
Drum because everyone is dead?
We love to 't be.
I do not know who of you
Drum is ... but keep me away.
Grab a gun?
- No, it does not matter.
Drum his plan was always to everyone murder. We must be smarter than him.
How to kill so many armed people?
Lights, night viewers, and kill everyone.
Why do I get there not?
- You said something about night vision.
In the bathroom there is one.
- What more do you need then?
Which man will get night vision goggles,
Drum's.
Or any woman.
How do we get it all in there?
How much do you think this is?
- Four or five million.
Let us begin.
Really? Now go save the Bank?
- No, I want with you.
There is "one damn killer.
I'm going too.
- Me too.
Do not forget me.
- We are all here.
Let each other holding hands.
Seriously. You never get away.
Do not say Amen to that sort of thing.
You will frighten Jelly.
Tripp is actually right.
That remote has no battery.
Are you kidding?
What bastard has the battery?
Vicellous Drum.
You took the battery to us here to keep.
No.
- You wander through the bank.
You could at any time someone have slain. The perfect crime ... you solve yourself.
Unbelievable that I kissed.
You should not take a genius to to come under your skirts.
Flatter yourself that you would get this far.
If the rest of you idiots had
Attention, did you realize ... that all the evidence point to Madge.
Not true.
Who turned out the light?
- Come on. Not again.
Shoot everything that moves.
Where is he?
- We 't seen.
Come out.
Forwards.
I'm not Vicellous Drum.
I took the lights off because I knew that the real viewer would drum the night out.
Then I went to the bathroom and I waited.
A bank manager a golden heart.
Everyone is surprised when they hear it's you.
You think?
Those clowns in the lobby thinking that you're Vicellous Drum.
They will kill you, so they are more a hero like.
If you kill me, you seem even more Drum.
So, you're lapping anyway.
A very entertaining story, but nobody believes it.
Come on out.
Enough lies, it's game over.
Not so fast.
Tripp and I have run into you.
We knew that when the lights would go out, that the offender would go to night vision.
You can kill all of us, right?
No.
Every one million U.S. dollars.
Undetectable.
All.
Two million.
Put the weapon down.
Put it down and we talk.
Damn.
And then there were about six.
Thank you, guest.
That solves it in me.
Take 't. It is insured.
Blessed new appointment.
Thank you, Badger.
I say one more thing:
From now on, Jelly and I do not more criminals.
That's right.
I almost forgot my ear.
And ultimately, Peanut Butter
Jelly and with the money going to run?
Crazy, huh?
They went to Winnipeg or something.
Thank you.
You may go.
Close everything.
- Your medication, sir.
I take everything.
I would the word 'hero' is not used.
I led my team of hostages through the darkest time of their lives? Yes.
I want two months paid time off.
I want to wear jeans five days a week.
Not just on Fridays.
And I want lenses in both eyes.
That you must not do.
- No problem.
Thank you.
Please, ma'am.
Congratulations.
Thanks again, officer.
What is this? A toaster?
A controlled boat?
Some people like to get money.
I thought you were never true story.
Then I remembered that
Weinstein said he ... two bank robberies
Tonight was shot ... and then I realized that are basically three robberies.
A pretty good plan.
Kaitlin Nest?
She married the wrong guy.
What a touching story.
You fake fiance, Max ... explains your expensive taste.
It explains your exotic travel and your exorbitant demands.
And you have your wedding gifts walk outside with heaps of money ... no one asks questions.
You did you make a move about seven hours when the security went out ... but Derrien, Drum and everything else ruined your plan.
But you waited for it right now.
And when I turned off the lights,
You did your move.
Take 't. It is insured.
It's really brilliant.
Nobody goes to the wedding present of a woman opening ... and the policemen carry the still in the trunk of your car.
I honestly love you.
Is that too early?
What do you want?
- I want to join.
Is that so?
- Equal partners. No violence.
Why should I not murder?
- You are not murderous.
I feel like me.
- You think?
Yes, it's fun.
We are a great team.
What do you think?
Are you going to freak out?
- What do you mean?
The last time I kissed you,
You freaked out. That was pretty sad.
What is your real name?
- Alexis Black, No. 3 in banks.
That's so ...fuckin hot!
Get Charlie.
Dr. Holloway!
Charlie!
What?
Come quick!
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...
...years. Maybe older.
You gotta be kidding me. lt's the same configuration. l mean, it's gotta predate the others by millennia. l think they want us to come and find them.
Yeah.
What happened to that man?
He died.
Why aren't you helping them?
They don't want my help.
Their God is different than ours.
Why did he die?
Because sooner or later, everyone does.
Like Mummy?
Like Mummy.
Where do they go?
Everyone has their own word.
Heaven.
Paradise.
Whatever it's called, it's someplace beautiful.
How do you know it's beautiful?
That's what l choose to believe.
What do you believe, Ellie?
Good morning, David.
Transmitting message.
No response.
Whilst this articulation...
...is attested in the lndo-European descendants...
...as a purely paralinguistic form...
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back...
...five millennia or more.
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.
Repeat after me.
Perfect.
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes?
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.
You do that once too often. lt's only flesh and blood!
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.
And you're barmy.
- lt damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.
Well, what's the trick, then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
The trick, William Potter...
...is not minding that it hurts.
The trick, William Potter...
...is not minding that it hurts.

Attention: Destination threshold.
Robe.
How long?
Two years, four months, 18 days...
...36 hours, 15 minutes.
Any casualties?
Casualties, ma'am?
Has anyone died?
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.
Well, then wake them up.
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.
My name is David.
Your mind and body are in a state of shock...
...as a result of the stasis. lt's all right. Perfectly normal.
Ellie.
We're here, baby.
There, there.
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Hydration aids muscle mass.
All crew, consume shakes with high caloric content.
What the hell is that? lt's Christmas.
We need the holidays...
...to show time is still moving.
Mission briefing...
...is about to start, captain.
Might wanna make your way down.
Well, l haven't had any breakfast yet. ls this seat taken?
Hi, l'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.
Okay.
Look, no offense, but...
...l've been asleep two years. l ain't here to be your friend. l'm here to make money.
You got that?
Okay. l bet a hundred credits it's a terraforming survey.
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us. lt's a corporate run, they're not telling us shit.
Come on.
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.
You look nervous, El.
- l'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- l know you will.
Good morning.
For those of you l hired personally...
...it's nice to see you again.
For the rest of you, l am Meredith Vickers. lt's my job to make sure you do yours.
Okay, then. On with the show.
Weyland Corporation.
Building better worlds.
Hello, friends.
My name is Peter Weyland. l am your employer. l am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...
...you have reached your destination.
And l am long dead.
May l rest in peace.
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.
And he is the closest thing to a son l will ever have.
Unfortunately, he is not human.
He will never grow old...
...and he will never die.
And yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts...
...for that would require the one thing that David will never have.
A soul. l have spent my entire...
...lifetime contemplating the questions:
Where do we come from?
What is our purpose?
What happens when we die?
And l have found two people who convinced me they're on the verge of answering them.
Drs. Holloway and Shaw, if you would please stand.
As far as you're concerned, they're in charge.
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give mankind equal footing with the gods...
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.
Well, my friends, the time has finally come for his return.
Doctors, please.
The floor is yours.
Okay, wow.
All right. l never had to follow a ghost before.
Okay, let me show you why you guys...
...are here.
These are images of archeological digs from all over the Earth.
That's...
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.
That's Hawaiian there at the end, then Mesopotamian.
Now, this one here is our most recent discovery. lt's a 35,000-year-old cave painting from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.
They shared no contact with one another, and yet....
The same pictogram...
...showing men worshipping giant beings, pointing to the stars...
...was discovered at every last one of them.
And the only galactic system that matched...
...was so far from Earth that there's no way...
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations could have possibly known about it.
But itjust so happens...
...that that system...
...has a sun...
...a lot like ours.
And, based on our long-range scans, there seemed to be a planet.
Just one planet with a moon...
...capable of sustaining life.
And we arrived there this morning.
So you're saying we're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?
- No.
- Yeah.
No. Not a map, an invitation.
From who?
We call them Engineers.
Engineers?
Do you mind...
...telling us what they engineered?
They engineered us.
Bullshit.
Okay, so do you...
...have anything to back that up?
Look, if you're willing to discount...
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....
But how do you know? l don't.
But it's what l choose to believe.
Doctors.
Miss Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins.
Wow, nice place. lt's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support.
Air, food.
Anything Miss Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment.
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.
Yes. l do. l like to minimize risk.
David, why don't you make the doctors a drink? l'll take a vodka. Up.
Charlie, look. lt's a Pauling Med-Pod.
They only made a dozen of these.
Miss Shaw.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.
Please don't touch that. lt's a very expensive piece of machinery. lt does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?
There might be some confusion about our relationship.
Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission.
But l'm fairly certain your Engineers are scribblings...
...of savages living in dirty little caves.
But let's say l'm wrong, and you do find these beings down there...
...you won't engage them...
...you won't talk to them.
You will do nothing but report back to me.
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...
...you're not telling us about?
My company...
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place and bring you.
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.
But you didn't.
And that makes you an employee.
But if we can't make contact...
...why did you even bring us here?
Weyland was a superstitious man.
He wanted a true believer onboard.
Cheers.
So no response? l'm sorry, no.
Maybe they didn't understand it.
How are your lessons going, David? l spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages...
...to their roots. l'm confident...
...l can communicate with them...
...provided your thesis is correct.
"Provided it's correct." That's good.
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.
What are you smiling about?
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.
Descent trajectory mapped.
How we doing?
Great.
All right, boss.
All personnel...
...this is the captain.
Brace for entry.
Yes, captain.
That means you too, Vickers.
All systems...
...online.
What is the atmosphere?
Atmosphere is...
...71 percent nitrogen...
...21 percent oxygen...
...traces of argon gas.
Whoa, now, that's weather.
Just like home. lf you're breathing through an exhaust pipe.
CO2 is over 3 percent.
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.
Peak portside.
Whoa, 52,000! lt makes Everest look like a baby brother.
All right, take us around.
We'll use that as our point of entry.
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...
...a couple of hard spots.
Could be metal.
No radio, no heat source.
Nobody's home.
There is nothing in the desert...
...and no man needs nothing.
What was that?
Just something from a film l like.
Let's go through that gateway.
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.
Going through. Nice and slow.
Keep it steady, boys.
There.
No, what are you doing?
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?
Right there. God does not build in...
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...
...could you put us down there? l wouldn't be any good if l couldn't do that.
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.
Engage landing sequence.
Switch to manual.
- Commence landing.
- Easy.
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.
Bringing her down in five.
- Preparing RCS thrusters.
- Four.
Two. Easy does it.
Generator systems are inactive.
Temperature is at 2.724 K.
Captain, would you...
...tell the survey team to suit up...
...and meet us in the airlock.
Only six hours left of daylight.
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no. lt's Christmas, captain...
...and l want to open my presents.
You, boy.
You're coming with us. l'd be delighted.
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.
Hey, Jackson...
...what's that for?
Expedition security.
My job is to make sure everybody is nice and safe.
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.
All right, then.
Good luck with that.
David, why are you wearing a suit, man? l beg your pardon?
You don't breathe, remember?
So why wear a suit? l was designed like this...
...because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind. lf l didn't wear the suit, it would defeat the purpose.
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?
Not too close, l hope.
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.
Ramp will open in five...
...four, three, two, one.
Hey.
This is just one small step for mankind.
Seriously?
You ready to do this? l know you are.
Hey, Fifield. l want a spectrograph on this. l want to know if it's natural or if somebody put it there. l can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what l can...
...tell you is, it's hollow.
Prometheus, are you seeing this?
Affirmative.
We see it.
Okay, ready?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- After you.
- After you.
Okay.
Careful.
Prometheus, we're going in.
Copy that.
What's back here?
Some kind of a corridor?
Mr. Fifield, let's get a grid of the structure. l want the whole interior. lf there's anything in here worth looking at...
...these pups'll find them.
"Pups"?
Yeah, pups. My pups.
Prometheus, we are now mapping.
Copy that.
Well, l'll be damned.
Fifield, you got a read?
Yeah.
Pups are saying this way.
Look at this.
Oh, Charlie.
Jesus.
The sunlight is heating the water.
Check out the humidity.
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.
Outside...
...it's completely toxic, and in here...
...there's nothing. lt's breathable.
What are you doing?
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.
There's something generating an atmosphere.
David?
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...
...actually.
They were terraforming.
Please don't do-- l'm not wearing this thing anymore.
Wish me luck, baby.
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.
You crazy bastard.
Connect our suit cameras...
...if you want to continue watching this freak show. We are taking our helmets off.
Copy that. Switching feeds.
Well, come on. Pay up.
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?
Something is manufacturing breathable air down there. That, mate...
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here. lf you said a dead old man wanted to talk to Martians, l'd pay.
Come on, a hundred credits.
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that? lt's minus 12 in here.
So why is this water not frozen?
Maybe it ain't water.
Maybe it's Martian piss.
That's your scientific theory? ls it? Mr. Biology?
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.
Some kind of sediment, perhaps. lmpressive.
What was that?
David?
David?
What is that?
David?
Ellie!
What was that? l'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?
Keep up!
Come on!
Where did he go?
Wait, wait, wait.
There it is. There it is. There it is.
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.
What do you mean "them"? lt is them, Ellie. lt looks like a door...
...and he's been decapitated by it.
Son of a bitch.
They were right.
What did you want them to be? Wrong?
David...
...please tell me you can read that.
Perhaps.
No, l'm out of here.
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?
What?
Look, l'm just a geologist. l like rocks. l love rocks!
Now it's clear you two don't give a shit about rocks.
But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead...
...bodies.
As l don't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic...
...dead body arena...
...l want to go back to the ship, if you don't mind.
Anyone wanna...
...join me, hey? You staying?
No, ship's good.
Yeah. Ship very good.
Congratulations on meeting your maker.
Thank you.
Pull yourself...
...together, man.
And l thought you were the crazy one.
Do you have the carbon reader?
Thank you.
How long's it been dead?
Two thousand years...
...give or take.
What are you doing, David? l'm attempting to open the door.
Wait. We don't know what's on the other side.
Oops. Sorry.
Look, Ford. lt's the head.
An amazing state of preservation.
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.
Remarkably human.
Beautiful painting. lt's a mural.
Stop.
Stop. Don't touch it.
Sorry.
Please, don't touch anything.
Sweating.
Organic.
Oh, no.
Charlie, the murals are changing. l think we've affected the atmosphere in the room.
Charlie, do you copy?
Oh, the head!
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!
- Boss.
- What you got?
We got an incoming storm front.
Silica...
...and lots of static. This is not good. l see it.
Ground crew...
...this is Janek. l need you to hustle back right now.
Ground crew, do you copy me? l got 200-kilometer...
...winds of airborne silica...
...and enough static to fry your suit.
Copy that, sir.
We need more time. l'll be closing the outer...
...doors in 15 minutes. l sincerely hope you can make it.
Charlie! David!
We must leave now.
This is just another tomb.
David!
- On three.
- Two, three, up.
Let's go!
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.
David, we are leaving!
Come on!
Damn it, they've already taken off.
Come on, let's go.
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.
All right, come on. Let's go.
Go faster!
Charlie! The head!
Ellie, no!
What are you doing?
Hatch closure...
- ...in five seconds.
- Shit.
Damn it, hold on!
Goddamn it.
Door closing.
Ellie, don't move!
Charlie!
Grab my hand!
No!
No, Ellie!
Ellie!
Got it.
So, what was that, Ellie?
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...
...almost killing yourself!
Are you all right?
Yes.
Thank you, David.
My pleasure.
Doctors, it's real good to have...
...you back, but where's Millburn and Fifield?
Aren't they back yet?
- Get them up for me.
- All right.
We've been here before, Fifield. l don't know. lt all looks the same to me.
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.
Between the static electricity and the wind speed...
...well, there ain't no safe way to come get you.
What?
The temperature is dropping rapidly, so get your helmets on and stay warm...
...until the storm passes.
Captain...
...can you get a message to the scientist and his zealot girlfriend?
You got a pen nearby?
No. No, l think we got it.
Tell them l said... themselves.
Copy?
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...
...and we'll come get you in the morning.
Well, which way now?
All right.
Well, which way, huh?
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.
David.
So are they all dead?
What? Who?
Your Engineers.
Are they all dead or aren't they? l don't know.
We just got here.
Scan.
Do you care if they're dead?
Weyland cared.
Dr. Shaw.
Have a look at this.
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No. l think it's a helmet.
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...
...be able to prize this open. lt's too heavy for us. David?
Careful.
Like so.
What is that on its head? lt looks like new cells.
- ln a state of....
- Change.
Yes.
Changing into what?
Can you run a stem line into the locus coeruleus? l think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it's still alive.
- Thirty amps.
- Okay.
No more.
Let me make an incision.
Okay.
Go up, 40.
Okay, 40 up.
Did you see that?
- Yes.
- Yep. See?
Go up another 10.
Okay, up 10.
Maybe it's a little...
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.
Okay, l'm trying. l'm trying, it's not going down.
Full down. Ford...
...stop it.
Oh, God.
David, contain it! Now!
Contain it? Turn it off!
Oh, God. The smell!
Oh, God, look at that.
Look at that. lt's getting worse.
Mortal, after all.
Ford, take a sample.
Let's have a look.
No, sir, l will take care of it.
Yes, sir, understood. l'm sorry.
Fortunately, slightly premature.
Of course, sir.
Miss Vickers.
What did he say, David? l don't think he'd want me to tell you.
What did he say? l'm sorry...
...that's confidential.
So help me God...
...l will find the cord that makes you run and l will cut it.
What did he say?
He said:
"Try harder."
Cup of tea, ma'am?
Genetic view.
Okay.
Let's have a look at its DNA. lsolate the strand.
Okay.
Compare it to the gene sample?
Yeah.
Overlay.
Processing.
Processing.
DNA match.
Oh, my God. lt's us. lt's everything.
What killed them?
Big things...
...have small beginnings.
Am l interrupting? l thought you might be running low.
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but l'm afraid...
...it would be wasted on me.
Right, l almost forgot you're not a real boy. l'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone.
You think we wasted our time coming here, don't you?
Your question depends on me understanding what you hoped to achieve by coming here.
What we hoped to achieve was to meet our makers.
To get answers.
Why they even...
...made us in the first place.
Why do you think your people made me?
Because we could.
Can you imagine how disappointing it would be...
...to hear the same thing from your creator? l guess it's...
...good you can't be disappointed.
Yes. lt's wonderful...
...actually.
May l ask you something?
Please do.
How far would you go...
...to get what you came all this way for?
Your answers.
What are you willing to do?
Anything and everything.
That's worth drinking to, l'd imagine.
Here's mud in your eye, pal.
Good health. lt's those things.
Are they real?
Of course they're real.
Jesus Christ. l mean....
Look at the pile.
Look how high up they are. lt looks like...
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?
Man, this thing is opened up from the inside.
Almost like it exploded.
Looks like a scene out some sort of holocaust painting, you know?
Well....
So, whatever killed them is long gone, right?
Millburn, Fifield.
This is Prometheus.
What is your position?
Prometheus, this is Millburn.
We are at 7-4-0...
...1-4-7-7. Why?
Just got a ping about one click west of you.
What do you mean "a ping"?
Well, whatever...
...that probe is picking up...
...it's not dead. lt's reading a life form.
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"? ls it--? ls it moving?
No, l don't think so.
Captain, you're...
...obviously not seeing...
...what we're seeing here.
If you were, you wouldn't be talking about a ping. l know, boys.
Your signal has been coming in sporadically since the storm hit.
That's no good to us down here! ls it--? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.
Must be a glitch.
What do you mean, "a glitch"?
All right, boys.
Sleep tight.
Try not to bugger each other.
Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.
Now, he said--
- He said one click west, yeah?
- Yeah.
Now, we....
We don't want to check that out, do we?
Shit, no.
Where are we gonna go?
East.
Yeah, east.
A fucking glitch, man.
"Pings, glitch, life form." What the fuck?
Based on the behavior of the subject in these holographic recordings...
...we're attempting to identify what caused the head...
...to combust. l can't help but wonder...
...was there an outbreak here?
You rang...
- ...ma'am?
- l have something important...
...to tell you. What is that?
This is...
...a rose that l had frozen with the champagne. l was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for.
We did find what we came for.
They were here. This is--
The most significant discovery in the history...
...of mankind. Oh, l know. lt's incredible, it really is.
But l wanted to talk to them. l mean, don't you want to know why they came?
Why they abandoned us? l just want answers, baby.
We were right, Charlie. l have proof.
Look.
Their genetic material predates ours.
We come from them.
- You're kidding me.
- No.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. l guess you can take your father's cross off now.
Why would l want to do that?
Because they made us.
And who made them?
Well, exactly. We'll never know.
But here's what we do know:
That there is nothing special about the creation of life.
Right? Anybody can do it.
All you need is a dash of DNA and half a brain, right? l can't. l can't create life.
What does that say about me?
Ellie, that's not-- l didn't mean-- l wasn't talking about--
Children?
Us.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Elizabeth Shaw...
...you are the most special person l have ever met in my life...
...and l love you.
Hey.
How much longer will this take? l don't know. l'm just a captain.
That thing sounds like a dying cat, by the way. l'll have you know that this thing...
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.
Am l supposed to know who that is?
You know...
...if you wanna get laid...
...you really don't have to pretend...
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.
You could just say,
"Hey, l'm trying to get laid." l could. l could say that, right?
But it wouldn't make sense...
...why l would fly myself half a billion miles from every man on Earth...
...if l wanted to get laid, would it?
Hey, Vickers.
Hey, Vickers. l was wondering....
Are you a robot?
My room.
Ten minutes.
Well, if you can't be with the one you love
Love the one
You're with
Love the one you're with
Millburn.
What's all this black stuff?
Gazpacho. ls that tobacco? ls that tobacco...
...in your respirator?
Yeah, sure.
Tobacco.
On behalf of scientists everywhere, l am ashamed to count you amongst us...
...Fifield. Really.
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?
You see this thing?
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?
Something they worshiped? What?
- lt kind of looks like--
- What's that?
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God. Okay.
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.
This is okay, l can handle this.
Hey, baby.
Hey.
Come in, Prometheus.
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.
And it's beautiful.
Okay!
Prometheus...
...we have two.
Look at you. Look at you, baby.
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?
You need to stay calm because she is beautiful.
What makes you think that's female?
She's a lady. Look!
Hey.
She's mesmerized.
Come here. Come here. lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.
Hey, baby.
You're strong!
You should...
...help me now.
Get it off.
Cut it here, man! l ain't touching that!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- lt's getting tighter.
- l ain't touching it!
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!
God, you're making it worse! lt's tightening! lt's tight-- lt's breaking my arm!
Shit!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Shit!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! lt's in my suit.
Jesus Christ.
Shaw, you up?
Yeah, what's up?
The storm passed, but l can't reach Millburn...
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down, see if l can rustle them up.
Okay.
Any idea where they are?
Last time they radioed in was where you found your head.
Okay, we're coming.
All right.
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.
All right, boss.
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.
- lt's gotta be in the hardware.
- What glitch, captain?
One of them probes picked up a life form.
Pops up every hour...
...for a couple of seconds and then it's gone. l can find the probe and fix it.
Knock yourself out.
Be careful, doctors.
Fifield!
Millburn?
All right, come on down.
David, are you alone?
Yes, Miss Vickers.
Uplink your feed to my room.
Copy.
You son of a bitch.
You cut me off.
What is this?
- Charlie?
- l just tripped.
Oh, my God, you're sick! l'm okay, baby. Come on.
Fifield?
Millburn?
Hey, Chance. l wouldn't touch...
...that if l were you.
Dr. Shaw?
Yeah?
Do we have any idea what is...
...oozing out of these vases?
No. They weren't like this last time we were here.
Captain?
What?
Who is it? Which one?
- Who is it?
- lt's Millburn.
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.
Ellie, honey.
Charlie, what's wrong? l need you to look at me, okay?
You know infections...
...so, what do you see?
This is not good, baby.
You look at me, you tell me what you see.
Oh, my God.
Ford, get over here. lt's okay. Janek?
- What?
- We have to go now!
What do you see?
Honey, what do you see?
Holloway's sick. He's not good. l see movement...
...in his esophagus.
- Come on, baby.
- No. l'm okay.
Janek!
Come over and help me!
- l'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?
- l'm okay.
- Let's go!
Help me with him. l got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Prometheus...
...come in.
- Watch your head.
- Okay. l'm okay.
- Holloway.
- Get him up.
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in. ls anyone there?
This is Vickers. l need a medical team standing by the airlock.
Full quarantine fail-safe.
Holloway's sick.
Sick with what?
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.
- lt's not safe down here.
- Charlie? l'm suiting up.
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Move!
- What was that back there?
- Let's go, people!
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!
Ellie!
He don't look too good.
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off. l don't know.
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.
Aye, captain.
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.
Come on!
Please!
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?
Vickers, that is an order!
Get that goddamn door open!
- Look at me. lt's too late, l'm sick.
- No, it's not.
Come on!
Ford, help me!
Airlock crew, if you can hear me, it's Janek.
Open that back door right now!
Hold that door!
Prometheus...
...do you copy?
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!
Open it.
What the hell is this?
He's not coming onboard.
Vickers, this is a sick man. l see that. That's why...
...he's not coming on!
Charlie!
Chance, get over here!
Please!
We can still help him!
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship! l won't leave him!
Then stay!
Wait! We could...
...put him on the Med-Pod!
Please don't do this. lt's okay, Ellie.
Vickers!
What are you doing? l love you, baby.
- l love you.
- No. l'm telling you, stay back!
Do it.
Stay back!
No! No, Charlie!
- Do it.
- No!
No!
No!
No!
Charlie!
No!
My deepest condolences. l'm going to have to take this. lt may be contaminated. lf there's a contagion, we were all exposed.
You need-- We need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.
Yes, of course.
Yes? l understand how...
...inappropriate this is...
...given the circumstances.
But as you ordered quarantine fail-safes...
...it's my responsibility to ask.
Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently?
Since you and he were...
...so close...
...l want to be...
...as thorough as poss--
My, my.
You're pregnant.
What?
From the look of it, three months so.
No, that's impossible. l can't be pregnant.
Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway?
Yes...
...but 10 hours ago.
There's no bloody way l'm three months pregnant.
Well, doctor...
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus. l want to see it.
Don't think that's a good idea.
David, l want to see it.
Now, doctor.... l want to see it. l want it out of me.
We don't have the personnel...
...to perform a procedure like that.
- Our best option--
- l want it out.
Put you back into...
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.
Please, get it out of me.
Get it out of me!
Please. lt must be very painful.
Here, let me give you something.
That's it. There, there.
Someone will be along shortly...
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck. lt must feel like your God abandoned you.
What?
To lose...
...Dr. Holloway after your father died under such similar circumstances.
What was it that killed him?
Ebola?
How do you--? How do you know that? l watched your dreams.
Dr. Shaw?
We're here to put you...
...in an anti-contamination suit, take you back to Cryo Deck...
...go to beddy-byes.
Dr. Shaw?
She's doped. Prepare her.
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury. l need a Caesarean.
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...
...patients and does not offer...
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...
...elsewhere.
Surgery.
Abdominal.
Penetrating...
...injuries.
Foreign body. lnitiate.
Surgical procedure to begin.
Running diagnostics.
Oh, come on.
Get it out! Come on!
Please!
Oh, God!
- Come on!
- lnitiating anesthetics.
Please!
Commence surgical procedure.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Come on!
Bridge...
...to hangar. This is the captain.
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what l see?
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.
What? Where?
According to what l'm looking at, it's outside...
...the goddamn ship.
Barnes, open the door!
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.
Fifield?
Wait a second.
Hey, Wallace.
Take a look at this.
Fifield?
What the hell is going on down there? l'm coming down there.
Chance, you're suiting up.
- Come on.
- Don't let it on the ship!
Take him out!
Got him!
Do it!
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.
Come on!
Get in the rover!
We gotta get out of here!
Go!
What is that?
You've been asleep.
You were on the ship all this time. Why?
Well, l.... l have a few days of life left in me. l didn't wanna waste them...
...until you could deliver what you promised.
To meet my maker.
There we are, sir.
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.
One of them is still alive.
We're on our way to see him now.
What?
Turn me around.
You convinced me that...
...if these things made us...
...then surely they could save us.
My stick, please.
Well, save me, anyway.
Save you from what?
Death, of course.
Stand me up. l'm all right. l'm all right.
Yes, sir.
But you don't understand.
You don't know.
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...
...what we thought they were. l was wrong.
We were so wrong.
Charlie....
Dr. Holloway's dead.
We must leave!
And what would Charlie do...
...now that we're so close...
...to answering the most meaningful questions...
...ever asked by mankind?
How can you leave without...
...knowing what they are?
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?
Okay. Okay.
Come in.
Where the hell are you going, doc?
You know what this place is?
Those Engineers? This ain't their home. lt's an installation.
Maybe even military.
They put it out here because they're not stupid enough...
...to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep.
That's what all that shit is in those vases.
They made it here. lt got out, it turned on them. The end. lt's time for us to go home.
One of them is still alive.
Don't you want to know what they have to say? l don't care.
Right.
All you do is fly the ship.
That's right.
But you must care about something, captain. lf you didn't, why are you here?
How about this?
No matter what happens down there...
...l can't bring none of that shit back home with us.
Can't let it happen. l'll do whatever l have to...
...to see that it doesn't.
Make sure you do, captain.
So you came after all. l thought you wanted me to.
After all your attempts to stop me from coming here...
...l'm surprised to see you. lt's all right. Leave us.
Yes, sir. lf you're...
...going down there, you will die.
Very negative way of looking at things.
That's exactly why you should have stayed at home.
Did you really think l was gonna sit in a boardroom for years...
...arguing over who was in charge...
...while you go look for some miracle on some...
...godforsaken rock in the middle of space?
A king has...
...his reign, and then he dies. lt's inevitable.
That...
...is the natural order of things.
Anything else?
No...
...Father.
That's it. l didn't think you had it in you.
Sorry.
Poor choice of words.
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.
What happens when Weyland is not...
...around to program you? l suppose l'll be free.
You want that?
"Want"?
Not a concept l'm familiar with.
That being said...
...doesn't everyone want their parents dead? l didn't.
Dr. Shaw.
So pleased you could join us.
You can take your helmet off if you like, sir.
What?
The air is perfectly breathable.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air. lt's not.
How do you know that?
Smells fine to me.
- Shall we?
- Please.
The bridge is just up ahead.
What is this? lt's a cargo hold.
Janek? Are you seeing this?
How many is there, Shaw?
Thousands.
What the hell?
Ravel, give me those schematics.
Putting it on the table now.
Strip away the dome. lsolate that area, bring it up.
Bringing it up, captain.
Enlarge that.
Rotate it.
That is a ship.
Jesus Christ. lt's a goddamn ship.
A superior species, no doubt.
Their hypersleep chambers...
...will impress, l trust.
So they...
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- l've managed to work out the broad strokes. lt's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving...
...before things went to pot.
Leaving to go where?
Earth.
Why?
Sometimes to create...
...one must first destroy.
Where is he, David?
This way, sir.
Are you sure he's alive?
Absolutely.
And you can speak to him? l believe l can. l'm all right, l'm all right.
Speak to him, David.
Tell him we came, just like he asked.
Ask where they're from.
What are you doing?
Ask him what's in his cargo. lt killed his people.
Shaw, enough.
- David.
- You made it here...
...and it was meant for us. Why?
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up. l need to know why!
What did we do wrong? Why do you...
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...
...mouth again, shoot her.
David, continue. Tell him why l came.
No!
Ford! Move!
There's nothing. l know.
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.
Time to go home.
Mr. Chance, take us home.
Oh, no!
Hey, cap.
What the hell was that?
Prometheus!
Come in!
Shaw, is that you?
Copy.
Janek...
...listen to me.
This ship is taking off!
- What?
- What is she talking about?
You can't let it leave!
You have to stop it!
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.
Janek, if you don't stop it...
...there won't be any home to go back to. lt's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
- l know.
Let's go. l know that.
But you must do it.
Captain, let's go!
Janek, please believe me! Please! l told you to get this ship going.
Mr. Ravel.
Warm up the ion propulsion.
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.
Burning ion in the atmosphere--
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?
This is my ship. l'm telling you...
...to take us home!
Vickers, l'll eject your module onto...
...that surface. Two years of life.
You want it, or you want to stay with me?
You got 40 seconds to get...
...to the escape pod.
You're crazy.
Gentlemen...
...l can handle this myself.
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.
All due respect, captain.
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna need all the help you can get.
Well, if you can't be with the one you love lf you think this means the bet's off...
...you're wrong.
Why don't you pay me on the other side?
All right, get us as close as we can.
Only got one shot at this.
Lifeboats away!
Twenty seconds...
...to evacuate.
- Countdown initiated.
- lon propulsion...
...is online.
Ten.
Nine.
Come on!
Eight.
- Three.
- Let's do this.
Two. lmpact imminent.
Hands off!
Oh, God.
No. No.
No! No! No!
Oh, God.
Warning: You have two minutes of oxygen remaining.
Warning: You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining.
Airlock sealed.
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.
Elizabeth, are you there?
This is David.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, l'm here.
You need to get out immediately.
He's coming for you.
Who's coming?
Airlock breach.
Die! l'm so sorry.
Oh, God. l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Charlie, l can't do it. l can't do it anymore.
Elizabeth.
Are you there?
Dr. Shaw...
...can you hear me?
Yes.
Yes, l can hear you. l was afraid you were dead.
You have no idea what afraid is. l know we've had our differences...
...but, please...
...l need to ask you for your help.
Why the hell would l help you?
Because, without me, you'll never leave this place.
Neither one of us is leaving this place. lt's not the only ship.
There are many others. l can operate them.
Dr. Shaw?
Dr. Shaw!
Over here.
Where is my cross?
The pouch in my utility belt.
Even after all this...
...you still believe, don't you?
You said you could understand their navigation...
...use their maps.
Yes, of course.
Once we get to one of their other ships...
...finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward. l don't want to go back to where we came from. l want to go where they came from.
Do you think you can do that, David?
Yes. l believe l can.
May l ask what you hope to achieve by going there?
They created us.
Then they tried to kill us.
They changed their minds. l deserve to know why.
The answer is irrelevant.
Does it matter why they changed their minds?
Yes.
Yes, it does. l don't understand.
Well...
...l guess that's because l'm a human being...
...and you're a robot. l'm sorry. lt's quite all right.
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.
The ship and her...
...entire crew are gone.
If you're receiving this transmission...
...make no attempt to come to its point of origin.
There is only death here now, and l'm leaving it behind. lt is New Year's Day...
...the year of our Lord, 2094.
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.
And l am still searching.
Earth, before the war.
New York, before I was born.
A place I've only seen pictures of.
I know you...
But we've never met.
I'm with you...
But I don't know your name.
I know I'm dreaming. But it feels like more than that.
It feels like a memory.
How can that be?
March 14th, 2077.
Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.
And I'm still haunted by these dreams.
Victoria and I were assigned together.
In two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll I join the others.
But the questions I ask, she doesn't.
The things I wonder about, she won't.
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.
Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.
Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.
Tsunamis wiped out what remained.
Then came the invasion.
We did what we had to do.
We used the nukes.
We won the war, but lost the planet.
Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.
What remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.
We built the Tet, our mission control.
A temporary space station before the migration to Titan,
Saturn's largest moon.
Everyone's there now.
Well, almost everyone.
Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.
We protect the hydro rigs,
which convert Earth's sea water
into fusion energy for the new colony.
The survival of humanity depends on it.
Thank you for the coffee.
Remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation.
They attack our drones at night,
and try to kill me during the day.
There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.
Mission says we have done well.
That we are an effective team.
Vika's my communications officer.
She keeps an eye on me.
I handle drone maintenance.
The drones watch everything.
Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.
I can't shake the feeling that Earth,
in spite of all that's happened...
Earth is still my home.
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Morning, Bob.
Tower, comm check.
Drone Maintenance Technician
49, hydro rig support.
All Bubbleship systems are green.
I'm good to go.
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.
Always am.
No, you're not.
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.
All right, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.
I got 'em. Hydro rigs are sucking seawater.
You got 'em, Bob?
Drone 185 looks good.
Jack, we've got two drones down.
Shit.
Stand by,
Mission coming online.
And we have Tet contact.
Morning, boss.
Tower 49, this is Mission Control.
How y'all doing this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.
I have two...
You have two drones offline.
Perimeter's compromised.
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.
Linking to beacon now.
You'll go there first.
Got it. On my way.
Mission, Tech-49 is en route to Grid 37 now.
Can you plug that hole with Drone 109?
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.
Jack better find those drones and get 'em flying.
Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.
Copy that.
Tower, didn't he fix 166 recently?
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.
And, if we had the parts that we've been asking for, we wouldn't be running a skeleton crew down here.
Understood.
We're doing the best we can.
Are you an effective team?
We are an effective team.
Your directive today is to rehabilitate 166
and find 172.
Get 'em flying by sundown,
and I'll buy you two a round of drinks when you get up to the Tet.
You had better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now, we're keeping track.
Okay.
Come on, Bob. Work with me, here, buddy.
Tech-49?
Tech-49?
Jack?
Copy, Tower.
What happened?
I lost you for a second.
Really?
Coming up on location.
There it is.
I've got multiple scav kills.
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.
Got any movement?
No sign of scavenger activity.
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.
Copy that.
I'm coming in hot.
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.
I always do.
You know,
I read about this game.
It was played right here.
The last Super Bowl.
Please don't tell me it was a classic.
A classic game.
Down by four.
The ball
was on the 50-yard line.
Seconds left on the clock.
The ball is snapped, and the QB fumbles.
Disaster.
Looks like the game is over.
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.
You don't have the necessary tools down there.
And a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.
But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.
Hold on, what did you just do?
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.
A Hail Mary.
Eighty-thousand people on their feet, watching this ball sail through the air.
Downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.
He just leaps out of the pack.
Touchdown!
Contact! West contact!
Jack?
It's okay, Vika.
It's just a dog.
Hey.
Now, go on. You gotta get out of here.
Go on, get!
Get out of here! Go!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
You're welcome.
166 is back online.
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.
These scavs are getting bolder.
Well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.
Once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.
This is bullshit.
We won the war.
Now we have to leave.
Two more weeks, Jack.
Then we'll be on our way to Titan.
Yep.
That drone is out there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
Without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.
So we go to our ground game.
Tower, I've located 172 down a sinkhole.
No visual, but I can hear it.
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.
How's it look?
It's good, it's good. There's no sign of scav activity on top.
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.
After that, you're on your own.
Mission, this is Tower 49.
Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.
I've got a visual on Drone 172.
Jack?
What the hell?
Shit.
Ha!
Jack!
Tech-49,
Jack Harper.
Jack Harper, Tech-49!
Hey!
Oh, no.
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!
"How can a man die better Than facing fearful odds"
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"
Jack?
Yep, I'll be right there.
How does 109 look?
Can it fly?
Barely.
And without armor, she's a sitting duck.
Well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.
Okay.
Again.
What, Jack Harper?
Where did you get this?
It was growing in...
Come on, Jack, you know the regulations.
I know you think I'm a stickler but you have no idea what kind of toxins could be in something like that.
It's a flower, Vika.
Yeah, that's not the point.
It's that we are so close to the end, and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.
Okay.
Every day, you have to go down there and see what was lost.
But we've done our job, Jack.
It's time to go.
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.
The scavs.
They were trying to catch me.
Well, they can't have you.
Come on.
You should come with me sometime, before we leave.
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.
I'll show you something.
Hey, hey!
Oh, my God.
It was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.
It's offline permanently.
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.
I need to know exactly what happened.
Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells
and got it into the suction.
Tower, hold.
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?
Yes.
It's gotta be scav.
It's not one of ours.
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.
On my way.
Tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.
Can you confirm?
Negative, Mission, that number is 10.
Drone 172 was lost last night.
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.
I've run the numbers.
We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.
Copy.
Our job is to run those rigs. Your directive is to protect them.
We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?
Copy.
Are you and Jack an effective team?
Damn right we are.
Jack?
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?
Jack?
Yeah, I got it.
They have some kind of a repeater.
The scavs are using the building as an antenna.
Can you decrypt?
It's a set of coordinates.
Grid 17.
It's a goddamn homing beacon.
Grid 17.
What the hell is out there?
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.
What is going on?
Why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?
I'm shutting it down.
Tech-49, check your course. You're headed right for the border.
That radiation will cook you from the inside before you know it.
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.
I'm gonna do a perimeter check before I head home.
I may go off-comm.
Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.
Do you copy?
Jack, do you copy?
That's right, Bob.
You know where we're going.
Are you gonna miss me?
I'm gonna miss this place.
It would have been great.
It would have been great.
Vika? Vika, did you get that?
Jack, where have you been?
An object came down in 17.
That's the beacon coordinates.
Exactly.
I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.
Jack, Mission's almost offline.
I'm en route now.
Mission, we have an unidentified object impact in 17.
It came down at coordinates sent by a scav beacon.
My tech's en route now.
Tower, we're going offline soon,
but drones are already mobile and executing.
Have your tech stand down.
Copy.
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.
That's a negative, Tower.
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.
I want to know this site is secure.
Sally, my tech's concerned about the security of the site.
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.
Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?
Copy, Command, I'm...
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.
I'm on site.
Jack.
I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.
Vika, I think it's one of ours.
This thing is ancient.
It looks...
...pre-war.
The scavs brought this thing down, Jack.
There's no sign of scavs.
Technician, this is your Control.
I'm ordering you to pull out and return to the tower immediately.
Touching down.
They're human.
Tower, we have got survivors.
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.
They are human.
Stand down!
Vika, the drones are firing on survivors.
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.
Stand down!
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Back off, you son of a bitch!
Back off!
Open the door.
Vika!
Get the med kit.
Get the med kit!
This has to be reported.
Be sure and report that the drones killed the crew from one of our own ships.
See what Command makes of that.
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.
Jack.
Here.
You're still dehydrated.
Where are we?
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.
What's your name?
I'm Julia.
Julia...
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you, but you were in a crash.
Your ship came down.
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.
But none of your crew survived.
What do you mean?
You're the only one that made it.
I'm sorry.
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.
Some disorientation is normal.
How long?
Sixty years.
At least.
I have to get back to our ship.
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.
Vika...
Don't touch me.
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon from the surface.
Do you know anything about that?
What was your mission?
It's classified.
Well, we have no record of an Odyssey...
I can't tell you anything until I get the flight recorder from my ship.
Julia, a lot has changed in 60 years.
While you were in delta sleep,
Earth was attacked.
Call them scavs.
They destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.
Then they invaded.
We won the war, but Earth was ruined.
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.
Or on the space station, getting ready to go.
We're here for security and drone maintenance.
We're the mop-up crew.
You've lost people.
Everything.
If you want to be alone, we understand.
The drones killed her entire crew.
If I hadn't gotten there...
I want her gone first thing.
Vika...
Do you have any memories before the mission?
Before the security wipe?
Our job is not to remember.
Remember?
Do you remember her?
Jack...
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.
We don't know who she is.
Or what she is.
Let's just get through the night.
Okay?
You fly that thing?
Yes.
What happens now?
The Tet will be online soon.
Victoria will report your rescue.
They'll send someone down for you.
From the Tet?
Yes.
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.
The scavs, they move at night.
They could be all over it by now.
I need to know what happened.
You need to know what happened.
Please.
Jack?
Jack, what are you doing?
Vika, she's a flight officer.
She wants to see her ship and secure the flight recorder.
Now, you would want the same thing.
Jack, I...
I can't protect you.
No, I understand.
This one's on me.
I couldn't save them.
Jack. Jack!
Jack, can you hear me?
All right, it's time to go.
Jack.
I found it.
Jack!
Tower 49, how are y'all this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise.
Sally...
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol and went off-comm near the canyons in 17.
Now,
I know we're low on drones, but, um, requesting one to sweep the area.
Just a quick scout.
Copy 49, tasking 185 to Grid 22.
"And how can a man die better Than facing fearful odds"
"For the ashes of his fathers"
"And the temples of his Gods"
I've been watching you, Jack.
You're curious.
What are you looking for in those books?
Do they bring back old memories?
You won't get anything from me.
My memory has been wiped to protect...
...the security of the mission. Yes.
You can't have your precious memory falling into the wrong hands, now, can you?
Tell me.
Have you ever met a scav up close?
Of course not.
You just repair drones.
"Don't go into the radiation zone."
"Don't ask too many questions."
Not part of the job description.
Lights.
We're not alien, Jack.
We're human.
Of course, for us, being human is a problem.
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.
Vocal scrambling.
Can you hear me, Jack?
Keeps your drones confused.
Well, most of the time.
The drones are programmed...
To kill humans, Jack.
You saw what they did to those sleep pods.
You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting that woman.
Why did you do that?
Anyone would have.
"Anyone."
Interesting.
We're wasting our time.
The drone will track him here.
That's Sergeant Sykes.
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.
I hope you prove him wrong.
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail somewhere near the west canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
Stand by.
DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.
Vika, are you okay?
Everything good between you two?
Of course.
You're still an effective team?
We're great.
Never better.
We were running a ground game, and losing.
So, we decided,
"What the hell?"
"We've got to throw the long ball."
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.
Why?
The Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.
Very hard to come by.
Did you like the show last night?
That was just one fuel cell.
Imagine what 10 of them will do, with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.
We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.
But it knows you, Jack.
We need you to program the drone.
Have it carry our nuke up to the Tet.
End this war.
There are people up there.
Sergeant.
Program the drone to return to the Tet.
It needs to go right to the center.
Screw you.
We haven't got time for this.
Hey. Hey!
No.
Let's go!
Get him up.
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower, we're seeing the same thing.
Permission to task two additional drones?
If one drone is here, more will come.
And they won't stop until they find me.
They'll turn this place to dust.
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.
It's your only chance.
I've been to your
"radiation zones."
If you're looking for the truth, that's where you'll find it.
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.
What makes you think he's different?
She does.
Mission, I've found my tech over in 37.
You can call off the search.
Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.
Tasking the other drones back to rig support.
Where are we going now?
Who are you?
What aren't you telling me?
Jack, I...
What were you doing on the Odyssey?
What was your mission?
It was a research flight to Titan. My first.
That's what it was supposed to be.
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners picked up an alien object.
We were reassigned to investigate.
They put us all in delta.
They must have woken you and Victoria first.
What?
That object was the Tet, Jack.
The Tet was our mission.
That's impossible.
That's impossible!
Who are you?
I'm your wife.
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.
Jack, we were here.
You asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.
I could tell you were nervous that day.
It was right here, Jack.
You said,
"Look through here, and I'll show you the future."
And I held up a ring.
And you said...
"Yes."
There you are.
There you are.
Hi.
Hello.
Come on.
Vika, I'm coming in.
Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?
Do you copy?
Vika, open the door.
Stay away from me.
I don't want to hear it.
It's not safe here, and we need to leave, now.
It was always her.
Wasn't it?
Vika...
She's my wife.
Mission, this is Tower 49.
Go ahead, 49.
No.
I'm having a problem with my technician.
No, you don't know what you're doing.
He found a survivor at the crash site.
You've gotta listen to me.
She's impeding his abilities, and he is unfit for service.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.
Are you still an effective team?
Vika...
Open the goddamn door, Vika!
No.
We are not an effective team.
Vika, please.
We have to go now.
I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack.
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.
I'm going to Titan.
There is no Titan.
They lied to us.
Just stay away from me.
Vika, please, there are things...
Things you need to know.
I don't want to know!
Jack...
Hi, Jack. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
What have you done?
You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.
Sometimes things go wrong.
"Go wrong"?
You killed her.
I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.
Jack, we want to bring you in.
I've been authorized to tell you
we're going to assign you a new mission.
You and the survivor.
There's a lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.
We can debrief, then anything's possible.
It's time to come home, Jack.
Jack?
Jack?
Jack...
I'm sorry.
Hang on.
Lightning.
That's the plan.
We need cover.
There.
Are you okay?
No.
Don't worry, we're staying out of there.
Are we gonna die?
No!
Maybe.
Jack!
Son of a bitch.
Wait here.
Who is it?
Hey!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey!
Drop your weapon!
It's okay.
Don't move!
We have to shut that drone down.
Stop moving!
Jack!
It's okay.
Julia.
Julia!
Don't.
Don't touch me.
Hold on.
Just hold on.
Jack Harper, Tech-52.
Hey.
There you are.
What happened?
Are you okay?
That bogey came across the border and then I lost you.
False alarm.
I should get back out there.
You come all the way home, and I don't get a kiss?
What's going on up there?
I was thinking...
Why don't you come down with me?
To the surface?
We could go right now.
Now?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
You won't believe what's down there.
Jack...
You know the regulations.
Yes.
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.
Okay.
This is gonna hurt.
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?
You always loved this song.
I'm not him.
I know I'm not.
But I've loved you...
...for as long as I can remember.
I don't know how else to say it.
You know what you said to me once?
You said when it was all over, you would build me a house on a lake.
We would grow old and fat together.
And we would fight.
Maybe drink too much.
Real romantic.
And then we would die and be buried in a meadow by the lake.
And the world would forget about us.
But we would always have each other.
I remember.
Those memories are yours, Jack.
They're ours.
They are you.
Good morning.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.
You still can.
I have to go.
Those people need my help.
We'll come back when it's over.
Promise me.
We'll come back when it's over.
You had me worried for a second.
I thought you weren't coming back.
Well, I had to prove him wrong.
You look like shit.
You should see the other guy.
If I had told you what you'd find out there, you would have thought I was crazy.
I still do.
Malcolm Beech.
Julia Harper.
Come on.
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail
somewhere near the West Canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
Stand by.
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.
I'd been in the army less than a year when that unholy Tet arrived.
I saw the moon get taken out.
Right up there in the night sky.
I couldn't believe it.
After that, nature took over.
There's bedrock around Chicago, so we were spared the worst of the waves and the quakes.
Most people just starved.
Then the Tet sent troop ships down.
The doors opened, and out you came.
Astronaut Jack Harper.
Thousands of you.
Memory wiped.
Programmed to kill.
They had taken one of our best and turned him against us.
No soul.
No humanity.
The Tet.
What a brilliant machine.
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.
Phase Two was drones.
Repairmen.
50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.
Then one day,
I saw you set down.
Another drone to fix.
But in the rubble that day was a book.
You picked it up.
You studied it.
And I thought I saw a way.
When you stepped in front of that drone and saved her,
I knew.
You were in there somewhere.
I just had to find a way to bring you back.
Watch it, watch it.
Eyes on it.
Steady.
Give it some space.
Come on, you're making it nervous.
That is one pissed-off weapon.
No, it's just a machine.
I'm the weapon.
I would love to be there to see that thing's face when this goes off.
That would be a one-way trip.
Yeah, but it would be worth it.
Welcome back, Commander.
Open the doors!
Shit!
Spread out!
Head down, keep your head down!
Jack!
Follow me!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Hey!
Jack.
I'm okay.
The drone.
Send the drone.
It's gone.
I thought we had it.
I really did.
I can take the bomb myself.
Ah...
You know it will swat you like a fly.
Not if I go.
No.
She asked you to bring me up.
So bring me up.
We'll go together.
It reminds me of home.
Ready?
Jack.
Dream of us.
Jack...
Flight recorder playback for the Odyssey mission.
3 May, 2017.
Okay, Bob.
Ready for space?
Good morning, Odyssey, from your friends here at Mission Control.
Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.
Thank you for that fantastic wake-up call.
Pre-rendezvous checks complete.
Electrical guidance and nav systems, all good.
Range behind object,
250 clicks...
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.
Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.
After 39 days of sleep, sounds like you're ready to go.
I'm ready to go.
Your next burn will bring you up level
and co-speed at 50 kilometer range, where you'll hold.
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object for sensor scan and evaluation.
Targets look good.
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...
Ignition.
We see a good burn.
Are you reading any output from the object?
Negative.
Zero heat.
No EMR.
There's no sign of life.
How is the rest of the crew doing?
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should be up here shortly.
The rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.
Copy that.
You missed a hell of a game last night.
What did I tell you guys? No spoilers about last night's game.
I'm looking forward to watching it when I get back.
You're not talking about football already, are you?
Good morning, Vika.
Good morning, Sally.
How are you doing this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise.
Hey.
One for history.
Yeah.
Tech-49,
I have you on approach.
Hello, Sally.
It's a busy morning, huh?
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.
It's Julia Rusakova, the female survivor from the crashed module.
State your intention.
Deliver the survivor, as requested.
We are a more effective team.
Proceed to entry.
Mission, we have a situation.
The last burn was spot-on to give us a 50-click hold from object, but radar range still decreasing.
We're accelerating toward the object.
We're going to need full OMS burn to pull away.
Initiate now.
Entering target.
Gimbals set.
Target's good.
Arm forward engines.
Engines on.
Ready? Let's go.
Mission, we're in full OMS burn, trying to back out.
There's a lot of vibration.
We're not getting away from this thing.
Odyssey, telemetry shows structural overstress.
Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?
Cutting off burn.
Mission.
Mission?
Mission?
Sally?
Increased acceleration toward the object.
Estimated contact within two minutes.
I'm going to eject the sleep module.
It's programmed for reinsertion into Earth orbit.
I'll fly the Command module out if I break free.
I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.
That's an order!
Jack, no, we're a team.
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!
Dream of us.
Jack...
Tech-49, enter at headway speed.
Entering at headway.
You buck up, Bob.
Don't go all shaky on me.
Jack, I can't help notice
your respiration and heart rate have increased.
I'm just excited to finally meet you, Sally.
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.
Yeah.
I feel bad about that.
Voice analysis indicates you are lying to me, Jack.
Tell me why you are here.
You have five seconds.
I want Julia to live.
I want our species to survive.
This is the only way.
Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.
Welcome home, Jack.
Come on.
Jack, you're doing the right thing.
I don't know what you are, or where you're from, but I'd like to tell you about something I read.
A story from Rome, a city you destroyed.
It's a classic.
There was a guy, Horatius, held the bridge alone against a whole army.
And what Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better..."
You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.
Everybody dies, Sally.
The thing is, to die well.
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.
No, it's not.
What Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better"
"Than facing fearful odds"
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!
"For the ashes of his fathers"
"And the temples of his Gods"
I created you, Jack.
I am your God.
Fuck you, Sally.
Earth, after the war.
Three years have passed since I saw your face.
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.
In the day, as memories.
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?
And I wonder if you see me
when you look at her.
Mommy, look.
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.
Undimmed by time.
Unbound by death.
For three years, I searched for the house he built.
I knew it had to be out there.
Because I know him.
I am him.
Who's that?
I am Jack Harper.
And I am home.
I'm doing this because I love you.
You know what happened.
This is what you'll turn into.
Don't talk to anyone.
- I warn you.
- Don't move a muscle unless I tell you to.
- Don't talk to anyone.
- Why would you keep things from me?
John! Look at me. Look at me, John.
Look at me.
Don't look at me unless I tell you to.
Don't talk to anyone. Don't talk to anyone.
John, why would you...
I don't love you anymore.
How many times do the people of Nebraska
have to be embarrassed by the man
that represents it?
That was challenger Ted Johnson
responding to the latest scandal
to rock the highly contested Senate race
between he and incumbent senator
Jackson Wyatt.
Wyatt has been photographed
with yet another woman that is not his wife.
- Good morning, Mr. French.
- Good morning.
Thank you, sir.
John, Mr. Crill's election celebration's today.
I've taken the liberty of cutting some flowers from my garden for all the men to wear on their lapels.
Have all this finished by 3:00.
You're probably going to have to skip lunch.
Okay?
Paycheck for you.
I don't know why she didn't make one of her girls make this.
I know. It's ridiculous.
Fanny's just promoting her shelter.
I can't believe she's throwing him another party.
Girls, once you're done with that thing...
- And keep the candy in a...
- A separate bag, John?
- Baseball cards, too?
- Yes. Yes, please. Five packs.
- Hello, John.
- Hello.
It's always nice to see a friendly face.
- Hello, Mrs. Sternberg.
- Louise. Call me Louise.
Okay, Mrs. Sternberg.
Must get Ionely in that house.
You should come over to dinner.
- I make a wonderful pot roast.
- Well, excuse me.
Ron, should someone call Dr. Elkins?
Can you move your fingers and toes?
No, no, no.
- I'll stay right here.
- We thought you were a goner.
You're lucky to be alive.
Can everyone please step back?
- Who is she?
- I didn't know John had a wife.
You afraid?
Kyle, why don't you run inside to the kitchen?
I don't mean to be rude, but how do you know John?
- Are you family?
- I live here.
John! John!
You okay? Another 10 feet, your house would've been a goner.
- Is your lady friend okay?
- My breakfast is getting cold.
John?
- Hey, John.
- Officer.
We just heard about the train.
Is everything...
I'm... I'm supposed to go to work now.
- John, I heard about the train.
- Good morning, Mr. French.
- Was there a woman there?
- Thank you.
Was there a woman in your house?
I mean...
- I heard about the train.
- I really need to get this work done.
There he is, John Skillpa. Talk of the town.
- Morning, Mr. Crill.
- Good morning, Doris.
So a train bucks the rail, winds up in your backyard and you still come to work?
Yes, sir. Well, I had to.
I've never seen anything like that.
So what can I do for you?
Day off? Remember, we're all family here, so take advantage.
- Hello, sir. These need to get done.
- Thank you.
I don't care about the work.
And I don't think Edmund does, either.
Of course not.
I suggested he take the day off as soon as he came into work this morning.
John, go home.
I'll just get this one work done, and then I'll go home for lunch, if that's okay with you, sir. Please.
Sure.
Ladies.
John, these need to be done. Thanks.
- There you are.
- Officer.
This morning on your bike, you acted like you've never seen me before.
- John...
- Superman!
Hey, kids. Go on, get down from there.
Go on.
I knocked on your door this morning to check on the young lady you got staying with you.
Nobody answered.
Some of the women tell me she's your wife.
Nobody knew you got married.
Congratulations.
John, I'm really happy for you.
I just need everything back to how it was before.
- Have you even called anybody?
- No, sir.
All right.
Listen here. When your mother died,
I showed you what to do, who to call, what papers need to be filled out, and you did it.
That's exactly what you got to do now.
Yes, sir.
There's no one here to help you anymore, you understand?
You need to call the train company and tell them exactly what you want.
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Skillpa, first I want to apologize for any
inconvenience. I've spoken to Mayor Crill.
Well, thank you, Mr. Clapp. Can you come and get your train out of my backyard?
We're working on that, as we speak.
The inspectors and engineers
are on their way,
but, as I said, these things take time.
Well, I just want it gone as soon as possible.
Officer McGonigle told me to call.
How about tomorrow?
I could come home early and I could get a half day at work.
Tomorrow would be good for me.
Listen, we're probably gonna have to send
a team of welders down there.
Our head engineer,
Mark Huggins will have to take a look at it.
He can't get down there until Friday.
No sooner than Friday?
Sir, like I said,
Mark Huggins will be there on Friday.
You looking for this?
- Oh, my.
- I got it.
- Come on, birdie.
- Connor, it's over there.
- You have to get out now. Please.
- Come on. Come on, birdie.
- Please leave.
- Connor, get ready to close the door.
I'm Connor Black.
I'm senior political advisor to Senator Jackson Wyatt.
And we're here to see Mr. Skillpa.
Fanny Crill.
Such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Skillpa.
Well, I must say, there could be less odd circumstances to get acquainted.
- John's not here.
- Fanny.
We're here because of that monstrosity in your backyard.
We want to do a rally in your backyard using the train as a backdrop.
- What?
- That train was part of Senator Wyatt's
Whistle Stop campaign.
The challenger, Ted Johnson, is a real mudslinger.
He wants to use the train as a metaphor for my boss' political career.
To be blunt,
I need you and your husband's help.
Have you seen this picture?
Ted Johnson's gonna use this photo to hurt our campaign.
We're only three weeks from election day, and we can't let him get away with it this time.
And Connor has been kind enough to allow me to organize the event.
All of Peacock will be here.
Marching band, food.
What a very special day it will be.
You and your husband together with the Senator.
Connor, why don't you take that outside?
You don't mind if I have a moment alone with Mrs. Skillpa?
Sure, sure.
I don't have anything better to do.
I knew I should've come alone.
You know, I have always been so curious about this house.
Well, have a seat.
How do you know John?
Well, my husband owns the bank.
He's John's boss.
Ray's been the Mayor of Peacock for three terms now.
I guess this must all be just a tad overwhelming, Mrs. Skillpa.
Why don't you let me explain?
I run the county shelter for women.
We mold the modern woman.
The woman who votes.
And Wyatt is viewed as someone who's, well, a little insensitive to women's needs.
And so Connor had the idea that we would get a bunch of my girls together with the Senator and take a photo, and I've agreed to it.
But that oaf has no idea that I plan to use the rally to raise money for my shelter.
- Mrs. Crill, I need to go upstairs.
- Come on now.
Life doesn't begin and end with housework, and please call me Fanny.
Mrs. Skillpa, this photo will help us get donors for the shelter.
I don't know.
I know that the Skillpas have a long history of keeping to themselves.
But you're your own woman.
Remember that.
Okay, well, it was a pleasure meeting you and if you need anything, just come out back and we'll only stay a few minutes.
I have to tell Wanda.
- What have you got there?
- Mrs. Skillpa, how're you feeling?
- You look so much better.
- That is so lovely.
- Careful. Watch yourself.
- John should really fix that step.
- Fanny?
- Yes?
When is the shelter clothing drive this year?
It's closer to Christmas.
Mrs. Skillpa, I'm sure you know all about
Fanny's work at the shelter with displaced women and children.
Displaced children?
Well, we've been known to help in the adoption process.
Find good homes for children.
Well, you should come and meet some of my girls sometime.
So, where are your kids?
Well, Mr. Black, I don't know how you folks do it in Lincoln, but in Peacock, we don't pry.
I'd love to hear you say yes to this rally.
If it's John, only you know the best way to get through to your husband.
So get through. Understand?
It's moments like this modern women take advantage of, because it's moments like this that put us on the map.
We ladies have to stick together,
Mrs. Skillpa.
Emma. Please call me Emma.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. French.
I'm so sorry, but John is running a little late.
Yes, I'll have him off to work in no time.
Johnny, man of the hour.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no, no, no.
Come on. Connor, this is our guy.
John Skillpa, meet Connor Black.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Hey, how about this?
- That's really something, isn't it, Johnny?
- I loved meeting your wife.
- Who?
- Emma.
She's wonderful and that house,
I can see why your family loved it so much.
God, you were in my house?
Connor, why don't you explain to John our plan for the rally?
What we'd like to do is hold a political rally in your backyard using the train as a backdrop.
The whole town will be there.
Well, the train's gonna be gone on Friday
'cause I spoke to Mr. Clapp
- and he said...
- John.
John, hear Mr. Black out.
- Yes, sir.
- Emma loved the idea of the rally.
Your wife made us lemonade and cookies.
She was so hospitable...
Well, she's not the boss of me!
- Don't speak to my wife that way.
- I...
You don't know what you're doing.
Everything just needs to get back to how it was before.
Mr. Clapp promised the train would be gone on Friday, and that's what needs to happen.
John, I spoke to Albert Clapp this morning.
- The train's gonna be there a while longer.
- Well, it's my house.
And I don't know what she told you.
I don't know what she told you, but she's not the boss of me.
I make the decisions, not Emma.
I'm the man of the house.
We know you're the man of the house, John.
Now, Mark Huggins is coming to take that train away on Friday, and that's that.
Connor, why don't you and I go to Ray's office and let him speak to John alone?
John.
John, I wanna run for Senate someday.
Now this could really get me in with the big guys.
I don't understand how your wife can see how big this is, and you don't.
No one understands, sir.
John, I don't wanna hear another word out of you.
You need to sit here and think about this.
I can't let her do this.
John?
It's me.
Jake! Come back to Mama right now.
Is anyone home?
What do you want?
There just isn't any easy way to say this, John.
Jake and me, we...
We're getting out of this town.
I need your help.
What kind of help?
Money help.
It's been almost a year now.
I've doubled up shifts just to keep my place.
I don't know what else to do.
I mean, I've been planning on getting out of here for a while now.
You know, saving and all.
- Look, I know you've got...
- Why are you asking me for money?
The checks.
I haven't got a check in a year now.
- Lf I could just...
- What checks?
I wasn't sending you any checks.
Your... Your mother was.
My mother died a year ago.
I didn't know that.
What were the checks for?
He's two now.
I... I honestly thought you knew.
Your mama was sending me checks as long as I stayed away.
John, please. John, where are you going?
I have my own money.
Don't go.
John, I really think...
Come here, honey. I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize anyone else was home.
We better be going. I'm so sorry.
What's his name?
Jake.
Who are you?
I'm Maggie.
Just an old friend of John's.
Why are you here?
I read in the paper about the train and all.
I just wanted to stop by and make sure everything was okay.
I better be going.
- I'm Emma. John's wife.
- Nice to meet you.
Good night.
Maggie.
Where's your car?
I let a friend borrow it.
Her aunt's real sick in Lincoln, so Jake and I just been doing a lot of walking.
You don't really own a car, do you?
I don't mean to pry or be rude, but where's his bed?
Why don't you let me drive you home?
That'd be real nice.
I'm sorry, where's John?
He's sleeping.
You ready?
Do you... Do you drive much?
You caught me.
You don't drive?
No.
Okay. You just use one foot.
Don't put one on the gas and one on the brake.
- Just use one foot to go back and forth.
- All right.
Just like that.
- Just easy.
- All right.
I think you're ready for the open road.
Thanks for driving me way out here.
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.
You didn't, you didn't. Don't be silly.
Let me help you into the house.
Have a seat. I'll be right out.
Here you go, sweetie.
Good night, Jakey.
Would you like a drink?
Just a little something would be nice.
- Do you like it here?
- It's all I can afford right now.
Excuse me.
- I got a few bucks, if you got a few minutes.
- Not now, cupcake. I got company.
Okay.
Well, you know where to find me.
Is that how you met John?
Emma, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay. It's okay, Maggie.
I just want...
I just want what's better for Jake.
You know what, I went...
I went as long as I could without that money.
What money?
Was John sending you money?
His mother was.
Emma, it's bad.
It's really bad.
Please, I need to know.
I won't judge you.
Please believe me when I say that.
I met his mother three years ago in a bar, and she paid me.
She said it was just to meet John.
She brought me to that house and she brought me...
She brought me up those stairs, and I thought you were her.
She was wearing this old blue and white dress.
And the creaking of that bed.
John didn't wanna do any of it.
I swear, Emma.
But I couldn't stop her.
And she just stayed in the room the whole time.
And then I was forced to stay.
I was so scared.
She made him do...
She made him do horrible things.
And I'm the worst person in the world.
- It's okay, Maggie.
- I'm sorry.
Us ladies have to stick together, right?
What if we wanted to adopt Jake?
Well, you'd have to come down
for an interview and fill out the forms.
So, John and I would both have to come in together?
Yes. Is that a problem?
Well, it's just that with John's work schedule and all...
- I understand. You also need references.
- Yes.
- Could Fanny Crill help with that?
- Are they staying at her shelter?
No. Why?
Well, the shelter's very effective
in facilitating adoptions.
I didn't know that.
- Well, let me know what you'd like me to do.
- Thank you.
"'Perhaps you could play with me,'
Wendy said hopefully.
"'I'd love to,' sighed the wind, bending the grasses..."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"The socks and the shirts, the sheets and the petticoats,
"and Wendy's pale pink party dress all jiggled on the clothesline."
That's the U-joint, right there.
So that's where everything tends to get clogged, so what you want to do is open that up and drain it.
- Here, Karen, why don't you try?
- Thanks, Fanny.
Well, look who we have here. Emma Skillpa.
- Don't you look beautiful today.
- I want to do the rally.
Excuse me, girls, for a second.
I'd like to talk to Emma alone.
Maybe you could go to the typing room and try your hand at that again. Thanks.
I'm so happy to see you.
- Here, have some lemonade.
- No, I can't. I have to be home by 8:15.
I just really needed to tell you that I want to do the rally.
- And I have a question about the shelter.
- What about John?
He put up quite a stink at the bank.
- I don't understand. You spoke to John?
- Yesterday, and he would have none of it.
- We came to an agreement.
- What changed his mind?
I did.
Terrific. This is going to be huge news.
- You have to tell Connor.
- No, I can't do that. I have to be going.
Yes, you can.
Mrs. Skillpa. My favorite peacock.
- What can I do for you?
- The rally. We'll do it.
Emma? Emma Skillpa?
You know, in a town of only 800 people, you're one of the hardest people to find.
Tom McGonigle.
I stopped by the house this morning.
I'm gonna need you and John to fill out the accident report with me.
I can come by tonight. What's a good time?
Fanny Crill, the Mayor's wife, is waiting for me. Excuse me.
- Hi, Fanny.
- Morning, Mary.
Thanks for noticing.
You know, these gals, they wave and they invite me to parties, but not one of them has ever volunteered at my shelter.
And look at this. Oh, my gosh,
I've got to get my girls to paint this.
Fanny, I don't mean to be rude, but I really should be getting back to the house now.
I got it.
Did you ever meet John's mother?
No.
I don't think many people did.
Do you have children, Fanny?
I'd rather not talk about it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
I have a son. James.
He passed away 14 years ago.
I don't know what to say.
It's okay.
Ray and I tried for a long time, and it finally happened and it was wonderful.
All John and I ever wanted was a little boy running around our house.
Kids give you so much.
I have to get going.
Fanny, how does someone come to stay here?
Emma.
You getting comfortable driving that old car?
What are you doing out here?
I had something I wanted to discuss with you
- if you had a moment.
- Sure.
What the hell's going on?
- Stupid kid!
- Damn it, Wade.
It's okay, sweetie.
You never ever threaten a mother's child.
Maggie, there's dishes to do.
- God, I hate all this.
- You don't have to stay here.
I know Fanny Crill. The Mayor's wife.
- You know the Mayor's wife?
- She's wonderful.
And she runs the most amazing women's shelter.
No. No, I got no time for that.
I mean, those places are for people without ambition.
I'm letting Fanny do this rally at my house.
So she owes me. And besides, I think it would be good for you and for Jake.
For Jake? What good does it do putting him in a place with a bunch of unambitious women?
Maggie, you're family.
And we need to stay close.
That's sweet of you to say that, but I just want to get out of here.
I want a job where I can hold my head high, and I don't think
I'm gonna find that in Peacock.
The shelter can help you with that.
I owe $300 in rent on a trailer.
And Jake's growing like a weed.
New shoes...
It's free rent and clothes and they can help you find a better job.
I can get you over there tonight.
I just want a better life.
John's money could really help me.
Maggie, you don't need his money.
John doesn't understand the importance of family.
Okay.
I'll try.
But if John offers me help, I'll take it.
John. Hello.
- I'm sorry I didn't call ahead of time.
- What's this?
I just wanted to say thank you to you and Emma for, well, everything you're doing.
Is she home? I'd love to say hi.
Evening, John.
Don't worry about work today.
Be sure to tell Emma I said thank you.
All right, I don't want to leave Ray waiting in the car, so just say hi to Emma for me.
What is she doing?
John, will you bring your wife out?
I need the both of you to go over everything.
Yeah, and we need to make sure the caboose is stable enough for the platform.
John, this has to get filled out and signed before you can do the rally.
- You're not helping me.
- Good morning, John.
We're just setting up the grandstand.
- No. No! I said no rally!
- But Emma told me yesterday it was okay.
Emma?
Get out! Get out, all of you!
- Skillpa...
- John, you've got to control yourself.
- Just shut up!
- Okay, fellas. Let's take a break.
- Okay, okay.
- Get out.
You just take a minute and cool off.
Just calm down and fix this.
I'll swing by later.
Excuse me.
- What can I do for you?
- I have a caboose in my backyard.
I have money.
How much to come pick the train up and get it out?
Listen, buddy.
That's private property.
The train company'll have our hides.
I know it's illegal.
But I have money and I'll pay.
- Eight hundred cash, and I start tomorrow.
- Okay.
John Skillpa, you're late.
Where were you yesterday?
You weren't at work all day.
Do you need help?
Did Officer McGonigle get a hold of you?
Because he was looking for you.
I called your house several times.
Several times, John.
I know you have a lot going on, but you or your wife could pick up the phone.
Okay, well, look, train or no train, this cannot happen again.
Peacock State Bank.
You're going to have to skip lunch today.
- Okay, sure. Just one second.
- Sit down.
- You have a phone call.
- Who is it?
It's not for you, sir. It's for John.
I think it's your wife Emma.
- Hello?
- John, it's Maggie.
- Why are you calling?
- I really need to talk to you.
- Where are you?
- I'm at the women's shelter.
- Women's shelter?
- Emma brought me here.
- John, I really need to talk to you.
- You met Emma?
- Yes, I...
- You stay right there. I'll come to you.
- May I help you?
- I want to donate these, please.
And can you get Maggie for me, please?
Come on in.
Just toss them on the chair there.
Maggie, you have a guest.
- John?
- When did she do this?
- Do what?
- Bring you here.
- Yesterday.
- No. I...
John. John, what's wrong?
I met Emma the night I came to your house.
- She gave Jake and me a ride home.
- I can't let her do this.
Maggie, you need to stay away from Emma.
Emma's just trying to help me and Jake.
I'll give you the money so you can leave.
Are you serious?
Yes. I need to get you and Jake out of Peacock.
It's not safe here for Jake.
Maggie, I can't go back to that place.
I'll give you all the money, all of it.
I've got $1,409.16.
Emma doesn't know I have it.
It's at work.
But what do you mean? What place?
You don't understand.
I can't go back home.
I can't go back home.
John, I know you've been through a lot in that house, but you gotta go home. To Emma.
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go?
I'll take you wherever you want to go.
I'll take you.
- I've got family in Madison, but...
- I'll take you there.
I'll give you the money and I'll take you to Madison.
I'll take you and Jake.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm sorry if I caused trouble for you and Emma.
She's not my wife.
John?
- John, are you okay?
- Please don't make me go.
- I can't go home.
- Are you hurt?
No.
- Did you hurt somebody?
- No, I swear I didn't.
She held my head underwater.
Emma?
- No. When I was a kid.
- Your mother?
She's not taking care of me anymore.
And she would have liked Emma.
- Of course.
- Yeah.
I met Emma the day Mom died.
John. She's gone.
You know that. Your mom is gone.
- Okay, buddy.
- I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else.
Okay, buddy, look.
We gotta get you home, okay?
- John, let's get you home.
- I can't go.
Well, you can't stay out here.
No.
- Yeah?
- I need a room.
- How long?
- I don't know.
No, you can't do this to me, Emma.
You can't do this to me.
Good morning, ma'am.
Is the man of the house here?
- Who're you?
- I'm here about the train.
- What about it?
- Your husband hired me to remove it.
Did he?
You see your husband's name at the bottom of this contract?
- Yes.
- Do you see the $800?
Well, as I said before, my husband is not here right now...
Is Maggie with you?
No. Why?
I'm gonna be back here tomorrow, ma'am, at 8:30 and you better have that $800, or you'll be meeting my attorney.
What is that about? Is everything all right?
Yes, everything's fine. Why?
Glenda called me at home and she said that John took Maggie and Jake yesterday and they haven't come back.
Do you know anything about it?
- No, I don't.
- Well, one of the girls said that she seemed a little strange, like maybe she's lying.
- I'll call Maggie at the trailer.
- You don't mind?
No, I insist.
Why weren't you at the shelter last night?
- Emma, please don't be mad at me.
- I just want to know what's going on.
John came by the shelter and he said he'd give me what I asked for.
The money?
And he'll drive to my aunt's in Madison.
Well, he never discussed this with me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come between you and John.
I always said I'd take his help if he offered it.
And I had some good news for you.
- What?
- I just spoke to Fanny Crill about getting you a job at the bank.
And it's a very respectable position, and obviously the pay is a step in the right direction.
And we can all stay together and be here in Peacock.
I don't know, Emma.
Emma?
- Hello?
- Hello, is Maggie there?
Hey, Miss Popular, phone's for you.
Hello.
- Maggie?
- John?
I'm going to the bank
and then we're going to meet tonight.
- You still gonna help me?
- Yes.
John, thank you so much.
It's important that no one knows
what's going on, especially Emma.
Okay.
Meet me at the Husker Motel.
Room 9, 11:00 sharp.
The motel? Why the motel?
If Emma finds out about this, you'll never get the money. Understand?
Yeah, yeah, I understand. or one minute late, you don't get the money.
Okay.
Well, hello, John.
- Louise, hi.
- Hi.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sternberg.
Good afternoon, John.
Why did you come in the front door?
Emma told me how neighborly you've been.
She's a bit frazzled and not herself.
Not every day a train lands in your backyard.
John, the inbox is rather full today.
I won't keep you, but how about you and Emma taking us up on that dinner offer?
That'd be great.
I'm sure it will be.
John, could you follow me, please?
I have a stack of papers for you.
- Goodbye, John.
- Bye.
Mr. French, what would you do without me?
Find someone more reliable.
Where're you from, cupcake?
All over, ma'am. Not really rooted anywhere.
My name's Cal.
My name's Maggie.
Fire!
Fire!
John! John!
Emma?
- Yes?
- May we come in?
Maggie was there.
She confirmed it was him.
The fire chief said it was probably caused by John smoking in bed.
I know John was having a rough time of it.
John didn't do anything wrong.
Emma, can I help you?
Emma?
She needs to be alone.
Let's say a prayer and go.
Heavenly Father, have mercy on Emma.
We pray for your strength,
that she will come to accept
that her earthly loss
is the beginning of life ever after for John,
whom she loved.
In your mercy and love,
forgive whatever sins
John may have committed
through human weakness,
and live forever with your saints.
In your name, we pray. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
And now we should take a moment
and honor Mrs. Skillpa.
From myself and everyone in Peacock,
we want to thank you
for offering us your home
during such a difficult time.
- Where is she?
- I haven't seen her.
Mommy! Mommy!
Everybody at that bank is so nice.
Maggie, come with me.
Emma, is everything okay?
Emma, what's going on?
What are you doing?
I don't want what happened to John to ever happen again.
I'll give you all the money. All of it.
Go to Madison and get out of Peacock.
Did I do something wrong?
I thought I was gonna take John's job at the bank...
John shouldn't be dead.
He shouldn't be dead.
I should never have left the house.
He's not safe here.
I don't understand you. You're scaring me.
It's what John would have wanted.
Now, go. Please.
Please.
Looks like all of Peacock is here.
Thank you for having me.
- Emma? It's almost time to take the picture.
- My good friend, Mayor Crill,
would like to thank Emma Skillpa...
The Senator is leaving soon.
I'll try to represent the best interests
of the people of Nebraska.
Emma, Emma, it's Fanny!
And I believe we're making progress...
Emma?
Where's Maggie, Emma? Is she with you?
It's wonderful out here. You're missing it.
Emma?

DETECTIVE DEE
AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME
The Empress hereby decrees:
The Court of State Ceremonials shall welcome Umayyad diplomat Aspar and escort him to the Towering Buddha to revere the Empress's divine glory.
The Buddha is sixty six yards high, which means there are thirty three heavens beyond the first thirty three heavens, symbolizing reaching the ninth cloud.
I already explained it to the General.
Will it be ready before the Coronation?
Sure, otherwise. . . my life cannot be spared.
This is so spectacular!
Huge resources have been spent on this.
2 million catties of metal were used.
More than 1 000 catties are burnt each day.
The temperature is too high here.
Bring water and a towel for the General!
The General asked of whom the portrait is.
This is Lu Li, our Imperial Chaplain.
He's very potent and trusted by the Empress!
These are amulets bestowed by the Chaplain.
They can dispel evil and thwart disaster...
It's unbearably hot inside the Buddha.
We need to drink at least 2 liters of water a day.
We have to report this!
This is serious and we should do it before lives are lost!
Shatuo, you better go.
Let's go up from here.
Today's so clear we can see miles from here!
This tubular pillar is crucial to the Buddha.
It's 72 yards long and made from one casting.
It is surrounded by. . .
81 steel chains.
In the face of hurricanes or earthquakes, the chains will pull in the opposite direction to prevent collapsing.
General, these are the Buddha's two eyes.
Master Jia... Master Jia. . .
Don't you see we have guests here?
Please. . .
- What's the matter with you?
- When you... inspected the pillar yesterday, you removed some amulets.
Should we put them back?
They haven't been put back?
Moving the amulets will bring bad luck, so...
After you have moved them,
- we all feel so scared that. . .
- I know. nobody dared to put them back.
Our work has been stuck.
Put them back right away. Hurry up!
It's needless to say.
This way, please.
The General says we can see the coronation stage here.
The General says...
Sir... Sir...

Master Xue.
Yes. . .
Sir, the corpse has been burnt to ashes.
No flesh was left.
So strange?
We must find out the cause of the fire.
Any forensic findings from the corpse?
Sir! We found this on the corpse.
Phosphorus! The corpse is filled with it!
Much phosphorus is stored inside the Buddha to melt the copper.
I bet this gave the murderer the opportunity to use what's already in the scene.
Master Jia was burnt by yellow phosphorus!
No, not the phosphorus.
The flame exploded from inside the body.
Pei? How could the flame explode from inside?
Sir, look at his shoe.
The bones were burnt to ashes and left inside the shoe, but its outside remains unscathed.
The flame must have been burnt from inside.
Otherwise, how could this have happened?
Perhaps not!
But the corpse is dense with phosphorus.
Someone must have poisoned his food!
Phosphorus stinks. He couldn't miss it.
Even if he had taken it by mistake, the symptoms should be. . . shortness of breath and bodily pain, but not be aflame.
Cut the crap. The murderer is among you.
Nab them all back for interrogation!
Sir... Sir.
Don't panic!
We can continue our work after the interrogation.
You... the supervisor.
Sir, if you arrest me, our work will be delayed and we're doomed.
What's in your left hand?
What is this? What happened to your hand?
I was punished by the Ministry of Justice and had been jailed for eight years for involving in Detective Dee's treason.
Treason?
A dork like you in treason?
Then you had to be involved.
Sir, if the Buddha can't be finished on time, the Empress will blame us.
Supreme Court won't be better off either.
You dare to threaten us with the Empress?
Good. I'll give you want you want.
I'll chop your right hand off as well.
He was struck by divine intervention!
Master Jia was struck by divine intervention!
Out of my way!
You bugger, cut this crap!
What superstition are you trying to say?
What divine intervention? Spit it out!
Master Jia moved the amulets during his inspection a few days ago.
Bestowed amulets should never be moved.
Stop spreading these fallacies!
Amulets? Can't be moved?
Let me do it.
What's up? You want to try too?
Do you believe it?
Let me move one and you'll all see if divine intervention would strike me now!
Nab all those who went to the top today and take them back.
Handcuff them up at the main gate.
Donglai, you come with me to the Palace and report the case to the Empress.
Everybody else guards over here.
Arrest them all when you've order from the Empress.
Yes, Sir!
Your Majesty, General Yao just entered, leading 200 soldiers from Longzhou.
Following behind is General Qiu, with an army of 600 to protect Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, Master Xue of Supreme Court and his subordinate Pei request an interview!
Let them approach!
Your Majesty, Pei Donglai of Supreme Court.
Regarding the torched death of Jia Yi,
- my preliminary investigation indicates. . .
- He's on fire!
What's wrong with Master Jia?
How come he's on fire?
- Protect Her Majesty!
- Protect Her Majesty!
The Empress hereby decrees:
2000 more Guards shall be garrisoned inside the palace.
Those without permits shall be killed without reprieve.
The Palace becomes so dark by night.
Fire is not allowed in the palace any more.
All flames were replaced by night pearls.
Nobody knows what had happened to the Empress.
All food and drinks came from outside... and they all turned cold when delivered to the Empress.
We all worry about her.
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.
I don't want to smell that again!
The coronation is imminent.
Your Majesty should mind your health.
I've even ordered your favorite soup.
You don't need to test-eat anymore.
Leave that to your subordinates.
Your Majesty has to rule the world.
I live and die for Your Majesty.
Remember you have to stay alive.
Only then can you defeat your enemies.
Since I entered the palace at the age of 14,
I've braved through crises after crises.
Had I been careless, I'd have been crushed
I would never think of ascending the throne by a woman.
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.
Your Majesty, the Imperial Chaplain is here.
- Hurry up... - Where?
Everything is transient; follow Heaven's Mandate.
Welcome, Chaplain. Everyone, on your knees!
Yes, Your Majesty.
The astronomical phenomena have been chaotic.
An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical to disturb the royal soil against nature.
Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?
The evil has been committing crimes as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.
It's being locked up and has not returned.
Locked up? Is Venus a prisoner?
Venus originated from Yang Qui of Dee City.
Left the Palace for 8 years?
Originated from Dee City?
Does the Chaplain mean Detective Dee?
8 years ago, Dee opposed your regency and was jailed for treason.
If we release him, the dissenters will become more recalcitrant!
Please think twice, Your Majesty.
As soon as Venus has returned, chaos will end and all stars are at peace.
Find out whether Dee is dead or alive?
May I know who you are?
"MINISTER OFFICE"
Welcome, Officer Shangguan.
LIAISON OFFICE, for filing provincial memorials
The East needs 6,000 soldiers to suppress the barbarians.
The South reported floodings along Yao River.
Memorial to Public Works Dept.
The South has been such a mess lately.
After the flood came the starvation.
Tie your tongue and get the memorials.
Here come the memorials. Talk later.
The earlier we burn them, the earlier we can rest.
Memorials are prescriptions for the state.
We know the state's illness by reading them.
But the memorials in recent years show that people are living in contentment. people's livelihood has improved and they are living in contentment.
You might as well save your breath.
Ling. . . we might get involved this time.
What?
Listen.
Yes!
I hear that! Quite a number of men. . .
You said if you were to leave here alive, you might have to fight a big battle. . .
A battle of life and death.
Do what I taught you.
Yes, I'm ready for it.
Push the cart down.
20cm to the left!
1 cm below!
Turn around and swing. . .
Do it again!
Surround the furnace!
Get them alive!
Don't let anyone flee!
Protect the Officer!
Get lost!
There's ambush on the roof!
Hidden arrows! Bend over!
Nab them alive! Check who they are!
They're killing themselves as their last resort.
Don't let the assassins jump! Stop them!
Help me to grab them back from the furnace.
Yes.
You! Go after the archer on the roof!
Didn't you hear? Go after the archer!
Yes.
No need to chase.
They can come and go at ease in this maximum security prison,
They must be abetted by someone inside.
Nonsense!
How can the killers be our men?
They can even kill themselves in the end.
The leader behind is way too powerful for you.
Perhaps not for her.
This official is elegantly dressed with an impressing bearing.
I bet you're from the Palace.
No need. He's really blind.
Why did you feign blindness?
A peaceful heart will enhance my observations.
To observe by heart is different from by eye.
You're speaking my words.
A blind like him sees the world clearer than we do.
Forget it, Dee.
You are no longer a prisoner.
Can I call you Detective Dee now?
Good or bad luck, only I myself will know
This furnace is very hot but it's nothing when compared to the outside world.
A single mistake will make myself on fire.
If I don't leave, the fire will also come for me.
Struggling for power starts the fire.
No power means no fire, heaven for everyone.
The outside world is really on fire now.
Watch out for fire!
Military examination in the year 689!
On the right is Chen from Xiangzhou; his weapon will be the iron rod.
On the left is Yen from Yangzhou; his weapon will be the meteor hammer.
The tournament begins!
Your Majesty, Dee has been brought here.
You knew you're coming to see me, but you're still in prison clothes and you didn't even shave?
Years ago when I opposed your regency,
I had already been accused of treason.
Now that your coronation is imminent,
I might have to put them on again soon...
So I decided not to change.
Leave us alone, Jing'er.
Yes.
The Crown Prince was very little then.
I helped him rule as an Empress Dowager.
What's wrong with that?
And yet you had to oppose.
During my rule for the last 8 years, the state is incorrupt and the people rich.
Even the Crown Prince begged me in writing to ascend the throne.
What more can you say?
Nothing.
You men are just not used to women in power.
One can't be conservative in state matters but has to reform constantly.
Reform is good, but all new things will turn old one day.
While the old are being replaced by the new, if it also involves their lives as well, then rebellions become inevitable.
Not only men. . . even dogs will try to flee.
Detective Dee is still Detective Dee.
Your precious words are so hurtful to the ears.
That was your badge 8 years ago.
I'm returning it to you.
You shall be my Imperial Commissioner in charge of the Phantom Flame Case.
You shall work with Supreme Court to crack the case before my coronation!
Why do you keep following me?
Her Majesty knows you've suffered in jail and specifically ordered me to serve you.
You have such a deadly look.
It must be a pain to be served by you!
So lively here?
Who's having dinner in the inn?
The Prince of Lanya is having a banquet.
Li Xiao commands an army of 1 00,000 and is haughty because of his royal status.
He is at loggerheads with the Empress and has long intended to revolt.
He must be involved in this case.
You better check him out.
Having the intention to revolt does not mean he's involved in this case.
You better get it right.
These are your clothings before you were jailed.
Her Majesty ordered me to find these for you.
Only my Dragon Taming Mace is missing.
It's getting late and I won't go out any more.
You don't have to keep an eye on me too.
Have you forgotten?
Her Majesty has ordered me to serve you.
Without the order from the Empress,
I will not go back tonight.
To serve me. . .
Where's the water?
That's how you serve people?
How can the Empress stand you?
You are too weird to serve people and you're so impetuous.
Yes, I am.
I've given you the blade.
Come, shave for me.
Stop dodging if you have guts!
The Empress asked you to serve me, but don't take it in face value.
She wants you to spy on me but also to test you. . .
For every single word you've said,
I'll report to Her Majesty.
All right, let me tell you this.
She always overestimate herself and she does not believe in anyone.
If we really become together, her suspicion will turn her against you.
She won't let you off.
Why do you stop shaving?
My beard is not there. . .
It's here.
I suggest you tell her we can't get along.
That will set her mind at peace.
Let me see if she is what you said she is.
Don't make it difficult for yourself.
If you don't want it, don't force yourself.
But do you want it?
Come over!
What do you want?
Hold this.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I gave you the whip. You still didn't get it?
Don't touch me.
Who are these people?
- Protect the Prince!
- Assassins!
I've been waiting for you, Brother Dee.
Why aren't you on your knees?
I'm chasing suspects. No time for formality.
The Phantom Flame was staged by the Chaplain under the order of the Empress!
She wants to usurp the throne and eliminate old officials like us.
I'm occupied. See you later!
Dee, receive the Military Tally!
With this tally, you can deploy any troops.
In view of your loyal nature,
I'm inviting you to join my Army of Justice.
I'm in command of 1 00,000 soldiers and have a fail-proof plan to overturn the evil empress!
- Assassins? Who is it?
- Who is it?
That's outrageous.
Li Xiao!
How dare you rave like that?
I won't chat with you now that she's here.
But remember, one of these days... you'll grovel before me and take my orders.
It won't be far.
Grovel before me and take my orders...
You'll ruin your integrity.
He must have ordered the kill just now.
Why kills me if he wants to buy me off?
He wants you dead as he can't buy you off.
No.
No?
He doesn't want me dead.
It's someone else who does.
The Empress hereby decrees:
Mysterious cases are rampant lately.
Theses are works of villains to cheat people.
I hereby appoint Dee as Imperial Commissioner to lead Supreme Court to solve the Phantom Flame Case before my Coronation.
I humbly receive the Imperial Edict.
Commissioner, you do have a unique style.
You bring your bird out while on duty?
I must bring this along with me.
We can't solve the case without it.
Where does the sun go this morning?
This is the mortuary. This way, please.
The bird is afraid to go in.
Find someone outside to take care of it.
The deceased was Jia of the 4th rank,
Vice Minister of Public Works.
On the 1 7th day of the 8th month, 1 -3pm. . . he was self-burnt to ashes. . .
- inside the Buddha,
- What do you think of this case? leaving remains of...
- Go watch over the bird outside.
- left fibula...
I was ordered to follow you closely.
You want to return this badge to the Empress?
Just keep an eye on it but don't touch it.
Don't get too close too!
Shut the door!
Keep reading.
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...
Louder!
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...
You can speak now.
The murder technique is not human.
Cut the generality. You're not to the point.
Who do you think it is?
Rumor has it that the Chaplain Lu Li is on a murder spree before the Coronation to set an example.
To warn the dissenters not to act rashly.
Jia was sent by the Empress. Why betrayed her?
He's unfathomable.
I read Jia's memorials before.
He inspected the Buddha every month.
The schedule for the Buddha is very tight.
Wouldn't killing him hinder the Coronation?
You read Master Jia's memorials?
I read memorials at the Liaison Office before they were burnt every day.
Moving the amulet causes divine intervention.
The Chaplain is killing with black magic.
You believe all this nonsense?
It's evident. Why can't I believe it?
You're lying.
We both know the amulets are just a front.
The murderer is trying to hide the truth.
I thought only I got that.
So you also think likewise.
She's still spying on us.
Let's play her.
What I think of is. . . you'll be promoted after Xue died.
That makes you a suspect as well.
Then why do you think I killed Master Jia?
You killed Master Jia as a diversion.
Your real target is your superior.
You may have another reason for killing Jia.
You can also thwart the Coronation.
Don't stop.
I'm done. . .
Start again till I ask you to stop.
The deceased Detective Dee had a fierce fight with Minister Pei...
You're framing me!
Didn't you ask us to play her?
Why are you so serious?
I was acting. Couldn't you tell?
Master Pei, the birdcage is on fire!
Sir... the birdcage is on fire, Master Pei!
What's the cause?
No cause at all.
The bird is aflame like those officials.
How could this have happened?
Let's go to the dining room.
What are you cooking?
Stir-fried cucumbers with snow lotus.
Any chicken blood?
Over there.
What's he doing?
He probably found out why the victims caught fire.
Master Xue caught fire at 3-5pm?
Right.
The Buddha was surrounded by shadows as the sun decended.
But once he entered the drill ground, he's on fire.
It is because the drill ground was not covered.
So I infer that the sun triggers the poison!
Let's stay away from this.
Detective Dee!
Fancy seeing you again before I die!
We're kept alive for a purpose.
You're back in Supreme Court?
The Empress put me in charge of
Dee's position is unclear.
We can't let him dupe us.
Let's join forces to check him out.
Join forces?
I work directly under the Empress.
It's not up to you to make suggestions.
What's the matter?
Before the accidents, both officials did one thing besides moving the amulets.
What is it?
Water!
Before the incidents took place, they both drank the water here.
It is because the heat here make them thirsty.
But that can't be! I was supposed to move the amulet first.
Master Xue just happened to come before me.
If the murderer killed because of the amulet, how did he know Master Xue would snatch it and poison the water beforehand?
It should have nothing to do with the water.
You work directly under the Empress.
Do you need to hear my humble opinion?
How have you been all these years?
After I was in jail,
I kept professing my loyalty in writing.
Eventually the Empress pardoned me.
I joined the Department of Public Works, in charge of repairing royal palaces.
I was then made supervisor of the Buddha.
In other words, I've been promoted.
How magnificent!
The Tubular Pillar in the Book of Fanyanna?
Yes, I was inspired by the Fanyanna Buddha.
The pillar's base is 1 00 feet underground.
It can withstand earthquakes and hurricanes.
This is the top level of the Buddha.
Master Jia died inside the Buddha's left eye.
You were also re-enacting the case?
After working under you for so many years,
I've been used to case re-enactment.
So what do you think?
Fire turtles...
What are fire turtles?
Are they related to this case?
You also read Book of Fanyanna.
Remember the section on fire turtles?
You think so too?
You haven't answered my questions!
The most venomous beetles in Western Regions.
They feed on yellow phosphorus and their bodies catch fire under the sun.
So the beetles are related to the two deaths?
I witnessed what happened that day.
Only later did I think of the fire turtles.
You think!
Stop it, Donglai!
You knew this clue all along.
Why did you rant about divine intervention?
As a menial
I used my wit when threatened.
To be honest, even if I'd told you my theory, given your wisdom, you wouldn't believe it.
Bullshit!
Calm down. I've known him for years.
That's how he is.
Come!
Detain him for extreme torture later.
Yes!
Stop it!
The Empress has asked me to lead the case.
I can decide everything without intervention.
All of you stand down!
What other clues do you have? Spit it out!
I'm only speculating.
After all, fire turtles are not indigenous.
For more details we need help. . .
Phantom Bazaar.
What is Phantom Bazaar?
It's a spooky pandemonium.
High officials like you would never go there.
Shatuo you still remember Donkey Wang?
Luoyang City was built a thousand years ago.
The old city subsided during Han Dynasty.
A new city was built on top in Sui Dynasty.
The underground became a black market.
They call it Phantom Bazaar.
Who ordered a boat?
We are looking for Dr Donkey Wang.
You know the place?
Wang the Donkey with Scabies?
Five silver coins. Nonrefundable!
Anybody here?
Who's been so noisy? It's hell here.
I've never seen in a true villain here.
Speak up.
One... Two. . . you're still alive, Dee!
Scram! This is no place for you people!
I'm here to save you.
Save me? No, I'm fine!
I don't want trouble!
It's you who are in trouble. Cut the crap.
- Yummy... yummy.
- Now that I'm here your good days are over.
Dee, you always bring me troubles.
My luck will help me overcome them.
Since you're here, I better move out now.
Don't be so mean!
Pei! Give me the money!
Put it right here.
Look what I've got here.
What exactly do you want to know?
Ever heard of fire turtles?
Fire turtles? This creature. . .
It has been reported that they're extinct.
Could it be they exist in Central Plains?
Can you see the power of money?
You won't solve this case! Don't even ask.
You haven't answered me. Answer again.
- I've answered but you didn't take it.
- Up there.
You don't believe in me at all.
- What's that sound?
- Then why. . . asked me?
Pay more for additional questions.
Better settle the old bills first.
I'll pay after you've told us.
But you're not trustworthy.
Don't worry about this.
I promise I'll pay after you've told us.
Something is still above!
What are you looking at?
Dee is chasing Dr Wang! I'll go to see it.
It's the Imperial Chaplain!
Impossible!
Split! Can't you split? Split!
Jing'er is in trouble! I'll help her!
Donglai! Jing'er! Run!
Who is this Wang?
Why does the Chaplain want to kill him?
He's not the Chaplain!
How can you be so sure?
I'm sure because I've seen the Chaplain before.
You don't believe in me?
Hey! The Chaplain is over there!
Told you he isn't.
You're so stubborn.
Don't chase. Something weird.
Why?
But Jing'er is by herself...
She wants to find his identity more than we.
Their target is Wang. We need to protect him.
Jing'er knows where to find us.
Stop wasting time and let's go!
Jing'er
Almighty infinity?
Infinity Monastery?
There's nobody here. Stop pretending.
Take your pins out.
Dee, you shouldn't put your fingers in every pie.
I was fine down there.
Why dragged me up?
Speak up! Where can we find fire turtles?
If I can crack this case,
I'll help you get back to the Palace.
To hell with it!
Who wants to go back? Did I say it?
I advise you not to take up this case!
You can't mess with the people behind it.
It can't be done. . . and then. . . and then. . .
Look!
Your transfiguration makes you inarticulate.
Let me see.
Don't touch these two acupoints!
They are anathema to transfiguration!
Don't you know that?
Don't touch me!
What's the matter?
Nothing. These acupoints remind me of someone.
Who is it?
It's all right. It's Donglai and Jing'er.
Who is he?
The Imperial Physician, Wang Bo.
A. K.A. Donkey Wang.
He's Donkey Wang?
Could that be the so-called transfiguration?
Well, it's my first time.
That's petty stuff. What's so special?
We wasted our whole evening on him.
What's this piece of crap good for?
Who is she? So arrogant!
Officer Shangguan, the Empress's favorite.
So you are Shangguan Jing'er?
You are the Empress's bitch?
Bitch?
Speak up! Tell me all you know.
Let go of me!
We need torture to make him talk!
A confession under torture is useless.
The Empress created many cases of injustice because of torture and this will only alienate people from her.
The fire turtles you're looking for were used for the late Emperor's asthenia.
I heard about them from Western people and decided to use them to treat asthenia.
I presented a memorial to the late Emperor.
The late Emperor personally commanded
Western merchants to present him 20 of them.
We soon discovered that they had no medical value but a very lethal poison.
Once ingested, one would burn under the sun.
That's the symptom of the Phantom Flame Case!
After this failure, I fled for my life.
Before I fled, I exposed them under the sun, hoping they would be exterminated.
But in a rush, I'm not sure if they died out.
So where did you keep the fire turtles?
It's where Infinity Monastery is now.
You try to frame Infinity Monastery
You're mongering rumours. Let me kill you now.
Jing'er, the Chaplain can help this case.
Can you tell him
I want to talk to him?
I want to ask the Chaplian face to face. . . why he wants me to handle the case.
The Chaplain is so powerful.
Couldn't he just tell me who did it?
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.
Then I'll go to the Monastery to find him.
Detective Dee, you can't just go there.
I know, without the Imperial Edict, trespassers will be killed.
Please tell the Chaplain I must see him, whether he wants to or not.
You're swayed.
How dare you help him pass the Chaplain a message?
Apparently, Dee is at the end of his tether.
No need to see him anymore.
I'll handle it myself.
Remember! To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!
One needs to be committed absolutely.
If fire turtles are found in the Monastery, then the Chaplain has to be involved.
But what's the Chaplain's murder motive?
Both men moved the amulets before they died.
I don't believe in divine intervention, but there might be a clue behind the amulets.
Xue moved it during investigation;
Jia moved them while inspecting the Buddha.
I think during his inspection,
Jia must have found something.
The clue... may be in Jia's inspection diagram.
We have to find this diagram.
Pei of Supreme Court welcomes the Prince!
Detective Dee, receive the mace. . .
The late Emperor gave you this weapon.
It was confiscated when you were in jail.
After I got hold of it, I've kept it for you!
I give you back as I hope you still respect the late Emperor.
Dee, I'm bestowing this mace on you.
If I make mistakes in my rule in future, you should advise me frankly with this mace.
The Empress has informers everywhere.
And you are returning the mace to me in public.
You want the Empress... to suspect me?
My agreement with the Empress is for investigation only.
Power struggle is none of my concern.
The bitch was right to put you in jail.
You've become an obedient dog.
Dee, do you know how the late Emperor died?
The Empress ordered the Chaplain to kill him!
Detective Dee!
Get up! Detective Dee!
I've won!
You Highness, you've won this time!
No matter how good Dee is, he can't beat you!
He kneeled before you after all.
Detective Dee is a talent.
- Instead of crushing him, we can win him over.
- That's right.
But some of our people believe he's a threat and must be eliminated.
Nonsense! So short-sighted!
Who needs force to subdue Detective Dee?
To win without fighting, what do you need?
Here!
Since you're here, why not show up?
This is the mace the late Emperor gave you?
What's so special about it?
It can detect the crack in a weapon.
How?
By hitting the enemy's weapon with this mace, you can hear the crack...
When you strike it, it will break!
Men have weak points like weapons.
They will break when struck.
Dee, this is your last chance!
Your Majesty, please answer me facing this mace.
How did the late Emperor die?
You still suspect me after all?
As reported, he died of liver disease.
Contrary to rumors, I didn't poison him!
I'm ascending the throne on Heaven's Mandate.
But since I'm a woman, I'm being vilified.
You know why I came to see you?
To dissuade me from going to the Monastery.
The Monastery is the Chaplain's retreat.
And it is also where the spiritual energy of our Kingdom lies.
Nobody ever dared to disturb it.
I order you not to investigate the Monastery!
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.
After my coronation, he will leave the palace.
There's no need to visit him.
Will the Chaplain vanish forever?
Master Dee
Something bad happened.
Who is it? Get down and say your visiting purpose.
I'm Pei from Supreme Court.
Her Majesty has ordered the visitor to see her immediately.
Please report to me directly.
Pei from Supreme Court humbly welcomes the Empress.
What's so urgent that you have to report at midnight?
I've just received the news that the Prince... was poisoned to death. . . in his residence.
Detective Dee has fled!
Archers! Move Quickly!
He's gone to the roof top! Outflank him!
Go arrest him and the rest stay for the Empress.
Yes.
I think during his inspection,
Jia must have found something.
The major clues of this case should be in Jia's inspection diagram.
Madame Jia, I know you're in mourning, but our investigation is very urgent.
My apologies for such a late visit.
- Let's go. - Yes.
Two days after my husband's death, a mysterious fire broke out and burnt down his whole study.
Why didn't you report it?
I have no idea about this.
Was I supposed to report it?
Of course, the cause of fire is suspicious.
Someone wants to destroy the evidence.
It's so important and you...
- Madame...
- Madame...
Is your residence being under renovation?
There are leaks everywhere at the study.
So, we're fixing the roof earlier.
It's been going on for more than a month.
More than a month?
That means before Master Jia's accident, renovation has already begun.
Correct.
During the long renovation of the study, where did Master Jia work?
He moved to the east wing for work.
Show me the way.
Detective Dee!
You know it's a capital crime to come here.
Why do you walk right into the trap?
But you Chaplain are such a lofty personage.
Why do you need to resort to ventriloquism?
Detective Dee! You tried all means to see me.
Here I am. Say what you have to say.
I heard fire turtles were bred here.
I must ascertain this for my investigation.
Nonsense.
I've been in retreat here for years.
I've never seen any fire turtles.
Leave right away and I'll spare your life.
My life or death is still undetermined.
But Jing'er, your life is in real danger.
Am I right, Officer Shangguan?
Under the Empress's instructions, you threw yourself into my arms and tried to have sex with me.
But you gave away the show unexpectedly.
You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint...
That smacked of transfiguration.
When I entered the Monastery just now,
You spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.
Every time the deer appeared, it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?
In Phantom Bazaar, you knew right away the Chaplain was a fake.
Is it because you're the same person?
Jing'er, it's time to show your real face.
In order to ascend the throne, the Empress eliminated clansmen and old officials.
But she never knows that the Phantom Flame case is so complicated.
In order to crack the case, she even brought me back for it, never expecting that I would suspect her.
She told me the Chaplain would disappear after her coronation.
That's her way of doing things all along.
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!
Jing'er,
You know too many of her secrets.
Once the Chaplain's gone, what about Jing'er?
It's ecstacy scent.
Break!
Remember!
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!
I told you not to come here but you did!
Don't think I'll be grateful because you've taken the sword for me.
You smart ass!
They should be snared!
Where are they?
Couldn't be far.
Go find them!
You're awake.
It's good you woke up.
Did I hurt you?
Detective Dee, you're so pathetic.
The world is so big, but you can't fit in.
Why does everybody want to kill you?
The Empress also asked me to kill you, but I cannot.
Can you take me back?
Your guess is right on track.
The Empress set up Infinity Monastery to use the Chaplain to eliminate dissenters.
At that time, we did kill many people.
But we didn't cause the Phantom Flame!
The murderer will strike again.
You have to help the Empress!
Find out who the real culprit is.
Her Majesty is here!
I humbly welcome Your Majesty.
Call the Imperial Physician! Hurry up!
Go find the Imperial Physician immediately!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Stand down.
Yes.
Call the Imperial Physician.
Can I ask you one question, Your Majesty?
Go ahead.
Have you ever loved one person in your life?
Yes.
But the price was too high.
So. . . was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
It's worth it.
Jing'er.
Detective Dee!
We don't have time. No need to untie me.
I know why Jia had to die.
I saw his inspection diagram.
That Buddha... will be used to kill the Empress.
Rein buckle. . .
With the righteous sky above me, I am fearless.
Like the sea waves, the new always supersedes the old.
I am the only one who dare to challenge the tradition.
You, the witch Empress has upturned our whole Kingdom.
But I will be the one who destroy all your venomous plans.
I know the winner takes it all.
And the heaven above will help me fight for justice.
Today at day break let's see how I combat with you.
It's the signal.
Let's start!
This is the inspection diagram by Master Jia.
Pei found it in Jia's residence.
Jia found out the Tubular Pillar is different from the original design.
According to Jia's memorial before his death, holes were found underneath all amulets.
Although he did not know the reason, he was murdered nonetheless.
The Towering Buddha is 66 yards high, overlooking the palace.
It can fall right upon the coronation stage
The Coronation Ceremony is the best timing.
Xue's death was a camouflage.
You wanted to divert our attention, linking the death to the amulets, blaming it all on the Imperial Chaplain.
You also took advantage of our relationship, preempting my every move.
Be it to Donkey Wang or to the Monastery, you managed to set up ambushes beforehand.
So I am sure that it's you who killed Jing'er outside the Monastery.
I would never underestimate your ability.
Dee, what more do you know about this?
Six years ago, you were the supervisor when the Monastery was under renovation.
I discovered the remnants of the fire turtles left by Donkey Wang.
Donglai was right.
The poison entered the body through water.
Jia drank the water but Xue did not.
After he snatched the amulet, he didn't drink any water.
So the poison must have come from outside.
The poison must have seeped through his body.
Dee, what else do you know?
Stop it, brother!
It's baneful to the empire and the people.
Don't make continuous mistakes.
Since 8 years ago,
I have made up mind long time ago.
I've only lived for one thing.
She gave me this; I have to repay her!
I know you will be back.
Getting in here is easy but not going out.
Archers.
Kill him!
Tubular pillar...
Molten fluid. . .
8 years ago, you led a revolt against her.
Now you're giving your life for her.
Why did you go back on your words?
If you destroy the palace like this, many more officials will be killed at the same time.
So you'll be killing more than her.
Release the molten fluid!
The die is cast.
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar and melt its base.
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.
No one will survive in the Palace.
I know you too well.
I heard you were brought back for the case, so I advised the Prince to kill you, or you would ruin our plan.
But that old fool refused to listen.
He even called me a flunkey, so I killed him.
1 00,000 soldiers are outside the city.
Once the Buddha falls down, they will enter the city to kill the bitch.
Even you can't survive this.
Break!
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar and melt its base.
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.
No one will survive in the Palace.
The time is ripe and Heaven has spoken.
Empress Wu is wise, gentle and generous.
For unification, she shall become Emperor.
Let this be known to the world!
Detective Dee. . . You can't get out!
Once the Buddha falls down,
I'll let you be buried with the bitch!
Shatuo, your plan has failed!
I can't stop the Buddha from collapsing, but the fluid from the southwest has stopped.
The angle of the collapse will change.
It won't fall upon the coronation stage.
Oh!
I haven't failed!
After the Buddha has fallen, the guards will be in panic!
I'll now go to the palace and kill her myself.
Shatuo! Give up!
This is your last chance!
Your Majesty!
The Towering Buddha is wobbling.
It's falling towards the palace.
Please take shelter, your Majesty!
I'll go to see it.
How could this be happened?
Is it an omen?
Run! The Budda is collapsing!
I haven't failed
Go check what happened.
Is it really collapsing?
Your Majesty, it's not safe here and please leave at once.
Your Majesty!
Protect Her Majesty!
- Protect Her Majesty to leave here immediately!
- Protect Her Majesty
The Buddha is falling towards the palace.
Hey!
It's falling towards you. Don't go that way!
Go save the Emperor
It's Detective Dee who saved me. . .
A rebel army is gathered 30 miles from here.
They will invade once the Buddha collapses.
Where's General Yao?
Yau is here!
Report the situation outside the city!
60,000 Imperial Guards were in ambush in Bianzhou before daybreak!
Call General Zhang to lead 1 00,000 soldiers to attack the enemies in the east until the rebels are totally demolished.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were well prepared indeed.
Detective Dee, from this day onwards, the whole world shall know you're my savior.
May I venture to say a few words to you in front of the mace?
Preposterous!
Stand down.
Your Majesty!
I asked you to stand down!
- Stand down, everybody! - Yes
Under Heaven, with this mace as the witness, would the sacred Empress Wu please listen:
On the pretense of magic, you wantonly killed clansmen and officials.
This is unpardonable!
But society is on the brink of extinction,
So your punishment is hereby suspended.
Ruling requires power and stratagems, but right and wrong cannot be confused!
May the Emperor know her every move, and let Tang clansmen succeed her, so that everything will be back to track.
You called me "Emperor"?
Long live the Emperor! Long Live!
Officials are lazy; nobody can help me.
For the people, you stay and help me.
I've been in rebellion several times.
How dare I meddle with state affairs?
My assignment is over.
I'm returning this mace to the late Emperor.
The truth has come to light...
The world is at peace finally. . .
But Detective Dee is in Phantom Bazaar.
Whether your fire turtle poison is curable will depend on the will of Heaven.
The will of Heaven is bright and clear, but I'm travelling alone.
Heaven and Earth have no space for me, but my heart is at peace.
The sun is up. Let's go down.

Camila.
Ready?
- I'm coming.
- You'll never beat me.
My God, look at this little town.
How cute is this?
Wow.
Oh, come here.
- Hola.
- Hola.
You know, we're close to that river that used to be
Argentina's main trade route into Paraguay.
Apparently it used to be a pretty happening town.
A lot of smugglers and rough types.
Really?
I like it already.
Pick one.
Uh...
-this one. Yeah.
- This one?
Thanks.
Here you go.
You can keep the change.
Thanks.
I mean, gracias.
De nada.
Go on, ask her.
- Go.
- Um...
Buenas tardes.
Um, donde está
El Hotel Rosarnaria?
Okay. Gracias.
Did you get all that?
Shut up.
Hello?
Hola.
- Hello?
- Hola.
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.
Um, me llamo es Stephanie.
Mm-hmm.
Y nosotros tenemos un, um...
You have a reservation?
- You speak English.
- Yes.
Luca.
You stay only one night, yes?
Yes.
Actually, we leave tomorrow.
Do you know what time the bus to Posadas leaves?
At 8:00.
And it's the only one of the day.
Please tell me that's 8:00 PM.
I'm sorry.
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Figures.
- Your passport, please.
- Oh yeah.
Ellie.
"Assport"?
Ellie.
That's a good one.
You are not traveling alone, are you?
Um, well, yes and no.
We were traveling with a bike tour but we kind of went AWOL after the first day.
Yes, I see.
Well, please let me know if you need anything.
- Cool.
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
One key.
Oh, gracias.
- Ah.
- Weirdo.
Cute.
Yeah, this is cute.
Hmm.
Whoa!
First shower.
Ugh, this is gross.
Ugh.
Hey, Steph.
There's no towels.
Yeah, coming.
Here are your towels.
Danke schoen.
What did you say to those guys?
Nothing, just that you're single.
Gee, thanks, El.
Okay, I like the potential.
Yeah, it's nice.
Oh, excuse me.
Two cervezas, por favor.
Gracias.
Is that Nick?
Seriously?
He's such a dick.
I know.
But maybe I should just talk to him.
No. No no no.
Don't even think-- it's so not worth it.
I know, but...
You know I'm not--
I'm not good at being alone.
I know, but I'm right here.
Okay?
- We had fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.
We're about to have more fun too.
Gracias.
Um, disculpe.
We didn't order these.
Don't be rude.
Mmm!
Whoo!
All right!
- No no.
- Yeah yeah.
- Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done.
- Just shut up and drink.
Tomorrow's gonna suck.
Yes, but that's what Advil is for.
Come on, it's our last night.
To you and me.
Salud.
- I can't--
- That was hard.
Whoo.
What about him?
I don't know.
You think he's my type?
Totally.
He looks...
Responsible.
Should I invite him over?
I can totally invite him over.
- No. El, stop. Sit down.
- I’m gonna do that for you.
Jesus, sit down! Sit down!
He's gonna look over here, Ellie.
- Stay.
- Isn't that the point?
Oh my God.
Are you hearing this?
Do you hear this? Please don't tell me you're not hearing this.
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing us all a favor.
Oh no no, you cannot play that song.
- Ugh, Ellie.
My friend wants to know why you don't like the song.
Well, 'cause there's a fine line between irony and just plain bad.
Kind of like...
Your shirt.
All right.
No.
Nope.
Okay.
This one's for you, baby.
# I love myself #
# I want you to love me #
# When I feel down,
I want you above me #
# I search myself,
I want you to find me #
# I forget myself,
I want you to remind me #
# I don't want anybody else #
# When I think about you #
# I touch myself, ooh #
# I don't want anybody else... #
- Senor.
- # Oh no oh no #
# Oh no... #
Hey hey hey.
Take it easy.
- No problem here.
- # You're the one #
# Who makes me come running #
# You're the sun who makes me shine #
# When you're around
I'm always laughing... #
Hey, where are you going?
Um, el peepee.
# I close my eyes and see you above me #
# Think I would die if you were to ignore me... #
Girl emergency.
Sorry.
# I'd do anything for you #
# I don't want anybody else... #
# Oh, I don't want... #
You're not from around these parts, are you?
Performance anxiety?
You should stick close to your friend.
Wow.
That backfired.
# I honestly do,
I touch myself #
# I touch myself. #
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Let me take your picture.
- Okay.
- Did you get it?
- Mm, I got it.
Let me take one of you.
- You think so?
- Yeah, I like it.
Now you're my prisoner.
Really?
- Does that mean I'm in trouble?
- Big trouble.
What?
What does that mean?
- It means that you...
- Yeah?
- ...your friend...
- My friend?
- ...and I...
- Uh-huh.
No way, Jose.
Not with that one.
Mmm.
Ooh!
Oh my God.
You'll wake her up.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Silencio, por favor.
Let's go to my place.
Your place?
No no no. We can't.
Who says?
- Me says.
- Oh, you says?
Yeah, me...
- Come on, you're gonna love it.
- I know I'll love it.
I know.
I just can't.
My friend, she's in... she's inside.
Well, tell her to come.
Tell her to come.
I'm not gonna tell her to come.
Come on.
I live really close to here.
- I don't... we can't.
- Okay?
- I told you I can't go.
- Come on, you're coming with me.
I'm not gonna come with you.
Okay, all right.
This hurts.
Ow, stop!
What the hell?
- Hey!
- Let me go!
- Get away from me!
- Come inside!
- Hey hey!
- Steph.
Come on, we are just having--
Keep 'em closed.
He's mean. Oh!
- What? Habla la bamba?
Girls, open the goddamn door!
- Ooh.
- Jesus, you trying to get us killed?
- Ellie, come outside.
Ellie!
Hey, asshole.
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
Sorry, girls.
Maybe next time, all right?
You too.
Hey, Steph.
You saved me.
Aw shit. Ellie, get up.
We're late.
Oh, no no no no.
Oh no.
I’m not kidding, El.
- We cannot miss that bus.
- Oh no.
Wait!
Don't leave us here!
Wait!
No!
Oh, we're screwed.
- We'll just take the next bus.
- There is no next bus.
Oh yeah.
Why did this have to happen to us on the last day?
Everything was going so great until now.
Come on, let's go back.
So that's flight 206 at 1600 hours.
Um, that's 4:00 PM, right?
Okay. No, that's fine.
Thank you.
- Thank you, bye.
Are we good?
No, Ellie, we're not good.
We're both out 200 bucks.
Oh my gosh.
Wake me up never.
Come on, let's at least do something fun.
I am doing something fun.
You have not left.
Oh no.
Actually, we missed our bus.
But we wanted to go to this place...
Villa Del Lago.
Have you heard of it?
They say the water there can cure polio.
I don't have polio.
Villa Del Lago.
No, it's a ghost town now.
There is nothing to see.
If you must go somewhere, go to see the waterfalls or to see the caves.
- They are beautiful.
- That sounds like fun.
Ellie.
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.
Rosa.
- Permiso, chicas.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
- Huh-uh.
- Come on, Ellie, let's go.
- Huh-uh, no!
Wake up.
Dude, stop!
Oh, look at that.
Wow.
Hey, let's just lay out here.
- Ellie, really?
- Come on, just relax.
We really don't have anywhere to be.
You win.
Here, sunshine.
It will all be okay.
I promise.
Thanks, El.
- All right.
# I'm feeling blind #
# Like the sun's in my eyes #
# Since I'm fighting in a losing war #
# Tiny little fault lines cracking inside my soul... #
# I'm alive... #
You ready?
Ellie, I know you can hear me.
- Let's go.
- Huh-uh, later.
And when exactly is later?
I don't know, Steph.
When I'm ready.
Ow! What the hell?
I said I'm not ready.
Well, I am.
El, we can’t be here all day.
You really really need to learn to have some fun.
And what, you're gonna teach me, I suppose?
Yeah, actually.
I probably could.
Where would we start, huh?
The men's bathroom?
That sounds like fun.
Okay.
No, that's great.
I see where this is going.
- Forget it.
- No.
Forget it. No, you're right.
If you didn't care before attacking him in the bathroom, you're certainly not gonna care now.
Okay, Steph, I'm sorry.
If it's any consolation, he didn't take the bait.
It's still really shitty, Ellie.
- I guess you can't help it.
- What?
You know what? I probably actually should have done something.
Because God knows you never would have.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You know what?
Just-- just forget about it.
No, bullshit forget it.
Say what you mean.
I mean, Steph, God forbid you take a chance on another guy instead of dwelling on the same old one.
He said we’d work it out, El.
Stephanie, he cheated on you.
This is crazy to me that you're still defending him.
You should have dumped that guy right on the spot.
But you didn't.
And now you're hurt and I have to pick up your pieces of yet another disaster relationship.
What? Is this coming from you, the expert?
You think a relationship is when you get the guy's last name.
Wow.
You know what?
Screw you.
Nice.
Steph, wait.
Where are you going?
What do you care?
You're on vacation, Ellie.
I don't want you to have to worry about cleaning up after me.
Have fun.
Come on, El, where are you?
Oh my--
So it's me.
Um, where are you?
I'm at the cow place now.
Um, okay.
So call me.
Bye.
Hey'
- Hi.
- Where's your friend?
Coming.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Any minute now.
Oh hey, thanks for your help last night with that guy.
- He was a real creep.
- Yeah, he was.
You know what?
Probably got a flat or something.
I'd better go.
But see you around, uh...
- Michael.
- Stephanie.
Hey, where are you going?
I'll give you a lift.
No, I'm okay.
Thanks though.
Wait! No!
Somebody! No!
No!
Hey'
You follow me here?
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Are you?
'Cause you don't look it.
Her bike is gone.
Well...
Well, maybe she left already.
No, there's only one road.
I mean, we would have passed each other.
Right.
I'm gonna go inside and look for her.
Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Do you hear that?
- It's over here somewhere.
- Ellie!
Who are you calling?
The police.
Good luck with that.
- Hola.
- Hola.
- Michael.
- Calvo.
- What did he say?
- We're gonna show him.
Here, give me the phone.
Calvo.
- What did he just ask?
- He asked...
Why were you and your friend not together?
We got separated.
Separated?
How did you get separated?
It was stupid.
We got in a fight.
Oh.
Well, I am sure she will forgive you.
Wait, where are you going?
Your friend is fine.
When she realizes she has lost her phone she will come back to find it.
Senor, please wait.
Where are you going?
Calvo.
Michael.
Do yourself a favor and find another lover.
This one has a habit of losing his girlfriends.
Hey. Hey!
I am very sorry, but I...
She was with a guy last night.
What did he look like?
He was tall.
He had brown hair.
Brown hair?
You just described half of Argentina.
- Did you get his name?
- No, I didn't.
- Could you identify him?
- Yeah.
Yeah, if I saw him again
I'm sure I could.
Well, when you do see him you can call me, but now there is nothing I can do.
Please. Please.
Okay.
You may make a report if you want.
Yeah, that... thank you.
Can I ride with you?
- Of course.
- Okay.
You want me to come with you?
No, Michael.
Thank you.
I think I can handle the situation from here.
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Just because he speaks English does not mean you should trust him.
I don't know if I trust anybody right now.
All done.
Wait, that's it?
- That's it.
- No.
We should be out there looking for her.
I mean, we can still make a search party before it gets dark.
A search party?
Where do you think you are?
This is not America.
Does it look like I can make a search party?
Then what else can we do?
Today? Nothing.
Nothing?
Please, you should not worry so much.
Your friend is just having her fun.
My friend is not out there having fun, okay?
I know her.
She wouldn't just leave me like this.
The way you left her alone in a foreign country?
I'm sorry.
I will do everything in my power.
You have my word.
This is so messed up.
Is there someone else I can talk to?
You're tired.
Why don't you go back to the hotel and take a siesta?
You want me to take a nap while my best friend is missing?
Yes.
I think you will feel much better.
It's okay.
Look, if she's not back tomorrow, we'll file a missing persons report with federal police in Buenos Aires.
Okay?
Okay.
Good.
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.
Disculpe me.
Uh...
I'm looking for my friend.
Senora.
I'm just looking for my friend.
Mi amiga. Senora?
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me?
I'm looking for my friend.
I can't find her.
Senora?
I just want to ask...
- I just...
Senora, please.
Hey, wait.
Hey!
I just want to talk to you.
Wait.
Hey!
Ellie?
Hello?
- Michael?
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
Look what I found.
It was in his room.
- It's Ellie's.
- Whose room?
Michael's.
Okay.
I will question him, but only if you go back to the hotel and wait for me.
You let me do my job.
Is that fair?
- Okay.
- Good.
What's wrong?
Ellie's gone.
Gone?
We got in a fight and I went on without her.
I've got to--
I've got to find her.
Come inside.
Have something to drink.
Come on. it's okay.
Come on.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Hey'
- Please don't! No!
- Just wait!
- No, let me go!
- Hey! I won't hurt you.
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop, no! Stop it!
- Get off me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's the matter with you?
Where did you get this?
You went through my things?
Where did you get this?
Look, it belongs to someone I know.
Bullshit!
This is Ellie's.
What did you do with her?
Look, I swear to God I've got nothing to do with your friend, okay?
You have to trust me.
Look.
Look, please.
Would you just take a look at this?
Okay?
Just take a look at it.
Her name is Camila.
She disappeared somewhere around here.
That's her bracelet.
I've been up and down these roads
100 times looking for her.
Oh God.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know, when we met she was organizing a humanitarian mission to South America.
And I wanted to be with her so I went too.
What happened?
About six months ago we came to work here.
One day she took the truck into town to get some supplies and that's the last I saw of her.
Nobody knows what happened.
And if they do, they're not saying anything.
I'd do anything to get her back.
And I'm not leaving this country until I find her.
Did you call the police?
Calvo?
Yeah, he filled out a form.
Oh no.
God.
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh God.
I can't....
Look, I've been hearing things about young women, girls, who've been abducted and taken across the river into Paraguay.
I don't know if that's what's happened to your friend.
I mean, it's rare. it's risky to kidnap an American.
But it does happen.
That's why I tried to warn her.
Oh.
I have to find her.
I have to find Ellie.
Okay.
Well, I mean, chances are she's probably still in the area.
It's too risky to move her during daylight.
But we need to find her before it gets dark.
- How?
- We need to split up.
Now I'll understand if you don't want to do that.
But we can cover more ground if you do.
No, you're right.
You're right.
Okay, I'll meet you back here in an hour.
Yeah.
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
- Oh shit.
Michael, you're becoming a hard man to find.
Surely you must be lost.
You know me, just seeing the sights.
Yes, of course you are.
Have you seen Stephanie?
No.
Because a car has been stolen and that does not happen very often around here.
Wow.
A stolen car.
Did you find Stephanie's friend?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
So her friend is still missing and you're looking for a car?
Okay.
Come with me.
Let's take a drive.
Water.
Chucho,
I know you're not a bad guy.
I can tell by the way you kissed me.
Come here and kiss me again.
Come here.
Come here.
So you want that?
I want you.
No!
Help!
- Hey hey.
No!
Oh my God!
-Don't! No!
Bastard !
Shh.
You fucking bastard.
Help me!
Stop it!
Fuck you!
Oh God, get me out of here, please.
Well, seems that tonight is your night.
Listen.
Don't you move, okay?
Steph. Hurry hurry.
- Ellie. Ellie, are you okay?
- Steph.
- Are you okay?
- I just want to go home.
- Let's go home.
- We're gonna go home.
Shh Shh.
- Get this off me.
- Hold still.
- You can do it, right?
- Oh, he's coming!
- Shit. Come on. Come on.
- Hey!
Hey!
Let's go!
- Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry.
- Go, go.
Lock it! Lock it!
- Oh God! Oh God!
- Go, Steph, now. Come on, go.
- Oh shit.
- Get it! Get it!
- Shit.
- Come on, come on, come on!
Okay okay okay.
Open the door.
- Steph, watch out!
- Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Shh.
- No!
Watch out!
Wait, stop!
Ellie. Ellie.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Ellie, come on.
Oh my God.
Ellie, please. Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Hey, get off of her!
- Ellie.
Ellie, please.
Ellie.
She's dead!
She's dead!
Oh my God.
Stephanie, is this the man you say was with your friend the other night?
- Yes!
- Stephanie, get into the truck.
It's for your safety.
Trust me.
Now!
Oh my God.
She was very desirable.
What a waste.
"Assport"?
Clever.
That's a good one.
Michael! it's him, Michael!
- Michael!
- But that one will do fine in her place, don't you think?
- Michael.
- Shut up.
Get away from the car.
Where is she?
Just put the gun down.
Where's Camila?
Michael, we can still help each other.
- But you must put the gun down.
- On your knees.
Shut up!
On your knees.
Think for a second.
If you kill me then who will tell you where to find Camila?
Just put the gun down and let's talk, okay? Man to man.
I think we can work out something that will satisfy us both.
- Where is she?
- She's safe. Trust me.
- Where is she?
I swear to you no harm has come to her.
Okay.
I can bring her to you, but we must trade.
You piece of shit.
This is the only way.
Stephanie for Camila.
It's simple, Michael.
Stephanie for Camila.
No.
I'm sorry.
Michael, no!
I hope you're going to be a good girl and play nice.
'Cause if you give me any trouble,
I swear I will cut you so bad you will not even make $10 per day sucking cock in the streets.
Please.
What if I told you that you are only worth $2,000?
$6,000 if you're a virgin, but-- are you a virgin?
Get away!
Stop it!
Stop. No.
No, I don't think you're a virgin.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, you're American, not some brown peasant.
You're worth much more.
It's lucky for you my partner across the river is open-minded.
You see, he is a businessman too.
And they think you could make a nice accessory for one of his clients.
Night night.
- Get up.
I should kill you.
Then you would owe me a lot of money.
Pick her up.
- I don't like this.
- What's not to like?
- This is what we discussed.
- This is dangerous.
Girls like her-- people will look for her.
Then put her someplace no one will find her.
So easy for you.
Please.
Please.
Your greed is going to get you killed one day.
And you, you'd better be worth the trouble.
Never!
Help! Help!
Help, somebody!
Help!
Please!
Please wake up!
Please help me.
Help me, please! Help me!
Stephanie, please.
Give me the gun.
Come on.
Be a good girl.
Just give me the gun! it's okay. it's okay.

Come on, Daddy!
Let's go play on the beach.
Just going to take my shoes off, okay?
Yeah, it's cold, huh?
It's going to be a big castle.
Let me know if you strike oil, okay?
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?
I've been waiting here forever.
Oh, Dad.
The train was on time, you're always early.
- Are you starting already?
- Why? You can’t take it?
Come on, let’s go home.
You alright, honey?
You know there's things you can tell me.
I’m not as bad at communication and... so on and so forth as you might think.
I've lived in the world.
I'm not pregnant.
No. No, I wasn't saying that.
Yeah you were.
Are you seeing someone?
Yeah, I am.
Someone with a name?
- Nah, you wouldn't like him.
- How do you know that?
How do you know
I wouldn't like him?
I wish you had someone.
Who says I don’t have a honey stashed away somewhere?
You're my girl.
Yeah, well, I'm not really sure how to cook it.
You finally got a vegetable and
I don’t know if I can eat it.
You alright? You've been to the doctor, right?
When was the last time you went?
- I have a physical every year.
- That's right. They make you.
Careful. So how did you get time off from work?
You don’t even know what I do.
Of course I know what you do.
Dad. I'm a glorified intern.
I can get off when I want.
I wanted to come home.
I'm glad you did.
Maybe you'll tell me what's bothering you.
I'm just tired, you know.
I think I got a bug.
Yeah? Want to lay down?
Go upstairs, lay down.
I got your room all ready for you.
I know you do, Dad.
Ginger-ale. That will settle your stomach. I'll get some.
I always keep some ginger-ale on hand.
Honey, honey.
You alright?
- Dad...
- Yeah?
Oh my god I have to go to a doctor!
Dad, I got to tell you something
I should have told you!
I got you.
CRAVEN!
Oh Jesus!
You're my girl.
I... I know...
Through this holy anointment... love and mercy... with... with the grace... may the... may the...
About five nine, five ten.
Thinks he was white from what he could see through the eyes of the ski mask.
Yelled out one word, "Craven", and then he fired.
Jesus Christ.
Then he ran.
Didn't pursue.
You want some water or coffee or something?
You want something stronger?
I know somewhere in there is a bottle of Crown Royal with dust all over it.
You're going to put the first foot forward, Tommy,
I don’t care if it’s now.
I'll sit with you, okay?
Get out.
Get out of here.
He's not a basket case. Get out.
- Somebody make some coffee.
- I want a glass of ginger ale.
Get him a ginger ale.
We'll get him, Tommy.
You know how we react to thing like this.
Officer involved.
"Office involved". We ought to do that for everybody, right?
"Officer involved". Who the fuck do you think you are?
If you want to get philosophical,
I'll get philosophical.
- Want to get cleaned up?
- No, I'm alright.
I want you to come stay with Carol and me.
No.
- You can't stay here.
- It's where I live.
- If you won't come with me...
- Just tell everybody to just get out of here, just finish what they got to do and go.
This is someone armed and dangerous...
What do you think I am?
Can everybody get out?
I'd like them to go, can they just go finish what they do and go?
Get out.
Get out!
Craven's phone. Hello?
Are you alright?
Dad, are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Whose my little girl?
M.
Whose one of those sweethearts?
M.
...shooting last night, the daughter of a Boston
Police Detective leads our news. Emma Craven, 24,
an MIT graduate, was killed in front of her home in
Roslindale by a man thought to be targeting her father..
Cathy, from what I understand, police don't have much to
go on right now.
Lisa, there is still a lot of unanswered question when it
comes to this case.
24 year old Emma Craven
was gunned down outside of this Roslindale home on the
porch just behind me. Sources tell me the suspect in this case...
Turn that shit off.
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
None of your neighbors saw anything.
And the rain hasn't left much for forensics.
We need to go through your cases, Tommy.
You must have an instinct on this. Something.
Not off the top of my head, no.
They want to see you upstairs first, anyway.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is off-subject, but this is my daughters phone.
I need a list of all the contacts,
I got to talk to her friends,
- associates, whatever...
- Yeah yeah.
Janet can do all that.
Don't worry about it.
Blocked incomings too.
Tom.
Sorry for your loss. Anything you need from me and Mary.
And let us know about the arrangements.
It'll be in the Globe and the Herald.
I haven't been down to, you know, the...
Thank you.
Bill Whitehouse is running things.
He has every resource this department possesses.
This is a cop thing.
Officer involved.
So, will you take a leave of absence?
No.
We can't have you on this investigation. It's a rule.
Well, since it's me that's got to figure out who would want to kill me, for reasons only
I would know about, then
I'd rather get paid for it.
So the rules don't apply.
- He's right, isn’t he?
- I think he is, yeah.
I have to make a statement to the media. Is there anything you want in there? You want to stand with me?
- No, thank you.
- They want to see you.
I don't want any part of it.
Alright.
I'm not going to sit in the
Murder Room. No point to it.
There's no physical evidence.
If we got the gun or something.
Jesus, I can't think.
It'll come to me.
It'll come to me but it's not going to come to me here.
I've got to drive around.
I have to think.
You do what you need to do.
You keep me informed.
I'll punch you in.
I got to go. The Coroner wants to ID the body.
- Are you up to it?
- Yeah.
I want my case files brought up.
Nothing this year makes any sense to me at all.
Tommy.
I'll have them sent to your house.
Sure.
Cause of death: injuries arising from gunshot wounds.
Massive hemorrhage. Heart seizures due to shock.
Tom, this is very difficult.
You've done this before, but it's not the same...
Let's get it over with.
Is this your daughter,
Emma Charlotte Craven?
Yes, it is.
Leave her alone.
Let me have some scissors.
- What was that Tom?
- Scissors. I need some scissors.
Don't cry.
I'm not.
I don’t know if
I can make it.
You have to.
Alright.
You're wasting two guys here at my house, Bill.
If you want them in the neighborhood, then have them going door to door.
Someone's trying to kill you Tom. They're staying.
I got nothing. Nothing.
I don't have enemies.
I never lived life or said what I thought enough to have enemies.
Listen, you know
I understand.
I'm not stuck in a personal conversation with you, Bill.
Don't get nervous.
And tell the two uniforms in the cruiser to stop pissing in the bushes. They can come into the house.
This is your beach.
Hey Daddy.
Come on in.
Come on, Daddy!
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll be right there.
Go on.
"NORTHMOOR"
"Weapons Query"
"Searching..."
"David Burnham"
Tom!
You ready for this?
Ski mask found in a hedge five doors from you.
We got hair. Caucasian.
It's in for DNA.
- Keep me posted.
- Where are you going?
Mr. Burnham?
Mr. Burnham, yeah?
Yeah.
Settle down. Alright?
I'm not going to hurt you.
I see you know my daughter.
Are you her boyfriend?
Alright. Okay.
I'm Emma’s father.
I'm going to let you go now.
You're going to be alright.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, be nice. Okay?
Jesus.
I'm sorry but you're going to get the fuck out of here now.
Give me a minute, alright?
I want to ask you some questions.
Why not answer the door like everybody else?
What the hell are you so scared of?
Is this your handgun?
How did my daughter get a god damned handgun?
Did you give it to her?
Is this yours?
I gave it to her.
Alright.
Why?
I didn't notice a shotgun in your list of weapons.
- Do you own one?
- Do you think that I...?
Your pistol.
You licensed it in Vermont, it's illegal in Massachusetts.
I tell the local police barracks you opened the door with it that's an automatic year in jail.
Not that I don’t have you by the balls already for trying to stick me in the doorway.
- You'd be lying.
- I don't care.
I know you.
You're her dad.
And you never came to visit her. Didn't even bother.
Yeah, well... you worked with her.
And I need to know what kind of trouble she was in.
I can't talk about that.
There's security structures.
Clearance to what we do.
I understand you won't help me.
But I'm confused you won’t help Emma.
She's dead, man. There's no way to help Emma.
There are probably two fucking guys out there watching and listening to us right fucking now
Now, I'm sorry, but you need to get the fuck out of here now.
Please.
Or I'm dead.
There's something
I need to give you.
Yeah? Sure, go ahead.
Here's the keys to her place.
And her personal things.
Thanks.
I'm going to leave you alone now until you realize you got to talk to me.
Alright?
Yeah.
I know you're a good guy otherwise Emma wouldn't have nothing to do with you.
Here's my card. It's got my cell on it, okay?
Call.
You were right,
I don’t like him.
Why did you have a gun, honey?
Jesus.
Is there something I could do for you, Millroy?
What do you do usually, Jedburgh?
If someone has a national security problem... they dial a number in
And then I decide what happens next.
What's your problem?
You're a consultant in security.
I'm merely consulting.
So consult.
There's a company called Northmoor.
They own a number of defense department contracts.
It's not an agency front, if that's what you think.
- It's a real private company.
- That is unusual.
They have private security.
Autonomous security.
I'm autonomous myself.
These are the facts:
One of their secure facilities was penetrated.
Three people died making their escape.
A fourth, an employee who may have been involved has been killed.
- By Northmoor security?
- I didn't say that.
No one would.
Fact is, we don't know.
She was shot dead five nights ago.
Her father is a
Boston Detective.
Boston police are working on the assumption that her father was the target.
And what assumption are we working on?
That he wasn't.
- Who killed her?
- That's not the issue at this point.
National security is the issue.
I know your function, Jedburgh.
This has to be cleaned up.
Whatever it takes.
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure you want me to look into this?
Cause you have to be absolutely sure.
- She was killed in Boston.
- Yeah.
But this isn't a part of that.
You think it's a funeral robbery?
Yeah.
Look..
I don't want this mixed up with the other business.
I don't need the trouble, alright?
Do me a solid in
Boston sometime.
Thanks.
Hello?
Hello. My name is
Tom Craven.
Your number was in my daughters phone records.
I'm Emma's father.
I'm a policeman.
I just want to know what you were to Emma.
Find out what happened.
It says in the papers what happened.
Someone tried to kill you and they got her.
Is that what you think happened?
I run a shop.
A luggage shop.
I want to keep running a shop.
I'd like to talk to you in person.
- Would you do that?
- About Northmoor?
Yeah, sure. About anything you want to talk about.
How do I know you're you?
When you meet me, you will know that guy can't be anyone else but Emma's father.
Will you help me?
I'm out of state,
I'm at my grandmothers.
I have your number,
I'll call you.
I'm here to see
John Bennett.
Detective Craven.
Jack Bennett.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Can I say how shocked we all were to hear of Emma's death.
She was a valued member of our team.
I can't say I knew her very well personally, but she is well thought of.
She is missed.
Thank you.
In the Sixties, this hill was excavated.
The site for Nike nuclear missiles.
Miles of tunnels and launch chambers.
- I'm sure Emma told you.
- She never talked about work.
So Northmoor bought this from the federal government?
- Well, we lease it.
- For money?
- Coffee?
- I'll have a ginger ale.
Certainly.
Annie, get Detective Craven a ginger ale, would you?
- Of course.
- Please.
You have interesting friends.
Yes.
This facility, R&D in general, earns a great deal of money to Massachusetts. As reflected in the tax breaks.
How may I help you?
I supposed I want to know what my daughter did here.
In what sense?
She didn't tell you about our work?
She was following your security protocols.
And what are they in your understanding?
I don’t understand anything.
She never talked about work.
Right.
Well you'll understand that most of what we do here is classified. Almost everything we do.
What she did, despite her qualifications, your daughter was a trainee.
Of course, she was a full employee and there's a... benefit package I suppose you should see Personnel about.
I'm not interested in that just yet.
All our people are very well insured.
I bet they are.
Well, what we do here...
Norhtmoor is essentially a research facility.
We have a mandate from government to develop a safe and clean energy source based on fusion technology.
- Very green.
- And weapons?
Do you make them?
Well, If we did, it would be classified.
I can tell you, since you are a policeman and have access to this information anyway, that
Northmoor is an important part of the nation’s nuclear stockpile and maintenance program.
We ensure that the nations nuclear stockpile remains ready for the presidents order.
- Not weapons, raw materials.
- Emma was a part of this?
God no. As an intern, she didn't have any direct involvement whatsoever. She worked on the research floor.
We all very very much regret Emma's death.
It must be especially painful for you.
In the circumstances.
You mean that she was shot instead of me.
As a parent I can only guess at your pain, I think.
Though I'm sure I cannot imagine its full dimensions.
I've taken up enough of your time.
I'd like to talk to her friends if any.
Yes, of course. I'll see what
I can do. I'll tell Personnel.
Give you a list. Of contact numbers and so forth.
Can I ask you a question?
What does it feel like?
- David.
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready for anything.
- We have a DNA match.
Oh, really?
Give me the skinny.
You got no buzz of this guy? Nothing?
This guy was a professional.
This guy was a hit man.
What's the matter? You were looking at something.
Tell me what you're looking at.
It says in the evidence log the hair you found was 2,5 inches.
So he cut his hair.
Not as recently as a week ago.
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.
Hair can stick to a hat for a long time. Years.
Decades.
Why would a pro blow off two barrels with a shotgun instead of saving one for his target?
Creeping up on a bereaved man at a murder scene is not very bright.
Mr. Craven, we have things to talk about.
Like your name and what you're doing here?
Like who shot your daughter.
You know who shot my daughter?
If I was looking for a man who might have shot your daughter, and I had a limited imagination, of which I do not,
I might have looked at the poor bastard you found today.
A known killer.
An unusually well known killer. Makes you think.
- What are you burning?
- None of your business.
Yeah, go ahead.
- Cigar?
- Not celebrating just now.
I know you don't smoke.
I saw your DARPA file.
That's my way of telling you you've got a DARPA file.
Are you going to tell me what that is?
Defense Advance Research
Project Agency.
Their slogan is:
"Scienta est Potentia"
And I know you know Latin.
Sto sursum. You know what that means, yeah?
- Stand the fuck up.
- Please do so.
Well it seems like you're no one in particular.
Just some English guy, standing on my lawn, with a District of Columbia drivers license.
Thank you.
- Is Northmoor part of DARPA?
- Well, that's hard to tell.
Why are you here?
Your daughter was flagged as a possible terrorist threat to
United States of America.
I said "flagged",
I didn't say she was.
It's funny the Boston Police
Department didn't come up
- with that one.
- Funny if they had.
What the fuck are you burning out there?
Fucking Christ.
My English friend Mr. Davenport, about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds, is enjoying a cigar.
Did he put it out?
You said my daughter was a terrorist.
I didn't. But someone did.
Who are you, Mr. Jedburgh?
I'm a friend of the corps.
And I'm a bit fucking cold out here.
Pills, pills, pills.
Not like when we were kids.
When it was pills, pills, pills in a very different context.
You're not much of a partier, are you Craven?
Do you believe in fun?
What, do you mean recently?
What's your interest in my daughter’s death?
I don't like the look of it.
Tell me what you think.
Do you recognize?
Should I?
They broke into a US classified nuclear research facility, then drowned in the Connecticut river making their escape.
Now I know that sounds like bollocks. But it's not.
Northmoor isn't federal.
I checked.
So if you're saying my daughter was involved with these people the most you can get her for is trespassing.
Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.
And do the police know that you know that?
No.
You're a smart fucker.
What does Northmoor do?
What have they done?
The people who drowned belonged to "Night Flower".
Tree huggers. Militants.
New Age fuckups.
Sometimes they blow shit up.
Infrequently, and not very well.
You can look them up.
The organization itself, not the dead guys.
They are classified.
She wasn't an activist. Not the type. My daughter wasn't a joiner.
She was more like me.
If she did anything, whatever she did, she did it alone.
There's a point where anyone can become an activist.
I mean you see something so wrong, you have to act.
Even if it means the end of you.
Let’s just say she was involved.
Her companions died.
Then she came home.
She didn't say anything.
She meant to, she wanted to, but she didn't make it.
I'm going to advise my department of one, which is me, to let you continue your investigation, even if you sometimes burn the evidence in your backyard.
And you, an officer of the corps.
I'm not going to arrest anyone.
I never do.
Will you try to stop me?
It depends.
See you around.
I do sometimes like that feel like Diogenes.
You know the guy who walked around with a lamp.
Looking for an honest man.
How did it turn out?
Well, for him?
I don't remember.
But you and I have done pretty good.
Bonne chance.
I thought you were going to wait until I was a nice guy.
As a career move man, I seriously need to be seen telling you to fuck off.
You have no idea, you don't understand.
Go home! Go home!
There's nothing you can do to me.
There are times when you don’t have a choice what kind of fucking guy you are.
You understand that because you're doing it right now.
May I?
Drinking the good stuff because your job is going so well?
Is this an intervention?
If it is I'd like to call a few people that don't whack me around because
I’m afraid for my life.
I assumed you'd be some kind of scientist.
Didn't think your daughter would go for a grease monkey?
Something like that. Yeah.
If you want to beat yourself up.
And what if I said she said
I reminded her of you?
Except drinking.
Something to do with the absence of bullshit and no patience for
Broadway musicals.
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
Somebody shot my girlfriend, have you factored that in?
What do you know about Night Flower?
- Politics don't interest me.
- What did interest you?
Emma.
Look. I'm under contract.
I have a five year contract.
I'm surveilled. I'm going to loose my fucking job if I talk to you no matter who's dead.
How did my daughter get people through the security in a classified nuclear
R&D facility?
There's a rumor she had help.
- You?
- No.
I passed the polygraph at work.
What happened?
Come on, level with me here, I'm not a cop.
Now it's just you and me.
What happened?
You got somewhere else we can talk?
You didn't pass the polygraph, they just told you you did.
Emma was writing to
Senator Pine.
And at some point she went to this grease ball loco.
A lawyer to see about getting out of her...
What was the name of the lawyer?
- Sampson... Sanderman.
- Sanderman.
Anyway, said nobody could help her.
Whistleblowers always sound like psychos.
And I didn't get back to her.
So she helped out these
Night Flower assholes.
She got them in through the cooling tunnels.
She didn't go in herself.
But she was there.
How was Emma exposed to radiation?
She wasn't.
That's what I’m saying, she didn't go into the tunnels, they were exposed, but she couldn't have been exposed, she wasn't in the tunnels.
What happened to the people that went in?
There's a protocol.
It's Bennett. He's insane.
In case of a breach, they release irradiated steam.
Now I can't prove this, and you can't prove it, these are clever, clever fuckers, right?
You're a cop. You've got to help me.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah,
I will help you.
Just come with me.
Tell me the truth.
We'll get you deposed by a lawyer.
No. I'm sorry, no.
I like you, you're Emma's dad.
But you have to go.
Alright. You can always change your mind.
In the meantime, here, this is yours.
It's loaded.
That's illegal in
Massachusetts.
Everything is illegal in Massachusetts.
What does it feel like?
Hmm?
- Good evening, Senator.
- Good evening, glad to be here.
Senator, two days ago you gave a speech in which you
criticized your colleague Senator
Stafford, for his position
- We all have positions.
- But Senator...
I think the American people are asking, with good reason,
whether the price they've paid for their security is too high.
With respect, that's an answer one would expect, but how
does it jibe, Senator, with your support for secret
research facilities in
Massachusetts?
I'm curious about what you just asked of me.
If you're asking...
...about this administrations failed policies...
Senator, what can you tell me about Northmoor?
I'm not familiar with the business practices of...
Their parent company is one of your biggest donors.
All I can say about my donors is that they are
completely vetted and above board.
Senator, there is a serious and growing petition movement
to ban military research and development in Massachusetts.
I understand that. But people have to realize the importance
of R&D of every kind to
Massachusetts economy.
Now, to answer your questions about some other stuff...
I fully agree with his desires to expand...
I never had kids.
Maybe it's better not to have had one than to see one die.
No.
It's worth everything to have one.
Public drinking is illegal in Massachusetts.
Everything is illegal in Massachusetts.
Payback for the tea party.
You've ever had wine before?
Not with any pleasure.
Besides, with you, I think I'd have to switch glasses when you weren't looking.
My daughter was irradiated.
I don’t know how exactly, but I think it was our friends at Northmoor.
Later she was gunned down in my home.
And I want to know what you would think about that.
I had a source that said the
Nightflower people were intentionally exposed to radiation while in the tunnels, but that source is dead now.
He wasn't a bad guy.
No.
Now you know better than anyone cases like these are never solved.
Simply too complicated, too much hard work.
There is a lot going on out there in this world.
You just never can connect "A" to "B".
How do you know that?
Because I'm usually the guy that stops you connecting
"A" to "B".
It's part of what I do.
If I was an employee at Northmoor, and I wanted to blow the whistle on something... what would I be blowing the whistle on?
Let's take a walk and we can talk about it.
I'm not walking into the dark with you.
You're a wise man.
- Are you on my side?
- That's hard to tell.
Do you know the Scott
Fitzgerald thing about an artist who's a man with opposing ideas in his head, and he believe in them both simultaneously?
Heard of it. Yeah.
Well, that's sort of the beginning of it.
So what's that like? Not being anyone in particular.
I don't know what it means to have lost a daughter.
But I know what it means never to have had one.
Yeah.
Got nobody left to bury you.
Yeah.
Oh and by the way...
Thanks for not killing me.
Detective Craven. How do you feel about a suspect being identified?
You're later than everybody else.
Is that because you have a lousy boss?
I'm so sorry for you.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
It's alright, take it easy.
You got a business card or something?
Thanks.
Look, go on home, honey.
It's too late to be out here.
I'll call you, okay?
Mr. Sanderman?
I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to... I interrupted?
- No.
- I'm Tomas Craven.
Detective Tomas Craven,
Boston Police Department.
I know who you are.
- I'm sorry for your troubles.
- Thank you.
I understand my daughter was a client of yours?
Yes.
I mean no, we had a consultation, she never formally became my client.
Oh.
It says in her phone calendar that you and she had dinner on the
18th of last month.
Yeah, I asked her on a date, yes.
- Well how did it go?
- Fine. Fine.
She was a nice girl.
Smart as a...
- Sorry, I have to go.
- I'll come with you.
Can I ask you what this is about?
She came to your office.
She wanted to blow the whistle on something.
You know where that's from, right?
When the cops used to blow their whistles.
I can't talk about that.
I don't want you to talk about that.
But then later that night you invited her out for dinner.
Gee, you're really nervous, Mr. Sanderman.
You're about two seconds away from telling me how inappropriate all this is.
Let me say right off the bat,
I knew you couldn't represent her in a non-disclosure contract, but you probably suggested some further discussion on the matter over a nice plate of spaghetti and meatballs.
I think you had two agendas.
One, you wanted sex with her.
Hey I'm not passing judgment here okay, and two, Mr. Sanderman, you wanted to know more about what potential security breach she represented.
I have to get to a deposition in Springfield.
You represent Northmoor in local matters.
My daughter came to you, but you're Northmoors attorney.
This is a highly irregular convers...
...because senator Pine has put your name before two different governors for District Court Judge.
So you were about to say something?
I don't have anything to say and you are out of your depth and far from your jurisdiction.
You won't talk to me? I'm going to the Global and the Herald.
I'll tell them my daughter came to talk to you about Northmoor.
That you were Northmoors attorney and failed to tell her.
And then you'd be right in the middle of a big ass story saying how my daughter was the target and not me.
Is that where you want to be?
On what evidence would you say that?
I'll forge your fucking diary. I don't care.
Getting you in trouble is good enough for me.
Listen, asshole, this is not about police, okay?
This isn't about police and arrest and all that nice shit, this is about me knowing what
I have to know and the fact that you got to tell me.
Now I want to see the Senator.
See the Senator? Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm the guy with nothing to lose that doesn't give a shit.
You tell him that. And fasten your fucking seatbelt.
Look, Daddy.
Lots of ABCs
Hi.
I want to go to her apartment.
I want to see her things.
That's not a good idea right now.
I'm sorry.
I'm so scared.
Look. I would take you for a cup of coffee some day, but we have to just talk now.
I'd like to ask you things about her. Personal things maybe
I never knew, but there's no time now...
Look, honey, I can't take this, okay?
I... talk to me, okay?
Talk to me.
- I introduced her to them.
- Introduced her to who, honey?
Nightflower.
Fuck, you know.
Corporations this, corporations that.
Just keep it straight, okay?
They had a little shack up the river.
Nightflower.
- I'm so afraid.
- Who are you afraid of?
They came to my house.
These guys in black suits, asking about Emma,
I lied my ass off!
What were they doing in
Northmoor that Emma wanted to expose?
Bennett’s the motherfucker.
Alright? It's Bennett.
That's all she wanted to say at first. That he was insane.
She realized he was completely fucking insane.
Okay, whether he was this, that or whatever,
What were they doing at Northmoor?
Why did Emma go to
Nightflower?
Because she couldn't go to the papers because of the contract.
The Senator wouldn't help. You are not hearing this from me.
Alright, you are not.
I run a luggage store.
I got a three year old.
I'm not hearing this from you.
What did they do at Northmoor that Emma wanted to expose?
She had this for you.
In case...
I never wanted...
I'm just a person.
You know, I'm just a fucking person.
Okay. I know.
Go back to your baby, okay?
I never saw you.
Alright? Go on.
I got to tell you something else first.
What?
She thought they poisoned her.
You know...
I always liked this town.
When she moved out here...
She said it reminded her of Paris in the Twenties.
We have a very traditional home in Boston, and... maybe it wasn't what she wanted out of life, you know?
What was the name of her contact in Nightflower?
Tell me that and we're done.
No, I'm done now.
In her phone records it was a guy called Robinson.
Is that the guy?
Yeah.
Now I'm done.
We've stabilized her.
She's in a coma, although we weren't able to save her leg.
She has a child, is there anybody who could...
Her parents just arrived.
Thanks.
Go ahead. I'll keep you posted.
Thanks.
My name is Emma
Charlotte Craven.
I work at Northmoor,
Massachusetts,
as a research assistant.
I know that I am violating the security conditions
of my workplace, and I know I am committing a crime.
But I'm doing this because I've exhausted every legal avenue
that is available to me, and no one would listen.
So, now I have to do what's right.
Northmoor is breaking the law.
They are making nuclear weapons.
But these are not US nuclear weapons,
they are weapons designed to foreign specification
and built with foreign materials.
So, obviously, if these bombs were ever used,
they would be traced back to another country,
and not the US.
I've stolen documents, images, blueprints.
But we need proof of the weapons themselves,
so I'm showing a team of people how to get into
the Northmoor facility to video the evidence.
I'm recoding all this because I'm very scared.
I'm under constant surveillance.
My phone is tapped and I'm being followed.
So chances are that if you're watching this I'm already dead.
I...
I love you, dad.
Fuck
If another contractor asks to run his own security,
What should I say?
I suppose that would be up to you.
This is called a containment situation. I wonder why, really.
The problem is that there are things uncontained and some of them will never get back in the box.
You're scared about
Craven. Very wisely so.
But here is the damage control analysis:
Apart from Craven, three sets of parents have lost their kids.
Now you have an employee who tries to run over a single mother, only to be shot in the head by the same cop that you previously bereaved.
I don't know what you're talking about, and surely you're not saying it.
Do you know what the thing is about the dead, Bennett?
They have got lovers, friends, relatives, a billion loose ends.
Let’s start at the beginning of this debacle.
Nightflower is a pack of paranoid anti-corporate freaks.
You think three of their people drowned is going to read as an accident?
It was an accident.
And the man involved in the other incident was a Bosnian, who as far as the paperwork is considered is live and well in London, at this very moment.
You can do my job, it seems
I can also do yours.
What you're doing is not my job.
Isn't it?
Look, even if the drownings were accidental, the Nightflower bodies were recovered by a radiation team and disposed of.
- By your people, not mine.
- You told my office they were contaminated terrorists, not that they were American citizens that you had contaminated.
One of them is the only child of a mother with multiple sclerosis.
When she's on TV, saying:
"The last thing I knew, they were breaking into Northmoor", do you know what I’m saying?
Do you understand what you have done?
What's worse, me doing it, or you covering it up?
I'm just a private individual, a citizen, a man.
You on the other hand are the US government.
What I am is the guy whose only fuckup was letting you have your own security fiefdom.
Whatever they say, there was never a break.
Northmoor has never had a security breach,
Northmoor has never had an accident and Northmoor does not make weapons.
Least of all things supposed in certain contingencies best known to you to look like jihadist dirty bombs.
I wouldn't worry about it more.
"Fuck you, it's classified", still works as far as I’m concerned.
Are you even here,
Mr. Bennett?
Are we even talking?
I'm at my house in Virginia.
I've got food poisoning.
Where are you?
Oh, I'm not here.
Is Robinson keeping his part of the bargain?
- Mr. Robinson?
- Yes.
- Mr. Allison Robinson Jr?
- Yes.
Could you remove the glasses please, Sir?
My daughter was Emma Craven.
She wasn't killed in your amphibious little operation against the corporate Satan.
She was killed later!
On my front porch!
Come here!
I want to know why you, with your concerns for the planet and the human race stayed silent about the drowning deaths of your people.
Why is that?
People with families.
All of them had kids.
And one of them was my daughter.
I'm not going to hit you again.
And she's not here because of you. You son of a bitch!
Now you got a serious situation here Mr. Robinson.
See they know who you are, and you're not dead.
You're not dead, shot, hurt, poisoned, nothing.
Now I figure that's because you cut a deal.
You're going to cut another deal with me.
You're going to tell me everything.
- Come on, you scum.
- No!
I need to know something about the properties of the substance you gave
Emma Craven.
I would rather not discuss it in those terms.
Is it something she could have encountered in her work?
Any exposure, if there were an exposure, would be consistent with a documentable, procedural failure on her part.
Is it something that could have remained in her effects and been transferred to her father without much collateral contamination?
Do you mean could it have poisoned her father as well?
Yes.
What, in your opinion, would be the consequences if
Craven opens his mouth?
It's unsurviveable.
So be it, then.
Do you see a soul in there?
I beg your pardon?
You can button your shirt.
You know, as we discussed yesterday, there will be some erratic behavior.
And I regret to say this probably means you will have less time.
I know what it means.
I've been having aural hallucinations.
My father's voice calling my name as I start to sleep.
Bastard's been dead for forty years and suddenly he's yelling at me again.
- I come awake.
- You're not sleeping?
No, I'm not sleeping, I start to sleep, then I jolt awake.
There's something about the darkness.
- I don't like it.
- I'm not a counselor.
I know you want to banter with me. I don't do that.
- I can only give you the facts.
- We all know what the facts are.
We live a while, and then we die sooner than we planned.
Standard procedure with the Senator.
Yeah, I get it.
You know you didn't really let the side stand with you.
You got a lot of brothers out there.
Yeah, I know. But I like a private funeral.
Senator gets in his moods.
Not too good today.
That's too bad. I was jumping for joy.
Are you hungry? We have some sandwiches, a cup of tea?
No thank you, Sir.
Well, it's always a pleasure to meet a combat veteran.
You left as a master sergeant of a heavy weapons platoon.
Yes, Sir.
- How did you do that at 20?
- Everybody else was dead.
Did you have trouble adjusting when you came home?
- No.
- Really?
No. People talk about trauma and so forth.
I figure you come out of combat the way you went in.
I know that's not a very kind thing to say, but that's my observation.
And I know there's a lot of big bucks in this post traumatic stress thing. But combat is pretty much like anything else.
It helps put perspective on things when you're scared shitless.
What is the nature of our appointment, Detective Craven?
Well I was hoping that you could tell me that.
Why am I supposed to tell you what you want to see me about?
Well, because you're seeing me in less than 48 hours after
I talked to your attorney.
Your daughter came to me with allegations about Northmoor.
- She sent me a letter.
- What did the letter contain?
It touched on national security matters that are classified.
- What happened to the letter?
- That is also classified.
But protocol would be to turn it over to the committee that does oversight on the area your daughters letter touched upon.
Prompting an investigation on my daughter.
Opening up a DARPA file on her.
Treating her like a terrorist?
I'm not involved in security matters.
I did write your daughter, advising her she might be in breach of security.
Oh. So you didn't help her?
I'm glad to see you, Detective.
As both a veteran and as a police officer of your many years of service, but I have to tell you that your daughter, and we have to say this despite her terrible accident, was in violation of... almost everything of which she could be in violation.
- What did she allege?
- That's classified.
You know, Detective, a very important part of Massachusetts economy is research and development...
Senator. I think you're in a position regarding Northmoor, where you had better decide if you're hanging on the cross or banging in the nails.
Here.
These deaths are the result of a conspiracy by one of your major campaign contributors.
Why do you include your daughter?
Her death was an accident.
No. She was poisoned with cesium by Mr. Bennett.
I think I'm scaring you Senator.
There's probably not too much upside to scaring a Senator, except to provide some perspective.
I'm going to go now, but I'm going to leave you these pictures
I want you to call everybody involved, everybody concerned, and tell them I know everything
I need to know to throw a real box of Tarantulas into this situation.
- If you have info...
- Shut up!
I'm not interested in talking any more shit.
You investigate this at a national level.
You do that, maybe you'll come out of this alright.
I don't know.
I don't think you knew that the people you are in business with killed my daughter.
But now that you do know... what are you going to do about it?
Good afternoon, Senator.
Get out of the vehicle.
What the fuck do you think you just did?
You just rear-ended an unmarked cruiser, and I made an observation that you are armed.
Through smoked glass and our coats?
Yeah, I'm funny that way.
Get out of the car, now.
Or you're going to make a move for something on the inside of your jackets, you understand me?
Get out of the car.
Alright. On your knees, hands on your heads.
- What have you got, Tom?
- These guys are armed.
They were following me.
Rear-ended my car.
Got some ID then?
Thanks.
Not in law enforcement.
Imagine that.
What are you?
You don't think this is going to get straightened out?
Not for a while.
These fuckers got automatic weapons.
You just made a serious mistake.
Did you shoot my daughter?
I'm the supposed target of a killer. So you here, following me armed, with no credentials in the city of Boston, you're out of your fucking mind.
Welcome to hell.
A strange new twist in the Emma Craven case,
a suspect has been identified as her murderer,
but new developments today involving her father
Two men have been arrested in Boston. Police say
the men were taken into custody after their car
crashed into the back of an unmarked police car,
driven by Boston Police
Detective Tomas Craven,
the father of Emma Craven.
This all happened on
Marlinton Street...
- Bennett.
- We need to abort right now.
We can't risk killing
Tom Craven yet.
It's too late.
It's already been done.
You want to try?
Hold your hair back, your mother will kill me if I get it all messed up again.
There you go.
Perfect. Now a razor. Here you go. Don't cut yourself.
- Comb?
- That will work.
Now watch.
Painless.
Wash it off.
One more.
Can I come in, Tom?
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Do you remember when the trooper out at the airport busted Whitey? He got demoted and transferred.
He knew what was going on.
But he couldn't prove it.
And nobody wanted to know about it.
And finally he shot himself, remember that?
I don't think you'd shoot yourself.
But what's coming is worse than that.
It isn't what it is, Tommy.
It is never what it is.
It is what it can be made to look like.
There's a DA in Hampshire
County, going to charge you with the death of your daughters boyfriend.
He doesn't have a case.
But that doesn't matter.
It'll be five years of people thinking you did it.
You'll go broke, you'll lose the house.
And they go after your pension.
If you win the case there'll be a civil suite by that point you won't be able to afford a lawyer.
What are they offering you?
I got kids, Tommy.
I don't.
But even if you did, right?
- Even if you did.
- Yup. Even if I did.
You know, Bill. No one expects you to be perfect.
But there's a few basic things you got to get right.
Always do the best you can by your family, go to work every day, always speak your mind.
Never hurt anyone that doesn't deserve it.
Never take anything from the bad guys.
It's all. It's not much to ask.
Hello, Craven.
I need your car.
Not yet.
Go ahead.
Hold on.
I'll call you back.
Derek?
Derek?
Shit.
You're all fucked up, Craven.
You're all done.
Sit down.
Lie down.
Be dead.
Fuck.
- Say "Craven".
- Fuck you.
- You fuck.
- "Craven". Say it.
- Craven.
- Louder!
- Craven!
- LOUDER!
CRAVEN!
I'm sorry you had to see that, honey.
Deep down...
You know you deserve this.
We've got a cop of almost
30 years spotless service and there's not one person, on our side, who can explain his instability without lying, who has executed the director of a nuclear research facility where his daughter worked.
Okay. Ideas?
Your scenario is this.
He was accidently poisoned by his daughter.
- But he blamed Bennett.
- How do we know that?
Testimony of an altercation at
Northmoor when he was there.
Testimony from the Senator.
I can easily testify that he was unstable. He came to my house.
That's right. He made wild allegations. He was armed.
You know, you were very lucky to live.
That's true.
That's very true.
Now the real story here gentlemen, is:
"United States Senator escapes assassination."
- That's right.
- That's the lead story.
That will wipe the rest of it right out of the media.
Anyone who looks at the rest of this is going to see that something happened.
But no one is going to be able to figure it out.
That's your objective.
To make it so convoluted that anyone can have a theory.
- But no one’s got the facts.
- That's quite good, Jedburgh.
Senator, I've been making things unintelligible for 30 years.
And by the way, its
Captain Jedburgh to you.
Captain. Of what?
Very little he can tell you about.
Right. Well. Seems we have a good starting point.
What's the prognosis on Craven?
- Well, you know he's terminal.
- We're all terminal, Millroy.
Even middle management.
But how fast is he being terminal?
- He's incapable of speech.
- Thank God for that.
I understand you had a chance to terminate Detective Craven and did not do so.
You come to me. I look at things. I decide.
Jedburgh, we've got to get the Senator out to the press.
I've decided what this country is.
What?
People, who deserve better.
We all appreciate Captain Jedburgh.
Yet we would have not got to this extremity had he done what the situation clearly dictated.
Senator, I don’t think you really understand what side of this situation you're on.
Well, I think we've had a successful meeting...
I... am a United
States Senator.
By what standards?
- You got a family?
- Yeah.
- Kids?
- Yeah.
ODD THOMAS
WELCOME TO PICO MUNDO
My name is Odd Thomas.
Though in this age when fame is the altar at which most people worship.
I'm not sure why you should care.
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not the child of a celebrity.
I've never been married to, abused by, or provided a kidney to a celebrity.
Green Moon Bowling
But I do lead an unusual life.
Penny Kalisto.
My name really is Odd.
According to my mother, it was a screw-up on my birth certificate.
She says I was supposed to be called
Todd, after a Lithuanian uncle.
My father insists my name was always Odd... and he notes that all of my uncles are Bulgarian.
My father claims my mother is insane.
My mother, of course, begs to differ.
My abilities are a gift from God!
My father won that argument.
I was 12 years old when they finally locked her up and threw away the key.
I've come to believe that my mother and I share certain... abilities.
Since I don't want to be locked up with the key thrown away...
I've pretty much kept mine a secret.
Odd Thomas.
Hello, Harlo.
Long time, no see.
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Come on, man. No touchy, no feely.
- Sorry, but I love this car.
- I know.
It's too bad a car can't love you back.
What's wrong, Odd?
There anything I can do?
No, it's something you've already done.
Hey! Hey! Come on- oh, Odd.
No fooling around, man.
- Give me my keys.
- Her blood is in your pocket.
Most people would think that's a weird thing to say... but you don't think it's very weird, do you, Harlo?
On that night... you took a piece of white felt... and after killing Penny... you collected some of her blood.
And now it's dry... and stiff and brittle like a cracker... and it's still in your pocket.
In moments like these, pity tears at me.
And a kind of madness comes over me... forcing me to hunt people like Harlo Landerson... who I have no pity for whatsoever.
Sorry, Mrs. Curtees!
Sorry, Saleen!
What the hell are you doing?
Mom, what's going on?
Stevie, run honey, run!
Come here!
My life is filled with guys like Harlo Landerson.
And since I like my face just the way it is...
I learned how to handle myself.
I may see dead people, but then, by God, I do something about it.
Hey. Hey!
Shift down, man! Go easy.
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't have a "go easy" gear.
You should probably get that looked at.
Now, Officer Eckles... does being a police officer give you the right to beat the shit out of people?
Not at all, Officer Varner.
But it is one of the perks of the job.
I believe in a higher power and the afterlife.
Call me strange.
Others do.
He's so strange.
Don't worry, Penny.
I think where you're going is a home for the spirit... and it's filled with kindness and wonder.
I'm sorry, Penny.
I'm sorry your life was so short.
The dead don't talk.
I don't know why.
Here we are again.
Busted furniture and shattered glass everywhere.
Most of it was not my fault.
Except the panda bear lamp and the Biffy the Clown mirror.
- That was this guy.
- Why didn't you come to me first.. give me a chance to find a way to get Harlo to entrap himself?
Whenever we do it that way, it's always more efficient and less destructive.
Yes, I know but he had to be stopped right now... or he was gonna do it again soon.
That's what Penny wanted to tell me.
That's why she hadn't left yet.
Son, you so complicate my life.
Look.
Besides her blood...
Harlo had these photos of Penny post-mortem in his wallet.
If there's any fuss about how you pegged Harlo... just say he opened up his wallet to pay off a bet.
Five bucks on yesterday's Dodger's game... the photos fell out, you saw em-
He ran and naturally,
I gave chase.
Naturally.
Save me!
Save us!
- Save
- Us!
- Save..
- Us!
Save you from who?
Who is that?
Who is it?
EviI is coming.
And it's up to me to figure out who's gonna be holding the gun.
Morning, Elvis.

You are destined to be together forever.
Hey, Chief.
Tummy Tickler coming at ya.
You know, I'm still not happy about what you did yesterday, Oddie.
You could have gotten yourself killed.
I am not afraid of death.
Of course, I'm not ready to go on a date with him, either.
Would you throw yourself off a cliff for me?
Of course I would.
Into a river of razor blades and lemon juice?
Absolutely.
Of course, I'd like to know the reasoning behind such a request.. but, fortunately for me... you reek of intelligence and integrity.
And you reek of peach shampoo.
Just the way I like you.
- Chief.
- Morning, Stormy.
What's with the cat-ate-the-canary smile?
Tonight is date night.
So you think you're gonna get yourself some, huh?
- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
- Stormy SpeciaI.
- Girlfriend.
- Morning, dude.
I call them bodachs.
Well, not to their faces, I hope.
I never met anybody that could see em before.
- Neither have I.
- Everyone told me it's in my head.
Well, you should stop telling everyone.
I tried telling my parents.
If I told my parents,
I'd ve spent my whole life... picking winning lottery numbers.
You can pick winning lotto numbers?
- No, I can't. Stay on point.
- Right. Yeah.
Yesterday, when I finally saw one...
I gave him the finger, Homes.
Don't you know?
If they find out you can see them, they will kill you.
They will kill you.
- Little advice?
- Yeah?
Karla prefers chocolate to flowers and you should get yourself some candles.
Candles?
Thanks. Good idea.
Whew, close.
That would have been a little awkward.
You two are really something.
I don't know what, but something.
We're weird and screwed up but we're okay.
I don't know.
You are... so cooI.
So, you deny me my weirdness, but agree that I'm screwed up?
You're right.
I see your problem.
Weirdness, it can be fun.
It can be kind of cooI.
Screwed-up-ness, not so much.
You are quite weird.
- Apology accepted.
- I gotta go. Be good, you two.
It's not me you have to worry about.
Don't I know it.
I gotta go to work, too, Oddie.
- Okay.
- Later, my love.
Stormy!
Miss you already.
- Living up to his name.
- Every damn day.
Later.
Months often pass when I don't see a single bodach.
When they do show up... it's a sure sign that carnage and bloodshed are not far behind.
Morning.
They don't cause it.
They feed on it.
The more bodachs that show up, the bigger the eventuaI feast.
They're attracted to eviI like bees to flowers.
They know when death is coming and want to watch.
They don't show up for any ordinary death.
They want extreme, operatic violence and terror.
Penny Kalisto's death wasn't horrific enough... to bring a single bodach into our world.
This town is in serious trouble.
- Bye, Oddie.
- See you, ladies.
Nicolina! Levanna!
Odd, am I really sucking at this whole "mother" thing?
Well, considering their last one was a junkie... who left them in your lap when you were barely 18...
I think you rather rock, Vi.
See you later.
I'm heading this way, too.
Gonna go see Madame PearI, get myself read.
Personally,
I don't believe people who say... they can read minds or palms and, trust me, tea leaves... just cloggage in the garbage disposaI.
It's just I had this dream last night you would not believe.
Well, anything short of a 9-alarm massacre, I can top.
I'd never seen myself face-on in a dream before.
You saw your own face?
Me and this guy, we were both Iying dead all busted up... like we'd been shot to pieces or something.
You know, I wouldn't worry about it, Vi.
I mean, have any of your dreams ever come true?
No.
I know most people think you're just quirky or weird, Odd... except Stormy who thinks angels fly out of your butt.
But I know there's more to it.
You have a secret.
You're either a clairvoyant... a psychic, a seer, a soothsayer, or something.
Or you got yourself some juice with a higher power.
And I need to know.
Tell me the truth now, Odd.
Do you see death in me?
No. No, all I see is my own insensitivity... and a long, happy life for you, okay?
Hey, Vi, the the dead guy in your dream, what was he wearing?
Wearing? I don't know.
Oh! Wait. Yeah... a red and black shirt with black bowling balls on it.
One of my stranger abilities is that when I need to find someone... like right now, the creepy guy in the diner,
I can randomly wander around, and pretty quickly, I'll run into him.
This is a talent for which I have no name.
Stormy calls it psychic magnetism.
TIRE WORLD
Super Summer Sale
That's Tom Jedd.
He was my little league coach.
Been hanging around Tire World for years, although I don't know why.
His death was not caused by a defective tire.
Such a beautifuI girI-
There is something about a dead man trying to get a laugh... that just bugs me.
Perhaps because it suggests that even in death... we still have a pathetic need to be liked.
As well as the ever-present ability to humiliate ourselves.
Where are you?
Where are you?
MANAGER Stormy
When I finally have my own shop, no stupid uniforms.
I think you look adorable.
Adorable? Really?
Puppies are adorable.
Why are you here so early?
You missing me?
Always.
But I'm here looking for a guy.
A creepy guy.
Well, with you, there can be no other kind.
My psychic magnetism brought me here.
- That guy?
- That guy.
You are better than a bloodhound.
What is that thing on his head?
Hair.
It looks like a yellow yarmulke.
No, it's hair.
Any of those bodachs with him?
More than I've ever seen before.
You're not shivering
'cause of cold ice cream, are you?
I'm gonna see what this guy's up to.
- Stormy, wait, wait.
- You, sit.
You think those fish are up to something?
All fish do are eat, excrete, and fornicate all in the same water.
Fish are disgusting.
Oh, I never thought so till now.
Your creepy friend is buying two gallons of the summer speciaI.
Are the flavors significant?
That's your department.
I'm just reporting in.
Cherry chocolate coconut chunk?
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.
I didn't realize the grammar was so rigid in the ice-cream business.
Well, now you know.
This is bad for business.
Why? No one can see em but me.
Well, how could a bunch of slithering, eviI spirits... and guy who look like fungus be good for business?
Fungus Man scares me.
Can't you forget him?
I have a gift.
It wouldn't have been given to me if I wasn't supposed to use it.
- Maybe it's not a gift.
- It's a gift.
I still got the box it came in.
Here. Take my keys.
And please show up for dinner alive... because, remember,
I can't see the dead.
If someone is going to cause extreme violence... especially on a massive scale, which this is starting to look like... bodachs will not leave him untiI the last ounce of blood has been spilled.
But they lost interest in Fungus Man.
Winstons, Camels, and Marlboros.
Fungus Man has friends.
Oh, now would be a good time to run.
Bodachs.
- Hey.
- Loop me in, odd one.
I think I just achieved a personaI best in the "jump and gasp" event.
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.
I found a gateway to hell.
I'm walking back to it right now.
Most people would have the good sense to run away from it.
- Well, I'm not like most people.
- Not in the least.
It's gone now.
Or hidden.
So, is Fungus Bob a man or something new in the neighborhood?
I don't know.
This place looks like some kind of shrine.
UNABOMBER...
Theodore Kaczynski Arrested and...
Bundy Claims...
Police Believe The Number To Be...
CannibaI Killer
DECAPITATED UNABOMBER
Shrine of guys that like to make belts out of women's nipples.
What?
Who is this guy?
His reaI name is Robert Robertson.
Well, hello Fungus Bob.
Did you check the refrigerator for any severed heads?
No, I didn't open his refrigerator.
Where else would you expect to find severed heads?
I wasn't looking for any.
Stormy, Stormy, someone's here.
I got to go.
We don't know what this guy's planning to do yet.
You know what? Let me ask him to wait outside untiI I'm finished.
I can feeI that.
Wait a minute.
What's today's date?
August 14th.
The page to August 15th is torn out of his calendar.
That's tomorrow.
What happens tomorrow?
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get out of there, Oddie.
Maybe he has a file on himself, you know?
Unsolved murders and atrocities.
Chief and I could figure out a way to entrap him.
So, what's in it?
Is he a mass murderer?
No.
But I think he wants to be.
Hey, Bob!
Robert, where the hell are you?
I want my gun back!
Oh, shit. Damn dogs.
Shut up, you hear me?
Shut up you damn dogs!
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?
Wyatt is out back here burning some perfectly good steaks.
Thanks, Karla.
Chief.
Odd, I hope you haven't come here to dampen my evening.
I share your hope, sir.
Been communing with the dead?
It's not about who's dead, sir.
It's about who soon might be.
We call him Fungus Bob.
Yeah, I saw him enter the grill, but he didn't strike me as suspicious.
Just unfortunate.
Oh, you don't have the advantage of seeing his fan club, sir.
I guarantee you hell on earth is coming to Pico Mundo.
You know sometimes you expect me to walk a dangerously narrow line.
That's just because I've got such great respect for your balance, sir.
Son that sounds perilously close to being bullshit.
There's a little bit of bullshit in it. A little.
But it's mostly sincere.
Odd this is one of our newer officers...
- Bern Eckles.
- Oh, hi. We met yesterday.
Good collar, that Harlo character.
I can't believe
I once dated that perv.
And of course you know Lysette.
Bern, I want you to do a little DMV check on.. this guy Odd was telling me about.
I think Officer Eckles is a little worried
I might try to hook up with you.
Karla and the chief are trying to set us up... him being new to the force and all.
It's like cleaning fluid with sugar in it.
Which reminds me, how's your dad?
He's selling pieces of the moon online, vacation home sites.
Is that legaI?
He certainly doesn't guarantee the quality of the air.
And how's it going with Bronwen?
She prefers "Stormy. "
Who wouldn't?
Did you used to play piano?
I did, yeah, for years.
How'd you know that?
'Cause you have really beautifuI hands.
I bet you play like a dream.
You know Odd, you're a strange one.
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.
Bit of an oddball.
That was my nickname all through high schooI.
But you do have your charms.
That's what Stormy says.
Personally,
I find it rather dubious.
You know, if you ever decide to give cooking lessons... you should give me a call.
I bet you really know how to whisk.
Sure, yeah, with scrambled eggs and stuff.
But, pancakes, you really, you got to fold em.
But, mostly,
I just fry, fry, fry, you know?
Hey, Odd. We got to talk.
Robertson moved here five months ago.
Before that, he was living with his mother.
Inherited a shitload when she died last year.
Clean record, though.
Not even a speeding ticket.
How'd his mother die?
Officer Eckles is checking on that right now.
But otherwise,
I got squat on your Fungus Bob.
I can't hold him.
All right, well, you do agree that he's strange and suspicious, right?
If strange and suspicious were enough to put someone in jaiI... you'd already be there.
You're gonna watch him right?
Only because you're never wrong,
I'll put on a taiI on him and watch his house.
You go and have your dinner with Stormy.
She's the one.
You are one smooth operator, Odd.
She must love to hear you say that.
I love to hear me say it.
You better not be hauling any dead guys on my scooter.
- Dead don't ride scooters.
- Just saying.
I'd have to scrub the seat for hours.
Destroying the pleather.
I see you left your hormone spigot running, griddle boy.
Crank it shut.
This is a church.
I know it's a church.
I have a brain, you know.
You know why I call you Pooh Bear?
Because I'm so cuddly.
Because his head is full of stuffin'
Now listen to me, odd one.
I don't want you going back to that creepy room again.
It doesn't exist anymore.
Well, don't go looking for it hoping it'll come back.
- Never crossed my mind.
- Yes, it did.
- Yes, it did.
- It is a gate to the underworld... and you are forbidden by me to ever play in it again.
It's hard enough living with a guy who helps dead people without having to trek all the way down to hell to pull his ass out of the fire.
Since when are we living together?
We will be.
Oh, I guess I didn't think
"Let's put a pin in it" meant "Yes. "
You have to learn to listen with more than just your ears.
Stormy, what body part am
I supposed to listen with?
Right. My heart.
I'm supposed to listen with my heart.
Listen with my heart.
I will do something big to improve our financiaI situation.
- Your idea about selling car tires?
- Bigger.
And what, from your perspective, is bigger than tires?
- Shoes.
- Shoes?
Yeah, think about it.
A family of 5 might have 2 cars but they have 10 feet.
Not only that, but they need different kinds of shoes.
Dress shoes, winkle pickers, high-tops, low-tops, running shoes-
But not you. You have
5 pairs of the same sneakers.
- Like I said
- You're not like most people.
Not in the least.
Do you want crackers with your cheese?
We have a problem.
Crackers aren't a problem, just a choice.
- Come on.
- What?
- Come on! It's Fungus Bob!
- What!
He followed me. I don't know how.
Shit! Come on! Come on!
- It's him? You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure!
You don't think the two of us could kick his ass?
Not this guy.
- Come on!
- The sacristy!
The back door.
Come on. Come on.
Wait! Wait. Come here.
We're heading towards danger, not away from it. I can feeI it.
It's like he's everywhere.
He's in front of us. He's behind us.
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.
- Let's call the cops.
- No time.
I have a better plan.
You stay here.
I'm gonna run over there and open the door.
If he doesn't lunge through, you run that way.
If, however, he does lunge through, you run this way and
I'll try to follow you.
Some plan, odd one.
It's the best I've got.
Full of stuffin'.
Does that mean "Get on with it" or "Up yours"?
Unbelievable.
Right.
Come on! Come on!
Chief, it's Stormy.
I'm sorry to drop in on date night, but here's Odd.
Sir, if you send a car reaI quick to St. Bart's... you may be able to catch
Robertson trashing the sacristy... or even the whole church.
What was he doing vandalizing St. Bart's?
He was trying to catch me and Stormy in the belfry.
What were you and Stormy doing in the belfry?
Well, we were having a picnic, sir.
I'm sure that makes sense to you.
My guy at Robertsons house said he still hasn't been home yet.
Yeah, because apparently
Bob's been too busy following me.
Oh, one second.
- Where are you going?
- To get some food.
How can you think of dinner right now?
Because I'm hungry.
Look, Odd.
Vandalism, big deaI.
I thought you said this guy was gonna bring on the apocalypse.
Yes, sir, on August 15th, which is less than 3 hours away.
Trust me, that is the day that
Pico Mundo will never forget.
Lyle!
Oh. Hi, Odd. Hi Stormy.
- Hi, Ozzie.
- Hey, Oz.
Odd.
- I'll be right back.
- Lyle, you know that
I know guys who know guys, right?
Right. - Right.
So if you guys don't stop messing up my takeout orders.. you're the one that's gonna get taken out. Get it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Oz, Oz, watch your blood pressure.
My blood- Hey, Odd... my blood has got cholesteroI molecules the size of marshmallows in it... and if it wasn't for a little righteous outrage every now and again my arteries would completely collapse.
I finished that trinket you asked for.
Perfect.
Wow, Oz, what exactly is this?
It's a steeI heart 6 inches in diameter, like you said.
No, I said...
"A piece of steeI 6 inches in diameter to go over a heart. "
Well, man,
I embellished, you know?
I get in the moment.
I mean, why would Stormy wanna wear that?
It's not for Stormy.
I keep having this image of a... a bullet going through a heart.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Hey, Chief.
- This place is trashed.
- Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.
I'm sure you're right.
You always are.
But he was long gone.
Didn't leave a single print.
Even the chalices were spotless.
Weird, huh?
I'll give my psychic magnetism a try to see if I can find him again.
Take Stormy home first.
- Like hell he will!
- I heard that.
He heard that.
Chief, you know
I love Oddie desperately... so madly I would cut off my hand if that made any sense as proof of love.
And now I find out there's a guy trying to kill him.
No one was trying to kill me, Stormy.
What, you think he was hitting on you?
You know, this is the craziest conversation I've ever had.
Odd you're a fountain of crazy conversations.
A geyser.
Time feels like a powerfuI black wave... that wishes to crash down and engulf us.
I must run faster.
BOWLING
Why did I drive here?
Green Moon BOWLING
Oh, my God.
Oddie, your nightmare... the slaughter of the bowling alley people, is it happening here tonight?
- Now?
- No.
No, no, I checked this place.
The employees here wear green and gold shirts.
- So?
- So, in my dreams, the victims wear red-and-black shirts with little black nbowling balls on em.
And I don't see
Fungus Bob's car anywhere.
You think the slaughter of the bowling alley people and Fungus Bob are connected?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know they are.
GREEN MOON BOWLING
They got new uniforms.
Don't you dare.
Oh, Wyatt.
You said that whatever was gonna happen wouldn't happen untiI tomorrow.
- Yes, sir, but you see-
- I still got an hour.
I know, sir.
I just want to keep you up to date.
I think there's a good chance that
Bob Robertson might come to Green Moon Alley... to do a little more than just hook some balls.
Maybe you wanna send a guy out here to, you know, keep an eye out?
Any of those bodarch things around?
Bodachs. No, sir, but they will show up when he does.
Yeah-yeah. All right.
I'll send a guy right over.
Something doesn't feeI right.
Something's wrong.
Are you nuts?
Everything's wrong.
There's going to be a massacre... and I'll bet you it's going to happen here.
No, all we know is it's the same uniforms, so it's the same group of people getting killed.
But tomorrow, any of them could be anywhere.
God, I'm missing something.
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.
I need to see Viola.
Evening!
- Odd Thomas, right?
- Yeah.
Miss Lewellyn.
The chief sent me.
So you know this guy, right?
I've seen him a couple times today but no, I don't know him.
Yeah, chief says,
If you see him reach for his pocket he's probably not going for a breath mint.
- Wise words from a wise man.
- Yeah.
So what exactly makes this guy so suspicious and dangerous?
He came into the grill for lunch today.
That's it? You served him lunch?
- He was weird.
- How weird?
He had weird friends.
- He has friends?
- Weird ones.
How weird?
Very weird.
And a couple hours ago, he got very aggressive with me.
Wait. A couple hours ago, this guy, Bob Robertson got aggressive with you?
Look, the creep made a pass at me and Odd told him to back off... and the creep got, you know, creepy.
Creepy.
Hey, Simon, I've been dying to know what this tattoo means.
- Do you mind?
- POD
Well, Stormy... when I was a teenager,
I was a mess.
If it wasn't for the police academy and the good Lord
Let's just say this tattoo is a crude obscenity... that I'd rather not say the meaning of.
Well, what a gentleman you are.
Nighty-night, Simon.
Night.
You manipulate me like that?
Good heavens odd one,
I manipulate you every day.
- You do?
- Yes.
Gently, of course, and with great affection and you always like it.
Oh, I do?
You are so adorable.
- I'm not adorable.
- Oh, please.
Puppies, puppies, little puppies, are adorable.
You and puppies, totally adorable.
I had a feeling
I'd see you tonight.
- It's about my dream, isn't it?
- You said you were shot.
My skull was all whacked, my eyeball swollen.
You know dreams have nothing to do with the reaI future, Vi.
We've already been over that territory, but here you are.
Where are you in your dream?
No place.
A dream place. Fuzzy.
Are you planning on going bowling?
Bowling? Did you hit your head?
What are your plans tomorrow?
Levanna's birthday is Sunday, but tips are reaI good on a Sunday so I was gonna work it and celebrate her birthday tomorrow instead.
A lot of people died in that dream of yours, huh Odd?
Yeah, they did.
Your dreams ever come true?
Sometimes.
I thought so.
Close your eyes, Vi.
In your dream what do you see?
- What do you hear?
- All right.
I'm running.
There's suddenly lots of flashing lights with... old-fashioned kiddie music.
And then I hear a big crowd, a roaring one.
Like in a big football stadium.
And then there's the sound of water, gushing water.
How do you die?
It's like someone hit me with a baseball bat, quick, like twice.
I scream and fall to my hands and knees.
My hands slip, slippery.
What are you slipping on?
Oh, God. Blood.
There's blood everywhere.
What's under the blood, under your hands?
A floor, grass, concrete?
I'm staring at the dead man.
Do you know him?
Do you recognize him?
Oh, dear Lord, Odd.
So many dead bodies.
Odd, you have to stop this from happening.
Oh, Odd, is there any hope this could pass?
If you listen to Oddie, you'll be just fine.
No.
Fate is not a straight road.
There are many forks in it.
You have the free will to choose which one you take, but... sometimes it will bend around... and bring you straight back to that same stubborn fate.
I just wanna check on the girls.
They're so beautifuI, Viola.
And they're such good girls.
They're lucky to have you.
That's what everyone says.
Odd?
- Anything wrong?
- No.
No, no, no. I just wanted to make sure the girls were safe.
And with the bars on the windows
I taught them how to work the emergency release myself.
Well, looks like everything's a- okay in here.
Step one, do not stay here.
I'll go to my grandma's.
Don't tell your grandma you're coming.
Don't tell the girls where you're going.
I don't want you overheard.
- By who?
- By anyone.
Or anything. Just go with it.
Step two is don't go bowling if for some reason you get the itch.
I can't believe we're leaving those horrid things... hovering around those sweet girls.
They won't hurt em.
They just want to smell em before they die.
God.
Look, Stormy, there's nothing
I can do about bodachs, okay?
And right now
I wouldn't even if I could.
I need em to help me see the danger coming so I can maybe prevent it.
And when they eventually find out that you can see them?
Oddie, will you ever leave here?
Well, I sure hope I don't end up like
Tom Jedd hanging out at Tire World.
I meant while you're alive.
Hey. Hey, Stormy.
Hey, hey. Look, look.
Look, Stormy, if you want us to go, I'll go.
It's not that. It's-
I am just so scared for you, Oddie.
So scared, ever since
I saw that creep Fungus Bob.
I'm sorry. I just-
I love you so much.
My Pooh Bear.
I promise you on the other side of tomorrow...
I will have all my stuffing intact.
That must be for you.
Oh, God!
I heard the scream.
She ran across my yard.
I saw the dogs following her.
I grabbed my gun.
I shot the dogs.
It's on.
All right. Here's what we know.
Lysette left my barbecue with
Officer Eckles at around 7:45.
He dropped her off at home clocked in at 8:00, and was manning the front desk when he got the call.
So somewhere between 8:00 and midnight,
Lysette was whacked in the eye and then tied up and gagged and hauled all the way the hell out here and had two Rottweilers sicked on her.
Hey, Chief. What's with the guy who shot the dogs?
His name's Kevin Goss.
He was teaching a class from 6:00 to 10:00... then he went to Starbucks till they closed at midnight.
He got home about two minutes too late.
Sir? I've actually seen those Rottweilers before.
They belong to Bob Robertson.
All right!
I want an A. P. B. put out on this guy now!
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.
Simon, I want you to go back over to Robertson's house.
I'll have a search warrant in the morning as soon as the courthouse opens.
Sir, no offense, but I wasted most of the day staking out that house.
Then I went to the bowling alley and stayed there untiI they closed.
Nothing happened.
Nobody showed.
It was a complete waste of my time.
Sir, are we sure this Robertson character isn't just a wild goose chase?
Exactly where were you between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00?
- He was with me the whole time.
- Just ease up.
Now go check the house again and ask around about the dogs.
Yes, sir.
You two.
Home.
Go, now!
I think you should wear this.
Try not to laugh.
Oddie, you are not responsible for every death you can't prevent.
She died.
And if Fungus Bob was her killer,
I was either slow or stupid.
Choose your weapon.
Why would Fungus Bob kill Lysette?
What's the connection?
It makes no sense.
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just has to satisfy some sick urge.
Maybe he's warming up.
I think the chief just sent some detectives to protect you.
I don't need protecting.
Actually I think it might just be surveillance.
Fungus Bob followed me to the church.
I bet the chief is hoping he'll sniff me out again.
If the chief is using you as bait... he should at least ask if you mind having a hook in your ass.
Oh, man, I got to stay focused.
Good. You keep an eye on my girI.
August 15th had begun.
Time was running out.
Hey, Bob.
You're not planning on getting up, are ya?
But if you're dead... who's gonna massacre Pico Mundo?
Gun on the floor, dead guy in my tub.
I know a setup when I see one.
But if I call the police, the chief will have to arrest me... and I won't be able to stop the catastrophe from happening.
Oh, my God!
Oh, you are creeping me out.
You're freezing cold, Bob.
Your rigor mortis is way advanced.
You know... the chief said you didn't leave any fingerprints.
He didn't leave a single print.
And Stormy never actually saw you.
- Come on!
- What?
Because you were already dead.
And the whole time in the church, you were actually a pissed-off poltergeist.
I think the last time
I saw Fungus Bob alive... was when he left his house right before I broke into it.
He's been haunting me ever since, blaming me for his death.
Why he blames me or who the hell killed him is a little hazy.
If I'm caught,
I'll either be arrested for murder or rolling what looks like the biggest joint ever.
It's just me, Rosalia!
Damn it.
Oh, give me a break.
It's just me, again, Rosalia.
I'm gonna borrow your car again, okay?
If I'm being framed, why the police have failed to arrive and arrest me... or the murderer hasn't come to kill me, I do not know.
All right, Bob, where can I put you to quietly decompose for a while... before someone finds you and has a new love of Jesus scared into em?
Interesting story, Bob.
After the federaI government abandoned this prison... it went through a long series of owners.
Rumor has it that at Von Zipper's
Burgers the fries were delicious... and the free-soft-drink-refill policy was generously honored.
And yet, this fine dining establishment... never succeeded in winning over the family-dining crowd... which is so essentiaI to any restaurant operation.
Welcome to the gas chamber.
A lot of people died in here, Bob.
You should feeI right at home.
Stormy's always joking about running off to Las Vegas and getting married.
But I tell her Vegas is packed with dead people and bad guys... and I'd just end up fighting eviI 24-7.
I should have listened to her.
Too many.
Too many.
The chief.
I need the chief.
Dear Lord.
If that's you again, Odd, we are going to have words!
Oh, my God.
No offense, Odd Thomas, but I can't think of anybody... who could come in here right now and not get my back up.
- So you think he knew the shooter?
- Had to.
Which means it's probably somebody I know, too.
- How bad is he?
- Bad.
- Well, he's a fighter.
- He better be.
- Hey, Bern.
- Ma'am.
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
- Hey.
- Oh Oddie.
Keep those reporters out of here.
You, on that door.
- Sorry, no press inside.
- Comin through.
You saved his life, Oddie.
Where's this bullet?
That's the one they're trying to dig out of him now.
Time is up.
Pico Mundo is awakening to a horror that only I can stop.
Lysette and Fungus Bob are dead.
The chief is in the emergency room.
There's hoards of bodachs swarming all over town.
Whatever's coming is gonna be big.
I'm scared, and I'm supposed to be fearless.
- Don't tell me to stay home today.
- Please stay home today.
- I will if you stay home with me.
- We've been through this.
I have to do whatever I can to stop it.
Is Viola going to be shot dead?
You know I don't know that for sure.
She's had it hard in life.
She doesn't need this.
Shot dead? Really?
Who does need it?
Oh, I don't know why I try to reason with you.
I always lose.
You're a fabulous man of action, odd one.
You don't need to be a good debater, too.
Besides, you said yourself... any road I choose could lead me right back to the same fate.
So, which is it?
Do I have free will?
Am I in God's hands?
Or is it both?
Have I ever told you you've got a lot of issues?
I'm a woman. We all have issues.
It's what keeps us interesting, and you men interested.
Oh, yeah? It's what makes us crazy and die younger.
Do you love me?
I love you more than life itself.
See? It's working.
Don't look back. Don't look back.
Give him strength.
Knock, knock.
I'm hoping Bob left a clue on his computer.
Something to lead me to his partner... to the person who was planning on killing 100s, if not 1000s of people.
Hey.
Loop me in, odd one.
Where are you?
I'm walking towards the fridge.
Yours, mine, or Fungus Bob's?
Don't "uh-huh" me. I told you... you are not allowed to go playing around in any more hell gates.
Next!
Oh, God. Cockroaches.
Always cockroaches.
- Odd Thomas, did you hear me?
- Which part?
I can't believe you went back there.
Every time you don't listen to me, you get yourself into trouble.
- I wish I'd listened to you.
- You get out of there right now.
Right, right. Leaving. Leaving.
Never heard you make that sound before. Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?
Fingers.
Please say they're attached to someone's hand.
Sorry.
Get out of there, Oddie.
Someone has been buying a lot of Burke and Bailey's.
Yeah? Well, you tell whoever's buying it that our ice cream... may be the best, but it'll still melt in hell.
- I'm calling the police.
- No.
No. Wait.
I'll leave here first.
Then I'll call 'em.
Be carefuI.
Don't worry.
Hey, Bob.
I guess when I began to out you, word somehow spread... and you became a liability to your partner and he had to kill you.
Sorry about that.
I find it funny how I know more about dead people than dead people.
This is our realm, Bob.
You can't physically harm a living person.
But there is that.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Gas.
I'm exhausted, I'm lost, and somewhere along the way...
I missed an important clue that could take me home.
The bullet through the heart.
It wasn't about the chief.
God.
Enough already, Bob. Please.
My three least favorite words.
Some.. assembly... required.
Simon, I've been dying to know what that tattoo means.
Let's just say this tattoo is a crude obscenity.
It's Varner.
I once had a run-in with some deviI worshipers.
I should've known.
P- O-D. Prince Of Darkness.
No wonder Varner was suspicious when I told him...
Fungus Bob had gotten aggressive with me an hour earlier.
This guy Bob Robertson got aggressive with you?
He had already killed Bob
5 or 6 hours before that.
And that police van protecting Stormy?
That must've been Varner waiting to follow me home... to bust me for Fungus Bob's murder.
Or shoot me while resisting arrest.
There were no bodachs around Varner.
But I can still feeI myself being drawn to him... and to the place where he's about to commit mass murder.
GREEN MOON MALL
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.
Oh, God, no.
POLICE
Hey, Nell,
I see what the problem is.
Stormy.
You are eating and reading at the same time.
How about I eat and you read?
No? Not so good? Okay, fine.
All right, Varner, where are you?
SECURITY
Fungus Bob didn't just have one kill buddy.
He had two.
One more, and they could buy group health insurance or form a rock band.
Officer Eckles is checking that right now.
I don't know what this
Odd Thomas character knows... but I know that Robertson is stupid and careless... and he's gonna get us nailed if we don't do something.
Relax.
Did Robertson ever find those photos at the mall he misplaced?
I said, relax.
I'll take care of him.
Stalking someone at the mall, Bern?
Robertson, that idiot.
We got to make it look like an accident.
Oh, it'll look like an accident all right.
When I find Robertson,
I'm gonna kill him.
Already been there, done that.
Looks like their plan was to jump out at the end of the mall disaster like heroes responding to the call.
But I never saw any bodachs around Eckles, either.
The presence of the bodachs tipped me off to Fungus Bob... but not to his two co-conspirators, which now seems... intentionaI.
As if the bodachs knew of my gift, as if they know I can see them.
The bodachs have been manipulating me.
I'm gonna finish you off, old man.
Four.
Well, that's just jiffy.
This just so happens to be my very favorite book.
The WonderfuI Wizard Of Oz.
Officer Varner Prince of Darkness,
Officer Varner, Prince of Darkness.
Viola.
- Viola! What are you doing here?
- Odd! Geez!
- You scared the-
- What are you doing here?
We had to pick out a birthday present for Levanna.
And Nicolina wanted to get a card for her big sister.
Look, your dream, it's happening right here, right now.
I thought in a big stadium or at the water park or a bowling alley.
Ladies, I need you to take Viola and get her out of here, okay?
Come on.
Come on, come on. Go on.
This made Dorothy so very angry... that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near... and dashed it all over the wicked witch.
And then the wicked witch said...
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"
There's suddenly lots of flashing lights.
With old-fashioned kiddie music.
And then I hear a big crowd.
And then there's the sound of water, gushing water.
Bye, Nell.
Bye, Stormy.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry!
Move, move. Excuse me!
A gun! He's got a gun!
Stormy and I are destined to be together forever.
Gypsy Mummy gave us a card that said so, for a single quarter... what other couples couldn't buy at any price.
No!
Get out of the way! Get off!
Hi.
Odd!
Odd!
It's not over.
It's not over.
It's not over. It's not over.
Hey Chief. What's with the guy who shot the dogs?
His names Kevin Goss.
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?
He's got a gun!
- Is this your truck?
- I need a drill!
Do you have a drill?
I need to get this open!
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop. Now look!
You see that woman?
Some maniacs just shot up the mall!
So either get with me, get behind me, or get out!
I got a grinder!
Oh, my God.
Everyone get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out!
Now!
Hey!
Shit!
You really set yourself up, asshole!
It's cold in the desert.
I could tell my stuffing wasn't entirely intact.
He's awake. He's awake!
But it was nothing they couldn't stitch back together.
Karla told me that the chief had come through just fine... and somehow managed to spin Fungus Bob's corpse... into a bizarre cover story that kept my secret a secret.
An FBI expert on television said that if you hadn't gotten those explosives out of there, at least 500 or 600 people would've died, for sure.
They told me events at the Green Moon
Mall had made headlines everywhere.
But I didn't want to read or see anything about it.
According to Eckles... he and Varner started a satanic cult when they were teenagers.
One night, they killed a man and realized they enjoyed it.
So they kept at it, eventually joining the police force for better cover.
They met Robertson and Goss and came up with a plan... to infiltrate a small town and then slowly kill it.
Odd! Odd! Odd!
DetaiI, present arms.
ODD SAVES
MARRY ME ODD!
ODD WORLD
IN ODD WE TRUST
When I'm with you,
I don't have to worry about pancakes or poltergeists.
When I'm with you,
I'm with my destiny.
Where you live, I flourish.
We ate food that wasn't healthy.
We drank too much... and slept too much... but could never kiss enough.
Everything was just as I wished.
- Yeah?
- Odd, it's us. Open up.
- Hey, guys.
- We have been calling you, Oddie.
I know. You know,
I disconnected the phone... because the reporters won't leave me and Stormy alone.
- Son.
- Do you want some-
You've been here long enough.
We think it's time to stop.
Sweetheart, the coroner finally released her poor body.
A part of me knew... from the moment I saw her behind the ice cream counter.
But the truth hurt too much to accept.
Her death would have been one wound too many that day.
And I think I would have let go of this life.
She's here, isn't she?
You got to let her go.
She deserves to move to her next life.
Son... it's just time.
I love you.
I promise I will see you again.
Okay?
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING PICO MUNDO
COME BACK AGAIN SOON
Stormy always believed that life is not about how fast you run... or with what degree of grace.
That this life is a boot camp, that we must persevere through all the obstacles and hardships to earn our way into the next life.
To be with her again, I will have the perseverance of a bulldog.
But sometimes, it seems to me... the training is unnecessarily painfuI.
If I live an average life-span...
I'll have another 60 years before I see Stormy again.
That will be a long wait.
But I am a patient man.
And I have much to do.
Subs: titler
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6. Return to base.
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.
You look pale. Everything okay?
Sean?
Sean?
Hey.
Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you.
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...
He's calling me three times a day.
I hear more from him now than I did when we were together.
What is it with guys?
I gave notice.
- Ticket?
- Notice?
May I see your ticket?
I, uh...
Hey. Hey.
You're acting a little strange this morning. You okay?
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
We're gonna try, sir.
Hey, Grandpa, what the heck was the delay back there?
I just punch the tickets, sir.
I should punch your face.
Sean? Did I do something?
Look, I can see that you think you know me, but I don't know who you are.
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Sean, that's...
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
I feel sick.
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey, mister!
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Thanks.
What is that?
Chicago.
All aboard.
Doors are closing.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
You okay there, Captain?
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Did you see that?
You're kind of freaking me out.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Are you all right?
I don't know what's going on.
Talk to me, Sean.
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.
We'll figure out whatever's going on here, okay?
This doesn't belong to me.
Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.
Captain
Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, do you copy?
Where am I?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?
Adjusting your rotation.
Can you report at this time?
What is this? What is this?
Where...
Who am I talking to?
Captain, report what you saw.
What? I don't understand.
Where were you before you were talking to me?
There was an explosion.
Coming from where?
Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage, Captain.
Do you have a visual signal?
Who are you?
You already have that information, Captain.
- I do?
- Recall my name.
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.
I...
I was on a mission.
I was flying, and then I woke up on a train.
And now I'm here.
I need to be briefed.
What unit is this?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Who?
Stand by for thread one of alpha memory pattern.
What is Beleaguered Castle?
The exercises will assist you.
Memory thread one.
Listen to the following passage.
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
"In her hand were five playing cards."
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,
"nine of clubs,
"three of hearts, nine of hearts."
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.
Thread two. The following is a recording of a Western Screech Owl.
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.
Acknowledge end of pattern.
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.
Go for pattern recall.
Arrange the five playing cards in order of descending value, irrespective of suit.
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.
The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name.
What was that name?
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.
Recall my name.
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified that I'm stateside?
Who bombed the train, Captain?
What?
Who bombed the train?
A woman kept calling me Sean.
That is incidental.
Think, Captain. Remember back.
Who bombed the train?
I don't know who bombed the goddamn train.
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?
You will have eight minutes, same as last time.
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?
I need to know where I am.
What is the location and condition of my crew?
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?
You are obligated to give me this information.
Start with the bomb.
Where is it? What does it look like?
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?
- Right.
- Find the bomb, and you will find the bomber.
Find the bomb. Wait, no, I...
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.
Okay. That's good.
And I signed up for an LSAT course.
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.
LSAT.
Know any good gurus?
She got your shoe.
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?
It's the same train, but it's different.
Deep.
I hope it's different. I feel the same way.
What?
- Do I have...
- Bryan.
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.
What is...
This looks so real.
I think it's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible.
Unbelievable detail.
Ticket? May I see your ticket?
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.
- Ticket?
- The distraction.
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?
Hey, Grandpa, what the hell was the delay back there?
- What are you late for?
- What?
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?
Yeah.
He is a comedian.
Sit down.
Freak.
Fans.
That's the guy.
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.
We talked about him.
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Glenbrook Station.
Yeah, but by 1:00 the bridge is gonna be jammed.
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
Just let me get it, okay?
Hey, mister!
Hey!
Hey! You dropped this.
Thanks.
All aboard.
Doors are closing.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
The explosion came from behind me.
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.
I got time for you.
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Holy shit.
Goodwin?
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?
Uh...
Should I...
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...
Okay, um...
I'm just gonna leave it.
Okay?
I'll be late.
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,
I need all of you to turn off any personal electronic devices until we pull into the station, okay?
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.
Thank you. It's just a precautionary measure. Nothing to worry about.
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?
Sir? Sir.
Is there a problem here, sir?
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?
- Sean?
- Turn it off.
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?
Hey!
Sean! What are you doing?
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.
That's not a good idea.
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.
He's not any more real than you are.
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?
Not gonna be a next time.
Stabilize.
Lower your pulse.
Did you find the bomb?
Yes.
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.
It's not a concern, Captain.
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.
That's irrelevant, Captain.
I want to talk to your commanding officer!
You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!
You've been with us for two months.
Did you ID the bomber?
No. Where's my unit?
And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.
What lives?
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?
I need to be briefed.
Sir, I need to give him something.
That's fine. Go ahead.
Okay.
Get ready to send him back in.
We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do all the profiles right now.
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time, a bomb exploded on a commuter train outside of Chicago, killing everyone on board.
And that's the train that you've been on.
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.
A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.
Every second spent explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk.
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.
Now, did you find the bomb?
In the restroom.
Ventilation panel above the sink.
Cell phone detonator.
Are we done?
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.
Good.
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion.
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train.
So, one of those calls was made by our bomber.
Do you remember a freight train passing by just before the explosion?
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train, which means the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made.
Fifty-two callers.
One of those is our bomber.
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car. Get to know them.
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn.
Who seem nervous.
As always, you will have eight minutes.
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?
Yes.
I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Charge the drivers.
Okay. Has my father even...
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
Watch it.
You're kind of quiet today.
Just got a lot on my mind.
Careful.
Yikes.
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Ticket?
That was very kind of you.
You're very decent.
Thank you.
You're real.
Ticket?
- How's everything today?
- It's good.
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.
I meant behavior on the train.
Does anything, anybody seem strange to you?
You're a little strange.
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?
Are you drunk or something?
Come here.
Come here for a second.
Come on.
Think of it as a game.
A game?
Wow.
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.
That's what's so terrifying about them.
Maybe there's a team at work.
The sleeping giant in cahoots with the minister and Denoff there.
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.
I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.
You're funny.
Damn it.
What about that guy?
Deposition.
What about the woman who's sitting across from him?
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.
You talk to these people more than I do.
Right, right. And the guy behind her, he's late for an audition, right?
That or a court appearance.
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI. I know.
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?
Uh-oh.
Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.
Did anyone else come out of that bathroom today?
Well,
I saw you coming out of there.
- Me?
- Yes.
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Me?
Hey, mister!
- Hey.
- Hold on.
Hold on a second. Just hold on a second.
There's gotta be something in here.
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.
A broken phone? What is this?
Glenbrook Station.
Christina?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey. Hey, come with me.
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.
You're kind of freaking me out.
I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I have a really bad feeling about this train, and I think that we should get off. Okay?
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.
Come on. Come with me.
So, what now?
Wait for me, right here.
I'll be right back.
- Your attention, please.
- Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...
Hey.
You ready to get that coffee now?
Sorry, yeah. Just one more second, okay?
Oh, for God's sake.
Feeling sick?
It's motion sickness.
I get it all the time.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?
No. I don't have one.
Sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.
You know, you have no right.
What are you doing? Give me my bag back!
Are you crazy?
- Where are they?
- Sean?
Get back!
Sean, what are you doing?
Sean, what's going on?
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?
Sean! Sean!
It wasn't you.
What the hell's wrong with you?
- No!
- Are you insane?
No! No! No!
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?
Get away from me, please!
Sean. Sean! Get up! Sean?
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!
- Sean! Sean!
- Give me your hand! Get off the track!
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!
Sean! Sean!
Cold.
Goodwin?
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy? Please respond.
It's freezing in here. What's going on?
What was that?
He's in trouble.
I think the oxygen just went out.
Goodwin?
Goodwin!
Find a way to get through to him.
What is it?
What's going on?
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.
- Sir?
- Please!
There's not a whole lot we can do from here.
If nothing changes, how much time does he have?
Some.
But not a lot.
There are four principal dialects of Arabic.
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese and North African.
We will now play you portions of each, discussing their differences.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
They were the queen of spades, the four of clubs...
Goodwin, you out there?
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?
This is Captain Stevens. Do you copy?
Captain Stevens?
The capsule lost power.
The capsule?
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?
You should know. Who are you?
Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.
You invented this thing, right?
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?
I am. Were you able to locate the information we need, Captain?
That's a negative, sir.
I was unable to find the bomber, but I did save a passenger on the train.
I got her off safely. A woman.
Captain? It's gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train.
They are outside the mission.
But she survived.
And maybe the rest could, too.
She survived, but only inside the source code.
None of them can be saved.
What is the source code?
It's quantum mechanics. Parabolic calculus.
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.
Fine.
When a light bulb is turned off, there's an after-glow, a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?
- Yes.
- Of course.
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged, just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.
Now, there's another peculiarity about the brain.
It contains a short-term memory track that's approximately eight minutes long.
Like a convenience store security camera that only records the last portion of the day's activity on its hard drive.
Now, in combining these two phenomena, circuitry that remains viable post-mortem and a memory bank that goes back eight minutes, source code enables us to capitalize on the overlap.
Sean Fentress died on that train.
Of all the passengers aboard, he was your best link.
You two share compatibility in terms of gender, body-size, and your synaptic maps.
What happens after the eight minutes?
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.
You cannot exist inside the source code beyond Fentress's eight minutes.
Source code is not time travel.
Rather, source code is time reassignment.
It gives us access to a parallel reality.
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy, but source code empowers us...
No, but I saved one person.
That girl that's always sitting across from me.
I pulled her off the train.
Give me her name.
Christina. I don't remember her last name.
Her name was Christina Warren.
- Yes.
- She was 28.
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.
Died this morning on the train.
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.
No, she isn't.
Believe me. She is.
Believe me!
She saw me get hit by the express train.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.
What second attack?
The train was just the beginning, a letter of intent.
What aren't you telling me here?
We have information that downtown Chicago is the next target, and they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.
Do you have any idea how many people would die if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?
We're evacuating as we speak.
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?
If you find the bomber, his second attack, the real attack, we think, can be prevented.
We have very little time left. Out here, the clocks only move in one direction.
Charge the drivers.
On the upper deck of the next carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.
It's a small office containing a strongbox.
Inside is a loaded handgun.
Get to it. You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
You're still here.
Of course I am.
Guess what?
You quit your job and you enrolled in an LSAT course.
Good guess.
Soda can.
Coffee spill.
Listen to me.
Don't answer this.
You deserve better than that guy.
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect, doesn't it?
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...
Not that well, apparently.
Do you know me well enough that if I did something that looked a little strange and was maybe even a little bit dangerous, but I told you to trust me anyway, that you could do that?
No.
Wow. That was honest.
You're beautiful. You're kind.
And you're painfully honest.
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?
It's the new me.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Ticket?
Glenbrook Station.
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat, all right? He's bleeding.
He needs medical attention.
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train's security box?
Careful, ma'am.
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?
What would you do if you only had a minute left to live?
I don't know.
I would call my dad.
I would hear his voice, and I'd tell him I was sorry.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox, that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.
Did you make any progress?
Can I get access to a phone?
I need to talk to my father.
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.
Goodwin, how am I doing?
I'm just trying to measure my performance here.
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?
We are wasting valuable time here.
No, no.
I have never been on the other side of a source code mission.
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?
CAOC-N. What is that?
Because the specifications are extremely narrow.
What are they?
Captain, you should have found a suspect by now.
This tactical advantage, this tremendous tool that we've given you, don't squander it thinking. Do.
Please contact my father for me.
This will stop at some point, Captain.
As soon as you finish the mission.
And you're doing really great.
And this will end.
Now, whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind.
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get into the overhead vent, flashlight, something.
Check bags and backpacks, briefcases, anything.
So, I took your advice.
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.
Were you in the military?
A friend of mine was.
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared, and no one's heard from him since.
Do you have the Internet on your phone?
No.
It's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string.
Do you think you can see what you could find on this guy?
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.
Okay. You owe me.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Why don't I get one for you now?
Okay. Christina?
Um...
I've been having these dreams lately.
Really vivid.
And you've been in them.
Really?
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...
It's just...
Um...
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.
For what?
Psych. And I got a big test this morning, so I should get back to it.
Can I borrow a pen?
Yeah, sure.
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!
Hey, your bag is a mess.
What are you doing, man?
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.
How about you let the guy have his bag back?
Finish your deal.
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.
This guy.
Don't do that.
Nothing. What am I doing?
Jesus.
Dick.
CAOC-N.
- Can you believe that?
- Asshole.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...
Then what was going on down there?
Oh, you know, uh...
We were just having a little bit of an argument, actually, about this patch.
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters, they look familiar to you?
Do you know what the "N" stands for?
It's Air Force, and the
"N" stands for Nellis.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.
All right. Thank you so much.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
Next stop, Chicago,
Union Station.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Post Operator.
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.
Name, please?
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.
- Hold the line.
- All aboard.
Doors are closing.
Dr. Rutledge will be on in a moment.
I have to tell you something.
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...
He's dead, Sean.
What?
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed in action two months ago.
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.
It was on the first site I tried.
His father's name is Donald, right?
This is from last week.
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss
"the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,
"who died in Afghanistan in February,
"and was honored posthumously with a silver star.
"Also on the broadcast will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."
I'm sorry.
Captain?
Sean? Talk to me.
Captain?
Captain Stevens, my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.
Hey, this guy's crashing!
- Captain, just tell me what you see.
- Just look and speak.
I see a card.
That's good.
- Do you copy?
- We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.
That's very good.
Am I dead?
A radio listing is saying that I died in a helicopter crash, in country, and my father received a medal for me.
Your condition's not the issue here.
You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attack.
Everything else is irrelevant.
A news report saying that I'm dead is irrelevant?
Until the person or persons who blew up that train are in custody, yes.
Goodwin, one soldier to another, am I dead?
Part of your brain remains activated.
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.
They still move.
They are a manifestation.
They're just your way of making sense of all this.
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?
I'm imagining that I'm still alive, that I'm in this capsule?
We have core temp dropping.
Captain, what just happened?
I asked you a question.
The capsule is a manifestation as well.
Where am I?
That's classified.
Fuck you!
Captain, I cannot imagine what you must be feeling right now.
But if we're to prevent a second attack, we need to send you back immediately.
And, Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission while inside the source code, even to investigate your...
Even to investigate what happened to you.
There's only one continuum on this end and it can't be unsettled.
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.
Just before the explosion, so at 7:46 this morning,
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train, but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.
If the call even went through, it would be received by a different me entirely.
This may be difficult for you to hear, but you are a hand on a clock, understand?
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.
And that represents the entirety of your function here.
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!
I'll see if that makes an impression!
You cannot alter the continuum of this reality from within the source code.
This can't be legal, what you're doing.
In fact, your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by military court.
Many soldiers would find this preferable to death.
The opportunity to continue serving their country.
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?
That's immaterial.
Any soldier I've ever served with would say that one death is service enough.
Fine. You can have that in return for completing this mission.
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.
Terminate your service. Let you die.
This is taking too long.
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.
I am certain we can find other servicemen with wounds similar to yours who would consider being a part of this program an honor.
What? No, wait, what?
Send him back.
Charge the drivers.
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you, but it's also about two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.
Your advice.
Hey, Grandpa.
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?
There are hundreds of people on that train.
Well, then check them out one by one.
It doesn't matter what you do to them.
They're already dead.
Get to that gun, and shoot someone if you have to.
But get us some usable intel.
No, wait!
We have to keep doing this until you find the bomber.
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.
Who is the bomber?
I'm trying.
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're exhausted, and we're all frustrated, but we cannot fail. You can do this.
I can't. I can't.
Yes, you can.
You're a born hero, son.
Even your father thinks so.
Saving people is what you do best.
It was about his third tour.
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?
I just started feeling like he didn't want to come home anymore.
- Dad?
- Like somehow, he couldn't come home.
And he wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't hear me.
Finally he said he just couldn't leave his unit out there without him, and that was that.
Those guys were his family.
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,
I never fully understood him.
And I can't believe he's gone.
Send me back in.
Please don't blow me up again.
Hello?
I know it's you.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
I'm gonna find you. Turn around.
- Hey, there.
- Me?
Why do you look so surprised?
Don't.
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.
- Okay.
- Move over.
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.
- You're done. You're done.
- What?
You can't kill anybody anymore.
What? I don't understand.
You were going to trigger the bomb with your phone.
What? Dude, I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.
Try it again.
Your call. Dial it again.
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.
Your phone is gonna ring, and then I'm gonna shoot you.
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Wow. Thanks.
Hey!
All aboard. Doors are closing.
Shit! No! No!
No!
Wait!
No! Come on!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Hey!
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?
- See this?
- Yes.
- You recognize it?
- No.
Jesus.
How about you give me your wallet?
Okay.
You left it on the train deliberately.
I must have dropped it.
No.
You planted it there, so everybody would think you were dead.
I know it's you.
How do you know so much?
What the hell is that thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!
Do you wanna see it?
Very patriotic.
Slowly, slowly!
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Not many people could build that.
All right. Where is your next target?
Sean?
Oh, my God!
Sean Fentress?
Teacher.
History.
I don't know you.
I think I killed your girlfriend.
Why?
You messed up my timing.
- Why?
- Oh.
You mean "Why this?"
Because the world is hell.
But we have a chance to start over in the rubble.
But first there has to be rubble.
You're a teacher, you understand.
Christina.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
This isn't the end.
Check through there.
I'll go check this way.
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
I have your bomber. I have his name.
You have the bomber's name?
Derek Frost.
He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.
All right, let's move.
And Goodwin, there is a radioactive device in the van.
Some kind of bomb.
Thank you, Captain.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.
About our deal?
I had hoped that you might reconsider that, for the sake of the program.
I have. I want something else now.
Good.
I still wanna die.
But I want to go back in and I wanna save all those people on that train first.
It doesn't work that way. It can't.
No, I know. I know, I know.
I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir. I'm just...
I'm asking you to have the decency to let me try.
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.
Van is approaching fence gate to the quarry. Over.
- Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
- Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.
We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.
AU SWAT-2, roger that.
We're going to switch now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate.
The SWAT team is approaching the white van.
The Illinois man has been sought since early this morning.
The door is open and the man is on the ground.
It appears he has surrendered.
Earlier today, the police discovered...
Congratulations, Captain.
In recent months, Frost started posting anti-government statements on his website.
Yes, sir, it's a real validation of the program.
A clear window into just how revolutionary source code can be.
We finally have a powerful weapon now in the war on terror.
Congratulations, Captain. A job well done.
He's not gonna send me back in, is he, Goodwin?
I'm still waiting on an answer.
Are you married, Captain?
Um...
Joe?
Why don't you go take a break?
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.
Can I get you something?
No, I'm fine.
Why? Are you asking me on a date?
Sorry. Poor taste.
- Are you married?
- Hmm?
No.
I am divorced.
Do you think there's an alternate version of you?
A Goodwin who made different choices?
What do you mean?
Like, a you who didn't get married and get divorced.
Or just married someone else.
A woman who took a different fork in the road.
No, I don't, Captain.
What you experienced was a shadow.
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.
This is real life. Here.
The one where you're talking to a dead helicopter pilot?
The program wasn't designed to alter the past.
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.
I missed something, Captain.
That train shouldn't have blown up.
There must have been a second detonator, something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.
It's a computer program, Captain.
The girl on the train, all the others, they're lost.
I'm sorry about that.
I get it. I get it.
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.
You're wrong, Goodwin.
You're just plain wrong.
Captain, Christina is dead.
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.
I'm asking you,
I'm asking you. Just...
Send me...
Captain.
It's your choice.
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.
There will be no coming back.
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.
It was an honor, Captain.
And I thank you for your service.
Good luck.
I took your advice.
You're gonna move to India, and become a guru.
Careful, ma'am.
Yeah, I'm gonna go find myself in the mountains.
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee with me before you go.
Yeah. I'd like to do that.
Put it to the test.
Good.
Let's do it today.
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.
- You know what?
- What?
I feel really good.
Why?
Because I've been waiting for weeks for you to ask me for coffee.
Ticket?
Okay.
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.
Gotta go save the world.
I knew he was a keeper.
Excuse me!
Beautiful day.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Ticket?
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.
Yeah, well, sure.
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...
Eight source code projects up and running by the end of the year.
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.
Well, thank you.
We did save lives today.
Yes, a true victory for the program.
A great victory for us all.
We'll talk soon.
So? Exciting times.
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1, start crunching the data.
Sir, we told Captain Stevens that we were gonna let him die.
Let him die?
He just saved millions of lives today.
How many other disasters might he avert down the line?
For all we know, he may be the only candidate with which the system works.
So, let's clear his memory and reinitialize source code.
Shall we?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, I just dropped...
Hey, Derek! This isn't your stop.
Hey, mister!
You dropped this.
Come on back here.
Oops.
Derek, it's over.
You understand?
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.
I planted a nuclear device in a white van parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot.
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole on the 944 CCR train headed to Chicago Union Station.
I am a sick and pathetic human being.
And I need to be locked away for a very long time.
Okay.
Derek, there's no more burying the world in rubble today.
You mind if I borrow this?
Captain, some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate.
And...
Do you want me to initiate the memory wipe, Captain?
Hello, Captain.
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?
Yes?
My name is Sean Fentress.
Who?
I served with your son, Colter.
- Oh, boy.
- It's...
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what you want to say. You know?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.
How are you doing, sir?
Well, all that came back was some ash.
It's hard to believe that it was him.
How well did you know him?
I was there when he died, sir.
He said that the last time that you guys talked was tough, and he wanted to say that he was sorry.
I just want him back.
I loved him so much.
I wish you could have told him that.
He knows it.
You take care, Mr. Stevens.
You okay?
Yeah.
Save the world?
Sort of.
So, where were we?
Getting some coffee.
Dr. Rutledge.
What?
Shit.
- What's so damn hard about it?
- I run a business, okay?
Everything moves on time or people get fired.
That's the way it works in the real world.
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?
Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.
Thank you for that moment of Zen, but nobody was talking to you.
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here this instant!
Why are you always so bitter, Max?
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?
It doesn't have to be.
I will bet you $100 you can't make all these people on this train laugh.
...Oh. Right.
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.
Is that your way of making fun of me?
I guess you have a better gig. Never mind.
No, no. I'm good.
Easiest money ever.
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.
One of our fellow passengers has decided to offer me some money to...
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.
- It's the new me.
- I like it.
I am going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.
Women always mess up my last name.
I was with a girl the other night and she kept calling me "Getoff."
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."
She says,
"No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off!"
Good?
Twenty seconds.
Make it ten.
Goodwin?
Look at all this.
It's good to see you, ladies, up this early in the morning.
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.
All this life.
Goodwin. Open this door.
- Put those headphones on.
- I wanna see them stretch.
- Why do you keep looking at your watch?
- Christina, what would you do if you knew you had less than a minute to live?
I'd make those seconds count.
I'd kiss you again.
Again? Mmm.
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!
He's done enough, Doctor.
And, I'm on the train...
Everything's gonna be okay.
It is a beautiful Monday in Chicago today.
Temperatures expected to reach the lower 60s.
Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway,
53 at O'Hare.
And now, up in the sky, we've got...
He earned that money.
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.
- Speaking of which, I have no cash.
- Great.
Come here. I wanna show you something.
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It is a really perfect day.
Do you believe in fate?
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.
- Come here.
- Wow.
So what do you wanna do today?
I think we should stay here for a while.
This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?
Las Vegas' number one morning news follows.
It's 72 degrees on a cloudy Monday morning.
This is News Radio 840KX in North Las Vegas.
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
At some point today, you're gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago.
You and I kept that bomb from going off.
An attempted bombing on a CCR train outside Chicago.
But it was thwarted, and the suspect was found on board,
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.
Captain Goodwin, anything I can help you with?
No, that's fine. I'll come back later.
Keep an eye out.
One of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun.
Yes, sir.
If you're reading this e-mail, then source code works even better than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.
You thought you were creating eight minutes of a past event, but you're not.
You've created a whole new world.
Goodwin, if I'm right, somewhere at the source code facility you have a Captain Colter Stevens waiting to send on a mission.
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.
Dirty Wars (2013) - Bluray
Full Subs.
Kabul, Afghanistan,
4:00 in the morning.
As an American journalist,
I was used to filing stories in the middle of the night.
But there's always something eerie driving through the deserted streets.
A city of 3 million- barely a streetlight on.
It was a familiar routine:
Waiting for the crew to light up the night sky so you could see something in the background.
But could we really see?
Well, Keith, greetings from Kabul, Afghanistan, where the U.S. Ambassador
Karl Eikenberry...
This is a story about the seen and the unseen...
And about things hidden in plain sight.
It's hard to say when this story began.
I'd been working as a war reporter for more than a decade in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and now Afghanistan.
After nearly ten years, the war here wasn't exactly breaking news.
I think there's, like- there's, like, eight rakes.
One, two, three...
We haven't been out here.
What's the name of this village out here?
Oh, I have no idea.
They all blend in for me.
Yeah.
What's the focus of your campaign here?
In southern Nangarhar, we're dealing with the Ashkar-
Ashkael- uh, Asherkeil tribe.
You know, the wording, uh, I'll get right probably when we leave next year, but...
This was supposed to be the front line in the war on terror.
From Kabul out on an exercise with the military and back to Kabul, the Afghan Press Corps was locked in a bubble.
We were told that the battle for hearts and minds was being won as soldiers dug wells or drank tea with tribal elders.
But I knew I was missing the story.
There was another war, hinted at in press conferences and detailed in each morning's press release.
December 14th, Zabul Province, a night raid.
Four Taliban killed, three detained for questioning.
No civilians injured.
No one at NATO would give us anything more than the lists of nighttime raids.
No one even seemed to know who was doing the raids.
And I wasn't going to find out if I stayed in Kabul.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN
This is the third raid in my district.
13 or 14 people have been killed in all.
They were innocent people.
So what you're saying is that the Americans will come into a district where you're the police commander, and they won't inform you that they're gonna carry out this kind of action in your district.
I've asked the American soldiers that come to my district.
But even the main
NATO base here says they don't know anything about the raids.
The troops came from another base.
So there's the two- the two men in the guesthouse were the first people killed.
And then...
The farmer from here.
- Yeah.
- And then another farmer.
Two.
Two of his sons.
Two.
- Mm-hmm.
- Two of his sons.
So there's, I think- so seven.
Or two-
- Two, two---four.
One farmer---five.
Two these--- seven.
Two...
The Americans will say anything.
The Americans will say anything, everyone knows that.
If the Americans do this again, we are ready to shed our blood fighting them.
We would rather die than sit by and do nothing.
The list of raids from
NATO press releases read like a map of a hidden war.
The military divided the roads in Afghanistan by color.
Green was safe.
Red was dangerous.
And black?
Don't even try it.
Most of the raids were happening far beyond the green zone in what the military called "denied areas"...
Places where journalists never show up to ask questions.
NATO, the U.S. Embassy, and my own better judgment all advised against traveling there.
But I'd read about a raid in Gardez, half a day's drive in Paktia Province.
I pushed as far as I could into the gray area on the fraying edge of NATO's control, past rusting Russian tanks and bombed-out NATO supply convoys.
Two other journalists had been kidnapped on this road, and after weeks in the military's armored vehicles, our Toyota felt thin-skinned and fragile.
I knew I had to be back in Kabul before sunset, when the Taliban took control of the roads.
But I had no idea how far my visit to Gardez would lead me.
GARDEZ
PAKTIA PROVINCE
This is my son, and this is my son, and this is my daughter-in-law, and this is my granddaughter.
They killed them all on a single day.
Two of the women they killed were pregnant.
One was 5 months, the other was 4 months pregnant.
A child had been born in our home and we had organized a party to celebrate.
We invited many guests and had music.
During the party, people were dancing our traditional dance, the attan.
The American forces came between 3:30 and 4:00 am.
Daoud went to see what was happening.
He thought the
Taliban had come.
They were already on the roof.
They shot Daoud as soon as he stepped outside.
All the children were shouting,
"Daoud is shot!
Daoud is shot!"
We brought Daoud in here.
The women grabbed Zaher.
They told him not to go or he would be killed.
But they opened fire.
They killed three women, along with Zaher.
My wife, my sister, and my niece.
Look at these patched bullet holes.
Was Mr. Daoud killed immediately, or did he live for a while after he was shot?
Daoud and my sister-in-law were alive until 7:00 am.
They didn't let us take them to the hospital.
The Americans used knives to dig the bullets out of their bodies.
They pulled out the bullets from their body.
You saw the U.S. Forces take the bullets out of the body?
Ja.
They tied our hands and blindfolded us.
Two people grabbed us.
They pushed us one by one into the aircraft.
They flew us to another province.
To Paktika.
So he had just seen his wife killed by the American forces, and then he himself was taken prisoner by the Americans.
What was going through his head when they took him?
My senses weren't working at all. I couldn't cry.
I was numb and didn't feel a thing.
I didn't eat for three days and nights.
My hands and clothes were caked with blood.
They didn't give us water to wash the blood away.
The interrogators had beards and didn't wear American uniforms.
They had big muscles.
Sometimes they acted nice.
And sometimes they would shake us.
By the time I got home, all our dead had already been buried.
Only my father and my brother were left at home. I didn't want to live anymore.
I wanted to wear a suicide jacket and blow myself up among the Americans.
But my brother and my father wouldn't let me.
I wanted Jihad against the Americans.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
1:00 AM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010
MOHAMMED DAOUD
2:00 PM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010
The family had no idea what led the Americans to their home.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
POLICE COMMANDER, GARDEZ
They had long fought against the Taliban, and Daoud was a police commander who'd been through dozens of U.S. training programs.
This is my son, the Police Commander.
Was he Taliban?
They said they had information that 50 Taliban were here.
But they were all my relatives, and they worked for the government.
They killed my innocent sons, daughter, and daughter-in-law.
They had committed no sin and had no enemies.
As we prepared to leave,
Daoud's granddaughter spoke to us, but only later would I know the meaning of her words.
Daoud's family told me it was time to go.
The sun sets early in the mountains, and the night belongs to the Taliban.
So the highway is closed.
I think there is an attack from Taliban.
The gunfire continued, and it was now obvious how dangerous, maybe even reckless the trip had been.
Mm-hmm.
NATO wasted no time issuing a report.
They claimed that the women killed in Gardez were the victims of a
Taliban honor killing, bound and gagged by their own murderous families.
You saw the U.S. Forces take the bullets out of the body?
I believed the family, but that wasn't enough for me or anyone else.
[Speaking indistinctly]
Who were these men that stormed into Daoud's home?
And why would they go to such horrifying lengths to cover up their actions?
Tamana.
Who did the Americans kill?
They killed my grandfather...
...and Gulalai.
And they killed Agha Abdulnoor.
All right.
Ready? Yeah.
One, two, three.
Good morning.
The subcommittee will come to order.
The subject is national security.
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON, DC
If my esteemed friend, the gentleman from Michigan, wishes to continue with this hearing,
I think that's fine.
He is the chairman.
But next year, when this committee is under new management, we won't be looking at the calendar of last year or two years ago.
Thank you.
Far from discussing the distant past,
I'd like to share with this committee part of my investigation into deadly U.S. night raids...
Sensenbrenner walked out, but no one else even bothered to show up...
Just Chairman Conyers and his staffers.
In closing, Mr. Ohairman,
I told these families that I'd bring their cases before the U.S. Congress and ask that they be investigated and that those responsible be held accountable.
On behalf of those families...
It didn't surprise me that Washington wasn't interested in Gardez.
As an investigative reporter, you rarely have people's attention.
More often than not, you work alone, and the stories you labor over fall on deaf ears.
But sometimes a story strikes a nerve, and you're thrown into the public arena.
It happened to me once before.
During its time in Iraq,
Blackwater has regularly engaged in firefights and other deadly incidents...
It was 2007, and I was reporting on Blackwater, a shadowy mercenary company, and suddenly it was front-page news.
A frequent contributor to The Nation magazine, his new book is called Blackwater.
Jeremy Scahill, who authored the book Blackwater...
Who's come to us from London...
Joining me now is
Jeremy Scahill.
I quickly discovered that the world of talk show television is less a meeting place for ideas and more like a boxing ring.
That is hooey.
$700 million for a colonial fortress in Pakistan.
The whole thing feels like a game.
But every time you step into the ring, there's a chance your story can have an impact.
Journalists have done nothing to hold the White House accountable now,
Chuck, or under Bush.
Let me get to the story-
- Why are you still alive?
Are you paranoid?
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.
I mean, it's an amazing book that you've written, and I'm curious that-
"Oh, that guy had a"-
"Remember that guy we did Maher with?"
"Oh, he's dead."
"What happened?"
"He had an accident." I mean...
And here are the-
Residents are being picked up, abducted...
Congress wasn't going to investigate the raid in Gardez.
And my Freedom of
Information requests were bounced all over the military, ending up in an unnamed agency awaiting review.
I reached out to everyone
I could in Washington- the CIA, State Department, former military officials- but no one would speak openly about Gardez...
Until I met with
General Hugh Shelton,
Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs on 9/11.
GEN. HUGH SHELTON
CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
One incident that I looked into in Afghanistan, where an Afghan police commander and two pregnant women were killed- but the question I wanted to ask you is, in that kind of case- let's say that's true- how would something like that be handled or investigated or reviewed?
If they go flying in and meet any kind of resistance at all-
I mean, shots are fired- then I'm sorry if they got killed, but they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I don't think it ought to be investigated.
I think you write it off as one of those damn acts of war.
But one of the victims was a senior police commander who had been trained by the U.S.
And two of them were pregnant women.
Now, just 'cause he's a police chief- he could've been a terrorist as well.
You know, he could've been working both sides, so that piece of it, although it sounds bad- but two pregnant women?
The fact that they were pregnant is very, very unfortunate, but it's also unfortunate that they were women.
But on the other hand,
I've been shot at by women myself, so that doesn't-
And I mean shot at.
That doesn't excuse 'em.
They die just like men do if they shoot at us, so...
Congress wasn't interested.
I was being stonewalled by the military.
And General Shelton told me there should be no investigation.
KAIA AIRPORT
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN
And back in Afghanistan, the reporter who first broke the Gardez story had been publicly attacked by NATO.
JEROME STARKEY
TIMES OF LONDON
Yeah, we went to print on a Saturday.
By Saturday afternoon,
I was getting information from other journalists in
Kabul who are my friends that NATO was briefing against me.
NATO was trying to discredit me, trying to say that the story was inaccurate, and effectively trying to kill it dead.
To my knowledge, that was the only time that they've named a journalist and sort of singled out a journalist so specifically in a denial.
NATO accused Starkey of lying.
It could have been enough to end a journalist's career.
But information about
Gardez kept leaking out.
A secret UN investigation confirmed many of the details the family had told us, and an Afghan police inquiry was under way.
MOHAMMED DAOUD
I didn't realize what the family was showing me.
It was just a grainy cell phone video from the morning after the attack...
[indistinct conversation]
Until the voices began.
Ok, the blood trail, this is it.
This is the last room.
This is where the engagement was.
If he comes in here, there's a woman crying in the doorway.
My group was emptying this room and that room there, okay?
We pulled everyone out, okay?
Now, at that point, I'm watching what's going on here.
I see it all go down, and now we go behind them.
White light.
To make sure no one's hiding.
When I get to here...
Two Americans, their hands visible for a moment filming the corpses while they piece together their version of that night's killings.
After everything's said and done, still two guys are hiding...
NATO phoned me up, and they said,
"Jerome, we're just calling to let you know
"we're about to put out a press release.
We are changing our version of events."
They admitted that they were responsible for killing the three women and that the men they said were Taliban were not, in fact, Taliban.
They admitted they'd got it wrong.
Again, they were hoping it was gonna go away.
Well, it wasn't.
Like yourselves, we set off very early one morning from Kabul through
Logar to Gardez...
When up rolls a huge convoy of countless Afghan officers and soldiers.
And among them is a man wearing a uniform that I recognize as sort of U.S. Marines, but it says U.S.
Navy on his lapel.
But I didn't know who he was.
They off-loaded a sheep, and three Afghan soldiers knelt on this sheep in exactly the same place where these soldiers had been when they started the raid.
They were offering to sacrifice the sheep.
The soldiers tried to stop
Starkey's photographer,
Jeremy Kelly, but the family insisted.
Otherwise, there'd be no evidence that this extraordinary event occurred, no proof of who the killers were.
Like so much about this war, they would have remained unseen.
He said that, "My soldiers were responsible for the deaths of these members of your family," and for that, he apologized.
I would not trade my sons for the entire kingdom of the United States.
America unleashes the Special Forces on us.
And the Special Forces beat and kill poor, innocent people.
These Special Forces with the beards did cruel, criminal things.
They all have beards.
We call them the American Taliban.
BROOKLYN, NY
I returned home and tried to put the story of Gardez behind me.
But coming home is never easy.
I didn't want to admit it, but life back home was dull after being in a war zone.
Ordinary life was just that.
I tried to forget about Gardez but couldn't.
We pulled everyone out, okay?
Now, at that point,
I'm watching what's going on here.
I see it all go down. Now...
The video was chilling, but I couldn't see their faces.
All I had were images of their hands and the sound of their voices.
Okay, the blood trail.
This is it.
This is the last room.
This is where the engagement was.
He comes in here. There's-
There's a woman crying in the doorway.
None of these clues were supposed to exist- the cell phone video, the photos of the admiral and his sheep.
The killers were meant to disappear without a trace.
The family had called them "American Taliban."
But who were they, these American soldiers with beards?
As a reporter, you learn that every story has conflicting points of view.
You try to understand all of them without letting your own get in the way.
But there was something about this story and the way it was covered up.
The photo of the admiral had seemed to answer our questions about the raid.
But the longer I looked at it, the less sense it made.
I could read the name and rank, but who was this man delivering the sheep?
Vice Admiral William McRaven wasn't from NATO
Headquarters in Kabul, and he wasn't from the
Eastern Regional Command that owned that battle space.
I'd never seen the R01 insignia on his shoulder.
And it was hard to find mention of him in the press, much less a photograph.
But I found an old DoD press briefing from 2008 that mentioned
McRaven's nomination to lead an obscure unit within the military called JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.
After more than a decade as a war reporter,
I thought I knew most of the players involved, but I'd never heard of JSOC.
There was little official record, but JSOC was formed in 1980 after the failed hostage rescue mission in Iran.
It was designed as the most covert unit in the military and the only one that reports directly to the White House.
So why would the
President's elite force be kicking down the doors on a family in Gardez?
I knew Gardez wasn't an isolated incident and went back to NATO's daily press releases with their lists of killed and captured.
I expected the list to be long, but I had no idea how long.
Every week, the tempo of raids increased.
In the last three months, there had been 1, 700 night raids in Afghanistan.
It was a staggering figure and meant that stories like the one in Gardez were unfolding nearly
20 times each night.
An endless list of raids but not a single name.
I could see that Gardez was part of a bigger story- much bigger.
But the very thought of it was overwhelming.
With 1, 700 raids, who would compile the list of the dead?
The surge of night raids was clearly changing the war in Afghanistan.
It didn't take long for
JSOC's actions to ricochet.
Matthew Hoh has become the first U.S. official to resign in protest over the Afghan war.
Hoh is a former marine who spent five months working for the State
Department in Afghanistan and is, by all accounts, well-respected.
CPT. MATTHEW HOH
FORMER STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL
A lot of times, yeah, the right guys would get targeted, and the right guys would get killed.
And then plenty of other times, the wrong people would get killed, sometimes innocent families.
And then that sets you back so far.
You know, nothing like going into a village in the middle of the night, knocking a door down, and, like, killing a woman or a child to just undo everything that infantry battalion command had been trying to do for, like, the last nine, ten months.
You were in a position where you were trying to vet lists to make sure that the wrong people weren't being killed by these task forces.
Were there 500 people on this list, 1,000?
No, I can't-
I can't tell you.
- Oh, you can't?
- Yeah.
You can't tell me because...
I can't tell you 'cause I can't tell you that stuff.
- You can't talk about it?
- Yeah.
I saw the list. I saw how big they are.
Yeah, everything else, yeah.
I mean, that's-
I can't tell you.
I was just...
The Joint Special
Operations Command had never numbered more than a few thousand.
But under William McRaven,
Afghanistan had become JSOC's war.
How had such a small covert unit taken over the largest conventional war on the planet?
Andrew Exum had experienced the change firsthand when he served as part of McRaven's high value targeting campaign, not in Afghanistan but in Iraq.
He led a company of rangers in 2003 as part of JSOC's
Iraq task force.
CPT. ANDREW EXUM
75TH RANGER REGIMENT
I watched the way things began to change.
You know, kind of the iron rule was, you don't go anywhere unless you've got, you know, a company of Army
Rangers in reserve.
In 2003, nobody was in reserve.
I mean, people were hitting targets every single night in a very dispersed way and just-bam, bam, bam.
I mean, you remember the deck of cards.
We kind of had this poster of all these guys, and we went out looking for them every night.
So we would, you know, kick down a door and pull somebody out of their home in the middle of the night, and the next morning, you know, people would be rioting in the streets.
I'm in!
Clear!
Come out!
On your fuckin' face.
On your face.
Yeah, I remember one night going out.
You know, we found out later that we were on two-weeks-old intelligence.
Two Iraqis started shooting at us.
We killed them.
And, you know, we kind of realized later that these guys were just out guarding the- you know, the neighborhood generator.
Now, I didn't lose any sleep over it,
'cause these guys were shooting at me, but, you know, you start thinking about it from a strategic perspective- that's a loss.
You start out with a target list, and maybe you got 50 guys on it; maybe you got 200 guys on it.
But you can work your way through those 50 or 200 guys, and then suddenly, at the end of that target list, you've now got a new target list of, you know, 3,000 people on it.
And how did this grow?
What Exum told me about
Iraq was a revelation.
I thought JSOC's rise had happened later in Afghanistan.
I'd worked in Baghdad for years and had written countless stories there, many from the front lines of the war.
It was there that I first started reporting for The Nation magazine.
But I'd never heard of JSOC.
The budget for the Joint
Special Operations Command, you can't get it through a FOIA request.
We've tried that.
I'd missed the most important story.
In Iraq, the U.S. had fundamentally changed the way it fought war.
The real story, JSOC, was hidden in the shadows, out of sight.
What was hidden in the shadows right now?
...That I propose represent a new direction from the last eight years.
What was I missing today?
We are embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.
I discovered that, over the past decade, a series of secret presidential orders had given JSOC unprecedented authority.
The battlefield was expanded, and JSOC could now hit at will in countries beyond
Iraq and Afghanistan.
I began to research strikes against al-Qaeda outside the declared battlefields.
I looked for patterns among the lists.
And then I found one.
In December 2009, five strikes with over 150 casualties in a country without a declared war.
[Man singing in native language]
ADEN, YEMEN
Aden.
Yemen's ancient port city was nothing like Kabul.
In Afghanistan, life was defined by the war.
Everything revolved around it.
But in Yemen, there was no war, at least not officially.
The strikes seemed to have come out of the blue, and most Yemenis were going about life as usual.
It was difficult to know where to start.
The Yemeni government claimed responsibility for the strikes, saying they'd killed dozens of al-Qaeda operatives.
But it was unclear who the targets really were or who was even responsible.
I arranged to meet the most powerful man in southern Yemen,
Sheikh Saleh Bin Fareed.
SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAREED
LEADER, AL-AULAQ TRIBE
When was the first time that you heard about someone being al-Qaeda in that area?
It is, eh... I never knew that anybody belonged to al-Qaeda, except in the last three years.
Especially after the Americans attacked Al-majalah.
How did you first hear of the strikes that had happened on December 17th?
We got telephones from... from those people and of course the news word on Al Jazeera.
What was the news saying?
Our government attacked al-Qaeda base in Al-majalah where al-Qaeda have a field for training and they have huge stores for all kinds of weapons and missiles and rockets and... and they did not mention the Americans at all.
When we went there, we saw what happened
I mean, I mean, if somebody has got a weak heart, he will collapse.
You see goats and sheeps all over.
See the heads of those who were killed here and there.
You see children.
And you cannot tell this meat belongs to animals or to human beings.
Why did they do this?
Why did they had to do this?
There is no stores, there is no field for training, there is nobody, except a very poor tribe, one of the poorest tribes in the south.
AL MAJALAH
ABYAN PROVINCE
People saw the smoke and felt the earth shake.
They had never seen anything like it.
Iran to the area.
I found scattered bodies and injured women and children.
46 people were killed, including 5 pregnant women.
If they kill innocent children and call them al Qaeda, then we are all al Qaeda.
If children are terrorists, then we are all terrorists.
At 6 am they were sleeping and I was making bread.
When the missiles exploded,
I lost consciousness.
I didn't know what happened to my children, my daughter, my husband.
They all died.
Only I survived, along with this old man and my daughter.
Missiles attacked me.
And my brother Ibrahim.
And my mother.
Their hands were cut.
The echoes of Gardez were everywhere...
So many of the details repeating themselves.
But there was one important difference.
In Gardez, the American soldiers went to obscene lengths to cover up the killings.
Here in al-Majalah, despite the official denial, they'd left their fingerprints strewn across the desert.
Why would they deny something so obvious when anyone who visited the bomb site would see the truth?
But maybe that was the point.
There was no declared war in Yemen.
Out here, in the middle of the desert, no one was looking.
And the one local reporter investigating the bombing had disappeared.
The decision to arrest me was made the day I exposed the cover-up of the murder of women and children in Abyan.
The day I exposed those who sent cruise missiles to bedouin camps.
ABDULELAH HAIDER SHAYE
YEMENI JOURNALIST
Abdulelah Haider Shaye had traveled to al-Majalah immediately after the strike, and his reporting sparked national outrage.
Soon after, his house was raided by Yemen's American-trained counterterrorism forces.
Abdulelah was thrown in prison.
Posters demanding his return were hung around the capital.
ABDULRAH MAN BARMAN
ABDULELAH'S LAWYER
I met Abdulelah's lawyer at a teahouse because his office was under attack.
They fired over 120 shells into my office.
And now we can't reach it because the Republican Guard are deployed in the area.
In court, I noticed that one of
Abdulelah's teeth had been pulled.
And another had been broken.
And he had scars on his chest.
My understanding was that
President Ali Abdullah Saleh was going to pardon
Abdulelah Haider.
The president agreed to release him.
But that same day, the president got a call from Obama expressing concern about Abdulelah's release.
I'd heard the story many times in Yemen-
President Obama personally intervening to keep a respected Yemeni journalist in prison.
It sounded farfetched to me.
But then I found this on the White House's own website, a readout from a phone call between Obama and the
Yemeni president.
They badly misspelled
Abdulelah's name, but Obama's point was clear.
He wanted him kept in jail.
Al-Majalah was the first reported strike inside Yemen in seven years.
It was clearly a U.S.
Cruise missile that struck the Bedouin camp.
Since there was no declared war in Yemen,
I knew the strike was either JSOC or the CIA.
And then I found this photo.
The U.S. would have never released it, but Yemen's president posted it on his personal website- a presidential meeting with an important American guest, the head of the Joint
Special Operations Command,
Admiral William McRaven.
Joining us now is
Jeremy Scahill, national security correspondent for The Nation magazine.
His latest article is all about the U.S. relationship with Yemen.
Jeremy, thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
Back in New York,
I started writing stories about JSOC, their rise to lead force in Afghanistan, their covert strikes in Yemen, and it felt as though
I had crossed an invisible tripwire.
The reality is that
U.S. counterterrorism obsession with Yemen trumped concern for human rights.
- That's not true.
- And it's-
Well, it is true.
- It's not true.
Yup, back there.
Does the Pentagon have any comment on a report in The Nation today?
And my question is-
- Yeah, I guess- I-I-
- The question is- you keep denying covert operations.
Isn't this yet more evidence of one?
Okay.
Despite whatever conspiratorial theories that, you know, magazines or broadcast outlets may want to cook up, there's nothing to it.
So, Jeremy, let me ask you, have we been going into all of these countries over the past decade with drone attacks, dropping bombs in countries where we haven't declared war?
The lack of response from the major media and the CIA and all the rest of it suggests they're dismissing what you've done.
I receive a call, unprompted, from a Captain James Kirby, who is the spokesperson for Admiral Mike Mullen.
Calls me on my cell phone.
Wouldn't tell me how he got my cell phone number.
Wouldn't tell me who told him about the story.
This is hours from publication.
And told me that if we published this story in The Nation that I would be "on thin ice."
That was a direct quote.
And I said, "Well,
I want to know
"how you heard about this story, and I want to know how you got my number."
And he said, "Let's just say that I heard about it."
I wasn't sleeping well, and insomnia fueled my anxiety.
My computer had been hacked and part of my hard drive copied.
It was difficult not to feel a creeping sense of paranoia.
And then I got another strange phone call.
I had no idea why he called me or how he got my number.
I thought it might be a setup.
Every story I worked on seemed to trace back to JSOC.
And now, out of the blue, someone from the inside was reaching out to me.
I had met operators before in my research on Blackwater but no one as close to the heart of JSOC's covert operations.
He sent me photos of his DoD badges.
But I still couldn't help wondering, was I investigating JSOC, or were they investigating me?
Explain what JSOC is.
The Joint Special Operations Command handles all of the sensitive counterterrorism missions as the US government directs. And over time that was perverted into doing things that are far outside of its mandate.
What has JSOC been doing in Yemen?
Airstrikes...
Targeted killings.
Targeted killings inside the borders of Yemen?
Correct.
The world is a battlefield and we are at war.
Therefore the joint special operations command can go wherever they please, and do whatever it is that they want to do in order to achieve the national security objectives of whichever administration happens to be in power.
Were there ways that
JSOC was being used that you found objectionable?
I did.
There was... a lot of trepidation about what we were being asked to do, and where, and for what purpose.
A lot of it was of questionable legality,
And most of it was outside of any stated battlefield.
Kinetic operations, whether it's capture or kill, in some cases to detain people as directed by the United States government.
They launched their own internalized interrogation program, without the knowledge of the conventional U.S. military forces, or even the central intelligence agency.
Because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the program, there was a variety of abuses.
Torture?
I would say that, yes. The president has made a political and military calculation to let the Joint Special
Operations Command run wild.
So you're saying JSOC is able to hit harder under President Obama than they were under
President Bush?
Harder, faster, quicker, with the full support of the the white house.
On my last day in Sana'a, a file had been left for me at my hotel...
A leaked investigation into the strike of al-Majalah.
It included a list of the dead.
In Iraq, they had a deck of cards, a list of 55 names.
But the cards were not enough.
New lists were needed.
Longer lists.
At the end of each list, another and another, an endless list of names.
In al-Majalah, the list numbered 46.
14 of the names were women.
21 were children.
Who were they trying to kill?
A week after al-Majalah, there was another strike.
And this time, the
Yemeni government issued a press release naming the intended targets, but none of them had been killed.
For the first time, I had names on the kill list of people who were still alive.
Two of them were publicly known leaders:
Shihiri and Waheshi.
But the last name gave me a chill:
Anwar al-Awlaki.
I knew the name, but I couldn't believe
I was seeing it here on this list.
Awlaki was an American citizen.
The Christmas Day bombing attempt has everybody on alert tonight.
Investigators connecting the dots, and a key focus in the investigation is a radical Islamic cleric.
That man is Anwar al-Awlaki, an exiled American who was...
Just as I was investigating the expanding war in Yemen, it seemed Awlaki's name was everywhere.
The War on Terror suddenly had a new face.
Radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may now be as grave a threat as Osama bin Laden himself.
Awlaki, Holder says, is a clear and present danger.
He's an extremely dangerous man.
Does the U.S. have a preference in terms of al-Awlaki:
Dead, captured, or prosecuted?
Well, we certainly want to neutralize him, and we will do whatever we can in order to do that.
An American was on the kill list.
It felt to me like we'd walked off a cliff.
Awlaki had been sentenced to death without even being charged with a crime.
Awlaki's father filed a lawsuit with the help of the Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU.
He demanded that the government provide whatever evidence they had against his son.
But the government refused.
They had ordered the assassination of a U.S. citizen but said the evidence itself was too dangerous to be made public.
What kind of protections does this American have against being assassinated by his own government?
Yeah, it almost sounds kind of funny in an ironic way when you say that.
You know, you have the right not to be assassinated.
A bill was introduced in Congress to ban the extrajudicial assassination of Americans, but only six congressmen signed on.
And the people who should have known what was happening, the members of the intelligence committees, couldn't tell me anything.
When there is a lethal operation and a high-value person is killed, the president, of course, acknowledged that we killed-
- He can't-
- Huh?
SEN. RON WYDEN
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
Has there been any legal review of the potential for lethal operations against American citizens?
- Not to our knowledge.
- Is that classified?
It's important for the
American people to know when the President can kill an American citizen and when they can't.
And yet it is almost as if there are two laws in America, and the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret.
You're not permitted to disclose that difference publicly.
That's correct.
I wasn't surprised when Washington ignored the killings in Gardez.
But this was an
American citizen.
The country was now targeting one of its own.
Even John Walker Lindh, who'd taken up arms with the Taliban, was given a trial.
What had Awlaki done?
And why was the U.S. willing to cross such a dangerous line to have him killed?
I read everything I could about Awlaki.
It was obvious that he was an immensely popular preacher with a large following among young
English-speaking Muslims around the world.
On his blog, he openly praised some of the attacks against the U.S.
But this in itself was clearly not a crime.
I spoke with former CIA and military officials.
PHIL GIRALDI
CAREER CIA CASE OFFICER
They argued that
Awlaki's speeches were inspiring domestic terrorists.
EMILE NAKHLEH
CIA POLITICAL ISLAM DMSION
There were a lot of words
COL. PATRICK LANG
DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY from both Awlaki and the U.S.
Government but no concrete piece of evidence
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL that he was an operational figure
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL in any attacks.
I remembered seeing him on
TV nearly a decade earlier, just after 9/11.
ANWAR AL AWLAKI
FALLS CHURCH, VA - 2001
And it was difficult to reconcile the image of a new bin Laden with Awlaki's earlier sermons condemning terrorism.
The fact that the U.S. has administered the death and homicide of civilians in Iraq does not justify the killing of one U.S. Civilian in New York City or
Washington, D.C.
For a short time, Awlaki seemed like the go-to imam for journalists trying to understand the experience of
American Muslims in the wake of the attacks.
He was even profiled by the Washington Post for a piece about Ramadan.
After September 11th...
All of the feelings of the American Muslims were similar to everybody else in America:
Feelings of sympathy for the families of the victims and a sense of...
That whoever did this needed to be brought to justice.
A decade after this video was filmed,
Awlaki had become Public
Enemy Number One, his name at the very top of the kill list.
It felt like the War on
Terror was turning on itself.
I was now investigating the planned assassination of a U.S. Citizen- a watershed event.
SANA'A, YEMEN
For the first time,
I had the name of someone on the kill list who had not yet been killed.
Anwar al-Awlaki was now a wanted man hiding somewhere in the mountains of Yemen.
I knew I wouldn't be able to speak with Awlaki directly...
But through a series of intermediaries,
I managed to set up a meeting with his father.
I expected him to be reluctant to speak about his son, but he seemed happy to reminisce about an earlier time.
Anwar was an all-American boy.
This is in Disneyland, you know, in 1984, I think.
This is in San Diego when he was already an imam with a big beard, you know.
At that time, he was asking
Muslims to participate in the democratic process in America.
In fact, during the presidential campaign of George Bush, he thought the conservative Republicans will be better than the liberal Democrats, and he encouraged the Muslims there to elect George Bush.
Didn't he even, at one point, attend a luncheon at the Pentagon?
Yes.
You see, he liked America, and he wanted to stay and really-his life in America, but things came differently.
Can you explain to me why your son went into hiding?
After the incident of al-Majalah and Anwar was all over the news, the drones started to fly over Shabwah.
So, you know, Anwar was really concerned.
And so we took his family with us, and he left to the mountains.
Hmm?
Myself, at this age in my life,
I really cannot ever replace, you know, the role of my son as he was doing for his family.
From my reading of the history of your son, from his writing, it seemed as though there was a transformation that happened politically for him from 9/11 to the invasion of Iraq.
Something started to change in his tone.
Yes.
Anwar became popular before September 11th because his sermons and his tapes, you know, were very popular all over the
English-speaking world.
And then the invasion came in 2003, and they invaded Iraq and destroyed Iraq, so Anwar really started to be more vocal in his speeches against what the
Americans were doing against Muslims all over the world.
There's no doubt that your son praised some of the attacks against the U.S.
And for many Americans, it was enough to say,
"Anwar al-Awlaki is a terrorist."
But also, I want decent American lawyer to tell me that it is right for the United States government to kill an American citizen on the basis that he said something against the United States or against American soldiers.
I mean, I-I don't understand.
I don't understand 100% the
American Constitution, but I don't believe
American law will allow the killing of an
American citizen because he said something against the United States.
Anwar's father may have been calling for justice under American law, but American drones were already flying overhead.
The fact that they were trying to kill an American citizen was shocking enough.
But there was another reason
Awlaki's story haunted me.
We are against evil, and America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil.
How can your conscience allow you to...
Awlaki seemed to have embraced the very identity he once opposed:
The military jacket, the black flag, the unequivocal call for armed jihad.
I specifically invite the youth to either fight in the West or join their brothers in the fronts of jihad.
The all-American boy was gone and so was the moderate imam.
But why?
Awlaki was deeply affected by the War on Terror both abroad and at home.
The day after September 11th, a woman stumbled into his mosque in Virginia after being beaten with a baseball bat.
More than 1,200
Muslims were detained across the country.
You have Muslims who are locked up in jail and are left to rot in there.
There are no charges brought against them.
What have you done for them?
Awlaki resigned from the mosque soon after and left the country.
But the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq followed.
And, well, this is a new kind of- a new kind of evil.
And this-this-this-this- this crusade...
Is gonna take a while.
Awlaki began to see the expanding wars as part of a global attack against Islam, and his sermons reflected a growing anger.
We are watching one Muslim nation fall after another, and we're watching, sitting back, doing nothing.
After 9/11,
Awlaki was put under surveillance, detained at airports, and repeatedly interrogated by the FBI.
When he returned to Yemen, local officials arrested him on orders from Washington.
He was locked up for a year and a half without charge and spent 17 months in solitary confinement.
When he was finally released,
Awlaki was a changed man.
And after JSOC tried to kill him, his transformation was complete.
Eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself...
This is not a war of choice.
Just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.
This is a war of necessity.
They seemed like mirror images of one another, strangely distorted,
America's wars and Awlaki's words.
This will not be quick...
War against Islam and Muslim...
Nor easy.
Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the United States had helped create the very man it was now trying to kill.
America was my home.
Those who attacked
America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again.
Awlaki's journey, from a voice of moderation to one of retribution, cut to the heart of the larger story
I was investigating.
[Indistinct conversations]
Anybody...
Anybody belongs to al-Qaeda...
I'd seen the same pattern repeatedly.
America was trying to kill its way to victory.
Now got a new target list...
But the War on Terror was producing new enemies wherever it spread.
How did this grow?
How does a war like that ever end?
Good evening.
Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda.
Again, for those just joining us,
Osama bin Laden is dead, and one confirmation we're getting indicates that this is a special operations raid.
And I think an organization we're gonna hear a lot about in the coming days is JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.
So much for secrecy.
So much for cover-ups.
The forces I'd been trying to unmask since Gardez were suddenly national heroes.
The operation was called Neptune Spear.
To capture or kill bin Laden.
It felt like the world had turned upside down.
JSOC, long shrouded in secrecy, was becoming a household name.
But what did it really mean?
The White House circulated a photo from the night of the raid, perhaps as a picture of transparency.
Everyone was in the room:
Secretary of State,
Secretary of Defense,
Vice President,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the President himself.
But it was the seating arrangement that interested me.
The man at the head of the table wasn't the commander in chief.
It was McRaven's assistant at JSOC,
General Webb.
McRaven himself was running the operation from Afghanistan.
USA! USA! USA! USA!
I wasn't mourning bin Laden's death, but I wasn't celebrating either.
After ten years, I understood that people wanted closure.
But it didn't feel like V-E Day to me.
Didn't feel like victory at all.
The leader of al-Qaeda is dead, but a new one has taken his place.
Your mission will be to ensure he meets the same end.
Hearing JSOC mentioned on television was jolting enough, but when I saw the admiral in front of the cameras, it felt like I'd walked through the looking glass.
I am deeply honored that the
President has nominated me to serve as the next
SOCOM commander.
And if confirmed...
William McRaven was now the toast of Washington.
Admiral McRaven, by leading the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, you and your men won an enduring place in American military history.
Like all of my colleagues,
I salute you and your colleagues' and the SEALs' extraordinary operations.
Thank you for your service.
Thank you, sir.
When the congratulations subsided, the senators turned to the real purpose of the hearings.
Are you prepared and capable to expand your operations at a moment's notice worldwide?
As we look out from
Iraq, Afghanistan, and, frankly, across the globe, as we look at hot spots in Yemen where you have al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia where you have
East African al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab, now, these are clearly areas of concern...
People in the streets may have hoped the War on Terror was finally over.
But in Washington, in the corridors of power, a new chapter had just begun.
Right now, it's kinetic.
Hard kill.
If it's not hard kill, doesn't get played.
MALCOLM NANCE
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE
Soon after the bin Laden strike,
I met Malcolm Nance, a legend in the world of covert ops who'd trained countless Navy SEALs and other JSOC operators.
I'm a firm believer in targeted assassination.
If they are too strong for your ability to negate their capacity in the battlefield, then you're just gonna have to put a hellfire in.
If they're- if they are dangerous on a strategic scale like Anwar al-Awlaki from Yemen- definitely has a missile in his future.
No longer cloaked in secrecy, special ops seemed to be enjoying their moment in the sun.
You know, we went in, we did the drone strike, and-or hellfire strike, and we blasted the individual car of a known guy who was known to be in that vehicle.
And we flew in, and we snatched his body- we confirmed it- got the intelligence, went away.
That's the way we should be doing it.
The first time we met, he'd called me out of the blue.
This time, it was me who called.
JSOC may no longer have been a secret, but that didn't mean we knew the truth.
We're now seeing the effects of covert intervention in countries on multiple continents without any thought to future repercussions.
And it is radically expanded.
At one point it was 40 countries.
It is now expanded to over 75.
And there are dozens, if not hundreds, of concurrent operations.
But, in theory, Congress is supposed to have oversight of these operations.
They don't want to step into the dark and see what goes on behind the curtain.
Joint Special Operations Command became a paramilitary arm of the administration.
And billions upon billions of dollars was poured into JSOC.
What we have essentially done is created one hell of a hammer.
And for the rest of our generation, for the rest of my lifetime, this force will be continually searching for a nail.
Bin Laden's death had given the War on Terror new life.
After 9/11, there were seven people on the kill list.
In Iraq, 55 on the deck of cards.
By Afghanistan, there were thousands.
But now the list itself was changing.
Signature strikes,
TADS, crowd killing- a target list was no longer needed to justify a strike like al-Majalah.
All boys over the age of 15, all men under the age of 70 were now fair game in targeted areas.
Like a flywheel, the global War on Terror was spinning out of control.
When I began this story, the U.S. was at war in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
The bombing in al-Majalah brought me to Yemen.
But the list of countries where U.S. Special Forces were operating had grown, just as the kill list had.
Algeria, Indonesia,
Thailand, Panama, Jordan- the world was now a battlefield.
It was hard to know where to go next.
In Pakistan, the U.S. was launching weekly drone strikes.
In Mali, they were hunting al-Qaeda.
In Latin America, targeting drug cartels.
I decided to go to Somalia, where an escalated kill/capture program was under way.
Just as McRaven had testified, the war was erupting in East Africa.
Drone strikes were increasing.
There were suicide bombings in Kampala and Mogadishu.
And JSOC was on the ground, snatching bodies and flying them back to ships in the Arabian Sea.
ADEN ADDE AIRPORT
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA
Almost as soon as I arrived,
I sensed that things weren't going to go well.
Mogadishu was seeing its worst fighting in years, and there were no foreign journalists left in the city.
My local contact, Bashir Osman, was worried about my safety.
Okay?
It's okay.
All right.
It was a strange feeling, traveling with a dozen armed men in a decoy car.
I still had my reporter's notebook, but what could I learn in conditions like these?
Before arriving in Somalia,
I had read reports that the U.S. was outsourcing the kill lists to local warlords.
Among the most powerful in Mogadishu was Yusuf Mohamed Siad, known by everyone as Indha Adde,
"White Eyes."
GEN. INDHA ADDE
US-BACKED SOMALI ARMY
In an earlier life, Indha Adde had been America's enemy, offering protection to people on the U.S. kill list.
But the warlord had since changed sides.
He was now on the U.S. payroll and assumed the title of general.
So he's saying that the fiercest fighting that they're doing right now is happening right here.
Okay.
The men fired across the rooftops, but it didn't make sense to me what we were doing here...
Or what the Americans were doing here in Somalia, arming this warlord-turned-general for what seemed like a senseless war.
We got to move.
So these were Shabaab fighters you buried here?
Yes, two, uh-huh.
If we capture foreign fighters alive, we bury them.
We kill them when we catch them.
If you capture a foreigner alive, you execute them on the battlefield?
Yes.
So that other foreigners expect no mercy.
[Indistinct conversations]
How did the Americans find men like Indha Adde?
And to what end?
After a decade of covert war,
Somalia was in ruins.
Half the country was ruled by the local al-Qaeda affiliate, the other half by men like the general, wandering the streets with an endless kill list and a band of men.
[Indistinct conversations]
Every time we stopped, people looked at us nervously, and I was told that my very presence was endangering them.
Bashir would insist we leave moments after we arrived.
Okay, we go.
I wanted to see beneath the surface of the war to understand what it meant to ordinary Somalis.
[Indistinct conversations]
But I was passed from warlord to warlord and soon realized the only people
I'd be able to meet were men with guns.
You know when you are fighting with enemy,
any option is open.
No mercy.
MOHAMMED QANYARE
US-BACKED WARLORD
For years, Mohamed Qanyare was Washington's man in Mogadishu.
His methods were extreme, but Washington insisted
Qanyare's services were vital to their kill campaign.
Who were the people that the Americans wanted your help tracking?
No, I don't want to talk that.
You don't want to talk about that.
I don't.
Did they offer to fund any operations?
That one also, no comment.
You don't want to comment on that.
No comment.
But you're targeting people for the Americans.
Yes, we arrest and interrogate and release if we don't see nothing.
That's our business.
And when these
American operations kill innocent people, what's the impact?
America knows war.
They are war masters.
They knows better than me. So when they're funding a war, they know how to fund it.
They don't need even to touch to tell them.
They know very well.
They are teachers. Great teachers.
A roadside bomb blast hit a minibus full of civilians.
Three people died on the spot and many others were injured as well.
They're all being taken to Madina Hospital?
For over a decade,
JSOC and the CIA had free rein in Somalia.
All their tactics were on display- drone strikes, night raids, mercenaries.
As the War on Terror entered a second decade,
Somalia seemed like a laboratory of the future, and the future looked bleak.
KENYA-SOMALIA BORDER
I was ready to leave Somalia and decided to call my editor.
But the news from home what not what I expected.
Anwar al-Awlaki was dead, killed in a drone strike authorized by the
President himself.
Another name struck from the list.
I wanted to go home, to be done with it all.
But I couldn't.
SANA'A, YEMEN
I got another call, and this one left me stunned.
Two weeks after al-Awlaki's death, the U.S. had launched another strike in Yemen.
Another American had been killed.
But this time, it was a teenage boy.
They had killed Anwar al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son,
Abdulrahman.
I returned to Sana'a, but I wasn't sure why.
Was it to file another story?
To investigate another crime?
Or was it to apologize?
Abdulrahman left without telling us.
He said in a small note that he's going to look for his father.
He left from the kitchen window, and he took a bus to the governorate of Shabwah.
Then when his father was killed, his grandmother told him,
"There is no use for you to stay anymore."
And he said, "Yes, I will come back in two days."
On the morning of October 15th, we got a telephone call, and they told us he was blown up to pieces by the drone.
And they saw only the back of his hair.
You know, his relative, his cousin, he knew his hair from the back, and he recognize it, and he knew that Abdulrahman really was dead.
But they could not recognize his face or anything else.
I always teased with him about his, you know, big- his hair, you know, that he should cut it, because I thought that he should do that.
The drone had not just killed the boy, it vanished him.
I asked to see photos of Abdulrahman and suddenly realized why I was here.
It wasn't to investigate another death.
I wanted to see him when he was still alive.
[Indistinct conversations]
Abdulrahman's grandmother was in mourning but sat down with me for a moment to talk.
What did Abdulrahman do?
Who ordered the killing of Abdulrahman?
He was sitting, having dinner with his friends.
How come he was killed?
What did he do?
You know, Abdulrahman was...
He was a very, very gentle boy, and he never hurt anybody.
I tried to make sense of Abdulrahman's death.
His father's could at least be explained.
But a teenager with a Facebook page and a group of adolescent friends, why would his name have been put on the list?
What could he possibly have done?
The Americans said
Abdulrahman was collateral damage, but they offered no explanation for the strike.
And unlike Gardez, they made no apology.
It seemed an impossible coincidence.
They killed the father and then the son.
But maybe it was as simple as that.
Like a tale from
Greek mythology,
Abdulrahman was killed not for what he'd done but for who he might one day become...
A twisted logic, a logic without end.
Nasser had lost his firstborn son and his first grandson.
But what did we lose when the drone struck
Abdulrahman and his teenage friends?
When I first visited Gardez,
I had no idea where the story would lead me.
I didn't know just how much the world had changed...
Or how much the journey would change me.
But I realize now the story has no end.
Somehow, in front of our eyes, undeclared wars have been launched in countries across the globe, foreigners and citizens alike assassinated by presidential decree...
The War on Terror transformed into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
How does a war like this ever end?
And what happens to us when we finally see what's hidden in plain sight?

Hi. Package for
Brian Griffin.
Oh, I can sign for that.
Package, Bri.
Huh. Wonder what this is.
It's my book.
And there's a note from my publisher.
"We are returning all of the unsold copies of Faster Than
the Speed of Love."
You guys got a garage or something?
We got like 300 boxes of these things.
Wow, that's a lot of boxes!
Oh, this is so weird.
Look what they used to pack your book in.
Shredded-up pieces of your book.
Okay, that's it, I'm finished.
What are you talking about?
I'm-I'm finished.
I'm done. It's over.
Clearly, I am not meant to be a writer.
I have tried and I have tried, and nothing has worked out.
I... put my heart out there, and it keeps getting stomped on.
Well, that's it, no more.
I-I-I'm done writing.
What? Writing's the only thing that's giving your alcoholism any credibility.
Ooh, hey, you know, I just thought of something, hold on a sec.
I bought a vase last week and it's still in the box, and I just want to check to see what they used to pack it...
Ah, it's your book!
Oh, my God, this gets me so angry!
What? What is it?
Look at this.
The number-one book on The New
York Times Bestseller list is Dream Your Way to
Spiritual Joy by Pauly Shore.
This is why nobody bought my damn book.
You know, this is what they want.
The Secret.
Chicken Soup for the Soul.
The Purpose Driven Life.
I-I tell ya, I could crap one of those things out in a night.
I'm gonna tell Mom you said "crap."
No, I mean it. I could do it in three hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.
Well, why don't you? Believe me, I would love to, just to make a point, but I... I've given up writing.
Yes, but you cared about what you wrote before.
You don't care about this, so what does it matter?
Well, you do have a point.
All right. Maybe I will.
Oh, how fun. Can
I watch you write it?
I don't know, Stewie,
I kind of like to write in solitude.
No, no, I promise, I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.
MAN:
Ah, this is great.
I can finally be alone
with my thoughts.
Wait, I've got it.
Predator versus Batman.
Why has no one done this?
I need a pen, where's a pen?
Oh, right, I can't move.
That's okay, I'll remember it.
I mean, I can't forget a
million-dollar idea like that.
It's even better than the one
yesterday about the guys who...
Wait, I mean
the woman with the...
What was it?
Was she a shapeshifter?
Damn it, I just had it.
All right, calm down.
At least you've still
got Batman and the...
It was Batman Meets...
Oh, you got to be kidding me,
I just had it.
What was it, Batman Has a Son?
No, no, you (bleep) idiot.
No wonder your wife shot you.
And... done.
There it is, Stewie.
Three hours, 27 minutes and I've got myself one big steamin' pile of book.
You want to hear it?
Oh, definitely.
What are you calling it?
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Love it.
Thanks. Okay.
"Chapter One: Wish it.
"What are all the things you want most in the world?
"Use the following blank pages to write down all of your dreams and desires."
Ah. Brilliant. Make them do the work.
Yeah, why not?
You know, i-i-if people want crap, I'll give 'em crap.
And, you know, I have a friend who might be able to help get this published.
Wait, you have a friend in publishing and you never told me before?
He's kind of a new friend.
Who is he?
Yeah, I don't know if you want to start digging around in this area.
Let's just leave it at he's a friend in publishing and he calls on Thursdays.
Um, hey, Brian, when you're done, can I make a pirate hat?
(sighs) Here, just take it.
I look awesome.
All right, I got to go to a wedding.
I'll see you later.
Oh, my God, that is fantastic news!
I can't wait to tell him!
I know, I told you the book was good.
Yeah, thank you so much, Don.
Um... red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath-- um, I-I-I don't really have time to do this right now.
Brian, they're publishing your book.
You're kidding.
I-I can't believe it.
That's the worst thing
I've ever written.
Not according to Penguin Publishing.
In fact, you're supposed to call the chief editor.
Penguin Publishing.
One moment, please.
Sir, I have a Brian Griffin on the line...
Out. Get out!
Get out now!
All right, everyone, I made a very special breakfast to celebrate Brian's book coming out.
And... and... it's a special breakfast for me, too, right?
Why?
Because... because it is the anniversary of when I started to eat vegetables.
Author! Author!
And Peter for eating healthy.
Oh, Lois, you didn't have to go through all this fuss.
What you got there?
Oh, this? It's just a copy of Us magazine.
Can you believe it?
Wish it, Want it, Do it got three stars.
How... How hilarious is that?
It's not hilarious; its great, Brian.
That's a huge accomplishment.
Well, I helped get the review in.
I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer.
So hats off to both of us.
Well, n-nice going, Stewie.
You ought to be my publicist.
You know, I-I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related.
I do have references you can call.
You know, I-I spent a month as Melanie Griffith's loose skin holder.
Melanie! Melanie!
Over here.
You look beautiful.
Can't... hold... on... much... longer... Whoa.
(à la Droopy Dog):
I should have stayed in bed.
Yeah, we're walking in now.
Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book-- no personal questions, all right?
Are you okay? You good? You...
You need anything? All right.
All right, we're inside and there is nobody here to greet us.
We have no idea where we are or where we're supposed to go.
Oh wait, is that you on the phone over there?
Is this--? This is us.
Look over here.
There we go.
He sees us. All right.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Yeah, hello, we've been here awhile.
Come on, I'll show you the green room.
And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say, I loved your book.
Oh, well, thanks.
What's your name?
Sharhooz.
Oh, my God.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Oh, uh, excuse me, there's something on the wall.
Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water!
Geez, Stewie, there's no need to--
Ooh, I said no gray M & M's.
These are all gray.
Don't worry, Brian.
I've got it all under control.
You're a big canine star.
They should be treating you like Spuds MacKenzie.
Man, I wonder what he's doing now.
Now, ladies, approach him slowly.
He can't really see anymore.
I've injected him with the Viagra.
Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work.
We're here with Brian Griffin, local author of the new bestseller
Wish it, Want it, Do it.
Am I pronouncing that correctly?
Uh, yeah.
N-Now, what does that mean--
Wish It, Want It, Do It?
Uh, well, it... it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible.
Wow. And it's nonfiction, right?
Y... uh... yes, it is.
Now, w-which one is that? I always forget.
Is that the one that really happened or not?
Uh... yeah.
Okay, oh, so this... so now... so this is... this is a true story.
Well, it's not really a narrative--
Doesn't matter. I'm hooked.
And we'll be right back with sports.
Okay, you're doing great so far.
Now I was just texting with New York.
We're doing a whole thing there.
I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian.
Stewie, that's racist.
That's terrible.
I'm sorry, do you want me to call back and change it?
Well, it's done now.
Seems like a lot of extra work.
Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00.
And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis.
I just wanna warn you, she's very heavy.
So be prepared for that.
Geez, how heavy?
I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me.
Oh, look at this, your book is number three on Amazon.
Number three?
Well, who's number one?
Oh, it's that new biography on Michael Jackson.
Oh, come on, another one?
Unless it was written by a ten-year-old's bottom, who cares?
I... it doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I... I would guess that it's probably not that.
Well, Stewie,
I can't tell you how much I appreciate all you're doing.
I mean, I-I have been so happy with most everything.
Oh... y... Most?
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even, it's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth...
Oh, my God, you're amazing.
I've been so thrilled with how you're doing.
Oh, great.
Hi, can I help you?
Yeah, uh... Checking in.
Brian Griffin.
You... You should usually do that.
That... You should check me in.
That's like one of the things I was talking about.
I just have to tell you,
I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.
Oh, thank you so much.
You made my day.
So, you still in school?
Graduating this year.
Well, we'll have to celebrate while I'm here.
(giggles) Okay, well, I'll be right back with your key.
She's so pretty, isn't she?
Yeah... you know.
Do you think she liked me?
I don't know.
How... How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room later?
I... Pretty weird, I guess.
Oh, my God, were you... were you thinking of doing that?
Sending her to my room?
No... why?
Why? Were you thinking of me doing that?
I don't even know what you're saying anymore, man.
Just... do... do whatever you're thinking.
Oh, man, crazy.
Hi, um, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.
Uh-huh. What's your name?
It's Jan.
Okay, here you go, Dan.
Y-Yeah, it's Jan.
Back of the line. Go on.
Come back around, he'll try it again.
Hi. Can you make it out to Kelly?
Well, hi there. I sure can.
You know, I have to tell you,
Wish It, Want It, Do It totally changed my life.
Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I gotta tell you, that makes me feel pretty great.
This is just a phone number.
I know, I know, my phone number.
Oh.
Yeah.
What do you think of that?
Um, I'm not sure.
Well, you know,
I'm sure for you.
Oh.
Yeah.
I see.
Yeah.
I'm a little creeped out.
Hey, congratulations, somebody famous now hates you.
Okay, so, that's enough autographs, I think.
Listen, I want to thank you all for coming down.
And remember, Wish It,
Want It, Buy It. All right.
Brian, settle down.
You're worse than that guy from Penguin Publishing.
You want to get a book published, don't you?
Well... yes.
Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.
God, you know,
Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,
I'm not saying I am, but I get it.
You know, now that we have two minutes to kinda let the dust settle,
I just wanna say that I'm really proud of you.
Hey, I'm proud of myself, man.
I mean, I think it's like... you know,
I-I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's-it's really about having the courage to just kinda get inside your own head and just kinda poke around in there, you know, be, like,
"Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here?
"Hey, what do you call yourself?
"Oh, Wisdom.
"Oh, Profundity.
"Oh, Truth.
"Hey, let's, let's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book."
I love hearing about your process.
Hey, enough about me.
This was a great meal.
Oh, good, good,
I'm glad you like it.
They told me everybody comes here.
Hey, there's
Renee Zellweger.
Hey, Renee, how you doin'?
Oh, hi, Brian!
She seemed really nice.
Get over here!
Is, is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
Can you figure out what the problem is?
I-I don't...
I-I honestly have no...
Oh, God!
How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing
Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
I am mortified.
Absolutely mortified!
You should know better than this!
I-I told them who you were when I made the reservation!
Look, I have written a best-selling phenomenon!
I should be sitting in the front damn room!!
Okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you.
And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better.
And you being honest with me, well, that's helping me do that.
So thank you.
Good.
Oh, Brian, are you going straight back to the hotel?
'Cause I was gonna go back...
You know what, I'll just...
I'll take a cab.
Oh.
Well, at least it's not raining.
Hey, Brian, welcome home!
How was your book signing?
Geez, Lois, could I have, like, five minutes to decompress, please?
It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a
Japanese guy who had a cold.
STEWIE: Dear God,
he's become a monster!
BRIAN: Stewie, I got a flea thing goin' on in here!
Where the hell's my Frontline?!
Oh, my God! Brian! Brian!
Brian, look at this!
I got you on
Real Time with Bill Maher!
You're kidding?
That's awesome, Stewie!
Great job!
Oh, "great job," so you know that phrase.
What's that?
What?
What phrase do I know?
Bill Maher, whoo!
Okay, so the topic is going to be,
"Should God play a role in politics?"
Oh, and here's your heartworm pill wrapped in bologna.
Stewie, the point of the bologna is that I don't know the pill is there.
Why am I standing under an air vent?!
Um... because... because that's where...
Because that's where...
I...
I...
Because...
Because...
Well...
Well...
I can...
I can...
Uh...
Uh..
You...
Yeah...
Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
Okay, Mr. Griffin, we'll be ready in five minutes.
You'll be on the panel with Arianna
Huffington and Dana Gould.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
My-my publicist told me
Christopher Hitchens would be on the panel.
No, we told him Dana and Arianna two hours ago.
I did my prep research on
Christopher Hitchens.
I am so... sorry.
I am done with you.
Do you hear me?! Done!
Get out of here now!
Brian, please.
You're fired!
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
Well, Bill, see, I think...
Uh-uh-uh, actually, Dana, if I may, if I may,
I have some insight on this.
Bill, do you mind?
Go, dog.
Well, it just so happens that separation of church and state is something
I'm actually gonna cover in my next book,
God. Period. Dammit.
What does that mean?
Uh, well, if I can expand on this.
Um, for one thing,
"In God we trust" is on money.
Now, what does that tell ya?
Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y about any sort of stupid (bleep).
So what?
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
That's a good argument.
It's a very good argument.
I agree. I agree.
Really? Because I read
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed!
Uh, gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your lives.
Uh, yeah, I,
I didn't read it.
Oh, hey, oh, so you're the guy.
It's-It's actually... it's actually very popular.
Well, it may be popular, but I, I have to say
I agree with Arianna.
Uh, I think it's actually quite harmful.
Oh. Did you...?
When, when did you say that?
I just did.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe, maybe 'cause it sounds like you're talking with a mouthful of syrup,
I just didn't get it.
Hey, (bleep) you, man.
Actually, it, it,
I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot "want it," which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
Actually, since I said that, I did read it.
And that's another thing,
I have to say aren't "wish it" and "want it" really the same thing?
I mean, your book... basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point.
Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a lot of people, Bill...
Well, "help" is a strong word.
Um, how does this help people, like, with cancer or in Darfur?
Well, I mean, it's not really for them.
It's for, like, if you want a car.
How-how does this help you get a car?
Well, I mean, it doesn't with that attitude.
I mean, you have...
You have to do some of the work yourself.
That's why there are
50 blank pages.
That's why I keep it by the phone.
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
You know, what-what the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa?
What is your problem, Snoopy?
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
Oh, yeah, aren't you a sitcom writer?
I'm an author. I have contributed to the zeitgeist.
Do you even know what "zeitgeist" means?
If I didn't know what it meant,
I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...
And you know,
I-I'm not gonna give you, I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction.
You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody.
I mean, yes, Dana has made a career in comedy.
I don't think he's ever done anything as laughable as this book.
Look, all right, well...
What do you want?
I wrote it in a day.
Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours.
I think you're totally getting the wrong impression of me.
I-I was just trying to write something that would sell.
I-I think it's crap, too.
Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now.
I mean, if you're gonna dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in...
...at least stand by your dump.
O-okay, look,
I'm happy to do that.
I-I-I'm just, I'm just try...
Look, what I was saying...
Look, just tell me what you want me to say!
Bill, he's urinating!
That's it!
Look, Bill, can I just...?
Outside.
No, no, no, outside!
Outside now!
Outside!
You get outside!
Uh, knock-knock.
Hey, Stewie.
What do you want?
I just wanna talk to you about everything that happened.
Um, you know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down.
This all happened so fast, and I lost sight of who I was.
I mean, you know, sure, you were in a little over your head, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I was in over my head?
Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about all the things you did wrong.
It's about me apologizing.
Okay, then apologize.
I just did.
No, you didn't.
You just said it's about me apologizing.
That's not actually apologizing.
All right, Stewie,
I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
Okay, okay, there it is again.
What the hell?
Stop with that!
Y-you're right.
You're right.
This is, this is about healing.
This, this is not about how many things you messed up along the way.
It's about how badly
I reacted to them.
So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted to your many errors.
That's as good as it's gonna get, isn't it?
Pretty much.
You can't write.

An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei...
...and Katou Masaru, who is working to support his younger brother.
The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again.
And then...
...they died.
The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment...
...in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed.
In that room which they can't get out of, they received a command from GANTZ.
"If you want to go back, go crush this guy."
That was... to battle with the aliens who would invade the Earth...
An inescapable command.
They were then sent to a parallel world...
...and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens.
They barely got their victory.
What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was...
...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens.
If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs.
It was a frightening reality.
They have their life all thrown out of order...
...while being able to return to normal life when day comes.
People who were supposed to die...
Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling...
...and Katou, who continued to deny this battle.
The tough and painful battle goes on anyway.
...and their friends died one by one.
And, in the end, while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy, even Katou's life was taken away.
When Kurono was about to give in to sadness,
Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings.
He swore in his heart that he would earn
100 points in order to revive Katou.
In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting.
Let's go!
"Thank you for the hard work.
I'm Yoshioka."
"Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later,"
"so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning."
"It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour."
"That's all for now.
Thank you very much."
"At 10:29 p.m."
The message is over.

Soon it will be five months since the day the National Museum was collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown.
According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism.
- Is the burger done?
- Yes, coming.
I'll take this.
Please.
- Please help me with the tomatoes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Oh, Kei-chan.
- How's your homework?
- I'm done.
You're not.
But it's so interesting, Tae-chan.
Hey, Koruhi is written based on Kei-chan, right?
I didn't mean that...
Are you embarrassed?
Yeah. This manga is interesting, right?
She can even get the Rookie of the Year award.
I'm nowhere near good yet.
I have to improve my skills.
You're good already.
I'm no good yet.
There are a lot of better people.
I said you're gonna be fine.
Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too.
He's not coming back yet?
Oh, maybe a little more.
It's really because of his job, right?
Of course.
Oi, don't take your time in there.
Where is he really?
Ayumu-kun's brother.
Sorry.
I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before.
That time, his brother was arrested by the police.
Katou's not that kind of person.
This.
The pay for this month.
I don't need it, really.
Well you see, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right?
However, I want you to come to this house for a while more.
Of course I will.
If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework.
Ayumu is good at cooking anyway.
Well, I can't deny that.
Also...
If I come here,
I can see Kurono-kun too.
Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet.
It was what I'm gonna draw just now.
I was thinking of how to put in this particular romantic scene.
Well, I have to get going.
Eh?
I thought you were gonna stay?
Ah, someone just called me suddenly.
Kojima-san, you can just stay over.
Hold on a second.
Huh?
"The train will be coming to the first line soon."
"Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line."
You were chosen too, weren't you?
You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do.
Kobayashi-san is the same as you.
[It's completely up to me how
I want to use you people's lives.]
I'm sorry for startling you.
There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time?
Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there?
Rumors have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas.
But I've dug up everything.
You're from the media?
The motive is unknown but there is an incredible sequence of events that've been happening.
People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene.
The day just goes on as if nothing happened.
And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be...
...some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo.
Don't you know about this?
No.
Well then, how about that rumor?
The rumor about the black sphere...
...and the room that contains it...
You know it, don't you?
Then, four.
You can ask me four questions.
Your aim.
Why are you all gathering at this place?
We're searching for the black ball.
Black ball?
If we have it, we can go where we want.
You mean the room that contains the black sphere?
You know it, huh.
Where did you hear about it?
I came here today to ask about that.
Where is that room?
It's not in this reality.
What do you mean?
You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary.
Who are you people?
That's the fifth question.
Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do?
Sixth one.
What do you want exactly?
If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here.
Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while?
You and Kei-chan.
Focus.
Why? You two are dating, right?
We are not.
How come? You confessed to him, right?
Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun...
Seems that he can't think of any other thing.
But I'm fine.
When things calm down,
I'll try asking him once.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Ok! Homework.
[Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over]
It's gonna be soon, huh?
Yes.
Let me go!
Where's the heck is this place?
- Where am I?
- Please calm down.
Speaking of which, who are you people?
Who cares about that.
I was an office worker.
For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day.
Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though.
I'm a nurse.
That's during the day.
At night, she's a hostess.
You lie about you age, right?
This auntie's still popular at this age.
Can you believe it?
He's women's enemy even during the day.
I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop.
It's a small shop, but the food is delicious.
I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient.
Please contact me if need be.
And, how about you?
I'm a hairdresser.
Kurono-san is really a normal university student?
Since... you're really strong and everything.
He is, indeed.
Why are you so strong?
Because there's someone I want to revive.
GANTZ.
He was one of us before.
He fought with us.
Kurono-kun wants to revive him.
But... not only him.
I want to revive everyone who's died here.
And then, let us all be released from here and become free together.

It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up.
That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out.
What's wrong?
Kurono-kun, did something good happen?
There's something, right?
You can tell?
What? What?
Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu.
Katou is gonna come home soon.
Eh?
He's been contacting you?
Hm?
Katou asked me...
...to keep it from other people.
I see.
More importantly, there's some information
I want to give Kojima-san...
Well, "information" isn't exactly the word...
Wanna go to amusement park?
Let's go?
Just the two of us, once in a while.
You mean... that time I confessed to you?
That was...
I told you it was just at the surge of the moment.
Please forget about it.
How can I forget it?
Hey, let's go.
Impossible, impossible.
Absolutely impossible.
I have acrophobia.
I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all...
Look.
You even drew it in your sketchbook, right?
The scene at the amusement park?
Maybe if you go there, it can become your source to draw manga.
Then...
There's one condition.
What is it?
Please start calling me by my first name from now on.
Eh?
Call me now.
Please.
Well, that's a little...
Maybe now is not the right time.
The next time we meet,
I'll call you that, ok?
I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park.
Yes.
Definitely.
See you.
Welcome back, Kei-chan.
How are you alive?
GANTZ did something?
You don't remember?
How many people are there?
Eight people, including me.
Recently, we got three more people.
GANTZ...
I want to put an end to it.
How?
You don't know?
There's a ball this big.
No idea.
I'll come again.
If you know something, tell me.
GANTZ, show me people who've died.
What's the matter?
Katou was revived.
Eh? How come?
Well, I don't know about that.
But look, he's still in here.
What is going on?
[Katou]
Who...
Nii-chan?
What?
Um...
I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college.
Ayumu-kun, come see him.
Ayumu-kun?
What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother?
It's because you have work to do, right?
I'm asking you, Nii-chan.
Because I have work.
Really?
Really.
Oh, yeah?
Should I go back?
There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so...
I'm taking my leave.
I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun.
[Welcome back, Nii-chan]
I memorized how to make it when you weren't home.
Try it.
You're the first person I made it for.
This is Kojima.
Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier.
And also, there's something I want to ask...
About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too...
That's why, it won't be a date.
I want to see you.
Can I go to your workplace right now?
[Kojima Tae]
[Kojima Tae]
Ayukawa Eriko's started to make her move.
At Kita, Senzoku.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
This will repeat many times over.
I stopped this after my child was born.
I have to get released soon for the sake of my family.
What's the matter?
[Your lives have been taken away.]
[If you want to go back, go crush this guy.]
[Alien dressed in black]
[Special trait: looking normal at first glance]
[Favorite thing: black ball]
[Favorite thing: black ball]
Let's go.
[Please go.]
Where's this place?
A train?
Something is fishy.
Hey, you...
Have we ever met long before?
It moved.
It's the subway!
What?
The subway?
Everyone, don't space out.
"The train will be departing soon."
There are people here.
This has never happened before, right?
Take care of the front part of the train.
Ayukawa Eriko?
She's riding the train by herself?
Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people.
We are not doing anything to harm you either.
What? Is it like an event or something?
Kurono-san!
Don't shoot!
Don't drag others into this!
Can you hear people screaming?
It smells weird too.
What the? What's going on?
Isn't this dangerous?
Takahashi!
You guys are so amazing.
Damn it.
I remember...
I remember!
I remember.
I've done the same thing before.
What?
The two who were in the room before,
Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too.
Eh?
Stop! It's dangerous here!
Out of the way!
Come.
Kurono Kei.
Kurono-kun?
Run away from here.
Wait.
Sorry.
Stop it!
You're heavy. Move aside.
I'm covering for you.
She's tough.
Yeah.
This is revenge.
This is revenge.
You people were the ones who started this first.
You people have killed so many of my friends.
I'll never forgive you-
Everyone's safe, right?
Auntie isn't here.
[Well then, let's see the points]
Hold on a second.
Oi!
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Takahashi]
[0 point. Total 88 points]
What the heck is this?
Oi.
I told you Auntie isn't here.
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
[Good work. You got the first key.]
[Kobayashi]
[The second key]
[Yamamoto]
[You got the second key.]
"You know it, don't you?"
"The black sphere... and the room that contains it."
Black sphere?
Room?
GANTZ!
[It totally depends on me how to use your life]
[That's on theory.]
This is revenge.
You people killed my friends.
[Sakurai]
[0 point. Total 69 points]
Auntie's here, isn't she?
That's her, right?
Is this for real?
Isn't that Ayukawa?
Ayukawa... Eriko?
You finally came, huh?
Yes.
Seems so.
[Well then, let's continue with the points]
Everyone, please be careful.
This woman... was the one who killed me.
Long time no see, Kobayashi-san.
Huh?
Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room?
You don't remember me?
Huh? What?
[Kobayashi]
[0 point. Totally doesn't remember a thing]
Two years ago...
I fought while protecting you.
[Nakamura]
[0 point]
Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I...
We defeated these aliens dressed in black...
...two years ago in Shibuya.
[Yamamoto]
[11 points]
And then, everyone could stop doing this.
We had our memory erased... and were set free.
Ah...
Yes.
So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh?
[Suzuki]
[17 points. Total 101 points]
100 points.
"Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently."
"An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured."
"A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train."
"The cause is also unknown this time."
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
That means you'll be released.
Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man.
I'll choose the second option.
[2. Return the person you love to life]
I'm sorry.
First of all, let's revive Katou-kun.
No...
But, he...
I was... killed by him.
"This is revenge. You people killed my friends."
He said that and killed me.
That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier.
Then... this Katou is?
Let's confirm it.
GANTZ.
Please revive Katou Masaru-kun.
Eh? That's it?
Kei-chan.
Where's the alien?
Katou.
Katou.
Katou!
Oi GANTZ. Hurry up!
You mustn't die.
I'll wait for you.
I'll go first and wait for...
Kei-chan.
What about the alien?
What happened to it?
Was I... dead?
Was I alive?
I'm alive, and I can go back.
Suzuki-san used his points to revive you.
It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning...
...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Ah, it's nothing.
Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right?
Yes.
The other guy is an alien.
We will avenge you.
I have obtained the key to that room.
[Kurono]
[21 points. Total 115 points]
More than 100 points.
GANTZ, I choose number 2.
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
The person I want to revive is...
Huh?
I have you revived.
I was dead?
Yeah.
That's so uncool!
Right now, you're important to us.
Now, explain to us.
Something strange is happening to GANTZ.
You guys...
Long time no see.
You're still doing this, huh?
Why are you here?
We were summoned by GANTZ.
A black ball was sent to my place.
Ex-members like us were brought back here.
That's not the only thing.
There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed.
This has never happened before.
Say, what's going on now?
How long have I been dead?
Five months.
It's gathering people because of this?
What is it?
Oi, spill it.
GANTZ runs using battery.
Huh?
This thing runs using battery?
From what I observe, even though this is just a guess...
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.
That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ.
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?
That is...
Right?
Extermination... perhaps.
We, who were revived by GANTZ...
...will also disappear together with it.
What the heck is that?
Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.
Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens.
That's why it summoned us ex-members here.
I see what you mean.
So it's like homecoming, huh?
Perhaps...
...the archrival still remains.
The Last Boss, that is.
Don't tell me...
...that is...?
Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body.
Eh?
The one who killed me is also...
...that guy.
He's an alien.
There it goes again.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
"Open your heart with joy"
Today's mission just ended though.
"Look up to the blue sky"
"Listen to the radio"
"Take a deep breath"
"And take in the fragrance of the wind"
"And then - one, two, three"
[Emergency mission]
[Go crush this person]
[Kojima Tae]
[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]
What the heck?
An ordinary girl?
Wait, look...
Her favorite thing is...
What the heck is this?
Why is she the target?
Shouldn't it be that fake Katou?
[People who crushed her will get 100 points.]
[The others will have their points taken away.]
This girl is...
Kojima Tae is not an alien.
That's why...
...please don't kill her.
Please.
She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien.
That's not true!
The last person who appeared on the black ball...
...was this girl.
So that means... she's also an ex-member of the group?
No. I've never seen her.
Then... she's really an alien?
Hang on.
Where is that ball now?
The one who killed me...
So it's with that Katou alien, huh?
Isn't that bad?
Maybe he already killed
Kojima Tae before us.
The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around.
Seriously?
GANTZ wants to prevent that, right?
Anyway...
...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it.
If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl,
I'll kill Kojima Tae.
GANTZ.
Transmit me first.
Kei-chan.
I'll go to Kojima-san.
You go to Ayumu's place.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Be careful.
Wait.
You intend to protect her?
I want to revive Auntie.
That's why...
...I have to gain more points.
Stop it!
Transmit me quickly.
GANTZ!
My house?
I will explain everything to you later.
Right now, let's run away together.
Um, what happened in the subway earlier...
It didn't make any sense at all.
But I believe...
I believe you, Kurono-kun.
This way!
Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother?
It wasn't him!
Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters.
Found one suspect just now.
The suspect is heading towards the north direction.
The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else.
Quickly send more backups to the subway.
"Roger."
Found you.
Kurono-kun.
Let's stop this.
If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated.
Doing this to another human being is just strange.
Though you can kill so many aliens?
Suzuki-san.
Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end,
I will get 100 points one more time.
Nice.
Kurono-san.
Run away.
If you move, we'll shoot.
No, you won't.
Suzuki-san too!
Me too?
They're shooting!
Please go first.
I will block them.
Sakurai-kun!
They won't get any points killing me.
Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later.
Thanks.
I'll aim at him for real.
Let's go.
[Katou]
Ayumu.
Ayumu!
Ayumu.
Ayumu.
Ayumu...
Calling headquarters.
Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction.
I'm chasing after him.
It's me, Kei-chan.
By any chance...
...he is...?
Suzuki-san.
The two of you, please get as far away from Tokyo as you can.
Hurry up!
I don't want to go!
I want to be with you, Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
I will definitely come pick you up later.
Let's go.
Let's make sure...
...we go to the amusement park.
This way!
Don't... get in my way.
You came to take revenge?
Why did you... have to kill Ayumu?
You also killed your father.
Give Ayumu back!
Someone who killed his father like you...
...can get angry when your brother is killed?
Because of those emotions... you killed your father.
That was to save Ayumu.
It couldn't be helped!
It couldn't be helped?
That's forever your excuse.
You always make that excuse... and run away from everything.
Katou!
Kei-chan.
Please tell me.
What's happening to Kurono-kun?
It's hard to explain, but...
He's fighting...
...to protect you.
For... my sake?
He might... even die.
I'm sorry.
My wife passed away.
I want to get her back.
I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over.
Please run away.
If not, I will have to shoot you.
Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up.
It doesn't work on him at all.
This way!
You're in the way. Move aside!
I give up!
Let's stop.
Let's stop here.
Okay?
What are you shooting?
But...
But...
...he-
[Kojima Tae] someone saying something the same someone saying something again
Oi.
Oi!
Oi!!
You want to know why I killed your brother?
This is revenge.
You people did the same thing to me.
We tasted the same hatred...
...and sorrow.
Like me, you people are...
...not fighting for anyone's sake,
Nor are you protecting anyone.
You're just...
...being controlled by that black sphere.
Katou.
Kurono-kun!
No way...
Kurono-kun.
I got you.
Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
Let's go home.
You mustn't...
You mustn't die.
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
So you're saying that I should keep...
...fighting until forever?
That's why, you...
...made Tae-chan your target?
You can go to that room using it, right?
Hand the ball to me.
[Mission cleared.]
[Damn it Damn it Damn it]
[Someone, crush the alien in this room]
In here?
Not here.
The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are...
We finally found you.
It is you who wished to start this fight.
[Start]
I understand now, GANTZ.
[Choose]
Kei-chan.
How about the aliens?
I don't think all of them have died.
That's great.
That's great?
Because we have to get more points.
What do humans fight for?
What do you people fight for?
For the sake of my loved ones.
When are you gonna keep fighting until?
Until... I can revive my wife.
Stop it.
I have to live.
I...
People in this world are longing to see me.
You're kidding, right?
GANTZ.
Stop it.
Shoot.
I can't stop this fight with you people.
Shoot!
Stop...
...already
Let's... stop this.
Why?
There's no way but to kill him.
Kei-chan.
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Kurono]
[Full points]
[Please choose from the "full points" menu.]
[Full points menu~]
[Forever...]
Oi! What's next?
What is it?
GANTZ is...
...over?
With this...
...no one will be revived.
Neither will us.
No.
There's still... a way out.
Kei-chan.
GANTZ...
...has decided already.
[Kurono-kun]
[Thank you]
Kei-chan?
What did you do?
Everything will end.
No one will be summoned here anymore.
You've gotta be kidding me!
What did you do?
Katou.
Thank you so much...
...for remembering our childhood together.
I...
...was really happy.
But...
...from now on, forget about me.
How can I forget?
How can I forget??
Katou.
Take good care of Ayumu.
We're going back together!
Together!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Thank you very much.
Wanna buy something?
- Yeah, buy me a map.
- Okay.
- I'll take them.
- Oh, thanks.
Map, huh?
Welcome.
Welcome.
"Ayukawa Eriko-san returned to the entertainment industry"
It's confirmed that all of the members present in your list are existent.
Please take some time off for yourself.
We will handle the investigation.
I saw them.
I saw those guys with my own eyes.
That room too.
I was just so close.
I'm made breakfast, so you will do the cleaning.
Okay, hurry up.
Quickly put the mattress away.
Huh?
Well, just that... it feels as if
I haven't seen you for a long time.
You're so strange.
I have... always wanted to do this.
I...
...won't go anywhere anymore.
I know that already, so go to work.
Who... gave me this again?
"Draw the Ferris wheel here"
"To Tae-chan"
"I love you. Kurono Kei"
Kurono... Kei?
[Everyone, please be happy]
You weren't followed?
No.
Better come in.
Trust no one, Jim.
Especially not in the mainstream.
Sit down.
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?
I do.
I want you to go to Budapest.
This is not above board.
Nobody else knows.
They're after my head, Jim boy.
Do you understand?
I have had an offer of service.
A Hungarian general wants to come over.
I would like you to meet him.
He has some information that I need, Jim.
What information?
Treasure.
He has the name of the mole the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service right at the top of the Circus.
There's a rotten apple, Jim.
We have to find it.
Stop!
Would you witness this for me?
I wish I could done more, Control.
You did all you could, Percy.
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.
What about Smiley?
Smiley is leaving with me.
You little prick, Esterhase.
Gentlemen, shall we start?
Under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.
The Treasury don't understand.
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request for a general increase in funding and then you account for the spend on your special operation?
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?
And this London house that nobody knows the address of, is that really necessary?
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.
So where do you propose we meet?
In a café?
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.
I wonder if Karla has the same problem with the Treasury at the Kremlin.
Look, nobody underestimates the importance of the job you chaps are doing.
But what happened in Budapest last year, that was a disaster.
With respect, sir, it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!
For 25 years we've been the only thing standing between them and Karla and Moscow and the third bloody world war.
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.
He's less pleased, though, with the lack of progress with our American cousins.
You see, in their eyes, you're still a leaky ship.
Yes?
Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.
All right, well put him through.
- Hello?
- Is this under Secretary Lacon?
Yes.
My name's Ricki Tarr.
- What do you want?
- I need to meet you.
If you need to confirm who I am, you can talk to my boss at the Circus,
Peter Guillam.
But only Guillam, no one else.
You got clearance for that?
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.
Mind you, no better off in here with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse of the new girl before Bland gets to her.
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.
Came down first thing this morning.
Belinda.
- Peter Guillam.
- Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.
Just ringing to find out...
So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.
And he was late, you see.
- During a raid?
- During a raid, you see.
He said,
"Why aren't you in that shelter?"
- Why weren't you?
- Well, because...
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.
He said Tarr called him from a phone box.
He said there's a mole, right at the top of the Circus, that he's been there for years.
It does mean you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it?
Outside the family.
I'm retired, Oliver.
You fired me.
The thing is, some time ago before Control died, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
That there is a mole.
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?
No.
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...
What did you say to him?
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had rather gotten the better of him and he was going to pull his whole house down.
That bloody mess in Budapest.
Damn it, George.
It's your generation, your legacy.
I would have thought, if there's any truth in it, you'd want to...
I'll keep Peter.
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.
I should like to have him.
Lift up.
And quickly down again.
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.
My friend wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.
No disturbances.
Her real name is just Graham.
Added the Pope for a touch of class.
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat?
# And did those feet in ancient time
# Walk upon England's mountains green #
Oh!
George!
George, get in here!
George.
Sit down.
Take a look at this nonsense.
Report by Soviet high command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.
Just what the admiralty has been begging us for some information on.
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.
Style appalling.
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.
But its topicality makes it suspect.
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.
Where did it come from?
What's the access?
A new secret source of mine.
But how could he possibly have access?
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.
We've named the operation Witchcraft.
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.
Gone straight to the minister.
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.
Too much failure, too many scandals.
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.
Your bloody Yanks!
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.
We need to decide if want to be part of the past or part of the future.
I should have left you where I found you.
- Look!
- Control...
Out, all of you!
If Witchcraft is genuine...
Nothing is genuine any more.
George...
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.
- Peter?
- Hm?
I need you to do something for me.
I'd Polyakov you to go to the Circus.
In the cabinet at the duty officers station are records of staff recently retired.
I'd like photographs of them and of the diagram of the Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline, along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.
Well, he's out walking the battlements.
Oh.
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.
Want some company?
According to the personnel files, seven were due for retirement anyway.
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.
Connie Sachs retired November 28.
That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1.15.
Percy has always resisted any proposal of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.
I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.
Greedy boy.
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.
I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-arms.
- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.
I want on-going access to American intelligence.
You think we can get it?
With Witchcraft on our side, we can get anything we bloody well want.
Fine.
Carry on.
Thank you.
And I strike thee down...
Oh, I, er...
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.
Wicked, wicked George.
I don't know about you, George, but I feel seriously under-fucked.
I heard Ann left you again.
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.
Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.
Why?
Polyakov.
Do you remember him?
From the Soviet Embassy?
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attaché here in London.
When he arrived here 15 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.
He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.
But you disagreed?
There's a story you must have heard that Karla has set up a secret cell.
The personnel are all ex-military, trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.
There are always stories,
Connie.
But what if this story was true?
One night in research
I saw something, George.
There was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin receiving a salute.
Why would you salute a cultural attaché?
Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.
And if he was, why hide the fact?
What did you do?
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.
Here.
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.
You're to leave Polyakov alone.
You're becoming obsessed with him.
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.
What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.
Here we are.
The Nursery in our day.
Jim Prideaux.
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.
The Inseparables.
There's Control himself.
All my boys.
All my lovely boys.
That was a good time, George.
A real war.
Englishmen could be proud then.
So I was right, then?
About Polyakov.
There is a mole.
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?
Aye, I did so.
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.
Can you nae learn to take a bloody order?
Nobody tampers with the recipe!
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.
It'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.
# He's not the first
- # He's not the first
- Oh, well.
- # He's the second best secret agent
- Merry Christmas.
# In the whole wide world
# He's not number one
# But not the worst
# He's just the second best secret agent
# In the whole wide world
# He's every bit
# As good as what's-his-name
# With a dame
# Any dame
# And all those bullet holes are in his vest
# To prove you work a little harder
# When you're second best... #
- Courtesy of Mrs P.
- Hm?
You been up all night?
Yes.
What's this?
Request for £ 1,000 in cash from the Reptile fund.
To a Mr Ellis.
It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.
October 21.
So why was someone giving him
£ 1,000 two months later?
I wonder where he is then, sir.
Settle down now.
- Hand those out.
- Sir.
What is it?
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?
The bells, the bells!
Come here.
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.
My father left, so...
Hm.
Bill.
The unpaid Bill.
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.
Known a lot of Bills in my time.
They've all been gooduns.
What are you good at?
Nothing, sir.
You're a good watcher, though, eh?
Us loners always are.
Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet.
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
- Yes, sir.
This is good, very good.
Hello, Ricki.
You've missed the wedge.
Where have you been, Ricki?
They're going to kill me.
- Who is?
- Your lot.
Or their lot.
Whoever gets me first.
I'm innocent.
Within reason.
How long have you been here?
Sorry, I've run out of places now.
I needed to see you.
Why?
There's a woman.
I need you to trade for her.
I need you to get her back off Karla.
A woman?
Her name's Irina.
This was last November.
Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate who might be persuaded to defect.
Tufty Thesinger, resident.
- Yeah.
- Hiya, Ricki.
- All right, mate?
Did you know him?
No, never met him.
Bit of a drinker.
Hangover from hell.
Bit of a fucking idiot.
Apparently this Russian, name of Boris, was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.
So you were sent to persuade this Boris?
Yeah.
He was your typical Russian.
Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.
Didn't seem to sleep.
Tufty was worn out from following him around.
I think it's going to be a long night, son.
His favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.
It had a hellhole in the basement where the sailors and the tourists went.
Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.
Boris was no delegate.
What delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?
You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr Smiley?
Moscow Centre trained.
# Someone is waiting
# I mean just for you
# Spinning wheel
# Keep on spinning through,
Drop all your troubles... #
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.
Working a letterbox, maybe.
Or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from some mug like me.
So the second night
I went to the import/export outfit that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.
I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.
And that was that.
You were due to fly home the next day.
Yes.
But you didn't.
Boris had a wife.
Common-law.
Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.
You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr Smiley.
Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.
When Boris went out for the night,
I found myself going into her hotel.
So you dropped Boris.
I know.
It was breaking protocol.
But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?
So you didn't come home?
I would have.
Boris was a dead end, but...
Um...
I could...
I could sense something in her.
A secret.
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?
I played this businessman,
Michael Trench.
Holiday romance.
I thought I'd take my time with it.
I know who you are.
I want to talk to your boss.
Control.
I have something to trade.
Something big.
I want a new life in the West.
That's the deal.
You tell them.
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.
If I tell you everything,
I'm putting my life in your hands.
And the lives of other people.
So she told me what she had to trade.
Her secret.
I mean, the mother of all secrets.
I told her I'd alert the Circus.
She made me promise I wouldn't give any of the details to London.
And you agreed?
Yes.
I mean it was...
I couldn't believe
I'd got hold of something this big.
I went back to the import/export, sent the message to the Circus, graded, "Flash, highest priority", just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.
You're supposed to have gone.
London stations have been on to me.
Want to know what the hell you're doing.
Fuck off.
Anything else, Ricki?
I know what I am to the Circus.
I'm one of the scalp-hunters, someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.
I just...
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.
Well, I understand how you felt.
You wanted to do something.
Vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.
Anything more?
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.
- What did you do then?
- I waited for a reply.
I hung around for hours.
I heard the Imsak call to prayer.
So what's that?
That's about 3.30 in the morning.
Then the message comes through.
"'We read you. "
That was all they sent. Nothing.
It didn't make sense.
It was like they were stalling.
Then what happened?
Then, all of a sudden...
...the Russians begin to move.
It was nice work.
I couldn't have done it better myself.
The message was quite clear.
I needed to warn her.
Come on, come on, come on.
I couldn't find her at the airport.
I even looked through all the flight lists and...
I headed down to the harbour.
They put her on a ship to Odessa.
That's all I know.
I've...
I've done a lot of things in my life,
Mr Smiley, but...
I just...
I can't stop thinking about her.
She wasn't even my type.
I've got to get her out.
I owe her that.
Karla will be looking for you.
Everybody's looking for me.
You can't stay here.
It isn't safe.
I said, "You may fuck me but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning. "
OK.
Just need to let you know.
Someone flew into Paris last week on one of our escaped passports.
And?
It was Ricki Tarr.
'Why are you telling me?
- It could be coincidence...
- You are a poisoned dwarf.
'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?
'Mr Esterhase:
"It could be coincidence but... "
Mr Haydon interrupting.
"'You really are a poisoned dwarf,
Toby.
"'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty
"'and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?"'
You look tired.
I didn't sleep well.
You're going to do something for me, Peter.
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions den.
If you're caught,
I'm sorry, but you're alone.
- Last November?
- Hm.
Mr Guillam!
Thank you, Bryant.
How's the family?
Fine. Need to go up to the registry today.
OK, sir.
Now you'll need a yellow one for the bag, sir.
Thank you.
- Good morning, Mr Guillam.
- Morning, Alwyn.
- Want me to look after that for you?
- Thank you.
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.
Dolphin will kill me if I don't.
New rules.
So, chit me.
Thanks.
- Sal, lovely surprise.
- Peter.
- What are you up to this weekend?
- Oh, you know.
Visiting aunts.
I'll bet.
Corridor D.
The two eights are halfway on your right.
The three ones are next alcove down.
Thanks.
Here's a request from Libby Barr from Bromley for "Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now".
Take it away, George.
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.
Can I speak to Mr Guillam, please?
I'm his car mechanic.
Well, I'll just see if he's available.
Hold on, please.
# Mr Wu, what shall I do?
- Oh, Christ!
- Telephone, sir.
- Who is it?
- Outside line, sir. Someone rough.
Sir?
- Hello?
- Your gearbox is bust, sir.
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?
Can't be done, sir.
Well, phone the main dealership first.
Have you got their number?
No.
Hang on. Alwyn!
- Alwyn.
- Sir?
Get me my bag, will you?
- But...
- Just for a second.
Thank you.
Hang on.
- Hello?
- I'm listening.
- Yes. 9-4-60-3-3-5.
- Be right on it, sir.
Thank you.
Peter Guillam.
Could we see you, please?
Percy would like quite an urgent word with you.
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.
Yes, of course.
Throw that into the lift for me.
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.
Will do, sir.
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?
Apart from chasing our virgins.
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.
Apart from that,
I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.
Arabs.
You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?
How's Ricki Tarr these days?
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.
What's that shrug for?
I'm talking to you about the traitor who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.
I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.
Don't damn well shrug at me!
How would you like a term in prison?
Well, I haven't been seeing him.
So get your facts straight and get off my back!
So... if I told you
Tarr had recently arrived in Paris, would you be surprised?
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.
And if I told you we happen to know
£30,000 mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?
Your man's a defector, Guillam.
Turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us.
- What for?
- Never mind what for.
To muddy the water, that's what for.
To spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.
The point is this.
He's heading for home.
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.
Understood?
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.
Get out.
Peter?
Thank you, Belinda.
# Oh, Mr Wu
# What shall I do?
# Oh, Mr Wu
# What shall I do?
# Mr Wu... #
All go smoothly, did it?
I need to go to the hotel to see George.
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.
George?
Mr Guillam...
Sorry it took me so long to come home.
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.
He's been telling us all about his adventures.
He's a double, George.
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.
Karla bought him for £30,000.
I stole that because of you.
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that makes me feel?
Ricki... you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information.
- That's right.
- What was the date?
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.
- She told me Karla...
- November 20th is missing.
Someone is covering their tracks, unless of course you think that's just a coincidence?
What about the money?
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.
...everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit, made in Moscow.
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?
In case I never made it out of the Circus.
I suppose you've got your reading to do.
Come up.
I met him once.
Karla.
In 55.
Moscow Centre was in pieces.
Purge after purge.
Half their agents were jumping ship.
I travelled around, signing them up.
Hundreds of them.
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.
He was on his way back to Russia and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.
There's a little room.
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.
The Americans had had him tortured.
He had no fingernails.
It's incredibly hot.
I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home.
Things weren't going well with Ann.
I give him the usual pitch.
"Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,
"after questioning. "
What did he say?
"Think of your wife.
"You have a wife, don't you?
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.
"Use my lighter.
"We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.
"Think about... "
I kept on...
...harping on about the damn wife, telling him more about me than...
I should have walked out, of course.
"We're not so very different you and I.
"We've both spent our lives
"looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.
"Don't you think it's time to recognise
"there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"
Never said a word.
Not one word.
And the next morning he got back on his plane.
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.
This was a chain-smoker, mind.
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.
He kept my lighter.
It was a gift.
"To George from Ann.
"All my love. "
That was Karla.
He went back to die rather than giving in.
Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.
Because he's a fanatic.
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.
What did he look like?
I can't remember.
After today, Peter, you have to assume they're watching you.
If there's anything you need tidied up, now is the time.
Nearly done.
For God's sake.
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.
If there's someone else, you can tell me.
I'm a grown-up.
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.
Excuse me.
# And I was too proud to give in
# I had to learn the hard way
- # That pride... #
- Peter, when you're ready
Put it on now.
Everybody!
- Jerry.
- George.
- Peter.
- Jerry.
I need to talk to you.
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.
You were duty officer, weren't you?
Yeah. Control asked me to man the phones that night.
He said someone was doing a special job for the service.
He wanted someone he could trust.
Hurricane Henry set to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.
This is from the FO resident clerk.
A Hungarian news bulletin.
"British spy, work name Ellis,
"travelling with false Hungarian papers,
"has attempted to kidnap an unnamed
Hungarian General in Budapest.
"He's been shot.
"Other arrests imminent. "
Can I have a brief, please?
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?
I couldn't get a word out of Control.
So I followed protocol and went for the emergency list.
You rang my house.
Just on the off-chance you were back from Berlin.
What did you say?
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Smiley.
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.
Ann said you wasn't back yet and that was it.
Go on.
All hell broke loose.
Military yelling about
Hungarian tanks on the border.
Lacon and the minister baying at the door.
Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.
- Mr Haydon.
- Not now.
Mr Haydon!
Out!
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.
I got half a story on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.
Jim Prideaux's been shot.
Get me the Hungarian embassy.
You tell your masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.
Yes, sir.
Any more news on him? Sir?
Oh, God.
We need to get down to his flat, clear out anything linked.
Haydon heard the news at his club?
At 1:30? The ticker-tape wouldn't have been running.
So how did he know?
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.
Good flight?
Yes.
Pleasant enough.
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.
She said she'd be down in a minute.
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.
But Ann expressed a liking.
What's keeping her?
Keep going.
Come on, lads. Keep up.
Come on, Bill!
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.
Come here.
Who's that fellow down there?
I don't know, sir.
Who is he?
Beggar man?
Thief?
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car round a field?
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?
I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.
He might steal the Alvis.
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.
Good lad.
How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?
Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.
There's a rotten apple, Jim.
And we have to find it.
What did you make of it, Jim?
Control's theory?
I thought it was madness.
I know that it is one of five men.
All I want from you is one code name.
Alleline.
Tinker.
Haydon.
Tailor.
Bland.
Soldier.
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.
Esterhase.
Poor Man.
And the fifth?
Smiley.
I thought it was madness.
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.
Absolute madness.
But you still went.
Why?
I went because Control asked me to go.
It's called doing one's duty.
At the station I met the legman supposed to take me to the General.
The waiter must have panicked.
It was meant to be a simple snatch job.
They drove me to some military hospital, and then put me on a transport plane.
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.
Then they worked me for...
...I don't know how long.
Weeks, maybe months.
What did you tell them?
Everything.
I held on for as long as I could to let everyone get the hell out of there.
Did they?
My networks in Hungary, did they get out?
No, they were blown.
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.
After the interrogators had cleared out, this little fellow turned up.
Looked like a priest.
That's when they really started on me.
What was your last line of defence, hm?
The mole.
Control's crazy theory.
I was going to bury that so deep they'd never get it out of me.
- Which was a joke.
- Why?
Because they already knew.
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.
No, I don't know her.
Did they ask about me at all?
Yes.
The little fellow did.
What did he say about me?
He had this cigarette lighter.
He kept flashing it about for me to see it.
Showed me the inscription.
- "To George... "
- ... from Ann.
"All my love. "
Karla.
It was odd.
They sent me back to England.
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.
He said when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor.
Who?
Toby Esterhase.
He gave him £1,000 and an Alvis.
Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.
Had to become a lotus eater, forget everything that happened.
Control's theory.
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.
Yes, that's what I thought.
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tinker, Tailor?
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.
She told me
Karla was very proud of this.
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit, made in Moscow.
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.
No, I had a hotel nearby.
They do have some seedy rooms.
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.
She told me
Karla was very proud of this...
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit.
This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?
Perfectly, Minister.
There is a house somewhere in this city where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.
I wouldn't consider that sound advice, given the mess Control left us with.
It has taken Alleline and, if I may say so, myself this long to get us back in the game.
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov.
From Witchcraft to you.
His real role is to receive information from the mole to take back to Karla.
That, er...
That's not possible.
Made possible.
By you in the house you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.
It's just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed.
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.
But you were lazy and greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.
You opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans.
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.
Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have, it wasn't to lure you.
It was to lure the Americans.
Now, do you want to take credit for that?
What can we do?
We have one thing the mole wants.
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.
If I go to Paris,
I want your word that you will get Irina back.
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up like you lot.
You will get her back.
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.
Oh, hello, George.
Hello.
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.
Control recruited you, didn't he?
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.
A wanted man.
Saved your life, I heard.
And yet when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate.
That's understandable, perhaps, with your war experience.
You survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides.
Serve any master.
What? What's...
What's this about, George?
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.
Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.
Someone's been taking files from the Circus.
No, no, no, no. No.
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.
Files were delivered to a Russian attaché, weren't they?
Yes.
And, yes, I delivered them.
But so did Percy Alleline.
Good boy.
Bill Haydon.
And so did Roy Bland.
Things aren't always what they seem, George.
You should know that.
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...
...working for them.
Every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them.
Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.
But Polyakov's our Joe.
- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.
Yes, I know.
George.
- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tinker, Tailor?
- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?
- Westerby?
- Bland.
Or Haydon.
I don't know. One of them.
Or maybe Percy. No.
Well, I don't know who.
You're just the messenger.
Running between them all.
Anything to serve Witchcraft.
I know all about your secret source.
And I know something you don't.
I know who he is.
He's Karla.
One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.
- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.
No, you've got to believe me.
George, please.
I am loyal.
I... I am loyal.
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.
Please, George.
Don't send me back.
Give me the address.
Where do you meet Polyakov?
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!
What is this? Who are you?
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.
Open and all's well, closed and you're not to enter.
And the microphone?
Peter?
The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled
The flame that lit the battle's wreck shone brightly over the dead
Beautiful and proud he stood as born to rule the storm
A creature of blood, a proud though child-like form
The flames rolled on...
Merci. Au revoir.
Go on.
The whole service is looking for you.
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.
You can go now. Leave the books and put the keys in the machines.
No, Ben stays here.
Ricki Tarr claims to have information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.
Mr Smiley?
Taxi approaching Circus.
Tinker.
Tailor.
Here comes Soldier.
Full house.
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- Personal for Tarr from Alleline.
Require clarification before meeting your request.
Quote, information vital to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote
"does not qualify, send further information. "
Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.
I warn you, Ben. We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.
The meeting's over.
They're leaving.
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.
I keep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.
I was rather hoping you might do a little light housekeeping for me.
If I can.
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?
And give her a good cover story.
If it helps, tell her I love her.
It's all there.
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.
I know the inquisitors bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.
It's just a reaction.
An over-reaction, if you like.
I did have one or two questions.
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!
- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.
Or do you think he held back, out of delicacy towards you?
Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on the Hungarian mission?
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.
To say what?
To warn you.
Because he knew deep down it was you all along.
So did you.
I had to pick a side, George.
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.
And the West has become so very ugly.
Don't you think?
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?
I'm not his bloody office boy!
What are you, then, Bill?
I'm someone who's made his mark.
Is there anything particular you want me to pass on to Ann?
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.
Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about.
But you do have a blind spot.
He reck oned if I was known to be Ann's lover, you wouldn't be able to see me straight.
And he was right.
Up to a point.
Up to a point.
I made this for you, sir.
I don't want you hanging around here any more.
Keep away from me from now on.
- Go and join the others.
- But...
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?
Go and play, damn you!
Could you check, Jerry?
Very nearly there, sir.
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?
Occasionally.
Of course! I've seen you in the newspaper.
- You're a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.
Be patient, Snowy, not much longer.
I do beg your pardon.
There.
I believe I have captured something of your likeness.
Not bad!
What do you think, Snowy?
Snowy!
There you are, sir.
Now where's he run off to?
Anything?
Nothing.
Snowy!
Where have you been?
Chasing cats again?
Snowy, look at this!
Triple masted.
Double decks. Fifty guns.
Isn't she a beauty?
That's a very unique specimen, that is.
From an old sea captain's estate.
"The Unicorn."
Unicorn. Man o'war sailing ship.
It's very old, that is. 16th century.
17th, I would think.
- Reign of Charles I.
- Charles II.
That's what I said, Charles II.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.
You won't find another one of these, mate.
And it's only two quid.
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done!
Gently does it.
Excuse me!
Here you go. Careful.
Hey, bud, how much for the boat?
I'm sorry, I just sold it to this young gent.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me what you paid and I'll give you double.
- Double?
- Thanks. But it's not for sale.
Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out.
I don't think you realise this, but you're about to walk into a whole mess of danger.
What kind of danger?
I'm warning you, get rid of the boat and get out while you still can.
These people do not play nice.
What people?
Wonderful!
It's just wonderful.
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?
If you want to buy it, you'll have to talk to the kid.
I see.
Well, let the "kid" name his price.
"Name his price"?
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac and I miss "name your price" by one bleedin' minute!
I'm sorry.
I already explained to the other gentleman.
American he was. All hair oil and no socks.
It's not for sale.
Then let me appeal to your better nature.
I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall, and this ship, as I'm sure you're aware, was once part of the estate.
Of the late sea captain?
The family fell upon hard times.
Lost everything.
They've been living in a cloud of bad luck ever since.
We are talking generations of drinking and irrational behaviour...
I'm sorry.
But as I told you before, it's not for sale.
Good day to you, sir.
That young man, what's his name?
Him? Everybody knows him. That's Tintin.
What is it about this ship?
Why has it attracted so much attention?
What secrets do you hold?
Where is that magnifying glass?
I could have sworn it was...
Where could it possibly be?
Snowy, you haven't seen the...
Where is it?
Thank you.
No, Snowy!
Look what you did.
You broke it!
Bad dog!
Something happened on this ship.
And we're going to the one place that could have the answer.
Come on, Snowy.
Here it is.
"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall, the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn."
"The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676"
"on one of the most ruinous voyages in maritime history."
"Ship never reached destination."
"Attacked by pirates, all hands lost except for one survivor."
"When Sir Francis was rescued and returned home,"
"he was convinced his name had been cursed."
"The Unicorn's manifest stated"
"that it was carrying a cargo of rum and tobacco bound for Europe,"
"but it was long claimed the ship was carrying a secret cargo."
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?
"Historians have tried and failed to discover what happened on that fatal voyage,
"but Sir Francis' last words,
"'Only a true Haddock will discover the secret of the Unicorn. "'
I've missed something, Snowy.
We need to take a closer look at that model.
Of course it's gone!
How could I be so stupid?
How'd you do that?
Clever boy.
A coat of arms.
Why does that look familiar?
Hang on a minute.
That fish!
It's a haddock.
Of course!
Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.
Snowy!
Well done, Snowy!
Good boy.
Well, well, well.
It seems we've caught our thief.
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
I see you let yourself in.
I came to retrieve my property.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.
I think you do.
This ship was stolen from my apartment less than an hour ago.
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr Tintin.
There's no mistake. It belongs to me.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I took it home,
I put it on a cabinet in the living room, and then Snowy chased the cat and knocked it over, and it fell.
This isn't my ship.
No. Indeed.
I'm sorry.
- It looks identical.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.
Yes, indeed. But I don't understand!
Why did Sir Francis make two ships exactly alike?
And you have one already.
Why do you want another?
What is it about this model that would cause someone to steal it?
Goodness me, why so many questions?
It's my job.
There could be a story here.
That's what I do, you see.
Well, it's no great mystery.
Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard and a hopeless reprobate.
He was doomed to fail, and he bequeathed that failure to his sons.
So it's true! The Haddock line is cursed.
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?
That depends what you're looking for.
I'm looking for answers, Mr Sakharine.
You're looking in the wrong place.
It's late.
I think you should go home.
This way, sir.
It's a pity, sir.
I'm sorry?
That the mast broke on your model ship, sir.
I hope you found all the pieces.
Things are so easily lost.
Nestor! Where are you?
Good night, sir.
Some things are easily lost.
What did he mean by that, Snowy?
What was he trying to tell me?
Some things are easily lost.
Snowy!
Great snakes!
What is it, Snowy?
What's this?
This was in the mast!
Good boy, Snowy.
"Three brothers joined."
"Three Unicorns in company"
"sailing in the noonday sun will speak."
"For 'tis from the light that light will dawn."
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."
What are these markings?
Some kind of secret language or code?
It makes no sense.
But it does explain why they ransacked the flat.
They were looking for this, and they didn't find it.
Which means they'll be back.
No, I don't know where he is, dearie.
I think he's gone out.
And anyway, it's after dark, and Mr Tintin is most particular about not admitting visitors after bedtime.
I have to go back to my cocoa.
I've got a very good book and a cup of cocoa.
It's really lovely!
Thank you, Mrs Finch.
I can look after this.
Hey, kid, is that you? Open the door.
What do you want?
Look, the game is up. He's gonna be back.
Now, I know he wanted those boats, but I swear to God,
I never thought he'd kill anyone over it!
Who? Who are you talking about?
I'm trying to tell you that your life is in danger.
Answer me! Who?
Mrs Finch!
A man's been shot on our doorstep!
- Not again.
- Call an ambulance!
No, Snowy!
Can you hear me?
Can you...
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.
He was one of the top agents at Interpol, but we haven't got a clue what he was working on.
Quite right, Thompson.
We're completely clueless.
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?
Steady on, Tintin.
We're still filling out the paperwork.
Police work's not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.
Well, I might have something for you.
Before he lost consciousness,
Dawes tried to tell me something, and I think he was spelling out a word.
"...B- O-U"
"D-J-A-N."
"Karaboudjan."
Karaboudjan!
Does that mean anything to you?
Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary!
What is?
Worthington's have a half-price sale on bowler hats!
Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time.
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?
Canes are half-price, too!
Are you going to take charge of this evidence?
Positively.
Never fear, Tintin, the evidence is safe with us!
Thomson? Where are you?
Well, I'm already downstairs.
Do try to keep up.
Wait! You dropped this.
Good heavens, Thomson!
Look after the evidence, man.
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.
Yes. Our light-fingered larcenist.
- What?
- The pickpocket.
He has no idea what's coming.
Go on, Tintin, take my wallet.
Yes, industrial strength elastic.
Very resourceful.
On the contrary. It was childishly simple.
Simply childish, I agree.
- Tintin.
- Tintin.
Gentlemen.
Mind you, I expect he's miles away by now.
I presume you're referring to the pickpocket?
Yes. I mean, knowing we're just a few steps behind him.
Snowy, what is it, boy? What do you see?
I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?
You're quite mistaken. I'd love one.
My treat.
- I've got you now!
- You devil!
Stop, in the name of the law!
Got you!
What's going on down there?
Come on, Snowy!
- I do beg your pardon.
- Sorry, sir!
The pickpocket, Tintin! He's getting away!
My wallet!
It's gone!
Come on! Snowy, after him!
Stop! Wait!
- Got you!
- Steady on.
I've lost him!
You must find my wallet.
It's very important. I have to get it back.
And you will.
Leave it to the professionals.
We've lost the scroll.
But we haven't lost the story.
"Karaboudjan."
It's an Armenian word.
That's our lead, Snowy.
What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us when he said our lives were in danger?
- Mr Tin... Tin?
- Yes.
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.
Well, that's because it's you that's getting delivered!
Quick, get him in the van!
Get off me, you confounded mutt!
He bit me!
Quick!
Get him off!
Shake him off, then run him over!
I want this on the starboard side!
Not here. Look your side.
Hang on.
- Nothing.
- Well, check that pocket, Tom.
No, I've looked in this one already,
I'm sure of it.
Well, have a look in his socks.
- Have you found it?
- He doesn't have it.
It's not on him, boss. It's not here.
- Not here? Then where is it?
- Where's what?
I am tired of your games.
The scroll, from the Unicorn.
A piece of paper like this!
You mean the poem?
Yes.
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes!
I don't have it.
You know the value of that scroll.
Why else would you take it?
Two ships and two scrolls, both part of a puzzle.
You have one, you need the other.
But that's not it. There's something else.
I will find it, with or without your help.
You need to think about exactly how useful you are to me.
- We'll deal with him on the way.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Hold this course.
Snowy!
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.
He's lying! He must have the scroll.
The question is, what has he done with it?
We searched him all over, boss.
I want you to go back down there and make him talk.
Break every bone in his body if you have to!
That's nasty.
You know the stakes.
You know what we're playing for. Just do it!
Mr Sakharine! Mr Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!
It's a disaster!
The captain has come around.
- What?
- He's conscious.
He's accusing you of mutiny.
- He says you turned the crew against him.
- Sounds like he's sobered up again.
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him another bottle.
Aye, sir!
Okay.
- Jiggle it a bit, it's just stuck.
- Jiggle?
Here.
What are you doing? Get off!
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bolted it from the inside!
So you want to play like that then, do you, Tintin?
Get the TNT.
Broken crates. Rope. Champagne.
What else do we have, Snowy?
There are other ways to open this door.
They'll be swabbing the decks with your innards when we're done with you.
Give it here.
- Don't move.
- What...
Let's go!
Let me have him!
He's got a big shooter!
He got me!
Hold your fire.
He ain't here. He's vanished.
He's hiding.
Search the ship. Quickly!
A giant rat of Sumatra!
So, you thought you could sneak in behind me and catch me with my trousers down, huh?
I'd rather you kept your trousers on, if it's all the same to you.
- I know your game. You're one of them.
- Sorry?
- They sent you here to kill me, huh?
- Look, I don't know who you are!
That's how he's planned to bump me off.
Murdered in my bed by a baby-faced assassin!
Assassin? Look, you've got it all wrong.
I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.
The filthy swine.
He's turned the whole crew against me!
Who?
A sour-faced man with a sugary name.
He's bought them all off, every last man.
Sakharine!
Nobody takes my ship!
You're the captain?
Of course I'm the captain.
Who else could I be?
I've been locked in this room for days with only whisky to sustain my mortal soul.
Well, I assumed it was locked.
Well, it's not.
Now, you must excuse me.
If they find me here, they'll kill me.
I have to keep moving.
Try and find my way off this drunken tub.
"Tub"? Tub?
Tub?
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
I'm Tintin, by the way.
Haddock. Archibald Haddock.
There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.
Hang on a second.
Did you say "Haddock"?
How could you let them escape?
Find them. Find them both.
- Don't worry, we'll kill them, sir.
- No.
You can kill the boy. Not Haddock.
What? He's just a hopeless old soak.
We should've killed him long since.
You think it's an accident that I chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew,
Haddock's treacherous first mate?
Nothing is an accident.
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock and I.
We've unfinished business.
And this time, I'm going to make him pay.
We have to reach a locked door at the end of this corridor. This is gonna be tricky.
You wouldn't happen to be related to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall, would you?
Why do you ask?
It's for a story I've been working on.
An old shipwreck that happened off the coast of Barbados.
A man o'war. Triple masted. Fifty guns.
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.
The secret of that ship is known only to my family!
It's been passed down from generation to generation.
My granddaddy himself, with his dying breath, told me the tale.
And?
Gone.
What do you mean, gone?
I was so upset when he kicked the bucket,
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.
When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!
I'd forgotten it all.
- Everything?
- Every last word.
Well, is there somebody else in your family?
Maybe they would know.
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed.
I am the last of the Haddocks!
Did you say three sons?
Let's check below!
There is a bottle of rum for the man who finds Haddock.
And kill the boy. Hope I find him first.
What's that?
You're hearing things.
Quiet, Ali.
There's nothing there.
Let's go up.
I know what Sakharine's looking for.
- What are you raving on about?
- It was written on the scroll.
"Three brothers joined."
"Three Unicorns in company sailing in the noonday sun will speak."
Really?
Sir Francis didn't make two models of the Unicorn.
He made three!
Three ships for three sons.
Excellent!
Sakharine's after the third model ship.
Barnacles! Someone's locked the door!
- Well, is there a key?
- A key?
Yes, now, that would be the problem.
Mr Jaggerman!
Top bunk in the centre. Keeper of the keys.
Careful, mind. He's a restless sleeper on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.
- He lost his eyelids?
- Aye.
Now, that was a card game to remember.
You really had to be there.
I'd do this myself, Tintin, but you've a lighter tread and less chance of waking the boys.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- You've nothing to worry about.
Provided they all stay asleep.
I wouldn't get too close to Mr Hobbs.
He's very handy with a razor.
And I'd steer clear of Mr Gitch.
Sacked as a shepherd on account of his "animal husbandry."
Not the sandwich.
The keys!
You're a brave lad, Tintin.
My heart was in my mouth,
I don't mind telling you.
Well, that is, if it was my heart.
Judging by my stomach, it could've been anything, really.
Hurry up, Captain! We've no time to lose.
Bingo!
Just the necessities, of course.
To the lifeboats.
Ease it in!
Put your back into it!
Hold her there, steady!
Any sign of him, Jumbo?
Nothing yet. Watch yourself.
The boss says he's a handful.
Come on.
It's Allan.
- Is that the bridge?
- Aye, on the other side of the radio room.
Radio room?
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone comes.
Careful, Tintin.
I can't see a thing!
Quit your whining and find the kid!
I didn't sign on for this!
Keep searching!
- Message just come through, boss.
- What's it say?
"The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
Waiting in the wings for action."
"Milanese Nightingale"?
Now pray this cheers him up.
"Bagghar."
What's this?
"The Sultanate of Bagghar"
"ruled over by Sheikh Omar Ben Salaad,"
"whose love of music and culture is matched only by his love of..."
Great snakes!
Bagghar.
The Port of Bagghar.
Morocco.
Tintin!
Hey! Put your hands up!
And let that be a lesson to you!
Help me!
In here! He's in here!
Here! By the lifeboats!
Out of the way!
After him! Get him!
Quick, quick, in here!
Over there!
Why, you little...
- He's up there!
- Go!
I can see him now!
Don't let them get away!
Help me!
- Turn this ship around!
- Aye, sir!
Get me a flare!
Captain, get down! Get down!
- There he is!
- Get out of the way!
Now! Full ahead! Full speed!
Got you now.
Stay down.
Look! Down there!
Idiots! You idiots! What have you done?
We killed them, boss, like you wanted!
No! Not like I wanted!
I needed Haddock alive!
Wait a minute, boss!
There are two boats missing!
So, that one must have been a decoy.
They're onto us, and our destination.
Find them! Make absolutely certain they never reach Bagghar!
Yes, boss.
Get up there!
We have to get to Bagghar ahead of Sakharine.
I know. I know.
Why?
Because he has the third model ship.
How do you know?
The Sheikh collects old ships. And this is the prize of his collection.
Blistering blue barnacles, that is the Unicorn!
Captain, do you see the distortion around the model?
Aye.
It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.
And Sakharine is going there to steal it!
Yes, he has a secret weapon.
The Milanese Nightingale.
But that won't be enough to solve the mystery, and that is why Sakharine needs you.
That's why he made you his prisoner.
There is something he needs you to remember.
I don't follow you.
I read it in a book.
That only a true Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn.
I don't remember anything about anything.
But you must know about your ancestors,
Sir Francis. It's your family legacy!
My memory is not what it used to be.
- Well, what did it used to be?
- I've forgotten.
Captain, can you get us to Bagghar?
What sort of a stupid question is that?
Give me those oars!
I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie.
I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft of ginger and his irritating dog!
I am master and commander of the seas!
I know these waters better than the warts on my mother's face!
Look at the pair of them. Fast asleep.
Typical landlubbers.
Aye, no stamina these days.
Never mind. I'll get you there, Tintin.
Look, Thomson. There's the fellow.
Oh, my.
- Mr Silk?
- Yes?
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson.
- We're police officers!
- We're police officers!
Oh, crumbs.
Good gracious!
- Mr Silk!
- Mr Silk!
- Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Are you okay?
Poor fellow!
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, sir?
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you, that's very kind.
- No need to run away, sir.
- No, no, you see, yesterday we very nearly caught the pickpocket who's been terrorising the town!
Pickpocket?
We pulled his jacket off and inside we found a wallet.
A wallet with your name and address!
- That's my wallet.
- Well, it's obvious he stole it from you.
- No, no, that's my wallet.
- Are you all right, sir?
We didn't mean to startle you.
Let us help you into your apartment.
Thank you so much. No need to come in.
I'll be quite all right, really.
- No, we insist.
- Better safe than sorry.
- It's the least we can do.
- Thank you.
There we are.
Good grief! What's all this?
It's my collection?
- What a lot of wallets!
- I can't help it.
It started with coin purses and sort of went on from there, really.
You want to be careful. Haven't you heard?
There's a pickpocket about.
- Yes, he'd love this. Can you imagine?
- What do you mean, "pickpocket"?
A master criminal.
A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering, wallet-lifting sneak thief!
I'm not a bad person.
I'm a kleptomaniac.
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.
Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets in the living room.
Wallets. I just can't resist the lovely little things.
It's a harmless little habit, really.
Good heavens, Thomson, look at this!
His name's Thompson, too.
What a coincidence.
No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a "P," as in "psychic."
No, no, no, it's Thompson with a "P," as in "psychologist."
Look at this one!
A green one that I managed to pick from a pickpocket actually pickpocketing at the time.
- And this one! Cuir de cochon.
- No, you have it all wrong.
- There is a "P" in "psychic."
- I am not your sidekick! You are mine!
- Smell it, won't you? Piggy leather!
- No, you have it all wrong.
- How dare you!
- How dare you!
- I met you first.
- I met you first.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.
- Didn't!
- Did!
- Listen! I can't stand it any more!
- Hey!
All right, I'll come quietly.
Take them! Take them! Take them all!
Stop it. Pull yourself together, man!
We can't take your wallets!
Do we look like thieves?
Good heavens, Thompson.
This looks familiar.
Can't be.
It is!
- Tintin!
- Tintin!
I'm so cold.
And thirsty.
My throat is parched.
Let's see if there's any fresh water.
What have we here?
Tintin.
Come and warm yourself, laddie.
Captain?
- What have you done?
- No need to thank me.
What?
Well, you looked a little cold, so I lit a wee fire.
In a boat?
No! Those are our oars! We need those oars!
Yes, but not for much longer.
Have you gone mad?
Quick, Captain, help me!
- Captain, help me, quick!
- He's right. What have I done?
- What have I done?
- No, Captain, not that!
Thundering typhoons!
Well, this is a fine mess.
- I'm weak.
- We're stranded here...
- Selfish.
...with no hope of rescue...
I'm hopeless.
While Sakharine and his men are halfway to Bagghar.
Poor, miserable wretch!
Yes, all right. That's enough of that.
It was his fault, you see.
It was Sir Francis.
Tell me, how did you work that one out?
Because he was a figurehead of great courage and bold exploits.
No one like him ever existed in my family.
Why do you think I drink?
Because I know I'll never be like him.
No, it's far better that I end it now.
Put us both out of our misery.
What is it, Snowy?
I'm gonna lower myself into the sea.
Into the cold embrace of the big blue!
Those are Portuguese markings.
- Are you even listening?
- Where is the Karaboudjan registered?
We're saved.
We're saved!
It's a sign from above!
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.
Slave-traders! Mutant malingerers!
Freshwater politicians!
Bad news, Captain.
We've only got one bullet.
- And what's the good news?
- We've got one bullet.
You got him!
Well done, my boy.
Stay here, Captain.
Tintin?
- Don't take your eyes off of them.
- Hurry up!
Just as I thought.
The ignition lead has been cut.
Lucky shot!
One more pass, and we will finish them off.
Put your hands in the air.
Now!
Let's see here.
You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?
More or less.
Well, which is it? More or less?
Relax. I interviewed a pilot once.
Which way to North Africa?
Captain, look!
We've caught up with them.
Wonderful!
But you think we might find another way to North Africa that doesn't take us through that Wall of Death?
We can't turn back.
Not now.
No, Captain! Those are surgical spirits for medicinal purposes only.
Quite right, laddie, quite right.
No, no, no!
The fuel tank! It's almost empty!
Captain! This may sound crazy, but I've got a plan.
The alcohol in that bottle may give us a few more miles.
I need you to climb out of the plane and pour it into the fuel tank.
Christopher Columbus!
There's a terrible storm out there.
And it's raining.
And you call yourself a Haddock?
Captain!
Captain! Can you hear me?
Captain!
Captain?
You're doing fine!
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.
We're running on fumes.
Fumes!
Oh, no.
Captain! I can't see!
Land! Land!
We can't! We're not there yet!
No, land!
No, no, no, starboard!
Starboard! Starboard!
Hang on, Tintin!
I'm coming!
The Land of Thirst.
- The Land of Thirst.
- Will you stop saying that?
You don't understand. I've run out.
I've run out.
You don't know what that means.
Captain, we have to keep going.
One step at a time. Come on, on your feet!
Lean your weight on me.
A man can only hang on so long without his vitals.
Captain, calm down.
There are worse things than sobering up.
Look! Tintin!
We're saved.
Water. Water!
Stop! Captain!
It's just a mirage!
But it was here. I saw it.
It was just your mind playing tricks.
It's the heat!
I have to go home.
- What?
- I have to go back to the sea.
Captain, you're hallucinating.
Look.
Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?
She's turning into the wind, all sails set.
Triple masted.
Double decks. Fifty guns.
The Unicorn?
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes! Yes, she is!
Tell me, Captain, what else can you see?
She's got the wind behind her.
Look at the pace she's setting!
Barely a day out of Barbados, a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco and the hearts of the sailors set for home.
The red pennant.
The blood runs cold in every sea captain who looks upon that flag, for he knows he's facing a fight to the death.
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.
And Haddocks don't flee.
All hands on deck!
Gunners to their stations!
Let's unload the King's shot into these yellow-bellied, lily-livered sea slugs!
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr Nicholls.
- Aye-aye, Captain!
Prepare to bring her about!
Fire!
Portside gun, fire!
Look lively, lads!
- Mr Nicholls, secure the cargo.
- Right you are, sir.
Prepare to repel all boarders!
This way! We need more men!
And then he saw him.
Like a phantom, rising from the dead.
Who?
Captain, who did he see?
It's gone.
What do you mean, gone?
What happened next?
By Jupiter, I have a beard!
Since when did I have a beard?
Captain, something happened on the Unicorn.
It's the key to everything.
You must try to remember.
The Unicorn? What? I'm so terribly thirsty.
- Captain!
- Tintin!
What is happening to me?
And to think all it took was a day in the Sahara.
Congratulations, Captain, you're sober.
Sober.
Good dog!
This one's alive.
- Check the other!
- Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
We owe you our lives.
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid.
He's still suffering the effects of acute dehydration. He's quite delirious.
Why don't we pay him a visit?
Haddock! You're awake.
Good! I have a visitor for you.
- Captain?
- Hello!
I think you've got the wrong room.
Captain, it's Tintin.
Our plane crashed in the desert.
Don't you remember?
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself.
I never fly if I can help it.
He's got me confused with someone else.
What is this peculiar liquid?
There's no bouquet.
It's completely transparent.
Why, it's water.
What will they think of next?
We suspect he has a concussion.
Heatstroke. Delirium.
He's sober.
Now, Captain, out in the desert...
- The desert?
- Yes. You were talking about Sir Francis.
- Sir who?
- Sir Francis.
And you were telling me about what happened on the Unicorn.
- The unicorn!
- Yes!
The stuff that dreams are made of.
Wee children's dreams.
No, the ship.
Please try to remember, Captain.
Lives are at risk.
Snowy, what have you done?
I'd stand back if I were you.
Out! Everybody out of the room!
Snowy!
This man is insane!
Show yourself, Red Rackham!
If it's a fight you want, you've met your match!
A fight with who?
To the death, Red Rackham!
No, wait!
Wait. Captain...
I remember everything now.
Everything Granddaddy told me.
The Unicorn was taken.
The pirates were now masters of the ship.
The crew surrendered?
Granddaddy said that Red Rackham called Sir Francis the King's dog.
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim their hard-won plunder.
Why would I waste my time on rum, tobacco, molasses and dates when you have a more valuable cargo onboard?
Where is it?
You'll have to kill me first.
Not first, no.
Please.
I'll start with your men.
To save his men, he would give up the secret cargo.
And where was it?
Four hundredweight of gold, jewels and treasure.
Kill his men!
No, Rackham! No!
Rackham, you gave me your word! Rackham!
Rackham!
Sir Francis knew he was doomed.
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.
But they didn't reckon on one thing!
Sir Francis was a Haddock.
And a Haddock always has a trick up his sleeve.
And with that, he hurls himself forward!
On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?
No! No, on a bottle of rum rolling on the deck.
And he opens it up, and puts it to his lips, and...
And then he stops.
"This is no time for drinking," he says.
"I need all my wits about me."
With that, he puts down the bottle and...
Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle...
And he seizes a cutlass.
And then he makes his way to the ship's magazine, where they keep all the gunpowder and the shot!
You dog!
You'd blow us sky high?
Come on, then.
Let's have you.
Not this time.
You!
Captain, what is it?
How could I be so blind?
What are you talking about?
This isn't just about the scrolls or...
Or the treasure that went down with the ship.
It's me.
It's me he's after!
You'll suffer a curse upon you and your name, Haddock.
He wants vengeance.
Come back and face me!
- Hurry, Tintin.
- What?
- We're out of time.
- Captain!
I curse you!
I curse your name and all who come after!
We will meet again, Haddock!
In another time! In another life!
It's not over. It was never over!
I don't understand. Who's after your blood?
- Sakharine!
- Sakharine? Why?
He's Red Rackham's descendent!
He means to finish it!
- That's why he did it.
- Did what?
Sank his own ship. Sir Francis sent that treasure to the bottom of the sea.
He would be damned before he let Red Rackham have it.
- And he was.
- But he couldn't let it lie.
- No.
- He left a clue.
Three clues wrapped in a riddle, concealing a secret.
But only a true Haddock would be able to solve it.
- What secret?
- The location.
To one of the greatest sunken treasures in all history.
The wreck of the Unicorn.
He means to steal it! The third scroll!
Billions of blue, blistering barnacles!
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him!
To Bagghar.
He's here.
It's no good. They could be anywhere.
Captain.
Don't look now, but we're being followed.
Yes, we are.
What do you want?
Why are you following us?
Who are you working for?
Captain, stop! Stop!
- Thompson and Thomson.
- Not so loud.
- We're in disguise.
- So I see.
You got the message I sent from the ship?
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that.
The upshot is we caught the thief, retrieved your wallet, and then hopped on the next plane to Bagghar.
Yes, that pocket picker has picked his last pocket.
There. Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.
It's not the money I'm worried about.
The odds are even.
Now, to find the next two scrolls.
The Milanese Nightingale.
That's his secret weapon?
- My!
- My!
What a dish.
Enchanted, signora!
Benvenuto! Welcome! Marhaba!
We are blessed with your presence.
Yes. Indeed, Signor Salad!
What charming peasants.
May I introduce my escort,
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.
He's been very passionate in his support of this concert.
It's my first visit to the Third World.
Please forgive me. I must escort madame to her dressing room. Excuse us.
After you.
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello...
Here. I want you to look after this.
- What are you doing?
- Me?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
If I'm caught,
I don't want them to find this on me.
Look, just keep it hidden.
I will guard this with my life!
Get up! Get up!
It's her!
Blistering barnacles!
What's that noise?
My ears,
- they're bleeding.
- No, they're not.
Captain.
Shut up, Snowy.
Oh, Columbus, it's every man for himself!
Make way.
Make way! Medical emergency.
That was close.
Hello, Captain.
You!
Oh, no!
Sakharine!
The falcon! Snowy, after him!
Tintin! Tintin!
Those two! There!
They're here to steal your ship!
No, no, no, no, no, we're not!
Arrest him! The ugly one!
- No, wait!
- Who, me?
Yes!
Thief! Arrest him!
Captain!
- Sakharine's got the scroll!
- It's worse than that.
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll, Tintin. It's gone.
How? What happened?
It was Allan.
He knobbled me in the garden, and then
- there was a bottle of alcohol and...
- There always is.
No, no! No, not like that.
I can smell it on you.
Hurry. Back to the boat.
- Tintin! Where are you going?
- I'm going after Sakharine.
- By yourself?
- Yes!
Come on, Snowy!
Catch them, catch them!
Lose them! Get him off our tail!
Did you hit anything?
Oh, dear.
Faster, you idiot, faster!
Not again!
- I'll have those, thank you.
- Come on, Snowy!
No!
Incoming falcon at four o'clock!
Tintin, faster!
- The scrolls!
- I got one, two...
And three!
Snowy!
Oh, no! Not again.
Come here, my beauty.
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
Come here, you pilfering parakeet!
Captain, the bird! Grab it!
Nice work, Snowy! Don't let him go!
You blue blistering barnacles!
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I'm coming!
There he is! Stop!
That's right, that's right, come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.
Gotcha!
No!
Geronimo!
You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
Gotcha!
The scrolls are lining up.
These are hidden numbers.
What does it say?
I wouldn't do that if I were you!
Let the bird go.
What do you value more, those scrolls or Haddock's life?
Don't listen to him.
You'll never get away with this, you sour-faced sassonack!
I will kill him.
Don't worry about me, Tintin, I'm fine.
Let the bird go now, or this man dies!
No! Wait!
You two-timing troglodyte!
You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer!
Perhaps we should put it to the test.
Here's mud in your eye.
Fathead!
Captain!
- We're saved!
- I love the beach.
- You said you wanted a holiday.
- Quite.
Very good.
- Nobody takes my ship!
- They've already taken it.
Nobody takes my ship twice!
We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?
All right then, what's the plan?
There is no plan.
Of course there's a plan.
You've always got a plan.
Not this time.
Sakharine has the scrolls.
They'll lead him to the treasure.
It could be anywhere in the world.
We'll never see him again.
It's over.
I thought you were an optimist.
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.
That's just another name for a quitter.
You can call me what you like.
Don't you get it? We failed.
"Failed."
There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure.
A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse!
Don't you ever say it of yourself.
You send out the wrong signal.
That is what people pick up.
Do you understand?
You care about something, you fight for it.
You hit a wall, you push through it.
There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin.
You can never let it defeat you.
What did you just say?
You hit a wall, you push through it.
No, no, no, you said something about sending out a signal.
Of course! Captain!
I sent a radio message from the Karaboudjan.
I know what radio frequency they're transmitting on.
Well, how does that help us?
All we have to do is send that information to Interpol, they can track the signals and figure out which way they're headed.
Here comes Interpol now.
- Tintin!
- Tintin!
Any port they enter we'll know at once.
And we can get there first.
What are we doing here, boss? I don't get it.
We're right back where we started.
You're to speak of this to no one.
Keep your mouths shut.
- Don't worry. As long as we get our share.
- You'll get your share.
- Where are you going?
- Just guard the ship.
Where's the filthy moolah?
Good evening, sir.
I trust you had a successful trip abroad.
Do I pay you to talk to me?
You don't pay me at all.
What the blazes? Nestor!
Nestor!
Tom! Allan!
You blithering idiots, don't just stand there! Do something!
Caught him like a rat in a trap.
Congratulations, gentlemen. He's all yours.
Yes! We also have an arrest warrant issued by both Interpol and the FBI.
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby.
He was one of their agents.
Hot on Sakharine's trail from the start.
It still doesn't make sense.
He has the key to the treasure of the Unicorn, which is sitting somewhere on the ocean floor.
Why would he come back home?
Right.
- Sakharine?
- Sakharine?
That's Mr Sakharine to you.
Hold it.
- Look out!
- What...
Oh, no!
Allan! Allan, get me down!
What? Not that way!
Not that way, you fool, the other way!
Right.
Look out!
Good Lord! Come on!
Close but no cigar!
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.
Just as Sir Francis was yours.
Unfinished business.
I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock.
Until you could remember, killing you wouldn't have been this much fun.
Who gave you permission to board my ship?
I don't need it.
I've never needed it.
The legend says only a Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn, but it took a Rackham to get the job done.
So you've lost again, Haddock.
That's right. Why don't you have a drink?
That's all you've got left, isn't it?
Everything that was rightfully yours is now mine.
Including this ship.
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.
We have you now, you devil.
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise, you are under arrest.
Do you see?
Blistering barnacles, they're coordinates.
- It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
- Latitude and longitude.
That is it.
That's the location of the treasure.
We did it!
Almost there, Mr Tintin!
A nudge to starboard should do it.
- Are you sure we're on course?
- Trust me, laddie.
I know these parts like the back of my hand.
Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!
Aye, Captain, starboard it is!
All stop!
Marlinspike Hall.
Those coordinates lead here.
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?
I thought the treasure went down with the ship.
Master Haddock, Mr Tintin,
I've been expecting you.
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
Will you look at this place?
I don't think it's changed at all since I was a wee boy.
And may I say, sir, how much I'm looking forward to having a Haddock back in charge of the estate.
You'll be waiting a long time, Nestor.
There's no way I could afford to live here!
Well, Captain, you know the house.
Where do we start?
Is the cellar still here?
No, no, no, no, this isn't it.
I meant the other cellar.
I'm sorry, sir, there is no "other cellar."
It was bigger than this.
Snowy.
Snowy, where are you?
No, Hector.
Hector.
Captain, help me.
Heel, boy.
Snowy?
Just like you said, Captain.
You hit a wall... you push through it.
My grandfather must have walled it up before he lost the house.
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."
Well, I can see the cross, but where's the eagle?
St John the Evangelist, who was always depicted with an eagle.
And he's called the Eagle of Patmos.
He is the eagle.
What's he trying to tell us, Captain?
I'm at a loss.
That island, the one in the middle, that doesn't exist.
How do you know?
Because I've sailed those waters countless times.
I've been there. It's a mistake.
What if it isn't?
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance to go to a man who was worthy of it.
A man like himself, who knows the seas like the back of his hand.
A man who could look at a globe and tell if one tiny island was out of place.
Blistering treasure.
It's Red Rackham's barnacles!
What is this?
Just a wee tipple.
A toast to our good fortune.
That's better.
It's odd, really. You would've thought, after all the fuss and bother, there would've been more.
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.
I mean, by your account, he looted half of South America. I just thought...
Never mind. There's plenty to go around.
It's a funny old life, eh?
Well, you've got your story for your newspaper.
All's well that ends well.
It's not ended.
Sir Francis left another clue at the bottom of the globe.
- A clue to what?
- Four hundredweight of gold, just lying at the bottom of the sea.
How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?
Unquenchable, Tintin.
[486][533]WRECKED

As the body was in the same area...
This is just too crazy this can not be really happening.
But it is. Sorry.
Honey , I need to tell you something.

No Jack that is not it.
What?
Just Nothing. No.
I  go to  go to  fish market.
- You okay?

I have to go running. I love you.
They always return to the scene of the crime.
Do not cross the tape line .
You need to check for enemies that she made at DA (district attorney).
I  called over there and they will send you a list of convictions from the last 3 years.
What you got here , anything?
We should not  tell you this, but the coroner called, found the ring.
You can be the expert witness .
They found it inside her Pussy , jack.
One area that we heard you knew very well.
Honey ,Where have you been?
What wrong? I was running.
How do you say this?
I got home and...
... there was a message from your father.
There has been an accident Jack.
Is your mom. She's dead.
She walked across that bridge every day for 30 years.
She Usually got up at 6am.
I was in the workshop until 10pm.
I always in such a hurry.
I always say she must be  more careful but never listens to me.
She wouldnot listnen to anyone, Dad.
- Thanks, baby.
- you are welcomed.
Too much rain.
The river will overrun its banks.
I talked to the people in her division,
I called his supervisor and he said...
... she was out for a few days so maybe there was a threat.
I saw and talked to the husband he is cleared such he has been sick .
There is nothing else new except that the FBI called to find something on her PC.
- were there prints?
- No prints.
Jack, you need to concentrate on your father.
We all be at the funeral.
- Call me if anything comes up.
- I will do.
The father is here, it's time, baby.
My old mother, God bless her soul died giving me birth.
I never knew her though somehow she lives on within me.
And Often I hear her speak .
In the rain and wind.
The soul is a force to be reckon with.
Often you will not die , you will refuse
It will continue on within all of us.
The FBI says that if the ring serves several people more secure.
The ring placement fits her profile.
So that I discarded as a suspect.
But not connected
I have no problems.
There was one in Reno and one in Sacramento.
The FBI will be in our office tomorrow.
The officer in charge is a idiot. Son of Quantico.
I've been 6 years in the law enforcement and I never had case like this.
Do not get too excited  Jack.
If this is a serial murderer , they have jurisdiction.
As for as I am concerned
This new information clears you right way .
Who is he? He looks like FBI , this guy.
He is technician from the lab. They want to take a DNA swap from you.
Now? At my mother 's funeral?
I know you're right, but please Jack do it .
I clear you officially soon and I need you in this case.
You can do it by the van.
- Finally fell asleep.
- Good.
You do not have to do that, baby. Leave it for tomorrow.
I've never left a dish dirty in the sink overnight.
I am not about to start now. Have a drink.
- Want one?
- No, I'm fine.
He'll be alright.
He is already talking about working tomorrow.
I just can not imagine him alone in this house.
He has never wash a dish in his entire life.
Maybe we should move here.
No.

Dad You and mama never wear wedding ring?

Sure she got jewelery in the bottom drawer of the bureau.
I should have buried it with her.
Jack!
I got to go back, the FBI has a list there are other victims in other states.
Oh My God , Jesus Jack!
Could not be just a coincidence , just two killings?
No, the killer has very distinct signature.
It is very graphic.
They were killed by the same person Ana.
- Your mother.
- No, I'm sure about that .
So What do you mean by this?
Ana,What it means that you got to carry a gun.

15 years tell them what your husband do.
- He is a mechanic.
- Great
Fixes my old TV for free. It's a bargain.
Would you say that these happily married, Jack.?
Yes. very.
As has been married for a while you do not have much sex.
Sometimes you might look up old girlfriends to see what they have been up to.
Agent Vukovitch:  why you donot get to the point and cut this bullshit out?
Jack is the best detective that I ever worked with.
He has closed more cases than anyone in the city so please...
... stop wasting our time.
I had no idea I was in the presence of  greatness. we got two names on the list here.
If you are familiar with these two photos,
We may have a very strange situation here.
This is Mary Barnes, went to college with her.
This was long ago I...
Laura.
Laura...
McCoy.
Just for the record Have you recently gone to Reno or Sacramento?
No.
That is Too bad, I would facilitated the work.
Did you have sexual  relation with these two women?
Are you familiar with loactions where the bodies were found?
Any connection between them?
Can you Draw line between them
No .... No
No obvious connection.
This is very exciting how many women have you been with?
More than you.
Look Jack every women you have ever been  with is at risk.
I may be an asshole but you gonna to answer everyone of  my questions.
We need full and complete list.
For every women
I've been slept with?
Kiss,filrt up , finger, whatever.
Is it a problem?
This is the first time left a note.
Elijah, Samaria, it seems biblical.
I will Check with the father Harlam.
Please, no!
God forgive you, little girl.
He has a plan for you.
As it has a plan for me.
You need an army.
And I'll lead it
No pain.
Listen father.
I need to be re instated ,It is obvious that there is no connection between me and any of these murders .
Not until DNA comes back
- That  take a few days.
- So I still suspect?
That's all We got.
Why do not you show Jack the list. to see if he can circle off few more names?
This is list of all  the unresolved female murder came us across the country in past year.
We got 4 victims. Violent Sexual assault , suffocate , necks broken.
Bruises and ligature marks indicate torture before death.
The bodies have been positioned.
Also the Acrylic fibers and rubber resides he just transport the victims
Who were dead and alive in the trunk of his car.
The killer leaves two very distinct signatures .
The wedding ring is placed
Inside the vagina. and  post mortem small incisions  were cross you miss
With razor like instrument carved in the toungue of victim in the shape of cross.
So It's obvious that a strong man able to control these women  easily.
Psychological problems.
Most likely bed wetter trouble childhood problematic. He killed the neighbor's cat.
There are two more.
Maria Duarte, in Las Vegas.
Sharleen Bell, San Quin.
Both raped, necks broken.
Duarte had an earring placed inside her vagina and  Sharleen wall crucifixed.
Who would you talk about these stuffs?
I donot tell anybody ant this stuff.
Does anyone know about your sexual adventures?
A psychiatrist, a priest, your wife.
No one.
Let me ask you one more question.
Did you fuck your mother?
Jack!
Enough, Jack.!
Just , Fucking donot.
Alright It is lunch?
- Tell me how many.
- I've never counted.
They are propably close to 100.
- This is perfect.
- surely.
How many men have you slept with?
- I imagine that.
Go home. Make a list.
Think about it, Meditate. we are not in rush here,
We have a lot of time.
We need contacts, e- mail, telephones.
One more thing.
We'll have to exume your mother body.
Elijah was a prophet in the Old Testament but
This quote is not it. but the Josaia free.
A prophet is like a saint.
Not exactly.
In the biblical sense It is a man called by God to be his spkesman,  messenger.
A prophet communicates with the Lord through visions , exctasy.
Often they are thought to be insane.
They deliver God  prophecies  through written word, sermons, symbolic acts.
You are Not supposed to be here Jack.
Go on father.
Here's the book Josaia,
Chapter 13, verse 16.
Samaria '' '' That is the ancient Israel.
It will be held guilty for ''she have they rebelled against their God.''
They shall fall by the sword ''. the little one shall be dashed in pieces.''
And the pregnant women  '' shall be ripped open.''
Is this young woman pregnant?
No, but her wedding ring was taken from finger and placed in her vagina.
What is the context of that quote?
It is rather a gruesome prophecy.
It is a curse by
God on the nation.
For their sins against his will he would close the nation wounds .
This is the Bible.
The Bible is about both good and evil.
What you described is desecration of the body.
It is evil.
By the book, Otherwise it will just cause troubles. let me take off the case
I am not staying home women are dying because of me.
I am  at stake here.
- How is  Ana?
- A patrol monitors.
- I mean How is she holding up?
- she is not happy.
I'll drive you home to your dad.
- But you said you were safe.
- Some things are not wise.
This is unbelievable.
"Tr . anslated By Dr. Ahmed .Hakim"
This can not be happening.
Look I need you to take some time off. few weeks at least. You'll be safe at home. you do not tell me what to do.
I will not not lock myself away. I have a job here ,  responsibilities. ( vcie president !)
Ana, you are in danger. this is serious,  people  are dying.
I am not taking time off, Jack.
And you cannot change my mind.
Anyway,  I have noticed that , they are  watching me.
This is crazy.
If you notice anything strange. anybody that seem out the ordinary to you.
-you  make sure you call it.
- Of course.
They will be watching you.
- Will you be back tonight?
- Yah I will be back around 12.
I can not tell my
Dad on the phone.
- What will you gone to tell him?
- The truth.
Bye, honey.
Do me a favor, do not put me on the list.
I would not do that.
She knows. women have a sense.
- Jenny that was a long time.
- Believe me, she knows.
I thought you wanted me to go by the book.
Cut the shit Jack, I can take care of myself.
Close to a 100 really?
And what about you?
How many for you ?
I do not know, maybe 20.
None past year, but who's counting.
I did not marry until I was 40.
I guess I dated alot never seemed strange to me.
- Are you still doing the wives?
- No.
The changed it to white cotton panties.
He was always very proud of you and me...
... you know how I feel.
I've been a cop dad for 28 years.
I donot have to like it.
- Does Ana know about all of this?
- Yes.
She walked across that bridge every day for 30 years.
It doesnot make sense  for me that she just falled.
Tomorrow we will know more, we will draw and learn in one day.
It's a nice spot we have got there.
I drove up Yesterday  .
White roses are blooming.
It's not descent to disturb her
I love seeing a grandson.
Dad, you know you can not ana having children. That's not fair.
I need you.
Do what you need to.
There's been another murder in a massage center in town.
Which one?
- Which one?
- Which one? her name is Li Sung.
Hello, welcome to your nightmare.
Hello, Jenny.
If you are looking for men who like opening may be you should apply

If you stopped wasting your time accused may save one life.
Do not tell me how to do my job.

How can this happen?
How does this guy know?
There is women tonight 
         there is no way to know about
The other victims...
... it was only  one night thing.
I  literally know her for one night.
We got drunk. nobody could have known. Nobody.
The answer is right in front of you.
I wish it was that easy.
This girl you met her in the party about 5 years ago.
She was wearing a black dress. you Talked to her at least 5 
  min before you introduce me .
Her name was Leslie.
Leslie Tail.
I knew you had slept with her. I knew it.
Women know.
We can tell.
Ask the women on your list.
That is what the killer is doing.
Her name is Sung Li  .
She work at the massage
 of that is in the 3rd.
I followed him once.
Stop, please.
Why are you doing this?
For my brothers and sisters.
They are innocent souls.
I have two little children.
You should not fear the work of God.
Now you mark it.
So when you come the kingdom of heaven;
Lord knows...
...That  I have sent you home.
You will born again.
As one of the Christ devine soldiers
I will make sure they have their avengence. wait, wait
I do remember something about Jack.
Something I have heard.
Something embarrassing.
Excuse would you mind?
No.
 I am leaving anyway.
Do not do that, I will be devastated.
- We have the same coffee schedule  .
-'' The Breakfast of Champions.''
- I'm John.
- Goodbye John.
You have to contact every women on this list.
Concentrate on these in the top
You'll be thrilled to hear from me Jack.
Why?
If you're right and this guy extract other names and locations from the victims .
Then at least it derrange logic to it.
Ya ,  Ellie Nelson , she definitely knows Charleen .
Sarah Richardson , she would know Sung Lie because that was around the same time 
Not exactly 100 years ago
Overestimated your charm? no I only overestimaed my memory
I have got 12 men working
 and entire task force .
I can do nothing unless u get me all the information.
- I am trying.
- Try harder.
Are you busy for dinner tonight?
Eat me.
- may be for desserts.
- knock it off.
I spent the morning with
Josaia book. Interesting.
Israel is portrayed as an unfaithful pride.
The country is welthy, successful but lost its moral compass , its faith in God.
It Calls for the divine vengeance.
Only then will  be there salvation.
 30 years you are doing nothingbut hanging
 around hundred wome why the change?
Because I fell in love.
I see there is not one women on this list since you have ben married
- What is your point?
- Have you been faithful?
With all these hundreds of women I am sure you messed up at least one happy jealous husband or two.
It is very possible.
Circle all the names of those were married when you met.
What are you doing you and what about your task force?
There have been 6 murders, I have got 2 agents working each one.
We have  interviewed everyone of your

Fuck you.
What can I say? This is a list of women with whom I went to bed.
I will not apologize. Is my life.

I told you. If you want to talk about this we will, but now I can not.
I do not want, I told you I'm not interested.
- It seems you do not understand.
- Understand that?
Make your own list and we'll see.
How many times have you slept with each of these women?
- At what point?
- I think you like...
... bed one night.
Before meeting perhaps I was 12 relationships.
I slept with them many
Sometimes, perhaps hundreds of times.
How many times have we slept?
I do not know.
Take the account. I
I fucked more than you.
I like to fuck, Jack.
I am a sexual person.
- And this list is not complete.
- What do you mean?
You know.
And to whom I refer.
Are you Jack. Verdon?
Yes, I'm Jack. Verdon.
- Do you know who I am?
- No. Who?
Sarah Richards was my wife.
The detective told me Sotor who died because of you.
An animal that raped and murdered because of you.
Is it true?
My children will grow up without their mother.
You know what it is to grow up without parents?
Look me in the face.
Quiet, drops the gun!
I have it.
I remember you. Sorry, a lot.
Fuck!
Jack, the dog.
Fuck, Sotor.
The husband of Sarah Richards tried to shoot me because of you.
Why my fault?
Will not you come by the back door?
I do not care with whom or with which you slept, we need all the names.
With a man...
... ever.
Do not be ashamed, my brother is a bit loose.
I do not know who he is.
Do you think our suspect did this?
It is our guy.
The fingers crushed.
No wedding ring.
Not even find out where it is.
Was raped?
I did not look closely, you leave that job to the coroner.
William Thomas was called Lincoln.
Your wallet is over there.
Perhaps in an orgy?
The notes, fetuses, we this testing.
You it is challenging to decipher.
We find this under the bed.
Malacai.
Malacai on many issues is the last chapter of the Old Testament.
Not much is known that, since not mentioned much in the Bible.
The name means '' Malacai '' messenger in Hebrew.
I read the book of Josei.
It is allegorical. Josei equivalent
Israel as the unfaithful wife.
God was very angry with Israel.
Here is a quote from Malacai.
'' I will send you Elijah the prophet before the arrival of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
And will turn the hearts of parents against children.
And the hearts of children against parents.''
It is Elijah again.
It was prophesied to come and is preparing the road.
What Jizabel?
The pagan queen Simeria.
Elijah had Jízabel a terrible fight of faith.
And the name Jizabel mean weakness.
A gift. You can read all about it.
Do you think they would recognize this guy if you saw?
- I met someone at the cafe.
- Does anyone again?
- What are you thinking about Jenny?
- Do you think I have not thought of?
Every man who smiles at me street makes me a psychopath.
It is a fun way to live your life.
How to Flame?
John.
I do not know the name.
- What do you do?
- Is a consultant.
Where?
You do not know the name or where he works.
He asked me to take a drink with him tonight.
I need you to know.
Come later.
- Do you gather here?
- If you do not mind.
Ask him few questions but not act like you're my dad.
I just want you to be safe ok?
I want you happy , but I want you safe.
I guess if the guy who slept hundreds could find her listed.
You'll find someone.
Jack, do not let it slip away ana.
Do not let this ruin what they have.
Something does not fit here.
The wedding ring.
What do you mean?
And if we are so close that the symbol is not the ring.
In some other items used victims.
And this is also the sexual aspect.
What if the symbolic act is not about sex but where you put it?
Puts it in the vagina.
No, in the womb.
Giving birth.
Remember what I said about the father Harlam that pregnant women will be open?
Yes.
I sent a fetus.

Whether your computer's ready or not, there are only 318 days till the year 2000.
A group of corporations concerned about the problems related to the Y2K computer bug have convened...
No. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hi. Everything's gonna be okay, pal.
Come here, come here. Yeah.
That's a good boy. Okay, don't cry.
She can't hurt you anymore.
It's over. Come here.
No one's gonna hurt you ever again.
My name is Louis Hicks.
I'm an investigative reporter.
I cover stories of killers and criminals.
Their lives are dark, without hope.
I try not to let it affect me, but it's hard.
- Hey! Gordo! Two shots.
- No!
- Yes, yes.
- No, no, no, no.
- I got to work in an hour.
- Just one, just one.
- No, no.
- One shot, old-school.
- One. One shot.
- There it is.
- To Louis.
- Yeah.
All right, now you do something for me.
Let me buy you breakfast.
Too late. I already ate.
Breakfast of champions.
How's work? Any compelling real-life stories I should know about?
Not today.
Well...
How's work for you, huh?
You working on the book?
Always. Always working, Gordo.
So, speaking of which, what's up on the work front?
Are you gonna take the university thing?
Me, an adjunct professor?
I suspect a few ethics questions remain.
Louis, you're a good writer.
You're a good investigator. Maybe...
Maybe this teaching thing is what you need to put it all back together.
You know? You know, show them that you can hold down a job, stay in one place, a little stability.
Hey, maybe get more visitation time with Adam.
That would be nice.
How often you get to see him?
Weekends. Yeah. Most weekends.
Louis, pal, I worry about you.
Come on, the truth is, you don't do so well on your own, you know?
What are you trying to say, Gordo?
Oh, God. The natives are getting restless.
- There it is.
- I got to go.
Thanks anyway, Gordo.
What would you do without me?
Can I get the check, please?
- Hey!
- Hey.
I thought you were coming over later.
Yeah, I just thought we should talk first.
You're wearing your wedding ring again?
I'm sick of this, Louis. I'm sick of it!
Felicia, wait.
I'm done waiting! I'm done!
Maybe your wife can handle it, but I can't.
Can't believe that son of a bitch! Whatever.
You want to go back to your wife, fine.
Good luck. I'm done, done!
You've been crying.
You prosecuted Sampson Raines for those murders last year.
Was it fun, Felicia?
Making all those headlines? I bet it was.
A lot more fun than taking on a low profile child abuse case, which got zero media coverage.
The boy! Are you the boy's father?
No. No, I'm not, Felicia.
I'm his guardian angel.
Let's see...
"Felicia Carson, single, lives alone, dies today. "
See? It's written.
So, it's gonna have to happen.
Felicia?
Felicia?
Felicia!
911. What's your emergency?
I need an ambulance, 717 Oak Lane.
Are you hurt, sir?
No, there's so much blood.
Is someone else hurt? I need more specifics.
Hey!
Stay out of it!
Felicia Carson, Assistant District Attorney.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.
Well, well, look who it is.
No, no, let him through.
Louis Hicks. What's the matter?
Work a little slow?
Glued to your police scanner again?
I was the one that found her. I called it in.
- What were you doing here?
- We're friends.
Friends? What happened to your head?
There was somebody inside the house with her.
When he saw me, he took off. I chased him.
We got into it, and he slammed me into a dumpster.
- I'll sign for it. Just get her on the bus.
- Okay.
You chased him, he slammed you.
Where'd he go?
I don't know. I lost him. Man, I just...
He... It's like he just vanished.
Vanished? How?
You know, he was there, and then he was gone.
So, what happened next?
I just passed out.
Louis, what the hell happened to you?
Hold on there. Come here. Let's get an ID.
This your friend?
Pretty girl. It's a shame.
Load her up.
She was a good person.
Who would want to do this to her?
An Assistant DA? Someone she put away, someone who wants attention, maybe random.
Does this look random to you?
No, it looks crazy, serial crazy.
When was the last time you saw her?
- I don't know. Around 6:00.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
- Where?
Outside her office building.
How long you two been together?
Two months. Maybe more.
We met on a story.
Sampson Raines murders.
I remember the case.
What I wrote in that article was nothing personal.
Of course not.
Wait here.
I'll get someone to take a full statement.
I'll help any way I can.
The department appreciates your cooperation.
See you later, Gordo.
That guy's a real prick.
Hey, he took what you wrote about him pretty hard.
You think?
I broke up with her tonight, Gordo.
I can't help but think, you know, if I hadn't, you know, she was upset, her guard was down.
This is not your fault. Come on.
Let's get somebody to look at that head of yours. Come on.
Coming!
Hey, buddy! I missed you, man!
- Can I borrow your laptop?
- You know where it is.
Gina?
Morning, Louis. Did you forget?
No, no, I just had a rough night.
Of course. Let me guess, you were busy researching a really hot story.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you gonna take your son to the park this morning or not?
Louis, you made a huge deal about how important every weekend is to you now.
Yes. Yes, I am.
Fine. Look, I was gonna run some errands,
- but if you're a mess again...
- No! No! I'm not a mess!
This, this, this is a mess.
Morning, Hicks. Miss.
Missus. Mrs. Hicks.
Detective Becker, this is my wife, Gina.
What can I do for you?
I wanted to follow up on a couple of things from the Carson murder last night.
Murder?
Felicia Carson, an Assistant DA, was murdered in her home last night.
Your husband found the body.
Someone I knew was killed last night.
I'm sorry. A woman you knew?
A source. From the last Journal piece.
My apologies for the early morning.
I just wanted to get right on it.
Wouldn't want to be accused of sloppy police work in another true-crime article.
Okay. Adam, honey, let's go.
But I want to see Dad.
Yeah, I know, baby. Not today.
Daddy's busy.
Gina, wait.
But I want to watch the policeman.
- Adam, now, please.
- Gina.
Look, this is a bad time. Why don't you give me a call later this afternoon?
What gave that away?
Hey. A woman is dead.
Good day.
Gina.
Gina!
Gina, wait a second.
I'm sorry, but I was involved.
You are always involved, just never with the people who matter.
Are you serious? A woman was killed.
- What? A woman that you were fucking.
- I wasn't fucking her.
Besides, we've been separated for six months.
Yeah, and I noticed that you're still wearing your ring. Nice.
Stop it.
Listen, I saw the guy who did this, and I chased him.
Save it for the goddamn book, Louis!
I don't care anymore!
I'm sure it'll be great.
Especially a firsthand account.
I mean, you knew the victim intimately.
I don't know. God, I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just want to come home.
No. You can't do that.
You can't do that to me, not like this.
You seriously need to get your shit together, Louis.
Gina, wait.
Hey, buddy.
Sit back, baby.
Shit.
He's gonna kill more of them.
Hi. You've reached my cell.
Can't come to the phone right now, but leave a brief message with your phone number, even if you think I have it.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can, unless I forget.
Wait for the beep. You know what to do.
Louis. What's going on? You okay?
We got to talk. Can I come in?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Come on. What time is it?
I went back to where I lost the guy.
You did... What the hell for?
You're gonna love this, Gordo.
You're gonna love this.
I got his journal, and he's gonna kill again.
I got names. I got dates.
Wait, from what? From this journal?
Yes. And that's not all I got.
I got a print.
Louis, this is evidence.
You're gonna give it to Becker.
Screw Becker. No, I can't trust Becker.
I need you to run it for me.
Becker's in charge on this.
Look, any and all evidence you've got to turn in.
You promise you run the print,
I'll turn the journal in first thing.
Give me the damn thing.
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- Okay. All right.
Hey! Thank you, Gordo.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's not nice to read someone's private thoughts.
How'd you get in here?
I knew that I had recognized you.
You used to be quite a writer.
You had a genuine empathy for the outsiders, for the outcasts.
I try to understand people without judging them.
Why they do what they do.
Why are you doing this?
I'm just putting things right.
Are you interviewing me?
For your next book, perhaps?
You want to be interviewed?
The truth is, you won't be writing any more books, Mr. Hicks.
My journal, please.
This interview is over.
You just ruined a perfectly good jacket.
Get your hands in the air!
Hold on, hold on!
- Put the shovel down!
- There's a guy and a gun!
- Put the shovel down!
- On the ground! Now!
- It's my house!
- On the ground!
- It's my house! There's a man inside!
- On the ground, sir!
- There's a man in there with a gun!
- Up against the wall.
- There's a man and a gun.
- Now! Now! Move it! Move it!
Just relax.
- There's a guy inside.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clear!
Bedroom clear.
Bathroom clear.
Louis Hall, architect, Louis Barnes, sales representative,
Louis Hayes,
Community Brotherhood Project.
You're a man of many faces.
I'm an investigative reporter.
An investigative reporter.
And you recognized him?
It's the same guy.
This accurately matches your description?
That's him. That's definitely him.
Fine. Circulate it.
Okay, so, your door was locked, no sign of forced entry.
How'd he get in?
I don't know.
I see.
And you say he came in here looking for a journal, his journal?
Yes.
Which you should've turned in.
And you obviously know that withholding evidence is a crime.
All right. Let me get this straight.
A killer, who only you saw, breaks in here, steals the only proof you have of his existence.
You think I made this up?
I broke my own window?
I put these cuts on my face?
A security guard at the Federal Building saw Felicia arguing with a man after work.
Would that be you?
Yes.
What were you fighting about?
Am I a suspect here?
I don't know. You tell me.
I mean, at 6:00, you two were fighting, and at midnight, she's dead.
Listen to me.
He plans to kill again.
More people are gonna die, a lot more.
I mean, I saw names, dates, surveillance photos.
I mean, we got to figure out a way to stop this guy.
"We"? "We" got to figure it out?
It's not enough for you to write about these nut jobs?
You got to get in on the action, huh?
I just don't want to see any more people hurt.
But don't you?
I mean, doesn't that make for a better book?
I mean, it's a hell of a career comeback.
The Killer Who Can't Be Caught.:
Personal Interviews by Louis Hicks.
Get out of my house.
Spoken like a truly innocent man.
Hey!
Geez. Look how big he is.
- How old is he now? What, six?
- Seven in a few weeks.
They grow up before you know it.
You don't know the half of it.
You get anything off that fingerprint?
Yeah. One hit. Nothing very useful.
"James Keech, Caucasian male, height, 4'7",
"residence, Trinity Home for Boys, no known family, age 11."
Yeah. He's a kid popped up on the state welfare database.
- Yeah.
- An orphan in some group home up in Brooksville.
Not your guy, huh?
About 30 years too young.
I don't get it. It doesn't make sense.
I know how you feel.
I'm sorry about Felicia.
What's your point?
You need to stay away from this, Louis.
You're too close to it.
Becker's really got it in for you.
And when he kills again?
He's planning two more victims in the next three days.
We're on it.
Let Becker do his job.
Right. 'Cause he's just so good at it.
I got to go. I'm just trying to help.
Thanks anyway, Gordo.
Shit.
Victoria Ihling.
April 19th.
Anne Brighton.
April 22nd.
Felicia.
Felicia Carson. Anne Brighton. Vicki Ihling.
What do you have in common?
- Hello? Hey!
- Kayla, Louis Hicks.
Listen, you still doing DNA matches for Uncle Sam?
Yeah.
I'm doing another story.
I might need a favor.
Anytime.
Great. Thanks.
- Jax! Louis Hicks.
- Hey, man.
I might need you to run some names for me.
You got to help me, Louis.
Listen, I'll tail him for a few days, and I'll get some pictures taken.
Son of a bitch! I know it!
I know she's cheating on me!
I know, I know. We'll take care of it, buddy.
Listen, you got something for me?
Yeah, right. Okay.
One of these is the needle in the proverbial haystack.
There's over 30 Anne Brightons in the metro area alone.
But Victoria Ihling, there's just two hits.
One of them deceased, and the other one,
God bless her, is one of those who likes to spread her life all over the Web.
I mean, these women, they put it out there for everyone to see and then they complain about stalkers, you know?
What do I know?
You did good, buddy. You did good.
Anytime. Anytime, Hicks.
But you owe me one.
Yes.
Hi. Vicki Ihling, please?
Louis Hicks with the Journal.
Yes, and I'm writing an exposé on animal rights abuses in the food industry.
Yes, ma'am.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
I will see you later.
Miss Ihling.
- May I help you?
- Louis Hicks.
We spoke on the phone this morning.
How did you know where I work?
Sorry. Your webpage. I'm a reporter.
I'm on a deadline.
I just had a few more questions.
You know what? I'm in kind of a rush.
It'll only take you a couple minutes.
Can I buy you a cup of coffee or...
You know what? Why don't you give me your card, and I'll call you?
Better yet, I'll call you.
- Tomorrow morning fine?
- It's fine. Bye.
- Sorry to have bothered you.
- Okay, thanks. Have a good day.
You, too.
No, come on. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Come on.
Please don't. Please.
Come on. No. Come on. No. No.
- Everything all right?
- It's fine. Fine, thanks.
Doesn't sound fine.
Piece of cake.
- There you go. You're all set.
- I don't know how to thank you.
I do. Dinner tonight. And you're buying.
On a teacher's salary? I don't think so.
I guess it's on me then.
All right, that's more like it.
Anne Brighton, please.
Deceased? Sorry for your loss.
Hello. May I speak to Anne Brighton, please?
I see. Did she leave a forwarding address?
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Vicki home?
You must be Louis.
I'm Shelly, her roommate.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry. Vicki's not here.
She's not?
No. She told me to tell you that she's sorry, but she couldn't make it.
Why is that?
Tell you the truth, she's very insecure.
She panicked. She got nervous about going out with a guy she just met.
Well, can you at least tell me where she went?
She's gonna kill me.
The Griffin Room. It's about eight blocks that way. You turn left on 3rd.
Hey! Hey, wait!
- Hey, there.
- How you doing?
I'll have a... I'll have what the lady's having.
You got it.
Hi.
- Is this seat taken?
- It is now.
It is a crime how we treat our teachers.
So, where do you teach?
Washington Elementary.
Really? I knew someone there.
- A teacher?
- No, a student, actually.
- A little boy.
- Who?
A little orphan boy.
He played a bit rough with a stray cat.
Teacher told on him.
Sent him back to his group home.
Yeah. He didn't much like it there.
Hey, you all right?
I have to go to the restroom. Excuse me.
- Hey!
- Hey!
It was a mangy, old stray.
No one was going to miss it.
It was a fucking cat!
No.
No.
God, please.
You're too late.
He's got a gun!
Look, I can't talk right now. I got a whack job with a gun down at the Griffin.
Gordo! It's me!
I know who the hell it is.
I can't talk right now. I got to go.
No, no, Gordo, no!
It's me they saw with the gun!
I tried to stop him!
What are you talk... What? Who? Who?
The same guy that killed Felicia. I tried...
He murdered again!
He's gonna kill another one in 48 hours.
Louis, where are you?
I... I...
I can't stop him.
Every time I try, he just disappears.
Where are you? I'm gonna come get you.
I can't come in! I can't!
They won't believe me!
Louis! If you run, I can't help you!
Louis!
Damn it!
Hicks, police! Come on out!
Hicks!
- Bedroom clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
To the right!
Backyard clear.
Nobody home.
No, he's not crazy at all.
He'll claim he was tracking the killer, re-creating his diary.
Jesus Christ. Could there be more?
Other unsolveds?
You know, Hicks warned that there would be other killings.
I'm on it.
Hey, Marty. Louis Hicks.
Hey, buddy.
Remember that thing
I kept your name out of?
Yeah.
You said to call if I ever needed to borrow one.
Four door okay?
Brother, as long as it's got four wheels,
I'm good.
In local news, a woman was brutally murdered in the Griffin Room bar downtown.
Eyewitnesses report seeing an armed man flee the premises on foot.
Police are urging anyone with information leading to the capture and arrest of the suspect to call the urgent...
- Hello?
- Hey, Hicks? Kayla Pierce.
Hey.
I ran the DNA sample.
And?
And the blood on the cloth and the blood off the kid's prints, they're an exact match.
What kid?
Right.
It's an exact match? Are you sure?
Well, as far as I can tell.
Could a father and son have the same DNA?
Well, all men have a copy of their father's Y chromosome, but this is more than that.
I mean, this looks like the same person.
Or I guess it could be a twin, but it would have to be an identical twin.
I mean, a fraternal twin wouldn't do.
Is there room for error?
There always is. It's not a perfect science.
I mean, normally, DNA are compared at only a few spots along the sample.
I could run more tests.
That'd be great, Kayla. I owe you one.
You owe me a lot more than that, handsome.
See you.
Trinity Home for Boys.
Now move on! Go!
- May I help you?
- I sure hope so.
They said to speak to Polly, second office on the left.
Come in.
Hi. I'm Polly, the overworked and underpaid social worker.
Louis Hayes. I'm with the Community Brotherhood Project.
- Mr. Hayes, have a seat, please.
- Thank you.
I'm here on behalf of one of your kids.
James Keech?
Why is that?
Well, we run a corporately sponsored
Big Brother outreach program.
James' name came up as a possible candidate.
James? Really?
You seem surprised.
Perhaps someone applied on his behalf?
No. No living family.
Where did you say you worked again?
Community Brotherhood Project.
Part of the mayor's new joint-outreach initiative.
Right. Yeah, I've heard of that.
Don't you think
James could benefit from some guidance?
Yes, of course. He's a very bright kid.
Aptitude scores, especially in math.
Well, when he cares enough to apply himself.
It's just... I'm not sure that he's ready.
His social skills aren't terrific.
He can be a handful.
I think there are other kids that would be much more suitable...
Well, it sounds to me like this is the one kid that would benefit most from our mentoring.
May I take a look at his file?
You know, it's just words on paper.
Come with me.
I have to warn you, he's been returned by every foster family we've managed to place him with.
And he's getting to that age where, well, let's face it, even the best of them get less adorable as they get older.
Let's just try and stay positive.
See if the kid's not due for a change of luck.
I like your attitude.
I wish the rest of my colleagues thought that way.
- You wait here. I'll go get him.
- Of course.
James? There's a gentleman here from the Community Brotherhood...
Come on. He's very nice.
- James, this is Mr. Hayes.
- You could call me Louis.
James, Mr. Hayes is our guest.
Hi.
Can you give me a moment alone with him, please?
Sure. I'll be right over there.
Hey, buddy, how old are you?
What the fuck you want, mister?
- Well, I asked to meet you.
- What for?
Well, I run a Big Brother program.
We go to group homes, take kids on trips.
You know, stuff like that.
- Why?
- Just for fun.
Is there anything special you'd like to do?
Really?
Try me.
It's what he wants.
And how am I going to gain the boy's trust if I can't deliver?
Look, Mr. Hayes, I have to ask.
Why this child?
Well, couldn't you ask that of any one of them?
That's a good point, but he's had a very tragic childhood.
Both his aunt and mother were murdered four years apart.
- How?
- Horribly.
His mother was torn apart.
Dissected and left in a bathtub.
The police found him, a baby, in the apartment with her.
He had been there for hours with the body.
If someone hadn't called in an anonymous tip, he might not ever have survived.
- They ever catch the killer?
- Not as far as I know.
James went to live with an aunt.
It was a less than ideal situation.
Drugs, domestic abuse.
He went into foster care, and right after, the boyfriend killed the aunt and killed himself.
- Some sort of murder-suicide thing.
- And the father?
There is no father.
Take a look for yourself.
The lot across the street had a camera.
- You see anyone else?
- No.
There were witnesses outside.
Nothing landed but the window he shot out.
Bartender said he saw her talking to another guy.
Okay, then find me that guy.
Because right now, the only guy is right there.
And guess what?
The last victim was dissected.
Same MO as his ex-girlfriend.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
No, but I think you're being a little too personal on this one, Ed.
Come on, it's Hicks. I know the guy.
He's not a killer.
Fine. Let's just get your boyfriend off the streets, so he doesn't get himself into more trouble.
Yes, may I speak to Anne Brighton, please?
My condolences.
Sorry to have bothered you.
They're beautiful, aren't they?
They're killers.
No one's gonna want to mess with them.
I guess not.
What do you want to be when you grow up, James?
I don't know.
- Astronaut.
- Really? That's cool.
Are you angry at somebody, James?
I get angry, too, sometimes.
Hell, I might even want to get even with the person who made me angry.
Yeah, I could hurt them really bad.
You could, but then you'd be as bad as they are.
I bet if some guy were trying to kill you, you'd kill him first.
Protect my family. Yeah, I guess I would.
Yeah.
I probably won't be an astronaut.
Don't say that, James.
You could be anything you wanna be.
- I'm really good at math.
- See? There you go.
You could be a scientist or a programmer, an inventor, even.
Yeah, right. Like I'll have a chance.
I live in a fucking group-home orphanage, remember?
- Come on, man. Don't say that.
- It's true. You want me to lie?
No, I don't.
The penguins like it better when I lie.
- The penguins?
- Stupid nuns.
"No, Sister, I didn't break the window. "
"Yes, Sister, I did my homework. "
They're just...
James, let me ask you something.
You ever seen this man before?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- You really think I could be an inventor?
- Of course I do.
I could build a space ship that travels really fast.
Like, faster than the speed of light.
So fast that it gets to where it's going before it ever left in the first place, ending up in the past.
- A time machine.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I could go back to the past, fix my life.
What do you mean, fix your life?
No, I feel like such a ball head.
I don't know if that goes there or not.
So, how did it go?
It was all right.
- Louis is pretty cool.
- Pretty cool.
Thanks.
You're welcome, James.
It was nice hanging out with you.
All right, James, time for dinner.
No, I want to show Louis something.
Come on.
This your bed?
So, you wanted to show me something?
I don't know.
I've never shown this to anyone.
It's secret.
But we're friends, right?
Yes. Yes, we are.
Promise not to tell anyone.
Especially the penguins.
Okay.
Cross your heart and hope to die.
I do.
Cross my heart...
Cross my heart...
...and hope to die.
...and hope to die.
Okay.
The reason I wanted to go to the zoo is because
I make my own zoos.
They're personal and private to me, but I'll show you them if you promise you'll come back and visit.
Okay, I promise.
You're too late.
I made it myself.
No one helped me.
James, these animals are dead.
You hurt them.
You don't understand. I made this myself.
Forget it! I knew
I shouldn't have shown you! I knew it!
No, I'm glad you showed me. It's just...
Get out of here! Get out of here! I hate you!
Why'd you come? You're not my friend!
No, I am your friend. It's just, sometimes, friends have to say things that are difficult to hear.
Fuck you! Fuck you, fucker! I hate you!
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- He tried to hurt me!
- He tried to touch me!
- No. No, I...
He tried to touch me here, like my other parents did.
- No. No, I didn't.
- Make him leave!
I know. This is just something he says because he gets attention for saying it.
Now I really think you should go.
Do you know what he has in there?
You promised! You swore!
Hope to die! Hope to die!
No, I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry.
- You should go.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Kayla?
- I ran more tests.
- And?
- I got the lab to myself, but only for the next hour.
You've got to see this. It's insane.
I'm on my way.
Well, the tests were consistent.
The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me.
- So it's the same person?
- Absolutely.
But here's the crazy thing.
It's the cloth itself.
I've never seen a weave structure like this before.
You should take a look.
Here, that's the sample you gave me.
Go ahead.
Okay, I can see it.
Now watch this.
When I apply the heat lamp, the strands actually expand.
And when I take it away, they contract.
Cloth that reacts to temperature.
Is that military?
I have no idea.
But whoever invented this could make a fortune.
Unless it hasn't been invented yet.
I could build a space ship.
Ending up in the past.
A time machine.
Thanks, Kayla.
Well, the tests were consistent.
The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me.
- So it's the same person?
- Absolutely.
I could go back to the past, fix my life.
Why are you doing this?
I'm just putting things right.
Oh, shit!
This is Gordon.
It's me, Gordo.
Where the fuck are you?
Man, it doesn't matter.
What matters is that I figured it out.
It's pretty insane, but I figured it out, Gordo.
Yeah. Right, right. Are you okay?
What if you thought a little boy was a killer?
What are you talking about?
We thought the fingerprint from the journal was the killer's.
It's not. It's the kid's.
It matches because the kid is the killer.
The killer's DNA matches the kid's exactly.
The guy wears cloth that hasn't been invented yet.
And the piece of paper from his journal, well, it's dated 20 years from now.
It all makes sense. That's why he's always one step ahead of me.
It's the kid's older self. Do you get it?
He's traveling through time, and he's gonna kill again tomorrow, Gordo.
- You hear me?
- Yeah.
- He's gonna kill again.
- Louis. Louis, you know I'm here for you, right, pal?
I will always be here for you.
You son of a bitch.
What?
Tracing the call. You son of a...
Louis, Louis! You got it?
Not an exact pinpoint, but we got the general area.
He's 20 to 50 miles up north on Route 14.
Let's go. Everyone, come on, get out there.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Hi. Sorry, but you're listed, and I needed to talk.
Of course.
You've had a hell of a day.
He's a very troubled boy. Don't fool yourself.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Yes, please.
Do you think people are born evil, or does the world make them that way?
That's a big question.
I think people are basically good.
Evil's an accident.
An error. An error of growing up that causes people to make the wrong choices for what they think are the right reasons.
So, you don't think people intend evil?
No. I've seen too many kids.
They wanna be good.
Then life just doesn't work a certain way, and wrong choices have a way of multiplying.
Even Hitler didn't think he was evil.
He thought he was saving the world.
Manson, too, in his own way.
But what if you could kill Manson or Hitler when he's still a child?
No way. They're children.
They're not Hitler or Manson. Not yet, no.
You're talking about James.
He's had a troubled life, but there's hope for him.
- He's just a child.
- People are dead because of him.
- Who? James?
- And more people are gonna die.
- What are you talking about?
- What's your name?
What?
- Your name. What's your name?
- Polly.
Anne.
Anne is my birth name, but because of my sunny disposition, my friends called me Pollyanna.
Polly for short.
It's a nickname that sort of stuck.
What is going on?
Why are you carrying a gun?
Anne Brighton. I have to stop this.
I'm sorry. Please don't go anywhere.
It's not safe. I have to...
Freeze! Police!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
- Get down! Get down!
He's gonna kill Polly.
- Down! Down! On the ground, now!
- Gordo! Wait, wait! He's gonna kill Polly.
Anne Brighton! He's gonna kill Polly.
- Get down! Now!
- Anne Brighton, she's next on the list!
Gun. Gun!
You don't understand!
I'm trying to save her life!
She's the one who called us.
Said you were acting all crazy, threatening a child.
- You don't understand!
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
Louis Hicks, you have the right to remain silent.
- Gordo, listen to me!
- Anything you say...
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Listen to me, Gordo!
The boy and the killer are the same!
- You have the right to talk to a lawyer...
- The boy and the killer are the same!
- ... while being present!
- The boy and the killer are the same!
Louis...
Copy that. I'll tell her.
Okay, miss, you can relax.
We have him in custody.
Thank you. That's great.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Call me if you need me.
- All right.
- All right.
You betrayed me, Anne.
Polly. Anne. Whatever your name is.
You don't know it yet, but you're about to betray the boy.
And I can't let you do that.
I'm sorry. You were like a mother to me.
- Time travel?
- Those things he said.
"You'll never write another book. "
"I'm making things right. "
He had a revenge fantasy as a child, and now he's making it happen.
Listen, his next victim, Anne Brighton, is April 22nd, today.
And you think this because an 11-year-old told you he wants to make a time machine.
Check the date on the article.
It's more than 20 years from now.
Come on. My kid can make that on her laptop in five minutes.
There's a cloth from his jacket that hasn't even been invented yet.
- Where is it?
- Listen to me! You're not listening to me!
Listen to me!
Everyone connected to him is dead.
Felicia was the DA on his custody case.
Vicki Ihling was the teacher that returned him to the orphanage.
The boy... The boy is the only thing they both had in common.
They also had you in common.
Your lawyer's here.
Detective, I'd like a private conference with my client.
Sure.
Thank you.
Did you mean it? When you said,
"Cross my heart and hope to die"?
I thought we were friends.
We went to the zoo together.
That wasn't so long ago, was it?
Now I'm all grown up.
And I get to fix the world, my world.
To make it a better place for that boy.
That boy who never meant to hurt anyone, that boy who just wanted a chance.
A chance, a chance, a chance.
Random counter, root applied to...
You're insane.
Time travel is complex.
You have no idea how complex.
I have to choose the exact moment in time to end someone's lifespan so the ripple effect has the specific impact I want it to have.
Do you know the sheer number of calculations necessary?
It would blow your mind.
I thought we were friends.
Why are you doing this to me?
To you?
You don't get it, do you?
You promised that you'd come back for me.
You never did.
I waited and waited for months.
Do you know how long a month is for a little boy waiting for his hero to return?
- I'm sorry, James.
- Don't you fucking call me that.
I ran away from that shit-hole orphanage.
I lived on the streets until I was old enough to lie my way into joining the army.
They've taught me how to kill in so many different ways.
Then they sent me to school.
Turns out I had a real facility for math.
Worked on some classified shit.
You gave me that idea, you know?
You told me,
"You can be anything you choose.
An inventor, even. "
Hey. You wanna see it?
I made it portable.
Nanotechnology.
Are you proud of me?
Time to go.
- Wait.
- Bye-bye.
- Wait!
- Okay.
See, you don't get it.
Every move you make,
I've already planned for.
Oh, no.
I probably should have warned you about that.
The first jump really messes with your insides.
I remember my first jump.
It was a sweaty, filthy evening 11 years ago.
I cut her heart out. Dear Mom.
Rest her soul.
I paid her back in advance for a lifetime of misery.
She was the definition of shitty mom.
Addict, fondler.
Killing her didn't solve anything, and they then sent me to live with Aunt Carol, who made my crack-whore mommy look like a saint.
So, I offed her, too.
But I couldn't stop there.
You see, every time I fixed something, something else needed to be fixed.
Time doesn't like to be messed with.
But that's when I figured it out.
You're the problem.
Each time I revisited this week in my life, you were always there to mess things up, so this time, I made you part of the solution.
The future, in black and white.
You see, you bring the boy here, and he becomes a hero.
See, I never had a chance.
You're his chance, his only chance.
My chance. Now, go get him. He trusts you.
Not sold? Okay.
If you don't bring the boy back here in 15 minutes,
I'm gonna gut her and make her eat her own intestines.
You'd better hurry.
No. No! No, no, no, no, no.
What do you mean you never saw them leave?
What the fuck did they do?
Beam up to the mother ship?
Like I said, when I came in the room, they were gone.
Gone? They Houdini'd out of here, right?
That's what I'm supposed to believe?
That's bullshit! It just doesn't happen!
The social worker, she was on the list, right?
- She's next?
- Yeah.
But he kept talking about the boy, so he might have headed back to the orphanage.
Okay. Okay. I'll take a team there.
You take Maddox and go check on that girl.
- Louis?
- Hey, James.
What are you doing here?
I came back for you.
Yeah?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay, come on.
Okay, buddy, get your shoes on.
Okay, go, go. Go, go, go.
I'm sorry I'm not what you thought the future would look like.
Listen to me. I need you to stay in here.
- Why?
- Just trust me, please.
Where's the boy?
You let her go and I'll tell you.
Promise?
Cross your heart and hope to die?
Yes. Now let her go.
Hey, kid, it's good to see you.
Who is he?
My name is James, too.
Same as you. James Keech.
- Are you my dad?
- No.
I'm you, James, from the future.
You know how you wanted to go back in time and fix things?
Well, you did it.
I'm you, just older.
- We're the same.
- No, you're not, James.
- You'll never be him.
- Don't listen to him. Listen to me.
- To us.
- Are you gonna hurt her?
But she's always been so good to me.
But you don't know the future. I do.
In a few days, she's gonna find your private zoo, and they're gonna lock you away with crazy people.
They will do unspeakable things to you.
They will burn you, and cut you, and worse.
And I am not gonna let them do that to you.
Don't look at him. He's not your friend.
Go ahead, kill me. Nothing changes.
He still becomes me.
But if he kills you, he becomes a hero.
Welcome to the future.
What's happening? What's...
James? James!
James!
I'm so sorry, James.
I'm sorry, James. I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I remember, but I do.
Keech was right. Time travel is complex.
The one thing he could never predict was his own death.
When his younger self died, reality itself was realigned.
I woke up in a new world, a world where the killer never came to be.
Where his victims lived their lives never knowing how close they'd come to their own demise.
In this new world, those terrible few days never happened.
In this world, a troubled boy never became a killer.
He got a second chance.
Then again, so did I.
Daddy! Daddy! You're home!
I missed you, buddy.
I'm taking the teaching job.
Welcome home.
PUNISHED (2011)
Daddy do you know a place called Salar de Uyuni?
It's a salt lake.
It's even more stunning if it rains.
Since it's like a mirror, it can reflect the sea of clouds above.
I so want to go there.
Hello.
Boss, we might have found Daisy.
Chor, what are you digging?
What are you digging?
Daisy.
Daisy!
Daisy, Daisy...
- Boss.
- Daisy!
She's dead.
I didn't kill her! I'm not involved!
When I saw her again she was already like that.
Boss...
Boss...stop!
Stop, Boss!
Is he dead?
Let me handle it.
Shit, that's what I want.
But this batch is hot.
I can reserve some for you. How much do you want?
How much do you have?
Get me 4 bags!
Sure, thank you!
I don't want anything else!
Of course.
I'll call you when they're ready.
Get lost.
Thank you.
I'm not doing so well lately.
I sold my car yesterday to get some cash.
My dad was all over me!
You really should learn from me.
Play the perfect son on important days!
It'll pay off... when the will is read.
Halleujah!
You need to sweet talk the old folks sometimes.
Take off your panties!
What?
You told me to be sweet to the old folks!
It's her birthday.
We'll need a little present for her!
Right, got it. Let me do it myself.
Let me help.
You don't get it,
...move, watch me.
I think you have an infection or something.
How many years have you worn those?
Man, you're nasty.
Let me freshen that up.
Two whole years, what have you done?
Say it, how much longer will it take?
TK.
How about two more weeks?
Say it!
Two...two weeks...
Pull over!
Get out and get going! You don't have much time!
Yes, Boss,
I got it, Boss!
Qing Dao is foggy.
Mr Cheung says his flight is delayed.
He asks if he can meet you tonight instead.
That's his problem.
Don't tell me you want to celebrate your birthday with him!
Chor, call Amy.
Tell her to remind Daisy not to be late for dinner!
Yes, Boss.
Yes, Mr Yao.
Remind Daisy not to be late for dinner tonight.
I got it.
Daisy, I'm just doing my job.
Don't make it hard for me.
Boss asked you not to be late for dinner tonight.
Chun! Not like that!
How many times have I told you?
Leave this and cut it open along the edge.
Understand?
Start over again.
Chun, do it like your dad, then you can scrape all the meat out.
Yes, Auntie.
Try it.
You'll be choosing subjects soon right?
Yes.
Did you get the forms yet?
Yes.
- Let me have a look later on.
- Yes.
Oh miss, you are so early!
I was buying the present and you started without me!
Happy Birthday!
Unwrap it in your bedroom.
It will fit you so well!
Daddy.
Sit down and eat.
Mr Yao, if there is nothing else, I'll go now.
OK.
Yeah! I really like that!
Scrape all the meat out!
Daddy
Do you know a place called Salar de Uyuni?
No.
It's beautiful! I did my research on YouTube.
Since it's like a mirror, it can reflect the sea of clouds above.
I so want to go there.
But it's kind of far...in Bolivia.
I've done the math for the tickets and hotel.
It shouldn't be too expensive.
Talk to me after you've quitted drugs.
I was talking about a trip!
What are you talking about?
I said talk to me when you're clean!
You always have your excuses when you run out of money.
How could you have spent it all in two weeks?
Maybe she's really planning a trip.
It's none of you business!
Call Dr Lam. I'll bring her there at 2pm tomorrow.
I'm taking off tomorrow!
You want me to take your head off tomorrow?
You want a heart attack?
Precisely!
Daisy!
- Leave her.
- Daisy!
Eat.
What has she got for you?
Oh, it's a purse.
She gave me a gift and wished me happy birthday.
That's quite something already.
She wants money. Of course she'd smile.
Perhaps she's really short of cash.
She'd only spend it on drugs. That will kill her.
She has to go to rehab!
Give her some time. She's still a baby.
A baby?
I am your baby!
Happy birthday! Do you like it?
Very much.
Thank you.
I'm going to take a bath. My back hurts.
At 3 am, a fire broke out at a grocery store in Dong Wo Village.
On arrival, the firefighters evacuated the neighborhood and extinguished the fire about 30 minutes later.
The store was seriously damaged but no one was hurt.
The cause of the fire is suspicious.
Near the store, we found two bottles containing flammable liquids and some burnt rags.
We believe this is an arson case...
Should we ask TK...
...to tell his men to lie low?
No need.
As long as he gets the land we want,
I don't care how it's done.
Dr Lam says he'll do a body check for Daisy first.
Remind her not to eat anything.
Where are you going?
I am staying at a friend's place for a few days.
Open the bag!
Give it back to me!
Let go!
Give it back to me!
Let go! Let go!
What are you looking for?
Where does your friend live?
Where, huh?
Bolivia!
- I told you last night!
- Bolivia?
You should have said Mars. It's farther!
You just want money!
Give me my passport!
I need to get to the airport now!
Let go!
Airport my ass!
When you're clean, you can go wherever you like.
What is this? It belongs to you?
Look! That's what she means by a trip!
You're as bad as people think you are!
Yes! That's how I am!
Ask yourself, how do you treat Chun and I?
After Mom died, you treat us like strays.
You done yet?
That bitch gets whatever she wants!
I am your daughter too, asshole!
Go! Go now and don't come back!
Keep an eye on her.
Fuck off, you ass-kissing bitch!
The party starts at 8.
We'll see Mr Ho as soon as we get to Macau!
I am sorry, Boss!
Sorry! I promise it won't happen again!
It's OK. The police are after you, not me.
Whatever you did won't affect the company.
Just make sure we get the land before the deadline.
The chief agrees to meet me the day after tomorrow.
There'll be good news when you return, I promise!
It will be OK.
It's fine. You don't need to go with me,
Give me a call when Daisy is back.
Yes, Boss.
I've been kidnapped.
They want $50 million.
If you call the police, they will kill me.
Yes, Mr Ho.
He's not feeling too well but he's alright.
Sure, we'll schedule for another meeting later.
Thank you. Bye.
Boss, are we going to the police station?
You remember the retired Superintendent Ma?
He worked on a few kidnap cases,
We can ask him to look into the case first.
Go home first.
Boss.
Mrs Wong.
Shouldn't they be going to Macau?
The boss isn't feeling too well, so it's cancelled.
It's getting late. Go home.
OK.
Excuse me, Boss. I am leaving now.
- I'm going.
- OK.
"2 pm tomorrow, get the money ready, wait for my call."
Leave it! Let the brat clean this up when she's back!
Remember the case of Fok Chi-Shing's son?
You think Daisy is staging her own kidnap for your money?
If I call the cops and they find out she's behind it all, people would say I'm the one sending her to jail.
Ask Daniel to prepare the money tomorrow!
We don't even know if the whole thing is a set-up!
Just do what I say!
Real or not, $50 million is a stake
I can still afford!
Seen your son lately?
He always says he's busy with homework.
Which grade is he in?
7th.
Keep an eye on him!
Kids that age are impressionable.
Daisy started to change at this age.
Ever thought about custody?
I wish. His mom doesn't want him to take after me.
She says nothing good can grow from a bad root.
I tried waiting for him at the school entrance once, to see who he's hanging out with.
But he found out!
He scolded me so hard...
He wouldn't see me for two whole months!
Kids nowadays think the world of themselves.
Like Daisy. She takes everything for granted!
Her mum died early.
I thought it's wise to send her to the States.
Who knew she would end up like this.
Cut her some slack. Have a talk with her.
I tried. but she pissed me off every single time!
She knows you care for her.
Does she?
Only you know that I care for her!
I won't let her have her own way when she's back.
I have to be even tougher with her.
Mr Wong, it's ready!
Thank you, Daniel!
You're welcome!
Hello, who's this?
Hello, Mr Wong!
You got my messages, right?
Get my daughter on the phone!
One thing at a time.
Have you prepared what I've asked you to?
Did you not hear what I said?
Get my girl on the phone!
Mr Wong, don't forget who is in charge here.
You are in no place to give orders!
Just answer what I asked.
Is the money ready yet?
Yes!
Drive your XX926.
Be at the parking lot underneath
Ting Kau Bridge at 4. Alone.
If any cars follow you there, I'll know!
I'm telling you, if I don't see my daughter...
The guy knows everything.
Is my daughter behind this?
I don't know,
It could also be a traitor selling her out!
Traitor? That will be a nightmare.
I have thousands of staff. it'd take a year to look everyone up!
Not to mention the hotels and clubs you usually go to.
That's a hundred more.
And there's me...
I have a criminal record!
I am the most suspicious.
If it's really you, then I deserve it for being blind!
Let's go.
Why this car?
Who cares? I am willing to pay, so it should be OK.
Let me go with you.
No, I am going on my own.
I work for you, Boss. Please let me do my job!
Hey, man.
Please move your car a bit. We need to work.
Are you coming or not?
Get onto Shing Mun Tunnels and go to Ma Liu Shui Pier!
What game are you playing?
Wong Ho Chiu, mind your manners!
You want to give orders? Fine!
If something happens to my girl,
I can do anything!
Think twice before you start messing with me!
You only have half an hour.
Retract the roof.
Who the hell is this?
Retract the roof.
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
I've installed four cameras, but only the left one captured it.
But the news last night said the bike was burnt on a hillside.
It was stolen.
There are two men!
The one who told me to retract the roof and the one who talked to me on the phone.
The voices are different.
They are two different men!
Boss, I suggest that we call the police.
You still think Daisy kidnapped herself?
I don't know, all I know now is that
I have been made a complete fool.
Chor, check it out for me.
Even if she kidnapped herself, and is having a great time right now with that 50 million,
I still need to know where the hell she is!
You know that I'm not used to troubling others unless its absolutely necessary.
Have you been seeing your buddies?
No.
Ever thought of coming back to help me out?
No thanks, I don't want to get into that again.
Something bothering you?
Lost a few things.
A Car?
A watch, necklace, perhaps even diamond earrings.
Monday, 9 a.m.
Did anyone pick up a 20 years old girl with long hair, wearing a white leather's jacket, at Pak Sha Keng in Stanley?
She says she left her homework in the cab.
Anyone who had seen that please report to the office.
Your sister was crying the whole way that day,
...but I couldn't recall seeing any homework.
Then maybe she forgot where she left it.
Tell her to try looking somewhere else!
Thanks!
She got out here, then headed that way.
Thanks a lot!
After the arson case two days ago,
Dong Wo Village is in unrest once again.
A conflict broke out during the negotiation between the villagers and the developers.
The representative was besieged by a large group of villagers who were trying to stop him from leaving.
So what now?
I'm on it! Don't worry, no problem!
If you can't finish that off, just finish yourself off.
Yes Boss!
Boss!
Meeting dismissed!
I asked a friend who works at a web company to check some things.
Neither Daisy's email nor msn has been logged in since the day she was kidnapped, and no record for calls or sms on her cell phone either!
This is the cab driver who gave Daisy a ride,
Lee Wai-Man, owner of the car, working as substitute that day.
No criminal record, owns over 1 0 taxi licenses.
Estimated assets over 50 million.
This is Fok Chi-Shing's son, Kwok Wing-Chiu's son,
Tang Po-Kin's daughter.
Daisy's wasted company, all retards!
This is Mark, broker.
Hangs out at B&B all day long, was Daisy's dealer.
Daisy placed an order at him before but she never picked it up!
Chances of Daisy kidnapping herself are really slim.
This way. Ho Chiu, Master Shaw is here!
Master Shaw!
Mr Wong!
What now?
I told you we have an appointment with Master Shaw at 4.
I am so sorry Master Shaw,
I'm a bit caught up right now, can we meet another day?
Chor, show Master Shaw out!
I am so sorry! Master Shaw!
Master Shaw, this way.
Don't you have to go to Qing Dao to sign a contract today?
What are you doing here?
You said things have been rough lately so you want Master Shaw to have a look!
I never said that!
Fine, doesn't matter.
But Master Shaw will be leaving for Si Chuan shortly and won't be back until next week.
So I figured I would ask him to come over and have a look before he goes!
I have never said that things have been rough!
I never asked you to get help!
Why are you still here?
To the airport, there are people waiting!
Can't even manage such a petty task!
I am your wife, not your maid!
The guy wasn't a familiar face.
Not a regular crook.
He said don't sell it, he'll be back for it tonight.
Fatso, where's the Boss?
Boss.
- Thanks Boss.
- Alright.
How did you get this?
I found it on the floor!
How did you get it?
I really just picked it up off the floor!
Ah! The chick dropped it!
Fuck off, you ass- kissing bitch!
What are you doing? Move it! Wanna get caught?
I was only responsible for seizing her,
I don't know anything!
Who got you into this?
A gang fella, called Bear, he told me to do it!
How do you get in touch with him?
He comes to me every time,
I don't know how to reach him!
How about the other guy?
I don't know that guy!
Where is the girl now?
- Wing, thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Cup noodles again, here're some take-away.
I didn't eat dinner either!
Full already? Eat more!
The noodles are no good.
It's not like mum's cooking.
Things are different now!
Trying to preach again!
You mother wouldn't want the two of you... to be like this even though she is not around.
It wouldn't be this way if he hadn't married that woman!
He can't lose face.
You talking back to him like that will do you two no good.
Oh so he's the only one who can't lose face! How about me?
Being such a dictator all the time, does he know what respect is?
You're talking just like your dad now.
He's all over me all the time!
He cares about your well-being.
Why can't you two try to talk a bit?
About what?
I can't see you talking with your son!
I'm trying!
Ha ha! Your son is lucky, to have such a sensible dad!
Your dad is very sensible too, just give him some time.
Damn, you nag more than he does!
All dads nag!
I'm damn glad that I'm not your daughter!
Chor, have you ever hit your son?
I don't even have the chance!
Don't try it even if you have chance.
I will tell my wife and the others that I've sent Daisy back to the States.
I don't want anyone else to know about this.
"Recipient 'Yao Kai-Chor', amount FIFTY MILLION HONG KONG DOLLAR."
Invest in a stable fund.
Should be enough for your retirement and your son's college tuition.
Boss, I can't take that.
I promised Daisy's mum that
I would take good care of her, but I failed!
I am responsible!
Whoever contributed to her death is responsible!
Those scums are having fun while Daisy died for nothing.
Sure you want to do this?
You are the only person I trust now, please help me!
I am begging you!
Mrs Wong.
Chor, you're leaving too?
I am responsible for what happened to Daisy.
I can't stay here anymore.
Be honest with me.
What happened while I was in Qing Dao?
Was Daisy really kidnapped?
Then why didn't he call the police?
The boss said, as long as she was unharmed, he'd forget about it.
Also, Daisy was very upset.
So he sent her straight back to L.A.
Have you seen Daisy then?
I saw her off myself.
Mrs Wong.
- I'm leaving now, Mrs Wong.
- Bye!
I'll give you a lift.
Oh great, thanks!
I am so sorry.
What for?
I couldn't even keep an eye on Daisy, and got you fired.
It wasn't your fault, I quit the job myself.
By the way, Daisy had been missing for so long.
How did boss eventually find her?
The boss said that she'll come back when she's broke.
Hopefully she'll grow up when she's back in L.A.
No one wants to see her getting into trouble again.
Well, it's out of our hands now.
How are the fish at home?
Any new fish?
Keung?
I told you to call me Jason!
Ok, sorry Jason.
How are the fish doing?
All dead except one.
What? That's pretty sad!
Is there a problem with the water?
They just die when they are old!
Then let's get some new ones later on.
No, I don't like fish!
How about dogs?
Dogs in public housing? We'd get kicked out.
Then how about getting our own flat?
You've got the money?
Well yea.
Still, no thanks.
Why not?
They have a safer neighborhoods and better environments!
What if something happens and you can't pay the rent?
Don't worry about it! Trust me!
Mum would say no even if I say yes, since Ken is living in the next block!
Who's Ken?
Mum's boyfriend!
What does he do? Is he a gangster?
He's a social worker!
He's in charge of our case!
What case is that?
Father in prison, single parent on welfare, that's more than enough to make a case.
Damn!
The factory closed down recently, no one would be here.
You can stay here for a while.
Thanks a lot!
The number you have dialled is not registered, please check and call again later.
"Bear tel: 5018 9056"
Yau Gwat Hei Hotpot...
Gee! What happened? Why are you crying?
What did you do?
I didn't do anything!
Don't cry babe, don't cry, mommy's here, give me a smile! give me a smile!
Hello, this is B&B!
Sir, sorry, we aren't open yet!
Shun!
Brother Chor!
Can you ask your friends if they've ever seen this guy?
Going to sleep?
About to.
What are you doing?
Packing up.
I've chosen the science stream for you.
Dr. Lam is retiring in 1 0 years.
I'll be needing a doctor I can trust.
Work hard, you can do it!
- Going back to the dorm tomorrow morning?
- Yes.
Still have 8 hours if you go to bed now.
Hey Brother Pang!
At the pier.
Waiting for a boat to Thailand.
Don't get me wrong Brother Pang...
You didn't return my calls, what am I supposed to do?
He came to the bar.
I recognize him, must be the body guard of that Wong Ho Chiu.
Lost him. I know.
Hey, the boat's here, got to go, call you when I get there!
Hey, I have been waiting for half an hour, are you gonna do your job or what?
Where is the remaining one?
Wanna go meet your fella?
Talk!
Everything...
Pang's the one behind it!
Move it! Wanna get caught?
Don't be afraid, we would let you go once we get the money!
Tie her up!
They want 50 million.
If you call the police...
...is the bitch behind this?
You think you can scare me with this stupid shit?
Hey, how can she talk if you hit her like this?
If she says the right, I won't hit her.
Again.
Retract the roof!
Who the hell is this?
Retract the roof now!
How about the chick?
You taken care of the bike?
Burnt already.
And the chick?
He killed the chick.
I really have nothing to do with it...
How do I find this guy?
Where does your friend live?
Bolivia!
- I told you last night!
- Bolivia?
You should have said Mars, it's further away!
You just want money!
"Soul Purifying Journey,
Mirror of the Sky - Bolivia"
"May all lifes bring the end to the circle of transmigration."
"And find their destiny in nirvana."
"Ahimsa."
What's the matter?
Nothing. Steven invited me to play golf with him.
Turn him down for me.
Chun.
What's the matter?
The Royal Academy of Music has taken me in.
I'm enrolling next month!
Sorry, Daddy, I am really not interested in Medicine at all!
No.
All I ever wanted is to study music.
I worked so hard to be admitted.
Did you ask for my permission before you applied?
I am sorry, but I wish you'd let me choose!
Bye daddy!
Bye auntie!
Give him a break.
In general, this is the content.
Is there anything that you're not clear?
I can keep the content of the will from its legatee, right?
Sure!
But at least make sure that, they know our number and address,
...in case something happens, they would know how to find us.
How many years do they have to wait if I go missing?
7 years! After that they can apply for a death certificate,
...and officially claim the inheritance.
If you call the police, they'd kill me.
Are you alright?
Are you holding?
Are you holding?
Give me some...
What the hell's wrong with her?
She wants some of this!
Hey, girl, c'mon, try this!
Fuck! Fuck you!
Go to hell!
Daddy, help!
Let me go!
Son of a Bitch!
Mr Wong, Mr Chiu wants to see you!
Ask him to come in.
Sorry Boss, I've tried everything.
Those folks are afraid of nothing, and they don't want money, they refuse to talk,
...I'm now asking the elders for help.
Give me 3 more days...3 days...I'll fix it...
What are you talking about?
Dong Wo Village, the land.
It's alright, just leave it.
Boss, please give me one more chance.
The project is called off, just leave it,
...pack and go!
You will have you retirement pension!
Boss, it's not about the pension.
It's about keeping my promise.
I would get it done.
One last time, 2 days, I'll get it done for you!
You once told me, that no matter how much stress there is never turn to sleeping pills, one'll rely on it.
Sleepy, but can't sleep.
Daniel told me that you withdrew another 50 million.
Something wrong?
What's the matter? Why'd you want to know?
Well, nothing, just trying to be the nosy wife.
I've lent it to others, stop worrying, go to bed!
Ho Chiu!
- What?
- Something happened to TK!
"Ho Chiu Group Staff killed in Dong Wo Village."
I've told you to leave it, why you're still on it?
How are you doing?
Get me some water, my stomach hurts.
According to the victim's wife, you are the one who really killed her husband, not the villagers.
You're hurting me!
What do you wish to say about this?
The victim has been fired, how come he's still going to meet the villagers?
You're hurting me!
Do you feel responsible for Mr Wong's death?
Police states that the case is still in...
Since you answered Bear's phone,
I guess I'm the only one left!
Yes you are!
Too scared to show up?
Of course not!
No need to look for me, just stay where you are!
- Boss
- I'm fine.
I'm fine, don't ask me to see doctor like everybody does!
Just tell me when it's done!
Mrs Wong, we've been following Mr Wong, he's at Bun-Chun Yuen.
You look tired.
Can't sleep, damn serious.
Medicine can't help, I always see the sunrise.
You should take a break.
It's not about that,
...one more, still one to go.
Inform me when you've found those bastards.
I need to see them die...one by one... in front of me, then I'll be alright.
Why did you lie to me?
Mrs Wong.
I am your wife.
I'm asking you, why did you lie to me?
I said, if anything happens to Daisy, they'll all have to pay.
You're the one who's not okay now!
I'm fine! I know what I'm doing!
Then are you asking me to act as if nothing happened?
What should I tell the boy?
Nothing! I don't know, I don't care.
No one can stop me. Get out of my way!
Even if you take revenge, so what?
You're not punishing them, you're punishing yourself!
Why so secretive?
I'll go after Wong Ho Chiu when I'm done with you!
Well, then let's stop wasting time.
Wong Ho Chiu is lucky to have you working for him.
Why do you have to kill her?
What game are you trying to play?
Wong Ho Chiu, mind your manners.
Makes things easier for everybody!
You want to give orders? Fine!
If anything happens to my girl,
I'll do whatever I have to!
Think twice before you start messing with me!
You have half an hour.
It's taken care of, on my way back!
Okay!
I've just got the money,
...but then your old man was threatening me.
I don't want any more trouble.
It was up to your boss whether she lived or died!
Boss, found him.
Wong Ho Chiu, what's up?
Need me to bring a message to your girl?
I told you, if anything happens to my girl,
I'll do whatever I have to!
But I am still in charge now!
When I get to hell, I'll screw your daughter!
You'll die like she did!
Go to hell, you bastard!
I am going back to my mum's place.
The medicines you're taking,
I've put them in the nightstand.
Remember to fast next Friday.
If there's any problem at the company, call me.
In your case, I suggest that you go to Cheng for help!
I'm okay!
Chiu, actually nowadays it's really common to have psychological issues,
...especially people in your position.
It's more common than you think!
I said I am okay!
Just give me the sleeping pills you gave me last time!
OK!
By the way, Daisy came to me for medicine in a hurry the other night, is she okay?
Which night?
It was...Two days after your wife's birthday, her assistant came to me at around 9!
You...you're sure?
Absolutely,
I was in a hurry that night, to pick up my girl at the airport!
Why did you still go to pick up the medicine after Daisy was kidnapped? Huh?
- Besides you, who else is involved?
- I don't know,
- Who else?
- I really don't know, I have nothing to do with it
- Talk!
- I don't know...
Everyone involved is dead, you want to join them?
I don't know, please!
No!
Please!
Don't kill my girl, she's innocent.
It's me who did it,
I am so sorry.
Boss, I am leaving!
- OK
- OK
This chick's having a heart attack, bring the medicine!
The medicine!
Girl, we haven't got the money yet, don't die!
Her old man didn't call the police right?
Go back and keep an eye on them!
By the way, Daisy had been missing for so long,
...how did boss eventually find her?
He said she would come back when she's broke.
Hopefully she'll grow up when she's back in L.A.
No one wants to see her getting into trouble again...
How is Wong Ho Chiu? Did he call the police?
I guess not.
He'd sent Daisy back to L.A.
Have you ever seen the chick?
The guy is really one hell of a liar!
Didn't you say you'll let her go?
Just mind your share, other than that, it's none of your business!
Don't tell me you killed her!
- You said...
- I don't need you to tell me what to do!
You're dead meat if you talk!
They only asked me about Daisy's whereabouts.
I didn't know it'd end up this way!
I...I am so sorry!
Who else is involved?
When will it end?
Winnie, run, run!
Leave her.
Gee! What happened? Why are you crying?
What did you do?
Don't come close, Winnie!
Winnie...
Mommy...
Mommy's here!
It's alright now, mommy's here!
Do you think that,
I'm just trying to make myself feel better letting Amy go?
Is there a difference?
For her, no, for me, yes.
It's over now, don't dwell on it.
I'll take care of whatever happens in the future.
Can you?
There're things that would haunt you for life.
I don't want to bother anyone anymore.
From now on, we'd better not meet again.
Thank you.
Take care boss.
Jason!
Oh you finally remember how to call me properly!
What's up?
The company is sending me to Russia,
I won't be back for a few years.
Oh, good luck then! Call me when you're back!
I've left some money with your mother.
It'll cover your college tuition in the future, don't worry.
What are you worrying about?
I'm only in 7th grade!
Anyway, remember to work hard, okay?
Right, don't you have anything new to say?
Got to hang up now, got another call, bye!
Okay, bye!
"My beloved daughter, Daisy Wong"
Here's what I wonder about zombies.
What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat?
They can't starve to death-- they're already dead.
You take this one.
I spent an hour last night on
"How do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror"?
Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other-- case closed.
Yeah, okay, so, zombies.
I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj.
Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies?
Like, in 28 Days,
if those zombies didn't eat, they starved.
You're thinking of 28 Days Later.
28 Days is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock!
You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.
Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.
Why's the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects.
Of course, if he'd have read any of the 1,300 e-mails
I've sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.
Or maybe he heard it's
Tator Tot Tuesday.
That's why I'm here.
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses!
How are we doing today?
That depends-- how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.
It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia.
If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,
I'll let you check me for a hernia.
Yeah.
So, listen, fellas, who's up for a little party this Saturday night?
Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.
Sounds great!
I'm in!
Hold on.
Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van.
What's the occasion?
Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.
I don't care; it's demeaning.
And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair.
Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform.
All right, let me put it this way.
You're gonna put on a suit, you're gonna come to this party, and you're gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God,
I'll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did  to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.
Oh, you don't want that.
So, Saturday night!
It's gonna be off the hook.
Ugh!
Get over it.
Oh, boy!
Tator tots and a party invitation?
What a great day!

There you go.
Are you sure this is right?
Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you'll be fine.
Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tochis.
Oh, Howard, I can't believe
Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes.
My mother does.
Oh. We should get going.
What about Sheldon?
Sheldon is not going.
Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.
Don't tell him that, tell him the mask thing.
Hey, put your tie back in your pants.
Nice place.
Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.
- You're kidding.
- No. We are very wealthy.
But the only difference is, we have more servants.
- More than this?
- More than we can use.
You see, in India, we don't make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
Ah. There's my band of brainiacs.
Where's Dr. Cooper?
He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind.
I think he's just bananas.
Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university's leading donors.
I think we were misled about the cute girls.
Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers.
This is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn't stick with it long enough to get your PhD?
I'm an engineer.
Most engineers don't bother with a PhD.
But you may be interested to know
I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
Got it-- you're a space plumber.
I'm gonna go hit the bar.
Tell me about these two.
- Do him first.
- Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight.
I think you'll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.
Right.
Fascinate me.
They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they?
I'll make it easy for you.
When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
Coffee maker?
All right, Dr. Kooth-- uh, whatever it is-- you're up.
It's Koothrappal
I have to tinkle.
And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree,
I stayed right here and did a load of whites.
Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward "The Man," but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.
Unlikely.
But make your case.
Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our
Saturday night together, and I'm not above minimizing your window.
Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed
Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
That's it.
Prepare to be minimized.
I'm not finished.
All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon.
How do you think
I paid for my lab?
I went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.
Your lab is funded by some
Middle-Eastern dilettante?
Technically,
Faisal is my fiancé.
But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
And consider this: without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.
Are you trying to scare me?
'Cause you're succeeding.
Well, then prepare to be terrified.
If your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.
Oh, dear, the dirt people!
Or worse-- it could go to... the liberal arts.
No!
Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.
Oh, the humanities!
On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah.
The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.
Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.
Look at the size of these shrimp!
At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.
Oh, you didn't do that badly.
Mrs. Latham, the first machine
I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser,
'cause it needs to warm up.
I no longer care, dear.
But don't worry,
I really enjoyed meeting you this evening. u're kidding.
That was good for you?
'Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
Excellent! There's nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.
Why?
Oh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money.
Watch.
Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp?
See? Fun.
No, no, no, I'm just here for your money.
I don't want to shake anyone's germy hands.
Explain it to them, Siebert.
I must confess
I don't understand you,
President Siebert.
First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers.
Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message.
Here we go again.
If there's simply no talking to me, why did you call?
I'm sorry, someone's on the other line.
Why don't you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we'll try again later.
Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.
Well, yes, of course
I remember you.
A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains.
So, how much money are you going to give me?
I'm not crazy-- my mother had me tested.
Well, if you're not going to give me money, then why are you calling?
She wants to talk to you.
Who's crazy now?
Hello, Mrs. Latham.
Yes, I live with him.
I don't...
I-I really don't know why.
Tonight? Sure, that'd be great.
Okay, I'll see you then.
Bye.
She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
An entire dinner to talk about your research?
Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
Well, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.
Okay,
- I see what's happening.
- What?
My stature intimidates her, so she's using you to get to me.
Crafty old gal.
Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment.
I've been published in peer-reviewed journals,
I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
No, that can't be it.
And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we're best friends.
And I got your back, Jack.
That was a great meal.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town
- and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?
You kind of remind me of her.
She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.
Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.
- No kidding.
- Sweet boy.
Very smart.
If only he'd had money.
Yeah, um... so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.
Oh, good, good.
And I'm seriously considering taking it to the next level.
Terrific. Great.
What level is that?
Okay, now you don't remind me of my mom.
I'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
You know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
Hey. How was dinner?
Swell. I need a drink.
Do we have any alcohol?
No. But we have potatoes--
I could make you vodka.
It'll take two weeks.
Leonard, are you okay?
Um, I'm not sure.
What's going on?
Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump...
Yes!
Oh, wow!
...then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
Why?
Okay, we can't keep explaining everything.
Read that book we got you.
She hit on me.
Wait-wait-wait.
Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
I think so.
You lucky duck.
You're really a broken toy, aren't you?
I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
Excellent!
What are you planning to wear?
What?
Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favors for material gain-- walk him through this.
Well, n-no, hold on a second,
I'm not going to sleep with her.
But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
Well, forget it!
It's not gonna happen.
Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!
I repeat: Not gonna happen.
What was all that about me trading sexual favors for material gain?
It was a compliment.
I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
Okay, fine. I'll tell him.
Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car is here for you.
I won't be too late;
I'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
Hold on,
I have something for you.
What's this?
Just a few things you may need tonight.
Baby oil, condoms and, uh... a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology.
They say it is to Viagra as
Viagra is to a green M&M.
I am not going to have sex with her.
Maybe this will overcome your reluctance.
I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming.
Check out those saddle shoes.
Are you insane?
I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
Oh, come on! Why not?
Good night,
Sheldon.
Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!
He still won't shag the old lady, huh?
No. But thank you for asking.
Hey. Hi.
Hello, Leonard.
I hope you're hungry.
I'm very hungry.
For food, right?
Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night.
I'm so sorry.
No, that's okay.
No, it most certainly is not.
Leonard, I'm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.
- Really?
- Well, of course.
There's no quid pro quo here.
You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.
Oh.
Then what was last night about?
I took a shot; sue me.
Oh.
You're a very handsome man, Leonard.
Thank you.
It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
Oh, don't say that.
- You're a very attractive woman.
- Oh, please.
- No, it's true.
- Well, aren't you sweet.
Just for the record... you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.
I'm sure I would.
But why-why, exactly?
You're a very smart man.
How do you think I landed such a rich husband?
I hadn't really given it much thought.
Well, think about it.
Do you mean...?
Yep. I'm that good.
Oh, what the hell.
Good morning, slut.
What?
Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it.
All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing's going on.
Excuse me.
- Are you just getting home?
- Yeah.
That's a good sign, right?
Oh, yeah.
I'm so proud of you!
You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
No, I didn't do it for the money.
She stiffed you?
I believe that's what your roommate did to her.
What?!
Again, read the book we gave you.
No, I mean,
I-I got the money first.
Smart. Get paid up front.
Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.
Uh...
I'm gonna go lie down.
That's a good idea; get your rest.
There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator.
And I thought he didn't learn anything from his relationship with you.
Hey!
Another compliment!
Learn to recognize them.
Ah, there he is!
The man of the hour!
He took one for the team!
I didn't do it for the money!
Keep telling yourself that-- it makes it easier.
Trust me, I know.
Cool, buddy!
That's awesome!
Yeah!
How was she?

"Do you ever have emotions that you can't explain?
"Have you ever lost control of these emotions?
"Do these emotions have a name?"
These were the first three questions that Dr Malicent asked of Joseph Kinkirk just six hours after his arrest, to which Kinkirk answered,
"Yes, yes, and Henry."
This course of exchange laid the foundation for a defence that failed not only because of the meticulously collected physical evidence, um, but also because of the currently accepted opinion in modern psychology - multiple personality syndrome does not exist.
It was a psychological fad, a therapist-induced disorder perpetuated by an unending barrage of TV talk shows and novels and ill-conceived Hollywood movies.
Joseph Kinkirk has been under observation at various psychiatric institutions for most of his adult life and yet there has not been one documented reference to Henry until after his arrest.
Henry did not abduct Sarah McKenzie.
He didn't strip her naked or tie her to a bed in the cellar.
He didn't rape her 12-year-old body or attempt to remove her ovaries with a box cutter.
And he didn't videotape the two hours it took Sarah to bleed to death when that operation failed.
Henry did not commit these atrocities because...
...Henry does not exist.
Joseph Kinkirk is fully aware of his actions...
...just as he was when he committed them.
It's after midnight, I'm afraid.
I know.
I need two shots of tequila, a waterback and some volume on the TV.
Please.
Certainly.
At one minute past midnight.
The State of Missouri began the execution
of Joseph Kinkirk by lethal injection.
With no reprieve coming
from the Governor's office...
Oh, God.
Can I have two... two more shots, please?
Would you like me to change the channel?
No, that's fine.
...and Mr Kinkirk was pronounced dead
at 18 minutes past the hour.
As you've just heard.
Joseph Kinkirk has been put to death
in a Missouri state prison.
We will have further reaction
to this execution...
- Hello.
- Hi, Mommy!
Hi, sweetie.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
What's that noise?
Uncle Stephen's making breakfast.
OK, now can we go to Starbucks?
How was last night?
We watched 'Night of the Living Dead'.
Oh, no - secrets! Shh.
Put your uncle on the phone.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
So did you see them fry the bad guy last night?
It was lethal injection. And no.
You get shit-faced as usual?
Watch your language in front of Sammy.
Sorry. Did you, as usual, get shit-faced?
I'm running late.
I'll see you this afternoon, OK?
Hello?
Hey. Hey! That's rude.
Your mother hung up on me.
Dad, can I call you back?
I'm just at the airport...
I need your opinion on a patient!
You 're shouting again.
Am I?
Sorry!
Look, I think you 'll find this one to be very interesting.
Just send me the file and I'll look it over.
No, no, you have to meet him.
I'll pick you up at the airport.
Just give him one hour.
You can't expect me to rearrange my life every time you dig up some medical oddity.
Did you hang up?
Dad?
Hi.
So where'd you find this David Bernburg?
He was referred to me by Dr Foster.
Charlie?
Mm-hm.
Well, that figures.
David was picked up for vagrancy and then released into Charlie's care the next day.
Well, how long has he been a patient here?
Couple of days. Since the weekend.
That's all?
Mm-hm.
You usually like to treat them for a month before you let me pick them apart.
Ah, but this one has a whole new kind of act.
Oh, yeah?
Enjoy.
Can we get a little heat going in here?
Sure.
Hi.
Hi.
Thank you.
Sure.
I'm Dr Cara Jessup.
And you must be David.
David Bernburg. Is that right?
Yes.
'Bernburg' - is that German?
I don't know.
Do you know why we're here?
You want to ask me some questions.
Is that alright with you?
Yes.
OK. Have you been in a wheelchair your entire life?
No.
I had an accident a few years back.
OK.
Are you left- or right-handed?
Right.
And, um, in your childhood home, how many windows are there?
11 if you count the star window in the door.
But it didn't open.
OK, so when you 're counting these windows, are you inside or outside the house?
Inside. It's warmer.
Mm-hm.
Were you raised in any religion?
Ma'am, I was raised in the mountains.
God held our hand and the devil waited for us to fall.
I'd like to show you a series of abstract images and I'd like you to just describe any thought that comes to mind, OK?
Two small children.
Mm-hm.
And they're playing that game, um...
Patty cake, patty cake...
OK, OK. Good.
And this one?
It looks like an elephant in the circus.
Is it a big elephant?
No, a baby elephant.
Do you see any numbers in the circle?
OK.
How about this one?
Sure.
Do you ever have any emotions you can't explain?
No.
Do you ever feel angry or violent or depressed for no apparent reason?
No.
OK. Thank you very much.
Alright, Dad, I'm waiting.
For what?
Well, you didn't bring me here to meet David, did you?
Mind if I make a call?
No, I got nothing but time.
Go right ahead.
Hello.
This is Dr Harding. Is Adam there?
I'm sorry, Dr Harding.
I'm the only one here.
I'd like you to look for him.
What was that?
This is Adam.
Adam, it's Dr Harding.
I wonder if you would have a moment to speak with a colleague of mine?
Sure.
You didn't need to do that.
Do what?
Show off. It makes you look like a charlatan.
Hello.
I'm Dr Jessup.
Jessup? You 're Dr Harding's daughter?
Yes, I am. And you 're Adam.
Your husband was murdered, right?
Ooh.
Yes.
How?
His throat was slit by a mugger.
When?
Three years ago.
Where?
When we were walking home from church on Christmas Eve.
You think that was rude of me?
Not at all.
I'm used to it.
Aggressive role manipulation is a common avoidance technique used by borderline personalities during therapy.
But you knew that, didn't you?
Attagirl.
I have to watch out for your exploitative pathological tendencies.
Ready to answer some questions?
Shoot.
In your childhood home, how many windows are there?
One.
One?
Mm-hm.
Actually, two if you count the windshield.
I see.
Were you raised in any religion?
Catholic.
Mm-hm.
OK, Adam, I have a series of abstract images here.
I'd like you to take a look at them...
Dancers, moth, elephants, the Devil.
I've seen all this stuff before, Doctor.
Yes, you have. Clearly.
OK, Adam.
Do you see any numbers in the circles?
Nope.
And this one?
No.
Great. Great.
What about this one?
The number seven.
OK.
OK, Adam, um... may I look at your eyes?
Are you wearing contact lenses?
No. This is their natural colour.
Are you colourblind?
Red deficient, since birth.
OK, Adam, I think we're done here.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Can I go now?
You set me up.
No, no. I offered you a chance to reconsider some of your assumptions.
Adam is the host. David is the alter.
Why didn't you let me interview Adam first?
Where's the fun in that?
Hello!
Mommy!
Hello!
Hello!
I missed you so much!
Yay!
Hey, Pop.
Hey, Stevo. This is quite a rig.
Mm-hm.
Hah.
Hey, Grandpa.
There's my angel. How you doing?
Go get your stuff, OK?
OK.
I'll help you.
She have fun?
Uh, she was pretty cranky till that second beer set in.
You staying for dinner?
No.
Sammy's got school in the morning.
Mm-hm.
You OK? I mean, really OK?
Yeah, I'll be OK.
What are you working on?
Oh, I'm just offlining an industrial.
Oh, great.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
No.
No.
OK, here we are.
Did you say thank you to Uncle Stephen, honey?
Thank you, Uncle Stephen.
Sammy, next time you bring the beers, OK?
OK.
I gotta tell you, I'm loving these underage drinking jokes.
Thank you.
Just loving them.
Thank you very much.
Mm-hm. 'Bye!
Goodbye. Get off my property.
- 'Bye.
Don't pull all the way up into the driveway.
Why?
It'll be too tight for me to get out.
You 'll be able to get out.
No, it's...
Yep.
Thanks, Pop. This is perfect.
Hey, honey, get in the bathtub, OK?
And then we'll have dinner.
OK, Mom!
What's that?
Adam's file. Take a look.
I'll think about it.
I don't seem to have much time for God nowadays, Doctor.
It seems to work both ways.
Hows about you? Got your faith?
My daughter lost her husband not too long ago.
He was a good, good man and he was murdered for no reason at all.
Murdered?
Mm-hm.
So I find it kind of hard to believe in a God that could hurt my daughter...
...is Adam there?
I'm sorry,
Dr Harding. I'm the only one here.
Little CC.
Hey, Charlie. You look terrible.
Well, thank you.
A course of antibiotics, I'll be fine.
Alright.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Um, Adam Saber.
I want to know how he came to you and why you dumped him on my father.
The police found him laying in the street.
He didn't appear intoxicated.
Claimed he wasn't able to walk.
Gave his name as David Bernburg.
By the time I examined him, he was up on his feet, calling himself Adam Saber, said he had no idea how he got to the hospital.
Well, I thought of your father immediately.
Well, yeah, sure.
Um, have you ever had a patient who was colourblind in just one eye?
No. Why?
I was just thinking it might explain...
Never mind.
How's Sammy?
She's great.
Soccer-crazy.
There are tryouts at the school this Friday. You should come.
I'd like that.
Good.
Um, can I get a copy of his hospital file?
I'll fax it this afternoon.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself, alright?
Yeah.
I will. You take care of that kid.
Yeah. Always.
Um, does Ellie still work in radiology?
Yeah, but she's up on the third floor now.
Alright. Thanks again.
'Bye.
Is it possible that when he wrenches his neck, he's compressing, decompressing a nerve and causing some kind of temporary paralysis?
Look.
This X-ray - the third, the fourth, the fifth vertebrae...
Fused.
Mmm.
So we're looking at X-rays here of two different people.
Two different people.
It's a hoax - a guy, the doctor.
The doctor?
Sure.
How well do you know him?
Well, some days, not at all.
Gets under your skin, doesn't he?
These aren't his films. They can't be.
Isn't it possible that what you 're looking at is actually what you 're seeing?
No, because this is not possible.
Adam is the real deal.
No.
He is a desperately ill young man, but he's fully aware of David and all of David's actions.
David is pure invention and I'll prove it to you.
You know what? We haven't had dinner together in over a month.
Well, you 're coming to Easter, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Do you want me to bring anything?
Just your delightful self.
That's my girl.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
OK, what name?
So, David Bernburg,
Shadywood High School, Shadywood.
Shadywood.
Sorry, Doctor. Scared you a little right there, huh?
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
Listen, uh, I didn't want you to leave without having a chance to say thank you.
For what?
For trying to help.
Thanks.
You 're welcome.
Excuse me. I'm looking for yearbooks.
Second aisle down to the back.
But you best be quick.
I'm locking up in 10 minutes.
No, I'll be quick. I promise.
OK.
Are you almost done?
Um, I'll be done in a minute.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Bless the bed that I lay on
Bless me as they lay me down to sleep
I give myself to God to keep
Five little angels round my bed
One to the foot and one to the head
One to sing and one to pray
And one to take my sins away.
Amen.
She doesn't mean it.
Right?
Hello.
Charlie?
Oh, little CC.
You sound terrible.
Listen, listen. Can I bring you anything?
Uh, no. I've got soup.
And, um, that antibiotic's about to kick in.
I hate to ask, but you never faxed me Adam Saber's file.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is first thing alright?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Just get some rest, OK?
I will.
See you soon.
OK. Feel better.
Excuse me.
Do you know the way to the Quarry House?
I don't know how I got to the hospital.
I have no idea how I got to bed last night.
You know, I just wake up in my room and I don't remember nothing.
The nurses helped you into your bed.
Was I awake?
In a matter of speaking.
Hello?
They're ruined, aren't they?
I... I'm sorry. I knocked at the front door.
I was...
I found them this morning.
They must have been in water for weeks.
All that music, all that life, all gone.
I think... I think some of it can be saved, actually.
Well, there's always hope.
Now, who are you?
I'm looking for David Bernburg.
David?
Yeah.
You 're standing on him, aren't you?
Well, it happens around this time of year - some local reporter inevitably stumbles onto a story in the archives and tries to resurrect it as a cautionary tale.
Are you talking about David's accident?
No, my dear.
His murder.
How did his accident happen?
He fell.
Wet leaves on stone steps.
And just like that his life had to begin again.
But he accepted his fate with such nobility.
For three years,
David showed the world how brightly the Holy Spirit shone within him.
But then... David lost his way.
He found a doctor in the city who was experimenting with spinal replacement or some such nonsense.
David came to believe that this practitioner would one day give him back his legs.
It seemed as if every month, he'd ride into the city on the bus with hope in his eyes...
...only to be injected and sliced open and return broken-hearted.
And then one month he left home and never returned.
It was one week later when they found his remains.
He'd... been taken into the woods and abused.
Tortured.
Can you imagine?
David sitting there, watching, unable to fight back, watching as they did those unspeakable things to him?
I... I cannot. I...
And I pray you never will.
David turned his back on God and looked to science for his answers.
The Lord told us quite plainly.
"Wane not, thy faith in me."
Hey, Art. I'll have a cup of coffee and some of that apple pie, huh?
Hi, honey bun.
Did you have a good time, hmm?
No. We had a bird funeral.
Great. Great.
Mmm, yeah.
Well, do you want to pick out a treat while I talk to Grandpa?
OK, go ahead.
What's the fundamental difference between a disassociated personality and a delusional one?
No hello?
'Cause I have something.
Yeah?
OK, so the real David Bernburg was born on February 5, 1963.
He slipped and broke his back in November of 1979.
In April of 1982, he was murdered.
Now, while every local TV station and newspaper was recounting the details of his horrific death, your Adam Saber was six years old, his mother had just died and he'd been placed in the first of several foster homes.
His escape was this... this macabre murder.
Now, everything that Adam knew of David he would have gleaned from the media, right?
OK, well, say that I agree with these...
...somewhat shaky assumptions.
Why would Adam create a delusion?
Give me your wallet.
Any wallet will do?
Mm-hm.
Alright.
So why do you carry this picture of Mom?
To remind me of her.
Mm-hm, and experience the positive effects that these memories evoke.
Yeah.
Yes.
Now, if this picture existed but you had no awareness of it, would you still be able to benefit from its existence?
I suppose not, no.
Oh, OK.
So I believe, as a child,
Adam Saber began carrying around a mental picture of David so that no matter where he went, no matter how horrific things became, there was always someone who had it worse -
David Bernburg who was tortured to death by Satan-worshipping mountain witches.
But to benefit from this mental image, he must be fully aware of it and therefore cannot be disassociated.
That is a very compelling diagnosis.
Thank you very much.
How are you gonna prove it?
Oh, oh, Dad, I'm not gonna prove it.
I'm gonna cure it.
Hello, Mrs Bernburg.
Thank you again for agreeing to help me with this.
I wanted to tell you that, um, Adam has created an impersonation of your son.
I, um... I don't want you to be alarmed.
I've raised three boys and said prayers upon their graves.
Not much alarms me.
Thank you. I do appreciate it.
Here's... this is Adam now.
Hello, Adam.
Hey.
This is Dita Bernburg.
Is the name familiar to you at all?
Nope.
Er, her son David was murdered 25 years ago.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
You may have heard of it.
It was in the papers.
25 years ago? I was, like, 6 years old.
I didn't read the papers much.
Mm-hm.
You gonna get that?
No-one knows I'm here.
It's probably for you.
Yo, this is Adam.
I'd like to speak with David, please.
There's no David here.
Momma?
You found me, Momma.
My son is dead.
No, Momma. I'm not dead.
You are not my son.
Yes, I am.
We live at the Quarry House on Tull Road.
I was able to find your address in the phone book.
My bedroom used to be a library.
You used to fold the clothes on the shelves like books.
Stop it.
Yeah.
You used to say, "What clothes shall we read today, David?"
No.
My bed.
My bed was made from harvest wood to keep me safe from the spirits.
My son died 25 years ago.
You have a nail in your pocket.
How could you know that?
No-one knows that, only...
We found it in in Askern Mine.
You always carry it, Momma.
David.
Momma.
Iron from the earth...
...to ward off evil.
To ward off evil.
Yes.
Then it's not working.
I know there's a rational explanation for this. Just wait for me.
Momma!
Yeah, this is it.
You can get him out of the van.
You want me to come with you?
No, we'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Alright.
I'll be fine.
Alright, David, do you know where you are?
No, ma'am.
Well, there's no reason that you should recognise this place.
What is it?
What's the matter.
I was here at night.
What?
That's why I didn't recognise this place.
Things are different.
It was snowing.
Right there, there was a shed.
David?
He's coming.
Who's coming?
Who's coming?
Shhh.
Just tell me.
It's alright. It's alright.
Tell me. Tell me, who is it?
Who is it? Who's coming?
The Devil.
I'm sorry. Alright, I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
I'm gonna take you back to the van.
OK? I'm taking you...
Alright. Here we go, OK.
It's alright.
Please, please, please get me out of here.
Listen, the chair is stuck.
I have to go back...
No! No, please.
Please don't leave me.
Alright, OK. Alright. OK.
Just... I need to get a signal.
I'm just gonna walk away and get a signal, OK?
You 're alright. You 're alright.
Hey, Cara.
Hi, Virgil.
Something wrong?
No, no, I'm alright.
The chair is stuck and I need you to push it out.
Alright. Let me find something.
I'll be right there.
Thanks. OK. 'Bye.
Let's see what we've got.
Stuck, huh?
Hi, Adam.
Who's Adam?
Here we go.
My name is Dr Caroline Jessup.
Yeah, we'll get to you later.
Adam...
I asked who Adam was.
Adam is a patient of mine.
Are you alright?
You feel confused?
Confused?
You don't tell me when to be confused, lady.
You 're not the one who keeps waking up in strange goddamn places with no idea how you got there.
So I asked you a question.
Where am I?
And why would you think I was Adam?
You 're at Walker's Mill.
And you look like Adam.
Hey!
Caroline, are you alright?
Yeah. We're fine.
I was, um... I'm just... I'm talking to, er...
Wes.
Wes.
Morning, Virgil.
Hey, Wesley.
Right. There we go. Beautiful.
- Catch. Catch it.
Nice, alright. Take a shot.
Dad!
Dad.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you.
OK. I'll be right back.
Why are you...
I just met Wes!
Wh...
Why, Dad? Why?
Why do you do this to me?
Because you 've stopped asking questions.
That's all I do. That's all I do all day long.
That's all I do, Dad.
No, no!
You 've stopped asking questions of yourself, Caroline!
You 've developed this fixed system of beliefs which you refuse to submit to any kind of introspection.
So what that means is that you will never have a new thought in your professional life.
You have got to learn to take those ideas, set them to one side and try to move ahead with one big question, which is, "Why?"!
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."
Just because you 're older, it doesn't mean you 're right.
It might mean that you 've been wrong for longer.
What has been your motivation here?
Has it been to help Adam to discover whatever...
...crisis it is that caused him to fracture his psyche?
Or has it been to simply flat out prove me wrong?
Hmm?
Oh, hon.
Come on, don't!
Alright, everybody go take a shower now.
Honey!
OK, so, Wesley Crite was a frontman for an underground rock band.
He died November 1994.
It was a possible suicide.
At this exact point,
Adam Saber is in prison.
He's just been placed in solitary confinement.
So at this low, low moment in his life, he assumes yet another person who has a story worse than his own.
OK.
OK.
Good.
Hello, Wesley.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I have all the time in the world, Dr Jessup.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's alright with you.
I would first like to ask you a question.
Yes?
Do you hold that doctorate in the name of science or God?
Why do you ask?
That thing around your neck.
Mmm.
I'd-I'd like to consider myself a doctor of science...
...but a woman of God.
There's something I'd like to show you.
November 18, 1994.
Does that mean anything to you?
Get away from me.
Do you know what happened that day?
Get away.
What happened that day?
What do you know about that day?
Get away from me.
Wes.
GET AWAY FROM ME!
David?
Are you alright?
He was here.
Who? Who was here?
Where did you hear that?
I didn't hear it.
I've wrote it.
That's David's song.
Was it ever published?
No.
David made it up in the hospital after his accident, and he'd sing it to himself whenever he became sad or scared.
When he was scared?
It seemed to be a sanctuary for him, a shelter in the storm.
Is it possible that, um...
...the night he was murdered, when he was in the woods, is it possible that he sang this lullaby?
I pray he did.
Hello?
Hey, Dad.
I think that when Adam Saber was a little boy, he may have witnessed
David Bernburg's murder.
And David is an escape from that memory. Maybe Wes is too.
Do you have a home address for Adam?
Why?
Because I wanna know what kind of life
Adam is trying to escape from.
Hey.
Hey there, buddy.
Good boy. Good boy.
Hello!
Hello?
Hey, buddy. Are you all alone?
It's alright. It's alright. I'm gonna come in.
I'm coming in. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hello?
Oh, shit.
OK. OK, OK.
OK, buddy. Alright.
See if I can find anything.
Here you go. Here you go.
There. Poor thing.
Ugh.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello?
Oh, God. Oh, gosh.
Mmm... Ohh...
Ohh.
Ohh.
OK.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
First dead body?
No.
We sent someone to pick up this Adam Saber for questioning.
Shit! Shit.
Um, I-I... I forgot to pick up my daughter. I can't stay.
You don't have to be here.
Thanks.
I got it.
Thank you.
- Did you see me?
- You did a great job, honey.
Really, Dad?
Kenna, come on, we're leaving.
I'll be there in one second.
Hello?
Detective Danton?
It's Caroline Jessup.
Hello.
Adam Saber is at my daughter's elementary school.
You 're sure it's him?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's Brockhurst Elementary.
Alright.
At the soccer fields.
Alright, I'll...
Hi.
...send the car and I'll be there.
As soon as you can. Thanks.
Sammy!
Sammy!
You see?
Samantha!
I told you she'd be here.
No need to worry.
Samantha!
Sammy.
Samantha. Samantha.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I need you to come over here right now.
But, Mom...
Right now! Get over here!
Come on. Come on.
I want you to go and wait with Brody's mom, OK?
Is everything alright?
How did you get here?
I'm not entirely sure.
Sammy was wonderful!
I think she's gonna make...
I want you to stay away from my family!
But you invited me.
I did no such thing.
At the hospital.
What hospital?
When you came to see me.
CC, are you alright?
What did you call me?
Little CC.
Who are you?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Caroline, it's me.
Charles.
I thought we had a rule about not talking to strangers.
But he knew my name.
And he just wanted to talk to me until you got there.
What did he want to talk about?
First he wanted to know family stuff.
Yeah?
Like what we did this summer.
And my birthday.
What about your birthday?
If I liked the books he sent me.
What else?
Then he wanted to know about God and stuff.
What did you tell him?
That I didn't believe.
Why would you say that, honey?
Because if God was real he wouldn't have let Daddy die.
You know, I think...
...I think that God knew how wonderful Daddy was.
And he wanted him in heaven to make it a better place.
It's alright that I don't believe, Mommy.
Why?
Grandpa doesn't believe anymore.
So whatever happens, I'll be with him.
Here.
God loves you.
And he always will, OK?
OK.
What did you do to your back?
Don't know.
It kind of itches.
Oh.
I'll put something on it, OK?
He, Dad, it's me.
Look, I think there's a connection between Adam and his alters.
They all seem to want to know if you have faith.
Adam asked you, Wes asked me,
Charles asked Sammy.
Charles?
Well...
Adam came to Sammy's school pretending to be Charles.
Caroline, Charles is dead.
What? I... Dad, I just talked to him.
He was sick, but he didn't... I mean...
Dad, I'm so sorry.
Me too.
He always had to do everything first.
Are you alright?
Yeah.
It's just a tickle.
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you too, Daddy.
Bye-bye.
I noticed a sketchbook in your room.
You like to draw, huh?
Idle hands.
Moses drowning in an unparted sea.
Mm-hm.
So, I'm seeing this, right?
The shadow's moving. It looks like there's somebody else there, right?
Yeah, but...
But...
...you know.
But... But what?
Cara, this is... Come on, this is Dad.
He's doing what he always does.
He's messing with you.
Can you just find out what it is?
Yeah, sure.
So, uh...
What's the deal?
The deal, Mr Saber, is a body found at your house.
Excuse me?
Male. Approximately 30-50 years of age.
You know him?
OK.
Are you a religious man, Mr Saber?
I only ask as this cross was etched into the victim's back.
Do you recognise this?
Maybe it was burnt or carved in, we're not sure yet.
Does this mean anything to you?
No.
Adam, do you recognise any of these?
Do you recognise them?
Does this cross mean anything to you?
Do you recognise any of these?
I said, "I don't recognise them!"
Are you deaf?!
OK. Excuse me. Excuse me, Detective.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Don't push him on this right now.
You 're not gonna get anywhere.
And I... I think I can help you with that cross.
I've seen it somewhere before.
Yeah.
I saw markings like this in town.
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to ask.
Dr Jessup, why are you here?
Your textbooks have failed you, isn't that right?
Yes.
So listen.
That's why God gave us two ears but one mouth.
There's the Devil's magic in these hills, that some may try to tend an ailing child or take revenge for a terrible wrongdoing.
Remember this.
Your books may have failed you, but your God has not.
Follow on where the road ends to the very top of the valley.
You 'll see a Holler there.
Ask for the Granny.
Excuse me?
I... I'm looking for the Granny.
It's important that I find her.
I need... I need to...
I need to find out what this is.
I-I think it's some kind of a cross.
Do you know what it is?
Do you... Do you know?
Let me see.
It's no cross.
How are you doing that?
With better eyes than yours.
Can you tell me what it means?
You won't believe. Child!
What the hell is that?
Want a soda?
Mm-mm.
You sure?
Mm-hm.
No way. No freaking way.
Ow! What are you doing?
Sorry, pal.
I need to try something.
Uncle Stephen.
What are you doing?
I gotta check something.
Arggh!
Hold him down. Hold him down!
Keep still!
He'll be fine.
Now will you believe?
It's the writing of the mountains.
This... is shelter.
You have two new messages.
Dr Jessup, this is Detective Danton.
Just wanted to let you know there wasn't enough to hold Adam Saber but we released him into your father's care.
Any luck with that cross? Call me.
Next message.
Jesus, Carrie, where the hell are you?
OK, the darkness on the video, the thing that moves...
...it's a sound wave.
It's a voice.
Carrie, it's a fricking voice. Listen.
Reverend Christian Moore...
...shelter now the faithless!
Hear that?
Cara.
What was that?
Uh, I have no idea. But I do know who Christian Moore is. Or was.
He was born in Burlington,
Alabama, in 1889.
He's one of those good ol' boys, southern faith healers.
He died in... 1918.
That's all the info I got.
However, listen to this. OK.
There's some sort of historical society in Milling Junction.
Now, there's a guy there by the name of Monty.
He has all this information on him.
OK, I'm-I'm... I'm about 50 miles from Milling Junction now.
You can be there in an hour. Go.
You alright?
My throat scratches.
Let me see what I got.
No cough medicines.
Mom says it's not good for you.
Seriously?
Honey works though.
Yeah? OK.
Uncle Stephen.
Yeah?
I think there's something on my back.
Well, my late father made these films right after the Great War.
That's when it came.
The influenza epidemic.
And that's when we met him.
The Reverend Christian Moore.
He was a self-proclaimed faith healer and he told the Holler folks that they didn't need their voodoo medicine.
Just faith in the Lord.
And he had a good number of Holler folk turn their backs on the Granny.
You see, he used, as an example, his own two children.
They were full of health and apparently immune to the ravages of the disease.
And they were strange children, as I remember. Quiet.
Turns out that their silence was for a good reason.
The Reverend had lost his faith and he had had his own kin inoculated against the disease, leaving the others to die.
That's awful.
And that's why the Holler folk did what they did.
What was that?
My father was filming as usual and I accompanied him.
And that's when I found them - the Reverend's children.
They dragged the Reverend to the Granny.
And she handed down her own form of mountain justice for his faithless ways.
And I can't really tell you what happened...
...but to a child of eight...
...it sure as hell looked like that old hag had sucked out Christian Moore's soul...
...and stuffed his gullet with dirt so that it couldn't get back in.
And then she said something that I... I'll never forget.
Reverend Christian Moore, shelter now the faithless.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Doctor Jessup, it's Detective Danton.
Can you hear me?
Yeah. What... Wh-what's the matter?
I just wanna let you know we've dispatched a squad car to your father's location.
They'll be there in a few minutes.
I'm on my way now.
Why?! Why? What's happened?!
There's been a mistake.
Hello?
Dad?
Oh, hey, sweetie.
Dad, is Adam with you now?
Yes. The police dropped him off a while ago.
Can he hear what I'm saying?
I shouldn't think so. He's in his room.
OK, um, Dad, I need you to leave.
Why? What's going on?
You 're in danger.
What are you talking about?
Dad, Adam Saber is dead.
Can you hear me?
Yes, but you 're not making any sense.
The body that I found - that was Adam.
Whoever's with you now is not Adam Saber.
Well, then, who is he?
I don't know who he...
Oh, my God.
Dad...
Dad... Dad!
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Dad?
Dad, w...
Da...
Dad...
No...
Just pick up, please.
Latham Institute.
Virgil, I need you to run upstairs and check on my dad, OK?
OK. I'll check on him. I'll put you on hold.
Dr Harding? Shit. Shit.
No! Jesus Christ!
Dr... Dr Harding...
Cara... Cara... Cara, you...
Virgil, where... where's my dad?
Something terrible's happened, Cara. I...
He's gone.
He's dead.
What?
I couldn't...
There was nothing I could do.
He's gone.
Wh... Wha...
Wh... What?
I'm so sorry, Cara. So sorry...
Hello?
Hi, sweetie. It's Mommy.
Can you... Can you...
Can you put your uncle on?
Mom wants to talk to you.
He's getting his car keys.
Wh-why? Where are you going?
Come on. Come on.
Sammy, are you alright?
Hey. Sammy's coughing up a storm.
She's got some rash on her back.
Her paediatrician's closed.
They said I should start heading to General.
Cara?
Cara?
Are you there?
A doctor can't help her.
Are you out of your mind, Cara?
She needs to see a doctor.
Think about what you heard on that video.
This man is so dangerous.
Please, you have to bring her up here.
No, you have to listen to yourself.
I'm not taking my niece to a goddamn witchdoctor.
I'm taking her to a hospital.
Please listen to me and bring her here.
No!
Where are we going?
To the hospital. You 're gonna be fine.
Stevo! Wait.
Stay the hell away from us.
Stevo! You have no idea what's going on here, Stevie.
Samantha Jane! Come with me!
Samantha Jane!
Go, go, go, go! Up the stairs.
Come on. In the bathroom.
In the bathroom. Go, go, go.
You 're in great danger, buckaroo.
Hey. Your freak show just showed up in Dad's car.
Keep him away from her, OK?
Stephen, for once in your life, will you listen to your father?!
Here.
Hi, Mommy.
Hey, baby. Hey, do whatever your Uncle Stephen says, OK?
OK.
Now, everything's gonna be OK and I'm gonna stay on the phone with you the whole time, alright?
I'm scared, Mommy.
I know. I know.
The man from the soccer field - he's here.
I know, honey. I know. I know.
Stevo!
He's coming up the stairs.
He's in the house.
Stephen?
Samantha Jane!
Stephen, this is your father.
This is no time to be playing games,
Stephen.
Shh...
Sammy?
Samantha Jane, honey.
You gotta come with your grandpa,
Samantha Jane.
Shh.
Honey?
Please! Damn it, Stevie, open the door!
We don't have much time!
There's a very bad man coming, Stevie!
Open the door!
I can't help you if you don't open the door to your father!
I don't care, man!
Get out of this house now!
Stevie! Stevie!
Stevie!
Ugh!
Sammy!
Arrgh!
Samantha Jane...
Sammy! Sammy! Stephen?
That was an accident, honey.
Listen to me.
You gotta come with me,
Samantha Jane.
Sammy, tell him to put David on the phone.
She wants to speak to David.
David? David's not here, sweetie.
Sammy, put me...
Put me on speaker phone.
Caroline?
Put David on the fucking phone now!
Sammy? Sam... Stephen? Stephen?
Mommy...
...he fell.
Sammy?
Can you come here and get me?
Before he wakes up. Uncle Stephen?
Are you OK?
Tell me where this witchdoctor is.
Come on. You 're fine.
I'm scared!
Don't be scared.
Buckle up.
Come on!
When I cough, it feels like
I wanna throw up, Uncle Stephen.
We're gonna see your mom real soon, OK?
I promise.
Hey! Hey!
Mommy!
I'll carry you, baby.
Give me your hands. It's OK.
Oh, my God. Come on.
Ow! Ow, Mommy!
Let me see.
OK. Drive, Stephen.
Drive straight ahead.
How much further?
It's just a couple more miles.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
I know. I know.
Just go straight. We'll be there soon.
Jesus, I hope you know what you 're doing.
Just keep going straight!
Watch out!
Shit!
Oh, God! Oh, good.
What the hell is that?
It's alright. It's alright.
We're here. It's alright.
You stay here. Stay right here, Stephen.
Come on, honey. Come on.
Oh, it's OK. You 're alright.
I know, I know. It's OK.
Oh, f... Fu...
Shit.
Ah, come on.
Arrgh! Arrgh!
Mom, I don't want to...
No. It's alright. It's OK.
Just show her your back.
She looks scary.
Show her your back.
She's gonna help you. It's OK.
I'm gonna be right here.
Do I have to?
I'm gonna be right here, OK?
Lost your way, did you, child?
From God?
My daddy died.
Terrible thing, to lose a loved one.
Worse thing to lose your faith.
I'm sorry, child.
Why?
Once the sheltering has begun, he will find you.
No. No.
No, no, you have to do something.
She's made her choice.
She didn't make a choice.
She didn't make a choice. She's a child.
We are all God's children.
Please help us. Help... Help her.
She will not be alone.
She will rest with the sheltered ones.
No. No!
Mommy!
Stephen! Stephen!
Cover your eyes, OK?
Don't look. Don't look. Don't.
OK.
Stephen... Stephen?
Stephen...
Don't... Keys... Keys...
Sammy!
Mom!
Come on.
Arggh!
Mommy!
Sammy...
OK. OK. Are you OK?
Alright, baby. OK. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
OK, I'm sorry. OK, sorry.
It's OK. You 're OK. It's OK.
Shh.
Sammy? Sammy, what is it?
Oh, my God. It's OK, baby.
Get it out. Get it out.
Oh, my God. OK.
Mommy, I can't feel my fingers.
OK, baby. It's OK. You 're alright.
It's gonna be alright.
You 're gonna be al...
Ugh!
Sammy!
Mommy?
You 're bleeding, Mommy.
I hit my head.
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm really scared, Mommy.
It's OK. It's OK. Shh... Shh...
Shh. Come on. Come here. Come here.
Come here. It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's alright. It's alright. It's OK.
Shh...
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
Shh... OK, OK. OK. OK.
Alright. Alright. It's alright.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Bless the bed that I lay on
Bless me as I lay me down to sleep
I give myself to God to keep
Five little angels round my bed
One to the foot and one to the head
One to sing and one to pray...
...and one to take my sins away.
Amen.
Mommy...
Mommy...
It's OK.
Mommy!
Arggh!
Sammy.
Sammy?
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe, Sammy.
Oh, God.
Sammy?
You gotta be kidding me.
I can't take you.
Well, how many times have I taken you to the airport?
Matt has a soccer game tomorrow.
I have a report I have to finish.
It'll only take an hour.
Fine. I'll call a cab.
Oh, come on, Kyle.
[Text message tone]
[Sent tone]
Kyle, I'm running out!
[Car lock beep]
Uhh!
[Tires squealing]
Come on, Rossi.
I don't want to use them.
I don't even understand you.
It's a vacation, Rossi.
Everyone likes vacation.
Vacations are overrated.
Didn't you take a vacation two years ago?
Luckily, two days in
I was called back.
Garcia: Yeah, and now he's got 31 days.
A month?
You know, sunshine is an essential source of vitamin D.
You should go to Florida and get some sunshine.
That's for old guys.
What about a safari in Africa?
Too hot.
Reid: How about Italy?
Too many relatives.
You sound hermetic.
No, Rossi just likes his wine and stogies.
And I go crazy if I have nothing to do.
You know, Rossi, if you don't use 'em, you lose 'em.
Thank you. This is what
I've been telling him.
See this? This is my
"I don't care" face.
That's your normal face.
If I were you, I'd give your vacation days away to a colleague in need.
[Snaps fingers]
Garcia, see how many people in the Bureau have spouses in the military serving overseas.
I am on it.
Altruism is sexy.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.
Let's get started.
All right, crime-fighters, last night, two victims,
Brenda Wipley and Mark Coleman were found murdered hours apart, one in San Diego, one in Los Angeles.
They were blitz-attacked and they were chained to a car where they were dragged alive to their deaths.
And the local P.D. does not believe the victims knew each other.
And both received similar text messages last night from prepaid phones asking them to meet.
So our unsub's a friend or at least pretends to be one.
Based on how they were killed, he wanted to see them suffer.
Morgan: He's sadistic.
Mm-hmm. And mission oriented.
Dragging's usually associated with hate crimes, but neither victim was a minority nor gay.
Actually, dragging is steeped in English history.
Back in the 11th Century, drawing and quartering was a common form of punishment, and in fact, they would also disembowel and behead the victims when they were done with them.
But that didn't happen here.
Maybe this is just a serial killer who crosses city lines.
I don't know. Two victims in 3 hours?
That's a spree.
Our unsub may claim another victim soon.
Which is why we're headed west.
We'll land in Orange County, half of us will go to San Diego, the other half L.A.
Wheels up in 30.
Uhh!
Wait. Wait. Come back!
What did I do to?!
Please don't do this!
No!
Oh, no, no!

Rossi: Ralph Steadman wrote,
"evil is always devising more corrosive misery through man's restless need to exact revenge out of his hate."
All right, let's go to victimology.
Neither of the victims was sexually assaulted or robbed.
Well, Brenda was a teacher and a mother of two.
She went to meet a friend that night.
Mm-hmm. And her husband backs the story.
And the other victim,
Mark Coleman, was an addict.
He was killed in the parking lot of a drugstore around the corner from the sober living house.
A woman with no apparent addiction and a tweaker in a sober living house?
They probably don't know each other.
Garcia, did the unsub call the victims on the disposable cells prior to that night?
Let's see. In the last few weeks, he called each of the victims over two times a day.
That's not random.
It's hunting.
Without phone transcripts, it's going to be hard to understand what the unsub's ruse was.
Well, it ended pretty bad.
Tying someone to the back of a car is horrific and uncharacteristically high-risk behavior.
It was pure torture. Skin was scraped off, bones were broken.
That's about desecrating the body.
Well, our unsub is comfortable using chains and hitching equipment.
You know, the crimes could have been committed to promote fear.
All right, just-- can we rewind for a second?
Is it possible to kill someone in San Diego and then drive 2 1/2 hours up to L.A.
And then do it again?
If you drove a V8 engine with a single plane crankshaft
80 miles per hour in good traffic, you took the I-5 to the 405 to the 10 east, got off on La Cienega, went right on Washington, north on Vermont, and then snuck up Selma using the back alley, you could do it in an hour, 42 minutes, and still have time for tacos.
Wow.
Yeah.
JJ, you and Morgan go to the latest crime scene.
Dave, you and Blake to San Diego to the medical examiner's, and Reid and I will go to the LAPD.
[Indistinct chatter and police radio]
Officer: You gotta keep the barricades back.
JJ.
The blood trail ends about 3 blocks away where the body was found.
This is where he was tied to the car.
What's up with the drugstore?
It was closed Friday. They're in the middle of a remodel.
That's convenient.
Yes. So is the fact that the camera's not working.
So the unsub drags Mark over here, then blitz attacks him from behind.
Ok, if the killer knew the drugstore was closed and the cameras weren't working, he wasn't expecting anyone here.
And he scoped out the nearby streets.
He knew there'd be low traffic, so he could drag the victims without being caught.
What if Mark was falling off the wagon and he was meeting his dealer?
Right? Like the first victim also met the unsub in a parking lot.
Maybe she had a drug habit, too.
It's possible.
But either way, our unsub is highly organized.
[Cell phone rings]
Hello?
Oh, hi.
I can't do it today.
I know.
I'm really sorry.
Next week.
Promise.
[Text message tone]
Me, too.
Name the place.
Officer: The desk sergeant.
[Indistinct chatter]
Hi, I'm Detective Pratt.
You must be SSA Hotchner.
I am. This is
Dr. Spencer Reid.
Pleasure.
Well, I talked to San Diego PD.
They sent over everything on the first victim Brenda Wipley's case.
And Mr. Coleman's updated file's on the conference room table.
I'll start looking them over.
Now, should we notify the press that we're looking for a spree killer?
Not until we know exactly what we're looking for.
Ok. You guys can set up right in here.
[Text message tone]
Thank you.
Morgan and JJ think that maybe our second victim Mark went to meet a drug dealer.
Have you gotten the tox screens back?
Neither of the victims had drugs in their system.
It doesn't mean they didn't go meet a dealer.
But a drug dealer doesn't call you twice a day for two weeks.
Usually you call him.
[Cell phone rings]
Go ahead, Garcia.
The path of my cyber sleuthing has had majestic results.
Digging into victim number two's past, it turns out meth isn't the only thing
Mark Coleman had done.
He also changed his last name.
From what?
Logan. And that's where the plot thickens like a bad pudding.
So when Mark was a junior in college, he gets picked up by police on a drug charge.
They find some articles of clothing of a missing 8-year-old girl named Kelly Taylor in his car.
They are covered with Mark's DNA.
After a lengthy interrogation, he confesses to sexually assaulting her, but denies killing her, and because her body was never found, they couldn't link him to the disappearance.
What's he been doing since he got out?
Eating hamburgers.
He got released a month ago.
Since then he's worked at 3 different fast food joints.
Send me everything you've got on the case.
I'll have Reid go talk to the family.
Yeah.
Outside.
I was having my soup.
Now.
Thanks. Garcia was only able to give away
25 of my vacation days to employees with loved ones in Afghanistan.
Well, great. Now you just have to figure out what to do with the remaining 6.
Hey. I'm Dr. Mathis.
I heard it took the L.A. M.E. 4 hours to find the second victim's entire body.
Yeah, he was spread all over the place.
Well, victim one had it easy by comparison.
She was dragged postmortem.
We thought she was alive at first.
No. She died from a series of blows to the head.
So the unsub was scared on his first kill, then two hours later when he got his second victim, his confidence suddenly evolved.
That's a pretty quick evolution.
And therein lies the problem.
So I talked to victim number two's father.
He said as far as he knew, no one was trying to get back at Mark for the rape.
He got out of jail last month.
He was getting out more, exercising, trying to get on with his life.
Well, I just compared photos from the first and second crime scenes.
The cars used to drag were different.
Maybe the killer switched cars?
Or we're looking at two unsubs.
What did you and Morgan find?
Well, at both crime scenes, the nearby stores were either closed or being remodeled, so the killer would have had to scope the area, lure and drag the victim without being caught.
This guy has a lot to do.
So the question remains, how can you do that twice in one night in cities over
100 miles apart?
Two unsubs would explain the evolution in M.O.
What did Rossi and Blake say?
The first victim Brenda was dragged postmortem.
The second victim was alive.
So we're most likely looking at one unsub who's hesitant and another one who actually enjoys it.
What do you mean, you killed her first?
I just couldn't do it while she was still alive.
But that's the whole point.
Come on, you know what she did.
I know. But she was begging for her life and I just couldn't hear it anymore.
Oh, you should have called me.
You had your own thing to do.
Ok, we've been planning this thing for 6 months.
If you thought you were gonna chicken out, you should have told me at last week's meeting.
Ok, we're done now, so let's just go home and pretend this never happened.
No. We're not going anywhere.
When I killed Mark, he told me there were two other guys that helped.
What?
He didn't do this alone?
So what are we gonna do now?
We're gonna kill them.
That is what we're gonna do.
I can't do this again!
Yes. Yes.
Yes, Darlene, you can.
I don't know...
Darlene, if we don't do this, who else will?
We know most teams work together, two unsubs versus one victim.
Here we have a team that's 120 miles apart using similar M.O.s on radically different victims.
JJ: Ok, so how do we think they met?
Blake: Something in the victimology should tell us.
Morgan: Well, we know that victim number two, Mark Coleman, has a sketchy background.
What if victim number one was hiding something as well?
Let's start digging.
Who the hell are you?
You thought you could rape and kill an 8-year-old and get away with it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah. That's not what Mark said!
Ok. Ok. I was there, but I didn't do anything.
Shut up!
I thought if I tried to stop them, they'd hurt me.
Imagine how Kelly felt.
What are you doing?
Let's just kill him now.
No, that's too easy.
Now get in the car.
You don't need to do this!
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything!
No!
Help!
Come on!
No, no, I didn't do anything!
Help! Please help!
I didn't do anything! Help!
What did you find?
Paul Montgomery was alive when he was dragged.
And it turns out Paul worked the late shift nearby.
My officers found blood around his vehicle.
He was probably blitz attacked when he left work.
Did we find his cell?
Yeah, it was on the ground.
But he had no text messages or prior calls.
That's a change in M.O.
Usually they lure their victims out.
[Cell phone rings] What happened to their organization?
[Ring]
Garcia, what did you find out about Paul Montgomery?
So guess who were BFFs in college.
Hmm. Mark Coleman and Paul?
10 points to Blakendore.
Turns out Paul was a character witness in Mark Coleman's rape trial.
He waxed poet about his boy.
The jury didn't care.
So we have two scumbags and an innocent mom as victims.
Anything in Brenda Wipley's past?
No, not that I've found yet.
She went to college at UCLA, she went to high school in Orange County.
Does she have a sealed juvie record?
Why didn't I think of that?
See, this is why you're the boss man and I'm the minion who types things.
Uh, it turns out Brenda was not as coifed as her bob.
When she was 17, she was involved in a DUI that resulted in the death of a 2-year-old boy, Sam Dolan.
Did she serve time?
Yeah, she was sentenced to a year in juvie.
It was reduced to two months after her father gave hefty chunks of change to some political organizations.
So, we're definitely looking at a vigilante team avenging the death of these two kids.
We should talk to the parents of the original victims.
I'll bet they're the connection to these unsubs. Thanks, Garcia.
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Dolan.
That was taken at his second birthday.
His mom sent one to everyone.
I know this is hard, but I need to ask you some questions about the death of the woman who killed your son.
Like I told the cops,
I was returning home from London the night Brenda was murdered.
I have my boarding pass.
Ok. Now, what about your wife?
Where was she?
She killed herself a few years ago.
Uh...
I am so sorry to hear that.
She said she was getting better, and-- but ever since
Sam's death, she was a mess.
Do you think the lenient sentence was a contributing factor in her death?
Absolutely.
She thought the system failed us.
She wouldn't leave the house after that.
She even did therapy over the phone.
Did she have friends over?
No.
She spent all her time on the Internet.
Really?
Did she join any online support groups?
How'd you know?
She said it was making her better.
But I--I thought it was making her worse.
Why?
Because it allowed her to obsess about it.
And look where that got her.
Oh, no.
[Vomiting]
Not again.
I can't do this.
I thought it was gonna help, but it isn't.
That's because you're not letting it.
But it's wrong.
An eye for an eye?
It's biblical.
When I wake up in the morning,
I see Kelly's face.
When I close my eyes, she's still there.
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.
Don't. Don't you say that.
But that's how I feel.
You should feel rejuvenated.
Come here. Come on.
Come on.
Look.
Look at you.
They did this.
They did this to you.
So don't tell me they don't deserve what's coming to them.
Order's up.
Thanks.
Just finished my interview.
Sam Dolan's father checks out.
His mother committed suicide a few years ago.
What about Kelly's parents?
We've left them messages, but...
You might send an officer to their house and places of employment.
We should also check at the support group
Sam's mother belonged to.
Morgan:
Well, we got something.
The calls the unsub made to the victims-- twice a day at night.
That shows incredible persistence.
The first victim, Brenda, was a happily married teacher, so why would she take calls from a random man late at night?
If she was cheating, she wouldn't meet someone at a restaurant near her house.
I think she was meeting a woman.
The roommate said the second victim,
Mark, in a sober living house said that he was talking to someone online a lot lately.
The night he got killed, he got dressed up like he was going out on a date.
And he's straight, which further confirms it was a female.
That would explain the blitz attacks.
They weren't because our unsubs were insecure men, they were because our unsubs are women, who needed to subdue their victims first.
We need to give the profile.
We believe that these unsubs are two women who are killing people convicted of heinous crimes.
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
He'll be out in 10 years.
Unlike solo vigilantes, they're working in concert and they're planning and executing coordinated attacks.
Their mentality is like a lynch mob.
They believe the justice system has gone wrong and it's up to them to set it right.
Due to the pre-planning and level of commitment, we believe our unsubs are over 30.
And they probably learned about the crimes they're avenging through the media.
It's possible they were involved in these losses personally and now feel they need to act.
No! I don't accept it!
My baby's life was worth more than 10 years!
This latest attack felt more improvised and personal.
They didn't lure their victim.
Rather, they blitz attacked him outside of his job.
Now, during a spree, the threat is that an unsub will either strike again or disappear.
Now, if they've completed their vendetta, then the latter is more likely.
Our unsubs may not have prior criminal histories, as they see themselves as do-gooders.
Based on the fact that one victim was dragged postmortem and the other were dragged alive, we believe that one woman is not as confident in the mission while the other is more domineering.
We're looking for mothers, relatives, friends who have lost children.
We also need to look at the collateral damage of the crimes our current victims committed years ago.
Since this is the only thing our unsubs have in common, it tell us that as time goes on, their friendship will become strained and ultimately fall apart.
Hotch: So how do these unsubs meet?
Maybe they're involved in the trials.
In two different cities?
I don't know.
If Sam Dolan's mom was in an online support group, maybe after she killed herself, someone else became obsessed with her grief.
Yeah, but who'd have that same level of interest?
Let me call Garcia.
[Ring, beep]
- Hey, Garcia.
- At your service.
Were you able to find out anything about that online support group Mrs. Dolan was in?
Uh, let me see.
Uh, uh, uh, it had 200 members.
It was an anonymous group.
Did any of them start talking about Sam Dolan about two months ago, after his mother's suicide?
Ok, uh, I've got a screen name, Ellen R.
From San Diego. She talked about
Sam in a private chat room.
Did Sam Dolan's mom have any friends or relatives with that name?
Yeah, she's got a sister
Ellen Russel.
She works in a boat shop.
And that'd give her access to hitching equipment.
Who was she interacting with in the support group?
She talked to a lot of people.
In the last year, she was mainly talking to a Darlene B.
Kelly Taylor's mom's name is Darlene.
What's her maiden name?
Beckett. In the last
6 months, most of their discussions have been around the pending release of Mark Coleman from prison.
And they probably hatched a plan.
We need to get search warrants for Ellen's and Darlene's houses.
Oh, my gosh! This just in.
So when Mark was released a month ago, her and Ellen started calling him, posing as a friend.
That would explain the disposable cell phones.
That's the trigger.
Mark's release set them off.
Yeah, right, great.
So Ellen was still mad because there was no justice served for her nephew's death, and...her and Darlene must have agreed to swap revenge killings.
And they'd avoid getting caught.
It's like
"Strangers on a Train."
Yeah, but this ain't
Hitchcock, folks.
Why kill Paul? He was just a character witness for Mark.
A character witness who traveled 300 miles once a week to see his friend in prison.
Friends usually distance themselves from rapists and murderers.
Unless you're involved.
Garcia, you and JJ look into Kelly's disappearance.
We need to find out how these unsubs got to Paul and anybody else who might have been involved in the case.
All right, I'll let him know.
Ok. Got it.
My officers just interviewed
Darlene's ex-husband.
He says she hasn't been the same since Kelly disappeared.
She's been suffering from chronic depression.
The loss of a child either brings you together or breaks you apart.
The day she disappeared,
Kelly left school early because she and her mother were going on vacation, but she never made it home.
They found her underwear in Mark's car, which led to his confession.
I got the lab results back from Kelly's rape.
It turns out there was a second
DNA sample on her underwear, but it's too degraded to make a match.
Maybe the women suspected it was Paul's.
San Diego PD just searched
Ellen's house.
She's not there, but they put an officer out front just in case she comes back.
So we need to figure out who Paul was to Mark in college.
They ran cross-country, sometimes participating in a relay together.
It means they were close.
Don't 4 people do relays?
[Beep]
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.
Listen, we need to figure out who ran in the cross-country relay with Paul Montgomery and Mark Coleman.
Bryce Phillips and Jason Nelson.
They look inseparable.
And where are they now?
Bryce lives in Amsterdam,
Jason in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles.
And what was Jason's relationship with Mark like when he went to jail?
Jason was at the hearing and he visited Mark once a week in prison, so, close?
He probably participated in the crime.
And our killing duo found out about it.
That would explain the change in M.O.
Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration and gave up his boys.
Maybe our ladies are improvising, which explains killing
Paul outside his job.
We need to get to Jason's house before they do.
[TV plays]
[Glass breaking]
[Turns TV off]
Today's your lucky day, Jason.
Who are you?
Kelly's mom.
You remember Kelly, don't you?
Oh--I can explain.
I can explain.
Too late.
I'll do anything you want. Ok?
I could take you to her body.
Her body?
You know where my baby is?
Yeah, yeah.
I can take you there.
If I do that, you'll let me go, right?
[Sirens]
Clear.
Guys, there's broken glass over here.
And blood on the floor.
Morgan! JJ!
Search the bedrooms.
Blake, check outside, see if Jason was dragged.
I am serious. I am not--
I'm not the same guy that I used to be.
Shut up!
I think about what I did to her every day.
Which way?
I--right.
I--I--I have a girlfriend now, and I have a good job.
I've changed.
Change is crap.
Ok? People just become more of who they are.
You don't know me.
Tell me what you did to my daughter that day.
Darlene...
Where did you take her?
Don't answer that.
I have the right to know.
It's complicated.
She was 8 years old.
You tell me what you did to her!
He was into improving himself.
"Let's do healthy relationships."
Go figure.
Guy seems in love.
Ok.
Um...
Uh...it was, uh...
It was hot that day.
We were all just sitting around getting high, and then out of the blue,
Mark asked if, uh, if any one of us had ever been with a... with a little girl.
I mean, of course we said--we said no, but then someone said... that we should go and get one.
And the next thing we know, we were out on the corner.
We're waiting and...
I--I-- we were just about to leave...
When your daughter walked by.
And so you thought, we'll just snatch this little black girl.
Hey. It had nothing to do with race.
My best friend is black.
It's just...
Oh...
Oh, Kelly, she was just--she was so pretty. Oh--
That's enough!
Oh, we just lit up. Oh....
Mommy should have been on time.
[Sobbing]
Son of a bitch!
Aah!
Come on.
What are you doing?
Oh, you think this is funny?
Ohh!
I have been dying to tell that story for so long.
Aah!
Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you serious?
- I need to find her.
I need to bring her back home.
She is dead!
And we are killing this guy.
No, I can't! I have got to bring her back home.
[Groans] Ellen, closure is important to a mom.
And, uh...
[Coughs, groans]
Whoo! Ahh.
Besides, to protect myself,
I told a neighbor to write down the license plate of any strange car that came by.
So... you were expecting us?
Well, I knew you found the first two.
I assumed I'd be next.
Ucch. Why are men so messy?
I don't get down like this.
I'm a clean freak.
Why does that not surprise me?
Something's just... off about this guy.
Gut feeling?
Deep gut.
Jennifer Jareau, your gut knows what it's talking about.
So nothing about Jason Nelson seems out of the ordinary?
He seems as all-American as apple pie.
No reports of any bodies found.
Maybe they haven't killed him yet.
We'll keep you posted.
This guy might give these ladies a run for their money.
Morgan: Trophies.
Kelly wasn't the only girl.
This is all a facade.
Jason's a psychopath.
A psychopath versus two vigilantes.
I have a feeling this is not going to end well.
Is this it?
Is this where you put Kelly?
Uh...hmm...
No.
What do you mean?
You said this was where she is.
Well, I will take you there if you do something for me.
No! This is not a negotiation.
No. It's a bribe.
What do you want?
Kill someone.
Anyone.
And then I'll tell you where it is.
You want us to just kill some random person?
That's what I said.
I want you to know how good I felt.
That's disgusting!
We're not murderers.
Oh, really?
That's not what it looks like from here.
And besides, if you don't do it, my neighbor will drop a dime on you, remember?
You didn't tell your neighbor.
You'll never know.
Darlene, do you want to find your daughter or not?
Not like this.
You don't have a choice, ladies.
Yeah, we do!
Darlene, just do it.
I can't!
Damn it!
Ohh!
Pow! Boom!
Noo!
Awesome!
Oh, no, no, no!
Now you take us to her daughter.
Or you're next.
Ohh.
The victim says he was shot by a white woman.
She was with a black woman and a white guy.
These women have been so specific about their victims up until this point, why shoot a random person?
Jason's a psychopath.
Maybe he made them do it.
He could be holding them hostage.
Or he's got something that's keeping him alive.
A bargaining chip?
Maybe he knows where Kelly's body's buried.
But Ellen did the shooting, not Darlene.
Ellen tortured the second victim.
And she's helping Darlene kill the rest of Kelly's assailants, when she could have just walked away.
So this woman is a psychopath, too.
Then Jason's made a love connection.
And he'll probably try to manipulate Ellen to do something worse.
We lost these women a long time ago.
Blake, turn Jason's place upside down.
We need to find where they may have put Kelly's body.
Ellen, why?!
Now, why did you go and do that?!
We have come too far.
Bull. She liked it.
No, she didn't.
Tell him you didn't like that.
Oh, oh, you know, if we were smart, Ellen, we'd partner up.
Shut up!
We could drive across the country just killing people.
I'd get my little girls, and you can get, you know, whoever you wanted.
That's enough!
Wouldn't it be great...
To live in a world where no one judged you?
I wouldn't judge you, baby.
I would have your back.
Come on.
Come on, what do you say?
If we are not at that body in the next 20 minutes,
I'm gonna take that gun and shove it so far down your throat, you're gonna wish you were dead.
Yeah, yeah... just make a left.
This is getting exciting.
Hmm...
Hmm hmm hmm, let's see.
I think it was over here to the right.
You think or you know?
I know. I just moved it.
Why would you do that?
When Mark died,
I needed to cover my tracks.
Uh...oh. Oh. Oh.
It's right here.
I remember.
Right...here.
Start digging.
The landlord says this is
Jason's storage closet.
It looks like my storage unit.
My husband has so much crap, it's not funny.
Is it hard being in a relationship with someone overseas?
We make it work.
Working for Doctors Without Borders is a very noble cause.
I would imagine you guys have an epistolary novel by now, though.
We stick to Skype.
It's modern.
When we're together, it's like we're dating, and when we're not,
I get stuff done.
Look at this.
Fresh loam soil.
Usually found near plains and streams.
Either he was just camping...
Or used it to move the body.
Jason finds out his friends are killed, he might take precautions.
What is taking so long?
I'm almost there.
Hurry up!
[Thud]
Oh...
[Thud]
Oh. Oh...
There it is.
That's just a skull.
Where's the rest of my daughter?
We have a few more holes to dig.
You cut up my baby?
That was my idea, too.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[Laughing]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
[Screaming]
There's loam soil surrounding some Southern California beaches and also loam soil around some parks in the area.
What areas are near running trails?
Uh, there is a trail in the Hollywood Hills area that is lousy with loam soil.
And I'm sending Morgan and Rossi to the location now.
Over here.
They got him.
We've got officers at Ellen and Darlene's homes just in case they come back.
And have them check the airports, bus stations, train stations, everything.
I'll also put an APB out along the coast.
Garcia cross-checked the trophies we found at Jason's, and they match articles from 3 different missing children.
And have officers excavate the area around where
Jason's body was found.
There may be more bodies there.
I'm on it.
Blake:
At least we got Jason.
He could have kept killing forever.
And the women just get away.
Hmm. For now.
You ok?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Chatter, laughter]
So now what?
Well, um, we're gonna split up.
I might keep heading south.
You'd do good here.
Yeah. You're right.
I think it's better if we don't stay together.
You know what I don't get?
How this was so easy for you.
How so?
We had to kill 5 people.
Our deal was just for two.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
Does it bother you that none of this took the hurt away?
I never thought it would.
Then why did we do it?
Because somebody has to pay, ok?
I don't care what anybody says.
Actions have consequences.
Maybe not at trial.
Maybe not in jail.
Come on.
Admit it, Darlene, this gave you a reason to live.
That's what I was hoping.
But it just made me feel more... more nothing.
Then you're a wuss.
I'm gonna go get us something cold to drink.
Wait. I diss you and you care if I'm thirsty?
Huh. You gotta start thinking about yourself, honey.
That's the game.
Dollars ok?
Gracias.
Ellen Russel?
How'd you find me?
Darlene never unpacked her daughter's bags from this trip.
And I took a wild guess.
So what happens now?
What happens now is you go back to the U.S.
I take 6 days off that I don't even want.
Where's Darlene?
She's long gone.
Personally, I have mixed feelings about that one.
But we'll get her, too.
Levantese.
[Speaking spanish]
...a Los estados unidos.
Rossi: Thanks for your help.
Rossi: Paul Brown once said,
"If you win, say nothing.
If you lose, say less."

Please, let me go home. Please,
I'm not who you think I am.
I am really not who you think I am.
- Please, please, I'm not a spy.
- You are a spy.
Please let me go home.
Try again.
I am not a spy, I am a businesswoman.
I work in the sale of petroleum and gas.
You are here to sabotage our nuclear ambition.
I'm not a spy. I'm not a spy.

Keep your head down and don't say anything until we make the the swap.
In case Kim Jong here changes his mind.
Exchange.
I don't understand.
You don't understand what?
All the rules say to leave me, that one life is not worth blowing operational cover.
You got that right.
If we have to lose someone for the greater good.
We will.
So why did you do it?
Well...
I didn't do it.
He did.
Once he found out where you were, there was no stopping him.
He petitioned the Senate...
State department...
We didn't need the publicity, so I figured we better do something or he's gonna invade this
God damn Republic himself.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Hey.
- Good Morning.
- Happy Anniversary.
You want me to make you breakfast?
How about pancakes?
You're cooking?
You're joking, you like my cooking.
Germans don't joke.
Bert likes my cooking.
Get your bugs off the table.
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.
- Spiders.
- They're bugs.
Are you doing this on company time?
It's my anniversary and
I want it to be perfect.
But... that is not sexy.
No, but it is utilitarian and utilitarian is the new sexy.
Ran the trace, first name
Usem, last name Utsa.
- Any verifiable hits?
- Only one.
Francis, do me a favor... stick it in the safe till tomorrow.
- Matahari here's got a big night tonight.
- Yes sir, Right away Sir.
Sir?
Do I look like a, "Sir" to you?
From head to toe.
I'm surprised he didn't call you "Your Majesty".
I like the ring of that.
I think I prefer "Your Majesty".
Was I ever that young?
Younger.
Walk me out.
How did the Oval Office briefing go?
You know, the usual.
The President wants to know what's happening in Russia the day before it happens.
What about you?
I heard that interview went well.
Hm... Fingers crossed
Are you sure about this?
Once you start pushing papers, there's no turning back.
I had the strangest feeling when I was out last time.
I was homesick.
Homesick?
Sir... Sir...
We got a walk-in...
A defector, 10 minutes ago.
- Here?
- Guess he's not buying our cover.
- You get his bona-fides?
- He's Russian.
He says he's FSB, but won't give us any more.
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?
Passable, not great.
- But if we got down to the subtleties of English...
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.
Come on Salt, no one can sort out a nut job from the real thing faster than you.
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.
Yeah, okay. We'll decide when we know more.
- Who called Counter-Intelligence?
- Not me.
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.
- Peabody.
- Salt.
Please remove the hood.
Microphones are on.
Checking levels.
Baseline recording.
Neuro-scan is up. Ready to go.
Commencing audio and visual recording.
Testing ear piece.
Interview has commenced at 14:42.
You're married.
A husband must be a distraction for a female intelligence officer.
Well, we're here to talk about you.
So what is your name?
My name is Alec Vassilly Orlov.
I have cancer.
I'm moved.
A defector with cancer. Are you selling secrets for chemo or are you afraid of dying?
If I have gained anything by damming myself, it is that I no longer have anything to fear.
- Russia is also dying.
- Alec Vassilly Orlov.
Shows up in 1993 in
Novosibirsk blast, Siberia.
He's on Victor Rasovsky's staff there.
He checks out as FSB.
The scan says he's truthful on the cancer.
Prior to '93...
Nothing...
He doesn't exist.
I have somewhere I need to be, Mr. Orlov
So if you wouldn't mind getting to the point.
In English please.
Others are listening.
1975, The Cold War.
In a gymnasium, a Soviet Olympic wrestler named Sacha Jordorovich, meets for the first time, the only female
Chess Grandmaster of her era.
Within a month they were married.
And within a year, a child.
One month more, the child was back in the same hospital, sick with fever.
And within days after that, the child, suddenly was dead.
Yes, a child was dead... and yes, a child was buried.
But the Chenkov baby was still alive.
And became the property of another man.
A master spy who had devised the greatest plan a Russian patriot could ever invent...
A plan to destroy America.
It had all started with an
American named Lee Harvey Oswald.
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.
Three years later, he returned home. But, the man who came back to America, was in fact a Russian spy... named Alec.
On November 22, 1963,
Alec became the first success of the new program and a hero of the Soviet Union.
The spy master was now given the go ahead, to create many more like Alec.
Scores of agents.
Males and females to be substituted for Americans.
At an abandoned monastery,
Chenkov and other boys and girls learned English long before they learned Russian.
Drilled in idiom, idiosyncrasy.
And ideology.
And by methods of rigorous physical and psychological programming.
The spy master made warriors of iron.
Unquestioned and unbreakable.
You're killing me, man.
When does the good fairy come in?
Never...
It's a story without hope.
Chenkov was matched with a child of a visiting American family.
There was an accident, the family died.
Chenkov was sent to America, to live a complete lie... and to patiently await the day to attack from within, day X.
The long awaited mission is here.
Chenkov will travel to your city to kill the President of Russia, at the funeral of the
American Vice President. Chenkov is KA12.
KA12?
It's an urban legend.
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents, inserted into American society to sabotage and assassinate. supposedly, they’d wait years to strike.
Decades even.
Hmm... Supposedly.
What's the matter, Ted?
You don't believe in moles?
I believe in moles, alright.
Just not the boogey man.
Specially if the plan is to kill their own president.
This guy's selling smoke.
Wrap it up, Eve.
So a Russian agent is gonna kill the Russian president. Is that it?
- Hmm...
- Okay.
Thank you very much and what would you like in return for that information?
I simply wish to help you do what you need to do.
You're good.
KA-program is brilliant bull-shit, but I'm officially off-duty, so you can tell the rest of your little story to one of my colleagues.
- Salt.
- Yes.
The name of the
Russian agent is, Salt. Evelyn Salt.
My name is Evelyn Salt.
Then you are a Russian spy.
Truthful.
So far, the FMRI has registered truthful on everything he said.
Ted.
Call Protective Services and make sure they find my husband.
- Where are you going?
- I need to get to the phone.
No, no. Not after the neuro-scan.
'Cause he didn't flutter?
I can beat that thing five times out of six. I am trained to and so is he.
I need my phone, I need to call my husband.
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.
There is a reason he mentioned my wedding ring Ted.
When they blow up a spy, they don't just blow up their cover, they blow up their whole covered life, you know that.
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what happened to Henry's wife?
- Yes, I do.
- Speak.
"Please leave a message after the tone. Thanks, Bye".
Honey, it's me.
Please call me as soon as you get this.
Okay sweetheart? As soon as you get this.
Godspeed, comrade Chenkov.
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.
Look Eve, try to stay calm...
I'm not a goddamn Russia spy.
I didn't say you were.
Let's go up to my office so we can sort this out.
No, no. We gotta go to a secure location.
- Now.
- Alright.
Doesn't get anymore secure than this.
Eve?
Five minutes.
Call Protective Services and tell them to find Mike.
This is bullshit.
Give us a sec.
I know that we're heading into your jurisdiction here, but I'm asking you for just 5 minutes.
No.
If I have to yes, you can't have five minutes alone with her. I have to talk with her
- She's scared?
- I don't care.
There's a mole in
Russia house Ted.
There's a mole in
Russia house and I am sure...
Please step in the elevator.
What the hell is that?
Sir.
Jesus Chirst.
- There he is again.
- No sign of him so far on the street.
Two minutes to go before we lock down.
We just got a match, Sir.
- In 1981, there's Bresnov and there...
- Orlov.
- That's him.
- Used to be a heavyweight once upon a time.
Get that photo out now. Every ticket counter airport, train station and taxi station, the whole nine yards.
- Get me director Medford on a secure line, now.
- Yes, Sir.
- Top-right screen, is that live?
- Yes sir.
- Where is she going?
- Track her.
Rink Petroleum Security.
You have a woman to your left behind you.
Evelyn Salt.
- We lost visual of her.
- Damn.
Where'd she go?
Hey, Edward. Is Mike there?
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.
Stairwell, second floor.
What's on that floor?
It's empty. Security buffer.
Isolate and seal it.
Get her records to my hand-held.
Kill the power to the elevator doors.
We got her.
Alright.
Get a tactical team to meet me on the south stairwell.
Yes, Sir.
- Director Medford, Sir.
- Get me a side-arm.
I'll call her back.
- Shit.
- I lost visual.
Where is she Albert. Talk to me.
Come on.
North hallway.
There, interrogation room. Bring it up.
- Have you found him?
- What the hell are you doing Eve?
This don't look good.
There's a tac team coming at you in 30 seconds. Get your goddamn panties off the camera. Get where we can see you. So you don't get hurt.
Have you found my husband?
These boys don't fool around, Eve.
- Please, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
- Call me when you find Mike.
Okay, open the doors, about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.
Is that absolutely necessary?
Want, do you want me to shoot her?
Get a medical team in place now.
Okay, on my count.
Go.
Jesus Christ.
Where is she?
Come on, guys. Find her, now.
There. Bring that up.
Stay with her. She's crossing the street.
Pan the god-damned camera.
Back that up and zoom in.
Freeze.
What the hell are you doing, Eve?
Michael Krauss left his office an hour ago.
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.
We can cover it, but she won't go there.
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in the house, okay?
Taxi.
Hugh's street. I'll tell you where to stop.
"Hi, this is Mike. Please leave a message after the tone".
He's one of the world's top arachnologists, Eve.
And as such, enjoys pretty much unrestricted access to the borders of North Korea.
So, brush up on your bugs and get to know him.
He's the perfect cover to get us inside.
Mike?
Mike?
Honey?
Hey baby. Come here.
It's alright.
It's okay. Where's daddy?
Where's daddy?
Go! Go!
Bathroom, clear.
Kitchen, clear.
Office, clear.
Living room, clear.
Everybody out in 60 seconds.
What are you doing?
She's not here and no sign of the husband either.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe that Russian was lying?
I don't know, cause you were gonna lock her up.
Why'd she run?
See it from her perspective.
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.
"Maybe", is your department.
Mine is catching her, so we can find out.
We bring her in, or we bring her down.
Do you have any idea who this woman is?
What she's done for this country.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Should it?
- Is your mom home?
- No.
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.
- Can you baby-sit Bert for me?
- Yeah.
Here's some money for the food.
Did you do your homework?
Yeah, Math.
I hate math.
Hi.
It's nice to see you again.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.
And you?
No, I'm working here at the museum.
I'm an arachnologist.
A what?
I hunt spiders.
I got her.
She's heading north toward the metro-station.
Eve..?
She's east-bound in the mall.
There she is.
All teams south-bound toward the bridge.
Box her in.
Stop!
Stop!
Fuck!
Take it back. Hold your fire.
Stop!
Salt!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, I'm innocent.
On the ground, now.
Just don't shoot.
Salt, on the ground.
- I have to find my husband
- why'd you run?
- To find my husband
- For what reason?
Don't shoot.
- Stay back.
- Last chance.
I'm innocent, somebody is setting me up.
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the god-damn gun down.
- Give yourself up, now!
- No.
On the ground.
We'll sort this out, I promise.
We gotta bring you in Salt.
Someone is gonna try to kill the Russian president, you know that.
Do something about that.
- Give yourself up.
- That's what you should be worried about.
There's nowhere to run.
I didn't do anything.
She's on a blue semi, route one, heading north.
Get a roadblock in place now.
There she is. On the tanker.
Stop! Stop!
Ev..!
- You, my friend, have got a mole in your group.
- We don't know that yet.
Actually, she's a trained god damned liar.
Everything she's done up until now, is to protect her cover.
Why don't you tell me how you really feel about it.
Get off on the shoulder!
Get off on the shoulder!
Okay, take it down.
Shit.
Shit.
Okay.
Ted, I know you're her friend, but we gotta drop a net on New York.
We gotta do it now.
I'll notify the
Secret Service on the details.
Tell 'em Salt might be coming their way.
Here she is.
Orlov may not be far behind either.
You see this?
Salt spent time in Russia when she was a kid.
She was in the car accident with her parents in '88, they both died.
They were teachers at the U.S Embassy for the American children of the staff there.
That's why we put her on
Russia in the first place.
We need to get on a plan to New York. Tonight.
Evelyn.
Look at me.
If there was a way, I would kill them.
- You shouldn't have come here
- What do you mean? I don't understand.
Now they know who you are.
Who?
Evelyn.
Who?
I would accept anything about you, but I need to know.
Look at me. Look at me.
Just tell me, okay?
Just tell me.
I work...
I work for the CIA.
You see, this...?
There is no future for us.
You're not safe with me.
I don't want to be safe.
I know you... and I want to be with you.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Okay?
Okay.
Welcome to New York
Ms. Hernandez. One night?
- A deluxe room.
- Yeah.
- Ms. Hernandez, do you need any help with your luggage?
- No, I got it. Thanks.
A full day here in New York City.
The funeral of Vice-President Maxwell Oates.
A former five term
U.S Senator and Cold War warrior.
He's based legacy may be as architect of the new era of Russian, American relations.
Russian President Boris Matveyev has joined from Moscow to be an
honorary forbearer of the man who's called, "his greatest friend in the West".
What's the security perimeter?
We're too deep inside and we own this entire block.
And those are secret service agents.
Not CIA. So, relax.
That's real funny.
Didn't know you guys told jokes.
Step back! Step back!
Everybody, move away.
Mr. President.
Please be seated.
After the President finishes the chorus and the eulogy...
If she's gonna try anything here, it'll have to be pretty amazing.
I knew he would bring more to the job than just his years of experience.
As Vice-President...
he showed the world best, of what it is to be an American.
And today, the world says,
"Goodbye" to a great man
- I'll take the back.
- Lower floor, clear.
We got two, M.I.A's.
I'm heading down to the crypt, some kind of trouble down there.
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.
All teams converge in the crypt.
I repeat, converge in the crypt.
He made all the difference and for that, he will always have my respect and admiration.
Matveyev!
Get god-damn Matveyev!
Drop it.
Drop it.
Shooters at twelve o'clock.
Don't move.
Take her down! Take her down!
Check for other weapons
We need a medical crew in the crypt immediately.
I can't feel a pulse.
Why?
Do you have any idea how much blood is on your hands?
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.
I'm gonna see to it personally. A god-damn hole.
Back off! Back off!
Let's go!
Matveyev was declared dead en route to the hospital.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
You were right about her.
She had the drop on me, Ted.
Why didn't she shoot?
Cops down, cops down.
Get out of the car with your hands on your head.
Hands in the air.
- What is your name?
- My name is Evelyn Salt.
- What college will you attend?
- Princeton University.
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.
Who will you trust?
No one.
Be very patient.
Remember your training.
Remember, you're not the only one.
There are many others...
- all of you waiting to strike.
- Yes.
- And we will strike... together.
- Yes.
Wait.
One day I will come for all of you.
Hello Evelyn...
I'm Martin Crenshaw, from the U.S. Embassy.
We're very sorry about your family's accident.
Rioters outside the U.S embassy, sheared their new leaders word in taking... strong action against what they are calling,
"A state sponsored act of terrorism." on this part of the U.S.
These rioters are starting similar outbreaks of anti-American protests across Russia.
"We will strike back", say's the new Russian president.
Angrily condemning today’s assassination, by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.
Even as the body of slain
President Matveyev is on it's way back to Moscow, anti-American riots have erupted across Russia.
With bombings of U.S diplomats in Moscow.
The Russian armed forces have been put on high alert.
Responding to a rapid escalating crisis.
President Lewis has called for an emergency White House meeting.
Greetings, comrade Orlov.
When I saw you in Washington
I almost was in tears.
You were not supposed to get married.
Not unless it cut a great tactical advantage.
I did it to seem normal.
When you escaped today, I felt not even I could have hoped for so much.
You are my greatest creation.
You trained me well.
My husband? You have him?
I had to be certain.
But now you trust me.
Completely.
So, tell me what's next.
Next, part 2.
We seize control of this country's atomic weapons.
How?
You won't hear from me again.
My daughter.
Chenkov?
You remember me?
Chenkov.
Did you miss me?
Shnaider?
How long have you been here?
I left Russia one year after you, to Prague.
I have been a NATO-liaison to the
White House for three years. Colonel Edward Tomasz.
And you... are my attache. Your ID.
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.
More importantly, our mission.
The bunker, eight stories below the White House
That's where the President needs to be.
How do we do it?
Don't worry, he will be there.
That's my job, to make sure he's there.
And what's my job?
Do you remember Chenkov, when we were young? and you had to finish first in everything.
You had to be the best at everything.
Even though you knew you would be beaten with a cane you had to finish first.
I remember...
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.
Tonight you will kill America's President.
ID's please.
Pop the hood and open the trunk.
Confirm this, A
Colonel Tomasz and a Major Egypt.
Colonel, Major... All clear.
You know the drill Colonel.
A shrapnel. A Serbian land-mine. They spend more time looking at it than the doctor did.
Step though please, Sir.
Turn around.
Thank you.
Patience is key, I've been coming here for two years. Others have been here longer.
- What others?
- I don't know.
But you were the best of us.
And I was the least.
There must be others here to finish what we begin.
Tomasz, nice to see you again. Pleasure.
You have exactly two minutes before the main meal.
Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt... what can you tell us about her?
We think she may be a Soviet plant.
Inserted years ago in preparation for something the KGB called "Day X".
A day that would mark the start of a large-scale strike against the U.S and her allies.
That should be the President now.
You have a big job Chenkov, but you can do it.
- You still haven't told me what your job is.
- Home.
I'm going home.
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.
- It's a god-damn attack.
- Geronimo, it's SOP. Downward mobile.
I think I saw her.
Saw who?
Salt.
I think I saw her in the corridor.
The other new officer.
She's here.
- Check.
- Clear. Move.
Go.
We may have a visual on the second assailant. Evelyn Salt.
Evelyn Salt on the premises.
Maybe dressed as a NATO officer.
This is not a drill.
We are under attack.
This is not a drill.
I need this hallway cleared to the left, now!
This is Jenkins. I need the
P.R bunker up and running.
If this was authorized by the
Russian Government, it is an act of war and we will respond.
Let's go, Sir.
Move, move.
Close it!
Close it!
Go!
Go!
Geronimo approaching. Close the door in five seconds.
Clear.
- Any chance she could follow?
- My own men couldn't get through that door once it's closed.
Yeah, well.
Unfortunately, she isn't one of your's.
Okay, go.
Stay close. Shut the seal.
Geronimo is secured.
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, Sir.
Sir, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility, that today, right now, could be the start of "Day X".
Mr. President, director Medford is up.
Mary-Anne, what is the situation?
It should be coming up on one of your screens.
What you see there, represents temperature drops in mobile missile units in Siberia.
It means that the Russians are deploying their missiles to the field.
And that's been confirmed on the ground, Mr President.
Mr President, I strongly recommend we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.
At least on a forward basis.
Do it.
And since the Russians are deploying, we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.
It's not on a table, it's not a deterrent.
Sir?
The outer door is jammed and non-responsive.
We just lost the feed from most of our security camera's.
We are blind down here and no one can enter this facility.
Command, our eyes are down both ways and we have a POC security door malfunction.
Get out there, now.
Seal this room.
Down that corridor, secure it.
This is President Howard Lewis, proceed with authentication.
Yes, Mr President.
Ready to commence authentication, sir.
Zulu, Tango, Echo.
Seven, nine, Juliet.
X-ray, Sierra, seven,
Alpha, Mike, Charlie.
Whiskey, Five, Six, Tango.
Authentication is confirmed.
It's all yours now, Mr President.
God be with you.
Attack options and targeting are under your control, Mr President.
- Is the camera outside this door working?
- Yes.
Put it up.
Officer, what is your status?
Officer, come in.
Who the hell is that?
That's her.
That's Evelyn Salt.
Give me your side-arm,
I'm qualified on it.
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess fire-arms in the Presidents facility.
Screw Protocol James. we got an enemy agent out there.
Protocol is protocol, Sir.
And dead, is dead.
I'm the National Security Advisor.
Not anymore.
Sit down.
Who are you?
My name, Mr President, is Nicolai Tchaikovsky.
Unless you do exactly as I say,
I will be the last person you will ever see.
Let's have a look at some attack options.
Go to hell.
Ted?
Why didn't you tell me?
But you weren't with us in Russia,
I would've remembered.
Selected attack targets acquired.
Tehran. Mecca.
Mecca... Tehran...
Missiles arming.
Nuclear command.
You know, when we first came to Langley...
I didn't think
I'll be able to do it, to resist the temptation to say something.
And you met Mike and well... things changed.
"The Russian president is alive"
What you are seeing are live pictures of Russian President Matveyev, arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.
This is astonishing.
According to his doctors...
President Matveyev's mistaken death was attributed to a temporary paralysis from a toxin derived from spider venom.
At least I was right.
I had a feeling we'd lost you back there in North Korea.
I could see how moved you were with
Mike's little white knight routine.
You were supposed to recruit the man, not fall in love with him.
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.
By the way how is Mike?
Orlov is dead.
Oh, that's good news.
Saves me the trouble.
I detect if you twist his arm, you get to blow your cover to the CIA.
You see? He wanted you to come out of this thing alive.
You needed somebody to take the blame.
I'm the bad guy.
And I'm the hero.
Congratulations, Ev'.
You're about to become famous.
Identity confirmation requested.
Identity confirmation requested.
Identity confirmed.
Authorization, 99%.
Permission to launch.
Permission to launch.
Get on the floor now.
I said now!
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!
What is your name sir?
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the President
Mr President, Mr President, can you hear me?
I want her alone in a room. If there are other KA's out there, I want her to talk.
She's trained not to talk, no matter what we do to her.
If we're gonna find these people must find them ourselves.
Somebody already did.
At least some of them, in the
East River. 12 dead, including Orlov.
Who did that?
I don't know. Forensics are on it.
Step back sir, please.
Please step back.
She attacked Winter sir.
You'd better get up here.
Sit down.
She's yours for 15 minutes during the flight.
Then she's the FBI's.
Hey?
Why'd you kill him?
Because somebody had to.
What?
By this I take it, you think everybody’s who they say they are.
You knew something was wrong the moment Orlov walked in.
So did I.
We just didn't know what it was.
Winter did.
Winter?
You expect me to believe that Winter was gonna launch the missiles and you saved the world?
I would like you to believe that, yeah.
It's a big accusation.
Wow.
He's dead now so he can't defend himself.
I guess you'll just have to decide for yourself.
How many more like you are there?
Like me?
None.
Like him?
More than you or I can handle alone.
Do you really think, a trained
Soviet agent couldn’t kill the Russian President at point blank range if she wanted to?
Or you, for that matter.
I could've killed you at the funeral and I didn't.
You surrendered to me because
I gave you no choice.
You know better.
I had a choice.
You know better.
If I did believe you and I'm not saying for a second that I do, but if I did... nobody else would.
Well, maybe you can think of a way around that.
They took everything from me.
I'll kill them.
Bullshit!
We're approaching. Heading due south.
Go get 'em.
Salt!
Circle back!
Circle back!

Hey.
- Working on a Saturday, too?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry about the cheque last month.
I just...
- No worries, man. We're square.
- Thanks.
- Have a good weekend.
- All right, bud. Take care.
Joanie?
John Jr.
Hello?
Surprise!
- God damn it!
- John.
What the...
- I'm sorry, just go to your room. Sorry, guys.
- It's okay, it's okay, guys.
Sorry.
Surprise.
I really don't want to talk about it.
You didn't sell the house, did you?
No, I didn't.
I did everything I could and these people, they...
You know, they just got cold feet.
John, what are we gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get another listing, and then I'll sell that house.
And it'll be fine, just like we always are.
Is that so?
- You know, Joanie, I wish that...
- What?
I wish you could put yourself in my shoes for a minute to see the kind of pressure that I'm under.
You know, what I go through every day.
What is that gonna solve, John?
I'm doing everything I can. Okay?
- What if that's not enough?
- Well, it has to be.
I'm gonna take the kids out.
Honey, we can't afford it.
Air is still free, John, last time I checked.
I'm taking them to the park.
Bye.
Hey, monkeys, let's go. Let's go to the park.
Coming.
Yeah?
Name's Richie.
My car stalled right in front of your house.
Okay. What, you need to call AAA?
You need a phone?
Well, you know, you don't get a welcome like that nowadays. But, no, no.
- Okay, well.
- Think maybe you can give me a push?
Yeah, let's do it.
Nice day, huh?
Sure is.
A day like today will make you forget there's bad things in the world.
Yeah, it's a nice day.
The gas gets a little low in the carb sometimes, like running on fumes.
The gas station's down that way.
Man, you should see this baby go.
Just smoke anything on the road.
- Yeah, just let me know when, all right?
- All right. Push as hard as you can.
Yeah, just let me know when.
Ready?
- No.
- Ready?
All right, yeah. Go on, push!
Yeah, I'm doing the best I can.
Give me a second.
Come on! Push as hard as you can.
You got some muscle on you, boy.
Okay, just tell me when.
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.
- Come on, push faster!
- What are you waiting for?
Push faster!
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.
Jesus, hey, you know what you're doing?
God fucking damn it!
Fuck!
What the fuck are you thinking?
I could teach you a few things about common fucking courtesy.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, fucking leg, Jesus!
- Better get you to a hospital.
- I'm fine.
Don't look fine to me.
- Let me give you a hand.
- Man, I don't need any help.
I beg to differ.
- Come on. Easy does it.
- Fuck.
Look, I got you.
You and me, we're in this thing together.
I'm okay.
- Like riding on air, right?
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Easy, Ricky.
- Richie.
- Rich.
- Wow, you really got hurt.
- Yeah.
- It's all my fault.
- Not your fault.
- You're not blaming me?
- No.
Well, never would have happened if I hadn't come knocking on your door.
Hey, listen, I wanted to help you. Okay?
What is it you do, if you don't mind me asking?
I'm in real estate.
- Used to be.
- What do you mean "used to be"?
Hey, hey, but I bet you glad it happened, all right?
It's "customer's always right."
That sort of shit don't suit a man like you.
It is a racket.
Everything's a racket.
Should I kick it in?
- I thought you said you were out of gas.
- No, no, no. I just said I stalled.
- Okay.
- Let me give her some juice.
Now that, my friend, is 450 cubic inches of American metal.
Four 4-barrel carburettors spitting mad fuel!
This bitch is a fuck beast!
Yeah, this baby can fly!
You're... Watch it, watch it, watch it.
See this guy? This truck, man!
Fuck, watch out!
Who says American cars can't handle?
Those brakes can be a little loose sometimes.
- Scary as hell.
- Yeah.
Look like you were having fun, though.
I don't know if fun's the word, but, yeah,
I guess I needed it a little more than I thought I did.
- Think I didn't know that?
- Yeah?
There's a looker.
Yeah, she is.
Pity. She ain't got a clue.
Seems nice enough.
I don't know, baby.
Fill her up?
Stupid bitch.
What'd she do to you?
Chewing gum at work, that's just fucking rude.
- Nice house you got there, John.
- Thanks.
Bet you got a nice-looking wife.
Maybe a couple of nice kids.
I say, you got kids?
Yeah. I got a girl and a boy.
Not me, John.
Never cared much for pets, either.
- So, how do you know my name?
- You told me.
Yeah?
Only needed two gallons.
- Got some ID?
- What for?
- It's just normal procedure.
- No, no, no. No, John. John, I got this.
So, what's the problem?
You don't like the way I look?
Hey, you know.
- I don't know.
- You don't know.
Pay my manager inside, sir.
You know what? You and me,
- we're a lot alike, you know?
- That so?
- Yeah, that's so.
- Yeah.
- You'll see. Just pay attention.
- Okay.
You'll find out what I'm saying.
Let me take care of this.
I'll take you straight to the hospital.
Got it.
- Everything go okay?
- All good.
Got the gas for free on account of that cunt.
The hospital's the other way.
Yeah, you said yourself you're not hurt that bad.
You know, man, I'm fine. Just take me home.
Let me buy you a drink. It's the least
I could do for what I put you through.
It's the middle of the day.
Come on, you've been drinking already.
I can smell it. Scotch.
It's my drink.
Come on, man, one more won't kill you.
- So, you can't park there.
- I just did.
- You need a permit, that's the thing.
- You're hurt, right?
Ain't that the definition of handicap spot?
Just act like a cripple. We'll be all right.
Okay.
Where you going?
How about that drink?
If you don't want to have a drink with me, all you got to do is say so.
- Look.
- You know...
I know, I can behave a little strangely sometimes.
Just because I'm a little different doesn't make me a bad guy.
I don't think you're a bad guy. It's just...
I just gotta get home. That's all. My wife.
Wife.
Careful.
The damn shitter's broken again.
Plumber's late as usual.
Yeah, I'm always waiting for the muffin man.
Well, you just get your tight little trucker ass on in here before I cream my shorts.
And that's a big 1 0-4.
- Sorry, hi.
- How can I help you?
May I borrow your phone?
I just gotta make a quick call.
Pay phone's at the bar.
Okay, well, it's...
I just gotta call my wife, it's local.
Pay phone's at the bar.
Okay, so, give me your cheapest phone,
I guess.
Last one. Cash or credit?
Look, I'm really sorry. I don't have my wallet.
- If you just let me use the phone...
- Pay phone's at the bar.
Lady, I haven't seen a pay phone in years.
- I'm just trying to...
- Not my problem.
Okay, look, I'll just...
You know, Rhonda, for somebody in the communications business,
I think you could afford to learn a little common courtesy.
Fuck you.
- How's that for common courtesy?
- All right.
Grow some balls.
Actually, I'd just like to use your phone, if that's okay.
Jesus Christ!
- John. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Trevor.
I just need to use the phone. Sorry.
You look like hell.
Yeah, I've been better.
You know, listen, John, it wasn't all my decision.
So, whose was it?
Corporate downsizing.
You just weren't pulling your weight.
Walk away, John, like you always do.
Come on, man.
Johnny, come on and have a drink with us, man.
- My man. I knew you'd be back.
- Yeah.
There ain't no harm in being polite.
Don't worry about me.
You should worry about the fat ass across the street at the phone store.
Yeah, or my jack-off boss who just spilled a beer on me.
I'm fine, though.
You mean the bastard who canned you?
He's here?
Yeah, yeah, that's the very guy. He's here.
He's holding court.
I say we go in there and kick his head inside out.
I shouldn't even have mentioned it. It's fine.
Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call...
Let me loan you a quarter.
It's the least I can do.
I'm fine. It's okay.
Yeah, my name's John Felton.
Hi, it's the Feltons.
We're not home, so leave a message.
You should never tell people you ain't home on your answering machine.
Yeah?
So what exactly is your interest in my business?
I'm just trying to help you out here.
That's what they're looking for. Suckers.
Well, thanks for the warning.
John?
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I'm just leaving.
Come on, one drink.
No, actually, I gotta call Joanie.
I need a ride. I gotta get home.
I can drive you home.
I just gotta use the pisser first.
I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
- What? Taking a piss?
- No, that's not what I meant.
- John, it's just a ride home.
- Okay.
Gotcha.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- What's...
Could have sworn I parked right around here.
- You don't know where you...
- There it is.
So, Tammy, are you okay to drive?
I'm a teensy bit wasted, so maybe you'd better.
Thanks.
You know I broke up with Trevor to be with you.
Yeah, and he fired me.
Is that what you care about?
Look, Tammy.
You know, what we did was wrong, okay?
- For who?
- My family.
Fucking cowards.
You know, that stupid fat ass wouldn't let me make a phone call neither.
Said she didn't like the way I looked, and she kept stuffing doughnuts down her blabber box.
It looked like she'd been locked in a doughnut shop her whole life.
Yeah.
Man gets his dream car towed by the pigs, gets treated like a criminal by an incompetent...
- Where's your common courtesy?
- Exactly.
- I should have listened to you.
- I know.
You tried to warn me about these parking rules.
But what a car though, right?
Pure American muscle.
You could feel that power, right?
I sure did.
You feel it right between your legs.
- It's a muscle car.
- Is that so?
Yeah, that is so, missy. Right, John?
- It's a great car, I'll give you that.
- You know what I'm talking about.
- John, you know this guy?
- Yeah, we...
I really, really hate to ask this, because of everything we've already been through, but you think you can give me a ride to the impound?
I don't think so,
'cause I gotta get home and...
I gotta get home, too!
I'm just like you, John. I'm stranded.
- I don't even know where the impound is.
- I do!
I do! It's not far. Scout's honour.
See, it's not my car, and I gotta take her home.
Name's Richie. I would really appreciate it.
- Well, if John will vouch for you.
- Course he'll vouch for me!
- Right, John?
- Yeah, I mean, we met earlier...
- So, how do you two know each other?
- We work together.
- Work buddies?
- We work together.
- Wanna give him a ride?
- It's fine. We'll give you a ride.
Yeah, we'd better hurry. Looks like rain.
- So, we close?
- Think so.
You think so?
- Man, you even know where it is?
- Yeah.
'Cause we've been driving for like a half hour, and you just said it was a couple miles.
You're a slow driver, John.
Look, so,
- you two really work together?
- That's right.
John tell you he got fired today?
Canned, like a sardine.
Bet you didn't even tell your wife, did you, John?
I told my wife.
The truth hurts.
Do you want me to pull over?
Would you like to walk?
Ain't your car. From what I could see,
Tammy here makes all the rules.
- Don't be a cocktease, baby.
- Hey.
Nothing like a pair of blue balls to drive a man insane.
Hey, don't talk to her like that.
She made her own bed, John. That she did.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Well, honey, you dig a hole in a man's life, you can't expect not to be buried in it.
- What did you tell him, John?
- I didn't tell him anything.
Pull over. You're a piece of shit.
What is this guy doing?
Don't speed up, slow down. Drive him crazy.
Man, would you shut up?
I'm gonna pull over.
You're a pussy, John.
Can't stand up for yourself.
- Just let me handle this, okay?
- Yeah, boss.
- Shit, goddamn!
- Bastard's wrecking my car, John!
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what this guy's...
You must have done something.
- Maybe he saw you leaving town.
- So what?
You said you picked a fight with that fat ass in the phone store, right?
You want to fight, then fight!
What did you do to that woman back there?
Just gave her a piece of my mind.
Same as you. No different.
Except I didn't tuck it between my legs.
John, what are you doing?
Slow down. Just let him go.
- Write his plate down, he can't do that.
- That's the spirit.
- Let's rip his fucking throat out.
- Just let me handle it.
- That guy was trying to kill us, John.
- Just stay in the car.
Don't do something stupid.
Fuck's this guy's problem?
Hey! You could have killed us!
You ran us right off the road!
What the fuck?
You could have killed us, do you understand that?
Wait, wait, stop the car! Let me out.
Look! I don't want any problems!
It's just that was really dangerous.
Saw you drive off after you killed my girl.
Look, this is all a mistake. Just take it easy.
Watch it!
Fuck.
Fucking bull's-eye!
Come on, get in the car. Let's go. Come on.
You can't do anything for him now.
We killed him.
- We didn't do this. You did this!
- I saved your life.
We are in this together, John, like I said, whether you like it or not.
Tammy, where's your phone?
It's in my bag.
He's alive, but just barely!
So, what do you owe him?
- It's not in here! Where's her phone?
- How would I know?
Because you took it out of her bag when you were in the back seat!
- Now, where is it?
- You expect me to admit to that?
Hey, don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I'm warning you!
Really?
What should I mistake it for?
I really smashed him.
Like a stupid fucking cockroach.
Come on, let's go. Come on!
We gotta find a phone.
We got nine murders, and I don't even have a witness.
Somebody has to have seen something.
- Find me that somebody.
- Sir.
Found somebody.
John, turn here.
Hello? Is anyone home?
Fuck.
- Why don't you just kick it in?
- Just take it easy.
You're the one that said the guy needs an ambulance.
Hello? Look, there's been an emergency, a man's hurt very badly.
We need to use your phone.
Hello, is anyone home?
Hello?
Richie.
Is anybody home?
Look. It's half full. Help yourself.
It's called stealing.
It's called a drink.
Look, now, you do what you want.
I just want you to know,
I'm telling the police everything.
That's it.
Is there somebody home?
- Ma'am? Hello? Hello?
- Is this the police?
Look, there's been a terrible accident.
Sir, I would like for you to leave the premises right now.
Listen, we need an ambulance.
Highway 111, 20 miles east of town, there's a guy dying on the road.
We do have a squad car on the way.
- Sir, sir, please identify yourself.
- My name's John Felton.
I'm fine, but there's a man dying in the middle of 111.
Send an ambulance right...
Is anybody home?
Is anybody here?
Hello?
You're still here? Call the cops?
Is she okay?
She who?
There was a woman on the phone. All right?
I heard the woman on the phone.
I know there's somebody here.
Is she okay?
You know, I bet your place is a lot more tidy than this trap.
Maybe you could invite me over sometime.
Sure, why not? Yeah.
You know I would behave like a guest in your house.
Maybe I could come over for dinner when this is all over, and we can have a laugh.
Yeah, that sounds good.
"That sounds good, Richie.
Sure, yeah, come over."
- Look, don't talk down to me, John.
- I'm not. I'm not.
You'd better say what you mean and stop barking out a bunch of meaningless phrases.
I mean it. I do.
Okay, I mean it.
All right? It's okay.
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Good.
I'm gonna hold you to that.
No.
Listen, you'd be our guest. Okay?
Just please...
There's nothing you can do for her now.
You turned your back on things your whole life, John.
One more time won't kill you. Will it?
Listen, you told me that there was nobody in the house.
You knew better than that.
You gotta trust your own best instincts, John.
If you don't, you're not gonna make it.
It's up to you.
- It's okay.
- What's going on?
It's all right.
We're gonna get out of here, all right?
Stick with me, okay? Okay.
I have a shotgun! And I know how to use it.
Kid.
Don't do that!
Put it down, all right?
We're just trying to help.
Where's my grandma?
- She...
- Richie, don't.
- She ain't here.
- Back the fuck up!
She wanted me to tell you something.
- Richie.
- Something she wanted you to know.
You see that field over there?
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance to run.
But your grandma wanted me to tell you
I'm gonna be coming after you. Get.
Richie, please, just stop.
It's not a game any more.
- Please, just...
- What makes you think so?
Please, I'm just asking you, that's all.
I'm just asking.
Okay.
- I'm sorry, please just...
- John, let's go. He's not gonna hurt us.
You think not?
I'm not afraid of you.
You ought to be.
Jesus, Tammy. Tammy.
Jesus.
Tammy.
Tammy. Tammy.
I bet she does things your wife would never do.
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, what's your wife like, John?
If you don't tell me, I'll find out for myself.
She means everything to me.
Right.
But I'm sure there's times you'd like to kill her though, right?
No.
But I'd kill anybody that tried to hurt her.
I understand that.
Things that I hate most are things that resemble my own faults.
I hate bad manners.
I hate people that don't give common courtesy.
Hypocrites and cowards. That's all they are.
If you try anything, I will beat her till she bleeds brains out of her eyes.
You understand?
Why don't you just let us go, all right?
We won't say a word.
It'll be like it never happened.
But it is happening, John.
It's happening right now.
Stop trying to figure me out.
I got my own ideas.
Tammy, you gotta get up right now.
You gotta get out of here, okay?
He's gonna try and kill that cop.
I gotta save him. Come on.
Here. Just go wait for me on this field.
Look, you just gotta keep moving towards town, okay?
No, no, I don't want to leave you.
Look, you'll be faster without me, okay?
That's not what I mean.
Look, go, okay? Just go.
This used to be a nice neighbourhood.
Nice dog, still.
Rich folks been acting all crazy lately.
Like they ain't never been broke before.
So, what else have we got on this guy?
Mr fucking Rogers is what we've got.
Good job, wife, two kids.
Real estate agent.
Real family man.
Well, being a real family man doesn't automatically make you a nice guy.
Forty-three, I got another 28.
I guess not.
My name's John Felton. I'm fine, but there's a man dying in the middle of 111.
Send an ambulance right...
- Is that his voice?
- Y es.
Do you mind?
Absolutely.
If you were guessing, where do you think he's going?
Is there someone else he would turn to?
- Another woman?
- I apologise for asking.
I don't think so.
At least not any more.
Got a name? A phone number?
Sorry.
He left a bar with a young girl.
Brown hair. Busty.
Ring any bells?
If my husband was at a bar with some slut with huge tits, why would he call me collect from a pay phone?
To spread the good news?
Does he generally drink in the middle of the day?
No, not usually.
Sir, please be careful. Thank you.
Do you know someone who would have picked him up?
All our friends are gone.
Fired, relocated or just up and quit.
Tough times. People losing everything.
Holding on by their teeth.
And that's why John and I stand together to stay strong.
If nobody picked him up, why is his car still in the driveway?
Wallet, cell phone, keys left by the front door.
Glass of whisky broken on your kitchen floor?
You guys have an argument?
He was disappointed he didn't sell a house today.
He ever hurt you when he gets disappointed?
No.
You think he really killed those people?
Could have.
Do you need someplace to stay?
We have a beautiful home.
Do you think she's hiding something?
We could always look on the bright side.
She's ignorant?
People snap sometimes. No good reason.
You take your average, ordinary person and rob him of everything he cares about.
Then, people snap.
So, now, you want my help.
Well, well, well, right back where we started.
Except you look a little worse for wear, if you don't mind me saying.
I got this instinct, John.
There's just no denying it.
It's a God-given attribute, really.
I am always right when it comes to people who are trying to do me harm.
- I'm not trying to harm you.
- Well, if you are,
I just want you to know, you ain't seen nothing yet.
I know what you did.
I know you hurt those people.
The world hurts people, John.
I come in after the hurt.
All I do is kill people who are already dead.
Come on. Get up.
Get up.
And no funny stuff this time, see?
'Cause I'll fill you full of holes, pal.
Now, there's a roadblock up ahead.
You're gonna drive through it, just like you're one of them.
Get to driving.
Go back to the house. Talk to his wife.
What am I looking for exactly?
Just break her.
- This will never work.
- Course it will.
People like that just want to be fooled.
It's their nature.
Once you know that, you can take anything you want from them.
- People like what?
- The herd, John. The herd.
Turn the siren on.
There's a barricade.
Stick your hand out the window and wave.
Do it.
Big grin on. Big, silly grin.
Just a bunch of cowards hiding behind an army of badges and guns.
- It's not gonna work again.
- No, probably won't.
We're marked men.
We can't go on hiding forever.
- You ready to fight?
- I didn't do anything wrong.
I told you, John.
We're in this together, whether you like it or not.
This is it for me. I'm finished.
Stop the car. Stop the fucking car!
You think you're better than me, that it?
I'm the only person that hadn't given up on you, John.
Yeah?
That's why you got a gun pointed at my face?
Take it from me! Be a fucking man!
John, what is it you really want?
Is it that hard for you to say what you want?
Just say it.
I want you to leave me alone, okay?
Is that all?
- I want out of this car.
- All right.
- Get out.
- So you shoot me in the back?
I could have killed you 100 times over today.
If you want to believe the lie, then go on living your life.
The world is evil, John.
It's just plain evil.
That's the truth.
You done?
If you are.
How hard was that?
One more thing.
Remember you invited me to your house to meet your wife?
I'll tell Joanie you said hi.
How do you know my wife's name?
Hope she cooks good.
I do love a good home-cooked meal.
Stop!
John Jr.
Not now.
You sure you don't want to speak in private?
Is there some reason we should?
You know your husband got fired today?
No, I didn't.
But you do know he was having an affair?
I believe I said as much.
You're also aware you have a life insurance policy on him?
And he's got one on me, too.
Ma'am...
You ever want your husband gone?
Excuse Mommy for one second.
You think you can walk into my home and disrespect me and my family?
I will take you down so quick, your undies will be strung around your neck like a doily.
And if you think I'm going to suddenly burst into tears and tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets, well, then you're just lamebrained enough to think that you know anything about my family.
And God knows, from looking at you, you don't have a clue about what it means to be a good wife.
You're right. I don't know.
Don't placate me.
I will slap that smug look off your face before you can get your fat ass off my couch.
Now, I don't know how a functionally retarded person got a police badge, but unless you've come to arrest me, you can waddle out of here with the rest of the birds.
And make sure John gets home safe and sound.
And go ahead and grab a Girl Scout cookie on your way out.
They're fat free.
Just curious, why'd you let your daughter listen and cover your son's ears?
So she knows how to defend herself, and he remembers how to speak to a lady.
Well, shit.
Excuse me.
Give me a hand! I need help!
I need some help please!
Come on, please, I need some help!
They're gonna kill my wife!
Come on, I need some help!
Do you understand that?
Freeze!
On the ground, hurry.
Don't move, don't move.
You are wasting time.
How's that?
This guy is gonna kill my family.
Do you get that?
- Richie?
- Yeah.
The black man in a suit with a fedora?
Driving an old muscle car in the suburbs that no one else has seen?
Look, sir, you don't get it.
You've got to get somebody to my house and get my family out of there!
My deputy was just at your house.
Your wife doesn't want to leave.
Sir...
- She doesn't understand what's going on.
- Understand what?
This guy, he can kill anyone. Okay?
Then, why didn't he kill you?
I don't know.
He wants something from me, all right?
I don't know what.
He was pretending like he was my friend.
Pretending?
Look, I'll do whatever you want, all right?
Just get somebody to my house and get my family out.
- Tell the truth.
- Look, God...
I've been fucking telling you the truth!
I don't believe your truth.
Well, then, I should talk to somebody else,
'cause you don't know what the fuck's going on.
The witnesses all ID you and you alone.
He was following me.
Your house is being foreclosed.
Bank account's empty. Savings worthless.
You're past due on all your credit cards.
And you got fired from your job today.
What does that sound like to you?
Bad luck?
Sounds like motive to me.
I put myself in your shoes and, well, can't say it makes any sense, but sometimes a man just gives up.
Well, I have faith.
You're an unfortunate man.
Sir, do you honestly believe that I made this all up?
You think I killed all those people because I'm in debt and I lost my fucking job?
Look, just find Tammy.
Turn left.
Him.
Definitely the guy.
I do get paid for this, right?
Straight forward.
It's like they can see me there.
Are you sure they can't see me?
- Get him out of here.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, you did great.
She ripped you a new one.
You knew I was gonna get it handed to me?
I also knew you were gonna get something.
She's having an affair.
Contractor working on the house.
- Building a pool.
- Pool guy?
Got him shitting bricks in the holding cell.
- Anything smart come out of his mouth?
- Not a peep.
It's hard to tell what he's not guilty of.
Makes like a chicken. Then he clucks.
Keep on plucking.
You think he knew his wife was screwing the pool guy?
Too bad.
Looks like a nice enough guy.
We don't see much of your type here.
Go figure.
Cup of joe?
Hungry?
- Let me get the pork chops, please.
- Sure.
You want limas or fries with that?
I'd like both.
Hope you bread those chops nice.
Can I get extra gravy with that?
Yes, sir.
You got a problem?
You see this uniform?
Respect the uniform.
Or I'm gonna have to take something from you that I can't give back.
You understand?
You know what your partner wants?
On the house, of course.
Come here, sweetheart.
Come on, come closer. Come on.
Suspect has been shot, suspect has been shot.
I repeat, please send backup and paramedics immediately.
John! Oh, my God.
- Who is this?
- Tammy Strate.
- Tammy?
- Yes.
Are you okay?
She corroborated everything he said,
Richie and all.
You, come with me.
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- It's not him.
Everything he said, she backs it up.
Doesn't mean it's true, God damn it!
Local just reported three more murders, and he said he shot and killed the perp.
Positive ID?
"Tall, thin black man" was the description the officer gave on the radio.
Get over there now. I'll deal with this.
What is she doing here?
I'm just trying to help.
I think you've done enough for this family.
We brought your wife as you requested.
I'm sorry.
Go say hi to Daddy.
Richie was just reported shot and killed by an officer a few minutes ago.
Just to be safe, there will be police officers at your house for the next few days until we complete our investigation.
What, to keep an eye on me?
My men will be protecting your family.
Maybe he was right, what he said about you guys.
What's that?
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, ma'am.
You guys ready?
Sweetheart, come here.
That your doggie?
Show him to me.
Come closer.
Closer.
He a good dog?
He bites.
That's as good as anything, I guess.
They dump you out here all night, too?
No, no, I gotta go in and talk to the old bag.
You kids done?
Just stop, I'm gonna get you.
Come on. Why don't you guys go up?
Come on.
I'll come tuck you in.
Is everything okay?
You must be Joanie.
Yes, come in. You're getting wet.
And who is that?
These are our two children.
This is Sam, and this is John Jr.
Say hello to the nice officer.
- Boy's name for a girl?
- Yes.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Okay.
Come in.
Where's the local cop that called it in?
This guy's a real cop.
- How do you know?
- Come on.
It's not Richie.
Police Academy, class of 1968.
Lieutenant.
Our guys in front of the house are not picking up.
Scotch on the rocks, that's what John drinks, too. Here you go.
Guys, let's go. Bed. Come on.
Hey, your dad's a hero. How about that?
Again?
I didn't know you boys could drink on duty.
I won't tell if you don't.
You cooking something? Smells good.
Pork chops.
They're John's favourite.
I thought he might need a good meal.
John explain what happened?
No, no, but it's, you know, it's been all over the news, so...
Hey, maybe you can sell the story to the papers.
You know, people love a good tale like that.
I would hate to profit off of somebody else's tragedy, so...
That's why I'm here, actually.
You're making me nervous, Officer...
Stevens.
I should go check on the oven real quick.
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.
- Jesus Christ.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.
Get up there and check on them right now.
Get up there, do it!
What are you worried about, John?
I was just up there with them.
- Joanie!
- I tucked them in myself.
Little angels, and you got two of them.
You are so lucky.
- They're okay.
- Stay there.
Just so you know, the police are out there.
Do you understand that?
You still underestimate me after all we've been through.
Well, that's just plain dumb.
Question for you, John, is do you hate me more than you love your family?
In the time it takes you to go outside and get help,
I could destroy your whole family.
Listen, what is it that you want from us?
You invited me over for dinner, to meet your wife. I'm here.
Now, treat me like a guest.
You know
I'm not going to let you harm them.
You know that?
So, you're gonna have to kill me.
I told you, I don't make deals. I don't have to.
I'm giving you a choice, John.
That's more than I'm giving anyone else, including your wife and kids.
- I told you to stay upstairs.
- What the hell is going on?
How about those pork chops, Joanie?
I'm starving.
I'm afraid I don't care for your tone.
Makes two of us.
Get out of my house. Now.
John?
Tell this person to get out of our house and leave us alone, now.
John.
He's our guest, right?
Our guest.
We're gonna treat you that way.
Okay?
Again?
Help him.
Doesn't John do most of the cooking around here?
- He likes to cook.
- Good thing, too,
'cause this is cooked badly.
Poorly. It's cooked poorly.
Could you sharpen this for me?
It's kind of dull.
- The knife's sharp enough.
- Not mine.
You remember the first time you saw me today, John?
- At the front door?
- No. In your rearview mirror.
When I blasted by, you were sitting in the driveway twiddling your thumbs, thinking about your meaningless life.
You were talking to that guy who worked...
The guy who works on your house?
How do you think I know that?
'Cause you've been following me.
But why? Why would I follow you, John?
Come on. Put it together, John.
Put it together.
Why did I knock on your door today?
Perfect timing.
Joanie, get upstairs, get the kids and get out of here!
Or better yet, sit down and listen to what I have to say.
Now, John, why did I knock on your door today?
Joanie, you want to tell him?
Why I knocked on your door today?
Or why the back door was left wide open?
Or why you took the kids and left when he got home?
What is he talking about, John?
You both make me sick.
Sitting here like I'm the bad guy, like I did something wrong.
- Tell him why, bitch!
- I have never seen you in my life!
Yeah, that's true.
You did send someone else to meet me.
- What's he talking about?
- I have no idea.
She does not love you, John.
She's a liar.
She's fucking someone else, and she wants you dead!
- He's lying.
- She hired me to kill you.
I was supposed to drive you out in the sticks, throw your body in a ditch...
- Oh, my God.
- ...but I didn't.
Because I saw something in your eyes, John.
John, you can't believe this man.
You can't believe him.
She doesn't have the guts to kill you herself.
- He's lying, you can't believe...
- I am no liar!
- I have no idea what he's talking about.
- John, you can vouch for me there.
No, you are lying!
I tell it the way I see it, and I see it the way it is!
John, I love you.
That's right, kill her, John.
- John, I love you.
- Rip her fucking throat out!
Now, you got the instinct, just like me.
- Please don't do...
- Shut up!
Remember, she's cold-blooded.
Don't listen to her.
Don't listen to that bitch! Kill her!
- Kill that bitch!
- I love you!
Wait! Wait, stop! I'm not going to hurt you.
Just give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come here, you motherfucker!
- Put it...
- You motherfucker!
Get out of here! Go!
Careful.
Jesus!
They're out back!
Watch my children.
Mr Felton.
We're gonna take your wife in for more questioning.
On what evidence?
Your testimony, for starters.
Look...
I just told you what he said.
I didn't say I believed it.
What other explanation can you have?
She's my wife.
- What does he think he's doing?
- Something I never could.
Nice shot.
You know, smoking kills sperm cells.
- You hungry?
- Yeah.
Let's go get fat.
Everything's going to be okay, isn't it, John?
Good morning, Presage employees.<i/>
We hope you're all ready for our exciting team-building retreat.
Please enjoy your breakfast...
...and then make your way to the bus, which will leave shortly.
Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put breakfast together for the retreat?"...
...I meant, like, some stale doughnuts, some coffee.
But this is amazing.
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you see my sales report for last month.
Oh, I saw it last night.
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?
Not yet.
Look, you just need to make a decision, you know?
Are you gonna be "chef" or are you gonna be "sales guy"?
I'm saying that as your friend because, as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.
-As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
-Good.
[EVERCLEAR'S "l WILL BUY YOU
A NEW LIFE" PLAYING ON STEREO]
Inside my baby's room
Hold on, man, I'll be right back.
Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay
I moved in with--
[MUSIC STOPS]
SAM:
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.
Tell me that's a mistake.
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.
Uh, tell me what?
That I don't think it's such a good idea.
What, the trip? it's my brother's wedding.
What's going on here?
We should talk about this later.
Let's just--
What, pretend like I didn't see this for the next two days? No, let's talk about this.
It's not working out, Sam.
We're not working out.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?
-Not funny.
.-Oh--..
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.
So we're gonna be all business for the next two days.
Sorry.
I love you, but doesn't change the fact that you're still an intern.
[CANDICE SIGHS]
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.
Why?
For the naked team-building.
[LAUGHS]
[IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Hey, Olivia.
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.
-Hmm.
-I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.
Oh, well, you know...
...I'd rather be very Olivia.
We get a gig on Sunday.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Morning, Peter.
-Looking good.
-Uh, hi.
Olivia. Have you slept with every hipster in town yet?
Candice. Do you actually get paid for this internship...
...or does Daddy just increase your allowance?
You know, if you wanna get rid of that baby fat, you should try the gym.
They have these workout machines that you use on your back.
You're good at that.
Sweetie, it's not fat.
They' re called tits.
You're not lacking so hat there,
Mall-face.
Gee, thanks.
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever your boyfriend made?
I gotta tell you, he's a pre-- Uh-oh, that's what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?
-Just leave me alone, Isaac.
-Hey, Mall? Mall? Look at me.
If you ever need anyone to talk to...
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
...I've been told I'm a good listener by a lot of ladies. Shh, Wait.
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is--?
Hey, let's sit next to each other on the bus.
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.
-why?
-Doesn't matter.
Never matters. "I'm sorry, because l--"
[HORN HONKING] oh, sun.
Hey, Stan, how's it going?
Uh, it's Sam, sir.
Did you just correct me?
SAM [STAMMERS]:
No. look at me.
-What's my name?
-Dennis. look away.
All set, Pete?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.
What's the one thing we can't recycle, Pete?
Wasted time, sir.
Exactly. I wanna be on the road in 90 seconds.
Uh, well, I just saw his car, so I'll go track him down.
Way to show some initiative, Stan.
It's gonna be a good day.
SAM: Hey, guys.
MAN 1: Hey, man.
SAM:
What's up, bud?
MAN:
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?
ROY: You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.
Three weeks ago they brought you in as assistant plant manager...
-...and now you got a day off?
-It's not a day off. It's a re-- Re--
Re-- Re-what? Retarded?
It's a retreat.
It's a retreat.
NATHAN:
I don't wanna go. I'm just following orders.
-So if you don't like it, then you can--
ROY: I can what? What? I can what?
Nathan, hey. Come on, man, we're all waiting for you.
-Yeah, okay.
-Now, hold on. What you gonna say?
What you gonna say?
I got 15 years on you here. You got, what, four years in some classroom upstate?
Listen, if you think I'm gonna sit here--
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.
We're fine for the day.
Why do you let him get away with that?
No choice. He's the union rep.
I fire him and suddenly
I've get a factory full of Rays.
But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.
What about you?
When are they gonna offer you that permanent gig at the restaurant?
-They already did.
-Dude, that's great.
SAM:
I don't know, man.
I mean, they wanna send me to the flagship restaurant in Paris...
...for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.
Although new I'm not so sure.
Well, look, if you do go to Paris, do me a favor.
-What's that?
-Take Ray with you.
Aw, hell, no.

We all gotta get off.
What are you talking about?
-The bridge is gonna collapse.
-What?
-We're all gonna die.
-What the hell is going on?
We're all gonna die if we don't get off this bridge now!
Stan, relax, it's just some construction.
Molly, please. Please, God, follow me.
Open the door.
This is a major liability issue. If something happens to them, it's on us, you get that?
-Yeah.
-Then go get that.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right.
Hey, Sam? Molly?
SAM: Peter, please, just follow.
PETER: Come on!
Okay, everybody just calm down.
-I'm gonna go help.
-Please don't.
PETER:
Hey, guys, came on!
SAM:
Let's go!
PETER: Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.
Molly, Sam, came on, guys.
Did he seem weird to you when he get on the bus?
No, he was fine. it's like he just snapped.
-What's going on?
-What the hell is going on out here?
[CABLES SNAPPING]
DENNIS:
We should, uh ....
ISAAC:
Holy shit!
DENNIS:
Get off the bus!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
SAM:
Come on!
How did you know?
MAN:
That's the big question here.
How did you know?
It says right here in your statement:
"l saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen."
That sounds premeditated to me.
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I had a vision.
Okay. A vision.
Psychic phenomena, ghosts, Bigfoot.
You actually believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what I believe:
There's an answer for everything.
There's an answer for why you knew to warn everyone...
...the bridge was going to collapse, and minutes later, it did.
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.
I just did.
And no one else did?
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.
Did Sam have issues with authority?
Did he ever demonstrate any sort of extremist behavior?
No.
Wait. "Extremist behavior"?
You mean like a terrorist?
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?
Just his girlfriend.
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.
-But that was in person.
-Molly.
Ex.
BLOCK:
Tell me about the breakup.
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.
It's personal.
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just trying to get all the pieces of the puzzle together...
...before I start moving them around, making them fit.
Lack, I just had a hunch that something had was gonna happen. That's it.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Excuse me.
Forensics came back with the analysis.
-And?
-They're chalking it up to high winds...
...and structural damage from the construction.
"High winds"?
AGENT:
Yeah. Send everyone home.
You're free to go.
I have a feeling we'll be seeing each other again.
Call it a hunch.
WOMAN [ON TV]: Authorities are calling the North Bay Bridge collapse...
...a freak act of nature...
...citing a highway improvement project that may have weakened the superstructure.
Among the survivors were eight employees of Presage Paper...
...on their way to a business retreat.
The other 17 employees were killed in the collapse.
And although they've been branded the "lucky eight"...
...the surviving employees new face an uncertain future.
NATHAN:
Hey, guys.
MOLLY:
Hey.
PETER:
Hey.
Anybody know when this thing's supposed to start?
When Dennis gets here, I guess.
That agent still hounding you?
No. You heard the news, it was natural causes.
Yeah, more like supernatural.
How you holding up? I tried calling.
No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired.
ISAAC:
So?
How did you explain it?
I didn't.
I couldn't.
Sam, there had to be a reason.
Heh. That is exactly what the agent kept saying.
Whatever answer you're lacking for,
I don't have it.
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.
We should all just put it behind us and be grateful we're still alive.
Definitely beats the alternative, right?
DENNIS:
I look out at the faces today...
...and I see family members, friends.
But the people that left us on the bridge that day, they were more than that.
People like Jennifer Alcott...
...Chris Boylan...
...David Buckler.
Maybe you worked next to them.
Maybe you worked for them.
But we all worked with them, huh?
Who can forget Trevor Wino's smile?
Or Isaac Palmer.
Did he just say my name?
[OLIVIA SNORTS]
-That's not funny.
-I know, I'm sorry.
I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.
[WHISPERS]
I see dead people.
[OLIVIA LAUGHING]
Guys.
Death...
...doesn't like to be cheated.
Excuse me?
What's that supposed to mean?
You all just be careful now.
PETER:
Okay. Thanks for the advice!
Creepy guy.

The bourguignon is good.

You mind if I came in?

-Can l...?
-Oh.
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Thank you.
Listen ....
When everything started going down on that bridge...
...the only thing I thought about was you.
Getting you to safety.
You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.
You haven't done anything wrong.
Then, what? What is it?
Paris.
We talked about that.
I'm not going to uproot my life, leave you, for that jab.
But it's the only thing you've ever dreamed of.
Life is too short, Sam.
You have to go after what you love.
I am.
You should take the jab.
Go to Paris.
-Hey.
CANDICE: Hey.
What's the matter?
I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.
It's been really hard to concentrate after everything.
Yeah? Are you sure?
Yeah.
Because this is the last practice before the championship.
And it's your last practice of your college career.
CANDICE:
I know, but ....
I think you get this.
-Really?

I mean, you love it out there.
Okay. You're right.

You gotta hit that follow-up.

They're working on it.

Peter.
I came as soon as I heard.
She was doing great.
She was almost finished with her routine and then ....
Why did it happen?
This doesn't make any sense.
I don't know, man.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.
Let's just go, Sam.
Hey.
How's it going?
It's weird.
Being here, I mean.
It's just so quiet.
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls rerouted to corporate.
Yeah, well, it's depressing.
Holy crap. Did you guys get your bereavement pay yet?
Hey, what's he doing here?
I think he just needed the distraction.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.
Guess we all should have seen that coming.
What?
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.
MAN [OVER SPEAKERPHONE]:
Once you've handled the e-mail...
...you'll need to deactivate all the key cards of the deceased employees.
Instructions are in your binder.
Well, shouldn't that be the jab of the facility manager?
The facility manager's dead.

No, no, I get it.
Aw, Debbie.
You were so naughty.
[COINS JINGLING]

Ow.
Shit.
You shouldn't have, buddy.
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.
So, uh, who wants one?
Where'd you get these?
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. It's good, right? Ha, ha.
I get something better.
OLIVIA:
Ooh, nice one.
Yeah, count me in.
Are you sure you wanna share that?
If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone, which is just sad.
Well, this day just got way more fun.
No, I did call you.
Of course. I just called you right now, didn't I?
Because I really do wanna take you out again.
Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice romantic dinner.
You know, somewhere maybe outside the city.
Hold up.
You know what? I gotta go.
No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?
Amber, yes, that's what I said.
Excuse me.
Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi--?
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister tends to get a little chatty sometimes.
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.
So tell me about stress relief.
And what does this really get me?
This covers a session for two different physical therapies.
Like massage therapy?
Erotic massage?
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.
In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.
I'm just trying to clarify, though, that this professional experience ends, uh...
[WHISPERS]

I know exactly what you need.

No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.
Holy shit, you're strong.

To, uh, finding new jobs.
Because it's only a matter of time before they shut us down.
-Hear, hear.
-Oh. Tc starting over.
SAM:
Peter?
It just doesn't make sense.
She dies doing something that she's done...
...almost every day for the last 15 years of her life.
She said she didn't wanna do it.
She said she wasn't ready.
And I should have stopped her.
I should have done something.
I should've--
Peter, there wasn't anything you could've done.
How do you know?
[GLASS SHATTERS]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.
Yeah, Peter just freaked out about something, I don't know what.
Does that mean anything?
[OVER PHONE]
You told me to call if I saw anything odd.
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis, and call me if you see anything strange.
Stranger.
Should we maybe have code names for one another, do you think?
Over and out.
All right, ahem, show me how this happened.
I don't think I can.

What do you mean?
I mean, I could try it a hundred times and never re-create exactly what happened here.

Hey.
That's not very nice, you know.
Okay, your thumbs are kind of in my eyes.
I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.

Like, you're gonna have to start over.
Start over with me.
How many drinks have you had?
Enough. Molly, I'm serious.
Lack, you were right.
If I don't take the jab, I'll regret it.
But I'm not willing to lose you.
Why does it have to be one or the other?
I'm better when you're with me.
Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.
They're saying it was a freak accident.
Yeah, raise your hand if you believe that.
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.
PETER:
First Candice, new Isaac.
It can't be a coincidence.
It's not.
Where are you going?
NATHAN: it's that creepy dude.
SAM:
Why are you following us?
Who are you?
You were at the cemetery, then the gym, new here.
What are you doing?
My job.
[BLUDWORTH WHISTLING]
SAM:
What's happening to us?
What makes you think I know anything?
SAM:
You warned us.
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.
It's just that I've seen this before.
You've seen what?
A lucky few survive a disaster.
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.
You changed things on that bridge.
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.
So, what, we're doomed to die?
I mean, is that it?
We just get our lives back, so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?
Are you saying that we can't stop this?
You were supposed to die on that bridge.
You're not supposed to be here.
You shorted Death.
So you let Death have somebody else in your place...
...and then you take their spot in the realm of the living.
All the days and years that they have yet to live.
And they take your place in death.
Then the books are balanced.
Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get their life? Is that what you're telling me?
I don't make the rules.
I just clean up after the game is over.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.
They weren't supposed to survive, and new it's coming after the rest of us.
No.
No, not all of us.
Molly made it, she didn't die.
What?
Well, when I had that vision, or premonition, or whatever it was...
...I got you across before the bridge collapsed.
You survived.
You saved her?
Why, because you decided that she deserved to live more than the rest of us?
That's not what he's saying. I don't deserve to live more than anyone.
You deserve to live more than Candice.
Whoa, Peter, hang on.
NATHAN:
No, look, guys, came on.
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid, are you?
Killing people to survive Death's list. Really?
I may not know what's going on, but it's not what that guy's selling.
Yeah? What else is it, then?
Shit.
We need to tell Olivia.
Come on.
OLIVIA:
My farms are all signed.
MAN: I see that it's been quite a while since your first consultation.
What made you decide to take the leap today?
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life...
...and I just don't wanna miss anything...
...you know, important.
Same reason I had it done myself.
-Came on in back. Let's get you started.
-Okay.
Oh.
LEONOTTI: Yep, that's the first step.
You'll never need those again.
[OLIVIA CHUCKLES]
Here we are. Come on in.
What's with these?
Oh, just for some of our younger patients.
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.
[DRONING]
What was that?
Relax.
You know, it lacks a lot worse than it really is.
Okay, I'm gently going to position your head...
...and I want you to tell me...
...when this feels snug.
I can't move my head.
Perfect. Just what we want.
There we go.
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.
And you will feel a little numbness in your eye...
...which is a good thing.
Deep breath.
Relax.
Very good.

There.
That's not so bad, is it?
Looks good.
[CREAKING]

-Just relax, Olivia.
I'm just gonna enter some data into ....

What do you want from us?
I want you to tell me what you think is going on.
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.
Three? That's a pattern.
Now...
...I know you two didn't do this.
All right?
But I think you know something.
What is it?
We don't know anything.
Take a guess.
We think we weren't supposed to survive on that bridge.
What?
And new something is trying to set it right.
"Something"?
That's all you got?
SAM:
Right now, yeah.
But if you came up with any other explanations, let us know.
Thank you.
"Something"
Hey.
Been up long?
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about, in the premonition...
...we all get off the bus, but the ground gave way and Candice fell.
Then the bus tipped over.
And Isaac, he never get off the bus.
He went with it.
What are you getting at?
I know that there was just so much going on ....
Lack, I know that I helped you across.
Then I reached back for Olivia.
But she didn't make it. She fell.
So first was Candice.
[SCREAMS]
Then Isaac.
Then Olivia.
[SCREAMS]
They're dying in order.
Who dies after Olivia?
[SIGHS]
NATHAN [OVER PA]: Roy, would you come to the control room, please?
MAN: Uh-ch, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.
ROY: Okay, schoolboy, what do you wanna talk to me about?
NATHAN: What is with your timecard?
ROY: Let's talk about my timecard.
You cut my hours, which means you cut my pay!
I cut everyone's hours, okay?
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.
-My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
-Ray.
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent, so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
No, we gotta move, man.
ROY: Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
NATHAN: Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!
We gotta move now!
[ROY GRUNTS THEN SCREAMS]
NATHAN:
Roy! You okay down there?
-Hey, Dennis?
DENNIS: Hey.
They're closing us down.
They're shutting down the plant?
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.
Can you believe it? Us?
It's the factory guys that usually get laid off.
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.
Yeah, Dennis, we get bigger problems.
Olivia and Isaac are dead.
Who's Isaac?
Isaac Palmer, tech support.
Wasn't he dead already?
No, Dennis.
Listen, it's going to happen to us too if we don't do something about it.
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.
Anyone could be next.
It could be you. Understand?
Nobody's safe.
What are you talking about?
We weren't supposed to survive that bridge collapse.
And so new it's kill or be killed.
You get that, Dennis?
Whatever.
I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.
[DOOR CLOSES]
I will.
Hey, Agent Black, it's Dennis. Um--
Listen, Pete just came in here and he's just completely lost it.
He's yelling about "kill or be killed."
Oh, yeah, it definitely sounded like a threat.
What happened?
NATHAN: I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.
-Nathan. Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-We heard, and we thought--
-No. No, uh, I'm good.
Did you kill him?
What?
No. No, I just--
It was just timing, you know?
He get in the way and--
No, you did, didn't you?
You saw it coming, and then you tack his life. You put him in the way.
No, I didn't really do anything.
-Tell us the truth: Did you or didn't you?
-Hey, Peter, calm down.
Did you or didn't you?
Did you or didn't you?
Yes. I think I did.
I killed him.
So if the theory works, then you traded spots.
He should have your death, and you should have his years.
How do we know for sure?
I think there's an order to these deaths.
They mirror the order everyone died in on the bridge.
Then who would be next?
Who wants to be first to tell me what the hell happened?
Who is it, Sam?
Who's what?
[ALL GASPING]
Dennis! It was Dennis.
No shit.
MAN:
Jesus.
Why are you fighting me on this?
You're not seriously going to work, are you?
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.
If Death is gonna came for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.
You have to do something.
-What, kill someone so I can live?
-No, of course not.
We'll just have to figure something else out.
I have figured it out.
Something saved me on that bridge.
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.
Maybe.
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.
So if it happens tomorrow, or 50 years from now, whatever.
As long as we're together...
...I'll be okay.
Right? Why don't you came by after my shift...
...and I'll make you a nice late dinner, okay?
All right, give me this.

Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.
For some more than others.
Do you mind if I came in?
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, came in.
Here, have a seat.
Thanks.
Hey, Peter.
Hi, Molly.
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.
Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.
Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought--
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.
Uh ....
Still alive, I mean.
I'm next to go, right?
It's me and then you, isn't it?
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night, you know...
...thinking about if I could really do it.
-Do what?
-Take someone else's life.
If I could actually kill some stranger, replace their life with my own.
And I thought about it.
And I convinced myself that...
...yeah, I could.
So I went on a walk.
You know, nowhere in particular...
...but every couple of minutes, an opportunity would just present itself.
Heh. Like clockwork.
I could just grab somebody and pull them into an alley.
Or just shave somebody off a curb into traffic.
You know?
It'd be real easy.
Peter, what did you do?
-Did you...?
-No, I didn't.
I couldn't.
I realized that...
...I couldn't kill somebody that didn't deserve to die.
And I thought about Candice, and I thought, "Wait a minute.
Candice didn't deserve to die.
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.
I don't."
Do I?
No, of course you don't.
Well...
...none of us deserve to die, then why is it...
...that you deserve to live, Molly?
You said it yourself...
...you don't.

PETER:
Not done yet, Sam.
Where is she?
-Where is she?!
-I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.
You're gonna have to kill me first.
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.
Death's after you too.
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.
Just think for a minute, all right?
You are not a killer.
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.
I don't wanna die yet either.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Heh. it's not your time yet.
Don't worry, Molly...
...I didn't kill him.
But I didn't need to, Molly...
...because Death is gonna do that for me.
Doesn't mean I can't help it.
That's it.
-Are you okay? What's going on?
-it's Peter. He has a gun.
[GUNFIRE]
Oh, my God.
You killed him.
It's Sam's turn.
MOLLY:
Peter, just go.
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

BLUDWORTH:
You all just be careful now.
It's always the same dream
I'm wandering Naked
In this strange Maze of hallways
And I feel this creeping sense
Of impending doom
Like something terrible's
About to happen
I pass my roommate
My Mom
My best friend Stella
Basically every significant person in my life
And they're all just staring at me
Like I'm some kind of museum display
Behind glass
Then I see two people
I've never met before
A mysterious unearthly
Beautiful woman
And this red-haired girl
And they both seem to be
Leading me deeper into the corridor
This is when I noticed
A black door
And I'm not sure why
But somehow I know that I've gotta
Find out what's behind it
So I grabbed hold of the knob
Opened the door and discovered
A dumpster
I've had the same bizarre
Fucking dream
Every night since I moved into
The dorms last week
So now I'm wide awake
And, being 18 and perpetually horny
Anytime I have 5 idle minutes
My right hand automatically
Takes over
Like it's got a will of its own
Sorry
I'm just trying to be quiet
It's too hot to sleep anyway
How's the party?
Rad
I'm wasted
Nice
You should've come with us, dude
Everyone got crumped
Took their clothes off
Swam
The water was so warm
Mind if I sit?
Can I ask you something?
Sure
- You're like gay, right?
Uhhh, I'm more Undeclared
What's it like exactly?
I imagine it's different from
Being with a girl
It's way different
It's more...
Raw
Physical
I mean, cause you're intimately familiar
With plumbing,
There's less mystery and guesswork
Like,
You know exactly what to do...
And how it feels
Do you like, Kiss and stuff?
Of course
I've never...
Y'know,
Kissed another guy before
Well, it's pretty fucking awesome
My roommate...
Plough me
Plough me with your monstrous tool!
So, yeah
I have an excruciatingly
Hot, straight roommate
Wassup I'm Thor
Like the comic Yup!
And his name really is Thor
As in the superhero
God of Thunder
With the giant hammer
I sleep naked
I hope that doesn't weird you out
It's a perpetual torture
Plus of course he's a surfer,
Dumb as a box of rocks
AKA, exactly my type
I'm like really into Gran Turismo 5
And before that I was into SOCOM
And oh yeah!
Killzone!
I get with guys sometimes
Sexually I mean
And also, I like to surf
Do you surf, dude?
The guy sounds like a fucking asstard
My partner-in-crime
Stella
Stella and I first met way back in 9th Grade
I refuse to do this assignment
Cause you're
A sexist loser who has no fucking clue
What you're talking about
Are you sure it's not straight love Or in love with another oblivious boy fixation?
It's just that I'm not sure
How straight Thor really is
You said he was putting a load
In some pinhead stryer last night
Yeah, but doing it with women
Doesn't necessarily make him straight
Case in point
The fact that you randomly sometimes
Stick it in a girl does not mean anything
Beyond you
Need to monitor your drinking
Here we go
Now he's your typical straight guy, right?
When it comes to sloppiness, and manners
And scratching his balls
In public
Or like eating half a piece of pizza
On someone's coffee table
However, he also does
Stuff like that...
He wears deodorant every single day
And he exfoliates every night
Religiously, with one of those vibrating
Derma-brasion things
Plus, he's a little too
Into his own body
Like beyond a normal
Straight guy who works out
Admiring his self kinda way
Are we done?
No
I saved the weirdest thing for last
He wears flip flops like
Almost everyday, right?
Very hetero, very dude, choice
Except for the fact
He has a whole collection of them
Which he keeps in a color coordinated row
In his closet
Wow, except from putting a dick in your mouth
With Lady Gaga playing in the background
That's about as gay as it gets
See?
I told you
Smith, I'm kidding
It's all cute and fun
When you're 15
But we're legal adults now
In college
Anyway
I gotta get to class
Me too Where are you headed?
Imagination Theory
I'm beginning to wonder if being an Art major in a college of Creative Studies
Is a little too hippy dippy
Even for me
Hey, dudes!
The Messiah
Our pothead RA who is baked 24/7
What's goin' on?
We were just on our way to class
That's cool
I'd a really freaky dream last night
We'd love to hear all about it
But...
Both of you Were in it
And the whole world...
Blew up
In a horrible nuclear catastrophe
Great, thanks Messiah Goodbye
Majoring in Film Studies
Is something I wanted to do all my life
Eventhough it is a little anachronistic
Considering there is real doubt
As to whether cinema
As we know will even exist
Anymore in the next few years
It's kinda like devoting your life
To studying an animal
That's on the verge of extinction
Smith, college is just an intermission between high school and the rest of your life
It's 4 years of having sex
Making stupid mistakes
And experiencing stuffs
It's a pitstop
Not the second coming of the Messiah
Speaking of, it was sorta bizarre
What the Messiah was saying this morning
No kidding
What's that guy's deal?
He's gotta be like 30 at least
Yeah I've been having
Weird dreams lately too
What do you think it means?
It's a well-known fact that dreams are just
Your brain taking a dump at the end of the day
It don't mean anything
Hey dude
Let me guess
Thor Wassup?
Thor, this is my best friend Stella
Stella, Thor
Mind if I join?
Whatcha major in, Stella?
Art
Oh really?
Cool
Yeah Cool
Are you gay, or whatever too?
Or just like...
Normal?
Hey, Messiah
Smith!
Got something for you
What is it?
Someone slipped it
Under my door this morning
You Are The Chosen Son
What does it say?
"The Chosen Son?"
What the crap's that supposed to mean?
I have no idea
Oh, hey dude
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Trying to suck your own dick?
Bingo
I've been reading on the Internet
That if you do these
Flexibility exercises twice a day
You'll be able to give yourself
A blowjob in 3 weeks
I'll email you the link
That's ok
- You sure?
It's a useful skill to have, y'know?
In case you hit a dry spell...
You ever taste your own cum?
Not a whole load, mind you?
But y'know if you
Shoot really hard and some gets
In your mouth by accident
Mine's not bad actually
Kinda vanilla-ish
- Really, can we change the subject?
Oh, bro!
What's it with you and your friend?
Who, Stella?
Yeah, the uptight dyke
Yeah I know she can be a little aloof
When you first meet her, but she's actually
Super hot
In a bitter, edgy les kinda way
You think I have any shot
At hitting that?
I just threw up a little
In my mouth
I know
Hello I'm obsessed with you
And you're into my vagitarian best friend?
It's like I told you
That guy's a toad
I've met plants
With better personalities
And what do you make of him
Trying to blow himself... this afternoon
He likes having a sword swallowed
Not exactly a revelation
So anyways The party tonight
You're going
Lorelei, this hot girl from my
Emotion Painting class invited me
Lorelei?
As in legendary siren luring
Helpless sailors to their doom?
Yeah I know
She's gorgeous and I need a wingman
So you're drafted
So that you can hook up
And ditch me after 5 seconds?
Basically
Nice hat by the way
Are we in Paris?
Well, it's about time asshole
- I know
It's been awhile
I'm sorry, I've just been super busy
Don't worry bout it, hon
I work my ass off
Keeping a roof over your head
For the past 18 years
How's college life?
Oh, shit, sweetie
That's Australia on the other line
Can I ring you back in 15?
I'm going to a party with Stella I'll just call you later this weekend or something
Sure you will
There she is
Lorelei!
That's her?
I know Effing hot, right?
Smith, Lorelei...
Lorelei... this is Smith
Have we met before?
No
I'm sorry, I...
Anyway...
Shall we hit the bar?
Definitely
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah I'll be fine
Just a minute
Can you hold on?
Can you hurry it up in there
I'm gonna piss like a banshee
Hello, are you giving birth
To a marine in there or what?
Finally!
What happened to your shoe?
A drunk girl barfed on it
Nice hat
Yeah Same to you
London
Huh?
- I'm London
You don't expect me to shake that hand
Before you wash it
Sorry gay dude
Excuse me?
Well you are, right?
What?
Gay
I don't really believe in
Standardized sexual pejoratives
So you're bi?
- Not exactly
You do it with guys and girls, right?
Depending on which way your Peter points?
It's...
A little more...
Complicated
Life doesn't have to be so complicated
Neither does sex
Are you okay?
What was the question again?
Do you wanna fuck?
What?
- Do You Want To Fuck?
I just so happen to find queer guys hot
So my thing
Dude, keep it simple
You, me, intercourse
Yes, no?
What?!
I'll drive
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Maybe We should wait
Till we get back to your place
Why?
It's kinda dangerous
I mean I'm trying drive here
I live with danger
Me too
I'm gonna cum
Do it, do it
Just let me do it more
Did you cum too?
No, it's kinda hard for me
In that position
But it was really cool watching you
Wait You didn't cum?
Whatever, I'm good
What kinda guy are you?
If I didn't just have your dick inside of me I swear you didn't have one
I got this kinda weird thing
Where I'm really into making
Whoever I'm with, cum
Now that Really turns me on
I happen to take pride
In being scandalously great in bed
So if you think you're going
Home without cumming
Forget it
Ahh, feels so good!
Oh God...!
Wait
Don't cum yet
I want to show you something
What?
Just lay back, and relax
- Alright
Are you ready?
You're not even touching me But it's like I can feel your mouth on my...
Cool, huh?
How do you do that?
I have special talents
What do you mean?
That was so hot
I almost came again
Just watching you
Don't get any ideas OrgasMomatic

Sleepover breakfast thing

Help! They're coming!
They're coming to get me!
Please! We gotta get outta here!
Come on!
Wow Talking bout a bad trip
What kinda drugs were you on anyway?
That's just it I'm not sure
It was so vivid And real
I must have blacked out or something cause
When I woke up
I don't know how much later
The animal-masked men, the red-haired girl
They were nowhere to be found
Smith, you were hallucinating
I can't believe I let you drag me out of
A very sexy dyke's bed for this
That's the other thing, How do you explain me seeing Lorelei in a dream
Before I even met her
Could be because there's more Lorelei
Than meets the eye
What do you mean?
She's a witch
A... what?
She's a witch
Y'know...
Supernatural powers, casts spells
I know Pretty cool, huh?
Dude, we've been searching
All morning and found
No footprints, no blood, zilch
- I know
And now you wanna spend the rest of the day
Poring over the entire student population
In the campus directory?
You got something better to do?
Sucking a fart
Out of a dead seagull's ass?
Stella! Stella!
- I'm awake
100% awake
Come here
Are you sure that's her?
So what do we do now?
Start calling every O'Hara
In the phonebook I guess?
And...
Say what?
"Hi. I was tripping balls last night
And you were in my dream"
What are you doing here?
- I came to rescue you
Oh my God, Awesome
Smith...
Go ahead Bail
Hi, I was lookin' for a Madeleine
O'Hara... Is there...
Okay, sorry to bother you
Thank you
What are you doing?
Who is this?
The girl you fucked last night
Hi, sorry...
- I repeat, what are you doing?
I was kinda in the middle of something
Right now
I'm stressed about this exam

I was thinking
I could really use a good orgasm
Thanks
I needed that
What?
Nothing
I just, I just think you...
Cool
Yeah?
You're cool too
Now where are you going?
I told you
I have a massive test Monday
And I'm still here
So that's it
We both cum and you leave?
Pretty much Is there a problem?
Eventhough we just met
I feel...
This weirdly intense connection with you
I know Me too
Sure you can't stay
A little bit longer?
Is that you...
Or Smith junior talking?

She was always strung out
Totally fucked up
Last week she passed out in the middle of a lecture
And what happened?
Paramedics came and took her away

Vision of her getting murdered
By 3 guys in animal masks

What What are you talking about?
I felt that Lorelei
I know what you're doing, it's not...
Hello
- Smith, what are you doing?
Walking home from the library
Why?
What's wrong?
You gotta rescue me
It turns out Lorelei is a little bit crazy
Like a shithouse rat
I told you
There was something scary about her
Look I'm gonna make up
An excuse about you
Having some kinda crisis
That I'll meet you back at your place
Stella, what?
What's going on?
She walked on
Stella...
Stella are you in there?
I'm just peeing
What's taking so long?
I miss you
Be out in a sec
I gotta go...
- Wait, Stel
Shit
Shit!
Help!
Somebody help!
Smith?
What's wrong?
The door
It was stuck
Are you alright, man?
Yeah...
I'm fine
Who's there?
The Queen of fucking England
Who do you think?
Get in!
- What the...?
- Just come here quick
What?
- Look!
Yeah that's a beautiful parking lot Smith
They were just down there
Who?
What are you talking about?
The animal masks men
You mean the ones you hallucinated?
I'm not hallucinating now
I think that something really
Fucking freaky is going on
Oh, sorry Were you two...
Gross!
No
You must be Smith's new girlfriend
Huh?
- She's kidding
Madeleine O'Hara, the red-haired girl...
London says she was in her Sociology class
And then went missing about a week ago
Well that's why I came by
She may have turned up
What do you mean?
Is Oceanography, that building past
Madigan Hall
Way out on the west side of campus
Right by the lagoon?
I don't know What's going on?
It could just be a coincidence
But I was studying tonight
In the library
And there on the floor
I saw this...
Unidentified Headless Female Torso Found
In Oceanography Department Dumpster
Days passed
I searched the news religiously but There was no word on the body in the dumpster
I started to wonder
If maybe I really was losing my mind
To clear my head
I went to this nude beach
A few miles from campus
I've never been to
One before in my life
So one morning before class
I checked it out
I gotta say
It was a little nerve-wracking
But kinda liberating
Lying there with the sun, and the breeze
The smell of the ocean
All my worries
All the weird shit going on
Everything melted away
But then...
How's it goin'?
Mind if I join you?
Hunter
Smith
You come here often?
This is my first time
I didn't think I'd seen ya around
You in school?
Yeah. You?
- Fuck, no
I build and design hot tubs
Oh really?
Wait...
Do you like Do this a lot?
What do you mean?
This...
Oh, hey dude!
What's going on?
- Teaching this fag a lesson
Yeah, who's teaching who yeah fag?
Smith, this is my best bud Rex
Rex, Smith
Wassup, man
Well
I was just gonna grab a shower
Alright hey man, if you want it you should try
Some of that awesome new conditioner I just got
It's the one on my sofa
With the French name
Listen to yourself
You sound like a huge fucking fag!
Ok fag, that's it!
I'm kicking your giant homo ass!
Who's the fag now huh?
You, faggot fag steak!
What's that?
- Fag burger with a side of fag fries
Yeah...
I'm just gonna...
You meet some guy on the nude beach
And 5 minutes later, you're downloading his hard drive in the back of a van?
You're a slut
Really?
So did you dump Lorelei yet?
I'm trying to pull away
But she's not exactly making it easy
You're not inviting me in?
I'm kinda tired
And I have a super early class tomorrow
Is something wrong?
No, I'm just tired
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodnight?
Uhmmm...
Sure
Well, ummm...
Goodnight
I love you
Yeah...
Me too
I know I have to end it
But my experience with psychopaths
Like her
You have to ease away very gradually
The sooner the better
Before she pulls something really nutty
I told you nothing's wrong
I just gotta finish this project
You're not avoiding me Are you?
Of course not
If you're lying
That would make me very upset
I'm not lying babe
Look, I need to get back to work
I'll call you tomorrow, alright?
What time tomorrow?
After class
I'll be counting the minutes
Okay
- I love you
Me too
Goodnight
Hi, Smith
I hope you don't think
This is too creepy stalker of me
But I'm too much of a social retard to
Walk up and say Hi like a normal person
In case you're wondering
I got your e-mail from the
Explosions in the Sky's Facebook page
So at least
We have this much in common
Anyways I was wondering
If you maybe wanna get together
Have coffee or something
If not, then uh...
Have a great life I guess
Okay, I'm gonna stop now before
I chicken out and toss this in the trash
Yeah, I'm Oliver By the way
So I've been meaning to ask
The other day when I mentioned
The animal masks guys
You seemed kinda weirded out
It seems appropriate
It's a weird story
Is it your Mom?
How did...
Your face
My Mom's okay
She did the best she could
Raising me on her own...
Working full-time
What about your Dad?
He died in a car accident
When I was a baby
I'm sorry
I never knew him so it's kinda like
I don't even have a father
I don't see my Dad either
He was an alcoholic
Abandoned us when I was little
I guess we have more in common
Than we thought
What are you looking at now?
It's just my roommate's friend
Smith's got a crush!
I do not have a crush
You're hooked for him like you're Hooked for that shaved egg roommate of yours
When I walked in
They were both rolling around
On the floor
Wrestling in their underwear
Straight guys are gayer than gay guys
The fact that they're in love but can't
Suck each other's dick
Makes them queerer than Clay Aiken
What...
What are you doing?
I inviting him over
Chillax Just having some fun
Here he comes
Hey
Rex, this is my friend London
London, Rex
You look lonesome
Want some company?
Sure Thanks
We were just talking about sex
She's kidding
So Rex,
Have you ever heard of the Kinsey scale?
It's a rating system
For sexual orientation
0, being totally hetero
And 6, 100% gay
Smith here is probably a 3 or 4
While I'm like a 1.5
Why don't we talk about something else?
Kinsey discovered that only 5 to
10% of the population are at 6 or 0
What do you think your number is?
Zero I guess...?
Boring
You wanna fuck anyway?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Dude don't worry
I'll give you the 4-1-1 after
Okay
Excuse me?
Let's have sex
Just with you, though Right?
Yeah, that's it!
Oh don't stop
You're doing great!
Are you joking?
Sorry - I've had pelvic exams last longer than that
It's just...
You felt so good
What are you, 14?
Wow!
I'll be hard again in a few
And it lasts way longer
The second time around, I swear
Oh joy!
In the meantime
I'll eat your pussy or something
This just keeps getting
Better and better doesn't it?
C'mon Let me make it up to you
Yeah that's it, baby
I just want to make you feel good
What the hell's going on down there?
What do you think you're doing?
- Eating you out
Dude, it's a vagina not a bowl of spaghetti
I don't know
What your fucking problem is
But I've gone down on lots of girls
And never had any complaints
Maybe they're faking it to
Spare your fragile male ego?
Look, you want a few
Constructive pointers?
I don't need pointers
Trust, you so do
And you know what a clit is, right?
Yeah I know what a clit is
Think of it as a little girl dick
And treat it accordingly
Imagine what your dick likes
Kiss it, tease it with your tongue
Suck it, even nibble it a little
Just make sure you true-to-God
Treat it with the utmost care and respect
Which brings us to the number one
Golden rule of oral
Pay attention to how she's reacting
If she seems into something
Keep doing that same thing
Over and over and over
It's about finding the rhythm she likes
And sticking to it until the job is done
Got it
You want a practical?
So ready
Well, get busy son
Hey
- So we hooking up or what?
Excuse me?
I thought maybe you might wanna have sex so that You can do Rex via the transfer property
If A fucks B, and B fucks C
It's like A fucks C by default
As appealing as you make that sound
I'll pass
You're not curious?
About...
What Rex is like in bed
Oh hey
- Hey
I just came by to pick up some stuff
Is everything alright?
Yeah Totally
Well late
See ya
What was that about?
- I don't know, got me
What is it?
I set a Google Alert For any news of the dead girl in the dumpster
Did they finally identify her?
- Maybe
What?
It's gone
- What's gone?
The torso
Someone stole it
From the coroner's office
Today's the day
My 19th birthday
My morning starts out
Like any other
But very quickly
Weirdness takes over
And now what begins?
- The hell if I know
It's just freaking me out
Because the minute I woke up
I was overwhelmed by this vague sense
That some sort of
Major shift has occurred
Well I finally did break up with Lorelei this morning
Yeah How did that go?
Yikes Then what happened?
This isn't over Stella
You have no fucking idea
What you're getting yourself into
So are you worried?
Does Mel Gibson hate Jews?
Anyway, let's change the subject
Any word yet from what's-his-name?
Oswald?
- Oliver
No, I spent literally hours honing my reply of a masterpiece
That's definitely interested but
Not too desperate for this
How long's it been?
Three days
I know
So, don't forget
We're seeing Helen Stellar
Tonight over in Ocean City
That's right!
Fuck me!
Smith!
What happened?
Smith stepped into dog shit
And it's his birthday
Happy fucking birthday!
Could this day get any worse?
Hello?
- Smith?
Hi, who is this?
Hunter

Hunter From the beach?
Oh hi, sorry
I didn't recognize your voice

Just a second!
Hold on!
Hey!
Dude, you don't have to hide your porn

What do you mean?
Like you think the unmistakable sound of gay porn Doesn't penetrate these walls?
Alright, biatch
You made your point
So I gather your tawdry hook-up
At the beach was a bust?
His cell went just when
He was going down on me
It's my wife
You're married?

Chill pill I'm right here

The blindfold off?
Seriously, you've had enough fun for...
Happy birthday
So epic
I know, I'm not gonna

I must admit after a shaky start
This may be the best birthday ever
Smith?
I thought that was you
Hey It's Oliver
Well, I'm just...
Uh huh
I'll meet you back at the car
So...
I just wanted to say...
Eat shit and kill yourself
Wait, what the fuck is that?
You're pissed at me?
Just next time someone puts
Their balls on the line like that
At least be man enough to respond!
I did respond, I sent an email
That was so long
And overbaked I thought I scared you off
Dude, I'm already over it
You don't have to lie
I'm not lying, I did want to go out with you I still do
Are you fucking with me now?
No
Just let me take you to dinner
And I'll prove it

But that night I'm totally open
Me too
Cool
So It's a date
You aren't gonna...
Flake again, are ya?
I'm calling you No matter what
Even if the world ends
I better get back to my friends They're probably wondering what happened to me
Alright
See ya
So should I call him?
What?
Should I give Oliver a call, just to say
"Hi, it was nice running into you"
Good idea, let him know you're a need-ball freak Right off the bat
Really?
Smith, the universe is finally smiling on you And everything is going your way
Don't fuck it up
- Yeah right, okay
Can you pull over at the next stop
I haveta pee like a pregnant woman
Hello?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to
Are you alright?
Yeah
I was just dozed off
Do you remember me?
I think we've met before
At a party
I've never seen you before
In my life
You barfed on my shoe
And later that night
I saw three men
In animal masks...
I don't know what you're talking about
Are you sure?
Look I told you...
I don't know anything
Please I gotta go
Madeleine?
Madeleine O'Hara
What do you know
About the animal-masked men?
You gotta tell me
I had a twin sister
Named Rebecca
And when we were little...
Men in animal masks
Came and took her away
Dude, you already googled Rebecca O'Hara
On your BlackBerry
And got a million hits of nothing
Deal with it tomorrow
You're right. Let's just try to enjoy
Whatever's left of my birthday
So how does it feel to be 19?
Now what is it?
Nothing I'm just tired
So, any more crazy messages
From Lorelei?
Well, seems to have died down a little
So that's promising
Who knows
Maybe I was over-reacting
I mean I know how hell hath no fury and all
But could be, she's
Not as bonkers as we thought
Stella What's wrong?
I don't know, do you think
Maybe I'm being too much of a wimp?
Dude, you have a Fatal Attraction stalker
With supernatural powers
You've got every right to be creeped out
Yeah, okay Sold
I'm gonna give you the bed, lady
You want an Ambien?
- No
Thank you. After the day we've had Don't think
I'm gonna have any trouble falling asleep
Me neither, but I wanna be so knocked out I don't want how many more gnarly nightmares
So where's Board Knight?
He disappears sometimes
For a few days
I assume he's off somewhere
Burying his bone in some...
Smith c'mon That's not funny
Smith, I'm not kidding
Cut it out
Smith, what the fuck
You're freaking me out, stop it
It's not Smith
Smith, stop fucking around
Stella, I told you
It's not Smith
I warned you Stella
I warned you not to do this
Fuck you, Lorelei
This isn't real
This isn't really happening
- Oh it's happening alright
Believe me...
It's happening
I'm dreaming I must be dreaming
Wake up!
Wake up, c'mon...!
Wake up...!
Till Death Do Us Part
Lorelei!
I know you're out there!
Stop hiding and show your fucking face
You fucking coward!
Fuck you, you crazy bitch!
You hear me? Fuck you...
Fuck you!
Holy fucking shit!
Why are you...
I was up all night
I didn't sleep at all
Smith, what's going on?
I woke up
In the middle of the night...
And I found this IM
Telling me to go to this address
You ever heard of the New Order?
The seminal New Wave band from the 80s?
No Here, I'll show you
It's like this secret underground cult
What?
The address
It's not in my browser history
Are you sure you weren't just
Having some kinda sugar-induced nightmare?
Stella, I'm not making this up
It's gone, all of it
The site, the IMs
Stel, I'm not crazy
I was on this site
It had a list
Of all these ostracized members
Number 1 on the list was...
Her name was Rebecca Novak
Rebecca, as in the name of
The red-haired girl's twin
So why does she have a different
Last name?
I don't know
Maybe she was adopted or something
Anyway...
That Rebecca girl she had this whole litany of transgressions
Blasphemy, sedition, treason
And her penance
Was death
And there's something else
Even weirder
On the website, they had a photo
Of the cult's leader
Like their L. Ron Hubbard
The whole thing
The Supreme One
And he looked like...
My Dad
What the fuck are you talking about
Your Dad is dead
I found this in the trash
When I was little
I always kept it a secret
The guy on the website
That's him
I know it
Oh Milo...
It hurts so good
Tight session
You were really in the zone today
I had a lot of tension to work out
- I could tell
So is there anything else
I can do for you?
Well for starters
You can get out of those fucking clothes
Now what?
Oh I've got a few ideas
And they're absolutely Filthy
Oh oh Hold that
Hello?
- Mom?
Smith, I'm in the middle of a meeting
Can I call you right back?
It's kinda important
It's about Dad
What about him?
I just got a couple of questions
- Alright
He died when I was a baby, right?
Yeah, in a car accident
You know all this already, what's going on?
Mom, I just have to know
Is there anything you're not telling me?
No, there is not
This chapter of our life has been closed
For a long time
What was Dad's last name?
Did he go by any other aliases?
Smith, look
I'm hanging up now okay?
Stop asking questions about your father
For your own good
Mom, wait...
London?
My Dad's alive?
He got his PhD in psychology
His research focused on an obscure
Community of hippies
Devoted to this book...
An Ideal for Living
Your father spent years studying the techniques
That leaders use to control the group
In the early 90s, he took the cult head for himself
How do you know all this?
My father wasn't an alcoholic
He was in the cult too
Ever since I can remember
My Dad would disappear
Then one night
When I was around 10
We never saw him again
And what does all this
Have to do with me?
You're the first-born male child
Of the Supreme One
The Chosen Son
What about you?
Did you know who I was
All this time?
So that night we met
At the party
I was following you
But only because I was hoping
You might be able to lead me to my father
But our friendship,
Everything that's happened since then
None of that was planned
You believe me, don't you?
I'm not sure what I believe in anymore
Messiah!
The end...
The end is near
Hello?
So you're saying, her body just
Vanished into thin air
It was the freakiest fucking thing
One minute I'm checking her for a pulse...
She seems dead Cold as stone
So I run out to grab my cell to call 9-1-1
And by the time I got back
I swear it was like 10 seconds later
She's gone
I know it sounds nuttier
Than squirrel shit
Well, strange seems to be
The new normal lately
What about Messiah?
Did the doctors say
He was just tripping or what?
His pupils were like
Big black suns
They're running a bunch of tests
Smith?
Mom What is it, what's wrong?
I need you to drop whatever you're doing
And come home immediately
What...
What are you talking about?
I can't say anything more
They're probably listening to us
Right now
Who's listening?
Mom, are you in some kinda danger?
Maybe you should call the police
No, no police, they can't be trusted
They're part of it
Look, no more questions okay?
Just get in your car
And come home
Smith, I'm not kidding
Do it Now!
Smith, don't worry I'm sure your Mom
Will explain everything when we get there
I just can't stop thinking about
What the Messiah said
You mean all that
"End is Near" shit?
Stella, I have the exact same feeling
And it keeps getting progressively
More and more intense
Like...
What if this really
Is the beginning...
Of the end?
Hello
Smith, where are you?
Dude, me and Stella are driving
To L.A. for the night
Actually it's a family emergency
Is everything okay?
Hope so What's going on?
Well, I just called the hospital
The Messiah's gone
How could someone who's barely even conscious Just up and disappear?
Nobody knows what happened to him
That's not the only thing
What?
The results of his toxicology
Report came back
They discovered traces of dioxin in his bloodstream
Dioxin?
You mean,
Like that Russian spy dude?
Yeah The Messiah was poisoned
Are you sure
You're gonna be alright?
It's just I don't know how my Mom's gonna
React and it might be touchy feely family...
Don't worry about me
Just call or text whenever
The coast is clear
Thanks Stel
For everything
Smith, everything's gonna be fine
Mom?
Hello?
Smith, you alright?
Come on, let's get outta here!
Smith, hurry up!
What are you doing?
What is it?
London?
Smith, I was just about to call you
There's something really weird going on
What do you mean?
All the highest-ranking members of The
New Order seem to be heading out of town
It's a mass migration
We're heading back now
Listen
I have something major to tell you
I think my Mom's been kidnapped
What?
- She's missing and we found her Blackberry
And there's all this information on it
What kind of information?
A bunch of incriminating documents about
My Dad and the New Order
It's so much huger
Than just some sick little cult
It's like this whole secret society and
Infiltrating the media, government
Even the police are involved
But look, that's not all
My Dad had dozens of wives
Like he basically slept with
Anyone in the cult he wanted
As a result, he has all these
Illegitimate children
And he's your biological father
And you're my half-sister
London
London, are you still there?
I'm here Smith
Look, you just need to get back here
Soon...
London?
London, what's going on?
What's happening?
London...
London Open up!
Fuck!
This always works on my room
First The Messiah, then my Mom, now London
What's fucking next!
What are you gonna do?
We gotta get outta here, just pack some stuffs In a bag, I'll meet you in your room in like 5 minutes
- What?
- Stel, just do it!
Five minutes, hurry
And watch your back!
Mom, what happened
Who did this to you?
What are you waiting for?
We don't have all night
Blow me, fag
Who made you queen for the day?
Dudes, seriously
This is no time for dicking around
Smith?
Smith?
Messiah?
Jesus, you gave me a freakin' heart attack
Stella, there's no time to explain
Where is Smith?
I think he's been kidnapped
Fuck!
- Messiah, what the shit is going on?
Come with me
I'll explain on the way
On the way where?
What are you talking about?
Stella, we may already be too late
Just come on
Welcome back, dude
What is this?
Finally!
The Chosen Son awakes
Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is happening?
It's Day Zero
What the hell is Day Zero?
It's New Order codespeak
For the day the world ends
Dude I'm sure you heard it before But you gotta cut way back on your weed intake
As a matter of fact...
I've never touched that stuff
The stoner thing was just a front
I'm actually part of a covert group
Operation called The Resistance
And it's our mission, to wipe out
The New Order once and for all
Oliver?
So lemme get this straight
You guys are both ex-members
Of the New Order who are
Now like spies trying to destroy it?
In grossly simplified terms Yes
My girlfriend Rebecca
Is also in the movement
Rebecca Novak?
The red-haired girl
She's your girlfriend?
She was
Before she was murdered
The cult performs secret initiations
Involving underage girls
Who are either abducted or donated
By their fucked up parents
Rebecca was working undercover
Videotaping the rituals for the FBI
Smith saw that video
It was on the USB drive he said got stolen
We suspect Thor and Rex are responsible for that - Thor?
And Rex?
So all 3 of you have been
Spying on me this whole time?
Dude, you're the Chosen Son
We have to monitor and report
Your every move
Hers too
Where are you taking us now?
Go ahead, tell him
Tell me what?
We're taking you
To meet your father
Where are they Oliver?
Do you see them?
Yeah, I got them
They're heading east on I-10
You're some kinda witch too?
Like Lorelei?
The New Order tests all its members'
Offspring for the "gift"
A certain type of brain activity indicating a predisposition
For paranormal ability
Subjects displaying a high level
Of this marker
Are inducted into a program with
Intensive psychotropic treatment
To cultivate those skills
And that's what happened to you?
And Lorelei?
Some come out of the program
Severely damaged
With a laundry list
Of personality disorders
Others don't make it at all
Smith's gift is exceptionally strong
Smith has psychic powers too?
They're just dormant
Like seeds that haven't germinated
Now that he's turned 19
It looks like the Prophecy
Is coming true
What's the Prophecy?
It's based on a recurring dream
Of your father's
The Chosen Son will return to the fold
In its 19th year
And the world as we know it
Will be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust
You're shitting me
The New Order has warheads Strategically planted in every major city in the world
World War 3 can be started
With the push of a button
But won't they obliterate
Themselves in the process?
The cult has a massive underground lair
Called the Secret Sanctum
Specially designed to survive
A nuclear disaster
So after the great Apocalypse
The New Order will be all that's left
When the Prophecy transpires
You'll inherit the Kingdom
You're gonna be like
The Prince of the new fucking world
Well if that's true
Why am I tied up
Why do London and my Mom
Have their mouths taped?
Sorry, man
We're just following orders
Though I guess now that we're out
In the middle of nowhere
It's probably okay to let them get some air
What do you guys think?
Why not? But if either of them mouth off I reserve the right
To plug their face - whole
With my cock
Don't worry
I'll do it nice, and slow
So it won't hurt
Thanks, arse hat
No problemo
Grab her, fucking douche!
- I'm trying!
Look, is that them?
That van belongs to a Level 4
Night Assignment Smith
So, yes
Well then
What the Jesus are you waiting for?
Floor it!
Who's the girl now?
What the fuck's wrong

It is long overdue. As I said, I want the Seller house-
- But I'll fix it up a bit. Have you seen it?
I said to my daughter, we were up early to take advantage of day.
- I have water and blankets.

One realizes that the time passes when you see the kids.
You will then house the Seller?

Through it you come out slightly to the front.
Okay.

I said I would not go up here.
Why did I come here?

The case was terminated eight months later.
Laura was never found.

We are going on horse-

We go that route.

Would you like to swim?
Grandma has a canoe.
It is like a small boat.
Do you know what a canoe? Not?
It is a tiny boat.
We can sit three in it.
You, grandmother and me.
And also the doll.
Grandma would then like to see you-
- But she lives very far away.
We must go, go and go.
Over there ...

A lot of sunlight.
Out in the meadow.
Sticks it?
No!
Orcs do not have to go further?
Sofi, I love you so much.
There is a tree with a house in.
I played there as a child. I went there every day.
You may also play into it.
It lies near the lake.
Till memory of Alfredo Zorilla and Rodrigo Pardo Santayana

FRANCIS: 19 million, it's against you, sir.
20 million pounds.
20. Here's the bid at 20 million.
21 million.
Back in the aisle.
SIMON: There is a painting, it's by Rembrandt.
'Storm On The Sea Of Galilee', it's called...
...and he's in it.
Old Rembrandt, he's in the painting.
He's in there, right in the middle of the storm,
looking straight out at you.
But... you can't see him.
And the reason you can't see him
is because the painting has been stolen.
Lots of paintings have been stolen.
They're still missing.
'Pride Of Lions' showing here on my left.
Thank you.
I start the bidding here at a thousand guineas.
SIMON: It used to be anyone could steal a painting.
There was no need for a gun.
All it took was a bit of muscle and some nerve.
And that...
...was that.
But not anymore.
Those days are gone.
A business can't function taking big hits
like that.
So now we have procedures...
...and precautions and security measures.
Now we have a policy.
We have bag searches and magnetic alarms and silent scanners...
...and X-ray machines and cameras.
Also we have drills. And the first thing they tell us is...
Do not be a hero.
This is a robbery!
Now no piece of art is worth a human life.
SIMON: It's a sound piece of advice, that.
No piece of art is worth a human life.
But...
...in the event of an event...
...or situation we are to remove the most valuable item...
...or items and take them to a place of safety.
I.E., the fast-drop slot...
...in a time delay vault.
That's about all you can do really.
Come and enjoy the auction.
I mean, if you wanna let people in, if you want them to bid...
And when you're trying to flog the star
of the show for
25 million sterling...
you definitely want them to bid.
Sold to paddle 88.
Congratulations, madam.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...there will now be a brief interval.
When we reconvene, our head auctioneer, Francis Lemaitre...
...will lead the auction for
Goya's 'Witches In The Air'.
Thank you very much.
So we notify the cops about big ticket sales...
...and we even keep half a dozen
Ukrainian ex-naval commandos...
...in a van outside, just in case it all kicks off. Or so they say.
Simon, are you coming?
I'm about to start.
Uh...
Yeah.
Here we go.
So, what happens, of course, is that
just as we up our game, the villains up theirs.
They don't just turn up on spec anymore.
We have precautions, they have plans.
They do research, they do recces.
They learn about our cameras and scanners...
...and Ukrainian ex-naval commandos but some things don't change.
It still takes muscle and it still takes nerve.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Delancy's.
We are extremely honored to be selling
Francisco de Goya's wonderful work...
...of 'Witches In The Air'.
Goya, the father of modern art...
...and the first great painter of the human mind.
Let's start the bidding at 5 million pounds.
Thank you, sir. 5 million pounds.
An opening bid.
5 million, 500 thousand.
6 million.
In the center here at 10 million pounds.
11 million on the aisle.
12 million. 13 million.
17 million. Thank you, sir.
18 million.
19 million. Bad luck. 20?
21 million pounds.
Take your time.
22 million. Thank you.
Telephone bidder now. 26 million.
26 on the telephone.
27 to the lady on the aisle.
Small one?
Small one.
27 million,
500 thousand I'll take.
Last chance.
Hammer's coming down.
I'm selling for 27 million,
500 thousand pounds.
Sold. Paddle number 104.
Get down! Get down!
MAN: Gas. Gas!
Everybody out now!
Everybody get out the building now!
Come on!
Gas attack.
Gas attack, gas attack.
MAN: (OVER PA) Attention please.
Attention please.
Please evacuate the building.
Please do not use the elevators.
Make your way to the nearest emergency exit.
So when it happens, as one day it must...
...it is imperative not to panic.
Follow the drill and let the training kick in.
If circumstances allow...
...if, remember only if...
...in the event of an event...
...or situation...
...we are to remove, where possible,
the most valuable item or items...
...and take them to a place of safety.
Stop right there.
Step back.
Remember, do not be a hero.
Put it down.
No piece of art is worth a human life.
No, no, no...
Don't.
Fucking idiot!
Riz, let's go.
Afternoon, Sister.
And how are you feeling?
Um... Fine.
Been up?
Mmm-hmm.
Walking?
Yeah. Walking and everything.
You know who you are?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I think so.
How do you feel about going home?
Jolly good! Right, come on, troops, let's go.
Thanks.
Oh, fuck off!
Fuck's sake.
Hello?
Hey, Simon.
Franck wants to see you.
Where is it?
(SOBBING) I don't know.
I'm sorry, Franck.
You must have taken it. You must have put it somewhere.
Yeah, I must have.
I know I...
Well, did you or did you not?
I can't remember!
I got hit on the head!
That you remember?
Yeah, I got a big fucking scar on my head to remind me, don't I?
What did you expect?
You assaulted me. I had a shotgun.
Simon, the plan was simple.
All you needed to do was take the painting and bring it to me.
I know, I...
So, where is it?
I don't know, I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I'm sorry, I can't remember.
Franck!
Amnesia's bollocks. Everyone knows amnesia is bollocks.
No, it's not.
FRANCK: It's not going to work.
NATE: What do you mean?
FRANCK: He cannot remember.
NATE: How did you work that out?
FRANCK: Look at him. Any man who knew would have told you by now.
Hey. (WHISTLES)
You know what?
I ought to kill you.
Why don't you?
Finish the job and put me out of my misery.
And then...
...you can find your own fucking painting.
Riz.
Give him some food.
SURGEON: Well, his brain is intact on a gross level.
On a smaller scale, who's to say?
What I'm saying is we don't know.
The memories may come back, they may not.
All you can do is wait and see.
Isn't there something you can do?
For memory?
Nothing. Except time.
Some sort of medicine?
There's no drug therapy for amnesia.
What about other sorts of therapy?
FRANCK: Here.
Pick one.
(SIMON INHALES) Ow!
Hypnosis? (CHUCKLES)
He said it might work.
What am I gonna tell him? I stole a painting and now I've lost it?
You know, you make something up.
What if that doesn't work?
Doesn't work?
Simon...
Doesn't work?!
Okay, okay.
Um...
That one.
Why her? I don't know.
I like the name.
Right.
You walk across a wide open space.
Exactly the sort of place which might once have made you panic.
You are in Cape Canaveral and you are Head of Mission Control.
The rocket is ready to launch and although you are excited...
...you will not prematurely release the rocket.
And now you watch as the spider leaves its web...
...and crawls slowly across the floor towards you.
There is 30,000 feet of air between you and the ground...
...and the sound of those perfectly functioning jet engines...
...is making you feel calm because you know...
...that you are not hungry...
...and that these are feelings of stress and loneliness...
...and that you will see the ball cross the green and disappear into the hole.
SIMON: Um, okay, um, my name is not Simon Newton.
My name is David Maxwell.
Uh, I cannot find my car keys.
Please stop doing that. Stop hitting it.
Say your name.
Okay.
My name is David Maxwell.
Yeah, set.
Seriously, what if I say too much?
We wake you up.
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell?
SIMON: That's me. I'm sorry.
Something the matter?
Of course not.
I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
I'm... Mr. Maxwell.
Please.
Okay.
You've come to find your car keys?
SIMON: Yep.
ELIZABETH: 
They're just in here.
I wish.
Hang up your coat.
Have a seat.
Have you ever been hypnotized before?
No. Um...
No. No, at least not that I can remember.
I suppose you've spent some time trying to remember where you put these keys?
I've tried everything. I just keep coming up against a brick wall.
Of course. So...
...I don't want you to do the work today.
I want you... to sit back.
And I want you to close your eyes.
We're starting, right.
I want you to think about someone else.
Someone who could do it for you.
Another man.
Like you but not you.
I want you to focus on him.
Let him take over.
Is he there?
SIMON: Yes.
Is he under already?
ELIZABETH: Do you wanna give him a name?
Simon.
Simon Newton.
Get him out of there.
No, no.
ELIZABETH: Right, Simon.
Welcome to the session.
Thanks. It's really nice to be here.
Now I want you to relax, Simon.
I like your voice.
And now your mind is starting to think.
So think about those keys. And you now can feel them in your hand.
The shape. The metal.
And you can see the color.
Blue.
They are on a blue key-ring.
And your mind starts to think about the last time you remember them.
SIMON: I'm trying to walk...
...and they're in my pocket.
ELIZABETH: And I want you to picture them in your pocket...
...exactly as they were before you lifted them out...
...and you placed them somewhere.
A safe place...
...that, when the time is right,
you will be able to reach for them and they will be there.
Where did you say they were?
In the wardrobe.
ELIZABETH: What's in the wardrobe, Simon?
The...
I'm sorry about that.
Was I hypnotized?
No, you were just finding your car keys.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
DOMINIC: Let me fucking get in through there.
Really sorry. I kept thinking about the painting.
She just kept saying "keys".
Well, that's it, then, it can't be done.
She got his name in 30 seconds.
And she found the car keys.
Whatever is in his head, she can find.
What am I supposed to say, that I lost my keys again?
You're the clever boy.
You got us into this so now you think of something to get us out.
And you make it work.
CYCLIST: Hey! Fucking pedestrians!
Hey!
St. Pancras please.
You must think
I'm stalking you.
No, I just think you've put yourself under a lot of pressure.
To be honest, I'm not here to look for my keys.
I found them, thank you.
I'm looking for something a bit more...
...personal. And...
...I can't tell you what it is.
It's not porn.
I promise.
And I just really need to find this thing.
ELIZABETH: Hypnosis is the perfect tool.
I don't need to know what it is.
So I'd like you to close your eyes
and imagine you're in an elevator.
A wide elevator with velvet walls and thick carpets.
And as the doors close...
your eyelids become heavier.
And as your eyes become heavier
and the elevator begins to go down...
...you realize that this is the elevator of relaxation.
And now you're on the third floor going down...
...and you could get out but you want to go on...
...deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper into relaxation.
And you feel that perhaps you'll never want to get out.
It's so safe here.
So comfortable.
So relaxed.
I don't wanna talk to Simon anymore.
I wanna talk to the men who are listening.
The men who hurt him.
Oh, fuck.
FRANCK: You feel safe?
ELIZABETH: Safe?
FRANCK: Yes.
ELIZABETH: I don't think you'll hurt me.
FRANCK: You're right.
Absolutely.
FRANCK: It would be irrational.
And yet we are like that, aren't we?
All of us sometimes stupid.
Irrational.
It's fear, I think.
Fear of the unknown.
There are four of us but we are frightened of you.
You don't need to be.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Simon is an unusual subject.
He floats in and out of trance very easily.
But...
...he's got a lot on his mind.
Fear. Resentment. Anger.
Why do you think he did it?
Greed, most likely.
Does he strike you as greedy?
Everyone is... sooner or later.
Simon wanted the painting, that's it.
For himself?
Well, it's not like he did it for someone else.
Quite sure of that, are you?
Please don't.
So, can you do it?
Hypnotherapy will work.
But?
Only if it's a partnership.
Very well.
The finder's fee is 3%.
It's not enough.
See what I mean?
It's not about the money. I have to have equal status in the group...
...otherwise Simon won't respect me.
If you wanna make progress...
...you really have to move beyond getting one over on people, Franck.
ELIZABETH: Hypnotherapy is a means of altering unwanted or dysfunctional behavior.
The unwanted behavior in Simon's case is forgetting.
DOMINIC: You mean he's doing it deliberately?
ELIZABETH: Not in the sense that you mean, Dominic.
We keep secrets from lots of people, but most of all we keep them from ourselves.
And we call that forgetting.
Now, Simon...
...I'd like you to close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
I'd like you to think about being at home.
Home is a place where you feel secure.
In control.
You are feeling refreshed and positive.
And when the doorbell rings...
...you feel a rush of enthusiasm.
Hello?
Parcel for Simon Newton, please.
Er... coming.
Hey, Mr. Postman.
Thank you very much.
ELIZABETH: You are excited...
...but you stay calm...
...because you know that this is no ordinary package.
Inside this package...
...is the memory that you have been waiting for.
And you know that when you open it up you will find what you did that day...
...what you did with the painting.
And now...
...taking your time...
...you open it.
Now you're not going to rush...
...because it's a big step even to have got this far.
Slowly...
...so as not to upset the contents...
...you open it.
ELIZABETH: Franck. May I?
Yeah.
ELIZABETH: Are you okay?
SIMON: Fine.
How did you meet them?
Riz...
...I used to buy drugs from Riz.
That was it really. Well, the thing is, I needed money.
What for?
Gambling debt.
I was... I am...
...addicted...
...to gambling.
(SIGHS) I was really good at it, you know.
I wasn't quite good enough, though.
And not really good enough isn't really good at all.
Not at that level.
I tried to give it up. I tried everything I could to kick it.
I should have tried hypnotism.
You should.
Maybe next time?
Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do...
...I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping...
...that my luck would change.
And when that didn't happen...
...I panicked.
To various people...
...in various ways I am in for money I don't have.
Never will.
This painting came in.
This fucking painting.
FRANCIS: Are you a gambling man, Simon?
Because I'll wager you, anything you care to name...
...that I can flog this in the autumn sale for over 25 million.
Sterling.
SIMON: And I know it sounds ridiculous, an inside job,
but it just seemed like the answer.
I didn't know any criminals so I thought Riz might. He brought me here.
He introduced me to Franck.
Franck cleared my debt in return for the painting.
I owe him a lot of money.
And I don't know what I'm going to do.
ELIZABETH: He's afraid that once he's remembered, you'll kill him.
DOMINIC: That's ridiculous.
ELIZABETH: Is it?
Let's talk about killing. Have you ever killed anyone, Dominic?
No.
Well, yeah, in Iraq.
Loads, obviously.
But that's artillery, isn't it?
You never get to see exactly who you've...
Nate.
Killed anyone?
Define 'killed'.
(CHUCKLES) ELIZABETH: That's exactly why he won't open up.
His behavior isn't dysfunctional, it's entirely logical.
It's straightforward self-preservation.
Why do you think he cheated you in the first place?
So what do you suggest?
How do we make him feel more secure?
In an ideal world he'd kill you all.
That would do it, right?
Ideal.
ELIZABETH: Most likely.
Okay. But supposing, for the sake of argument, we don't go for that.
Then what?
He needs to see you weak and exposed to whatever it is you fear the most.
Nonsense.
Not gonna happen.
He needs to know that you're vulnerable.
If you're suggesting what I think...
I'm a professional.
I'm not going to put you on the stage.
The answer is definitely 'no'.
ELIZABETH: Now the next voice you hear... will be Simon's.
And he is going to say the word that I have prepared for you.
And when he speaks that word...
...you will descend into your very own world of fear...
...from which only he can bring you back.
Strawberry.
Simon.
ELIZABETH: Simon, say it!
SIMON: Strawberry.
That was incredible.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Why?
He doesn't know.
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
FRANCK: Shall I scrub your back?
How did you...?
Well, I used to...
...I used to, you know...
So...
...we got enough, I think, to make our boy feel secure.
Safe to remember, all that.
I think so.
Now we progress.
I like that, it's good.
Soon we'll have the painting.
And what about poor old Nate?
Does he still fall to pieces at every mention of the little berry?
No. Sustained post hypnotic suggestion is more difficult.
More difficult, but you can do it, right?
Not to everyone, of course.
5%? Correct me if I'm wrong.
5% of the population?
Yes. Can be described as extremely suggestible.
Wow, 5%.
Who'd have thought?
And what can you make them do?
Well, I'm just asking.
I'm interested.
All right.
Well, let's see, if you had the right person...
...if you get a hold of them, dig right in...
...if you get them under your spell...
...if you work hard
...and take your time...
...and do it right...
...you can make them want to do...
...almost...
...anything.
(CHANSON D'AMOUR
BY ART AND DOTTY TODD PLAYING)
ELIZABETH: There you are...
...in an open-top car...
...driving through the French countryside with a beautiful young woman.
And the radio plays some forgotten song...
...and the sun burns the back of your heads in the warm wind...
...and with every mile you travel...
...all your problems seem so far away and so long ago.
And soon a field of sunflowers gives way to a low building...
...of stone and tile.
The girl's dress, her calves...
...leads you through a corridor to a vast room of paintings.
Caravaggio's 'Adoration'.
Cezanne.
Vermeer's 'Concert'.
Van Gogh.
Modigliani.
Manet. Degas.
And Rembrandt himself.
'The Storm On
The Sea Of Galilee'.
ELIZABETH: These are the lost paintings...
...all the stolen and destroyed, but now together...
...authenticated, safe.
She takes your hand and leads you into a final room.
And it's in here...
...in this magical safe place...
...that you feel ready.
And you reach into the package...
...and you lift out your memory.
The memory of what happened that day.
The memory of what you did.
And now...
...safe and relaxed...
...you decide to watch.
You decide to remember.
...fifty thousand pounds.
Sold to paddle 88.
I remember that day.
I remember.
I take the painting.
I carry it in front of me.
And I cut the canvas free with a razor blade. (INDISTINCT)
I conceal the painting.
I carry on.
Remember...
...no piece of art is worth a human life.
Sound advice that.
And I try to remember it.
You see if you can.
I discard the razor blade.
We are to take the most valuable item, or items, to a place of safe...
Franck?!
Stay back.
Put it down.
Simon...
He's about to look.
I can't let him.
Don't.
From a safe distance...
...you see that you have been hit.
(MUFFLED) Simon?!
Simon!
But you continue to watch.
You continue to remember.
I still have it.
I wake up and I still have the painting.
I get up and I go outside.
There's a noise.
I have to walk away. I cannot stay here, not with this painting.
I feel my heart vibrating.
My phone vibrating.
I look at it.
The car nearly kills me.
She's in the car.
Who is?
You are!
Oh my God.
Are you all right?
Elizabeth?
I'm not Elizabeth.
Shall I call an ambulance?
I remember.
I remember everything.
Look, why don't I take you to hospital?
SIMON: Yeah.
Elizabeth?
Shall I help you with your seat belt?
Why did you lie to me?
What?
You made me forget.
He's got it on him.
Look, he's got it on him.
Okay, maybe I oughta just... call for that ambulance.
Open your jacket. Who called you?
I'm sorry. Will you let me go, please?
DOMINIC: Tell him where you left it!
(SOBBING) I don't want you to go.
Never mind her!
Forget about her!
Open his jacket!
What are you gonna do with the fucking painting?!
Just get him to tell us where he put it.
Tell us where you left it!
ELIZABETH: Simon, can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
ELIZABETH: Good.
Can you see the blue screen?
SIMON: Yes.
I'm going to show you some images...
...while we scan the response generated in your brain by each one.
The images will continue to run but you can override that
by thinking of a particular one.
And every 10 seconds the least chosen image
will be discarded until there is only one left.
However, every time you think of this one...
you will receive an electric shock.
And the more you select it the higher the voltage.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Hello.
I slept on the sofa.
I was worried about you.
I had this dream.
Wasn't a dream.
I am so...
...so, so sorry.
ELIZABETH: What is a person, Franck?
Not my line of work.
It's fine.
Being obsessed with someone is fine?
No.
But to have feelings...
...yes.
What we are...
...is the sum of everything we've ever said, done and felt...
...all wrapped up in one unique thread which is constantly being revised and remembered.
So to be yourself you have to constantly remember yourself.
It's a full-time job but that's how it works.
(GROANING) When you hit him on the head you broke the thread.
He's fixing it...
...with false memories, with fantasies.
There's a space to fill so...
...he fills it with me.
He's in love with you?
We call it transference.
I don't know what to say...
...now.
Okay. But where is the painting?
The same place it's always been.
Yes, but now you are the problem.
Yes.
But I may also be the solution.
When in doubt
...try something traditional.
Traditional?
Okay. Right, how's this?
How would you...
...like to, with me, go out somewhere?
What, you're gonna screw him, is that it?
You'll fuck him just to get him to remember?
It's not conventional practice, but under the circumstances...
Pick me up at 8.
Where would you like to go?
You choose.
I don't care.
Coffee's on.
Okay, but you wear a wire.
Don't be ridiculous.
SIMON: You can keep the rest.
Thanks, man.
FRANCK: I don't like the idea of you being alone with him.
ELIZABETH: I'm not wild about it myself, Franck.
So if you can see any other way to deal with this obsession...
...I'd love to hear it.
ELIZABETH: I'm glad I had you choose the place. It's nice.
It is. I haven't been here in a while.
Thank you very much.
So what do you recommend? I...
...usually have the steak, which is a lie.
I don't usually have the steak. I...
...I've never been here before.
Simon. You need therapy.
I've been feeling a little confused lately.
I just imagined
I'd been here before.
I could have sworn that
I'd met that waiter before.
And then what happens?
I give him what he wants...
...he's mine.
And after that, he gives me what I want...
...what we want.
Just like that?
He isn't really receiving electric shocks. (GROANING)
He only believes he is.
SIMON: Just here. If you just pull in here on the left, thank you.
This is, this is me, actually.
Okay?
It's all right.
Okay. Have a good night.
ELIZABETH: There's a problem.
He's jealous.
FRANCK: Jealous?
Of me? That's so cute.
And that's why he doesn't wanna sleep with you.
It's complicated but that's what he said. Yes.
I really wonder how he gets that.
Ask yourself.
Because now it's my fault?
I'm not assigning blame, Franck.
But you are always.
You can't do it because of this, because of that.
There is always something but it's never your fault, right?
"It's a partnership, Franck."
"He's got to respect me, Franck."
"We've gotta make him feel safe."
"We've gotta show him our fear."
"In an ideal world, Franck, he'd kill us all."
In an ideal world, Elizabeth, you'd go hypnotize the guy.
You'd bring me back the painting and you'd stop wasting my fucking time.
Wait.
Jesus!
Fucking hell.
Simon, it's Nate. We need to talk.
Come up.
(SANDMAN BY
KIRSTY MCGEE PLAYING)
Right before you close your eyes
Whispering your prayers
When the sandman blows your eyes
I'll be there
ELIZABETH: I must remember never to forget...
...that you're a criminal.
You got a boyfriend?
Now you ask?
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I'm single.
How is that possible?
I was in a relationship...
...he was violent...
...so now I'm not.
Got his address?
That's very kind...
...but 'no, thank you'.
You should get even.
Get a little angry.
To be angry is to be a victim.
I've moved on.
That's the only real victory.
So why are you doing this, then?
Because it makes a change.
If you had to deal with morbid obesity and...
...panic attacks...
...you'd see the attraction.
Can I tell you something?
I'd rather not.
Gather roses while you may
While the bloom is full
For the blossom soon will fade
And the bloom grows dull
Right before you close your eyes
Whispering your prayers
When the sandman blows your eyes
Who'll be there?
FRANCK: Hey.
Listen, I...
...I...
...can you...
Can you see me again?
It's not exactly what
I wanted to say, but...
I mean, you know...
Yeah. I think so.
Good.
Be careful.
ELIZABETH: And as the image grows closer and clearer...
...you find you are watching what he did to you.
You are watching the terrible things that he did.
But, with every blow...
...that you watch rain down upon you...
...you become only more determined than ever.
You know that it's possible...
...to change your life and move on.
That you will not let this define you.
You will not let yourself be violated by the memory...
...as you are violated by the act.
Simon?
This all part of your plan, yeah?
What are you talking about?
The two of you.
Planning it together. Gonna get it out of me and then dump me.
Simon, will you calm down, please.
How long have you been fucking Franck?
Where did that come from?
It's true, though, isn't it?
You know it isn't.
Why would Nate lie about something like that?
Because he wants Franck out.
He wants the painting for himself.
I don't fucking believe you!
Don't believe what? The existence of greed in human beings? Grow up!
For the past week, you've made every kind of excuse not to touch me...
...and now that the moment's come, you resort to some insane fantasy...
Wait.
Wait.
I know what you want.
There's something I have to do.
I tried to know when to leave
She sits in the bedroom and grieves
There's a sequence that starts all again
She can't get up anymore, with the pain
The combination of these drugs
Has left her hopeless and lost
She wants to count the ways
But she can't count again
And I Will be right here
Till all the pain
Just disappears
And I will always stay
How did you know?
You told me.
Close your eyes.
ELIZABETH: Simon.
Relax.
When the silver shines so hard
I tried to poison my life
Always dreaming of the edge of the knife
She always looked backwards
And I couldn't sit here...
You know where it is now? Maybe.
Told her yet?
You wanna talk?
Yeah, it's about time.
So...
...Simon...
...we're all here. Do you wanna talk us through it?
Yeah.
Good.
Yeah, I really do. I...
I'm sorry,
I just feel a bit nervous.
Come on, it's all right.
Okay. Do you mind if I use your...
Yeah, please, please...
I'll just be a minute.
(FRENCH FOOTBALL
COMMENTARY ON TV)
NATE: So how long's this gonna take?
FRANCK: It's all right.
I told him to wait.
NATE: He'll lie.
I bet you anything he lies.
DOMINIC: He'd better fucking not.
FRANCK: Don't worry, if it turns out he's lying, we just kill him.
NATE: Hang on, we're gonna kill him anyway, aren't we?
FRANCK: There's that.
RIZ: Shh!
Fuck!
Fuck.
Hello?
SIMON: It's me.
Simon?
Where are you?
I'm at Franck's house.
Jesus. What are you doing there?
Elizabeth, they're going to kill me.
No.
You were right. This is what they always planned to do.
Don't you see, this is why
I had to hide the painting.
Simon, calm down.
Where are you now?
In the hallway.
The doors are locked.
All the doors are locked.
Go upstairs to
Franck's bedroom.
There's a pool...
...and a hallway.
Do you see the bedside table?
Yes.
Open the drawer.
No, the lower one.
Is there a gun?
Yes.
Do you think you can use it?
I don't know.
I've never used one before.
Do you want me to call the police?
No, no...
No, it's better this way.
Elizabeth?
Yes?
I have something to tell you.
Are you ready?
I remember.
I remember where I put it.
You don't have to tell me.
No, no. I do.
I might never see you again.
I need to tell you where it is.
Tell me now.
It's in a red Alfa Romeo in the underground car park in Marble Arch.
I love you, Simon.
I love you, too.
Please, Simon.
Calm down, you've got it all wrong.
It's not what you think.
She's using you, Simon. She's using you like she used us.
She has been using you from the start, Simon.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
So where has she gone? Huh?
Don't let her get away.
Not after all this.
I know, Franck.
I know what you were going to do to me.
She put that there.
It's not real.
She's not coming back, Simon.
Once she gets it, she's gone!
If I wanted to kill you, why aren't you dead?
Because she loves me.
And I love her!
That's what she thinks of you.
It's my gun. It's empty.
She took it from my apartment.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
I got this.
So...
...who knows?
She does.
You leave her alone.
He found it the first time.
The first time he came to see me.
Remember?
You thought you'd just found your car keys.
(GRUNTS) But you were right, it's in there.
It's in the car. I took it to pieces.
It's not in there.
No, it's not in his car.
In the other car.
The red one.
NATE: Where is it?
Please, I can show you.
I can show you.
Get him dressed.
Go and get it.
And take him with you.
What is this? You're lucky you're still in, Franck.
Go and get it.
Bring it back here and we'll keep an eye on her. Promise.
Say something.
Allow the mushy shit.
Doesn't give up, does she?
Go and get it, boss.
Like he says, you're lucky you're still in.
Drink?
Yeah. Cheers, mate.
Franck.
You see what she gave to me, Franck.
That's what she thinks of me.
Oh my God!
Allow me, bruv, I didn't touch her.
Wait, wait.
Fuck!
You knew.
You...
NATE: Help me!
...you knew...
...what I would like...
...didn't you?
Help me. Help me.
Okay. Get down the stairs.
Get down the stairs!
No, no, no...
Please?
Please don't.
He can help us. Simon?
Please.
You go.
Okay.
ELIZABETH: It's really silly of me.
I've been out of the country. And...
...I'm such an idiot. Everything's a mess and I can't find the ticket...
...but I really need the car.
ATTENDANT: £1,848.
Not a mistake I'll make again.
Not here.
Franck knows a good place.
Don't you, Franck?
You can drive.
On you go.
You, too.
You sit in the back.
Tie your hand on to the wheel.
Tie it tight.
Tighter than that.
Here you go.
SIMON: I would like to know what happened.
It's all inside my head, isn't it?
There's something hidden...
...inside me.
What is it?
It's a memory.
A memory?
Suppressed?
Yeah.
Simon...
...maybe there are some things it's better never to remember.
FRANCK: Don't!
Franck, you're alive because I allow it, but I can change my mind.
I have free will.
Don't I?
Yeah, yeah.
Don't I?!
Yes.
All right, then.
All right, then, let's see if I do.
You take me to it.
So...
...it's a year and a half earlier.
You wanna stop gambling.
That's all.
All in.
ELIZABETH: You select a hypnotherapist at random.
And so you go to meet her.
Simon Newton.
Thank you very much.
ELIZABETH: Hello.
I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
Hello, there.
Nice to meet you.
Simon Newton. Hello.
Have a seat.
Thank you very much.
So... what would you like to talk about?
Now I have a moderate problem with online gambling.
I still have enough money to pay for dinner and things, though.
ELIZABETH: You get along well.
There is an immediate rapport.
And so treatment begins.
But your addiction is hard to crack
and repeated sessions are required.
Cheers. We should do this with alcohol.
ELIZABETH: You grow close to the therapist.
I miss you when I'm not here.
ELIZABETH: Too close.
And so you begin an affair.
A strongly sexual affair.
You stay there.
ELIZABETH: She knows that it's wrong.
She shouldn't do this, not with a client.
But she does.
SIMON: If you look at the Sistine Chapel, there's tons of flesh but there's no hair.
The hair serves to remind us of our biology. Our origin.
But without it there's a perfection, untainted.
Anyway, art moved on, as it must, it has to.
But, actually, no, it was Goya's fault.
'The Naked Maja'. After that, it's always there, the hair.
Yeah, that's the lady.
That's modern art.
No perfection anymore.
Hey.
Okay, I get it.
ELIZABETH: She will do anything for you.
You fall in love...
...with a kind of perfection.
The kind you like.
You're an elephant?
No, I'm not an elephant.
No, it's the Goya. It's 'The Witches In
The Air' that I was telling you about.
ELIZABETH: But then you become possessive.
Suspicious. Night and day...
...you fear that you will lose her.
It torments you.
And you become jealous.
Who are you texting?
ELIZABETH: Sorry, work.
You start to believe that you depend upon her.
That without her you will die.
You start to hate her as much as you love her.
And then one evening...
...after you've accused her of looking at another man...
You keep your mouth shut!
Why don't you just sit down. Don't they make a beautiful couple?
You can just look at him now.
Just feast your fucking eyes!
Elizabeth. No, I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
She knows she has to get out.
She has to break it off but you won't let her go.
You persist.
You apologize. You write long letters vowing never to do it again.
You weep, you call.
She is frightened.
I need to talk to you for 2 minutes.
Really frightened now.
Please let me come in.
And she knows if this goes on...
...there can be only one outcome.
Hi. How are you doing?
SIMON: I just need you to let me apologize and see that you accept that.
I need to see that in your eyes and then I'll leave you alone. I promise.
ELIZABETH: In the end...
...she knows that you will kill her.
Please, stop!
Simon, you're hurting me.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
The police are not interested.
Lawyers advise her to change her name, to leave the country...
...but she will not do this.
She will not be a victim twice over.
Instead, she will take control.
So she perverts the therapy...
you've insisted on continuing.
Simon...
...it's not the gambling that you want to forget.
It's me.
You want to forget me.
You made me forget?
She makes you want to forget.
You're forgetting me.
You're forgetting us.
And you feel so much more relaxed.
So much more free.
Leave.
And gradually... day by day...
...week by week you do.
You call less often.
The passions subside.
You're late for therapy.
Then one day you don't come at all.
At last you have suppressed the memory of me.
But you knew.
You knew I'd come back...
...one day.
ELIZABETH: Your memory is not destroyed.
It is locked in a cage.
And with enough...
...force...
...enough violence...
...the lock can be broken.
It comes back, the memory.
Not completely.
Not entirely, but enough to drive you...
...to make you feel you have been cheated.
Enough to make you angry.
Franck!
What did she look like?
You.
God, are you all right?
Elizabeth.
No, I'm not Elizabeth.
Shall I call for an ambulance?
I remember.
I remember everything.
Why don't I take you to hospital?
As the memory comes back...
Okay?
Shall I help you with your seat belt?
Why did you lie to me?
What?
You made me forget.
Okay, maybe I should just call for that ambulance.
Elizabeth!
Will you let go of me, please?
I don't want you to go.
I don't want you to go.
(WEEPING) And then...
Look, I'm sorry, whoever
Elizabeth is, she isn't me.
ELIZABETH: A few months later you came back.
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell?
That's...
...that's me.
Is something the matter?
Of course not.
I'm Elizabeth... Lamb.
You've come to find your car keys.
Well, they're just right in here.
Stop.
Can you give her the keys, Franck?
It's in the back.
Is it there, Elizabeth?
Elizabeth, is it there?!
(SOBBING) I'm sorry.
I don't want it.
I don't know that lever really did.
Maybe you can tell me sometime.
FRANCK: No!
No.
No, no, no...
Simon, you don't have to do this.
I want... to forget that you did all this.
No.
FRANCK: Please!
Bring it to me.
FRANCK: Stop, please!
(HERE IT COMES
BY EMELI SANDÉ PLAYING)
Are you okay?
No!
Hey!
Shall I tell you something?
I'd rather not.
There's a parcel for Le Pere.
Thank you.
Hello, Franck.
It looks good...
...don't you think?
Hanging on the wall.
I thought it might make me think too much of him, but...
...instead I think of you.
You want me to send it back, don't you?
Or sell it...
...and divide the money.
But...
...you know I can't do that.
Not when it means so much to me.
Not when I've worked so hard for it.
Simon, you're forgetting me.
You're forgetting us.
Even when you have forgotten the one you love...
...you will gamble...
...lie, cheat...
...and steal.
FRANCIS: Sold!
Steal for her a painting.
Simon, a painting...
...for the woman you hurt.
For the woman you left behind.
Now perhaps, some day, you'll find me.
I hope that you do.
But, if it's all too much...
...if you wish that we'd never met...
...that it had never happened...
...I can make it go away, Franck.
All you have to do is touch the screen.
Press right here...
...and follow my voice.
The choice is yours.
Do you want to remember... or...
...do you want to forget?

- What kind is it?
- I don't know.
White?
And the frame?
Dark. Postmark?
Same as last time.
And no note.
No.
I'm so sorry, Henrik.

Will you appeal?
What is this?
The media event of the year?
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.
Mikael, can we get a quote?
Mikael, will you appeal?
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.
Up until today, Mr.
Blomkvist was able to play the victim,
the brave journalist going up against the bad guy.
I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven.
When you call a guy a criminal...
If you want to say these things...
Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.
There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel.
... was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.
In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed,
Wennerström, founder and president of the Wennerström Group,
used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland
in an arms deal with the right-wing Ustaše in Croatia.
I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist,
who I don't believe is guided by malice.
But what he wrote was inaccurate.
And inaccuracies can't go unanswered.
All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us,
actions have consequences.
Blomkvist was ordered to pay
600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.
Can I get a packet of
Marlboro Red and a lighter?
Tsk. Yeah.
Where have you been?
Walking. Thinking.
Smoking? Yeah. Just one.
TV4 called.
I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
Well, I have. Anyone else?
Everyone who wants to see you humiliated.
Been on the phone all morning?
I'm as much to blame.
You are? You wrote it?
I read it. I ran it.
Not the same.
Our credibility isn't dead yet.
Mine is.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go home, crawl under the duvet for a week.
I'll call Greger, tell him I'm not coming home.
Thank you.
It's possible we could wait forever.
You called her and spoke to her?
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
No one here particularly likes her.
I find it's much better if she works from home.
But you told her I wanted to meet with her.
I've told her many times I prefer her not to meet clients.
- You like her?
- Very much.
She's one of the best investigators I have, as you saw from her report.
But? I'm concerned you won't like her.
Mm. She's different.
In what way?
In every way.
Miss Salander is here.
Lisbeth.
Mr. Dirch Frode.
How do you do?
Something wrong with the report?
No, it was quite thorough.
But I'm also interested in what's not in it.
There's nothing not in it.
Your opinion of him isn't.
I'm not paid to give my opinion.
So you don't have one?
He's clean, in my opinion.
You mean he's hygienic?
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.
Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today.
True. He made a fool of himself.
If it happened that way.
Are you suggesting that he was set up?
That was never part of my assignment.
But you're right.
He did make a fool of himself professionally.
How much of a fool did he make of himself financially?
The judgment will just about empty his savings.
Moment.
Your report is light in another area.
His personal life.
Anything you chose not to disclose?
Nothing that warranted inclusion.
Does that mean yes or no?
I think what Miss Salander means, and
I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated.
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him
I might find unsavory, even if she doesn't.
He's had a longstanding sexual relationship with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.
Not often enough, in my opinion.
No, you're right not to include that.
I know.
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.
She offered. He declined.
As she hoped. Never a good idea.
Mixing family and business.
I would've lost anyway.
It wasn't about Mikael.
It was about Wennerström sending a message to the press and the FSA, saying, "Don't ask questions."
Cheer up.
Dad.
Nilla, you don't have to worry about me.
Mom's worried. About me?
About the money.
Good evening.
Nilla? What are you doing?
Nothing.
Are you serious?
I don't wanna talk about it since I know you won't approve.
Of, um...?
Nilla. Light of Life.
Light of what?
Herr Blomkvist.
Yea h. Forgive me for intruding
on Christmas.
My name is Dirch Frode.
I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger.
Perhaps you've heard of him?
Yeah, of course I have.
He'd love to talk to you about a private matter.
This is an awkward moment.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to a Christmas dinner myself.
No, that's not exactly what I meant.
You're referring to your recent legal problems.
That has provided us with much amusement.
I'm sorry?
Herr Vanger has little love for Herr Wennerström either.
Have him call me.
But he would love to speak to you in person, if possible.
Up north.
In Hedestad.
That's not gonna be possible.
Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old to go to Stockholm. Please.
Be so kind as to consider.
Hedestad is lovely in the winter.
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed it's at home.
I'm sorry. What are you doing?
I'm writing a press release.
Saying?
You're taking over as publisher, you're very sorry for any nuisance Mr
. Wennerström was caused, and I can't be reached for comment.
Are you giving up?
Stepping aside.
This makes me sick.
- First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.
You said it would be lovely in the winter.
Well, this is unseasonable.
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
Unless we get snowed in.
I'm joking...
You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
Welcome.
Come inside.
It's warm.
How do you do?
So, what do you know about me?
You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country.
"Used to." That's correct.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Should I stay? No.
My grandfather forged the tracks that the 4:30 train will take you home on.
We stitched this country together.
We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.
And what do you think our most profitable product now is?
Fertilizer. Heh, heh.
I'm not obsessed by the declining health of the company.
But I am with the settling of accounts.
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.
I'm... Doing what?
Officially, assisting with my memoirs.
But what you'll really be doing is solving a mystery by doing what you do so well.
Your recent legal mishap notwithstanding.
You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet.
My family.
Would you like to sit?
I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
Did you make it?
Have you something for me?
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.
♪ Only one thing left to do I can hurt someone like you ♪
♪ Tear you out For all to see these lies N
No, thank you.
This is Harriet.
The granddaughter of my brother Richard.
Richard was a Nazi of the first order, joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.
Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"? Heh, heh.
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know. Okay.
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940.
Missed all the real excitement.
But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta, and their son, Gottfried.
Now, Gottfried,
Harriet's father, was what they used to call a good-time Charlie.
They still call them that.
Do they? Okay.
He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk.
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company, traveling around and taking clients out to dinner.
Well, somebody's gotta do it.
That's right.
Anyway, ahem, he died in 1965.
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty much useless as a parent before, became even more so after his death, which is when I began looking after the children.
Martin, who runs Vanger
Industries, now that I'm retired.
That's right, I Googled him.
And Harriet.
Ah. She was bright, curious, a winning combination in any person.
And beautiful. Yeah.
Something happened to her?
Someone in the family murdered Harriet, and for the past 40 years, has been trying to drive me insane.
It was
September 24th, 1966.
A Saturday.
Harriet was 16.
My brothers
and their wives and their children and grandchildren were all gathered here
for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner.
It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade.
Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it.
She returned a little after 2:00.
She came into the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.
I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important,
but I told her to give me a few minutes.
It was during those few minutes that something else occurred.
The accident had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet everything.
Heh. It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing.
Police, ambulance, fire brigade,
reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town
just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side.
The driver of the car, a man named Aronsson,
was pinned and severely injured.
We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands
since metal tools might spark.
It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen.
Anna herself saw her.
Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital.
Just as we from our side
slowly drifted back to the house.
The sun was down, the excitement over.
We sat down to dinner.
It was then that I noticed.
Harriet wasn't there.
And she wasn't there the next morning.
Or the next.
Or the next 40 years.
What was she going to tell me?
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?
And she couldn't have just run away?
No. Not without being seen.
The firemen stayed out all night
on the bridge pumping up gasoline.
No one swam across or took a boat.
All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday.
Believe me, I checked.
She couldn't have just fallen and drowned?
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.
Like her father.
His body didn't drift more than 10 meters when he drowned the year before.
Oh, no. Someone killed her.
Someone on the island that day.
Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday.
Those are from her.
And the rest, from her killer.
Who knows about these?
There's me, the police, the killer, and now you.
After the police investigation evaporated,
I kept at it, studying all the information there was.
I have spent half my life examining the events of a single day.
I understand your frustration, but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money.
But we haven't discussed your fee.
We don't need to.
Thank you.
I can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years.
You don't know that.
You have a very keen investigative mind.
Here's what I propose:
You come stay on the island.
I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use.
You study the material I send you.
You find something I've missed or you don't.
What you're asking me to do is set aside my life and career for...
Think of this as a well-deserved holiday.
A way of avoiding all those people that you might want to avoid right now.
As for compensation, I'll pay you double your salary for as many months as it takes.
Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
Herr Vanger...
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing, even though you're a terrible negotiator.
It's something you want more than anything else, and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.
Hans-Erik Wennerström.
He began his career working for me, and I have followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since.
You were right about him.
You just couldn't prove it.
We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir.
You fired me. I need something to do.
You fired you.
I need you here, not the North Pole.
Mikael, you know what this is going to look like.
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.
Wennerström wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag.
If it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him.
There is a problem between us.
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down.
You're leaving me to fight him alone.
It's four hours by train.
It's not the North Pole.
Hey, hey...
Network busy.
Please try again later.
Network busy.
Please try again later.
What?
Some milk?
Network busy.
Please try again later.
Oh, yeah. These as well.
You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
His ward.
He doesn't have a daughter.
Please.
He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging,
either from the fall itself or from a stroke that led to the fall.
His blood pressure is still high.
I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured.
And it's possible, even if he does,
that there will be neurological damage.
Oh, jeez.
Hi. I'm Gunnar.
The caretaker.
Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in. Okay.
You want to put it in there?
Okay.
You're an author.
Well, I'm doing a biography of Herr Vanger.
Oh.
I saw you on television.
That's unfortunate.
Bit of trouble, I guess.
No jail time though.
That's good. No.
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
There.
The entire island is owned by my family.
Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi, if you can believe.
Two in the family.
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely.
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.
He was there that day?
Indeed, he was.
His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there.
They don't speak.
Does anybody speak to anybody on this island?
Ha, ha. Actually, Isabella,
Harriet's mother, who lives there, she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her.
Right.
Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there.
Who doesn't he speak to?
You, probably.
But you wouldn't want him to.
He can be just as unpleasant as Harald.
Quickly losing track of who's who here.
Ho-ho-ho.
How you'll wish it were always so.
Soon you will know us all only too well, with my apologies.
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.
Who speaks to him?
I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.
Oh. Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.
Well, he lives over there.
And you live there. Sorry?
Your house.
Oh. Ha. Oh, yes.
Yes, you're right.
The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.
Her mother.
But what about the search?
Please.
Please. I beg you.
The fact that I never found a body was not surprising.
You can't dig up an entire island.
But neither could I find the motive.
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?
Did she know something someone wished she didn't?
Was it about business?
Business? Well, she was 16.
And very bright.
Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her running the company one day.
She was with some friends that day at a parade.
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.
But they also told me she kept secrets from them too.
The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated.
I have one. Oh, then you know.
I wanted to, uh, ahem, ask you about this.
She received that from
Henrik the Christmas before.
I've studied it more times than I can say.
I know every page of it.
It's the last page I was curious about.
As was I.
It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance.
All local phone numbers.
The first belonged to a woman, Margot, whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet.
The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died some years before.
The other three were not connected in any way that I could find.
I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry.
I can't forget.
It's my Rebecka case.
Uh, I don't know what that is.
Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over.
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.
Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case.
Taking out the files, studying them over and over.
We were young.
We laughed at him.
And that was also a missing-girl case?
No, no, no, that's not why I mention it.
I'm talking about the soul of a policeman.
Poor old Torstensson never solved it.
And he never let it go.
So how's Mr.
Palmgren doing?
I heard he had a stroke of some kind? Huh?
It's terrible.
Now, what exactly do you do at this security company?
Make coffee, sort mail.
But not full-time.
Not even part-time consistently.
They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August?
How much do you make there?
Enough.
How much is your rent?
I Pay my rent.
And when was the last time you were late?
Never.
You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive?
Here's the problem.
There's a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.
There's no discrepancy.
It was clear I could manage my own finances.
That is not clear to me.
I'm not a child.
You are not. But you were.
And between then and now, you were committed to the locked ward of St.
Stefan's where you continued to display violent aggression.
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes, arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics, again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face.
And it's not even that long ago.
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed, but when I'm looking at this, not to mention the way you're looking at me now,
I don't think you have.
So the good old Mr
. Palmgren days are over.
Starting now, you will be given a monthly allowance.
You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.
If the numbers don't balance, I assume the difference is going to drugs.
I've taken care of myself since I was 10.
The state has taken care of you.
Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important.
Since your behavior is elaborately documented in here, it will shock no one if
I chose an alternative to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.
Would you prefer institutionalization?
Yes.
I'm Liv. Oh, hi.
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.
Oh, good, thank you.
I found him at death's door, halfway up the hill.
I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
It's a climb for anyone.
- I should've warned you. Come in.
- Thank you, Martin.
Henrik says great things about you.
- Mmm. Martin? Smells wonderful.
- No. Leave your shoes on.
What are we drinking?
What a place.
Look at that view.
I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Göteborg.
When it was sold,
I went with it.
A dark day.
I live in Hong Kong, but come back to Stockholm for family events.
And I drive up to spend a couple of days with Martin.
It's just the moose steak she wants.
Who can blame her? It's wonderful.
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine, or you want to try something else?
No, no, it's fine.
You're writing a book now, Martin said.
Henrik's biography. I love Henrik.
He's fascinating.
Martin too.
Together they are the old Sweden and the new.
Yes, they are.
You know about Harriet, right?
You don't? Yes, I do.
The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug.
What can't? Harriet.
We can talk about it later.
Uh... We can talk about it now.
Liv knows everything about my crazy family.
That's why she'll never marry me.
That's one reason.
I don't want to read about that in the book.
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.
You know, everything changed after that.
Not just the family, but the company as well.
How so?
We're not Ericsson or Nordea.
But we're still the largest family-owned company in the country.
At our height we had
40,000 employees.
We have half of that now.
And that downward slide began after my sister's death.
It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit and his heart.
- Uh... You were here that day?
- I came in later, after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train.
I know it well. A terrible day.
And the days after, you know?
Searching, not finding.
Even worse.
This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book.
I got a call from social welfare.
I've been assigned a new guardian.
Hi. Hello.
I thought I'd come over and say hello.
I'm Cecilia. Oh, yes.
Please, come in.
Can I get you some coffee?
No, thank you.
We are all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.
Like I said.
It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
Unlike the one that landed you in court.
Unlike that one, yes.
So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet.
I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus.
Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here, which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?
I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my
Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
Since we're talking about her, since you brought her up, what was she like?
What was Harriet like?
I'm sure Henrik has told you.
He was my age back then.
He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager.
You were the same age.
My sister Anita was closer to her in age.
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.
I'd love to. Where is she?
If I had to guess, London.
You don't know where your sister lives?
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.
I'm getting used to that comment.
She hates this place more than I do.
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.
You couldn't pay her to send a
Christmas card, much less visit.
I'll track her down for you.
If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck oh'.
You're backed up, aren't you?
Hard drive at home, yeah.
Okay. That's good, because this one's done.
Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases?
And when was the last time that you were tested for HIV?
How many partners have you had in the last month?
And how many of those were men?
It's regulation, I have to ask these things.
It's a health matter.
Write what you want.
And why do you need such an expensive computer?
For work.
Making coffee, sorting mail.
I should have control of my money.
And you will.
Once you learn to be sociable, get along with people. Huh?
Can you do that?
Why don't we start with that now, huh?
Why don't we start with me?
You do something for me,
I do something for you.
That's what normal people do.
I want you to have that computer.
Feel that.
That's gabardine.
Unzip it.
And...
And...
I like the reticence.
It's almost convincing.
Anita Vanger.
Through there. Thank you.
Excuse me.
I probably should have made an appointment.
Mm, no, it's fine. Um...
Please have a seat. Thank you.
Mikael. Mikael. How do you do?
How do you do?
So you're looking for investment counseling?
Well, I would be if
I had any money.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik.
That's why I'm here.
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.
Actually, it's a lot more than that.
Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family.
Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid.
I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question.
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s, to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life.
Harriet.
Um, everything that I know about that,
I told to whatever his name was.
Morell.
My recollections were a lot better then.
I'm not really speaking about the event itself.
I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like.
She was very messed up.
Well, just like all us
Vanger kids, really, but...
Crazy mother.
Drunken father.
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.
Was he abusive? Mine?
No, hers.
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on.
Some days she'd be very withdrawn.
And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school.
And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun.
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?
She was obviously very unhappy.
What do you think happened to her?
Everyone knows what.
You don't have any thoughts about who or why?
All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her.
I got away when I was 18 and I never went back.
And she'd have done the same.
But she never made it to 18.
Mr. Bjurman, please.
It's Lisbeth Salander.
Hold for a moment, please.
Lisbeth, I haven't seen you Are you well?
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment, I had a lot of work.
Something the matter?
No, no, nothing to be concerned about.
Actually, I need another advance on my allowance.
Can I come to your office tonight?
I don't work at night, Lisbeth.
Why don't you come to my house, huh?
Do you have a pen?
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?
It's, uh...
Hello? It's me.
Lisbeth.
Come on in.
You like it? It's nice.
It's home.
What do you need money for this time?
Food.
How are you?
I'm so glad you decided to come and visit.
I just want my money.
Well, let's see if we can help you out with that.
Wait.
Is there a problem?
I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat?
You're so cute when you're surly.
I forgot to ask you:
You like anal sex?
Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.
Through faith we understand
that the world was created by the word of God.
I'll drive you home.
I can get home on my own.
Are you sure?
Is it any warmer inside? No.
I apologize if you've been having financial problems at the magazine during
Mikael's absence.
- We'll work through them.
- Are you sure?
How long do you think you can hang on?
Six months?
That sounds about right.
I used to be in the newspaper business.
We owned six dailies back in the '50s.
We still own one.
The Courier, here in town.
Which I let my nephew, Birger, run, because he can't run anything else.
So, what would you say to taking on a partner?
Well, we've never had to consider it before.
We value our independence very much.
Independence in publishing is dependent on advertisers.
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.
Excuse me. Did I miss something?
Talking about investing in the magazine.
I gathered that. But why?
Not out of greed, that's for sure.
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time.
But now I am convinced that this is the right thing to do. The moral thing.
That's one reason. And, um...
And...?
The enemies of my friends are my enemies.
How long have you been discussing this with them?
I haven't. They called yesterday and asked me to come up.
Why didn't you tell me?
You live in the woods.
I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
I wanted to hear what they had to say.
You would've said no before they could.
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.
You heard me tell them we had six months. I lied.
We will be out of business in three.
But you don't know this family like I do.
They're crazy.
We're not marrying into it.
If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing.
So you wanna say no, let's say no.
Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing.
What? Mikael?
I'm leaving this godforsaken island in the morning.
So? So are you coming to bed or not?
How much do one of those cost?
Around 3000.
This is really gonna hurt.
Your call.
Vanger Industries took a controlling interest in Millennium magazine,
which, according to analysts, has been in financial trouble...
Millennium is an excellent magazine
We think it's undervalued right now,
which is good business for us.
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerström?
I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission.
If Herr Wennerström would like to try it again,
he will find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.
I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
He's a titan and a gentleman.
But he's also quite old now,
which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar.
Three-twenty.
Shit.
The current archive is on CDs.
The older stuff, still negatives.
What general period are you interested in?
September, 1966.
Thank you.
Is this about Harriet Vanger?
You're too young to know about that.
Everyone here grows up knowing about her.
It's how we're taught about strangers.
Lisbeth. I need to pay my rent.
I need some money.
Oh, come on in.
I feel a bit badly how we left it last time.
Me too.
Good. You're alive.
You recognize this? I had it with me last time.
I set it here, remember?
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.
It's a wide-angle fiber-optics lens.
I thought it was going to be another blow job, which is disgusting enough.
But I misjudged just how sick you are.
Okay.
Here's what's going to happen.
Pay attention.
Look at me.
Once you can sit again, which could be a while, I admit, we're going to go to my bank and tell them that I alone have access to my money.
Nod. After that you will never contact me again.
Each month you will prepare a report of a meeting we will never have.
In it, you'll describe how well I'm doing.
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted.
If you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus.
Nod.
And if anything should happen to me, if I get run over by a car, if you run me over with a car, this will upload automatically.
Nod that you understand.
Ooh. Gabardine.
I'm taking the keys to this apartment because I'll be checking on you.
If I find a girl in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not...
No, not the video.
I'll kill you.
Do you doubt anything I've said?
Do you doubt what's in the reports that have followed me around all my life?
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.
They say I'm insane.
No, it's okay, you can nod because it's true.
I am insane.
Nod!
I know it's going to be hard for you to abide by my rules.
The abstinence part most of all.
So I'm going to make it easier for you.
Lie still.
I've never done this before.
And there will be blood.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
On my way to Skellefteå.
I can only stay a couple of hours.
What's in Skellefteå?
Bible camp.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not dangerous.
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.
Everybody needs something.
Just as long as it's not God.
I didn't say that.
I haven't been around enough to really know what's going on with you.
And I apologize for that.
But I'd never want you not to tell me something because you think I might not want to hear it.
That's what I'm doing.
It should've been me visiting you.
I'm sorry It's okay.
It was nice seeing you.
BYE-bye
I'll see you. Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, don't go too hard on the Catholics.
The what?
The article you're writing.
Oh, I'm not writing an article about Catholics.
The Bible quotes by your desk.
I love you.
A woman who is a medium or a sorcerer
shall be put to death by stoning.
If a dove is the sinner's offering,
the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings,
and burn it upon the altar.
Hello?
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.
Yes, hello. How are you?
Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope, for your sake.
You know that Rebecka case you mentioned.
Would you recall her last name?
Of course I do.
But what has that to do with anything?
Nothing, probably. Jacobsson.
Rebecka Jacobsson.
And how was she killed?
She was decapitated.
Her arms were cutoff and she was burned.
But all that happened in the 1940s.
What have you found?
I have to call you back.
Why..?
Is it Henrik?
Yeah, we were talking.
He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed.
Think he's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
You go. Talk to you later.
I'm sorry.
Evening.
So how is he?
Well, the good news is he survived.
How he does now, we'll have to see.
He's in intensive care. Right.
Oh, uh...
May I have one of those?
You want a sandwich?
Small Scotch. Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Um, I hate to be indelicate, but
Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this Yeah, Wennerström
I need to know what he has on him.
Now. In case, um...
In case he dies?
Well, that is indelicate.
And I apologize.
I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me.
And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so...
We also didn't discuss who I'd report to if something should happen to him.
Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course.
But we both know that nothing's going to come of this, don't we?
No. No, we don't know that.
What do you mean?
I may have found something.
You're joking.
What have you found?
The last time I reported on something without being absolutely sure,
I lost my life savings.
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?
Yes. Do you have one in mind?
I can find someone.
I know an excellent one.
She did the background check on you.
The what?
Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone without doing a background check.
I want to read that.
Herr Frode was kind enough to share your report with me.
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?
See, I can't find any record of her, and I'm pretty good at that.
Would it matter what her name is?
If I wanted to speak to her, yes.
It's against policy You sure?
Just like your sources.
You understand.
Okay. Ahem.
Here's a name for you.
My sister.
She's also my lawyer.
She'll be contacting you.
There are things in here that can only have come from one place.
The reason you can find no record of her is because her records are sealed.
She's a ward of the state.
What's that gotta do with anything?
She's had a rough life.
Can we please not make it any rougher?
Who is it?
It's Mikael Blomkvist.
Actually, I'm not really up yet.
May I come in?
Please?
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had some company.
Who do you think you are?
I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do.
Why don't you put some clothes on, get rid of your girlfriend.
We need to talk.
I'm sorry, you have to go.
Okay.
Do you need me to stay?
No.
Bye. Bye.
Bye.
Sorry. It's okay.
I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that.
If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you.
That won't be necessary.
Your report, very detailed.
But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
It wasn't meant to be.
When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader.
Wennerström wasn't entertained much.
Uh, your boss, Armansky, yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you, so I suppose I should be flattered.
You gonna sit down?
He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is, um, sensitive.
That's the word he used, "sensitive
." I'm gonna use "illegal," because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer.
No, I'm not gonna do anything about that.
I could, but I won't.
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story, and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further.
And if not, I'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again.
Here, you should eat that.
What kind of research?
Lisbeth...
Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?
I want you to help me catch a killer of women.
I've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea who the rest of these are or how they're connected to the death of a 16-year-old girl, but they must be somehow.
What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them, and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything.
What are you doing?
Getting started.
You can keep talking if you want.
Don't you need to look over these?
I got it.
Cat!
How'd you get in?
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.
Why would a lady like you want to know about an awful murder?
Does it? It interests me.
Her husband was the first suspect.
The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last.
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.
Then a vagrant.
Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies and you know you're never going to solve it.
How exactly was she killed?
Miss...? Salander.
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat?
I have a high metabolism.
I can't put on weight.
I'm asking because it is better to look at what I am about to show you on an empty stomach.
If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish.
He should lay his hand upon its head,
slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar,
and he shall be forgiven.
How is he? He needs surgery, but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide, should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not.
And they're not good at decisions.
So how was it with
Miss Salander?
She said yes. Do you think I might be able to see him?
He was asleep the last time
I looked, but let me check.
Thank you. Don't check.
Tell him to pack his things and leave.
Mother, please.
Don't use that tone with me.
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik.
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don't be an idiot, Birger.
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here.
Go back to Stockholm.
When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist, we know who to call.
All right. Thanks.
This way, miss.
If a woman approaches any beast
and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.
Their blood shall be upon them.
My family's impossible.
That's why the company's such a mess.
I apologize for my mother's behavior.
I'm used to it.
It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.
She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her...
Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her and left her excommunicated in the old house on the other side of the island.
She hasn't forgiven him.
You must stay.
You're the last chance Henrik has at some kind of resolution.
Put this to rest one way or another.
I'll keep my mother away.
But please, hurry.
Of course.
Lisbeth.
I'll get that. It's okay.
Martin Vanger. How do you do?
Fine.
It's a girlfriend, or...?
Assistant.
Oh. Thank you so much.
Good night. Good night.
Problems finding the place?
Everyone in town knows who and where you are.
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
I can make you a sandwich.
No.
I used to have a motorbike, a Triumph.
I know.
The five cases from
Harriet's list.
And five more she missed.
Three I'm sure of.
Rebecka was the first, just as you thought.
The second, M.H., is Mari
Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar, murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18.
Right. "if a man lies with a woman having her sickness," he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered
"the fountain of her blood."
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin.
Okay. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.
A cleaning woman and part-time palm reader.
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.
Leviticus 20:27.
"A woman who is a medium or sorceress shall be put to death by stoning."
I usually like to smoke outside.
Sara Witt, 1964.
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.
Raped. Charred in the fire that burned down her house.
Leviticus 21:9.
"The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with fire."
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.
The cow in the next stall had its throat slit.
Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it.
Leviticus 20:16.
"If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast.
Their blood is upon them."
Lea Persson, 1962.
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.
The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums.
There was a parakeet inside her.
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated...
Okay. I'm not finished.
We're looking for a serial murderer, but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island?
She was looking for him too.
Rape. Torture. Fire.
Animals. Religion.
Am I missing anything?
The names.
They're all Biblical.
The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary.
Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament.
Which means they're all Jewish.
One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.
There's one right there.
I can sleep on a couch.
Okay.
Um... Right. Ahem.
Oh, yeah, there might be a cat somewhere.
Good night. Night.
Harriet's name isn't.
Isn't what?
Jewish. No.
What are you doing?
Reading your notes.
They're encrypted.
Please. Have some coffee.
Okay.
Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation about what's yours and what's mine.
Ahem.
It's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos.
Thank you.
It's too bad you don't have hers.
Whose?
Her.
Can I...? Sorry.
Yeah, all right.
Close that.
No. Not that.
That's the one. Yep.
Where the fuck is that? That's down there, isn't it?
Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.
And...
What does that say there?
"N" something "R-S-J."
That's "Norsjö," yeah.
Then something
"K Something "R-I-F."
"Carpentry."
Well, we need to find a carpenter.
Fuck!
The carpentry shop is gone.
I don't even know if he worked there or not, but if he did, maybe he used to come in here for hardware.
I don't recognize him. Sorry.
Well, I had to start somewhere.
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would have started at a retirement home.
This is Brännlund's kid.
Do you know where I might find him?
The son?
Next to his father at the cemetery.
He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago.
But, uh... she might still be alive.
His widow.
Do you know where
I might find her?
Please drive to highlighted route.
In 1966, you were in
Hedestad with your husband.
Oh! Who took these?
A local photographer.
You were taking pictures too that day, and I'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them.
It wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.
But Why?
This girl here. Here, you can see her better in the enlargement.
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken, after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered.
How awful.
There you are. Thank you.
Would you mind if I made a copy of this?
No.
I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky. So call him.
Next time, fill out the proper paperwork.
Which one are you?
Going down.
How's your sex life?
I didn't care much for your last report.
It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it.
Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's.
Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice, just nod.
Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me.
And stop visiting tattoo-removal websites.
Or I'll do it again... right here.
Ow, ow, ow.
Is that dental floss? Yes.
Oh.
You're gonna sterilize that, right?
Couldn't we just use tape or something?
No.
What?
Thank you. Jesus! Ow!
Drink. Okay.
Just be careful. It's my eye.
Don't move. You're not a doctor.
Take off your wet clothes. What?
Yeah. Thank you.
Yeah, I think it has stopped bleeding.
It still fucking hurts, though.
Madness.
I mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.
Whew. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.
Ow. Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.
This is insane.
I mean, these people...
Somebody was shooting at me.
I mean, it wasn't an accident.
No one's shooting at you now.
You know, I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea.
Why?
I'm old and we work together...
You work with what's-her-name and that's worked out for you.
Yeah, well, I do have some standards, believe it or not.
You need to stop talking.
Uh... Oh, shit.
Do you want me to open the window?
I like working with you.
I like working with you too.
It could have been a stray shot.
Not by Gunnar.
If he wanted to shoot him, he wouldn't be here.
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.
Or he's right, Dirch.
What if he is?
This has to stop.
Do you want to stop, Mikael?
Look, I have police reports, photos,
Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.
What I don't have is Vanger Industries' records.
That's what I want.
Why? Will you authorize it?
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?
Henrik said I could have access to everything.
This is what I need.
That's not what he meant.
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.
Just a minute.
I think Henrik would say yes.
That's why he has me, to protect him from himself. It's insane.
What have we got to hide?
After 120 years of business, probably a lot.
If this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission.
What am I looking for?
Any connections between
Vanger Industries and the towns where the women were killed.
And everything about Frode.
Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen.
I'd like to take a look at them.
So ask him.
I was wondering if you could do that.
I don't speak to him.
Could you make an exception in my case?
Are you afraid to be in the same room with him?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.
So you won't help me?
Sorry.
Please?
Are you finished?
I need to know where all factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966.
You already have everything.
No, I don't.
Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships or suppliers.
You'll have to do without.
Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need.
I need this You have access to this floor.
Call him.
Thank you for seeing me.
Come in.
Tea? Please.
Sven Olov Lindholm.
Me.
Handsome.
Birger Furugård.
Me.
Per Engdahl.
But your interest is in my more candid photographic work.
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.
Please.
"Blom" or "Bloom"?
Blomkvist.
I'm not a recluse.
I don't close my door to anybody.
Thank you.
They just don't visit.
Well... perhaps if you redecorated.
Hide the past like they do?
Under a thin, shiny veneer?
Like an IKEA table?
I am the most honest of all of them.
The family? Sweden.
Landscape?
Some nice landscapes there?
Who is this?
The blurry one.
I can't tell.
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.
That's Martin. Yeah.
Handsome but useless young man, like his father.
Like his father.
We're closing.
Nowhere near finished.
I'm not authorized to stay late.
I am.
And I need access to everything, including anything that's locked.
Call Frode.
Leave the keys with the guard.
Come on.
Shit!
Martin?
Mikael.
Hi there.
Your evening stroll?
Yes, that's right, I...
How are you? Good.
I stopped by the hospital on my way home.
Henrik asked me to ask you something.
What was that?
Come on in.
I'll make you a drink.
Hello, Martin.
Shut the door. It's quite windy.
What happened to you? When?
Just now.
I, heh, fell in the dark.
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.
How's the investigation going?
Nothing new to report. No?
Dirch says the girl is really clever.
Maybe she'll turn something up.
Maybe.
Thank you for that.
What? So, What did he say?
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.
Well, I just did. What?
How's the investigation?
Oh, yeah.
That was his question.
Do you hunt?
We should go hunting together sometime.
Sure.
Nothing at all new to report?
No. Nothing.
I can see you're anxious. No.
No, I mean to get home after the walk.
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.
To have dinner with your girlfriend.
Assistant.
We'll have better luck with a gun.
I'm sorry? When we go hunting.
A gun. Rather than a knife.
I want to show you something.
Bring your drink.
Leave my knife.
To the right.
Hi, leave a message.
I'll call...
You know what's harder than shooting someone?
Just missing him.
That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
It didn't work. I'm here.
Mikael, it did work.
You're here.
Inside.
Spilled your drink.
Why didn't you just go home?
May I? Heh.
How did you do it?
What did you find?
We can talk or we can just get on with it.
I found a photograph no one has seen.
Of? You.
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.
What does that prove?
You lied about where you were that day.
Did I? Or rather, when.
So what?
People lie all the time.
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.
Lena.
That was a long time ago.
Where's this photo now?
Is it with all the other crap on your desk?
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy on a secure website.
Secure website. Ha-ha-ha.
That's a lie.
How much does the girl know?
I hope it's as much as you do.
That'll make it fun.
Where is she?
Stockholm.
She went this morning.
That's a lie.
She's at our offices looking at more old crap.
I got a call from our archives manager.
She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth.
I like that name.
Lisbeth.
So when Lisbeth leaves, I will get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her.
I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.
Hey, hey...
So, what do you wanna know?
You're a journalist, ask me questions.
What do I do with the girls?
That's a good question.
Well, before, I do what we're doing:
Sit down, relax, have a drink.
I like that part a lot.
Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die.
And afterwards, I just get rid of them, far out at sea.
Unlike my father, who left them scattered all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.
Well, he was a loud and garish man.
Frankly, he got what he deserved.
You can't be a sloppy technician like that.
You can't drink to excess like he did.
This takes discipline.
It's a science of a thousand details.
The planning, the execution.
It's the cleanup.
I guess I don't have to tell you, but you're going to create quite a mess here.
Shh-Shh-Shh. Shh.
Let me ask you something.
Why don't people trust their instincts?
They sense something is wrong, someone is walking too close behind them.
You knew something was wrong.
But you came back into the house.
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in? No.
All I had to do was offer you a drink.
It's hard to believe that the fear of offending can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what? It is.
And they always come willingly.
And then they sit there.
They know it's all over, just like you do.
But somehow, they still think they have a chance.
"Maybe if I say the right thing."
Maybe if I'm polite.
"If I cry, if I beg."
And when I see the hope draining from their face, like it is from yours right now,
I can feel myself... getting hard.
But, you know, we're not that different, you and I. We both have urges.
Satisfying mine requires more towels.

There's a gun.

May I kill him? Yeah.
How come a 23-year-old is a ward of the state?
I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
Since when have they said that?
Since I was 12.
What happened when you were 12?
I'm sorry, that's...
That's none of my business.
I tried to kill my father.
Burned him alive.
Got about 80 percent of him.
Oh.
I made some coffee.
- Who's that?
- It's Harriet.
I found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs.
No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone.
But when I mentioned
Harriet, he was confused.
He got angry at me because I couldn't tell him what had happened to her.
He didn't kill her.
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.
What if she did somehow manage to get away?
I mean, if... she is still alive, then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is.
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.
Your turn.
Right, um...
Here.
Hi. Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
What do you want?
Has no one called you? About?
Your cousin Martin.
What about him?
He died in a car accident last Thursday. There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad.
I'm not interested in any memorial.
Well, I understand.
What do you understand?
Well, that you don't care very much for your family.
Look, I just thought you should know.
Now I know.
Ahem. How'd it go?
Okay, I think.
She's on.
And she's shopping.
She's still playing solitaire?
Hm.
She hasn't called anyone?
No.
We have her cell phone too?
I was so sure she was gonna lead us to her.
Put your hand back in my shirt.
There's only one reason she hasn't called Harriet.
She can't.
Because Harriet is dead.
I was just thinking that...
Just one second. Okay.
What were you going to say?
I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility.
Well, we could, absolutely.
What is it now?
Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook...
Harriet.
So you sent the flowers.
Yes, I did.
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.
But the family never knew, did they? No.
So I'm guessing she then came here on her married-name passport, and you followed on her maiden-name passport.
No, actually, it was the other way around.
She thought that it was safer if
I traveled with Spencer myself.
Well, what did he think about that?
Nothing. Only that he loved her.
She said, "if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why."
And he never did.
And they both died 20 years ago.
Car accident.
You found that out too.
Is that you?
I was 14 the first time he raped me.
Martin.
No, my father.
Martin only started after he had died.
Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
I did. My mother.
Henrik would've done something.
I almost told him.
But I was afraid because of what I'd done.
I, uh... You still don't understand, do you?
A year after the first time, and there were many times during that year, my father got drunker than usual one night and he started bragging about the women he'd killed.
He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off.
He tied a belt around my neck.
He wanted to kill me.
I, um... I got out of the house.
I went down to the dock.
He came staggering after me.
I could never fight him off in a small space,
but out in the open,
I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk.
When it was over...
I looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me.
And all I'd accomplished was substitute one for another.
A couple of months later, Henrik sent Martin to school in Uppsala.
And I thought that maybe, just maybe, the nightmare was finally over.
And then I saw him the day of the parade,
across the street.
And I knew that it would never be over.
So how did you escape?
Anita. She...
She insisted that I leave everything behind.
If I took anything the police might have suspected that I was still alive.
As everyone ate dinner, I was no more than 20 meters away from them.
I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.
In the morning, she came to get me.
I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home,
but all I could think is, if I could just get away from them,
just get past the police,
then I might be safe.
And I was.
Until you showed up.
You're safe now.
How did you get away?
Someone saved me too.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
Thank you, Anna.
I made you a promise, whether you found anything or not.
So, what do you have to tell me?
What's this?
Hello, Henrik.
I barely remember Wennerström working here, much less being fired.
How could you?
It was such a long time ago, which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you.
You're referring to the statute of limitations, but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out.
If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here.
He wasn't trying to deceive you.
He knows you can't try somebody
35 years after the event.
I like Henrik, but he knows that.
A man's reputation means something.
He believes that.
He thought you could destroy Wennerström in the court of public opinion.
The court of public opinion celebrates people's bad behavior.
He's an elderly man.
He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate.
This isn't even the plate.
I can't do anything with this.
Yes, of course.
What happened with Wennerström?
How did he get you?
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source, who I'm now sure was one of Wennerström's lackeys.
It was fake.
Which he easily proved in court.
You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral.
Would you feel the same about Wennerström?
Go on.
I did some work on my own on him before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all because you and
Harriet-fucking-Vanger have kept me busy.
But I may have something.
You may have something?
Maybe.
They launder money from arms and drug sales and crime syndicates in Russia.
And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings.
The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands.
And how do you know this?
This time you don't want to know.
This time I do want to know.
I have access to his computer, and his accountant's and lawyer's.
And how do you have that?
I could've gotten it from a source inside the company.
You didn't.
But that's what you'll say.
And what will you say to me?
Well, that depends if you really want to know.
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?
Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who, this time last year was convicted of libel
In a Stockholm courtroom,
doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes.
Or maybe he has.
In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges
the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group.
The shit hits the fan.
Of criminal activities on a global scale.
What happens now?
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash.
The police will investigate,
Fl will investigate.
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.
You think?
Probably not.
These guys never do.

What's wrong with you?
It's embarrassing. Tell me.
I need to borrow some money. Oh.
Fifty thousand.
I have a chance to make an investment.
It's a smart, safe investment.
I really don't think I've got 50,000.
Yes, you do.
You have 65,000 in your two accounts.
I'm sorry that I know that.
You'll get the money back, I promise.
Okay.
Okay.
You want a coffee?
These allegations, like the last one from this so-called journalist,
are as ridiculous as they are untrue.
I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and I'm looking forward to it.
What about his documentation?
Fabricated. All of it.
The Securities
Fraud Office isn't quite as certain
as Mr. Wennerström of that.
If a fraction of what Mr.
Blomkvist alleges proves to be true,
not only will there be a securities investigation,
but an organized-crime inquiry as well.
Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.
And we can't force him to.
But we can look for them.
Beginning where?
Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.
Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this
has access to this kind of information.
Mr. Wennerström isn't available for comment,
but I'll be happy to answer questions.
- Where is he?
- At home, I imagine.
No, he's not.
Has he left the country?
I don't, uh, think so.
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss.
May I have your passport, please?
With his failure to appear
before a Security Exchange
Commission panel,
a warrant has been issued for the Wennerström Group CEO.
I can confirm that he left Sweden
on a private jet that landed in Paris last week.
Whether he's still there, we don't know.
He can be anywhere by now.
Thank you.
I have accounts at Bank of
Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands.
I'd like to transfer them and convert to bonds.
Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
Naturally.
How many accounts will you transfer?
Thirty.
Oh. This will take some time.
You will receive 4 percent commission.
I will.
Then it won't be a waste of it.
A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados
- says he knows where fugitive-
Here, in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.
Police released this photo and believe it is the disgraced billionaire.
Uh, how many of these would you like to convert for deposit?
All 50, into five accounts.
Yes. That looks correct.
The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi
may no longer have a country to call home,
but does have enough money to buy one.
According to the International
Banking Commission,
Wennerström, a week after the
Millennium article appeared
on newsstands, began emptying accounts
at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman Islands.
That money, approximately
2 billion euros,
was then spread over a number of accounts.
With the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich.
Hey. Hey.
Already? The money I borrowed.
Mm.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hm?
No, I quit.
It was a good investment?
It was okay.
What are you doing later?
I'm seeing my daughter.
Hm. Okay.
You look nice.
It's Christmas again.
I'll see you soon.
Mr. Wennerström won the libel case...
You got that call in the office.
I miss our meetings.
I'm sure you don't.
Why would you?
I was always such a headache for you.
Never showing up with good news, only problems.
I have good news now.
I made a friend.
I mean, one that you'd approve of.
I'm happy.
A man who authorities here in Marbella have confirmed
is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerström, shot three times in the head
in what police are calling a classic gangland execution.
The investigation into
Wennerström's ties
to crime organizations worldwide will now turn into speculation.
Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?
Wennerström spent the last days of his flamboyant life...
It's nice. Your father?
A friend.
Must be a very good friend.

Are you here to kill me?
I know what this is.
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
A man possessed of some radical notions.
What is the most resilient parasite?
A bacteria? A virus?
An intestinal worm?
Uh....
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--
An idea.
Resilient. Highly contagious.
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.
Right in there somewhere.
For someone like you to steal?
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...
...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...
...from even the most skilled extractor.
How can you do that?
Because I am the most skilled extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...
...your defense is never down.
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
...better than your therapist, better than anyone.
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...
...I need to know what's in that safe.
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.
He knows.
What's going on up there?
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
What's she doing here?
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.
If I jumped, would I survive?
With a clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?
I thought you might be missing me.
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.
So what?
Looks like Arthur's taste.
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.
Please, have a seat.
Tell me...
...do the children miss me?
You can't imagine.
What are you doing?
Just getting some fresh air.
Stay where you are, Mal.
Goddamn it.
Turn around.
The gun, Dom.
Please.
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?
I want to know the name of your employer.
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him would just wake him up.
But pain....
Pain is in the mind.
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
He was close. Very close.
Stop him!
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
He won't wake.
What?
Dunk him.
He's out.
You came prepared, hmm?
Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
- She would never....
- Yet here we are.
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.
Well, that's not true.
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
But your deception was obvious.
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.
Cobb?
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!
I've always hated this carpet.
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
But very definitely made of wool.
Right now...
...I'm lying on polyester.
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.
- How'd it go?
- Not good.
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.
But in my dream, you play by my rules.
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito....
We're not in your dream.
We're in mine.
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
That's enough.
You. What the hell was all that?
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.
He's not gonna check every compartment.
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.
Listen. Every man for himself.
Yes, hello?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?
Why?
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
Grandma says you're never coming back.
Phillipa, is that you?
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
She's shaking her head.
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.
Daddy?
Yeah, James?
Is Mommy with you?
James, we talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.
Where?
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?
And you be good, you be--
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?
Stateside.
Send my regards.
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
So I offer you the satisfaction.
It's not the way I deal with things.
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...
...why can't you plant one there instead?
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?
Elephants.
Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
Then you do have a choice.
Then I choose to leave, sir.
Tell the crew where you want to go.
Hey, Mr. Cobb.
How would you like to go home?
To America. To your children.
You can't fix that. No one can.
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...
...I'd need a guarantee.
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.
But I can.
So do you want to take a leap of faith...
...or become an old man, filled with regret...
...waiting to die alone?
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.
This can't be done.
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.
You don't know that.
I've done it before.
Who'd you do it to?
Why are we going to Paris?
We're gonna need a new architect.
You never did like your office, did you?
No space to think in that broom cupboard.
Is it safe for you to be here?
Extradition between France and the United States...
...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...
...to convince those children they still have a father.
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.
I never taught you to be a thief.
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.
But after what happened...
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
What are you doing here, Dom?
I think I found a way home.
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
But I need your help.
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.
- Money.
- Not just money.
You remember.
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities...
...things that never existed...
...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
They don't actually come into the dream.
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
Design it yourself.
Mal won't let me.
Come back to reality, Dom.
- Please.
- Reality.
Those kids, your grandchildren...
...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I've got somebody better.
Ariadne?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
Pleased to meet you.
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
A work placement?
Not exactly.
I have a test for you.
You're not gonna tell me anything first?
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
Stop.
Again.
Stop.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
That's more like it.
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
Now, that's when we're awake.
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.
Such as?
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
Genuine inspiration, right?
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.
We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?
It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Let me ask you a question.
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah.
So how did we end up here?
Well, we just came from the, uh....
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
If it's just a dream, then why are you--?
Because it's never just a dream, is it?
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.
That's why the military developed dream sharing.
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other...
...and then wake up.
How did architects become involved?
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Five minutes?
What--? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...
...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.
Almost everything else is here too.
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.
I am the subject. My mind populates it.
You can literally talk to my subconscious.
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
How else do you do it?
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
Well....
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
...but it's more about the feel of it.
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
Just you.
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this....
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.
Very impressive.
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?
Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college.
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.
You draw from stuff you know, right?
Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?
That why you need me to build your dreams?
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?
There was still time on the clock.
You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
What?
A totem, it's a small personal--
That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
- Like a coin?
- No.
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
That way, when you look at your totem...
...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to...
...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back....
When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.
It's a necessary risk.
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.
Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.
You never know.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
You're buying.
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.
How's your handwriting?
- It's versatile.
- Good.
Thank you very much.
Inception.
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me--
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
He is good at what he does, right?
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.
Not like you.
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.
You need the simplest version of the idea...
...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
So, what is this idea that you need to plant?
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
Right there you have various political motivations...
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
But all of that stuff, it's, um....
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?
What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
Which is what?
The relationship with the father.
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.
Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf.
He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.
Why don't you take me there?
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.
Cobol Engineering.
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.
All right.
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
My God, it's you, isn't it?
No, it isn't you.
Not dreaming now, are you?
Get him!
There!
One cafe.
Shh.
One cafe.
One cafe.
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.
Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
Different tail.
Cobb said you'd be back.
- I tried not to come, but....
- But there's nothing quite like it.
It's just...
...pure creation.
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
What kind of tricks?
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.
The infinite staircase.
See?
Paradox.
So a closed loop like that...
...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
But how big do these levels have to be?
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.
And the better the maze....
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
Exactly.
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
Why?
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.
- They're still together?
- No.
No, she's dead.
What you see in there is just his projection of her.
What was she like in real life?
She was lovely.
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.
To formulate compounds for a job?
And to go into the field with us.
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.
- Which are?
- Great depth.
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
Three.
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.
A powerful sedative.
- How many team members?
- Five.
Six.
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
This time, it seems there is.
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.
Perhaps you will not want to see.
After you.
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
They come every day to share the dream.
You see? Very stable.
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.
In dream time?
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?
Let's see what you can do.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
Sharp, no?
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
That's not your concern.
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
You asked me for inception.
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
This idea will define him.
It may come to change....
Well, it may come to change everything about him.
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
And we can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
Mr. Browning...
...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?
Not sure that's necessary.
No, no, no. I think we should.
How is he?
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but--
Robert, I told you keep out the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.
Leave that.
Here.
Must be a cherished memory of his.
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.
Robert...
...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.
The vultures are circling.
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
Then, when we take him a level deeper...
...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
So he gives himself the idea.
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
Were you going under on your own?
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
I didn't realize anyone was here, so....
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.
Here, let me take a look.
So you're learning, huh?
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh....
It was Mal's, actually. This....
This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin.
Arthur told me she passed away.
How are the mazes coming along?
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
...that we are trying to access.
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.
You know, l-- Actually, I have a question about this layout.
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.
Why is that so important?
In case one of us brings in our projections.
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
You can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.
- You can't build...
...because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
No one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.
- Thank you.
- For what?
For not asking whether I did.
"I will split up my father's empire."
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...
...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a "screw you" to the old man.
No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
All right, well, try this. Um....
"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than "might."
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
Inception's not about being specific.
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find.
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father...
...and say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
Sedation.
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
Good night.
The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
...creates a clear connection between dreamers...
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20--
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?
It's a week, the first level down.
Six months the second level down, and the third level--
That's 10 years.
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Depends on the dream.
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
- A kick.
- What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.
It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
That's the clever part.
I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.
Or tipping.
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need--
We need at least a good 10 hours.
Sydney to Los Angeles.
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.
He must be flying private, then.
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
On a 747, the pilot's up top...
...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Of course I do.
You said you had a dream.
That we'd grow old together.
And we can.
You shouldn't be here.
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.
Why do you do this to yourself?
It's the only way I can still dream.
Why is it so important to dream?
In my dreams, we're still together.
These aren't just dreams.
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.
I know I did.
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.
They're memories that I have to change.
Well, what's down there that you regret?
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.
This is your house?
Mine and Mal's, yes.
Where is she?
She's already gone.
That's my son, James.
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
That's Phillipa.
I thought about calling out to them...
...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.
Right now or never, Cobb.
Then I start to panic.
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
...that I need to see their faces one last time.
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
But the moment's past.
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.
As I'm about to call out to them...
...they run away.
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.
The real world.
What are you doing here?
My name is--
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand.
How could you understand?
Do you know what it is to be a lover?
To be half of a whole?
No.
I'll tell you a riddle.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you don't know for sure.
But it doesn't matter.
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
Because you'll be together.
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
What happened here?
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!
I'll come back for you. I promise.
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
All right.
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
And it doesn't have to be me...
...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the plane.
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.
Complete the job en route...
...I make one phone call from the plane...
...you have no trouble getting through lmmigration.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh. Water, please.
Oh, um, same, please.
Um....
Thank you.
You know, I couldn't help but notice...
...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
Yes, he, um....
He was my father.
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Hey.
To your father.
May he rest in peace, huh?
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
Ha, ha, bloody ha.
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.
All right. Taxi. Thank you.
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?
Great.
Come on.
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.
You might at least drop me at my stop.
I'm afraid that it doesn't--
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!
What the hell is going on?
This wasn't in the design.
Cobb?
Cobb?
Get him!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.
Saito?
Get Fischer in the back room now.
What the hell happened?
Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
Where'd it come from?
Why the hell were we ambushed?
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...
...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.
It should've shown in the research.
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!
We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.
Put him out his misery.
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
No. It won't wake him up.
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.
Not from this.
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
Right. So, what happens when we die?
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind...
...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
Which, in our case, is just you.
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.
Let's get him upstairs.
Great.
Thank you.
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.
And if we get killed...
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
Someone got first aid?
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.
This was the only way to go three layers deep.
You knew about this and went along with it?
I trusted him.
When? When he promised you half his share?
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.
You led us into a war zone with no way out?
There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible...
...and we get out using the kick, just like before.
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.
I am sitting this one out on this level.
Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
Downwards is the only way forwards.
Get ready.
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
Shut up! It won't be.
In your father's office, below the bookshelves...
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.
I don't know any safe.
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
Tell us what it is.
I don't know.
We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah? Whose authority?
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?
Cash, cards, lD. And this.
Useful?
Maybe.
You're on. You've got an hour.
An hour?
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.
- What's that?
- Good authority.
Uncle Peter.
Just make them stop.
- The combination.
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
You have one hour. Start talking.
You all right?
You okay?
Those bastards have had at me for two days.
They have someone with access to your father's office.
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.
- Yeah, well, neither do l, so....
- What?
Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it.
No, he never gave me any combination.
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.
Well, what, then?
I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers...
...based on your experiences with Maurice.
We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together.
Perhaps after your mother died.
After my mother died, you know what he told me?
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.
I was 11, Uncle Peter.
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
And if he dies?
Worst-case scenario?
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.
I appreciate that, Saito.
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
Limbo is gonna become your reality.
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
Filled with regret?
Waiting to die alone.
No.
I'll come back.
And we'll be young men together again.
Breathe.
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.
All right. What is in the safe?
Something for you.
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
That's an alternate.
This would supersede the other if you want it to.
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
Destroying my whole inheritance?
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.
In his own way.
In his own way.
At the end...
...he called me in to his deathbed.
He could barely speak.
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
He pulled me close.
And I could only make out...
...one word.
"Disappointed."
When were you in limbo?
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?
The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer...
...we're also going deeper into you.
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
We were working together.
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
I kept pushing things.
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
...that we could get trapped so deep...
...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
...we lost sight of what was real.
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.
We did that for years.
We built our own world.
How long were you stuck there?
Something like 50 years.
Jesus.
How could you stand it?
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.
And what about for her?
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
Limbo became her reality.
What happened when you woke up?
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades...
...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.
This one very simple idea that changed everything.
That our world wasn't real.
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
...that in order to get back home...
...we had to kill ourselves.
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...
...that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.
I can tell the difference.
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?
You don't know you're dreaming!
She was certain there was nothing I could do...
...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.
She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary.
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.
No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me.
No, I'm not.
Now, you listen to me.
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.
Now, just step back inside.
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
We've talked enough.
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.
We're gonna talk about this.
All right?
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.
Take a second, think about our children.
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...
...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
How you've threatened to kill me.
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
We're going home to our real children.
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?
You're waiting for a train.
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!
Jesus Christ!
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
So I ran.
Right now, or never, Cobb.
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!
All right, let's go.
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
And if we are gonna succeed in this...
...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her.
But you don't have to do that alone.
- No, you're not....
- I'm doing it for the others.
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
We have to move.
Time's up.
All right. I don't know any combination.
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
- I have no idea.
- Right now!
I said, right now! Right now!
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
You'll have to do better than that.
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?
What'd you get?
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
This helps us how?
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.
We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
Damn it.
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...
...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.
The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
No problem.
How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?
Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
- You ready?
- Ready!
Sweet dreams.
Am I boring you?
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.
Um, I have a lot on my mind.
There goes Mr. Charles.
Mr. Fischer, right?
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--
Hmm.
- And you must be?
- Leaving.
In case you get bored.
Must've blown you off.
That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.
Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.
Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500--
About $500, right?
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.
Who or what is Mr. Charles?
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
And why don't you approve?
It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.
So now you've noticed how much time...
...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
- I'm sorry, but....
- Hold on! Wait!
You look a bit perkier.
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
Turbulence on the plane?
No, it's much closer.
That's Yusuf's driving.
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?
Rod Green from marketing.
But that's not true at all, is it?
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?
I'm the head of your security down here.
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
Security, huh?
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.
You're talking about dreams?
Are you talking about, um, extraction?
I am here to protect you.
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event...
...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.
Strange weather, isn't it?
You feel that?
What's happening?
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
We should probably get out of here.
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.
None of this is real. You're in a dream.
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself...
...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
Yeah, l....
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
Mm-hm.
- You're not real?
- No.
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event...
...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you get me out of here?
Right away. Follow me.
Hold on a second.
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger...
...you may not wake up.
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.
You remember the training.
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
What do you remember from before this dream?
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.
There was rain.
Uncle Peter.
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.
It had something to do with, um....
Something to do with a safe.
God, why is it so hard to remember?
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
Listen, it takes years of practice.
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.
Five.
Five, two-- It was something, it was a long number.
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.
Yep.
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
So we get a nice synchronized kick.
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.
They're with me. Go on.
Mr. Charles.
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.
They were trying to put you under.
- I'm already under.
- Under again.
What do you mean, a dream within a dream?
Hey. I see you've changed.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.
Oh.
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...
...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
Shh.
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.
And you saw them torture him?
The kidnappers are working for you?
Robert.
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?
That's his last insult.
A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.
But he's wrong.
You can build a better company than he ever did.
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
All right.
- He's out.
- Wait.
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
We're going into Fischer's.
I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
That's right.
Security's gonna run you down hard.
And I will lead them on a merry chase.
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
You good?
Hey. You ready?
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.
Cobb?
Cobb? What's down there?
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.
I mean, what's down there for you?
Did you see that?
Eames, this is your dream.
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.
No, you're with me.
I could do it.
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.
The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
You're not coming in?
In order to find out the truth about your father...
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.
Come on, Fischer!
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!
Move!
Go!
Sod it.
I hope you're ready.
No, it's too soon.
Cobb, do you hear that?
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
So, what do we do?
We move fast.
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
Which gives Arthur three minutes.
- Hey!
- That's him!
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.
Then they need a new route, a more direct route.
It's designed as a labyrinth.
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
Eames?
Did Eames add any features?
I don't think I should tell you.
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
Good. Explain it to them.
- Saito?
- Go ahead.
Paradox.
- What was that?
- The kick.
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?
Yeah, we missed it.
Man.
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, what the hell do we do now?
We finish the job before the next kick.
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up....
How do I drop you without gravity?
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.
You okay?
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!
Go, go, go!
There's something wrong.
They're heading your way, like they know something.
Just buy us more time, all right?
- Come on!
- On my way.
Come on! Move!
All right.
Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
- Does the strong room have windows?
- lt wouldn't be very strong if it did.
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.
I'm in.
There he is.
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
Come on. Come on, a little lower.
Cobb.
No, she is not real.
How do you know that?
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.
Hello.
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.
I couldn't shoot her.
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.
So that's it, then? We failed?
We're done. I'm sorry.
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
Let's set the charges.
No, there's still another way.
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.
No, but there will be enough time down there.
And we will find him.
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him.
We can give him his own kick down below.
Look, you get him in there.
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital...
...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.
Saito will never make it, will he?
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
Mal's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.
She wants me back down there with her.
All right?
- This is your world?
- lt was.
And this is where she'll be.
Come on.
Saito. Saito.
I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?
No room for tourists on these jobs.
Don't be silly.
You built all this? This is incredible.
We built for years.
Then we started in on the memories.
This way.
This was our neighborhood.
Places from our past.
That was our first apartment.
Then we moved to that building right there.
After Mal became pregnant, that became our home.
You reconstructed all of this from memory?
Like I told you, we had lots of time.
What is that?
That's the house Mal grew up in.
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.
Come on.
We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building.
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
What?
I'm gonna improvise.
Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
Highly contagious.
And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define...
...or destroy you.
The smallest idea, such as:
"Your world is not real."
Simple little thought that changes everything.
So certain of your world. Of what's real.
Do you think he is?
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
I know what's real, Mal.
No creeping doubts?
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
Chased around the globe...
...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
Admit it.
You don't believe in one reality anymore.
So choose.
Choose to be here.
Choose me.
You know what I have to do.
I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Because you left us.
I'm not wrong.
You're confused.
Our children are here.
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
Up above?
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.
Watch.
James? Phillipa?
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?
What if I'm what's real?
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Guilt.
I feel guilt, Mal.
And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...
...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there...
...reminding me of the truth.
What truth?
That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
You planted the idea in my mind?
What is she talking about?
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?
We were lost in here.
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.
She had locked something away, something deep inside.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
And she couldn't break free.
So I decided to search for it.
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
And I broke in...
...and I planted an idea.
A simple little idea that would change everything.
That her world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that'll take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you can't know for sure.
Yet it doesn't matter.
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!
But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
...that even after she woke....
That even after you came back to reality...
...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
Mal, no! Jesus!
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.
You betrayed me.
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.
We can still be together, right here...
...in the world we built together.
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
You can't have him.
- lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?
Fischer is on the porch.
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
No.
I wish.
I wish more than anything, but...
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
...all your perfection, all your imperfection.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Look at you.
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.
And you were the best that I could do, but...
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.
Does this feel real?
- What are you doing?
- lmprovising.
No, no, no!
In there, now. Go, go, go.
I was dis--
I was dis-- Disa--
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--
I know you were disappointed...
...I couldn't be you.
No.
No, no, no.
I was disappointed...
...that you tried.
What?
Come on, come on.
Dad?
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!
I will!
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did.
We did. You don't remember?
I miss you more than I can bear...
...but we had our time together.
And I have to let you go.
I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, Robert.
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...
...not just to live for him.
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
What happened?
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?
No, to find Saito.
He'll be lost.
No, he'll be all right.
Have you come to kill me?
I'm waiting for someone.
Someone from a half-remembered dream.
Cobb?
Impossible.
We were young men together.
I'm an old man.
Filled with regret.
Waiting to die alone.
I've come back for you.
To remind you of something.
Something you once knew.
That this world is not real.
To convince me to honor our arrangement?
To take a leap of faith, yes.
Come back...
...so we can be young men together again.
Come back with me.
Come back.
Hot towel, sir?
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.
Do you need immigration forms?
Thank you.
Hot towel, sir?
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome.
This way.
James? Phillipa?
Look who's here.
Hey.
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy!
- How are you?
Look what I've been building!
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!
On the cliff? Come on, I want you to show me. Can you show me?
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
Hi.
Hi.
Have we met somewhere before?
Mm-hm, I don't think so.
Mm.
Ah.
Late.
Very late, Anna. You put the alarm back again.
Stautenmeyer is calling into the office this morning.
We're gonna talk to them about making me partner.
Wow. That's amazing.
Yeah, you're gonna have to work on being a little more corporate.
Yeah, work on this.
Jesus!
Not funny.
Ha ha.
In other news, the serial killer now known as Tearjerk Jack...
continues to spread terror across the East Side.
Police have verified the disco very of a fifth victim...
in the early hours this morning.
We will continue to follow the story for you as develop—
Shouldn't you be handing out gold stars instead of earning yellow ribbons on FarmVille?
I was just checking pre-delays in the subway.
What do you think?
I like it a little rough, but I guess...
Mr. Stautenmeyer likes his men a little different.
No, he does like it smooth.
Next stop.
"A chance encounter with a mysterious stranger...
could be a bridge to new exciting opportunities. "
Wow, that looks like modern art.
It's a little Picasso we've got going over here.
Whoa.
Oh, no. It's so not a big deal.
Why don't we get a sponge from over there and clean it up, okay?
All right.
Okay, got it.
Woo! Woo!
I got you.
Oh, no, you got me.
Oh, no, you got me.
Hello. I am here to pick up—
Robert. He's in the sandpit.
Oh, you're good. I don't know how you tell them apart.
Hello!
Hi, Supernanny. Any h unklicio us divorcee to report...
or are you too busy potty-training their offspring?
You're so bad. I'm still on the clock, you know.
So, are you coming today?
Yeah, it's Tuesday, right?
You bet your ass I am.
No, I'd rather drink the calories.
Mm, six-and-a-half.
Not too bad.
I would say seven.
Look left to the bar. Quick.
Ten out of ten. Not too shabby. Not too shabby at all.
I wouldn't kick him out of bed for eating crackers.
Or anything else.
Does that matter?
Okay. So, I wanna know how was
Justin Timberlake last week?
Hm. Had a few drinks.
Went back to his—
Need I elaborate?
I had more fun with a broken vibrator.
Does it ever get tiring, being a slut?
I'll tell you one thing you never get tired of.
That moment when you wake up and for a second... you have no idea where you are or who the hell the guy is next to you.
I live for that stuff
I guess it complicates things a little bit less, right?
Yeah.
I mean, sometimes with Bryce—
No, enough with Bryce.
If you're done with him, just hand him over.
Come on, girls.
Big smiles.
Just think in three months... we will be sipping those dirty martinis on Laguna Beach.
Hey, guys, I was... I wanted to tell you, but, um...
I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it this year.
What?
It's sacred.
It's a ritual.
I know. It's just Bryce wants to take us to Vegas... to celebrate our first year and stuff.
Classy.
He's so gonna pop the question.
Okay, listen, we just moved in together.
And what are you waiting for? Get dumped for some skanky-ass cheerleader?
If he pulls out a ring, you should snatch it, girl.
Thank you.
You know, once you've squeezed out a couple of rug-rats...
you'll fix up some money pit and slide contentedly into senility.
Fran cine, for a second there...
I forgot why you're still single.
Oh, my God, you guys.
Mister "Ten-Out-of-Ten" over there is totally checking me out.
Oh, well, no sense in letting him go to waste.
Another drink.
Yeah, I know, it's cool. I mean, he's not hot at all.
I mean, he's certainly not my type.
Excuse me, between my nose and my rack... which do you think
I should get done first?
Major alcoholic. She's got problems. Come on.
I'm sorry.
Wilcox and Third, please.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
It's okay. Unlike some people I know, I can walk.
Are you getting in or what?
Hey, ma'am, lookout!
Hey, check it out.
No!
Anna? Anna!
Will she be okay?
Somebody tell me. They ran all the tests again this morning.
Look, she's waking up.
Anna?
Anna, can you hear me?
- Hey, chica, we're here.
- Are you okay?
Who are you?
Anna, it's me.
It's Bryce.
Oh, my head.
You're fine.
My head hurts.
Nothing is broken. You are a blue-eyed miracle, kid.
Don't. Don't touch me.
Who are you?
It's us, chica.
Hey, don't you recognize us?
Anna? You've been unconscious for over a week.
Doctor.
He's not Bryce.
It's okay, Anna.
Calm down.
I's not him. It's not
Bryce. I know Bryce.
Anna, you just need to relax. You need some rest.
You got a nasty bump on your head.
It's all right, Anna.
Please, I-I don't need that.
Anna!
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!
Anna! Anna, wait.
She's confused.
Do you think she's okay?
It's okay.
Anna, sweetheart.
Open the door.
Anna, it's me.
Okay. Okay.
Sh, sh.
Take a close look at this, please.
And this one?
Is that the same face you see?
No.
Both photos are of the same man.
What you are experiencing are symptoms of prosopagnosia.
Sorry, proso-what?
Prosopagnosia or face blindness.
It-it's an impairment in face perception...
caused by a lesion on the temporal lobe.
It's this part of the brain that allows us in a nanosecond... to compare someone's face with all of the faces stored in our memory.
You wanna dumb it down a little bit, Doc?
Every time you look at someone's face... it's as if you've never seen them before. Even someone close to you.
Even your own reflection.
However, confirmed cases of prosopagnosia are extremely rare.
Anna is probably suffering a slight cerebral shock.
If the symptoms persist, you'll need to see another specialist... for a second opinion.
Twenty-dollar words for stuff... they know nothing about.
Psychiatrists for ya.
I had the place cleaned for when you came back.
Thank you.
You know, I really thought
I was gonna lose you there.
Come here.
So, are you getting used to my new looks?
Are they an improvement at least?
Yeah, I mean... no.
Y- you look great.
You see?
It's not all bad.
It'll pass.
And everything will go back to the way that it was.
Hey, at least some things never change.
Oh, that'll be your dad.
He's been calling non-stop on some crackly line from Argentina.
Hello.
Uh, no.
I just brought her home.
No, I understand but—
If you want.
Okay, I'll bring her in.
All right.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Who was that?
It was just the police. Some detective. He keeps calling.
He wants to take your statement. Now.
Guess you put a pretty good fight, huh?
How do you know that?
I called your cell.
On the bridge, remember?
I heard things.
I'm the one who called the police.
Any more internaI memos end up in the Tribune...
I'll personally tear the son of a bitch a new ass hole.
Miss Marchant, correct?
How's the head?
You're the boyfriend?
Yeah. Bryce.
I'm Kerrest.
This way.
Watch your step.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't go in. Just sign this before you do anything.
Oh, you're wearing that pretty blue tie.
Thank you.
Would you change this goddamn cell phone ring?
Why don't you just figure it out yourself, you freaking loser.
A pasta bracelet. It's all we found on the bridge.
No bag, no phone. Are you sure they didn't fall with you?
I'm gonna ask you not to cancel your cell phone contract.
The asshole's probably not stupid enough to use it, but you never know.
So you really think that it's him?
He killed, raped, and wept over the corpse. You must know how he works.
He's been front page news for six months now.
They even have a snappy name for him.
Tearjerk Jack.
So, are you gonna protect her?
This, my friend... is what we have to wade through just to request police protection.
Twenty of these get dumped on the Chief's desk e very morning.
Cops parked outside your house 24I7 scarfing doughnuts.
Strictly 911 territory.
He's got my papers.
He's got my address.
And he's not stupid enough to go after the one person who can recognize him, right?
Look...
I'm sorry you had to meet this year's whackjob.
You wanna feel safe?
Help me catch the son of a bitch.
What do you got for me here?
Thirty-five, forty, tall, dark?
I'm not letting you out of here until you give me more than this.
Did you or did you not see his face?
Did you or did you not see his face?
Yes, I did.
Good. We're getting somewhere.
Here. Look these over carefully.
Take your time.
This is bullshit! Miss Marchant, you haven't even looked at half of these.
I can't remember his face, okay? Since the accident—
Anna, just—sh.
She just got out of the hospital. She needs rest.
Rest? You go tell that to the six women whose throat he cut from ear to ear!
I apologize if I'm rattling your cage... but I'd rather the next time we meet you weren't lying on a slab.
I can't recognize faces anymore. Do you understand?
Since the accident I—
That-that man could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it.
Please, don't waste your time trying to scare me... because I am.
I already am.
Call the hospital.
They'll explain.
Hey, Nicky.
Lanyon, I've been trying to reach you for the last two hours.
Man, it's Wednesday.
Nicholas. No cell.
Guess who just woke up and walked in?
Anna Marchant.
Dammit, not a diet Pepsi.
So, what's the story?
You got any leads?
Can we talk?
So, this face blindness... is it temporary or permanent?
They have no freaking idea.
You think it's funny?
Well, she's the only one who's seen him, and she can't recognize anybody?
You gotta admit it's pretty far out.
How's the kid doing?
He still hasn't uttered a word.
We have no lead, no ID.
Jorgensen in forensics... even pushed a trace on the tear sample...
through the Feds'
DNA database. Nada.
The guy is a freaking ghost.
You're the mind reader with the fancy diploma.
You know what I think?
The guy has to kill women to be able to touch them. Well, that's sad.
The melancholy killer theory?
I mean, come on. You gotta give me more than that.
He weeps because his sexual compulsions disgust him. He— he only kills so they won't see him as he truly is.
Anna Marchant saw him.
Yeah, and she-she survived. I think he's gonna be really interested in her.
Let me head down the Mission. Have another crack at that hobo who fished her out.
Good luck. We got nothing out of him but sea shanties.
Hey, there.
Have we met somewhere before?
Hey.
I'm sorry.
It was just a bad dream.
Hey, it's okay.
Look, they need me at the office this morning but—
Now, if you want, I can—
No, it's okay. I'm—
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Hey.
Hey.
You gave me quite a ride, old boy.
Why weren't you down at the Mission?
It's dirty there.
Might not be the Savoy but at least it's safe.
Anything could happen to you down here.
And what do you care, huh?
I got some questions and this time I really need the answers.
The soonest I can get out is on Tuesday's red eye from Buenos Aires.
Look, I'll take you to dinner. I'll spoil you rotten.
Well, that sounds great. You know what?
Why don't you come meet me at school? I start back on Wednesday.
Okay, any cfeIays
I'll call you.
Can you call me on Bryce's
Blackberry? Do you have that number?
I ha ve it, I ha ve it. Now listen...
I wish I could've been there for you.
It's okay, Dad. I love you, okay? I'll see you then.
I love you, too,
Snowflake. Bye.
Bye.
Hello.
It's us, chica.
Open up!
Hi, Sleeping Beauty.
Know who we are this time?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, absolutely.
I was just really zoned out last time.
I mean, I'm— really fine.
Well, look. You made the front page.
You're famous, bebe.
God, I got away.
Oh, my God.
In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here.
In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here!
Look who's back.
Hello, handsome.
You feel like remembering?
There's a two-six in it for ya. Right?
Oh. I'll call you.
Or I'll text you.
Martinis at 11 a. M.
It's almost midnight in Shanghai.
Just drink up.
Nina, you did not just post that pic.
I look squinty.
No, no, delete
I don't think so!
Por fa vor.
I'll be right back.
Okay, chica.
Hello.
Hey.
What do you want now?
Do you see anything?
No.
Just reminds me of Europe
After the Rain by Max Ernst.
I'm sorry?
So, what was I supposed to see exactly?
Well, I-I-I guess if I really have, uh, proso—
Prosopagnosia.
Yes.
Well, you tell me.
Can you or can you not see people's faces?
Well, of course I can see people's faces.
It's just that they keep changing all the time.
So, you have the answer to your question.
Cinnamon candy?
But there must be some sort of treatment. Medication or—
Face blindness isn't something you just catch, Miss Marchant.
It's something you lose.
What are you telling me?
That I'm gonna be stuck like this forever?
You're gonna have to get used to people's faces changing...
as soon as you lose sight of them.
Out of a thousand faces... one might miraculously linger.
Thank you so much.
Doctor.
Faces are the bar code of the human race.
Ever since mankind went tribal... we're constantly looking at each other's faces... trying to decide whether they're friends, foes or lovers.
Don't underestimate the seriousness of your condition, Miss Marchant.
I don't wanna be late for school.
Okay, everybody. Urn, can
I- can I get some quiet, please?
Great.
Urn... so today, uh, we are going to play a new type of game.
Okay?
And we get to wear stickers!
And it's gonna be superfun.
Fun, fun, fun.
So when
I call your name...
I want you to come up to my desk one by one...
starting with
Caroline Beasley.
Now, for this game to work...
I need you to wear the sticker all day long... and don't take it off.
Do you understand?
Yes, Miss Marchant.
Does everybody understand? Please, keep your stickers on all day.
Charlotte Canton.
Stop. You guys, settle down. Please.
Caroline.
I didn't do anything!
I need you to turn around
I need to see your stickers.
Hi. I'm here for my daughter.
Your daughter. Uh—
Sandra.
Sandra. Sandra.
Uh, Sandra.
Uh-
Miss, Miss. Miss, I need to go pee.
Okay, sweetie, go pee.
I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush. Where's my daughter?
Sorry. Uh, Sandra.
Sandra?
Miss, Sandra left with her daddy.
Left with her dad.
You let her go with my ex-husband? Are you insane?
I told you not to let her go with my ex-husband!
I have full custody!
What time did they go?
Was he with somebody? I need to know if he was with somebody.
That is really, really important.
Shut up!
I have trouble concentrating on names, that's all.
But it will pass.
I mean, it will pass.
In the meantime... how are you gonna watch the children in the yard?
Or during swimming classes? With your stickers?
Anna, you're my best teacher.
But I'm gonna have to suspend you. I'm sorry.
If you're better by September,
I'll see what I can do.
"Be wary of appearances...
and an unexpected invitation to dinner. "
Carotid artery and the larynx are severed, just like the others.
Looks like a match.
Missed him by minutes.
Kerrest.
He's here. He's here with me right now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
I'm on the subway.
And the bag I lost... he put it right on the seat in front of me.
Hold on.
You saw him?
No, but there-there was somebody watching me outside the school.
Maybe he followed me into the train.
The bag, you sure it's yours?
Of course I'm sure.
I might not know people's faces, but I know my own damn handbag.
All right. So, the guy you saw, what's he look like?
How the hell should I know?
It could be any goddamn one of them.
You gotta help me out here, all right?
I can't shut down a whole subway just for a handbag.
Urn, okay.
He was wearing an orange shirt, a bright orange shirt.
Orange shirt. Thank you.
Where are you exactly?
Line four, going to Harlin Street.
You need to listen to me. Whatever you do, you stay on that train.
Make sure that people are around you. I'm gonna—
Hello?
Hello?
Damn.
 Those connecting to fine two, this is your exit.
Make sure where you go.
No!
You stay away from me. Stay away!
What's going on?
Don't move, buddy.
Stay where you are.
What the hell is going on here?
Anna, you told me to meet you after work.
I see you running down into the subway. What the hell is going on here?
Just stand still, sir.
For God's sake, Snowflake.
Why are you so scared of me?
Daddy?
Let go.
Oh, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, Daddy.
Sweetie, it's all right.
It's all right.
I'm okay.
Hey, it's Anna and Bryce. We 're not home. Please leave a message. Bye.
Hi, Snowflake. Look,
I'm back at the airport.
Listen to me.
You have to tell Bryce about your condition.
You can't just ignore it.
Hi.
Miss Marchant! Hello!
I just wanted to tell you. Oh, God.
Everything you said... you were right.
When I was 16...
I had two passions in life.
Horse-back riding and opera.
I dreamt of being the next Callas.
Until the horse threw me head-first into a brick wall.
The accident left me deaf... and I had to rule out an operatic career.
You're deaf?
Oh, yes, as a post. I have to read your lips to know what you're saying.
But I can still hear Wagner.
I just have to close my eyes and listen.
And you too are going to have to learn... to find your inner music.
Everyone always goes on about sight, hearing, smell.
But there's another sense.
A hidden one.
The Japanese call it "muga. "
It's the sense that allows you to walk... without having to think about putting one foot in front of the other.
You lose this sense... and you will become like some of my other patients.
Socially paralyzed... withdrawing from the world into the safety of isolation.
That's a tempting option.
No, I don't want that. I wanna live normally.
Every day people are going to resent you... for not recognizing who they are.
They'll call you rude, forgetful, stupid, liar.
Now, are you willing to fight back... with all your might?
Yeah.
To try and try again without losing heart, without giving an inch?
Yes.
Good.
Then let's get to work.
Allow me to introduce you... to Mike... and Maggie.
Hard to tell apart at first sight, aren't they?
Take a closer look.
Maggie is a little paler, don't you think?
Oh, and look.
She had this scar... on her forehead.
You see?
It gets more complicated when you have to pick Mike and Maggie out at a party...
among all the other guests.
Yeah.
You're going to learn to focus on distinctive markers in people.
A mole, a tattoo, their gait.
Anything that stands out that makes it easier to identify that person.
Right.
What's the first thing you look at in a man, after his face?
My friends and I look at his butt.
Well, what else is there to look at?
Right.
Paler in complexion, small scar on the forehead.
That's Maggie.
Congra tula Hons.
# A thousand faces #
# Looking in
All directions #
# Leading me
To something #
# I can ne ver see #
# Why do you think
I come here #
# Why do you think
I come round #
Hi!
Hi.
So, what's this earth-shattering thing you have to tell us?
The reservation's for seven. Do you want me to come pick you up?
No, I think
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
I'll see you later then.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Wait. You...
You recognized me! Holy crap, can we call off the straightjacket now?
Oh, thank God.
I couldn't take another wacko freak-out every time I tried to kiss you.
So, this—this doesn't change anymore, right?
You can-you can really recognize me?
Yes, I do.
What are you talking about?
You don't recognize me?
I'm your best friend.
I do. With your unique hair cut... and the red skirt you always wear when you're trying to get some.
It's fine. But, oh, God, I just—
When-when-when people are wearing the same clothes or uniforms, forget it.
They all have the same face to me.
What about Bryce?
How is he taking this?
Oh, God.
He thinks that
I'm adjusting.
I told him that
I recognized him.
Please, promise me you won't tell him.
You're lying to him?
I cannot lose him.
Do you understand?
He's the only thing I ha ve left.
Ho id it right there.
You mean you get to bang a new guy every night... without ever cheating on your boyfriend?
That's like a dream come true.
Another drink.
Take one step.
Immerse yourself... in people's gestures, their mannerisms.
Watch them until their bodies become a melody.
Hum it, hum it, until you can sing it at the top of your voice.
Use all your resilience, Anna...
but whatever happens, don't let the music stop.
Hiya.
Oh. Hey.
How's it going?
Good.
Didn't expect to see you here.
Well... it's nice to see you.
I'm sorry, I don't remember your name.
Hm.
That's odd.
I, uh... usually leave a strong impression on women.
Okay. Well, see you later.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the rush, huh?
Things are just getting interesting.
Hello. Can I help you with anything?
Come on, make an effort.
You know who I am.
Officer. Officer, that man over there.
He's standing right next to the newsstand.
What are you saying?
That man over—
Never mind.
I am not letting...
Excuse me.
Detective Kerrest, please.
Hold on.
I'm gonna check if he's here.
Hey.
Seen any more killers on public transport?
Just don't move.
What are you doing?
I need to check something.
Can you stay there? Please.
I won't move.
Oh, my God!
I recognize your face. I recognize your face. It's still your face.
Me? You recognize me?
Yes.
It's the first face I recognize since the incident.
Do you think that means something?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey. Any word from the DA?
Oh. Am I interrupting something?
No.
Are you okay?
Miss Marchant, allow me to introduce
Eric Lanyon, our star pitcher... ace profiler and all-round swell guy.
They say it takes a warped mind to get into a psychopath's head... but I'm okay.
Really.
Nicky had another nosebleed.
It's nice to meet you.
You, too. What brings you here?
I saw the papers.
I wanna know everything there is to know about this man.
You're talking to the right guy. Lanyon knows everything...
about our friendly neighborhood whackjob.
I betcha can't pinch a pen from Lydia's desk.
I don't know if he really tried to kill you.
He has an odd way for asking about dinner and a movie.
What he's saying is that maybe he reacted out of self-defense.
Forgive me,
Miss Marchant.
If he really wanted to kill you once you left hospital... we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
I wanna help catch this guy.
No. I'm not gonna—
I'm not gonna recognize his face like that. I need to see them.
In front of me.
I guess it's worth a shot.
I'd have to run to catch the D.A. Right now.
Very nice to meet you.
So, what's your colleague's theory?
He thinks you made quite an impression on the freak.
Watched him do his thing and walked away.
What do you think?
About a year ago when Homicide turned up the first victim...
Lanyon insisted he had the hallmark of a sociopath.
We didn't agree. We thought it was a one off, a crime of passion.
Six months later, another dead woman showed up.
She had an 8-year-old son who... found her on the bedroom floor with her throat cut.
Now he sees the kid every chance he gets.
I've learned to keep my mouth shut and trust what Lanyon says.
Sh.
Come on, you can drop the freaking Snow White act.
You've all been here before.
Got a light?
There's no smoking here.
Come on, get in.
All right, stand in line and look straight ahead.
Step it up.
They're all known offenders that match your statement.
We're waiting on papers to run DNA checks on 'em.
They're all yours.
How are we doing in here?
Fine.
Do you think they could move around a little bit?
All right, we've seen enough of your ugly mugs. I want you to walk around.
Anybody who slacks up gets a night in a cell.
I just need to see their gestures, their- their-their movements.
I know it sounds crazy but—
If you want to host a dance class, it's fine with me.
I said move your asses. Now, get to it.
It's not any of them.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
At least we tried.
I'm really sorry.
1-1 wanted to help.
Anna.
Good luck with the investigation.
Sam! Bad news.
Mulgrew won't go for the witness protection you requested for Anna Marchant.
After the subway blowout and the line-up on top... they don't think she's 100% compos mentis.
It's absolute bullshit. She's the only witness we've got, for God's sake.
We need to up our game here.
Organize another line-up, ma nana.
Come on. We can't bring in every perp in the city... hoping she'll recognize the inside leg of his trousers!
I guess that'll give you a good excuse to see her again.
What did you say?
Come on, buddy.
You know what I mean.
One, she has a boyfriend. Two, there's nothing between us.
Three, even if there was, I swear, if you mention this to anybody, I will kick your ass.
It's highly unethical and possibly illegal for a police officer... to fraternize with a key witness.
Whoa. It's that bad?
Screw it.
I mean, seriously, can you picture the two of us together... arm in arm at the police ball?
Why not?
I always thought you looked rather fetching in uniform.
Happy birthday, chica.
Thank you.
Quick, quick.
Look, look.
A twelve out of ten.
Twelve out of ten.
He"s totally checking me out!
So that's what you do on your girls' nights out?
Well, no, not me.
No, just-just, um—
Everybody's dancing tonight.
Even you, Bryce.
I'm gonna go get us a drink.
Okay.
Did you see that?
Totally on me.
Where is he?
Okay, okay, back up.
Give her a chance.
Okay, what do I do?
Just act natural, okay?
Natural?
Okay?
Go, go, go.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Hey, there you are.
What took you so long?
Which one is mine?
Oh, God. You know I don't like champagne.
Oh, yeah.
What did they put in your drink?
Bryce!
No, no, no, no.
Please, please.
Let me see your notebook. Let me see it.
God, Bryce, it's just so—
I'm-I'm so sorry.
You lied to me.
I'm just as much a stranger as everyone else.
Was it me you were seeing when we had sex?
Answer me. Was it me you were seeing?
I'm so, so sorry.
Look, this face blind shit.
I can't deal with it anymore.
Find yourself another jerk to wear a tie.
Bryce.
Hello.
Happy birth day, A nna.
Who is this?
DIcfn't my number show up?
You really look drop dread gorgeous tonight, Anna.
I know your face.
I've seen you before.
You don't know my face. You don't know anyone's face.
If I changed my shirt, you couldn't tell me from your own father.
You're the only one I don't need to hide from, Anna.
No, no, that wasn't me. But maybe I'm that guy there, to your right. To your right.
No, to your right, Anna!
Listen to what I'm saying!
Please don't do this.
You saw me doing those things.
No one has ever seen me before.
You're the only one that can stop me, Anna, so make it happen!
Or I'll have to make you smile.
Smile from ear to ear.
Please, don't do this!
Such a pretty smile...
it will make me cry.
I'm calling the police.
Go ahead. I ha ve to go anyway.
Your friend's growing impatient.
Francine?
Nina?
Francine?
Nina?
Francine!
Fran cine. Fran cine!
What the hell?
Nina. Nina!
Anna? What's happening?
Anna, Anna, what's happening?
He's here. He just called me from my phone. Where's Francine?
She was dancing with Mr.
"12-Out-of-IO" just a moment ago.
We have to find her. We have to find her. He's here.
All right, I'll call the police.
Francine!
Oh, my God. Nina.
Anna.
Anna!
Set up a perimeter and comb the area.
I'll deal with the paperwork.
Okay. You got me.
I confess.
Come on, you're one scratch away from a perfect DNA match.
Sam.
What is violet, striped, bloody and floating in the crapper?
She wanted to get married to anyone.
Why didn't he pick me?
The man she was dancing with, did you... see his face?
No. Only from behind.
Can you describe him to me?
No.
I'll get somebody to take you home.
Oh, Nina.
We'll meet tomorrow.
Here. You take care of yourself, chica.
Your boyfriend is not answering his phone.
We're still trying to get a hold of him.
You said you argued.
What was that about?
He found out that, uh...
I was faking him.
Bryce?
You're standing on Bryce's jacket.
Sorry.
It's my phone.
He called me on that phone before Francine—
Is that the jacket Bryce was wearing this evening?
Yes, but—
No, it's not Bryce.
I know him.
Besides, he called me that night I was on the bridge.
That's a little trick we're gonna have to ask him about.
Lanyon. Kerrest.
No. He's gone, but guess what we just looked in.
So, let me get this straight.
He strings us for a year, and bingo... we get all this juicy evidence in one night?
I'll chew on that once we get a DNA sample on this Bryce guy.
I just put out a warrant for his arrest.
Until then...
I'm not letting her out of my sight, okay?
I want her totally insulated.
I'll talk to the D.A. About the tie.
I won't get anything before
Monday. You know the drill.
I'll have her back
Monday morning.
Do you trust me?
Let's pack your things.
We're heading out of town.
Rosemary. How are you?
Everyone knows you?
Everyone knows everyone on Koel Island. Hey.
Good morning.
Just one doctor, one ATM, one mail box. It really is another world.
Where are the other children?
That's the whole school.
Mrs. Hay worth. She teaches all the grades together.
She must be
103 by now.
You went there?
Mm-hm.
Didn't turn out too bad... till you had to play football.
They've arrested Bryce.
He denies everything.
He says someone must have slipped the phone into his pocket.
We'll know soon enough. They're testing his DNA against the tear sample.
Here.
Thank you.
How are you holding up?
I don't know.
It's not just that people's faces have changed.
It's like...
I had to wait... until I didn't recognize myself to know who I really am.
Close your eyes.
That's how you looked when I first saw you at the hospital.
Please, don't open them just yet.
I got a call when they brought you in.
You were out cold. I looked down at you like I look down at Jane Does every day.
I don't know.
It's like
I knew you.
Even though I'd never seen your face.
I know it sounds kinda wacko.
As wacko as not recognizing your own father.
I can do wacko.
Anna.
Anna.
Calm down, Anna, it's okay. It's me.
Anna, it's me, Kerrest.
Don't you recognize me anymore?
You've shaved?
Yes.
Anything that makes the face stand out, makes it easier to identify.
Oh, God, I was such a fool.
Don't.
Don't you get it?
It's not you.
It's just a trick of my screwed up brain!
You're nothing special.
You're just another face.
No.
It's you.
It's still you.
It's still you.
Hey, Lanyon.
And they're absolutely sure?
I'll talk to you later.
The DNA is negative.
Bryce is not the killer.
Next time you have a bad dream, I'll—
I'll just leave you to it.
My dreams.
I can recognize faces in my dreams.
Hypnotism is like a carnival mirror.
It distorts the truth as much as reveals it.
Or it could have devastating consequences on your psyche.
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.
On the count of three...
I want you to close your eyes... and travel back in your memories.
You can rewind... pause, fast forward as you wish.
I'm counting to three now.
One two three.
Anna, I want you to go back... to the moment before your fall.
Is there anybody there with you?
His face is...
It's hazy.
I can't make out his features.
Her impairment is causing a block.
I can't get through it.
Not even with hypnosis.
She knows.
She knows who she is.
Anna? I want you to fuse the hazy impression...
with your attacker's face.
Can you tell me if you've seen him before?
On the street.
Near your home.
Yes.
Hiya.
Ask her if she saw him the night he killed Francine.
Slow the hell down.
I can't read your lips.
The evening of her birthday.
Anna, was he there at your birthday?
Yes.
Anna, did you see him through the two-way mirror in the line-up?
Yes. He's behind the mirror.
Who? Who, Anna? Who's behind the mirror?
But...
Anna, who is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey.
Anna, what is it?
He kissed me.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, he kissed me.
Anna, are you all right?
It's okay.
Lydia, I need warrants on all six perps from the fast fine-up.
I want 'em now.
Make yourself at home. No one knows you're here. I'll call you when we get 'em.
Be careful.
Once all this is over...
I'm gonna take you back to Koel Island.
You promise?
I promise.
What about the DNA?
The tests came back negative.
Four out of six.
None of them is our guy, Sam.
We're just jerking off here.
Fine, go ahead. Flush your career if you want.
You know what I think? I think you and
Tearjerk Jack have something in common.
You're both in love with her, and that's the only reason she's still alive.
- You coming or not?
- I'm gonna check on something.
"The lovers. It's too late to turn back.
It's time to make the right choice. "
Hey, it's Anna.
Bryce called and he wants to meet up and... and I guess I just owe him that. So, anyway.
The address of where I'll be—
Hello, Anna.
It's me.
I know.
Only a one-armed man could tie a knot worse than you.
I caught a cold when I was in the detention cell, believe it or not.
Hey, I'm taking this scumbag with me.
Come on.
Watch your head.
Look, I—
I've acted like a total asshole.
And-and not just the other evening.
For a long time now.
And I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Here's your drinks.
Bryce, you know
I don't like champagne.
I thought it felt right.
Tickets to Vegas.
And after I squeeze out a couple rug-rats... we'll buy some old money pit and... slide contentedly off into senility.
Oh, God. Bryce,
I- I tried.
I really did.
Every time your face kept changing, I tried so hard.
And you know what I found out?
That the way you look or don't look each morning, it really wouldn't matter... if I truly loved you.
Uh, I...
I really didn't expect this... after getting your text message.
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.
Hey, has anybody seen my cell phone?
Bryce!
We have to get out of here.
We've been set up.
I think he's here.
Yo, Columbo.
You got a light?
Five new messages.
Hey, it's Anna. Bryce called and he wants to meet up.
And I guess I just owe him that.
Anyway, the address where I'll be...
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
It's Kerrest.
Leave a message.
Hi, it's Anna.
I can't get...
Thanks for letting me smoke, man.
Relaxed. Not like that pig who took my smoke at the line-up.
You should've smacked that prick.
No smoking.
He's behind the mirror.
Come on, you're one scratch away from a perfect DNA match.
I learned to keep my mouth shut and trust what Lanyon says.
Whatever happens, Anna...
don't let the music stop.
Bryce.
Kiss me.
Think, Lydia. Lanyon was at the line-up.
He had access to all the evidence.
The kid was the perfect smokescreen. It all fits.
No, screw the backup.
We don't have—
Anna! Anna, wait!
Dammit.
Hey, man, where are you going?
Grey shirt.
Black jacket.
Look out!
Anna! Anna!
Anna!
Lanyon, drop it.
Drop the gun, shithead. It's me.
Don't listen to him. He's Lanyon.
I'm Kerrest.
Anna, run!
Stay right there.
Drop the gun.
You drop it.
Lanyon.
Anna.
Where are you?
Anna, it's me.
Anna! Make sure you stay hidden.
Backup's gonna be here.
First, there's a bloody kid...
who sees me off his mother.
You think he'll tell someone?
No. Not a single peep in a year.
The traumatized little fucker.
And then there's you, Anna.
You saw me crying when that's—
That's not a Howe d.
It wa-it was a miracle.
You lost all the other faces because of it.
Oh, no, no, no, you're not doing your little diving act again.
Goddammit, Anna.
The safety catch.
This, Anna, is why
I like blades so much.
Anna!
Anna.
Don't move!
I mean it.
It's me, Anna.
If we stay here, we'll make one hell of a target.
Now, give me back my gun.
Stay where you are.
I mean it.
Anna, on-on
Koel Island... there's a school with half a dozen pupils.
You recognize me now?
What did you promise me before you left? What did you say?
Very good. I could have told
Lanyon about the weekend... but that's something only I can know, right?
Anna.
Look out!
I knew... you were the one...
who'd end this shit.
Give me the gun.
Here.
I guess... you will never take her... to the police ball.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, no, no.
No, no.
Please, don't-don't move.
Don't move, please.
I'm fine.
Seriously, I'm fine.
Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me.
You can't leave me.
Oh, God.
Sh, don't move.
Yc-iTM find someone else.
You'll see.
Yc-iTM find someone else.
You don't have the right to leave me.
I love you.
I know you don't.
I'm just another face in the crowd.
Don't leave.
Stay with me.
No.
Don't leave me!
Don't go!
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, don't go.
I live here now.
The school board accepted my transfer request.
I can identify each of my pupils perfectly.
As well as the handful of people who live here in the off season.
Nina comes to see me from time to time.
She's still single.
I'm just taking it one step at a time.
Sometimes I see a face...
and for a second it's like I see him again.
It's the only way I can keep his face in my memory.
Mommy!
But when I look into her face...
whatever it was that let him get through to me...
he passed it on to her.
And just when I thought
I'd lost e very thing...
I found a face.
One face...
in which I can always read...
love.

Obviously,
I miscalculated a few things.
Eddie! I know you're in there!
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...
The access code you have entered...
...the knife appears at your back?
The access code you have entered is invalid...
Well, I'll tell you one thing...
...I will never let them touch me.
My neighbor, who must have opened his door to complain.
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!
For a guy with a four digit IQ,
I must have missed something.
And I hadn't missed much.
I'd come this close to having an impact on the world.
And now, the only thing
I'd have an impact on...
...was the sidewalk.
You see that guy?
That was me, not so long ago.
What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?
Only a writer. Strangely enough,
nobody believed that
I actually had a book contract.
Well, it's masquerading as a sci-fi novel, but it's really, uh, my own personal manifesto about the plight of the individual in the 21st century.
I sort of created a utopian society where we all sort of...
Uh... Uh...
It's really... it's really...
Uh...
Today was the day
I was gonna kick its ass.
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go...
It was gonna be great.
Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.
That's the key concept.
Don't leave the room.
A few weeks passed this way.
Maybe a few months.
At least I still had Lindy.
Just like that?
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.
I'm surprised.
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.
If you just wait to see what she says...
Eddie.
- What?
- I know how it's going.
I'm your...
I was your girlfriend.
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me.
Partner? Squeeze?
Paramour. Inamorata.
Cleaning lady. Bank.
Be that a...
What's mine is yours, too, and you know I want to share the rest of my life with you.
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.
Why not?
Because it worked out so well for you last time.
It's true, I did marry once.
Right out of college, to Melissa.
I do.
Briefly.
- This isn't working.
Well, even though everything you say is true, I still love you.
I gotta get back to work.
You didn't even tell me what happened.
- I got it.
- You did?
Mmm-hm. I'm an editor.
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.
Thanks.
- OK.
- OK.
She was right. Why stick it out?
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.
We both knew what was beckoning.
The lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Jersey.
My father happy to we/come me into the challenging field
of dental supply inventory.
Eddie Morra.
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten
and put away in mothballs,
is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in-law?
Holy shit, man.
What has it been? Like nine years?
- God!
- Hey.
You all right? You look like you're living on the streets.
What's going on?
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?
Uh, I'm writing. Writing a lot.
Oh, you're still trying to write?
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- How about you?
Are you still dealing, Vern?
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
- When has that ever stopped you?
- So.
- So...
How's Melissa doing?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.
She got some kind of Internet home sales kind of job. Couple kids.
Couple kids. Who's the husband?
He walked out on her, if you really want to know.
But what do you care, man?
You were married, like, five minutes.
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?
Well, it's, uh...
I'm... I'm...
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days and nights, if you really want to know.
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.
Just this once.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.
Brother,
I am light years from that now.
I've been doing, uh, some consulting for a pharmaceutical company.
What, like some offshore lab making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.
No. This is an exclusive product that's coming on stream next year.
They've had clinical trials and it's FDA approved.
All right, just out of curiosity and that's all...
Let's see it.
What's in it?
They've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits.
And you how they say that we can only access 20 percent of our brain?
Well, what this does... it lets you access all of it.
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing into fame and fortune by taking some shiny, brand-new designer drug.
Gant. When?
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.
No, now.
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here, Eddie.
But I really... I really do want to do this again.
So, call me.
And, uh, that's on the house.
I don't want it.
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.
You're welcome.
All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.
How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.
- Smarter than anyone around her.
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie,
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie...
...vomiting on his boss's desk or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.
So who could blame Lindy for dumping me?
In the end, how much worse could it get?
I didn't want to see anybody.
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him.
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.
Like the rent's not low enough!
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon
about what this drug would do.
You could even be a bike messenger and come up with that. Really.
- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic.
Oh, my God.
Listening to her rag...
If I were tripping,
I'd jump out a fucking window.
Hello? Are you listening to me?
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!
And then, I felt it.
I was blind, but now I see.
...running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!
- What's wrong?
- What?
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating, energy-sucking piece of shit who's sponging off your husband.
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out, but my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it?
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?
How do you know I'm in law school?
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry, academically-constipated books about a dead Supreme Court justice.
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... You've been following me.
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.
How did you know that?
I'd seen it before.
Twelve years ago in college.
Sitting on the couch of a TA
I was trying to make,
waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom,
hoping she'd have a condom.
Somehow my unconscious had served that up.
A memory I had never even recorded.
Or was it there the whole time and all I needed was the access?
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
Well, who asked you?
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot, which sort of gives credence to the theory that one of the clerks he had fired actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions.
You could Google the clerk's sons, they'd love to talk to you.
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you something that no one else has...
Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article,
some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes,
mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.
- She didn't have a chance.
- So, what are your suggestions?
We'd really worked on her paper, too.
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.
Home. But it couldn't be my home, could it?
Who would live like this?
Torch it.
But saner heads prevailed.
What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it,
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours, hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?
What was this? A drug for people who wanted to be more anal retentive?
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.
I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.
In short... I was back.
But, something remained.
You're kidding.
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.
- Yes.
- Written by you.
All you have to do is read three pages.
Just read three pages in the next hour and...
...if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.
OK.
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
Call me.
It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.
OK, how did you do this?
I'd really like... Just call me the minute you get in. Call. OK?
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra.
It's not a good time, Eddie.
Uh, hey, Vern, I really just need to talk to you.
Hey... Oh...
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.
Vern, who did this to you?
Trust me, you don't want to know.
Uh...
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.
But the boys in the kitchen are calling it NZT 48.
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...
That doesn't sound very FDA-approved, Vern.
FDA-approved, that's a laugh. You didn't really believe that shit, did ya?
OK, so what do we have here?
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug
scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere
given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years.
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.
All right, we'll talk about it, but I, uh, need a favor first.
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now, so,
I was wondering if you could pop down to the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.
And maybe grab a little... a little breakfast for us.
He knew he had me.
Sure.
From now on,
I'd happily be his errand boy.
Wash his windows, scrub his toilet...
...anything I could do to get my hands on that little clear pill
that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.
Vern?
Vern?
Vern... on, Vern.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, I need to report a...
...a murder.
7B, yes.
OK, I won't.
Took them forever. And the longer
I stood there, the clearer I saw.
Vern had known whoever had done this.
And one guess what they'd been looking for.
But had they found it?
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.
Police Department!
Open the door, please!
Police Department! Open the door!
Open the door, please!
Police! Open the door!
Let's go! Open the door!
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!
I called you guys!
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just actually ran into him on the street
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?
He... Uh, I don't know. He was, um...
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques. Um...
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...
- ...chairs and stuff.
Like, you know, like curlicue leg things.
Yeah?
That is correct. An Edward Morra.
He's here.
Victim's sister.
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.
- Eddie?
- Melissa?
- You were there?
- Um...
Just before. I had run into him on the street and, uh... yeah.
Oh, God. I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff.
I'd better not say any more.
No, no, that's probably a good idea.
So, uh... We should probably, uh, meet or something, right?
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else. I just...
We can't meet, OK?
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then.
No. I don't want that. Please don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?
- When this is over.
- OK, all right.
OK.
You know, something doesn't gel here.
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.
Worth the risk?
What would you do?
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation,
enabled me to finish the book in four days.
A tablet a day
and what I could do with my day was limitless.
I learned to play the piano in three days.
Math became useful.
And fun.
I'm all in.
Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent.
So that Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
There's no arguing with you.
This was great.
So, Mom, I've been doing a little research on Aunt Helen's tumor.
And it's totally clear that anybody with familial adenomatous polyposis should be supplementing platinum-based doublet regiments with eicosapentaeonic acid.
I suddenly knew everything.
About everything.
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?
There aren't. Because there are no safeguards in human nature.
We're wired to overreach.
Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world.
Portugal with this big massive navy.
All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms.
- And the Brits?
Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits.
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well."
We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account.
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.
"Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest."
- Yeah.
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.
Everything I had ever read, heard, seen was now organized and available.
Here it is. Here you go.
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you.
OK, Kevin.
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.
The beach was not nearby.
All my fear, all my shyness, gone.
They've done four basic trials...
But mere lounging wasn't enough.
Only problem?
If I wasn't moving forward,
I felt like I was going to explode.
Come up here because it's beautiful, right?
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Ah!
And then I began to form an idea.
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.
It was much bigger than that.
But it would take money to get there.
In a down market, no one was making much.
But no one had NZT.
In an optimistic scenario, gains of that nature merely would reflect
growth in the economy and would not pose an obstacle...
Armed with Vern's last $800
I made 2,000 in a day.
Next day, 7, 500.
It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.
But banks weren't lending to guys like me.
Hey, Liev.
That's your man in the corner back there.
Yeah.
So, uh, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.
Why?
Because I don't see you before and I don't fucking like you already.
Why do I give you $100,000?
Because...
...I quintupled my money four days in a row.
So you got a fix on the game.
No, not a fix.
I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms.
If you look at column four, this was the first...
You're good.
OK, it's a fix.
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught.
What are you gonna do then?
Well, it's not as if I have a black book with your name in it, if that's what you're talking about.
And besides, I get the strong feeling that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?
I cut you at waist.
Peel your skin up over your head and tie knot in it.
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.
- OK.
- Good luck.
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage
two and a half times your cash at the day trading firm.
I'd been upping the dose for over a week.
It seemed to cut my /earning curve.
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.
But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into.
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.
I was jacked in. Booted up.
At the end of the week, my brokerage account
contained over two million dollars.
Word quickly got out.
You have 19 messages.
Four job offers, my bank raising my line of credit,
a reporter from the New York Post.
Really call me back, Mr. Morra.
No one makes money that fast.
This article's gonna get written with or without you.
And finally,
Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.
Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss and, well, the impossible happened, bud.
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?
Since when do you speak Italian?
Oh.
Self-improvement month.
I guess somebody gave me a wake up call.
I hope you didn't do it for me.
No, I just wanted to apologize to you, Lin.
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all.
The real question is, why did you ever put up with me?
I was in love with you.
So, when does the book come out?
Next year.
How's your new assistant?
- She's good.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.
I'm proud of you. And...
...a little intimidated.
We started up again.
Her place.
My place.
Basically every place.
"In a sizzling three days of trading,"
"the unknown Mr. Morra trumped the market,"
"prompting one top, hedge fund manager to comment""
"He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."'
OK, give me that.
Give me that!
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?
I can't. I don't have a key.
Oh, that's right.
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?
Can it be a new key?
To our place?
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.
Can I walk you to work?
Whatcha doing, hon?
Nothing.
You should sleep.
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
Eddie?
Are you OK?
What are you doing out here?
When's the last time you ate something?
There he is.
Nice article in the Post, buddy.
OK, he is on his way.
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.
One minute, your best friend, the next, you're a leper.
And he needs direct answers. Anything tentative and you've lost him forever.
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.
I'm eating, Kevin.
Hey, are you up for this?
You sure? 'Cause I got a little bit on the line here.
Have a toast point.
- It's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.
He's worth a fortune.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.
- How are ya?
- Eddie.
So, Eddie Morra.
- What's your secret?
- Medication.
I'm on special medication.
OK.
Well, it's a formula with a complex method.
But, of course, research was a component. Massive research.
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought.
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office, and you know what?
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work for a shitty little uptake?
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want in short term holdings so...
...I dispensed with all the hard statistics and I went right to the rumor mill.
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?
Sure. Share prices aren't really based on how a company works.
It's about how mass psychology works.
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.
Well, not everybody understands the patterns.
And that gave me a little bit more of an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.
So then, I went on to door number three.
Are you really implying that you have some sort of ultimate formula?
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.
You don't work in my world.
I'm up to my ass with investment guys and you don't have their half-terrified, half-cocky line of crap which is...
...not to say that
I like yours any better.
But you obviously pick your stocks in a way which I haven't seen before.
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think.
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.
Sure.
These companies aren't the question, are they?
Explain.
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence.
Control the whole power enchilada, but, no, these companies wouldn't get you there in emerging markets.
You would have to... Oh. Whoa.
This must be some big-ass merger you're contemplating.
And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon and Associates.
Who have you been talking to?
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?
Well, you're an amazing con artist, or you're a very smart young man.
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?
The whole world would have to come begging for energy like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel.
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?
Well, you don't want to hear this from some schmuck who needs a ride home.
All right, you get your shot. Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.
I'm at your disposal.
You don't really live here, do you?
Well... Spartans weren't big on amenities.
Yeah, and they eventually got their asses kicked.
I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.
There are moments in life... moments when you know you've crossed a bridge.
Your old life is over.
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.
Wall Street would provide my nest egg, but then how far could I go?
CEO? A global force?
Maybe President.
Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.
Suddenly...
It was another skip.
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?
I got another ten blocks.
And then...
...I was way uptown.
What bar was this?
...black canvas and then they would just drop all the paint...
Yeah. Did you ever meet...
...and then I actually went there and had lunch, I went back.
My friends are rolling...
I heard you like to party.
- Hey, watch it.
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!
A fight? Don't know how to fight.
Or do I?
Ah!
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.
- Like this.
Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.
If you are hit, do not stop.
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.
Off-balancing your opponent
and then using his momentum, take him down.
When it finally stopped,
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.
Is everything OK?
Call me when you get this.
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.
They were hieroglyphs.
- Hello?
- Kevin, this is Eddie.
- Eddie?
- Listen,
- I can't make the meeting today.
- What are you talking about?
I can't come in today, I'm sick.
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now.
He'll never give you this chance again.
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...
What have you been doing for the last day?
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now.
And how am I gonna look if you don't?
- I know, listen, I just...
- Sh. Listen to me.
Pull yourself together.
Get down to the meeting.
- OK, OK.
- I'll be there. I'll be there.
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.
Good to see you again.
Sit down.
What do you know about Hank Atwood?
Atwood, um...
He's an iconoclast, um...
Owns about half of Colorado.
So this is prepared, Eddie?
Uh...
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?
Where was he two years ago?
- Hm?
- Nowhere.
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar.
That was a great leap forward, right?
I'm baffled by this guy.
He comes out of nowhere so strong.
Has me on the run before I can even get to anybody in his camp.
Beats me out of two properties, investing in countries with no oil.
Places I'd never go near...
We're here in front of the hotel where a woman,
identified as Maria Winberg, was found dead in her room last night,
a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg was a well-known socialite and model...
...but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons
and an eyewitness reported seeing a man leaving the scene...
...help me convince him that I can raise his game. Got any ideas?
What do you think?
- Hm?
- Um...
...hotel has adequate security cameras...
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us.
Pardon me, one second.
Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?
Was it even me?
Eddie? This is Melissa.
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?
Because that stuff is dangerous.
Melissa?
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?
- I really need to talk to you.
- We're talking now.
No, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?
- You can't see me, Eddie.
- No, no...
- Eddie, please.
- Please, please come, please come, I...
It's important, I really need to know what you're talking about.
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.
Vernon's other clients.
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi, may I please speak with Jerry Brady?
- Jerry's in the hospital.
- He's what?
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
- Uh, no. No, he's not.
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.
Now he's in the ICU.
OK, please give him my best.
Thank you.
Of all the people I called... three were dead and the rest were sick.
Hello? Hello?
Watch it, man!
Did you see that?
Hey!
Go! Go!
Eddie.
Melissa.
Hey.
Don't tell me I look good,
'cause I know.
I didn't want you to see me this way.
You look good.
Oh, I, uh...
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.
NZT will do that to you.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
No.
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,
I was like, down the hatch.
And it was. It was amazing.
I read Brian Greene's
The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and I understood it.
My work rate increased just insanely overnight and my boss started to hate me.
They offered me his job and then... and then I got scared.
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash.
I stopped taking it.
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.
Throwing up.
So I went back to Vernon.
He told me about all the people that were dying.
How much have you been taking, Eddie?
I've been taking a lot.
Well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe...
Maybe this is a different batch.
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?
- Just finish your story.
- Well...
...I didn't take any more and I didn't die.
But after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes.
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow.
That was two years ago.
And I haven't been the same since.
Do you have some left? Good.
You go home and you take it. You take the dose down, but you don't just stop.
You'll die if you just stop.
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning.
I have to go.
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.
I have to go.
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm here now. Oh!
- Good.
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.
Check. Check.
Are you out of your mind?
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?
All right. You're right.
Look, we just need to go to a bank...
What do you got there?
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
It's something good, huh?
I feel good, man.
What's in this stuff?
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin.
You full of shit, Eddie baby.
Lindy. I wouldn't have let him in, but...
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.
I'm sick.
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...
I need you to get...
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?
They're... it's...
I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...
...has been a drug.
Well, it was supposed to be legal.
I have a... a supply stashed.
You want me to go get it.
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.
I'll go to your apartment.
It's not... in my apartment.
I moved it.
OK, so where did you move it?
In my house.
Unbelievable.
Hey, have you got it?
Yeah.
There's someone following me.
Are you sure?
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me and he's making every turn I'm making.
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?
Babe, what's happening?
We're stopped dead.
He's getting out.
Eddie, he's walking over here.
Lindy?
Oh, God!
Ow!
Help! Help!
This man's...
This man's chasing me!
He followed me from my building. I don't know him.
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone.
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?
What are you doing, man?
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?
I'm stuck. He'll find me.
OK, stop talking. Don't move.
- He killed two guys.
- What?
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...
Can he see you?
No.
Not yet.
I don't know what to do.
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills.
Why?
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife.
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds.
And you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.
He's getting closer.
Lindy, I love you.
Hey!
Now turn to me...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Ah!
- Daddy!
Ah!
Eddie. Here.
It's gonna be OK.
We've got to get out of here. Eddie?
You OK?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again,
'cause I can take care of us now.
I'm sure you can.
I can make us safe.
I'm back, OK?
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.
No. It's not you.
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.
I wasn't, when I was on it.
I did things I would never do.
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.
Yes, they were.
No, the way it works...
I know how it works. I get it.
I totally get it.
You feel invincible.
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine.
The things we'll be able to do.
Where we'll be a year from now.
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live.
Well, you might have to live it without me.
Look, I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and that... To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it.
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...
Look, I have a plan. I swear.
I'm gonna get off it.
OK.
I hope you do.
Looking for me?
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?
I was under the impression our business was settled.
I want some more of that stuff.
Or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.
This guy was not going away.
A few pills would buy me some time.
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.
Until I found a more... permanent solution.
Unless you see a real threat, I never want it known that I have any security.
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me.
Never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself.
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't The Matrix.
You have to know, Eddie,
I wrote you off.
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.
You're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die.
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.
I mean, I didn't know who or what
I was talking to.
A hundred and five. That's who you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
Mmm-hm.
I sent over my revised projections.
I didn't ask for your projections.
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...
I already have.
As a matter of fact...
...I fired a few people over your projections.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You're relieved that you know things my team missed.
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...
Two months after I'd started NZT,
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them.
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent.
That makes both of us very happy campers.
I found that if
I maintained an even dose,
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,
the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?
In this jacket?
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.
Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out.
Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, yes, but, the exact method of delivery to the brain... Darts at a dartboard.
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six.
I found that we can cut costs
30 percent and, um...
Excuse me one second.
I thought we straightened this out,
Detective.
This isn't about Vernon Gant,
Mr. Morra.
What is this about?
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person.
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.
Enter Morris Brandt... the most lethal lawyer in New York.
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.
Just between us, were you there?
I don't remember.
I don't want to make concessions to you...
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood
had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out.
How do you know this?
The governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course, information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought.
Go on.
If you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008, five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice.
Jesus, he looks frail.
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?
When this is over? I don't know.
You haven't given me the answer.
You haven't asked the question.
Well, given the scale of my contribution, let's say 45.
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.
You know, Eddie...
...it may be on your mind that you're not gonna continue to work for me any more.
This has been the learning experience of my life.
I hope it has. I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me.
On to the next.
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.
That you would even think that would only show me how unprepared you are to be on your own.
- I mean, you do know you're a freak.
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance, or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote your life script, a gift not earned.
You do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers.
You're careless with those powers.
You flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund.
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs.
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers. You haven't done the time in that first marriage to the girl with the right father.
You think you can leap over all in a single bound.
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way to a seat at that table. You don't know how to assess your competition because you haven't competed.
Don't make me your competition.
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you.
You'll be wanting a few toys.
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.
What I needed was a bunker.
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance,
vault grade pneumatic doors.
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system.
A fortress with a hell of a view.
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.
I'll take it.
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.
- Next week, you can go fuck yourself!
Not that you'd feel anything.
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police.
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.
Getting smarter!
Obviously, this could not go on,
but there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can't solve.
And tomorrow at nine,
Atwood would sign the papers.
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?
There was all last night to tell us that.
- Anything?
- I'll call him again, sir.
OK, the decision could have changed. That makes sense.
The discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.
Oh, based on your charts and projections.
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick.
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible.
Of course.
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning.
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests.
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract.
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.
I realize this is a useless platitude, but if there's anything that we can do, please don't hesitate to tell us.
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible, Mrs. Atwood.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.
There won't be a proxy.
No, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?
Well, he'd better get better.
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.
Well, why be surprised?
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?
At /east I had some.
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.
Only my money. And my liberty.
I've been all over with them.
We can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line up.
OK.
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get.
It's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.
Who was out there?
The woman's husband?
A hotel maid?
Was this how it was all going to end?
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?
I did.
...market's been mixed today.
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that.
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
Have you been talking to anyone?
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.
I know you're not stupid, Eddie, but don't make the classic smart person's mistake.
Thinking no one's smarter than you.
Where the hell have you been? This is the second time you've turned to vapor.
I was in the building, I was getting coffee. Why, has there been movement?
Yeah, there's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.
He wasn't playing us.
He's dying.
What do you know about this?
I was less than usually equipped to answer.
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.
Excuse me.
You're not excused.
What? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?
Was it Brandt or someone else?
The police station?
A coatroom?
Mr. Morra.
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?
Hope not, so let me know when you know.
All right, I'm gonna ask you again,
Eddie. What do you know about this?
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.
What? What about Atwood?
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo.
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!
What you're about to say is bullshit.
I know there's something you're hiding from me.
I smell it on you. Right now,
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!
Carl.
Eddie! Eddie!
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,
more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.
None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.
This is a difficult time.
We would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.
We're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests
and hoping for the best.
Thank you.
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.
Open up.
Come on.
Open the door.
And so, here I am.
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.
But this choice would at /east be mine.
But we're instinctive creatures.
We want to live.
So my foggy brain tried to remember where one tablet of NZT might be.
It was possible.
And possible was enough.
Hey, Eddie.
Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?
I don't like being down to this last one.
You don't even know how to use it.
You don't appreciate it.
You see, I dissolve in a solution.
You shoot it. It goes straight into the blood and brain.
Lasts much longer.
So...
You gonna tell me where the rest is?
I'm plumb out.
You know, these guys are gonna find it.
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.
Question is, which is gonna come first?
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?
This is a waste of my time, you know?
I'm getting out of this side of the business.
I'm branching out.
I'm starting import-export company.
Very exciting stuff.
I got a lot on my plate.
You're lucky I'm here.
Back in the old times, I might peel your skin back. Fillet you.
"Fillet." It's a nice word.
I didn't know this before.
Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary.
But then I discovered this thing, Google.
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?
I had no idea.
I don't believe it.
I gotta see this for myself.
I'm dubious. It's another nice word.
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too.
Don't worry, everything's sterilized.
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang.
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie.
What?
- Ah!
Not much of a triumph, was it?
Because I would die here, too.
Only NZT could help me and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream.
Victor!
What?
Ah!
Hey!
Ah!
Ah!
Victor?
Victor?
Victor?
The police would later note
that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.
Of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.
And the night was still young.
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss.
I know I certainly am.
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, trying to save his life, why is he dead?
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in with his life-saving medication?
His boss was dead.
So, I didn't matter now.
But he did not appreciate that Morris
Brandt had kept the pills for himself.
And it was all still possible.
Actually, no, there's no more tickets.
Yeah, I know. An overbooked fundraiser.
That's a first.
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.
Oh, that's much better.
- Great job.
- Thank you, sir.
Hi, Mr. Morra.
Edward!
I think we're looking at a second overflow event.
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think they're even gonna try a second debate.
- Great.
- Hold on.
A guy from
Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.
Give him his two crappy little minutes.
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.
Finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on.
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.
What a surprise. They told me somebody from Eiben was coming.
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm moving out of the energy business.
Come on. That's like Hef moving out of the mansion.
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.
No. No. Well, they really keep me hopping here.
Well, it's gonna pay off,
Senator Morra.
The Senate. Who knows...
Everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain.
Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.
We could have been partners.
So, Eiben makes NZT.
Well, it'll never officially exist.
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you.
Oh, I think maybe you do.
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get any more.
You sure about that?
They shut down your lab this morning.
Eddie. I just want to help you, that's all.
Keep you supplied.
No disruption in service.
Give you peace of mind.
That's all.
And in return, I do what?
Get a little advice, maybe.
I won't be bothering you much at first.
And later. What are you gonna be bothering me with?
Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.
But hey, I think they're achievable.
And what if I don't like your ideas?
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light.
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even go there right now.
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...
...and healthy. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.
After you, Senator.
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.
Give us a second.
What are you doing? Do you want to be President of the United States
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.
You don't think some smartass on NZT might have two or three or even four labs?
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.
I thought better of it.
See, once you know what's in it, you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.
I'm off it, Carl.
Well, on it or off it, there's no scenario where you're not working for me.
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?
Last year you traded
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?
Blank checks from Dubai.
Dumping in Chile. Disappeared officials.
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.
There's no way you can be making accusations like that and be walking around alive.
That you would even think that shows me how unprepared you are to fight me.
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?
That I kept absolutely nothing?
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be.
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.
He has 60 feet to stop.
He doesn't have room.
- What van?
I see everything, Carl.
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else.
What makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?
How do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?
What are you doing? You get your hands off me. What are you doing?
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're gonna need to get that replaced.
But you already knew that.
You know, you should really be glad about this.
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch.
Maybe we should cool off.
Talk again.
I don't think so.
Don't forget to vote.
Edward.
You good?
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.
- How's your day going?
- Ah. I've had better.
I still can't deal with that haircut.
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street.
Well, I'm a new man.
I've already ordered.
What?
ENGLISH US - PSDH
(man) O 'Rourke, Dylan. Age, 28.
Cause of death?
High speed car crash.
Very romantic, very sensational.
Very James Dean.
[crash]
[thundering]
[footsteps]
Here how I keep track of time, Dylan.
Every October
16th, I find you here.
Ten years of clockwork.
[clap of thunder]
What do you want with me, detective?
I'm just looking out for you.
It still doesn't make sense.
Her ring was missing.
She never took that ring off.
The-the cabby--
There's a lot of illegal cabs out there, Dylan.
We've gone over all this.
It was an accident.
It was no accident.
I need to find out what really happened.
Go home.
[bell tolling]
Denial's the first stage.
Elvis. Take that guy.
Some people actually believe he still exists.
Yeah, denial.
Christ, I can't believe Elvis is dead.
Then depression.
Shit, Elvis is dead.
What am I gonna do?
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
And then anger.
Why?
Why did he have to die?
And finally, acceptance.
All right. It makes sense.
It's all God's will.
The king is dead.
Rest his soul.
Do you know what
I'm saying, Mr. Stark?
You know, your family and friends probably just can't accept the fact that you're dead.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Frank Sinatra was a no show at Dean Martin's funeral.
Can't get much closer than the Rat Pack.
I think it's time to call it, lad.
Just five more minutes.
For Jesus sake, Dylan, no visitors are comin'.
Bastards are probably already out spending his money.
Tomorrow'll be a big turnout though.
Young kid's about your age.
Actually, he's a year younger.
You knew him?
He was the quarterback on my high school football team.
We hooked up for 27 touchdowns one senior year.
So you'll see all your old friends tomorrow.
I-I haven't seen any of them in a long time.
All the more reason to catch up.
You ever fantasize about, you know, watching your own funeral?
Of course.
Doesn't everybody?
My father always said you can only really tell a man's character by who shows up at his funeral.
That's a little late by that point.
One of life's great fucking ironies.
But Dylan, if you've got to wait 'til your funeral to find out what makes you tick, my heart aches for you.
Rest in peace.
Would you like some tea, Dylan?
Tea? For Jesus, Liz!
He'll have a shot of whiskey.
No. I-I don't drink.
Better you than me.
Liz, I'm going to decorate the inside of me glass.
You give the fucking insomniac a tall tumbler of warm milk.
Is your family in the city?
I don't talk to them anymore.
Uh. Liz, he never puts that bloody thing down.
It's a sentimental thing.
The yo-yo almost always comes back to you.
Reminds me of the mistakes I've made.
Mistakes. We all make mistakes.
There's a difference in mistakes and regrets.
Oh.
Decko gave me that.
The hands are for friendship, the heart is for love, and the crown is for loyalty.
Someone close to me had the same ring.
And if the heart is pointed inward, it means your heart is taken.
Shite. They'd better go get me Viagra.
[laughs]
[panting]
I like him. Don't get me wrong. It's just that--
This genetic Viagra is full of shite.
I can't quite figure him out.
Oh, Liz. He's just a lad, that's all, who needs some guidance.
Don't feel sorry for him-
There are people who float through life wantin' to be alone.
It doesn't bother them that they don't affect anything or anyone.
Dylan probably feels sorry for us.
He doesn't have to be like others.
[guy on video] And, uh, so you guys've been together for a while, but you guys didn't really like each other when you first met.
That's true. Yeah.
Freshman year, we met.
It kinda, we didn't hang out as much, and, you know, that kinda changed probably--
Different friends and then--
And then we--remember that party we went to?
Yeah. That's when we probably started hanging out there.
Yeah, and then we made out that night.
[laughs]
So, what do you guys have planned after graduation?
We're going to college together.
Uh, so, keeping it alive, huh?
Yeah, forever.
Forever.
Shit!
Forever.
Someone close to me had the same ring.
Dylan.
[knocking on door]
Dylan-
[knocking]
Please, open up.
I know you're in there.
Dylan, open the door.
Lei' me in.
I wanna help you through this.
I'm missing you-
Dylan! Dylan, open please.
Please.
[crying]
What, are you nervous?
We'll take care of him.
Go on. It's all right.
Ew. Does he work here?
I thought he'd be a big shot lawyer or something by now. How pathetic.
Is that who I think he is?
You gotta be kidding me.
I haven't seen him in years, man.
I thought he was dead.
Didn't he use to date Natalie Penner?
Natalie Penner. That's what fucked him up.
Fucking chick, man.
His best friend, Steve.
Yeah. Don't you remember?
Dylan and Natalie were together and then Steve, than fucking rat snake.
Yeah, he just sharked her.
[no audio]
[cell phone ringing]
And the yo-yo returns.
So, did you see some of your old pals?
Some of them.
Did you talk to any of them?
No.
Listen to me, son.
Here's your opportunity to rebuild some relationships.
Some of those relationships
I'd just rather bury.
Hi!
Hi.
Are you two married?
No. Not yet.
So, when are you getting married?
In May.
Congrats. May what?
May, the day never come.
I'm just trying to get my career going.
I just don't really have much time for all that wedding type shit.
Now, don't get me wrong. She's a great girl.
They just think what I'm thinking.
So, where are you working?
Wright and Price law firm. Trying to get partnership.
There's some thick coin.
I, uh, couldn't believe when I heard about Shawn. It was just--
I don't know. It feels like yesterday he was--
When he was throwing touchdowns to Dylan?
Speaking of Dylan, does anyone know what he's been up to lately?
Dylan!
Steve. How are you?
Real good, man.
Christ, it's, uh, been a long time.
Shit!
Oh.
Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to have an extra one, would you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Have two.
Thank you.
You--y-you work here?
Yeah, I do. And you?
I've made partner at Axler, Wright and Price law firm. Thick coin.
So, who's the ghost?
Old boyfriend.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
How long has it been since you've seen that poltergeist?
Ten years ago.
You make that sound like eternity.
Yeah, a lot's happened since then.
A lot of waiting?
A lot of waiting.
He's special.
He was special.
So, uh, this--
This, uh, you know, job get you laid?
What's that?
Excuse me. Dylan, there's a flower delivery out back.
I could use your help.
See you, Steve.
Catch you later,
Dylan.
Natalie.
Hi.
When did you start smoking?
Oh, ten years ago, but it seems like--
Like yesterday.
Yeah.
[laughs]
You know this is the seventh death from our class?
You'd think we'd run into these people at weddings, but instead you get, "You're cordially invited to a funeral."
Are you still in med school?
Did you finish?
No, I didn't start.
I'm a nurse.
Nurse?
You've probably seen some of my patients.
I'm really not that good yet.
You remember the finger I sprained during the Carson Heights game and you, um, taped the wrong one?
I can't lift anything with this now.
I'm so sorry.
No. I'm-I'm kidding.
[laughs]
Oh!
I should go back inside, you know.
Steve can't stand smokers.
Natalie.
Ten years have, uh, really done you justice.
Thanks.
Done you justice?
I'll always be grateful if you got a lot to clean up after the party.
Good indication you've got friends.
No wonder my place is so clean all the time.
I bet if it was you in that box today, you'd have the same turnout.
You have to be somebody.
I've been gone too long, and people forget.
You'd be surprised what death brings out in people.
No, it'd be another Mr. Stark.
No, bollocks. It'd be bigger than Jack Kennedy's funeral.
Let's have my funeral then.
All the Guinness you can drink says nobody shows up at my wake.
You serious?
Yeah. We'll-we'll put my name in the obituaries. Easy as that.
[chuckles]
It reminds me of the good old days.
You, you faked a funeral?
April Fool's day, 1975.
Me and me Da got my brother to believe I was run over by a tractor.
He comes into the church.
I popped out of the coffin.
Scared the living shite out of him.
[laughs]
What did he do?
He beat the shite out of me.
[chuckles] Didn't talk to me for six years.
Whatever happened at throwing eggs at houses and burning bags and dog crap?
The Irish don't mess around when it comes to pranks.
(Decko) O'Rourke, Dylan Age 28
He was a graduate of Pennington High School and member of the City
Championship football team.
Cause of death?
High speed car crash.
Very romantic.
Very sensational.
Very James Dean.
Undoubtedly the ugliest corpse I've ever seen.
You probably would look better six feet under.
What about the high speed car crash?
I'm supposed to be a m-mangled wreck. Right?
Mm. Internal injuries.
Happens all the time.
Okay. If someone wants to touch my hands, they'll be warm.
For fuck's sake, Dylan, it isn't a petting zoo.
All right.
Nobody will touch you-
Just don't yawn or you'll give some poor bastard a heart attack.
You sure your parents don't read the obituaries?
No, they don't.
Even if they did, they wouldn't be here.
Show time, Dracula.
[train whistling]
Where's the money, Charlie?
Answer me, you junkie bitch!
Ah. For God's sake, Dylan, it's getting late.
That was a stupid idea.
You win the bet.
All the apple juice you can drink on me.
Dylan.
Sleep tight.
[door hinges squeaking]
Decko.
Dylan O'Rourke.
What the fuck did you do?
Where the fuck are you going? Huh?
You're watching me, huh?
I bet you're watching me right now.
You're probably wondering who the fuck I am, right?
Hey, you know what?
You know what the two shortest verses in the Bible are?
It's only two-two words. Just two words.
Isn't that amazing?
It's only got two words.
Were you friends with him?
No.
So, how'd you know him?
I read the obituaries.
How'd he die anyway?
Car crash.
Yeah, they say better to be late, you know, in this life than early in the next.
Do you make a habit out of going to memorial services?
Well, you know, I'll be honest to you.
I try to go as many as possible.
You know, during the week 'cause it's kinda great therapy, right?
I mean, you should really try it.
You should. If you're ever feeling depressed, just go to a funeral.
And no matter how sad or how low or had bad things are, it's never as final as this, right?
You wanna die?
I wanna go without a clear conscience, you know.
I wouldn't-wouldn't wanna go without that.
Not 'til I'm ready.
I don't wanna-don't wanna go without making amends.
Red roses, well.
[sighs]
Dylan, I guess you were special.
I'll leave you two alone.
[hinges squeak]
[Decko singing] I have me good looks and a wee bit of money

At the end of the year ♪

Of a laugh ♪

[cheering]
Ah, all the black stuff I can drink.
Well, I thought you didn't drink, lad.
Today's a good day as any to start.
All right. So, this weird girl shows up.
She shows up, she starts talking about, uh, the shortest verse in the Bible.
That's the best mass to attend.
In and out, short and sweet.
And suddenly
I-I hear this voice.
The weird girl's voice?
No. Natalie's voice.
Natalie?
The old flame?
Natalie's there alone and she leans over the coffin.
I can't be sure, but I think she said ”I love you.”
[whispers]
I miss you.
She did?
Well, I--she whispered it, you know.
But it was "I-I something you."
So, you didn't hear the "love" part.
Not really.
So, she could've said "I hate you."
Possibly, but why would she drive all the way down to a funeral home to say "I hate you"?
Did she bring flowers?
Dozen red roses.
Not yellow or pink. Red.
[chuckles]
Your old flame came to your wake, Dylan.
She brought roses!
That says a lot about your character.
Yeah, maybe.
Right, I show up at her door?
Knocking? She'd be furious.
She thinks I'm dead.
Your own brother wouldn't talk to you in six years.
He's your brother.
You should see her.
Seems to me she was sent to you by the big guy himself.
Hey, one last thing.
I got you a wee little present, so we can all remember you.
On your way home tonight, stop by the cemetery and check out that empty plot 35-E.
I got you your own grave.
Now you Te really dead, lad.
Don't go in there.
Excuse me?
[hinges squeak]
Hey, asshole.
You're in the wrong place.
There's nothing here to steal.
Just put down the gun.
It's Dylan.
Dylan?
Dylan O'Rourke.
Dylan?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
Dylan?
Are you sure you're here for the right person?
I knew you were coming. I just didn't,
I just didn't know it'd be so soon.
I-I'm sorry. I can-I can explain everything.
Just tell me where you're gonna take me.
What are you talking about?
Just tell me where you're gonna take me.
No, I-I don't understand.
I'm not taking you anywhere.
I need to know where I'm going.
I think you're a little confused.
I'm not confused.
I know what you are.
I know what you are.
Fuck!
Where's the money, Charlie?
[shouts]
Where's the fucking money?
Who the fuck are you? Huh?
Who the fuck is this, Charlie? Huh?
Answer me, you fucking junkie bitch!
What? He's just a friend of yours?
He's not my friend.
He's my guardian angel.
Guardian fucking angel, huh?
Well, we got a little problem here.
I'm an atheist.
I don't believe in little faggoty angels.
Go ahead, shoot him.
He's already dead.
Shoot him.
Just shoot him!
[gunshot]
[gunshot]
[panting]
What the fuck?
Idiot.
I told you you were dead.
Who was that guy at your place?
Terrence?
He works for some guy
I owe 20 grand to.
L-I-I- should be,
I should be dead.
Should be?
You are dead.
So us poor trapped souls.
I've always kinda been obsessed with dying, and it's my death.
I'm not ready to go, yet.
Why aren't you ready?
Family?
No, no family left.
Friends or something?
No, never even been in a carpool lane.
I got nothing.
As soon as I'm clean, I'm gonna go with you. I promise.
I'm not actually dead.
You are dead.
You just don't know it.
Excuse me.
Can you see me?
Yeah.
Okay. You satisfied?
Wait, wait, wait.
Could you, could you touch me?
Excuse me?
Just-just touch my face.
Case. I mean, does that, does that prove to you that I'm not dead?
You're in denial.
I mean, she-she saw me, she touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?
How could I interact with people?
Because you believe it so intensely that you've become real to yourself and to others.
Believing is seeing.
So, anybody could be dead.
Like-like-like this, that guy?
Could be.
Walking dead are all around us.
I feel bad for you.
You're just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.
So, how do I get out of Purgatory?
Well, first of all, you need to accept that you're dead.
Then I think you have one more chance to make things right.
[echoing laughter]
[loud thumping]
What's it like?
What's what like?
What made you die.
Are you crazy?
Don't call me that.
I am not crazy.
You just leave me the fuck alone until you're ready to deal with who the fuck you are, okay?
Then you can come find me.
(Charlie) You are dead.
You just don't know it.
[woman singing]
Hey, fuck Charlie.
Fuck us instead.
Oh. What's wrong, Dylan?
What'd you say?
How do you know my name?
I didn't say anything.
Come on, sweetie.
Let me call you whatever you want us to call you.
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie, let me in.
Charlie? Open the door.
Oh! Fuck!
Oh, no.
Charlie. Hey.
Wake up.
Somebody help!
Come on.
Fuck, come on!
Charlie!
[monitor beeping]
What are you doing, Charlie?
And where are you right now?
You said you didn't wanna leave like this, right?
You're not dead, and
I'm not, either. Okay?
I'm gonna be around for a little while.
[heartbeats]
[nurse over PA.
] Visiting hours are now over.
Sir, visiting hours are over.
It's time to leave.
Dylan?
Natalie.
Oh, God.
I'm-I'm so sorry.
I can explain everything.
That funeral, we faked it.
I'm not dead.
I mean, obviously,
I'm not dead.
I'm really sorry.
I know. I know you faked your funeral.
And you're not dead.
Decko?
Did he invite you to the funeral?
He didn't want you to be alone.
How do you know Charlie?
Are you on her emergency contact list?
I'm kinda all she has right now.
[Natalie laughing]
Yeah, but after that,
Remember when we broke into the rec center and we went skinny dipping?
Yes.
That was fun. We were starving, and we went to that place.
Burger place with those huge burgers.
Yeah.
Bacon and fried egg and there was, like, ham on it.
[laughs] I don't like the special sauce.
Can you hear mine?
Yeah.
Can you hear it?
[laughs] Didn't we go?
Didn't we run out of gas?
Oh, yeah. It was that night.
We ran out of gas.
We called, we had to, we called--
AAA
[cell phone rings]
That was fun.
Oh, hold on.
Hi, honey.
Oh, no, no, I'm just busy at work.
I'll be home soon.
Okay. All right. Bye.
Dylan.
I would've gone to your funeral regardless.
[monitor beeping]
[monitor alarm sets 0177
[monitor beeping normally]
Are you okay?
[whispers]
I'm okay.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I knew I'd find you here.
It's where you always come when you wanna be alone.
Yeah. Mm-hm.
Oh, my God.
What do you say?
Yes.
I haven't been here since we graduated.
Do you blame me for that night?
Every time I saw you,
I thought of what happened.
I've missed you.
I missed you every day for ten years.
You're in love with someone else!
No. I love Steve.
But I'm in love with you.
Dylan?
I brought Dylan a couple of my famous roast beef sandwiches.
Can I leave them with you?
Sure.
Good. We can have a smoke then.
How long have you been married, Liz?
Um, almost 25 years.
He's a little much at times, but no matter how dirty his laundry, he's mine.
Oh. I do carry this little DUI photo to remind him what an asshole he can be when he's drunk.
[laughs]
I would've married
Decko since I met him, but he made me wait.
Why?
I was with the man I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with.
And I fell in love with his best friend.
Over time I questioned myself, and now and then I still wonder if I chose the right partner.
So, you went back to Decko?
No. I stayed with Decko.
He was the best friend.
Decko?
Mm-hm.
What happened to--
Patrick Keating?
Mm, oh.
My beautiful ghost.
I imagine he thinks of me, that there's a candle burning out there somewhere.
Do you love Decko?
Absolutely.
But I do believe it's possible to love two people.
When you're on your deathbed, don't look back on your life with regret.
It is a hard life to live.
Wondering.
Natalie.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Uh, listen.
God, I-I don't even know where to begin.
Really. Um, I just--
[monitor alarm sets 0177
That's Charlie.
What's wrong with her?
[coughing]
You're okay, Charlie.
Just relax.
Hey, you Te okay.
I'm sorry, sir, but you need to step out.
Dylan, I 'Il come and get you-
Has he made his peace with you, yet?
Who?
Dylan.
Never stops thinking about you.
What are you doing here?
I don't know what she has right now.
Where's the money, Charlie?
[clap of thunder]
[thundering]
I thought you were dead.
You shouldn't screw with people like that.
Prank?
It was more of a reality check.
Got that address you wanted.
Listen, you shouldn't go there.
Why?
It's not the guy who took a shot at you you have to be worried about. It's his boss.
Who's his boss?
Just tell me who she owes money to.
I'm sure I can make a deal.
These aren't the type of people you just make deals with.
[tires screeching]
Get some sleep.
Seeing shit that isn't there.
(Decko) How much money are we talking about?
Twenty grand.
You really care about this girl?
You know, I've been the only one to visit her.
Just like she was the only one to visit me.
That's a hell of a lot of money.
How are you gonna get that?
Don't worry about the money.
Look, I don't understand.
You hardly know this girl.
Think of yourself.
Go to college, start your life.
Be fucking selfish for once, can you?
Why--
Why are you doing this?
I have to save somebody.
I'm here to see
Mr. Brennan.
Tell him I'd like to make a deal for Charlie.
So, how do you know Charlie?
Is she a friend of yours?
You could say that.
Now, that's not what
Terrence told me.
He says you're her, uh, guardian angel.
Well, now, Terrence, atheist. Comes back here ranting and raving about some halo, wing-wearing wacko that he puts two slugs into.
I saw the holes in the wall.
He missed twice.
I told you Terrence was a useless piece of shit.
He can't even shoot straight.
So you, you wanna make a deal for Charlie, hm?
It's 20 for her debt.
Goddamn.
I feel like putting a bullet in my own gun just to see if you really are a fucking angel.
Charlie's debt's repaid.
You have my word.
And everybody knows what that means.
Where'd you get that one?
Hi. Have you done it?
Have you made your peace?
I really need you to hurry, okay?
'Cause I'm really ready to go.
I'm ready to go now.
Ready to leave this life. I'm clean.
I just have to ask you something.
This, this ring, it--
I-I found it in the pawn shop.
Brennan said that you pawned it.
Ten years ago.
Did you pawn this?
Answer me. Where did-- Where did you get this, Charlie?
Where did you get this?
There was an accident.
Charlie, the people who were killed were my parents!
This was my mother's.
Who was driving that taxi?
I needed money.
I stole the taxi.
And I picked up the fare.
I lost control.
It was an accident.
You what?
You stole this?
Dylan, I'm so sorry.
Don't you fucking touch me.
What do you need, kid?
I'm looking for
Detective Milano.
Milano? He's not here anymore.
Do you know when he'll be back?
He died five years ago.
I just saw him the other night.
Don't think so.
That--
That-that can't be.
Are you okay?
You seeing shit that isn't there.
Dylan.
Are you okay, lad?
What's the biggest funeral you ever have?
Hm. About ten years ago.
We had a standing mourning service.
Spilled out into the street.
I had to borrow chairs.
That was my parents' funeral.
I don't remember you there.
That's because
I wasn't there.
I couldn't be.
They were there because of me.
I mean, Christ, I haven't even visited their grave.
I was supposed to pick them up from the airport.
When I didn't show, eventually they took a cab.
That taxi crashed.
I was with Natalie when I found out.
[cell phone rings]
I blamed her.
I blame myself.
That's the night I left her.
You know, we made plans to go to college together, and we put it on hold.
My fucking life.
My whole--
That guilt has been eating you alive inside for too long.
You're gonna let it destroy you.
As it should.
No. Listen to me, son.
Don't call me "son".
You leave me the fuck alone.
Get that through your head. I don't want your help.
Leave me the fuck alone!
You listen to me, boy.
You have got to forgive yourself.
I can't!
You can!
Stop living in the fucking past!
Don't you understand?
The past is all I have.
I have nothing else.
You get that?
No! You have a life now!
You have me.
Now.
And Dylan, you have Natalie.
Oh, God.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Forget about the past.
She's come back to you.
Don't let her get away again.
That gin.
Every time I see that girl's face,
I think about that night.
I think about what I did and what I didn't do.
Forget about what you didn't do.
It's what you're going to do now that counts.
Hi.
Hey, babe. You, uh, got some mail.
Steve! Why did you wait so many years to ask me to marry you?
I-I woke up and
I realized what I had.
[sighs]
Was Charlie Scheel released?
No, but she just suddenly took off.
I'm ready to leave this life.
I'm clean.
[beep]
Hey, Natalie. This is Linda from Mercy.
I have a message from your patient, Charlie Scheel.
She said it's urgent.
What are you doing, Charlie?
Jesus wept.
That's the shortest verse in the Bible.
Charlie, come on.
You're making me nervous.
Jesus went to visit his sick friend Lazarus.
But he was too late, and
Lazarus was already dead.
But instead of just grieving for him, he resurrected him.
That's what you've done for me.
How did you do it? Did you make your peace, yet?
No.
I'm getting so bored of this, Dylan.
Waiting for you.
You know what, Charlie?
You Te gonna have to keep waiting.
You and I?
Have been walking dead for years now.
Me and you.
This could be our Resurrection Day.
Charlie!
Charlie, if you jump,
I am not coming with you.
I'm still in love with Natalie, and I'm gonna be with her.
You hear that, Natalie?
I'm sorry I haven't visited sooner.
But it's better to be late in this life than early in the next.
Rest in peace.
I've always loved the bastard.
He's got a lot of really good pubs.
He means colleges.
Now, make sure you keep focused, Dylan.
Fresh starts.
No regrets, love.
I know.
The French believe every time you say goodbye, you die a little.
But what do the fucking
French know?
You've been a really good friend.
Thank you.
Drive safely.
Thank you.
Take care. Take care.
We'll be back.
You ready?
Yeah.
So, if I turn the ring around and the heart points in, that means I'm taken.
Correct.
Okay.
That looks better.
Thank you.
What was it like?
What's what like?
What made you die.
Walking dead are all around us.
She saw me. She touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?
How could I interact with people?
You believe it so intensely that you've become real to yourself and to others.
Believing is seeing.
You Te just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.
So, how do I get out of Purgatory?
First of all, you need to accept that you Te dead.
Then I think you have one more chance to make things right.
You wanna die?
I don't wanna-wanna go without making amends.
[Natalie laughing]
So, what do you guys have planned after graduation?
We're going to college together.
Oh, so, keeping it alive, huh?
Yeah. Forever. Forever.

- Need a hand?
- Um... yeah. Sure.
Thanks.
It's just through here.
Hey. Hi, buddy.
Hey, Dex.
Boy, it's a hot one, huh?
Yeah.
Do you have fish?
No. Take a closer look.
Hey. Good boy.
Stick insect.
- Stick insect?
- They're actually very friendly.
George.
Mary.
Want something to drink?
I think I got juice, maybe beer.
Oh, no, I'm okay.
I'll just let you carry on.
It's fine.
- Thanks again.
- Okay.
Hey, um, that stick insect?
How do you know it's being friendly?
I have no idea.
She loved you too.
You let me go on loving you, waiting.
Also, why did you try to kill something that can't ever die?
I needed you then.
I need you now.
I'll always need you.
I knew it all the time.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that 722-5795?
- Yeah.
- Is Bobby there?
No. I just moved in.
Maybe he had the apartment before?
Mr. Davies, anything you wish to add?
Like I said, Your Honor, um... my client feels a restraining order... to be an unjustified stain on his character... and would like to have it lifted at first opportunity.
Noted.
There's also the matter of the family pet.
I've made my position clear on that.
But my client would like to know, if there's any...
Counselor, Miss Kee keeps the dog.
Mr. Kirby.
Your Honor, the divorce papers.
Your Honor, there's been an unforeseen delay.
I will send them right over.
You can't be here.
Just wanted to drop them off myself.
Figured it was the least I could do.
Oh, there's the bad boy.
Yes, it is.
Daddy's home.
Yes, he is. Yes, he is.
You signed them?
We had some good times, didn't we?
How about work?
They're being understanding.
You are going back, right?
Not yet.
Has he called again?
How about going out, meeting people?
He said if he couldn't have you, no one else would.
You live like this, in fear, he's won.
Come here, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Question nine:
Edinburgh is the capital of which country?
Ireland.
- Scotland?
- That's what I meant.
Is the correct answer.
Hello?
May I speak with Bobby, please?
There's no Bobby here.
May I ask who you are?
Who I am?
Is this a joke?
Did Steven put you up to this?
Would you do me a favor, please?
Tell him Rose called.
I'll be in Frank's at 8 if he wants to see me.
Rose, this friend of yours?
He really isn't here.
And, you know, like I said,
I moved in a couple of days ago.
I walked past the house last night.
I saw him right there in the window.
- You have the right address?
- El Falansterio, L-2.
Just tell him Frank's at 8, okay?
Frank's at 8. Sure.
If a guy called Bobby passes by,
I'll tell him whatever you want.
Hello.
Hi.
There are strict rules in this college... about perpetuating age- or gender-based stereotypes.
Excuse me?
It would be a breach of guidelines for me to suggest... that you may have mistakenly wandered... into Math for Stage Two Mechanical
Engineering here in 14-A... as opposed to, for example...
Conversational French?
In 14-B.
Well, as it happens, I was wanting to pursue a course on Math for...
Stage Two Engineering.
But having heard there's a course on Conversational French...
I hope you won't be too offended.
A little disappointed, maybe.
Excuse me.
What?
You look tired.
Hello?
Bobby says he doesn't know you.
Bobby's right.
You should listen to him.
And while you're at it, check his goddamn number.
You think I'm mad at you, don't you?
But I'm not.
He's using you. It's what he does.
Normally I like talking to crazy people, but I'm kinda tired today.
Wait, don't hang up, please.
Please.
Look, there's been a mistake, a crossed line or something.
He said he loved me.
Rose?
I'm sorry for what's happened.
But your friend isn't here and I don't know you.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
No harm done.
What's your name?
Mary.
Mary.
Mary what?
Mary Kee.
He asked me to marry him.
Lucky you.
The day he got back from Vietnam.
Came by in his uniform, got down on one knee.
Vietnam? You mean the war?
Oh, he didn't wanna go.
He was drafted.
How old are you?
Forty-one.
Rose, the Vietnam War was, what, 35, 40 years ago?
You would have been a child.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
What did I ever do to you?!
We're sorry.
That number is unobtainable.
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I wasn't thinking. I shouldn't have just...
Wait let me help you with that.
- How was... how was French?
- I have to go.
- I really didn't mean to scare you.
- I have to go.
You trying to steal my job, young lady?
Do you do the weeding around here?
I sure do.
What do you call this?
Oversight.
Pack up your desk, mister.
You're fired.
Wow, you're a hard one.
Knew that the first time
I laid my eyes on you.
"Pack up your desk".
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- What's the date?
This is harassment.
September 4th, 1979.
I can prove it.
You know that big kitchen pantry?
I'll draw something.
Um...
On the wall, just inside the door on the right-hand side.
And then if it's still there, you'll know I'm right.
Will you do that?
Will you look?
Sure, Rose.
I'll look.
- Hello?
- Was it there?
It was, wasn't it?
A picture. A rose.
I knew it.
- I wanna know what's going on.
- What do you mean?
You knew the picture was there.
Maybe someone told you about it.
- I don't know. I want the truth.
- I drew it.
I did it last night like I said I would, and it's still there.
I don't believe you.
But I'm supposed to believe you?
You tell me you're from the future and I believe you. I don't call you crazy.
I give you proof and you call me a liar.
I'm not calling you a liar.
This is happening for a reason.
I gotta go.
Not yet, please.
There's things I need to ask you.
Carter loses.
Reagan becomes president.
Morning.
Morning.
They're beautiful.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, man.
Did you know the people before me in the apartment?
A Spanish couple.
Mr. and Mrs. Alvarez.
Nice people.
You know Mrs. Alvarez, she would cook this caldo gallego from time to time.
To die for. Yeah.
Why did they leave?
I don't know.
I got up one day, they were gone.
Guess some family stuff or something. Not sure.
I don't know.
And the people before them?
Before?
I could hardly remember what
I had for breakfast.
I don't know.
Don't hang up, please.
Please?
Mary? Are you there?
I just need someone to talk to.
I get so lonely. Please.
You're so busy, you can't spare five minutes?
I'm here.
Thank you for not hanging up.
This is a little weird.
Well, people come together for a reason, Mary.
It doesn't matter how.
Do you believe that?
I don't know. I suppose.
- Why are you sad?
- I have to go now.
Is it a man?
- Did he cheat on you?
- No.
Oh, don't be sad, Mary.
You sound like a smart lady.
You'll find someone better, someone who deserves you.
Bobby cheats on me all the time.
Why don't you leave him?
I love him.
So find a good substitute.
Chocolate's good.
He keeps promising he'll change.
You've heard of feminism, yeah?
Women's lib?
Yeah, of course.
Jump on the bandwagon. It's a goer.
Bobby doesn't like women's lib.
He says they need a good smack.
MARY: He ever do that to you?
Not really.
Not really?
He says he loves me.
They don't change, Rose.
Ever.
Sometimes I think
I should have just got rid of him.
Sometimes I think walking out was the worst mistake I ever made.
I took your advice.
What?
He... he laughed at me.
I told him about you and me and how he had to change and he just kept on laughing.
I got rid of him, Mary, just like you told me to.
I worked all night.
Real quiet so the neighbors wouldn't hear.
They'll never find him.
They'll think he ran away with one of his tramps.
You killed him.
I can move into the apartment now.
They don't care who pays the rent.
I always hoped I'd live there with Bobby someday, but...
Mary, are you there?
Don't ever call me, understand?
I just did what you told me to do.
Don't ever call me again.
Marie?
Oh, God.
How big is he?
Bigger than you.
Yeah, but I'm wiry.
Be careful.
Come here.
Why?
Come here.
That's not what I saw.
How did you end up down here?
Navy brat. My dad was stationed at Roosey Roads.
- It's just closed, right?
- Mm-hm.
You?
My grandparents came over from Turin.
I was born here, but I went to school in Florida. Gainesville.
Taught there for a while.
And then I saw the opening at the college.
Don't get many Italians in San Juan.
By the time my grandfather realized this wasn't New York, the boat had already sailed.
That's not true.
Ma, that true about Pappy?
Idiot got on the wrong boat.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Guidi.
I like this one.
Does he, uh, bring girls around often?
One time before.
Ma.
She asked, I'm gonna tell.
A girl called Trulli.
Trudy, Trudy.
That girl could eat like a horse.
Ma.
Giovanni, that girl Johnny brought home, what did she eat?
Let's see.
Caesar salad, roast beef, french fries, carrots, minced peas, three pieces of bread and butter and a tiramisu.
What happened to Trudy?
She exploded.
Would you like something else?
No, thank you.
We should be...
We should be going.
Mm-mm.
Hey, see you, Pop.
Nice meeting you, Mary.
Good night.
Bye-bye.
It's not where
I pictured you.
I needed a place in a hurry.
It's not so bad.
The apartments are really big.
Thanks for tonight.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
Whose jacket?
How did you get in here?
How many times I told you?
Can't go leaving the back door open.
Lucky it was me.
Could've been anyone.
I'm calling the police.
Go ahead.
If you wanna make me angry.
Neither one of us wants that.
All these lawyers.
We haven't had a chance to talk.
You can't be here.
Not within 500 feet of me.
Five hundred feet.
Come on.
It's kinda ridiculous, isn't it?
What do you want?
I miss you, Mary.
I mean, the way we were, the fun we used to have.
Remember? So I just said,
"Screw the judges. Screw the lawyers.
They don't know us".
I just came to talk.
The way we used to.
Remember?
Don't answer it.
Mary.
I forgot my jacket.
I didn't mean to intrude.
Excuse my manners.
- John Guidi.
- Hey, Steven. Nice to meet you.
Um, excuse me.
You wanna tell your friend you're busy?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you busy?
Not really.
Not really.
I'll be in touch.
You need to get the air conditioning fixed.
Tell that to my building manager.
I could take a look at it some time if you want.
Thanks.
You should call the police. I mean you do have a restraining order on the guy.
It wouldn't make a difference.
Only makes him mad.
Mary, listen, I can...
I can handle it.
Thanks.
I'll check that lock.
That should do it.
Gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.
All right.
In case you need anything.
Thanks. Again.
Hello?
- Hi. Is that Luillo?
- Yes.
It's Mary Kee.
I'm calling from apart...
- Hello?
- I'm here.
I'm calling about the air conditioning.
I can't hear you. Hel...?
Hello?
- Hello.
- Luillo?
- Yes?
- Hi, it's Mary.
You're calling about...
The air conditioning.
- What's wrong?
- It's been broken since I moved in.
It's something I can fix in...
That long?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be calling.
I'll wait for your call. Thank you.
Bye.
I told you to stop calling me.
What happened?
Are you okay?
Hi, Mom.
No, it's not Steven. It's just a crank.
No trouble?
No, she's sweet, a really nice girl.
She's a little bit down today.
Hey.
Your buddy John?
Great job fixing my lawn mower.
It's just a couple wires.
I'll tell you, he handled that engine like a nervous lover.
It was really just...
A feather touch.
Hey, can I offer you guys a soda?
Um, I gotta go.
So soon?
It was...
I really just came by to make sure that you were okay.
- Everything's fine.
- Bye.
- Bye, George.
- Okay.
I will call you.
We should do something.
Okay.
Feather touch.
You're a wicked man, George.
That I am.
Hello?
I know you've been avoiding me.
But that's going to stop now.
I told you...
I saw you and your mommy today posing for photos outside the cathedral.
When I call, you're going to answer.
I wanna keep you safe, Mary, you and your beautiful mother.
Shit.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Who won the World Series in '79?
Pirates beat the Baltimore Orioles.
Pirates were down a three-game-to-one deficit.
They won it in seven games, yeah.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, look it up.
Clemente would've been proud of that.
And that same year, the year the Pirates beat the Orioles, who lived in my apartment?
What is this about?
You said you can't remember what you had for breakfast.
I think you remember just fine.
Rose. Rose Lazar.
You knew her.
She said, "Good morning".
You know, things like that, yeah.
And?
You know, she was the sad type.
She had a boyfriend who worked over at the Army base.
They were together for a while.
From time to time, they'd be fighting.
Come home around midnight, they'd be hollering and banging doors.
One day, the guy just disappeared.
That's when she moved in.
What happened to her?
Killed herself.
Here?
She wrapped the phone cord around her neck, hung herself from the ceiling.
Do you know why she did it?
Like I said, she... she was the sad type.
Are you sure she's dead?
That's what I was told, but there's no death certificate.
Sorry, I can't help you.
It's Steven. It has to be.
How? How would he build a wall without my noticing? A wall.
And how would he know about Rose?
He set it up.
He must have done it.
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.
You're talking to a Trekkie.
I can handle it.
All right.
Let's say that you're right.
You talked to this woman a few weeks ago and then she put something in your pantry.
- A body.
- A body.
But according to your time-jump theory, she doesn't do it a few weeks ago, she does it in 1979.
When you moved in, the pantry would already be bricked up.
- But it wasn't.
- Exactly, so it doesn't work.
Unless you're remembering the past as it was before it changed.
This is time like a river.
And this is something that happens.
An event.
Which affects the way the river flows.
Right.
So if you follow this path, he ends up leaving and she hangs herself.
What if something interferes with that?
She makes a new friend, say.
- Hello.
- Is Bobby there?
We get a whole different path.
The boyfriend ends up dead and you lose your pantry.
Right, but why...?
- why did you remember the pantry?
- Right.
You remember it because you caused it to change.
And somehow it leaves a trace, like a pencil drawing a line, so...
You erase it... and you draw another line.
But you can still see where the first one was.
But only you.
Only the person that erased it.
- You really think that's it?
- Honestly, no.
I think we pull down that wall, there's some sick surprise from Steven and he's fucking with you.
I'm not touching that wall.
What? You're just gonna leave it there?
Really? Come on, really?
You're gonna go to bed wondering if there is a corpse in your kitchen?
I'm not touching it.
Can we get the bear?
No, I don't want the hat.
I still can't believe you lost my hat.
I loved that hat.
Stay there.
John, is that you?
Hey, buddy.
Hello?
Who's there?
Which fictional family lives at 742 Evergreen Terrace?
Repeat the question, please.
742 Evergreen Terrace.
Which fictional family lives at that address?
Simpsons.
I'm gonna pass.
You were right to pass.
The correct answer is the Simpsons.
Question six.
Worcestershire sauce contains two of the following ingredients.
Which ingredient does it not contain?
Molasses, anchovies, mustard.
- Mustard.
- Mustard?
Is the correct answer.
ROSE:
Did I wake you?
You're not gonna hang up on me now, are you?
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna talk to me?
We're friends, aren't we?
Don't want anything to happen to that charming mother of yours.
You out late last night?
What's his name?
John.
John what?
John Guidi.
Guidi.
Sure, his parents run the little diner on San Francisco.
I saw you yesterday.
What?
In a nursing home.
I don't understand.
I found you through social services.
Is something wrong with me?
Am I sick?
Not physically.
A little thin, maybe.
You don't eat.
Mentally, though...
Tell me.
What do you think?
All that anger, all that rage.
You didn't think it would affect you?
You're lying.
Think about it, Rose.
Ever wonder why you don't have any friends?
Why you're stalking someone you never even met?
You think that's normal?
Shut up.
What about Bobby, all the times he screwed around on you?
All the times he walked out on you?
He never walked out on me.
Who told you that?
It doesn't matter.
Who have you been talking to?
Who's been telling tales?
It's not important.
What's important is that you can change this.
You don't have to end up in a nuthouse.
You can stop this happening.
You spoke to me?
You don't talk much.
I stayed a little while, watched some TV, played cards.
Said I'd come visit again today.
I don't play cards, never have.
Well, I guess you learned.
Not well, either.
I beat you every time.
You think this is funny.
You think this is fucking funny?
A sad, pathetic woman in diapers who can't feed herself?
No, Rose, I don't think it's funny.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
It's your choice.
All right.
That should do it.
That is so good.
Do you know why they call them daisies?
No.
It's from "day's eye".
Because they open their petals in the sun.
You know what I call them?
Weeds.
No, you don't.
Sure, I do.
No, you like them.
You think they're pretty.
Is that so?
There you go.
Did you visit me again today?
You said you would.
Just got back.
We play cards?
A little.
How did I look?
A little better.
More color, maybe.
That all? Nothing else about me?
Nothing unusual?
I'm really not sure.
Think real hard.
I'm really not sure.
Okay, Mary.
I'm going to bury something next to the palm tree a couple of feet out towards the apartment.
You go dig it up. You understand?
Dig it up.
ROSE:
You lied.
You didn't find me in a nursing home, did you, Mary?
You didn't find me at all.
Because if you had, you'd have known what to say:
"Yes, Rose, you did look different.
You looked a whole lot different".
It's not real. It can't be real.
That is fucked.
Great.
Let me.
No.
Trust me.
Hello?
ROSE:
Who's this?
Name's John. Who's this?
John Guidi, Mary's little friend.
I know your parents, John Guidi.
That's nice.
Put her on.
I think me and you should talk first.
I said, put her on.
She doesn't wanna speak to you right now.
Did she find my gift?
Yeah.
I gotta say, I think that's pretty screwed-up, don't you?
I've got another little surprise.
Tell her I guessed who the tattletale was.
What?
Tattletale tit
Your tongue shall be split
And every little puppy dog
Shall eat a little bit
You know, Rose, I don't think you should call here anymore.
This whole thing has gone too far.
Just tell hen
Well, that's one seriously nutty lady.
What did she say?
Something about a tattletale.
Said she guessed who it was.
What?
George. George.
Where's George?
Excuse me?
This is his apartment.
No.
I just saw him this evening.
I made him a daisy chain.
I hope you don't mind me asking, how long have you been here?
A few months, since the baby.
And before that?
Do you know who was here before?
Older couple,
Dominican, I think.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
Thank you.
You remember George.
George. You met him.
You made jokes.
You fixed his lawn mower, for chrissakes.
I never met him, Mary.
You think I'm crazy.
I think we should go inside.
Maybe it would be a good idea for you not to be here tonight.
I'm not crazy.
You've been under a lot of pressure with Steven and the phone.
Maybe you could go to your mom's.
You could stay at mine.
This isn't...
It wouldn't...
I'd stay on the couch and you could get some sleep.
And see how you feel in the morning.
- Through here.
- Thanks.
Hey, it's okay, Dex.
Keep going.
Maybe you should move out.
- I've only just moved in.
- This woman is crazy.
Whoever she is, wherever she's calling from, if you move out, maybe it'll stop.
Maybe that's what she wants.
So now you don't think it's Steven?
I don't know who it is, but if it were me,
I would be out of there.
I should go to bed.
Leave this.
There are fresh towels on the bed.
Thanks.
Mary!
What's wrong?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing, I'm fine. Go back to sleep.
Morning.
Hey. Hey, Dex.
Coffee?
Yeah, that sounds great.
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Um...
I think I'm gonna take Dexter for a walk.
And then?
And then I'm gonna go back to the apartment, pick up my things and make the dreaded call to Mom.
I think that's right.
Hey, Dex. Hey.
You wanna go for a run? Yeah?
Go on.
Let him go, Steven.
Come on, Dex.
Come on, Dexter.
Come on, Dex. Come on.
So are you sleeping with him now?
That new friend of yours?
Dexter. Come to Mommy, Dexter.
That's a good boy. Come on.
I don't think it's really fair.
He gets to share my dog.
Come on, Dex.
We're leaving.
He doesn't get to share my dog.
You understand?
Hm?
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm finishing at 3.
And you wanna meet up after class?
Yeah.
Meet you out front.
Sounds great.
All right. Okay, bye.
Bye.
The number you have dialed is not in service.
- I'm looking for John.
- Ah, I'll call him.
I'm sorry, Mr. Guidi.
I'm actually looking for John Jr.
I tried his cell-phone, it doesn't seem to be working.
- John Jr.?
- I was supposed to meet him.
I only wanna talk to him.
You wanna talk to my son?
- I don't understand.
- I'll tell you.
Santa Margarita, south entrance.
That's where I go when I want to talk to him.
WOMAN:
You knew him?
I see his mother from time to time.
She comes here a lot.
My husband, Charlie, prick that he was.
You know anything about the boy?
How he died?
They don't know he died.
They were never sure.
They never found him.
Bobby Shafto went to sea
Silver buckles...
You were supposed to kill yourself.
George found you here in the kitchen.
You'd started to smell.
This was your fault, Mary. All of it.
He was gonna take you away from me.
You were gonna let him.
I'm willing to forgive, start over.
You'll never be happy, Rose.
We both know that.
So why put up with it?
A few pills, that's all it would take.
But I am happy.
I have a friend here with me.
GIRL:
Hello?
Who's this?
GIRL:
Mary. Mary Kee.
You're lying.
GIRL: No, I'm not.
Where do you live?
GIRL:
Roosey Roads.
Rose says you're one of her best friends.
Says I'm one of her best friends too.
Mary, listen.
You need to go home now.
Understand?
ROSE:
Hello, Mary. Recognize the voice?
You should. It's yours.
What are you doing with her, you crazy bitch?
We're making dinner, Mary.
Surely you remember.
We're frying chicken.
But we have to be careful, don't we, because oil is hot.
Oil gets very hot.
We have to be very, very careful, don't we, Mary?
Yes, please be careful.
What was that?
Please be careful.
You were mean to me, Mary.
You were gonna let that man take you away from me.
I'm sorry, Rose.
You don't sound sorry.
I really am.
You sound scared, but you don't sound sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
One more time.
One more time and we'll see if you sound like you mean it.
I'm really sorry, Rose.
I don't think so.
Please. Please, Rose. Please.
No! Stop it, please!
Please, stop, Rose, please!
Stop! Stop!
No!
- Rose?
- Yes, Mary.
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.
You?
I was.
You see why I did it now, don't you?
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.
Don't ever leave me, Mary.
- It's my birthday tomorrow.
- Congratulations.
- What have you got planned?
- Nothing.
I remember it back then.
It was horrible.
Yeah?
I had a party at the bowling alley on the base.
Nobody came.
They were scared of how I looked.
I was so sad and lonely.
Maybe you could come, Rose.
I'd like that.
It would be just like we were friends.
I'd look after you.
I know that now.
We got there around 3:00.
Maybe a bit after.
I'll be there at 3.
I'll hold a lane for you.
Thank you, Rose.
What are friends for?
Hello?
WOMAN: Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah, I'll be there soon.
How's Dexter?
Good, okay.
Love you.
Yeah, love you. Bye.
Mom, I told you...
ROSE: Hello, Mary.
I missed the bus.
I didn't make it to the bowling alley.
Lucky in a way, though, wasn't it?
- Rose, I didn't...
- Hello?
Hello?
Mary, I need you to go home, okay?
Can you do that? As quick as you can.
Just put the phone down, run as fast as you can.
ROSE:
Not such a bad kid, is she?
What happened, Mary? What made her turn into such a bitch?
Don't hurt her, Rose.
- Please, don't hurt her.
Like you tried to hurt me?
- Like you tried to kill me?
- Rose, I...
Only she wouldn't understand, would she?
She wouldn't think it was fair.
You'd understand, though, wouldn't you, Mary?
Please.
Please.
Rose?
I best let you go now.
You have things to do.
No, I... I have time.
Not today, Mary.
You have a visitor.
Leave me alone!
YOUNG MARY:
Hello? Hello?
Mary?
Mary, you have to run, understand?
I don't know what I did to make her mad.
Is she beside you?
She went to get her pills.
Listen to me. This woman, she's crazy.
It's not your fault. It's nothing you did.
But she's gonna try to hurt you again.
- I'm scared.
- I know, baby.
But you gotta get outta there, okay?
So you have to run. Go, go now!
- But she locked the door.
- Pull! Pull it harder!
She locked them!
She locked them both!
Mary, you have to run!
I waited, Mary.
I waited all this time.
I wanted you to know why you're going to die.
You shouldn't have tried to kill me.
Mary, are you there?
Hello?
Okay, I want you to grab a knife,
Mary, from the kitchen.
Okay? Grab a really big knife.
Tell me when you have it.
Do you have it?
I can't, she's coming.
You never should have lied to me, Mary.
Mary, the wardrobe.
Do you see the wardrobe?
- See the wardrobe in the bedroom?
- I see it.
I want you to smash the mirror, okay?
I want you to kick it as hard as you can.
She's coming!
Just do it!
Mary? Grab one of the pieces, Mary.
- Grab one of the pieces.
- She's in the room!
- You know what you have to do.
- I can't!
Stick it in her, Mary, as hard as you can!
- Please, don't make me.
- Do it, Mary!
- Do it now!
- Go away! Leave me alone!
Her eyes are open.
And she's lying on the floor.
Her eyes are open.
Go home, Mary.
Go home.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What do you want?
"Hi, honey.
Tough day at work?"
No, sweetheart, it's fine.
It's all fine.
Oh, hello there. Hello.
- Get outta my house.
- Is there any beer?
I said, get out.
All right, if you put it that way.
See what you made me do?
How about that beer?
Please, don't make me.
Last chance, Steven.
Yeah?
Or what?
Bobby, Bobby Shafto
He'll come back and marry me

The Extraordinary Adventures
Of Adele Blanc-Sec
Ferdinand Choupard is a minor character in our story.
Nonetheless he is, where this adventure begins, as he wandered home after an evening spent playing cards and sipping a marvelous
12-year-old malt whisky.
It was November 4th, 1911, at 1 o'clock in the morning.
The streets were empty with a chilly nip in the air.
Yet, at the same time, exactly 953 meters from there, the city was jumping.
On stage, Nicole Gambert, or Nini-les-Gambettes, kicked up a storm.
The enthusiastic audience revelled in the show.
I love you.
Wonderful.
Great.
Every evening was a triumph.
From the gent over there.
And every evening for nearly a month,
Raymond Pointrenaud, a former Prefect, celebrated his promotion to Paris as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
Meanwhile, Ferdinand had barely travelled the 280 meters that separate La Concorde from Place des Pyramides.
Don't be shy!
You've seen others!
Oh my God!
Ferdinand's visions were in fact an optical illusion.
The frenzied lights came from the home of Professor Marie-Joseph Esperandieu.
This eminent scientist and expert on Ancient Egypt had obtained a degree in physics aged only 16.
His research culminated
35 years later in a book with the evocative title,
Is There A Life After Death?
At the same moment, across the Seine, the question seemed to have been settled long ago.
Yet, on the first floor, a life form that contravened the laws of science was about to give the scientist his answer.
As the century's most amazing experiment took place before our eyes,
Inspector Albert Caponi had his tightly shut.
Of course, had he seen the pterodactyl fly by his window, our story would have been drastically different, but for now no one could blame the inspector for his somnolence.
His stoutness and perseverance had previously earned him a good many distinctions, including the Medal of Merit for solving the mystery of the missing persons of Dreux asylum.
He was decorated on August 28th, 1907, by the Prefect Raymond
Pointrenaud in person.
Raymond! What are you doing?
Let my little bird land on your branches.
You devil! Nothing arouses me more than poetry.
Really?
Yes!
As the night recedes, the dew in the branch prepares to fall
And the bird in the nest to open its eyes...
Drive normally, can't you?
Goodness me! Get out! Get out!
Hello!
Caponi speaking.
In the Seine?
In the Seine?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Help me find the words.
This young man's a scientist too, but a humble assistant, working at the Botanical Gardens.
His name's Zborowsky and he's 23.
Science isn't his only passion.
He has another, more voracious one.
Dear... Miss Adele...
What if she's married?
Or even worse, widowed?
Yes, his second passion is unconditional love for Miss Adele Blanc-Sec.
A passion she provoked with these few words...
Who's it for?
For Zbo... bo... bobo rowsky.
First name, perhaps?
Yes.
Which is?
Andrej, with a J, as in jaguar.
Oh, I'd love this one.
A jaguar.
Oh.
Thank you!
Andrej Zborowsky was definitively lost to science.
As for Adele Blanc-Sec and her sense of humour, they had set off on a new adventure, much less monstrous and much more exotic, since her publisher had sent her to Peru to unravel the mystery of the last Incas.
Something you should know about Adele, to really understand her...
She listens to her instincts, not her publisher.
Aziz, how many hours' ride to the rendezvous?
In this heat, at least six, Miss Adele.
Very well. Let's move out.
What's "move" in Arabic?
Yalla, Miss Adele.
Yalla
And "Move, you ass, or you're dead"?
Stop!
Is this it?
I think so.
Very well.
You need to drink a lot of water in this heat.
These are the two men
I told you about.
A cup of tea before the drop?
I look like I drink tea?
Is this the tomb room?
Not yet.
It's the embalming room, where the mummies were prepared.
The bodies were gutted on the altar and the entrails thrown in these pots.
Then, after a quick wash, they were powdered, made up and dressed.
What was this for?
Made-to-measure suits.
The body goes here and the machine wraps it in 200 layers of bandages.
Not to mention the oil, squirted between each layer.
What kind of oil is it?
No idea, but it worked a treat.
Found it!
Yes, this is it. Gents, let's see your treasure.
Death... is the only path... that leads... to birth.
Your journey ends here, darling.
To thank you for your cooperation, we'll spare your life.
Get lost!
Fine Egyptian hospitality!
Yes, but he's not Egyptian.
Great...
A peculiarly inflammable mix of oil and petroleum.
Enter with even a tiny match and there'll be fireworks.
Let me know when your gentlemen's club is open to women.
Excuse me.
Just as I thought.
Miss! After careful consideration, we accept your application.
Allow me to save my emotion for later.
That's that bit done.
Hold on a sec...
Where'd you learn all this?
There are only two ways.
Be Egyptian or learn to read.
Amazing!
Allah is great!
I make a fortune.
I make a fortune.
Here he is...
C'mon, they're down there!
Even without the stone, it's very heavy. How will we ever get it out?
In tombs like this, there's a way in and a way out.
Find it.
Yes, Miss Adele.
Open it.
Hey, wait.
Opening a pharaoh's tomb is sacrilege.
You can hang for that.
What punishment for taking his gold?
None.
Beware, you witch!
I won't leave without my gold.
I fear you're right.
Money can't buy happiness,
Aziz. Open it!
That's your pharaoh?
No, a doctor.
Don't move.
If it's for a consultation, miss, you may be a bit late.
However, I know a specialist institute in Cairo, where the doctors would be delighted to examine you.
I'm fine, thank you. Except for the nausea
I feel in your presence, Prof. Dieuleveult.
Still the same caustic sense of humour, my dear Adele. You'll need it.
Meanwhile, tell me why a great reporter like you is here looting tombs.
Not looting, borrowing.
Of course! You're taking him for a walk to get some fresh air.
Patmosis is a professor of medicine,
Ramses II's personal doctor.
The greatest medical expert in Ancient Egypt.
Fortunately, because...
I need his expertise.
Would that be to cure humankind?
No, just my sister. She's ill.
How very thoughtful and touching!
But has it crossed your mind that your professor is... dead?
I'd noticed, thank you.
How will you resuscitate him?
May I?
Is There A Life After Death?
That old fool, Esperandieu?
He's barely able to spin a chair round.
He'll be dead before he revives this old mummy!
Mind your language!
Mummies hear everything we say and detest disrespect.
You're scaring me!
After the Ice Monster, here comes the Sand Zombie!
Watch out, he's a real grouch!
My dear Adele,
I confess I'm one of your most avid readers, but this is by far the silliest story you've ever told.
Take her away!
Yes, sir!
Come along. Hurry!
The way out?
I checked every wall. Nothing.
It must be in the middle.
The tomb's in the middle.
See? You found it.
Hurry up. Let's go!
Damn rainwater!
You know the punishment for tomb raiders?
Hanging.
For locals only.
Foreigners are given more consideration and a swift death.
More protocol, but much less pain.
Miss! Miss!
A last wish perhaps?
It's not very good for my health, but I'd appreciate a cigarette.
Why not? One won't kill you!
Thank you.
It's magnificent.
Yes.
May I?
Yes.
A gift, I suppose?
A memento, actually.
My father. On his death.
Oh
It's better this way. Whenever
I use it, I think of him.
Oh
I'd like to give you a souvenir.
Really?
Whenever you use it, think of me.
Into my arms!
Forgive me the sudden intimacy.
Excuse me, my good man!
Cairo?
Thanks.
Put him on the table.
Calm down. Careful!
We'll take care of you.
Scissor.
Calm down, Professor. Oxygen!
We're nearly there.
I'll kill that woman!
Oxygen!
I'll kill her!
Oxygen!
I'll kill her! Breathe in!
I'll kill her! Breathe in!
Blow out! Blow out!
Fifty!
Mr. Choupard, how can I believe a man with
50% alcohol on his breath?
I swear it's true,
Commissioner.
Inspector.
Inspector, yes. The bird swooped onto the car and pecked it to pieces!
And Prefo Pectoral... was aboard.
Ex-Prefect.
And he had a scantily clad woman next to him.
A scantily clad woman?
With Pointrenaud, founder of
Christian Aid? Nonsense!
I know, but I saw her!
Like you saw Joan of
Arc ablaze once more.
Sir...
We've identified the dead.
There were three passengers in the vehicle.
Pointrenaud, his driver, and...
Good Lord!
What did I tell you?
To the drunk tank!
I'm innocent!
It's the big bird that did it!
I was just going home.
Gentlemen, until we find out more about this tragedy,
I'm relying on you to keep this case confidential.
Of course, sir.
Not a word to the press.
No, sir.
The Prefect and the Showgirl!
Their Dance with Death!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Get The Little Parisian today!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!
Read all about it!
There you are, sir.
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!
A pterodactyl? How grotesque!
They'll do anything to sell their rag.
Even Le Gaulois has run it.
They'll panic people, that's all.
Probably. It's the talk of the town.
Send poor Pointrenaud's widow our condolences.
Yes, Mr. President.
A Prefect with a showgirl, perhaps.
But a pterodactyl? In the 20th century!
You sent for me, sir?
Yes. Call the Interior.
Good morning, sir.
This pterodactyl business sounds serious. It could be anarchists up to their tricks.
Look into it and keep me informed.
Leave it to me, sir.
Call the Prefect.
Hello!
Minister.
This pterodactyl business is dragging on.
The President wants results this week.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Call Police Headquarters.
Yes? Dugommier?
Who's on the pterodactyl case?
Captain Poissard.
Hardly surprising it's going nowhere!
We need more energy.
A sleuth!
Give him 72 hours to obtain results.
I'm on the job, sir.
Get me Cheval!
Hello!
We have to solve this fast.
You have 48 hours.
Consider it done, sir.
What a mess!
Caponi speaking.
Cheval here.
Good morning, Commissioner.
I've put you on the pterodactyl case.
Don't let me down.
Our reputation's at stake.
I'll do my best, sir.
You have 24 hours.
Thank you, sir.
Where'd an animal like that come from?
Look...
It wasn't like that.
Of course not, Andrej.
This egg's always been in my care.
What happened?
Yesterday, an attendant noticed broken glass.
He blamed it on a careless visitor and simply replaced the glass.
People are so clumsy!
It's more complicated than that.
Look at the remains of the shell.
Most are still connected to the amniotic membrane, as if the force that cracked the egg came from...
The inside?
Exactly.
But that would mean the egg...
Hatched, Zborowsky.
After 135 million years' gestation, it emerged from its shell and flew away.
Through there!
In that case, could it be related to the pterodactyl in the press?
You'd have made an excellent policeman.
Professor Menard?
Yes?
Inspector Caponi.
What can I do for you?
I'm in charge of the petrodactyl case.
Pterodactyl.
That's what I said.
Seeing the bone collection in your museum,
I thought maybe you could help.
I'm strictly a Cretaceous man.
I'd suggest you see a specialist in the Jurassic.
Look, I have 24 hours to solve this.
I can't go visiting Jura.
Let me find you a specialist in Paris in that case.
Most kind of you.
Say...
That egg... It'd make a heck of an omelette.
Please follow me.
Yes, of course.
I'll keep you informed of developments.
Please do.
Goodbye.
Come on...
Don't be scared. come on.
Look what I've got for you.
Smells good.
Come on...
This is it, sir. Up there.
Excellent!
Fetch me a black coffee and something to nibble on.
I can't think on an empty stomach.
You want more? Eat, my baby, eat!
That's good, my baby.
Yes? What do you want?
Inspector Caponi.
I have some questions for you about the ferodactyl.
Pterodactyl, sir.
I was told you're a specialist.
Yes, that's right. But this isn't a...
I was about to eat.
Perfect, that's our specialty.
Well, please come in then.
Goodness, it's dark in here.
I'm very sensitive to light.
Please, take a seat.
En.
Thanks, Jeannot. May I? I haven't eaten in 2 days. Go ahead.
So, how can I be of help?
Tell me about the animal.
What it eats, where it sleeps..
We know very little about its habits.
We do know it's a carnivore.
Quite right!
Nothing beats a rare rib of beef!
What's that?
It's the toucan.
Please go on, Professor.
It has a wingspan of about... six meters, and can fly for hours on end, looking for food... to take back to the nest.
There's a nest of them?
No, I mean... There's only one.
En
But at the time, when they had a mate, finding food and building a nest were their main activities.
Mating took place once a year and for reasons as yet unknown, they only laid one egg at a time.
Which explains their aggressive nature, especially... when it came to defending their one... and only offspring.
Amazing!
Sir, the toucan's...
Help! Help! Jesus!
It's because of the egg.
It was too much for him.
The man's deranged!
Take him away!
Sorry.
Need a porter?
I wouldn't say no.
Adele
Mr Xavier? How kind.
My only hope of seeing you, my dear, as you travel far and near, is if lie in wait for you here.
Very good!
Gently! It's fragile.
Yes, ma' am.
No 28, Rue du Four, please.
So? Peru?
Far! Very far.
And very high.
Indeed.
You made it up Machu Picchu?
Every morning.
Very morning!
Is it indiscreet to ask what treasure you bring us in that fine box?
A pipe. An Andean pipe.
A pipe?
The large model.
A sacred pipe
I wrenched from the tomb of the last Inca king.
No!
Yes! Fatal for the uninitiated player, so don't touch.
Definitely not.
Tell me, my good man, is this a cab or a B&B?
I'd love to get moving, lady, but these damn nags are blocking the road.
When will they ban horses from Paris?
This is the 200th century!
Move! you moron, or you are dad!
Oh, what happened?
Where we were just now?
What hocus-pocus have you brought back now?
Miranda, mind your language and help with the bags.
I just cleaned your room.
You bring back these old dirty relics again.
I'll take care of this one personally.
What's all this mail?
The young man from the Botanical Gardens.
A letter a day, and two Monday to make up for Sunday.
Reminds me of my youth in
Andalusia, in my mother's family.
There was a young picador, strong as his bulls...
How is Agathe?
Fine. She's been very good.
But she eats less and less.
Soon she'll be skin and bone.
We'll take good care of her.
Thank you, Miranda, for your patience, your time and your advice!
So, you refuse to eat?
Now you look so unhealthy.
You need some blusher.
You're as pretty as ever.
I hope Miranda didn't bore you with Andalusia.
I was in Egypt.
I have a surprise for you.
Look!
Meet Patmosis, personal physician of Ramses II, the great pharaoh.
Medically, they were so advanced.
Their preservation techniques prove it.
Nobody's ever done better.
I'm sure with all his secrets, he'll soon have you on your feet.
As son as I find the man who can revive him.
Sir?
I'm very sorry,
Miss Blanc-Sec.
I was about to slip you a note.
I'd no idea you were back.
I was about to go out.
I won't keep you.
I hope not.
Here...
Number them, so I know where to begin.
Forget the others. I mean, you can read them later.
That one's the most important.
Ok, I will read them in bath.
In bath?
I always do.
Um.
Beautiful.
What?
I mean, your room is beautifully decorated.
What's this pterodactyl?
Exactly. That's what my...
Which prison has a death row?
La Sante.
Can I do something to help?
Drink to my health!
Esperandieu, your lawyer to see you.
Your client, sir.
Miss Blanc-Sec?
What are you doing here?
Professor, I found Patmosis' mummy.
That's impossible.
True, but I did.
And don't ask me how.
Where is it now?
At home.
Waiting for you.
Oh.
But Adele...
I fear it will have to wait some more.
I don't see how I can get out of here.
Anyway, my mind is to busy controlling the bird.
The pterodactyl?
Yes. I wanted to refine my technique while you were in Egypt.
I brought to life an egg over 135 million years old.
Perfect! A 4,000000-year-old mummy will be child's play.
Perhaps, but the bird exhausts me.
Whenever I doze off, its killer instinct takes over. I must stop it
My sister first, then your giant insect.
That's fine by me, but how will you get me out?
Trust your lawyer.
Sir?
I'm here to see my client, Esperandieu.
Mr. Saint Hubert, can we have a comment?
Don't crowd.
Hold back the reporters!
Gentlemen, calm down!
Let him speak!
I cut short my African trip at the government's behest.
They have invited me as an expert to assist Mr Caponi to dispatch this pterodactyl.
It's a great honour to put my talent at the service of the nation.
Mr. Saint Hubert, what approach will you use?
First, we'll track it down, to study its behaviour and habits.
How will you find it?
Quite simply, by raising our sights.
Anything good today?
Pigeon.
You've saved my life.
Don't mention it.
Come out, wherever you are.
It's right here, Caponi.
I can sense it.
Wonderful.
It's pter... ptero... pterodactyl...
What is it exactly?
Mutton! That's what it is.
Really?
Categorically. Trust me,
I know my droppings.
It's the best way to track an animal.
We're making progress,
Caponi. Progress!
Wonderful.
In the bowl, there's a badge.
You're Armand
Petit-Blanchard, head cook.
Armand what?
Petit-Blanchard, I said!
Someone stole my badge from my locker.
Hands off me!
Get out! That's enough now!
Right... I need a better plan.
Sorry, no more pate.
Not to worry.
Hey! Caponi!
Yes?
Unless I'm mistaken, it could find sheep in 3 places.
Montmartre in the north, the colonial exhibition in the east, or the Botanical Gardens.
That's right.
Let's go!
By the grace of god!
Thank you, my son.
Wow! Sister is coming.
Don't touch!
Hurry up, let's go!
As Daddy would say, a battle that seems lost is the most exciting.
Up and at 'em!
Bang! Bang!
Bang!
The farmer's counted the herd twice. None missing.
Fine! Let's go!
My sheep!
I'm so sorry. It just went off.
Bertrand? Get a vet.
Cell 28. It's for his jab.
Ouch!
Sorry.
Professor? Wake up!
It's time to go.
Would you be so kind as to come back later?
I really am very tired.
That takes the biscuit!
Six Poitou goats, four Vanoise chamois, fifteen Larzac ewes and... nine, ten, twelve mountain sheep from Jura.
Jura?
All present and correct!
Good. On to the Botanical Gardens.
Get ready, Caponi!
We'll launch our assault at first light.
Thank you!
You're relieved!
Fine by me.
Good luck!
I hope you had a good sleep.
We have to go now.
What are you doing here?
It's not by choice.
Where's the Professor?
They transferred him last night.
Always do before the execution.
Execution?
The guillotine, tomorrow at dawn.
It can't be...
Unfortunately, it can, unless... he gets a pardon.
Pardon?
Yes.
Here... I pardon you.
Go on, fetch! good boy, Nelson!
Mr. President,
Miss Blanc-Sec's here.
She has nothing on her.
What? nothing on her?
We searched her.
She's unarmed.
Go on!
Come on, Nelson! Good boy!
My dear Miss Blanc-Sec!
Mr. President.
You know I have a fond memory of that interview...
When was it?
January 18th, 1906.
The day after you were elected.
It was my first interview.
And the last time I laughed so much.
Yes, I was appalling.
You were charming.
So, what can I do for you?
Well... As President, you often criticise the death penalty.
I've pardoned 17 condemned men in my first term.
Precisely.
Please, pardon one more.
Professor Esperandieu.
Due for execution tomorrow.
He's innocent.
I know his case.
We have 3 dead bodies, including a Prefect.
He didn't kill them.
It was a prehistoric beast!
Only the Professor can control it.
Without him, how many bodies will there be?
Miss, we have put our finest men on the case.
We even called in a big game hunter from Africa to dispatch the animal.
Nelson! Fetch your ball!
Esperandieu is a fine scholar.
His research keeps science going forward.
By taking his life, you condemn so many others.
I promise I'll think it over.
Thank you, sir.
What's wrong?
Your ball's over there!
Fetch it, Nelson!
Come on! Look!
What's up? Seen a ghost?
See? your ball's over here.
Come and fetch it!
Be a good boy! Hurry!
Come! Nelson! come!
Oh, no! Mr. President!
Good boy! Into my arms!
Get down!
President assaulted!
Sorry!
Don't move!
Get off him!
Take your paws off me! Let me go!
Are you hurt, sir?
I am fine, go away!
I'm warning you,
I do jiu-jitsu.
Nelson! Nelson!
Let me go or I'll press charges!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Find Nelson!
Eyes open, Caponi!
Both are wide open, honestly.
Vigilance and patience are the hunter's watchwords.
Tell me, Saint Hubert, could
I nip off for a minute for some food?
Out of the question!
We are at war, my friend.
One day I hunted a tiger lying low in a Bengali temple.
We went three days without food.
Three days!
Yes.
Incredible!
How did you do it?
I started by consulting all the books in the library, which confirmed the animal's sedentary nature.
So I got the idea to collect the fragments of its egg and put them in a quiet place.
Then I left out some choice cuts of beef, to keep them from hunger, so it wouldn't decimate our herd of Corsican sheep.
Zborowsky... You're a genius!
It's nothing really.
Just a little intuition.
With intuition like that, you must sweep the ladies off their feet, my young friend!
That depends on the lady.
Are there two L's in Addle?
No, two E's.
Two E's?
Adele. A-D-E-L-E. Blanc-Sec.
Like the wine. Dry white, you know.
Yes, I know dry whites.
Marvelous!
Go ahead.
From the beginning.
To cure my sister,
I went to Egypt, not Peru, to find a doctor, Patmosis, a charming but mummified fellow.
Prof. Esperandieu was supposed to wake him, not the damn pterodactyl he should've left alone, given its attack on the President and his pet.
The petero... no, the pet's the dog.
I summoned up all my courage and threw myself on the President.
A heroic but calculated gesture, intended to secure a pardon for the Professor to save my sister
I was arrested for attacking him.
Do I look like a terrorist?
No.
So the bird dunked on Nelson.
Dunked?
Clear? Can I go home now?
Yes. However... one tiny detail escapes me.
Which is?
Who is... Whose is...
Whose is the dog?
Right... do you have to speak in Morse, or we'll be all night?
I save the President and that's the thanks I get?
You louts!
Things didn't quite go to plan, little sis.
I need a bath to gather my wits.
Sorry for bothering you for nothing.
Truly. But aren't you happier here eyeing the girls than in your tomb?
My god!
Yes?
Into my arms!
I read your letter.
Which one?
About the pterodactyl.
You're a genius, Andrej.
Let's go. The taxi's waiting downstairs.
Right away.
This way.
See? I wasn't telling you lies.
Incredible!
Be careful, Miss Adele.
Don't worry, I've cracked tougher nuts.
Birdy, birdy...
It prefers meat.
Really?
Silly me.
Where are you from, my beauty?
I don't mean you!
In any case, you have beautiful plumage.
In truth, if your voice is the equal of your coat...
Fine. Clearly no ancestor of the nightingale.
Watch out, it might think you're a goat.
You smooth-talker.
No, I meant...
I'm usually called bird names.
Really?
My dove... My chickadee...
My feathery thing!
Actually...
You want my feathers, don't you?
My feathery thing...
Feathers of little birdies...
Incredible!
There you go, that's good. Now we're friends,
I have a favour to ask of you.
Surely you're not going to...
It'd be rude not to.
It's madness!
It can't be more complicated than a camel.
It can.
Watch out! The tree!
Stop!
There we are.
You're unbelievable,
Miss Blanc-Sec.
Now we've mastered the unbelievable, let's perform the impossible.
Here we are!
This way, my friends.
This is so exciting!
You haven't seen anything yet.
And don't blink, or you'll miss it.
I prepared some snacks for you.
Good thinking.
This is for you.
Thank you.
Champagne? I'll be tipsy again.
Which way?
At the window.
Thank you.
Look at the crowd.
We're just in time.
There he is!
An ugly little head he has.
I see why they'd chop it off.
Charlotte!
It was because of the egg.
It was too much for him.
They've put a bag on his head.
I don't understand. Why'd the executioner fly off with a bag on his head?
There! There it is!
There! I'm here!
It's snatched a man. Fetch an ambulance.
Leave the rest to me.
I'll go right away.
You keep it, buster.
Anyone there! Where are we?
Is this hell?
Here I am!
Adele?
Hello.
How can this be?
He saved your life. You brought him to life, so it's only fair.
Yes.
What's going on? Who are these...
Esperandieu?
Menard!
By the saints! A miracle!
Menard, you old blackguard!
Esperandieu, well I never!
How on earth did you get here?
That's a very long story.
You can tell it later.
This winter, over a hot chocolate.
We have a mummy to wake and sister to save.
Just joking!
Yes, she's just joking.
Well, I'm not joking.
Tired after your trip?
Indeed I am. Very tired.
Want to go home?
Yes. I should be going home.
I'll take you.
Yes, take us home.
Sure, take him home.
Goodbye, ducky!
What's that...
Saint Hubert?
Esperandieu!
Not now!
What's wrong?
Saint Hubert.
Get out!
Stupid hound!
You worthless nincompoop, who allowed you to shoot at science?
I am Justin de Saint Hubert, big game hunter...
Big game hunter?
I'm a hunter, too, but I only shoot black sheep.
You seem a fine specimen.
Stop that! you've no right!
One!
No!
Two!
No!
Three!
No!
Four! Five!
No! no! no!
Don't die now, please!
I'll do my best.
Let me help.
If you want to help, look after the pterodactyl.
But the Professor's bleeding.
They're connected!
Don't ask how or why.
If we lose one, we lose both.
Don't let it happen.
Yes, of course!
Leave it to me.
Twenty-eight, Rue du Four.
What do I do now?
Place antique objects in a circle around me.
The older the better.
Yes, that one.
I'm going to need to... put this bandage on you.
I'll be right back.
There! What now?
Now... I'll try to establish contact with the mummy to see if it agrees to entrust the keys to me.
Excellent!
What keys?
After death, the whole body shrinks and locks itself in the mind which never die.
I discovered the key to communicate with the mind.
Wonderful!
It's going to work.
Maybe... some procoagulants... in a nub... of butter?
Professor!
Please, stay with me. Please, just a little longer!
Bless you.
Thanks.
Sorry about the glass.
Forget it. I have to tidy up anyway.
What a shame he's gone. I'd have liked to get to know him.
What have we here? I detect a certain likeness.
She's my sister.
She doesn't look well.
Yes...
But...
Actually...
With the knowledge you possess, perhaps you could try to bring her back to life?
I have some modest talents, but not that one.
What? You're not a doctor?
Absolutely not.
I'm a nuclear physicist.
I deal in figures, signs and equations. nothing very extraordinary.
Doctors don't leave the pharaoh's side, and are buried next to them, right next door.
May I make some tea?
Be my guest.
Very kind of you.
Kindness is a highly prized quality in our dynasty.
I admit that throughout this adventure, you have been very hospitable towards me, and I'd like to thank you.
You could hear?
Everything.
And see? Like when I...
Everything.
Don't blush. With this body, you appreciate that of others more.
Thanks.
I suppose you want a doctor to cure this poor child.
Yes. not only is she my sister, but also my friend, my angel... My twin.
What happened to her?
A freak accident.
A camel?
Tennis.
Lend me your hatpin.
No way!
Thanks.
For nothing.
How do I look?
Like skewered kidneys.
Which I take to mean...
"Gracious!
Why did my parents give her beauty and leave me only bitterness and jealousy?" one game all. New balls.
We'd just turned twenty.
Agathe was so beautiful.
We'd discovered a new sport and played whenever we could.
In order too avoid any sense of rivalry, we never had an actual match.
Our games were strictly friendlies.
Then, in a moment of euphoria, a moment of shared happiness, tragedy struck.
Agathe!
Miss, are you okay?
Miss, wake up!
Move! Please!
Agathe! Move!
No, not that!
Sorry! Stay with me!
Go and fetch a doctor!
Agathe! Agathe!
Agathe! Agathe! Agathe!
She was born a few minutes after me but she departed well before me. It's the only race I'd have loved to lose.
Indeed, a most regrettable accident.
Believe me, I'm very sorry I can't help you.
The Professor did a remarkable job. His mental power must have woken the dead in a radius of 2 km.
But I'm not the right person.
Hold on a sec... 2 kilometers?
Yes, probably.
The waves ripple out like when you throw a stone into water.
And Ramses' doctors never left his side?
They never left the room, even when he was mating. The Mummies of Ramses II.
Patmosis, you're a genius.
Let's go!
Excuse me, I'm looking for the Ramses exhibition.
Yes, quite!
Stop importuning people.
You'll get us noticed.
After 5,000 years in a tomb, can't I have some fun?
I couldn't resist.
It was rather amusing.
First things first.
Then you can die.
Of laughing, if you wish.
Can you open it?
I'm no better locksmith than doctor.
Perhaps you could serve some kind of purpose, or I'll float you down the Seine.
The Nile, it ain't!
Don't get upset. Humour soothes the savage breast.
That's not humour!
Maybe it made the pharaohs laugh, but this is the 200th century!
That's better.
This way, Mistress.
Patmosis!
Yes, Mistress.
Coming, Mistress!
This way, Mistress.
Cut it out!
You're very tense. Relax.
I'll give you a massage later.
You're a chiropractor now?
No, but I studied molecular energy.
For now, stick to opening doors.
Beautiful, eh? Reminds me of when we painted.
All clear?
Look, what's that?
What?
Patmosis!
Leave it to me, Mistress.
Miss!
Waking people, no, but knocking them out, no problem.
Thank you, Mistress.
Oh my god!
They're all jumbled up.
If Ramses saw this...
Wake him, so he can rearrange them.
The faithful first, so they're there when the Pharaoh wakes.
Poor dear, don't want him feeling homesick.
And definitely not insulted, so
I suggest we respect protocol.
I'm in favour of protocol.
Sorry to bother you, are you a doctor?
Are you a surgeon?
I'm looking for a doctor.
No, you're not a doctor!
Doctor anyone?
Great nap. What is that ridiculous attire?
Native costume, your Highness.
Allow me to introduce
Miss Adele Blanc-Sec, a scribe.
Hi.
The natives employ women to write their texts?
Their civilization is still rough and ready, but she is very amicable and waking us was her good idea.
Good idea? I feel I've woken up a little early.
Sorry to wake you, your Highness, I had no choice. It's a matter of life or death.
Life or death?
It comes and it goes.
I'd like my sister's to come back.
Miss Adele woke me up in the belief that I was a doctor.
You? A doctor?
I wouldn't let you clip my nails.
She's looking for a doctor to treat her sister, and we thought that in your great kindness, you might let your personal physician take a look at the child.
You woke me up for such a trivial affair?
Hold on, Rammy! Five thousand years, you've been snoring away.
I've had 5 years of grieving, of suffering with my sister who can't see me.
I'm a poor earth-dweller with no divine protection.
I live everyday with the pain and guilt that never goes away.
Because it was all my fault!
It was my hatpin!
What's this about a hat?
Nothing, I'll tell you later.
Nosibis, my faithful doctor...
See if you can give the girl a little life back, so she can enjoy all this love for her.
Thank you... your Highness.
Serene Majesty?
The doctors said if we took it out, she'd most likely die.
You're insane!
I asked you to cure her, not kill her, you bag of bones!
Calm down, Adele.
Don't interfere.
What's that?
The Pharaoh's entrails.
Charming.
Is the kiss necessary?
Not really, more of a tradition.
It's better to do it now, before she wakes up.
No kidding.
Well... Let's go out and see the sights.
Agathe!
Agathe!
Agathe!
Are you mad, hitting the ball like that?
And I love you more than the whole world.
It was a privilege meeting you, Miss Adele.
Same here, Patmosis.
Apologize to your Pharaoh for me, for being so rude.
And thank him for me.
I will... Mistress.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody, darling. Don't move. Everything will be fine now, I promise.
This way, your Majesty.
What was that?
Sorry to importune you again.
Go ahead.
Which way to the Nile, please?
Why, of course!
They are very curious people.
Cruelly lacking in manners.
I agree, Your Highness.
But they have highly developed artistic talents.
This courtyard, for example, is magnificent.
Quite magnificent!
We should build a pyramid here.
I'm sure it would be a fine addition.
Meanwhile, Sire, perhaps we should rejoin the others?
You are right,
Patmosis. Let's go!
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!
Read all about it! Mummies
Vanish from the Louvre!
There you go, sir!
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!
What's this now about mummies?
It's another anarchist plot.
Call the Interior.
Tuck in, my little Caponi!
Who's it for?
It was for Miss Adele.
She's taken a few weeks' vacation.
Well.
Give them to someone else.
For me? That's so kind!
What's your name?
Zborowsky.
First name perhaps?
Yes. Andrej, with a J, as in...
As in jaguar.
Cup of tea?
Yes.
Enjoy the trip.
Thank you.
Hurry, miss, we're about to leave.
All right, keep your hair on.
Blanc-Sec, Adele.
Thank you.
The woman in the green hat?
Leave it to us.
Hurry up!
It is Miss Blanc-Sec's luggage.
Welcome on board.
Welcome on board.
Hurry. Move fast for the luggage!
Welcome on board.
Hurry up!
How are you? Welcome!
Take this.
Miss Blanc-Sec...
Yes?
These are yours?
Take good care of them.
Sorry!
Good start to the holiday.
Sorry, it was an accident.
That's my bag!
Take good care of it.
Have a good trip, Miss Blanc-Sec.
Saint Hubert!
Caponi! Caponi!
A fine zebra!
I've lost Saint Hubert!
I just lost him! Go and find him!
You put up a good fight.
Please, I'm begging you.
No!
Smile!
No!
Nobody move!
I'm out of ammunition.
Take him away!
You look like a fine specimen, too.
Sit tight.
I'll get reinforcements.
Fine, take your time.
Oh, no!
LA, this is flight 734.
Request to land on 26.
Understood. 734, you may land on 26.
We were on 's concert of our lives and you just disappeared?
Sorry.

You want attention while Jenny explaining safety.
Take the seatbelt and close them tightly over your lap.
Press the button, which disengages the seat belt again.
Flight attendants sit down for departure.
You must attract the belt.

- Why are we silent?
The tower does not have access.
- Why not?
Tell us.
- Captain.
What do we do?
- Hold your position.
We can not wait.
- We must do something.
Willsy, take us to the gate.
Captain, what happens?
87 is the closest.
- I take gate 87.
I need medical assistance.
Let us wait there.
Trunk that aircraft should operate.
Air Traffic Control.
- Right for us.
He sees us.
You have it ruined, lady.
Wrong gate and airport.
TSA needs to Terminal A.
- Evacuate.
Quick!
We need help.
Get them out of the plane.
Get them out of the plane.
What happens?
Wait.
Open gate 87.
I have an injured flight...
TSA 318.
Answer, I need help.
- Why do not they answer?
Do fucking open.
- Tell them to open.
Calm.
Everyone, stay calm.
This woman must be immediately to 's hospital.
Wait.
How do we get out here?
Damn.
Keep the door open for me.
Hurry.
What are you doing here?
- The gate is closed.
We go through the passenger leave out another way.
What about...
- He was exhausted.
We have it under control.
Bring the passengers to safety and then come back with help.
Jenny, come on.
Departure.
Come on.
Where are we?
- Above the cargo space.
Where all things are done that you will never see.
How's your head?
Good work on that plane.
- Thanks.
Where is everybody?
- Everything is abandoned.
This terminal is offline for three hours.
Closed for maintenance.
We need her down the stairs, bring to the hangar.
You help me. Forward.
Quiet, okay? On three.
One, two, three.
That door leads to the main terminal.
That has never been locked.
Do not have keys or something?
- It works here automatically.
They have us in lockdown.
Lockdown?
- What?
Ever heard of terrorism?
Since 9 / 11 changed that.
Super Secure.
Each entrance is guarded and off.
They look at us.
Why we are in lockdown?
- You tell me that.
What is this?
- This is not good.
What are you doing?
You work here...
- Answer. There must be something.
You have to find something, man.
- Silence.
I wave my badge at people.
- Wait.
You hold us up.
- Silence.
The police.
Be careful.
Why sirens?
Attention, flight 318.
Try not to leave the terminal.
Help is on the road.
You are now in quarantine.
Everything goes wrong.
I do not know what to say to them.
We're stuck.
Dad, call me as soon as possible.
Tell me what to do.
Have you called your parents?
They make you wonder.
That's what I do.
Come here.
I just called to 911.
They know nothing of.
What? I do not understand.
What do you earn?
- Nothing.
What is this?
What do they do?
Why expose us so?
How long will this take?
I got a job interview.
My husband waiting for me at the airport.
I'm my sister's wedding r missing.
Do you get the captain.
Someone must take the lead.
I understand that.
- We need info.
My wife is six months pregnant.
- How old are you anyway?
Sorry, I...
- You're not good enough.
Take it easy.
- You gotta right not to keep us here.
She takes it as I bleed can not stem.
If I can get my medical kit,
I 'r may be time to give.
Where's your kit?
- In my pocket.
Ed, can you get me the boot?
- The luggage?
Did you not outside army?
- Get me inside.
The boot is downstairs.
Just where you enter.
Are you sure?
- I did my test on that same plane.
I get sick when I step on that plane?
No idea.
- I have a daughter of three.
She is counting on me, you know?
- They are counting on you.
You must do something. Get help.
Please.
I have not baulk at.
I go along.
- Me too.
I left my wife on that laptop.
I need your help.
Stay here, can you?
Shilah Washington, you'll recognize my bag.
Fast.
Unbelievable.
- What happened?
What now?
Ops, answer.
I have energy again.
The energy is out. Forward.
We are going through.
Answer, I have energy now.
The energy is here too.
Captain?
Willsy?
The staircase is out of order.
Captain Forrest?
Willsy?
Anyone?
There is none.
Stay with me.
Captain.
This is really a mess.
I do not understand.
If he is not within... and everyone is gone...
- Then someone opened the gate.
I'm watching.
I take my laptop.
I have one.
Damn.
- It's only blood.
Damn.
Found.
It's Doc.
I'll see you at the gate.
- Wait.
They had never left when the gate was open.
Right?
- She's right.
The gate is still closed.
It's pretty close.
Please note that we get back to Doc.
Hasten.
Mandy Britts, three sacks.
Get your own damn bags.
We are looking for a bag, with the surname Washington.
They are broken during the turbulence. Sorry.
There goes my five dollars.
There.
What are you doing?
The world's a dangerous place.
I'll never run away.
After what I've seen here tonight, these things are mandatory on airplanes.
Such as belts.
I got it.
Come on, let's go...
Damn rat.
She came right to me.
A large red eyes.
Was certainly not a hamster?
- No, it looked like a rat.
We go.
Doc.
Rifle shots at the plane.
Look at me.
It's all right.
Out, quickly.
Careful.
Doc...
- He's fine.
Lift it up.
Help me.
I got you. Hold on.
Is he?
Let's go.
See if he was bitten.
What was that?
- Nothing. I see nothing.
Look everywhere.
Hello.
Help me.
What the hell is that?
Close the door!
Fucking bitch!
Go though it, we love her.
Go.
Jenny, we heard gunshots.
Keep pressure on it.
What happened?
- On the plane.
She bites and infected another.
- I do not understand.
The Captain... I got him shot.
- Your face is the blood.
The bathroom was empty, filled with blood, without the big guy.
We went in the hole...
Hold on.
I am.
On the side.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
I bite you.
Breathing.
We're safe. I took my gun.
Fortunately, because it sucks.
Why did the energy from?
You left this behind and I took on when your father called.
I would say you should take the stick and then fell all cell phones simultaneously.
My father gave me flying lessons since I was twelve.
He said:
Get on the stick.
I dared not only to fly even with him beside me.
He let the stick go.
We turned.
I had to take control.
I never understood why he did that.
I'll be back.
The door is closed.
- Everything stays on that plane.
Are you sure?
I did not Mr. Bunt. Do you?
I need you.
Come, we gotta go.
Listen.
- What do you want now?
I have something to say.
- You've said enough.
Listen to what she has to say.
Number one: We do not know when we are out of it.
Number two: We must ensure that no one is infected.
That's fucking brilliant.
- Smart.
And who's in charge?
I.
- You?
You know nothing.
- We must vote.
I have this.
- Shoot me down or shut up.
Our captain, Mr. Stubbins in 7A murdered, is dead.
Our copilot crawls through the plane like a beast.
This means that you are my passengers to this race is over.
Is that clear?
Quite clear.
What this is, it spreads through bites.
We do not know.
- I can just show a symptom.
It can spread through the air or locally.
We know nothing.
I think it's rabies.
Rabies people.
People Rabies?
- That it is spread by a bite?
Right?
- Maybe saliva.
Rabies can be cured. Vaccines.
That is you are sick.
There is no cure.
I think this is not rabies.
Rabies does not exhibit the same symptoms in humans.
If the virus does to the brains... the bastard is a threat.
They talked about 's building quarantined, somewhere in LA.
An apartment building.
- We also because we are from LA.
Twice an evening.
How often would that occur?
And your girlfriend, she is not infected?
No, she's bitten, but has no symptoms.
Doc!
Come here.
Gives you immediate medical kit.
Do not let him escape.
Do not let him bite.
He has bitten him.
One, two, three.
Did he bite you?
- No.
Are you sure?
Make it good.
This is wrong and inhuman.
He is bitten.
- It's for our own safety.
On three.
One, two, three.
You're in charge, right?
You have no choice.
I found something on the rat.
- What?
He has a label to.
- That 's a lab rat. Albino.
It's like that rat from the hall, and he behaves like that.
Like the other rats?
- Yes, and like the people.
This is because 's lab rat?
- How does a rat in the hold of a plane?
Ask him to.
- Who?
Did you participate in your lab rat cage?
No, those were the hamsters my niece.
When you came on board,
I saw tails in your cage.
What is he talking about?
I had hamsters when I was little.
They have tiny stumps, you barely see. No tails.
Hamster that I got from my parents, who had just returned from Ecuador.
I now know that hamsters no tails.
You making that up.
- Can I talk to you?
Of course.
Please tell me you're not rats in 't plane brought.
George is a bit confused now.
He and we all have 'n experienced a lot that night.
You tell me the truth?
You may not lab rats in your hand luggage.
Impossible. I was security never passed by.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
I accuse you, but I got better...
He's dead.
Hobbs, say it.
- The health service is underway.
The health service is on its way.
Understood, we are there.
How are you?
- He's lying.
You can not prove it, George.
You believe him because you like him.
The ammunition must be here somewhere in it.
Are you okay with George?
This may sound stupid, but have you seen my briefcase?
Hey, calm down.
You have the weapons to focus.
We want only way.
They should go to the hospital.
- If you cooperate, you are here quickly.
Listen to me...
- Put that camera away.
Put that camera away.
- Get rid of it.
What's that?
- Everything will be explained later.
I see a weapon.
- Deliver your weapon.
Give your weapon.
You three, here.
Get those people out. Both.
Relax.
- Forward.
You two, that table free.
The rest is here in a row.
What happens?
- Protocol, for your safety.
You are all exposed but we do not know who is infected.
You have been identified.
- Everything is explained.
What is that? What do you give them?
Who follows?
- I will not inject unknown.
Right?
However, Nial?
- Everything is explained.
Do it now.
- Take it from here if you want Protocol.
I'll go first.
Say your name into the camera.
This is Louise Tred Well.
The cat is infected.
- Keep them at bay.
Come on.
Open it.
We have a wounded.
Put that fucking door.
Let us out.
Forward!
Go to the door.
He's alive.
Pull him inside.
Make fast the door.
He was shot in the leg.
I hear them.
- They come from the plane. Forward.
I heard them.
- Let's go. Fast.
Ahead, lady.
Forward.
We have to get the boot.
This way.
Forward, fast.
Get in, quick.
What are you doing?
- Are you?
Step. Fast.
What are you doing?
- Get in.
He is infected, leave him behind.
He will murder you.
- I 'm not leaving.
Paula I have left.
We need to get her.
If your girlfriend is there,
You want her to look.
I do not understand.
She followed the protocol.
There is no protocol.
Perhaps I have too much time in the army, but everyone got another injection.
Medication.
- How to get there at?
Each capsule had a different color, own label.
Is this true?
- I can not talk about it.
I will give you explicit consent.
What happens?
How much do the health of this?
It is not the health, but the CBDT.
Chemical biological domestic terrorism.
Terrorism?
Homeland Security. An apartment
LA is under quarantine.
Our units have a 'n few hours to go.
No one has ever returned.
We found a
Bio-thermal laboratory.
Some kind of "doomsday" code.
- Wait.
Has anyone made this?
- The virus, yes. They sought 's remedy.
An antidote.
They have a clinical test done on humans.
We have a survivor test person found.
You could "to ostracize.
What they gave them, it was only much worse.
Rats were there too?
- Rats are carriers.
We thought we'd escape were yet to hold.
Our orders were you alive and to keep together.
You have no idea what it is or how to be treated?
If anything I have seen here, spread throughout our population... and we have no idea to address it...
- We are now testing the rats?
National security.
- They let us out of here again.
Put the gun down.
How about now?
There is no way out.
We will all die.
- It'll be fine.
Lie not constant.
There is no way out.
There must be a way out,
We will find a way out.
I will not die.
- It'll be fine.
Shut up.
The rain...
- What?
This terminal is filling up during heavy rainfall.
They say there is a tunnel, never properly closed.
There is a tunnel?
- Are you serious now?
Terminal F would vanish, it would never be built... the FAA had no money.
Where is that tunnel?
- No idea... but I know where to look.
We need to...
Shoot him down.
Shoot me.
- There are no more bullets.
George, press the green button.
Follow me.
Be quiet.
Let's have at the office.
We must find the tunnel to Terminal F.
Henrie is true?
They have her address.
- Move!
Forward.
Come on, do not stop.
What was that?
Go on, keep walking.
Stand up, Jenny.
She is infected.
Paula?
Paula, stay where you are.
Give me the wrench.
Come on.
Come on, I got you.
Go on, boy.
You go for it.
- There it is.
Inside.
Look for blueprints of Terminal F.
Where to look?
- In the corner stands.
What are you doing, George?
Have you stolen from Henrie?
- Look at this.
Found. The design of Terminal F.
Where are we now?
Terminal F. I think this is it.
We are here and the entrance to the tunnel in a shaft.
Here, somewhere behind the staff room.
- How do we get there?
We go through the security area to the hangar.
We have through the wall, in that space between.
Once we are here, we only to the service tunnel.
Then we went to Terminal F.
They have your address.
That's a bite impression.
But it is okay, right?
As you do this in your possession.
I found it in his briefcase.
Give it.
Is that the antidote that you tested in that apartment building in LA?
Give me, George.
- Who are you?
As I told you earlier,
I hear the good.
I wanted to mean something.
Responsibilities for the future.
By causing a nuisance?
- Nobody else is doing something about it.
Do you?
- How many people do you want this killing?
As much as necessary.
- So you decide who survives?
No, we do. Because the alternative is, no one survives.
Our population keeps growing and consume while our planet is dying.
Do not let me shoot you, George.
Enter here.
Against the wall.
Against the wall.
How did you pass
Security got?
Like the rats.
Just as I found out that my lab in LA was in danger and had to leave the city.
Supporters of this case.
The same that my arrival
Kansas City safely be arranged. and help me, once I'm here.
Antibodies to the virus control so the infection does not damage the brains.
What is that?
You're a smart guy.
Smart enough for you ever to join us.
Fuck you.
Do not believe all the nonsense of the government.
They entitle people like us, as extremists or terrorists... because it is easier than the truth.
What do you think is the truth then?
The earth can be a good use plague.
One that will kill you.
Amazing.
I feel nothing.
Does it?
- I've done the tests themselves in LA.
That would not have been better.
- Shut up.
Time to go, George.
- No, let him go.
This is his only chance.
Forward.
Come on, Jenny.
We have to chase them.
Up.
I'll get to you later.
- Take this.
I'll go first. I grab him well.
- Fast.
Let me go.
I am.
- Shilah, what is that?
Night vision goggles, the health has left behind.
Then you see them before they are yours.
George Henrie and there are went inside. It's a trap.
How did you find?
Here.
It was not my day to fly.
Care for George and kill the rat.
I will try some time for you to win.
Hey, sucker biting,
I'm here, assholes.
These are just mice.
Hold on, George,
I'm coming down.
No, the antidote did not Henrie.
Do not come down.
- There is a flashlight at your feet.
I do not see him.
I'm coming down, stay where you are George.
No, do not come.
Do not.
Return to top.
Stay there.
Please go back.
Please do not throw the camera.
You there.
Did you hit him?
Where is he?
- Look.
Involved?
Did he bite you?
- No.
What happened?
- When we climbed down... he tried to bite me.
The terminal.
- They burn it off.
Come on, here.
It is the tunnel to Terminal F.
- It is closed.
There is no way out.
Stay here.
It's locked,
We never come here.
Yes, but I get it get it.
- It makes no sense.
Stay where you are.
We gotta go.
- I'm not going inside.
You have no choice.
Trust me.
I can not. Really.
There is no other option.
You are my eyes.
Tell me what you see.
I see nothing.
It's just the baggage tunnel.
I'll be right behind you.
Promise?
- I promise, and now.
Keep going.
Can you see anything?
Go on, George, do not stop.
Hurry.
Why do you stop?
Go on.
Do not stop.
I'm infected.
Go on.
No, that's not true.
Just as we reached that point.
I'm sorry.
I feel it.
I do not have much time.
It'll be fine.
- Go.
Your nothing wrong.
- Leave me here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Leave me here.
You will not hurt me.
I'm not leaving without you.
Good?
I think I see...
Jenny, we made it.
Come here.
I'm not leaving without you.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN
Help me with the dumb waiter.
Open it.
Take this.
Marilia, are you there?
Yes.
Send up more cloth and double-sided tape.
I can't get it until tomorrow.
OK.
I also wanted a needle, thread and scissors.
You're joking, right?
Yeah.
Our face identifies us.
For burn victims, saving their lives is not enough.
They need to have a face even if it's from a corpse.
A face with features... so they can gesticulate.
I have participated in three out of the nine face transplants carried out in the world... and they were the most moving experiences of my life.
Good...
For a shapeless mass to acquire the features that will give it expression... we have to mould the muscles... articulating the facial musculature with the corresponding nerve endings.
MATERNITY HOSPITAL
Vera, I've brought you some opium.
OPERATING THEATER
Can you breathe more gently?
If you want me to stop breathing, kill me.
Don't talk rubbish.
How long will all this last?
Your skin is softer than I thought.
If you don't end it, I will.
If you'd wanted to kill yourself... you'd have tried to cut your jugular.
In any case...
I didn't know your skin was so soft.
Here it is... taken from the animal while it was still alive.
Thank you.
Now there won't be any more burns.
You said that a year ago.
I was hasty.
Tell me if it burns you.
No.
And now?
No.
Now!
I have given the name "Gal"... to the artificial skin
I've been working on... in recent years.
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.
This skin is resistant to every insect bite...
No.
...which means a natural barrier to
...malaria, for example.
Naturally, I've carried out a rigorous quality control... on the tissues implanted in mammals... specifically, in athymic mice... and the results...
...have been spectacular.
This leads me to suppose they would be equally positive... in human mammals.
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?
That was my wife's name.
She was burned to death in a car crash.
In you presentation you stated... that the skin is resistant to insect bites and could prevent malaria.
What makes you think that?
The artificial skin is much harder than human skin... and it smells different.
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito... distinguishes human skin by the smell.
Gal smells different and repels it.
Let's see if we can get rid of him.
That isn't enough.
How did you toughen the skin?
Excuse me.
Let's go somewhere quieter.
There's only one way to toughen skin.
By mutating it.
Yes, that's what I did.
Transgenesis.
Yes.
I transferred genetic information... from a pig's cell to a human cell.
A pig's cell?
It's much stronger than ours.
You're insane!
You know the application of transgenetic therapy... in humans is completely forbidden!
Yes, I do.
And, forgive me, but it seems the ultimate paradox.
We intervene in everything around us... meat, clothes, vegetables, fruit, everything!
Why not use scientific advances to improve our species?
You know how many diseases... we could cure with transgenesis?
Or the genetic malformations that could be avoided?
Don't go on!
I know the list by heart... and I think of it every day.
But even so...
I must forbid you from investigating further... or I'll be forced to report you... to the scientific community.
Over and above what you or I may think... the bioethics are absolutely clear about this.
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.
I did it in memory of my wife... and solely to extend my knowledge.
I remember... the first time you told me about this experiment.
It seemed like a dream then.
And it still is.
The president has ordered me to give it up, indefinitely.
Shit, and it'll be the business of the century.
It will be, but we won't benefit from it.
If you give up research, will you go back to surgery?
Your patients will be delighted.
I don't know.
We've got a waiting list for operations in "El Cigarral".
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.
Do you like what you see?
What do you mean?
Is there anything you want to improve?
No.
I don't want to improve anything.
Can I take it I'm finished?
Yes... and you can boast of having the best skin in the world.
And now what?
Now I'm going to light this opium pipe... and smoke it.
I mean us.
Me.
What are you going to do with me?
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
When?
If you keep on, I'm leaving!
Couldn't we just live?
Live together.
Live together?
- How?
- Like everyone.
You and I aren't like everyone.
Look on it as another of your experiments.
Living together as equals.
That's it!
Here.
I could set fire to the house with this.
I'm yours.
I'm made to measure for you.
And you've just told me that you like me.
Did I say that?
I know you look at me.
Since you brought me here, we practically live in the same room.
In this pocket.
Carnival celebrations are being held on the Gran Via.
You shouldn't have used her face.
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.
There's a resemblance, but she isn't the same.
The resemblance is too strong.
Have you thought what to do with her?
No.
You'll have to kill her or keep her hidden here forever.
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?
If you don't kill her, she'll kill herself.
Stories repeat themselves.
No! Not this one!
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.
You're sick.
If you don't get rid of her... what you feel now will end up devouring you, like a cancer.
When you realize, it'll be too late.
How are you so sure of what I feel if even I don't know?
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.
Fire the servants and don't hire anyone.
What do you want?
To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.
If she was a servant... they've just left and won't be back.
I saw them, but she wasn't one of them.
My mother is prettier.
Go away or I'll call the police.
Zeca!
I'm your son, Zeca.
How dare you come here!
Open the door!
It's Carnival. We're both far from Bahia and I'm homesick.
Look! Like the costume I wore when I was little. Remember?
Little tiger!
I just want to see you for a minute.
Very well, but then you leave.
Whatever you say.
Follow the path and keep going through the second gate.
How did you find us?
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.
He was giving a...
I don't know, something in Madrid.
I went there and then followed him here.
Can't I come in?
No, I'm not allowed visitors.
It smells good.
I'm hungry.
Brute!
The main new items today...
are the Carnival celebrations...
and the daring robbery committed in the Bvlgari jewellery store...
in the heart of Madrid.
It happened last night...
and today we have the first images recorded by one...
of the twenty-four security cameras which protect the jewellery store.
Apart from the thief, who appears in the image...
police are looking for one of the store's employees...
who has been missing for the last twenty-four hours.
As if they were going to find him!
The bastard just had to turn off the cameras... but he changed his mind and left one working.
He'll be rotting in hell now.
And the police are looking for you.
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.
You can hide me here for a few days.
Hide you here?
Not a chance.
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.
I know how to hide.
Anyway, I want Robert to operate on my face.
Robert?
When he gets you on the table... he'll give you a lethal injection!
How could you think he'd operate on you... after what you did?
I'll have to blackmail him.
If I kidnap you, could I make him do it?
You're raving mad.
I'm just a servant.
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.
Even better.
I'll stay here till he comes back.
Where are you going?
- What do you want
- A drink.
Take the bottle, take what you want, just get out!
What's this?
It's a film!
Go away!
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!
Get out or I'll shoot.
Mom... you wouldn't do that to your son.
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.
- It's her.
- It's not her!
How could it be her?
Get out of here!
Keep away!
Marilia?
I heard a noise, like a shot.
Is anything wrong?
I heard voices too.
Marilia?
Marilia!
There.
Who is it?
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.
I can't.
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.
Does Marilia have it?
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.
Where's the key to upstairs?
In the drawer at the corner.
Untie me and I'll give it to you.
No, where is it?
In that drawer, in an envelope.
- It's not here!
- At the back!
There's just an envelope that says "clips".
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!
Open your mouth!
Open it wider, mom!
It all fit before.
Did Robert send you?
No.
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.
He saved me.
Get me out of here!
I'll go anywhere with you!
You're saying that... because I'm on top of you.
No!
Ask me for anything!
What can you give me, apart from a great fuck?
I don't know. Lots of things!
I'll do whatever you want.
You could help me with Robert.
How do you get on with him now?
Great.
- Great?
- Yes.
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!
Yes.
I'll take you with me.
That might soften his heart and he'll fix my face.
If you kidnap me, you can ask him for anything!
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.
Listen...
What?
Let’s fuck in the garden, please!
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.
This tiger wants a bed.
Don't you like it?
You're hurting me.
It's very big.
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.
Yes... and it still does.
It drives me crazy!
Shut up! You're weird, you're distracting me.
Kill her!
Kill them both!
As children, they played at killing each other.
I knew that one day they'd do it for real.
The tiger and Robert?
Yes.
They're brothers... but they don't know it.
At least I've never told them.
I had Zeca by a servant who disappeared soon after.
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.
Their fathers were very different but both were born insane.
It's my fault.
I've got insanity in my entrails.
I'd served at the Ledgards' house since I was a child.
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile... and when my Robert was born, they kept him... and said she'd given birth to him.
But I was the one who looked after him from the day he was born.
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.
When he was seven, he started transporting drugs.
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.
He was on the run and asked us for shelter.
I hid him in an outhouse, but Gal found him... she took a fancy to him... and they ended up running away together.
Their car crashed,
Zeca survived and ran away.
But she...
Robert found her, horribly burned, but still with a flicker of life.
He snatched her back from death at the last minute.
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.
He didn't sleep.
He only rested when he sat by the bed where she was lying... covered with gauzes.
He was intoxicated by the smell of burned flesh.
After the accident, we lived like vampires... in total darkness and with no mirrors.
To everyone's surprise... after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.
The things that a madman's love can do!
One day... when she could finally stand unaided...
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance... singing a song that she had taught her.
And she got emotional.
For the first time in many months, she got emotional.
And it was... like feeling she was alive again.
When she opened the window... she suddenly saw her image reflected in the glass.
She didn't look human.
She was a cinder.
She gave a scream that echoed through the house... and threw herself out the window.
Years later, little Norma... went in search of her mother... along the same road her mother had taken.
Through the window.
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.
Did you pray?
Yes.
Everything you told me.
Shall we go inside?
Do you mind if we leave it for tomorrow?
The tiger really messed me up.
As you wish.
But hold me!
Don't worry, I'll wait.
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.
Thank you!
I'm falling asleep.
Sleep, my love.
SIX YEARS EARLIER
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.
Without your help, he'd adore me less.
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Your daughter is getting on well with my nieces.
She seems much better...
At least she isn't afraid of people now.
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come to ask if we can leave.
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.
To you!
You've had him long enough, it's my turn.
Enjoy him, darling.
Excuse me.
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Sweetheart, it's me!
There, there!
What about this one?
Yes, but... no.
And it looks a bit old.
It's not old, it's vintage.
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.
No flowers.
Something like this?
Not stripes either.
No stripes.
Something graphic?
Graphic?
Like this?
I'll come back another day.
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.
Cristina...
Here. On the house.
Put it on and we'll go partying.
I'm meeting my girlfriend.
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.
It'll look great on you.
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.
You're so mistaken!
Because I don't like men?
Because you don't like me.
In any case...
I've got pills to get you in the mood.
You shouldn't take that shit.
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!
I'm off.
Where to?
Home, to get changed.
How come?
I'm meeting my pals.
I think we're going to Casilda's party.
Were you invited?
Jorge knows one of the nieces.
We're just going to the dance.
Well? Are you coming?
Leave her alone, you pain.
Good afternoon.
Hello.
My wife has left us... and I was wondering if you'd want her clothes.
- Josefina?
- Yes.
Well... we don't have anything for fat women...
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.
They're very nice.
We'll look at them and let you know.
- Of course.
- It's this, right?
Yes.
It's heavy.
It certainly is.
But... did she leave or has she disappeared?
Both things.
To be honest... she does it regularly.
We're used to it.
So the next time she does it... she'll have to leave naked because I'm selling her clothes.
I'll show you the garden.
What a party!
Fresh air!
You're all stoners!
I'm Vicente.
I'm Norma.
Your friends have gone.
All the better, right?
Are you stoned?
Stoned?
Have you taken any pills?
Yes.
Cipralex 20...
100 mg of Deprax...
2 g of Trankimazin.
I don't take Rohipnol now.
And Lyrica, of course.
Shit!
I'm high as hell too.
High?
Yes.
You're not from here, are you?
No. Are you?
Yes, but I want to get away...
I'm sick of these high heels!
And this jacket!
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.
Wait.
I'll leave you naked.
You're so pretty... and different.
I'm different too.
Are you in treatment too?
No.
Do you think I should be?
I don't know.
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...
"I Need To Love".
This is also for the bride... with all my affection.
No!
Shut up!
Stop!
Cristina...
If I left, you'd stay here with my mother, wouldn't you?
Yes... but where are you going?
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.
That's because of all the stuff you take.
I haven't taken anything in a week.
Then it's because of that.
So should I take it or not?
It's best not to.
I'm going out.
Now? Without finishing it?
Yes.
Are you coming for supper or will you be late?
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.
Are you leaving that mess?
I'll finish it tomorrow.
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?
Son of a bitch!
Bastard!
Are you crazy?
Don't shoot!
Help!
Help!
Come in.
Sit down, please.
Thank you.
I was told there's news.
We found the bike, totally destroyed, at the Finisterre cliffs.
And the body?
Nothing.
It must have been washed out to sea.
We're very sorry, ma'am.
My son is alive.
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike... but my son?
He could have been kidnapped.
Until his body appears, you must keep looking, please!
We've talked about this already, ma'am.
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!
If he is, he's far away.
All his friends that were questioned, even your assistant... all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.
But he said he'd be home for supper.
Cristina heard him.
If he didn't call me, it's because something happened.
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.
Norma...
Sweetheart...
I won't touch you.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Norma, love.
Everything OK?
Yes.
It's me, Norma.
You can come out, the men have gone.
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.
We tried... but she can't stand any kind of fitted clothing.
She rips it off.
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think you should visit her so often.
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.
And she gets worse when she sees you.
In her mind, she's convinced you attacked her.
I just found her lying there!
Why can't you get that into her head?
She identifies you with the rapist.
Maybe... we let her out too soon.
It was your idea that she should socialize.
She was getting over her social phobia.
How could I know... someone would try to rape her while she was with you.
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!
Help!
Get me out of here!
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.
You'll eat and drink now.
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Come over here, you bastard, and set me free!
Turn around!
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.
But, why?
I haven't done anything.
You'll be more comfortable there.
Eat.
Thank you!
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.
I've been alone for so long.
Wait, please! Don't go!
Please, don't go!
We have to talk.
My condolences.
We did what we could.
It wasn't enough and you did it very badly.
I'm going to report the hospital, and you in particular... for homicidal negligence.
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...
You really want to work today?
Yes.
You should rest and try to forget.
I couldn't sleep, and working will keep my mind occupied.
- Call the whole team.
- OK.
My mother will be very worried.
I never stay away without calling her.
You have a daughter, haven't you?
Why do you say that?
The toys...
My daughter is dead.
We buried her today.
I'm sorry.
And now, some aftershave.
Why did you shave me?
That's a good question.
Yes?
It's us.
I'll let you in.
If he says we're late, say there were two accidents on the road
You know how he is about punctuality.
Good evening.
You're late.
There were two accidents on the road.
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.
When you're ready, we'll start.
Two accidents, one near that town...
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.
He isn't.
He's 27 and he knows exactly what he wants.
It's a particularly confidential case.
What's happened?
What did you do to me?
A vaginoplasty
No...
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.
It's very important.
As you've just seen, the operation was successful... but the tissues of the vagina are still very tender and could stick together.
But don't worry, it's easy to prevent that.
You...
You have to keep the new orifice open... and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.
Think that your life depends on that orifice... that you breathe through it.
In this case... there are several dilators of different sizes.
Start by inserting the smallest one.
It will hurt at first... but in a few months... the largest one will fit without any effort... and the skin... will be perfectly healed.
This is very good.
How long have you been using the last dilator?
Four weeks.
Can I go now?
- Go where?
- Home.
But we've just started.
What else are you going to do?
You'll see, when the time comes.
Why are you doing this?
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?
In that spectacular house?
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.
I don't think I actually raped her.
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?
I'd taken a lot of pills and I can hardly remember it.
Well I didn't take anything and I'll never forget it!
What are you going to do now?
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?
They're like drops of water sliding along a glass surface.
The marks on your skin will disappear.
There's still work to do.
But to put you mind at ease, there'll be no more burns.
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.
It'll also give you support and mould you.
Get used to wearing it all the time... like a second skin.
Put it on.
Will you zip me up, please?
Bitch!
Stop!
Give me the key or I'll come up and stab you!
Stay where you are!
I'll slit my throat... and then you'll have no toy!
You wouldn't dare.
We were lucky.
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
I can't keep calling you Vicente.
From today, your name is Vera.
I don't know if you're there.
I'm returning the makeup book and the makeup.
Do what you want with them.
...and you can practice it anywhere...
on a hospital bed, in jail.
There's a place where you can take refuge...
a place inside you...
a place to which...
no one else has access...
a place that no one can destroy.
To access that place there is yoga...
an ancient technique.
It's a place where you'll find peace, where you'll find tranquillity...
freedom.
But you must practice it...
continuously, intensely...
and then you'll achieve it.
YOGA BOOKS
My Cigarral!
I missed it so much!
These four years seemed eternal!
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.
I thought you'd forgotten me.
I thought that... at least you'd have called me when Norma died.
My poor child.
To throw herself out the window!
I'd rather not talk about it.
As you wish.
But I'm going to miss her so much!
Let's go to the kitchen.
I'm parched.
Don't look at the surfaces.
Everything has to be cleaned.
Call the agency and hire the help you need.
You've installed more televisions.
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.
I'll explain.
From now on, you'll look after her.
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.
You've put on your uniform.
You don't have to wear it.
I like the uniform... because it means we're together again.
Who is she?
I told you.
Her name's Vera.
What's she doing?
She's writing on the wall.
I can see that.
It smells of croquettes.
She called me on the intercom... and asked who I was and what day it was.
When I told her she started writing on the wall.
I don't want her to take liberties with you.
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.
She reminds me of someone.
All the women I've operated on end up reminding you of someone.
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.
I don't trust you.
If you did, it would be much easier for the three of us.
Pass me the tray.
No. I'll take it up.
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Breakfast.
Thank you.
Where's Marilia?
In the kitchen, grumbling.
She doesn't like anyone else looking after you.
Last night... before we went to bed... we talked a lot and we made a promise.
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.
You promised me that there'd be no more locked doors... that I could see all the TV channels... that I was free.
And I promised you that I'd never leave you.
Don't let me down.
It's all I have, Robert.
Your promise and mine.
Have you really thought about what we're going to do?
When we're in the streets she could push me and run off.
She promised not to.
And you believe her?
You're like a child.
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!
That's enough!
I'm sorry I took so long.
I've put on high heels to practice.
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.
Thank you.
Come along, child!
Have you a problem with me?
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.
I want to talk about the clinic.
I told you on the phone.
After talking to the president...
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.
But if things are done carefully, there's no reason to worry.
It's not just that.
I've got other plans that don't include operating.
If you don't want to operate, we'll rent the clinic from you.
I'm speaking for all the team.
Our main patients love the isolation here.
I said no, Fulgencio.
And now I'd like to be alone.
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.
Are you still here?
I'm leaving now... but first I'd like you to see today's paper.
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.
We gave him a sex change.
He disappeared from his home on September 10, 2006... as you can see.
And?
I was always surprised he wanted to get a cunt... without hormones.
He only wanted a cunt.
He's much more muscular now and he's working in L. A... in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?
It says that his mother is still searching desperately for him.
Don't go there.
Those documents you gave us were all false.
It wouldn't be the first time... we accepted false documents.
Why do you think our clients prefer this place?
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.
I think you kidnapped him... and you've been experimenting on him in every sense.
You told us... you'd tested your new skin on athymic mice.
Knowing you as I do...
I think you'd have no scruples about testing it on a human being.
On Vicente, for example.
Do you know what would happen to you... if the scientific community found out you used transgenesis... on someone you'd kidnapped?
I don't like threats, they end up infecting me.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Get the hell out of here!
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.
And... what's that transgenesis?
A cream?
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.
And my name isn't Vicente, it's Vera.
Vera Cruz!
And I was always a woman!
Give me a cigarette.
Thank you.
No, I thank you.
Does it still hurt?
Yes.
Shall we do it from behind?
Wouldn't that hurt more?
- Wait...
- What?
Just today I bought lubricating cream.
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.
I'm sure I put it in my new purse... but I can't find it.
You must have left it downstairs.
I'll go and get it.
Vera!
Hurry up!
At last!
I thought you'd gone.
Not yet.
Come on...
What are you doing?
I'm going to kill you.
This is a joke, right?
Call it what you want.
But you promised!
I lied.
Robert?
Robert?
He's asleep.
I heard a noise.
Yes, so did I.
Go back to bed, it was nothing.
Robert!
My son!
Come out of there! Bitch!
Where are you?
I knew it.
Hello.
You see to her.
Good morning.
What did you want?
Is anything wrong?
Are you all right?
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.
Do you know me?
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.
I had to kill two people to get away.
You have to help me.
Look.
Do you remember this dress?
Before Casilda's wedding, six years ago...
I said I'd give it to you... just to see how it looked.
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.
At that moment we were alone, remember?
Is anything wrong?
Come here a moment, ma'am.
Why are you crying?
I'm Vicente.
911. What is your emergency?
I'm at the gas station on Aspen
Hill, and a man just fell.
I think someone's been hurt in our parking lot, a lady.
Where's the person at now?
She's laying in the parking lot, sir.
What's going on there?
I think this guy's lawn mower fell on him or something, man.
Like, it sliced him up maybe.
I don't know.
Oh, my God!
A man has been killed in front of me!
Oh, God!
Ma'am, calm down.
How did he die, ma'am?
I don't know?
I don't know?
Reporting deadly news: a bizarre shooting spree in Maryland has led to a statewide manhunt.
The police have no confirmation whether the shooting...
A violent rampage ravaging the Washington, D.C., area, bringing the total number of victims to seven.
They all appear to be random victims.
Don't appear to be anyone's enemy.
Don't appear to be involved in anything coordinated, just simply random targets, innocent people.
Aspen Hill City Police.
This line is recorded.
Good morning.
Don't say anything. Just listen.
We're the people that are causing the killings in your area.
We've called you three times before to try to set up negotiations.
We got no response.
People have died.
The search continues for the man and men responsible for the seemingly random shootings across the D.C. area.
Authorities now suggest that the killers may be traveling in a...
You need to send an ambulance.
A woman was cleaning a car...
This woman was just hurt!
She's bleeding from everywhere!
I can't do nothing for her!
Could it have been a gunshot?
Now saying that they believe the sniper is likely to be working with an accomplice.
To look out for a
1990 Chevy Caprice with a New Jersey license plate number.
They have taken two men into custody in connection with the sniper case.
It appears that the men were sound asleep inside their car at a rest area.
Maryland residents can rest easy tonight, knowing that the killers who terrorized the suburbs of Washington, D.C., are now behind bars.
You stop that now.
That's enough!
You know that's the way it go.
You want to eat,
I'm gonna have to work.
I'm gonna come for you as soon as I can.
You want to be a spoiled child, then?
Please, Papa, can I have one?
One what? I didn't get anything.
Yes, you did!
Oh.
We saw you!
Oh, did you?
Yes!
Hmm, let's see.
Oh!
Thank you.
And one for my princess.
Thanks.
Come on.
Tomorrow when I wake up, I'm just gonna look like a little circle candy.
♪ We'll catch a fox and put it in a box ♪
♪ And then we'll let him go ♪
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪
♪ We'll catch a cat and put it in a hat ♪
I'm hungry.
You're hungry?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Are you hungry too?
Not really.
Uh, I'm hungry too.
How far is it?
We're almost there.
I'm tired of walking.
Is that boy following us?
You all right?
Hey.
You okay?
Come on.
Is that boy gonna stay with us, Papa?
Maybe, baby.
Maybe. Hey, lay down.
When is Mama coming?
Mama's not coming.
Why not?
Hey.
You guys are on a special vacation with Papa, remember?
And if you saw Mama, then you wouldn't see Papa anymore.
Why?
Don't worry about it.
Okay?
Is that what you want? You want Papa to get in trouble?
No.
Hmm?
No.
Leave my papa alone!
Leave my papa alone.
That's right, baby.
Mmwah!
Okay, lights out.
Night.
Oh, boy, sorry about that.
So has your mother done this before?
She always leave.
And you don't have anybody else?
What are we gonna do with you, huh?
Mama, me did write you one letter, but I didn't know where to send it, so me burn it up.
If you come home, you're not gonna find me here.
I am somewhere else now.
The man up the road, do you know him?
I met him in autumn.
He let me stay and work for him.
Me get a job now.
The other tourist, him gone, but him still there.
He is American.
He teaches me to talk like an American.
He says I can be an American too.
Him name John.
What state do you live in?
Washington.
There are two.
Well, one's the capital and... the other one's just a place.
Which one's yours?
Just the place.
She not coming back, is she?
I don't know.
When I was your age, I used to play a game called "life is not fair."
You know why they called it that?
'Cause life is not fair.
It sucks, but you got to play.
I don't know, maybe... she wants to come back, but she can't.
Maybe she's dead.
What'd you say?
Hope she is.
Hey, stranger. Welcome back.
And who's this now?
That's my son.
That's not your son.
That's my other son. Are you okay?
Sure, sure. Just busy, busy, busy.
Did I leave a shirt here?
A blue one?
Maybe.
Yeah?
Check.
Well, let me go wash up quick.
You guys can say hello.
So, uh, visiting your dad?
Hey. Is it okay if we stay tonight?
Why didn't you tell me about him?
I'm not gonna catch him going through my underwear drawers or something, am I?
Hey.
Can I get you to go out for a little bit?
Don't get lost.
Okay.
May I take your order?
Do you have cheap burgers?
Change your whole life if you're ready, sir.
The United States Army is hiring.
Yes, you sir.
You got a minute for your future, son?
How old are you?
Listen, you're a little bit too young, but you come back in a year, you understand?
You come back.
We'll be ready for you.
Have yourself a good day.
Change your whole life if you're ready, sir.
Hop on.
This used to be my neighborhood, you know?
I used to live here.
People used to live here.
Real people, I thought.
Everybody turned into ghosts.
It was like I didn't exist anymore.
Well, not everybody.
Some of them turned out to be vampires.
Suck me dry.
People I would've never expected.
My wife.
Just one day I woke up, and I don't know how I didn't see it before.
It's evil. Real evil.
There are some evil... people in this world.
Like here.
The lady who lives here, that's a real piece of shit.
Testified against me in court.
That's what they do.
They take your kids away and say that I kidnapped them.
How can I kidnap my own kids?
They're my kids.
And then she just gets to live here like nothing ever happened.
The fucking vampire.
I hope she dies.
Vampires can't die.
They're already dead.
That's right.
'Cause they aren't people.
What kind of person breaks up a family like that anyway?
Just like the Army. They promise all these things, then they take them away.
It doesn't matter if you have skills, something to offer.
They just chew you up, expect you to keep your head down and march right into the slaughterhouse.
Once you see what is happening, you've got to fight it.
It's insane not to fight it.
Hit back.
You give them the slaughterhouse.
Well, what do we have here?
Hey, man, we don't want any trouble.
Well, that's tough, cause you are the fucking trouble.
No trouble. Just a good-looking black man running on a hot day.
Like I said.
When did you get back?
That's confidential.
Hi. I'm Ray.
Nice kid... a little too talkative.
So I was about to go blow off some steam.
Care to join?
Absolutely.
Hop in. You, in the back.
See...
I can't take her to court 'cause
I don't know where she is, not that the court would do any good.
They never give custody to the father.
So what am I supposed to do?
I don't know.
Pray for a earthquake, fucking bolt of lightning, act of God, some shit.
It's all you. Let's go.
Kid's a fucking natural.
How does that feel?
Pretty good, huh?
Fucking letting her go?
But if you really want to make a difference in the world... you're gonna want to go... with my old friend... the widow maker.
Fuck a duck.
It helps if you actually try to hit the damn thing.
Maybe I ought to shoot at some birds.
One of them will fly into a bullet by accident.
Want to try it?
Easy now.
Lady's got some kick.
All right, press it more into your shoulder.
All right, but with a light touch.
Go slow.
Hah!
I told you the kid was a natural.
You okay?
Oh, come on, now. Please?
I'm sorry. I can't.
Why not?
I mean, how does a voice this sweet go so sour on me?
I'll get in trouble.
Oh, please. Come on, please.
There's a note in the file.
That says what?
That says I can't give out any information.
Are you married?
Do you have kids?
I don't think...
Oh, come on.
Is it an emergency?
It might be.
Something terrible might happen.
Hold on.
Here you go.
Hello?
Yes, hello. I'm here.
They're not enrolled anymore.
Yeah, I know that.
My wife took them.
Look, I am just trying to find out where they went.
I don't have that information here.
Um, well, maybe there's a record of, uh, the...
Uh, I don't know, um...
Is that him?
Yes, this is him.
Hello. This is the vice principal.
Who am I speaking to?
Hello?
Uh, look, I'm... just a concerned parent just trying to make sure that my children are safe.
Sir, are you aware there's a restraining order prohibiting you from contact with your children?
That includes telephone calls.
I didn't call them.
I called you.
Looking for their contact information.
I'm sorry, sir. We can't help you.
Oh, yeah?
How about I come to your house tonight and you tell me to my face then, you chicken shit.
Excuse me?
America strikes back.
Afghanistan is pounded...
Can I have a Scarsdale?
Sure.
Fucking country, man.
U.S. and British forces have initiated air strikes on terrorist training camps and other alleged military installations in Afghanistan.
Upward of 50 cruise missiles have launched.
Pentagon officials insist that most, if not all of these weapons' are precision-guided...
Getting out of here.
Un-fucking-believable.
Can't believe you're fucking accusing me like I'm some kind of fucking criminal.
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Yeah, well...
I guess it wasn't what it looked like, then.
I checked my tank before I left.
Why would you do that?
No reason.
This is some bullshit.
What are you so pissed about?
Look, I'm pissed because you don't believe me.
I don't believe you because you're lying.
You know, all you had to do was refill the tank, and I would've never known.
Yeah, well, maybe someone's stealing your gas.
Maybe you could've just asked me in the first...
Look, I did not take your little fucking motorbike!
Then what... did he do it?
Did he do it?
Hey, hey, hey.
Because if it's not him, then it's you!
Leave him out of it.
You are starting to sound like my wife.
I'm starting to understand why she left you.
What I am saying is, I want to know who got to you, hmm?
Got to me?
Who got to you?
Got to me?
Man and child, I think it's time for you to leave now.
Wait outside just for a minute.
No, no, no, I think it's time for you to both get out of my house.
Like those guns?
Pretty fun, huh?
I had a rifle like Ray's.
I loved that fucking gun.
Broke my heart to sell it.
Bitch want to call me a liar.
She's a liar!
They're all liars!
Hey, look.
Look, I helped you.
I brought you here.
I gave you all this.
It is not enough just to say the words.
You need to prove it.
Do you love me?
Then I need you to do something for me.
Hey, you looking for Ray?
Yeah, Ray said that we could stay here for a while.
Ray ain't home right now.
Oh, we'll come back later if you want.
Y'all can do what you like.
Thank you.
Say thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
He's polite.
Actually, um... are you in a rush?
You need something?
Just one quick thing.
And what's that?
I just need you to come inside and look at something.
Okay. Just a quick look.

They think all this is permanent.
They don't realize the house of cards they're living in.
All it would take is a little push.
A few bodies.
Well, more than a few bodies.
Maybe five, six a day.
For 30 days.
Random targets.
No, not random targets.
When they think it's men... kill a woman.
When they think it's women... kill a kid.
Think it's kids... kill a pregnant woman... a grandma... a cop.
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing, son?
Can I see the bag?
Can I see the bag.
Now, you see these kids?
They think they can do anything.
He's not like the other kids.
He's just confused.
And this is what he took: veggie burgers.
Veggie burgers?
Not the kind of thing they take usually.
What do they take?
Candy. Cold drinks.
Girls take pregnancy tests.
He likes veggie burgers.
I'm supposed to call the cops.
I wouldn't blame you if you did.
You'll talk to him?
Sure will.
Does he listen to you?
He listens to me.
Now, you listen to your father now.
He's all yours.
Let's go.
It's all right.
Put your hands together, son.
Dad...
Dad, what did I do?
Put your hands together.
There, just the wrists.
There we go.
Keep them together, son.
Dad.
There you go.
It's fine.
Sit.
Sit.
Dad, Dad, wait.
Sit down.
There you go.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Feet together, son.
I just want to let you know I'm not doing this because I'm mad at you.
You know that, right?
Dad...
Dad, I'm so...
I'm sorry.
This is bigger than we thought.
I can't tell you why.
But I can lead you.
No.

(MAN ON RADIO) Friends, if you don't have anything else that you want to do, go pick up a box of Krispy Kremes.
I gave you all this.
It's not enough to say the words.
You need to prove it.
Do you love me?
Then I need you to do something for me.
What kind of person breaks up a family like that, anyway?
They just chew you up, and they expect you to keep your head down and march right into the slaughterhouse.
And once you've seen what is happening, you've got to fight it.
It's insane not to fight it.
Hit back.
Give them the slaughterhouse.
I would not allow America...
But to condemn them as the most corrupt nation on Earth.
When you have spilled the blood of so many human beings, how'd that happen?
They dropped the bomb, an atomic bomb, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Have they killed off millions of Native Americans?
I mean, how dare you put yourself in the position of a moral judge.
How dare you.
So we got one more stop.
You gonna come in with me or wait in the vehicle?
Speak up, my friend.
I don't know.
Well, some people do know what they want.
Some people don't.
As soon as you do know what you want... you can start making some decisions.
Well, what do you want?
Stay in the car?
There you go.
Man knows what he wants.
Good morning.
See my son anywhere?
He's not really your son, is he?
He's a chess prodigy.
I'm his tutor.
And I'm George Washington.
Want a beer or something?
Hey.
You live around here?
You got a job?
I go to school.
You go to Lincoln or Covenant?
Yeah.
Which one?
Lincoln.
Oh, me too.
I never see you there.
I just moved here with my dad.
So I guess I'll see you at school.
Yeah.
See you around.
There you are.
Besides, nobody saw you, right?
Hmm?
I don't remember.
If nobody saw you, nobody knows.
You did great!
I think it was the wrong lady!
It doesn't matter.
It could be anybody.
Anybody could've done it.
And if it could be anybody, then we're invisible.
Do you understand?
We can do it again.
No!
Whenever, wherever we want.
Hmm?
They took my gun.
They took my kids, and now I have you.
I don't want to do it again!
Okay.
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
Get up.
That didn't hurt.
Get up!
So what would you rather, hmm?
Go back home and wait on mama?
Huh?
Good.
That's good.
What a nice surprise.
Thank you.
Do you want ice in it?
That's good.
Yeah?
What do you need?
Beer?
Beer.
You know, you know it's not crazy to kill people.
They do it every day.
Are you guys gonna order anything?
I even know who the next one should be.
Hey, Bonnie, you set up?
Or do you want a burger?
Bonnie, get your burger.
Hey, dude.
Mm-hmm.
You got it.
Jamie, Jamie, where's the baby?
Um, Peggy... Peggy took her.
Go check.
See, her car's gone.
I saw her leave 10 minutes ago.
The baby's out front.
Why do I have to know where the baby is?
Find the baby.
She's out front!
Fuck you.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
You can have some more food.
Mm, there's my baby.
Is everything okay?
Yes, ma'am.
There's plenty of food outside.
Why don't you go get something?
I got this.
Yes, ma'am.
Come here.
Come to mama.
Aww, little thing.
Huh?
Do you want to go to the party?
Come on.
Oh, no.
Need any help with that?
Yeah, sure.
You want to take over?
I got it, baby. I got it.
I thought you were bringing me a plate, little dude?
Coming through.
I think it's in the left-hand drawer.
Do you know where they keep the aluminum foil?
Fuck a duck.
Hey, dude.
You want to come give us a hand here?
Lift that puppy up.
I knew we were bulking you up for some reason.
All right, drop it.
All right, there we go.
Bingo!
I knew you were hiding somewhere.
I'm gonna cruise over to the heavy artillery.
It's not real.
He just thinks it's real
'cause he's got a fucking job, wears a suit every day.
But then this black dude comes and wakes him up.
And the black dude says,
"Everybody's asleep.
"You've been asleep.
"And the machines have fucking taken over the world.
"And the machines are using the people as fucking batteries."
So he's got to fight the machine and the people.
It's fucking wack.
Fuck.
Here, give me.
There's a way you can set it so they can't kill you.
Check this out.
Doom.
Firing. Firing.
Ray.
How many people have you killed?
Look at me, man.
I'm a fucking killing machine.
I don't count 'em.
In the Army, I mean.
Fucking Army?
I was in the motor pool.
Like your dad.
I didn't kill anybody.
Oh.
What do you think it feels like?
I don't know, dude.
Bad.
Maybe it doesn't feel like anything.
I mean, it's mostly been burnt.
I got it. I got it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So this guy comes, and he's trying to sell me these steaks, right, which he clearly stole.
I said, um, "Where'd you get the steaks from?"
"Hey, come on, man, just buy the steaks.
I have kids to feed."
I look at him for a minute.
I'm looking around.
He got to be jerking my chain.
I said, "Well, feed 'em steak!"
Hey.
Let's button this up.
I want you to relax.
It's gonna be okay, all right?
Just take a deep breath.
You have a full clip.
It's cocked and ready to go.
When it's time to pull the trigger, you don't stop pulling until he's down.
Hey. Will you do this for me?
Hmm?
Come on, let's go.
I did it. I did it.
You okay?
Yeah.
You hurt?
No.
You good?
Yeah.
Where's the money?
What?
The money. Get the money.
Get the money!
A little banged up on the front end, but that's just body damage.
I'm not afraid to put in some work.
There's nothing wrong with it, not on the inside, anyway.
Just, you know, wear and tear.
Life bangs you up.
Knew the cop that drove it... real dirtbag.
What, do you... you run a business or something?
Nah, this is for my son.
Hey, buddy.
Okay, I'll leave you to it.
What's with the face?
You don't like the color?
Okay, we'll take it.
What's the first thing that you do?
What's the first thing you do?
Right.
You don't want cops messing with you because of a little thing like that.
Okay.
Roll forward ten feet.
You know what you did wrong?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Okay!
Put the car in drive and roll forward ten feet.
Good.
Stop.
Reverse.
Left turn... hard left.
Keep it left. Hit the gas.
Keep it left.
"The primary mission of a sniper in combat
"is to support combat operations
"by delivering precise long-range fire
"on selected targets.
"By this, the sniper creates casualties among enemy troops,
"slows enemy movement,
"frightens enemy soldiers,
"lowers morale,
"and adds confusion to their operations.
"A well-trained sniper, combined with the inherent accuracy
"of his rifle and ammunition, is a versatile supporting arm
"available to the infantry commander.
"The sniper must be able to calmly and deliberately kill targets
"that may not pose an immediate threat to him.
"It is much easier to kill in self-defense
"or in the defense of others
"than to kill without an apparent reason.
"A sniper must not be susceptible to emotions
"such as anxiety... or remorse.
Oh, shit.
So you're the guys.
Well, I pictured you a little different, but, uh... but it's cool.
Yeah, yeah, man, it's cool, you know?
I don't give a shit.
So you boys ain't from around here, huh?
That's cool.
I like your guys', uh...
I like your style, bro.
Well, check it out.
You're gonna want to make a right here, all right?
A nice hard right.
What do you have?
Grenades?
Say what now?
Semtex? Plastic?
Whoa, look, I ain't
Fort-fucking-Bragg, friend.
What do you have, then?
I got land mines.
Land mines.
Land mines.
Yeah, they're German.
Great craftsmanship.
I mean, they're a little old, but a mine's a mine, right?
Come on, man, what's going on?
Look, what the fuck you doing, man?
We can't use land mines.
All right, look, I'm down for your fucking cause, you know, your Black Panther shit.
All right, you want to blow some shit up, blow some shit up.
I don't give a fucking shit, all right?
Please get out of the car.
Shit.
And remember my dad has your address and your telephone number.
I've created a monster.
Go back up!
You've got to brake quick.
If you're gonna get that much speed, you got to get off the gas and brake quicker.
Let's go!
Brake!
Get up to speed.
Brake full as you can. Spin it.
Brake!
Get in there, now!
Go back up!
One more time!
Hey, dude.
How long are they staying?
He's my friend, babe.
Says who?
What the fuck do you know?
What do you know?
"Frightens enemy soldiers, lowers morale."
He's a good kid.
He isn't ours.
He isn't even his.
They got nothing to do with us.
What are you doing, dude?
I'm just thinking.
"Realization of the sniper's presence instills fear in enemy troops."
Okay.
"Influences their decisions and actions."
"The sniper's role is unique in that it is the sole role that becomes more significant..."
That's for me!
"When the target is entrenched or positioned among civilians."

This is Principal Winters here at

We have three sets of records for some students of yours... two brothers and a sister.
Looks like they were transferring schools, and their paperwork got sent to us by mistake.
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

Still up.
Always hated bedtime.
She liked to let them tire themselves out, so...
As if she knew better than me.
I'd have to chase 'em around and pick 'em up, one by one.
Come on, babies. Time to sleep.
Time to sleep.
Well...
It's not about them anymore.
Let's go.
And a very good Friday morning to you all.
It's 6:47 now, and time for your local weather on the 7s.
We have a high-pressure system moving through...
All right, do you have everything filled out for me?
The search continues for the man or men responsible for the seemingly random shootings across the D.C. area.
Authorities now suggest that the killers may be traveling in a white van or truck, putting suburban Washington on alert.
The death toll now stands at five confirmed.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Other incidents also possibly related.
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
911. What is your emergency?
I think someone's been hurt in our parking lot.
There's a woman there standing by, and someone else is running over.
Ma'am, where is the person now?
She's in the parking lot.
It looks like a girl just went and shot herself.
She killed herself sitting on the bench here.
What's going on there?
I think this guy's lawn mower fell on him or something, man.
Like, it sliced him up, maybe.
I don't know.
He's bleeding real bad.
He's a mess.
Ma'am, I need you to stay inside your vehicle.
911. What's your emergency?
Um, we have a lady shot in our parking lot.
I'm at the gas station on Aspen
Hill, and a man just fell.
Is he bleeding?
Where is the person at?
He's laying there.
Get away from the window.
This woman was cleaning her car and...
This woman was just hurt!
She's bleeding from everywhere.
There had been a gunshot.
They think all this is permanent.
They don't realize the house of cards they're living in.
All it will take is a little push.
A few bodies.
Well, more than a few bodies.
Maybe five.
Six a day for 30 days.
Really get their attention.
Random targets.
No, not random targets.
We want to keep them scared.
We want 'em to stay scared.
It has to get worse.
When they think it's men, kill a woman.
And when they think it's women, kill a kid.
And when they think it's kids, kill a pregnant woman, a grandma, a cop.
At the cop's funeral... plant a bomb.
Lots of bombs.
Blow up a whole bus full of cops.
They'd have to call in the National Guard then.
Total chaos.
The system comes down.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Ma'am! Listen to me.
What is wrong?
A man has been killed in front of me!
Oh, God!
Ma'am, calm down.
How did he die, ma'am?
I don't know?
I don't know.
We'll pick a spot in the woods, up into Canada, and start a training camp.
We'll find other kids like you and teach them, send them to other cities to do what we did.
Philadelphia, St. Louis,
Atlanta, Detroit,
New York.
Until there's hysteria... everywhere.
The beauty is, even if we lose, we still wake people up.
We still win.
We still win.
Watch his head.
Okay, there you go.
All clear.
Got one.
Clear.
Lost him.
Guy with the beige suit?
The satchel?
Got him.
Ready?
Go.
Go.
Hey.

Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness.
Morning.
Oh, morning.
Anyone else in the vehicle with you?
Oh, yes, my son.
Uh, I just picked him up from camp late last night.
Mm.
There's no overnight parking in the rest area.
Oh.
Did you see the signs?
No. No, I didn't, sir.
No, it was dark when we got here.
I'll let you go with a warning this time.
See you here again,
I'll write you a ticket.
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Dispatch, about that 1038,
I think I've got something here.
Copy that.
Stay where you are.
Aspen Hill City Police.
This line is recorded.
Good morning.
Don't say anything. Just listen.
We're the people that are causing the killings in your area.
We've called you three times before to try to set up negotiations.
We got no response.
People have died.
Is that your voice?
'Cause it, um, doesn't sound like your voice.
Did he tell you to say those things?
Can I ask you that?
Okay.
Let's talk about your victims then, hmm?
The people that you killed.
How do you feel about 'em?
So what about this one, hmm?
He was, um...
I think he was pumping gas, right?
Just pumping gas with his back to you.
It was more of a diagonal.
Sideways.
Sideways?
Like this.
You know? Twisted his body.
Couldn't get a body shot.
You couldn't get a body shot, so you shot him in the head?
You must be a pretty good shot.
Decent.
Now, everybody's saying... the media... they're saying that these killings are senseless, that they're meaningless, but there's got to be a meaning.
There's got to be a reason.
Was it for money?
Was it for revenge?
Was it some kind of belief?
If you're not gonna answer me...
Since you're asking so many questions, can I ask you a question now?
Sure. Ask me anything you want.
Where's my father?
Open two cell.
Come on out.

131 to dispatch, come in.
Hey hey hey hey!
131, this is dispatch. Go ahead.
This is 131.
We have a male, mid-50s,
with burns over 9% to 9.5% of his body.
Prior to our arrival on scene, patient apparently doused his head,
neck and face with some sort of highly-concentrated acid.
The patient's airway is severely compromised due to fume inhalation.
Vital signs unstable.
Please advise- patient is a criminal suspect.
We're coming in with a police escort right now.
Hi.
Can I talk to him?
He can't actually talk.
All right.
Jesus.
Can I just have a few minutes with him?
We want to know who you are.
We'll find out, you know, sooner or later.
So just save us some legwork by communicating with us now.
Are you a Satanist?
Are you involved in some kind of cult?
'Cause if there's others involved, we'll get them.
We'll find them, believe me.
What's the matter?
Is that it?
That's it, right?
Is there somebody you want to tell me about?
I'm sorry, the nurse at reception downstairs is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you, says it's urgent.
Okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
Thank you very much...
Yeah.
...Reverend Clergy all,
Senator Hawkins...
His daughter?
When was this?
Is she still here?
Well, did she leave any information, a phone number?
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?
Dispatch, this is Baker 17.
I'm gonna need a medical backup.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Somebody help!
There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might.
Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal.
The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past.
Alexis de Tocqueville put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America's greatness and genius-
"Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America."
America is good.
And if America ever ceases to be good-
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later
Now & Later
The really tasty ones
Now & Later
For all-day children's fun
Look at all those pieces...
- Owen!
- Flavors, oh they're wild
Eat some now, save some for later, eat some now, save some for later...
- Owen!
- What?
Dinnertime, honey.
Bless us O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive.
Please guide and direct us through all our days and protect us from evil.
Amen.
So how was school today?
You didn't go and spoil your dinner on me now, did you, Owen?
No.
- Owen, sweetie-
- No, I didn't.
Eat, please, honey.
Hello.
What?
Look, I'm not gonna discuss this now, okay?
We're eating dinner.
We had an agreement, John.
I think maybe you'd better call my lawyer, okay?
Don't talk to me like that!
I will not be spoken to in that way.
...Judgment to fall.
And if we as a people turn back to God...
These are the young people.
The young people are beginning to turn back to God
Who's waiting on them.
If the Lord calls you, then the Word comes.
And the Word came from the Lord...
Hey little girl.
Are you a little girl?
Huh?
Are you scared?
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes
And dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin'
On the radio
Let's sway while color lights up your face...
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
- Stop!
- How's it going?
Stop it. Mr. Zoric.
Okay, Kenny, 10 laps now.
I didn't do anything.
Now!
Or I'll make it 20.
Hey little girl.
Ow! Don't.
Are you a little girl?
Ow.
That's why he won't go swimming.
He doesn't want everyone to see what a little fucking girl he is.
Ow.
Stop.
- Get down. Get his arms.
- Stop.
- Get his arms.
- Ow ow.
Little shit.
Stop.
Ow! Stop! Ow!
Stop, it hurts!
No no no! Shit.
Ow! Stop!
Ow!
Dude, I think he pissed himself.
Oh shit.
What the fuck?
He pissed himself.
Jesus Christ, fucking freak.
- Jesus.
- That was awesome.
Owen! Owen!
Owen pissed himself!
Turning down,
I'm turning in, I'm turning round
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so...
Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so...
Is that gonna be it?
Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so...
Are you scared?
Are you scared, little girl?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You- you guys just moved in, huh, upstairs?
How do you know?
I live next door to you.
Right there.
Just so you know,
I can't be your friend.
Why not?
That's just the way it is.
Well, who said I wanted to be your friend?
Idiot.
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later...
What am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to go out there and do it myself?
Huh?
Huh?
Answer me!
Maybe I'm getting sloppy.
Maybe I want to get caught.
Maybe I'm just tired of this.
Excuse me, everyone.
Let me through here, please.
As some of you may have heard, there was an incident last night and one of your recent graduates here was killed.
I want to assure you that we're doing everything possible to find those responsible for this tragedy.
But in the meantime we need you all to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity, because your safety is our number-one concern.
It's you again, huh?
You know, I really want to be left alone.
- Me too.
- So leave.
You leave.
I've lived here longer than you.
What is that?
What, this?
It's a Rubik's Cube.
You don't know Rubik's Cube?
Is it a puzzle?
Yeah.
Want to try it?
You can give it back tomorrow.
How do you do it?
You gotta get each side one color.
Like that.
You smell kind of funny.
Aren't you cold?
I don't really get cold.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's dance...
Let's dance
To the song they're playing...
Help me.
Hello?
Please.
Help me.
Hello?
Hey there.
Are you okay?
What happened?
I fell.
Yeah?
Well, can't you get up?
No.
How old are you, sweetheart?
Do you live around here?
I live right here.
Can you carry me?
Sure. Sure, sweetheart.
Just grab on, honey, okay?
- Got it?
- Thank you.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
You did it again!
I have to clean it up!
Bitch! Oh you fucking bitch!
Fuck this shit.
Fuck!
How did you do it?
I just... twisted it.
Do I smell better now?
What's your name?
Abby. What's yours?
I'm Owen.
How old are you?
12, more or less.
What about you?
12 years, eight months and nine days.
What do you mean, more or less?
When's your birthday?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Don't you celebrate your birthday?
Do you get birthday presents?
No.
Well, you can have this if you want.
That's okay.
It's yours.
I still don't get how you did this.
Want me to show you?
Yeah.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Yon light is not daylight.
I know it, I.
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Oh, let me be taken, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye...
Shh.
Shh shh.
What were you writing back there?
What do you mean?
In Cook's class.
Let's see it.
No.
No?
Where is it?
Where is it?
- Ow.
- Show me.
- Jesus Christ, dude.
- What?
You explain that to his mom.
It's okay.
She's not going to tell her mom on us, is she?
She fell down on the playground, that's all.
Right?
Right?
Say it, little girl.
Say it!
Come on, man, let's go.
I fell down on the playground.
You have to be more careful, okay, honey?
I hate to see my baby get hurt.
Bless us O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive.
Please guide and direct us for all our days and protect us from evil.
Okay look, I made one for you and one for me.
Are you reading this?
Yeah, it's for school. It's boring.
Come on, look at this.
It's really cool.
We can talk to each other through the wall.
Can you hear me through the wall?
Only sometimes.
Did you hear anything the other night?
Why was your dad so mad?
Where's your mom?
Are your parents divorced?
My mom's dead.
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there?
Just some kids from school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
I've never seen you-
Owen, listen.
What?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't.
- There's three of them.
- Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare and then they'll stop.
What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah, and what if that doesn't stop 'em?
Then I'll help you.
But you're a girl.
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am.
I have to get in there.
Move.
Move.
Dance the blues...
- hi
- hi
Let's dance...
Mr. Zoric?
Yes, Owen?
I was just wondering about the after-school strength training.
Can people still sign up?
Would you like to get strong?
Okay.
4:00 you come- we make you strong.
Cool.
Do you really want to hurt me?
This is Ms. Pac-Man.
Now I'll play.
Do you really want to make me cry?
And...
...when you get the big thing, you can eat them.
- Right there.
- Yeah, let me do it.
In my heart the fire's burning...
God, I hate this game.
You want some?
They're really good.
They're my favorite.
They're really really good.
No thanks.
Well, what do you like?
You can have anything you want.
That's okay.
Oh, okay.
I guess this is it.
Hey.
I guess I could have one.
Really?
Here, it's grape.
I like it.
I'm sorry.
Owen, do you like me?
Yeah.
A lot.
Would you still like me even if I wasn't a girl?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I guess.
Why?
No reason.
So where are you guys from?
How come you moved here?
We... we move around a lot.
Yeah, but why would you move here?
Nobody moves here.
I hate it here.
Someday I'm gonna get out and I'll never come back.
The people here... they're- they're just stupid.
Owen!
God.
Hang on.
What?
You promised me you wouldn't leave the courtyard.
Mom, I've been here the whole time.
Well, come up.
It's time for dinner.
God.
Good night.
Good night.
Are you going out?
Is there a choice?
Please don't see that boy again.
Okay?
Hey, Jett.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
Can I get a ride? Keith went over to see his girlfriend.
Yeah, sure. Get in.
Keith's so fucking whipped, dude.
I can't even deal with it anymore.
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to move the seat.
It's in the front.
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.
Yeah man, anytime.
Keith would have left me stuck there all night.
- Do you need gas?
- Yeah.
Home isn't pretty
Ain't no home for me
Home in the darkness
Home on the highway
Home isn't my way
Home I'll never be
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
-  I can't see no reason...
- Fuck! Fuck!
To put up a fight...
Help!
Help!
Thanks.
- What's up, Jett?
- Hey guys, what's going on?
I'm not the one to tell you
What's wrong or what's right...
Help!
I've seen suns that were freezing and lies that were true
But I'm burnin', I'm burnin'
I'm burnin' for you...
I'm burnin', I'm burnin'
I'm burnin' for you...
What the fuck?
That's my car! Hey, my car!
Stop the car!
What the fuck?
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Greg was in there.
- What?
- He was in the car!
Hey!
Greg.
Greg!
Abby.
An unidentified man has been arrested in connection with the recent ritual murder of a local high school honor student.
The suspect is hospitalized in critical condition with severe self-inflicted acid burns over his face and torso making it impossible so far for authorities to determine his identity.
Eat some now, save some for later, eat some now, save some for later
Now & Lat-
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States,
Ronald Reagan.
Thank you.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my father.
Is he a patient here?
Yeah, they- they brought him in.
The police did.
Oh, I see.
Do you know where he is?
Well, he's on the 10th floor, sweetie, but it's restricted.
Look, why don't we give them a call and tell them-?
No no, that's okay.
Oh my God, the poor girl.
Sweetie, sweetie!
May I come in?
His daughter?
When was this?
Is she still here?
Well, did she leave any information, a phone number?
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Somebody help!
Owen.
Owen.
Hmm?
Can I come in?
No no no, wait wait.
Don't look at me.
But you have to say it- that I can come in.
You can come in.
Close your eyes.
They're already closed.
How did you get up here?
I flew.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you're not wearing anything.
And you're freezing.
Is that gross?
No.
Abby...
Yeah?
Will you go steady with me?
What do you mean?
Will you be my girlfriend?
Owen,
I'm not a girl.
You're not a girl?
No.
What are you?
I'm nothing.
Oh.
You know, it's okay if you don't want to be my girlfriend.
You don't have to make stuff up.
Look, can we just keep things the way they are?
Yeah, sure.
Well, do you have to do anything special when you go steady?
No.
So everything's the same?
Yeah.
Okay.
We can go steady.
Really?
Yeah.
"I must be gone and live or stay and die."
Slow down.
Hockey you play in the center.
Free skating over that side.
Now, everyone, careful of holes in ice.
Stay away from the holes.
I hope you've been learning how to swim,
'cause today you're going in.
Go.
Bring it up and start passing.
Pass pass pass.
Over here.
What do you think you're gonna do with that?
I'm gonna hit you with it if you try anything.
Really?
Wow.
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing.
I think you're just gonna stand there like the little girl you are.
And I'm gonna grab that stick and ram it right up your ass.
And then you're going swimming.
I want to hear click-click-click-click.
Shit, dude. Zoric's right over there checking us out.
Let it go.
We'll beat his little ass later.
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick.
Argh!
Jesus Christ, are you fucking crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Boy
Okay okay, just move.
Please, just move back.
Move back.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't suspend you, Owen.
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could have happened?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path.
He's a good boy.
He really is.
Hello, is John there?
Excuse me, this is his wife.
Who is this?
Hello, Cindy.
Will you please tell John that I called?
Hey there.
Is your mom and dad home?
Yeah.
Mom!
What?
- Oh.
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
- What's this about?
- I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex.
So we're just going around, talking to everybody to see if they know anything.
What kind of incident?
Owen, why don't you go to your room?
- Sorry, guys.
- Jeez, could you take any longer?
- I said sorry.
- Come on, let's go play Centipede.
Man, why are you even in that class? It's so gay, dude.
Whatever.
Hey! Stop!
- How's the cripple?
- Stop! Hey!
Jesus Christ, dude, watch out.
Man, that kid whaled on your ass.
Can you still hear me, bro?
Stop.
Are you going home?
No, we're going over to Mark's.
Can I borrow your keys?
I forgot mine.
Please.
Give me the fucking keys.
Thanks.
- See you at home, little girl.
- Hey.
Shut up.
- We didn't say anything.
- Shut up.
Abby, I did it.
You did what?
They were gonna push me in the hole in the ice, so I got a really big stick and I hit
Kenny in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital.
I almost got suspended, but I didn't.
What you said-
I stood up to them.
Owen.
Yeah?
Hey, you want to go somewhere?
Where?
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
This kid that used to live in the building-
Tommy- he would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends.
And when they weren't here, he'd play ping-pong with me.
He was really cool.
But then he had to move away.
I kind of like it here.
It's cool.
And I don't think any of the adults know about it- it's just us.
So what did you want to do down here?
Uh...
I think I have an idea.
Close your eyes.
Keep them closed.
Let's make a pact.
It only hurts for a second.
Here.
Abby?
Go away.
Virginia.
God damn it, Virginia.
Virginia!
Get- off!
Hey.
Hey.
Somebody call 911!
Mom?
Mom.
Hello?
Dad, can I talk to you?
Yeah sure, pal.
What is it?
Do you- do you think there's such a thing as evil?
What?
What are you talking about, pal?
Can people be evil?
Listen, where are you getting all this stuff?
Is this from your mother-
- all her religious crap?
- No.
You know what, Owen?
Listen listen, put your mother on the phone, okay? I want to talk to her.
She- she's not here.
All right, she's not- okay well, please tell her to call.
Just tell her to call me when she gets back, all right?
Okay?
Dad.
Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?
Your mother- she- listen, look, she has problems.
And I'm gonna talk to her.
So I don't want to hear any more of this.
All right?
All right?
Yeah.
You have a good night, pal.
I love you.
I'm sorry about the last couple of months, you know?
But I'll see you soon- real soon, okay?
I promise.
Maybe next weekend.
Mm-hmm.
I love you.
Can I come in?
You have to say it.
You can come in.
Are you a vampire?
I need blood to live.
But how old are you- really?
But...
I've been 12 for a very long time.
Where's your dad?
He wasn't my dad.
What's all this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I want to go now.
I want to go.
Are you gonna let me?
What are you gonna do to me?
I told you we couldn't be friends.
Hi. Are you Larry?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
I'm sorry to bother you.
How is she doing?
It's been quite a night.
They had to give her over six pints of blood.
We're just waiting to see if her body rejects it.
Well, I won't keep you long.
I just- I need ask you about the description you gave of the little girl.
You said that she had long blonde hair, she was 12 years old and she wasn't wearing any shoes.
- Right?
- That's right.
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Looks like a guy from our building.
Did he have a daughter like the girl you described?
I don't know.
I've only seen him a few times.
Why? Do you think this has something to do with your murder case?
Maybe. We're starting to think that some of them might be involved
- in some sort of Satanic cult.
- What?
We found another body a few days ago- same MO, victim completely drained of blood.
There were two bite marks, small ones, on the victim's neck- just like a little child's.
Jesus Christ.
Oh!
- Virginia, Virginia.
- Stay back. Stay back.
Oh- mm.
We're told one patient was killed in the fire as well as one hospital nurse.
The five-alarm fire started on the eighth floor of the hospital and took most of the day for crews to contain.
The official cause is still under investigation.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You have to invite me in to your home.
What if I don't?
Why can't you just come in?
Is there something in your way?
No no no, stop stop.
You can come in.
You can come in.
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything?
Would you have kept bleeding?
Would you have died?
I knew you wouldn't let me.
We had broken up for good just an hour before
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh...
You can borrow one of my mom's old dresses if you want.
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
We'd been living together for a million years
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh...
Hello?
Owen.
I'm in here.
I'll be right there.
Los Alamos weather at 6:20 AM.
Calm and cold this morning with temperatures around 24°, then picking up this afternoon bringing snow flurries.
We're expecting 6-12" of snow in the next 24 hours...
"Hi Owen. Good morning.
I am in the bathroom.
Please do not come in.
Want to hang out with me again tonight?
I really like you.
Love, Abby."
Hello?
Police department.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Police officer!
No no, stop!
Jesus.
Owen, I have to go away.
Ah, speak of the devil.
There he is.
Hi.
Today we start in pool, okay?
Okay.
Hey Owen.
Oh, hi.
He's here.
Come on, hurry up.
Just like we did before, kick, then in water- one-two-three breathe, one-two-three breathe.
Kick kick. Good.
One-two-three breathe.
Yes.
One-two-three breathe.
Mr. Zoric, there's a fire.
- What?
- Out back.
Owen, I'll be right back.
- Where?
- At the dumpsters.
Everybody out of the pool.
Move. Come on, get out.
Out.
I said everybody get out.
- Get out of the pool.
- Owen!
Owen!
Owen!
What are you gonna do with that?
No no no no.
Stop!
No no. No! Help!
Stop! Guys, stop!
No. Stop. Stop.
Stop! Stop!
Oh! Somebody! Ow!
Stop!
Grab his arms.
Get his arms.
No no, stop it.
We're gonna have a little contest, okay?
You stay underwater for... three minutes.
If you can do it,
I'll just give you a little nick- on your cheek.
But if you can't,
I'm gonna poke out one of your eyes.
Got it?
An eye for an ear.
Three minutes.
You'd better take a deep breath.
- Okay, Jimmy.
- Shut up.
- Dude, come on.
- I said shut up!
What the f-?
What the fuck is this? Argh!
Oh my God, Jimmy! Jimmy!
Oh my God, oh my God.
No no no no!
No no.
Excuse me, can I see your ticket?
Is that trunk yours?
hi
hug and kiss
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later.
I
Hey!

Fuck.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Okay. What was it?
What's the number? What's the number?
FUCK!
Where is it?
- 911. Please hold.
- No! Wait! Please!
- Yes. 911.
- Hello. I'm buried.
You have to help me.
You have to help me. I can't breathe.
- Sir?
- I'm buried in a coffin. Please, help.
- Send someone to find me.
- Sin slow down.
- What is your name?
- Paul. Paul Conroy.
Okay, Mn Conroy.
Can you tell me your location?
I don't know. I'm in a coffin.
I don't know where.
Please, help. I'm scared.
- You’re in a coffin?
- Yes.
It's like one of those old, wooden ones.
- Are you at a funeral home?
- No. No. No.
I don't know. No.
How are you calling me right now?
What?
If you’re buried in a coffin, where are you calling me from?
From a cell phone.
There was an old cell phone in the coffin.
- You're calling me from your cell phone?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes. No, no.
It's not my cell phone, but, yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.
There was a cell phone in the coffin when you climbed in?
Yes. What?
- I didn’t climb in, though.
- How did you end up in the coffin, sir?
- I was put here.
- In the coffin?
Yes. Please, help.
- And you’re saying the coffin is buried?
- Yes. Yeah.
I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American.
It's hot in here, and I can't breathe.
- Please.
- Do you know your location, sir?
- I told you, somewhere in Iraq. Please, help.
- Iraq?
Yes. I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American. I work for CRT.
- Are you a soldier; sir?
- No, please, you have to listen to me.
I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American.
I’m a civilian contractor working in Iraq.
We were attacked in Baqubah.
And they... They shot all of them.
- They shot who, sir?
- All of the other drivers.
And you are saying this happened in Iraq?
The country?
Yeah. Please, listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.
They gave me a safety number and it was in my wallet, and I don't know where it is now.
Mn Conroy this is 911 emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.
- Ohio?
- Yes, sir.
I'm not sure exactly how you called here if you're in another country but if you'd like,
I can patch you through to the sheriff's department.
You don't understand. Forget it.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Pick up.
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!
Yeah, Linda. Linda, honey, it's me.
I need you... I need you... I need you to contact the National Guard right away, or the Pentagon.
Tell them that we were attacked in the Diyala province, in Baqubah.
They need to find me. Okay?
Please, baby, you've got to help them find me.
- Hi, this is Linda.
- No!
Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.
Linda! Linda,
I need you to call me right away, okay?
Call me at this number.
It's an absolute emergency.
Call me at the number that comes up on your screen right away. Okay?
I don't know what the hell is going on, but...
...I'm buried in a box.
I'm buried in a box.
I can't breathe in here.
Call me whenever you can.
Please, baby.
What city and state, please?
I don't know. The FBI, wherever they are.
Do you have a specific city you’d like to be connected to?
Anywhere. Any city.
Just connect me to the FBI.
Sir; I have FBI Held of Hoes listed in Boston,
Chicago, New York, Philadelphia...
- It doesn't matter.
- New Haven...
Any city, anywhere.
Just connect me, please.
I'm sorry, sir; but i'm not allowed to do that.

Yeah.
Okay Paul, explain to me what's going on.
All right, all right. Okay.
All right, me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering some kitchen supplies to a community center.
And then some kids, they started throwing rocks at the trucks.
And then, an IED went off up ahead and it blew up one of the other trucks.
And then these guys, they came out from behind the houses and they started shooting everyone right there on the street.
- Were you shot at?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I was way in the back of the convoy.
I guess I got hit in the head by one of the other...
By one of the rocks and I blacked out, and that's the last thing that I remember.
And then I woke up here, tied up, in a coffin.
- Who put you there?
- I guess whoever ambushed us.
- A bunch of kids?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
Some kids, the kids, they threw the rocks at us.
These guys, some Iraqis, some insurgents.
I don't fucking know.
They just... They popped out and they started shooting everybody...
- right there on the street.
- I thought you said they didn't shoot at you.
They didn't! I don't know.
They shot them!
Sin you're gonna have to stop shouting.
I'm shouting because you're not listening to me!
I need you to help me!
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.
Can you trace the call?

Why is it that they didn't shoot you?
I don't know. I have no idea.

I've got a problem.
I've been held hostage by a group of guys that...
Fooled you. I'm not really home.
But if you leave a message, i'll get back to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye.
Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
It's an absolute emergency.
Have her call me. Use star 69 to find out the number of this phone and have her call me at this number, okay?
- Paul?
- Donna.
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?
I don't know. I haven 't talked to her all day.
Call her cell. ..
- Are you at your computer right now?
- Yeah. Why?
Okay, I need you to look up a number for me to the State Department.
Paul, I was just heading out to the supermarket. I really...
Please, please, please.
Just look up the number for me.
- Ls everything all right?
- No! Everything is not all right!
- Just look up the number for me.
- Don 't fucking yell at me...
- I'm not yelling at you, Donna.
- Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
Just get me the fucking number!
Get me the number!
Get me the fucking number!
FUCK!
You stupid fucking cunt!
FUCK!
Fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- What?
- Donna, I'm very sorry that I yelled at you.
I shouldn't have done that.
But I'm only going to ask you one more time to get me this number, and if you don't, I'm gonna die.
- What?
- Please, I don't have time to explain.
- The number.
- Okay, hold on.
- Okay. State Department.
- Yeah.
- It’s 202...
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fuck you.
United States Department of State.
I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq.
I've been taken hostage.
- I need to speak to someone right away.
- Where are you calling from, sir?
From Iraq. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT.
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My convoy was attacked and I'm being held for ransom.
- Are the kidnappers with you?
- No. I'm buried somewhere.
- You're buried?
- Yeah. Yeah, in a coffin.
It's a wooden box, an old wooden coffin.
Did you try contacting the military out there?
They gave me a number to call, a safety number.
- But the people took it.
- The people holding you hostage?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know.
- Hold on. Let me connect you...
- No, don't put me on hold! No!
- Rebecca Browning.
- Hello?
Yes, hello.
I was just informed of your situation.
Yeah, my situation.
I'm running out of time and you guys keep putting me on hold.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. Just help me.
I just have a few questions for you,
Mn Conroy.
- You've got to be kidding me.
- It's important that I get this information.
- It’ll help make a rescue attempt...
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
- How do you know my name?
- I'm sorry?
My name, I didn't give it to you.
I didn't give it to the other guy either.
What's going on right now?
We received a call from a representative at CRT. You left him a message?
- Yeah?
- He contacted us right away.
So if you know what the hell is going on, then what have you done to get me out of here?
Well, there 's little we can do from Washington.
So that's it?
I'm just supposed to sit here and rot because there's little you can do?
- No.
- Then what?
I need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed.
- In Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
- Okay.
And has contact been made with the kidnappers?
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million by 9:00 tonight.
Okay or else...
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.
- What the hell do you think, lady?
- We'll do everything we can.
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?
- No. That we can't do.
- Wait, wait. Why?
It’s the policy of the United States government to not negotiate with terrorists.
Not the policy of the
United States government?
Lady, come on!
You're sitting in an air conditioned office, this is easy for you to say.
You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the goddamn desert!
- I understand your frustration...
- Frustration?
Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here.
Understand that?
- Hello?
- I'm here.
Then say something.
Tell me how you can get me out of here.
Okay.
What's the number on the phone that you're calling from?
- I don't Know. Did it come up on your end?
- No. It's listed as unavailable.
Tell me this, can you remember a number?
Yeah. No. I have a... I have a pencil.
- Okay write this down.
- Okay, just a sec.
Okay. Go ahead.
- Yeah.
- Who's that?
- That's Dan Brenner
He's the commander of the hostage working group over in Iraq.
Hostage working group?
Formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours.
Situations.
I love how you keep calling it that.
- Did you write down the number?
- Yeah.
Good. Now, just hold on,
I 'll connect you with him now.
- He should be expecting you.
- What about the news? I wanna call them.
No, don't call the news.
- I repeat, do not contact the news.
- Why?
- It will only complicate things further..
- That's bullshit.
- You're just covering your own ass.
- No, I'm covering yours.
You don't go looking for something you don't know is missing.
Everyone who needs to know about this does.
- I need all the help I can get.
- We are running out of time, Paul.
That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away.
Fine.
I'm transferring you now.
- Brenner
- Dan Brenner?
- Ls this Paul Conroy?
- Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.
I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there.
Thank you, God.
I was told that we have until 9:00 p.m. ls that right?
- That's what he said.
- All right.
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.
And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground?
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.
Okay my guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal,
- you're no more than a few feet underground.
- Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.
What about battery life?
How much does the phone have left?
- It's just less than half.
- Okay you have to conserve that battery.
Our best bet of finding you by tracking your cell signal.
- Ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
- Vibrate.
I need you to press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone.
It will use less power
- What about my Zippo?
- You have a lighter?
- Yeah.
- Use it to look around for markings, logo, whatever you can find.
- Won’t it use up oxygen?
Don 't worry about that now.
Just try to find...
- It's just so dark in here without it.
- I understand, Paul.
Try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made.
- You guys have to hurry.
- We're working as fast as we can, Paul.
Do you Know if there were any other survivors?
- From your convoy?
- Yeah.
Still unclear at this point.
I just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.
I didn't know it was going to be like this out here.
I don't think any of us did.
- That's him. He's calling.
- The kidnapper?
- Yeah. What should I do?
- You know his number?
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.
- Okay. What about the call?
- Give me the number first.
- He's going to hang up.
- Take the call.
- I... Okay.
- That's okay, just take the call.
Hello! Hello.
Two hour; four minute.
- You have to give me more time.
- You talk to embassy?
- Give the money?
- Yeah, yeah. I talked to someone.
The government.
They said that they won't pay the money.
- No pay?
- No.
They said they don't negotiate with terrorists.
Terrorists? I am terrorist?
Yeah.
Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.
You terrified, so I am terrorist?
What did I ever do to you?
- Ever do?
- Yeah.
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job, to make money.
- That's it.
- I have job until you come.
- Now my family have nothing.
- That's not my fault!
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here.
Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.
I told you, I'm only here to work.
To help rebuild.
Rebuild what you destroyed.
Stop! Stop! Just please, stop!
I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?
I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything.
I just want to go home.
Hello?
- You make video. Ransom video.
- Yeah, yeah!
I'll make a video.
If you let me go, I'll make a video.
No. You make video now.
- What? How?
- Use video on phone.
Near foot. You read note near foot in box.
- I don't see it.
- Near foot.
- Read note inside box.
- Okay, okay.
- If I make the video, you let me go?
- Only if we get money.
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.
We take less. One million, money.
If they pay, you'll let me go?
One million, money.
OW!
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!
We’re sorry, your call cannot be completed. Please, dial again.
Shit.
- Paul?
- Here's his number.
- Hold on. All right, go ahead.
- Okay. Hold on.
It's 07-902-24-921.
Okay. This is huge, Paul.
Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes.
Okay. What about me?
Can you track my cell signal?
We 're having a lot of trouble with yours.
Seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers.
What does that mean?
- That it's just not going to be easy.
- He wants me to make a ransom video.
No. Hold off for as long as you can.
If it gets me out of here, I'm making it.
The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.
- We'?
- Yes.
This can't turn into an international incident.
That's all you people care about, isn't it?
Don't you care about me?
- We do.
- What about me?
We do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.
No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.
You don't care about any of us.
I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today.
- Listen, Paul. You just...
- We don't have any guns, any armor.
- Nothing.
- That's because you're not soldiers.
Tell that to the people who put me in this box!
- Paul, listen.
- Tell that to the people who shot my friends!
- We're doing the best we can.
- No, you're not! You're not!
- Okay, calm down.
- I've been out here nine months.
I know how it works. All you guys care about is your secret plans and your back-room politics.
You know, if I was a diplomat, or a hostage working group leader, or what the fuck your title is,
I'd be out of here by now.
But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to sit in here, shut my mouth and die.
Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.
Fuck you, Dan.
Paul, listen to me.
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line. And we 're searching for you just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise.
I can't... I can't...
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?
I don't know. Who are they?
The people who put me in here, who are they?
They're just that, people.
No different from you and me.
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Neither are they.
How do you know?
If you were homeless, starving...
Actually I take that back.
If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them?
- I wouldn't kill somebody.
- How can you be sure?
What difference does it make?
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.
They don't care about anything other than getting the money.
So pay them, just pay them.
Trust me, if it was an option,
I would do that in a heartbeat.
How many others have there been?
- Since I got here?
- Yeah.
Dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.
Dozens have been taken. It's one of the only functioning businesses out here.
How many have you rescued?
- How many?
- Not many.
- Tell me their names.
- No.
- Any of them.
- Who?
Make me believe that they really do matter to you.
That they really do matter to you.
- Mark White.
- Who was Mark White?
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.
Came over here to help out local doctors.
What happened to him?
- Insurgents grabbed him.
- When?
About three weeks ago.
You remember his name?
I remember all their names.
Is he... Did he?
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.
- Where is he now?
- Home.
Probably happy to be back at school.
I want to get out of here.
We found him. We’ll find you, too.
How?
We already have a solid lead on the number you gave us.
- You do?
- Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.
That's good.
- That feels good.
- Yeah.
What... What should I do in the meantime?
I know it's hard, but try to relax.
The more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use.
Okay, I know.
I know. It's hard, 'cause I have anxiety.
I take pills for it.
- Do you have them with you?
- Yeah.
Good. Take them.
You need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can.
Okay.
- Ls your Zippo still lit?
- No, not anymore.
- All right. Good.
- I feel nauseous.
- You have to calm down.
- Okay.
And you need to save that battery.
We 're expecting some intel in about 10 minutes.
- Call me back then.
- Okay.
- Just hang in there, Paul.
- I'm trying, okay.
- What?
- You make video?
- No.
- You make video!
- Let me out and I'll make it.
- No!
- You make video now.
- I can't read the paper.
- Make video now!
- I can't.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I can't read the paper.
You make video! Now!
I Fuck!
I
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Fuck.
Shit.

And I have been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq.
I need $1 million by 9:00 tonight,
Baghdad time, or I'll be left to die here in this coffin that I'm buried in.
I'm told that if the money is paid...
I'm told that if the money is paid,

My name is Pamela Lutti.
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.
Please. Please, don’t!
My name is Pamela Lutti.
Please, don’t!
If you’re buried in a coffin, where are you calling from?
The number you requested,
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.
They don't care about anything other than getting...
At CRT, we work with our clients to provide...
Sin you're gonna have to stop shouting.
I
Five million, money tonight, 9:00 p.m., or you stay.
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line.
I
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please, leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!
Why the hell did you make that video?
- It's all a bunch of lies.
- What is?
What are you talking about?
- All Of it.
- All Of What?
You don't give a shit about any of us.
We're nothing to you people.
We’re going to find you.I
Fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.
Just gonna stay on the phone with me until I die.
Okay.
You can’t start breaking on me now, Paul.
- You have to stay strong.
- They shot her and you didn't do anything.
We didn't even know she'd been taken hostage.
- She sent three videos.
- Yeah. That's what they told her to say.
- Why?
- I don't know.
What do you know?
That your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.
And all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera.
So now your captors have no choice but to follow through.
I found out the number to this phone.
- How?
- Who cares?
I figured it out and you didn’t. Why?
Because I didn't.
Just like you and every other person on the planet, there are some things I know, and there are some things I don't.
Then how am I ever gonna get out of here?
Their signal was cloned, like we figured.
But we're close. Really close.
I'm near a mosque.
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.
Good. Good.
That means that we're in the right area.
You're...
You're nearby?
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID who were escorting your convoy.
They're alive?
Not all of them.
Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.
The rest got caught in small arms fire
What the hell happened out there, Paul?
Paul?
Wait.
Paul?
I
I
FUCK!
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello, who's there?
- Ls this Paul Conroy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Paul. Who are you?
Paul, my name 's Alan Davenport.
I'm the Personnel Director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.
You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department.
Are you able to speak on the status of your situation?
It's worse. There was an explosion or something, and the sand's coming through.
I probably have about half an hour before it fills right up.
Slow down. You should try to stay calm.
0 CD 0 CD 0.
Q)
The hostage-takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group...
Okay, Paul. I'm with you.
Now, how about the media?
I know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on?
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Good, good, good, good.
It needs to stay that way.
It's important we keep this situation as contained as possible.
The situation is in a coffin!
I think it's pretty contained!
Help me! Help me!
What are you doing right now to help me?
I know you're upset.
But from what I've been told, they're extremely close to getting you out of there.
So hopefully it won't be too much longer
- Thank God.
- Yeah, thank God.
Now, I'm going to switch on a recorder right now.
- What?
- Just a second.
This is Alan Davenport,
Personnel Director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas Incorporated.
The date is October 23, 2006.
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.
Mr Conroy are you aware that I'm recording this conversation?
- What?
- Please answer the question.
- Shit.
- Mn Conroy?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And do I have your permission to do so?
Why do you need my permission?
What's this about?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
- Yes! Yes, all right?
- Thank you.
Now, Mr Conroy, when were you hired by CRT?
I don't... Nine months ago.
Around January. What is all this?
I have your official date of hire as January 4th.
- Ls that correct?
- Who cares?
This is fucking crazy.
- January 4th. Ls that correct?
- Yes!
And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, you were made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired.
You mean when I came down there to Dallas, and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass?
You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here?
Is that when...
Is that when I was made aware?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
Yes.
During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I signed a bunch of things. Yeah.
- Yes or no?
- Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.
It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct?
Yes! I think that’s a fair assessment of the situation, you fucking dick.
What's the point of all this?
Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company.
As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
It was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee,
Pamela Lutti.
- No. No, no. Hold on, hold on.
- Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly
- that any relationship...
- Stop, stop, stop. Please.
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...
- We were just friends.
- ...deemed inappropriate
By CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.
Hold on. Okay?
We were just friends. We were just friends.
- Our records indicate differently.
- Your records are wrong.
We 're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of CRT at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination.
Therefore, in your case, that includes this incident, or any consequences that may result from it.
What about my insurance money?
My family's gonna need that money.
Given that you were alive up until the time of your termination...
Don't do this.
- Do you understand everything?
- Don't do this!
Do you understand everything you've been told, Mn Conroy?
Mn Conroy?
You're a piece of shit.
That concludes our interview with Paul Conroy.
I am now turning off the recorder
You put me here.
I'm sorry.
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.
Come on. Why won't you answer the phone?
Paul, is that you?
They're dead.
- How do you know that?
- I just do.
Three F-16s leveled parts of the city a few minutes ago.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, that was fun for me.
Did they know I was here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Did they care?
These people that took me, if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am.
We can still try to track down your signal.
You tried that already.
We can try again.
- It's over, isn't it?
- No.
Yeah.
What should I do?
I don't know.
It's weird.
What is?
Knowing.
I wish this could have gone differently Paul.
Yeah.
Me, too.
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.
Social security number, 048-32-1198.
Date of birth. 3/23/76.
This video will serve as my last will and testament.
Um...
To my wife, Linda Conroy,
I leave you the $700 in my personal savings, and whatever's left in my annuity.
To my son, Shane Conroy,
I don’t know
I don't have... My clothes.
I leave you my clothes, which you will grow into.
Not these ones.
I don't really have...
I wish that I had more for you, but...
Maybe if I was a famous baseball player, or some guy who wore a suit to work...
Then I'd have more.
But, you know, you can be one of those people if you want. Um...
Yeah. Yeah.
Just promise me that when you get older that you'll take good care of your mom.
And, I don't know.
You always try to do the right thing.
I love you very much, Shane.
Maybe I never said that enough. Maybe I did.
I don't know.
That probably means I didn't. And...
I'm sorry, Linda.
I should have listened to you.
You're not dead. Hello? Hello?
Where is money?
- I don't know.
- What don't know?
- I don’t know where it is.
- Liar!
No, I'm not lying! I swear.
- Swear?
- Yeah, I swear.
- I'm telling the truth.
- From embassy.
- No.
- You get money now!
- I can't!
- You will!
- I need more time. Please.
- No more time!
There's sand pouring in here.
It's everywhere. Let me out of here, and I promise you I will get you the money.
- You show blood.
- What?
- You show blood, they give money.
- No.
You cut finger; send video.
- No, I'm not doing that.
- Yes!
- No.
- No?
No, that's right, no. You let me out of here, and I'll out off my whole goddamn hand if you want.
- You have wife?
- Yeah, I do.
And a son. I have a young son.
And I want to see them again. Please, sir.
- Sir?
- Yes. Sir.
I say that out of respect to you.
243, North Walnut Street.
Hastings, Michigan, USA.
That's my... Why did you say that?
You show blood, or they show blood.
No. You're nobody, all of you.
You can't get to them.
- No?
- No.
You're peasants.
You're fucking criminals, that's all.
You don't even know where Michigan is.
Detroit. Ann Arbor
You looked at a map.
You looked at a map.
You show blood, or they show blood.
Send video by five minutes.
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.
Linda! Linda, listen to me, you and Shane have to go somewhere, okay?
Do not go back to the house.
Do not go back to the house.
Just go anywhere but to the house.
Okay? These guys, they know where we live.
They have my driver's license.
Just go to the sheriff's station if you have to, just do not go home.
Holy God.
Fuck.
Fuck.
This is Daniel Brenner
Please leave a message at the tone.
Brenner, where are you?
The guy's still alive!
He just called me. He's still alive.
Fuck.
They can't find them. They can't.
There's no way. No, no, no, no, no.
They can't find them. They can't find them.
They can't find them.
Fuck.
My name is Pamela Lutti.
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.
Please. Please, don’t!
Fuck.
I
- Around to the other side!
- Move it, move it, move it!
MAN 1. I see him! Move it!I
Get back! Everybody, get back!
Civilian has been located. Civilian has been located.
Are you okay? Talk to me.
Paul, are you okay?
Yeah?
Paul? Paul, it’s Brenner.
- Are you there, Paul?
- I'm here?
We 're coming for you now.
You hear me? We know where you are.
- You're coming?
- We are, Paul.
- We 're almost there now.
- How do you know?
Coalition forces picked up a Shi'ite insurgent just outside of Baghdad.
Said he knew where an American was buried alive.
He agreed to show us where if we let him go.
- You're coming for me?
- We are practically there already.
- You have... You have to hurry.
- We are, Paul.
You have to hurry. The sand... The sand...
You just hang in there three more minutes.
This will all be over soon, I promise, Paul.
Okay. Okay. I believe you.
Three minutes, Paul.
I just need you to hang on for three minutes.
- Thank you.
- This will all be over soon. I promise you...
- I have to go! Call me right back.
- No, no, no! Paul, Paul, Paul!
- Call me right back. Please!
- No, wait, Paul!
Linda! Linda!
Paul? Paul, is that you?
- Tell me it's you.
- It's me.
Oh, my God, Paul!
What are they doing to you?
- Please tell me you're okay.
- I'm okay.
I just saw the news.
I left my cell phone at home.
They know where I am.
They're coming to get me.
The Americans are coming for me.
- They are?
- It's going to be okay.
Thank God. Thank God.
They're coming. They're on their way.
It's gonna be okay.
I was so afraid I was going to lose you.
- You're not.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
I love you so much. I'm so sorry.
I should never have come here.
I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.
Sweetie, I don't care. I just want you home.
Please come home to me.
I'm coming home. I'm coming home.
- Swear it.
- I swear.
- I swear I'm coming home.
- I love you. I love you so much.
I know.
- They're here.
- Okay.
They're here! I have to go.
- Call me right away.
- I will. I promise you
- I will. I love you.
- I love you. Swear it.
- I love you so much.
- Swear it again.
I swear! I have to go.
- Please come home to me.
- I love you.
- Dan?
- Move! Move! Let's go!
- Brenner?
- Okay Paul? Paul? We're here!
- It's me.
- He brought us right to you.
Hurry, hurry. You have to hurry.
It's almost full. Please.
Paul, just hang in there.
We're right above you.
I can’t. I can’t. Are you close?
- We 're almost there!
- Are you close?
We 're almost there! Right above!
- Please! Please! I can't hear you!
- Keep digging!
- I can't hear you! Where are you?
- We 're almost there!
- Keep digging! We see the coffin.
- Yeah, dig in...
- Hang in there!
- Please open it. Please open it.
Let’s go! Move! Faster guys, faster!
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- Okay, okay, clear!
Fucking hurry! Please!
Hurry!
Oh, my God.
- What? What?
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry Paul. I'm so sorry.
- What is... What?
It's Mark White.
He brought us to Mark White.
Oh, God. Oh, God
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Okay.
Okay. Oh, God.
I'm sorry Paul. I'm so sorry.

WOMAN: The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today.
MAN 1: You see it in the market's volatility.
Violent wealth loss.
If it's bad for the rich people, can you imagine how bad it is for me and you?
KNlGHT:
Good evening, America, I'm Jay Knight.
Our nation is slipping deeper and deeper into a crisis never seen before.
Oil and gas shortages have crippled manufacturing and transportation costs....
MAN 1:
While conflicts in the Mideast...
...have virtually cut off all oil imports to the United States.
[TRAIN HORN HONKlNG]
MAN 2:
Well, what are you saying?
Are you saying that the American people aren't taking care of their own country?
MAN 3:
Global States Oil Corporation...
...suffered yet another major spill off the Gulf Coast.
MAN 4:
We're seeing an unprecedented....
MAN 3: As a result, rail travel has reemerged as the only affordable means of freight...
...and passenger transportation.
MAN 5: Mr. Speaker, we would like to propose a bill...
...to make it illegal to fire employees from profitable corporations.
KNlGHT: Our government has put a moratorium on all wage increases...
...and recently passed the Fair Price Bill...
...restricting increases in the price of most goods and services.
This is your wake-up call, America.
MAN 6: Another government relief ship was hijacked...
...by pirate Ragnar Danneskjold.
WOMAN 2: Violence and crime are skyrocketing throughout the nation.
Shifting to manual.
[SCREAMlNG]
KNlGHT: Good evening, and welcome to The Jay Knight Hour.
My guests tonight are James Taggart,
CEO of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad...
...Wesley Mouch, a noted Washington lobbyist...
...from the Philadelphia law firm
Young, Stephens and Sachs...
...and Ellis Wyatt, the oil and gas entrepreneur...
...who is responsible for the current economic boom in Colorado.
My first question is to Mr. Taggart.
Sir, your company is one of the few managing to survive...
...in our current economic downturn.
Yet, there have been dozens of derailments on your lines in the last year alone.
How do you explain that?
TAGGART: With any growth there can be growing pains.
People shouldn't have to worry about how they're gonna get where they need to go.
We must act to benefit society as a whole.
WYATT: People aren't gonna be going anywhere without oil.
That means the railroads like Mr. Taggart's need to be fixing their railways here....
JOY: Can l get you something?
MAN: A cup of coffee.
KNlGHT:
He makes a very good point, Mr. Taggart.
Do you have any money?
I got plenty of money.
Taggart Transcontinental is committed to sharing the burden....
JOY:
Hey, what happened to you?
Who's John Galt?
WYATT: We don't need more rail lines.
We just need the ones we have to be reliable.
Let me ask you, what can the government do to help turn things around?
Well, prices are too high.
We have a nation in crisis.
Every business must lend a helping hand,
Mr. Wyatt.
Gasoline prices are 37.50 a gallon.
The Mideast has imploded, creating a worldwide oil shortage.
WYATT: We have plenty of oil right here in the U.S.
Hello, Joy.
WYATT: But because of political shenanigans and back room deals....
One slice of cherry pie. As usual.
MlDAS:
Punctual, as always. Thank you, dear.
And Taggart Transcontinental is providing
Wyatt Oil excellent rail transportation...
...in order to get his oil to the people.
WYATT:
Your Rio Norte Line is so incompetent...
...that I've had to switch to the Phoenix/Durango.
After years of excellent service from us.
WYATT: From your father.
Since you've taken the reins, that company's gone downhill.
Oil prices have caused consumers to be less reliant on trucks--
Stay dry now.
JOY: See you tomorrow, Mr. Mulligan.
MOUCH: They've gone to the railroads for the benefits that they provide.
WYATT: People can't count on companies like Taggart Transcontinental to deliver.
MAN:
Midas Mulligan?
Who's asking?
Someone who knows what it's like to work for himself...
...and not let others feed off the profits of his energy.
That's funny.
Exactly what l've been thinking.
We're alike, you and I.
Who are you?
[RlNGlNG]
Eddie.
What? No. Uh--
Hold on. Hold on.
MAN 1 [ON TV]: The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today.
This is the deepest one-day drop....
No, not yet. l'm trying another channel.
GRECO [ON TV]: Simply one ofthe worst railroad accidents in recent history.
A Taggart Transcontinental freight train has crashed...
...and derailed in Colorado's Rocky Mountain region.
Early reports put much of the blame...
...on the poor condition of the 100-year-old railroad line.
This rail disaster could delay eastbound oil shipments by at least two weeks.
The accident is yet another downturn for Taggart Transcontinental...
...the largest railroad remaining in the U.S.
I'm on my way in.
TAGGART: l already know about the derailment on the Rio Norte Line, Eddie.
Cancellations.
People are giving up trying to use the line.
Their business is going to the Phoenix/Durango.
I have new steel rails coming from--
That order is 13 months old.
The Phoenix/Durango has cut deeply into our business.
They expect to have Wyatt as their main account.
He needs us just as much as we need him.
Ellis Wyatt has put Taggart
Transcontinental on notice.
He'd rather backlog with any competitor than ship anything--
Wyatt's a greedy bastard.
We've been serving the Colorado Region...
...since my great-great grandfather ran this company. What happened to loyalty?
Perhaps the problem is we haven't updated that branch...
...since your father ran the company.
Are you accusing me of not doing my job?
Careful, Eddie, it's one thing I learned from my father...
...everyone's expendable.
Let me be very clear, James.
Colorado is our last hope.
If we don't do something about it, there's not gonna be a railroad.
I'm still the president, regardless of my sister--
DAGNY:
Morning.
Eddie, can you give us a minute?
I need to have a conversation with my brother.
A meeting without your right-hand man?
Must be real important.
I've ordered the replacement rails from Rearden Steel.
I have a contract with Orren Boyle.
You had a contract with Orren Boyle.
Canceled.
You've no authority.
As much authority as you had to do a backdoor deal with Orren Boyle.
There are consequences to this accident, Jim.
We have to service Ellis Wyatt.
He is this company's main priority.
You just love to keep feeding the monopolies.
You keep pissing off the heart of this operation...
...Wyatt is gonna stop providing the blood we need to keep this company alive.
You understand that?
Why Rearden Steel?
There are companies that need the money.
It's his new metal.
That metal's completely untested.
The consensus of the best metallurgical authorities are highly skeptical.
I'm not interested in their opinions.
Then who's do you go by?
My own.
And what on earth do you know about Rearden Metal?
It is tougher, cheaper, lighter than steel...
...and will outlast any metal in existence.
Says who?
I studied engineering in college, Jim.
When I see things, l see them.
What'd you see?
Rearden's plans, research he's done.
This is the greatest metal on the market.
Dagny, nobody's used Rearden Metal.
We will.
Why do we have to be the first?
Do you wanna save Colorado or not?
I'm not taking responsibility for any of this.
You don't have to take responsibility, Jim.
I will.
Just know that this is the consequence of your policies.
Which policies?
Your 13-month experiment with Orren Boyle, for one.
The Mexican catastrophe, for another.
The bottom line is that...
...we are going to fix the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal.
I'm going to Philadelphia tonight to finalize the deal with Hank Rearden.
You're lucky.
What?
Other people are human.
They're sensitive.
They can't just dedicate their whole lives to metals and engines.
You've never had any feelings.
I don't think you've ever felt a thing.
No, Jim.
I guess I've never felt anything at all.
MAN [ON PA]:
All passengers for Train 1210.
Taggart Transcontinental....
Thanks.
[MAN SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY ON PA]
GWEN:
It's here.
And it's very nice.
Gwen, it's beautiful.
You have more messages, Mr. Rearden.
National Council of Metal lndustries.
File it.
The State Science Institute.
File it.
United Metal Workers Guild.
[CHUCKLES]
Your last appointment of the day is here.
Miss Taggart?
He'll see you now.
Mr. Rearden?
Miss Taggart.
If you're here for your rails...
...they won't be tempered and cooled for a few days.
I'm just here to discuss our deal.
Please, sit.
So, what's the premium to rush these rails?
Forty thousand dollars a ton.
That's the best price you can give me?
I could charge you double and you'd pay.
You could.
And l would.
But you won't.
Why won't l?
You need to have the Rio Norte rerailed with your new metal.
It will be its first showcase.
And l'm gambling your new metal can do what you say it can.
I'm staking my business on it.
I know what you mean.
Like l said, we need each other.
So if you can have the Rio Norte completely rerailed in nine months...
...l will give you $20,000 a ton.
Deal.
I'm curious.
Is it all right with you...
...that l'm squeezing every penny of profit
I can from your emergency?
I have to get the Rio Norte completely rerailed in nine months...
...or Taggart Transcontinental will crash.
Doing their best to make it harder for you.
Yes, but it's useless to get angry with people...
...like my brother and his friends in Washington.
I don't have time for it.
I have to undo what they've done.
And after?
After, they won't matter anyway.
I was just heading out myself.
Can l walk you to your car?
DAGNY:
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
I walk home most nights.
It gives me a chance to think.
Well, l hope that doesn't catch on.
It would put me out of business.
If your new metal works, have you thought of the implications?
Yeah. Their uses are almost endless.
Naval ships, armor plating, even spacecraft.
Can you imagine a commercial jet twice the size with half the weight?
Commercial airlines.
You really do wanna put me out of business, huh?
PHlLLlP: Remember, there was 20 people--
LlLLlAN: I love this.
I can't believe l did this.
And then--
Well, look who's finally home.
Henry,
Paul's been waiting here for hours.
Hello, Henry.
HENRY: Hey, Paul.
I know. I'm late.
Could have called.
Henry, do you mind holding the 10th of December open for me?
That's three months away.
I don't know what l'm doing next week.
We started a major new pour today.
Oh, cheers.
It's our wedding anniversary, Henry.
December 10th?
Henry isn't interested in anything that doesn't tie in to his work.
I know that you are very busy...
...but l would very much like for you to be there.
Of course, Lillian. I'll be there.
Thank you, dear.
I want it to be special.
Everyone will be there.
REARDEN:
Have you had any dinner, Henry?
No, I was busy working, but I'm not hungry anyway.
That's the trouble with you.
You work too hard.
Mm.
Ooh. What is this?
I had it made from the first pour of Rearden Metal.
You're giving me a railroad spike?
It's wonderful. It is.
It's original.
I'll be the toast of the town wearing a piece of the same metal...
...used to build railroads and bridges and sewer pipes and oil tanks and--
You are so selfish, Henry.
Oh. Phillip, it is not the gift, it's the intention.
The intention's pure selfishness, it seems to me.
I mean, another man would have given his wife a diamond bracelet...
...if he wanted to give her a gift for her pleasure, not his.
No. The, uh, chain is appropriate.
I think it's the chain by which he holds us all in bondage.
Henry's poured his metal today and l have the first trophy.
It's sweet.
It's pathetic, Lilly.
Thank you.
LlLLlAN: I hope you didn't come here for anything.
Henry.
Phillip.
What are you doing with yourself these days?
I'm working for Friends of Global Awareness.
I know them.
What do you want?
Money.
Doesn't everyone?
Call my office first thing in the morning.
I'll authorize a hundred grand for you.
You don't care about helping the underprivileged.
No, Phillip, I don't, but it will make you happy.
It's not for me, Hank.
It's for the benefit of the less privileged.
Do you think I can have the money wired to my account?
A wire? Why?
Well, the thing is it's a progressive group.
They wouldn't appreciate your name on a check.
You're kidding me.
No, it would embarrass us to have you on the list of our contributors.
LARKIN: You shouldn't have given Phillip that money.
By the way,
I don't care what the industry says, Henry.
Rearden Metal, it's terrific.
I just hope you don't run into any trouble.
What trouble?
Well, you're not very popular, Hank.
I haven't had any complaints from my customers.
Yeah? That's not what l mean.
You know what you should do?
You ought to get yourself a good press agent to sell you to the public.
It's my metal l'm selling. Not me.
Thank you.
But you don't want the public against you.
Public opinion, you know, can mean a lot.
As far as l can tell, it doesn't mean a damn thing, one way or another.
The press is against you.
They have time to waste. l don't.
Well, they say you're intractable, you're ruthless.
Your only goal is to make money.
My only goal is to make money.
Yeah, but you shouldn't say it.
Hank, l'm on your side.
How's your man in Washington?
Wesley Mouch?
Well, he's fine, l suppose.
Good.
It's important that your man in Washington is fine.
What are you trying to imply, Paul?
Is there something going on that I should know about?
No. It's nothing.
It's just you don't know who's loyal these days.
What is wrong with the world, Paul?
Why ask useless questions?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
Who is John Galt?
Henry Rearden claims that his steel is lighter than even the cheapest brands...
...but it's 10 times stronger, this is physically impossible, Jim.
You're inviting disaster if you use it.
Dagny is, not me.
Well, something has to be done.
Agreed.
I believe you know Wesley Mouch,
Rearden's man in Washington.
You know what l like about you, Wesley?
You're a one-word man.
True.
BOYLE: All right, something has got to be done about the iron ore shortage.
It threatens the very existence of the steel industry.
I don't think it's fair that one company has its own supply.
Rearden Steel.
BOYLE: Exactly.
It's not in the public interest to let one man destroy an entire industry.
If we're gonna bring Rearden down we should do it from the inside.
MOUCH:
Under my guidance, of course.
The National Council of Metal lndustries has completed a report...
...that draws public opinion against Rearden Metal.
Excuse me, I just wanna make sure that Hank doesn't get hurt.
Paul, it's his own fault.
He's not exactly open to competition.
A monopoly. To be exact.
BOYLE:
We are working on a bill.
It's called
The Equalization of Opportunity.
It proposes to limit the number of businesses...
...that any one person owns to one business.
However, we're gonna need your help, Jimmy.
We need you to grease the palms of your politicians...
...in order to get legislation we're spearheading passed.
What will Taggart Transcontinental get in return?
I can see to it that the exclusive grip...
...that Dan Conway's Phoenix/Durango railroad has in Colorado...
...can come to a halt.
Paul, this is not personal.
MOUCH: Everybody needs to share the burdens we face.
Especially Rearden.
[GROUP LAUGHING]
MOUCH: lsn't that Francisco D'Anconia?
BOYLE: That's him.
Francisco.
BOYLE: Throwing away his daddy's money.
Did you get in on that ore mine deal in Mexico?
We all did.
He may be a slacker, but he makes business investments that pay off.
Well, that's it for me, gentlemen.
I have to go too.
Um, Mr. Taggart. Orren.
Uh, Paul, uh, maybe you'd like a lift in my limo?
Of course. Thank you.
Please. This way.
Gentlemen.
TAGGART: Good night, Paul.
MOUCH: Orren.
Wesley.
Jim? What is it?
Well, if he's such a great businessman...
...then why hasn't a single train filled with ore left Mexico yet?
Isn't that what we invested in?
BOYLE: D'Anconia has invested billions developing their infrastructure.
But he also bought in himself.
He must know something.
TAGGART: What are you thinking?
BOYLE: I think it's the ore reserves.
I think they must be huge.
Well, the success of my Mexican expansion depends on those mines, Orren.
Uh, sure.
This time next year,
Phoenix/Durango needs to be a memory.
Thank you, Mr. McNamara.
I look forward to working with you as well.
McNAMARA: Frankly,
I appreciate working directly with you.
DAGNY: My pleasure. Goodbye.
McNAMARA: Goodbye.
Who was that?
I found an excellent contractor to takeover the rebuilding of the Rio Norte Line.
That was quick.
You'd be surprised how quickly things get done when you do some actual work...
...and don't rely on political favors.
Is this accurate? Just one passenger train per day on the Mexican line?
And one freight every other night?
Yes.
How are the Mexicans gonna develop the area...
...with a single passenger train once a day?
They're not, Jim.
You should know I moved everything of value out of Mexico a month ago.
There's nothing for looters once the Mexicans nationalize.
That Mexican line was helping those destitute people get back in the game.
And it was great PR for this company.
I would have happily put a railroad in Mexico...
...if there was a reason to build up the region...
...but l didn't see one.
You can't just take everything away from people who need our help.
Move.
Okay.
Miss Taggart?
Oh. Hello, Owen, please, have a seat.
OWEN:
Thank you.
Um....
I've have come to give you my resignation.
Effective immediately.
Why?
For a personal reason.
Are you dissatisfied here?
No.
Have you received a better offer?
No.
I'm sorry, I don't understand, are you ill?
No.
Are you leaving the city?
No.
But you no longer wish to work for Taggart Transcontinental?
Miss Taggart, l assure you...
...um, no person, matter or event connected to my job...
...has anything to do with my decision to leave.
I actually called you in here today to offer you a promotion.
I wanted you to manage the Rio Norte Line.
That's very kind of you, Miss Taggart...
...but, um, my decision has been made.
I'll double what any other railroad is offering.
I won't be working for any railroad.
But you will be working?
Yes, um--
Look, l came to tell you l'm leaving...
...because I promised you once that l would and l wanna keep my word.
Write your own ticket, Owen.
Name your price.
I want you to stay.
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.
So there's nothing l can offer you?
Nothing, nothing on Earth.
I'm sorry, Owen, l have to ask and l'd like the truth.
Why are you leaving?
Who is John Galt?
[SIGHS]
All done then?
Where are you going?
I have some work to do.
Fix me a drink?
Of course.
[PHONE RlNGING]
Miss Taggart?
Am l calling too late?
Not at all. What's going on?
Nothing.
Well, um...
...something.
I don't know why l thought of calling you.
HENRY [OVER PHONE]:
It's fine, Dagny.
What happened?
One of my best employees quit today.
Owen Kellogg.
I was actually grooming him for a management position...
...and he just up and left.
He couldn't even tell me why.
He just said:
"Who is John Galt?"
Why are so many great men disappearing?
It's going to be okay, Dagny.
You know, when you say that,
I actually believe it.
HENRY:
Dagny, what we're doing...
...my metal, your railway--
It's us who move the world...
...and it's us who will pull it through.
I know.
Goodnight.
Richard McNamara?
I'm McNamara.
Are you here from Taggart Transcontinental?
No, I'm not.
What are you selling, pal?
Nothing, I'm simply offering a society that cultivates individual achievement.
I know where such a place exists.
BOYLE [OVER PHONE]:
And then we do what?
We say its purpose is to prevent destructive competition between railroads.
We build public opinion...
...against encroachment on existing train routes then--
And then the National Alliance of Railroads proposes a rule.
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.
Every member must subordinate...
...his own interests for the collective needs of the industry.
But, in fact, we're squeezing
Dan Conway out of Colorado.
You are thinking like a politician, Jimmy.
WOMAN [ON TV]: Mexican authorities seized land throughout the country today.
Most affected were the San Sebastian Mines...
...where international playboy
Francisco D'Anconia...
...and other investors, including Taggart Transcontinental...
...and Associated Steel have reportedly lost billions.
The San Sebastian Line has been seized by the Mexican government.
It's been nationalized as Dagny predicted.
An emergency board meeting has been called.
TAGGART: l can assure you that there is no need for panic.
And l have full confidence that our government...
...will negotiate an equitable settlement with Mexico.
I foresaw the possibility of this type of event...
...and took every precaution to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.
Several months ago, l ordered Operations to cut the schedule...
...on the San Sebastian Line down to a single train a day...
...and to remove everything of value from Mexico.
Now, because of my actions...
...billions of company dollars have been saved.
[ALL APPLAUDlNG]
No, this is no trick.
I checked it all out, Jimmy.
D'Anconia used his own cash and now he has lost it all in those mines.
He is too smart for that.
He must have something up his sleeve.
Well, let's hope so.
What do your friends in Washington think?
They don't know anything.
Well, he knows something.
And we need to find out what it is and get in on it too.
Ruth Anne, why haven't you gotten me a meeting with D'Anconia yet?
RUTH ANNE: I wasn't able to get a meeting.
Why not?
RUTH ANNE: Senor D'Anconia says that you bore him, Mr. Taggart.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
There's something else, Dagny.
There was a call just now from the Rio Norte branch in Colorado.
Richard McNamara never showed up for work.
Well, go find him.
EDDlE:
Well, we've looked and we found a note.
DAGNY: What did it say?
It said, "Who is John Galt?"
What does that mean?
EDDlE: Was explained once.
"Don't ask questions nobody can answer."
Can you get Hank Rearden for me?
EDDIE: He actually called earlier.
He's in town and he wants to know if you're available.
And what did you say?
EDDlE:
He's meeting you at 4:30.
Thanks, Eddie.
We need to talk.
You guys carry on, I'll catch up.
You think I've ruined this company.
Do you and Orren Boyle have a plan for making up for the Mexican line's losses?
Yes, l do.
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.
Wyatt will have to use Taggart Transcontinental...
...because we will be the only railroad in town.
The Phoenix/Durango is a good line, Jim.
Conway put his lifeblood into its success.
You have to take radical steps to survive.
What does that mean?
Go see your old boyfriend, Francisco...
...find out why he screwed us out of billions of dollars?
It will never happen.
You'll never open those old wounds.
DAGNY:
Get me Dan Conway.
I'm Ellis Wyatt.
How can l help you?
WYATT: l'll make this quick.
I came here today because, well, I met your brother...
...and l was hoping someone in this business still had a brain.
If you and your brother try to undermine me...
...or go to the government like you did to destroy my best friend, Dan Conway--
Maybe you should let me explain--
Maybe you should let me finish speaking!
Okay.
EDDlE: Dagny?
Okay.
Now that you have effectively closed down the Phoenix/Durango railroad line...
...because of this new Anti Dog-Eat-Dog bullshit...
...l have no choice but to get back into business with you Taggarts again.
I had nothing to do with the creation of that bill.
I will not lower my business standards to your lousy level of incompetence.
Shall l explain what I intend to do in--
WYATT: No.
Now that l'm forced to use your railroad...
...all l want from you is dependable transportation.
You will get the transportation you need, Mr. Wyatt.
I promise you that.
We'll see.
Is everything all right, Dagny?
I don't know.
Eddie?
Yes, Dagny?
Can you get me a dinner appointment with Francisco D'Anconia?
What about Henry Rearden?
I guess I have two dinner dates then.
In the end, he's right.
If Wyatt fails, Taggart Transcontinental and everyone else around him goes down.
I have 50 miles of my new rail tempered and ready to roll.
With your new rail, l can triple my load capacity but l need more diesel engines.
I barely have enough parts to keep the ones l have working now.
Hmm. Engine parts are hard to come by these days.
I have engines l ordered two years ago and still have not received.
There was a company that made terrific engines years ago...
...uh, in Wisconsin, l think.
It closed suddenly, but they might have machine tools and parts that you can use.
I can look into it if you like.
There is so much at stake.
We have to make it.
Did you get Lillian's invitation to our anniversary party?
I did, thank you.
I can't speak for James, but I will be there.
Good.
Did you hear about Richard McNamara?
I did.
Can you imagine what will happen if this trend continues?
Who will be left to keep things running?
Your brother and his friends in Washington, people like that.
That's depressing.
I have to go.
[CLASSlCAL MUSlC PLAYING]
Ha, ha. Whoo!
That was refreshing.
If you came here in order to remind me how lovely you are...
...well done.
San Sebastian, you did it cold-bloodedly and with full intention.
Wine, please?
No.
Yes.
What is it that l did with full intention?
You knew those mines were worthless.
Why did I invest?
Can you think of a motive?
You knew they were gonna seize those mines, didn't you?
What you were after were your American stockholders.
That's part of the truth.
What is the rest of the truth?
It's for you to figure out.
MAN: And here you are, sir.
I came here because I want you to know
I'm beginning to understand your motives.
If you did, you wouldn't come.
You get a thrill from swindling people in order to watch them squirm.
They provided a spectacle on a grand scale, especially your brother.
He trusted your name and your honor.
They did, they did. l'm aware of that.
Do you find this amusing?
Not at all.
Your brother and his friends know nothing of the copper mining industry.
They consider knowledge to be superfluous.
So you did betray them intentionally?
That's for you to decide.
They rode on my brain and on the premise that I wanted to make money.
What happened to you, Francisco?
Where is the man l used to love?
You'll figure it out in time.
Just answer the question, please.
Who is John Galt?
WOMAN [ON TV]:
Plans for a rainy day, national....
Happy anniversary.
I know you're famous for skulking in corners, but be sociable tonight.
For once, please, for me.
The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is set to appear before Congress next week.
The bill, in an effort to control big business monopolies, proposes...
...to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.
Lawmakers feel the bill will help....
Wesley Mouch, please. Hank Rearden.
BRANSON: Police have no leads on the disappearance of Midas Mulligan.
He's not?
BRANSON: A banker by trade, Michael--
No, have him call me back.
BRANSON: Changed his name to Midas....
Can l have one night?
BRANSON: This week, gas prices reached a historic high.
And here you are, Mr. Rearden.
Thank you.
You're quite welcome.
[BAND PLAYlNG JAZZ MUSlC]
Oh, darling, thank you.
Where are you going?
Pardon us, Phillip.
Henry, dear...
...try to have fun.
How could I possibly have more fun than this, Lillian?
You're really a wretched liar, aren't you?
Behave.
Mother?
You look beautiful, Mother.
Hello, Lillian.
Congratulations.
Pardon me one moment.
Hello.
James Taggart.
Lillian.
A little late and a lot gorgeous.
And Dagny.
Mrs. Rearden, how are you?
I'm wonderful.
Tell me, who are you wearing?
Oh, Lennon Couture.
I have often said...
...he is someone who should come back into fashion and here you are.
That is a beautiful bracelet.
Yeah.
Well, you know, Henry had that made for me from his new metal.
He tries, poor thing.
Now, come.
There's some gentleman who wants desperately to meet you.
Here he is, as promised, James Taggart.
Hank.
Dagny.
Oh, excuse me.
To a successful business partnership.
I'll drink to that.
Glad you could make it.
Pardon me.
Honey, uh, there's someone
I want you to meet.
Excuse us.
LlLLlAN: You have to pose for photos later.
HENRY: No.
You promised.
You will do it, I own you tonight.
I'm having a magnificent time.
Good, I'm so glad.
Are you glad? Here--
Okay, what the hell is he doing here?
Well, you can't have a party without inviting Senor D'Anconia if he's around.
You keep him away from me.
I mean it.
Grow up, Henry.
Francisco.
Lillian.
Pardon me.
How are you?
You rogue.
Good to see you.
Two, please.
Did you hear? Balph Eubank is here.
Good.
He said, "Happiness is a delusion of those whose emotions are superficial."
The guy is a genius.
Who are you?
I'm Phillip Rearden.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
[CROWD CHEERING]
Thank you.
Well, congratulations on your 10th anniversary.
CROWD:
Cheers.
Hit it.
[BAND PLAYlNG JAZZ MUSlC]
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
Try the cake, Phillip.
Well, what's great about it?
Okay, Paul?
Well said.
I picked it out because
I know that you love banana...
...and l like chocolate and Mother likes the butter cream.
Mr. Rearden, allow me to introduce myself.
Your reputation precedes you,
Senor D'Anconia.
I'm not a fan.
Then l'll be brief.
I came here tonight just to meet you.
And what did you wanna meet me for?
Help me lose money?
I don't wanna sell anything to you.
Matter of fact, I didn't try to sell the mine to James Taggart either, he came to me.
You wouldn't have.
Exactly.
So, what do you want?
I want to learn to understand you.
[LAUGHlNG]
What for?
If it wasn't for you, most of these people would be left helpless.
Why are you willing to carry them?
Because they're a bunch of miserable children...
...trying to stay alive desperately and very badly.
Have you told them?
Told them what?
You're working for your sake, not theirs.
They know.
Yes, they do.
But they don't think you do.
And what do I care what they think?
Because it's a battle.
A battle in which one must make one's stand clear.
What battle? l don't fight the disarmed.
Oh, they have a weapon against you.
It's their only weapon, but it's a terrible one.
Ask yourself what it is sometime.
There's a reason you're as unhappy as you are.
What exactly is your motive here?
Let us say...
...to give you the words you need for the time when you'll need them.
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Rearden.
Good evening.
Are you having a good time, Dagny?
I am.
Good.
And l really do love that bracelet.
LlLLlAN: I would throw it into the fire if it would burn.
Perhaps, l can take it off your hands?
Are you serious? l was planning on giving it to the maid for her birthday.
Maybe the maid would like this instead.
That's enough, Lillian.
Dagny is just being kind.
LlLLlAN: For God's sake, Henry, be quiet.
Dagny and I are having a negotiation, it seems.
You were saying?
A simple trade.
That bracelet for this necklace.
And it's yours.
Sorry, Hank, I had to.
No, you didn't.
Yes, l did.
And we both know why.
It's nothing.
It's just a useless hunk of metal.
Nice try.
I had a lovely time.
That party took a lot out of me, Henry.
Don't worry.
I didn't come in here for sex.
Thank you, dear.
Why are you here?
The next time you decide to throw a party, can you stick to your own crowd?
Don't bother inviting people you think are my friends.
But, Henry, you don't have any friends.
WOMAN 1 [ON TV]:
And in Colorado this morning...
...work commenced to replace
100-year-old track on the Rio Norte Line....
MAN 1: Some sections of this rail line, one of Taggart's most important...
...have fallen into disrepair over the last decades.
WOMAN 2: The rails of the Rio Norte Line have not been replaced in over 100 years.
MAN 1: This marks the first time Rearden
Steel has been used this extensively...
...in a major railroad construction project in the country.
MAN 2:
Going slow and safe, slow and safe.
MAN 3:
Get two men on that side.
MAN 2:
Pull the pin.
Your speech at this dinner tonight better inspire confidence.
The National Council of Metal Industries...
...is questioning the structural integrity of Rearden Metal.
I just hope you can defend Rearden Metal against Bertram Scudder.
Scudder?
You didn't tell me there would be other speakers.
We want to be objective, hear all sides.
Especially in front of the media.
Objective?
Did you read the hatchet job he did on Hank Rearden in his magazine?
And why is there media at a private dinner?
You're gonna debate Scudder on the safety concerns of Rearden Metal.
Driver?
Pull over.
What are you doing?
I don't need to defend my decision to use Rearden Metal.
But, apparently, you do.
Good luck.
How is it gonna look when we're not there to defend our own proposal?
TAWNY [ON TV]: Taggart construction crews reached the foot of The Rockies this morning.
Over 125 miles of track have been replaced in little over a month...
...with still almost 200 miles more to go.
This is Tawny Johnson reporting from Granby, Colorado.
MAN:
Ease off on that, big bro.
POTTER:
The State Science Institute...
...is simply requesting that you stop production...
...until the economy can stabilize.
The answer is no.
At a time of desperate steel shortages...
...we can't afford to allow the expansion of a company which produces too much...
...and might replace companies which produce too little.
That is how you create an unbalanced economy.
Oh. Well, I tell you what.
If you can answer me one simple question truthfully...
...l'll consider your request.
Is Rearden Metal good or not?
I'm authorized by the government to pay you a very generous sum...
...for the rights to Rearden Metal.
What would seem fair to you?
Tell me if Rearden Metal is good or not and l'll sell you the rights.
I think that's a very selfish question to ask at a time of great economic uncertainty.
Is Rearden Metal good or not?
Answer the question, doctor.
The question of Rearden Metal being good or not is irrelevant.
If Rearden Metal is not good, it's a physical danger to the public.
If it is good...
...it's a social danger.
If you have any proof that
Rearden Metal poses a physical threat...
...show it to me.
Otherwise, we're done here.
Why is it so important for you to struggle for years squeezing out meager gains...
...rather than accept a fortune for Rearden Metal?
Because it's mine.
Do you understand that concept?
Mine.
Why are you taking such a hard-line position?
I don't understand.
I don't think you'll ever understand, doctor.
And Rearden Metal is good.
I can't risk making more switches for you...
...out of that unproven metal.
Too many people think it's unsafe.
What people?
I just don't want any trouble.
Herbert, look.
You've been working with Rearden Metal for four months now.
You know it is the best material available.
What's going on?
I got a family. I need to make money.
I'm trying to survive here.
And you will.
Continue manufacturing my mainline switches.
There have been threats.
Who is threatening you?
The State Science Institute has issued a statement...
...warning people against the use of Rearden Metal.
And what are they saying, exactly?
It's what they're implying.
DAGNY:
It was issued under your name.
Make it a habit of letting the Institute speak for you...
...even if the words it uses are false?
Miss Taggart, it is public opinion that Rearden Metal is unsafe.
What about the truth?
Which truth?
That Rearden Metal is the best material available on the market today.
It's strong, it is safe. You know that.
Please, have a seat.
Please. Consider my side, Miss Taggart.
I work for the last center of science left on Earth.
We do rely on public funding.
Which do l sacrifice?
An excellent piece of smelting or the future of this institute?
Miss Taggart.
Please sit down.
I had three brilliant students...
...that l shared with another
Philosophy professor, Hugh Akston.
Doctor Stadler, l don't understand what this has to do--
We even had a bet.
Who would win over their hearts and minds first?
One of them became a depraved playboy.
His name was Francisco D'Anconia.
I know who he is.
The second, Ragnar Danneskjold, became a pirate...
...stealing to give to the rich.
And the third?
The third one simply vanished.
We were expecting such a magnificent future for them.
I do wish you best of luck, Miss Taggart.
Sorry, l'm late.
Please, continue.
MAN [ON TV]:
Today, the Rio Norte Line...
...completed 211 miles of replaced track using the new Rearden Steel.
WOMAN: According to studies, Rearden's new steel, mined with the latest standard....
MAN: This extensively in a major railroad construction project in the country.
WYATT:
Hello, Dagny.
Mr. Wyatt. Hello.
There was a big-rig pileup a couple of weeks ago.
Landslide closed down the supply line for workers and the rail.
I thought we'd be down for a couple of weeks.
We were back up and running in 24 hours.
I figured someone knew how to manage a crisis up here.
Nice job.
Can't afford to fall behind.
We have to get those rails in place before the first snows come.
I underestimated you.
Hey, Dagny?
If you ever want a job....
I'll keep that in mind.
MAN 1: lt comes from the reservoir.
Make sure it's clean.
HENRY: l was watching you with the workers there.
You look as at home there as you do in that office of yours.
I'm needed here.
This is important.
MAN 2:
Yeah, go ahead.
What you need is to replace that bridge.
DAGNY:
Not a chance.
I have to be ready in six months.
MAN 3: Plenty.
What if I told you l could have it made in three months...
...and that it would last for centuries?
Let me check my budget.
I can make it happen.
Now, l'm staying in town tonight.
I was wondering if you'd like join me for dinner.
I can't.
I have to get back to New York.
But walk with me.
Do you think it can be stopped?
HENRY: This new line or us?
DAGNY: Both.
What's going on, Eddie?
Ben Nealy's quit.
Kellogg, McNamara, now Nealy.
That's not all,
Dagny.
Taggart Transcontinental stocks have plummeted...
...because the State Science Institute has denounced Rearden Metal.
Your family's railroad is in real trouble.
Eddie.
I think it's time to stand on our own.
In order to save my family's business...
...l'm gonna have to abandon it.
SECRETARY:
Good morning, Miss Taggart.
Taggart Transcontinental is done.
What are you talking about?
We're finished.
We can't stop and we can't go on.
In weeks, our stock won't be trading anymore.
You're paranoid. Orren Boyle has assured me there is pending--
Here's what we are gonna do.
And, Jim, this is not a proposal.
Just listen and accept.
I'm gonna take a leave from Taggart Transcontinental.
Start my own company.
You're leaving?
Shut up. You and the board are gonna transfer the Rio Norte Line over to me.
Our stock will go back up.
I will act as my own contractor.
I will get my own financing and finish the line on time.
And where are you gonna get financing?
That is not for you to worry about.
Once we see how the rails perform...
...l will transfer the line back over to Taggart Transcontinental...
...and return to my job.
Okay. And what are you gonna call this new line of yours, Dagny?
You're not dragging the family name through this.
I won't allow it.
The John Galt Line.
Now we know why you've gone off the rails.
That's the name.
It's your disaster.
And what's the plan if you fail?
I go down alone.
Taggart Transcontinental remains in your control.
Two last things.
What?
First, I'm taking Eddie Willers.
Oh, no, no.
I need him here.
Tough.
You're gonna have to do your own work.
Second, keep your cronies in Washington off my back.
Make sure I get all my permissions, grants, authorizations...
...and any other political crap l need from those sons of bitches, otherwise, no deal.
I'll see what l can do.
And one last warning, brother dear.
I have never done anything to hurt a living creature in my entire life.
But if you double-cross me in any way...
...l will destroy you.
DAGNY:
The money would mean nothing to you.
You've wasted that on senseless parties.
You've wasted more in the San Sebastian mines.
I'm afraid I can't. Money's tight.
I've got too many expenses.
Okay.
So, what do you want me to do, Frisco?
Do you want me to beg?
Because now I'm begging.
Ha.
You don't know how.
I thought that you of all people would understand.
Then is it me that you want?
Don't ask me such a thing, Dagny.
If l ever meant anything to you...
...loan me the money that l need.
I can't.
What is this savior line gonna be called?
The John Galt Line.
What?
Because I am tired of hearing that name.
It means quitting, giving up.
And l am not giving up.
I am not going to quit.
I'm going to win.
MAN:
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.
So, what do you think?
Just one last thing.
[PHONE RlNGING]
I'll make sets for you.
No.
Okay.
So maybe you can see about an opportunity....
[PHONE RlNGING]
KEN [OVER PHONE]:
Dagny? Ken Danagger.
I have some good news.
Mr. Rearden, Miss Taggart is--
As president of the John Galt Line...
...l would like to commission a Rearden Metal bridge for Wyatt Junction.
Excellent. I'll start rolling the metal.
Aren't you curious as to how
I'm able to finance this?
Okay, l'll bite.
Ellis Wyatt, Ted Nielsen,
Lawrence Hammond, Kenneth Danagger.
I'm not at 100 percent bonds sold yet, but I am close.
Hmm.
There. l just made up the difference.
I would never ask anyone to take a risk
I wasn't willing to take.
You're a good man, Hank Rearden.
Can l show you something?
GWEN:
Mr. Rearden's office.
No, he's in a meeting.
May I give you his voicemail?
Thank you.
DAGNY: Looks like an engine.
HENRY: Not like any engine I've ever seen.
Where did you find this?
Remember that motor company
I was telling you about in Wisconsin?
I did a little digging around and l found these.
DAGNY:
Twentieth Century Motor Corporation.
It's a prototype for a new engine.
It never went into production.
I'm not even sure the thing works.
Well, it's worth a look.
Once the John Galt line is complete,
I'd like to look into this further.
Care to help?
GWEN: Let me see what l can do.
Absolutely.
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Rearden.
There's an urgent call on line two.
HENRY:
Hank Rearden.
What?
Find Mouch.
What is it?
The legislature passed the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.
So quickly? How is that even possible?
I don't know.
You know what this means?
Nobody can own more than one company.
We'll fix this.
I'll sign away my other companies, but they are not getting my metal.
What about Wyatt's bridge?
I gave my word.
It will be done on time and on budget.
This is just a technicality, Hank.
Okay.
I'll always consider the ore mine as yours.
No.
I either own the property or l don't.
You can trust me.
You know you'll always have as much ore as you need.
I don't know.
I've never given you any reason to mistrust me.
The mine is yours.
If you intend to keep your word, then keep it.
If you wanna give me first call on the ore produced, fine.
If you intend to double-cross me...
...so be it.
It's not fair, Hank.
It wasn't me who passed the law.
DAGNY:
That is correct.
The first train on the John Galt Line will run July 22nd.
MAN: Great news. Thank you, Dagny.
My pleasure, thank you.
Dagny, this is, uh, Mr. Brady, a delegate from the Union of Locomotive Engineers.
You're busy. l'll be brief.
We're not gonna allow you to run that train.
Get out of here.
You do not come and tell me what you will or will not allow me to do.
What l meant to say was a committee decided...
...that allowing men to run your train on that untested metal...
...would violate their human rights.
Are you serious, Mr. Brady?
You can't force men to go out and get killed for profit.
Put that in writing.
That you want to stop your men from working and earning a wage.
Miss Taggart, you don't understand--
DAGNY:
Oh, no, no, no. l understand perfectly.
You want me to provide the jobs...
...and you wanna make it impossible for me to have any jobs to provide.
You can do whatever you want with your men.
But that train will run if l have to drive myself.
Because, Mr. Brady, if that bridge collapses...
...there won't be any railroad left in existence.
But if it does not collapse...
...no member of your union will ever get a job...
...on the John Galt Line.
Now are you going to forbid your men to run that train?
I never used the word forbid.
I'm only stating that you cannot force anyone to take that run.
I would never force a man to do anything.
I'll ask for volunteers.
Then it will be my problem, not yours.
I'll advise them to refuse.
Do what you want, Mr. Brady.
But leave them the choice.
MAN [ON TV]: We have breaking news from Cheyenne, Wyoming...
...where the maiden run of the
John Galt Line is about to commence...
...despite numerous warnings from the State Science Institute.
Two hundred fifty miles per hour all the way.
The John Galt Line's the future of rail travel.
We're gonna prove it today.
REPORTER:
Miss Taggart, who is John Galt?
We are.
One hundred.
One fifty.
One seventy-five.
Two fifty.
That's faster than any train has ever gone in this country.
There she is.
We did it.
[TRAIN BELL RlNGING]
MAN [ON TV]: Today in Colorado, the John Galt Line made a successful run...
...over its new Rearden Metal bridge.
The controversial metal bridge held up perfectly...
...despite strong warnings from the State Science Institute.
WYATT: Three hundred miles in less than 90 minutes.
Was there ever any doubt?
No, because there was no doubt
I prepared a meal for the two of you.
SECRETARY [OVER INTERCOM]:
Orren Boyle is on the line.
BOYLE [OVER PHONE]:
Did you see?
I'm watching it now.
If the John Galt Line succeeds, it's gonna make Wyatt unstoppable.
Now, what can be done?
MOUCH: Don't you see?
It's his own success that provides us the tools to bring him down.
He's not only given us the rope, he's tied the knot.
All we have to do is slip it over his head.
This might work to our advantage.
[SHOUTING]
I love it. Here we go.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHlNG]
Oh, yeah, you want that.
So?
And he said,
"It smells like museo de las poopias."
[ALL LAUGHING]
I want to tell both of you something.
Do you know the Buena Esperanza Pass?
Well, yeah, the Buena Esperanza Pass.
That area has been dry for years.
WYATT:
Ah. To conventional drilling, yes.
There is an untapped reservoir of oil in those rocks...
...which is larger than any known reserve in the Saudi Peninsula.
And underneath is an ocean of natural gas.
Soon everyone will be wanting to get on the bandwagon.
And, my friends, we are the band.
I will drink to that.
Hear, hear.
To Colorado and the New Renaissance.
And forget about the Stone Age and the lron Age.
Let's have a toast to the Age of Rearden Metal.
And the John Galt Line.
Ahem. Well, l can see that the market has opened in Hong Kong.
I have some phone calls to make.
You have been charming company, but I must excuse myself.
There are guest rooms upstairs.
Help yourself.
Thank you for everything.
My pleasure, partner.
Sir.
Sir.
My, uh, casa es su casa, and so on.
Good night.
Good night.
HENRY:
Good night.
It's good to know there are men like Wyatt left in the world.
I wish I could hold myself in the same esteem.
I have a wife.
And somewhere l have a company that's being pulled apart.
Yet here we are.
And all l wanna do right now is kiss you.
What's stopping you?
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Ellis Wyatt?
Yes?
Could l have a moment of your time?
WYATT:
At this hour? Who the hell are you?
MAN:
My name is familiar to you.
HENRY:
Good morning. Where's Wyatt?
DAGNY:
Morning.
You're up early.
I didn't want to wake you.
Look at this.
He thanked us and he's looking forward to the Second Renaissance. That's it.
Odd.
Mm-hm.
So l was thinking.
I thought we might take a trip, a little getaway.
How scandalous.
You're a married man.
MAN:
There you go, sir.
Where are we going?
You remember that folder with the strange engine?
Yeah.
I thought we might visit the Twentieth
Century Motor Company in Wisconsin.
When do we leave?
DAGNY: It's a real mystery why the
Twentieth Century Motor Company failed.
HENRY: lt's no mystery.
Bad ideas brought it down.
DAGNY:
Ideas?
HENRY: As I understand it, the company flattened the wage scale...
...and still paid everyone according to their needs...
...not according to their contributions.
DAGNY: Why all these stupid altruistic urges? lt's not being charitable or fair.
What is it with people today?
HENRY:
So after a short while, no surprise...
...the smartest managers and the better workers left the company.
But hundreds of remaining staff couldn't handle it alone.
Service dropped...
...quality in their once-great products was gone, and that was that.
The Twentieth Century Motor Company went under.
That's depressing.
Looks like they just walked away.
Not much here.
It's too bad.
I'd really like to figure out what happened here.
Dagny.
This is it.
This is where they made the engine.
Do you think it's here?
Why would they leave all this stuff here?
Some of this is incredibly sophisticated.
It's unbelievable.
Hank?
Atmospheric vacuum.
What?
This motor uses the Casimir effect.
It's this small particle accelerator.
It throws small helium particles into heavier particles.
And this must be a secondary cooling system.
Probably designed to eliminate excess heat generated during the process.
Exactly, and this creates a magnetic field in place long enough...
...for the collapsing vacuum pressure to be captured.
An engine that uses atmospheric vacuum to create static electricity.
Now, does it say anywhere on this document who designed this thing?
I don't see any names.
We could get a list of the building employees.
We'd go to the town hall of records.
Find the last owner of the factory.
We'd track it back from there.
Dagny, this could change the world.
That factory has had a long line of owners and the records are not complete.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Okay.
So l guess this is our starting point.
I bought it in a bankruptcy sale.
From a guy named Eugene Lawson.
Do you got any idea how we might contact Mr. Lawson?
He's in Washington now.
At the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, I think.
My goal is social progress, universal prosperity.
Welfare of the nation is my primary consideration...
...to which l wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice anyone's profit.
Well, Mr. Rearden, you must be awfully proud of your man Mouch.
He's doing big things in Colorado to help the nation.
I no longer have interest in Mr. Mouch.
Oh.
I see.
Well, that's, uh-- That's too bad.
Jed Starnes.
Excuse me?
Jed Starnes.
He was an engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
I hope that helps.
My father was an evil man.
But surely, he must have mentioned something about work?
A motor perhaps?
The chief engineer was William Hastings.
He quit the day after we introduced the plan.
You'll find him in Brandon, Wyoming.
MRS. HASTINGS: My husband died five years ago, Miss Taggart.
DAGNY:
Did he ever mention a motor he created?
It was his young assistant.
William always said he was, oh, ahead of his time.
Called him a genius.
Do you know where we might be able to find that man today?
Oh, l have no idea.
He did keep in touch with a professor that he had at the Patrick Henry University.
Hugh Akston was his name.
I know that name.
Do you know where he is?
Well, Mr. Akston was rumored to have opened a roadside diner near Cheyenne.
HENRY:
I gotta get back to my mills.
Now?
I have a business to run.
We can't quit now, Hank.
You're so close.
Imagine what will happen if we find the inventor and get it up and running.
HENRY: Okay, give me a few days.
I'll meet you in Colorado.
Hi, Dagny. Hank.
I'm back.
I just want to see how you're doing.
DAGNY: I'm great.
I'm heading up to Akston's diner now.
Eddie on the other line, l'll call you back.
Hey, Eddie, what's up?
The Union of Locomotive Engineers is demanding...
...that all trains on the John Galt Line be reduced from 100 to 60 miles an hour.
If we don't comply, as of right now...
...Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah are not allowing any trains into Colorado.
This is madness.
EDDIE: That's not all, Dagny.
Orren Boyle is campaigning for a bill...
...that would limit the production of Rearden Metal.
Is that my sister on the phone?
Let me talk to her.
Where the hell are you?
Do you have any idea what's happening here?
Jim, this is your battle. l've fought mine.
They're your friends. You stop them.
Dr. Akston, I was wondering if you remember a young engineer...
...who worked at the Twentieth Century
Motor Corporation about 10 years ago.
He worked with a man named William Hastings.
Could you tell me where to find him?
Does this car get good mileage?
Is he still alive?
Is there anything that you can tell me?
I've traveled a very long way to be here.
Yeah.
You got a long way to go too.
Excuse me. I have to be heading home.
Dr. Akston? One more question.
I need the name of your student who worked at Twentieth Century Motor--
I know why you're here, Miss Taggart.
Do you?
The secret you're trying to solve, it's greater...
...and l mean much greater than an engine that runs on atmospheric electricity.
Good luck.
DAGNY: I'm not gonna give up trying to find the inventor of that motor.
AKSTON: Oh, don't worry, Miss Taggart.
He'll find you.
WOMAN: You all set?
MAN 1: Yeah.
WOMAN:
Okay.
MAN 2 [ON TV]:
The Equalization of Opportunity Laws.
Coffee?
Yes.
Anything else?
We got rhubarb pie. Made it myself.
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Again, l think it's significant in helping the broad spectrum....
Could you turn that up, please?
MAN 2:
Government is overstepping its bounds?
MOUCH:
Colorado is a rich state.
It's quite unique. It's in a position where it can help its neighborhood needier states.
So I think it's a good thing, yes.
MAN 2: And it's fair to penalize one state?
MOUCH: Please.
You're not penalizing another state.
You're helping another state.
MAN 2: Like a Robin Hood of taking from the rich, feeding the poor.
I mean, rich people are getting richer, poor people are getting poorer.
I heard about what Orren Boyle is up to.
Call me.
BRANSON: Breaking news out of Wyatt Junction, Colorado.
A major fire has erupted at the Wyatt Oil Field.
Reports are coming in that several explosions have rocked the hillside.
Our news team has captured this unedited footage on the scene.
MAN 3: As you can see, the hillside behind me is completely engulfed in flames.
Fire crews have been brought in from as far away as Denver County...
...to help battle the blaze, as many as 40 acres....
And zero containment at the moment.
ANNOUNCER [ON RADlO]:
My fellow Americans, Mr. Wesley Mouch.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Thank you. Thank you.
As the new coordinator...
...of the Bureau of Economic Planning...
...and National Resources...
...l have issued a set of directives.
I am placing a moratorium on all railroad lines.
Additionally, under my direction...
...all steel mills must produce steel at the same level and output...
...and distribute it according to the needs of the people.
Furthermore, big companies will no longer be permitted...
...to abandon their present states and move to wealthier states like Colorado.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Finally, a federal tax will be applied to the state of Colorado...
...in order to equalize the national economy.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Thank you.
He gave a good speech.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Welcome to my town, James.
[TRUCK HORN HONKlNG]
[SIRENS WAlLlNG]
[EXPLOSlON BOOMS
AND CROWD SCREAMS]
MAN:
Move it.
Lady, stop. You can't go in there.
Ellis.
MAN:
Ellis Wyatt?
WYATT:
Who the hell are you?
GALT:
My name is John Galt.
I live in a place we call Atlantis.
And l think you'd fit in there.
It's a place where heroes live.
And where those who want to be heroes live.
The government we have there...
...respects each of us as individuals and as producers.
Actually, beyond a few courthouses, there's not much of a government at all.
Bottom line, Mr. Wyatt...
...if you're weary of a government that refuses to limit power over you...
...and if you're ready to claim the moral right to your own life...
...then we should leave.
And l'll take you there.
I'll take you to Atlantis.
[YELLING]
No!
WYATT:
This is Ellis Wyatt. I'm gone.
Don't try to find me. You won't.
I am on strike.

Just tell me why.
BeckyLyn.
BeckyLyn, I won't hate you.
I promise.
Bless you, Sister.
The Prophet.
Take heart.
- Prophet.
- Courage, son.
Alexandra.
Be brave, girl.
She confess?
She's still in shock.
You're a doctor now, Hiram?
And you know I don't like the county here.
It's a murder, sir.
It'd be better if she confessed.
I saw them carry him out.
You were there?
In a plastic bag, like garbage.
You shouldn't have been there.
Things like that don't happen to us.
It didn't happen to us, Queenie.
Sawyer Scott was one of us.
BeckyLyn is one of us, and she's sitting in a jail cell right now, with the Gentiles.
She's gonna have her day in court.
- And if she didn't do it...
- She didn't do it.
That's not up to us.
BeckyLyn didn't kill her husband.
Honey, the Prophet is waiting for us to make a mistake.
And we're not going to, are we?
That's my girl.
Daddy.
Hi, honey.
Angela! Good morning.
Morning, Dad.
- Morning, Mom.
- Hi, baby.
Hey, Jordan.
What's up?
She did it. She killed the son of a bitch.
I'm holding on your rope
Got me 10 feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say
That it's too late to apologize...
Jordan.
You know what you did.
You touched a girl, didn't you?
You touched Queenie, didn't you?
Sawyer.
You have to go now, Jordan.
One day you'll understand.
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
Your ring.
Turn around.
No, please!
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Did anybody see you?
Just the whole town.
I'm sorry about your mother.
I don't wanna talk about her.
She loves you.
She needs you.
This is what we used to do, remember, and I always won.
You did good.
I mean, you still live in Mesadale.
And you married a cop when you were 16.
- You're gonna get serious?
- Just for a minute.
Not allowed.
I should have written you back.
I... I couldn't because...
- For 10 years.
- It was my fault.
- No.
- We were too close.
No, we were best friends.
Boys and girls are not supposed to be best friends.
Yeah, yeah. Sitting in that crappy classroom listening to the Prophet's tapes every day,
"A righteous boy will populate the Earth.
"A righteous boy will kill his enemies."
"The righteous boy will not covet his neighbor's daughter."
You really think that's what did it, because I touched your arm?
No!
It was because of my old man.
He was worried about the competition.
That's why they throw the righteous boys out and you know it.
How else will the elders get their hands on those luscious little girls?
And then, what does my loving mother do about it?
She give me... This is great.
She gives me 12 bucks and a change of sacred fricking underwear and dumps me in the middle of nowhere.
Was it hard?
Getting tossed out?
Your life. After.
It was the best thing that could have ever happened.
I'm fine.
I work construction,
I have a decent apartment, and I have friends.
One of your friends a girl?
Not right now, no.
You know, I have to say I didn't expect this.
I mean, where are the other wives and the 20 kids?
There aren't any.
Hiram has refused to take another wife.
Why?
Because he loves me.
And I love him.
This is Hiram Alton we're talking about, right?
The guy who wears a gun for the church?
For the town.
That's what I said.
He's a good man.
And the Prophet doesn't mind?
He likes Hiram.
So he hasn't forced another wife on him yet.
And you leave before he does.
You take Angela in one hand, and you take your cop in the other, and you get the hell out, I'll help.
I know people in the real Mormon Church.
People who helped me. They'll take you in and they will keep you safe from these crazy bastards down here.
I'm gonna show you something, all right?
But please don't ask me why I got it.
"Wife No. 19."
My mother was number 19.
"A complete expose of Mormonism
"revealing the sufferings of women in polygamy.
"By Ann Eliza Young, 1875."
Even I know who that is.
Does Hiram know you have this?
Has it helped?
- You haven't read it.
- I... I will.
"Dearest reader, it is to show the pitiable condition
"of women held in a system of bondage
"more cruel than African slavery."
It's not a joke.
You always do that.
Every time things got bad, you made jokes.
Were they funny?
Your mother's in jail.
For murder.
And that isn't funny.
That's her problem, not mine.
Then why did you come?
You want me to leave?
I want you to go see your mother.
I prayed to our Heavenly Father, that he would bring you to me, and he did.
I know why you've come.
Why?
To save me.
What?
No, that is not why.
I just... I came...
I don't know why I came.
I don't owe you anything.
I didn't wanna give you up, Jordan.
I loved you, I will always love you.
Great way to show it.
The Prophet said God wanted that from me and from you.
And from me, too?
I thought that you would understand that by now.
Okay, here's what I understand.
Your insane religion, all of it is crap.
And you know what I thought when I read about the murder?
I thought, "Thank God she finally woke up."
Jordan, I did not kill your father.
How could you believe that?
I loved him.
That is why you've come.
To help me get out of here, because I did not do it.
So you'll go to the lawyer and you'll tell him.
All right?
Tell him.
No. No, of course.
You don't owe me...
...anything.
Do you?
Should've seen her face.
It was like I punched her.
And they cut her hair.
Yeah. Can you imagine what that...
You know I could've just said,
"I'll go see the lawyer," make her happy.
Not that I'm here to make her happy.
God forbid.
Not that it would make a difference either.
I mean, what's the lawyer gonna say?
That she's innocent.
Do you really think your mother could hurt anyone?
Dropping me off in the middle of nowhere doesn't count?
Come on.
I mean, what choice did she have?
A woman saying no to her husband in this town?
She did the best she could.
Well, her fingerprints are on the gun.
The sister wives saw her.
I don't care. She didn't do it.
You're so sure?
Yes, I am. Absolutely sure.
As sure as you are about your faith?
This is the story of my youth in great Salt Lake City.
My name is Ann Eliza Young.
My father Chauncey was a successful man, a wagon-maker to the great
Prophet Brigham Young.
Sealed to my mother when she was only 15.
We thought we were a happy family.
Until the day he came home with a new wife.
Before my father brought a second, then a third wife into our home, my mother was a strong and assured woman.
A man could not destroy her confidence.
Yet I would see her become one of those sad wives who begs for her husband's attention, and weeps when she's alone.
This is what polygamy does to even the strongest among us.
I don't see what the big deal is anyways.
Hair grows back.
It is forbidden for women in the first church to cut their hair.
Why?
A sister wife's hair must be long.
So that when she goes to heaven, she can wash her husband's feet with it.
Leave her be.
Mr. Heber, Jordan Scott.
Please.
Well.
Not a happy case.
No.
Now, sad to say, but you're all
BeckyLyn has at this point.
Now, I want you to go to your mother,
I want you to tell her to take a plea.
What kind of plea?
Second degree murder.
Just like that?
There are facts, and evidence...
Yeah.
Strongly, strongly against.
Can't you try self-defense or temporary insanity?
You're talking about trial?
No, no, no, son. We do not want a trial.
Not in St. George.
We'll get 12 people who see your mother in that dress, as just another one of those
Mesadale fanatics, who pervert the name of the real Mormon Church, who...
Well, you know better than I.
What's the deal?
It's 25 to 40.
Now...
Twenty?
It sounds like a long time, I know.
It sounds like that's the rest of her life.
No, no, I mean, you can't just give up.
Despite your opinion, this plea-bargain is in no way a surrender.
Your mother will suffer a far worse alternative if this goes to court, I promise you.
What alternative?
Well, that would be the death penalty, son.
Um, a small latte to go.
Jordan Scott?
You know me?
I'm your sister.
Well, not really. Only by marriage.
My mom Kimberly, she married your dad after you left.
BeckyLyn's the 19th, my mom's 23.
And proud of it.
Wow. All right.
Proud of marrying that creep.
You know, he used to make the wives cut his toenails?
You ever see his toenails?
Only when he was kicking me.
You know, your mom keeps a photo of you in her room.
When I heard the news about the murder,
I was like, "Lady, you beat me to it."
Sarah.
Five. The fifth Sarah of the family.
But, hey, screw the Sarah. Just call me Five.
How'd you get out?
I ran away.
About a month ago.
Hitched a ride to Vegas.
Remember how the Prophet told us that there was a war in Europe and all the unbelievers killed each other, and there wasn't anything left?
Okay, well, when I got to Vegas,
I heard this guy, and he was speaking French.
So, I was so excited, I ran up to him, and I said, "You survived!"
What are you doing in St. George?
Isn't that too close?
Yeah, well, I was just gonna stay here a few weeks.
Just long enough to sneak back into Mesadale, and get my mom out.
Then the murder happened, and now everything is, like, locked down.
But I know exactly what's gonna happen next.
The Prophet will get some old guy to marry all the wives.
Will keep the family together, and she'll go along with it, because the Prophet's the frickin' word of God.
They're still looking for the Taliban.
Well, hello, they're 50 miles down the road.
You know anything about the murder?
I ran away.
Right.
Anyway, you know the Prophet.
He probably did it.
You think?
I wasn't there.
Here's your latte.
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
It's not a confession.
It's more an arrangement.
BeckyLyn, the fingerprints on the murder weapon are yours, four sister wives saw you leaving
Scott's office, there's an instant message typed by Scott himself.
Do you wanna hear it?
"MAN OF THE HOUSE:
Have to go, my wife is here.
"DESERT MISSY:
Which one?
"MAN OF THE HOUSE:
Nineteen."
Sign.
Guard.
Hey.
Hiram, this is Jordan.
Yeah, we know each other.
He used to beat me up after school.
Yeah, that was fun.
I told Hiram why you came.
Any advice?
You were excommunicated.
I'm sure you know what that means.
Mesadale shouldn't be my first choice for a holiday?
I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a whole lot of empty country around here.
People disappear.
But that means it's danger for Queenie, too, doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Daddy.
I'm sorry, Angela.
Forgot about our playtime.
How are you?
Goodbye, Jordan.
Right.
Wait. I'll walk you out.
That was a great idea. You come up with that all by yourself?
What did the lawyer say?
Nothing good.
Well, what?
You know what?
Cop's right. You shouldn't get into this.
I'm already into it, Jordan.
Who wrote you the letter?
Who got you out here?
What did the lawyer say?
He said that she could get the death penalty.
Death?
Are you gonna do something about it?
Jordan!
Yes.
Okay. Good.
We'll make a plan. We'll...
We?
We.
Okay.
I don't like Jordan.
I do.
He's gonna bring trouble down on you.
He was my best friend.
And he still is.
But you are my love.
Am I?
You're the love of my life. You know that.
I'm your wife, Hiram.
Then follow the commandments of the church, Queenie.
Obey your husband, don't try to change everything.
I don't want to change anything.
I want it all to stay the same.
Just us.
In our house, like it is right now.
Then I will make sure it stays that way.
Just keep them away.
I will.
I will.
Seeing our home destroyed by polygamy,
I vowed it would never happen to me.
I was naive enough to think I could succeed.
Ann Eliza.
- President Young.
- Come.
It's a long walk.
I'm sure you know, child, that in my position,
I am privy to many a rumor.
And one that I hear time and time again, is that Ann Eliza Webb has refused every suitor who has bent a knee to her.
The rumor is true, sir.
But in my defense, may I say, that I have seen what marriage can do to a woman, and I have no desire to make the same mistake.
It is the duty of every saint in Zion to marry.
Do you not intend to do your duty?
Miss Webb?
Please give your parents my highest regard.
Sister Kimberly!
Why don't I lend a hand?
What are you doing here?
I... Well, I haven't been over since brother Scott's death.
You haven't been over since you were married.
How are the sisters doing?
We are all broken.
He was the love of my life, thus he was the love of all our lives.
Sister wives are as one.
But then you have no sister wives, so I can't expect you to understand.
Well, I've known BeckyLyn since the day I was born, and I just can't believe that she's guilty of murder.
Can you?
If the Prophet tells us she's guilty, then she's guilty.
Did you see her that morning?
No.
Some of the wives said...
I was upstairs with my daughter.
I didn't see anything.
- Upstairs with?
- Sarah.
Sarah. Five.
And she was here? I... I...
- I thought I heard that...
- She ran away?
Is that what they told you?
Well, they're wrong.
Why would she leave her own mother?
She was taken, by the casinos.
The Prophet said that?
He laid his hand on me, and he said,
"She is in Las Vegas and will never return.
"You must forget her."
Forget your own daughter?
How can you do that?
I can do it.
Now, how come you can just leave Mesadale whenever you want?
I didn't think young women were allowed out.
Hiram lets me.
He lets you. That's nice of him.
That's not what I...
Jordan, my husband loves me.
He protects me. He's the only man in Mesadale who accepts me as his only wife.
So would you just stop it?
Okay.
Does he know what you're doing now?
You're helping him?
You said you ran away a month ago.
I always thought you were like this true believer.
Your mom said that you were there when Scott was killed.
You saw my mom?
- Hey.
- Well, how did she look?
Hey, just tell me.
She looked well.
Okay, 'cause sometimes she doesn't eat.
- And I used to always cook...
- Five.
What?
Why did you lie?
Because you just might start thinking that I did it.
Sherlock.
Did you?
Somebody beat me to it.
What is she doing here?
I'm here to help BeckyLyn.
That is just about the worst idea
I've ever heard.
A sister and a lost boy poking around in the Prophet's business.
Do you know how stupid that is?
Don't expect any help from me.
We don't want any help, just a copy of the police report.
That all?
Well, then, why don't I just violate at least 10 statutes and hand it over?
At least let us look at it.
No.
- Come on, man, help us out!
- I said no.
Help us out.
Just cut us a break. Let us look at it.
You don't understand the process.
Just let us look at it.
Okay, Jordan.
No. No is no.
Okay, I... I'm sorry. Sorry, he's very...
I'm not done with him.
Just walk. Walk!
Just walk!
It's just technical stuff, mostly.
Blood spray patterns, pictures.
You know, it's not much help.
If we get caught, am I gonna go to jail?
You bet.
No, no, I'm kidding.
You did an amazing thing. Come on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back.
What's that?
Wow.
SweetSally, Desert Missy and Jen45.
Oh, jeez.
This is good.
Yeah, plus, it makes you proud to know your father's a horny scumbag.
I mean, 25 wives and he still has to go online.
No, no, it's good. It is, it is.
I'll e-mail them, you know, see if they can help us out.
Hello, Mom.
You didn't leave.
Queenie!
You have faith, it'll grow back.
It's a sin.
Did they give you a choice?
Then it's not a sin.
You'll tell the sisters?
Mom, listen.
We're both doing what we can to help, but you need to help yourself, too.
You can't just sit there.
I'm not sitting. I'm praying.
Praying isn't gonna get it done, okay?
We need something real, something we can take into court.
BeckyLyn, you must know something about...
About what?
Come on.
Heber told you about the deal, didn't he?
Did he tell you about the alternative?
BeckyLyn.
There is something.
Maybe.
Something?
A rivalry.
Between?
Your father and the Prophet.
Five said the Prophet had something to do with it.
BeckyLyn, you don't really think that the Prophet killed brother Scott.
The Prophet would never do anything like that.
Then what are you saying?
I'm tired.
I'm very tired.
I'm gonna get you!
Let me take your bag.
Here we go.
You're gonna make someone a beautiful wife someday.
Won't she? Come on.
You honor our home.
Did Hiram offer you anything?
No, you look like you've had a long day.
Hey, Angela.
Did your mommy have a long day? Hmm?
Was there something you wished to speak to me about?
No, my business was with your husband.
And we're done.
Where you coming from, anyways?
Down in St. George again?
How bad is it?
He's chosen another one for me.
Who?
One of Garth Young's.
Which one?
Evie.
Evie's 14.
You listen to me.
It'll never happen. Okay?
Though I'd hoped my family would protect me,
I knew Brigham's wishes were law.
Ann Eliza, would you sit down?
It seems the Prophet has proposed marriage.
He will look after you better than any man in Zion, with separate lodgings and $500 a year.
How much for you?
You should consider yourself the luckiest woman in the kingdom.
One of the luckiest, anyway.
How many does he have now, 50?
Ann Eliza. Plural marriage is not a choice.
It is God's will.
Then I will leave, Father, and go to hell.
For I will not wed Brigham Young.
What?
You went to the jail?
- Yeah.
- With him.
The Prophet knows, Queenie.
You're becoming a problem for him.
I told you, I will fight for us.
But I will, too.
Whatever I can do, just tell me.
Don't help him.
"Passing"?
You're not bad-looking.
So are you and Queenie like an item?
Yeah, it's hard to get past the stupid clothes.
But she's pretty, isn't she?
She's married.
What, she can't be pretty if she's married?
She can't be an item if she's married.
Is that right?
Well, then maybe you and me...
Okay.
What, you want me to put on a long dress?
No, no, I want you to wait until you're older.
Okay? How old are you?
Eighteen.
Sixteen.
- I'll be 16.
- When?
Next year.
Okay. Do you go to school?
Did you go to school?
Do you have anybody who takes care of you?
Did anybody take care of you?
You know, there are places that you can go that will take you in.
Drop dead, pretty boy.
"Jen45: I'm shocked to hear about
Mr. Scott's passing..."
He sent her a photo.
It's our anniversary picture.
I gave him that rifle.
It was my present to him.
And what did he give you?
I know what he was like, Jordan.
I married him on my 15th birthday, and I'm aware of every sin he did since then.
But he was my husband, sealed to me by the Prophet himself.
And that's all there is to it.
Sealed by the Prophet who hated him?
The Prophet is above hate, Jordan.
You see the ring? It's my mother's.
Those are her fingers on the gun.
Fingers equal fingerprints.
Her fingers are on the gun because she gave it to him for their anniversary.
Well, if I were the DA,
I'd say, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
"Mrs. Scott certainly touched the rifle, perhaps many times,
"including the day she shot her husband dead!"
Man, it is like you want her locked up.
I do!
I'd much rather visit your mother in prison than visit her grave in the Mesadale cemetery.
Jordan.
Bring back the police file.
Hey, what's up?
I can't do this anymore.
- It's Hiram.
- Hiram.
He's scared.
I've never seen him scared before.
He said every time that I help you, it's like they put a black mark in their little book.
They don't need black marks.
They can take his job.
They can excommunicate him. They...
They can kill him and dump him in the woods.
They can make you marry an 80-year-old letch with Alzheimer's.
Is that really how you want to live your life?
We're fighting them.
No, no. You're right.
It is dangerous and she's not your mother.
I don't want to stop helping her.
And I don't want to stop seeing you.
You know I love you.
And I love you.
- I know you do.
- No, I...
What?
I worry about you.
Yeah, I worry about me.
So if I stop, what are you gonna do?
It's fine. Don't worry. I've got it.
I got an idea.
What idea?
You were right.
I haven't done my duty toward the sister wives.
I'm here to make amends.
Thank you.
Thank you for this.
Well, at least he had taste.
I don't think they touched a thing.
They just decided that BeckyLyn did it.
Yeah, but that works for us, because there's going to be something they left.
How about these?
How much do you wanna bet he never opened that in his life?
I've come today because I know you're afraid of what will happen now your husband is gone.
That heaven's gate will be closed to you, if you leave this Earth alone, and unwed.
But do not fear.
For tomorrow,
I will marry each and every one of you, myself.
So that, when the Lord asks you if you are a wife, you can tell him, you tell him you are the Prophet's wife.
And he shall open the gates of paradise and welcome you with open arms.
Come to me.
It's not in there. You know, what he's saying.
It's not in the book.
Nothing, nothing. It's not in the Book of Mormon.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I guess he did open the book.
What is that?
Was I speeding, Officer?
You get in that piece of crap and drive off, brother.
And you don't think of coming back, because you don't want to see me again.
You hear what I'm saying?
Jordan! What happened?
I'm okay.
Do you have any idea what this is?
It's a marriage management book.
Keep track of the wives, birthdays, anniversaries, when he had sex with them.
Jordan!
Can you tell us what these mean?
I wouldn't know. They keep the books in code.
Right. So the wives can't find out what he thinks of them.
Sister Mary doesn't like it...
All right.
- Jordan.
- No, but it's not all right.
Don't either of you get it? This is all you are to those bastards.
A few dirty scribbles in a notebook because there are so many of you, they can't remember who they screwed last.
No, you are wrong.
They love us, each in our own way. Queenie?
My husband doesn't keep one of those.
Because you don't live the way that we do, you never have.
But I think you believe.
I try to.
But I do, without trying.
Because it is the law, as set down by the Prophet.
- The Prophet.
- Yes, the Prophet!
As he received it by God.
And if you wanna talk to me, you will show me some respect.
All right, all right.
Please.
Just tell me, don't you wanna know what he wrote about you?
I already know.
That morning, he called me to the basement.
He said that he had made a decision.
Will this really help?
It will, I promise.
He said that he no longer wanted to be with me in that way.
He said he was taking me off the list.
- BeckyLyn...
- No!
It is my fault.
No, it is not your fault.
I was a faithful wife to him for 30 years.
I obeyed the Prophet,
I obeyed my husband, but...
Of course you did.
But I could only give him one child.
And I was no longer useful.
You know what, if you didn't kill him, you should have.
Jordan, you do not understand.
He is gone, and I will never get into Heaven.
It was my brother who made me understand that the Prophet could do as he pleased.
His power was absolute.
You've been working for Brigham.
Yes.
Of all the saints, he chose me to construct the great telegraph line.
Save that the pole's rotted, and the money ran out, and the men filed suit.
I went to Brigham and
I groveled and I begged.
He would be delighted to help.
Generous offer.
These gifts don't come without a price, Annie.
What is the price?
You.
Queenie?
What are you doing?
Reading.
What?
It's a true story about Brigham Young's
19th wife.
Is it from the outside?
- It tells about...
- Is it from the outside?
Listen to me. It tells about...
It tells about her struggle with plural marriage. That's why I'm reading it.
To help us.
Are you out of your mind?
No.
You bring this into our house?
Hiram.
I'm trying to help, I'm...
Do you know what would happen if they found this?
Let it go, Hiram.
Just give me the book.
I can't even throw this in the trash!
- I'm just trying to help!
- Did you think about that?
Give me the book, please!
- Queenie!
- Stop!
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
You will never know how much I sacrificed for you.
It's okay, baby.
Here.
Does he know you're here?
No. Well, probably.
Then you should probably go home.
No.
Okay, I tell you what. I will buy you a burger, okay?
And then you better go.
They're cooked by Gentiles.
You're doing a little light reading?
Don't get me started.
Okay, you know what really drives me crazy is all that talk, all those sermons and all that righteous crap, and it's just about sex. That's it.
And the real bonus is that my mother isn't even in the book, because the rotten bastard tossed her out like a worn-out boot.
Wait a minute.
Do you remember she said that he took her name off the list?
Yeah.
I had done my duty.
I was sealed to Brigham Young.
Sealed to him for the rest of my life.
For my enlightenment, brother Brigham, what number am I, 50?
I'm afraid the number of my wives has been greatly exaggerated.
You are, in truth, but number 19.
Well, there are others, to be sure, but they're no longer wives in the biblical sense.
They've come to understand the importance of stepping aside for the potency of youth.
That potency is of the utmost importance to Zion.
Like yours, my darling girl.
BeckyLyn wasn't the 19th wife anymore, that's what your father was telling her.
She'd already been replaced by younger blood.
That was the IM.
"Gotta go, wife's here."
"What number?" "Nineteen."
The new 19. The one who killed him.
Yeah, but there are over 2,000 women in town.
Eliminate married women, women with small breasts, women over 20.
Five.
Yeah, 20, 25...
No, my sister, Five.
She hated him.
She's happy he's dead and she lied about being there.
Let's go.
No.
I'll do this.
You go home, you lock your door and you hide your kid, okay?
- Just go home.
- Drive.
Hey. Can we talk?
I'm late for work.
Just for a minute.
It's about the murder.
Damn it!
What are you hiding?
Five.
Five, his mother is gonna be tried for murder.
What?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, what?
Yeah, I was there.
But not when he was killed.
I went back because I had to save my mom.
Stupid, I guess.
But she seemed happy to see me.
And then, a bunch of elders show up, and she turns to me with this, like, blissful smile.
And she says,
"You're gonna be brother Scott's newest wife."
Sarah.
Give me your hand.
You think that is gonna get you some of this?
Not a chance in hell, old man.
You're my father.
Not by blood, sweetheart.
Oh, boy, here he comes.
Mr. Holier Than Thou.
You did well.
Would you give us some privacy a moment?
You better be talking about how you're gonna let me go.
And give me some money, too.
Out of those welfare checks you steal from the government.
Or else I just might go to Channel 9 and spill my guts.
Sit down. Can I ask you something a second?
What?
Now, listen to me, you little slut.
If you don't marry brother Scott as I have ordained,
I'll kill your mother.
Not now, not next week.
But, you'll be afraid for the rest of your life,
'cause you'll know that one night,
I'm gonna knock at your door, and when you open it, you're gonna find your mama's head in a bag.
It's that simple.
I could hear them in the other room.
Making plans. And I just sort of, felt myself stand up, and go to the back door and run.
And the whole time, I just kept thinking,
"He's gonna do it.
"I'll be watching the news, and there'll be a dead body in the woods.
"And it'll be my fault for running away."
But I just...
I couldn't...
I couldn't stop.
Make your own dinner.
Though Brigham gave me a house,
I rarely saw him, as he continued to marry again, and again.
Though he was good to our son,
- I was at his mercy.
- Jacob.
As helpless as my mother.
How are you, young man?
Are you planning to move in, brother Brigham?
No, my dear.
Times are hard in desert.
Are they?
I hear little.
Yes, indeed.
Everyone will be forced to sacrifice.
I'm afraid I have to cut your allowance.
How much this time?
I can hardly make do on what you give me now, you know.
I struggle to put food on the table, and...
All.
I must cut it all.
How am I to get by?
Start a garden. Hire out your needle.
You dare stand there and tell me?
You, with half the gold in Zion.
Now, now, now, now, now. Let us not bicker.
Tell me this, then.
How much are you cutting your latest wife?
Did you take away her diamond pendant?
Lest you forget, my gold pays for this house!
And it would take but a gesture to see you out that door.
And if you continue to address me thus, you will bear witness to what occurs when
I truly lose my temper!
Good day to you, madam!
Hiram?
I don't want to fight.
And you know I have been a good saint all my life.
But I don't believe in plural marriage anymore.
Not just for us. For anyone.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
That's why I read the book.
To find out how Ann Eliza escaped it, because...
I look at Angela and I know that she's gonna face the same thing.
I will not let that happen.
And I know you won't, either.
But, there are only two of us.
And, maybe there's too many of them.
Hiram.
Maybe it's time to leave.
Great. Is he still pushing you to sign that?
I signed it.
Are you working for the Firsts?
I work for my clients, no one else.
You're scared.
The Prophet, he doesn't want a trial, right?
- Something to do with my father?
- Jordan.
What you don't know would fill the Grand Canyon, son.
Then tell me! Help me! I'm all ears!
I already helped you.
How on Earth could you help him?
I told BeckyLyn that if he continued to dig in the Prophet's business, he was bound for a bad end.
That's why you signed it?
That's the truth.
No, it's a lie.
Mom, look at me.
I'm fine.
It's time to let your mother go, son.
I'm sorry, but it's over.
It is not over.
There was a new number 19 that day, Mom.
It wasn't you.
I know I didn't do it.
I didn't believe you. Queenie did, but I didn't.
Thank you.
It is not too late. Just tear it up.
But then I would have to go to court.
Which we do not want.
- Yes, we do.
- We know the truth now.
And in the court, we can make sure that everybody knows.
You're innocent, Mom. Just tear it up.
To survive, I was forced to take in boarders.
Betrayed by my husband and trapped by my faith, I saw no way out.
I admire Brigham a good deal, but he's got to be careful with this marriage thing.
It's the children I worry about.
I have it on good authority that the number now exceeds 50.
Children?
Wives, my dear.
I am his 19th.
And has he left you alone in this?
There is family.
But my father has three wives.
My brother's fortune exists at the whim of Brigham, and...
It struck me right off there is a simple and legal solution to your dilemma.
Divorce him.
Hello?
I'm not giving up.
I'm not, either.
We're gonna win this, okay?
I know. I know we are.
- I'll see you soon.
- What?
I'm on my way.
No, Jordan, they're just...
Hello?
Jordan.
Got to make a joke, every time.
Worried maybe you were out again.
Think we could come in?
Whoa! Careful.
Sit down.
What do you got to say for yourself, sister?
I don't want Hiram to marry again.
I don't care that Jordan Scott's from the outside.
I believe BeckyLyn is innocent, and I intend to help her.
That it?
Yeah, that's it.
Isn't she something?
I always said Hiram was a lucky man.
Yeah.
Yeah. He is.
But I'll tell you what, sister.
That's not why I'm here.
Today I come to ask you something that might be a little more embarrassing.
You think you got the stomach for that?
Go ahead.
Well, all right, then.
Tell me, Queenie, you got a problem in the bedroom?
- No.
- Is it Hiram, then?
Does he have man troubles?
No.
He ain't using protection, is he?
If I find out he's using protection,
I'll be a mite upset.
We want more children.
Yeah? Well, I want a whole yard full of them.
Isn't that right? I want an army.
And you know why?
For the end time.
"The day is fixed, and the hour is set.
"The signs have been, are now, and will hereafter be shown forth."
And how will they be shown?
As a great war, between the righteous and the apostate.
And?
And for every soldier who falls,
100 must take his place.
One hundred.
Yeah.
And who shall provide?
Womanhood.
Womanhood.
For that is the purpose of a woman, is it not?
That is your... Your glory.
How does that make you feel?
He came through the woods.
Now, look at that poor, sweet sister there.
Now, I think I got her straightened out.
But you, you're like a disease among the flock.
And you just won't take a hint.
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
If you're still too brave or too stupid, yeah, too much in love with her to get the hell out,
I'm gonna kill her.
Not right away.
But someday, I'll knock on your door, and when you open it, you're gonna find Miss Queenie's head in a bag.
Okay?
See you later, sport.
Are you okay?
I want you to call Heber and tell him to tear up your plea agreement.
You're gonna tell him about the list, you're gonna tell him about how he took you off of it.
You're gonna tell him all the bad things that Dad did to you and to me.
And when the trial's over, they're gonna give you a medal.
I can't go to trial, Jordan.
Goodbye and good luck.
Jordan, Jordan, don't be cruel.
I'm not cruel, Mom, I'm just done.
No.
All right.
For as long as I can remember, your father fought with the Prophet.
Yes.
Because he felt that a horrible injustice had been done.
And that he should have been made prophet.
What?
Dear old dad.
More than anything,
I want to believe that our Prophet is infallible.
But, I know that no mortal man is infallible.
And my worst fear is that the Prophet did have something to do with your father's death.
But that I will never say.
And I will never, never tarnish the name of the Prophet.
So, you're gonna let Heber use the confession?
I am.
You know what, Ma, I had this idea that
I would get you out and we'd go back to LA.
And we'd live together.
On the beach.
You've never seen the ocean before.
You'd love it.
Cool air, blue water.
No Prophet.
Good luck, Mom.
I mean it.
What happened?
Promise me that you're not gonna do anything.
Promise me.
Promise!
All right.
We have to leave.
Leave what? Our home?
Our families?
- Our faith?
- Our faith.
Faith.
He came into our home, Hiram.
He can come anytime.
And he can do anything that he wants to us.
We have to leave.
No.
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.
You're still alive?
Can I talk to Queenie, please?
- Hello?
- Are you okay?
Yeah.
All right, well, I'm coming over to say goodbye.
Don't. And I don't want you to come here again.
What? Why?
You don't have to worry about me.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna head out of town, then.
Is Five with you?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm dropping her off at the bus station, on my way back home.
She's really looking forward to it.
I'll bet.
Yeah, yeah.
I love you.
I love you.
Goodbye, Jordan.
Oh, God, stop it.
Stop it!
I just want to use your phone!
You got voicemail.
- Do you want me to check it?
- Sure.
You scored. Someone called Desert Missy.
She says she has information about your father.
Let me have the phone.
I told you not to come. I said I'd handle it.
Now they're gonna know.
Well, they can go to hell.
I called your aunt Carol.
I don't even know my aunt Carol.
She said she can't wait to see you.
You blink a lot when you lie.
It's in a normal house in a normal neighborhood.
- Normal?
- Safe.
I think I should try and get my mom out again.
She doesn't want to get out.
Do you kiss little girls goodbye?
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Excuse me?
Desert Missy?
You brought one of them.
Yeah. You knew my father?
Yeah, well. He's a gambler. I'm a gambler.
Of course, we met on a Texas Hold 'Em website.
Got a little more interesting after that.
Wait, you're not one of the wives, are you?
- No.
- No.
He showed me pictures of them.
You met him in person?
Yeah, I met him in person.
Used to meet over in Mesquite, play the casino, and, well, you know.
Well, then, maybe you can tell me why a man who has 25 wives...
Maybe your daddy's tastes ran a little to the...
Twisted?
I'd like to call it "fun."
I don't think his wives were a real fun bunch.
And no offense, honey, but I can't picture that in the bedroom.
Shoot, we did have fun, though.
And I'm gonna miss him.
Okay, well, I am sorry for your loss.
Maybe since you knew him so well, you can tell me what this is.
Sure. Sure.
This is what he called a marriage...
Management book.
That's it.
Yeah. Well, do you understand the code?
Understand the code? I invented the code.
Okay.
His last day.
All right.
Three of a kind.
Means he was happy.
Shoot, that's good to know.
The Prophet, king of spades, makes sense.
Blessed him with the new wife. Typical.
He says here, ace of diamonds.
Means she was hot.
Anyway, he's made an adjustment here.
Wife number 19... Never mentioned names.
Replaced, he says, by queen of hearts.
Who do you think that is?
Hey.
I know.
You know what?
That I'm the 19th wife.
Hiram?
Hiram.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Hiram.
Hiram.
Hiram.
Five started it.
When she took off, all hell broke loose.
Promise made. Deal done.
And damn it if I'm not gonna hold you to it.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna shut it and sit down.
You're right. For once. The deal is done.
There's gonna be a wedding tomorrow, as planned.
But not to that little whore.
No. I'm gonna seal you to a worthy woman.
Queenie Alton.
See how the Lord works, Hiram?
You disrespect his prophet and you reap the whirlwind.
The wife he treasures above all else, the way only Gentiles treasure theirs, will be taken from him, as an example, let it be, to every believer.
And you are to tell your wife not one word of this.
Tonight, you are to take her to brother Scott, as ordained so he can give her the joyous news.
It's open!
- Where's Queenie?
- She won't be long.
Then BeckyLyn was right.
She was so afraid that the Prophet did it.
The Prophet didn't.
He did it, Hiram.
In a way that people like him always do.
From a distance.
- Safe.
- No, Queenie.
I did it.
All by myself.
Because I could never let you go.
Were you ever gonna tell my mother, or were you just gonna let her sit there and rot?
Unbeliever!
There were few secrets in Salt Lake City.
The news of my divorce from Brigham soon burst forth like an explosion.
- This is intolerable.
- No.
- We need the air.
- Harlot!
Jacob! Jacob.
Upstairs.
Stand, damn you. Cowards.
In the end, there was no choice.
Should something befall me, so be it.
But what would become of my child?
It was a terrible vision, my son living the saint's life, greedily acquiring women.
There was no reason to think he would be any different from my father, brother, husband.
Unless we left the kingdom, his fate was sealed as was mine.
How are you?
I'm not sorry I killed Scott.
I am sorry that BeckyLyn went to jail for it.
Would you have said something?
You didn't answer Jordan.
I don't know.
It would've meant losing you.
You have lost me.
You're my husband.
And I will never have another.
And, Angela will always know that you're her father.
I promise you that.
You remember that book?
The one from the outside?
Yeah.
In the end Ann Eliza escaped.
She left her home and everything that she believed in.
To save herself, Hiram.
That's what we should have done.
Years ago.
And that's what I'm gonna do now.
With Jordan's help.
You take Angela and you get her as far away as you can.
Don't come back. It will never be safe for you here.
I'll be back.
I'll be back for your trial.
I'm gonna take the stand, and I'm gonna tell them that you are a good man.
And that you did it for me.
Goodbye.
I love you.
Wow.
I feel naked.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be good.
Can I have the next model, please?
Come on, Mom! We want to welcome you to the new world.
You're gonna like it, I guarantee it.
It's not my world, Jordan.
It's just new.
No, it's too late.
You're afraid.
I already told you.
I believe.
It doesn't matter that men are weak.
It doesn't matter that the Prophet isn't perfect.
I believe.
And I always will.
But you...
Jordan, please.
Take me home.
Mom.
Jordan.
Let her go.
For the record, tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury your name.
Um, David Marks.
And where were you born?
Um, New York City.
Is your father still alive?
Yes sir.
Is your mother still alive?
No sir.
How old were you when your mother died?
Um, seven.
Were you present when she died?
Yes sir.
And how did she die?
She died a violent death.
David, if you don't mind,
I'm going to ask you some more about your past.
David?
I'm sorry?
Your past.
Yes, I'd like to make a collect call, please.
David Marks.
Dad, David.
Huh?
How am I gonna do that?
I got on the tuxedo.
Can't we just call a plumber?
Yeah right, why would we do that?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would you send a plumber to do a plumber's job, huh?
What are you looking at, huh?
Hi.
Oh. Hi.
Um...
I've forgotten why I'm here.
I was gonna make some coffee.
Excuse me?
Do you want coffee?
I was gonna make some.
No thank you.
Am I keeping you from something?
Yeah.
But it's something
I'm dreading.
Hey, do you have some kind of...
I don't know, something
I could put under here?
Uh, yeah.
Here.
So how long ago did you move in?
- On Sunday.
- Oh.
- From where?
- Long Island.
- Oh.
- My mom's house.
- Are you done?
- I think I should stop.
You know?
I mean...
I'm not a plumber.
I mean, as you might have guessed.
And I can't get a plumber in here until Monday.
So, uh...
I guess what I've done is, uh...
Do you want help with that?
Yeah.
Uh, anyway, so I guess what I did was come out here to tell you that you have a leak and, uh, that you should get it fixed.
You smell good.
You're gonna be late.
So?
I'm always late.
You could always blame me.
Hi, David Marks.
Sir, right this way.
- Oh God.
- Oh look, there.
- Here, take this.
- Go easy on him.
Okay, I don't have to tell you... just ignore him and I apologize for anything he says between now and the time we leave.
Late.
Always late.
Anybody who didn't know you would think you were a busy man.
Oh, I see you brought a friend.
- Katie.
- Katie.
Your full name, dear, always.
Oh, Katherine McCarthy.
Well, what a lovely young woman you are.
You've even managed to make my vagabond son look handsome.
He is handsome.
David, I need you to meet the next senator from New York.
And I didn't invite you here to help you get laid.
- Ambassador Moynihan.
- Sanford, congratulations.
- Thank you. Welcome back.
- Thank you.
Liz. Always more gracious.
Ambassador, you remember my eldest son David?
David the heir apparent.
Of course, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- Oh, and this is...
- Katherine McCarthy.
- Miss McCarthy.
- My wife Elizabeth.
- Ambassador.
- Ah, the man himself. Thank you.
- Here you go, Dad.
Thanks, Daniel.
Hey, shouldn't you be wearing white gloves?
Screw you, David.
- Is that Irish?
- Excuse me?
Moynihan, is that an Irish name?
Gaelic. Originally
Scottish-Gaelic.
But my family...
My friends, a man who's old enough to remember how 42nd Street used to be...
Sanford Marks!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
My father had a vision for Times Square and he passed it on to me.
Where there are peep shows and massage parlors,
I see Broadway theaters restored to their former glory.
And where there are dilapidated hotels,
I see gleaming office towers bustling with the important business of this city.
It's my hope I can help breathe life back into this neighborhood that was so dear to my father, a man who placed great trust in me to carry on his legacy.
To Howard Marks.
David, tell me about the family business.
Has the Marks Organization always been a powerful entity in New York?
We were always in the top five or six property owners in Manhattan.
Was it work that you were interested in?
Um... no sir.
- A health food store?
- Silly, right?
No, I...
I think that's great.
- Really?
- Yeah. Where?
I was thinking in Vermont maybe.
What do you do?
I want to go to medical school, but since my dad died...
It funny how hard it is just to do what you want, huh?
- Yeah.
- I bet you could do anything.
#Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains #
# And the waving wheat #
# Can sure smell sweet #
# When the wind comes... right behind the plains! #
# Then when we say-yyy #
# Hey, a-yip-i-o-ee-ay! #
# We're only singing #
# You're doing fine,
Oklahoma... #
Did your father approve of you living with
Katherine McCarthy?
Well, he didn't really have a problem with that, but he wanted me to live in New York and to go into the family business.
Thank you.
What did you do instead?
Katie and I moved to Vermont.
We lived this sort of a back-to-the-land kind of lifestyle.
We bought a small piece of land and we ran a health food store.
It's perfect.
She's certainly a very enthusiastic young woman.
- Where did you find her?
- 53rd Street.
She had a leaky faucet.
Ah yes, the famous leaky faucet of 53rd Street.
Aren't you sorry you gave up a promising career
- in real estate?
- No.
You're ignoring a very hard fact of life, David.
What's that?
- She's never gonna be one of us.
- No, I know.
Isn't that great?
Don't forget your racquet.
...a million miles away.
It's just like picking off another part of your forehead.
I'll burn you.
Just you.
The rest of you, you're fine, but that part,
- forget it.
- David?
You're talking to yourself.
David, I hope you brought an appetite!
The ham looks delicious, Mom.
...you squeeze one time and you get ketchup and mustard,
I call it Kepustard.
Kepustard!
Katie, your brother's going to be a millionaire.
- Pass that ham down.
- David, what does your family usually do for the holidays?
We're going... ahem.
We're going skiing.
Oh, skiing!
I'm gonna teach David how to ski.
I'd be scared too.
- You look terrific.
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she look terrific?
- She's a beautiful girl.
The Marks family.
Marks.
Are you kidding?
They own half of Times Square.
Can we please not talk about this now?
Which half of Times Square?
What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying.
- He's taking her to Paris.
- That's what she said.
- Hey!
Whatever happened to my trip to Paris?
You'd be lucky to get a trip to Paris, New Jersey.
Mom's making coffee.
- What?
- Why are you hiding?
I'm not.
Is it awful?
Awful?
Is it awful?
No, it's not awful at all.
It's just different, that's all.
It's just very different.
You know, everybody talks to each other and there's a ham with pineapples on it with little cherries in the middle.
- Cherries, I like those cherries.
- Yeah, I like them too.
It's just really different.
Will you marry me?
What?
Was that a yes?
- Thank you.
- This was nice.
Yeah.
We just wanted to do it, to make it official.
It's $39.50 each.
That includes a generous tip.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
So the guy's not selling and his kids are starving.
And he's sitting on the world's most valuable butcher shop.
But my dad wouldn't give up.
He used to say
"There's always a way to convince a holdout."
You know?
I came around.
Sooner or later everybody does.
Oh, David.
- Look who's here.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
Your grandfather didn't come hat in hand to ask me to join the firm.
It was understood.
I understood it.
Your brother understands it and you do too.
We're happy here, okay?
- I'm subsidizing that.
- Yeah, only until we get settled.
Settled?
You think she's happy here?
- Isn't she?
- You think she had this dump in mind when she left Mineola?
When she laid eyes on you?
No, she had more in mind and she deserves better.
She's a beautiful woman.
Just like your mother.
- Thanks for visiting.
- Thank you, honey.
I'd better get back to work.
How do you think my son can afford to live like this?
What?
Take me to the airport.
Best of luck. Do you have a place picked out in New York yet?
No.
Then why did you sell it?
I guess I thought it was what I should do.
And I went along with my father's wishes and I agreed to go into the family business.
Some of our Times Square tenants pay their rent in cash, so you'll pick it up in person.
Solly, give him the address of the Luxor.
Sure.
When you get down there, you'll see why I'm sending you.
These people are not really corporate.
But these properties need to pay for themselves.
That is, until we tear 'em down.
And ultimately
I think maybe you can manage the whole area.
Well, it's good to have you here, son.
You keep Solly in the loop, huh?
Explain to the jury, please, what the family business consisted of.
My grandfather owned land in Midtown which was, once upon a time, a farm.
And as the area developed, we built apartments and office buildings and whatever was appropriate for the time.
Here!
What did you do for the Marks Organization?
Um, some leasing, but mostly you know, bookkeeping.
I followed the kid all night.
Massage parlors, peep shows, porn theaters.
All people see are the fancy office towers.
But Marks owns some of the worst buildings in Times Square.
- He's the problem.
- What do you want from me?
We need to take the offensive, Mr. Mayor.
- Let me use the police.
- Relax, Sidney.
We'll get what we want.
Remember, we're just the custodians.
This guy owns the place.
Ow.
- My eyes are closed.
- Close your eyes.
- My eyes are closed.
- I swear to God, if I'm going to be a captain of industry, we might as well enjoy the perks.
- You're looking.
- No I'm not.
Okay.
- Do you want to count it down?
- You do it.
- Five...
- Mm-hmm.
...four, three, two, one.
Open them.
Oh.
Ohh.
Oh my gosh.
You like it up there or you want to come down?
- I want to come down.
- Come on down.
Hi.
It's gonna be so beautiful here.
Do you ever think about having kids?
Come on.
Don't you want a little David running around the house?
Pulling at your toes in the morning?
Smushing food in your hair?
Are you saying no?
Can't we just talk more about the apartment and, you know, whether this is going to be a dining room or a living room?
Or... you know?
Are you saying "not now" about kids or not ever?
Not ever.
David... is there something wrong with you?
Yeah.
There is something wrong with me.
Are you saying no?
David?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
David, did you ever have any kind of psychiatric treatment?
Well, after my mother died,
I was sent to psychiatrists.
A lot of them, actually.
I didn't find them very helpful.
Was there anyone in your life with whom you did talk openly about your past?
David, you cocksucker!
Get over here and give me a hug.
# Boogie! #
# Get down, boogie oogie oogie... #
- How are you?
- # Get down #
# Boogie oogie oogie #
# Get down #
- # Boogie oogie oogie... #
- Look at her.
I swear to God,
I had no idea that people like her even existed.
She's perfect.
What do you mean by perfect?
I mean there's nothing that
I do that she doesn't like.
She hasn't known you long enough.
It must be so exciting, having your first book published?
You know, I was thinking of taking some classes.
- Maybe premed.
- How's, uh... how's David doing working for his dad?
Oh, he doesn't say or he just says "Okay."
Well, that's him.
It's like... like when he lost his mother.
- When did she pass away?
- Pass away?
She jumped off the roof, cracked her skull open like a walnut on the driveway.
David saw the whole thing.
He hid under a table for a week.
When he came out, it was... it was like he never had one.
One what?
A mother.
And... and that was it.
Excuse me, Katie.
Smile.
She's very sweet.
- Unbelievable.
- What?
You're the only person I know that can say "sweet" like you're cursing.
I did... sweet is a great thing.
- I wish I was sweet.
- Yeah, I wish you were sweet too.
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you say to her?
Nothing.
I didn't say anything to her.
- We were just talking. I just met her.
- Nothing? Mm-hmm.
Anyway.
I've missed you.
Quit it! I'm being sweet.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
You surprised me a little.
You're married to a nice blonde shiksa?
Well, I wouldn't put it like that.
You're working for... you're working for your dad, David?
Which you said you'd never do.
- When's the baby shower?
- Come on.
You know, it's still me.
Does that girl know how fucked up you are?
No, we're gonna... we're gonna straighten you out, David.
We are.
I know a great therapist and you're gonna love her because... because she does house calls.
Try to focus on your breathing.
It's not so much the memory, but the feeling... the feeling the memory evokes.
Okay okay?
- Again?
- Yeah.
Shit.
Jesus.
How did you and Katie feel about your new life in the city?
Well, New York commercial real estate is very, you know, it's button-down and white shoe, and I really wasn't set up for that.
But Katie seemed to like the city and she'd fixed up the apartment and... and eventually we even ended up buying a weekend place on a lake in Westchester.
Am I... am I overdressed?
You look beautiful.
Oh! This place must have cost a pretty penny.
Do you think all of these people drove up from the city?
# In the morning you go gunning #
# For the man who stole your water... #
Hey, we're looking for Katie.
Oh, my brother's here.
Come on.
- Katie.
- Hi.
# And the mourners are all silent... #
Oh my God, disco people.
Honey, babe...
# But the hangman isn't hanging... #
You know, I really think it's quite unique.
Of course I'd love to pick your brain
- about the business plan.
- # Go back, Jack, do it again... #
Get up.
Dance with me.
# Wheel turnin' round and round #
# You go back... #
Thank you for inviting us.
It's nice to finally meet the neighbors.
Can I touch your belly?
Sure.
It's moving.
She's moving.
- How do you know?
- I just do.
Before we walked over,
Barry tried on every shirt he owns.
We don't get out much.
Most of these people are David's friends.
I don't even think he knows half of them.
Oh, I thought they were your friends.
Some of them.
I guess it's just the way people act around you.
They sort of favor you.
Maybe because I'm pregnant.
Are you?!
You're the first person
I've told.
That's wonderful!
How far along are you?
I just found out.
Um, I don't know how it happened.
It wasn't planned.
- That's not what I said.
- You said that you couldn't,
- that it wasn't possible.
- That's not what I said.
That there was something wrong with you.
I didn't say that.
- Yes you did.
- What's the difference?
All the difference in the world.
Look, um, we've got an apartment in Manhattan.
We got a house in the country.
- We got a Mercedes.
- I don't care about all of that.
- You don't care...
- I care about you, David.
I want to have your child. David!
Okay, if you don't care, we'll just go back to Vermont.
Fine, we'll go back to Vermont, fine.
We'll do whatever you want to do.
Please, David.
It won't be like when you grew up.
What do you know about it?
I'm not blind.
David?
Look at me.
You make me out to be this person that you... think that I am.
But I'm not that person.
You can ask me anything you want.
Anything, anything.
Anything and I'll do it.
Just don't ask me this.
I can't do this.
Are you ready?
Uh, I gotta make a stop.
On the way.
What are we doing here?
What is this place?
I gotta make a call.
I'm at the Luxor and there's cops everywhere.
Listen to me, go over to the Avon.
They may be next.
No, you gotta find somebody else, okay?
I gotta take Katie somewhere.
What the hell are you talking about?
The mayor's not available.
David, get your ass over to the Avon and pick up the cash!
Jeez!
Uh... you go ahead and I'll be right behind you, okay?
I'll be there.
Mr. Marks?
Mrs. Marks?
I'm sorry, we'll have to get started.
David!
Hey, David, David.
Hey, if it isn't the happy couple.
They can't seat us for like an hour.
Do you mind, David?
Is that okay?
Uh, can we pull a chair over here, please? Is that okay? Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.
- My pleasure.
So I heard about all the excitement today.
Your old man must have had you running all over town.
Sit. I'll go.
I'll go, I'll go.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
That's just Todd.
He is completely unaware of anyone else around him.
Which just makes him an asshole.
Let's step into my office.
Come on, it'll cheer you up.
Have you done this before?
No.
You're just gonna snort it back fast, like this.
Trust me, whatever's on your mind now, it won't be.

The inventory issue is likely one time in nature.
However, piracy is an ongoing problem for Microsoft.
The most damaging...
In the next few years, how did things change?
We began sort of living separate lives.
Katie lived at our lake house.
She was going to college near there.
So it made sense,
I guess, and...
I was still working in the city, so that kept me busy.
Did you even tell him you applied to medical school?
- Not yet.
- You have to tell him.
I know, I... it's because of school, you know.
I'm here during the week and we only see each other on the weekends.
Yeah well, he's gonna find out anyway, because you're gonna get in.
David?
What are you doing?
It was drifting away.
I don't want anybody to steal it.
Oh, David.
Hi, you've reached David and Katie.
Leave a message.
Hi, it's me.
I don't know what time it is.
It's late.
It's so quiet here.
The smallest sounds are keeping me up.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I miss you and I wanted to hear your voice.
I hope you're still coming tomorrow.
It would mean a lot to me.
Harriet, just say it.
You can enjoy smoking, all right?
No, 'cause you called me.
My little sister's going to go to medical school.
Can you believe this?
Congratulations, David.
You must be so proud.
- Where is the campus?
- It's in the Bronx. It's in the city.
And it has one of the best pediatric programs in the country.
Jim, I always thought you would become the doctor.
Thank you, Ma. That's nice.
I feel much better about my life.
I'm kidding.
That's real nice, Mom.
It's all right, Jim.
Um, I can't find your jacket.
Do you know where you put it?
Oh, you're not leaving?
- No.
- Yes.
- I gotta drive...
- Sit down, David.
Come on, what are you drinking?
I gotta drive all the way back to the city. So, Katie?
Uh... what? I... I...
I'm not going anywhere.
Jim, Jim, sit down.
- I'm just... I'll go start the car.
- Do whatever you want.
I'm not...
I'm not leaving yet.
What?
What is so important that we have to rush home for?
What, David?
I'll be waiting in the car.
"What's so important that we have to rush home for?"
# That's the way I've always heard it should be #
# You want to marry me... #
Where are you going?
Where you going to go?
Where you going to live?
'Cause if you leave me,
I'm not going to be able to subsidize your lifestyle.
Which I don't think that you want.
I don't want that.
Look, can we just... think about this for a second?
I've never been closer to anyone and I don't know you at all.
Maybe I should go stay at my mom's until I sort things out.
You're joking, right?
Why would you give up everything you've done just because of him?
And you're not leaving
New York to move back to...
Long Island... yuck.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
Your card was declined.
What? I...
- Try it again.
- Well, I already did.
- Um...
- I don't understand.
- Um...
- Do you have another card, or cash?
It's only $22.75.
- I know how much it is.
- Here.
What the hell are you looking at?
Eat your salad.
I just need enough money to get through school.
Look, I'm trying to explain.
Your husband is the beneficiary of a number of family trusts, most of which were set up a long time ago.
I know that.
That means that as long as you're married, you can have access to his money, but if you separate, if you divorce him, you won't get any money, because he doesn't have any.
Not of his own.
- Motherfuckers.
- Regardless, families like the Marks set their assets up this way
- to protect them from divorces.
- Motherfuckers!
Okay, could you just not... just not do that?
These people play hardball.
If you want a settlement, you're gonna have to think of a way to motivate them.
How was your day?
Good.
I... had lunch with Lauren today.
What else did you do today?
What the hell is that?
Someone's on the terrace.
Call the police.
Oh God.
Jesus, Jesus.
What happened?
What the hell happened?
- Kel, call the police.
- No no.
No!
No no no. No no no...
Shh-shh, okay.
David.
Katie's next door with us.
- She's scared to come home.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, we had a fight.
But it's nothing, you know?
It's nothing.
I mean, it's not nothing, but you can tell her to come home. It's over.
Will you tell her to come home, please?
Actually I think she should stay with us tonight.
Just let things cool off between you.
Thank you.
Good night.
Thank you.
- Hi, Lula.
- Hello, Mrs. Marks.
- Um, is David in?
- No, he's upstairs with his brother.
Okay, I'll be in his office.
I'm just gonna make some calls.
At the tone, the time will be 11.59...
At the tone, the time will be 11.59 and 20 seconds.
At the tone, the time will be
11.59 and 40 seconds.
I'm going to lunch now, Mrs. Marks.
Okay, Lula.
Thanks.
At the tone, the time will be
...12.10 and 40 seconds.
Good evening,
Mrs. Marks.
- Send it back.
- Excuse me, sir?
It's a family matter.
It has nothing to do with us.
It's not just that you barely show up for work or that you can't control your home situation, when you are here, you're stoned most of the time.
This is untenable.
There's an office on three.
It's out of the way.
No one will bother you.
You won't have to bother with anything.
You keep your secretary, get your mail...
I don't know what else to say.
Dad?
Why couldn't you just have given her what she wanted?
You're a very weak man, David.
Did there come a time when your father passed on control of the Marks Organization?
Not to you, but to your younger brother?
Oh yeah, that's correct.
When that happened, how did you feel?
I was glad.
Oh my God, Katie.
- I'm sorry.
- No no, you said you weren't coming.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I... I don't know.
No. Is Mom home?
No, she's still in Florida.
Oh!
I couldn't resist.
He... died when I was 16.
Uh, I don't remember much.
10 years!
How did that happen, you know?
And he does love me.
But I have to look out for me now.
I have my whole life to live.
My father used to say
"We should never regret the things we do, only the things we don't do."
But...
I had... I had an abortion.
And I don't know what that is.
If it's something I did, or something I didn't do.
Hello?
David?
Katie?
Katie, don't cry.
Don't cry.
You have to let me go.
This is killing me.
Oh, I know, I know.
I know that now.
Just come home.
I can make this better,
I promise.
Baby, just come home. Please.
Please.
Katie?
Katie?
What are you looking at?
Katie? Hey, Katie, where are you going?
I'm going home.
I'll call you in the morning.
You can't drive like this.
You've been drinking.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey.
What are you doing?
You hungry?
Where's Ivan?
Um... the kennel.
Oh, why?
You know he hates it there.
Yeah, I know, but he bit me.
Here.
I'm cold.
What is it?
You would have made a good mother.
So what am I doing here?
She must have hated you.
Your mother was a very sick woman, David.
She wasn't always like that though.
She was happy.
I did everything I could for her, just like I did for you.
Y-you... you let me, uh... stay out there and watch her jump.
I told the nanny to take you inside.
That's not true.
You left me out there to watch.
I saw her there, you know?
On the driveway.
I thought she was sleeping so I tried to wake her up.
- I touched her head...
- This is morbid.
Give me that.
How come you didn't just pick me up, Dad?
How come you just didn't take me inside?
I thought if she saw you standing there... she wouldn't jump.
I'm going to bed.
Go home to your wife.
She's gone.
What are you talking about?
Now I'm just like you.
David!
Something happened in 1982 that kinda turned your world upside down.
David!
Yes sir.
We, uh... we went to the lake for the weekend and I put her on the train to go back into the city that evening and that was the last time
I ever saw her.
But according to statements made to the police at the time she was in fact seen later that night at your apartment in the city.
Miss Katie.
Yes sir.
Your doorman said he saw her the next morning, making a phone call and getting into a taxicab.
Is that correct?
Uh, yeah, that's correct.
So at the time there was a substantial investigation into Katie's disappearance.
Yes sir.
And were you ever considered a suspect?
No.
As you know, Katherine Marks has been missing now for five days.
David, her husband, is very distraught.
And so he's asked that I speak to you on his behalf.
Now the Marks family is offering a $15,000 reward for any information that leads to the discovery of Katie's whereabouts.
I'm sorry, but, uh, for the moment that's all I'm able to tell you. Thank you.
Thank you. There'll be no more questions at this time.
- Can we just get a phone number?
- Thank you.
Please, can you just respect the family's need for privacy at this very very difficult time?
We'll keep you up to date if anything new comes along.
Where are we going next?
Uh, we haven't covered
West End below 70th.
We can start again early in the morning.
Yeah.
It's all right.
So, David, I want to get you now to the year 2000.
Um, if I could have some water?
Right away.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Due to new evidence and a close look at the case,
I've decided to reopen the investigation into the disappearance of Katherine Marks.
Katherine disappeared in 1982, almost 20 years ago and she remains a missing person to this day.
Now there are plenty of people who thought they got away with crimes that we're now finding can be solved based on DNA and other forensic evidence.
And I'm sure that puts a lot of people on edge right now.
I'll take your questions.
Well, what did you believe was going on?
Well, it was clear to me that the district attorney was reopening the investigation to further her political career.
There wasn't anybody who didn't know about it.
You couldn't walk down the street, you couldn't walk past the newspaper stand.
It was just, you know, everywhere.
What did you do then?
I... intended to fill up my car with clothing and linen and go somewhere and hide and disguise myself.
It seemed to me that the problem was being David Marks... so I just wanted not to be
David Marks anymore.
Hey!
Do you mind?
Can you just hold it down a little bit?
You know, it's just very abrasive on my ears.
And you don't have to let the door slam like that.
You know, I just need a little consideration.
What?
So now you're living in Galveston, Texas, and you meet Malvern Bump for the first time.
Did you pretend to be mute?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah well, just be sure and turn the hall light off when you're coming and leaving,
'cause it's on my meter.
Do you think
Malvern believed you were a mute?
I doubt it.
Do you think he believed you were a woman?
Probably not.
18 years ago this lakeside cottage was a weekend retreat for New York real estate heir
David Marks and his wife Katherine, a beautiful young medical student.
Now according to Westchester County
District Attorney Janice Rizzo, it is being considered a possible crime scene.
Earlier today, in an exhaustive search, cadaver dogs uncovered a body.
Unfortunately for hopeful investigators, it was just the remains of a dead dog.
Sources inside the DA's office say that Rizzo's interest in the case was triggered by an unpublished manuscript written by this woman,
Deborah Lehrman.
Lehrman's novel apparently describes a murder, the details of which are strikingly similar...
...to those surrounding the disappearance of Katie Marks in 1982.
Investigators are also interested in talking to David Marks, but at the moment, no one seems to be able to find him.
Reporting live...
Leave a message.
David, it's Deborah.
I can't believe this is happening again.
I don't know how people get my number.
First it was this... it was this reporter and now a cop's calling from New York every five minutes.
And I want to be there for you, David, uh, I do, but, uh...
I have my own problems now.
Fuck...
I had an accident.
It's nothing serious, but my car needs... it needs some repairs.
As you know, life in Los Angeles without one is impossible.
Come on, let's go.
- And uh...
- Lulu, let's go. Oh fuck!
- Shit. Come on.
- I hate myself for asking, but...
I need more money.
Come on!
I don't know if this is record...
Leave a message.
David, why are you avoiding me?
I've always been there for you.
I've been a good... a good friend to you.
Don't you fucking...
Who says I'm bothering 'em?
I pay my rent like everybody else.
You've got
30 days, Malvern!
I pay you! I pay good money for this shithole!
Get away.
I got rights here.
What rights?
You got 30 days to get out, Malvern.
You're lucky I don't call the cops.
- Where am I gonna go?
- Whatever.
You got 30 days, Malvern.
And stop turning off the goddamn light.
It's on my meter.
What sort of relationship developed between you and Malvern?
We became good friends.
Where the hell did you learn to shoot like that?
- The Purple Heart...
- I swear to God.
...for a sunburn.
And then we spent the entire war shooting coconuts off the side of the boat.
Why do you wear all that shit for anyway?
What?
The girl stuff.
You like that kind of thing?
No.
I guess...
I just kinda want to disappear for a little while.
What about you?
Is that why you came out here?
Yeah.
Me, I...
I disappeared a long time ago.
Oh.
You know,
I'm not always home and I know how you like to watch television.
So...
You seem like someone
I can trust.
You know, I may need you to do something for me one day.
Thanks.
In the days and weeks to come, did Malvern become aware that you had a lot of money?
I mean, he became aware that I was planning on buying a house.
What effect did you see that have on Malvern?
Uh... well, Malvern had a problem.
He was getting evicted and I guess he thought
I was gonna be the solution.
I can remember looking at houses together, and, you know, he was saying things like,
"Well, this would be a good place for you to buy because there'd be room for me over there."
Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.
This place might be good for us, Malvern.
Leave a message.
David, I need to see you.
You need to come out here.
If I don't hear from you, I...
I'm gonna blow the lid off things.
You know what
I'm talking about.
David?
I know. David?
David!
You didn't give me time to clean up.
- Turn that down.
- Eclipse the 400,000 watermark
...to 411,000 last week...
- Cocksucker.
David, you're gonna go deaf.
Leave a message.
David, are you there?
Everything is taken care of.
You told me to call, so...
I'm calling.
I just need something to eat.
I haven't had anything to eat and there's no food here.
So I thought, well, maybe I'd stop on the way back and...
Hello, yes, my friend and I came to your open house a few weeks ago, uh, for unit 107.
Deborah Lehrman wasn't just killed, it was an execution.
Her death is a very questionable death, Michelle.
Not just in terms of the fact that it was a homicide, but the timing is extremely curious.
Curious because
Deborah Lehrman was murdered just before District Attorney
Janice Rizzo had intended to question her about another mystery... the disappearance
20 years earlier of a beautiful young medical student named Katherine...
Okay, you have the "Post" interview, Marks, then a phoner with W.I.N.S. also about the Marks case, which we can do from the car.
We got a call from Albany.
They want you to do that meeting tonight.
- Got the numbers I asked for?
- Yeah.
They've been very generous to the governor.
Totals are in the last column.
These are all from the Marks family?
I'll have to change.
Leave a message.
David?
Come on, David.
I know what's going on.
I talked to the broker.
She said you... she says you never even made an offer.
I trusted you.
We had a deal.
Pick up the fucking phone!
- Hello.
- Mr. Sachs.
- Solly. Good to see you.
- You too.
- Pl-please.
- Yes.
Oh.
- No no, don't get up.
- Thank you for coming.
My pleasure.
Now what can I do for you?
Some things have been happening that have been quite uncomfortable for my family.
You want the ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.
So, David, on the night in question you came home and found
Malvern had been evicted.
Uh, yes.
Explain to the jury, please, what happened then.
...that pays attention to my orders?
Engine room reports number one switchboard shorted out by saltwater.
Shifted to number two.
Can't do much better heading into the wind.
I trusted you!
Fleet course is 1800.
Captain, we're in serious trouble.
Mr. Marik, if you question my decisions once more,
I'll order you off this bridge.
You're not giving orders on this bridge anymore. I've relieved you...
Mr. Marik, you're under arrest...
So Malvern came at you with a gun?
That's correct.
He, uh, had been evicted and he was desperate.
He demanded that I take him in.
And I just wasn't gonna do that.
Uh, there was a struggle and then the gun went off.
All right then.
If Malvern's death was a matter of self-defense, why didn't you call the police?
Because I knew that no one would believe me.
I just knew that no one would believe that it was an accident.
So I had to get rid of the body.
So no one would believe you because of your past?
- I'm sorry?
- Your past.
Now let's clear that up.
Set the record straight.
Did you kill your best friend
Deborah Lehrman?
Um...
David, you're gonna go deaf.
No.
Can you think of any connection between the death of Deborah Lehrman and the disappearance of your wife Katie Marks?
No sir.
David, is there anything you would like to add?
David!
Anything else, David?
No.
Thank you, David.
I have no more questions.
I miss her so much.

In a village in the heart of England, we're tracing the tale of one community through the whole of our history.
We've got something which is possibly prehistoric!
Yeah? Oh, we've lost it.
Oh...! No, don't say that!
The village is Kibworth in Leicestershire.
When we get into the post-Norman period, look how it changes.
Huge explosion of growth...
With science, history and archaeology, we're seeing how the story of the village is also the story of the nation.
This area of South Leicestershire is very radicalised politically.
"You're fighting for England", he says.
They were killed in the Abbey.
The high altar itself was splashed with blood.
To help us, we've got wonderful village archives.
This is what you've really come to see.
From the 13th century, we can tell the stories of individual peasant families over the generations.
Suddenly, with this, this village and its people come to life.
In the documents, everyday tales of medieval lives.
Emma Gilbert, villein.
Robert, the doctor.
Alice Star... Matilda Star...
BOTH: Sisters.
So how will the villagers cope with the horrors that lie ahead in the 14th century - the most catastrophic in our history?
That's the next chapter of the story.
In the next stage of our search,
I've come to ask the help of the children at Kibworth High School.
Imagine that... is the A6.
Yeah?
Now, the A6 is an ancient road, but it takes a modern little turn through Kibworth Harcourt, and the original village street goes something like this. Yeah?
'I'm asking the children to dig archaeological test pits
'to find out more about the village in the early 14th century.'
We're going to put our pits in the memorial garden, and... along there.
We've already dug 55 pits across the village, but we need to know more.
First of all we're going to take out all the plants and that...
So now we've targeted the area behind the medieval marketplace, and in the gardens behind two of the old farmhouses.
Like England as a whole, the village had a boom time up to 1300.
Hooray!
In 1300, Kibworth parish consisted of the hamlet of Smeeton Westerby, and the two main manors of Kibworth
Beauchamp and Kibworth Harcourt.
Maybe 1,000 people in all - free men and women, serfs, and villeins.
But the length of them is very impressive.
There's quite a lot of land in that back area there, which is obviously agricultural.
And maybe one housing plot here, possibly?
Mm. Or two?
What do you make of the house... any instant impressions there?
The way you analyse a building like this is to count the bays - the distance between the upright timbers.
So you've got one, two, three, four bays.
And each bay is roughly 15 feet long.
So by sort of 1600, it's a jolly nice farmer's house.
But back in 1300... maybe more than one family of villeins.
What would a villein have had on this plot?
Well, villeins are not very privileged people - they're unfree... so they have to go to the lord's court, and it's the lord's court which rules over their lives.
And in Kibworth Harcourt, they had
12 acres of land each, a holding of
12 acres of land. Beyond the village boundary, in the open field.
Both the Kibworths and Smeeton were open-field villages.
Each of the great fields was divided into many small strips, which were shared out and farmed communally by the peasants and their families.
To keep the fields fertile, the peasants carted out all the manure from their barns and yards, with whatever debris was mixed up in it.
So today we're searching for medieval rubbish.
Most of it gets here, because they have a midden, they have a muck heap in the yard behind the house.
They put every bit of rubbish onto it, and they'd all get shuffled onto a cart called a tumbril.
And then in the field you pull a lever and the stuff gets dumped onto the field, and along with half a tonne of manure you're spreading pieces of broken pottery.
Which we go to so much trouble picking it up again.
It was back-breaking work, but it was the way of life for our ancestors - men and women - for 800 years.
When you plot this stuff, you can see the scatters of Stamford Ware from the late Saxon period when these field systems are first laid out.
You can see the early medieval, the late medieval, and quite often the early post-med, the late post-med, depending on when it's enclosed.
What would you have seen, standing here in 1300?
100% cultivation, really.
A very boring landscape, really, because, you know, it's all brown in the autumn, it's all yellow in the summer...
It's very, very heavily cultivated.
How does Nicholas Pooley know that his strip is different from Walter Peaks', and...?
Well, at the end of the strip... imagining this hedge, which of course wasn't there then, there's a headland at the end of the strip... you would have some sort of marker, and it could be a wooden post, it could be a stone.
Later on the stone might even have an initial on it, you know...
P for Pooley or whatever.
I've recently discovered that in Yorkshire they had holes.
They were so mean in Yorkshire that they didn't have a post or a stone, they just dug a little hole.
And THAT marked the boundary.
And this way of life, hand-ploughing with animals, continued all over England well into the 20th century.
The open-field system was not only labour intensive... it took a huge amount of mental effort to memorise all the intimate detail of the fields and strips.
Most of that knowledge is lost now - but not at Kibworth.
Because back in 1300, the farmers of
Kibworth Harcourt gave every detail of their land and lives to the new landlords - Merton College, Oxford.
The field itself is East Field, it gives us in English Easte Feilde.
This is strip by strip, with the furlongs being named!
And the local jury writing this down as they see it.
I've got the later names of the field strips here in the East Field.
The Long Coombs furlong, Blackland furlong, Stonehill furlong...
Yes, and we have Stonehill here,
"Stonehull"...
Two strips. Two strips on Stonehill.
And of course, perfect name... it would remind you, it's the stony bit of land up the top of the field.
Long Hoe and Short Hoe, and Hearn Seek furlong.
Berridge Home furlong.
Sladewall...?
Sladewall.
Names and customs... the pattern of the landscape in the minds of the people, handed down for 1,000 years.
Broad Wan...
Down here, five strips.
That is just so fantastic.
Now, these strips of parchment have "Ex parte umbra" and "Ex parte solis"...
"On the shady side" and "on the sunny side".
That's the way the jury remember the strips.
Yeah.
By memorising the fields as the sun goes round like that...
So it is orientation.
So it's orientation.
Horse Hill.
That top part appears to be...
Research being done on camera, you see, this is the real thing!
Nobody's faking this.
In an agricultural community like medieval Kibworth, the most important man was the ploughman, and the most important animals were the oxen.
They bred them, cared for them, lived with them.
Walk on...
And in Weald and Downland
Open Air Museum, they're doing a fascinating piece of experimental archaeology... training young oxen ready to take the plough.
For the small, poor family, you couldn't have what you'd term as an oxen, a castrated male, standing round all year doing nothing.
So they worked the cows, the females.
You can have a calf, and you can milk it.
So it's a multi-purpose animal.
And if you only had one cow, your neighbour had a cow, you'd put the two together.
If another neighbour had a pony, then you could put the pony on the front, and have a three-team.
So they used everything they could.
Come on...
So do they know when they're being talked to, the individual...
They do. Yes.
Each pair has the same letter.
So these two are Rose and Ruby, and the ones behind us are Gwen and Graceful.
It's a single-syllable name near side, this side, and double-syllable off side.
I mean, the most we know recorded put together was 86.
86?! 86, yeah. And that was to move a windmill.
They moved a windmill from the centre of Brighton - I think it was Regency Square - and they moved it up onto the South Downs.
In the Middle Ages, the ploughmen are quite charismatic figures... famous ploughmen in their patchwork coats... and the fictional Piers Ploughman becomes a kind of English everyman, subject of a tide of popular song and social protest poetry through the 14th century, because - as the ballad-makers said...
"on his shoulders rested the mirth of all the land".
And "Godspeed well the plough" was not just a proverb, it was a heartfelt prayer.
I'll let you get on with it.
Thank you.
Rose! Come on, walk on.
Rose...
Rose, come on.
Now, if you were a freeman or woman, you ploughed your own fields, paid rent and sold your surplus after tax.
But if you were an unfree peasant - a villein, a cottar or a serf... you also owed your lord service, and that could be a real burden.
Whoa...
Survey of the Manor of Kibworth, its dues and services and customs.
So this is Merton recording the community pretty soon after they've got hold of it?
That's right. Obviously the college wants to know what its dues are, and to some extent what its liabilities are to the tenants.
"And here the dues..."
This is what peasants owed here.
And not just in money, but in services.
Two days ploughing each year without food, bringing your own plough!
Gathering straw together for roofing the buildings of the manor court, whenever needed.
Carrying the lord's corn to Leicester market on your own horse, but no further.
Unless it be within the county.
Carrying coal within the county - using your own cart!
Two days mowing the lord's meadow, with one man.
Two days harrowing and hoeing.
With food provided.
Reaping, four days.
The men of the village to mow the lord's meadow, with a gift of one shilling and sixpence in beer!
And on 1300 prices, that was enough to get you very drunk!
So from the 1270s, the Merton archive gives us the most incredible detail on Kibworth Harcourt.
We can trace everybody in the village from then until now, virtually, and do family trees of peasants for 15 generations.
But what about Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton Westerby?
Well, the missing gap is here in A Parish And County History
Of Leicestershire
Of The Antiquarian William Burton.
It's one of the earliest of the county histories and it contains our first historical accounts of the Kibworths and Smeeton.
Published in 1622, the same year, the same publisher and the same printer as Shakespeare's folio.
Of course, it's obsessed, as you'd expect, with manorial history, but what's really interesting about this is that Burton's notes survive and they're an altogether different matter.
Here they are.
They were written down in 1615,
"copied from the ancient original membranes by me, W Burton,
"15th July, 1615".
He excerpted the great rolls of the survey of 1279, the most detailed survey of England ever done before modern times.
They're lost now, but here, largely unpublished in his notebooks, are the first detailed accounts not only of Kibworth Harcourt, but Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton Westerby.
Starting with Smeeton, here, for the first time, are the names of families in the village, and some of them very long-lasting families in the village story.
The Aliens and the Astins - very long-lasting names in that part of Leicestershire and indeed in Kibworth.
When you turn to Beauchamp, though, nearly everybody unfree.
There's about 45 families of villeins and serfs.
1315, and it had two mills, one water and one wind.
Oh, did it?! Yes, how about that?!
But attached to it, 200 acres of land. So that must have been...
Yes, that piece down there, straight down.
All the way across to... To Smeeton.
Yes, it's always called the old house in the middle of the village.
And you had... You had, I'm sorry.
You had a communal bread oven out in the village street.
So, again, the villagers brought their corn to make bread.
A little cut of that went to the manor house.
Four free tenants, 24 villeins, each one with a cottage and 15 acres, and 80 serfs, who were the lowest level, kind of peasantry. Well.
So the Beauchamp half of Kibworth was still unfree, as it had been back in 1066.
That's how things stood in Kibworth at the height of the feudal system.
The population of the parish at well over 1,000 now as high as it would get until Victorian times.
This is contents two, yeah?
Yes, and this is the... Out of our...
Out of our pit.
On Main Street, the kids have not yet got down to the level of the medieval marketplace.
There are long bones and the ribs.
And, yeah... different things.
But for the field walkers, there were easy pickings from the once teeming medieval fields.
There's certainly stuff from the 13th, 14th century.
And in Cambridge, Carenza Lewis is collating the evidence from our earlier test pits, showing the growth of the village up to the boom time before 1300.
Here, the villages we can see today, seem to be taking off.
This is the point where we can see the villages we know today starting to have their direct origins.
Smeeton Westerby, again, the longest occupied village is clearly continuing to prosper.
The other significant place we've got is up here in Kibworth Harcourt.
You can see the village growing.
That is Kibworth Harcourt extending along the street there and pottery coming out of virtually every test pit.
Yes, and not much in Kibworth Beauchamp.
You know, there's an old village legend that, kind of, Harcourt is the posh, rather well to do end and Beauchamp is always the poor end.
But you wouldn't ever find that hinted at in the pottery, would you?
Well, that's what's so fascinating about this period.
You've got these two strands of evidence that we can use to sort of reflect off each other.
It is interesting, isn't it, that in the light of that knowledge, you can look at this map and think there's very much less here?
It's funny, isn't it, how history can leave its mark?
In Victorian times, the villagers even argued about separate sewage systems.
Harcourt and Beauchamp had different doors in the church and even separate parts of the graveyard.
This is the surviving windmill at Kibworth Harcourt.
They had two here and two over in Kibworth Beauchamp.
It's a post mill.
You turned it on its central post using this wooden tail to face the wind.
This was new technology that had spread over
England in the 13th century to feed the booming population.
There's more than 1,500 people.
But here in Kibworth, as across
England, the boom time was over.
There were too many mouths to feed, not enough jobs, too many poor people desperately struggling to survive on marginal land.
And around 1300, you get the first signs of recession... price rises, social unrest and even disturbing patterns in the weather.
But even in their worst imaginings, they couldn't have foreseen what lay ahead.
From the 1290s, the English summer went wrong.
And in a credulous age, omens and prophecies started to stack up.
It is foretold that great misfortunes lie ahead.
Earthquakes and wars, division of realms and peoples and a great and unheard of famine.
As climate change set in, the village braced itself.
The key person at village level was the reeve.
The reeve's job was to supervise the agricultural year in the village... the ploughing, the reaping and the sowing.
He chaired the village court, adjudicated on disputes and he submitted the accounts to the landlords, the Fellows of Merton College.
And the reeve in 1314 was a man called John Poli.
He was married with four kids,
Agnes, Hugh, Will and Rob.
He wasn't a rich man.
His father only held 7.5 acres, but he was a freeman, not a villein.
And it's in John's accounts that the first signs can be seen of the coming catastrophe.
In the Kibworth court rolls and in many others across England, we can watch as disaster strikes.
1314, January. There was severe cold.
One frost lasted more than two weeks.
Extra milk was needed for the lambs and oats for the horses.
Spring. April very cold.
A high mortality of doves.
Summer was cold with continual rain.
The roses were late this year.
Autumn, very wet followed by a sharp frost.
Ploughing was late. More oats were needed for the horses.
Winter. Snow cover for much of the time.
We fed the peas to the pigs.
A late winter this year.
It was wet and cold into the spring.
Extra hoeing.
The peas were flooded.
Summer was very wet.
Very low yields for barley and wheat.
Autumn, very wet.
Ploughing prolonged. Sheep rot.
Late spring.
Weather was wet.
More sheep rot.
Summer was exceptionally dry.
Ground rock-hard.
We had to purchase
12 measures of steel and 40 pieces of iron for the repair of ploughs.
Much more this year because of the dryness of the summer and the hardness of the fallow.
By 1315, the people found themselves in the worst famine in British and European history.
The harvest of 1315 was a disaster.
Poor tenants were forced to give up their holdings and sell off their gear.
People were dying everywhere.
Grain yields slumped and prices shot up.
While rich merchants bought up the surplus to make a profit, the peasants were thrown back on their knowledge of the countryside.
Your main meal would have been your pottage, your porray, whatever happened to be in season, even edible weeds.
Things like fat hen and borage and bitter cress.
We know about the medieval cottage garden from a minute excavation done of one peasant house - the kind lived in by Matilda and Alice Star.
Plot of vegetables and herbs would go right up to your cottage front?
Absolutely. You would cultivate as much as you possibly could, really.
Starvation was always a possibility and you would grow whatever you possibly could.
This is where your edible weeds came in - mallows, hyssop, mugwort, the artemisia vulgaris, the wild wormwood.
If your crops failed, at least you'd have something to put in the pottage.
If you were good at doing this, you could just about keep things together.
You may well be able to keep going.
You learn what's around in your local area.
So you know what's growing in your hedgerows and you know from past experience what's good to pick and what isn't.
You've got beer in there and, of course, you get lots of calories from that.
You've got all these greens, herbs from the hedgerows.
You've got things like Alexanders and fivers, flat-leaf parsley.
And, depending what year we're in, we'll get changes of those as well.
So they really knew how to exploit what was around them?
I think so. Yes.
It's very much a community effort, as well.
It's not just the family. It's everybody living in that rural area, you know, with the field strips, farming those strips, their animals.
People are living with their animals cos they're that precious.
You've got to make sure they're going to get through the winter.
The next year, 1316, things only got worse.
Across England, hundreds of thousands were now dying.
Northern Europe froze under a blanket of snow and ice.
What they didn't know was that they were in the middle of a little ice age.
And then came a new and disturbing development... the first signs of a virulent pestilence among animals, recorded by the Leicester chronicler, Henry Knighton.
In 1318 and 1319, there was an horrific mortality of humans and a pestilence of animals throughout the kingdom of England.
Conditions were so bad that the surviving people didn't have the wherewithal to cultivate or sow their lands.
Every day, they were burying as many as they could in improvised cemeteries everywhere.
And so a great ruin seized the English people.
There's a tiny detail from that time at the manor house in Kibworth Beauchamp, where the absentee landlord had let things fall to rack and ruin.
The jury say that the manor house itself is a total ruin and has been divided up into cottages worth five shillings a year, it says - they note it all these things in the Middle Ages - and let out to farm.
So it's a little, kind of, snapshot of that terrible winter coming on when they lost all their harvest with the rain in that autumn.
We nearly had a winter like that up here now.
It's been a horrible winter with a terrible lot of rain.
You imagine what that must have been like in a community where everybody in the village devoted their labour to making food.
Absolutely.
Grain prices in Leicester market during the famine had now shot up seven times to 44 shillings a quarter when you needed eight quarters to sow an acre.
As the famine got worse, the Merton court books are full of little details.
In the winter of 1314-15,
Nick Sybil died and the college took over the administration of his strips as his son was under-age.
Then, in 1315-16, the court book says,
"John Sybil, aged 14, inherited his father's lands
"and he sowed them with seven pence worth of oats,
"18 pence worth of wheat and four shillings worth of peas."
He was the breadwinner now.
So, with a widowed mother and younger siblings, young John was in trouble.
Harvest 1316 was another disaster, and to make things worse, there were signs of sickness in his most precious possession... his plough oxen.
Almost four million animals have been killed since...
Like the modern foot-and-mouth epidemic in Britain, the virus raged out of control, only this more virulent and more agonising.
There was also an unheard-of mortality among the cattle, the oxen, the cows and the calves.
It continued unabated for several years and everywhere the poor cattle seemed to be crying out to the people, looking at them and roaring as if they were in tears because of the terrible pain that gnawed at their insides.
And then suddenly they would fall down and die.
The news of such terrible suffering in the countryside caused great consternation here in Merton.
They saw immediately that it would be impossible to push the receipt of rents as it had been before the famine.
The Great Famine was remembered with bitterness.
The merchants still had profited.
The supplies had been there, which, had a supine government been motivated to move them with more alacrity, could perhaps have staved off disaster.
As the popular songs of the time said, there was one law for the rich and one for the poor, "For might is right and the land is lawless".
More than half a million people in
England died in the Great Famine,
10% of the population.
But peasant societies like medieval Kibworth are resilient.
For centuries, they'd lived with famine and disease.
And in the 1320s, they began to recover.
So much so that in 1327, the king raised a poll tax on all freeholders.
And in the National Archive, the returns survive for Kibworth.
But what do they call it in 1327, David?
Just K-Y-B-B-E-W-O-R-T-H,
Kybberworth.
This is for the 20th of 1327, so it's a twentieth of the value of everybody's chattels, which is basically your corn and your animals.
You had to have corn and animals worth ten shillings, which is in modern terms half a pound.
The minimum you would pay for the tax if you had ten shillings would be sixpence.
So that's six of these.
Let's have a look. Here is - wait for it - medieval money.
Oh, great. And these are all silver pennies from the mid-13th century.
This is the only currency.
So everything had to be paid in silver pennies.
Anything which is just pence -
18p, 14p, 12p... you're a peasant.
Whereas the top person, William Swan, has got four and six, that's 54 pennies, as against 12 pennies here.
He would be a major sort of freeholder.
So there are big class divisions and wealth divisions within Kibworth? Yeah.
Clearly here, even within what is a peasant society, there are big class divisions.
The really poor people aren't there.
So we don't know what the size of Kibworth was.
If you had a whole list of the names of the villagers, it might go on for ages with people below the line needed for taxation.
During this time, Leicester, nearby, began to draw many Kibworth people as craftsmen, drapers, ironmongers, joining guilds and bettering themselves.
Leicester was growing.
And of course, it was growing because people were coming in because they could make a better living.
This is actually a tax roll of people who were identified by their trade or where they come from.
You've got William of Kibworth,
Geoffrey of Osbiston or William of Lutterworth.
There are local places but also people from further afield.
There's someone from Carlisle,
I noticed earlier.
But they're not all men either.
There is Alissia de Kiborth here.
These are people who are living in Leicester? Yes.
Who were taxed in Leicester. Yes.
Could even be guild members in Leicester, perhaps. Yes.
But keeping their village name but working in trades here.
I suppose that's how they know.
"I'm talking about William".
"Which William?"
"Well, the William from Kibworth, that William".
There's only a limited number of Christian names, so you're beginning to see surnames coming in.
But cities can be dangerous places, especially for inexperienced country boys.
From the time of the famine, there's a cautionary tale involving a man from Kibworth.
"Contensio motar erat."
Yeah, punch-up. A punch-up.
This is a fight between Ivo, cleric of Great Stretton, and Henry Pollings, who's described as,
"Groom of Alice of Stretton".
But she's Alice of Stretton of Leicester.
She's one of those newcomers who come to the city but keep the name of their village as well. That's right.
So, a dispute broke out between
Ivo the clerk...
So, he's a lettered person, this guy.
And Henry Pollings,
Alice Streatham's groom, in a place called Parchmen Lane.
Parchmen Lane.
Yes. It was a little sort of lane that ran just inside the town walls.
In November of around the hour of Vespers, sort of 4, 6 o'clock, evening, anyway, it would be dusk.
25th November, darkness coming on?
Yes. Narrow lane.
Yes, just the place to have your...
Rumpus, isn't it, really?
I don't know what they were doing.
Now enters the Good Samaritan,
Philip the Young of Kibworth, son of one of Merton's free tenants.
And he's about to pay a heavy price for being a have-a-go hero.
It's almost like a citizen's arrest, isn't it? Yeah.
Gets hold of this chap and takes him towards the house of the aforesaid Alice.
Then, "Venit quia Johannes filius
Alani"... the mustard maker.
John, the son of Alan, the mustard maker.
The notorious mustard maker.
Yes. That's right. Great.
Out he comes.
All roads lead to Alice's house.
With a certain bow and shot the aforesaid Philip with a certain small arrow in the head between the eye and the nose, right up to the brain.
Very unpleasant, yes. Philip lived until the following Monday and then he died.
The coroner's language is almost like today, isn't it?
"The aforesaid John did the aforesaid in a westerly direction."
"A sword worth five shillings."
That's right. That's it. Before the bailiff, the inquiry was held.
Which said that no-one was suspected, except the aforesaid John, who had fled the scene after the deed. That's right.
And got away, presumably.
And John, the son of Alan the mustard maker, sounds a slightly nefarious character, do you think, Robin?
Well... He's a wanted man now.
He's a fugitive, an outlaw.
As for Philip's family, they must have wished he'd stayed on the family strips in the East Field, or that he'd come home early for Christmas.
Now, in the 14th century,
Christmas was the great holiday.
You got three weeks off from work in the fields from mid-December, to Plough Monday, after Twelfth Night.
That was the time when the ploughman and their boys carried the ploughshare around the houses of the village, with songs and dancing and received cakes and ale.
It's a tradition that survived till the 1930s in Kibworth.
It was a festive time for medieval villagers, when work was put aside and neighbours got together.
But at Christmas 1348, terrible rumours came down the road from London.
Nearby in Leicester,
Henry Knighton tells the tale.
"It started in India
"and then it moved across the face of the Earth,
"from Tartary, through the land of the Saracens,
"and into the lands of the Christians,
"a universal plague upon mankind.
"And on 25th June 1348, it landed at Weymouth."
Rats came from the ships... and they came from Weymouth, and spread their way north.
What caused it in particular?
What was it about the rats? Andrew.
The fleas on the rats had like a disease that was contagious.
That's very good. How did it begin?
Boils on your arm.
Boils. That's very good.
It's the bubonic plague that we're particularly looking at, and the pneumonic plague, as well.
Ever since, the Black Death has seized the European imagination.
The ultimate symbol of the powerlessness of humanity in the face of King Death.
In the winter of 1348, the plague reached London.
Just outside London Wall, close to the Barbican, tradition says that a huge death pit was opened here, under Charterhouse Square.
Under the grass are said to be 10,000 burials.
Recently, in London, the first Black Death cemetery to be scientifically excavated, has revealed close-up detail from 1348.
The gravediggers, too scared to take coins from the purses of the dead.
In Kibworth, they knew it was coming.
A two-pronged attack up the Bristol Channel and through the rivers of East Anglia, like malevolent monsters.
And at the point of their jaws,
Kibworth.
That Christmas, young Robert Church had gone down to Oxford to apply in person to the Fellows of
Merton for a holding in the village.
Perhaps he brought the plague back.
The first known death in the parish was in Kibworth Beecham early that spring.
Then, in the Merton court rolls, the full horror begins to unfold.
Right. It should be a fairly...
Striking...
Written on both sides as well.
So, the college, even in the catastrophe of the Black Death, they tried to keep the administration going.
The rhythm of life just continues and it's a way of coping, I suppose.
It's an incredibly human response in catastrophe, isn't it, to keep things ordered, I suppose.
Right, I think it...
Yes, we have it.
Post conquestum and 23.
23rd year of the reign of King Edward.
Edward III.
So, 1349.
Yes. The year of the Black Death.
And we know what time of year this was, do we?
It should even give us a day.
14th May. Cor!
These are the swearing in of new officers, a beadle... the new reeve.
Yes, names that we recognise. Polle.
William Polle.
John Haine. Yeah.
Administration was so immediate, it wasn't a bureaucracy that was delegated to a local authority as we have today.
You were the local authority.
If you weren't elected this year, you could be next year to be the constable or the, you know, looking after the pound, or whatever.
Meeting of the village court,
Kibworth Harcourt,
St George's Day, 1349.
John Church, reeve.
The following tenants died of the pestilence. Emma Cook,
Alice Arron,
John Church Senior,
Agnes Poli, Robert Poli,
Mr Haines, Mr Goodwin,
John and Constance Cybil.
Margaret Meister,
Richard Sylvester,
Nick Clarke,
Henry Harcourt and Matilda Harcourt.
Will Smith.
Alice Carter, Adam Kibworth,
Thomas Harcourt,
Rob Meister, Nick Poli,
Emma Wade, Agnes Allit.
John Hain, Will Milner.
And 1349 wasn't the end of it.
King Death came again to the village in 1361.
In 1375, 78, 89, and 95.
And a last cruel spasm in 1412.
The Poli family alone had seven male members dead.
The equivalent is the First World War, with a whole generation signing up and going off together and not coming back.
What have we got here?
The black ink is replacements?
Yes. And the browner writing has been crossed out and almost carated in is the new tenant.
Gosh, is that... is that a Poli up there as well?
Can you see?
In his notes, the reeve keeps up the impression of normality.
One of the customary tenants is one of the women.
Yes, this is Isabella Poli.
She's died. You'll see her name has been crossed through.
And somebody completely different, in fact,
I think it's Robert Smith.
It's not a member of her family, unless by marriage, but it's a completely, you know, it's an alien.
It's not passed from mother to son.
And the family couldn't take it over presumably because of their losses.
Possibly weren't enough sons to take over.
You dug out this sort of space here, about this area, isn't it?
You can still see bones coming through there.
There's lots of tiny, tiny little bones.
And I found a few tiny bits of pottery popping up as well.
Across Kibworth, many properties were abandoned at this time.
But the evidence around the medieval marketplace for what happened after the Black Death was thin to say the least.
I think it's plastic.
It's a bit disappointing, in terms of medieval activity.
But having this sort of negative evidence for the medieval period is good as well.
When you take this forward to the next period...
Wow.
Smeaton, which has been with us for so long seems to be absolutely devastated by it.
There's just two or three sites that have produced single sherds of pottery.
That is so amazing.
In one area that carries on in occupation seems to be up here.
Even if these other areas are occupied, what it's really showing is this huge dislocation where these pits were producing pottery for the high medieval period, those are not being occupied nearly as intensively.
The people who lived there are somewhere else.
And you're talking,
I suppose, about a population that's gone from maybe
2 million in 1086, to something like 6, possibly, in 1300.
There's a lot of argument about this, isn't there? But...
Perhaps collapses back down to two or three.
Massive contraction.
After the ravages of the plague, many English villages were deserted forever.
But not here.
Even Smeaton survived with the old families we met in the 1270s.
The Allans. The Swans.
But in Harcourt, the Merton court rolls show the loss of two thirds of the tenants.
The highest losses from the Black
Death known anywhere in Britain.
And a hint of the villagers reactions to the catastrophe comes in a box of documents which has recently turned up, recording grants made of property and land in the 1350s that later came into the hands of the village grammar school.
They still provide a charitable income for Kibworth high school.
So, an astonishing treasure trove, the school box.
These are the earliest documents from the 1350s, the immediate aftermath of the Black Death.
It's very rare that you can home-in on what the ordinary people, the peasant farmers, are thinking at this time.
But it's revealed here.
This is a little land document, like a mortgage.
HE READS IN LATIN
Know people now and people in the future that I, John Deer...
HE READS LATIN this grant of land confirmed with
Robert Chapman of Kibworth.
And it's the gift of one house...
HE READS LATIN which belonged to Nick Poli in Church Lane.
Poli died in the Black Death.
Recently dead.
Along with a rood - that's a quarter of an acre in middle furlong... and a rood of meadow.
What these men are doing is they're putting together a little parcel of property and land whose revenues, supervised by a group of local trustees, farmers, will give enough money to fund a chantry priest, separate from the parish church.
Now, this priest may in time have even taught the kids in the village to read and write but his chief job is to do masses, dirges and requiems forever for the souls of the dead.
For the mothers and fathers, the brothers and sisters, and the children of the village who died in the Black Death.
The greatest catastrophe in its history.
That document from 1353 is the start of a whole series of gifts for commemoration and charity.
In Kibworth, it's a continuous thread from the bequests of Tudor farmers in their wills, to Victorian villagers who left trusts to provide for the poor.
Our English ancestors believed that if a community is to thrive, it cannot leave the sick and the starving behind.
In fact, they saw charity as one of the foundations of community.
And you can still see it in action.
This is Kibworth's 24-hour relay to raise money for Cancer Research.
Of course, there's a huge gap between the 14th century and us.
Sometimes, it's hard to believe that we're the same people.
Or that our medieval ancestors would recognise us as their descendants.
But I think they still would.
It's the spirit of Britain, partly crazy, very kind, very generous, very giving.
Really good.
A good friend of ours, Gordon, we kind of did it for him.
And for everybody else that was in need, I suppose.
So, perhaps the values of the medieval world are not so far from us as we might think.
They're still there, running just under the surface of our lives, keeping the connection with the generations of the past, far and near.
Everyone who enters the teams are given one of these bags and a candle.
They decorate the candles and make a dedication to people who have either lost the fight, or are still in the fight, or they just love and are poorly.
Or have survived.
There are lots of survivors, too.
TRANSLATION:
Now Y knowe of parti, but thanne Y schal knowe, as Y am knowun.
But catastrophe also changes us.
After the Black Death, deep social unrest led in 1381 to mass revolt by peasants across England.
But not in Kibworth.
The later outbreaks of plague had brought village society almost to its knees.
The early 15th century was one of the worst times in village history.
But change was in the air.
And driven by the community itself.
In the face of such economic hardship and distress, many people at the time saw that change must come in the relationship between the rulers and the ruled in England.
But the change came in Kibworth not through violent revolution, but through negotiation.
And in 1427, the College took the key step of abolishing all 18 customary tenancies, that's the land holdings which were held by villeins, semi-free peasants who owed work services to their lord.
So, from that moment, if you were an ordinary Kibworthian, you no longer held your land
"in bondagio", in bondage, but "ad voluntatem", at will.
In other words, negotiated with your landlord for a cash rent.
And, at the same time, the College reduced the rents right across the board.
And, then, finally in 1439, a special court was held in Kibworth to cement this relationship.
HE READS IN LATIN
Between the customary tenants of Kibworth, and the scholars of Merton College, Oxford.
It's a document to finalise and record the mutual consent of both parties to the new deal.
It draws the line under the feudal age which has ruled in England since 1066. And even before.
Now, labour services and villeinage are abolished.
You can have your son or daughter inherit your land.
You can take out a leasehold.
You can transfer lands, build up your holdings, amalgamate your tenancies.
You can decide whether you want to be an arable farmer, or whether you want to breed stock.
You can view English history at this time through the lives of kings or queen's, if you like, through the Hundred Years War, and the Wars of the Roses.
But, here is a glimpse at grassroots level of changes that were no less significant in the national story.
By the 1440s, the people of Kibworth, like many villagers throughout England, are on the way to becoming modern people.
So, that's the story of how the medieval villagers of Kibworth survived famine, pestilence, and the Black Death.
Robin Rabble.
That's how the villagers got through England's age of disaster.
And, in the end, came out stronger.
Yummy Mummies...£1,300.
600 years ago, Kibworth was already a deep-rooted community.
The old families, the Polis, the Astins, the Swans, had already lived and worked here for centuries.
But this story is also about a living English community today.
We've been raising funds for six months. And a tough six months.
There's been a recession.
History is not just something that happened back then, in the past.
History, in the end, is now.
And us.

Will.
Full severance package and a book deal.
Total non-disclosure.
Uh-huh.
Total.
Okay, boys.
Get his stuff.
Danish? Eclair?
I'm gonna miss you, Will.
Mmm-hmm.
Little afternoon pick-me-up, Mr. A?
I'm okay, Tommy.
Remodeling?
No, I quit.
Why would you do that?
He wants to spend more time with his family.
Didn't know you had a family.
Spend all your time here.
Well, I do.
Oh!
Oh, to the best editor who ever escaped the dreary halls of GPH.
To Will.
To Will.
We're gonna miss you,
Mr. Atenton.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, you finally made it out the door?
Yes.
You have some brilliant ideas in your head.
Let them out.
You think?
You don't want to be chained to your desk as an old editor, do you?
No.
Here. Best contractor in Fairfield County.
Can't do it all by yourself.
I shall miss you.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, Atenton!
Will. How you doing?
Heather. Heather Keeler.
I found your house.
Yes, sorry.
Yes. Yes. Bramble Branch.
How are you doing?
I'm well.
Do you need a lift?
No, no,
I'm getting a taxi.
A cab in this weather?
Come on. I'll give you a lift.
No, no, Heather.
Mine's the one on the left.
But you know that, don't you?
Okay, here we are.
Enjoy your new home.
Thank you.
You have a good night.
Good night.
Sweetie, I just wanted to know, did you get the 7:15?
'Cause I really don't know whether to put the kids to bed or not.
So, give me a call or let me know...
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Will!
You gave me a fright.
Crazy.
You don't answer the phone? What's going on?
What?
You did it.
You didn't? You didn't?
You didn't think I would, did you? I didn't think you would.
You did it! Oh, you did it!
I'm so proud of you!
Oh, we're gonna be so much happier.
The kids are gonna be so much happier.
Where are they?
Oh, the kids are asleep.
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Mrs. Atenton.
Mr. Atenton.
What's this?
Oh, this is the kids' painting.
Um...
Have the children gone to bed?
Yeah, the children are very...
They're very tired.
I put them in bed.
And they've been working all day?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll just put my coat down here, like this, and then my...
And this is a...
This is a new cushion, I see.
Shall I give it a squeeze?
I think you should.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!
What have you been doing?
Um, painting!
- Painting!
- Oh, really?
Sweetie, you wanna show
Daddy the surprise?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah?
That surprise.
Okay, ready, Dee Dee?
One, two, three, go!
Wow!
Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
Really?
Yeah.
Honestly?
Yeah, you're hired.
You can't afford me.
I think
I might be able to.
What is that?
There's a very strange smell around here.
You! You!
You! You! You!
I know what it is.
Mmm-hmm.
Stinky. Mmm-hmm.
It's stinky kids.
Stinky kids.
Stinky kids need bath time!
Stinky kids.
Are you gonna tell me what this novel's about?
If I tell you about it, then...
Well, then it all disappears, doesn't it?
But I can see the characters, Libby.
I can.
Just... Just as clearly as I can...
Thank you.
...as I can see you now.
Thanks for the flowers.
When? I didn't give them to you.
I found them on the porch this morning.
They're probably from a secret admirer.
Of yours.
No.
Maybe.
Some gentleman caller leaving you flowers on the doorstep.
Missed you.
I feel so safe when you're here.
Well, I'm not gonna go anywhere.
What are you thinking about?
Ah, memories, maybe.
Hmm.
Do you remember this?
Forever.
You remember this?
Just a little bit of this.
You remember this?
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
See you Sunday.
Can you have her back by 9:00?
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I know the drill.
Can't we have a single exchange without you turning...
Without you twisting the knife?
No, it seems we can't.
Bye.
Bye, honey.
That's all I know.
That's good.
That's good.
Will, come here.
Come take a look at this.
Would you look at that?
You know what?
I'm not gonna paint over it.
Don't.
Belongs to the house.
They used to run up those stairs.
Wonder where they are now.
Driving their parents insane.
Your financial statements, sir.
It's not what we hoped.
Any word on your custody appeal?
Sorry, sir.
Enter.
Hey, Shakespeare.
Just brought you some tea.
Hey, Dee Dee. Dee Dee, leave Daddy alone. He's writing. Come on.
Dee Dee, come on, come out of there.
Daddy's working. Come on.
I want Daddy.
He's working right now.
I told you.
Will?
I want to go home to my own house.
This is your house.
This is where we live.
Come on, baby.
Come here.
Give me your hands.
What are you so scared about?
What's going on?
Tell me.
What's going on?
Mom, she saw a man in the window.
I couldn't find him.
Where?
Show me.
He was right there.
What did he look like, baby?
She said he had a big head.
And it was fuzzy.
Fuzzy?
Sweetie, do you mean a pretend person?
Is that what you're talking about?
Wait a minute.
I know what you saw. Look.
You saw the twigs at the bottom of the garden.
Looks like...
That looks like a man, see?
No, he was right there.
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
Watch. Look at the window.
And...
See?
See? It was your own reflection.
When Trish turned on the light, it wasn't a man, it was you, little one.
It was you.
It's okay, it's okay.
Who peed their pants?
You did!
Did you pee your pants?
You did.
Did you pee your pants?
You did.
Come on.
You okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, you're worried about something.
Tell me what's going on.
You're so beautiful.
Stay like that forever.
Sorry. No, not possible, not forever.
Shucks.
Mommy's sad.
Daddy, aren't you gonna kill us again?
What are you doing?
Go, go!
Shit!
Shit.
Get up!
What were you doing in there?
We didn't know anybody lived here!
I live there!
Well, you scared the shit out of me!
Well, what were you doing down there?
It's 'cause of the murders.
What murders?
You live here, and you don't know about the murders?
The snowstorm?
In April?
Come on, man, the whole family got murdered!
Have you been looking in through my windows?
He's back.
That is him.
He's back.
Who's back?
He's back.
- That is him!
Sweet!
He's back!
Jerk.
Hey. What...
Who is it?
It's nothing, Libby.
It's just some kids.
They were just messing about.
Go back to bed. I'll be up in a minute.
Okay.
The department doesn't close unsolved homicides, so, officially, the case is still open.
But I've only been on the job a couple of years, so I don't know a lot about the old cases.
You must be able to tell me something.
I mean, who did it, for Christ's sake?
Well, the focus came down on the father.
Peter Ward.
He went a little nuts.
I thought you said the whole family were killed.
Well, the family was shot.
The father survived.
So he's still alive?
I don't really know.
Well, where is he?
- I don't know.
Look.
You can let me look at the case files and then...
I can't do that. It's police business.
No. I'll do it on my own.
Well, if you're not gonna do it, I'll do it.
We can't hand it out to the general public.
Well, I'm hardly the general public, am l?
I mean, I bought the crime scene, for Christ's sake!
New Ashford is a safe town now, okay?
So you got nothing to worry about.
Have a nice day.
Take care now.
Libby?
Libby?
In here.
What's going on?
She heard the kid from across the street on her cell.
What did she say?
Everybody who lives in this house gets killed.
Oh, God Almighty.
Why would she say something like that?
I told them we'd wait till Daddy got home.
Okay. Let me...
Hi, there. Hi.
Look, were you talking on your phone near our house just now?
I just...
Mom!
Can I just...
Hi! I'm Will Atenton from across the street.
I wanted... Can l...
Can l...
Hi. Um, look, we...
We just found out what happened in our house.
I didn't mean to upset your daughter, but I think she might have been talking with some friends on the phone, near the house, and my daughters overheard, and they're five and seven and...
I know she didn't do it on purpose. It's just...
I'll talk to her.
Thank you. Thank you.
That's all I'm asking.
You know, it was the fifth anniversary a few days ago, and my daughter's been having nightmares again.
I'm sorry about that.
That's awful.
Did...
Did you leave some flowers on our porch?
Mom!
No.
What?
Hey, can l see you for a minute?
Right.
Okay, thank you.
The house has been empty a long time.
Um...
Yes, except we've...
We've got an infestation of teenagers in our basement.
And you...
You wouldn't know...
You wouldn't know...
Do they live around here?
I'd like to talk to their parents just so I can keep them away.
Right.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Have a good day.
What are you doing?
Um...
What's going on?
I'm just covering this up.
I couldn't sleep.
What is this?
Those kids, you know?
That l...
The ones I chased off?
They left this.
"Slaughter house."
Who's Peter Ward?
Why didn't you just tell me?
Because I didn't want you to worry.
I just knew we shouldn't have moved out of the city.
Libby, don't say that.
I knew that this wasn't gonna last.
What?
This!
There's something wrong with this house.
No, Libby, there isn't.
We'll do whatever it takes, okay? We'll...
We'll hire a priest.
Hire a priest?
Where do you do that?
Well, it's... Or a witch doctor, whatever.
I don't know.
We'll feng shui the place.
It's our house.
Hmm?
There's joy in this house.
There's real joy in this house.
You're in it, so...
What?
What is that out there?
There.
Hey!
Go in!
Will?
Will!
I'm all right!
I'm all right.
Will!
Go back in the house!
Go! Get back in the house!
Girls?
Girls!
Trish?
Dee Dee?
Girls?
Trish?
Girls?
Will?
I can't find the girls.
They're not in bed, they're not in the garden.
I don't know where they are.
Girls, come on! It's not funny!
Come out right now! Kids!
Did you look under the bed?
No!
Girls, come on now, where are you?
Trish?
Libby?
What?
Okay.
How many lumps?
One lump of sugar, please.
Would you like any tea,
Princess Katherine?
Yes, please,
Prince Beatrice.
Okay.
What are you girls doing in here?
Are we interrupting you?
Hello, Mommy.
Hello, Daddy.
Hello, Mommy.
We found a little girl's clubhouse.
I see.
Wow.
Oh, my goodness me, look at all of this.
And you're having tea?
Yep.
But we were looking for you.
You were?
We were looking for you everywhere.
How long have you been in here for?
When did you get in here?
About two hours.
What is this, baby?
Two hours.
Two hours ago?
You've been in here for two hours?
And how did you find it?
It's an amazing place.
I fell through the wall.
Oh, really?
You didn't hurt yourself?
No.
No. Look at all these toys.
I fell in the box.
Look at that.
"This book belongs to Katherine Ward."
And this belongs to Beatrice, see?
Let me see that, sweetie.
Yeah, she wrote it in there in ink.
Hmm.
Do you think this is where they played?
Yeah.
This is their secret clubhouse.
Uh-huh.
They were happy here.
They were?
How do you know that?
She just knows.
Okay, I need a cup of tea.
Lavender, lavender.
Lavender tea, please, to calm my nerves.
I just can't believe all this stuff.
Yeah, I know.
That's our house, Will.
Yeah.
I mean, how could the neighbors not have said anything to us?
I don't understand.
Nothing. Not a word.
Well, they're all freaked out about having a murderer in their midst.
They just care about property prices, that's all.
Jesus Christ.
He shot the little one in the back.
Will?
- I got it!
Hello.
I brought you some stew.
I thought you might like something you could just heat up.
With all the work you're doing in here, you must be busy.
Thank you so much.
That's...
That's incredibly generous of you.
I felt a little bad about our last meeting.
No, don't. Please, well, look, come in.
Hey, open up!
No!
I live with a herd of elephants, sorry.
Can you keep it down, just a bit?
Okay, Dad!
Will, who is that at the door?
I'm...
I don't know your name.
Ann Patterson.
It's Ann Patterson from across the street.
Come down, say hello.
Down in a minute.
I should go.
Okay.
You'll come back?
Ann!
Did you know the people who used to live here?
Why didn't you come down and say hello?
What's wrong?
This is where the mother was shot.
Okay.
Children were shot right here.
Peter Ward.
Now listen to this.
It's a letter to the editor from just a few weeks ago.
"It is impossible to comprehend how a psychotic murderer
"could be placed in a residential treatment program
"with total disregard for the community.
"Harkness House is located
"within a half mile of my children's elementary school."
Hey, man.
Good luck in there.
When people talk to you, you oughtn't be rude to them, asshole.
Yeah, all right.
Unis, has the mail come yet?
Jesus, Brady,
I've been here three days and you keep asking the same damn question.
It already came, and you already didn't get nothing.
You got the release papers for me?
No. I'm not a patient.
I'm...
Client.
Right.
I need to talk to you about one of your clients.
Unis, has the mail come yet?
Hey, go on.
Move!
Come on.
Let's watch a little ping-pong.
You need to speak to Mrs. O'Brien.
You can just have a seat over there.
I said you could have a seat.
Yeah. Right, thank you.
What are you doing with my stuff?
This is my stuff.
Where'd you get this?
Calm down!
Why are you so angry?
This was in my kids' room.
Where did you get it?
I don't understand what you're saying, all right?
I'll explain it to you.
Peter Ward, stay away from my family, or I'll kill you!
Peter Ward?
There's no Peter Ward here.
No. I'm Martin.
Look.
Peter Ward's out there, man.
I'm sorry.
Will?
What happened?
Not a lot.
Not a lot?
Hey, babies.
Why are you keeping things from me?
I'm not.
Was Ward at Harkness House, yes or no?
No, he wasn't, but it's fine.
It's not fine.
You wanna know why it's not fine?
Because he was outside the window looking in.
The kids just saw him.
They're imagining things, honey...
I saw him!
Well, then we'll call the police!
I did.
What is that?
It's a car.
Okay, okay, kids, everything's okay.
Daddy's home.
Just dial it down a bit, please.
Just stay here.
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Kids, go upstairs now and lock the door!
Hey!
I know who you are, Ward!
Will!
Libby, get inside!
Wait, wait, hold it, hold it, hold it!
Look, you've come at the wrong end.
The guy's driving a maroon Buick.
He's got a hooded parka on.
He's gone now.
Okay, all right.
Calm down.
I will calm down.
But he's just... All right.
This guy's just come in and threatened me and my wife.
Sir, everything is under control.
It doesn't seem to be.
You know what? Look.
Hey! Hey!
It's a photograph.
Look, he took this from my house.
All right.
He's not in Greenhaven.
Okay, the whole neighborhood...
He's back here!
...doesn't have to know.
What do you mean, the whole neighborhood?
You must have just passed him now on the road.
Did you see him?
A maroon Buick?
Hooded parka.
Just calm down.
What are you taking notes for?
Get in the car and go after him!
Would you keep your voice down, please?
You know what, I'm gonna get a gun,
I'll shoot him myself!
Go get some sleep, sir.
Oh, you guys,
Jesus Christ!
Useless!
He's been in our house?
He had this.
Why are they not helping us?
I really appreciate you doing this.
I don't understand why the police won't help us.
Let's just make sure we're talking about the same man.
Please, sit down.
Peter Ward.
Well, I'm just...
I'm just trying to protect my family.
What's that?
It's a gunshot wound.
I don't understand, why...
If he was a suspect, who...
Who shot him?
His wife.
Somehow she'd gotten the gun away from him.
Fought back before she died.
What's he screaming?
He wants to get out, to find the man who killed his wife and children.
You filmed him all the time?
We had to, to protect ourselves.
He was not competent to stand trial.
We held him as long as we could without conclusive evidence.
Wait, can you...
Sorry.
Can you just rewind that a little, just to there?
Stop.
Sir...
That's Ann Patterson.
She's... She lives across the road from us.
I knew she knew him.
Let's go on.
You'll understand.
At a certain point, he simply refused to believe that he was Peter Ward.
You see, in his mind, if he wasn't Peter Ward, he couldn't have killed his wife and family.
Well, what's he doing now?
He refused to allow his name to appear on any of the hospital IDs.
So he chewed them off and invented a new name.
May l?
Sure.
That's...
All right.
Now I want to show you something I showed you earlier.
From five years ago.
That's not Peter Ward.
That's...
That's me.
You lived in this institution for five years, Peter.
No.
That's...
That's ridiculous.
I'm not Peter Ward.
I'm Will Atenton.
That's the name you gave yourself.
W1-1L becomes Will.
The numbers 8-10-10 become Atenton.
Will Atenton.
I don't believe any of this.
You're a danger to yourself.
And to others.
I'm sure the scar where your wife shot you is still there.
That would...
That would mean that...
No.
I left my wife and my family at home this morning.
You murdered your wife and family five years ago.
You're a fucking liar!
All right, move in.
McNulty, get in here.
Oh, nice.
Hello? Hi.
Hi. Where are you?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
I love you, Libby.
I love you.
Will you just hold on just a minute, please?
Would you like to talk to my wife?
No.
Doesn't matter.
No, no.
No, we'll sort it out when I get home. It's...
Will!
Mr. A?
How's the novel?
Am I in it?
I knew he'd be back.
The even numbers always come back.
Will... Will...
Thanks for the flowers.
Tell us a story, Daddy.
Once upon a time, there were two little girls.
And they lived in a house...
In the forest.
...in a forest.
By a stream.
And they had a beautiful garden, with some beautiful flowers in it.
Dee Dee, do you remember the names of the flowers?
Sunflowers!
Marigolds.
And tulips.
Two lips!
One, two.
Stop it.
Will, are you okay?
Will?
Are you okay?
What's the...
Sweetie, you are seriously hot.
You've got a fever.
You're not well.
Daddy, what's wrong?
Daddy's not well.
Listen, why don't you girls go play, and we'll finish dinner later on, okay?
All right?
I'm just gonna talk to
Daddy for a little bit.
Stay there!
I'm just gonna talk to Daddy, okay?
What happened to you at Greenhaven?
They told me that...
They told me that you're not really here.
Okay, Will, now you...
You're really scaring me.
I'm not Will Atenton.
I'm...
I'm Peter Ward.
Do not say that.
You have a fever, and this is the fever talking.
Okay?
Come here. Come on.
Come here, baby.
Daddy's not feeling well.
Tell me your name.
Your real name, not your nickname.
Beatrice.
We leave off the front.
Okay, here we go.
And what's your real name?
It begins with a "K."
Katherine. Katie.
We used to call her Tee Tee.
Now everybody calls her Dee Dee.
And you're Libby.
You're Elizabeth Ward.
Okay, girls. Upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute.
Come on.
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.
Take it easy.
It's just a fever.
It's gonna pass.
Will!
Will, come here!
Oh, God. They've caught your fever!
Come here, baby.
Are you okay?
I can't breathe.
You what?
I can't...
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Come here, come here.
What is it?
Tell me what's wrong.
My throat hurts.
Yeah?
I can't swallow.
It's okay, I'm gonna get you some medicine, and you're gonna feel okay in a minute, all right?
I can't breathe.
I hurt my shoulder, too.
Is this where it hurts?
You wanna show Mommy where it hurts? Where?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, there's a... She's got...
She's bleeding. She's got...
She's got a bite here.
Baby, we're gonna...
It's where she was shot, Libby.
No, it's a...
It's where she was shot, Libby.
It's a fever sore!
It's where she was shot, Libby!
Stop saying that!
There's a bullet wound!
Look at her back!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!
Dee Dee?
Dee Dee?
Baby, come on. Dee Dee?
Oh, God.
Oh, God, she's so cold, Will.
Will, please do something.
She's... She's not moving.
I need you to help, please.
Please, she's not...
What's going on? Dee Dee?
Come on, Dee Dee.
Dee Dee? Dee Dee?
God, Will, she's cold.
Trish? Trish?
Trish, come on. Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, come on. Dee Dee?
Why are you just standing there?
Will, why are you just standing there?
Wake up!
Why won't you help your children?
Will!
Come on. Wake up!
Libby, they're dead.
You're dead.
Oh, please.
Yes, sir. Good evening.
I wonder if you’d take a look at this for me, please?
Thank you.
This is my home.
But it's not...
It's not fit for habitation,
Mr. Ward.
Okay, let's go.
Board it up now!
Libby! Libby!
Look out, buddy.
Libby!
I'm sorry, sir.
Did you do this?
You don't remember me.
Yeah, I remember you were...
You were here.
And you were at Greenhaven...
You really see them.
They're there.
Look. Look!
They're buried at
New Ashford Cemetery.
What are you doing?
Trying to get into my house.
Can't let you do that.
This house is condemned, buddy, can't let anyone in here.
Have you been watching me?
Goddamn right I have.
You're a killer.
Now get out of here.
Go on. Get out of here.
Where were you that night?
I was alone, here at the house.
I was supposed to go out, but it was snowing.
Chloe was with her father, thank God.
Why did you visit me in Greenhaven?
Because I was your neighbor from across the street.
Libby was my best friend.
Why didn't you tell me who I was?
I wanted to, but you told me you were Will Atenton.
What was I gonna say?
Did I do it?
No.
How do you know?
I just know.
Mom?
Hey, honey.
Hi.
Hi.
You...
You need a bath.
Yeah.
I guess
I'll run him a bath.
So,
Mom says you see them.
Yeah.
Are they older?
No, they're not.
Could you tell them how much I miss them?
I will.
Did you leave the plant?
Yeah. It was the anniversary.
Do you water it?
Yeah, I do.
Go get in the car, honey.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
The water is running.
I left some towels.
Don't go anywhere.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Don't tell your father.
Will?
Yes.
I'll be down now.
Mom.
Oh, damn it.
What are you doing here?
I've heard Peter Ward's been in our house.
No, he's not.
And it's not our house.
It's my house.
Come on, Chloe.
Get your stuff.
She's not yours till Friday.
She's in danger.
He's a psychopath.
What are you talking about, Jack? Just go.
Chloe...
No, it's fine, Mom.
I'll go.
Honey, you don't have to go.
No, it's okay.
It's fine.
Good girl.
You're such an asshole.
Chloe! Where are you...
She's upset.
What do you expect?
Ann, I shouldn't even be here. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
- Chloe!
Look, I should go after her.
But I found this in the laundry.
Dr. Greeley.
She treated you at Greenhaven.
Thank you.
I think you should call her.
Chloe!
Chloe!
Chloe!
Why did you release me?
I had no choice.
There was no evidence against you.
So I needed to let you go.
How's the book?
I'm not writing a book.
I'm living in a fantasy and walking around my house, talking to the walls.
Perhaps it's your mind trying to protect itself.
From what?
Their deaths.
Or, the truth.
You think I did it?
I honestly don't know.
I don't care what my mind's trying to do.
I just have to find out who killed my family, even if it was me.
If you would admit yourself here now under my care,
I can treat you.
You're not well, Peter.
Mmm.
No, I'm not.
Oh, I hate it when you leave!
Look.
I'm gonna beat you!
Come on!
The girls have been waiting for you.
I love you.
Sleep tight.
Night, Daddy.
Tell me what you know about that night.
I don't wanna do this.
You remembered where you were shot.
I remember I heard someone on the stairs and I came out.
I can't do this!
You heard somebody on the stairs.
And I came out because I knew it was you.
And then I fell.
And...
The kids were lying there and they were so still.
And I knew they were going away, and I knew they needed me to take care of them, so I went with them.
And then...
And then...
I found those flowers, and I was painting the front hall and it was snowing, and I was worried you wouldn't make it home, but you did.
What else?
What else do you remember?
I don't remember anything.
I don't remember anything.
You shot me.
You shot me.
No.
You shot me!
No, I shot the man who shot the girls.
You shot me.
No.
What is that?
It's a scar.
Why?
Forgive me.
Peter?
Peter, are you there?
Peter?
You have to get out of here. What?
You're gonna tell me the truth.
I tried to tell you in Greenhaven.
Tell me what?
Everything.
Libby, the children, they're gone.
Libby is dead, and you need to let them go.
It was a mistake coming back here.
You can't stay in this house, Peter.
It'll drive you crazy.
How did she die, Ann?
Tell me how she died.
Libby loved you.
She'd want you to let her go.
You have to let her go now, Peter.
Hey. Where are you?
I heard you come in.
Is that you downstairs?
I'm outside the house.
Uh-huh.
Daddy's home.
Who are you?
Shh!
Mommy? LIBBY: Come on,
I heard you downstairs.
What? You're a liar.
What?
Libby?
Okay, kids, don't move, don't move.
Mommy?
- It's gonna be okay.
Libby?
Put down the gun, please.
Libby?
Put the gun down, please.
Libby!
Run!
Daddy!
Daddy!
I didn't do it.
I didn't.
Hello, Peter Ward.
Jack?
Why don't you...
Why don't you put that thing down and we can have a conversation?
Peter!
Jack, you killed them.
It was supposed to be you.
Stop!
Get the chloroform! Now!
It should've been so simple.
I went to the wrong goddamn house.
It was a mistake.
We put them in the basement.
Where are you?
I'm pulling up right now.
First right on Bramble Branch, third house on the right.
I'm outside the house.
I'm looking at Jack's wife right now.
Where is she?
She's talking to someone on her cell.
Who's she talking to?
I don't know.
Maybe that young boyfriend you were talking about.
You got the gun I gave you last night?
Yeah.
Well, use it.
And then just drift on out of New Ashford like I told you.
The insurance money is real, right?
You'll get paid.
I know we don't know each other that well, but after tonight you got something on me,
I got something on you.
We gotta trust each other.
You sure you want me to do this?
What right has she got to destroy my life?
What right has she got to my daughter?
Your call. Last chance to back out of this.
Kill her now.
I'm sick of your shit.
You've tormented me for five goddamn years.
Child killer.
Come on.
You'll never collect.
Chloe collects,
I collect.
You took everything.
My money, my house, my kid!
And now that Ward's back,
I get another shot.
Peter.
Peter?
Peter! Wake up, Peter!
Okay, Ward!
Peter. Peter.
You're all right.
You're all right. You're okay.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Chloe!
Mom! Mom!
Oh, baby.
Peter, no!
Libby! Libby!
What are you doing?
Get out of here.
I don't wanna lose you.
I know, but you have to go.
You be good.
We love you, Daddy.
I love you.
I love you.
I'll always be with you.
I know.
But you know that.
Is there anybody else inside?
No.
You okay?
Yeah.
Every good spy needs a cover.
Be a journalist, they said.
You're good with words.
You'll be safe.
Where is the girl, Mr. Soames?
Where is the girl?
This way!
Please have a seat.
I'd like to call the American Consulate and tell them where I am.
They've already been informed.
Someone's coming to pick you up.
That might be them.
The last time we spoke...
...I didn't realize how fond of Mrs. Lan-Ting you were.
If I'd known, I'd have been more careful what I said.
Both the Lan-Tings are friends of mine.
But only one of them accompanied you to your hotel last night.
Yeah.
She came to tell me she was still in love with her husband.
I'd be careful.
It isn't in some people's nature to love us back.
Where is she...
...Mr. Soames?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Where is she?
A friend of mine told me...
...Shanghai was the Paris of the Orient.
Due to an international treaty...
...every nationality under the sun lived within her borders...
..Chinese and English, French, Japanese, American.
My friend said you could travel the world in an afternoon...
...and never leave the confines of Shanghai's international settlement.
It seems like Shanghai's gonna be a bit of a comedown for you after Berlin,
Mr. Soames.
Not from what I hear, sir.
I meant as a journalist, not a bachelor.
Well, if Japan doesn't withdraw from China soon...
...RooseveIt's threatened to get his hands dirty.
So I'm sure there'll be plenty for me to write about.
Well. And you think it's a good idea for your country to join the war?
Not if it means fighting you Germans.
You seem to be pretty good at it.
I will go get the car.
Did you have to provoke him?
I thought you said he was a diplomat.
No, I said he was attached to the consulate.
He's an engineer.
Stop him! He's with the resistance!
Welcome to Shanghai.
Leni, komm!
Shanghai was about the only place left in China the Japanese hadn't taken over.
Everybody knew it was only a matter of time before they swallowed it whole.
Officially the guerilla war between the Chinese and the Japanese was none of our business.
So, like a good American,
I kept my head down and remained neutral.
Shanghai was divided up into sectors.
Drink in the British zone, eat in the French zone...
...spy in the German zone...
...but stay the hell away from the Japanese.
Naval lntelligence had sent me to Shanghai to help out an agent who was in trouble.
He was my oldest and best friend.
His name was Conner.
I'm gonna get you out tonight.
The storm had blown over by the time
I got to the casino.
In Shanghai, things change pretty fast.
The routine with Conner was always the same.
We'd meet in the biggest casino in town.
The loser would buy dinner.
Chip request for the lady.
Chip request for the lady.
Follow by 500
That is 550.
I'm Out
You're working pretty hard to bully me out of my 50.
What did you say?
Oh, I said, I'll see your 500...
...and raise you whatever I have left.
300 and something.
Why don't you keep your something for your taxi home?
It's a short walk to my hotel.
Three nines.
Three queens for the lady.
A very appropriate hand.
A very appropriate hand.
You must have brought me luck.
No second chance?
Not tonight.
Deal me out, boys.
Leave him.
You all right, sir?
Lieutenant Collins. Captain Astor sent me.
So we finally got you out of Berlin.
How was your trip?
Glorious. Except half the Gestapo was on the ship with me.
Come on in. Let me get you a drink.
Where the hell is Conner?
He was supposed to meet me at the casino.
He was found earlier in the Japanese sector.
I guess he was on his way to meet you.
You know, this whole country has its head buried in the sand.
The Germans are getting ready to march in Europe...
...and all we care about is whether or not the
Yankees beat the Giants.
I mean, what have we done with our lives?
I called Naval headquarters this morning.
I volunteered us both for lntelligence.
Conner and I had joined the Navy
Iike our fathers and grandfathers before us.
Our lives were set.
Birth, school, Yale, war.
The great American tradition.
He was investigating a local gang lord called
Anthony Lan-Ting.
He's the boss of the Shanghai Triad.
He has a deal with the Japanese.
They leave him alone...
...and whenever the Japanese need any dirty work done they go to him.
I'd like to read all of Conner's reports.
He hadn't briefed us in a month.
That's why I sent for you.
I was under a lot of pressure to have him reassigned.
Why?
Because the situation here isn't just black and white.
You got the Chinese fighting the Japanese.
Us, we're caught somewhere in the middle.
Now the truth is, the Japanese want to walk into our zone...
...there's nothing we can do about it.
So sometimes, our only option is just to sit back and not rock the boat.
And that wasn't Conner's style.
Any informers?
Yeah.
He's got a contact at the Japanese consulate...
...a diplomat called Kita.
We've already spoken to him.
I'd like to speak to him myself.
And I'll need an introduction to Lan-Ting.
Apart from his own people, he only mixes with the Germans and the Japanese.
I know plenty of Germans.
When do I start at the Herald?
In Berlin, I played the part of a journalist with Nazi sympathies...
...and I was doing it again at the Shanghai Herald.
Mr. Soames was the Washington Post's correspondent in Berlin before he joined us.
I'm sure most of you are already familiar with his reputation.
Those who aren't will have a chance to find out for themselves in good time.
Right. Back to work.
How's it going, boys?
Paul Soames, Shanghai Herald.
Yeah, we set the meet with Conner's Japanese contact, Kita.
You got a pen?
Where is it?
A place called the Bamboo Tea House in the Japanese district.
He meets his girlfriend there...
...everyday at 3:00 pm.
At all clear, he will open a book on the porch.
Paul, listen to me.
You'll be in the heart of the Japanese sector.
You be careful over there.
Tell us what you know about the resistance
Take him...
...in for questioning!
Papers.
Papers.
Move.
Move. You're under arrest.
"No threat to American interests"?
Sir?
You probably know this already, Mr. Soames...
...but when the owners of this newspaper told me to hire you,
I threatened to resign.
The only reason I didn't was because I wanted to meet you face to face...
...and see if you really believe this crap you write.
My office!
"Germany and Japan are no more our enemies than Britain and Russia are our friends.
In a war of this magnitude our only concern should be for ourselves."
The Japanese foreign minister met with the German foreign minister yesterday...
...and one of the subjects they discussed was whether my Jewish wife...
...should wear a yellow star on her jacket and be herded into a Shanghai ghetto...
...along with the rest of her kind.
Now I think that should be a concern...
...for every civilized country in the world, even America.
I'm not a Nazi, if that's your implication, Mr. Sanger.
I've lived in Germany far too long to have any illusions about what kind of people they are.
Now you can fire me, you can censor me--
I have no intention of firing you.
Write something that doesn't make my stomach turn and I'll print it...
...otherwise you can type your fingers raw for all I care.
Will that be all, sir?
Yeah, get out.
Oh, and this came for you.
At least your Nazi friends are impressed.
Mrs. Mueller, thank you so much for the invitation.
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Soames.
My pleasure. Mr. Mueller.
Mr. Soames.
A party at the German embassy could make one night feel like a thousand years.
Laughing at all their jokes was like eating breakfast from the gutter.
The way I see it, for America to join the war...
...would be like a man who's never been in a relationship interfering in a 50 year marriage.
Thank you for a wonderful party, Your Excellency.
I'm glad you're enjoying it, Mr. Lan-Ting.
You know everyone here, don't you?
Paul Soames.
Anthony Lan-Ting.
Gentlemen, excuse me.
These affairs had quite a guest list.
Nazis, Japanese imperialists, the Triads, Kempeitai.
They were all connected.
Any of them could have killed Conner.
I had to get in between them.
It was like being a worm, working your way into a rotten apple.
Please tell me you're not politicians or diplomats.
If you are a politician or a diplomat, it doesn't matter how beautiful or charming you are...
...I just cannot talk to you,
I couldn't bear it.
I'm afraid they can't speak a word of English,
Mr. Soames.
No?
Let me introduce you properly.
These are my cousins Shin Shin and Lili.
And this is my friend Captain Tanaka...
...a politician and a diplomat, I'm afraid.
Captain, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I hope I didn't offend you, sir.
If there's anything else you'd like to ask the girls...
...I'd be happy to translate.
Well, now that I know you're related to them,
I don't think that would be such a good idea.
Excuse me.
Captain.
Japan is as deserving of an empire in the East...
...as Germany is of an empire in the West.
So...
...how does a writer for the Shanghai Herald get asked to the German Consulate?
Some friends invited me.
Well, the truth is I'm only friends with the lonely-looking fraulein in the black dress.
Oh, I see.
A toast to the Emperor...
..and the Fuhrer!
Honorable men all.
May they rot in hell.
And now, some music.
Anna!
I'm sorry I'm late.
My appointments ran late.
That's okay.
Darling, this is my friend, Paul Soames.
My wife Anna.
How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
What did you decide?
I thought we'd take them to the fashion show at the Casino.
So...
...how do you know my husband?
Actually we just met.
Oh, I thought you were old friends.
It certainly feels that way.
Shall I get you something to drink?
I'd like to dance before I do anything else.
Will you dance with me, darling?
You should ask Mr. Soames.
Mr. Soames?
I'd be delighted.
Thank you, Anthony.
You're welcome.
My husband doesn't always trust people he's just met.
How did you charm him so quickly?
He and his cousins just seemed like the most interesting people here tonight.
They're not his cousins.
No?
They're his mistresses.
Anthony doesn't know I gamble.
He'd be very upset if he found out.
I have no intention of telling him.
Good. Thank you.
I like secrets. I collect them.
Fascinating.
Why were you following me at the casino?
I had no idea you were married.
And who was your friend with the cigarette case?
A question for a question.
Well, it's like poker.
You have to pay to see my hand.
What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?
Paul.
Leni.I thought you'd left.
No, no, no.
Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.
How do you do?
I should get back to my husband.
Of course. Thank you for the dance.
Not at all.
She doesn't look very married.
Neither do you.
Drop me off at the harbor.
Kita was Conner's only known contact.
I figured if Conner trusted him,
I probably could too.
So I found us a quiet place to talk.
What do you want to tell me?
I was helping Conner.
In exchange he promised me an American passport.
I was supposed to get it a year ago.
He said he would help me.
Uh-huh. Well, we're here to help.
Keep talking.
Conner called me a few days before he died.
He needed a checkpoint pass for a friend.
His friend was Japanese.
He was trying to smuggle her out of Shanghai.
He told me not to tell anyone.
After he was killed I was scared you'd think I set him up.
What'd you do with the pass?
I took it to the apartment in Chapei like he said.
What apartment?
Conner lived in the lnternational Settlement.
He gave me an address in Chapei.
When I went, there was nobody there.
I can prove it. I still have the pass.
This was Conner's girlfriend.
Her name is Sumiko.
I can show you where the apartment is.
So all Conner wanted was a checkpoint pass?
Was he working on anything else?
Just routine naval intelligence.
He had me report on the Emperor's East China Fleet.
He never told me what the information was for and I never asked.
Just ask them if they ever saw him with a young woman.
According to the neighbors, the girl disappeared the night Conner was killed.
She set him up.
Must have rented another room.
An attic or a basement.
Anywhere he could have used as a darkroom.
So why didn't the girl hand these over when she turned him in?
Maybe Conner still had enough sense not to tell her everything.
I saw this man with Lan-Ting at the German Consulate.
His name's Tanaka.
He's head of Japanese lntelligence for Shanghai.
These are Navy and Air Corps officers here.
We should find out who the other men are in that picture.
Tanaka's saluting them, they've gotta be ranking officers.
That's Lan-Ting's wife.
Her father was a respected politician till the Japanese took him out.
They would have killed her too but her family arranged for her to marry Lan-Ting.
He protects her.
Anna was everywhere...
...in the city...
...but she always seemed to be hiding something.
So I did what you do with a puzzle.
I stared at it until it made sense.
I have to see what that Japanese bastard wants
No, not now!
This will just take a minute.
I'll be right back.
Anthony, get down! Get down!
Anthony!
Anthony!
Paul, come in.
You're lucky the bastards couldn't shoot straight.
Even luckier that you were there.
Who do I have to thank for that?
The fraulein I told you about last week.
I was supposed to meet her at the fashion show and she stood me up.
Perhaps her husband sent those gunmen after you.
Did you found out who they were?
I will.
Captain, please come in.
Why don't you show Mr. Soames around the house until we're ready for dinner?
Mrs. Lan-Ting.
Your hand. Here.
Thank you.
Did you know any of the men who died today?
They were Japanese.
I meant the others.
I recognized your friends from the casino.
Why didn't you tell Anthony?
I wasn't quite sure what to tell him.
Does Anthony know you're working for the resistance?
I'd never do anything to hurt him.
Your friends didn't seem quite so discriminating.
They murdered several men in cold blood.
Did you know one of the gunmen survived?
What will you do if he talks?
Maybe I can help you.
Every time you've come to me for help
I've done what you asked.
I'm doing everything I can to find her.
You said you could handle this.
You walk into my house and give me orders in front of my own men?
What does Tanaka want from you?
He thinks the resistance is close to me.
How could he think that?
Tanaka has one of the gunmen and is beating him for information.
Who knows what lies he is saying?
I give Tanaka everything and he humiliates me in return.
Forgive us for speaking Chinese.
How do you like the food?
It's sensational.
In fact, it reminds me...just how bad the food is at the Casanova.
The Casanova?
That's my local restaurant. I go there for the waiters.
I dine alone each night, and yet they insist on setting two places.
I'm supposed to meet a friend at the Cathay later.
I can give you a lift back into town.
That'd be very kind. Thank you.
You can't go into town tonight, darling.
It's too dangerous after what happened.
I don't know how to reach her.
I'm happy to pass a message to her if you like,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.
It's no problem at all, the Cathay's on my way.
I can stop in.
I hope I can see you soon.
I look forward to that, Anthony.
Thank you for saving his life.
Chip request.
Where are we going?
Hurry! We're getting out of here.
Please don't kill me.
Drive!
The Japanese will be here soon!
It seemed Anna wasn't worried about the Japanese coming after her.
She was worried they'd find whoever was hiding under that hood.
She better be here as you say!
This is the place. She's here!
We don't have time for games!
I don't understand.
They must have moved her! Captain!
She was here. I swear! Captain! Please believe me.
Please, Captain!
I'll find her for you.
I trust your message was delivered.
I'm grateful for what you did.
Does that entitle me to a few more answers?
No.
I've been doing some homework on you.
I read your stories about the war in Europe.
You write well.
Thank you.
But you don't seem to believe in much.
The story you should be writing is what the Japanese are doing in Shanghai.
The Japanese murdered thousands of people in Nanjing.
And soon, they'll do the same thing here.
That's why we are fighting.
You find this amusing?
No, no. It's just that you just remind me of a friend of mine.
In what way?
The way you argue.
He was a force of nature.
He'd come at you from all sides until you surrendered.
So I should be writing about Captain Tanaka?
He usually has a hand in everything that happens in Shanghai.
Was he head of Shanghai lntelligence when your father was killed?
I did a little homework of my own.
Sounds like he was a remarkable man.
It must have taken a lot of courage to speak out against Japanese atrocities in Nanjing.
He just cared deeply about this country.
Anthony loves American jazz.
Are you still in love with him?
I wouldn't be with him if I wasn't.
I only ask because you seem to be on your own a lot.
I'll take this.
Our informants haven't found any information on the Japanese girl who betrayed Conner.
What about the men saluting Tanaka?
Well, they're officers from the aircraft carrier Kaga.
The Kaga?
We checked it out.
They were in Shanghai last month for R&R.
There's nothing secret about it.
Look, Tanaka is in charge of security for visiting personnel.
He's probably just telling them what bars they can and can't go to.
Conner wouldn't have taken pictures of it if it wasn't important.
He was interested in Tanaka for a reason.
Paul, I know you don't want to hear this,
But this profession catches up with all of us.
Maybe Conner made the wrong call.
He didn't make mistakes like this, Richard.
You know, the first article I ever wrote for the Herald was about your mother.
The Garbo of Shanghai, I called her.
Well, perhaps I'll have to dream up a name for you, too.
Just finishing up some work back here, sir.
Why don't you wait in my office?
She's a friend of the family.
I'm helping her with her passport application.
I understand. I'll just finish up.
So if you'll just-- Yes.
Lock up when you go.
I needed to see Shanghai through Conner's eyes.
The only port in the world that would take in 20,000 Jews on the run from Hitler...
...as the Japanese and the Chinese were engaged in street warfare.
Dead bodies piled up.
Westerners walked over them and went about their business.
To survive Shanghai, you needed to understand her contradictions.
I showed these to the ambassador.
He doesn't think they warrant any form of protest.
"Having analyzed these photographs
I conclude that the SS methods...
...for pacifying an occupied country are exceedingly simple.
Families are picked at random...
...taken to a place of execution and then forced to dig their own graves.
And if they happen to be Jewish...
...then the children are shot in front of their parents first."
You gonna beat the German army on your own?
Forget the Germans. We've already lost in Europe.
No, I'm talking about the Far East.
The Far East, that's where the next battleground is.
Now, if we wanna beat them
We're gonna have to sink to their level.
Do whatever's necessary and if our superiors don't like it, then they don't have to know.
These sons of bitches have opened my eyes.
There's a lady to see you, sir, in the lobby.
Why didn't Karl take you with him?
What would I do in Tokyo?
Drink tea with the wives, try to understand their English?
I wish you'd told me you were coming.
I would have cancelled my dinner plans.
Thank you.
What's this?
It's not what you think it is.
Of course it is.
No.
I've put Karl through hell these past weeks.
Men always seem to notice when you're not in love with them any more.
And he's been so preoccupied with his work.
A bad day at the office doesn't justify that.
It wasn't a bad day.
We've had the Japanese stay at our house ever since we arrived.
They've been drinking our champagne, eating our caviar and no word of thanks.
Why doesn't Karl say something?
He has to be nice to them.
Our navy sold them something that doesn't work...
...and now he has to fix it.
I didn't realize he was a naval engineer.
Can we please stop talking about him?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
...about where to take you for dinner.
I thought you had plans.
Well, something came up.
It's them!
Drive on.
Fireworks.
There's this lovely little bar I know on the Rue Lafayette.
I thought we'd go there for a nightcap...
...and then back to your place.
What?
I have staff.
Smuggle me past your staff.
Hello, Mr. Soames.
Mrs. Lan-Ting. How are you?
Very well, thank you.
You remember Mrs. Mueller.
Yes, of course.
Would you like to join us? Would you like to sit down?
I'm meeting some friends.
Is Anthony with you?
Not tonight.
My husband and I are having a party next week.
We'd love to see you if you're free.
My pleasure.
Good.
"Type 91 torpedoes transferred to the aircraft carrier Kaga...
...October 28th, 1941, Shanghai."
I don't even know what this tells us.
This tells us the officers of the Kaga didn't come to Shanghai for the night life.
Conner worked it all out.
Look at the date.
The torpedoes were delivered two days after Conner took those photos.
The Germans and the Japanese are allies.
They sell each other weapons all the time.
These are not ordinary weapon.
You got 800 kilogram torpedoes.
You've got naval engineers on both sides making adjustments to maximize the accuracy.
Let's suppose that he stumbled on an arms deal.
What would you like me to do?
Find out where the Kaga is.
I already did.
She's been with the East China fleet the whole time.
She hasn't moved in months.
Look, find out who killed him...
...and I will do everything in my power to make them pay...
...but I can't declare war on Japan over these.
I hope I'm not crashing the party.
I wasn't sure if you'd invited me the other night.
I invited Miss Mueller.
Mrs. Mueller.
Did your friends ever show up?
You think I came to see you?
If I'm to be honest, I stayed up all night wondering if you did.
I'm wise to your charms, Mr. Soames.
Don't forget I heard you in action with Miss Mueller.
Mrs. Mueller.
Listen, if I say something that offends you, please just smile and walk way...
...because I would hate to get slapped in front of all your guests.
Maybe you shouldn't say it.
I wanna see you again.
Are you flirting with my wife now?
Absolutely.
How's your arm?
It's already healed.
I'm glad.
Darling
...will you ask the girls to dance with our Japanese guests?
Okay.
Let's talk.
A few years ago I'd have cut his throat for even looking at her.
Anna told me she saw you at the
Casanova Restaurant last Tuesday.
That's right. She did.
She caught me having dinner with my German friend.
Will you confirm that to Captain Tanaka?
Of course.
Thank you.
Is everything all right?
Japanese diplomats were assassinated that night.
Captain Tanaka thinks someone close to me told the resistance where to find them.
He wants me to account for the movements of all my men.
Surely not your wife?
My wife, my friends...
...myself.
Mrs--
Excuse me, Captain.
You're not enjoying the party, Mr. Soames?
You look like you're hiding out as well.
I'm too old to make a fool of myself on the dance floor.
You're welcome to come in and hide with me.
We will have our own drinks.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I was looking for my husband.
He's in the living room, I believe.
I've never seen so many men make fools of themselves over somebody.
She talks to ten of them at the same time...
...and they all think they're the only one she's interested in.
That's part of her charm.
You think it's as innocent as that?
Her husband tells me you spent Tuesday night with her.
No, no, not with her unfortunately.
I just ran into her at the same restaurant, the Casanova.
Are you married, Mr. Soames?
I was. A long time ago.
My wife ran off with another man two days before we were due to leave for Shanghai.
I'm sorry.
Did yours break your heart?
From what I remember.
Women always win in the end.
They forget us more easily.
Mine certainly did that.
To nobody ever making fools of us again.
Do you think it's possible to fall in love like that again?
Well, I don't think it'll ever be as maddening as the first time.
I disagree.
I think the second time might be worse for men like us.
What kind of men are we?
Romantics.
We are so eager to get over the pain of the first betrayal...
...we'll walk blindly into the next.
You don't remember how long Mrs. Lan-Ting stayed at the restaurant?
If I can recall, she was there the entire time we were.
About nine to midnight.
The Chinese use these to light their opium candles.
I'm always burning myself.
I think I will have one.
Fireworks.
I told you.
I must check on our guests.
Alright.
You're leaving so soon?
Yeah, think so.
You were talking to Captain Tanaka?
Yes. We were both admiring your skill...
...at convincing every man in the room that he meant something to you.
Surely that's what every good hostess does?
He seemed to imply there was more to it than that.
In fact, he warned me to stay away from you.
Why would he do that?
He probably thinks
I'm some idiot American who'd be crazy enough to lie for you.
And are you?
I think we both know the answer to that question.
Thanks for the party.
So what's this article of yours about, Mister...?
Opium addiction amongst the various armed forces in Shanghai.
Just take a look. Does he come here?
I wouldn't waste your time writing an expose on your Japanese friend...
...if that's what you're doing. He never touched the stuff.
He only came here because of his little Geisha girl.
Sumiko, wasn't it, Mikey?
Mikey here used to spy on them all the time.
He even drilled his own little peephole through their private booth, didn't you, peepo?
She couldn't get enough of the stuff.
Is that the girl?
When was the last time you saw them here together?
A few weeks ago.
It's nothing like Ralphie told you.
I only peeped on them once or twice.
There was something sad about them.
She'd lie there all doped out of her mind and...
...her Japanese friend would hold her hands, whispering.
Whispering what?
Whatever came into his head.
How she was his future, his second chance.
Did she ever come in here with an American?
Tall, good-looking, dark hair?
Mikey's the only tall, good-looking American around here.
I felt like I was following Conner down a dark alley.
Tanaka's mistress must have been off limits to anybody but a fool.
Conner was a lot of things, but he wasn't a fool.
Conner was investigating a ship called the Kaga before he died.
I need you to find out everything you can about her.
Also all the intelligence you have on the East China Fleet.
No, they transferred me three times this month.
I think they're testing me.
They're not testing you. Embassies rotate staff all the time.
It's just precautionary.
Just do this one more thing and we're gonna get you out.
I need a second passport. That's all I ask.
I'm getting married.
Well, get me a look at the Kaga and I'll consider it your wedding present.
I'm gonna arrange for the passports myself.
It's the last thing you have to do for us.
You have my word on that.
Over there.
Wait a minute. The Kaga's not there.
Here, take a look.
There are other ships missing.
Which ones
The Akagi, it's a carrier.
The destroyers and two tankers.
Is your list up to date?
It was dated the first of November.
Richard, we got nine Japanese warships missing.
You combine all these ships and you have yourself a long-range attack formation.
The destroyers protect the carriers, the tankers refuel them at the center...
...you got a fleet of fighter planes, each carrying 800 kilogram torpedoes.
They're pulling ships from their main fleet and we have no idea where they are.
I have a pretty damn good idea.
I checked with our code-breaking units in Washington.
None of these ships have been issued orders in the last month...
...which means they're probably back at their bases undergoing repairs.
They're hiding the fact that their ships are incapacitated.
A Japanese delegation is in Washington right now trying to negotiate a withdrawal from China.
Our oil embargo has brought them to their knees.
They're desperate to get any concessions they can out of us.
The last thing they want us to know is that their fleet is under-powered.
I'm late for a meeting. We'll talk about this later.
Conner's been right every step of the way.
Every time we doubted him he's proved us wrong.
We need to watch Tanaka 24 hours a day.
Maybe if you had come to me sooner
I could have backed you up.
The same way you backed up Conner?
What is that supposed to mean?
He was watching the Kaga for weeks. For weeks, Richard.
And he never told you a goddamn thing, why is that?
Well, how the hell can I back him up if he wouldn't even talk to me?
Look, I don't wanna believe that Conner died in vain any more that you do...
...but I can't ignore the facts.
He fell in love with a Japanese spy and she betrayed him, and that's all we've got.
What if she was spying for us?
We've always assumed she seduced Conner.
What if it was the other way around?
You don't know that.
We know she was Tanaka's mistress.
I think Conner found out about them while he was tailing Lan-Ting.
He saw an opportunity and he took it and he seduced the girl.
Now what if everything Tanaka ever told her got back to Conner through her?
Even if you're right, she's probably dead.
And what if she's alive?
If she's on the run I can find her.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The meeting's over, Mr. Soames.
I need to speak with you, sir.
Make an appointment like everyone else.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
If I needed to smuggle someone out of Shanghai...
...where would I go for documents?
Why are you asking me?
The young lady I saw you with the other night, you said you were helping her with her passport.
I didn't say I was doing it illegally.
I don't know any other way you could be doing it.
The British and American Consulate have stopped issuing papers.
A friend of mine's in trouble with the
Japanese authorities.
I need to get him out of Shanghai now.
I'm sorry, I can't help.
Maybe your wife can.
Are you blackmailing me?
Not unless I have to.
I don't care what you think about me...
...but if you turn these people down...
...their lives are on your conscience.
Quite an impressive operation you've got here, Billy.
Thank you.
You can tell the war's coming to Shanghai by the number of faces on my wall.
I have a waiting list of 300.
You're lucky you're a friend of Ben's.
I know.
This one won't be convincing.
She's not facing the camera.
It's the best I could do.
Do you get many Japanese clients?
Mostly the Japanese are happy to stay where they are.
Why?
An old buddy of mine was trying to smuggle his girlfriend out of Shanghai.
I was wondering if they came to you.
Everyone comes to me.
You keep records?
I'd love to find the son of a bitch. He owes me a fortune.
I'm sorry. I guarantee confidentiality.
You'll thank me for it yourself one day.
Sir, have any change?
Mr. Soames.
You fainted.
I fainted.
Let me see.
Does he take over when you're done?
Only if I don't find out why you were following me.
I wanted to see where you were taking the girl's passport.
Which girl?
Captain Tanaka's mistress.
Look, Anna.
I followed your man to the safe house after
I delivered your message to the casino.
I actually saw them taking her away.
I didn't realize it at the time...
...because they'd thrown a blanket over her head.
Leave us alone, please.
Why are you interested in her?
She was also having an affair with a friend of mine...
...and he was murdered the night Sumiko disappeared.
We had nothing to do with it.
I'd like to hear that from her.
You're in no position to make demands, Mr. Soames.
Why are you doing it? Why'd you kidnap her?
Tanaka has arrested hundreds of our people.
We are going to trade her for them.
There's something you need to understand,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.
Tanaka isn't negotiating and he isn't interested in getting this girl back.
He wants her dead.
She wasn't just his mistress.
She was spying on him.
Why should I believe you?
Because my friend was an American agent.
Whatever it is she knows
Tanaka won't stop till he finds her...
...and when he does, he won't leave any of you alive to talk about it.
Just show me where she is.
I promise you I'll do what I can to help.
I need more time.
You don't have time.
If she's in Shanghai,
Tanaka's going to find her. No matter what you do, he'll be waiting.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
I'll call you at your hotel this afternoon.
Please... don't follow me again.
I had no business thinking about her.
But I couldn't help myself.
I knew it was a mistake.
But I remembered an old saying...
...The heart is never neutral.
Let's go.
Passport.
The Japanese were allowing only one train a week to leave Shanghai.
I got the passports for Kita and his girlfriend.
And I arranged for them to be on it
I was delivering on a promise made by Conner.
It felt like the one decent thing I could do
U.S. citizen.
Go. Hurry.
Okay.
Excuse me!
Create a diversion!
Papers!
Get her on the train, I'll meet you as planned.
Nobody boards...
...without papers!
Resistance!
Get her out of here!
We have to split up! I'll take her.
Go!
Let me out.
Let me out.
I'm an American citizen!
That's my wife! U.S. passport! U.S. passport!
Go
Why didn't you call me?
My people didn't think they could trust you.
We needed to move the girl
So you told them,
"I'll smuggle her out of Shanghai and everything will work out fine"
Is that it?
You don't understand
That's quite a risk you took.
She could have turned you in at any minute...
...or did you tell your boy to shoot her at the first sign of trouble?
You had your chance. You followed me instead of her.
Where the fuck you going?
Where were you supposed to meet when something went wrong?
There was no plan.
Bullshit! The girl didn't look too good tonight.
From what I could tell she could barely walk.
What are they going to do to her once she slows them down? Huh?
They won't hurt her.
Then they'll probably get themselves killed.
How many will that make it, Anna?
Hey, you can play the heartbroken revolutionary all you want when I'm not around.
The truth is you used everybody...
...your friends, your husband, the girl, and for what?
Tanaka's still here and your father's still dead.
You want to bring him down?
Tell me where she is!
You think that's all this is about?
Thousands of people are dying every day.
You think one life makes a difference?
She can hardly speak.
All she ever asks for is her opium pipe.
I just need to find out...
...who killed my friend.
Anthony, it's me.
Have you gone to bed yet?
Don't wait up for me.
I'll be home late.
Me too.
I miss you too.
Who is it?
Yes?
Captain Tanaka would like to see you.
Has something happened? It's past midnight.
He apologizes.
All right, let's make it quick-- Hey, hold it!
Wait here, Mr. Soames.
I hope you know you're in violation of lnternational Settlement laws.
You got no jurisdiction--
Where is she...
...Mr. Soames?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Mrs. Lan-Ting never asked you for any help?
Introductions? Passports?
I'm sure if she had wanted any of those things, she'd have gone to you, sir, or her husband.
There's no point in waiting. Proceed.
I'm sorry about these interruptions.
It's an unfortunate business.
We arrested a spy last night.
We arrested him on a train leaving the city.
His lover turned him in.
She was a spy, Mr. Soames.
You would admire her skills.
We did everything we could to break him down.
Even when we put him face to face with the girl and she told him what she'd done...
...he refused to believe it.
It's amazing how a man holds onto an idea...
...even when that idea is so obviously false.
I suppose it's all we have to keep us going.
You're sure Mrs. Lan-Ting didn't tell you anything?
I'm sure.
I warn you...
...it isn't easy to watch.
We'll send an official complaint to their government.
Where are we going?
To the hotel.
We have to pack your things.
There's a ship leaving Shanghai at 8:00.
The girl's still alive. I've seen her with my own eyes,
I can find her.
It's too late. Even if she's still alive there's nothing that you can do now.
Your cover is blown. Tanaka won't give you a second chance.
I don't want a second chance. I want 24 more hours.
Please don't make this harder.
Just get the hell out of Shanghai.
You sure I can't change your mind?
Not this time.
You finally got sick of me, huh?
No, are you kidding me?
I just can't keep up with you.
That's because you're always watching my back.
You know as soon as I get there,
I'm gonna cause such a stir that they're gonna have to transfer you...
Christmas in Shanghai, old man. I'm holding you to that.
I'll get the key.
Hello?
My car's parked in front of the hotel.
Well, could you send it up? I'm in a hurry
Thank you.
An unpaid bar bill.
Is there any other kind?
Can I give you a hand with any of this?
Paul?
It's alright.
How is she?
Not good.
Where's Chen?
I sent him to buy more opium.
She's getting worse. I didn't know what else to do.
We need to get her to a hospital right now or she's gonna die.
Get the car.
I need you to wake up.
I need you to talk to me, okay? -Okay.
Conner?
I was so scared.
Why were you scared?
Tell me why you were scared.
They were waiting for us.
Anthony.
I had no choice.
It was the only way to save you.
Your life in return for hers.
Sumi!
Sumi! What happened, Sumi?
There's an American hospital about a mile away.
We might be able to save her.
There won't be anyone left in your hospital by the time we get there.
Japan has just declared war on the United States.
Our first fleet bombed Pearl Harbor an hour ago.
The invasion of Shanghai is already under way.
There's nothing we can do for her.
We can only ease her pain.
I can't do this alone.
Please.
Sumi.
Sumi. it's me.
What did you think she'd tell you?
Why you killed my friend.
She betrayed you.
That's how he found out about your plans.
I had the proof. He took pictures.
You met with the officers of the Kaga.
I heard about the plan to attack Pearl Harbor through my informants.
I was never a part of it.
Yes, I killed your friend.
I didn't even know he was a spy when I followed her that night.
I shot him in the dark.
He could...
...have been anyone.
You won't suffer now.
Mr. Lan-Ting.
I need to ask your wife some questions.
Ask them at my house.
It's a military matter.
We had a deal.
Our deal was she wouldn't be harmed.
This isn't just business.
We're talking about my wife.
I don't have time to argue.
She isn't going anywhere with you.
She'll be returned safely.
I'll be back.
Don't worry.
Please.
Captain!
Wait.
Anthony.
Paul...
...please.
We have to leave.
This is Radio Shanghai.
The United States of America is at war...
Paul, I need your help to get her out of here.
Passports!
I'm driving for him.
Passports!
Go to hell!
Darling,
Darling, I'm sorry.
What did you say?
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry Anthony.
I can't protect you anymore. You must leave Shanghai.
Promise me.
Please, get her out of Shanghai.
No matter what happens stay close to me.
When we get to the port they'll only evacuate Europeans and Americans.
Come on! Anna.
Come on, Anna, we gotta get to the port!
Stay close!
Hold on to my arm!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Hold on to my arm! Anna! Come on!
The port is now under-- Please stay calm, sir.
The port is now under the control of the Japanese Army.
Foreign nationals will still be allowed to leave.
We left the house when we heard the first explosion.
I was sure I had the passports with me.
Well, I can issue you temporary passes
I just have to ask you a few questions to satisfy the Japanese authorities.
So, what were you doing in China?
I came to help a friend with his business.
The business went bust, but fortunately I met my wife.
I guess you start looking for something...
...and end up finding something else.
And where do you plan to move after you leave China,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick?
We haven't had much time to think about it.
Your country is at war.
Your people are fighting for their lives.
Why are you leaving?
I'm going with my husband.
One day I will return.
We have to get out of this line.
He still hasn't seen us.
My wife's very ill. We have to get out of this line, please.
Please, my wife is very sick. I have to get her out of this line.
She's very sick, please.
When he sees me I want you to keep walking.
No, no
Anna, Anna, please.
No.
The world had changed.
...and it would never be the same.
In Europe and in Asia the cities were burning...
...and the hunters came out at night.
Anna got off the boat in Macao.
I knew she'd go back to Shanghai.
She worked with the resistance.
Somehow she stayed alive.
Maybe luck, maybe courage.
You had to have both.
I know because I did the same thing in other cities under different names.
Until the long night ended.
But Shanghai haunted me...
...so I returned...
..to her.

Hey, Tommy.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
We're running his DNA through the usual databases.
Here. Look at this...
Fish bites. Note the texture.
Now, look at the eyelids.
These are clean cuts, not bites.
So the eyelids were cut off?
You sure?
Unless a new species of fish recently mutated in the Charles, which I suppose is possible.
What is it?
Conrad Harlow... killed that fed Emily Byrne a while back.
You won't guess what his signature was.
You think the wrong man's in jail?

There's a cabin there.
ALICE: Please. Stop. Just stop.
Nick! Nick!
I'm telling you it was Harlow.
He called me at home.

- [PHONE RINGING]
the suspect in several additional missing persons cases
currently meeting life imprisonment
for the murder of Emily Byrne.
Nick.
Hey. You heard anything?
Uh, not much. We're kind of in a holding pattern here.
[BEEPING]
Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jack.
- I've tried calling you.
- I know. I'm sorry.
I just saw it on the news.
I just needed a moment.
I understand.
How is she?
I don't know.
Her brother and I, we're waiting for the doctor.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Look, I can't say much right now,
about where she was or...
You don't have to.
Flynn just woke up.
He's picking his clothes for school.
- We shouldn't tell him yet.
- [DOG BARKING]
I want to be there.
Mom, do you have time for waffles?
- Sure, honey.
- [DOG BARKING]
I have to go.
- Okay. Me too.
- I love you.
Okay.
Flynn. Flynn. How do you feel about your mother being alive and back?
[REPORTERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[DOG BARKING]
I should have kept looking for her.
[SIGHS]
No, no... We did everything we could.
You had to do right by Flynn.
And what's he gonna have to deal with now?
How is she?
I am Dr. Fletcher.
- I'm sorry, this is Jack. Emily's brother.
- She's stable.
I know your colleagues will want to speak with her but we need to proceed delicately.
Do you have any idea what happened to her?
No. We're still running tests.
She's having intermittent laryngospasm.
A sudden constricting of the throat usually in response to drowning.
The second she opens her eyes, gentlemen, you will know.
- Right now, she needs to rest.
- Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you.
[SIGHS]
I need to do something.
I need to go to the office.
Let's start with the tank, what the hell was it for?
Custom-made, we're checking region manufacturers.
Water was from the creek at the back, and the lock was on a timer.
CSU found traces of hallucinogens
- and nutrients in water.
- What about the cabin?
We're tracing ownership but locals say no one used it in decades.
- And forensics?
- No prints, no blood, nothing.
Whoever cleaned it was good.
We don't know if she was in there for 6 hours or 6 years.
Had to be in and out of the tank, or the skin would start to break down.
Johnson and Briggs are going house to house in the area to see if anybody saw anyone coming or going.
Vega's flying back from D.C.
He'll assist in Emily's debrief and reassimilation.
Crown, comb Harlow's correspondence.
Every letter, every visitor.
Harlow's gonna walk, isn't he?
Harlow called me.
At my house.
He told me where to find her.
But Harlow's not admitting he made the call.
We tossed his cell, checked the footage... I even grilled him myself.
We know he's involved. He can't walk.
But he went to jail for murder, now he has to be retrialed for abduction.
Still no ID on the river body?
No hits yet.
The killer cut off a man's eyelids.
Someone out there had Emily in that cabin, it's the same person.
We'll protect Emily and we'll catch whoever did it.
Now get to it.
Take Emily's old case files.
Look for anybody who hates her enough to be involved in this.
You're okay?
Good, now let's get him.
Emily...
[GASPING]
[SCREAMING]
Hold her. Hold her.
Grab her hands. Hold her.
Damn journalists had to get in here!
Hold her tight. Yeah, all right.
- Get her out of here.
- Get her out!
NURSE: Calm down, Emily...
- Where is she?
- Hey. Relax, Nick.
All right, what she did?
What she did was an instinctive response.
She perceived that journalist as a threat, and she acted.
- She's still awake?
- Yes. You can see her.
Her father's with her already. Come on.
Emily.
Can you hear me?
We can send them away if that's what you want.
Flynn.
Flynn's great.
He looks so much like you.
- I'll show you.
- I strongly suggest...
I think my daughter wants to see her son.
Here he is.
How long?
Emily.
You've been gone six years.
Please, let's give them some time alone.
Warren, it's all right.
[DOOR CLOSES]
I had the perfect speech prepared.
Emily...
[SOBBING]
- [BEEPING]
- [BUZZER BLARES]
Is this about the call
I'm supposed to have made?
It's quite a mystery.
- Who held my wife in that cabin?
- I wish I knew.
But I have faith you'll find whoever framed me.
How did you communicate with this person... to arrange Emily's release?
Now that she's free, let's talk about my release.
You're trying my patience.
That's the thing about doing time for a crime you didn't commit.
Don't you dare say that.
It builds patience.
I will make sure things happen to you in here.
Things even you wouldn't do to a person.
How about making sure you keep her safe this time?
[GRUNTS]
- Step away!
- Step away, sir!
Get him out of here!
He wore a mask.
It's good. What else?
I never saw his face.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[SOBBING]
He's... He's still out there.
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you.
Please, I just want to go home.
[WATER RUNNING]
You know you don't have to do this, Emily.
Maybe it's too much too soon.
No. I need to see Flynn.
Okay.
If it gets to be too much, then you just... let me know and we'll get out of there.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
[SIGHS]
This is it.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
- I told you.
- I'm sorry.
They'll be here in 10 minutes.
- How am I supposed to do...
- Alice, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot to fix it.
- Look at this!
I forgot to fix it. I'm sorry.
It's not like I had a ton of time.
You know what I've been going through.
Have I not gone through it?
She just needs to feel welcome.
And she just needs to be with Flynn.
- I know this. I know this, Nick.
- She's not gonna care...
- Why do you think I want everything
- about the goddamn dishwasher.
- to be all right for her to arrive?
- [BELL DINGS]
- EMILY: Oh, hey.
- Oh, come in. Come in.
Um, he's this way.
This is Alice.
Is this Riggs?
Yeah.
Hi, puppy.
[LAUGHS]
- Hello.
- [FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS]
Come here.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm happy to see you.
Oh, my God. Look at you.
[SOBS]
Look at you, you're so cute.
And tall.
Flynn, why don't you show your mother your room?
[SNIFFS]
[DISHWASHER WHIRRING]
It's just the dishwasher.
You can sit on my bed if you want.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about downstairs, Flynn.
The last time that I saw you, you were very little.
You hurt my mom.
Your mom? How did I hurt her?
They were fighting. They never fight.
I'm sorry.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
NICK: Emily!
Emily, what happened? What's going on?
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- I don't even know what I'm doing here.
- Hey. Come here, come here, come here.
- Nick, please.
- All right. I know. I know. I know.
- Hey. Hey.
[SOBBING] Hey.
- He hates me. He hates me.
- Hey, no, no.
No.
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't.
Now listen to me.
- Listen. Listen.
- [SNIFFS]
I'm asking you to fight through this.
Flynn deserves to know the real you.
Just go back inside, Nick.
Go back to your wife.
- [CAR DOOR CLOSES]
- [ENGINE STARTS]
So, this is me.
Um...
The kitchen...
The kitchen's through there.
And the bathroom's back that way with the bedroom.
Hey, give your bag.
Yeah. Okay.
Do you... Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?
Mm-hm.
[SIGHS]
Yeah, um...
I'm selling medical supplies now.
- You don't practice anymore?
- No. No, I lost my license.
Things kind of got away from me... um, after everything that happened but...
Hey, look, it's been...
2 years, 2 months and...
23 days.
So... I-I'm good, Em.
That's good.
Oh, hey, these... came for you.
They were on the doorstep this morning when I got in. I think... they're from your friends at the FBI.
Look, it's late. You must be tired.
Let me show you your room.
- You're gonna stay in mine.
- No. No, it's okay.
I'll sleep on the couch.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I don't wanna put you out.
Well, look, I'll get you some sheets and pillows.
It's like my mind is working against me.
I can't remember anything, except for the mask and...
Harlow's voice...
and the tank.
The FBI, they asked me
if they can observe the sessions from now on.
Do you have any problems with that?
[SOMBER MUSIC]
[PAPER RUSTLING]
Perhaps the eye symbolizes something so...
so dramatic that probably you had to block it.
[SIGHS]
EMILY: I've been reading about these techniques.
There's hypnosis and pentobarbital.
I wanna try one of them.
MAN: There's a reason those aren't accepted
forms of recovered-memory therapy.
Results often aren't reliable, even fantasy.
EMILY: I don't... care.
I will take any result over nothing.
MAN: Have you heard of a process called "cognitive interviewing"?
EMILY: I remember the rhythm.
The pump.
MAN: Stay with the eye, stay with the eye, Emily.
Stay with your vision.
Remember the first time you saw him.
I see a lot of flowers.
Good. That's very good, keep going.
Tell me about the flowers.
Dalia.
Lily.
Rose.
Poppy.
Senna.
Violet.
Jasmine.
Robert Semerov, sex trafficker.
One of Emily's early cases.
She has never come up with enough evidence to make an arrest.
She made him mad enough to take out a contract on her, though.
We've seen her session with Vega, here's the connection.
Robert Semerov had a habit of naming his favorite girls after flowers.
No known address, but we do have this.
That's Semerov's Benz, last night.
Crown, Ericson, find the link between Semerov and Harlow.
The rest of you, find Semerov.
Results came in on the river body.
I found trace amounts of tissue deep under dead man's right index fingernail.
BPD must have missed it.
That's Semerov's skin under that fingernail.
We just need to confirm it.
I already checked, we don't have a sample of his DNA on file.
We'll get one. Try our friends at BPD.
Walk with me.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER]
Detective Gibbs? Thanks.
Take a walk, Feeb.
You stole my body from the Charles.
This is why one of us is coming here to ask you a favor is so awkward.
- And yet, here I am.
- What is it?
I wanna know if you have someone's DNA on file.
Robert Semerov.
Traffics girls from the Eastern block.
- He's not in any system.
- I heard of him.
We were hoping you guys had an evidence file, from an old case.
You think he's the one who took my floater's eyelids?
Will you help me or not?
It's always a one way street with you feds, huh?
Thanks. I'll owe you one.
Riggs. Riggs.
Look at him. He's so cute.
Look at him. Look at Nick.
Hello, honey. Come here.
What's that? What is it?
Oh. What is this?
Come here, Riggs. Come here.
[PHONE BUZZES, BEEPS]
[TYPING]
[BUZZING]
[LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[DOOR CLOSES]
We need your help.
We think there may be a connection, between one of your old cases and your abduction.
Robert Semerov.
Could he have been at the cabin?
I remember the case, I don't remember seeing him at the cabin.
It doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Just think back...
- I know it's difficult.
- If you don't believe me, Nick.
Why are you even asking the question?
I'm trying to help you, Emily.
- We're in this together.
- Don't say that.
You're not the one who was taken.
You're the one who is fucking somebody else.
Okay. I'll go.
But I'm telling you
Robert Semerov was there.
The girls he trafficked, he gave them all names... flowers.
I watched you rattle
'em off to Dr. Vega.
To Iris, and... and
Dahlia and Lily, and...
Em.
Iris... dahlia...
- lily.
- You need to put those down.
That's evidence.
Yeah, give me forensics.
Emily.
Can you think of anything you would have left out of Semerov's case?
Anything to get us a lead on him?
No.
Hi. Yeah, I need an evidence pickup.
At Jack Byrne's apartment,
Emily's brother's place.
Copy that. I'll text it to you now.
Hey. Y-You were undercover, you know his operation.
Is there any safe houses he used?
Any aliases... that he traveled under?
Did he have any contacts?
There is somebody.
Can you get in touch with him?
She'll only talk to me.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[RUSSIAN ACCENT]:
I saw on the news. How are you?
I'm all right.
I need your help.
You know I owe you.
It's about Semerov.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]:
<b>Please, anything but that.</b>
<b>Anyone but him.</b>
<b>He hurt both of us. But we can stop him.</b>
Where can I find him?
<b>You tried.</b>
I can get him out of your life for good this time, I promise.
<b>The girls talked about a shipment, tomorrow.</b>
<b>Where?</b>
Did you know she was gonna pull us?
No.
If you know how to find Semerov, you have to tell us.
He might be the person who had me, Adam.
I want to be there.
- You know you're not ready for this?
- I am ready.
We just want to protect you.
[SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]
Emily!
He approved.
This is a one time deal, Emily.
Now what do you have?
Don't move until we see the girls.
Does anyone have eyes on Semerov?
Negative. He should be in the car.
- Around.
- Go.
- FBI! Don't move!
- [GIRLS SCREAMING]
Don't move!
Semerov, halt!
- Emily. Emily.
- MAN: Hands in the air!
Hands where I can see them!
Who are you?
Where is Semerov? Out the vehicle!
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't work with Semerov.
Hands on the car. Come on.
- Go! Go! Fall back!
- Come on.
Come on. Come on.
What? What is it? I can't hear you.
Now is not the time.
Who are you? What's your name, huh?
What's your name? Turn around.
- Where is Semerov?
- I don't know.
Haven't seen him in 2 years.
Where is Semerov? Talk!
- Talk!
- Emily!
[GRUNTING]
Emily. Emily.
- He knows!
- Calm down. Don't look.
- Now calm down.
- Adam. Adam. Adam!
- That was Whitman.
- We got a hit?
The DNA under the nail didn't match Semerov.
- The body itself did.
- What?
The body in the river, it was Semerov.
We've been looking for this guy all over and he was in the morgue the whole time.
- Get inside.
- No.
What about the killer's DNA under the nails?
Unfortunately we got a match on that too.
- Unfortunately?
- The DNA belongs to Emily.
- It's a mistake. Redo it.
- Whitman already did.
Three times.

I like the hat.
I just picked it up.
Did you remember your revolver?
Knew I forgot something.
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.
I think that's quite enough.
You are a doctor, after all.
Always nice to see you. Watson.
Where's the inspector?
He's getting his troops lined up.
HOLMES:
That could be all day.
MAN:
Sherlock Holmes.
And his loyal dog.
Tell me, doctor...
...as a medical man.
Have you enjoyed my work?
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.
HOLMES:
Watson. Don't.
Observe.
How did you see that?
Because I was looking for it.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
WATSON:
Lord Blackwood.
You seem surprised.
I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he.
Indeed.
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o.
Good lad.
Impeccable timing. Lestrade.
We've one for the doctor...
...and one for the rope.
- Clarkie?
- Sir?
This woman needs a hospital immediately.
Put her in the back of the Moriah.
POLICEMAN 1:
Right, lads. That's it.
POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads.
POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir.
If you don't mind.
Get him out of my sight.
And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired me.
Not the Yard.
Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me.
Well. London will breathe a sigh of relief.
Indeed. Congratulations. Lestrade.
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.
MAN:
Gentlemen.
Cheese.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you.
Tell me something.
Your new premises...
...when are you moving in?
I should be in within the week.
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.
[GUNSHOTS]
Good God.
- That was gunfire.
- No.
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?
My colleague's probably just putting up a painting.
I'll... I'll go and check.
- Your colleague...
- Yes?
Won't be moving with you, will he?
No, he won't.
Mrs. Hudson.
I won't go in.
Not while he's got a gun in his hand.
You don't have to. Give me the paper.
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.
He just needs another case. That's all.
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know.
Not in a domestic environment.
[GUNSHOT]
Thank you. Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?
- Same time next week.
HUDSON: Come along, captain.
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.
Permission to enter the armory?
HOLMES:
Granted.
Watson. I am in the process of inventing a device...
...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
[HOLMES YELLS]
WATSON:
It's not working.
Can I see that?
[FIRE WHISTLING]
You know, it's been three months...
...since your last case.
HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...
[HOLMES YELLS]
Don't you think it's time you found another one?
I can't but agree.
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.
The sooner, the better.
Paper.
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.
Is it November?
Yes. Holmes. All right.
Lady Radford reports...
Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared.
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies.
Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
Yes.
It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
[DOOR OPENS]
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...
There's only one case that intrigues me at present:
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson.
The absentee landlady.
I've been studying her comings and goings.
They appear most sinister.
Tea. Mr. Holmes?
Is it poisoned, nanny?
There's enough of that in you already.
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...
...as per usual, nanny.
He's killed the dog. Again.
WATSON:
What have you done to Gladstone now?
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.
He doesn't mind.
Holmes, as your doctor...
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.
There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all.
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.
Mary's coming.
- Not available.
- You're meeting her. Holmes.
Have you proposed yet?
- No. I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.
It's happening, whether you like it or not.
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.
You wear a jacket.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
A man? Outside my house?
Straighten your tie.
[WATCH TICKING]
WATSON: Holmes.
- Mm.
You're early.
Fashionably.
Miss Mary Morstan.
My goodness. What a pleasure.
I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
Pleasure is mine.
It really is quite a thrill to meet you.
Mr. Holmes.
I've heard so much about you.
I have a pile of detective novels at home.
- Wilkie Collins. Poe.
- It's true.
It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes...
...making grand assumptions out of tiny details.
That's not quite right, is it?
In fact, the little details are by far the most important.
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.
A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war...
...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave.
Born to be a man of action.
And neat, like all military men.
Now. I check his pockets.
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.
He's cost us the rent more than once.
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes.
You know John very well.
What about a complete stranger?
- What can you tell about me?
- You?
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.
- I insist.
- You insist?
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.
- You're a governess.
- Well done.
Yes, well done. Shall we...?
- Waiter?
- Your student...
...is a boy of 8.
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- HOLMES: Charlie, huh?
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.
Is there ink on my face?
There's nothing wrong with your face.
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.
India blue's nearly impossible to wash off.
A very impetuous act by the boy.
But you're too experienced to react rashly...
...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that.
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.
The jewels you are not wearing tell us more.
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.
The ring is gone.
But the lighter skin suggests...
...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly...
...until you were informed of its true, modest worth.
You broke off the engagement...
...and returned to England for better prospects.
A doctor, perhaps.
Right on all counts. Mr. Holmes.
Apart from one.
I didn't leave him.
He died.
Well done, old boy.
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.
McMURDO:
Get up and fight.
Fight.
- Finish it.
McMURDO: Come on.
Get up and fight, come on.
Come on.
Get up.
MAN 1:
Get up and fight.
That's it, big man, we're done.
You won, congratulations.
We ain't done yet.
[McMURDO SPITS]
HOLMES: This mustn't register
on an emotional level.
First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab.
Counter with cross to left cheek.
Siscombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block, and body shot.
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.
Now fracture.
Break cracked ribs.
Traumatize solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely.
Heel kick to diaphragm.
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...
...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...
...full psychological recovery,
six months...
...capacity to spit at back of head...
...neutralized.

[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN:
What the hell's going on here. Charlie?
Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir.
It's like he's burning from the inside out.
You lot, shut up!
Charlie. Charlie!
Take this man to the infirmary, now.
What's this all about, then. Blackwood?
There's someone I want to see.
[STRUMMING VIOLIN]
- Watson?
WATSON: Right.
Let's go.
What started merely as an experiment...
...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery.
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...
...there's no measurable response.
You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery?
But, now...
...and this is remarkable...
...if I change to atonal clusters...
...voila, they fly in counterclockwise.
Synchronized concentric circles...
...as though a regimented flock.
Watson, this is exceptional.
I, using musical theory.
Have created order out of chaos.
How did you lure them in?
Excellent question.
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.
You are Blackwood's last request.
Look at those towering structures.
It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted.
Most innovative.
What an industrious empire.
Hm?
Oh. I have your winnings from last night.
You weren't there.
So I made your customary bet.
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook.
Locked safely away in my drawer.
Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?
I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
[SIGHS]
You have the grand gift of silence.
Watson.
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
[GROANS]
I knew she'd been engaged.
She had told me.
So that's no to the opera, then?
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.
I want it back.
[CHATTERING]
This way. Mr. Holmes.
Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
Care to come along?
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.
Suit yourself, mother hen.
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
As though...
...he can get inside their heads.
I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.
BLACKWOOD:
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up...
...having seven heads and 10 horns.
Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy.
They worshiped the dragon.
Which gave power.
They worshiped, saying.
"Who is like unto the beast?"
The beast which I saw was like a leopard.
His feet were of a bear.
His mouth was of a lion...
...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.
I love what you've done with the place.
So glad you could accept my invitation.
I just have a small point of concern.
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.
While my heart went out to the families of the victims...
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush.
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...
...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting.
So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot.
Either that or, um...
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment.
Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.
You see.
Five lives might have been spared.
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.
Hm.
Sacrifice.
Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain.
After you're hanged, of course.
I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
Then you, too.
Could serve a greater purpose.
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.
I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
You and I are bound together on a journey...
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.
But beneath your mask of logic.
I sense a fragility.
That worries me.
Steel your mind. Holmes.
I need you.
You've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.
Pay attention.
Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.
You must accept that this is beyond your control...
...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible...
...it'll be the last sane thought in your head.
What did he want?
Not sure.
But I don't think you're needed. Father.
Not for this one.
MAN:
Lord Henry Blackwood...
...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic...
...the unholy murder of five innocent young women...
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.
Do you have any final words?
Death...
...is only the beginning.
PRIEST:
...Forever and ever. Amen.
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
I much prefer to travel in the winter.
Here. I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...
...and your favorite...
...olives from the Cyclades.
Thought we might have a little tea party.
And while I was setting the table.
I found this:
A file with my name on it.
"Theft of Velazquez portrait from king of Spain."
"Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...
...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess."
I was simply studying your methods...
...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
Ah.
But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
But your signature was clear.
Is that the maharajah's missing diamond?
Or just another souvenir?
Let's not dwell on the past.
Shall we?
By the looks of things.
You're between jobs.
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?
He was boring and jealous.
And he snored.
I'm Irene Adler again.
[FARTING]
Thank you.
[SNIFFING]
I need your help.
I need you to find someone.
Why are you always so suspicious?
Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
I think you'll find all the information you need inside.
Who are you working for?
So I'll have to find out the hard way?
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.
Well, consider it a wager that you will.
Do you remember The Grand?
They gave me our old room.
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.
Ma'am.
- He'll do it.
MAN 1: Well done. Miss Adler.
That's precisely why I hired you.
I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours.
MAN 1:
He'd better.
Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
He's essential to my plan.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
MAN 3: What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.
A little rifle range would go a long way, sir...
...rubbing the calluses off these German bands.
God save the queen.
God save the queen, sir.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
Look at you.
Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal?
Are you a masochist?
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.
She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice.
Made a proper idiot out of you.
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?
It doesn't matter.
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.
She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
That's of no consequence to you, is it?
We've done our last case together.
WATSON:
I've already read it.
Missing person:
Luke Reordan. 4 foot 10.
Red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.
- Midget.
- Do you agree?
No. I don't agree.
It's more than technicality, you see.
You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No. I am simply stating that one has...
What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.
[YELLS]
WATSON:
Holmes. Where are you going?
[CRASHING AND GLASS SHATTERING]
HOLMES:
Watson.
Watson.
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.
Oh. My lucky day.
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?
Don't move.
Now, what have we got here?
[ADLER GASPS]
It's...
Thank you.
That's the Irene I know.
WOMAN:
Good boy.
This man intrigues me. Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.
She's scared of him.
Yet she works for him.
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...
...but I advise you leave the case alone.
Well. I may not have a choice.
After all. I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you.
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once.
What's he done now.
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."
No, "you" means you.
CLARK:
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...
Well...
...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir.
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.
I pronounced the man dead myself.
What are the facts?
Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning.
I'll leave this in your capable hands.
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.
Don't try that.
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.
Certainly.
What's the major concern?
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?
Yes, as you should.
It's a matter of professional integrity.
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
Who do you think won the match.
Clarkie?
- Sir?
- The rugby match.
Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence.
Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
LESTRADE:
You took your time. Holmes.
HOLMES:
"And on the third day"...
These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound...
...and they're smashed open from the inside.
Lestrade, what of the coffin?
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?
Anyhow, where's our witness?
He's over there.
And apparently, he is cata...
Cat...
Catatonic, sir.
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.
Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now.
Good day, sir.
Hello.
It's all right.
I'm a doctor.
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
Well?
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.
He had no pulse.
MAN:
Ready.
Down.
Good Lord.
That's not Blackwood.
Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious.
Time of death?
Diptera is...
...approximately...
...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death...
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
May I borrow your pen?
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.
GROUNDSKEEPER:
I know what I saw.
It was Blackwood.
As clear as I see you.
And when the dead walk...
...the living will fill these coffins.
Well, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
LESTRADE: Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.
WATSON:
You really believe he was resurrected?
HOLMES:
The question is not if, but how.
- The game's afoot.
WATSON: Follow your spirit...
HOLMES & WATSON:
And upon this charge, cry:
"God for Harry. England and St. George."
There you are.
Why that certain chips stall.
I don't understand.
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.
WATSON: You know. Holmes.
I've seen things in war I don't understand.
I once met a man who predicted his own death...
...right down to the number and the placement...
...of the bullets that killed him.
You have to admit. Holmes...
...that a supernatural explanation to this case...
...is theoretically possible.
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data.
Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories...
...instead of theories to suit facts.
That said. I believe Adler's midget is the key to this.
WATSON:
Hm.
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound.
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.
Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
Very good. Watson.
You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm.
Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored...
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H, is for?
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.
They should be able to give us an address.
What a coincidence.
There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch.
HOLMES:
Really? I think not.
WATSON:
The time. I have to get back. Holmes.
Taking tea with the in-laws.
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.
WATSON: No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.
We have no need of your lucky heather.
Gypsy woman.
Even if it's to do with Mary?
Oh. Oh.
I see two men. Brothers.
Not in blood, but in bond.
What of Mary?
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.
Go on.
I see patterned tablecloths...
...and, oh, china figurines...
...and, oh, lace doilies.
Doilies.
Lace doilies? Holmes.
Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...
...and, oh, she has a beard and...
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?
Please, enough.
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.
And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
Do you have my money?
You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre.
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!
HOLMES:
I see.
Thank you.
HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.
And I have some change in my pocket.
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.
- Don't give it away here.
- No.
I have to go see Mary.
Give her my best.
And her family, as well.
It does make a considerable difference to me...
...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes.
He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
HOLMES:
Something did.
Irene Adler was here.
Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
[INHALES]
Ah. Putrefaction.
[SNIFFING]
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.
[FLIES BUZZING]
Phosphorous.
Formaldehyde.
It looks like...
...he was attempting to combine...
...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
HOLMES:
More importantly...
...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt.
Peculiar.
Hydrated rhododendron.
[SNIFFS]
- Holmes.
- Hm?
Look at the crest.
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
Of course he was.
The question is, to what end.
Whatever he was working on.
He clearly succeeded.
How so?
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
HOLMES:
Yes.
HOLMES:
Yes.
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?
Maple syrup?
Barley sugar.
Toffee apple.
Let me guess.
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...
...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein.
Just one minute, boys.
Oh. Dredger.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
Meat...
...or potatoes?
My 10 minutes are up.
[GRUNTING]
[IN FRENCH]
[IN FRENCH]
WATSON:
You all right?
[BUZZING]
[GROANING]
Holmes...
...what is that?
DREDGER:
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
[THUDS]
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
WATSON:
Holmes!
[IN ENGLISH] Watson...
...what have you done?
WATSON:
I haven't slept all night.
Not a wink.
Why I ever believed...
...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me...
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.
I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months.
Would you like to know my conclusion?
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?
Why else would I continually be led into situations...
...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else?
You've never complained about my methods before.
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?
How am I complaining? I never complain.
Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning...
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene.
Or the fact that you steal my clothes?
We have a barter system.
Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms?
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.
When do I complain that you experiment on my dog?
- Our dog.
- On the dog.
Gladstone is our dog.
Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
I understand.
- Do you?
- I do.
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.
I'm not sensitive.
What you need is a rest.
My brother. Mycroft.
Has a small estate near Chichester.
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country.
It would be with my future wife.
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.
- You are not...
- What, invited?
Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home?
Now you're not making any sense.
You're not human.
MAN:
John Watson?
Yes.
Your bail's been posted.
WATSON:
Mary.
Just Watson.
I hope you get bail by breakfast.
Because the boys are getting hungry.
[CHATTERING]
LESTRADE:
Step lively.
Back off. Back off.
To which the barman says.
"May I push in your stool?"
[MEN LAUGHING]
Right, you, you're out.
Until next time. Big Joe.
Always a pleasure. Mr. Holmes.
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.
In another life.
You'd have made an excellent criminal.
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.
Now, please tell me you have answers.
All in good time. Lestrade.
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking?
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.
Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.
For whom?
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.
[BLOWING NOSE]
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir...
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.
Mr. Holmes.
Apologies for summoning you like this.
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am.
As to where I am...
...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.
But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...
...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...
...a Brittany sage.
The carriage forked left, then right.
A telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.
And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.
The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.
Lord Chief Justice.
That'd be your official title.
Who you really are is, of course.
Another matter entirely.
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...
...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders...
...in whose headquarters we now sit...
...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square. I think.
As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all.
Yes, well, standard procedure.
I suppose.
[DOOR OPENS]
I daresay we have the right man.
Gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes.
Ambassador Standish from America...
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.
I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
HOLMES:
Yes. Um...
They're practically interesting.
Be as skeptical as you like.
But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries.
The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
What some call the dark arts.
Or practical magic.
STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic. Mr. Holmes.
We don't expect you to share our faith...
...merely our fears.
Fear is the more infectious condition.
In this instance...
...fear of your own child.
Blackwood is your son.
You have the same irises.
A rare dark green...
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...
...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline...
...which makes you either brothers...
...or, in this case, more likely.
Father and son.
Very few people are privy to that information...
...and we want to keep it that way.
He was conceived during one of our rituals.
His mother wasn't my wife...
...but she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner...
...though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
Death followed him wherever he went.
Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
He killed many more.
Using them to enhance his powers.
No one could prove anything.
Of course, but we all knew.
The boy was a curse.
We've done our best to stop him.
But it's not enough.
His power grows daily.
His resurrection is evidence of that.
But what he does next will be more dangerous.
ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power.
He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of world.
We want you to find him and stop him before he does.
COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can.
As home secretary. I have considerable influence over the police.
HOLMES:
Hm, yes.
COWARD:
So...
...name your price.
The benefit of being a consulting detective...
...is that I can pick and choose my clients.
So consider it done. I'll stop him.
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.
- I do have a parting query. Sir Thomas.
- What is that?
If the rest of his family's dead.
How long do you expect to survive?
Food for thought.
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that.
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.
How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality...
How is it going with our case you refuse to take?
...of the wine.
Oh. I've hit a dead end, literally.
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
If you still need him.
Oh, dear.
Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
He's a professor, isn't he?
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.
I've never known a professor to carry a gun.
And on such a clever contraption.
Eye patch, nice touch.
So case closed...
...which makes this a social visit.
No, it's a "you're in over your head.
Irene" visit.
Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks...
...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
[CORK POPS]
Let it breathe.
I've never been in over my head.
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.
Or stay and volunteer for protective custody.
If I'm in danger, so are you.
Come with me.
What if we trusted each other?
Hm?
You're not listening.
I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.
[SIGHS]
So...
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.
You decide.
- Which will it be?
- What...?
I told you to let it breathe.
Can you taste the comet?
Why couldn't you just come away with me?
Never.
[CAWS]
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
Madam. I need you to remain calm and trust me. I'm a professional.
But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
CLARK: Naturally, sir.
That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling.
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.
Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended.
Or we may never have found you.
The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir.
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.
CLARK:
We've checked everything, sir.
No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
So body in the bathtub...
...his eyes were wide open.
And the only thing missing was...
...his ring, sir.
Why did you drain the water?
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer.
Not provide comfort for the corpse.
What is that?
[SNIFFS]
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...
...high up where it's warm and dry.
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.
Constable, you could do worse...
...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints.
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
[HUMMING]
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
It was in the pantry, sir.
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work.
Adieu.
[BELL TOLLING]
What's the meaning of this. Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?
Sir Thomas is dead.
I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.
[CHUCKLES]
Have you lost your mind?
You know damn well what he's capable of.
BLACKWOOD:
Of course he does.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're all here.
My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
A magnificent but simple purpose.
To create a new future.
A future ruled...
...by us.
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history.
Magic will lead the way.
Once the people of England see our newfound power...
...they'll bow down in fear.
Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours.
It will be again.
The Civil War has made them weak.
Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours...
...so we'll take it back.
We will remake the world...
...create the future.
These men are with me. Standish...
...but...
...are you?
No, sir. I am not.
These powers that you're playing with...
...no man can control.
Well, gentlemen...
...someone has to stop him.
Even if you won't.
Oh. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[YELLING]
STANDISH:
Save me!
Gentlemen...
...don't be afraid.
As you can see...
...we are protected.
Come, drink your allegiance here.
You control the police, now use them.
Didn't know you were here.
Since this room is no longer yours.
Do you mind if I utilize it?
Be my guest.
- In here, chaps.
MAN: Where would you like me...
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.
WATSON: Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.
His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
Yes.
Thanks for that, by the way.
There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man.
Elbows and arms stained with blood.
But it's older than his own injuries.
None of it human.
He's not a butcher, let me see.
Yellow flame, green bursts.
An industrial worker.
[SNIFFING]
Pff. Coal.
River silt.
The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in...
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry. What?
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.
I wondered.
Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests?
It's on the stepladder.
Well. Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit.
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.
It'll probably be a factory by the river.
What's that?
Never mind.
You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you?
No, not a clue.
Queenshi the Slaughterhouse.
Nine Elms.
A factory by the river.
Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive.
Not us.
You.
Yes.
Just a figure of speech, old boy.
He's left it there on purpose.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
[MEN LAUGHING]
More coal, doctor.
That's a good one. He's such a tit.
Oh. God. Yeah.
WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard.
And I thought we were trying to be discreet.
You would not last one day in the navy.
Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that?
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.
If only just a sense.
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.
Come on, come on.
WATSON: Look familiar?
HOLMES: Yep.
All that's missing is a ginger midget.
They cleared something away from here not minutes ago.
Like what?
Not sure. Something mechanical.
Holmes.
Look at this.
- Chapter and verse.
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."
BLACKWOOD:
"And behold. I'm alive for evermore."
I warned you. Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control...
...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend.
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness.
Tomorrow, at midday.
The world as you know it will end.
Show me your face.
It'll be the end of your world.
Save your bullets. Watson.
A gift for you.
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
What was that about saving bullets?
[GRUNTING]
BLACKWOOD:
She followed you here. Holmes.
You led your lamb to slaughter.
Holmes.
This game was designed to hurt.
Watson!
It's warm in here. Watson.
In over your head yet, darling?
WATSON: Hold on there.
ADLER: I can't.
Let me take your weight.
HOLMES:
Give us a leg up, old boy.
[GROANS]
These German locks always give me trouble.
[METAL CREAKING]
It's a band saw.
No matter, we have plenty of time.
Holmes.
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.
Holmes, hurry up.
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.
And we'll bounce in three, two...
...one.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.
Thank you.
We should help the doctor.
Holmes!
CLARK [IN SLOW MOTION]:
Mr. Holmes.
Sir.
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Sir!
Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir.
Now. Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Will the train be departing on time?
The train's been delayed, madam.
Shouldn't be long now, though.
MAN:
The train will depart when I tell it to.
And you will leave my employment when I allow you to.
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reordan.
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me. Finished.
MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you...
...not succumb to them.
You have fulfilled nothing.
I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood.
Finish the job or the next dead body...
...will be Sherlock Holmes.
DOCTOR:
The surgeon should be along shortly.
He should be able to rest now.
Excuse me.
Is that the best you can do?
Yes, for now.
I must attend to my other patients.
MARY:
Doctor.
Doctor.
Please.
I know that you care for him as much as I do.
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Solve this.
Whatever it takes.
[VOICES CHATTERING]
BLACKWOOD:
This is beyond your control.
CLARK:
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
ADLER: I've never been in over my head.
WATSON: it's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.
MARY: Solve this.
WATSON: Are you, Holmes?
BLACKWOOD:
Accept that this was beyond your control.
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy.
WATSON:
Holmes!
BLACKWOOD:
Widen your gaze.
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.
ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.
COWARD: His power grows daily.
ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power.
BLACKWOOD:
I need you.
ROTHERAM:
His secret lies in the book of spells.
BLACKWOOD:
Three more will die...
...and there is nothing you can do to save them.
STANDISH:
We know you don't believe in magic.
WATSON:
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
ADLER:
Is that better?
WATSON: He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.
His eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was his ring.
BLACKWOOD:
Give up, Holmes.
This is a riddle you cannot solve.
ADLER:
Good morning.
Now, you need to work.
Familiar artwork.
You look gorgeous.
HOLMES:
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.
You made the front page.
Only a name and no picture.
So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now...
...and that's my area of expertise.
I feel safer already.
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
Yes.
Took the shrapnel out myself.
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
Well. I'm...
I'm just so...
...very glad that you're...
...well...
...with us.
[BOTH CLEAR THROATS]
Now that you're sitting comfortably.
I shall begin.
My initial approach was far too narrow.
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison...
...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum. I have done just that.
In fact. I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity.
But that's for another time.
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system...
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
To fully understand the system.
To get inside it...
...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt...
...with a few enhancements of my own.
My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended...
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail.
I have emerged enlightened.
The fraternity who silently control the empire...
...share the belief with the kings.
Pharaohs and emperors of old...
...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension...
...a gateway to immeasurable power.
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...
...the wings of an eagle.
And the head of a man.
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...
...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man.
Map.
The points of the star represent the five murdered girls...
...but the cross is what we're now interested in.
It's a widely held belief...
...that within the architecture of the great cities...
...are coded references to this system.
Since he rose from the grave.
Blackwood has killed three men...
...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple...
...therefore the system.
Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man.
We found his body here.
Sir Thomas. Master of the temple.
Wore the ox ring.
He died here.
Standish, ambassador to America...
...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years.
The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died...
...is here.
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act.
So we have man. The ox. Eagle.
Only the lion remaining.
Right here.
Parliament.
Right.
You four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.
Ladies first.
LESTRADE:
Now.
HOLMES:
Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you...?
HOLMES: Go.
Hello, hello, hello.
Did the devil turn up?
Well...
...never mind.
You got the next best thing.
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...
...but Mr. Holmes here...
...he's been making some serious accusations about you...
...and the order.
I see.
Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[HOLMES COUGHS]
Excuse me, my Lord...
...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Well, inspector. I have five minutes before my next engagement...
...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy?
Thank you. Lestrade.
My Lord.
I'm curious. Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...
...or just the one I prevented?
Very distinctive.
Those handmade shoes of yours.
But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave.
Nonetheless. I confess to being completely outmatched.
I could deduce very little from my investigation.
Fortunately.
There's nothing more stimulating...
...than a case where everything goes against you.
How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?
Very clever.
But it's not murder. Mr. Holmes.
It's mercy.
We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
Don't you see that it's for their own...?
HOLMES:
No, but I don't care much what you think.
I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony...
...and you've given it to me.
I've told you nothing.
HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.
You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony...
...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago.
Both houses meet today.
The whole government will be present.
COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood. Holmes.
You would have made a valuable ally.
How terrible is wisdom...
...when it brings no profit to the wise.
We take power at noon.
There isn't any time to waste then.
Is there?
TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window.
There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
Technically, that isn't the top window.
Is it, sailor boy?
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.
Anyway.
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.
In fact. I think he enjoyed it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Here's the key.
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes. I smoked him out with relative ease.
- Tanner?
- Sir?
If you would, captain...
...take us under the bridge.
Port side. 100 yards.
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.
Right away, sir.
[HORN BLOWS]
[CHATTERING]
The end is nigh.
Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land.
He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke.
Behold, he cometh with clouds...
...and every eye shall see him...
...and every soul shall wail because of him.
You cannot stop him!
No one can!
[WHISPERING]
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.
ADLER [WHISPERING]: What does it do?
HOLMES: It's a chemical weapon.
The first of its kind.
You deduced that how?
From my pocket.
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse.
Note the blue discoloration.
The faint smell of bitter almonds.
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
ADLER: Cyanide.
WATSON:
Shh.
HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
It'll revolutionize warfare.
[WHISPERING] Yes, killing a lot of people.
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?
Right. How many men did you count on the...?
[GUNSHOTS]
She loves an entrance, your muse.
HOLMES [IN NORMAL TONE]:
Woman!
Shoot him. Now, please.
My lords.
My lords.
My lords.
The time has come...
...for only those who believe to remain.
Behold...
...Lord Blackwood.
[MURMURING]
You seem surprised.
I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny...
...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING
IN DISTANCE]
Listen to the rabble outside.
Listen...
...to the fear.
I will use that as a weapon...
...to control them...
...and then the world.
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.
Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
Electromagnetic waves?
HOLMES:
When triggered, the electrodes...
...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...
...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...
...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.
Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely.
Three minutes. 10 seconds.
I will create an empire that will endure for millennia...
...indestructible...
...and eternal.
Move it. Move it.
We don't actually have to disarm the device...
...we just have to remove the cylinders.
Yes, except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
[IN FRENCH]
I rather wish you hadn't done that.
Irene.
[BELL CHIMING]
On the 12th chime.
I will summon the dark powers.
All those of you who are with me shall be protected.
All others...
...will perish.
I need your pipe.
Nut him!
- Right.
- What?
- Coat.
- Got it.
The new order...
...begins now.
Woman.
What are you waiting for?
[POPS]
[GROANS]
That.
MAN:
Apprehend Lord Coward.
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.
Relax...
...I'm a doctor.
[SCREAMS]
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
We're safe now.
Interesting assessment.
Run off.
I won't be chasing you anymore.
Fare thee well.
I don't want to run anymore.
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.
No!
There was never any magic.
Only conjuring tricks.
The simplest involved paying people off...
...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.
Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest.
Others required more elaborate preparations...
...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
You had it broken before your burial.
Then put back together using an adhesive.
An ancient Egyptian recipe. I believe...
...a mixture of egg and honey...
...designed to be washed away by the rain.
Holmes!
Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub...
...required more modern science.
Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic...
...that was activated by the combination of copper and water...
...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
That might've been a challenge for me...
...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.
The death of Standish was a real mystery...
...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf.
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...
...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue.
Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple?
All it took was a spark.
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious.
Like all great performers, you saved your piece de resistance for the end:
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.
Had it worked...
...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed...
...as their colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know you'd given them the antidote.
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...
...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.
And the world would've followed.
Fear being the most powerful weapon of all.
[CREAKING]
You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition...
...as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.
For God's sake. Holmes, cut me loose.
[METAL CREAKING]
HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud.
Then you'll be hanged.
Properly, this time.
It's a long journey from here to the rope.
[YELLING]
[GRUNTS]
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
I have.
Naked.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
ADLER:
Storm's coming.
HOLMES:
Well, we've still got a moment.
Moriarty.
What?
That's his name.
And he is a professor.
Everyone has a weak spot...
...and he found mine.
Where was it, precisely?
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.
He's just as brilliant as you are...
...and infinitely more devious.
We'll see about that.
You'll miss me. Sherlock.
Sadly...
...yes.
WATSON:
Just keep it under your hat.
DRIVER: Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.
WATSON: Thank you.
- What's in these. John?
Scribbles.
- Scribbles?
- Notes.
MARY: They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.
[WATSON CHUCKLES]
Come on, what's wrong?
Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving?
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.
Now, five minutes here and we'll go home.
Our home.
Get up those stairs.
[KNOCKING]
Don't worry, dear.
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.
Holmes.
Oh. Good afternoon.
I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it were.
But it had a surprisingly soporific effect...
...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.
WATSON:
Get on with it. Holmes.
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.
John, shouldn't we help him down?
No, no, no.
I hate to cut him off midstream.
Carry on.
Well, the executioner attached it to a harness...
...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...
...and the neck to remain intact.
My Lord. I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?
How did you manage it. Holmes?
I managed it with braces.
Belts and a coat hook.
Please, my tongue is going.
I'll be of no use to you at all.
- Worse things could happen.
- John.
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.
HOLMES:
Right.
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...
...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own.
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?
HOLMES:
...Mad honey disease.
Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described.
He doesn't mind.
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
Doctor. Miss Mary.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away.
- What is it is this time. Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.
We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene.
Can I help you, officer?
Shot in the head.
Was it a small caliber bullet?
Yes.
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
Indeed, sir.
Point blank range?
Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty.
MARY:
Oh, there's a good boy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where is Blackwood's device now?
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
I'd wager there's a piece missing.
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine...
...not the poison.
There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.
And Adler was just the diversion.
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.
Imagine being able to control any device...
...simply by sending a command via radio waves.
It's the future. Watson.
[KNOCKING]
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
- Well...
- Well...
[GLADSTONE GROANS]
MARY: Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.
HOLMES:
Clarkie.
Case reopened.
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
I hit the Internet cafe.
You know how many e-mails
I had in my box?
Eighty-three.
Oh, you're a popular guy.
Very.
Of course, 60 of 'em were ads trying to get me to buy something.
Sarah, did you leave these tools on the ground?
I might have.
Let's get them in the bag and bring them in the house, please.
We don't want it to rain on them.
Oh, I checked your Facebook page.
What's-his-name wrote on your wall again.
God, I should never have added you.
Yeah, he, um.
Wants to get back together.
Of course he does.
I told you. Princess, he doesn't deserve you.
There you are.
And there you are. Here I am.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, we have a problem.
I've barely been gone an hour. What now?
You'll see.
Great. Do I have to? Yeah.
Hey, I was looking for you.
Did you go into town?
Mmm-mmm. I didn't think so.
Where were you? Outside.
Working very hard on the garden.
Hmm. We have a garden?
I had a headache.
Haven't you heard that one before?
I did!
I know, honey.
Are you all better now?
Yes. Thank you, Uncle Peter.
So, what is the big problem?
All right, all right. This way.
Why can't you just tell me about it?
No, this is something you have to see.
I'll give you a hint.
It's in here.
Funny.
What do you think?
How are you supposed to tell anything from that?
What, do you need binoculars, old man?
Just get your face up there.
Look in there.
Okay. Oh.
That's really... ls this necessary?
I made a hole! What are you...
Are you impressed with your dad?
I'm impressed with your dad.
Now that, little brother, is a hole.
Nicely done.
That is not good.
No, not good.
What is it? Oh, it's mold.
Honey, you know what, I want you to stand back.
This is really bad.
I don't want you breathing it in.
It can make you really sick.
Just looking at it is making me sick.
This whole house could be infected, for all we know.
Affected, not infected.
Affected, infected, whatever.
Well, if you cover it up, who'll ever know, right?
That's true. Just a minute ago we had a tiny hole to deal with.
Now we have a big hole.
Well, the insurance will cover it.
It's obviously part of the leak.
Did you remember to bring the...
Ah, great minds think alike.
So what do you want to do?
Why are you asking me?
We're out of here in a few days.
Oh, okay. See here, this is where it gets tricky.
You're gonna dump this whole thing on me.
But it comes with the perk of you not being here.
So, dare I complain?
It's what you do best.
All right, I'll deal with it.
Just don't give me shit later when you find out how.
Well, if you do it right the first time, I won't have to.
Have you checked the wall all the way down to the basement?
I just figured out that it got down here.
Okay, come on.
Bring the work light, please.
Have fun.
Uncle Peter, don't do that!
Come on. You used to love that when you were a little girl.
Any day now!
Coming!
How are you, Sarah?
I'm okay. Yeah?
Yeah. How are you?
Look at you.
I can't get over how grown up you are.
You gonna come down here or what?
Bite me! See you later.
Sarah? Yeah.
Wow, I can't believe you're here!
You don't remember me, do you?
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm Sophia.
We used to play together.
Oh, of course. Yeah.
How are you?
I'm quite good actually, especially now that I'm finding you here.
Why is it so dark in here?
The power's out.
My dad thinks rats chewed through the wires.
I'd invite you in, but there's really no place to hang or anything.
That's okay.
I can't stay long anyways.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
How long's it been since you were out here?
A long time, years.
Yeah. I come by once in a while, and I've seen other people here but never you.
Yeah, other family come out now and then, but no one's really been here this last summer.
Well, except for the people who keep breaking in and messing the place up.
That's terrible. Yeah.
Well, they broke almost all our windows.
My uncle had to call the police to run them off.
So what are you doing here now?
Fixing it up.
We're gonna sell it.
That's too bad.
And aside from selling this house, what are you up to?
Nothing much.
Are you in school or something?
No, me and school don't really go together.
I'm working for my dad and thinking about doing something else.
Yeah, it's tough getting any kind of job these days.
There's so many things
I want to do, but I never seem to be able to do any of them.
Can you believe how long it's been?
Remember when we used to play dress up and do makeovers?
Did we? Yeah.
Oh, my God.
It's been so long,
I swear, sometimes,
I think I have holes up here.
I have a pile of photos around somewhere.
I'll have to find them.
Yeah.
You always had the best hair.
So how long are you around for?
We've already been here a couple days, and my dad thinks we're gonna head out soon.
Really?
Well, you maybe want to hang out later?
Yeah, that could be good.
The phone lines aren't set up though and our cells don't work up here.
It's okay,
I'll just come by later.
Okay.
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
It's so good to see you.
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
I'll see you later.
You know, I do remember you.
How could you forget?
See you later.
John, if you care so much about the way it's done, you can do it yourself, okay?
Just do it yourself.
Just trying to be helpful.
You're an asshole.
What? What did I do now? Sorry.
I gotta get out of here, Sarah.
Whoops.
Can I have the keys to my car, please?
Uh...
You know where they are.
Give me the keys.
When you're done with your temper tantrums, see if you can get the electrician on the phone, please.
That would be awesome.
If he could come out here, we could use his needle nose pliers to get that stick out of your ass.
What was that?
I love you, brother.
I don't know why my brother always has to make everything so difficult.
Yeah, when he doesn't do what you want him to.
Exactly. You see, if everyone would just do what I say, we wouldn't have any problems, would we?
Uh-huh.
Do you need any help down there?
No, it's okay.
Okay.
Hey. What are you doing?
I just thought
I heard something upstairs.
It's probably the damn rats.
God, don't remind me.
No, it sounded like someone was up there.
Maybe it's your uncle.
No, his car's not here.
I know how you think, sweetie.
Would you like me to go upstairs and have a look?
Yeah. Okay.
Wait! I'm gonna come with you.
Jesus!
L get you?
Yeah, you did and that hurt.
I'm sorry.
What, you're trying to be funny?
A little bit.
What's that?
Uh, it's just...
It's just nothing.
It's photographs for the insurance.
I don't know why your uncle just leaves things laying around like this.
Ridiculous.
Sorry.
Honey, you're gonna really have to start making some progress in this room.
You haven't even started on this closet.
Most of it isn't mine.
So what?
It's just gonna stay here?
What are you doing in here?
I don't know if you got the fact that we're packing it up to get out...
Yes, I do understand that.
That box is completely empty.
If your cousins don't wanna help out, just keep what you want.
Throw everything else out.
Okay.
At least that's empty.
Right, but what about the noise?
Honey, it's an old house.
They make noises.
I'm sure it's nothing.
But I'll keep looking around, okay?
Thank you.
I want you to sit down, go through that stuff, and start throwing things away.
I want to come back here and see full garbage bags.
All right. You hear me?
Yes.
All right. I'll be right back.
Daddy?
Yeah?
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
What's going on in there?
Are you packing?
Yeah, I'm throwing stuff out.
Good. That's what
I want to hear.
Dad?
Daddy?
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Come on, Dad.
Oh, my God.
Daddy, what have they done to you'?
Daddy.
Daddy, wake up.
Oh, my God.
Wake up. Wake up!
Oh, my God. You're alive.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay, the key. Where's the key?
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna come back.
Daddy, hang on.
Okay, I'm gonna go get help.
Sarah, what are you doing out here?
Why aren't you back at the house?
Uncle Peter! Hey. Sarah.
It's okay.
Hey, what's going on?
Sarah, tell me what's going on.
They got Daddy.
Who's got...
You have blood all over you.
What is going on, Sarah?
They fucking killed him!
Sarah, who hurt your dad?
Somebody was back at the house? Who?
There was just a girl.
A girl? I don't see any girl.
Sarah, you gotta tell me what's going on so I can help you.
What is going on?
Where is your dad?
He's at...
He's in the room on the floor.
Is he back at the house? Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, where are you going?
To get your dad.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Uncle Peter, we need to go get help!
If your dad is hurt we need to help him right now.
We don't have any time to go back into town, Sarah.
No! Please!
Tell me how many people you saw back at the house.
I don't know!
Just give me an idea. One, two, three?
Tell me what I'm dealing with here.
There was one man...
Back at the house?
And then there was just a girl by the road!
Jesus, goddamn squatters!
Please, stop!
It's okay, Sarah.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
I don't wanna be here!
Sarah, come on, calm down.
Here. Your wrist is bleeding.
We'll tie this up first.
I got something here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I know that hurts.
All right, just put pressure on that.
Hold on to it.
Sarah, honey, it's gonna be okay.
All right'?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get your dad.
Just stay in the car.
What are you doing?
I'm getting my gun.
You can't leave me alone here!
I'm gonna be right back!
Just stay in the car, Sarah! No!
No!
Stay in the car and lock the doors. Lock it!
Uncle Peter!
Uncle Peter!
Jesus, Sarah!
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!
You left the trunk open!
No, I didn't!
I closed the trunk.
Someone got in the car!
What?
You can't open it.
I locked him out.
No!
Do you have my key?
Yeah, I'm not giving it...
Give me the key, Sarah!
I'm not gonna give it to you!
Please don't! I don't want to!
I don't want to go out there.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about before.
I didn't know.
You all right? You sure?
Yeah.
Can you show me exactly where you last saw your father?
I looked around but I didn't see anybody.
I looked quick. Take this.
How's your wrist? It's okay.
All right, we're sticking together now.
What if he gets in the basement?
Forget about it.
We're gonna get your dad and we're gonna get out of here.
Get right behind me. Come on.
Come on.
John?
John?
John?
He wasn't in that room.
Where was he?
He was in there.
Okay.
Let's look again.
He was right here.
Oh, Jesus.
Sarah, how was your father when you last left him?
Could he have gotten up?
Could he have moved somewhere?
I can't see how.
Okay, well, maybe he...
Maybe he came to.
Uncle Peter?
Over here.
I don't think there's anybody on this floor.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
What? What is that?
Uh, it's...
It's garbage. Here.
Gotta get this out of here.
Did you check upstairs?
Quickly. Let's...
Let's look again.
Wait! Stay close to me.
Give me your hand.
It's okay.
It's okay.
What?
That wasn't on before.
They took him.
I'm sorry, Sarah, we looked everywhere.
Uncle Peter.
Uncle Peter...
Uncle Peter!
That's good. That's right.
Just like that.
Good. It's okay.
Yeah. It's just a little game we're playing.
Nice.
Don't be shy.
Hmm.
That wasn't so bad.
Hmm? Was it?
How about a little snack now?
There you are.
Sophia. What are you...
Thought we had a date, didn't we?
Are you looking for this?
That's not the key to this door.
That's not the way out.
Daddy?
What did you do to him?
Not nearly enough.
Daddy want his favorite drink?
No'? I think he's going to need it.
Who are you?
Why are you doing this to us?
You have trouble remembering, Sarah.
You have holes up here.
You have the key.
Did I...
No.
Finish what you started.
No.
Leave us alone!
Stop punishing yourself, Sarah.
Sarah, ple...
You have to be quiet or you're gonna wake up Mommy and then I'll have to punish you.
So you want to play with me now?
Why are you making such a big deal?
It's just a game, don't be such a baby.
Don't... Don't...
Please don't! Please don't!
Ow, Daddy, it hurts.
It hurts.
Daddy would never hurt you.
Liar!
Look. Look at what you did.
Look at what you did to me!
How could you!
Look at what you did.
Sarah, honey, you're seeing things, people that aren't there.
You're making things up that didn't happen.
But we can get through this, baby.
You're gonna have to do what I say. Okay?
I can help you but you're gonna have to untie me first.
Sweetie...
Honey?
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. That's right.
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.
Oh, God. Thank you.
Now just give these to me.
All right. All right.
Okay.
Honey, it's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.
All right. You okay?
No, Daddy! Ow!
You're making me do this, Sarah.
No!
John...
Just leave her alone.
Leave her alone?
Shut up, Peter.
Shut up and enjoy the show, huh?
Just like you always did.
Right, Sarah? Let her go.
What is this, a joke?
You're such a loser.
Pretending to be dead.
And then you attack me?
This will be our special little secret.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Sarah. Please.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
It was so long ago.
I should have stopped it,
I should have stopped him.

Well, the only thing I know is she's got a wedding ring, no husband.
We gotta find out if the husband's around.
She have any family?
According to these pictures over here on the table, she does.
Check with the building to see if they have any surveillance tapes, find out if there were any guests in the last 12 hours that she might have had.
You know, her other slipper's up here. Yeah?
Well, I'm just saying, it's improbable that somebody would wanna walk down the stairs with one slipper.
Well, it's late at night, she wants to go to the bathroom, she forgets her slipper.
She's disoriented, you know?
There's only one point of impact and it's severe enough that she fell from a 12foot height, not rolling down the stairs.
You're right.
What are you on, Twitter?
Put the phone away.
I mean, it's within the realm of possibilities that she might have been thrown.
Right?
"Now that the apartment across the hall is vacant."
"I would like very much to discuss purchasing it for myself."
"I don't mean to take advantage"
"of Mrs. Lonnigan's passing so quickly,"
"but one must admit that the sweet darling had a good life,"
"and in fact, lived longer than most people would actually desire."
NYPD. Open up.
NYPD.
"Please also take into consideration"
"that I first declared my interest"
"over two years ago after she first fell ill."
"I shall await your earliest response."
"Best, Abigail Clayton."
So, can you tell me about the tenants that live across the hall from Mrs. Lonnigan?
What are their names? Oh, yeah.
That's Abigail Clayton.
Abigail Clayton.
Well, can you tell me about her?
Well, not.
Not really, sir.
I've actually never met her.
You've never met her?
No.
I'm very sorry.
Klandermann. Yes.
Just a few more hours, actually, is what I've been told.
Can I get a coffee?
It's unavoidable, yes.
We're so sorry for the... Yes.
It is a disturbance. You're...
Yup. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
What were you asking me?
You were saying that you've never met the tenant who lives across...
No. No, no, I haven't.
I've been here now...
It's been 11 years. Oh, my.
She was in the apartment before I arrived, yes, so we've never met.
In 11 years, you've never had any interaction with her personally?
That's not completely true, sir.
Every day or night at a specific time
she will pass a letter to me underneath the door.
I'm the only one in the building who communicates with her.
Food, clothing, you name it, I deliver it.
I leave It In the hallway, I knock, I leave.
She never goes out. Ever.
Yeah, so, in that sense, we have had communication, yes.
That's a little strange.
Well, this is
Columbus Circle, sir.
Nothing seems strange around here.
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to come into the station...
Really? ...after you get off.
What time will that be?
Is that absolutely...
9:30. I get off at 9:30.
Yeah, so...
I'm gonna go try one more time.
Miss Clayton?
Open up, please. It's NYPD.
I know you're in there
Look, I tried to call, I.
I just need two minutes of your time.
Fine.
We can do this one of two ways.
You can let me in now and
I'll make it short and sweet or I'll come back later with a warrant and a bunch of other guys.
And from what I understand, you won't like that too much.
All right, fine,
I'll get awarrant.
Creepy hallway.
Hello? Oh, hey.
Uh, Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
I just needed to talk to you about your neighbor, if I may.
I didn't know her.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.
Look, nobody...
I'm gonna come in here for a second.
I'll shut the door. Uh...
Look, nobody's in trouble.
I'm just following protocol.
I just needed a few minutes of your time.
You live right across the hall from her.
Right.
Wow, this is a really beautiful apartment you have.
Is that what they teach you in detective school?
Charm me with false praise and then we're sitting down for coffee?
Well, if you're offering, you know,
I'd love a cup of coffee. I...
I got here at 6:00 in the morning.
I came from another case,
I've been up all night.
Coffee would be great.
You cook?
Yes.
Are you expecting somebody at this hour?
I imagine that you already know the answer to that one.
Okay, you got me.
That was dishonest. I... Uh...
I was just trying to break the ice.
Yeah, well, I'm not interested in breaking ice or engaging in small talk, so I'd very much like it if you would just get to the point so that I can get on with my morning.
So no coffee?
How long have you lived here?
You wanted to talk to me about my neighbor?
Thank you. Uh...
Yeah, that's right.
This is really nice.
She was old and it's my understanding she was sick for quite a while.
I don't know.
Well, from what I put together, uh, she was feeling a lot better.
You know, she liked to take the stairs instead of the elevator.
She preferred to walk instead of taking a cab.
Hmm. Well, if you say so.
So, your concierge says that you don't like to get out that much.
I suppose so.
Are you... Uh...
What is that? Um...
Agoraphobia?
Well, if you insist.
No, no offense.
You know, I suffer from arachnophobia.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. That's a fear of spiders.
Well, what I wouldn't do for a shoebox full of tarantulas right now.
You're pretty witty for a lady that doesn't get out that much.
Are you here to talk about me or Hilary?
Hilary?
That was her name.
But I thought you didn't know her at all.
No, Detective, I did not.
So why would you call her by her first name if you didn't know her at all?
All right. Are we done yet?
No. Just a few more minutes.
Um, over the last couple of days or weeks, were there any strange visitors or anything out of the ordinary that you were aware of coming from the apartment?
No strange sounds last night when she died?
Since I don't know when she died, day or night, and since I've already made it clear that I didn't hear anything out of the ordinary coming from her apartment, then I'd venture to guess that we are entering into an area of...
Hmm, redundancy?
Okay, now we're done.
Thank you for the coffee.
I'm gonna give you a couple of cards.
If you think of anything, uh, call me.
Thank you.I will.
Okay.
Hey, this is a really nice vase.
It's a little confusing, but it's nice.
I'm sure you could figure it out.
Her name is Justine Waters,
"and she was known as
“America's little darling."
The sole heiress of the Waters fortune,
estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
she mysteriously disappeared
17 years ago this month.
Take a look at these home videos of Justine.
They show her at the Waters family summer cottage in upstate New York.
As you can see, Justine is being filmed
showcasing her hula hoop skills.
At the time, she held the world record of 14 straight hours.
Now, there's been much speculation on Justine's whereabouts.
Theories range from her running off with a Saudi prince
to her being a victim of foul play.
Now while the great and powerful Phillip Waters
claimed until his death five years ago
that he never stopped looking for his daughter,
Justine's 17year silence
remains the most talked about missing persons mystery to date.
In the days leading up to what would become her historic vanishing act,
it was rumored that
18 year-old Justine Waters
had just become engaged to Prince
Achmed Mustafi of Jordan.
What did happen to
Justine Waters?
And will we ever see her again?
I'm Jerry Penacoli for  Extra.
I'm wondering if you could help me identify this crest?
Interesting. Yeah? Why is that?
Well, this could be a family crest.
This is the letter "M", correct?
Well, that was the intention.
The drawing is rough, but...
Well, where'd you find this?
I can't really tell you.
I just need to find out what it is.
Okay. I got a book in the back, something of an almanac, so to speak.
Might be able to find a match.
How long do you think...
Oh, one second.
Yeah?
Yeah, I went through all the evidence like you asked.
Hey, put it out. Step on it.
Yeah, what do you got? Not much.
The only thing that might interest you are some prescription medications, but she was an old woman.
Well, do we know who the doctor is?
Yeah, some doctor in
Westchester County.
We got a name?
Yeah, a Dr. Raymond Fontaine.
Okay, one second.
Let me give you my card and I'll just wait for your phone call.
All right, Frank. Take it easy.
All right, thanks, Howie.
Well, the view is definitely amazing.
As you can see, we're directly over Columbus Circle, which by the way, is the exact point from which all distances to and from New York City are officially measured.
The owner completely renovated and refurbished the entire unit with all the latest and greatest amenities.
Top of the line kitchen by Pedini.
There's only two units on the penthouse level.
Twenty four hour doorman, concierge.
It's a full-service building.
And we are getting another offer later today, so...
I think you guys are the right fit.
If I were you, I'd make a move.
What do you think?
I love it. Good.
Mmm.
They rented the apartment!
How could this have happened?
I wrote half a dozen letters!
I agree, Abby, this is simply outrageous.
They haven't returned any of my phone calls, either.
Is there anything we can do to stop this?
I will look into it immediately.
I need to see you, Ray.
Abby, I'm busy.
I said I need to see you, Ray.
I'm in the middle of something.
Raymond! Now!
You know, the police were here.
In my home.
Of course the police were here, Abby.
And that doesn't bother you?
The police were here because Hilary died.
She had a fall and they're investigating her death.
You live across the hall, so of course they're gonna inquire if you heard anything suspicious.
Once they deduce that her death was an accident, which it most certainly was, they'll have no need to bother you any further.
One of the detectives left me his card.
Oh.
Ray, how many wallets have I bought you through the years?
Abigail, I'm attached to this.
It was a gift from your mother on my first day of medical school.
I'll never part with it.
It's just that I don't want things to change.
Okay? I just need things to stay the same
I just need things to continue...
Abby, Abby.
As they have been.
This is a disruption.
Well, if change is what you don't want,
I strongly advise that you stop inquiring about the apartment across the hall.
And it's sort of academic.
The apartment is leased.
And they're gonna lead their lives just as Hilary led hers.
Not a peep!
Ray.
Abigail.
You've gotta trust me, girl.
You've gotta calm down.
I promise you.
Everything'll be fine.
Haven't I always been there for you?
Hmm?
And by "always," I mean for the better part of your life.
Okay, sweetie.
Good morning,
Mr. Stanford.
Good morning.
Oh, hello, sir. Klandermann.
Mr. Stanford, if you don't mind me saying so,
I've got this sense that
I know you somehow.
Really?
Yeah. It's as if we...
I don't know, we met somewhere or something.
I kinda get that a lot.
I guess I just have one of those faces.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's probably it. Huh.
Sure smells good coming out of that loft of yours.
I'm guessing Miss
Lillian's the...
Yeah, she's the chef in the family.
Yeah.
It's amazing I don't weigh 300 pounds.
I don't understand it.
Son of a bitch!
Well, it's a little too late for that!
You started it, Lillian!
You son of a bitch!
God damn it! Why are you doing this?
Jesus! Tell me one more time to keep my voice down,
I swear to God...
I don't want the help to hear.
Who gives a shit?
I'm not gonna talk to you when you're like this.
I just wanna go inside, okay?
Charlie...
You're not going anywhere, bitch!
Little slut!
God damn it, I'm going back inside.
We're gonna finish this.
Just shut up!
Oh, you don't want the help to hear!
Well, I'm paying them enough to plug their ears!
God damn it. You're drunk!
I want to go back inside.
You're not going anywhere.
Bitch! Did you just hit me?
Is that what you did?
You don't ever hit me!
Bitch!
I'm sorry!
Don't ever hit Charlie!
Do you understand that?
Remember where you come from.
Remember, you bitch!
Miss?
Help me.
Please.
Do I call 911?
No.
I don't want him to go to jail.
You have to stand up. Stand up!
Help me. Stand up!
Shh.
It's okay.
Be quiet.
Lillian. Shh.
Just don't let him in.
It's Charlie.
I'm sorry.
Please just open the door.
Come on, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about this
Lillian!
Shit. Please...
Lillian, open the door.
Open the fucking door!
Oh, great.
Mmm. Mmm.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
What are you sorry for?
I'm just sorry because you're involved now in this.
And I didn't mean for this to happen.
Well, you needn't be sorry.
He works so hard and when he works, he sometimes gets stressed and when he's under a lot of pressure, he drinks a lot.
And I think I set him off, and I don't mean to.
I feel so bad.
Why are you making excuses for him?
'Cause you really don't know him.
He's a really, um...
Reliable guy.
Stop apologizing for him.
Stop it.
I do love him.
Why would someone kill a violinist?
This job really sucks sometimes.
Why would an 80 year-old woman wanna jump off her balcony?
See this here?
This is how I like my crime scene.
That over there is a torso, a head, and right down here...
Oh, God.
What the hell is that?
You see, this is what a murder scene looks like.
What, so you don't think this is a suicide as well?
You, my friend, are a sick bastard.
I'm just saying, nine years on the job, it just doesn't add up.
What's interesting is the girl across the hall.
Oh, I see what this is about.
What, she's hot?
Yeah, she was attractive.
I knew it.
No, here's the thing.
- I ran her through the system, right?
-  Please.
There's nothing on her.
She doesn't have a social security number.
She doesn't have a driver's license, nothing.
A woman like that, living in Columbus
Circle, with all that money?
It just doesn't make sense.
You know, she hasn't left her apartment in years.
This is New York City.
It's a town full of nuts.
No, she didn't look crazy.
How did she look?
She looked like a victim.
Mmm...
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I fell asleep here.
What time is it?
It's almost 8:30.
Oh, wow.
Almost nine hours. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry if I invaded your space.
It's all right.
Would you like me to pour you some tea?
No, no, no, that's okay.
I just...
I need to get going.
Thank you, though.
Oh, God, Charlie's gonna kill me.
It looks like he already tried to do that last night.
Does it look bad?
Do you have a mirror?
It's right there.
Oh...
I feel so stupid.
No.
I do. I just feel so stupid.
I don't even know you and here I am dragging you into this.
It's all right.
God.
It's all right. Don't. Don't.
Why don't you sit down?
I'll pour you some tea.
Thank you.
You've been so nice.
I'm sorry.
Charlie's not such a bad guy.
I don't want you to hate him.
Well, he made a terrible first impression.
I know.
He did.
Can I ask you a question?
Why don't you like having any visitors?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
That's what the real estate agent said.
Well, I guess I just decided a long time ago that I'd rather be alone.
That's not so strange.
Sometimes I just wanna run away and be somewhere where nobody knows me and I could just start over.
I know.
So what did you do?
I told you.
He was coming back.
So I went out into the hallway and I brought her in.
The hall?
You went into the hall?
You know, she reminded me of...
Well, you know, you were there.
And...
Well, I was...
I was just a child then and, well, I wasn’t gonna just stand there and watch this happen.
So you called the police, of course.
No.
What happened?
Well, when she woke up this morning...
"When she woke up”?
You mean she slept over?"
Well, it was hardly a slumber party, Ray.
She was injured and she passed out.
What's her name?
Lillian.
Is she still there?
No.
She left.
She gonna be safe there?
I don't know.
Oh, Abby.
What are you gonna do now?
You know as well as anyone this sort of thing only gets worse.
I don't know.
It's not my responsibility, right?
Maybe you should consider that now that you've helped her she'll likely come back to you for help again.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do next time?
No.
Gimme a mini. Yeah.
Schmear?
I just know I don't wanna be involved.
It's a little late for that.
And Abigail, it's unfair for you to give her refuge and solace
and then when she comes knocking again to ignore her.
Maybe you could be proactive and talk to her, help her.
I don't know.
Well, it's something to consider.
She's your neighbor.
You have something in common.
Maybe you should have her for dinner, over to your place.
I don't think I'm entirely comfortable with that idea, Ray.
Think about it.
All right.
Are you eating? Yeah.
Bagel with a schmear. Bye.
You really banged me up.
I'm sorry.
I mean it
I love you.
I love you.
Thank you, Bubba.
You're welcome, Miss Hart.
Miss Lillian, can I help you with that, please?
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry!
Oh, wait.
I've got it. No, don't, wait.
You having fun down there, Klandermann?
No, sir. No, sir, not at all.
I was just trying to help with...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Let me help.
Oh, good.
This... I shouldn't see that.
It's fine. Okay. All right.
I'll get the elevator.
There we are.
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to help.
Don't worry about it.
There were just so many bags.
I didn't realize... It's fine.
It's not all for me.
I bought you a new tie.
A new tie?
A new tie? Yeah A new tie.
Right here, sir?
On the counter, please. Uh! huh!
Excuse me, sorry.
Thank you.
Everything all right,
Klandermann?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Well, no.
That's...
That's where I found her.
Found who?
Mrs.
Lonnigan, the previous tenant.
What do you mean?
Well, that's...
I was the one that found her.
Right here.
They said she fell down the stairs.
I didn't know that.
She was such a sweet old lady, too, you know?
Everybody loved her in the building.
Always had something sweet to say and always made everybody smile.
The whole building loved her, really.
That's so sad.
I'd just never seen anybody die before.
What do you mean?
She wasn't dead yet when I found her. No.
We got a call, the tenant down below, Henderson, they heard a real loud...
And I raced to...
And the door was unlocked, which is quite unusual for a building like this, I'll tell you that.
But it seemed as if she were still trying to speak.
What was she trying to say?
Oh, I have no idea.
See, I'd never seen anything and there she...
It was awful, so it's all kind of a blur now, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a shame.
I mean, I have an idea
I shouldn't say that.
I haven't told anybody this before, but when I found her it sounded like she was trying to say, uh, "Why?"
"Why?"
But it was a "Why me?"
"Why did this happen to me?" kind of "why." Does that make any, uh...
I'm so sorry.
I should not be here.
I'm so sorry to take up your time.
Do you need any help unloading these bags at all or...
I'll remember how I know you, Mr. Stanford.
I swear I will.
I'm so sorry I haven't.
All right, let me know when you do.
Sure thing.
What was that about?
He thinks he knows me.
Does he?
I don't think so.
Hi. Sorry.
This, um... From...
You're good?
Thank you. Okay.
Before you moved around, you were just in Bakersfield that whole time?
Bakersfield, California.
My mom drank, mostly to get away from my father, who also drank.
Hmm.
Was he abusive? Yeah.
That's pretty much why I left, because I couldn't take it any more.
I was 15 and I had $7.20 to my name.
And I had fallen in love with Charlie and he's pretty much just taken care of me.
I couldn't...
I couldn't stay with someone who hurt me.
I mean, we have a good time, but I don't really...
I wouldn't really have anything without him
I just couldn't do it.
So what's the alternative?
Would you like some more wine?
Yes, please.
So where's your family?
My mom died.
And your father?
He's dead, too.
Oh.
Were you close with them?
I was close with my mother.
Mmm-hmm.
My dad...
My dad drank as well and he'd fly off the handle.
He'd go into these rages.
And he would beat my mother and me when I tried to protect her.
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.
My father could control anything.
So you grew up rich?
I suppose.
Well, I grew up in the trailer park.
Lucky me.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Nope.
Just me.
You? No. Just me, too.
So how'd you disappear?
Haven't I always been there for you?
My father had a friend.
My father had a friend and he knew how bad my father could be and what he was capable of, so he helped me to...
He helped me.
You know, I didn't intentionally...
I didn't set out intentionally. to not go out again.
I just...
You know, I went to the grocery store
and I'd sneak out at night, go to Central Park.
I was always amazed at how quiet everything was.
Such a big city.
I wanna take you outside.
There's this flower shop.
It's a block away.
I wanna take you there.
It smells so incredible and I wanna pick out your favorite flowers.
And then a block further is this rare bookstore that smells kind of musky and it has the most incredible books, and there's this window seating and we can pick out some books and read together.
I don't think I'd feel safe.
I would be with you, protecting you.
You can't stay in here for the rest of your life. Look at you.
You're so beautiful.
You're stunning.
I wanna take you out into the world.
You smell his lavender?
Let's see if he's in the backyard.
This is a nice house.
I should've been a doctor.
Hello?
You smell paint?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
My good shoes.
My mom's gonna have a fit.
I just painted that porch.
I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.
I'm so sorry.
You must be Dr. Ray Fontaine?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm Detective
Frank Giardello.
This is my partner, Jerry Eaans.
Two detectives and you couldn't figure out the porch was freshly painted?
We're really sorry.
We were wondering if we could have a few minutes of your time.
Sure. Would it be all right if we spoke out here? Uh...
Oh, yeah. That would be fine.
Yeah, we wanted to talk to you about Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.
Sure. What about her?
Well, I'm sure that you're aware that she passed away a couple of weeks ago.
Of course. I was her doctor.
Yeah. Could you tell us about her health?
She'd been ill for awhile.
Oh, yeah, she was ill.
With what?
Cancer. Mmm.
It was in remission, actually.
Any dizzy spells, anything like that?
She never complained of any.
She did have tendencies to push herself.
She was one of those people who didn't like standing still.
Why?
Well, she was pretty badly injured.
Well, she did fall down the staircase. Yeah.
What are you suggesting?
Oh, no, no.
We're not suggesting anything.
We're just trying to find out whether or not we have a homicide on our hands.
We'd like to see her medical records, if that's all right.
Of course. I'd need a subpoena.
- Doctor patient confidentiality.
- Of course.
Why don't we do this?
Why don't I give you one of my cards...
Thank you. All right.
...and we'll be in touch.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, it's good to meet you.
What's your dog's name?
Oh, this is Digger.
Digger? Yeah.
All right. Thanks.
All right.
Oh! By the way, do you know Abigail Clayton?
Uh, again, Officer, doctor patient confidentiality.
Oh. Yeah.
We don't want to take up any more of your time. Thank you.
Thank you.
You gentlemen have a good evening.
You, too.
Stop that.
What?
Well, I didn't ask him if she was a patient.
I asked him if he knew her.
You're doing good.
You're doing great.
Good.
Amazing, Abigail. Abigail...
Lillian, why are we even doing this?
I don't want to leave.
We're doing this because it's good to get out of the apartment.
You're doing beautifully.
Look at you.
That's enough, Lillian...
No, no, no.
Okay, okay.
Great. You're doing great.
I don't feel well.
It's okay. I know.
This is far enough.
You're doing great. I'm here for you.
I'm here for you.
Abigail.
Hold the door.
Oh! I got it, sir.
I got it. Come on in.
There you go.
We're gonna at least walk to that table over there.
No, I think we've gone far enough.
Everything all right tonight?
Sir?
Uh-huh!
Good. I'm not ready yet.
Okay! Okay! Okay.
Okay.
Hey, this is me.
I just remembered where
I know you from.
Yeah.
One, two, three.
Come on! There you go! Good!
Great job! Great job!
Beautiful.
Oh, God.
You must be Abigail.
You feeling all right, sweetheart?
Here, let me help.
Huh? Don't touch her!
Don't touch her, please!
Just don't.
Okay! Okay!
Don't, don't. Please don't.
Charlie, please.
You ladies have a good night.
Just stay here for a second.
No, no!
Please don't go in there!
Please don't!
Charlie, what are you doing?
I don't want him to be in my apartment.
Stay right here. He's violent!
He's in my apartment.
Abigail!
When you get her out of her apartment,
I install some computer software so that when she goes online, we'll be able to get her banking password.
Right. Got it. Got it?
It's like stealing the identity of a ghost.
Exactly.
She wants to remain hidden.
And after we've got the money, who the hell is she gonna run to?
We've got her account information, her social security number,
her signature, but we still need to get your fake ID.
It's just so perfect.
We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.
No more nickel and dime shit.
Just sunsets and mimosas, baby.
And once we get the password we're home free.
Happy birthday.
Thank you. I love you, baby.
I love you.
Abigail, please!
What is he doing in my apartment?
He's been drinking! Abigail!
He's been drinking.
You can't, no.
He gets really violent.
You don't want him to hit you.
You don't want him to hit you.
You know what it feels like.
Stay here.
Hey! That's not my apartment.
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Abigail.
I wanna go home.
I live in here and this is how I want it.
I want to be alone.
This is how I want it.
You did a great job tonight, Abby.
I cannot have people in my life.
I cannot have people in my life.
I cannot have you in my life.
If he is in your life, I can't...
No, I wanna be alone I wanna be alone.
I wanna be alone.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm really sorry about Charlie.
Stop apologizing.
He's...
He is dangerous and he will only end up hurting you more than he already has.
Please go.
Okay.
Please go.
Thank you so much for dinner tonight, Abigail.
ANSWERING MACHINE First new message.
Sent today at 9:17 p.m.
Mr. Stanford?
It's Joe Klandermann.
I guess now I should call you
Charlie since we go back, huh?
Anyway, if you're having trouble remembering me,
think back 12 years ago to a holding cell.
Rah way Prison? Remember?
You were about to do a five year stretch on some con
and I was on my way out after doing a deuce.
Good times. Yeah.
Enough reminiscing.
Meet me at the coffee shop around the corner on 59th Street
right after I get off work.
We need to talk.
You're gonna cut me in on whatever scam you're running, Charlie.
I don't know what it is, of course,
but you living here means it's gotta be big.
Yeah. Don't make me wait,
partner.
Damn it.
You're crazy attacking me!
You're a dead man! You hear me?
You're a dead...
Tonight's top story is the bizarre death
of a wanted felon on
Columbus Circle.
We go now live to Diane
Weiss, who's on the scene.
Apparently, Diane, the man was strangled before being hit by a bus?
Yes, Ginger.
Police believe the victim
may have been fleeing from an attacker.
However, the victim,
Joseph Klandermann,
whose real name was Nathaniel
Muskit, was a wanted felon.
Charlie?
Muskit disappeared nearly 12 years ago
and had eluded authorities for that long.
Charlie?
He was convicted in
1998 for running
a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors...
You killed Klandermann? Charlie?
Charlie, we don't kill people!
Lillian. No, Charlie.
This is the one.
This is the one we've been waiting for, Charlie!
He could have turned us in.
I made a decision to protect us.
You made a stupid decision, Charlie.
I don't wanna run from the cops!
You don't have to be scared.
Okay?
It's gonna be fine.
It's okay.
What does that say?
He wants to see us. Yeah.
Klandermann's dead, Ray.
He's dead.
I know, I heard.
Are you all right?
I don't know. I don't know.
What am I gonna do?
They will get a new concierge.
Ray, you know I can't trust a new concierge.
I can't trust a new concierge.
Klandermann had been here so long.
How am I gonna trust a new concierge, Ray?
Ray, I need to see you.
I can't right now.
I promise I'll come by later.
Please, Ray?
I really need to see you.
I'll see you later tonight.
You just relax.
Take a long breath now.
For me, okay?
Bye.
This has gotten completely out of hand.
I understand.
No, I don't think you do.
It's all over the television.
I mean, Mrs. Lonnigan was one thing.
That had to be done.
And so did Klandermann. Charlie?
But there was a mistake made with Mrs. Lonnigan.
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?
When were you gonna tell me this, Charlie?
This is not the time or the place for this.
Ray, what do you mean "mistake"?
There was obviously a serious error made.
We wanted to talk to you about, uh, Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.
The police were here, investigating a homicide, not a slip and fall of an 82 year-old woman.
I don't make mistakes.
Oh, apparently, you do.
Otherwise they wouldn't be investigating a homicide, Charles.
Jesus Christ.
Now thanks to me, Mrs. Lonnigan lived a long and prosperous life, three years longer than I anticipated, and there's only a certain amount of time one can wait.
But this is over now.
We need to discuss an exit strategy.
No, there is no exit strategy.
We're one e-mail away from a fortune.
Charles, how long do you think it's gonna take for them to figure out
I'm the one who owns the apartment?
That I paid for the whole thing?
It's my money!
Once they figure that out, it's a short walk in the park for them to put together who Abigail is.
And what we're all up to.
We need to discuss an exit strategy.
He may be right, Lillian.
It's just a shame.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go water my plants, get over to Abigail's, take out her trash, pick up her cleaning, and give her a foot massage to calm her down, thanks to you.
I guess I'm doomed to take care of this woman the rest of my life.
What do we do?
Let me try to talk to him
Lillian.
Please go in the house and make it look like it was robbed.
Okay?
Did you roll the body?
Yeah.
Did you get the phone?
It wasn't in the house?
No.
It has all our information.
I know.
Do we walk?
No.
No. We don't walk.
We're too close.
With no money, how far would we get?
Look, we knew that if things went wrong we'd have a backup plan, and we do.
Okay?
We have to force her hand.
Okay?
We have to do it now.
It's gonna be okay.
Please! Please, I need you!
Open up! Hurry, please!
Please! Open up! Let me in!
Open the door and let me in!
He's gonna kill me, Abigail!
Please!
Please, Abigail!
Open the door, please!
Please, Abigail! Please!
Open the door! Open the door!
Oh, my God! Charlie, calm down!
Calm down!
Think you're gonna leave me?
No, I'm not, I swear!
Huh? You gonna leave me?
I'm not gonna leave you, Charlie!
Please!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! Okay?
No, no, no.
No! Don't you...
Bitch! Get back here!
Gimme the gun!
Gimme the gun!
The gun! Gimme the gun!
I'm gonna shoot you, Charlie!
I'm gonna shoot you!
You're gonna shoot me?
I'll shoot you, Charlie!
Do it!
Charlie.
Stop! Oh, my God! Stop!
No! What are you doing?
Stop! Oh, my God! No!
No! Get off him.
Oh, my God! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Charlie!
Charlie, no! Charlie, no!
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie, my baby.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie!
You killed him, Abigail!
What have you done? What have you done?
No! I didn't do it. No, you did.
You shot him!
No! My baby. Oh, Charlie.
I have to call someone.
Charlie, don't leave me.
Abigail, no, you can't call anybody!
Are you crazy?
Nobody can know about this.
No, Abigail!
We just murdered Charlie.
We have to leave.
We have to get out of here.
No, no, I can't go anywhere!
We're one e-mail away from a fortune.
I'm all alone and I don't know what to do now and I need to go.
Please, Abigail, help me.
We need to scrape whatever money we can together and I need to get out of here.
Okay?
I have money.
I don't have any cash.
We can transfer money from my account.
And once we get the password we're home free.
I wish I could talk to Ray.
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.
I trust him.
Look at me.
We can only trust each other now.
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.
Really? Are you kidding me?
You're positive?
Same guy?
So what'd you find out?
Well, I don't think that this is an "M" you brought me, Detective.
What do you mean?
I think it's a...
And if it is, it could very well be the crest for the Waters family.
Are you familiar with the Waters family?
Yeah, of course, of course.
Yeah.
This is incredibly exciting.
Is there any chance that you could tell me exactly where you saw this?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I just found out Mrs.
Lonnigan's apartment was paid for by a corporation.
Apparently, she was a nanny for some rich family.
Guess who runs the corporation?
Who?
Dr. Raymond Fontaine.
Really? Let's go pay the good doctor a visit.
Thanks, Howie.
Anytime, Frank.
The porch was repainted.
Anything?
No.
Dr. Fontaine?
Hello?
NYPD.
I'll go this way.
Frank.
Check this out
Ray, Ray...
It's not mine.
I'm heading out.
Why don't you go take a shower and by the time you're ready,
I will be back.
Okay.
And then we'll take care of...
Don't go anywhere.
Where would I go?
Miss Clayton, it's
Detective Giardello.
Yes, Detective?
Look, I'm not calling with the best of news.
My partner and I tracked down Dr. Fontaine and I'm sorry to inform you that he was found dead.
He's been murdered.
If you are who I think you are, I think you're
at the center of something very dangerous.
I'm sorry, Miss Clayton.
What do I do?
Look, we're on our way.
We're gonna be there in an hour.
Don't leave and don't answer the door, all right?
Thank you, Detective.
Let's go.
I just know I don't wanna be involved.
I think you should have her for dinner.
I wanna take you outside.
She reminded me of...
Well, you know, you were there.
Well, I was...
I was just a child then.
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.
You've gotta trust me, girl.
Excuse me.
I'd like to see someone about closing an account.
That would be Mr. Ross, the bank manager.
His desk is right over there.
Thank you.
Giardello.
Detective, this is
Abigail Clayton.
We're on our way.
Ls everything all right?
On your way?
Yeah, since we last spoke.
Since we last spoke?
Two weeks ago?
No, we spoke less than a half hour ago.
No, you must be mistaken. I was in the shower.
I didn't take any calls.
That wasn't you I was talking to?
No. Oh, my God.
How can I help you?
I'd like to close out an account.
All right.
You can hang on to this.
All righty.
Account closure.
Um... May I have the account pass code, please?
Hulahoop14.
Oh...
Oh, there we go.
All right, Miss Clayton.
Everything appears to be in order here.
Wonderful.
Now, before we finish, I'm required to ask you a few questions.
I apologize. It'll just take a few minutes of your time.
Justine Waters has decided to come out of hiding.
Out of ink.
Oh, it's gonna be one of those days, all right.
She will be at the Waters
Bank, 59th and Broadway.
All right.
Were you at anytime dissatisfied with our service?
No.
Glad to hear it.
She goes by the name
Abigail Clayton and...
May I ask, what are your reasons for withdrawing your money?
She'll be wearing a black dress.
I'm leaving the country.
Wonderful!
Are you going to Europe?
I was just in Paris with my fiancée.
We stayed at...
Oh, God, what is the name of that hotel?
It was great.
It had these butlers in it and...
Oh, man, what is the name of that hotel?
Excuse me.
Fellas, how's it going?
Looks like you guys got a busy day ahead of you, huh?
Make sure you stay hydrated out there.
Remember, only stop at the red lights and the short skirts, huh?
Okay.
Are you all right?
Yes... Yes, I'm...
I just need to hurry.
I have a plane to catch.
Ah. Leaving things till the last minute, huh?
A woman after my own heart.
My father always says, "If you didn't do it at the last minute,"
"you didn't do it right."
That's funny.
Yeah. He's a funny guy.
Finally, is there anything we can do to improve?
No. You've been great.
Well, thank you.
Okay. So...
Are there any other questions I can answer for you before we liquidate your account?
Yes. Can you give me the account balance?
Not a problem.
Seven twenty.
720 million?
Yeah.
You want it all in singles?
Are you gonna buy France?
Oh, my God.
720 million. Oh, my God.
You are a card. No, $7.20.
So did you want that in a cashier's check?
$7.20. Is that...
Is that not accurate?
I had $7.20 to my name.
Miss Clayton, are you all right?
Psst.
What are you doing here?
I left.
I couldn't stay there any more.
You made sure of that.
Can we go someplace and talk?
I don't think there's time for that, Abigail
I made some phone calls.
Phone calls? Yeah.
I called a whole bunch of people.
I mean, you've been in hiding for a long time.
This is your big coming out party, Abigail.
Why do you keep calling me Abigail?
That's what you told the man your name was. Didn't you?
That's what you wanted to do.
Steal my life, look like me, steal my money.
Or maybe it's Justine.
I'm sorry.
I have so much to tell you.
Gee, I don't think we have much time, so I hope it's not a long story.
Please.
There's gotta be another way.
You should leave.
Go.
There's a body in your apartment.
Black dress, black dress.
Excuse me!
Excuse me, are you Justine Waters?
Go away! No!
Where to?
Kennedy Airport.
What's all that about?
They just found that girl,
Justine Waters.
Oh, no kidding.
No bags?
No baggage...
So where you going?
Someplace safe and warm.
Ah. Safe and warm.
I always wanted to go there myself, ma'am.
No, not ma am.
You can...
You can call me Lillian.
I'm so worried for that boy.
Joe's gonna be okay.
She was everything to him.
Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man.
But he's never had to be a father before.
I don't think he understands Joe.
How long did Elizabeth work there?
- Five years?
- No, I think it was six.
- What do you think was in the coffin?
- Jesus, shut up.
I'm just saying, 'cause of how she died.
You guys weren't wondering that?
No. I'm eating macaroni salad.
I was wondering about that, too.
I heard it crushed her completely.
Steel beam, those things weigh a ton. Literally.
I don't know how you guys can eat.
Try a turkey roll and you'll discover how.
Lucy, down!
Get down.
Joe? You seen Joe?
Bet Joe's not gonna want to do my movie anymore.
Why?
Why do you think why?
The story, it's about the living dead.
- His mother's not a zombie.
- But she's dead, shithead.
- These turkey rolls are pretty good.
- Told you.
- I just want to talk to you, Jack.
- Get him out of here.
- Hey, Dainard.
- Would you just wait a minute? Wait!
- Jack! Jack, just let me...
- No.
Get out!
Get out!
Hey, Jack!
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Jack, I...
Jack...
Joseph, I'll be home soon.
Oh, my God.
That was the longest day, ever. Here.
- What's this?
- New scene. Check it out.
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?
I don't know.
I think it might make a better movie.
- I need a better storyline...
- Hey!
...and production value.
- Guys!
Hey, guys.
Martin barfed all over his locker today.
It was the grossest one yet.
- Oh, my God! Shut up!
- I never seen so many colors in my life.
So who's gonna play the wife? Jen?
No way.
I told you what she did with my top hat.
- What wife?
- Alice Dainard.
I was returning that book on codes and ciphers_
She was in the silent reading section.
And I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.
Wait.
You talked to Alice Dainard, really?
You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section.
- Shut up.
- It's for silent reading.
She said "Yes. "
We're filming tonight, and she's driving.
Driving? Driving where?
That was a really good zombie murder.
Yeah, but it's not a story yet.
Older kids are entering this film festival,
15 and 16-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value.
I've got nothing.
- Charles, dinner!
- I'm coming!
There's this article I want you to read.
It explains everything about stories.
I just don't understand how the wife helps make it a story.
Jesus, this is what I've been explaining.
That scene we're filming tonight, where the wife is telling the detective that she's scared for him, that she loves him.
I can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard.
- Charles, come on, move it.
- I'm coming!
And wash your hands this time.
So when he investigates the zombie stuff, you feel something.
You don't want him to die because they love each other.
That make sense?
Alice Dainard. That's awesome.
- You're impossible.
- Charles! Now!
God, Mom, I'm coming!
- Midnight, okay? Don't forget.
- I won't forget.
Read this.
It's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's.
Every single person will be there, except me.
Well, then every single person can tell you how it was.
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
- Mom...
- It's your turn to babysit.
Why can't I switch with Charles?
Maybe because you crushed
Charles' top hat.
You ever think of that?
Oh, really? Well, guess what?
We're switching.
Oh, really? 'Cause guess what?
No, we're not.
That's enough. Charles, take this to the table. Benji, time for dinner!
Hey, Joe.
Night, Mrs. Kaznyk.
Take a seat. We have lots of food.
No, I'm okay. Really. Thank you, though.
- Put them at the table.
- See you tomorrow, Charles.
Later days.
There's always a place for you here, Joe. You know that.
Stop it!
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Dad?
Dad?
...that possibility with an announcement that, while it is not likely, the potential is there for the ultimate risk of a meltdown at the Three Mile Island atomic power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
Robert Schakne reports from Washington.
According to the government's top...
Hey.
I'll be out in a minute.
It's a six-week program.
Hands-on training with college coaches.
You'd like it. I know I did.
I thought I was gonna have the summer for myself.
Well, things have obviously changed for us.
And it'd be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with cameras and monster make-up.
I have to help Charles finish his movie.
I've got nothing against your friends.
I like your friends.
Except for Cary, who can't seem to stop lighting things on fire.
You'd like it there.
It's what we both need.
But they offered you no real proof he was alive.
And you didn't.
The decision was made.
- So leave the past alone, Martha.
- I can't.
Well, how much would a ton of gold be worth today?
Okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Oven
I won't. Over.
You, my little pretty one, my pretty one
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
Ooh you make my motor run, my motor run
Wait, so, guys, people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right?
I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from. Jesus.
Well, technically,
Hathaway hasn't even...
Shut up.
- Was that a rock?
- I'm sorry, Smartin.
- It was a Twizzler!
- Hey, where'd it go?
Hey, guys, look.
Guys, look! Guys!
- It's okay, Smartin.
- Shut up.
Hey, Alice.
Joe Lamb?
Yeah.
What the hell's he doing here?
Make-up, sound and special effects.
He's the Deputy's kid!
- So what?
- You knew that?
Charles, I don't have a license.
I can't drive with him.
You want Joe to stay back? I guess...
It's too late!
He's seeing me in the car right now!
You can trust me.
My dad will never know.
I won't tell him anything.
Get in.
So, I wrote a couple newlines.
Can I show you?
- What?
- New lines?
Charles, do I have newlines?
Do you know what'd be great?
Is if you could cry during the scene.
Can you do that?
- I'm impressed.
- No.
You know the first place I'm gonna drive when I get my license?
- Want one?
- New Castle, Pennsylvania.
Fireworks Capital of America.
Wait, so, I don't have newlines, right?
Because I just learned these.
Guys, there's an electrical outlet up here.
Of anything, why that?
- Charles!
- Got it.
Charles, man, do I have newlines or not? Oh, no!
Well, you just lost all your newlines,
Martin.
Guys, this is going to be great!
Get the lights and camera set up on that end, we'll shoot this direction first.
Joe, get the mike plugged in and make sure that the new batteries are in the camera
- before you do the make-up.
- Okay. Okay.
I took apart two packs of cherry bombs and I made my own M-80.
Do you want to see it?
Your obsession with fireworks, and I'm saying this as a friend, concerns me and my mother.
"Sweetheart, this is my job.
I have no choice.
"It's nothing that you need to worry about.
"What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
- "Sweetheart, this is my job. "
- Martin! I wrote a newline.
- What? No.
- What do you mean "no"? It's awesome.
- Okay, so, you know that part when...
- I just finished memorizing this line.
- It's not gonna be hard...
- Do you mind?
- So, you know that part when you say...
- No.
- Well, where'd the other line go?
- It's gone. This one's better.
Here, I'll...
- No, it didn't.
- I've never even had any lines.
- I just needed this one.
- There.
Thanks.
Look, look. Look!
Now I'm not prepared!
Look, it flows better. "Honey, I love you. "
"I love you, too. " See? It flows.
I know, but you keep changing things and making it more difficult for me.
It's... Martin, it's simple.
"I love you, too. "
It's, like, four words.
My dad works at the mill.
Four words that I don't have memorized.
Martin. Can you say, "I love you"?
Could you close your eyes, please?
Yeah.
So, the scene is very emotional.
Alice, Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investigating these zombie murders.
- Yeah, I know. We read it. We get it.
- You really hate it.
God, I'm just directing.
Martin. Martin, get in position.
You need to reassure her.
Wait. Do you know what "reassure her" means?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. We're gonna shoot on Alice's side first.
Okay, Preston, so, a few seconds after I say "action,"
I want you to walk over to the pay phone.
You know, make the place look like it's busy.
- "Hello, hello?"
- I know what that looks like.
Asshole! Could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
God. Sorry, man.
Okay, you guys, let's rehearse this.
But remember, save the real performance for when we're filming.
Here we go. Positions, and action!
So, I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'd be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
Sweetheart, this is my job.
The dead coming back to life?
- I think you're in danger.
- I have no...
I have no choice.
You do have a choice.
We all do.
John,
I've never asked you to stop.
I've never asked you to give up, or walk away, but I'm asking you now.
Please.
For me.
Don't go. Don't leave me.
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you.
I just love you so much.
I love you, too.
Was that good?
Yeah. Yeah, that was... That was great.
Production value!
- Cary, you put film in the camera, right?
- I didn't put it in.
What? Put it in, put it in!
Joe, get the mike ready! Go, go, go!
- Get in costume, costume, costume!
- Okay, I will.
Joe, help her! Hurry up!
Martin, get that tripod set up!
- Preston, get in position!
- I will. I have to get the money.
Go! Get these headphones ready!
Martin, you know your lines!
- Hurry! Get that camera ready! Go, go!
- Shut up!
We'll start on Alice and pan to the train, right?
Oh, God, I hope we don't miss it!
Shut up! I am trying!
Hurry! Get that set up!
Let's go! Positions, positions!
Ready. Start filming.
Be extra loud when the train passes by.
Here we go. And action!
Look, I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'd be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
What do you want me to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
The dead coming back to life?
I think you're in danger!
I don't have a choice!
You do have a choice!
We all do!
John, I've never asked you to stop!
I've never asked you to give up or walk away!
But I'm asking you now!
Please, for me, just don't go!
Just don't go back! Don't leave me!
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you!
- I love you so much!
- I love you, too!
- Guys, watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...
- Oh, my God!
- Run!
- Oh, my God!
- Go!
Holy shit!
Go, go, go!
Alice!
Joe, let's go! We got to go!
- Keep going!
- Are we alive?
I don't want to die!
Oh, my God!
Guys.
I'm okay.
Martin, you okay?
Though I think I'm having a heart attack.
And I have a scrape.
Joe! Oh, my God!
- Guys, did you see those explosions?
- You guys seen Alice?
That was unbelievable!
- Why did this happen?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not, dude. Look at this.
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit.
What's all that blood?
What's the blood?
Did someone get hurt?
- Joe, what are you doing?
- Joe, stop!
- Don't put your hand under there!
- Joe, you don't know what's under there!
Joe!
It's my fake blood!
It's fake.
Guys?
- Come here. What are these things?
- Shit.
No one cares! Look around you!
They look like white Rubik's Cubes, or something.
I don't think that's what they are.
They don't move.
They're heavy, like metal or something.
There's like a billion of them!
What's going on?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay, all right?
- Are you serious?
You guys! Get up here.
You can see everything from up here!
Joe!
According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare.
- It wasn't an accident.
- What?
- There was a truck on the train tracks.
- Are you serious?
What, like, driving on the tracks?
There.
Oh, my gosh.
How could a pickup truck derail a train, man? That's impossible.
Obviously, it isn't.
Holy shit!
Oh, my God. I know that truck.
Guys.
Is that him?
Yeah. It's him.
- Who?
- It is. Yeah, for sure.
Who is it?
Dr. Woodward.
Dr. Woodward, the science guy?
- Biology.
- Honors Biology.
- Wow. I'm not in his class.
- We know.
Just shut up, Cary.
Remember when Old Man Woodward took your Electronic Football?
Yeah. He put it in the dungeon and never gave it back.
The dungeon?
That trailer Woodward keeps in the school parking lot.
Dr. Woodward?
Dr. Woodward?
"Map of the Contiguous United States. "
What's the writing?
Dates and times.
Guys, what's this line?
It's a schedule for the train.
What the...
He's alive. He's alive!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Holy shit.
Who are you?
Dr. Woodward, it's me.
Charles Kaznyk. From fourth period.
You've been in an accident.
You're gonna be okay.
- Back!
- Holy shit! Holy shit!
They will kill you.
Do not speak of this.
Or else you and your parents will die.
Guys, look.
- We shouldn't be here.
- Oh, my God!
- Go!
- Come on!
- Shit! Let's get the hell out of here!
- Holy shit! Run! Shit!
Guys, there are a lot of nails on the ground. Be careful.
Hurry, come on, guys!
Guys, come on!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!
Grab the film!
Guys, come on!
Move your ass! Let's go! Let's go!
- Who's got the bags?
- Get in the car!
Get in!
They're getting closer!
Come on!
- Anybody get their plates?
- I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?
All clear.
Holy shit! That was insane!
- He had a gun! An actual physical gun!
- Oh, shit!
My heart is pounding!
That train could've killed us!
Are you okay?
- Oh, shit! My camera's shattered now.
- No.
Guys, I have never had a teacher aim a gun at me!
It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling!
Guys, keep it down.
"You'll die. Your parents will die. "
Guys, this is not good information!
Oh, shit! The focus ring just fell off!
No one cares about your camera!
Guys, am I the only one shaking?
And I'm also crying!
We can't tell anyone we were there.
My dad can't find out I took his car.
Do you guys hear me?
It's okay.
We're not saying anything to anyone.
Guys!
We're not saying anything, are we?
- No.
- No.
See?
No one's going to know.
No one's saying anything.
Joe.
Thanks.
I never should have done this.
Joe. Joe, wake up.
- Make sure you let Lucy out, all right?
- Okay. I will.
What are you gonna do?
You going to be with Charles today?
Yeah. I'll be with Charles.
All right. I'm heading in.
There's something I got to deal with.
- Don't forget to get the yard.
- I will.
Mom, come on!
No! You are not wearing that.
No one in this house is wearing that.
Oh, really?
Compared to Debbie's, these are long.
Listen to your mother.
So, I can't go to Wendy's party or wear the shorts? Not fair!
Jennifer Anne, "not fair" is Africa.
Mom's racist!
- Do we have any more English muffins?
- Why don't you get up and check.
- Peg, tell the twins to stop.
- I can't, they don't listen.
- Morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Mr. Kaznyk.
Hey, Joe.
Did you hear about the train crash?
- No.
- It's on the news.
...instead opting to use military personnel, which for this reporter only adds to the mystery.
Of course, we'll have much more on this story as it develops.
Coming to you live from Montgomery
County, Channel 14 News...
Can you believe this?
No.
- It's on the news, that means it's real.
- I know.
Local teacher Thomas Woodward is still being treated by Air Force medical personnel after last night's train derailment.
Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pickup truck, which was hit by the speeding train.
- This is gross!
- Well, how about you clean it up?
That would be a great help.
Thanks so much.
...derailment, the largest such accident in Ohio's history.
The condition of Woodward, who has taught at Lillian Middle School for the past six years...
Looks like a disaster movie. Doesn't it?
Oh, my God.
Sit down!
Joe, that's awesome.
- What?
- We can use it. We can film it.
You want to go back?
- Holy shit, that's mint.
- Really?
You're a total brain.
We gotta go get the camera fixed
- and the film developed from last night.
- Okay.
I'm gonna go steal some money from my mom.
If any of the footage is usable from last night, that means we need Alice to play the wife again.
Oh, yeah. I thought she was really good.
Dude, she was mint, but she's never gonna do it.
I think She will.
There's no way.
You heard what she said.
Well, that was before the new scenes, right?
You honestly think she cares about the scenes? She was totally wigged.
Yeah, she was. We all were.
Lens is cracked.
Focus ring broke.
You think it's fixable?
I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.
The camera's busted, man. It's over.
We can use my dad's camera.
- It's got some...
- Hello?
- Hey, Alice. It's Joe Lamb.
- Hi.
So, we have some new scenes for the movie and Charles and I were hoping you'd be in them.
No. No, I'm done with that.
I need this film developed as soon as possible.
Can you do overnight?
Asshole, no one can do overnight.
You want to buy some pot?
No. No, thank you.
Well, what's the fastest you can do?
I can make it a rush.
You'll get your film back in three days.
Hey, what's your sister up to?
The hot one, not the other one.
I don't know.
I'm watching the crash on the news.
- Yeah. I saw it.
- I should go.
Wait. Hold on. Let me come over and I'll bring the scenes...
- No, no. Don't. Don't come...
- I'll be right there. It's a good idea.
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said no on the phone.
You totally did, I know that's true, but...
But now you're at my house.
I am. Which...
I don't understand how you guys can keep working on that stupid movie.
You should go.
What's this?
He was just inviting me to a party.
- Yeah?
- Good morning, Mr. Dainard.
She's not going to your party.
Yes, Sir.
You. Get out of here.
You go home and you don't come back here!
I don't want to see you.
Ally, come inside!
Ally, I'm in the kitchen.
I'll do it.
What?
Cut! That was mint!
Oh, my God. With the train...
So good!
- Joe, reload the cap gun.
- Okay.
We'll shoot another angle next.
Alice, that was mint.
Martin, go a little faster next time.
I'll try, Charles, but I'm still crying about last night, man. I feel like I'm crazy.
Guys, did it really look good?
My death?
- Dude, it looked awesome.
- That was magic.
What do you think happened?
You mean why he crashed the train?
I just got a horrible feeling.
Dude, what are you doing?
That whole thing's an Air Force train.
What?
I make models. Like, plastic ones.
You know, glue them, paint them...
- And he's not embarrassed by that.
- Look who's talking, Math Camp!
Thanks. Can I have a coffee, please?
Cream on the side.
- Sure.
- He's so sophisticated.
- Shut up. I like coffee.
- No one likes coffee.
Air Force trains, even the models, have these hooks...
They do! For when the trains are loaded on the transport ships.
Every car in that crash had hooks.
Joe, would you stop talking about it, all right?
Wait, guys.
Am I the only one who doesn't understand what any of this means?
- Probably, Smartin.
- Cary, shut up.
- You shut up.
- I don't like it when you call me that.
I'm sorry, Smartin.
Let's just go cry about it.
Dr. Woodward had that map.
He drove onto the train tracks.
Maybe there was something he wanted to...
- To destroy, yeah!
- My God, will you guys just shut up?
Maybe he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself.
That's a dumb idea.
He had a gun. Why not use that?
There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide. Pills, hanging...
Pussy! Stop taking the fries away.
- I ordered these for a reason.
- Excuse me.
Could we get another order of fries?
Because my friend here is fat.
Funny, chompers. At least I don't have to use a booster seat.
You could jump from a building.
- Or fall down some stairs.
- Well, that's not really effective.
If it's the Air Force, what would the Air Force have on the train?
Jesus, shut up about it.
You heard what Old Man Woodward said, we can't talk about this.
Joe, seriously.
Do you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too?
All right, easy, easy!
- It's loaded. Move out.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, Deputy. I'm told this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion.
Well, as you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened, as well as how to help you.
It's all under control.
It'll be a very fast clean-up.
Colonel, there isn't anything that I should know, is there?
Not that I can think of, Deputy.
I understand you have concerns about our cargo.
Well, I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
Well, that's not gonna be possible.
Colonel, I've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna wanna know what's taking place.
Which town is that?
Lillian.
Deputy, if you're asking me if we had any dangerous properly on board this train,
I can assure you the answer is "No. "
Colonel!
Excuse me.
They gave me the runaround for two hours before they allowed me to talk to anyone.
I'd say they've had their hands full, Jack.
Nelec, the Colonel, refused to show me the manifest.
He told me they're carrying mostly airplane parts. I don't buy that.
It's Air Force, Jack.
Airplane parts sort of make sense.
Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's something else going on.
They're taking molds of tire tracks.
Why would they be doing that?
Who would they be looking for?
And they're packaging these weird little cubes into these crates.
Weird little cubes?
Yeah, they're loading them onto these red trucks. There are dozens of them.
Sheriff, I think you need to go check it out.
And I think you need to take a break.
Jack, I've been telling you this since Elizabeth.
You're a good deputy, but you need to take a vacation.
Go home. Take off the uniform.
Go fishing. Give your son a hug.
Hey, Breen, I'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio.
Breen!
Hey, Sheriff.
What's that?
Walkman. It's like a stereo.
Play your own cassette tapes.
You want to try?
I don't think so.
Kids walking around with their own stereos, just what we need.
It's a slippery slope, my friend.
Yes, Sir.
Sheriff?
Sheriff?
You know, in scene... Where is it?
Where'd you learn to do this?
Mostly the Dick Smith
Monster Make-up Handbook.
Hey, Joe. We need some more footage of the train crash.
Obviously.
You know that train model you just made?
- Your cargo train.
- I want to blow it up and film it.
Let me blow it up.
Yeah. Sure.
- Mint!
- Gnarly! Yes!
Here, take this, will you?
It's fine. They can blow it up.
I don't care.
You want to see it? The train?
My train model? The train I made?
Dude, that's bitching.
Dude, that's like the third time it's happened.
What the hell?
So how am I supposed to be a zombie?
Pretty much just be a lifeless ghoul, with no soul. Dead eyes.
Scary. Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
- For English? Yeah.
- Yeah.
Kind of like her, but hungry for human flesh.
Like she wants to turn somebody into a zombie.
'Cause that's Kind of what zombies do.
Oh, my God, yeah. That's really good.
Not bad.
- Really?
- Really.
Careful! There was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel I lost.
You don't seem to be asking very many questions.
Give the man some time, Mr. Blakely.
- He's only a deputy, he's not the Sheriff.
- Doesn't matter.
I think this is most likely a bear attack.
Security cameras showed nothing.
Someone had erased...
Vicky, you heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?
Negative. Still no word.
Vicky, you need to have Dayton send a C.S. Unit out to Edie's, and you put an A.P.B. Out on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell, and send units over to their houses immediately. You copy all that?
Copy. And, Jack, we 're getting a lot of unusual calls.
What kinds of unusual calls?
I've never seen this kind of thing before.
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do?
The insurance company guy thought I was joking with him.
Look at my Bonneville over here!
They'd have to have a winch to take that out.
You been having any troubles with anyone lately, Izzy?
Well, I was thinking you should talk to Louis Dainard.
Yeah. I didn't help him out with financing last year, and I wouldn't be surprised if this was some sort of sick retribution.
- My generator is missing.
- The phones aren't working.
- My dog's gone. Disappeared.
- The phones won't produce a signal.
Call the station and file a report.
I'll have someone come out and take care of each one of you. Okay?
Lucy!
Lucy!
I got four guys on this case...
People don't feel safe around here.
You know why? Because they're not.
We need to get the National Guard...
Air Force hasn't answered a damn question.
They've got trucks over at
Woodward's house.
Now, Ben heard they were looking for Woodward's research.
Research? What the hell?
...shotgun in one of those trucks, he had, like, a scanner in his hand.
Like a Geiger counter.
They're saying it's just clean up at the crash site, too, but they're taking molds of tire tracks.
That means they're looking for someone. Now what does that mean?
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?
No. I'm sure she's around somewhere.
I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there.
I ate those.
- Sorry, kid.
- Yeah, no problem. I'll find something.
- Hey!
- You got to be kidding.
Pick that up, will you?
Hey, Vicky, you got power down at the station?
On and off
And Brook County's in the dark.
Do me a favor and get Water & Power out there right now, will you?
So, the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad's car.
They're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over.
I don't want to hear about it.
This is what I've been talking about.
They could be monitoring us right now.
Jesus, shut up. Over.
And the military is at Woodward's house looking for his research.
Whatever that means.
You cannot flake out on me and be a dick.
Are you gonna come and help me tomorrow or not?
I need you to make Alice a zombie again.
Okay. I'll do the make-up.
Oven
The cables are gone-
All the poles are empty.
Same thing over here in Rose Hill.
Somebody took the damn wires down.
Holy shit!
Hey, Rooney, you got anything in Lillian?
Hey, Rooney, you copy?
We got a half mile of copper missing.
Lines are back up at M-38.
Truck 14, Rooney's out at the junkyard.
I'll give you an update when I hear back.
I wanna know who took them.
Twenty microwaves gone from my inventory.
Everywhere you look, things are going missing.
We've got trains crashing, people vanishing.
Belmont County's without power.
You know what this feels like to me?
This feels like a Russian invasion.
Debbie, I don't think that the Russians have anything to do with what's going on in town.
But I am calling the curfew because of these exact concerns.
Unless you can tell me who's been messing around with our stuff,
I say it's the Soviets.
I like you, Jack, but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
We've got good people working on that.
Mr. McCandless.
Since Wednesday morning, my ham radio is a mess!
Some frequencies which I like to scan,
I'm hearing military chatter, but it's distorted.
And I don't know what it is.
Have you heard that?
Mr. McCandless, can I have a word with you in private, please?
It was like having my radio hijacked.
I'm sure that must be very annoying.
You don't know those frequencies offhand, do you?
Sure I do. 13-2-0-1...
Patty, why don't you get in touch with Vicky.
Hey, Dave, you seen Milner?
No, sir. I haven't.
Jack, there's a huge sinkhole by my garage!
- It sunk almost a foot!
- I'll take care of that.
Hey, Tom. Tom! You seen Milner?
Have you tried his office?
Have I tried his office?
What are you gonna do about the power? It's been out for two days.
Hey, Rosko.
Rosko. I need you to get every radio we have and you tune them to those frequencies.
- Understand?
- No.
- Hey, Milner.
- Yeah.
Don't you have a radio scanner with a descrambler?
- A voice inverter, yeah, at home.
- Whatever. Get it.
Bring it down here and set it up for me.
Would you please?
- Sure thing.
- Jack, what is this?
I think the Air Force is using unassigned channels...
Hey. He was at my house yesterday morning. You aware of that?
We brought him in for the car lot and other stuff. He's clean.
Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd inform your son that my house is off-limits.
And so is my daughter.
I think the make-up was better yesterday.
No, it's good.
I think it looks good.
I should've cleaned up my room.
Did you make all these models?
Yeah. That one is the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
We watched that one on TV.
This is the train they want to destroy.
Looks real.
It looks so old.
Yeah, that's dry brush technique.
It's when there's a coat of paint and then you put something like Euro Gray over it.
Euro Gray?
Oh, my God, there's like
14 different grays. It gets crazy.
What was that necklace?
The one you were holding at the train crash.
Was it your mom's?
My dad gave it to her the day I was born.
She wears it all the time.
Well, used to.
And...
It was bad how she died and...
But my dad got it back.
Guys, what the hell?
No one knew where you were!
We're here.
- You got to play the soldier.
- I thought you were calling Evan.
Evan blew us off. He's a pussy!
Excuse me.
It's okay.
You got to do it. You're the only one.
Well, what the hell you mean they found my dog in Brookville?
That's another county over!
Lucy. That's where she is.
I mean, we've got nearly 30 calls from people who found local dogs, but the thing is the calls coming in aren't local.
It's like they all just ran away in every direction.
This isn't like her, she just doesn't disappear.
Okay, okay, calm down.
Just tell me what she looks like.
She's got dark hair. It was in rollers.
Do you know what rollers are?
- Yes, I know what rollers are.
- Okay, so...
Hang on.
Negative, unable to recover data.
That's definitely Air Force.
Yeah, it's Air Force, but what does it mean?
What are they doing transmitting on these frequencies?
- Maybe it's not even Air Force.
- I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.
- Five bucks?
- Yeah.
We're gonna need units to prepare for
Operation Walking Distance.
What did he say? "Operation" what?
"Walking Distance. "
What's this?
He worked at Romero Chemical.
Found out some things the company was doing.
And after what you told me last night at the bar, I thought you should know.
Are we gonna get in trouble for being here?
Production value.
Stop talking about production value.
I think the Air Force is gonna kill us.
- Cary.
- Don't cover my mouth!
We just made this discovery today.
You understand this is top secret?
Of course.
I would never have given you this information unless we had worked together in Vietnam.
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
Understood.
- You're a good friend.
- You, too.
Nothing so far.
- How much more is there?
- About 60 more boxes in the basement.
What, more tax returns?
It's here somewhere. We'll find it. If not,
Woodward will tell us where it is.
What the hell is that?
Joe.
Hey, Mr. Lamb.
Get in the car.
Mr. Lamb, that's your camera, but, technically, that's my film.
What the hell?
Is it me?
I would like to help you out, Deputy,
I really would, but we operate on a need-to-know basis.
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?
We will be out of your way shortly.
All right, then I'm sure you won't mind me contacting D.C.
Talk to some friends about
"Walking Distance. "
All right, we'll do it that way.
Deputy! Let's talk.
Just not here.
This is new, all of this, for the both of us.
Dealing with anything. Just us.
So, I'm gonna make this as simple and as clear as I can.
You're not friends with Alice Dainard.
When I say "No," I don't mean "Maybe. "
I don't mean "Yes. "
I mean "No. "
I've known Louis Dainard for a lot of years. He's been nothing but trouble.
Your mother used to say he's not such a bad guy.
He just needs a chance, that he was sad.
Well, I tried to be good to him.
And I can't, not anymore.
I will not allow him or his daughter in this house.
I will not allow you to spend time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you do. That's it.
I hope we're clear on that.
We're not clear.
What'd you say?
We're not clear.
You and I aren't clear about anything.
We couldn't be less clear.
Just because Mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me. You don't.
You don't know anything about
Alice, either. She's kind.
We're not gonna have this discussion right now.
- She's nice to me!
- I don't care what she is!
Her father is an irresponsible, selfish son of a bitch.
You listen to me.
I've got 12,000 people in this town who are scared out of their mind.
They've got one person to rely on.
It used to be someone else, but now it's just me.
Move, move!
Let's go. Move!
Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car
I'm here to see Colonel Nelec!
He told me to meet him here.
You're under military arrest.
Drop your weapons.
Where's Nelec?
I don't want any more trouble, do you?
We've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence.
What you knew. How you knew it.
Who else might know.
I remember you in the lab.
And I recall we didn't always see eye to eye, but that is no excuse for doing what you did here.
So, in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, why don't you just tell me where you put your research and who else knows about it.
I know you had someone document the crash that night.
Tell me who that was and I will help you.
I swear to God on my mother's life, if you help us now, we will take care of you.
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
- when you take care of people.
- It is mine.
He is mine.
I'm gonna bait him and catch him.
He's in me, you know.
As I am in him.
So, when you see him next, as I'm sure you will,
I'll be watching you, too.
Are you... Were you sleeping?
Before. Earlier. No.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You want to come in?
Yeah.
Power's still out.
Room's still messy.
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking.
I wanted to tell you something before tomorrow.
Don't let Charles blow up your train.
I don't think it's right.
I know he's your friend.
He's so bossy.
But I've known him since kindergarten.
He's really nice.
He shouldn't always get what he wants.
I mean, who always gets what they want?
I know I don't know you at all.
Even though it sort of feels like I do.
Do you not feel like that?
No. No, I totally do.
I'm just kind of in shock at this entire conversation.
Power's back.
No, no. Keep it.
It's... it's so weird.
Watching her like this.
Like she's still here.
She used to look at me this way, like really look, and I just knew I was there, that I existed.
He drank that morning.
My dad.
He missed his shift.
Your mom took it for him, the day of the accident.
He...
He...
He... He wishes...
I know he wishes it was him instead of her.
And sometimes I do, too.
Don't say that.
He's your dad.
Is... Is this normal?
No. This is new.
Want to tell me where you were?
Or should I tell you?
Sit down.
I should go to bed.
I want to talk to you. I said sit down.
I don't want to sit down!
Then go.
Be just like your mother and leave.
Dad...
Go ahead! Go!
Go!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Wait!
Ally, I'm sorry!
Alice!
Ally!
Alice!
Ally!
Ally!
Firelight at 0500 hours.
Operation Walking Distance is in effect.
T- minus four hours to evacuation.
Evacuation in T-minus four hours.
Why are you not reacting?
That thing went through my wall!
I told you not to pick it up in the first place.
What are you so angry about? That I'm not gonna let you blow up my train?
That's part of it. Just a part.
Hey. Tell your sister that Donny from Olsen's broke up with Karen.
That shit ended about a week ago.
What's your problem?
My whole movie's a disaster because of you.
- I know my dad's being a turkey.
- Whatever.
- We're still gonna finish your movie.
- It's not about the movie.
What are you talking about?
Of course it is!
Just forget it.
Why? There's nothing wrong!
We're gonna finish the movie!
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.
We can still make the festival.
- It's not about the movie.
- Then what is it about?
Jesus, you don't get it, do you?
It's obvious.
- What's obvious?
- God, you're a dumbass.
That night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
- What? What are you talking about?
- Like Mr. Attitude, all of a sudden.
Your movie was over!
That's what you said! You were upset!
- Oh, my God.
- I gave you a camera! I helped you!
Don't pretend like you did this for me.
You didn't do this for me, and you know it.
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice!
Action!
I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it's safer if you leave town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case- These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do...
Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie.
Not so you could fall in love with her.
What do you care what I think about Alice anyway?
Because I like her!
That's why I asked her to do this thing in the first place, so I could get to know her. Not you!
- You like Alice Dainard?
- You're such an idiot!
- Watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...
- Oh, my God! Shit!
- Run!
Shit. Look at all that smoke.
I can't use this.
You won't even let me blow up your train.
Everything's bogus.
We could make another train and blow that one up.
I do like her.
- Sorry about that.
- Shut up.
It's okay.
That's not even what bothers me.
She likes you, too.
That's what really bothers me.
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?
I haven't leaned out yet and the doctor says it's gonna happen.
I don't know. Everything's just so bogus.
Charles.
Joe, what the hell?
What is that?
What is that?
- Mr. Harkin! What's going on?
- Evacuation! The fire!
Wait, wait!
The county is being evacuated due to a wildfire that is raging out of control, and threatening to reach the Lillian chemical plant.
Please take with you essential items only.
If you are driving your own vehicle, follow the Cara van to the evacuation center:
Please remain calm.
File in.
File in, please, file in.
- Corporal.
- I left the medication my wife needs.
Sir, the town is sealed off.
No one's allowed in.
- H through N.
- I can't get it anywhere else.
Charles!
Excuse me.
Charles, oh, thank God.
I went back to the house and you were gone.
Yeah, they put us on the bus.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey. I'm gonna find my dad.
- You gonna tell him about that huge...
- Yes.
Come back if you can't find him!
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb.
I know you don't like me and I'm sorry about that, but I'm looking for my dad.
It took her.
- It took Alice.
- What?
I saw it. It was big.
And, I don't know, it was something
I've never... I've never...
No one believes me.
They just keep giving me pills and...
No one believes me.
I believe you.
That thing took her?
We have to go back to town to find Alice, to find her. Come on, guys.
- Dude, she's dead. Alice is dead...
- Don't say that!
First of all, I want to live. Okay?
Joe, what do you actually expect to do, man?
The town's closed.
We're not allowed to go back.
Look, I have an idea.
I'm going whether or not you come, which I really hope you do.
Come on, guys.
I have six tons of explosives in this thing.
Let's find that thing and blow it to shit!
As if I'm gonna help you.
Do this for me,
I'll babysit the twins next week, so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.
I'm not shitting you.
You can't ask me any questions, though, and you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious. Nobody.
Does it have to be him?
Yes or no, you ugly freak!
I'm about to rescind the offer.
This whole evacuation thing's really freaking me out.
Making me rethink my priorities.
Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back.
We... We totally could.
I asked Charles about you and he said you're a great guy.
I totally am.
Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor?
So, there are rules to being in my car, okay?
Where the hell are we going, anyway?
We're going to go to the school and open the trailer
Woodward has in the parking lot.
I bet that...
I bet that's where he's keeping his research.
Research. What research?
We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing, so that we can find it and that's how we're gonna save Alice.
Come on. Let's go!
Dorks, no shoes on my upholstery.
And no one touches my C.B.
- You got it?
- The dungeon? Are you serious?
Why else are there six padlocks on the door?
We're going to the school.
Since when did this one become so bossy?
I don't know.
I got to take a leak! What am
I supposed to do, piss in here?
Thanks for the hospitality.
Am I gonna go in alone, or are you gonna end up coming with...
...driving your own vehicle, follow the Cara van to the evacuation center:
If the Air Force has already searched
Woodward's house, wouldn't they have searched stuff in the schoolroom, too?
Yeah, man, I was just thinking about that, too.
Maybe his room, but not the dungeon.
Woodward keeps all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
Shut up!
So, what kind of music does she like, your sister?
I don't care. Disco, I guess.
I can get back into disco.
We shouldn't take River Road, they put a roadblock up.
Dork, I saw it. Observe.
So, what, I just wait here like a douche?
Yes. Thank you so much for doing this.
Do you have a tire iron?
Joe, let me try! Joe, let me try!
God, I hope my Electronic Football is in there.
Joe, this is impossible, man.
There's no way we can do this.
These things are made like a bank vault, like a safe.
Professional robbers can't even get in through these things. They're so...
Shit!
I loosened it for you.
- Guys.
- Look at all this junk!
He's got movies in here.
I can't believe we're breaking into the school!
Who does that? Nobody does that!
Idiots do that!
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellie Air Force Base in 1963 because of
"subversive conduct," whatever that is.
Charles, check it out.
It's Old Man Woodward.
Back when he was like
Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
He's been tracking this thing since 1958.
What is this?
It says, "April 8th, 1963 incident. "
I don't know.
- Cary!
- What?
We have to find this thing. Come on!
Okay. Sorry.
...told them that this creature is more sophisticated than any of us, that his species is predominantly subterranean.
- Subterranean.
- And that he is being treated without compassion or respect.
I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship, a craft made up of those cubes, a complex shape-shifting alloy.
Remarkable material that we'll never fully understand.
He has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in '58-
But instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner
- Guys, it's Dr. Woodward!
- He's been restrained and experimented upon, biopsied, and tortured by Nelec.
Through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all.
We have turned him into an enemy.
I told them I knew these things because he made Contact with me, that he makes a psychic connection by touch.
Oh, my God!
- What is that thing?
- What the hell?
- I can't watch this.
- Martin, you're gonna throw up, man.
The moment we made contact,
I understood him, and he me.
What I know is that if we don't change this and begin helping him, we will all pay the price.
But Nelec won't listen.
He wasn't trying to kill it.
He'll have me discharged.
He was trying to help it escape.
But I won't give up.
I will do everything in my power
- to set him free.
- Oh, my God.
- You guys hear that?
- Help him rebuild that ship. I won't...
Freeze! Nobody move!
Do not move!
We got positive I.D. Here.
It's just a bunch of kids.
Oh, Shit.
Search them.
Let me see that.
I rolled those M-80s myself.
- That's right.
- Jesus, Cary, shut up.
You're the Deputy's boy.
No.
Move out!
Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit.
Breaker, breaker.
Requesting police backup.
Breaker 1-9. Is this the police channel?
- Staff Sergeant.
- Hi. How are you doing?
Hey, Mr. Lamb!
Rosko.
Hey. Where the hell have you been?
- What are you wearing?
- Come here.
The Air Force set that fire. They want the town empty for some reason.
This whole operation, this whole military operation, the evacuation, everything, it's all bad.
- We need to find...
- Did you hear about Joe?
Look, dispatch just got a call on citizens' band.
Joe and some of his friends, they were grabbed by military personnel at the middle school.
Preston, you tell me everything, and I won't throw you in jail.
Yes, sir.
But I think you should look at this first.
Chief Master Sergeant,
Dustoff-03 is 20 minutes out.
Roger that. Perimeter secure. Standing by on lookout. Prepare to engage.
Teams Kilo-Lima-Mike-November in position.
Teams Oscar-Foxtrot-Quebec-Romeo in position.
Cocked and locked. Ready to go.
What's going to happen to us?
I think we're gonna die.
Cary, shut up, man.
They wouldn't do that.
I'm not kidding.
I think they're gonna kill us.
They're not gonna kill us.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because we're just...
Hold on!
Hold on!
Was that that thing from the train?
Why are we stopping?
- Why are we stopped?
- Holy shit!
Contact with precious cargo, three clicks from city center.
Currently heading towards...
- Driver! Can you see anything up there?
- No, sir! Nothing.
What's that gun?
Sako Bolt Action thirty-aught six with...
Okay, we get it.
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.
Here. Tag it.
Yes, Sir.
Open the door!
I don't feel good about this.
Sir, is there a particular area that you'd want me to shoot...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Help!
Oh, my God!
Get us out of here now!
What other firepower do we have?
- There's a monster out there, Joe!
- What the hell is it?
I got it, sir!
- Guys, the seat belt is killing me!
- Unhook it!
Come on!
Come on!
This is Nelec. Use the big guns.
Whatever happens to me, do not let it...
- Joe, open it!
- Open the door!
- It's bolted!
- I want to go home so bad!
Open the door.
- Please, sir.
- Just let us out!
Please open it!
Where are the keys?
Overmyer had them!
Help me! My leg's stuck!
Please, sir, open the door!
Please, open the door!
Another one dead!
Guys, there's broken glass.
Guys!
Martin! Martin!
Let me get on your shoulders. Come on.
Go, go, get up!
- Here we go.
- Go!
- Come on, Joe! You can do it!
- Come on, Joe!
- You can do it, Joe! Let's go.
- Come on!
- Come on!
- You can do it! Come on!
Joe, please! Go!
- Come on. Break the glass, you pussy!
- Come on, Joe! Hit it! Come on!
We got to go!
- Go!
- Come on, guys, hurry!
Come with us. We got some questions for you. Come on.
- Oh, no. Is she dead?
- Just come with us.
Hey, fellows,
I've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally deliver this man back to base.
- He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
- Let's go.
What are you doing?
Where are we going?
To find our kids.
Hey, guys! Guys, I found them!
Hey, guys! I found my firecrackers!
Congratulations.
Let's go, guys, they're coming back.
I think we should go. Come on.
Guys, come on.
No. No, look.
You dorks are alive? I thought that...
What the fuck?
Donny. Donny.
We need a ride into town.
Okay, but just so you know,
I'm massively stoned right now.
Do you want me to drive?
- Guys, what was that?
- It sounds like gunshots.
- Joe, where are we going?
- I saw something in the cemetery.
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.
What the hell is that?
Move the damn car!
- God!
- Joe, turn the car around!
- I can't. There's a tank behind us.
- Holy shit!
- What are they shooting at?
- Guys, we have to run.
Donny! Hey, Donny, wake up!
- He's too stoned!
- Drugs are so bad!
- Why is everyone firing?
- We gotta go!
Guys, come on, hurry!
- This is crazy!
- What is going on?
Look! It just exploded!
Sir! The weapons are misfiring!
All of them!
Surface-to-air! Radar!
It's a mess out here, sir!
Guys! Guys, run!
Come on!
What the hell is this?
Go, Cary, go!
- Jesus!
- Go!
What the hell?
Holy shit!
Why is everyone firing?
Go, come on!
Move ahead!
Oh, my God!
Come on, guys, move!
Did you guys see those explosions?
They were... They were huge!
Oh, my God.
Whose house is this?
It's Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
Kathy? Yeah, I know her.
Charles, what are you thinking, dude?
That's not yours!
What, I'm thirsty. I'm in a war zone!
- Clear! Clear!
- Come on, move!
Let's go, move out!
- Guys, come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?
To the cemetery. I'm...
Guys, what happened to my leg?
Man, it hurts!
Holy shit, Martin, you've got a bone sticking out of your leg!
Joe, give me that thing off the curtains!
God!
I've got to go find Alice.
You guys stay here with Martin.
You gonna be okay without me?
Yeah.
- I'm not staying with the girls!
- God, Cary! Shut up!
- Calm down!
- Come on! Come on!
It hurts, Joe!
Okay, this is going to hurt really bad, okay?
Jesus, Martin, I haven't done it yet!
Just... Just follow me. Just follow me.
I've been following you for the last five blocks! What are we doing here?
Come on, through these doors.
Help me.
- Help you with what?
- We have to get inside.
Okay, okay. For what?
I'll tell you in a second.
Why is there dirt in these windows?
It's here. Hard on three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
This... This is scary.
You got any sparklers in there?
Are you kidding me?
Alice is down there.
I came to your house that day to tell you that
I never meant to hurt anyone.
I swear to God.
I'm sorry, Jack.
About what happened to your wife.
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
Joe, I don't understand...
This way.
Why are you so surprised?
I always wear lipstick on my shirt.
- It's Sheriff Pruitt!
- I know.
Cary, look.
There are bodies everywhere.
- What is this?
- We're under the water tower. Look.
She's got to be here.
She's got to be here.
It's eating a person.
She's here.
Oh, my God. I see her.
Okay.
We're going to use your firecrackers.
I don't think that's gonna hurt him, Joe.
- There's other tunnels.
- So?
I need you to make noise right here in two minutes.
Make it loud and make it last.
Give me some sparklers.
Make sure you're gone when it blows.
You can't be here. You got to run.
Where are you going?
Come on, Cary.
Alice. Alice. Please, we have to go.
Come on.
Alice! Alice!
Please, come on.
We have to go. Alice!
You're alive! You're alive.
You're alive. Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
What is this? What are you doing here?
I'm just doing the best I can to save you.
How did you know?
Your dad. He told me. He was worried.
And flipping out.
- Really?
- We have to move.
Excuse me?
Where are we?
I left my bag in the car, and then I went out to the car to get my bag...
It's been locked up for years.
It's terrified and hungry and it just wants to go home.
When it touched me, I knew.
I need you to help me get the Sheriff down.
Follow me this way.
I'll get us out of here.
- Sheriff, we came that way.
- Don't argue with me! Just follow me!
Come on, kids, let's go with the Sheriff.
This way.
Joe!
I told you to get out!
What are you doing here?
I thought this was the way out.
Okay, I tried.
- Hey, Alice, welcome back.
- Hey!
Come on! We got to get out of here...
Guys, hurry!
Come on, go!
She's gone! It took her!
I don't want to be next!
- Go! You don't want to be here! Go!
- Joe, what are you doing?
Ally, what the hell is he doing?
We understand!
But not everyone's horrible.
- No!
- Joe!
Let him down!
I know bad things happen.
Bad things happen.
But you can still live.
You can still live.
Okay, wait a minute.
What?
- Look out!
- Get down! Get down!
What is he doing?
He's making a model.
I got you.
I got you.
Holy shit!
This is where my friend was attacked.
- By who?
- I've never seen him before.
He looked pale, crazy. He bit my friend.
- Then what happened?
- He was dead.
- And then...
- He got up and walked away?
- How did you know?
- Anything left behind?
Yes, this fell out of the pocket of the attacker's pocket.
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. President.
I'm Detective Hathaway.
I'm here to discuss some urgent matters regarding your chemical factory.
Are you referring to the recent incidents?
Yes, I believe I am.
Tell the chairman I'll call him back.
You have three minutes.
You want to tell me about those employees?
I was sorry to hear of their unfortunate accident.
That was no accident!
Did you see the bites on their neck?
Are you suggesting some connection between my chemical company and those, those...
Those were zombie attacks!
Romero Chemical has nothing to do with any such thing.
Then what happens in Building 47?
You wouldn't mind if I took a look around, would you?
Of course not.
Good day to you, Mr. President.
Good day, Detective.
He knows.
Judith. It's me, your boss.
I need you to buy my wife a ticket to Michigan.
It's too dangerous for her here.
I just love her so much.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
Sweetheart, this is my job.
I just love you so much!
I love you, too.
I can't believe we weren't killed last night.
Okay, now you have to leave town.
No. I'm staying here with you.
I don't know what I would do if something happened to you.
What if there are survivors down there?
There were no survivors!
Did you see that crash?
Excuse me, sir, were you in the wreck?
That settles it. I'm not going anywhere.
It's been two weeks, and the murders continue.
This investigation is like no other.
It's putting too much stress on this town and on my marriage.
Could zombies be real?
Hello? This is Detective Hathaway.
I'll be right over.
- What's happening here?
- A military police investigation.
It was a suicide.
- A suicide? Who was it?
- A former Air Force officer.
Said there was a secret he couldn't keep any longer.
It says he worked for Dr. Peter Braken?
I never would have given you this information if we hadn't served together in Vietnam.
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Doctor.
- Detective.
I'm here to discuss your involvement with Romero Chemical?
I was the one that developed the special compound to turn all these humans into zombies.
It was supposed to be used as a military weapon, but it got out of hand.
So I made this antidote that will hopefully cure all of the zombies.
That's incredible!
How much have you made?
Just this one.
Would you like to help me test it on this innocent victim of my creation?
Honey, I'm home!
Good news. We found a cure for the zombie infection.
Honey?
Sorry. It didn't work. I wish it worked.
I tried. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
John?
This has been a Charles Kaznyk production.
We had such a fun time filming this movie, The Case.
So much fun that I hope you pick it for the Cleveland International
Super 8 Film Festival.
God!
Answer me, Lord
Answer me, Lord
- Wow.
- Sit down.
Thanks.
How was your night?
Good. How was yours?
Good.
This is great.
Your shift's at 8.30?
- You're not eating?
- I already did.
You OK?
Are you going to go with me to Cindy and Bill's this weekend?
Sure. What time?
For the baby shower?
Right.
I don't want to go.
You don't?
I want Cindy and Bill to come here.
Cindy and Bill are welcome here whenever they want.
Henry.
Don't you think it's time?
You're talking about kids.
Of course I am.
- OK.
- "OK", you want kids?
I love kids.
Henry, do you still love me?
Of course I do.
Cos I know that you used to.
What happened?
Henry Torne.
Eddie Vibes.
So how you been?
I'm OK. What's going on?
Ah, we got a man down here.
I was wondering if we could come in for a second.
Joe! Joe. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh.
- You feel really hot.
- I'm sorry.
Come with me.
Just get right to the back.
- Straight back to the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.
- Goddamn sausages at Pinwheels.
- Yeah?
So, er... we're in a bit of a bind here, Henry.
We got a big play-off game in the next half-hour and buddy boy there's our first baseman.
But as you can see, he's not exactly game-ready.
So what do you say?
Feel like playing a little ball?
It's November.
Yeah. They keep the field in pretty good shape.
Oh.
Oh, God. OK. OK.
So what do you say?
Henry?
So where's this game?
Near Kaisertown, about er... 15 minutes away.
Appreciate you driving, Torne.
Sure.
Just pull over here.
Stop and get some beer money at the ATM.
Good.
So, er... hang tight.
We'll be right back.
Keep the engine running, OK?
- Le petit café, Frank.
- Merci, merci.
- A bientôt, Pierre.
- A demain, Frank.
Hey, you! Freeze!
Freeze!
We know this wasn't your deal, Torne.
These people aren't your friends.
Why stick up for 'em?
You got a wife, you got a job.
Don't you care?
You're looking at three to seven, Henry.
All you gotta do is say something.
The court sentences Henry Torne to three years in prison for the crime of
Felony First-Degree Armed Robbery.
Hey. Excuse me.
I'm Max.
- Henry.
- Henry, good.
Um... what are you in for?
- What?
- What are you in for?
Bank robbery.
Nice. Clean, simple. I like it.
- I didn't do it.
- No, of course not.
Mistaken identity.
What are you in for?
Life.
Just...
Put it anywhere. It doesn't matter.
It's not like you got much choice.
Come on, hurry up, it's breakfast.
Come on.
Monday is wholewheat bun day.
What are you thinking?
- Nothing.
- You can't be thinking nothing.
Let me guess. You're thinking,
"How in hell did I get here?"
How do you think we all got here?
I don't know.
We committed crimes, Henry.
But we committed to the wrong thing.
See, that was a mistake.
We never fulfilled our potential.
See this guy here in the middle?
Don't stare at him.
Name's Hector.
He wanted to be a doctor.
Thanks.
And he could have been a good one.
Well, good or bad, I don't know.
But he chose not to fulfill his potential. Now look at him.
So I'm talking about bad choices.
I recommend these potatoes.
They're really terrific.
Give him a little extra, please, Charlie. Thank you.
See, the real crime is not committing to your dream.
What is yours, anyway?
- My what?
- Your dream.
Not sure I ever had one.
Never had a dream?
I mean, what kinda life's that?
I don't know. A pretty good one.
Hm.
I don't er... mean any offense, Henry, but you're in jail.
Are you going to eat the rest of this wholewheat?
- No.
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
I'm OK.
How about you?
I'm good.
You look beautiful.
Henry...
..there's something
I have to talk to you about.
OK.
I fell in love.
Oh.
I just... I mean, it just happened.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- You're not mad?
No.
I want you to be happy.
Hey, Max, when's your next review?
November.
Show us what you did last time for the board.
I'm working. Stop.
- What? One time.
- Come on, show us.
- Show us!
- Leave me alone, OK?
- Just once, come on.
- Come on!
Pain in the ass. All right.
So last time, um... I'm sitting there, and um... the Head of the Board comes and says,
"OK, Max, what are you going to do for us this time if we let you out?"
I get the old twitch working, and I go...
"Well, um...
"I'm going to break into your house
"and then I'll kill your dog and set the house on fire.
"Then I'll dance through your garden
"naked like some mad, crazed werewolf.
"And I'll bite and I'll mangle
"and I'll tear the tongue out of everything that's breathing.
"Then I'll hurl myself into the sky,
"the ethereal sky, flaming,
"like God's darkest angel.
"And I'll explode into a goddamn heavenly fireball.
"Boom.
"Boom! You guys wanna see this?
"I can't wait. Boom."
What? What?
You scared the shit out of me,
I tell you.
Well, believe me,
I ain't going anywhere, thank God.
When's your review coming up?
- Next month.
- You gonna twitch like your cellie?
- Nope.
- You don't like it around here
Everyone knows Henry's innocent
Board doesn't like you denying it.
- I didn't do the crime.
- But you got the time.
So you might as well have done it.
I kinda like that.
That's funny, know what I mean?
If you did the time, you might as well have done the crime. It's cute.
You're cute too, kid.
Get up. You're finished.
- Get out of here.
- Thanks, Max.
You never did tell me what your dream was, Max.
What?
You never told me your dream.
- I'm living it.
- Really?
Well, yeah.
I mean, it's easy, living in here.
I got nothing to prove, all you really gotta do is show up and they even do that for you.
So, er... it's nice. It's good, yeah.
This place is horrible, Max.
Well, that makes me wonder why er... Why didn't you ever talk?
- When?
- Back then. When you had the chance.
I mean, why?
I felt maybe this was my way out.
Oh. Was it?
Yeah.
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean?
I mean bullshit. Nothing's changed.
I mean, whether you're out there or you're here...
..the truth is, Henry, you're still the same guy.
Sorry.
Have you got everything, kid?
Hey, Max, maybe you should think about getting out of here.
Listen. The only thing I ever missed in 23 years is maybe a hot bath.
To tell the truth, I don't think that's worth walking out of here for.
Torne, let's go.
I hope I never see you again.
Henry.
Hey.
Hey, Debbie, Henry's here.
- Come in. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.
Don't mind me.
I'm just setting up for my meeting.
Hey, you want a beer?
- Sure.
- Honey, mind getting Henry a beer?
Hi.
Hi.
I know.
That's everything you wanted.
Thanks.
- Are you happy?
- I am.
I'm glad.
What are you gonna do now?
Honey, they're starting to arrive.
Maybe you'd be interested, Henry.
You could be a Jin Chi distributor.
It's Korean kitchenware, the future of food storage.
Plus if you recruit distributors you get paid even more.
- You mean like a pyramid scheme?
- No. Not... No. Not...
It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm.
Anyway, give it some thought.
Listen, Henry, I just wanted to say thank you, you know.
For what?
For not giving up my name.
- I don't know your name.
- Sure you do. It's Joe.
You're welcome, Joe.
I'll see you, Deb.
..with as much as three inches in the Buffalo South towns, and it will be getting colder.
You look at the extended outlook and you see all these flakes, but they're only going to be scattered light snow showers, so most of our accumulations will be tonight and a little bit more tomorrow.
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you OK?
Stan, I... I gotta call you back.
I just ran someone over. OK.
You idiot! You weren't even looking where you were going.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Is he OK? Is he all right?
- I think so.
Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.
- No, don't. I'm OK.
- Hey, it's you.
Yeah, me.
You know what, he walked out into the street.
I saw it all. You were on your phone.
- You weren't even paying attention.
- I was.
- I know how to drive.
- You know what?
Just park. I'll take him to the café.
Where are you going?
Stay on the ground.
There we go. There we go.
So they let you out, huh?
Yeah.
Un verre d'eau, Pierre.
Thanks.
Did you call an ambulance?
It's OK. I really am fine.
Fine for a guy who just got run over.
Lucky, I guess.
I think someone should look at you.
Hello. Guy.
Do you wanna see someone?
- You look familiar.
- What?
Oh. Oh.
- That.
- What?
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.
- Oh. That's you.
- Unfortunately, yeah.
Er... I mean, look, you seem to be OK, right?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Great. So I can go now, right?
- Sure.
- OK, then.
Goodbye.
And, you know, be more careful.
I told you I never wanted to see that face again.
So?
I figured it out.
- Figured what out?
- My dream.
Oh, that's good. So what is it?
The bank.
- The bank is your dream?
- Yeah.
- Um... what bank?
- The one I didn't rob.
- That's your dream?
- Yeah.
What kind of cockamamie dream is that?
I did the time,
I may as well have done the crime.
Yeah. Time, crime, right.
- So what do you say?
- About what?
- Will you help me?
- Help you what?
You came to jail to ask me to help you rob a bank?
Yeah.
I missed you, Henry.
You've got your review coming up.
- Yeah, so?
- So you can get out of here.
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.
- It's not.
- It is.
No, it is not.
This is my home, buddy.
This is not a home, Max.
It's a prison.
Call it what you like. I'm happy here.
Max.
You can't die in this place.
I can die pretty much wherever I want.
I'm asking for your help.
I need your help.
- I got cards, kid.
- Max.
Come on. Look, I've thought about...
God knows, I love my country.
I love it deeply.
I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much.
But I must drink my coffee.
Firs, coffee. Firs?
Where's Firs?
I'm sorry, Firs is sick today.
- What?
- He's... He's sick.
He's sick. You know it. Continue.
Fine, I'll pretend Firs is here.
Thank you, Firs, you dear old man.
I'm so glad to find you still alive.
I said I'm so glad to find you still alive.
He's a little deaf.
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says that I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care. A bit.
I just want you to believe in me.
Like in the old days.
I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look on me like they used to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop. It just is bloody.
No! Simone.
It's too small. It's too safe.
- Stop showing me that safe face.
- Good, I won't.
No, I'm not talking about you.
You're doing the best you can.
I'm talking to you.
- What are you doing?
- Me?
Yes.
Well, I... I'm listening.
Listening?
Well, it looks like you're...
..hearing, and to hear is to be weak.
To listen is to be strong.
Why? Because to listen is an action.
No. What... What is that?
It's an action. I'm listening.
I mean, is that what you want?
Is that what you mean?
- No, Djula.
- Mm-hm. OK.
Then what do you want?
You're performing, you're performing.
Nothing comes out.
You're just performing. Performing.
Well, that's what I do, Darek.
I'm an actress.
You can call yourself whatever you want, but so far you haven't shown me anything real.
You see, here on stage, every moment, every word, every breath should be a risk.
Where is your risk, Djula?
I don't know, Darek. In your ass?
Good! Finally she's listening! Hah!
From the top, everybody.
I'm going to grab some coffee.
Well, you do that, Djula.
Go and grab a coffee.
Let's all have coffee and think about what we're willing to risk in life.
What are you doing here?
You here to sue me?
- No.
- Good.
20 minutes. I don't care.
- Is it always like that?
- What?
- That.
- In rehearsal?
- Yeah.
- It's a process.
Looks complicated.
Yeah, it is.
- Madame Julie.
- Coffee, Pierre.
You want one?
- Sure.
- Deux.
- Deux cafés.
- Oui.
Thanks.
You looked like you were listening.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Really?
In a way.
Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't.
I wasn't. I was playing it safe.
You know, "The Cherry Orchard" was Chekhov's last play.
He was dying when he wrote it.
It's kind of perfect.
- Why?
- Because it's my last play, too.
Here in Buffalo.
I'm leaving. Right after this.
So who are you?
You mean my name?
OK.
I'm Henry.
Well, I wanna thank you for not suing me, Henry.
Au revoir, Madame Julie.
Ciao, ciao.
Mr. Saltzman, please tell the Board why you believe we should grant you a parole.
Come on, Mr. Saltzman.
What have you got for us this time?
Mr. Saltzman?
Come on, Max.
See you, George.
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah.
Um...
..where is your car?
I don't have a car.
You don't have a car?
I sold it.
Well, what is the matter with you?
You come to pick me up and you don't have a car.
That is not the way you pick up a person!
Yes, it is. I'm here.
I'm picking you up.
Look, I really don't know about this.
I think I'm making a pretty big mistake.
Look, Max, the bus station's just a short walk.
Bus station?
Don't worry, Max.
Carl? Hey, Dave8.
Let me in, will you? Open up!
Max, it's gonna be OK.
Are you kidding me?
This is your plan?
An old cartoon in a pissoir?
- It's a start.
- No, this is 80 years ago.
Wait. I tell you what we do.
We do it the old-fashioned way.
- We go in with guns.
- No guns.
- Why?
- Someone could get hurt.
That's very sweet of you, Henry.
Maybe the tunnel's still there, Max.
Yes, I'm sure it is, right
- Maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.
But maybe it's not.
I tell you what we do.
First we go to this bank of yours and see if that's there.
It is.
I'm sure it is. But maybe it's not.
Now, which kind of account would you like to open?
Well, which kind have you got?
Er... savings, interest-only, commercial...
Excuse me for interrupting.
I was just thinking, it's such a small world.
My uncle... My uncle, he put all his money in your vault when I was a kid.
I mean, after we came from Europe.
Before the War.
The brownshirts and...
Well, what was my point, anyway?
I... Yes, and I remember him, my uncle, telling me that your vault would probably be here for 300 years.
- Well, we hope he's right.
- The man was never wrong.
Er... how long has that vault been here?
Er... since 1891.
Wow. And I'm just assuming it's in the same spot.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Exact same spot.
History, son. It's all about history.
As I was saying, we have savings, interest-only...
Again, pardon me, but you'll have to just give us a little time to decide which of those we prefer.
But I want to thank you so very much.
- Oh, well, no, thank you.
- No, thank you for being so kind.
OK, we'll get in touch with you.
Have a nice day, gentlemen.
The vault is somewhere in here.
The tunnel runs somewhere under here and ends up somewhere in there.
It's virtually robbing itself, isn't it?
Goddamn Chekhov shit!
Jesus. Henry?
Hi.
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.
How do you do?
- What are you doing here?
- Er...
I was er... I was just showing Henry the place where I used to perform.
Oh. What?
- That's lunch, Julie.
- Oh. Thank God.
Yes,
Chekhov can be extremely difficult.
It sometimes takes a cast-iron stomach.
- Why, you know Chekhov?
- Of course.
Next to Gorbachev, he's my favourite Russian.
Excuse me, would you mind terribly if I er... took a look inside?
It's been maybe 30 years since I've been in there.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, er... yeah, sure.
Very kind of you.
How are you doing?
Great I'm in hell.
Home again.
- What shows did you do?
- Ma'am?
What productions were you in?
Ah.
Er... some of the greats.
Er... Shakespeare, of course.
Er... Ibsen, er... Yeats, Williams.
Yeats. Yeats?
What play did Yeats write?
No, it was about Yeats, when he was a young man.
Julie. Excuse me. Julie,
Mary wants to fit your wig at four and Darek says to stay hungry.
- Fuck him.
- Got it.
Um... can I be a bit of a nuisance, please?
I'd very much appreciate a small tour around the old place, if you wouldn't mind.
He used to perform here.
- I suppose it's OK. We're on a break.
- Oh, thank you.
- Henry?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Julie, thanks so much.
Is that your dad?
- No, he's a friend.
- Really? Cos he seems like your dad.
It's peaceful out here.
Ah, the inner sanctum.
Like it was yesterday.
Down here.
People often make the mistake of going down but in Chekhov, you must always, always go up.
- Bring back some memories?
- Oh, indeed.
Let me tell you something.
Did you know that there used to be a speakeasy here during Prohibition?
And they hid the booze in the bank.
Exactly.
Did you know there was a tunnel?
There was a tunnel.
I know that. I know that.
As a matter of fact, that tunnel...
That tunnel was um...
I know where it is.
- I'll show it to you.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- Um...
You did some acting yourself, didn't you?
I could tell.
"The Cherry Orchard".
So what's it about?
A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and she realizes that she has to sell her beloved cherry orchard, which is the magical place of her youth.
It's the only place she's ever felt safe.
And it's about um... being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive.
We're going to have to be quick because Arnold hates people in his dressing room.
- Arnold?
- Oh, Lopakhin.
Of course.
Hello?
And I think it was right here.
Yeah.
Huh. Amazing.
Oh, boy. Lots of whisky.
Filled with ladies and gentlemen.
The good old days. Can you imagine?
I think they sealed it up in 1931 when they built the theater.
Yeah, times have changed.
Well, all good things must come to an end, unfortunately.
So what's your story, Henry?
- My story?
- Like, what do you do?
I'm figuring that out.
Does that mean you don't have a job?
I er...
..just got out of prison.
- Prison?
- It sounds worse than it is.
Really? Cos prison sounds bad.
Why were you there?
Are you a murderer or something?
No. Do I look like one?
- No.
- What do I look like?
Oh, this place is just full of treasures.
Thank you so much.
It was great. Thank you.
- And thank you, Simon.
- My pleasure.
- And I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Max has offered to volunteer at the theater.
Oh.
Work.
Work. It's time to work, you lazy Americans.
Even you, Djula. Top of act two.
What are you doing afterwards?
- Why?
- You like Chinese?
- Yeah.
- Jinlan?
- Yeah, it's OK.
- Eight o'clock?
Sure.
- Great.
- Great.
Djula, can we please start?
Stay out of prison.
- Djula, please.
- Yes, yes!
- Can we start?
- I'm here!
Good. You're coming in stage right.
I can see it all, Henry.
The bank, the vault, the theater, the tunnel.
See, we got all the pieces of the puzzle sitting right there on the table.
Now all we gotta do is put 'em in the right order.
The only thing is the dirt.
Where does the dirt from the tunnel go?
What about the vault?
- I'm thinking dirt right now, Henry.
- OK.
How do I look?
- Huh?
- How do I look?
You look like Henry.
You gonna be all right?
Yeah, we had a great day, kid.
Have yourself a nice dinner.
Julie.
Sorry I'm late.
That guy's a total dick.
Hi, Henry.
Hi. So how was the rehearsal?
I feel like duck.
Yeah, I think I'm good.
The reviews are mostly good.
But the problem is I don't just wanna be good. I wanna be great.
And I don't just wanna be great in Buffalo.
Where, then?
Don't laugh.
Hollywood.
I guess that's where people go.
Yeah.
You know, I just don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial.
You know what? It's not going to be.
Because the moment this thing is done, I'm out of here.
I'm just... I've gotta get out before it's too late.
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah.
I hate fortune cookies.
I like 'em.
Are we going anywhere in particular?
Mm-hm.
You want some?
- No.
- No?
Come on, take a chance.
Take a chance on life.
There's a whole bunch of bodies down there just churning around, caught in the current.
So what did you do before jail,
Henry?
I worked at a tollbooth.
- Yeah? Which one?
- Eden.
- No!
- Yes.
Yay! I had family on the other side.
We must have seen each other 100 times.
So, er... wow.
You were one of those guys in the tollbooth with the er... those weird... those rubber gloves.
Yeah.
What's so funny?
It's just...
You were watching everyone go someplace and you were going nowhere.
- That's funny?
- Yeah.
It's funny-sad.
So what did you go to jail for,
Henry?
- Trying to rob Buffalo Savings Bank.
- What?
I thought I was on my way to a softball game but I... wasn't.
- But now I'm gonna rob it for real.
- What?
I'm going to rob it for real.
You're going to rob the bank that you went to jail for robbing?
Yeah.
- There's a tunnel.
- What tunnel?
It runs from the bank to the theater.
- My theater?
- Yeah.
Fucking hilarious, Henry.
You know what?
- What?
- I'm hungry.
- For what?
- Ice cream.
Ice cream.
Let's get some ice cream.
I can't believe I'm sitting here.
Neither can I.
I want to dance and clap my hands.
I think I must be dreaming.
You know,
"God knows, I love my country.
"I love it deeply.
"I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much."
Page 21.
Could you read Lopakhin?
Sure.
"I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother.
"I wanted to stay and talk to you.
"You're as wonderful as ever."
Read the next line.
"Even more beautiful,
"and dressed like a Parisian...
You could blow me down."
Um... could you say it like you feel it?
Like it's real.
Just say it to me.
OK.
"Even more beautiful.
"And dressed like a Parisian...
"You could blow me down."
You're good. That's really good.
You know what, I want you to keep reading, but get up and walk around.
- "Your brother Leonard..."
- Leonid.
- Leonid.
- Leonid.
"Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber."
Yes, you are, Henry.
You're a bank robber.
"He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.
"I just want you to believe in me like in the old days."
Again.
"I just want you...
"I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.
"I just want your wonderful, tender eyes
"to look at me like they did then."
Say it without the book now.
"I just want your wonderful, tender eyes
"to look at me
"like they did then."
Oh, I'm so glad I ran you over.
Me too.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- Henry!
- Morning, Max.
Hey, listen. I figured it out.
The dirt from the tunnel goes on the roof.
Ah, company.
- Good morning, Max.
- I'm sorry about the um...
- It's all right. She knows.
- She does?
I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes on the roof.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anyone.
Could I just have a second with you?
Pardon us, will you?
- What do you mean, you told her?
- I told her.
- You told her everything?
- Yeah.
Henry, it's a crime.
A crime's supposed to be secret.
- It's OK, Max.
- No, it is not. It's not kosher.
How do you like your bacon?
Crispy.
- What were you in prison for, Max?
- I was a confidence man.
You mean a con man?
I um... I don't like that word.
Er, "confidence" is a little more elegant.
"Confidence" comes from the Greek
"fides", meaning faith and belief.
Greek?
I thought it was Latin.
Well, yes, it is... it is now.
So, essentially, you make people feel good and then you rip 'em off?
Yes. But I was always a little better at the feeling good part than I was with the ripping off part, hence jail.
Aren't you worried about getting caught?
Well, it's kind of a win-win situation for me.
Why?
I like jail.
What about you, Henry?
You like jail?
No.
I like it out here.
So why would you take the risk?
Or is it the money?
Well, it must be the money.
Boy, you are a criminal.
You're a greedy little criminal.
Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.
But I don't care a bit.
I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.
Cute! You remember. Good!
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Um... what exactly was that?
- It was Chekhov.
Chekhov?
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- We read it last night.
Yeah. He was so good.
- You're really good. He's a natural.
- He is.
Um... I thought you guys were out on a date last night.
We were.
So now going on a date is reading Chekhov?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
I gotta get to the theater.
Um... excuse me. Excuse me.
Um... can you give me a ride to the theater?
Why?
I'm a volunteer now.
You were never in any of those plays, were you?
No.
But can you give me a ride?
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
We can't turn back the clock now, poor dear.
Crying, crying, crying.
Oh, God. This is driving me crazy.
- What?
- We could be digging right now.
- We could?
- If we were in that dressing room.
- It's rehearsal. There are people.
- Right. Just pissing me off.
Well, what can we do, Max?
What?
- I got an idea.
- What?
What if you played Lopakhin?
- What?
- If you played Lopakhin, we could get into that tunnel any time.
They have a Lopakhin.
- What if they didn't?
- What do you mean?
What do I mean?
What if they didn't have a Lopakhin?
I can't be Lopakhin.
I'm not an actor.
You're not a bank robber and you're doing that.
Max, come on.
- She said you were a natural.
- So?
So a natural is a natural.
And a natural means you can do it.
- It doesn't.
- You're gonna be Lopakhin.
- There has to be another way.
- No. This is the way.
- I don't know, Max.
- You want the bank, don't you?
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna be Lopakhin.
End of story. You're gonna be great.
I swear to you.
- It's crazy.
- You're gonna be great.
I'll call you back.
Darek, she's taking a phone call in the middle...
I did not take it.
It's exactly what I did not do.
Listen, I was thinking here, you could step backstage.
- What's going on?
- You unprofessional...
- Mr. Milodragovich.
- ..shit!
Arnold's quitting.
- What?
- He's quitting.
We're talking about Willie Loman.
The West End.
A Ken Waterstone production.
Ooh, a Ken Waterstone production!
The heavens have opened
You're a lucky boy. Well, go, yes.
Run, run to that pampering, populist...
Great
..piece of shit Ken Waterstone and his finest productions. Ha!
Goodbye, Darek. I'm sorry.
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
We could have auditions this afternoon.
- I have a list of...
- That's a shit list!
What do you want me to do?
I can't hear you when you're yelling.
What?
No, no, no, sorry.
I can't give you a ride.
I know, no. Before I start,
I just want you to remember that you said he'd be a natural.
Stan, let me call you back.
- What?
- Henry.
- Henry what?
- He'd be perfect.
Perfect for what?
For Lopakhin.
You mean
Henry should play Lopakhin?
- Yes.
- What the fuck! He's not an actor!
Exactly. He's natural.
He'd just be playing himself.
Just give this a little thinkage.
The man is Lopakhin.
I mean, he's a man who's come from nothing, he's a man who's not afraid to create a new life, put his past behind him, and he's a man in love with you.
Er... Madame Ravinsky.
Ranevsky.
- What did I say?
- Ravinsky.
- I did?
- It's Ranevsky.
That's weird. OK.
Can you maybe get him in to see Darek?
What's going on here, Max? Hm?
What's going on? What are you doing?
Listen. The truth is, you need a Lopakhin and Lopakhin needs a dressing room.
You did this, didn't you?
OK, that... that's fair enough.
OK. OK.
Confidence man.
- Now, get out.
- I was just... I was getting out.
Thanks.
You have no training, you've never been in a production.
You don't even know the play.
I've read it.
I think I know this scene.
Oh, you think you know? What?
You're a peasant, a nobody.
Start.
Your brother Leonid Andrevich says I'm an ups...
How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say Andre-ye-vich?
- Say it.
- Andreyevich.
Good. Got the name right. Continue.
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.
A what?
- A money-grubber.
- Really?
Are you?
- No.
- No?
- No!
- No? But convince her, not me.
Convince her!
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.
Neither do I.
I just want you to believe in me, like in the old days.
Now, do you, Djula?
Show me. Tell me.
Yes, please can you show us something we don't know?
Good God in heaven.
My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that.
Boring!
It's all ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
It must come from here.
Speak with your heart.
She's your angel.
Beg her. Beg her for forgiveness.
My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that.
But you, you did so much for me in the old days.
I'd forgotten all that.
I love you.
Like a sister.
More than a sister.
You piece of shit! Don't you ever...
Not bad, Djula. Give me a hug.
- No.
- Give me a hug.
No.
Come here. Come on.
I want to hold hands. Simone!
Argh!
Does this make me an accessory?
I think so.
Depends.
On what?
If I get caught.
Things have certainly gotten more interesting since you showed up.
You mean, since you ran me over.
It's not about the money, is it?
- No.
- Then why are you doing it?
I used to go along with everything.
I didn't know I could change it.
So now I'm changing it.
And robbing a bank is changing it?
It already has.
Can everybody gather round?
Darek wants to address the cast.
Thank you for coming, everybody.
I would like to introduce to you
Henry Smith.
From today, he's going to do the part of Lopakhin.
If you please.
Thanks. Thank you.
Looking forward to it.
OK, let's take five minutes.
We'll go from the top of act three.
Top of act three, people.
Hold it.
Lower.
Henry.
That is a shit-pile of brick.
Yeah.
I think we might need another pair of hands.
No! No!
No!
You've gotta be kidding!
You suck!
How could you possibly suck any more?
Sucker.
I suppose that's him?
Yeah, that's him.
No, no, no.
Thanks for meeting us.
Sure.
How are you, Joe?
How's the business?
- You mean the pyramid scheme?
- Yeah.
It all fell apart.
We were banking on that money, Henry.
And now all I got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic.
- Excuse me, um... what does that mean?
- Kitchenware.
You see what happens when a person tries to go legit?
It's killing me.
- It's gonna be OK.
- Really? It is?
You know how much diapers cost?
Huh?
You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?
You're sending your baby to college?
No, of course not.
But the kid needs stuff.
Stuff that's expensive.
Stuff he deserves.
Joe, we might be able to help.
Yeah? How?
We might have a job for you.
No fooling.
These things are hot.
I'm on fire.
So what do you think?
I think we should get some guns and get the money through the front door.
No guns. People could get hurt.
- What about fake ones?
- They're still guns.
Joseph, we're not doing one of those stupid robberies with tellers and tears and chump change.
We're digging right through to the belly of the beast.
Henry.
Darek wants you on the stage.
Now. Henry?
I hope we don't get caught.
He's on his way.
Oh, thank you for joining us, Henry.
I hope you're worth the wait.
OK, er... places for
Lopakhin buys the orchard, all right?
Let's pick it up from there.
Places, please, for Lopahkin's speech.
What do you guys think?
- If it's a boy, do I cut him or not?
- If you mean his dick, yeah.
You!
First I see you guys in the bank, then I see you guys in the alley next to the bank, now I see you coming out of the theater behind the bank.
I know what you're up to, gentlemen.
So what's on your mind, Frank?
Indigenous currency retrieval and exchange.
Once a month, a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border to Canada, takes up all the currency and brings it back home.
Let's say, on average, eight to twelve million held in our vault for a short time before it's picked up for redistribution.
Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time.
I could give you the dates.
I could help you with the alarms,
I could be your guy on the inside.
Um... hypothetically, let's just say you were right about what we were doing, which you're not, of course, um... why would you help us rob your own bank?
- Got my reasons.
- This sounds like a set-up, man.
I don't fuck around, kid.
Like I said, I got my reasons.
Well, you'll just have to forgive us, Frank.
We have to hear 'em.
Wife got sick a few years ago.
Insurance wouldn't pick up all the cost so I went to the bank.
They wouldn't help cover the difference.
We were going to retire to France.
The Loire valley.
We had to use all of our savings to cover the bills.
Spent everything we had.
Then she died.
I been 30 years at that place.
I'm sorry.
November 23rd.
The money's dropped off at eight and picked up at midnight.
I retire in two weeks.
This is it.
You set up that table,
I'll make sure dinner arrives hot.
Look, why should I be ashamed to say it?
Oh. Why should...
Why should I be ashamed to say it?
I love him. I love him.
My love is like a stone round my neck and it's dragging me down to the bottom.
But... I love my stone.
I... I can't live without it.
For God's sake, the man has robbed you!
Oh, no, no, no. Don't say that!
He's a scoundrel.
Everybody sees it but you.
A petty scoundrel. A user.
And you are what? 26 or what?
Ah, please, please, please, please, stop.
No. Look.
Djula, I can hear you because you're acting very loudly.
But I can't feel you.
Can I ask you a question?
- It is very personal.
- Mm-hm.
Have you ever been in love?
- Of course.
- Huh. Liar.
Fuck you, Darek!
Then show us!
Show us what love is all about.
How it rips you apart and then puts you together.
It carries you to the heavens and then smashes you to the ground.
Now, if you want to become a great actress, then you have to reveal something, Djula.
What are you so afraid of, huh?
Maybe you want to die old, alone, unemployed.
Is that what you want, hm?
Djula!
Oh, that's right, Djula.
Run, Buffalotto. Run.
You're very good at that.
Five minutes, people.
Five minutes, everyone.
What?
Are you OK?
I... hate him.
I'm a good actress.
I am a damn good actress.
What, I have to love someone to be a great actress? Horse shit.
I've heard it my whole goddamn life.
- What?
- That I'm cold.
No, you're not.
Ice cold.
Arctic cold.
Mm.
This is it. I got the place.
South Beach, Florida.
Incredible.
I'm talking palm trees, all-you-can-eat sunshine, nice sandy beach, surrounded by grapefruits the size of your head.
Now, is that living it?
Is that living it? What?
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, that's living it.
Who the hell's that?
- I'll check.
- Grapefruits, Henry, grapefruits.
Large, large grapefruits.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Joe.
I'm sorry, Henry.
The same bank.
Shit, Henry. Now, that's poetry.
How you doin', Joe?
Hello.
Hello. Um...
Who's this guy?
I'm your new partner.
- Who's this guy?
- I know the whole story.
Joe told me you guys need someone to help get you into that vault.
And I don't dig. Dig?
I'm sorry, Max.
Somebody tell me, who the hell is this guy?
I'm in... or you're out.
Henry, how about a cold one, huh?
Let me explain something.
This poor guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
He's a drunk bum.
He makes mistakes.
Drunken bums make mistakes.
Now, you'll please get the hell out of that chair.
Henry and I go way back.
We went to high school together, right, Henry?
- Yeah, I knew you.
- So just relax, old man.
Max! Max, Max, it's OK. Max.
- I know him. I know him.
- All right. All right.
I appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry.
If there's one quality
I admire in a man, it's loyalty.
What do you want, Eddie?
The American dream.
Deb says we can't have sex till the baby is born.
She says the kid'll know.
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.
Just shut up and go home, please.
So, Henry, what about that beer?
Shit.
Opening night.
Shit, what?
- Opening night.
- Yeah, so?
It's soon.
Correct. So let's go dig it.
I'm gonna have to leave her.
Of course you have to leave her.
You're robbing a bank.
Max, maybe we should wait.
Wait for what? A bus?
What are you talking about?
It's a one-time deal.
The guy's retiring. We can't.
What is the matter with you, anyway?
Come on.
What?
I can't do it.
- You can't do what?
- I can't leave her, Max.
Leave who? Do what?
- I can't do this.
- Henry.
Henry, listen.
You forced me out of jail to help you and I'm gonna goddamn help you.
See, I got through my whole life with my mouth, you know, bullshitting.
I've been nothing but a fucking coward.
But now I am going to do something.
So here's the deal, Henry.
We're gonna dig this tunnel.
Then we're gonna rob the bank and we're gonna take the money, we're gonna put it in a car and then we are going to drive away.
Do you understand, Henry?
Yeah.
Henry to the stage, please.
Henry to the stage.
Lopakhin to the stage.
I'll be right out.
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.
Oh, I hate this commercial.
- I like it.
- Why?
You're in it.
Come on. I'm starving. Let's go.
We have to do it opening night.
- What?
- It's the only time we can get in.
- But that's in two days.
- Yeah.
So you're leaving?
Yeah.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
Fuck.
Fuck, Henry.
- I was thinking we could meet.
- What?
I was thinking California.
You were thinking we could meet in California?
Yeah.
You know what?
You really are a thief, Henry.
I mean, California?
Why would I go anywhere with you?
You can't cross a fucking street.
You wreck my play, you make me an accessory to a crime.
I should call the cops and you should go to hell.
- I didn't know it would be this way.
- Henry, you're a bank robber.
You're a bank robber. Henry.
You're a bank robber.
Th... I mean, you knew that you had to leave?
- No.
- That's exactly what you wanted.
- So that we could be together.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
You know what?
We screwed a couple of times.
Right? So what?
- It was more than that.
- No, really, just a couple of times.
We both knew this would never work out, right?
- I didn't.
- I did.
Go rob your bank.
Go!
You're a good man, Henry.
Yeah, Max.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Tonight, my dear players, we can show our audience that the future is something we really need to fear.
And to recognise that knowledge itself is never more real than in the beauty of our imagination.
No, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh.
As we say in my home country, go out there and break some dicks.
Off the cushion in the corner, double into the center pocket.
Ten minutes, people, ten minutes.
Curtain.
Thank God the train is in.
- What time is it?
- Almost two.
It's light already.
- How you doin', Frank?
- Doing good, Bernie.
Oh, my, the nursery!
Oh, my dear, sweet, beautiful nursery.
I used to sleep here as a little girl.
Your train was two hours late.
How do you explain that?
Is that good management?
I'm still like a little girl.
You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank?
I know what you'd do.
You'd buy the Bills and put them in first place.
It'd take more money than that.
Hey, get in there, get in there.
I guarantee it, I'd get 'em back into the Super Bowl within two seasons.
Perfect. Another chance to lose.
Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood.
I used to sleep in this nursery.
I looked out from here into the garden and I woke up happy every morning.
Oh, my cherry orchard.
Well, this is it, Frank.
We got you something.
A little er... retirement gift.
- Oh, thank you, guys.
- We wanted it to be from France.
Where is he?
Where is that old geezer?
It stinks in here.
- Oh, break a leg.
- The play's already started, Max.
Oh, right. Oh, Julie. Goodbye.
Goodbye, confidence man.
Go. Go! Go!
Nice of you to join us, old man.
Just do your goddamn job.
What? What now?
Oh, no. No, no, not again.
Jeez! Give me that.
- Sorry.
- Give me that. "Sorry"?
You're a pussy, you know that, Joe?
You're a real pussy.
Get off the cord.
What should we do?
Tell us what to do.
I tell you every day. Every day
I say the same thing over and over.
You must rent out the cherry orchard and the rest of the estate for villas at once, right this second.
The auction is coming up very soon.
But it's all so vulgar.
Aaaahhh!
Welcome to my world, bitches.
Fuck, yeah.
Is the cherry orchard sold?
- Yes.
- Who bought it?
I did.
I bought it.
Wait a minute. Don't rush me.
I'm all dizzy.
I can't talk.
Oh.
When we got to the auction,
Deriganov was already there.
He bid 30, I bid 40, he bid 45, I bid 55.
You see, he kept going up five while I went up ten.
Well, it didn't take very long.
The gavel sounded and now the cherry orchard is mine.
Mine!
God! God in heaven!
The cherry orchard is mine!
Tell me I'm drunk.
Tell me I'm out of my mind.
Tell me I'm dreaming.
- Is that it?
- Yes, it is.
What's that, Eddie?
It's a gun, Max. Joe, take the money and put it in the car. Now.
Joe.
- Just stay where you are.
- Don't fuck with me, old man.
You wanna shoot me?
You're gonna have to kill me.
- No, no, no.
- Listen, stay out of this.
What are you doin', Eddie?
Welcome to the party, Brando.
- What are you doin', Eddie?
- It's money, Henry, money.
Come on, Eddie.
We're here, we're done.
Shut up, Joe.
Take the money out to the car now.
Go on, move. Move.
No happy ending for you, my friend.
Agh! You animal!
Aaargh!
Aaarghhh!
Max.
Places, act four.
Places, act four.
Act four places, people.
It's going very well, everyone.
I gotta get on stage.
Son of a bitch.
The peasants have come to say goodbye.
They're good fellows,
Yermolai Alekseyevich, but, in my opinion, a little stupid.
You gave them everything in your purse. Lyuba, that was wrong.
I couldn't help it.
I couldn't help it.
Won't you please come and drink a glass as a goodbye?
Oh, man.
Stop the car.
Joe, stop the car.
We can't stop the car, Henry.
- It's the getaway car.
- Stop the fucking car, Joe.
Stop the fucking car, Joe!
Stop the fucking car!
What the hell are you doing?
He's leaving.
Leaving?
Grapefruits as big as your head, Max.
All-you-can-eat sunshine.
OK, kid. I'll be seeing you.
Yeah.
I'll see you.
What's going on?
Just forget about it.
Let's get the hell out of here. Drive.
Don't speed.
Dear Mother used to love to walk about in this room.
My sister. My sister.
- Mama!
- Ah-ooo!
I'm coming.
Wait! Wait!
I had to come back.
I couldn't get on the train.
The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart.
I knew I would never see you again.
What... is he doing?
I had to come back.
Oh, come on, Henry.
What is this? What are you doing?
This is the only way you'll listen.
You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake.
The mistake would have been leaving and not telling you how I feel.
Don't pretend you care!
All you care about is money!
- You think it's about money?
- Yes.
- It's never been about money.
- My sister. Everything all right?
- Get out!
- Don't you have a train to catch?
Get out! Go away!
Well, here he is, ladies and gentlemen.
The selfish peasant who's taken the orchard right out from under us, who's destroying it right in front of our very eyes.
Sometimes you must destroy in order to create.
We have to let go of our pasts in order to live.
You are no angel.
I see what you are by your actions.
I came back, didn't I?
I came back for you.
Henry, just...
..leave.
Meet me in Moscow.
Get off the fucking stage.
What? What are you running from?
What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.
- Yes, you are.
- Of what, Henry? Tell me.
- You're afraid...
..because I love you.
What?
Meet me in Moscow.
Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.
Go with him!
Meet him in Moscow!
- Meet me.
- Light... lights down ten.
OK.
Ten more.
Ah, fuck, Henry.
Mom, do you remember that one time when we were little and Gail made that huge dinner out of nowhere?
Oh, my God, yeah!
That was amazing.
Mom, he made this soup, by the way.
Really?
Did you know he did his internship in Chicago?
You did an internship?
I did an internship at this kitchen.
I saw him chopping the carrots, and he was like a professional carrot-chopper, with a knife.
How long did you intern?
Two months, erm, like,
20 hours a week.
I could have kept going, but I kind of quit, because I didn't get paid and I started getting bored.
Yeah.
How do you go from forensic science to cutting up vegetables in a restaurant?
I don't know. I mean, it was like a fleeting interest.
I don't know.
Would you consider going back to school?
Erm, I mean, not immediately.
I just want to get a job and get some money, and then, I don't know.
It's not...
It's still a possibility.
I'm glad you came home.
I bought us a coffee table.
- Did you?
- He did.
- Oh, really?
- I'm assembling it.
It's coming right along.
And by coming right along,
I mean not at all.
Still in the box.
So, how's it going?
I know you guys have only been here a week, but...
It's really good, actually.
Yeah?
Yeah. I really like it.
I really like the place, and we're not screaming at each other yet.
Yeah.
Well, that's good.
It's nice to see you guys together.
We did...
Never mind.
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Oh, come on.
- No, I forgot.
How about you?
How's work going?
It's good, it's good. Everybody's really nice, and I'm lucky.
Yeah?
Yeah, it's really good.
All right,
I'm going to go to bed now.
OK.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You going to go to bed soon?
Erm, I don't know.
Not really tired.
It's weird you're never tired.
Tired in the morning.
Yeah.
Me too.
All right.
- Going to bed.
- OK.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Gail.
What up?
How's it going?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
You're, erm, you're at my office.
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, you want to go to the coast?
What?
I have, like...
No.
It's whale watching week.
Doug, I've got, like...
I have a job.
I can't just leave and go whale watching with you.
Yeah, but it's a special occasion.
Can't you just do this stuff tomorrow?
Not... I mean, no, I can't.
People just can't, like, just leave work.
- Just once?
- They have things to do.
You can do it one time.
What if everybody here just went whale watching today?
I made sandwiches.
Look at this sea life.
Going to take this home and put it in your bed.
That's what you get for bringing me out here!
Thanks for coming in.
I appreciate it.
What I'm looking for is somebody that can work, you know, start now, here in the spring, and through the summer, fall.
Winter's kind of slow, but there'd be work year-round.
Got a couple of other guys that work the night shift for us, and we're looking for another man to help out with that.
Got insulated coveralls and everything for you.
- Yeah, that's fine.
- All right.
Forensic science, criminal justice.
That's a pretty interesting field.
What, are you just taking a break?
Planning on going back to it?
Er, yeah.
Maybe eventually.
Eventually.
That's pretty neat stuff.
If it's anything like on the movies, it's pretty darn neat.
Yeah.
OK.
Let's see.
Ice factory.
I thought you might get a job, like...
..in something crime-related, like in a lab, or something.
No. I don't think you can get those jobs if you don't finish school.
Are you sure you're going to be OK in an ice factory?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know...
I didn't even know they had ice factories.
Yeah. Where do you think they get those bags of ice you buy?
I don't know,
I never thought about it.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
Not much.
Do you usually take the bus?
Yeah.
I thought you had a car?
Yeah, I do.
Some asshole broke my window.
Now it's in the shop.
But it'll be ready tomorrow. I won't have to put up with this bullshit.
Dude, think of me.
I've got to do this every day.
I'm only kidding.
I'm only half kidding.
Where you heading?
I've got to go meet my ex-girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Like a date or something?
No, like, just checking in, kind of.
She's here from out of town.
That's cool.
Hi.
Hi.
It's raining.
I'll be right back.
That's a lot of stuff.
What is it, tea?
Yeah.
How are you?
Pretty good.
How are you?
Good.
How's living with your sister?
It's good.
It's nice.
You like it more than living with me?
I don't know.
Maybe not.
So, what are you in town for?
For work.
I got a job in a law office in Chicago and their main office is here, so they sent me up for some training.
Yeah, I got a hotel room and they paid for my ticket.
You work in a law office?
I do.
That's strange.
It is. I've worked in an office before, though, so...
How about you?
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
I got a job working overnight in an ice factory.
I, like, load bags of ice into crates, put them onto a truck.
I don't know.
This is the only thing I could get.
Can I come and see your place sometime?
Erm, yeah, I guess so.
Guess so?
I mean, there's nothing there.
But yeah, of course.
Actually, I invited all the people that I work with on the nightshift to come over and play poker.
Oh, yeah?
Just, like, drink beer, play cards.
You want to come to that?
Sure.
Don't just take a tiny...
Just knock the rest back.
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.
There's, like, tons in there.
Well, it's like a shot.
No.
You're supposed to sip it.
Spade?
No?
Left of the dealer.
Did he just go?
No, he didn't go.
Hello?
'Hey, it's Carlos.'
Hey, one second.
What's happening?
It's your turn.
Why do I have eight cards?
Because you need to discard.
You never discarded.
Come in.
How's it going?
- How are you doing?
- Good, thanks for coming.
Thanks, thanks for having me.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Gail. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, that's my sister.
This is Rachel.
This is my friend Carlos, from work.
It's a nice place, man.
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's not fully done yet.
It's kind of nice, though.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Do you want some potato chips?
Sure. Thank you.
We're playing rummy.
It's your turn.
- It's my turn?
- No, Doug.
I don't think I know how to play rummy.
I've got a question for you.
Oh, yeah?
Listen, I don't want you to get offended.
Why am I going to be offended?
I don't know. I feel like some people don't like being asked this question.
Erm...
Will you tell me how much you get paid?
1,240. Why? How much you make?
Eight.
Oh, don't worry.
They raise pay pretty good here.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You'll get a raise soon.
If you don't quit first.
Why would I quit?
I don't know, man.
You seem like the kind that ends up quitting.
I mean, no offence, it's just that, well, people only work here for like a month or something.
- Really?
- Yeah.
A lot of people want bigger things.
I don't mind it, though.
I mean, I can think and move ice at the same time, you know.
Yeah, that's how my sister is.
She can multitask.
Hey, you know, that reminds me.
You should come to one of my DJ nights, and bring your sister and Rachel, too.
What DJ nights?
I DJ sometimes, man.
You do?
Good shit. Latin shit from the '60s.
Shit you never heard before.
This blows my mind!
Why?
I don't know.
You think, just because I move ice
I can't do something like that?
No, I just, I don't know.
I never pictured you as a DJ.
So, what else do you do?
Nothing.
Well, I mean, I know you're not like an ice professional, or anything.
What did you do before?
I used to study forensic science.
Really?
Yeah.
That's much more surprising than me being a DJ.
Is it?
Yeah. What, do you want to be a detective or some shit?
Yeah, exactly.
For real?
Don't mess with me, man!
I am going to be a detective one day.
What, like CSI and shit?
I don't really want to be like a CSI-type detective.
I want to be more like
Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes?
Yeah.
You've got to be kidding me, man.
What?
Yo, Mike.
Hey, Mike.
Our friend Douglas wants to be Sherlock Holmes!
No shit!
Sherlock fucking Holmes!
Why is that funny?
"Elementary, my dear Watson."
All that shit.
No, dude.
He doesn't say that.
He doesn't?
No, he doesn't say that, he doesn't smoke a stupid pipe.
He doesn't wear that stupid hat.
Oh, shit, really?
Yeah. In the books, he's just, like, the man.
Sherlock fucking Holmes.
You want to borrow one of the books?
What, a Sherlock Holmes book?
Yeah.
I guess, man, sure.
I'll bring you one.
All right.
How's your milk shake?
It's good. Do you want to try it?
I've got mine.
Yeah, but, like, mine is really good.
That may be true.
Mine is just as good.
That's why I ordered it.
Dude, just try the milk shake.
I don't want to try it.
I'll try your milk shake.
See?
She ordered coffee! Of course she wants to try the milk shake.
She wants to try everybody's,
I'm sure!
It's really good.
I'll try your milk shake, Carlos.
She's just trying to be irritating.
I wanted to ask you something.
What?
What are you doing on Wednesday?
I don't know. Why?
Well, I've got an extra ticket to this thing.
My cousin was supposed to go with me, but he kind of bailed.
What is it?
Well, it's this really fun thing, but you're not going to think it's so fun at first.
What? What is it?
It's a Star Trek convention.
Get out of here! Are you serious?
I don't want to do that!
Dude, it'll be fun, even if you don't like Star Trek.
I don't like Star Trek.
Marina Sirtis is going to be there.
I don't know who that is.
Dude, Marina Sirtis is famous, even if you don't know Star Trek.
She's Counsellor Troi.
I don't know what that means.
Forget it.
No, don't forget it.
I know somebody who would love to go to a Star Trek convention.
I know someone at this very table who has been to several
Star Trek conventions.
Well, it's not me.
What about you, Rachel?
You have any idea who
Counsellor Troi is?
You finish it?
- Wow, that was fast.
- It's amazing.
Really?
It's brilliant shit, man.
Sherlock Holmes is the pimp.
Told you, man!
That's so cool.
Yeah, I had no idea.
You going to let me borrow another one?
Yeah, totally.
I think my favourite was The Speckled Band.
Yeah, that was awesome.
Yeah, that was great, man.
I loved it.
- Who knew? All this time.
- I know.
Sherlock Holmes.
I knew.
Yeah. I guess so.
Did you just get here?
No, I've been out backed up with snow.
Oh, my God, I hate that.
Yeah, it sucks.
I'm severely suffering from post-lunch fatigue.
Yeah.
You look...contemplative.
What are you thinking about?
Well, er, nothing, man.
I just wanted to ask you if it's really cool if I take Rachel to the Star Trek convention tomorrow.
Yeah, of course.
I know she's your ex-girlfriend and everything.
I'm not bothered by it.
I don't want you to think we're on a date or anything.
It makes me uncomfortable.
I'm totally fine with it.
And you guys are dorks.
All right, I'm heading in.
All right.
What's up?
Hey, what's going on?
Not much, man. What's happening?
Nothing.
Did you go to the convention?
Yeah, man. Did you talk to Rachel?
No.
It was pretty fucking great, man.
We met Marina Sirtis.
You know Marc Alaimo, who plays
Gul Dukat on Deep Space Nine?
- He was there.
- I don't know who that is.
Gul Dukat, man!
One of the best characters in Star Trek. He's amazing.
I got a signed 8 x 10.
Pretty fucking great.
Did Rachel get one?
Yeah, except hers says, "To a lovely lady", because she's a chick, you know.
Anyway, we went to her hotel room after to watch an episode of Next Generation.
It was cool, it was chilled.
We just hung out, watched it and went home, no big deal.
Yeah, that's cool.
You never told me she was into baseball.
Is she into baseball?
I don't think so, man.
Well, we didn't talk about it, but she had a stat books thing on her night stand.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's weird. I used to try to get her to go see the White Sox all the time, and she never wanted to go.
I don't know, I guess you rubbed off on her or something.
So, hey, I wanted to tell you.
You should come and see me spin on Saturday.
I think Rachel's coming too.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
You go on at eight?
Yeah, yeah. I'm not the main DJ.
Shit, that's early.
Yeah, well, you should come out, man. It'll be fun.
I don't know.
There's a Blazers game.
Why don't you blow off your DJ gig and come to my house?
Yeah, right!
You should come, man.
- I highly recommend it.
- We'll see.
- All right, bro.
- Bye.
OK.
The new goal is to just see it splatter.
Not to hit a mark.
We'll just see how much we can splatter the grape.
Am I allowed to, like, rough it up beforehand?
Yeah.
OK.
It was already broken before it left your hand!
Yeah, I know. That's all right.
That's not against the rules.
Oh, that was beautiful!
If you open it, squeeze a little out and get it juicy.
Oh, hit the wire, though.
That was fun!
At least you dropped it.
Erm, so, guess what I'm doing tonight?
What?
You can't make fun of me.
I won't make fun of you.
You might, actually.
What are you doing?
Erm...
..I'm going on a date.
So?
All right. I thought you'd make fun of me.
Who are you going on a date with?
This guy named Swen.
Swen?
- What?
- That's his name?
How do you know him?
He works across the street from me, in an internet advertising company.
Is he nice?
Yeah, he's nice.
So, where are you going?
I don't know. I don't know if it's a date.
We're just going to see this band play.
He works with these girls.
I don't know.
I mean, I don't really talk to him, ever, or hang out with him.
So I guess it's probably a date.
Yeah, that's a date.
Yeah.
'It's Carlos, man. Let me up.'
Dude, it's late as hell.
'It's an emergency.
Please, just let me up.'
All right, hang on.
I called you five times, man.
I was asleep.
Five fucking times.
Jesus, what?
It's Rachel.
What about her?
She said she'd come to my show tonight and she didn't.
She just didn't show.
So what?
She said she'd come for sure.
She went out of her way to call me to say she was definitely going to come.
OK.
So I called her after my set, and she didn't answer, and then I keep trying to call her, but it goes straight to voicemail.
This is what you woke me up for?
It's just weird, man!
I went over to her motel room and all the lights were on in her room, but when I knocked, no answer.
She's probably asleep.
Why were all the lights on, then?
I don't know, Carlos. The lights are on in here and I was asleep.
Well, how come she didn't answer her phone?
How the hell should I know?
Just... It just doesn't make sense, man.
Goddamn, dude, how much Sherlock
Holmes have you been reading?
This has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes!
I just got this weird feeling when I was standing outside her motel room.
Weird feeling about what?
I need you to go over there with me.
I'm not going over there!
Dude, you know about these kinds of things!
What kinds of things?
Mysteries.
Hey, man, the light was on before.
So what? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Do you ever think that maybe you shouldn't be snooping around?
Ssssh! Quiet!
Quiet. You be quiet!
Man, the door's open.
So? Was it closed before?
Yeah.
Rachel?
Hello? Can you not go in there?
Are you serious?
It's just weird.
Didn't I tell you something weird was going on?
Maybe she checked out.
Maybe something came up.
Like what?
I don't know, man.
Maybe going to see you play isn't that important.
All I'm saying is that she told me she was going to come even if you decided to stay home.
OK, fine.
What are we supposed to do?
I don't know. I just feel like we've got to do something.
Is there anything in there?
Her phone charger.
She left her cellphone charger.
Are we done here?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.
Maybe she went to get a drink.
Maybe she went to another place, maybe she hated her hotel room.
Maybe she went back to Chicago.
There's really nothing out of the ordinary in here, man.
This isn't the most suspicious environment.
Don't react to anything
I'm about to tell you.
Just stay still.
OK.
There's a guy in a pick-up truck in the parking lot.
What?
There's a guy in a pick-up truck parked in the parking lot.
And he's watching us.
No, no, no, Carlos!
Fuck!
Did you see that?
Yes.
Who the fuck was that?
How the hell should I know?
I told you something fucked up was going on!
I'm sorry. I thought you were overreacting.
What do we do?
I don't know.
We've got to find Rachel.
I agree. I don't know where to start looking.
You know what we need?
We need common sense.
- Common sense?
- We've got to call your sister.
No, we're not calling my sister.
Why not?
- She's on a date.
- So what?
No, we're not calling my sister.
You know...
I think...I remember hearing about a situation that was actually a little bit like this.
A situation like what?
A situation, you know, where people disappear and there aren't any clues, it's a dead-end, and...
Thanks.
Any food?
No, man. Coffee's fine.
I can't remember.
I think maybe they use DNA.
Or... I think that was a different article.
Maybe they never actually found him.
Not the one I'm thinking of.
Shit.
What do we do?
Hello.
How are you?
Good evening.
What can I help you guys with?
Er, we'd like to get a room.
A room?
Yeah.
What kind of room?
I actually stayed in this hotel before, in room 35, and I had a really good experience in there.
So if I could get that room again, that would be really nice.
Er, it's occupied, so...
..something else?
Do you think I could have room 34?
Meet me at the door.
All right.
All right, where do we start?
You want to try the phone?
The phone?
Redial.
Yeah, good idea.
Never mind. Thank you.
What happened?
It's the front desk.
Anything in there?
No. Apple core, boarding pass.
What's that?
Look, look, look.
That's her handwriting.
Rachel's handwriting?
Crown Motel, Amanda Brooke.
Amanda Brooke?
Who the hell's Amanda Brooke?
I don't know.
Well, we're at the Crown Motel.
I'm going to find the number for the motel.
Why?
I'm going to call and ask for Amanda Brooke.
Hello?
Hi, yeah.
I need you to put me in touch with a guest.
Her name's Amanda Brooke.
Thank you.
What are you looking for?
A pencil.
What do you need a pencil for?
There's a thing with the notepad.
What is that?
It's like a...
Is that a code, or something?
Hello, again.
Hello, again.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we actually want to check out.
Check out?
Yeah. I mean, we can pay full price or whatever, but we don't need this room any more.
That's weird.
Weird in what way?
Well, you're the second person to do that tonight.
Do what?
Check into this room, 34, and then check right out again.
Some cowboy did the same thing earlier.
Cowboy?
Yeah, cowboy hat.
Oh, damn.
You know what?
I think I forgot something in the room.
I'm actually going to take this and head back up.
We'll be back in a little bit.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Look at this.
No.
That.
Jim.
Hey. You waiting to get in?
Good morning.
Good morning.
I thought you'd changed to the day shift?
I did.
Why aren't you at work?
I called in sick.
What are you doing?
Reading about breaking codes.
Breaking codes?
Why are you reading about breaking codes?
Doug, did you actually go to this website?
- What website?
- The website on the card.
Look, look.
Amanda Brooke.
Amanda Brooke.
Click on "Yes, let me in".
It wants me to join.
Go back.
Scroll down a little.
Take the free tour.
You seem pretty familiar with how this kind of site works.
Just click on it.
- Hey, Gail.
- What?
Would you mind if
I smoked a pipe in here?
You have a pipe?
No, but I'm going to go buy one,
I think.
You're going to buy a pipe?
Yeah.
Sherlock Holmes smokes a pipe to help him think.
Not a ridiculous, stupid, enormous one like Basil Rathbone, but he does have one.
Hello, there. Welcome to Broadway
Tobacco. I'm Virgil.
Hi. Doug.
Hi, Doug.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What can I do for you today?
I'm looking for a pipe.
What type of pipe are you looking for?
I'm not really sure.
Erm...
What appeals to you?
What about that one, second in from the right?
That's a Georgia.
That's a very nice pipe.
How's that feel in your hands?
It's nice.
How much is this?
Actually, I was looking for something more like around $20.
Are they all that expensive?
We've probably got one down there for you.
This one here.
That one might be in your budget.
How does that feel?
It's OK.
You know how the other one has, like, that hook?
I kind of like that.
Yeah, the design of them makes them more expensive.
Yeah.
I guess this one's pretty utilitarian, huh?
Yes, it is.
Oh, shit!
What?
I forgot to get tobacco.
- They had it?
- Yeah. And look.
- What's that?
- It's the magazine.
Why do you need that?
Maybe there's clues.
Is it good?
Mmm. It's OK.
It's not really helping me think.
Gail!
What?
Why didn't you answer?
I just called you!
I didn't know you rang.
You and Carlos.
Why didn't you answer?
I didn't hear it!
Listen, I have it!
I figured it out.
What?
The numbers. Baseball stats!
What?
The numbers. It's batting average and on base.
You know how the first number's smaller than the rest?
I knew Rachel didn't like baseball!
She's using that book like a code book.
The first number in that set of numbers is 70.
Then all the other ones are in two and three hundreds.
That's because they're baseball stats and they correspond to a certain player.
I guess you add them up and maybe it spells something out.
I didn't figure that part out yet.
You've got to take me to the library now.
This is it.
Clete Boyer.
B O Y E R.
Batting average, 287.
On base, 367.
Bob Robertson.
Batting, 270.
Al Oliver.
Batting, 270.
Let's say it's the first letter of the first name of a player.
So we have L-J-I-B-B-H.
That doesn't sound like anything.
All right. First letter of last names.
T-H-R-E-E-P-M.
3pm.
3pm, all right.
S-U-N-S-E.
B-R - 3pm - S-U-N-S-E...
Sun. Sunday?
- Sunday.
- Sunday.
3pm, Sunday. Today.
It's 2.48 right now.
All right.
S-E, hold on.
S-E-B-R-O-O-K.
S-E, South East Brook.
Southeast Brooklyn.
Southeast Brooklyn Street!
We've got to go.
But we don't have the cross street.
Doesn't matter. We got to go.
Bring this book.
I have to check it out first, Doug.
What is that?
It's a knife.
Doug, why do you have a knife?
Just in case.
Doug, give me the knife, please.
No!
Doug!
I'm going down there.
I'll be right back.
I'm just going to...
It's fine.
Doug!
Doug!
What?
Hello?
Doug, it's Rachel!
What the fuck are you doing, Doug?
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Me?
Yeah! Why are you checked in with a fake name?
You said you were training for a law office job!
- What are you doing snooping around?
- You lied to me.
Tell me what the fuck is going on.
I already figured out most of it anyway.
Amanda Brooke, Sunday, 3pm,
Southeast Brooklyn.
I did some investigating, and I've concluded that you're involved in some fucked-up shit!
Don't walk away and try to blow me off. I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.
Fine.
I was watching the phone.
I found a place where I could see the phone and not be seen.
Why didn't you want to be seen?
Because I don't have what I'm supposed to have.
What are you supposed to have?
I got sent here from Chicago with a briefcase of money.
What do you mean? Like an actual briefcase full of money?
How much money?
I don't know. The briefcase was locked.
Who was it for?
I don't know, exactly.
Well, what do you know about what happened to it?
I went out for a couple of minutes to get some coffee, and when I got back, it was gone.
Did you notice anything else gone?
Anything move?
No, I don't think so.
I don't know.
Did anybody know you had it?
I don't know.
Do you know a Jim?
Somebody named Jim ate Chinese food in the room next to yours.
Jim Warden.
Who's Jim Warden?
He's the one who set this whole thing up in the first place.
He's a photographer from Chicago.
You go to his apartment and take photos.
Anyway, I needed money again.
Really badly, so I called him.
And he wasn't in Chicago any more, he moved here.
He said that he had something better than pictures, that he had some friends who needed money moved from Chicago to Portland, you know, by someone who wasn't involved, someone neutral, someone who didn't want to ask questions.
So I said yes, and I took the briefcase.
And now it's gone.
Well, the people that you're delivering it to don't know that you don't have it.
They want you to drop it off two days from now, somewhere by Mount Hood.
What are you talking about?
Got the code from the payphone.
Even so, how am I going to find the briefcase in two days?
This asshole Jim Warden has it.
We'll just have to find him.
I'll find him.
OK.
'Yeah?'
Hey, I need to borrow your car today.
'Huh?'
I need to borrow your car.
'OK, er, can we talk about this when
I get out of the shower, please?'
Yeah, I guess so.
You can borrow my car.
Huh?
Yeah, if you need it today, you can borrow it.
Yeah, but don't you work at 12?
Yeah.
I'm going to need it longer than that.
Dude, you've got to work, too.
I'm not going in. You'll have to say I'm still sick.
Why, what's going on?
Look at this.
Look at the photo credit.
Yeah?
It's Jim Warden.
The alleged cowboy.
Rachel said that he shoots out of his apartment, at least he did in Chicago, and this is the most recent issue of this magazine, so I can only assume that this picture was taken from his apartment here.
So what?
So look at the picture.
It's a naked chick, man.
Look out the window.
It's a palm tree.
Exactly.
How many palm trees do you know of in Portland?
Not many.
Right?
Yeah.
Right.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, he definitely lives here.
His name's on the buzzer.
I feel like we should have pistachios or something.
Isn't that what people do on stakeouts?
I don't know.
Yeah, we should have pistachios.
There might be food in the glove box.
Swedish fish.
Want one?
No, they get stuck in my teeth.
What we going to do if we see this guy?
Follow him.
I feel like we should be doing something right now.
Nah.
We've got to hang back.
Just wait.
Man, I feel like somebody should be with Rachel.
Can you blow off work?
Yeah, man.
Doug, what's going on?
Hey.
Took a long time.
Yeah, the bus was really slow.
Has anything happened yet?
Not a thing.
Are you sure this is the right place?
Yeah, the name's on the buzzer.
I can only be in the driver's seat, actually.
What difference does it make?
I just feel uncomfortable when you drive.
Happy now?
Yes.
Maybe we should play a game.
What game?
I don't know. 20 questions?
I don't really like those road trip games.
Well, just talk about something.
I don't know.
I've got a question for you.
And don't get offended,
I'm not trying to make fun of you.
OK.
Do you have any friends?
Of course.
I haven't seen you hanging out with anyone.
Don't you hang out with anybody from high school or anything?
No. The only people that are left from high school are people I do not want to hang out with.
I guess I didn't tell you I had a boyfriend recently, huh?
When?
We broke up in November.
- What was his name?
- Sam.
How long did you date?
Six months.
Six months?
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't know, just...
Where did you meet this guy?
I don't really want to say.
Did you meet him on the internet?
No... Yes.
What a loser!
I know, I know.
That's not so bad.
It's pretty bad.
I know a kid in Chicago who's getting married to a girl he met on the internet.
Yeah, I know, it happens a lot, but it's still weird.
Sam was cool.
I liked Sam.
What happened?
Our first date was walking over the Hawthorne Bridge.
That's considered a date?
I think that the cool thing about it, because it's not really a date.
We met at the fountain on Salmon
Street and just walked across.
It was pretty fun.
That's it?
Well, we had dinner.
Who's this guy? Look.
Turn the car round.
- We should just park here.
- Yeah, just pull up.
- He's got it.
- I know.
He's pulling into a parking space.
What should I do?
Keep driving.
Look at that!
That's the truck from the motel.
That's it?
Here, pull up here.
Put into this space.
What should we do?
Think.
We should call the cops.
No. If we call the police, we're never seeing that briefcase again.
How are you guys doing?
I'm all right.
You need another drink, or...?
Er, no.
I think I'm all right.
Good, OK. Let me know.
Thanks.
Looks like they're almost done.
Doug.
Do you think we should just take the briefcase? Just grab it?
No.
Why not?
It's just sitting there.
We'll just come out of the bathroom, and I'll just walk in between that aisle, and then
I can just grab it and run.
Shouldn't I do it?
No! I am a much faster runner than you. I ran track.
Listen, you've got to go outside.
You've got to get the car and just meet me out front.
We have to do this, like, now.
I don't know. I feel our strength is that we know who they are, and they don't have a clue who we are. We should keep it that way.
Oh, I have an idea.
I have a really good idea.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you guys have a lost-and-found?
Yeah.
I was just wondering.
I know this is going to sound really weird, but I'm going to this costume party later tonight, and I don't have a costume, and I was just wondering if you had some weird, old lost-and-found stuff that's been sitting there for months.
Yeah.
That's all right?
That's fine.
Whatever's been there longest.
Yeah, we have loads of stuff.
I'll be right back.
Great. Thank you so much.
All right, give me a dime.
Why?
Because I'm going to use it to take the licence plate off your car.
Why?
So then they can't follow us.
As soon as I leave, count two minutes.
OK.
Don't do anything until two minutes.
You ready?
Keys.
Oh, yeah.
Doug!
- What?
- Get in the car!
What took you so long?
I don't know!
I was nervous, and it took me a minute to get all my nerve to do it.
All right.
It wasn't that hard, though.
It was actually really easy,
I just took it and ran, and he didn't even expect it.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. Why did you get out of the car?
Because you were taking too long.
Oh, my God.
Gail. What?
I slashed their tyres.
What?! How did you do that?
I got the idea when I was coming out.
I figured if I slash his tyres, they couldn't follow us.
I told you my knife was useful!
Wait, I've got to drive slower.
I've got to drive slower, because
I don't want to get pulled over.
I can't believe we did that.
We just did that.
Yeah, we totally did.
OK, wait.
I'm just going to keep going straight.
You OK?
Yeah. Yeah.
All right. I'm going to call Carlos, tell him to bring Rachel here.
OK.
I'll just be a minute.
You want to listen to music?
Yeah.
I don't know what's on most of those.
Think they're mostly mix tapes you made me in high school, actually.
Hold on. I think there's something at the beginning you might like.

She got stuck.
All right, let's get this thing moving.
I took April's regular into the VIP room and he gave me $7,000.
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck that bitch.
She freak out?
Yeah. Is there anything more unflattering than patterns on hotel rooms?
I know.
Why can't they just use solid colors?
It's easier to hide the stains.
That's so right.
We gotta get that fucker on the stand.
Oh. What are you waiting for?
Hi, Mike.
Don't you know what time it is?
The Fire chief is responsible for all decisions made from the Fire department, right?
Uh, for the most part, yeah.
If the chief of the fire department was deleting work orders which directly resulted in sending non-working trucks to a fire, that's his fault?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Then it's all bullshit they fired a guy for falsifying his resume.
It's 'cause he exposed the work orders.
It's a little late to change our tactic, isn't it?
He was wrapped up in the price of repairs but it didn't matter because they were never gonna do the repairs.
Hey, shut the fuck up.
Mike, where are you?
Just hanging out with some friends.
You know what? You get some sleep.
I got this, okay?
Bye!
Hi.
Are you still sleeping?
Yes.
Ah.
You're joining the jury.
The reason my client is fired was because he falsified his resume, not because he went above your head and reported that trucks were not getting fixed and people were dying as a result.
Say yes.
Yes.
You also said you only went to review my client's resume after he went to the media.
Correct?
On May 9th, a truck went to the house of
Alex Foreman with a broken wafer pump.
That resulted in Mr.
Foreman burning to death.
On June 17th, another truck went to the house of Crystal Dougan also with a non-working pump, also resulting in Ms.
Dougan burning to death.
Is that true?
It is.
No shit? Damn.
He knew he sent non-working fire trucks to houses on fire?
He says he didn't.
You said the trucks were broken because the work orders were deleted.
The work order could be anything.
It could be a tire alignment, it could be a tear in the fucking seat fabric.
But it wasn't a tear in the fucking seat fabric.
The damn pumps wouldn't work, right?
So, if the work orders had been deleted and you didn't know the trucks needed to be fixed, they were never gonna be repaired to begin with.
After you realized the paperwork system for the work orders were so screwed up that you accidentally approved two fire trucks that didn't actually have working water pumps, realizing this, because my client exposed the fire department's bureaucratic mess to the public, after you realized this, you felt the best usage of your time would not be to go back and fix the system in an effort to prevent the death of more innocent people.
You thought the first thing you should do was looking to my client's job application and resume even though he'd already been working for the department for four years.
That may be what it looks like.
I'm sorry, sir, it's a simple question.
Which did you look into first?
The work order system that had just caused the death of two innocent people, or a four-year-old job application of an employee that had just publicly humiliated you?
And I remind your, sir, that you're under oath.
I guess that the application was first.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
Have you or someone you love been injured in an accident due to the negligence of another person?
Call Danzinger and Weiss.
The phone call is free and so is the consultation.
You need professional, experienced trial lawyers that care about their clients to get the cash settlements that you and your family deserve.
Don't wait. Call today.
Are you serious?
The fact is that auto accidents and negligence result in higher personal injury awards and higher jury awards.
90 % of them never even see the court room.
You should really take me serious.
You should have a drink, counselor.
We're celebrating.
I remind you that we would've made more money if we had settled today's case before the trial.
Should I remind you that we won?
Oh, damn.
We won't stay long.
Like five minutes, okay?
Oh, no, thanks.
Have you seen my husband?
Oh, no.
Beer, tequila, Jack, rum?
Fine.
Mike's my legal aide.
Please, tell me you're joking.
Uh, no.
He really hasn't changed since eighth grade, has he?
No, he hasn't.
Have you seen my fucking husband?
I think he might be out back.
I haven't ever heard of a goddamn coaster, you fucking animal!
Can we go now?
How did you get to teach your class tonight, by the way?
I didn't.
You can't keep canceling your class.
The students have been complaining.
Why? They're all here.
Oh. And the lady, she's still waiting on those articles on the transportation.
Jesus Christ, you're worse than all legal acts.
No more talk about work.
Everybody, no more talk about work.
This is a party.
It's an interesting party, too, Mike.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey. What the fuck is that?
It's an alligator.
It's just left outside, walk around.
Hey, listen, guys.
I can't keep having my firm give you work is gonna take you twice as long...
Twice as long to find the 1994 case of Kings County vs. Stevenson which protects the rights of people with disabilities to keep their pets, including animals used for emotional support in cases like depression.
Regardless of the landlord's policy making the eviction of your client illegal, and upping the value of what will now be a really nice settlement.
You're welcome.
I'll have it for you by Monday.
Thank you.
You guys are gonna go see that nurse tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
All right. I gotta go.
What do you mean you gotta go?
I can't stay.
Rita's in the car right now.
Your lizard tried to bite her foot.
Was she wearing white shoes?
He hates those.
Don't go. You just got here.
I got a white supremacist I want you to straighten out.
Are you serious?
It'd be a great conversation.
Jamie, what the fuck? Are you nuts?
There are people upstairs.
In our bed, in our fucking bed, you asshole!
Jamie, we should talk about this, but this is not the way.
Apologize.
Apologize!

Mr. Health Nut.
You treat your digestive tract like a sewer.
All that soda is gonna destroy your esophagus.
So, did you get your gun back?
Not yet.
You all right?
She'll be back soon.
So, after I got over myself a bit, I decided to fight.
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
I mean, AIDS isn't a death sentence any more.
And the medicine gets better and better every year.
Oh, sure, yes, of course.
This is all we had.
David, a glass?
That's fine. We're okay.
Thank you, David.
Can I play with Mr. Deedles?
Of course, hon. Of course.
Anyway, Daryl said if anybody could help, it'd be you fellas.
My friend Jeffrey invented this after my accident.
It's a safety needle.
Can't prick yourself, can't be reused.
A safety needle like this could prevent incidents like mine from ever happening.
And the hospital refuses to even look at if.
Excuse me, so you were injured on the job, but are you receiving worker's compensation?
Yes, they've kept up with that end of it.
Uh, unfortunately
I don't think there's anything else that can be done.
That's all of the law provides for and, uh...
It's really all we can get you.
But I-I don't want anything else.
Not personally anyway.
You see, my case is not an isolated incident.
This thing is happening to front line health care professionals all the time.
We're very sorry.
We have to make them use this.
The bottom line is, the hospitals are knowing they're putting their employees at risk letting them get hurt.
People are dying.
And then again I feel this tap.
More like a late dump. it's a babe.
What I'm saying is we've been netting on average for each injury settlement about 50 to 20 K, right?
Keep stringing a few of these together a month and we can actually be in the black by February.
How often do you think that needle stick thing happens?
You think it's like a daily thing?
I don't know.
There's no case here anyway.
If we could prove the hospitals were negligent, our clients could be every hospital worker in the country.
Mike, we can't afford to go on a fishing expedition right now.
I think we should go meet that guy.
The guy that invented the safety needle.
If you come with me to meet Jeffrey the inventor,
I'll give you three focused days.
Three extremely focused, eight-hour days, interviewing as many accident victims trying to squeeze the insurance company for an extra $12 as you want. Deal?
Deal.
Give me that clamp.
Jeffrey Dancort.
That's me.
Paul Danzinger.
We're lawyers from Danzinger and Weiss.
He a lawyer, too?
This is Mike Weiss, my partner.
I was working as a mechanical and structural engineer when Vicky got stuck.
So, you guys met her?
Uh, yeah, we did.
It's a terrible shame.
She's my best friend's kid.
That really hit me.
I spent about a year working on developing the concept.
Sooner or later the National Institute of Health gave me a $50,000-grant to develop a prototype for reproduction.
Anyone ever use it?
San Antonio Memorial Hospital used it for two years.
How's that working out?
Not a single needle stick incident in two years.
So, there's no way you can get stuck with this thing.
Can't get stuck with it, can't reuse it.
Doctor's love it and nurses are begging for it.
Only San Antonio
Memorial will buy it.
Why?
I thought you guys could tell me that.
To start you should call at least 200 hospitals over the next couple of weeks.
Two hundred hospitals.
I know it sounds a lot, but we're gonna need to do is get a data base...
I've already approached
2,000 hospitals.
What'd say when you showed them the needle?
They asked me to leave.
Is there any way we can sue a hospital for not buying something that saves people's lives?
So called miracle drug allegedly causes client to suffer a stroke.
He's currently waging his battle against another pharmaceutical company.
Top personal injury, attorney Mark Lenier.
This is absolutely outrageous.
This is big pharma deciding that they can take my client and make him a Guinea pig, test their medicines on him, make their money off of him, and then just disregard him and throw him away when he breaks.
And that's outrageous and we're gonna stop it.
We're gonna stop it right here in this court house.
He's good.
He's very good.
Thank you for agreeing to talk with me.
Sure, no problem. Talk.
On the phone you said you were aware of the high number of accidental needle sticks.
How about 800,000 a year?
Is that an accurate number?
You don't believe me?
No, it's not that
I don't believe you.
I just wanna know if it's an accurate number.
I, Karen Brown, head of the Texas
Nurses' Association District Five do officially swear that that number is accurate. Better?
I'm just trying to get a better understanding here.
Good. Then here's what you need to understand. Okay?
The major cause of these diseases, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, affecting all front line health care workers is because of accidental needle sticks.
Okay?
Okay. The reason I'm here is 'cause my client has invented a safety needle that can prevent this from ever happening again.
Then don't talk to me.
Who should I talk to?
The purchasing department.
Purchasing. Thank you.
Mr. Weismann.
Weiss. Mike, please.
Mr. Weiss, I cannot and will not look at your needle.
Because of the purchasing contract that the hospital has.
Will you at least look at this data?
No.
Would you mind telling me why?
I don't want you to show me your data, and I don't want you to show this product to my nurses because they'll want it, and they can't have it.
What kind of a shirt was it?
Was it a nice shirt?
Yes, Mr.
Paul, it was nice.
Was it a special shirt?
Special?
Maybe it was, a, uh, gift.
It was just a shirt.
How much did you say it cost?
Uh.
I don't remember.
Let's say $70.
Sylvia, could you, uh, try Mike again, please?
Not if you wanna leave with all ten of those tiny little fingers, young man.
I just left him a fifth message.
Mike.
Paul, you're awake.
You're not gonna believe this.
I worked my way into a meeting with the director of Infection at the hospital.
What?
That was today? Oh, shit, man.
Hello?
He said that Safety Point is fucking essential to the safety of hospital...
I mean, we're looking at a shitload of violations under State Law.
Several violations on a shitload of counts under false claims.
I'm looking for it.
Take it, take it.
And I'll call him after lunch.
All right.
I'll call him after lunch.
The Nursing Association I represent requested I call in hopes that you'd help them with their campaign in regards to this matter.
If you'd give me a call back, that'd be great, if not...
Senator O'Hara's from Nebraska.
Nebraska?
Yeah, there's only 100 centers.
We could call...
You mean we're like a team?
That we agreed upon things then we do them together?
I said I was sorry.
Twenty-two straight hours...
I'm sorry.
Did you get the file I sent over?
I got it. GPO's have been bribed to buy certain products for the hospitals.
I sent it over to Dancort already.
In the '80s, these GPO's got so big, they managed to pass a bill in Congress allowing them a 3 % commission from the manufacturers they're supposedly negotiating with.
We have a great case here.
Yeah, we do.
I'm sorry, what was your name?
Susie.
Would you give us a second, please?
Sure. I'll be right outside.
Look. Mike, I think that we have a great case here, potentially really great, but I need you to be practical with me for a minute.
Like hospitals letting people die because Safety Point costs five cents more?
Mike, I'm in, all right? I'm in.
It's just that if this thing gets too big, you need to let me bring in another firm to help out.
This thing is gonna settle by Christmas.
It could drag for years. It's a monopoly case and we're not an antitrust firm.
What kinda firm we wanna be, Paul?
This is gonna make us.
It could break us.
It's gonna be extremely expensive.
Dancort can't afford to pay us and I can't do enough injury cases on my own.
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry I messed the fucking line.
Mike, listen to me. I'm telling you that we don't have the resources to take this thing all the way, so please.
I need your word that when I tell you that the well is running dry, we bring in another firm to help out, okay?
Yeah. Yes.
Can we get to work now, please?
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?
No, not at all. Come in.
Thanks for coming down.
Have a seat.
Well, right here
I got an invitation to a supplier's to attend a conference from the United Medical
Health Supplies people.
Largest group purchasing organization in the country.
And guess how much it costs to attend the conference?
How much?
Twenty-five grand?
What does that get you?
I went to one of these dog and pony shows about three years back for the low price of 75 grand, and I didn't get jack shit.
Hey. Mike Weiss.
How are you?
I am excited.
These GPO guys represent over 4,000 health care providers in the US and they supply 'em with $80 billion in medical products every year.
Walkers and canes and wheelchairs, commodes, bedpans.
The only way to get your product into hospitals is to go through these fuckers, so you have to pay thousands of dollars for the opportunity to grovel in front of a couple of United Medical Health
Supply muckety-mucks.
Mike Weiss.
Thanks for coming.
But it's all just horse shit.
You need real money to get anything done...
Gonna help prevent accidents from happening to your patients and employees.
And over time, it's gonna save you money and it's gonna save lives.
Does that sound like something that might interest you?
Are you aware there are over 800,000 accidental needle sticks a year?
For 25,000, you can't even stay for lunch.
How much does it cost to stay for lunch?
Millions.

Let's just begin.
Okay. Mr. Dancort, we are here today so we can ask you some questions regarding your allegations against my client.
Before we begin, I would like to establish for the record that you're aware that the deposition is sworn testimony under oath.
Yeah, yeah.
The court reporter will be recording the session in the event that we would choose to show the jury your testimony in a court of law.
If at any time during these proceedings you feel the need for a break, please feel free to do so.
Is everything clear so far?
Is that a yes or a no, sir?
Yes.
Thank you. I'd like to start by asking questions about your background.
Would you please tell me your full name?
Jeffrey Matthew Dancort.
Could you spell that, please?
Jeffrey, J-E-F-F-R-E-Y.
Matthew, M-A-T-T-H-E-W.
Dancort, D-A -N-C-O-R- T.
Thank you.
Current address, please.
1429 Merryweather drive,
Houston, Texas, 74561.
Thank you.
Is that an apartment or a house?
It's a house.
For how long have you lived there?
I don't know, about ten years.
About ten years or exactly ten years?
We moved in there in 1986.
That would be 12 years.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Sounds right or is right?
If you moved there in 1986, that would be 12 years.
Be polite.
Yes, that's right, sir.
One moment, please.
Right.
Oh, Shit.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Fucking.
Fuck!
Besides football, did you play any other sport?
What the hell are we talking about football?
We case here to discuss the case.
Let's discuss the case.
We wanted to get some simple background information.
I'd like to request that my client take a break now.
Let the record reflect that the plaintiff's attorney has asked for a break without answering the question.
That's okay. Keep going.
Just keep going.
Continuing, besides football, did you play any other...
Excuse me. Nathaniel Price.
I am.
Mike Weiss.
Guess I'll be seeing you in court.
I'm looking forward to it.
Good.
Excuse me.
Where the fuck were you?
Not here. Outside.
And what was the name of your first dog, Mr. Dancort?
Oh, well, Rufus.
And how do you spell that, Mr. Dancort?
R-U-F-U-S. And were you fond of this dog, Mr. Dancort?
Not particularly. Does that mean you dislike dogs, Mr. Dancort?
They showed themselves today.
They wouldn't have brought up the big guns if they weren't scared of you.
Yeah, they're terrified.
Scared fucking shitless all twelve of them.
The reason I wasn't there today is 'cause
I was talking to a good buddy of mine.
Henry Matthews, editor-in-chief of the Houston Chronicle.
They're going to run a story on you.
I'll see you guys back at the office.
Houston Chronicle.
This is attorney Mike Weiss calling for Henry Matthews.
We don't have a Henry Matthews.
We have a Henry Mathers.
That's what I meant.
Henry Mathers. Thank you.
He's not in.
Would you like his voice mail?
Sure.
One moment, please.
As soon as the sun goes down,
I'll be over there.
Hey.
Law and order. What's up?
What you need?
Two hundred.
This is Mike.
What the hell kinda friends have you got, Mike?
Maybe you got some other friends who can help us out.
It's how these people operate.
They must've threatened the paper.
I don't know what they did or how they did it.
I've just spent hours on the phone dealing with my investors, my wife, my mother. This article claims
I'm having an affair with my assistant.
Are you having an affair with your assistant?
No.
Then what are you worried about?
They're just trying to smear you.
This is to be expected.
They're gonna try and make as many people hate your guts as possible before we go to trial.
Paul is making a lot of traction with a lot of investors for you.
When I get these motherfuckers in front of the judge, we're gonna get your needle in every single hospital in the country.
Stay strong.
I'll see you in court.
Is that Armani?
Believe it.
Is that a tux?
It's Armani.
All rise.
The United States Federal
District Court is now in session.
The Honorable Judge
William Black presiding.
Be seated.
Right.
We are here on plaintiff's motion to compel the production of documents that the plaintiff claims are necessary.
Since the defendants are not allowing him...
Your Honor, the defendant's client has...
No, no, Mr. Weiss.
Sorry, Your Honor.
It's an extraordinary large request for production.
Which documents must you have and why?
Request for production one.
All exclusive long term and multi-product contracts between United Medical Health
Supplies and all hospitals over the last ten years.
We feel this information will prove the GPO is engaged in anticompetitive behavior, price fixing, and a contract that requires the company to buy products even though they may not be the safest available.
Under Dakota vs. PMI Industries, the Supreme Court found this information.
Mr. Price, your response.
Judge, this is a fishing expedition with no merit.
To expect thousands of pages of documents is unduly burdensome to my client's time and money.
And the Dakota case is not on point.
Next request.
Request of production 75.
All donations made by the defendant to health care organizations or political entities.
Political contributions are not discoverable under Benet vs. Lappin.
Contributions to health care organizations are not political.
Next request, please.
All purchase history of syringe manufacturers made by the GPO in the past ten years.
We feel that this information proves that United Medical Health
Supplies has created a monopoly by buying syringe manufacturers, then jacking up the price.
Your Honor, the purchase and sale of businesses are all of public records.
My client shouldn't have to go through the expense.
Your Honor, we've submitted cases supporting our position.
The law clearly states we're entitled to these documents.
All right. My decision is as follows.
The court denies document production one, two, three.
Your Honor, we have the right...
Request of production 1 through 12 denied.
13, 14, 15 are firm, but I'm limiting production to one year, not ten years.
Sixteen through twenty-nine, denied.
Court adjourned.
You must be so relieved.
We are ecstatic.
It's been three years in the making and we finally got some justice.
How do you suppose the jury arrived at a $53 million verdict?
I think the jury took that figure from the profits the company made off not putting the safety feature on.
They are not gonna let corporate greed trump the value of human life.
Let's talk about the family.
We're dealing with an eight-year-old boy.
How are they doing right now?
They're doing okay, but the eight-year-old boy, he goes home with...
Safety Point's a bigger case than that.
You know that every American will get into at least one car accident in their lifetime?
You know what the biggest reason is that people get into car accidents?
Eating while driving?
Mm. No, that's only 49 %.
Talking to the other passenger, 81 %.
Fascinating.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Hi, fellas.
Are you boys hungry?
Yeah, sure.
Well.
The process is one where you fight in the courtroom for three weeks, and then you've got an appeal going.
And then we'll have that fight and we'll win that fight.
Could you bring us a couple of orders of shrimp cocktail, please?
I'm allergic to shellfish.
Good to see you.
Listen, I-I don't wanna be here today as a law firm.
I'd like to talk.
One person to another.
What do you want?
I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't wanna see you two going down, and you're going down.
Do I care who wins or loses?
Hardly. I have a job,
I do my job and I get paid at the end of the day either way.
How much you get paid?
You're funny, Mike.
I like that you have a sense of humor.
What can we do for you?
You know who my client is.
You're looking at 300 attorneys, two dozen of the top anti-trust experts in the country, millions of dollars in resources, connections in every corner of the health care system, not to mention the justice system.
Don't forget the newspapers.
The banks.
Mm-hm. That's correct.
Your client, he's something else.
He's an idealistic bumpkin who's been knocking on every door in the city trying to get a loan.
And you know why he's not getting one?
'Cause my client didn't want him to.
So, are you saying that there's a possibility of us actually settling this fairly?
Absolutely not. That's the only thing that my client can't afford.
If they gave you a settlement, they'll be looking at lawsuits the rest of their lives.
They aren't gonna do that.
So, just do yourselves a favor.
Cut your losses now.
You guys got no case.
No way out.
Well, we appreciate your concern.
Son, you can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit.
Good day.
Bob.
She left a note.
Come on, buddy.
Providing the best health care products from Asia to Africa to here at home.
United Medical Health Supplies.
Together in caring.
What's up?
My new equity partners just backed out on Dancort.
That was the last investor.
Sorry.
Me foo.
Is there anything I can do?
Can you convince another firm to come on board and take over the case?
Sorry. You need something?
Bills. The most pressing being the electric and the phone.
I got an extension till Monday.
It's okay.
I'll just figure something out.
Hey, hon. Sorry.
I should be about ten more minutes...
No. No, no, no, no.
Can you drive? Okay.
Get in the car and go straight to the hospital.
I will meet you there.
No, get straight to the hospital.

Nicole Morris, sex therapist.
Who am I speaking with?
Hey, I'm Mike.
Are you okay, Mike?
Do you need someone to talk to?
I've been better.
My wife left me.
She, uh, she took all my furniture.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Yeah.
At least she left me my alligator.
You know my alligator is 49 years old?
Wow. So cool for a pet.
Actually not for an alligator.
You don't sound that old, Mike.
Me? No. No, I'm, uh,
I'm in my prime.
Is that your baby crying?
No. That's the, uh, that's the office next door.
It's a pediatrics therapist.
A little late for a baby to be at the doctor, isn't it?
Tell me what's on your mind, Mike.
I don't like to be alone.
It feels better now that you're talking to someone, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Hey, you think we could meet up?
Possibly.
Mike, do you have a credit card?
Yeah, hang on.
Immediate medical attention.
I'd like to encourage you to fake yourselves to our clinic.
It's just two blocks away on Main Street. Please.
If you have a stomach ache, a sprained ankle, anything that does not need immediate medical attention...
Pete, don't.
You're gonna get fired.
They're not gonna kick me out today.
What's going on?
Who's getting kicked out?
Welcome to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
They canceled my insurance today.
Pre-existing conditions.
What kind? Propensity to be stabbed by sharp objects?
Some goddamn thing.
Let me go talk to somebody.
No, no, no. Please, it's okay.
I'll take care of it.
Pete, why don't you get the boxes for him?
David, Kia, you go help him out, okay?
Come on, guys.
Hey, guys.
Why don't you let me talk to somebody, Vicky?
You okay?
Thank you.
Sure. You all right?
What about you?
Oh, that's... Yeah.
I, uh, I'm good.
Jill, this is Mike.
Hello.
So strange being on the other side of things.
Having all the floor nurses stand over me.
I trained some of them.
They got these crazy patterns on their shirts these days, like supposed to calm the patients but... it ends up making you feel dizzy.
Mm.
So, you said you had something for me.
You know, it's true what they say about the stages you go through.
Denial, anger, acceptance, blah, blah, blah.
But it doesn't happen quite as cleanly as the pamphlets tell you.
In reality, it's a stew.
Everything happens all at the same time.
Just because you can't really get over the dark parts, it doesn't mean you can't get to the good ones.
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places.
There you go.
Thank you.
Where did you get this?
Don't worry where we got them from.
Hey.
Thompson Needles is coming out with their own line of safety needle.
You think they're threatened by Safety Point or what?
These are internal documents from United
Medical Health Supplies proving...
Mike, stop it. Kim had to go to the hospital last night.
What?
She's fine. False alarm.
Is everything okay?
No, everything's not okay.
Our insurance lapsed.
What do you mean our insurance lapsed?
You told Sylvia to pay for you to attend the United Medical Health Supplies dinner from the firm's account, and that you would pay the insurance bill later.
I'm sorry. It's not how I meant for it to happen.
That's not how you meant for it to happen.
Kim is pregnant, Mike.
Look,
I don't see how we can possibly continue the case.
Mike, we agreed that we would drop this.
I agreed to take in another firm.
I never agreed to drop anything.
I've called 50 firms and no one will touch it.
I'm not dropping the case.
That's not your decision to make.
Do you wanna call
Dancort or should I?
It's too big, Mike.
I have Senator O'Reilly calling from
Washington, D.C. for you, Mike.
Hello?
Then the GPO, in our case
United Medical Health Supplies will draw up an exclusive contract with Thompson Needles, who in turn give them a kickback for every needle sold.
Boxing out any competition regardless of how superior or how much safer their product is.
If Thompson Needles is gonna come out with a safe needle they'd have to retool, recast the molding. They'd have to replace their entire assembly line.
Something they're not interested in doing because of the high upfront costs.
Hm. Ingenious.
This is a tremendous innovation.
As you know, I've been addressing safety issues for hospital workers for years.
I'm intrigued by your product, Mr.
Dancort, to say the least...
Thank you.
This is a bill proposal mandating the use of sound needles.
We're in the process of circulating a petition in every single hospital across the United States, so we can mobilize nurses' unions an associations to help you lobby.
Right. We have some interest from some financial institutions regarding investment packages, and we're gonna try and get them in every hospital across the country.
Senator, you're giving us the impetus to safe thousands of lives.
Incredible.
That was incredible.
Great job.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Are you happy?
Excuse me, Mr. Weiss.
Could I speak with you for just a second?
Yeah.
Senator.
Mr. Weiss.
I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and your colleagues bringing this to my attention.
As I said, the safety and well-being of health care workers has been high on my agenda from day one, and we also agree that urgent action is what is called for.
That's great. It's... it's just-it's good to meet someone who is on board to fight the good fight.
It would be an honor to offer my support, but only if you drop this case and let Mr. Dancort team up with another firm.
The cocaine under your nose.
That's, um...
I'm not judging you, Mike.
You're not the first person to lobby a Senator hopped up on narcotics and I'm sure you're not even the first person to do so today, but there's absolutely no way we can put you before the House Committee let alone the Senate.
Wait, just...
My client has approached every law firm in Texas.
They've all said no.
He's broke.
This is...
This is a major antitrust case.
You know the type of money and muscle that goes into it.
Mr. Dancort does not have the money to sit across from the receptionist at some of these firms.
My partner and I are the only ones who are willing to take this risk.
We believe in this case.
We believe in it.
Give me a chance.
I'll go back to Houston.
I'll get myself cleaned up.
Okay.
But know this.
You only get one chance.
Don't fuck it up.
Understood.
They're talking to fucking Senators now.
They're knocking on doors, chickens with their heads cut off.
We need to fix this now, Nathaniel.
I'll take care of it.
They're losing patience.
I just need a bit more time.
I'll try.
But you need to hurry.
Or it's not gonna be good for any of us.
This is a waste of time.
Mike.
Show some respect, huh?
I'll show some respect by winning the case that put her in the ground.
Fuck this.
Fuck.
Come on.
The reason you...
The reason why you should invest in
Safety Point is because it's safe and it's affective.
It's a life saving... it's a life saving device.
It's a life saving device.
It's a life saving device.
Your involvement...
Are you all right, Mike?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You want something?
I was always more of a tinkerer than a businessman.
It's how I thought about myself anyway.
My first office was in the corner of a bicycle shop.
My first customer was an amputee with an artificial leg.
Hi. Good evening.
I'm Paul Danzinger, and, uh,
I'd like to welcome you on behalf of my partner,
Michael Weiss, and of course the man who really brought us all together tonight,
Mr. Jeffrey Dancort.
I've been doing this a long time, you know.
Long, long, long time.
And what I've come to realize is that there's just people out there that all they wanna do is fuck you up.
Right. You know what
I'm talking about.
So, on this one I just decided to say fuck it.
'Cause you know what?
A good idea is a good idea.
We're talking about people's lives here.
Saving people's lives.
This girl is dead because of what we're talking about here.
So, who gives a shit about the bottom line?
Well, I'll tell you who gives a shit.
The goddamn miserable sorry ass motherfuckers who won't let the hospitals use my needle.
None of us in here might even make ever a dime.
The point is, that it's... The point is Safety Point.
And I want you all to think about helping us out.
It's just a good thing to be part of and...
Thanks for being here.
Good night.
Thank you very much for coming and...
How are you doing, Mike?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Shit, Mike.
People don't bring checkbooks to these things.
I can't do this any more.
Paul, let's go home.
Hey, Sylvia.
Call ahead and tell them I need an anesthesiologist.
Put naltrexone on.
And I want the full treatment.
I want the implant under the abdomen.
Not the posterior...
Not the posterior rear.
I don't want anything in my ass that doesn't have to be.
Collapsed veins, infection of the heart lining and valves, few abscesses.
The beginning of liver disease.
Minor pulmonary complications and what could be the start of pneumonia.
Christ.
Typical.
He's going through withdrawal.
I had no idea. I mean, I...
I know he's taking some painpills for his leg, but I didn't...
He's a pretty heavy user.
I guess the good thing
I reactivated the insurance.
By the way, the treatment he requested is gonna run about 25,000, and it's not covered by insurance.
Just a heads up.
Great.
What the...
Hey.
Hey. You got my clothes?
Yeah.
Whoa. Hey, don't you want me to get someone to checkout? I'm gonna find a nurse.
That's a great idea.
We're always underestimating nurses.
I'll be right with you, Mr. Weiss.
You wouldn't happen to be a member of the nursing association, would you?
I'm standing in front the the
Houston Community National Hospital with a few hundred nurses and assorted health care workers in protest.
Joining me now is Karen Brown,
President of the Texas Nurse...
Every needle stick accident costs the hospital thousands of dollars in follow up testing.
If it's with an infected needle, it's between 500,000 and $1 million per case.
In this country there are roughly one million needle stick accidents a year.
Think about that.
You do the math.
We're fighting for the right of every citizen to live in a country that values human life over profits.
Mr. Weiss, the hospital...
Senator O'Reilly's office.
This is attorney Mike
Weiss for the Senator.
Hi, Mr. Weiss. She just ended a meeting.
Can I take a message?
Sure.
Why are these here?
They were supposed to go out yesterday.
They sent it back.
What the hell is that?
I thought we had a contract.
Tell the Senator to return my call as soon as possible.
It's regarding the San
Antonio Memorial Hospital canceling their contract with Safety Point Syringes.
The CEO of San Antonio
Memorial hospital has been invited to sit on the board of United Medical Health Supplies.
Yeah, you think she'd like to hear that in the news or return my call?
Please, have her call me back.
This is attorney Mike Weiss.
I'm about to book a flight to DC.
This is bullshit.
The Senator's chief aid called this morning.
She's tabling the issue.
Tabling the issue?
What the fuck does that mean?
I'm going down there.
United Medical Health Supplies just made a very generous contribution to the Senator's reelection campaign.
What's this?
Kim gave birth last night to a baby girl.
Six pounds, eight ounces.
Sam. She's beautiful.
Congratulations.
I'll be home with them if you need me.
What are we gonna do about the Senator?
Nicole Morris, sex therapist.
I like sex therapy.
Nice to meet you.
She creeps me the fuck out.
I should say something, right?
Probably.
You wanna be the one?
No.
Me neither.
Oh, hey, thanks for being flexible attending the case.
I'm a little behind.
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about it.
I know. I'm just gonna check a few facts and then I'll get it to you.
No, I mean, we don't need it from you any more.
Look, I didn't... I didn't wanna bring this up here but...
I'm really sorry.
My firm won't let me subcontract any more work to you guys.
Not while you're working on the Safety Point case.
Are you serious?
I'm sorry.
I mean, you can keep the retainer.
I wish there was something else I could do, but...
I understand.
Excuse me.
I'm not sure that's gonna work for us.
Well, yeah, I don't...
Okay.
Let me talk it over with my partner and my client.
I'll get back to you in an hour.
All right.
That was Price. He wants us to come out to his house tomorrow.
His house? Why?
You said that we'd settle by Christmas.
Maybe you're right.
I gotta call Dancort.
Mike!
Hand me that bag.
Mike, come on.
Just give me the fucking bag!
Gentlemen.
Thanks for coming out.
Give me a few minutes to wash up.
I'll be right with you.
Stephanie will show you the way to the library.
If you need anything, she'll be happy to get it for you, okay?
Right this way, gentlemen.
Dial nine if you need to get an outside line.
And I'll be just down the hall there to the left if there's anything else I can do for you gentlemen.
We're fine, thank you.
Great.
You got any fresh squeezed juice?
Uh, I can check.
Orange is fine.
Grapefruit is preferable.
I'll see what I can do.
Where's your bathroom?
It's right here.
How long do we have to fucking wait?
Gentlemen. It's nice, isn't it?
Fresh air.
Mm. Okay.
Let's get down to business.
First of all, thank you for coming all the way out here.
It's much appreciated.
Now, putting aside the fact that Safety Point Syringes is having financial difficulties, one of our manufacturing clients is ready to put an offer for it which I think you're gonna find satisfactory.
Where's that girl?
The girl that showed us in?
I'm not sure, Mr. Weiss.
Waiting on some juice.
I'm sure she'll bring it when she can.
Like I said, one of our manufacturing clients is interested in your company and the needle and has been for quite some time.
This generous manufacturer wouldn't happen to be Thompson Needles, would it?
They would like to remain anonymous until there's an accepted offer.
And this anonymous client would then own the patent to Safety Point?
That's right. My client is interested in purchasing the equity that comes from Safety
Point Syringes.
Would there be a contractual provision guaranteeing a certain production and distribution of the
Safety Point Syringe?
Once my client purchases
Safety Point Syringes, they'll have the right to do with it as they see fit.
And what do they see fit?
Mr. Dancort, my client is prepared to make a more than generous offer.
This is great. You know your client is in direct violation and federal and state antitrust laws.
You damn well know you won't win this case if you go to trial.
You are a brilliant engineer, Mr. Dancort.
Try applying some of that towards your business sense.
I didn't sacrifice everything because
I was looking for a big payday.
I just want my needles in those hospitals.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Dancort. I truly am.
I won't take any pleasure in seeing you ruined.
That proposal is only valid for three days.
No amendments, no negotiation.
Now, gentlemen, I have taken up enough of your Saturday.
Stephanie will see you out.
I look forward to your response.
We have to take it.
Excuse me?
The offer. We have to take the money.
What do you mean?
That offer at Dancort
Is not fair.
They made the offer 'cause they know they can't win. They're scared.
They're not scared, Mike.
They're scared we'll take it to trial.
Do you even really care if Safety Point needles end up in hospitals?
No, seriously, I-I'm asking you a question.
Do I care? Yes.
People are dying.
That's what you care about?
People dying?
Really?
We're taking the settlement.
No, we're not.
You want Dancort to walk away from millions of dollars, and then what?
What happens to him when we go to court years from now and he's lost his business and his house?
And then, then after all that we lose the case?
We won't lose the case.
Okay, fine, we don't lose.
How do you want us to survive until then, Mike?
We are broke. Broke, broke.
We have three weeks of overhead left
In the bank.
United Medical Health Supplies has pretty much paid off or pressured everyone in the United States of America from giving us any new work!
How are you gonna go and rally people behind Jeffrey in court when you don't have a phone to call them and to tell them where to show up?
I'm ending this...
I'm not ending shit.
I'll take a loan on my house.
You are so fucking delusional.
You're a big fucking pussy who'd rather chase ambulances then use the law to save peoples lives.
So you care about people's lives?
Yeah, I do.
Whose? The troop of hookers you pay to hang out with? Your wife?
Fuck you, Paul. Like you really give a shit about those pathetic scam artists.
We do neck braces and fucking crutches.
Not just the settlements they bring in, right?
You just wanna win.
That is all you've ever cared about.
At least I have the courage to lose for what's right!
I'll call Dancort and tell him you're no longer involved with the case.
I'll walk from here.
Hey, man.
How are you doing?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
I'm all set, man.
Mr. Weiss, I used to work for
Thompson Needle Manufacturers.
Then go fuck yourself.
I was a friend of Vicky's.
She asked me to come talk to you.
Thought it might be helpful.
You got a car?
Yeah. Follow me.
It's right over here.
You see, up until the 1960s.
Needle syringes were made of glass which hospitals sterilized with heat.
Thompson Needle Manufacturers refused to switch to plastic needles despite the money they'd make because plastic needles can't be sterilized.
The founder of the company, James Thompson, he was quoted to saying, "We'll switch to plastic needles over my dead body."
Sure enough. In 1966, the year he died,
Thompson Manufacturers switched to plastic needles.
Within ten years, hepatitis C and AIDS were on the map.
They knew that they'd be responsible for spreading epidemics around the world.
This tape has footage taken by a Peace
Corps worker in Nigeria.
Look.
You see those kids?
Children.
They get paid pennies to bring used needles and syringes to local pharmacies.
The clinics save on health care by reusing needles up to 200 times.
This is what's going on everywhere.
Thompson Needle Manufacturers, they're not only not acting on this, they're actually suppressing knowledge of it.
The plastic syringe is the root of the AIDS epidemic all across
Africa and Russia and India.
I'm sorry, they made an offer to buy Safety Point.
We're advising our client to take it.
Oh, come on, Mike!
You know if they buy it, they're not gonna use it!
That needle can save more than nurses here.
It can save millions of lives around the world.
Yeah, well I'm just a personal injury lawyer.
Not exactly in the best place to go around saving people's lives.
You know something, Mike?
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places.
Get it before it wakes the baby.
Hello?
Jesus Christ, Mike, you're gonna wake the baby.
I'm hanging up now, all right?
We can talk about it tomorrow.
Okay. Sorry.
Is she up?
I like people that are nuts.
Keeps things interesting.
Do you know anything about the original glass needle manufacturers?
Or anything about plastic syringes?
You know, Michael?
Everyone goes to law school to become a good guy.
To fight the good fight for justice.
Is that what you did?
Yes, I did.
How is that working out?
Do you remember the big tobacco law suits?
Of course.
Seven CEOs under oath lying in front of Congress and on camera.
And every state in the
Union suing them, right?
That's right.
You remember what happened after that?
Yeah. We shelled out a $165 billion settlement.
That's what happened.
No, nothing happened.
Cigarettes are everywhere.
You know, new teenagers start smoking every day.
Billions of people smoking worldwide.
Millions of people dying every year.
Nothing happened.
Big tobacco got a spanking.
Slap on the wrist.
And the y were right back to business as usual.
Hm. I assume you came here tonight to try convince me to do the right thing.
You know, I'd look in your eye and I'd go, "Oh, my
God, you're right!"
Then what?
Guys like me are like cafeteria trays.
Take one off the top and there's another one right underneath it.
Now I bet you spent your whole life waiting that you, you were born to do something great.
Make a difference, do something special.
Important.
But Michael.
It's the most ordinary thought anybody's ever had.
I'll see you in court.
That might be difficult since your client and partner have already accepted the offer.
You're right.
You might've settled with them, but you haven't settled with me.
I'm gonna travel the country making every hospital worker who's ever been infected by a needle stick my client.
Every mother that's lost a child, every child that's lost a parent.
I'm gonna put them on the stand, and I'm gonna tell them that your client has a needle the could've prevented it from ever happening, but he keeps it locked up 'cause it costs too much to make.
Trust me.
You're about to see just how ordinary I can be.
Good morning.
Good morning to you.
What is this?
That is a bonus for all the hard work you've been doing.
Are you serious?
I am.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Um, listen, there's along rambling message on the machine from Mike.
Figures.
There he is now.
You're up early.
Yes?
You're his partner?
Yeah.
Died in his sleep.
So, here's your partner,
Michael Weiss.
He die...
He die alone?
The detectives will be able to answer some of those questions.
They'll wanna talk to you also.
Have you seen these needles before?
That's, uh, it's a safety needle.
They were used.
That'll explain why there're so many of them.
Are you okay, Mr. Dancort?
Can we offer you something to drink?
Some tea perhaps?
No, that's all right.
Mr. Danzinger.
Sorry to hear about Mr. Weiss.
We offer our most sincere condolences.
So, since we're all here we should probably...
Hello, Nat.
It's been a long time.
You and me?
We're going to court on this one.
Looking forward to it.

Um, Dr. Dutten,
- my aunt's in town.
- Mm-hmm.
And she's sick, too.
I'm gonna need you to stay late tonight.
- Oh. You are?
- You know, you should probably text your Aunt Scotty and tell him you can't make it to the baseball game today.
Wait a second.
- Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not-
- Oh, come on, Becca.
- I mean-
- It's the worse-kept secret in town.
Now, that is saying a lot.
Go on.
Get outta here.
Go have some fun.
Thanks, Dr. Dutten.
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.
Opening day-
That's the first day of spring.
No, no, no.
The sheriff never pays for coffee.
Well, that's kind of you, Ben.
But the principal still has to pay his parking tickets.
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.
Kid throws fast.
Just like he drives.
Nice pitch, Scotty.
Come on, man! Come on, guys!
Strike two!
Whoo! Yeah!
Center field.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Hey, Tommy!
- Stay there.
- What's he doing?
- Boys, get in the dugout.
- Move it off.
- Get off!
- Bring it in. Bring it in.
Get them off the field.
Get them in the dugout, Principal.
Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Rory, we got a ballgame going on here.
We're playing ball, and you come out with a gun?
What the hell are you doing?
Aw, Ror.
You're drunk, that's all.
All right? Let's just lay the gun down.
Rory, lay the gun down.
Hmm? Lay it down.
Hell, Rory, come on.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rory?
Now, you lay that gun down.
Rory?
Oh, my God.
I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning.
A full tox screen will take about a week.
How are you holding up, David?
Peggy here yet?
She just walked in with her boy.
David, perhaps now is not the best time.
Son, settle down.
Hey, Curt.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
I liked Rory. I liked him a lot.
What was he doing out there?
He had been drinking, that's all.
Rory quit two years ago.
You know how proud he was of that.
Is that what you're saying, that he was drunk?
- Is that what you're telling people?
- No.
That you had to do it- had to shoot the town drunk.
You did the right thing.
I need a new blade for this.
Hey, David.
You did the right thing.
You should be sleeping.
Sheriff's Department.
No, ma'am, we can't comment on that.
That's an ongoing investigation.
No, ma'am, the sheriff is not here right now, but I can see if the deputy will-
Amateur.
Sheriff's Department.
Mm-hmm.
That's the medical examiner on line two.
Morning, Jim.
What have we got?
The toxicology reports are in.
The results are negative.
- Come again?
- There was no alcohol-
No, I heard what you said,
Jim, but that's not right.
- Rory was-
- David, we did the test twice.
Rory wasn't drunk.
There was no alcohol in his bloodstream.
We'll get the drug results back in a couple of days, maybe a week.
Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Do you want this car...
Bring it down here.
Ben?
Ben!
Hey.
Hey, Ben. Ben!
Ben!
Hey. You all right?
Don't worry. The, uh... kids are resilient.
They're gonna be all right.
Yeah.
I'm late. I gotta go.
- Deardra. Bill.
- Hey, Judy.
Little man.
How y'all doing?
Uh, would you mind taking a look at Bill?
- Sure. What's wrong?
- I don't know.
He's just-
He's not right.
How are you feeling, Bill?
Any pain or discomfort?
Bill?
She worries too much. I'm fine.
Just a little tired.
You got any plans this weekend?
She worries too much. I'm fine.
Just a little tired.
His vitals are fine.
But, you know, I've gotta see a patient in Cedar Rapids on Monday.
I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan.
- Monday?
- Yeah.
Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.
- Okay.
- Okay?
You need me, you call me.
Day or night.
- Okay?
- Thanks, Judy.
See you, Nicholas.
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Bill!
What's Dad doing?
Wait here, Nicholas.
William!
William?
William, what are you doing?
William?
William!
Oh, God.
Nicholas!
Nicholas?
Nicholas.
Nicholas!
- Nicholas, are you okay?
- Shh, shh.
Nicholas, what happened?
It's Dad.
Wh-Where's Dad?
What happened?
Honey, please, talk to me.
Please.
He has a knife.
Oh, my God.
Stay back.
Stay right there.
William!
William!
William!
William, please, don't do this!
William, please let us out!
Hello.
Mmm.
I'm coming.
What is it?
Number 1, take the full pressure.
All right, team.
Get me some power.
- Oh, my God.
- The garage is lit up, too.
- Deardra!
- Tom, they get out?
Not Deardra and Nicholas.
Just Bill.
- I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side.
- On it.
When we got here, there was an empty gas can just sitting out front.
And Bill- Well, he was mowing the goddamn lawn.
David, Deardra and Nicholas were upstairs locked inside a closet.
Bill! Bill!
Bill?
What the hell happened here?
- Oh, my God.
- Judy.
Oh, God.
- Judy, come on.
- No.
- What the fuck have you done?
- Judy, come on.
- Oh! Oh, David!
- Shh.
Oh, God!
Deardra!
Oh, my God!
Deardra!
What the hell?
What the hell?
What you got?
Shit!
Oh, my God.
Russ, you get in touch with Sheriff Byrnes in Cedar Rapids?
- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.
State troopers are coming this afternoon to pick him up for transfer.
How long has he been playing statue?
A couple hours now.
The same look Rory gave me.
The same goddamn look.
Shit.
Sheriff's Department.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.
Been there at least a week by the looks of things.
I'll check to see if there's any identification.
Yeah.
Do that.
Boys, last I checked, hunting season ended three months ago.
We was just out taking in a little nature.
- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.
Where's the plane?
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around saying he heard something crash out by Hautman Bog.
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?
As a general rule.
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?
Sheriff, about the reward-
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.
If you can explain the difference how those two sound,
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.
He's full of shit.
People only ask for a reward when there's something to find.
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?
Travis, you ask about that again,
I'm gonna throw you out of the fucking boat.
You're not gonna shoot me?
Travis.
Yeah?
Kill the engine.
It was a big plane, Russ.
Why is that?
'Cause we're right on top of it.
Kevin, which way does the water flow through town?
Nice to see you, too, Dave.
Waste water or drinking?
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.
A plane that size goes down- nothing in the paper, nothing in the news.
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.
Exactly what I'm thinking.
Which is what?
Hautman Bog-
What's that drain into?
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?
Black Pond. Oh, hey, you remember monster catfish-
Russell, where do you think we get our drinking water from?
Treated water comes in from the north, breaks east-west.
And what house does it get to first?
Uh, let's see.
Rory Hamill.
You wanna shut off the entire town's water supply on a hunch?
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies in the morgue in the last 48 hours.
David, take a look around you.
This is a farming community.
It is springtime.
It is planting season.
You turn off the water, you're gonna kill the crops.
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt every family in Pierce County.
And that is not based on some, uh, hunch.
That's a fact.
Water stays on.
Uh, Sheriff,
I'm all for a little civil disobedience, but, um, I think this one might cost you your job.
You know what, Russ?
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.
What the fuck?
Shh. Hang on a second.
Well, is he dead?
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.
Oh! Jesus Christ!
Did we or did we not request a transfer for him this morning?
Mm-hmm.
God damn it.
Even better.
- You know what?
- What?
We're in trouble.
Hello?
Jim?
Jim?
Jesus Christ.
Behind you.
Christ Almighty.
David, I'm not gonna do this.
I can't go to my parents.
- You have no idea-
- And neither do you.
Look, whatever it is,
I can't just leave.
- Are you gonna leave?
- I'm the sheriff.
- I'm their doctor.
- Yeah, well, if it turns out what they need is penicillin,
I'll call you.
David.
What?
What?
There's somebody outside.
David!
Get on the ground!
This is secure.
All right! Let's go, men! Move it!
Come on. Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Sheriff, what's going on?
- I don't know any more than you do.
- Keep moving, sir.
Please take the first open seat.
A funny thing happened on the way to Cedar Rapids.
Bastards spiked my tires.
Who are these fuckers, man?
Keep moving.
Everyone must exit the bus.
Keep moving, please.
Let's go, let's go!
Stay in line, sir.
Keep up with the group, please.
Please head into the tent.
- There is no need for alarm.
- Inside, please.
Forward, please.
- Please keep moving into the tent.
- Please step forward.
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.
Hey, can one of you guys tell me what's going on?
- I'm sorry. You're gonna have to keep moving.
- Sir, come with me.
- Let's go!
- No!
- Russell!
- Don't touch me!
- Coming through!
- The temperature spiked.
- Ma'am-
- What are you people doing?
Judy- Hey, don't touch me.
- Hey!
- Both of you, out!
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.
- Go ahead. This way, please.
- Judy, what does it mean?
- They're checking for elevated temperatures.
- Clear.
Farnum was bleeding from the nose.
So was Rory.
Well, cerebral hemorrhaging-
It's gotta be some kind of virus.
- You gotta wait here.
- Look, I'm a sheriff.
- She's a doctor. We know these people.
- Clear.
Would you just tell us what's going on?
Maybe we can actually help you.
- Take her in there!
- David!
Go, go, go!
David!
Get off me! Stop!
David! Wait! Wait!
Stand back! Now!
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Judy! Judy!
Wait!
David! David!
Judy!
David! David! David!
Please.
Please help me.
Please. Please.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.
We got Trayberg scrubbed and ready.
Let's go, let's go.
Please. Please.
Don't. Please. Don't.
No.
No. Please.
Please. I'm pregnant.
Please! No!
Let's go!
Franklin, open these doors!
Quickly, people.
We're getting you outta here.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Keep moving!
- Come on!
Let's go, let's go.
Extend your right arm, please, sir. Let's go.
You'll be given a card.
It looks like this.
Do not lose it.
Keep it moving.
We have an inbound vehicle coming in from the northern perimeter.
Do you have clearance ID? Over.
We have no ID.
We have gunfire!
It's a civilian vehicle!
- Behind you!
- Right there! Right there!
Keep moving.
Kevin, where's Linda?
- They took her. Judy?
- They took her, too.
They took George and Francine and Winton Simon and a whole mess of other people.
- Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Mom!
Let's go, people.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
I'm going back.
They got the whole town sealed off.
Roadblocks on every highway.
Tim Mitchell tried to run one.
They shot him dead.
His entire family.
Keep it moving.
Come up ahead.
David, this here might be your only chance.
Don't lose it running off on some fool's errand.
Judy's a fool's errand?
You know what I'm saying.
I'll tell you what, Kev.
Don't ask me why I can't leave without my wife.
I won't ask you why you can.
We got a breach in the yard!
Got a breach in the yard!
Move out! Move out!
Let's go! Evacuate!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
The crazies have breached the containment area!
- The military's pulling out!
- We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Go!
Get on board!
- We're outta here!
- Move! Move! Move!
Take 'em out!
On board! On board!
Nice to see you, too, Chief.
Oh, shit.
How'd you get out?
Tom Ellis ran his pickup through the fence.
Fucking military started shooting.
Townsfolk going nuts.
Before you know it, people are just running off into the fields.
David, Judy was still inside.
- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.
It's about time.
I'm gonna go get her.
Hoo-fucking-yah.
Let's go to the high school.
Becca? Becca!
Is that you?
Oh, God. Honey-
Honey, are you hurt?
Is this really happening?
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.
You don't really believe that, do you?
Shh.
Oh. Shh. Shh.
Please, Principal Sandborn, please stop.
Please, let me go.
Please don't do this.
No. Please don't do this.
Please. No, no. Please.
No!
Oh, shit.
What are you doing? Stop!
No. Please. Please.
- No! N-
- Just get out of here, please.
Stop. Please go. Don't.
- Don't hurt her. Please, just go away.
- Please.
Please.
Please stop. Please stop.
Stop. Leave her alone.
Stop.
Please just get out of here. Please.
No.
No!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God! Oh, David!
David! Oh, God!
Are you okay?
No, not really.
- Uh, Chief?
- We gotta get to Quik Phil's truck stop on 35.
They're putting people on buses, and they're getting them out of here.
We're gonna go. Come on.
- Did Peter call?
- Shh.
- Did Peter call?
- That's gonna be me.
Russell, we've got enough problems without you inventing them.
- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?
You're at the end of the pot mine.
I'm a half mile from the farm.
- Who's the sheriff?
- What?
Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?
- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?
- That would be me.
- You are.
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you, you're not getting sick, you understand me?
Did Peter call?
Did Peter call?
I hope you're right, Chief.
I'm not world leader, but I had plans.
Did Peter call?
Come on.
Let's go.
I'll check the truck.
Fuck.
Aw, shit!
It's booted.
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.
It's not booted.
Whoa, whoa.
Russell, get out of the truck.
Just give me a second.
Oh, Jesus.
Go. Run. Go on.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Get down, get down, get down.
Come on, boys.
Come on! Get him!
Come on! Yeah!
Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!
- Run, little man!
Run!
- Get him!
- Whoo!
- Nice shot. Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah!
Huh? Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Nice shot, huh?
Whoo!
Come on. Get him.
Hey, straight through the heart!
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah!
Shit.
- Come on.
- Huh?
Hey, he's gonna dress up real nice.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Get him up on there.
Good shot, man.
I knew I was okay about that shot.
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.
I got the old cruiser on blocks.
That piece of shit still works?
Yeah.
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.
It's seven miles to my place.
It's five if we cut through the McGregor farm.
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Let's go.
They took my blood.
Ran at least one test that I saw.
What if the reason they didn't let me go is because I have it?
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.
David, you can't know that for sure.
I can, and I do.
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.
We are gonna get through this.
What the fuck?
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.
Russell, stop her.
- Yeah, I got it.
- David-
We don't have time for this.
You had time for me.
Okay, let's go.
It looks deserted.
Scotty?
- Scotty?
- Get back!
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.
Scotty.
Scotty, put the gun down.
Put it down.
Scotty.
Sorry.
Had to be sure.
Yeah, well, that's a two-way street there, Scotty.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.
We were just getting some supplies before we started walking.
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.
- Get in the barn.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Russ.
- We have one civilian coming out.
- What are you doing?
- Ma'am, please.
- Stop! Stop!
We need you downstairs.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Wait.
- We just need to process you.
- Oh, no.
- Please!
- Okay, I got an adult male.
I just need you...
It'll just take a second, ma'am.
Too late.
Hold it right there!
Scotty!
Okay, light them up.
Okay, let's go! Split it up!
I want a complete sweep of the area!
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.
Move, move, move!
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.
Oh, fuck.
How could you do it?
How could you...
- Becca-
- You make a sound louder than this, and I'll kill you, you understand?
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.
- Who, asshole?
- Whoever gives them- I don't know.
- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?
All's they said is that there'd been some sort of accident.
My whole unit got flown in.
We didn't even know what state we was in till we seen the license plates.
Am I gonna die without my mask on?
Is that what they told you-
If you took your mask off, you were gonna die?
They just said to keep it on.
Look, um,
I know I don't deserve any favors from you people, but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.
I didn't sign up to shoot unarmed civilians.
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.
Look, my wife's a doctor.
She's pregnant.
- Becca here is not even 18.
- When he blabs, they'll find us.
If we don't let him go, they'll find us for sure.
And besides, he's not gonna blab.
No, sir.
You gotta give it to him, Russ.
Shit.
I'm sorry about your folks' town.
- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Any crazies back there, Babcock?
Babcock?
No. We're all clear.
Good. Military's pulling back to the perimeter.
Let's go. Come on.
Barn's clear!
- We're secure back there!
- All right, then.
Mount up!
We're moving out!
If what that soldier said is true, this disease has gone airborne.
We just have to keep going.
Uh, we'll go and get the car up and running.
- Come on.
- Go.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's perfect.
It's a perfect, beautiful morning, and this is our home.
This is where we were gonna raise our baby.
We can still do all those things.
Hmm?
Everyone we know... is dead.
This town is dead, and it's not coming back.
It's never coming back.
Fuck, yeah.
See if you can find a toolbox.
Okay.
This was gonna be your room.
Judy.
Look, I know this is hard, but we've gotta keep moving.
This is the gun that killed your father.
Baby.
Peggy- Peggy, no. Not Judy.
No. No, no, no.
I shot him.
I did. I shot him.
Yes.
Peggy, I shot him.
Look at me, you crazy bitch!
That's it.
I fucking shot him!
I did it!
He walked on that field with a loaded shotgun!
And I'm glad I did!
They should give me a fucking medal!
I finally killed the town drunk!
Oh!
- Oh, God.
- We're okay.
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.
Let me see your hand.
Give me the Betadine.
Yep, that's it. Here.
Shit.
Russell. Russell!
Just making sure.
He's sick, David.
You don't know that.
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.
Come on. We gotta go.
He saved our lives.
That's what I saw.
Hey, you feeling okay?
- She's fine.
- Well, I'm just saying, if she's getting sick,
- we don't wanna be in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.
I'm not sick.
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness
- messing with your mind.
- Okay. Russell, that's enough.
Don't lose your head.
What do you mean by that?
I mean, don't lose your head.
What do you mean by that, Chief?
I mean...
She's fine.
Now, just...
Fuck!
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.
Guys, it's turning around.
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!
We gotta get out of here!
- Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.
There's gotta be another road we can take.
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?
What road can they not see?
What magic road can they not see?
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.
David, I'm just trying to help.
I'm sorry.
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.
Uh...
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.
What the fuck?
David, get us outta here.
Oh, shit.
Start the car.
Come on, Chief.
Let's go. Come on.
Get us outta here.
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Let's go!
- All right!
Come on!
Come on! Let's go!
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!
I don't wanna die like this!
What the fuck was that?
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!
- Russell- Russ-
- There!
Oh, shit!
Motherfucker!
Russell!
- Oh, fuck!
- Russell!
I saw movement!
Everything is fucking moving!
Go! Come on! Come on!
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop the car!
- Stop!
- Judy!
Shit! David!
Help me here!
Help me!
Oh, God, please.
You're okay.
Becca! Becca! Becca!
Oh, no.
Becca.
No.
Becca.
That's my truck.
Fuckers spiked my tires.
Shit.
God damn it!
We need water.
I know.
Guys, car coming!
Stay here.
David, what are you doing?
We're taking this car.
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!
What are you- No!
Whoo!
Welcome to Pierce County, friendliest place on earth, asshole.
Russ, I wanna talk to him.
Okay.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm the guy standing between you and a bullet.
Now, what was on that plane?
What was on that goddamn plane?
Trixie.
Rhabdoveridae prototype.
A- A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed
- to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?
You're telling me that you guys engineered this crap?
It's designed to destabilize a population.
In this case, the wrong one.
Look, fella, we lost a plane.
What do you want me to say?
How about, "Sorry for destroying your whole goddamn town"?
- What would you have preferred, a global pandemic?
- Wait. Wait.
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.
Help who? Help us?
What- What is the incubation period?
48 hours.
After that, you're either dead or you don't have it.
Fine. It's day three, and we're still talking.
So you are gonna help us.
What the fuck!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
I said that I wanted to talk to him!
You talked.
Shit.
I'm gonna need that back.
I'll carry it for a while.
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.
I got it.
You sure?
Yeah.
Russell, we're on your side.
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.
- There's not. I'm just-
- Shut up the fuck up!
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her, too.
- Russell, no!
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.
Let him think about what he's doing.
Uh-huh.
One, two, three.
That's how many times
I've saved your life.
Go on.
Walk out where I can see you.
Move!
Fucking heavy.
Move!
- Fuck it. I'm gonna confront him.
- No, David. Don't. Please.
If we don't make it to that truck stop, we're dead anyway.
- Don't, David. Don't.
- Back off!
- I wanna talk to you.
- I will fucking shoot you where you stand.
- I just wanna talk.
- David, stop.
You better listen to me.
- David.
- Put the gun down.
- Final warning, Chief.
- Put it down.
Please? Just put it down.
I just wanna talk.
You and me, man to man.
Come on.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Here's the deal.
Fuck!
Hey.
You remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?
What'd he weigh, you reckon?
35, 40 pounds.
Shit.
It was a big son of a bitch.
I'm not right, am I?
Can I walk with you guys?
Just a little while longer?
Please?
Shit.
If you cut through there, you can make it to the highway on the other side.
- They'll see us.
- Nah, they'll be focusing on me.
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him, right?
You're the sheriff.
Come on, Chief.
I'm done.
I'm gonna die here no matter what.
So let it mean something.
Let it mean that you two made it.
Give me that.
Hoo-fucking-yah.
We got an inbound!
- Hey!
- Attention!
- You have entered a military operation.
- Hey! Hey!
Please identify yourself.
My name's Deputy Russell Crank, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.
- Keep your hands in the air and walk slowly.
- It's okay. I'm not sick.
Make no sudden movements
- or you will be fired upon.
- Oh, shit.
We are a live-fire operation.
Get out from behind the vehicle.
You are in breach of a Level 4 military operation.
Reveal yourself, or we will open fire.
- Proceed slowly with your hands in the air.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Now stop there and get down on the ground.
Stop and get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground now!
- He's down!
- Man down! Cease fire!
Fireteam Bravo, move up.
Alpha Team, stand by!
Let's go, let's go!
Approach with caution.
Movement in tight.
He's still breathing!
Secure that weapon!
Stay on him.
Fuck you for what you did.
Hey! Get an 18-Wheeler Dog only at Quik Phil's.
Football fans, show your support this off-season with our University of Iowa
Hawkeyes Snack Pack.
One jar of hot sauce and one jar of salsa in a collectible Iowa Hawkeyes helmet.

It was Grand Central last night.
Nothing satisfies hunger better than a Quik Phil's Mega-burger.
Take it to go or eat it here
- in one of our panoramic dining areas.
- Wait here.
Hello?
Judy?
Judy! Judy!
Judy, you all right?
Ohh.
They exterminated everyone, not just the sick.
- Look, there's a rig we can take.
- What's the point?
- If we get out of here, they're gonna kill us, too.
- No.
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- David, can you just stop it?
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- Can you stop pretending everything is gonna be okay?
All right.
For Christ sakes.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You wanna give up?
You wanna sit here and die?
Tell me, and I will sit here and die with you.
You gonna go get that truck?
Blackbird 2, this is T.O.C.
We are approaching T minus ten minutes.
Confirm status.
This is Blackbird 2...
All units, this is T.O.C.
Be advised we are at ready status.
Proceed to countdown.
Countdown procedure initiated.
We are at T minus ten minutes.
All right. Blackbird 2 is in the air-
Truck!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Honey, it's fine.
It's okay.
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
David, honey, how's it going there?
We're gonna get there.
Oh, shit. Baby, come on.
Come on. Come on.
David.
God damn it!
David, come on.
- Hurry up.
- God damn it.
I'm sorry. It's okay.
They've gotta be in here somewhere,
David. Come on.
- Just keep looking.
- Oh, fuck me. Just-
Jesus, David.
What are you doing?
Come on, baby. Come on.
David!
David! Quick! Come on!
David!
Let's get the fuck out of here, huh?
The smallest, straightest road to Cedar Rapids.
Yeah. Perfect.

Huh?
Yeah.
Ow.
Oh. Sorry, honey.

We want to update you on late-breaking news.
A massive fire in Ogden Marsh continues to rage, and high winds are preventing fire teams from containing the deadly blaze.
Now, information is still coming in, but what we currently know:
An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol chemical plant early this morning, with eyewitness reports of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky.
We also have reports of a second explosion at a nearby truck fueling station.
A perimeter has been set in an effort to contain the blaze, and civilians are not being permitted into that area.
Those who've finished drinking, return your...
...empty cartons to the correct number and sit back down.
Our school has been selected from ten thousand candidates...
...all across the country to promote milk for middle schoolers.
You're currently approaching your second growth period.
The calcium in milk not only strengthens your bones, but also nurtures your brains.
These are porn movies I confiscated from Kamiyama last month.
He digitally removed the mosaic on them at Watanabe's house, and planned on giving them to all the boys in the class.
I'm sure you know that your bodies and hearts are about to...
...go through an immense period of growth known as puberty.
I don't know how effective milk will be on thirteen year old bodies and minds.
But I'm sure we'll see some changes in you come the March health checkups.
Though I'll be gone by then.
I've had enough, so this will be my last month as a teacher.
You gotta be kidding!
Awesome!
(25th March
End of term ceremony for Year One Class B)
I don't really know whether I've been a good teacher.
Stop messing around! The teacher's trying to say something!
Thank you, Hoshino.
Do any of you know a teacher called Masayoshi Sakuramiya?
Yeah!
He's the super-teacher that wrote this book, right?
He's totally awesome.
He's a truly passionate teacher who has published books, and has appeared on television.
Originally he was a total deadbeat, right? He dropped out...
...of school and travelled the world before becoming a teacher.
That's right.
Last year he was told he only had a few months left to live.
Yet he wasn't discouraged, and continued to put his...
...all into his classes until the very last.
He taught at...
...the first school I ever worked at.
Seriously!?
!?The weak will always hurt those weaker than them.
Are the only choices available to bear it or die?
No, the world you live in is not so limited.
If you're stuck in a difficult situation, it's okay to retreat to somewhere safer.!?
Retreat, huh?
Guess we better had then!
I'm outta here!
Already taking Mr. Sakuramiya's words to heart.
Truly, the man is a genius.
Well, I suppose it hardly matters.
Compared to Mr. Sakuramiya,
I might never have been much of a teacher.
But there were two rules I chose to work by.
One: Address the students politely.
Two: Do my best to place myself on the same level as them.
Speak with them as I'd like to be spoken to.
Be frank with them as if we were friends, talking to them about anything they wanted.
I think I must have been quietly influenced...
...by drama characters who spoke in such ways.
I'm sorry, Nagaguchi.
Even though you sent me late night e-mails, telling me you wanted to lose weight, or that you wanted to die,
I could never answer you kindly.
Because frankly I never completely trusted what any of you told me.
Hey, what's that supposed to mean!?
I remember a certain event.
A girl wrote to a young male teacher saying she was in love with him.
I remember this!
That she'd kill herself if he didn't meet her. He panicked and agreed to meet her at a love hotel.
The girl waited there, and got a photo of him.
Then she showed it to her parents, who stormed into the school.
Ridiculous...
It was just a stupid prank by a girl who was angry for being scolded.
The teacher was a fool to trust her.
So you don't believe us about anything!?
It's just because students...because all of you...are so good at lying.
Miss, I'm feeling ill. Can I go to the nurse?
Go ahead.
Anyway, after that, if I was called out by a student of the opposite gender, even one of my own, I'd get a male teacher from...
...another class to go instead.
Just as whenever one of the boys in this class...
...asked to meet me, I'd send Mr. Tokura from Class A.
I feel that's deeply irresponsible as our teacher.
Oh you do, do you?
I see. I suppose you can look at it that way.
Spending your every moment thinking about marrying a Johnny's Jr. you can become quite self-absorbed, and completely wrapped up in your own little worlds.
It's easy to forget what it means simply to live.
I'm going to make sure none of you ever use words like 'I want to die' so lightly again.
I'm going to give you one final, very important lesson.
As you know, I'm a single mother.
I had intended to marry the father of my daughter Manami.
We were both teachers, but he was someone I really looked up to.
Shortly before we were due to be married, I became pregnant.
And he was diagnosed with HIV during a physical examination.
HIV. A virus which destroys the immune system.
The virus which causes AIDS.
He contracted it as a relief worker abroad.
It's okay, you can breathe.
It doesn't pass through the air.
It also won't pass through handshakes, sneezes, baths, or swimming pools.
Even if you're close to someone infected regularly, it doesn't pose problems.
So I'm not even infected to begin with.
HIV isn't guaranteed to pass via sex.
Though I myself couldn't believe I wasn't infected, and demanded a reevaluation.
In the end, I gave birth to my child, but didn't marry.
That was the decision I took.
Why didn't you marry him?
Even though the child wasn't infected, her father was. And if that became... public knowledge, she'd face discrimination.
Who cares what people think!
The specter of his illness would hang over her even after he had passed.
It would only make her suffer. That was his judgement, and I agreed.
That's so cruel on the kid!
It would've been crueler to do otherwise.
Even though he wanted to hold Manami more than anyone, he couldn't...
As hard as it was for me, I think it was a hundred times harder for him.
I gave Manami every bit of love I had.
When she turned one, I went back to work.
Until she was six, she'd wait for me at the local nursery.
And after that, I entrusted her to a Ms. Takenaka I met via a volunteer center.
She took care of a dog called Shaggy.
Manami really loved that dog, so she put her in charge of feeding it.
At the start of this year, Takenaka was hospitalised.
Every day I finished work by the time she finished nursery.
Except on Wednesdays, when there were staff meetings.
Then I'd go and meet her early, and have her... wait until the meeting was over in the school infirmary.
Manami really loved a character called Cotton Bunny.
Her bag, her handkerchief, her tissues, her shoes...
Hey, Shimomura, you remember this pouch, right?
Buy it for me Mommy!
I already bought this one for you.
Why don't you just buy her it? It's only a pouch.
Thinking about it now, you were probably right.
Because in the end...
Manami?
Manami! Manami!
...it was the last thing Manami ever asked me to do for her.
Miss!
On the 13th of February...
Miss!
...the police determined that she had slipped into the pool, and drowned.
There were bread crumbs beside Shaggy, and it was the same bread Manami was given at the nursery.
Manami had secretly been walking past the pool every week.
To give Shaggy food.
She's crying!
Aww, baby wants to cry!
Manami is gone.
I'll never touch her small hands again.
My hands will never again be able to feel her tiny cheeks...
Her soft hair...
Manami's death...
...was probably my fault. I failed as her guardian.
But...
I wasn't going to let it end like that.
Manami died.
But it was no accident.
She was killed by students from this class.
What is it that protects you?
Your parents? Weapons?
No, your strongest ally is...
Juvenile law.
Under Article 41 of the penal code, those under fourteen years of age... are not liable for their crimes.
And cannot be punished for them. Isn't that lovely?
There was a thirteen year old girl just the same as you.
She mixed all sorts of drugs into her family's food, calling it a holy rite, and recorded the results... in detail on an internet blog.
The Lunacy Incident?
That's right. The Lunacy Incident.
That was the name she used on her blog, so the press gave it that name and turned it into a big scare story.
In the end, they never found a reason for...
...her to brutally murder her whole family.
But because of that, all sorts of foolish rumours began to spring up...
...and she even won admirers among people her age.
The only one who received a harsh punishment...
...was the teacher who told her specific details about various medicines.
All she had to do was write a few remorseful words in a...
...juvenile detention center and she was pronounced rehabilitated.
Even if you kill someone, you're not going to be punished for it.
And there's no way for us to stop these crimes...
For us to stop child murderers.
If you felt like it, you could kill someone with a baseball bat...
...or a nice long kitchen knife...
...or a medicine ball from P.E...
...or even with your bare hands!
And there'd be nobody to stop you.
That hurts...
I'm sorry.
Hurry up, hurry up!
Guess even you wanted to find out who the culprits are, huh?
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I have no intention of telling you their names.
The hell!? That's not fair!
Masami's father was Masayoshi Sakuramiya.
The reason that we had a special sort of funeral at our house...
...was because he wanted to finally hold Manami before she was gone.
The first time Manami was held by her father...
...her soul had already departed.
He confessed to me that his condition had worsened into AIDS.
But in the few months of life he had left...
...I couldn't bring myself to say anything to him.
I believe that along with Manami, something important inside me died too.
Last week, I went to visit Ms. Takenaka, who had retired.
She gave me a box of Manami's things I had left with her.
And this was in the box.
The pouch I had never bought her,
Where did it come from?
Ms. Takenaka said she found it near Shaggy's kennel.
Shaggy...
The students sometimes drop their things here...
...while they play catch and clean the pool...
I remember it dawning on me that the only punishments children...
...ever have to deal with are a few extra laps, or having to clean the pool...
Don't be stupid! It's not me.
Was Minami really alone at the pool that day?
There are two students responsible.
I'll refer to them as 'A' and 'B'.
'A' is a straight As student. Looking at him, you wouldn't expect him to have any problems at all.
But...there are some fairly unsettling rumours you hear from time to time...
Since he was in junior school, he's been picking up stray cats and dogs...
...and taking them home to kill with his Execution Machine.
Execution Machine?
Some sort of weird tool he made himself.
He puts photos of the animals he kills with it on his site.
I checked out A by calling his junior school teacher, but was told there had been no problems with him at all.
Just as I was about to give up on him...
So what do you teach, Miss?
...'A' came to my office.
Science.
Lights and stuff?
If you want to know about that, shouldn't you just ask your dad?
There's something good inside. Try opening it!
Awesome, huh?
So I'm a test subject, huh?
Are you going to use this to torture animals?
No point in that.
Pop...
What?
Can't you hear that, Miss?
It's the sound of something important to you disappearing...
Mugger Shocking Surprise Wallet.
Protects your important valuables from muggers.
It wasn't an Execution Machine?
Whatever. Just stamp here.
One report that stressed how safe it was with its new safety switch...
...and one full of perfectly played junior school sincerity...
They only made him seem more frightening.
'A service to humanity', huh?
There's no need to read every damn word.
Just tell me which one is better!
I consulted the Principal on the matter, but...
...he did little more than echo my concerns.
And in the end, the Anti-Theft Surprise Wallet won first place at the contest.
I asked 'A' about the truth behind Manami's death.
Just messin' with ya.
'A' told me the truth with a smile.
He hardly seemed to care that the woman before him...
...was the mother of the girl he killed.
'A''s motive...
Was pure naivety.
A desire to have the world notice him.
To be recognised as more talented than any of his peers.
But on the day that he got his wish and was published in the newspaper.
The world turned their eyes from him...
...to a certain girl of the same age.
Even if you're recognised for doing good stuff, nobody gives a shit.
They all just care about that Lunacy freak.
An overdose? Hah!
If I wanted to kill someone, I could make everything myself. Just like this.
I want to kill this little brat.
That was the only thought that ran through my head.
'B' had transferred to our school, and joined the P.E club, but...
...it was all just athletics...
...and they wouldn't even let him hold a racket.
He was fed up, but he didn't have the nerve to talk to the teacher.
So he got his mum to call in, quit the club...
...and began attending a cram school.
But his grades didn't get any better.
And though he worried, he was too lazy to do anything about it.
He holed up in the police station.
He got a shock when the person who came to meet him...
...wasn't me, but Mr. Tokura.
Why didn't Miss Moriguchi come?
What're you babbling about, idiot.
For violating the rule against juniors going to the arcade,
'B' was given a punishment.
He was to clean the school rooms and the poolside once a week.
I heard this from 'B' himself, at his home.
His mother sat beside him.
And everytime he said something, her only response was...
It's not fair.
She kept saying it.
But she wasn't talking about my dead daughter. She was talking about her son.
At the start of February, 'A' made contact with 'B'.
To recruit him to aid in a terrible plan.
Who would be good?
For what?
Woah, is that the thing that won the contest?
I juiced it up a bit, so I want to test it on someone.
It doesn't really matter who. Though I did make it to zap bad guys.
Then I guess we'd better find some creep to test it on too.
'B''s first suggestion was Mr. Tokura.
'A' didn't respond.
So then 'B' put forward my name.
I hate that bitch.
One of her students is in trouble, and she sends another teacher to do her dirty work.
But I've already tested it on her.
'A' wasn't interested in that idea either.
Then how about her daughter?
We'd be punishing a teacher for caring more about her daughter than her students.
'B' talked about how Manami came by the pool to feed the dog...
...and how he saw her clamouring for the pouch...
...and it not being bought for her.
The target they chose...
...was my daughter.
My young, defenseless daughter.
Your mommy wouldn't buy this for you, right?
Or has she given you one already?
Right. She asked us to go and buy it for you.
Mommy said that?
Here you go. A Valentine's Day present from your lovely mommy.
Try opening it.
There's chocolate inside.
What the hell? T...this is bad!
She's dead.
I killed her 'cause she was a little brat that wouldn't shut up.
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.
I told him that and headed home.
But then that moron had to go and...
If it came out that the pouch had killed her...
I thought I'd be guilty, so...
I thought if I made it look like she fell in the pool...
I wouldn't be found out.
That was the truth behind Manami's death.
As the two of them said...
...the police determined that it was an accident.
I have no intention of fighting that judgement.
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.
I took a look at it...
...and even taking into account that she was only four...
...it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.
Want to give it a try?
Manami had just fallen unconscious.
There's no doubt in my mind that the true cause of her death...
...was her drowning after 'B' threw her into the pool.
It's quite ironic.
'A' had the guts to kill someone, but failed to do so.
And 'B' didn't want to hurt anyone, but ended up killing Manami.
Even if I brought forth this evidence to the police, the two would...
..be protected by juvenile law, and would suffer nothing more than being put into care.
Essentially, they'd be viewed as innocent.
I've decided that that's simply not enough.
It's a teacher's duty to reprimand her students when they've done wrong.
I intend to make the two of them realise the severity of their crimes...
...and come to appreciate the importance of life.
I want them to live, each day... bearing the weight of their crimes.
I mixed a little something...
...into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.
Shit!
Calm down!
You were good enough to drink it all up, too.
Thank you.
I hope you look forward to the three month wait on blood tests.
If the results come back positive, the incubation period is five to ten years.
Time enough, I think, to repent for your sins, and to realise the value of life.
Spring is a season when everything bursts into life.
The flowers, the trees, the grass, the birds, and even people...
I wish you all a wonderful Spring holiday!
That's all I have to say.
Miss Moriguchi...
...you wouldn't believe your eyes.
Seeing the sunny smiles on the faces of our class...
...now that you've gone, and the new term is rolling in.
(6th April
Start of term ceremony for Year Two Class B)
April didn't bring any changes to our class, but it did bring a new face during homeroom.
Werther.
That's what people have been calling me since my school days.
But it's 'Werther', not 'worrier'. You can count on me.
The awful jokes kept coming.
Yukari.
Maki?
Ayaka? And...Naoki?
Oh, that's right, he caught a cold.
Everyone knew Nao wasn't absent because of some stupid cold.
What surprised us more was that Shuuya...
...continued coming to school.
I wasn't exactly what you'd call a serious student in school.
But then I read a book that changed my life.
That had to be...
...the worst joke of all.
"While wandering the world, I read the Bible.
And in it I discovered the true shape of education.
'What man among you...
...who has 100 sheep and loses one of them...
...does not leave the 99 in the open field...
...and go after the lost one until he finds it?'"
Teach, you're awesome!
I want to show you all how passionately I believe in these words!
I think...everyone was just cowardly...
You can count on me whenever you need me!
They wanted to hide from the horrible truth Ms. Moriguchi had shown us.
I'll support you with all my might!
So they pretended to be stupid.
I want to be like a big brother to you all!
Miyu?
Natsuki?
Tsukekun?
Misebon?
I'm sorry.
I've been lying to you.
I told you Naoki couldn't come to class because of colds or illnesses.
But he's not just been skipping.
He wants to come to class, but he's very sick mentally.
Werther was the only one in the class...
...who didn't know why he was like that to begin with.
The mail was sent to everyone in the class just after...
...the closing ceremony that day. Nobody knew who sent it.
How about it, everyone?
Want to help me make it easier for him to come back?
For example, maybe we could make lots of leaflets, and...
...Class Representative Mizuki and I could take one to his house each week.
No good? What do you think, Mizuki?
Sounds okay.
Stand up! Thanks.
Do you have a nickname too, Mizuki?
Mozuki.
People used to call me it in junior school.
Mozuki!
Mizuki the moron. Mozuki.
Mozuki, huh?
Right, I'll call you that from now on.
What a cute nickname!
Mozuki!
Is Naoki here?
Yes.
If a teacher as passionate as you had been his homeroom teacher,
Nao might never have ended up like this.
The last teacher was a single mother, right?
Imagine, bringing your child to work in the first place.
Nao's mother danced around the subject of the incident...
...itself, and just kept blaming Miss Moriguchi.
I can't help but feel like she was so focused on her daughter...
...that she lost sight of the needs of her students.
So Naoki is...
Naoki is the sort of boy...
...who can do anything if he tries.
Please let me help with Naoki.
Thank you.
Nao!
Nao!
I told you to stay the hell away from me!
Nao!
It's all that bitch's fault.
That dear little Nao ended up like this...
Pee.
He wouldn't let me touch anything he had touched...
...and insisted on washing every inch of it himself.
Yet for some reason he wouldn't wash his hair, and refused to take a bath.
That bitch...
Why Manami?
Why did Manami have to die?
What are you babbling about?
She made it sound like it was all Nao's fault.
Even though he was just led astray by bad friends.
It's not fair.
Nao...
Stay the hell away!
The hell aren't you workin'?
Nobody knew who it was...
...who sent around the mails.
Who'll write some words to cheer up Naoki?
Fill your heart with joy!
The road ahead is still long!
Kill off all your doubts!
You live you learn!
How is Naoki?
Can I talk to him for just a few moments?
Sir...
Just call me Werther.
Doing this stuff isn't going to make Nao come to school.
It might actually have the oppos...
Mozuki, relax.
This is just a little adolescent angst. If he gets through it, he'll see the light.
It's never over 'til you die!
Let's go for it!
Why...?
Why is it that Nao can be peaceful, but...
...everytime that guy comes here...
...he's terrified...
That stupid teacher.
Spouting that optimistic rubbish.
He's useless.
I slipped sleeping pills into his food.
My husband was away on work.
And my eldest daughter was busy with her studies in Tokyo.
There was nobody in the house but the two of us.
Nobody to protect him but me.
Mom...
Nao...
Who's this?
The heck's he smiling for?
June.
There are bullies in this class.
And the one being bullied is Shuuya Watanabe.
This note was in among the homework I took in yesterday.
It took courage to write this.
I'm not just gonna ignore that.
I think the bullies are just jealous.
Because Shuuya's the smartest kid in the year.
Don't think you can just walk all over him...
...just because he's smarter than you!
He couldn't have been more wrong.
Shuuya's intellect is one of his unique qualities!
You all possess unique, individual abilities too!
The ability to bully those weaker than you.
The ability to forget things you don't want to face.
I want to see you all continue to polish those abilities.
Because I'm always watching over you.
Hey, it was you who grassed us up, right?
No! It wasn't me!
The class blamed me.
Because I was the only one whose punishment points sat at...
Mizuki 0 Points
Allying yourself with a murderer...
Don't you have any shame, Mozuki?
Don't you feel sorry for Miss Moriguchi?
Don't!
Lemme go!
Kiss!
Miss... Our class is finished.
Naoki's crying.
He's probably thinking about the accident.
And crying...
...for the girl who died.
It's clear to me.
I know he hasn't changed a bit.
That same old gentleness...
He's still Naoki.
Fill...the...kill...lear... Filthy killer.
Just wanted to let you know.
It's fine. I already knew.
Hey! Wanna go drink some juice?
So you already knew?
<b>Subtitle by
Aldi Arman</b>
Yeah. Had to be a lie.
Mixing HIV-infected blood into milk.
Couldn't believe everyone bought it.
How come?
Well...
If someone was really trying to kill someone, or get revenge...
...they wouldn't feed us all that shit about the importance of life.
You think?
She didn't have the guts.
No matter how much she hated you.
She just said that stuff to give you a wake up call.
I could tell.
You're not afraid of me?
Even though I'm Boy 'A'?
Why'd you bother telling me the results?
Because even though my life isn't very important...
...yours is.
You've been sending weird mails around and setting everyone on me...
Right, Hoshino?
If you keep fucking with me...
...then I'm gonna put these lips all over you.
Just kidding.
I'll pay for it. All of it.
You shouldn't eat it. You'll get AIDS.
During the closing ceremony...
The milk I drank had Miss Moriguchi's...
What Nao told me...it was too terrible.
Moriguchi is a demon.
Nao! We're going to the hospital.
Forget it.
What're you saying!? If you died, I'd...
I'm a murderer.
You are not!
You were just trying to protect your friend, so you took the body, and...
It wasn't a body. She was still breathing.
That's why I threw her in the pool.
S...so she was alive, and...
And you just didn't realise! That's right.
Not really.
She opened her eyes right in front of me.
So I just...
July.
Nobody dared to bully Shuuya anymore.
Don't look! I'm writing a letter!
Huh? To who?
I'm not going to send it or anything.
But it's just...full of my feelings.
Cool.
This is awesome, Shuuya!
All I wanted...
All I wanted was for someone to recognise me.
I don't have a mother, and I've been alone all this time.
I told Shuuya...
...a secret I had kept from everyone else.
That Lunacy girl...is my other side.
I let him see the real me, that I hid from everyone else.
Hey...
Is there anyone you really want to get rid of?
Go home!
Nao, are you there!?
Nothing's going to be solved by holing yourself up in your room!
Don't think you're facing this alone!
I'll help you!
I'll listen to anything you have to say!
Believe in me, Naoki!
You've got to come to the end of year ceremony tomorrow!
Everyone's waiting for you!
Mozuki... Thanks for always coming with me.
Naoki...isn't Naoki anymore.
The gentle Nao that I loved...is gone.
Yoshihiko...Mariko... Goodbye.
Forgive me. I'm going to take Nao with me t...
Nao...
The next day, the end of term ceremony was postponed.
And in the afternoon, a staff meeting was called.
Because Nao...
...killed his mother.
I'm sure it's a shock to you that Nao did a thing like this, but...
The police are wanting to make inquiries.
Mozuki.
You just need to tell the teachers and the police whatever comes to mind.
I know.
Miss... Miss Moriguchi.
I want to ask you once more.
Is life a heavy burden to bear?
No matter whose life it is?
I've collected a range of different medicines.
I planned to use them to commit suicide.
But it's just as easy to take them...
...and mix them into Werther's tea.
Life isn't worth a thing.
I'm sure that's what you thought when you did what you did to Shuuya and Nao.
Though I'm not sure you did anything at all...
I'm actually a little bit afraid.
Though part of me doesn't care...
...whether a creep like Werther lives or dies.
I said whatever came to mind.
That everything Nao did... That him becoming the way he did...
Was all Werther's fault.
Nobody taught me that killing people was wrong.
Where other kids got read picture books and fairy tales, my Mum taught me Ohm's law, and Norton's theorum. She only ever talked about electronics.
She'd break cute toys to pieces, and show me how they worked.
Mom dreamed of becoming a promising researcher in electrical engineering.
She married the most unspectacular person you could imagine...
...and gave birth to me.
In order to raise me,
Mom threw away her career as a researcher, and cast aside a shining future.
You're going to be a genius.
Because you've got my blood in your veins.
But she soon came to regret that decision.
And to hate me for it.
Why don't you get it? Why can't you even do something like this!?
If only you weren't here.
If only I wasn't here.
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
What're you doing?
My dad couldn't stand the way she treated me, and divorced her.
And Mom decided to go back to her dream of being a researcher.
Of course, that meant leaving me behind.
The only things she left me were...
These are all wonderful books that have had a big impact on me.
I'm sure they'll be useful to you further down the line.
...a pile of books, and a few words.
You've got the same blood as me.
The same talent flows in your veins.
See you around.
As she left, I heard...
...the sound of something important to me disappearing.
Pop...
Everyone will die.
Want a drink too?
Including me.
My entire world will...
31st August.
I planted a bomb in the school.
The detonator is tied to the dial button on my phone.
A piece I wrote on the topic of 'Life' during my first term...
...won a prefectural competition.
And come tomorrow's start of term ceremony.
I'll be standing in front of every student in the school reading it.
Realise the importance of life!
I'll never forget the words of Miss Moriguchi, who told me that.
They were words of truth, from a woman...
...who had lost her darling daughter.
When I've finished my speech, I'll trigger the detonator.
And I'll be blown to pieces, along with all the idiots sitting in front of me.
The media will be all over it, of course.
But it'd be bothersome for them to misrepresent me, or fill in the blanks in my story themselves.
So I'm leaving my last will and testament...on this website.
The year after he divorced my mom, Dad got remarried.
In perfect accordance with natural law...
...it was a union of two morons...
...so their child was just as stupid.
Your dad and I have been thinking...
...that maybe we could turn the storehouse into a study room for you.
The baby will be crying everyday, and... it would be good for you not to be disturbed.
I read the books Mom left me every day.
I could feel her blood burning in my veins.
I wanted to use the talents she had left me.
The morons were happier to keep... me out of sight. So I shut myself away like... some sort of monster.
What's this?
A backwards clock.
Idiots who only met up to uncensor porn movies...
...couldn't hope to understand my genius.
First I set up a website.
Then I visited the page of my mom's prestigious university, and sent them the address.
I thought maybe Mom might see it.
But...
It pissed me off that whenever I posted stupid junk...
Yoshikazu Seguchi.
I was shocked to find his name among the judges.
A professor who had inspired Mom. Who she had looked up to more than anyone.
I wanted to show him my inventions.
It was the perfect stage to demonstrate the talents Mom had left me.
If my inventions were just recognised on a big stage...
...then surely my mom would hear word of it too.
I tested my invention on our homeroom teacher...
...with pleasing results.
And as expected, took first prize. But...
A student of a city public school is being held under suspicion...
...of murdering four members of her family.
...the world didn't even blink an eye.
Nobody noticed. Not even Mom.
I had to do something bigger. Something the media couldn't ignore.
A murder.
A murder using the very gifts that...
...my mom had left me.
I didn't care who I killed.
But I needed a helper.
Someone too stupid to notice what I was thinking.
Someone who would do as they were told.
Who would spread the word of my murder like wildfire.
An idiot among idiots.
I found him.
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.
Don't worry about me trying to drag you into it.
I never thought of you as a friend anyway.
You're pathetic, untalented...
...and utterly worthless.
All I did was tell someone stupid that they were stupid.
So why'd he go and...
...mess everything up?
I wanted to be friends...
With you...
I didn't have any friends.
Wanna watch a video together or something?
I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.
Nobody who paid me any attention at all...
You seem different to all those other idiots.
Sort of easy-going. Like a grown up.
Nobody had ever acknowledged me before.
So I chose a target like you asked.
How about Moriguchi's daughter?
Why Manami?
Why did Manami have to die?
I wonder...
I don't even remember anymore.
I just did what I was told.
I scouted around the pool.
But you...
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.
He...
He just wanted to kill someone.
But he failed.
She was alive.
She was still breathing.
...and utterly worthless.
I'm worthless?
He wanted to kill someone and screwed up!
He's the worthless one!
Tough luck!
Looks like I'll do what he never did!
Why the hell did you do that!?
If you wanna spread rumours, do it yourself.
Pop.
A month passed, and finally the dumb teacher put two and two together.
I'm not going to debate the police's conclusion.
God damn it...
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.
Even taking into account that she was only four, it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.
This is fucking ridiculous...
I mixed a little something into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.
Moriguchi, you're the best.
A life-threatening illness is just what I need!
My stupid dad'll have to let Mom know about this!
She'll definitely agree to meet me!
She'll meet me, even if it's difficult for her.
I'll meet Mom...
She'll look out for me...
And I'll show her just what she taught me!
Pop.
Everything after that was just a way of burning time.
My smiles...
My tears...
This and that...
All of it.
Even living...
They were all just boring ways to pass the time.
How did he...? That talentless...
Worthless...
It's all Moriguchi's fault.
She wanted me dead, and even sent spies here.
But Mom just kept bad mouthing her.
That's why she's dead.
Even though I worked so hard to not infect her...
To keep everything clean...
I'm gonna die too!
Yet...I'm still alive.
I don't think it's fully dawned on me yet.
I stink...
But this is proof that I'm alive.
My teeth... My hair... My nails... This smell...
And the fact that I'm still hungry.
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!
I'm going to die... I'm only thirteen...
Moriguchi's going to kill me!
I still haven't kissed anyone...or had sex...
Why?
Because you're worthless.
I am not! I'm...
You're a good boy, Nao.
That's right, huh Mom?
Exercise, study...
Killing people.
You can do anything if you put your mind to it.
I'm sorry, Nao.
Why?
Because you're worthless.
Shut up!
I'm sorry. It's my fault. I didn't raise you right...
Worthless.
The boy's actions and state of mind are yet... to be disclosed, but...
According to his lawyer, he accepted the verdict calmly.
Even though he loved his mom, he...
Just like you.
Nothing.
What's just like me?
You're scaring me, Shuuya.
What the hell do you know about me?
I know everything.
You were just...a way to pass the time.
Piss off.
Thinking you're so hot because you're Lunacy.
Playing at being a psychopath.
And gathering up this shit.
Lunacy is your other side? The fuck is that supposed to mean?
Entertaining yourself with stupid daydreams.
I'm not buying it.
Shuuya.
You have the guts to kill anyone, right?
Then drink this shit yourself and die.
Oedipus complex.
You're nothing more...
Than a little baby who's spent his whole life crying for a mother who left him.
You don't even have the guts to just go and see her.
You're scared, right? That if you go see her, she'll push you away.
You don't want to think that she didn't wa...
Miss Moriguchi...
That day, I came across you by chance...
And I...
There was no blood in the milk, was there?
There's no way you'd...
...have the guts to do something like that.
I've been thinking that this whole time.
I don't even really know anymore.
I don't care if that Werther creep dies.
It seems Mr. Terada will be taking some time away from work.
Because Naoki ended up...
It was all Werther's fa...!
I'm responsible.
I've been meeting with Mr. Terada every now and then.
He's very serious about his job...and very na?ve...
A textbook Sakuramiya fan.
So I decided to tell him that Manami's deceased father...
...was none other than Sakuramiya himself.
I strung him along, and used him...
...to make them suffer.
Of course I didn't tell him why Manami died, but...
He was good enough to take my advice to heart.
To make home visits to Naoki.
To not be discouraged, even if he wasn't greeted warmly.
To be sure to go at least once a week.
To call out to him, even if the door was shut in his face.
I told him that...
...Sakuramiya would have done the same.
As for Shuuya being bullied...
...I suggested fabricating a message from someone in the class.
I told him the students would find it easier that way.
I told him precisely because...
...I knew it would only make things worse.
I was so disappointed to hear he wasn't being bullied anymore.
I thought it best to surround him with hostile classmates...
...until either he killed himself, or one of them did it for him.
I guess you're a nicer bunch than I thought.
Miss...
Here you go.
Thank you.
If you mix that blood into their milk, you'll only be repaying hatred with hatred.
And your mind will never be at ease.
They're sure to see the error of their ways one day.
Let's believe in them.
For in their redemption lies your recovery.
That's what Sakuramiya told me.
He always knew just what to say.
But...
I told them I did it anyway.
Even had I done it, the chance of them being infected was almost zero.
And even if they somehow were infected,
AIDS is no longer the death sentence it used to be.
Its progress can be slowed through modern medicine.
If only we had found Sakuramiya's cancer sooner...
...maybe he might have survived that too.
But they didn't know any of that.
And just hearing 'HIV' sent them into a panic.
A sea of confused, foolish faces.
Miss...
I lost my family.
Please don't hurt Shuuya...
I won't forgive him.
What about if I died? Would you care?
Of course.
He's just lonely.
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.
He just wants to be acknowledged by the mother who threw him away.
And...
Miss... Is life...
It's light as can be.
Ridiculous...
Her body was still warm. It creeped me out.
So I stuck her in the fridge.
I only killed another kid my age.
So juvenile law is on my side.
Nobody's going to punish me for it.
How dull...
When I started making it, I actually had no idea what to use it for.
Three days ago.
Assistant Professor Yasaka.
It was from my mother!
She wanted to meet me.
Before I knew it, I was walking to the university.
The third research lab of the electrical engineering department.
The door swung open, and there she was. I wondered if she'd burst into tears and embrace me if I called out to her. But I decided against it.
What I wanted her to embrace wasn't my body, but something bigger.
I wanted her to acknowledge my talent.
To see the legacy I left to the world.
I left the university.
To fulfill my destiny.
I decided where to use my bomb.
A massacre is about to unfold.
And this time my audience won't just be one idiot like Shimomura, but everyone who visits this site.
I pray that news of my death, and of the...
...bloody page I am about to write into history...
...will find her. That my feelings will reach her.
I want...my mother to know what I've done.
!?There are men in existence who can, or more accurately, who have...
...an absolute right to commit all kinds of wicked and criminal acts. For them...!?
For me...
!?...to a certain extent, laws do not exist.!?
This is the justification cited by the protagonist of Crime and Punishment,
Raskolnikoff, after he murders his wife.
But I believe...
That life is... That every life is important.
That every life is beautiful.
There isn't a single life in this world that can simply be cast away!
Just kidding...
Shuu, this is your mommy.
I'm so sorry for leaving you alone this whole time.
Who the hell is this?
It's been a while...It's Moriguchi.
I picked up the little present you left in the gymnasium.
It was the feeble work of a feeble mind.
I had no problem disarming it.
Though you helped me out blabbing all about it on that website of...
Shut up!
Not while I still have so much to say.
I thought about how to take revenge on you...
And even if I killed you, you don't seem to especially value... your own life.
I've been checking your site this whole... time, wondering if there's no better way to punish you.
I saw that delightful little love letter you wrote to your mom.
But I won't have you lying to so many people.
As your former teacher, I must insist...
...on correcting your work one last time.
Did you really think...
...that the contact details I left you were from her?
Mother...
You set off the very next day, didn't you?
The door swung open, and there she was.
But you never did meet her...
To fulfill my destiny...
Telling a pathetic little lie like that...
You bitch...
You casually strolled into her laboratory.
Carefully carrying a bunch of junk...
...that you planned on showing off to her.
But she wasn't there, was she, Watanabe?
Hey. What are you doing?
This is Assistant Professor Yasaka, right?
Yeah. You know her?
She's the person I admire most in the whole world.
Right... But she's Assitant Professor Seguchi now.
Seguchi?
Yep. This person. They're on their honeymoon right now.
Kind of amazing, huh? Getting married at that age. H...hey!
You threw everything to the floor, and stormed out in tears.
I sure know a lot, huh?
I was watching the whole thing.
It was me who sent you her details.
Kitahara... The girl you killed...
Told me about your Achilles' heel.
Shuuya's just lonely.
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.
So I searched her out. It didn't take long to find her.
To find the person you were so desperate to see that you resorted to murder.
To find out where she lived...what she was doing...
Shut up!
Plus I wanted to see just how much you cared about your mommy.
Was the little boy who ran away crying really the same person who talked tough in those videos?
I decided against it.
My beloved mommy threw me away.
Worse, she probably doesn't even remember doing it.
I left the university.
I hate this. I've had enough. I want to die.
Taking as many people with me as I can.
These were the real thoughts that ran through your head as you set the bomb.
You idiot...
What the fuck do you know?
You're the one who's clueless here.
Why do innocent people have to die for you?
This was between you and your mother.
So why did you have to drag Manami and Kitahara into it?
I didn't care who I killed.
Then why not start with your beloved mommy?
Shut up!
What are you doing? Give me that!
The police are on their way to your house.
It won't be long before they discover Kitahara's body.
She was the only one...
...willing to understand the proud, pathetic little creature that you are.
I only killed another kid my age.
So juvenile law is on my side.
Nobody's going to punish me for it.
Even if the law protects you,
I'll never forgive you.
After disarming the bomb this morning,
I took a trip to visit someone.
And took them that lovely little present of yours.
You were so desperate to meet her...
...and it was so easy for me.
She had just returned from her honeymoon the night before.
I told her everything.
How much you loved her. And how many people you had sacrificed for her.
She hadn't forgotten you, you know.
Stop...
Anyway, I gave her your present...
...that little invention of yours...
...and left.
She was a wonderful person.
So I was praying that you wouldn't press the detonator.
But you...went and did it anyway.
Just kidding...
I heard it too. The sound of something important to you disappearing.
But it wasn't a pop... It was more like...KABOOM!
Stop it!
Watanabe...
You're the one who made the bomb.
And you're the one who pushed the detonator.
This is my revenge.
I have plunged you into the depths of hell.
This is the first step toward your redemption.
Just messing with you.
Hello, Adri.
Um, this isn't easy.
I wasn't strong enough to tell you face-to-face.
Maybe this is the way to avoid useless arguments.
I'm leaving.
I love you so much...
...but I can't carry on with you.
Please don't look for me, and don't hate me.
THE HIDDEN FACE
Good evening.
What are you having?
Whiskey with one ice cube, please.
Right away.
I don't like seeing men cry.
When a man cries, it's because he feels guilty.
Not always.
Excuse me. We're closing up.
Never mind.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.
What's up, pal?
What are you doing?
Leave him, he's drunk. Let's go.
But he hit me! Didn't you see?
- Let's go. It's over.
- Sure, sure.
What happened?
Why did they hit you?
Nothing happened.
Careful.
Ooh. Ah.
Does it hurt?
No, it's nothing.
You can't go like this.
I'll call a taxi. Where do you live?
Where do I live?
- No.
- What are you doing? Ha, ha.
I'm conducting.
What's the tempo?
Don't turn it down, I'm conducting.
Forcefully.
Don't fall down.
One, two, almost there.
Three, four. Good.
- Careful.
- Where's a sofa?
Careful.
Good morning.
Where am I?
My Place.
I have to go.
Adrian, isn't it? I'm Fabiana.
- How do you know my name?
- You told me.
What happened last night?
Why were you fighting?
I really have to go.
Thank you.
That's all for today.
Whiskey with one ice cube.
I came to apologize.
I was a dick this morning.
Yes, that's true.
I also wanted to thank you for helping me.
You didn't have to.
- Anyone would've done it.
- No, I don't think so.
Excuse me.
Would you like to sit with me?
No, I can't, I have to work.
Sure. Then I suggest something.
What?
Wow, this is incredible.
The instruments are arranged from lesser to greater volume.
First the strings: violins, violas, cellos and basses.
Then woodwinds, horns and percussion at the back.
And that's it.
It's a very special place.
Thanks for bringing me.
You're welcome.
- I like seeing you like this.
- Like what?
Relaxed, happy, okay.
I bet you're married or have a girlfriend.
Neither.
I like this mirror.
Fabiana.
Hello.
- Have you been up long?
- No.
Want some breakfast?
Let's go.
This place is huge.
Why don't you live in the city?
It's quieter. I concentrate better.
Nature is inspiring.
Yes, but not just the beautiful side.
I like what's behind too, hidden, you know?
Hmm.
- When do you go to work?
- I'm not working today.
No? I am.
Sleep here tonight.
I'll pick you up later.
All right.
Okay.
Morning, maestro.
- Morning.
Maestro.
I assume there's no news of Miss Belen Echeverria.
- I don't know anything.
- Have you got company?
Are we interrupting?
Come in.
BUITRAGO If I may.
Nice to meet you, miss.
Francisco Jose Buitrago, DA's office.
Fabiana Caicedo.
- Bernardo Ramirez, my partner.
- How are you?
Your girlfriend hasn't left the country.
I confirmed it with Immigration.
- We want to look at the house.
- Is that necessary?
Absolutely, maestro. You never know.
- What was your name?
- Fabiana Caicedo.
Fabiana. If I may.
Ah.
Beautiful.
Very nice. Very nice.
Congratulations, a very pretty house.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yours, isn't it?
Rented.
How long have you lived here?
Almost two months.
Did Miss Echeverria leave anything?
A few things in the bathroom.
Creams, a toothbrush.
And work items. That's her workshop.
What's going on?
She didn't disappear.
She left me for another man.
- The police are investigating.
- It's routine.
They don't know anything.
Her friends or family in Spain?
I tried every means to contact her.
They never replied.
Nor do I want to alarm anyone.
Aren't you worried?
Of course, but I know she's all right.
You don't think she's dead?
No.
- What if she was kidnapped?
- Please.
Do they think I've got her buried in the garden?
What are you doing?
Come up, it's late.
- I'll be right there.
- I'll be waiting.
- Fabiana.
- Adrian, don't scare me.
What's wrong?
I don't like the lights going out in this place.
They do when it rains. It's fine.
Are you all right?
Come here.
See? It comes back on its own.
Ha, ha. Don't be scared.
You're so clean.
You left me waiting.
The water was lovely.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.
Can you get the dog out, please?
Hans, out.
Fabiana, don't you think it's a bit rushed...
...this guy going out with you just after his girl vanished?
No, I don't.
I wouldn't be so calm if I were you.
- Why?
- He's a suspect.
That doesn't mean he is guilty.
Besides, she left him.
We don't know that for sure.
Are you jealous?
You finally got what you wanted, a guy with money.
Better than a cop with a shit salary.
You may be right.
Tito.
The orchestra manager. Remember?
I'd like you to meet Fabiana.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Oh, I saw you.
I was right behind you in the concert.
Roberto Peña.
Fabiana Caicedo. Nice to meet you.
Tito makes sure all this comes off perfectly.
He's a wonderful boss.
On the contrary, Adrian, you know we were lucky...
...and privileged to have you.
The orchestra and I won't forget you.
I'll miss you when I go, which is soon.
That's life.
Hans.
Out. Get out of here.
Who's there?
Adrian?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Does it still hurt? Here.
In half an hour it won't hurt any more.
All right?
I don't want to be alone in this house.
What if something bad happened to me?
Nothing happened.
The lights went because of the rain, and the dog scared you, that's all.
No? What happened?
I think there's a ghost.
- Ha, ha. Fabiana...
- Don't laugh, I'm serious.
What ghost? Where is it?
It's here. Listen.
Right...
- Hear it?
- There is a weird sound.
See?
It could be the wind through the plumbing.
No?
Hmm.
Ghost down there...
...if you bother Fabiana, you'll be dealing with me, all right?
I think that'll do it.
No, something's going on here.
Don't worry.
Let's go to sleep.
I'll put ice on your head.
Thanks.
Yes.
Yes, that's me.
What?
Yes, I'll be there in half an hour.
What's wrong?
What happened?
It was the DA's office.
They say they've found a body that could be Belen.
They want me to identify the body.
We have the body here of a young lady with similar characteristics...
...to Miss Belen Echeverria, and we want you to help us identify her.
- Very well.
- Follow me.
Mr. Salamanca.
- Hello.
Her face is unrecognizable due to the fire.
It was impossible to identify her.
It's not Belen.
- Are you sure, maestro?
- Completely.
FABIANA I'm sorry.
- Hi.
- Who were you talking to?
- What happened out there?
- To nobody. I was looking for a book.
How did it go?
- Was it her?
- No.
Belen is no longer in my life.
All right?
I love you.
Are you following me or not?
Why this great honor, you cooking?
- I cook a lot.
- Yeah.
I have to tell you something.
Good or bad?
Well...
Remember I was a candidate to conduct the Bogota Philharmonic?
- Yes.
- They called me today...
...and they've chosen me.
Really?
- Adri, really?
- Ha, ha. Yes.
Congratulations, honey.
That's great.
I'm so happy, I really am.
I leave in 15 days.
In 15 days?
- For how long?
- A year.
A year?
Well, then...
- I don't know.
- You are coming with me?
What, to Bogotá?
You want me to go to Bogotá for a year with you in 15 days?
What do I do about my job, for example?
Come and then we'll see.
Okay.
If I come with you, do you promise to take care of me?
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.
What?
You won't leave me alone?
You'll be with me?
Mm, I won't leave you alone for one second.
Adrian was wonderful.
There are very few conductors of his age with such talent.
I wasn't wrong to get him.
No, you have a good eye.
- So do you.
- Well, I'll get him.
- Well done, Tito.
- Congratulations to you too.
Thanks.
Yes.
- Hi.
- Hi, Belen.
How are you? I was looking for you.
I was saying goodbye to Veronica.
Remember her?
- Sure. How are you?
- How are you?
Great.
- Did you like the concert?
- Very much. You were all great.
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I didn't know you were such a good conductor, sir.
Excuse me, miss, are you trying to pick me up?
I won't deny it. I am a little.
- And are you picking me up?
- Who else?
- I don't know.
- "I don't know"?
- Eh?
- I'm just kidding, silly. Ha, ha.
I know you only have eyes for me.
This house was built by a very interesting Italian architect...
...a very famous one.
- Oh, please.
- Ha, ha. This is my dog, Hans.
He's a good dog, aren't you, Hans?
Hello, Hans. You're gorgeous.
It seems he likes you.
I love dogs.
Then some modifications were done.
I took care of the garden.
Botany is my passion.
- Is your husband German too?
- He was.
He came to Colombia to work, and I followed him, in love.
A toast to that.
Mm. You have a piano.
It's not just any piano, it's a very fine German piano.
- May I?
- Sure.
- Do you play?
- No, not a note.
But my boyfriend does.
He conducts the philharmonic.
Oh, yes? How marvelous.
- Like you, I followed him to Colombia.
- Ah.
That's love.
For some time, I've been living in a small flat in the city.
I only spend weekends here.
Here we have the bathroom.
I'm going back to Berlin in a month.
I've got mixed feelings about it.
If you like the house, you can have it when you like.
- There's only one drawback.
- What's that?
The person who stays has to look after my dog, Hans.
No, no problem. As I said, I love dogs.
Fabulous.
Adrian.
What's the purpose of the table here?
- I don't quite understand.
- It's a great position.
Hans, get off.
So looking at the leather first...
...I like this one best, for the texture and color.
It'd mean making one with a rubber wedge like this...
...and another with a wooden heel.
Excuse me a second.
Hi, Emma. Good.
Yes, he's with me, and he's behaving really well.
Oh, perfect.
Hans will be so happy to see you.
Okay, see you tomorrow, then.
- Who's this beastie?
- That's Hans.
Is it a problem letting him loose here?
No, we love dogs here, and dogs love music.
Hello, Belen.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Are you still rehearsing?
- No, I was talking to Veronica.
- Hello, Belen.
All right, then.
Finish your whiskey, rehearse...
I'll see you in the car.
I'll go too.
Miss Veronica, you appear to have forgotten your violin.
Maestro.
- We weren't doing anything.
- And I'm not saying anything.
Aren't you going to talk for the whole trip?
Belen?
Do you take all your musicians into your office, or just the girl violinists?
Can't I speak to the musicians?
Sure, but talking and flirting aren't the same thing.
- You're exaggerating.
- I'm exaggerating?
Yes.
I've seen you with her before.
- When?
- Forget it.
Do what you like.
It's your problem if you screw up.
Don't get a shock if one day you wake up and I'm not there.
I'm sorry.
- How are the new designs?
- Fine.
Have you sent the sketches to Spain?
Yes, last week. They're very pleased.
Is the leather here all right?
- Fine, good quality.
- That's great.
I'm going.
Adrian?
What is it?
What have you got going with that violinist Veronica?
Jeez, Belen.
I've got nothing going on with her.
Then why do you call and text each other?
You looked at my phone?
Answer me.
I flirted with her a little, that's all.
Nothing happened.
I couldn't do anything to hurt you.
Then why flirt with her?
- We all flirt.
- No...
...we don't all flirt.
I love you and I'm with you.
There is nothing else.
What can I do for you to believe me?
Fire Veronica?
All right, fire her.
- I can't do that.
- Okay.
Get going. You'll be late.
It's fine.
I just need to be alone, that's all.
I left behind my life in Spain to come here with him...
...and I don't know if it was the right decision.
My husband was very involved with his work.
It always came first.
But he couldn't live without me.
What did your husband do?
He was an engineer.
He had a prodigious mind.
He wooed me with it.
Can you believe it?
Sometimes I wonder...
...what would happen if something happened to me...
...if I died or something.
How would Adrian react?
Why don't you test him?
What do you mean, "test"?
Yes, teach him a little lesson.
Love has to be absolute, doesn't it?
Can you keep a secret?
Come with me.
My husband felt they could come for him...
...at any time, like others in South America.
So he built this place.
He was obsessed with it.
He said it was a place where one could die in peace.
And so he did.
Go in.
Reinforced glass, one-way vision.
Utterly soundproof.
It's hermetically sealed.
This is a dynamo to turn on the light.
Look.
See?
With this speaker, you can hear everything outside.
This is crazy.
And here?
It's strange.
I haven't come in here for a long time.
Thank you for showing me your secret.
It's ours now.
- Goodbye.
- All the best. Take care.
- I'll call you when I get to Berlin.
- Okay.
- All the best.
- Thanks.
Have a nice trip.
And thanks for everything, Emma.
You're welcome. Take care, eh?
Hello, Adrian. I'm leaving because I've met someone...
...at the gym, and he gets me hot.
Hello, Adrian.
Look, I'm off to Spain, and you know why?
Because I'm fucking fed up.
Hello, Adri.
Um, this isn't easy.
I wasn't strong enough to tell you face-to-face.
Maybe this is the way to avoid useless arguments.
I'm leaving.
I love you so much...
...but I can't carry on with you.
I think this is the best for both of us.
Please don't look for me, and don't hate me.
VIDEO
FOR ADRIAN
Hello, Adri.
Um, this isn't easy.
I wasn't strong enough to tell you face-to-face.
Belen, I just saw the video.
I don't get it.
I don't know what's going on.
Call me when you can, okay?
Adrian! Adri, I'm here! I'm here! Adri!
Adrian! Adrian!
No, don't go, Adri!
Holy shit.
Come on.
Fuck!
Adrian! Adrian!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adri.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
Adri.
Help me.
...but I can't carry on with you.
I think this is the best for both of us.
Please don't look for me, and don't hate me.
- Do you suspect anyone?
- What do you mean, "suspect anyone"?
She's a beautiful woman.
Suddenly there's an admirer, a friend, a lover.
No. We hardly know anyone here.
She was alone a lot, but I doubt it.
This was the 8th of August, the last day you saw her.
- Yes.
Mm-hm.
Mr. Peña?
I saw her the day before.
She came here.
Did she say anything that could help us?
Why don't you tell them, Adrian?
- We argued. Nothing important.
- Everything's important here.
A couple's spat, that's all.
What happened was that
Belen surprised Adrian...
...with a member of the orchestra.
Nothing happened, they were having a drink...
...but Belen was annoyed.
It's not important, it isn't. What's important is finding out where she is.
- That's what we have to find out.
- We have to wait now.
Maybe she'll turn up.
Maestro, we have no traces of a kidnapping or forced disappearance.
We'll go to Immigration and see if she left the country.
We'll check your house to see if something can help us find her.
So you don't think anything bad happened to her?
These cases are more common than you might think.
Even in this country.
- All the best.
- What?
Adri.
Adri.
What do you mean, "all the best"?
Adri.
What does "all the best" mean?
Adrian.
You can't say that!
It couldn't be worse!
Adrian!
Adrian, look at the ripples!
Adri, look at them!
Adri, no. Adrian!
Adri!
Fucking hell.
What's wrong with this?
Come on.
Don't do this to me, please.
I like this mirror.
No, please, no.
Adri, please don't do this.
Stop it, please, stop.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it! Shut up!
Where the hell did you come from?
That's my toothbrush.
Fucking bitch.
Fucking bitch.
Help!
Help! Here! Help!
Help! Here! Help!
Oh, I scalded you.
What a bummer, eh?
Sorry, but I've got to do it.
You understand, don't you, Fabiana?
Fabiana!
Fabiana, can you hear me?
Hans.
Out. Get out of here.
Fuck.
Having a great time, huh?
How old are you? Five?
What are you doing?
The key. Fabiana.
You've found the key, Fabiana.
Okay, now think. Fabiana, listen to me.
Very good, Fabiana. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Think.
What are you doing?
Don't do that! It's not a necklace!
Listen to me!
Why do the lights cut out in this shitty house?
Fabiana, no. The key, Fabiana!
Will you pass me that?
Thanks.
Yes. Yes, that's me.
What?
What's wrong?
They say they've found a body that could be Belen.
Don't smile, bitch, I'm not dead.
Well, you're not as thick as I thought.
Start.
Stop.
Good, Fabiana. No.
Don't stop now. Fabiana, come back.
That's it, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Start.
Stop.
Is anyone there?
Yes!
Are you talking to me?
- Good, Fabiana.
- Adrian, is it you?
Don't play with me.
Come on. Come on.
- Papa?
- No.
Christ, Fabiana, think.
- Belen?
- Yes!
Come on, Fabiana.
- Are you dead?
- You wish. Come on.
Are you alive?
Are you trapped?
Yes!
Did Adrian lock you up?
No. Come on, Fabiana, keep asking.
Keep going.
Behind the mirror?
Yes!
Good, Fabiana, good.
No.
The other mirror is the door?
Yes!
Good, Fabiana.
Come on.
The ward robe, Fabiana.
The wardrobe.
How the hell do I tell you?
The wardrobe, the wardrobe.
Very good, Fabiana.
Yes.
Fabiana, what are you doing?
Fabiana!
Why won't you open up?
What the fuck are you doing?
Open up!
I'm sorry.
- Hi.
- Who were you talking to?
- What happened out there?
- To nobody. I was looking for a book.
How did it go? Was it her?
- Fucking bitch.
- No.
Fucking bitch.
Fabiana, you fucking bitch! Open up!
Fabiana, you fucking bitch...
...you can't leave me here.
Fabiana, open up!
You can't leave me here!
Open up! Open up!
Adrian.
What are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
Are you all right?
Go to bed. I'll be right there.
Relax, Hans.
Relax, it's all right.
It's all right, relax.
Maestro Salamanca.
- Ramirez.
- Everything all right?
Fine.
It's my duty to inform you that as a judicial officer...
...Miss Belen Echeverria is now my case.
Officer Buitrago called me this morning to tell me.
I hope you find her soon.
- We'll do all we can.
- Thanks a lot.
Do you want something?
Listen, maestro, be very careful what you do.
What's wrong with you?
I don't really care much about your girlfriend.
But if something happens to Fabiana,
I'll kill you.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Can I have one?
- You don't smoke.
What about the Spaniard?
- What about him?
- How's it going with him?
Fine.
So are you going to Spain with him?
- We'll see what happens.
- And the girlfriend?
I don't know.
It's better she doesn't turn up, eh?
Belen.
Belen, are you all right?
ARE YOU
OKAY?
What happened?
Hello.
Why did you change everything around?
I wanted to surprise you.
This bathroom works properly.
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.
And the view from here is nicer.
Do you mind?
No, but I wish you'd asked me first.
I thought you'd like it.
It's fine.
- Adrian's not here.
- No? And where is he?
Working.
That's what you think.
Take care of yourself, Fabiana.
Veronica.
Hello.
Let's see.
I like you a lot.
I love hanging out with you, but what we're doing...
I can't go on.
Okay.
People, we'll begin on C.
Wind instruments, you are the melody.
Stand out, all right?
Violas, basses and cellos, heavy on the triplets.
Yes?
Let's go.
One and two and...
Belen.
Belen.
Belen. Belen.
This message is for Miss Belen Echeverria.
I inform you that Emma Engel has passed away in Berlin.
The family wants to sell the house from Germany, so I need you to...
Translated by:
Silvia Grumaches Cortina, Raul E. Reyes
Let's go! A1! -There's a pulse.
Code green.
We're going to intubate this guy and fix the hole in his heart.
Got it!
Looks tight. Pressure is holding.
Okay, call CT surgery, tell them they've got a sick one coming up.
Where's the bedroom?
-This is your bedroom.
And your kitchen, your dining room, your study... It's 'real' New York living.
And there's a bonus. The view is amazing! Go ahead.
This is a great view? -Interested?
APARTMENT FOR RENT
Excuse me.
Hi! Someone called about a rental here.
It's not ready yet. -Could I see it?
You're looking at it.
I can't afford this. -It's 38.
What? -The place is 38. thousand?
Alright, what's the catch? Are you planning a nightclub down on the first floor?
The utility will be separated. It takes a lot to heat up a place like this.
So, expect comet to stick it to you in the winter time.
Right. -This'll be the best view in the building.
Are you the 'super'? -Owner, actually.
Right.
- My family bought this building in the '40s...
...and to answer your question,
'No', there is no nightclub.
One of my tenants started to move out so I'm renovating the apartment.
Until then, it could get a little noisy down here.
I don't mind noise. I am an ER doctor, so...
...when we sleep, we really sleep.
Well, a couple things about the building. Er... it doesn't give the best cell phone reception.
Okay... Er... I can give that up.
And there's the 'F' line.
A maintenance track that runs directly under the building but usually at night.
Alright, I'm gonna need your Social
Security number and three references.
Oh, I can get you all of that including records of my taxes for the last 5 years if you like.
I prefer no pets. -Of course.
Alright, the heaters bang loudly in the morning.
You haven't check my references. -I will.
Take a look around.
I'll get back to work.
I've got to be uptown in exactly 100 minutes.
See, you've got 60 to get this shit out of this rented truck...
...or I've got to charge you for another day.
Take a deep breath. I don't want you to strain yourself talking.
You hired the only movin' guy in New York who doesn't actually move furnitures? -Yeah, right.
Well, you travel pretty light.
-I've got rid of all that.
Light 'tll I saw the bed in half and burned it.
But I need a place to sleep tonight.
Not easy at forgiving. -Change is good.
Shall we go and get that mattress?
Huh, Hi! -This is my grandfather,
August, Juliet...Juliet, August.
She is our new tenant.
Got any pets? -No.
Are you loud? -No, not at all.
Sorry, I scared you.
Nice to meet you.
This is Crystal Meth. 10 mg. Biotin.
Don't do anything, please! -Calm down, it's gonna be alright.
No, don't test me out!
No. -It's gonna be alright.
Heard you had a long one.
Hmmm...that was an insane day.
Rob and I are going out today. You wanna come? -No thanks.
I think I'm just gonna go home and get to bed early.
JACK: "YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
MY CALLS. CAN WE TALK?"
You've got to stop thinking about him.
-The love of my life cheated on me...
...in my own bed.
Always when I look at myself, all
I see is someone who wasn't enough.
You were enough. You are enough.
More than enough. He's an asshole.
I gave up my dream to move to New York city...
...to be his. And he just threw all away.
It is an 'eye-opening'.
It's not going to kill you.
And you're going!
We can handle this. It's gonna cost you a little extra because of all the unused space.
Grandfather doesn't want to change the integrity of the structure.
Okay, no problem. I'll take care of it.
Alright, Thank you.
Hi! About to start making a lot of noise?
If I get the city's approval there.
A lot has to be done around here.
Yeah, I bet. Oh, thank you for the gift.
It was so kind and really thoughtful.
The gift that was outside my door yesterday?
That wasn't me. -August?
There you are.
Hi! I wanted to thank you for incredibly thoughtful gift.
I'm just putting myself in your shoes.
I thought if I were a woman alone in a new apartment...
...surrounded by strangers, what would I want?
I don't have much company.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should really go.
Thanks.
Great.
Max! I didn't recognize you outside the building. -Who is this?
This is Max. This is
Sydney, we work together.
Very nice to meet you, Sydney.
-Nice to meet you too, Max.
I haven't heard about you.
Hmmm... nice day, isn't it? -It is.
Sometimes I feel all I ever do is work... I don't know... I decided to stop.
...come out and feel Brooklyn, you know.
Well, Max would you like to have a drink with us?
-No, no thanks. I'm actually getting ready to leave.
It was very nice to meet you. -Me too, Max.
He is my 'landlord'. -So?!
I am his 'tenant'. -You mean, what if he sucks...
...and you can't get away from each other. -Yeah, it's not recommended.
So you've thought about it! -Shhh...
Hey Max, do you actually... Do you mind walking me home? -I love to.
Goodbye. See ya. -He's cute.
Thanks.
Bye, guys.
August, er... he worries about me.
People from his generation were married with ten kids by the time they were my age.
He's a kind of unique guy, isn't he? -That's one way to put it.
Unique, difficult, a pain in the ass would be another way to categorize him.
Is he okay?
Up until a year ago we were partners in the building.
We did everything together, fixed everything together, made all the decisions together.
Then he had a stroke.
And what about your parents?
They died when I was very young.
What about your family?
My parents, they are kind of 'after-the-facts' hippies.
I guess that makes you the black sheep of the family, huh? -Definitely.
Yeah, for me, 'Rebellion' was going to Med school.
'Free love' just sucked as far as I could tell.
Led to a quick divorce and my parents parted, so, I was every other weekend with my dad.
I never really knew where my home was.
Not until Jack and I moved in together.
Jack? -My ex.
I thought all hippie kids had weird names.
Oh, you do, don't you?
What's your real name?
Juliet, that's my real name.
-What's your middle name?
Wanna sit here? -Are you Ignoring my question?
No, I just thought we take in the view. -Okay.
When I was little, I used to walk around the neighbourhood at night ...
...and looked into windows of families from televisions ...
...brothers, sisters, parents...
...eating, you know, talking.
And I knew I couldn't have that, but ...
...just watching them, somehow, made me feel like I was part of it.
Seeing all these families is sweet.
Bliss.
-Bliss? -Yup!
Dr. Bliss.
Dr. Bliss.
Yup. -Very nice.
Thank you.
Sorry. -No, don't be sorry, Juliet.
I'm an idiot. Of course it's a bad idea.
It's not what I mean.
I'm just confused.
Reading the wrong signal.
Jesus Christ. Juliet, calm the fuck down.
I don't know what I was expecting. -You were expecting 'rebound' sex, honey.
Hot landlord 'rebound' sex!
See you later.
-'Bye doll.
Jack.
"You picked up".
What do you want?
-"I just called to say, 'Hi'".
Well, Hi!
"Can I see you?"
"Juliet I'm sorry". -I gotta go.
I don't think it's good idea for us to talk yet.
-"Juliet, it's Max".
Max?
-"Listen, eh, sorry about yesterday".
"Well, I was wondering if I can make it up to you with dinner tonight?"
You like old things. -As long as I do.
You know, I'm not really one of the 'text-message' twitter crowd.
Technology seems to be about telling everybody your deep dark secrets.
I don't know, I guess I think
'secrets' should be 'secrets'.
What?
It's just... starting to feel like home.
Safe, warm and inviting.
You did it for me.
Good.
So, what's your 'secret'?
Why aren't you married?
I guess I just never found anyone that... -Anyone that...
You 'got' me, I guess. Not that I got.
And the truth is, I'm not very social.
You know, it's probably the way I grew up.
I spent my whole life taking care of my family's building...
...and recently, my grandfather. Because of that...
...I've never had a relationship that mattered.
You know, going to that Art
Opening thing the other day...
That was a 'big deal' for me.
I'm sorry about that day.
-No, I was just surprised ...
...that you ... -That I what?
That you wanted to kiss me.
Why wouldn't I?
'Landlord'.
-'Tenant'.
Messed up.
I have a pulse.
He thought he was dying.
It's not a stroke, is it?
I called it Schizophreniform.
He should see a psychiatrist.
Are you okay? -Yeah.
Someone called about a rental here?
Excuse me. -Max.
This is Max. This is
Sydney, we work together.
Sometimes I feel all I ever do is work... I don't know... I decided to stop.
...come out and feel Brooklyn, you know.
Hey Max, do you actually...
Do you mind walking me home?
Sorry. I'm just confused.
Reading the wrong signal.
Sorry, God, I'm an idiot.
Of course, it's a bad idea.
I'm confused. Reading the wrong signal.
Jesus Christ. Juliet, calm the fuck down.
Max? -Huh.
Max, I can't do this.
I can't do this. I can't get him out of my mind.
Jack... I still only know his smell.
And the way he touches me, I...
I don't want it to be like this.
I see.
Do you understand, right?
I'll call you later.
I know everything that goes on in this building.
I know everything that goes on in your head.
You think I don't know how your brain works?
Just like your father.
Jealous and perverted. -That's enough.
Your mother, she was beautiful.
She married a weak man.
Then, she gave birth to another.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
-Yeah, I'm sorry. I suddenly felt weird.
It had nothing to do with you. I just need more time.
That's okay, it tells me that you take being with someone seriously.
And I like that.
Well, you know, I was thinking about it and ...
Maybe we shouldn't have done that, you know.
Meaning that we live in the same building.
Really? -No offence, but I just...
I just needed company, I guess.
-I'm so glad you feel the same way.
It's been a lot to me the last couple of weeks.
I should go. -Yeah, okay.
Okay... We'll see.
Have a nice day. -You too.
What is the matter with you?
Why didn't you stand up for yourself?
Just like your father.
Your mother, she was beautiful.
She married a weak man.
Then, she gave birth to another.
This place is driving me crazy.
And I thought I knew everything about this building.
I never realize your kitchen had an old wine closet.
August's old place had one of this, but they must have covered this up years ago.
I think it's really cool. Can I use it?
Absolutely. I'll fix this up for you and get it out of your hair.
But I have to work. -Hey,
I can do while you're gone.
That's really sweet of you. Thanks for being such a good friend.
JACK: "HI DOC. I MISS YOU... TRUCE?"
Hi, no...er...Let me help you with this. -No, that's okay, I...
No, I should help you. -That's sweet.
Er... it goes in the kitchen?
Yeah. -Okay, Good, Yeah.
You've got a lot of stuff!
You're...eh...cooking? -Yeah.
Maybe I'll stay and help, yeah?
-You don't have to do that.
Juliet, I wanted to try to speak to you about something.
It's been a little confusing to me. Because you kissed me first.
What? -Yeah, You made the first move.
You kissed me first and now you're acting like nothing happened.
I'm sorry. We were just getting to know each other, you know...
...to see if things work or didn't.
I mean, That's what people do.
I don't do that.
You shouldn't do that either.
Yeah, ten minutes is perfect.
Alright, I'll see you then. 'Bye.
Aw... oh, Emily! Hi,
I missed you so much.
What happened to her? -She has been picking up a fight with a German shepherd.
I didn't know what to bring to a dinner like this, but... -Thank you, they're beautiful.
We'll sit here in the living room. -This place is huge.
And cheap. -How much?
Anything available for me?
I'm not quite ready for that.
Right.
Thanks.
How about the German Shepherd? -She had been having a hard time at the Doggie Day Care.
Why do you need a Doggie Day Care? -I've been travelling a lot in the last few weeks.
It was business. -I wasn't thinking that.
Look, I could tell you everything. -I don't want to know.
You were never home. I literally never saw you.
So tell me you slept with someone else because I won't do it.
I was with someone else.
It was just a flirtation, but it felt amazing for a moment.
I want you to be clear about something.
It was nice but it was never you.
It's the guy with the beard, right?
How do you know that?
I followed you one night and I was going to ring your bell, but... -You followed me home.
I wasn't good anymore.
My life without you... I missed you.
I've missed you too, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry dinner burned.
Never mind.
I want you to stay. -I can't,
I've got to get up at 7am.
I am in no way prepared.
I'm gonna be up all night.
Wanna keep Emily tonight?
No pets allowed. -Here, keep this.
I love you. Alright, come on.
So, what's going on? I heard you were late again.
Yeah, I slept with my alarm 3 times in 2 weeks and I never oversleep.
So, you've been out late? -No, no, there's something creepy about my apartment.
The guy gives you a gorgeous apartment at an unbelievable price.
He cooks for you and is an absolute gentleman. And that's creepy? -No...
There's something about it, I can't wake up in the morning and I don't know this feeling.
If I were you, I would keep the apartment and get a louder alarm.
There are cool features triggered by movement.
So any activity in your apartment will be recorded after 10 minutes intervals.
It is a wireless system which can be accessed through your computer.
This position and the position in your living room, will cover as much of the apartment as possible.
But that still leaves the kitchen and the bathroom uncovered.
That's okay. As long as I have the front door of my bedroom.
You've got that.
These things have automatic night visions. So, no need to leave the light on.
These babies will get anything that moves!
So, you're going to sub-let? -I'm sorry, what?
Most people put this in if they're going to sub-let, have a party or even for baby-sitters.
So that nobody steals anything.
-Yeah, I might sub-let.
Here we go.
That's it. Call if you have any questions. -Thanks.
Grandfather. -Max, what are you doing?
It's my life now!
I'm sorry that we have to rush.
Call me when you get home. I love you.
Hi! This is Juliet Dermer. I'm sorry.
Somehow, I seriously overslept ...
I'll be there in an hour.
"YOU HAVE 7 NEW RECORDINGS."
I need a TRO on these
ASAP, please. -Okay, got it.
JACK: "HEY BABY DINNER
AT YOUR PLACE AROUND 7PM."
Thanks.
This is Juliet. -I faxed the toxicology report you ordered.
Great, thanks.
"HIGH LEVELS OF DEMEROL, VALMID AND VALIUM
FOUND IN THE BLOOD AND URINE SAMPLES."
Jack, don't go to my apartment! I don't know how it happened, but somehow...
Jack?
Juliet! hi there!
You just get home? -Yeah.
Look what I've found. This great old bottle of wine from August's wine closet.
How... how to open it? -No need. I already cracked it.
Wine had to 'breathe' a little bit. Mind? -No, that's great.
You had a rough day, Juliet?
Yeah. -Right here.
Drink this. Maybe it'll help. -Thanks.
Sit down.
To our friendship.
Cheers.
You're not gonna try it? -I'm not eh...
Juliet, are you okay?
It's just that I'm exhausted,
I'm not really sleeping well.
I like this wine a lot, it's cool.
I'll be right back.
Juliet, will you please put your phone down?
Why are you calling him?
Where is he?
Why did you give him keys to my building.
Do you know where he is? -Why did you betray me, Juliet?
Sit down!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Juliet. -What did you do to him? What did you do?
Hey, Juliet... You're so beautiful.
This time you get to be awake,
This time you get to remember.
Help!
Help!.
Come on.
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?!
You bitch!
There's nowhere for you to go!
Juliet...
...I saw you!
You could pull me out of these walls.
I didn't want this. I didn't want this at all.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!
I was never gonna hurt you.
But you fucking betrayed me!!!
All right, we are in the processing room.
This is the center of the slaughterhouse.
This is where Walter Simms was finally killed in a shootout with the police.
And this is where we are going to try to contact his ghost.
I definitely sense a presence in here.
A very strong presence.
Yeah, my whole body feels strange.
Hair on my arm's standing up.
I'm gonna roll my EVP recorder, see what we get.
Walter Simms, are you here?
Come on, Walter.
Talk to us.
You still lingering?
Relishing the seven sadistic murders you committed?
I'll tell you what I'm sensing.
It's the boys.
Their pain.
God, do you feel that?
I know the terrible things you went through, but it's okay.
No one can hurt you now.
Guys, uh,
I'm gonna go in the room where the boys were held.
Maybe it'll be easier to make contact in there.
Okay.
I'm gonna set up for some
EMF measurements. Doug.
You want to go check out the hanging room?
All right.
It's been 20 years, and still, the feeling in this place, it's... it's hard to describe other than to say it feels...
...heavy.
This is where Walter Simms did his dirty work.
I want you to show yourself,
Walter.
Make yourself known.
Maybe this will entice him.
Yeah, that's right.
Just like the one you used to butcher those boys.
Why don't you come and get it?
It's right there.
Or are you too afraid because I'm not some defenseless little child?
The hooks are moving.
He's here.
Owen! Owen! Owen!
It came from this way.
Where's Doug?
Where is Doug?
WOMAN:
Are you okay? Owen?
(whispering):
What is that?
(Carrie screams,
Owen yells)
Really cheery place.
Yeah, yeah, tell me about it.
I spent a lot of time here working on the original case.
What do you mean, original case?
Oh, uh, 20 years ago, the security guard,
Walter Simms-- he lived in a trailer on-site.
This guy, Simms, abducted seven boys over a nine-month period, brought them here and killed them.
Mmm.
And I mean really grisly stuff.
So he ended up dying here himself.
After escaping his sentencing hearing, he shot it out with the PD.
So you're saying that this homicide is related to the original case.
Yeah, the victim tonight is rigged up just like the boys were.
The hook, the evisceration-- exactly what Simms did
20 years ago.
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say that old Walter was back from the dead.

PHILLIPS: I remember I was in sixth grade when all this was going on.
Walter Simms-- called him "The Butcher."
Of course, we didn't know it was Simms at the time.
We just knew that kids were disappearing.
Kids... my age.
And even after
Simms was killed, his legend lived on.
They say that if you say his name three times, he'll come back to life and gut you.
Maybe that's what happened to our victim.
Let's try it.
I'll conjure him up.
You slap the cuffs on him.
Walter Simms.
Walter Simms.
Walter...
Don't! If you want to do that sort of stuff, you could do it when I'm gone.
Let's go.
Oh, you can really see why this place spawned so many ghost stories, huh?
Oh, yeah. This place creeps me out in all kinds of ways.
Slaughterhouse...
This is why
I stopped eating meat.
Yeah, really.
So, no murder weapon?
No. Smear is from one of the victim's partners.
They're the ones that found him.
The male slipped and fell in the blood trying to get the victim down.
Did our people touch this?
No. You think it's been moved?
Well, there's blood on the bottom, but it wasn't in the blood pool.
There's no memory card.
Somebody must have taken it.
Hold up your arms.
Okay.
I mean, man, this is just crazy, you know?
I'm gonna need you to give me your clothes at some point, since you fell in the blood.
Yeah, sure.
I got others in the car.
I mean, God, I just can't believe this.
I mean, seriously,
Carrie, can you?
So, uh, how long have you been doing this... ghost hunting?
I don't know.
I've always been sensitive, you know, to... things from the other side.
But working with Doug and Owen-- that's new.
A few months, maybe?
And you were filming for some TV show or something?
No, it's, uh, for the Internet, mostly.
A lot of people do this.
They upload videos.
It's... it's really nothing.
Well, it's not nothing anymore.
I mean, holy crap, if we have definitive proof of the spirit world crossing over like this--
I mean, are you kidding me?
Owen, just stop!
Doug's dead.
You don't really think your friend was killed by a ghost, do you?
You haven't been inside, have you?
I've been in a lot of haunted places, and I've never felt anything as strong as what I felt in there.
That's why I wear this.
It's always protected me.
I'm gonna ask you one question.
Then I'm gonna give you one chance to answer it.
Where's the memory card that was in your friend's camera?
I don't know what you mean.
He was filming, right, with the camera?
So where's the memory card that was in it?
I... (scoffs)
Okay. I'm gonna have to confiscate all of your shooting equipment.
No, wait.
Okay, okay, uh,
I-I took it, okay, but I-I need it.
I mean, what if Doug actually filmed his killer?
Yeah. What if?
I'm Captain Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.
You the property manager?
Thomas Pope.
My firm is developing the property.
So you've been told what happened?
Just that somebody was killed.
One of the ghost hunters.
Oh, so you knew they were here?
Yeah, yeah, they had permission.
My boss approved it.
I handled the paperwork.
They signed about a million liability releases.
Thank God, right?
I guess.
Look, I... I didn't mean it to sound like that. I...
Can I ask what happened exactly?
We don't know yet.
You know, I warned my boss that something bad was gonna happen.
I knew it.
What do you mean, you knew it?
I spent some time inside here.
There's a feeling.
A feeling?
So you people take all the time you need.
The minute you're done,
I'm knocking the whole place down-- the building and all the ghosts inside.
Hey, Doc.
A little shorthanded, are you, today?
Normally, you don't call me in until you're done with all the scary stuff.
Normally, but I wanted you to see something on the victim David brought in from the slaughterhouse.
Heard the murder was reminiscent of a previous crime.
Well, that's why you're here.
The killing wasn't just reminiscent.
It was an exact duplication of the original crimes.
So, killer did his homework, right?
I don't see how.
The original victims were all juveniles.
Their autopsy reports were very closely guarded.
They were never made public.
And the M.O. unique enough that it couldn't just be by chance?
I would say not.
The incision the killer made-- it isn't a straight cut like a butcher or a hunter would make when dressing an animal.
It waivers to the left, to the right, and then back again.
It's almost as if he was carving an "S."
"S" for Simms.
Seems like every town has a place like this that all the teenagers know about.
Yeah, their parents don't.
Obviously, it's not impossible to get in here.
Which means our ghost hunters may not have been alone last night.
Morgan.
Come look at this.
It's a shrine.
To the seven boys who were murdered here.
Some of this stuff looks like it's been here forever.
Yeah, and some of this stuff looks like it's... pretty new.
Someone's been coming here and making offerings to these kids.
Or to their ghosts.
What?
Did you hear something?
No.
No, it's nothing.
BRODY:
Hey.
Did you notice... if our female ghost hunter from earlier was missing an earring?
SANDERS:
No.
That's not hers.
Makes me wonder whose, then.
So, let's say you're the victim.
It's dark.
Your back is turned.
You're filming.
I swing this hook hard enough to bury it in your back.
Well, that would be more than enough to incapacitate me so you could hoist me up into the air.
And then it's just a single slash with the blade.
Yeah. So there's no reason it couldn't have been one person working alone.
All right, let's Luminol everything, make sure we didn't miss any blood.
It's for you.
Do you want it? SFPD.
I'll call them back.
I'm gonna hit the lights.
Okay.
Whoa.
Oh, my God.
There's blood everywhere.
Must be animal blood.
This is the kill room.
Floor must be porous enough that the blood is still present.
I'm going to go do the hallway.
Finn?
Yeah.
Come here and look at this.
Wow. Everybody's going in and out, tracking the old animal blood without even knowing it.
There's the wheel marks from David's gurney.
Mm-hmm.
And look over there.
There's one set of prints going the other way.
The hall dead-ends.
Where would they be going?
Looks like they walk right through the wall.
Or right up to it.
There's got to be some reason whoever left these came down here.
There's something in here.
Yes, there is.
Hey. I think Hodges caught us a break.
Check this out.
What am I looking at?
You're looking at footage from one of the ghost hunter's cameras.
The surviving male,
Owen Webber.
Now, according to his statement, he was alone in the processing room during the murder.
Which it looks like he is, right?
Well, keep watching there.
You see that?
You mean that little glitch in the picture?
That's more than just a glitch.
His camera shut off for 98 seconds.
That might be enough time to commit the murder.
That's more than enough time.
RUSSELL:
Oh!
Look at you. You got yourself a murder weapon.
It was stashed just outside the murder room.
Killer probably planned to go back and get it later.
What makes you say that?
Well, because he didn't bother to wipe off his fingerprints.
You got prints?
Victim's partner. Owen Webber.
Well, it's about time.
When am I gonna get my gear back?
You're not gonna get your gear back.
What?
Well, your gear is what we now call evidence, Owen.
Well, I know that it's evidence.
That's why I need it.
The online paranormal groups are going nuts over what happened to Doug.
I need the proof.
I need to show them that it was Simms.
Sit down.
And let's talk about what you did to Doug.
STOKES:
You recognize that, Owen?
It's mine.
I brought it along to the slaughterhouse.
Sounds like premeditation.
Uh, no.
I-I... I brought it to excite the spirits.
We use objects, something emotionally significant to the dead to provoke them.
I mean, come on, man, that's Ghost Chasing 101.
That's Murder 101.
What?!
Why else did you turn off the camera right before Doug was killed?
I didn't turn off the camera.
My battery pack went dead.
Don't you check your batteries before you start?
Yeah, of course I did.
And they were both full.
But spirits can siphon the power away.
That's how they get the energy to materialize.
Come on, Shaggy.
My BS meter is redlining with all this ghost science of yours.
What BS?
The knife provoked Walter Simms.
The battery provided the energy he needed.
The very fact that Doug is dead is proof positive of what I'm telling you!
Owen didn't kill Doug,
I'm telling you.
Because you believe a... ghost killed Doug?
Because I know Owen.
He would never.
Well, right now, the evidence says otherwise.
You went into the slaughterhouse, didn't you?
You know now what I was talking about, those little boys...
The only thing
I felt in there... was cold.
If you'll excuse me.
Why are you denying your gift?
Your grandmother is still with you, you know.
Even though you try to push her away, she's still there.
What do you know about my grandmother?
She had a funny name.
Olaf, was it?
And she was a psychic.
Seems to think you are, too.
You share her gift.
What do you want from me?
Your help.
You heard those boys.
I know they were trying to say something.
I-I just don't know what it is.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Thanks, but...
I don't want that.
You need it.
ANDREWS:
What are all these?
Tools of the trade for the modern ghost hunter.
E.M. pump, motion sensors, thermal imager, EMF detectors.
Ghost Meter Pro? Really?
Someone actually makes these?
That's not a toy.
I just spoke with Nick.
Apparently the interrogation was less than fruitful.
He's hoping that we can find a way to pinpoint the exact location of the suspect during the time of the murder.
But both his cameras were off, right?
His cameras were off, but his EVP recorder was still on.
EVP?
Electronic Voice
Phenomenon.
Ghost voices we might otherwise miss.
The point is, even though we don't have picture, we have sound.
Ah. And you think you can use the sound to figure out where the suspect was.
That is the idea, yes.
So, why do you need me?
You mean, aside from the fact that I greatly admire your mind and abilities?
The job requires going back to the slaughterhouse, and that is something that I don't relish doing alone.
Hey, Jules?
Do you got a moment?
Sure.
Want you to introduce you to Scott Tunnicliff.
CSI Finlay.
Nice to meet you.
Scott's kind of an expert on Walter Simms and the slaughterhouse murders.
Wrote a book back in the day.
Ah. You working on a sequel?
No, actually, I brought him in.
He had considerable access to the investigation at the time.
My uncle was... undersheriff, so admittedly,
I got... special treatment.
But I brought along all my old raw research material if it'll help.
Tell her your theory, Scott.
I've always felt, uh,
Simms had an accomplice.
Uh, someone to help lure the boys into the car.
RUSSELL: Yeah, look at this.
This is a photo of Simms.
That's a real boogeyman.
Yeah, not really a face that kids would flock to.
There were witnesses to three of the abductions.
The statements were the same.
The boys approached
Simms' car, climbed in on their own accord.
So, might be Simms had help.
FINLAY:
Who's this woman?
She's in every trial photo.
She was a trial groupie.
Showed up every day, never took her eyes off Simms.
Was obsessed with him.
RUSSELL:
Why?
What do you see?
Her earring.
It looks exactly like the earring
Morgan found at the slaughterhouse.
If it is, she was there.
So, where is she now?
How was that?
HODGES: All right, do it again.
This time, a little higher like on the recording.
All right, I think you nailed it on that last one.
Pretty sure we can pinpoint where Owen was now.
Yeah.
No way he was the killer.
He was in this room when the murders happened.
Of course, that means that our killer is still on the loose, right?
How'd we do?
I hope you got what you needed.
My throat is killing me.
Well, we cleared
Owen as the killer.
Did you see all this low-end activity running through the center?
Yeah, it's some sort of low-frequency wave.
Seems to be present everywhere in this place.
But we can't hear it because it's...
Because it's below the human range of hearing.
It's infrasound.
Can you, uh, pitch it up?
Raise the frequency until we can hear it?
Mmm.
Yeah. You know, there are studies that actually suggest that infrasound could be the scientific cause of hauntings.
The vibrations create sensory phenomena suggestive of a ghost.
Fascinating. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
You'll have to show me those articles some time.
We could test the theory now, by finding the source of the low-frequency waves and eliminating it.
Science!
Wow. Who's the crazy?
Ah, you can tell right away, right?
This woman was obsessed with Walter Simms.
Mmm.
She was at his trial every single day.
Yeah, we've dealt with a few women like this.
I'll never understand it.
So, I think she could be our killer.
But there is no record of her name.
I did a facial recognition search against our database, and I got nothing.
Why not try running one just against Internet images?
She didn't hide from the camera before.
Why should she be any different now?
All right, let's run it.
Who knows?
You know, maybe she's... turned her life around by now.
That one.
Monica Downs.
Wow, she even has a
Friend Agenda page.
Hmm.
20 years has done nothing to cure the crazy.
The basic theory behind infrasound is that, even though we can't hear it, it still has a physiological effect on us.
The low frequency waves cause vibrations in different parts of our bodies.
Getting stronger.
I hear some other noises, as well.
Here, this way.
Okay.
So, as a result, people experience butterflies in the stomach, chills, hairs standing on end...
Check, check and check.
Not realizing there's a physical cause, people attribute all these sensations to...
...a haunting.
Feeling's getting stronger here.
Definitely oppressive.
Yeah.
This is it. This is what's generating the infrasound.
Oh, well, here's an idea:
Let's turn it off.
Uh...
Uh...
That's amazing.
The oppressive feeling's gone.
The chills, the stomach...
It's gone, right?
Yeah.
All these years, the sensation everyone's had that this place is haunted...
It's perfectly benign.
There's nothing bad here at all.
Aah!
WOMAN: No! No!
Okay, what is that?
Oh, no, nothing bad can happen here.
There's no haunting.
It's just sound waves!
Shh.
This way.
We got blood.
ANDREWS: Oh, God, it's one of the ghost hunters.
Your infrasound can't explain that.
Yeah, it's Hodges.
We need help.
So... it looks like she was sitting there, in front of the shrine.
Killer surprised her, maybe.
Hit her as she turned around.
The bat was here already.
You remember?
It was part of the toy collection.
What I can't figure out is why she came back here in the first place.
She came because of the boys.
She told me she was still hearing their voices.
She wanted... to talk to them.
Well, she's talking to them now.
We need to find out who else has been coming here, bringing all these toys.
Better bag them up and get them to Henry.
What? What is it?
Her EVP Recorder.
Must have fallen when she was struck.
CARRIE (over recorder):
I'm sorry for all the horrible things that were done to you.
What can I do to bring you peace?
Please, I know you're here.
I can feel you.
Don't be afraid. Just reach out.
Talk to me. Give me a sign.
Funny, kind of looks like you're... waiting to hear an answer.
You don't know this about me, but, uh... when I was younger,
I used to be... kind of psychic.
I know.
But my grandmother, she had it.
And I guess I inherited it.
(chuckles) Why have I never heard about this?
When I became a CSI,
I felt like I had to choose: science or... the other.
I chose science.
So, now you've reconsidered?
Yeah.
I mean, 'cause of Carrie... and what I feel in this place.
But I-I thought the feelings came from the infrasound, the vibrations from the ventilation fan.
Henry turned it off, and since then,
I-I don't feel a thing anymore.
That's just it.
I still do.
CARRIE:
I only want to help you.
That's all I want, is for you to have peace.
Where did you... God, no...
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
Sounded like laughter.
Like kids. No, play it again.
Ow. Ow.
You can't possibly know what I know.
Blinded by the confines of corporeal reality, you're both woefully ignorant of what waits on the other side...
Got your trial groupie.
Ma'am, that's enough.
That was quite a ride.
For you.
Good luck.
She's a nutcase.
Yeah, a nutcase with blood on her shoes.
Your shoes and this shoe print that we found at the murder scene... they match.
Match, match, three on a match.
And that's bad luck, you know.
Want to talk about bad luck?
You stepped in a dead woman's blood.
I remember you.
You do?
From Walter's trial.
I do.
How wonderful.
Now, do you remember being at the slaughterhouse earlier?
I do.
I went to talk to Walter and my boys.
Your boys?
Yes, that's what I said-- my boys.
My family.
The family that Walter created for... us.
BRASS: So, when when you talked to Walter, did he tell you to kill Carrie?
How about Doug?
BRASS: Huh?
I didn't do that.
But I... I know who did.
You do?
He didn't know that
I was there watching.
Ticktock, like a watch.
BRASS:
Tell us who you saw do this.
It was one of my boys.
Mine and Walter's.
Kids, you know?
I should probably have a talk with him... if you'd like.
Morgan said it was eerie.
She wasn't lying.
Yeah.
That came just after the killing?
Yeah.
But listen.
Now, I'm pretty sure the laughter's real.
But it's prerecorded.
How do you know that?
Watch the screen as I play it, and I'll freeze the wave form.
Now, right there, just before the laughter, there's a high-frequency hiss, almost, and then it dies out immediately after.
What is it?
Well, it's got to be the speaker on whatever device is playing.
It powers up just a fraction of a second before the sound comes out.
So the killer played a recording of children laughing just after the murder?
That might be even sicker.
Hey, just finished
DNA analysis on the toys.
And?
I found DNA from a single source on every single one of them.
What about the murder weapon?
Same DNA, same as the rest of the toys.
Let me guess.
It belongs to the psycho groupie, Monica Downs.
Actually, no.
The source was an unknown male.
Suggests that Monica Downs is not the killer.
ANDREWS:
It gets stranger.
Finlay gave me DNA from the original investigation of the Simms murders.
Cops collected one sample from Simms' car that was never identified.
Matched the DNA on the toys and the baseball bat.
So we're saying the killer was in Simms' car 20 years ago.
In the front seat of Simms' car.
All the DNA from the boys who were killed came from the back of the car.
Well, it sounds to me like we're back to looking for an accomplice.
Certainly does.
A male, obsessed with the crime, enough knowledge of the details to be able to re-create them perfectly.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Then come back here and rub our faces in it.
Well, his alibi checks out.
He said he was at a book signing, he was at a book signing.
What about the DNA?
Sent it to Henry, but I'm afraid it's only gonna confirm that... he's not our guy.
Oh, hell.
Well...
I still like our theory.
Looking for the old accomplice in the current murders?
I mean, we know he's a male.
We know he was in Simms's car 20 years ago.
What we don't know is where he is now.
Exactly.
All right, just-just play with me for a second.
Monica Downs said that she saw
Carrie's killer, right?
That it was one of the boys.
Monica Downs is crazy.
The boys are dead.
All right, all right, but what if they're not?
Russell, the cops found all seven bodies.
What if there was an eighth?
What-what if... what if Simms abducted an eighth boy and forced him to be his accomplice?
Cops finally catch up with Simms and put him in jail, boy runs away.
Which means he might still be out there.
What are those?
Missing persons reports from 20 years ago.
When Simms was snatching up kids.
Yeah.
I found three other boys that disappeared within that timeframe who were never accounted for.
Well, only one of them has a photo.
Yeah, as far as the other two go-- uh, Brian Oden grew up on the streets.
There were quite a few homeless that reported him missing.
And Jonathan Harris grew up in foster care.
Everybody just thought he ran away, including PD.
FINLAY: So, any one of these could be
Simms' eighth victim, our so-called accomplice.
How do we I.D. him and find him?
FINLAY:
This kid was in Simms' car.
Okay, his DNA is in there.
He must have left prints.
But PD ran the prints
20 years ago.
Yeah, but he was a juvenile, so he wasn't in the system.
You're right.
Got to be over 30 by now.
Maybe that's changed.
Hey.
Where are you going?
If anybody's looking for me, just tell them I had to step out a little while.
You going to the slaughterhouse?
I thought we wrapped all that up.
The place is about to get torn down.
If I don't do this now,
I'll never get the chance.
Greg, what do you really expect to find there?
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.
Or maybe I'll be able to reach out to Carrie, and with her help, maybe to the boys.
You know how that sounds, right?
Yeah. Crazy.
But it doesn't matter.
I have to do this.
Here we go.
Got a hit on the set of prints from the glove box in Simms' car.
What's the date of birth?
June 8, '81.
Means he was 11 at the time.
Okay, so this has got to be our eighth kid, right?
SARA:
Scroll down.
Wait a minute. I saw him.
Where?
At the slaughterhouse that first morning, talking to Brass.
Well, who is he?
He manages the property.
Thanks again for coming down to let me in.
I really appreciate it.
No problem.
After you.
You know, in a couple of days, this whole place will be gone.
Bulldozed to the ground.
The building, everything inside.
What were you hoping to find?
I don't really know.
Well, but you're here.
Right?
You must have some idea.
You want to talk to them, don't you?
Sorry. It's, uh, my kids' ringtone.
It's my wife calling.
Don't.
Just drop it!
Haven't enough people died here?
BRASS:
Thomas Pope-- family man, wife and kids, good job, an education, but that's only half of who you really are.
See, Thomas Pope is an invention.
You made it up.
He doesn't exist before about 12 years ago.
Your real name is
Jonathan Harris, isn't it?
When you grew up, you were passed from one foster home to another until one day your luck really went bad and you were abducted by Walter Simms.
No, you're wrong.
You're mistaken.
Well, we found your DNA in Walter Simms' car, along with your fingerprints.
We're not wrong, Jonathan.
We know who you are.
I am not Jonathan.
I am not that damaged little boy, not anymore.
I know you feel responsible for those other boys, the ones who were killed.
Isn't that why you still bring them toys?
You were 11 years old.
You were a little boy yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
But they won't let me forget.
They blame me.
They torment me.
And I can't make the voices go away.
You were there.
You had to have felt them.
Tell us about the ghost hunters, Doug and Carrie.
I didn't want them inside.
I tried to tell my boss that it was a bad idea.
Why was it a bad idea?
Because I knew what would happen.
I knew that they would learn my secret.
I have worked very hard to get past everything that has happened and build a new life.
If they found out,
I would lose everything, everything that I have built as Thomas Pope.
But I-I mean, how are they gonna find out?
Who's gonna tell them?
From talking to the boys.
The ghosts of the boys?
I couldn't let them talk to the boys.
Hey.
Hey.
Do you have a minute?
I do.
Uh... back before
I came to Vegas,
I worked up in San Francisco.
I helped put away this guy-- true sociopath.
He posed as a cop, pull women over at night, sadistically assault them.
We found 17 victims.
I suspect there were more.
You're talking about Lyle Brinks, right?
Yeah.
I had no idea you were a part of that.
He's up for parole.
The cop that I worked with-- she's worried that he actually stands a chance of release.
Okay. What can I do?
I need a few days.
I-I... I want to be there.
I want to testify, make sure that doesn't happen.
I understand.
You got it... but, you know, while you're up there, do me a favor.
You know, take some time off.
It's been a rough couple of months.
You deserve it.
Okay.
Hey.
Great job today.
That must have been really scary.
I'll tell you, when I heard that laughing,
I sure as hell wasn't laughing.
You know, I... I think I owe you an apology from earlier, implying that you were crazy.
You know, as much as this is our universe, surrounded by science every day,
I still like to think there's room for a spiritual side.
Well, no apology necessary, but it's accepted.
Thank you.
But who knows? I mean, maybe you're right.
Maybe this whole thing is crazy.
What? Why you saying that now?
Well, when I was at the slaughterhouse with Pope,
I was doing everything I could to hear or feel anything from Carrie or the boys, and
I mean, there I was with the killer standing right behind me, and none of them bothered to send up a signal, or a-a single ghostly warning sign?
(laughing):
Yeah.
Yeah, you would think, right?
But I think... someone was looking out for you.
You made it out of there okay.
Let me buy you breakfast.
Deal.
But I'm driving.
Of course you are.
Let's go.
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
I can take this, right?
Sure.
My doctor says,
"You can't have a garlic knot.
" I mean...
- Really?
- From mama Lucia's?
Your--no, not right now, thank you.
- Whoo. Is she new?
- You've met Jenny before.
Oh, is she Gordon's assistant? Hey, where's Gordon?
Look, if the doctor's telling you not to have garlic knots,
Don't have the garlic knots.
Okay, I won't. -
All right, just take care of yourself, would you?
What do you want to talk about?
There's this investment property
That I want you to see. - Uh-huh.
And in this climate, it'd be an incredible opportunity.
Before I do anything with it,
I want to get your opinion.
My opinion? Why?
Because you have real estate/business acumen, son.
- Acumen?
- Yeah.
We'd have to drive there, stay overnight.
Come on, dad. I don't have time to go stay overnight somewhere.
Where is this place?
It'd be like father and son time, you know.
We could get a chance to talk, Adam.
We don't have enough of that.
I'll call Kristina.
I'll just make sure it's clear with her, okay?
That's all I wanted to hear.
- All right.
- All right.
You're not gonna be sorry.
All right.
You want some garlic knots?
Why don't I take those from you?
No. I'll have as many garlic knots as I want.
Your real estate acumen?
He used the word "Acumen"?
- Yup.
- That's worrisome.
Yeah, I was wondering if he wanted me
To go in on a piece of,
I don't know,
Vacation real estate with him or something.
Then he tried to sell it to me as father and son time.
Yikes.
Hey, speaking of which,
I brought something over
I want you to look at.
Yeah, what's that?
That's great. What about it?
- That's great?
- Yeah.
You don't think it's weird to receive an invitation
To your son's birthday party in the mail?
You're lucky you got invited at all.
Hey, whose side are you on?
There are no sides here.
You just got to pay attention to your kid.
Yeah, listen, I've been spending
A lot of time with Jabbar, okay?
He knows me pretty well now, and he's smart,
So if I don't plan this party,
He's gonna sense that.
Great chair.
- You like this?
- Yeah, high quality.
Look, if you want to be there,
Just, you know, give Jasmine a call
And tell her you want to be a part of it.
She's just sending a lot of mixed messages.
It's, like, half the time she wants me to be the dad,
And then the other half, she's keeping me on the outside.
I just wish she would pick a path and stick to it.
Well, then you should go.
You should call Jasmine and say you want in.
Except you shouldn't use those words.
I don't get it.
Is there a sexual joke in there?
Amber, I'm coming in.
Mom, can you just give me a minute?
I'm showering. - Yes.
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just brushing my teeth.
Hey, do you have the toothpaste in there?
- No, no, no.
- oh, my God!
Hey, Mrs. Bra-- it's just me.
No, you're dead.
Get out! No, not now.
Later.
We're screwed.
Ah! You have got to be kidding me.
Excuse me, but who the hell is that running out of my house?
Amber! Jeez.
- Dad, it's Amber's boy-
- ex-boyfriend from Fresno.
Don't--don't worry about it.
I can't get any privacy.
Why are you being such a tattletale?
Wait-- Damien, the demon seed?
Why is everybody yelling at me?
We got to set some boundaries, Amber.
Calm down, grandpa.
- I'm not yelling at ya.
- Yes, you are.
- It's okay.
- It's my house!
All right,
I'll take care of it, dad.
I know you're mad at me.
What do you mean?
I'm not mad at you.
You're mad at me because of Mr. Cyr.
Because of dating your teacher.
Please, it has nothing to do with that.
And I know you're still mad, and I'm sorry.
It's fine. I don't care.
I'm sorry I went out with your teacher.
It's fine.
We left Fresno, you know, so you could have a better life.
And I pulled you away from a lot of things,
But he was one of 'em.
And then, to have him here in the shower,
I mean, Amber, come on.
Don't screw everything up for yourself
Just because you're mad at me.
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
Not everything I do is about you.
I love him, and he loves me, okay?
Oh, God.
What?
Why do you insist on making every mistake I made?
You know, every time you talk about your life being a mistake,
All I hear is that my whole existence is a mistake
And you... - Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
I don't want to talk to you right now.
Honey, I don't want to leave you so upset.
Please leave me alone, okay?
Please? I don't want to talk to you.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine, mom!
Please, just leave me alone. - Okay.
I'll come back.
Don't take any rubber bands off, please!
Wait, wait, whoa. Why?
Well, because I've got 'em all counted up.
18 blue,
53 reds,
118 brown. There's too many brown.
And I don't want the brown rubber bands to take over.
I want my ball.
I want my ball! - Okay.
All right, you know what?
Let's go upstairs.
We're gonna finish getting ready,
And we will talk more about this in the morning.
- I want my ball.
- No. No.
Hey, hey. - I want my ball!
Sweetheart, the ball is staying right here, okay?
- Please, I want my ball.
- No.
We will not touch it.
I promise you.
We're not gonna change it. Okay?
I promise.
Now get upstairs.
You know who I am?
I'm sorry.
Your Amber's grandfather,
The Vietnam vet.
Well, Damien, gee,
I'm just sure you're a nice guy,
And everything, but you left your sock in my house,
But you took my granddaughter's innocence.
Here's your sock.
I'm gonna give you a 20,
And I want you to fill up your tank,
And I want you to clear out of here.
And I'm asking you nicely.
What about Amber?
Damien, if this van is within a five-mile radius of my house, I'll know it.
'cause I can smell it.
And then you and I are gonna have a visit,
And I'm gonna spend some quiet time with you.
Do I make myself clear?
Sir, I just want to let you know
That I consider myself a student of philosophy.
Live and let live.
I mean no harm to anyone.
I am an irrational hardass with rage issues.
Don't piss me off.
- Come in, come in.
- Thanks.
What's happening?
- Oh, um...
- Good to see you.
Just--yeah.
I was gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?
- Sure.
- Chamomile or orange pekoe
Or green? - Whatever. Perfect.
- Whatever? Okay.
- Hi, Max.
Max, buddy, aunt Julia just said hi to you.
Oh, did you know that pill bugs and sow bugs
Are often mistakenly thought of as insects,
But they're actually classified in the group called isopods...
He got a new book on roly-polies today.
Hey, buddy, honey, aunt Julia's probably not in the--
Honey. So Adam is not here.
He's at the office. Um...
That's fine. I actually wanted to talk to you.
What's going on?
This is gonna sound stupid.
- Okay.
- It has to do with this ball.
Sydney's obsessed with it,
And basically I just wanted to ask you
If you could tell me about, you know, some of the first signs
That you saw with Max.
Um, why don't you have a seat?
- Okay.
- And I will be right back.
I'm just gonna try to rally him to get upstairs.
What were you guys talking about?
- Nothing, babe.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
- Can you do mommy a favor?
I need to talk to aunt
Julia about something.
Honey, please, I just want to talk
To aunt Julia for a little bit, okay?
Thank you. - Come up soon so I can get
My stickers. - I will. I promise.
Thank you. Okay.
Um, I am 100% sure that you have nothing to worry about at all.
How can you be sure about that?
Well, I'm not sure,
But I don't really understand. I mean...
Okay, she counted the number of rubber bands.
She knows how many of each color there are.
And she's so utterly fixated on it
That she can't make eye contact anymore if you talk to her.
Okay. You know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you Dr.
Pelikan's number.
He's our doctor that we use for Max.
He's amazing.
And he'll be able to tell you if anything's going on,
Which I really don't think that there is anything wrong.
I really don't. - Okay.
I just wouldn't worry about it.
Yeah, I'm--I'm, you know... - Oh, Julia.
- I'll be fine.
- It's okay.
Oh, so stupid. I'm sorry.
It's not stupid at all.
It's not.
I'm a horrible person, honey. - Why?
Because when Julia told me there might be something wrong
With Sydney, part of me felt glad and happy and, like--
- A big part?
- Like I couldn't stop myself.
It was weird. It was like this feeling just came over me--
Well, I think that's human,
And I don't think that's horrible.
What would be so wrong with having somebody else
In the family like Max? - Well, it doesn't feel fair.
Exactly. And he would be less isolated.
We'd be less isolated.
You're horrible too.
You are-- you're horrible too.
You were thinking it.
I'm not horrible.
You're the horriblest.
And those jeans are just terrible.
Why do you think my dad thinks
I have real estate acumen?
I think he's up to something.
Take these instead.
You should have seen your sister's face, though.
She was totally freaked out.
Look at Sydney compared to Max.
There's no way that these kids have the same thing.
Maybe she has a.D.D.
Yeah, or o.T.B.
Off-track betting? - O.C.D.
Yeah, there you go.
Whatever it's called.
I don't know.
I did do one good thing.
What's that?
I didn't tell her
About Max's rubber band ball.
Well, see, you're not horrible.
- I know.
- You're a sweetie.
I am sweet.
- Kaboom.
- Pow.
Let's try that again.
Kaboom!
All right. - Okay, I feel better.
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Now you could make me feel better.
I'll get you the lotion.
- All right.
- Right back. Lotion rub.
Ooh, Batman. What do you think?
We did Batman two years ago.
Does he like g.I. Joe?
His friend had a g.I.
Joe party last month.
Well, I know he likes spongebob.
He loves spongebob.
We did that last year.
Maybe I should have asked for the list of things
That you've already done.
You wanted to come here.
It was your idea.
Well, he's my kid.
I want to plan his party.
I want to be a part of this.
How about this? Baseball.
Think it'd be cute?
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?
Yeah, bravermans love baseball.
- Great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Paper plates and utensils.
About a dozen.
Okay, wait, a dozen?
That's not even gonna cover my family.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying my family's not invited?
You've seen my apartment.
It's tiny.
Yeah, well, they're his family too.
Okay, so how about you invite four from your family?
I'll just--like survivor.
I'll just pick four.
All right, how many people from your family are going?
- I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know.
Like, 10, maybe 15.
Oh, just 10 or 15.
Fine. Just, will you promise me
That we're gonna have an a's theme party
And not a giants?
- A's?
- Yeah.
Step aside.
Oh, you-- you don't--oh.
This is gonna get ugly.
Sydney is a great kid.
She is playful and cooperative.
Thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Is something wrong with her?
- Julia, just...
- I wouldn't say wrong.
She doesn't test in the norl range.
Sydney is gifted.
- I'm sorry. What?
- She's--
She tests
Way above average intelligence for her age.
Her issues in school are probably coming from boredom.
So iou have to make sure that she's in an environment
Where she is being challenged.
Something that you'll have to monitor over time,
And something that, as parents,
You have to be aware of, pay close attention to.
- I think we can do that.
- Good.
We're driving in the slowest lane.
What are we doing, about 30?
- Hey, I'm driving.
- Not very well.
You're driving in the slowest lane.
Do you remember the trip to the grand canyon?
Yeah. It was a good time.
Yeah. Remember, you vomited all over your mother's head?
You know what, dad, that wasn't me.
That was Crosby.
All right.
Well, go ahead and deny it.
Blah!
You know, I had a little confrontation
With the kid, and maybe I was a little hard on him.
I'm not sure.
Scared the hell out of him.
- All right.
- Do you think they caught
The zodiac killer?
Move over. We got a lane open.
You know what-- dad, dad, dad.
How's the sex life?
My sex life is fine. Why?
That's not what I'm hearing.
You learned to have sex in Vietnam?
Yeah, basically.
Well, I was a kid, you know?
I mean, gosh, those girls could teach you so much, you know.
Just--I was ready to learn.
She's not having orgasms?
So you were okay?
It was all Kristina's fault?
'cause the bravermans, you know, the braverman men,
You know what I'm saying. - Look.
We're strong in the sexual department, son.
Is this embarrassing to you?
Yeah. Yeah, it is a little bit.
- I'm gonna tickle you.
- Get off.
Is this why you wanted to come out here and take this drive?
Because you wanted to talk about this?
No, there's something
I want to uhow you...
Do you want to tell me what it is you're gonna show me?
No, I don't. I want to keep it as a surprise.
It's gonna be very exciting.
Now I got to pee.
How about a rest stop?
What are you, five years old?
How do you unscrew this thing?
Don't pee in the cup.
I'll pull over up here.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hey, miss braverman.
What are you doing here?
Are you kidding me?
If my father sees you...
He hinted that I should wash up,
But then I saw these plants that needed attention.
Damien, listen, you seem like a, you know, an okay guy,
But Amber's from a broken home.
Do you know what that means?
She doesn't know a serious relationship
From a sandwich yet, and the point is
I want her to focus on herself,
On her future, school, maybe even college.
- Yeah.
- There's an old expression.
If you love someone, set them free.
If they come back, they're yours.
If they don't, they never were.
You know what I mean?
It's not that easy.
You're right.
It isn't that easy.
But it would really help her out.
Just for now, you know.
Oh. Oh, boy.
I got this. - You got this.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I got this. Okay.
- I believe in you.
- Kristina.
- How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
I only have a minute.
Can I come in?
- Oh, please.
- Okay, great.
How you doing today?
- I'm good.
- Yeah?
Yeah, thank you. We're good.
We're good.
I just wanted to stop by
And drop off a couple of books for you.
- Oh.
- They were a real comfort to Adam and me.
And I also wanted to tell you the other day
When you stopped by,
I don't think that I fully expressed to you
How I feel about you and
Sydney and your family.
And I just-- I want you to know
That you're with us in our hearts.
Thank you so much.
We love you too, and, no, I knew that.
If you need any-- - yeah,
Kristina...
Yeah?
You know...
We-- as soon as we hear anything...
- You'll call me.
- I will call you.
Exactly. Thank you.
- We don't know yet, so...
- Yeah.
We'll see. Okay.
- I gotta run.
- Okay, great.
You have a good day.
Okay, thanks. You too.
Okay. Bye.
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.
Wha-- - you were so strong.
I thought she took that rather well.
She just went out with Damien
And didn't even bother to lie about it.
That's good, right?
No, it's not good.
In this context, it shows
A complete lack of respect.
Sweetie, you can't live their life for them.
You know?
Really. The best you can do is help them avoid making some of the mistakes you made.
That's about it.
I failed at that already.
You haven't.
Why didn't I just let dad kill him?
I'm out here quoting
Jonathan Livingston seagull
Like an idiot.
You were obsessed with that book.
And Amber liked it too, didn't she?
Why does she hate me, mom?
Daughters hate their mothers.
I think it's a law of nature.
But you know what?
Then they come back.
Sarah...
You're my best one.
Maybe not my best one, but you're the one that I...
Most identify with.
Not perfect Adam?
No.
You're the brave one.
You take risks.
You always took a chance.
You declared your independence pretty early on,
And you went for it.
You have to honor that person.
That you are.
'cause I do.
I mean, maybe I never said it
In, you know, those exact words before,
But...
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, sweetie.
I promise.
Think about this. If you buy it,
How long are you gonna have to hang on to it
Before it pays off? -
Well, that's the great thing, son, is I already own it.
Well, then what do you need me for?
Well, look, before I do anything else with it,
I was thinking what a great opportunity this would be For you, you know, for your company, right?
A new manufactory and a factory,
You know, that sort of thing.
And I was thinking that your company
Could buy it from me for a price...
Adam, when it comes back, this place is gonna be untouchable.
It's gonna be a great investment opportunity.
Who the hell, you know, wants to build a factory
In Thailand or Mexico?
I mean, come on.
You got the savings right here.
Plus, you can hire
American workers.
Now you're into that, right? - Yeah, definitely.
Well, who owns the rest of the complex?
- Office park.
- Sorry.
Other entities.
I mean, some of it's in foreclosure.
That's why the construction is stalled,
But I mean, come on, it's still got--
Still got plenty of advantages.
Hey, you still got that- the camera thing on your phone?
- Yeah.
- Well, okay, come on.
Why don't you take some pictures,
And right over here,
You can take 'em back to the office
And discuss it amongst yourselves
And all of that, right?
I mean, Adam, son, you're looking at some raw space.
- Definitely raw space.
- All right?
You get it? - Yup.
Oh, whoa, that goes right on this wall here.
I thought you said put it here.
So? I want that here.
So you just want to have two things hanging here
And then nothing over there? - Yup.
That's how your family does it?
How my fam-- wait, what are you,
The party expert now?
How many parties have you thrown?
Yeah, whose fault is that?
We are not gonna go there right now.
No, we're doing this right now.
No, we're not gonna do this right now.
Listen to me.
You robbed me of five years of my son's life.
What gave you the right to do that?
I'm decorating, and I'm seeing pictures of him All over the place, and that's all I'm ever gonna see of him At this age. -
That's right.
Well, you should have called me back
Because I called you three times, four times,
And you never called me back.
What was I supposed to do?
- You know, leave me a-
- - leave a message
On your answering machine?
"Hey, Crosby, it's Jasmine.
I'm pregnant. Call me back."
Yeah, anything would have been better than what you did.
You know what, after the third call,
I realized I didn't want you to call back.
I had this big, serious thing to do--
Have a baby and raise that baby,
And what I didn't need
Was some flaky guy in the picture.
Hey, it's my son.
You don't get to just make those decisions.
What do you mean I don't get--
That's my son too.
I gave birth to him, okay?
All of a sudden, now you want to play daddy?
What kind of father takes his son on a play date
And leaves them with a stranger in a pool?
It's not a stranger.
It was a lifeguard.
Yeah.
This is his party. I'm his dad.
My family is his family.
I want his cousins and his aunts and his uncles here.
They have a right to be here.
Hey. I'm talking to you.
Okay. Um...
You--you need to know that, um, my family Isn't exactly inclined towards you.
What does that mean?
Well, my father abandoned us, and they think you're--
You did just, like, the same thing.
Yeah, I didn't know that I had a kid.
How is that similar?
They don't know that.
Wait, they think that
I knew about Jabbar
And that I just blew him off?
It didn't seem to matter.
I didn't think you'd ever be back in his life again.
I'm sorry.
Just invite everyone.
Have 'em all come.
We'll manage.
I have to admit I like when you screw up, kinda.
It makes me feel like we're a little bit more...
Okay.
No, no, hey, hold up.
What are you doing? This is on me.
Dad, I can pay for my own room.
Two rooms? Come on.
That's crazy.
Uh, two double beds?
You have lovely eyes, by the way.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
Manisha.
Manisha. Can you say that?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Ice road truckers. Come on.
Hey, dad, can we just pause with the tv for a second?
I just want you to tell me what's going on.
What do you mean?
With this property.
You know, that place, it's not a great investment.
I wish I thought it was.
And you're a great salesman, but I don't think
You believe it is either.
Long-term it is.
All right, well, then, hold on to it.
I can't, Sonny.
Why not?
You're my firstborn son.
I never wanted to go to you for anything.
I give to you.
Especially now, I mean, with Max.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
I saw this opportunity.
I mean, how the hell was I supposed to know
There was gonna be a bubble?
I had to take a second out on the house
So I could grab it, and then all hell broke loose.
Pops.
Well, I mean, the country's in the toilet.
It's not just me.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Look, you have great instincts.
It's just--like you said, it's just timing like you said.
You know? - Yeah.
Bad timing.
Okay, now, lookit.
Now listen here.
Do you think there's any chance at all
With your company?
Dad, I said I will talk to them.
I will talk to them.
And you show 'em the pictures,
And you tell 'em that it's...
Both: Raw space.
I got it. Raw space.
That's all I can do.
What does this mean?
Does this mean you might lose the house?
I mean, do you need to talk to my accountant?
I have an accountant, Adam.
I'm just trying to help.
Yeah, I know. It's serious.
I mean, would we be here
If it wasn't serious? Come on.
Serious.
Does anybody else know about this?
Have you told mom?
Oh, I can't tell her this.
- You have to tell-
- you can't keep this from her.
Look, I will talk to Gordon.
Okay? - Yeah.
But you have to tell mom.
Okay.
- Want to see my room?
- Sandwich?
Would you like a sandwich? No?
Sandwich? No?
Watching your figure?
Hey, Crosby. I'd like you to meet some people.
This is my brother sekou.
Oh, great.
- And this is my-
- my mother Renee.
- Hi.
- Yes.
Mom, this is Crosby.
So nice to meet you.
Well, so nice to meet you, Crosby.
Sheila, could you help me?
Yeah, um...
- Hi.
- Hello.
Who are all these white people?
The cirque du soleil?
We did see one of those, but--
It's a houseboat.
There's actually a bedroom and a living room
And a kitchen.
It's pretty comfortable.
Well, that's an interesting choice.
Sekou.
That's a beautiful name.
Thank you.
You named him after sekou tarunga,
The African independence leader, I assume.
Now how did you know that?
Berkeley in the '60s, babe.
Oh, I hear that.
You know what,
I'm sorry, this is weird.
I know you're trying and all that stuff,
But where have you been, dude?
Um, I wish I had been here.
Yeah, that's your loss.
Yeah. No one knows that more than me.
You know, I'm just glad I get to be in his life now
And hopefully be a role model.
He has a role model, Crosby.
I've been here since the day he was born.
- Sekou.
- No, I'm just telling him how it was.
I drove him back from the hospital.
I stood at his christening. Huh?
Look, I moved apartments just to be closer to him.
I'm gonna go get the cake.
Sekou, would you help me?
No, I'm telling him how it was, mom.
I would like to say something if I may.
- Dad.
- Are there any more
Of those little corn muffins?
You seem to have a wonderful family.
I've met you, and I like you all,
But why are you treating my son
Like he's a pariah?
The only reason I can think of
Is because he's white. - Dad!
Grandpa, no one--
We think he has Tourette's.
He didn't mean that the way that it sounds.
Stating the obvious.
You know, maybe it's because he's irresponsible.
Renee, that is not my understanding.
Well, there's a five-year-old little boy here
That he hasn't seen for five years.
Um, Zeek, I think I understand
What you're trying to say.
Everyone here is upset with Crosby
Because they feel that he abandoned Jabbar and me.
But he didn't.
What?
I never told him
About his son.
- You what?
- Wow.
Uh, it was just, um, easier For me to lie to all of you
And let you believe that he was just like dad.
Easier for who, you or Jabbar?
Look, um, you know,
I was the one
That chose to have this baby
And not let his father know.
It was me. It was me.
And I'm sorry.
But if you're gonna be mad at anyone,
Just be mad at me.
Don't be mad at him.
Is it time for cake?
Oh, buddy, is it ever.
Yeah, let's eat cake now.
Maybe grandpa Zeek can help us cut the cake.
I'm on top of it,
Renee, I must say.
Is this too much mayonnaise still?
- No.
- Never too much.
Excuse me, by the way, why wasn't Amber there today?
- Um, she...
- She was studying.
Oh, well, I think she should have been there.
Sorry. Yeah.
Did you talk to mom yet?
Hey, Sonny, I told you
I would talk to her. - Okay.
- Kristina.
- Hey.
Um, I'm returning this.
I read it three times.
- You did?
- I did.
I did. - Was it helpful?
- Yeah.
- It's helpful, right?
I had no idea what you guys were facing.
- Well.
- I wanted you to know also,
Just, Joel and I both, we were so moved
By the way that you reached out,
And thank you for that, so... - Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?
You would do the same.
It's fine. - Yeah. Thank you.
How is Sydney? Is she good?
She's good, yeah.
We--we got the test results, and he said that
Her trouble's stemming from boredom in school,
And she tested gifted.
Gifted.
That's great.
That's--what am I- that's really great.
That's amazing. - Yeah.
I was embarrassed to tell you that.
- Julia, no.
- I'm sorry.
- That is amazing.
- Thanks.
That's wonderful.
I'm happy for you and her.
That's great.
Hey, I'm going out.
So I'll see you later, okay?
Good night.
Bye, honey.
We missed ya at the party.
- How was it?
- It was fun.
It was good.
I saved you a piece of cake.
That's nice. Thanks.
I'll have it when I get back.
Oh, no, take it with you.
It's a paper plate.
That's okay.
I'll have it when I get back.
Why won't you take the cake?
I don't want to take the cake.
I'm done trying to control you.
I--it doesn't work.
You know, I'm fine.
Are you?
Sometimes I'm not sure.
I just don't want us to be like this.
I love you so much.
I think I'll just...
Try to get along with you
And...
Trust you.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm meeting Damien.
He's picking me up.
Okay.
See you later. - See you later.
You look like a little baby.
It's all over your face.
So, like, the other day,
I got a "C"
On this test that I was, like, sure that I had aced.
- A "C"?
- It was so weird.
Well, I guess a "C"'s better than a "D,"
And you've had plenty of those, right?
Yeah, I guess.
You know, you could ace whatever you want,
But that stuff doesn't really mean anything.
I mean, after the electrical grid fails,
I mean, who's gonna survive?
Someone who gets an "A" On a test
Or someone who's been in the school of life?
It's all coming down, the whole world as we know it.
Really? That's what you think?
Yeah. I mean, I don't know when.
But I do know that what you get on a report card
Is gonna seem pretty insignificant
When you're living off the land
And fending off "Marooders."
What did you say?
Marooders.
But you know it's marauders.
Marooders.
Mm. Marauders.
No one says that. - Mm, marauders.
- Okay?
- Marauders.
Eat this.
You didn't tell me about your trip.
How'd it go?
Well, it was great.
Was our number one son helpful?
Now, I will tell you something, that kid Adam
Has got a great head for business.
Oh, you can settle an argument we were having.
Now we were talking about trips going to the grand canyon...
Was it Adam or Crosby
That vomited on your head?
It was Sarah.
Boy, you really don't remember, do you?
Well, I mean, there was so much going on.
You know, there's been quite a background of information.
I can't keep track of all of it.
Well, maybe that was because the vomit wasn't dripping
Down your face.
You were too busy laughing.
Oh, you got to admit it was funny.
This is the way it went.
Julia got sick
And threw up in my hair.
She was screaming her little heart out.
And I was trying to comfort her
While wiping puke out of my eyes.
You were too busy laughing to even think about helping.
You did me the big favor of pulling into a gas station.
While you were filling up the tank,
I was in that...
Blech, disgusting bathroom trying to wash the vomit
Out of my hair under the faucet in the sink.
Millie, I never knew it upset you that much.
Would you accept a belated apology?
I'm sorry.
Ha. Sure.
So what else about the trip?
Anything?
Adam, he snores like a chainsaw,
But he's not going to admit it.
What else can I tell you?
- Is he asleep?
- Yeah. The eagle has landed.
Thank God. I'm exhausted.
Well... I found Sydney's ball
Beneath his pillow.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, she gave it to him?
No. He stole it from her.U/
- He stole it from her?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Okay, honey, we have to call Julia and Joel.
Call them. Where's the phone?
Call them and what?
Give it back?
- Yes.
- Oh, screw that.
- What?
- Look, if she's
Such a little genius, she can make, you know,
A thousand of 'em using cold fusion.
- Cold fusion?
- Yeah.
Honey, you have to tell him that this is not okay.
He can't just take things without asking.
- Well, I did tell him.
- Okay. Good. What did he say?
He said he asked her.
- And?
- And she said no.
- So he just stole it?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- You are, buddy.
- Is that my rubber band ball?
- Huh?
- I couldn't find
The rubber band ball when you guys woke me up
With the laughing.
Why don't you come in here?
- Well, I asked her for it.
- You did?
You said I just had to ask.
No, I didn't.
You just said you can only have it if you ask her.
- But she has to say yes.
- You never said that.
What you reading about?
Water scavenger beetle.
Emerald click beetle.
What's your favorite beetle?
- Hercules beetle.
- Hercules beetle.
You know how much we love you, buddy?
Hmm? - As much as I love beetles.
What are you smiling about?
Your family is intense.
You think?
That's saying a lot, coming from me.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
I know that wasn't easy.
Yeah, well, I should have told 'em the truth
A long time ago, you know.
I think Jabbar had a good birthday party.
Yeah. Did you notice
That he had three pieces of cake?
Did you notice that he went into a weird little sugar coma
At one point on the third slice
With, like, drool coming down
Mixed with the blue dye? - Yes,
I noticed that.
He's very cute, our son.
I think I'm falling in love.
With Jabbar. - Oh.
- It's okay.
- Good.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.
You look like you saw a ghost.
Good. I was worried for a second.
Why don't you...
Why don't you come join me in the living room?
Okay.
I told Damien to go back.
It had absolutely nothing to do with you.
I hope you're happy.

Don't kid yourself,
Veronica.
There will be repercussions.
Highly aware of that.
Tell me again what happened last night.
This little girl told me her mother was pimping her out.
So she beat the mother's ass to a pulp.
Oh, you didn't want to call the police, or all the phones were broken?
You just decided to turn into the Incredible Hulk?
I didn't decide anything, Chloe.
I don't know.
I just got so mad
I couldn't see straight.
Out of control.
Oh, you're real tough.
Real tough.
Number one!
Speaking of out of control.
Looks like it's the Italians versus the Irish.
Happy St. Patrick's Day.
What are you doing out on a holiday that's got nothing to do with you?
Stop it. Come on.
Shut up, stupid.
Exactly.
Ow!
Was that a green bagel?
Threw a bagel at me?
Are you nuts?
How did the Jews get mixed up in this?
Come on! Sit down.
Hey, dude, come on now.
We're all good Catholics here, right?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gina, shut up.
Shut up.
I heard about Lauren Kempton.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She died last night.
Sone.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's sad.
She was a good lady.
Kiss my ass, guido.
You know what?
Why don't I give you another beating, huh, tough guy?
Security!
Security!
Get a little help here?
Okay, I think that's our cue.
Somebody!
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with these people?
Hey!
Congratulations on making it to 11:00 am before needing medical attention.
You are the champions of stupid.
Sit down!
Now!
That was kind of hot,
Chloe.
Gotta do what you gotta do.

I'm supposed to see Klowden to find out how much trouble I'm in, but you know what?
You don't do that to a kid.
That woman was evil.
You pick up the phone.
You call the police.
You know, if I were a man, none of this would be a big deal.
Yeah, if you were a man.
If you hadn't shot someone a week ago.
If you hadn't thrown a cinder block through Harris' window.
Okay.
All right, people.
That's enough.
That is enough.
Yeah, what he said.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
What the hell is going on here?
New medical show called
Cutting-Edge Medicine.
They're doing a piece on me.
Why?
Because I reduced the door-to-balloon heart attack standard from 90 to 45 minutes... and I'm very photogenic.
Shoot me talking to her.
Oh, no.
Aw, come on.
You're pretty.
You're crazy.
It'd be a great way for the audience to meet me.
I, uh--no.
All right, listen.
If the suits try to come down on you for last night, whatever you do, don't let
'em take away your anger.
I'm really not that angry.
I'm just a kook who gets annoyed by mothers pimping out their children.
No, anger is good.
Anger in all of its form has marked the upward surge of mankind.
And anger, mark my words, will save not only
Mercy Hospital nut that other malfunctioning organism, you.
What?
Wall Street.
What do you want?
With the camera here,
I was hoping maybe you could, you know, take a swing at me.
I need a little help here, someone!
Oh. Oh!
I like her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay.
Let's not fall asleep here, sir.
Under the arm.
Use your back.
All right.
Ooh.
So...
Okay.
The board and legal are meeting later to discuss the incident.
I wish everyone was as tired of talking about this as I am.
You're on light clinical duty.
If you say what you're thinking,
I'll have you doing quality assurance chart reviews.
Big guy goes in 510.
Let's get him back to bed.
Hey, thanks for your help.
I have to say I feel a little responsible for your predicament.
Why?
Because...
I'm the one who thought jumping back into work after the shooting would be good for you.
It was a horrible, shocking situation...
And I lost it.
All right.
Call this ptsd specialist.
If I can tell the brass you're seeking help, it might make you look better.
Don't kid yourself.
Forget about losing the job.
If that piece of trash presses charges, you could go to jail.
Call the head-shrinker.
Seriously, the woman looked like she'd been attacked by a bear.
God. You're kidding.
That is rough.
Hey.
What are y'all doing in the nurses' lounge?
We're just hearing about last night.
Yeah, what happened last night?
Veronica didn't tell you?
Didn't tell me what?
Uh, well, let's just say that your girlfriend has got a bit of a short fuse.
Don't eat the last pop tart.
I didn't really break my hip, did I?
No, you have a hairline pubic ramus fracture.
Do you see this little bone here?
It's the least serious kind of pelvic fracture.
It usually takes four to six weeks to heal properly.
The Boston Marathon is in 33 days and I'm going to break
3 1/2 hours or I'll be laughed out of my own office.
Well, I wouldn't book a plane ticket.
I can't guarantee you'll be ready.
Yeah, I want to take him to an optimists anonymous meeting.
You are too positive for your own good.
You're not the first person to say that.
So look, Brooke, your EKG and chest X-ray are basically normal, so your heart and lungs are okay.
Still a little tachycardic.
Your heart's beating a little fast from dehydration.
Which is why you can't go home.
You have to work with this pill every day?
Yep.
Are you a runner?
You look like a runner.
No, I'm not.
I'm not a runner.
I mean, I run sometimes.
How is the dizziness?
All right, I guess.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
You were hit by a car three days ago.
Why didn't you come in then?
I was grazed.
You must have a pretty high pain threshold.
Pain is in the mind.
What is in this bag?
Sterile water with salt and sugar.
Really?
I've been off sugar for six months.
Is this absolutely necessary?
Yeah.
Did you see the lanugo on her arms?
Exercise freak all concerned about the dextrose in her iv.
That's anorexia.
Yeah, I'll order a psych consult.
Look, Dan, I lost it.
Can we please just move past this?
No.
We can't move past this.
You're dangerous.
You're reckless.
You refuse to acknowledge your behavior or take care of yourself.
Okay.
So now we're gonna go back to hating each other?
No, Veronica.
I'm just gonna go back to work.
I checked your X-ray, and they call this a boxer's fracture.
It's a break of the fifth metacarpal, which is the bone between the big knuckle and the wrist.
Yeah, so stop hitting people.
Yeah, I've been telling him that for years.
Let's go, let's go, quick.
Is this really necessary?
Heard there was some action down here.
Uh, just a st. Paddy's day brawl.
Some broken bones and split lips.
Sorry.
Hey, Bob, Larry, look at this.
Must be some reality show or something.
All right, here we go.
Hi.
Yeah.
Ow!
It's just a shot, you baby.
You're freaking orange.
Why do you paint your body anyway?
Shut up, you polka-dotted bitch.
What'd you just call me?
Can you get the cameras out of here?
It's like catnip for morons.
You're much too close to me.
You hear that?
She's talking about you, guido.
What'd you say, bro?
Larry...
Eat me, juicehead!
Bring it, you little ginger prince.
Larry?
Come on.
Boot and rally, Larry.
Larry?
Larry?
Pulse is weak and thready.
Come around.
I need a liter of saline.
Tombstones on the monitor.
St segment elevation.
He's having a heart attack.
What? Oh, my God!
How does a kid his age have an mi?
Cocaine. Anyone?
Oh, my God.
On my count.
One, two, three.
All right, clock is ticking, people.
Fasten your seatbelts.
It's about to get real.
Hey.
Hi.
Do you want to come down to radiology with me?
I want to put your head under an X-ray.
Find out what the hell's going on in there.
Oh, you heard about the thing.
Yeah. I heard about the thing, yeah.
Just now from a whole bunch of people who weren't you.
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.
Sure you were.
Well, I--
We were just so happy and cozy last night.
I didn't want to ruin the mood.
Oh, so you'd rather just drink a bottle of wine,
Scarf down some beef wellington,
And not mention anything?
Yeah.
That is so weird.
Is it?
Honey, it's two blocks past weird.
If I gave you
$1 million, would you call the therapist?
How do you know about the therapist?
Am I the only one around here who can keep my mouth shut?
Veronica, let's get some dinner tonight
And just talk about what's going on.
Please make the call.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Oh, crap!
It's St. Patrick's Day.
So?
Veronica Agnes
Flanagan Callahan?
You can't actually get more
Irish than that without being a leprechaun.
Don't leprechauns eat?
It's just, my family, we go to this street festival every year.
It's tradition.
Okay, wait.
I got it.
I'll do a quick drive-by, say "hi" to the fam,
Check in with my heritage, and then fully engage in some intimacy with you.
How does that sound?
Sounds like a plan.
Good.
Guide catheters in position.
Give me a puff.
What are we looking at,
Dr. Briggs?
Clot in the L.A.D.
I call this "the widow maker."
The main vessel which carries oxygen to the heart is completely clotted off.
Excuse me.
I've got ectopy on the monitor.
Dr. Briggs, do you want me to draw up some lidocaine?
No, I'm about to fix all that... by passing a thin metal wire through the clot.
Is he awake?
No, he's deeply sedated.
Kind of like your crew.
Sorry, dude.
Another mig of versed?
Yeah, go for it.
42 minutes since he collapsed.
Dr. Briggs, you promised us 45.
Yes, I did.
Let's try something else.
Let's try the Fishbein view.
Right.
Got it.
Okay, here we go.
Wire passing.
Excellent.
I'm passing a balloon catheter with a collapsed wire stent on it.
It'll crush the clot, deploy the stent, and keep the artery wide open.
Perfect.
Wow.
44 minutes. Not bad.
You guys can take a break, grab some lunch.
You can talk to Larry when he wakes up in recovery.
Thanks.
We got some great stuff.
I'll get his vitals.
With increased contractility, his pressure should be up.
All right, let's go.
I need an intra-aortic pump now!
Give me a short soft-tipped oh-one-four wire and intravascular ultrasound.
Why? We're done.
Yeah, no, we're not.
Let's go.
The clot is progressing.
But you opened the artery.
No, that was video playback from last week.
Milton Fishbein's cath.
Oh, God, Payne, don't give me the bible-y eyes.
Run of eight.
300 amiodarone.
Glove up and prep the left groin, Chloe.
Veronica, come see this.
Whoa, Brooke.
What are you doing?
Just getting a little exercise, so when I want to go to Costa Rica over Easter, my boyfriend does not throw up when he sees my legs.
Okay, then let's wrap this up.
Ugh!
Just calm down.
I'm almost done.
Just five more minutes.
Oh, my God.
No, this is not a discussion.
I want you to get back in bed before you--
Ahh!
Go get some help.
My leg. I can't--
I can't move it!
Keep still.
We're going to take care of you.
What is this, a cement clot?
You could have asked them to leave.
You didn't have to fake a whole show.
I had to get them out of the room.
They were slowing us down.
Looks like the wire passed.
Don't take the bait.
We could be subintimal.
Volcano cath.
I'm trying to put some polish on this dingy little flop house.
Polish?
Thought it was about medicine.
That's adorable.
It's about pr.
Had to make it look effortless so that when people see us
On TV, they think,
"hey, you know,
"I need a cutting-edge heart procedure.
"maybe I should jump in my Range Rover
"with my big bag of money and drive over the river to Mercy."
Damn, it's all thrombus.
V-tach.
200 joules now.
I got it.
No.
I want you to stay with me on this side of the table.
Clear.
Sinus.
Amio at 70 a minute.
Okay, Chloe,
I want you to advance my catheter one inch.
Me?
Wha--are you sure?
All you have to do is push.
I'm sure you've heard this before... but be gentle.
There we go.
Feel a little resistance?
That's okay.
Steady.
I'm feeling it.
Uh-huh.
I think it moved.
You just pushed a catheter through a blood clot to save a man's life.
Ready to inflate.
That was incredible.
Okay.
Let's wrap this up.
Deflate the catheter.
Cycle the dynamap, send a troponin now,
And q six hours.
I'll take the ivus again.
Oh, I'm gonna get--
Whoo!
So how'd it go with Klowden today?
She wants me to see a therapist and I'm on probation, but I figure I keep my act together and I'll be fine.
Ah-ha-ha!
I'll be fine.
Okay, so did you put in an early warning system for those emotional tsunamis that you're prone to?
Ooh, ouch.
What do you mean,
"emotional tsunamis"?
You have to ask?
Does this mean you're gonna be on my ass too?
Because my ass is totally crowded.
There is no room for you on my ass.
Last place I want to be.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
You working?
No, just meeting some buddies.
Everything good?
Yeah, great.
Listen,
I actually gotta run.
Yeah, no, me too.
All right.
Yeah.
Bye.
How did that go?
It sucked.
And life's a bitch.
So am I.
I really burned that bridge.
Hmm, you just made a mistake.
Granted, it was a naked mistake.
You just have to impress upon him that nakedness is a two-way street.
Ooh, I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm drunk.
You made it through your first run-in.
Have a bear.
Well done.
You did good.
I did.
Hey, Ronnie!
Hey, dad.
Happy St. Pat's!
Thanks, dad.
Oh, happy St. Pat's, honey.
Oh, my God.
What's up, Flanagans?
You guys getting into trouble?
Nah, just the usual.
They're playing ring around the shamrock down the block.
You want in?
Oh, I don't even know what that is.
It's free beer.
Come on.
Okay.
Hey, Ronnie.
Ronnie, come on, dance with me.
Come on.
Dance with me, honey.
I just came to say hi.
No, I can't.
I have to meet Chris.
What? Boo!
Invite your boyfriend down here to celebrate.
Huh, what is he, afraid to have a few beers on St. Paddy's Day?
Hey, hey, hey, ignore them.
Say no to drunken debauchery and yes to your relationship.
Oh, that is so weak.
He doesn't want to have a drink on St. Patrick's Day?
What is he, racist?
We're supposed to talk.
Well, that's what you get for dating a guy who's not Irish.
Your wife is Jewish, Tim.
Let's go inside.
I'm freezing my pills off.
Tell your lame-ass boyfriend to come down here.
It's fun.
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Hey, I'm leaving in a bit.
Where do you want to grab dinner?
Actually can you come meet me here?
My family wants to hang out with you.
No, they don't.
They hate me.
No, they don't hate you.
Your brothers literally tried to kick my ass.
Okay, well,
St. Paddy's Day loophole.
For these 24 hours, all non-irish men fornicating with Irish daughters are forgiven.
Please just come down here and have a beer and then we can go get dinner someplace and talk.
Put some green on and get your pale ass down here now!
You--I--
Hey, man!
Here. Catch up.
Check it.
Flanagans versus the Doherty family.
Bunch of poseurs.
Come on, Ronnie!
Kill!
Ah!
Yes!
Hi! Hey!
Oh, you made it.
Uh, hey, happy St. Patrick's day, Mr. Flanagan.
Yeah, let me get a drink and I'll come back and tell you all about how the Irish saved civilization.
I'm glad you came.
Where's Sonia and Chloe?
Sonia went home.
Bobby's been chasing
Chloe around like a little puppy somewhere.
I don't know.
You having fun?
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.
I didn't call that therapist today.
But I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
Okay, great.
Listen, I need to catch up.
You got to give me a shot.
Mm-hmm!
Oh, my God!
Pat O'Donnell's doing the beer-drinking contest!
Ooh, I'll be right back.
Yes!
Hey, Mike.
Hey.
Hey, happy saint, uh-- yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, um, tequila.
The good stuff.
All right, contestants, get ready.
Grab your beer.
I got this.
Don't mess with me.
I will take you down.
I will crush you.
You need a head start, little girl?
Not from you, lightweight.
So Veronica seems great.
She's an example of moderate appetites.
Looks like your love just healed her right up, big fella.
Two, three, drink!
You should bottle that love, since it cures mental problems.
I mean, at first,
I was skeptical, but I am a believer now.
I get your point.
Thank you, Mike.
Loser!
Yes.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Hey, watch out!
Yo, your arm! Your arm!
You're on fire!
Here.
Put your girlfriend out.
She's on fire.
Totally cool.
I'm okay.
I'm worried about my girl.
Thanks for coming over, guys.
I'm really worried.
She's not herself.
She's drinking a lot.
I see that now that I'm at the bar all the time.
It's the perfect storm with the ptsd and the donut shop and your illness, Jim.
Yeah.
Talking about your sister.
She's gonna love that.
Why didn't you come home last night?
You're a grown man sleeping at your mom's house.
What's all this about?
Why are you guys sitting around in a circle?
I only drink socially!
Come on.
We're talking about Ronnie.
Can anyone tell me what I'm doing here?
Hey, Chloe.
How you feeling?
You sleep okay?
Oh, God.
You want a cup of coffee, sweetheart?
Where is Veronica anyway?
She's at my house.
She got really wasted, so she'll be in bed for hours.
Mom!
Mom, have you seen my--
The--
What's going on?
Is this an intervention?
What? No, no.
It's not an intervention.
You're all sitting in a circle.
You're looking at me.
This is an intervention.
Hey, defensive, circle doesn't mean intervention.
Circles happen for plenty of other reasons.
Like that dance at Jewish weddings.
What's it called, Heather?
The hora.
But since you're here,
Veronica... look, we're all just a little concerned about you.
Since when do you two even talk to each other anyway?
Should I get some beers, anybody?
A little hair of the dog.
This is kind of Ronnie's thing.
Uh, what do you want beverage-wise?
Guys, guys, can we not do the refreshments?
Excuse me.
Does anyone know where my clothes are?
Okay, I'll start.
What's really tough fo is having to sit here and look at poor Mike in the co-pilot seat while Dr. Big stuff here drives the boat.
Okay, what the hell did she actually do that was so terrible?
She shot an armed robber.
She beat up some skel who pimped out her kid.
Thank you, Heather.
It's not those things.
It's how you're dealing with them.
But while we're here, can we shed some light on something that is serious like, say,
Timmy's porn addiction?
Oh!
Whew!
What the hell are you doing on my computer?
Dude, you got to erase the history.
He is a chronic masturbator and it is ruining our marriage.
Well, I have got to have sex with somebody, Heather.
You have to have sex with somebody?
Did I or did I not have blackout sex with Bobby Flanagan or any other
Flanagan last night?
No, nothing happened.
I made a little pillow barricade.
God.
Hey, guys. What's up?
What's everybody--
Whoa!
No, I do not have a problem, okay?
Dude, dude, what the hell happened to you?
This is ridiculous.
Ronnie?
Ronnie, please.
Listen to me.
Your mother and I--
Your mother and
I had three boys and then we had you.
Oh, your mother was so happy and I--
I was so scared.
But the minute I saw you, you were my little princess. and I tried so hard to never let anything bad happen to you.
And it's been so rough for you, sweetie.
Dad--
You walk around late at night.
You jump when I say your name.
You're drinking too damn much.
You're at sea.
Don't say you're not.
I'd give everything I got to take the load off your shoulder, but I can't.
I don't know how to help you.
And, um...
It's breaking my heart.
I gotta go to work.
Hey, Veronica.
Hi, Dr. Waters.
Just talked to Brooke Sullivan.
Stairmaster?
How's she doing?
Well, she doesn't meet criteria for a psych hold.
Not that that matters,
'cause she ain't going anywhere.
I offered her voluntary inpatient treatment.
She refused, but she did sign a contract with me to eat more and have outpatient therapy.
I gave her my opinion.
It's probably 1 of 100 that she's heard in the past few years.
We'll see.
You sound cynical.
Well, you're the one that called her "stairmaster."
You know, these people are pretty good at telling you what you want to hear.
I know you probably can't handle another person coming in here and getting in your face with the truth, so I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe some of us are always gonna be a little too little or a little too much.
And I'm not gonna tell you
I'm not worried about you.
I hope you start to take care of yourself.
But right now, I'm just here to be your nurse.
So how's your pain?
You're eating.
That's great.
I was hungry.
Good.
Plus I just got dumped.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He said he couldn't deal with the drama anymore.
I was a fat kid, you know.
I mean, I've been on and off antidepressants since I was ten.
And I guess I'm just a little obsessed with not going back to that.
Anyway, I'm gonna try.
Eat a little more.
Moderate the exercise.
See if I can find a little-- balance.
Right.
Hello, Brooke.
This is Dr. Sands.
Hi.
He's going to talk to you about your hip.
So, Brooke, when you fell, the ball of the joint blasted through the socket.
It's called an acetabular fracture.
The socket fractured into multiple pieces.
Multiple?
At least ten.
We're going to have to operate to put the pieces back together using plates, screws, wire.
Okay, how soon can we do it?
Well, you're too anemic for surgery now.
You'll need two blood transfusions.
It's gonna be a little rough, Brooke.
You're gonna be three months on crutches.
And if all goes well, you can be active again after a year.
A year?
Okay.
I can do that.
So he ignores me all through high school.
They always do.
Right?
So then the year after graduation,
I was getting a slurpee at the "sevs" in that mini-mall with the Hilfiger Outlet and he sees me with these.
He still didn't ask me out, but now I'm on his radar.
Hey, babe.
How are you?
Come on, you were always on my radar.
All right, the blips, now they just got a little bigger, you know what I mean?
All right, how we doing in here?
So anyways, like, a week later at the club, he accidentally shoved me down the stairs.
But I was okay except for a concussion.
But that was it.
I've been taking care of him ever since.
Sounds just like The Notebook.
All right, femoral site looks good.
No hematoma.
Yeah, it's itching like crazy, doc.
Did you really have to shave me?
You should be grateful,
Lar.
You had 13 days sober under your belt and you let that bitch Gina give you blow?
Um, Lar?
Oh, my God.
Systolic's 80.
Excuse me.
Saline on a pressure bag.
Show me the 12-lead.
I need ultrasound in here now.
Larry? Larry?
What's going on?
Is having another heart attack?
Did he clot off his stent?
No, heart's completely normal.
It's something else.
Decreased bowel sounds.
Let's go.
Jelly on the belly.
Come on.
Do you want dopamine?
No.
I want two units of blood from the bank.
He's bleeding like crazy from his liver.
Oh, my God.
Did we nick it with the catheter?
No, it was nowhere near the liver.
Could be cysts.
Barb, is he a juicer?
'cause I'm thinking steroid use here, am I right?
Tell him, Barb!
Yeah.
Put him in trendelenburg.
Hold an O.R. and page Sands.
So I've never seen a case of peliosis hepatis before.
Yeah, it's spontaneous hemorrhaging from blood-filled cysts in the liver.
And it's associated with anabolic steroid use?
Definitely.
Hey, slasher?
Make sure this kid lives, okay?
I'm batting a thousand here at Mercy,
So don't ruin my average.
What an ass.
Good in bed though.
What are you doing here?
I knew you'd be having lunch here.
Do you have a sec?
Give me a sec, guys.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Except seeing you last night kind of killed me.
I miss you so much, Nick.
Sonia, come on.
Do you know that
I would give anything to go back and have dinner with you on Valentine's Day?
I'm so sorry.
I was scared and stupid and selfish... and I lost the best thing that ever happened to me.
Come on.
I have to know.
Would you ever consider getting back together?
Sone...
I appreciate everything you just said.
Really.
And I know how hard it was for you to say it,
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
Well, hey, can't we just get a drink and talk about it?
Took care of the check,
Nick.
Let's go chase some bad guys.
I got a new partner and new shifts.
Hey, change can be good, right?
I'll see you.
Hey.
Great news.
Larry made it through surgery without a hitch.
Sands fixed his liver and those hemorrhagic cysts will go away as long as he stays away from the steroids.
Right there.
Right... there.
How many times are you gonna do that?
Until I catch all my mistakes.
What mistakes?
You fixed that guy in, like,
75 minutes.
That's--that's way faster than the national standard.
My father died of an mi in the waiting room of a mediocre hospital.
He was a good guy.
Made me want to revolutionize cardiac care and what happened yesterday was not revolutionary, Chloe.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
It's not your fault.
Obviously I'm not responsible for your father's death.
I was just saying
I'm sorry for your loss.
Well, as fascinating as your feelings about my losses are,
I really need to figure out what the hell took so long, so if you don't mind.
Not at all.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry about that accidental intervention today.
That was a train wreck.
No, I get it.
Things have been a little rough lately.
I can see where you might be concerned.
I love you.
I was just worried about you, that's all.
I love you too.
I guess I just feel like if we're together, everything's going to be okay.
Well, we were together last night and you set yourself on fire.
Yeah.
Well, it's not
St. Patrick's Day till somebody lights themselves on fire, right?
I guess so.
Does it have to be you?
Never again. I swear.
See you at my place later?
Yeah.
Hey, could you give these to Brooke Sullivan?
It's info on support groups in the area.
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Help me get this door open.
Brooke?
Oh, my God.
Help! Brooke!
Brooke? Help!
Help!
I need some help in here!
Help me cut her down!
How the hell did she do that?
Call for intubation!
She was in traction.
She's setting well at 50% oxygen.
Good.
No spontaneous eye-opening,
But she does withdraw to painful stimuli.
That's encouraging.
Well, we'll have to wait and see how much neurological function returns.
I thought she was okay.
She told me she was gonna try.
Yeah.
It's really frustrating.
Hi.
Hi.
What can I get for you?
Scotch on the rocks.
Please.
Sure.
There you are.
Thank you.
Let's see what we have here.
Okay, wound is clean and dry.
Xeroform and a fresh abd.
Larry, I was so worried about you.
How are you feeling?
I'm a little muffed up from the pain medication,
But I'm okay.
I'm so sorry, Larry.
I never should have let you take all those steroids.
No, that's not your job, okay?
I gotta make some lifestyle changes.
I know.
Listen, Lar.
You don't need to be all juiced up for me.
I mean, I love the fact that I can put my arms all the way around you.
Oh, baby, you're so good to me.
Well, you're my flower.
Your what?
My flower.
See, I was watching
Dr. Phil before and he says that in every relationship, there's a flower and there's a gardener.
And you're my flower.
Oh, baby, come here.
And I'm your gardener.
Come here. Come here.
Mm.
So you and Briggs, huh?
That's none of your business.
I'm over us okay, Chris?
Gillian, wait.
I know, but--
Look, I'm sorry about the way everything went down.
Yeah, well, you should be.
'cause with me, you would have been the flower, and now you're the gardener and you have a lot of weeds to pull.
Here you are.
Thanks.
What are you drinking?
Scotch.
I really got to switch to that color.
Why is that?
This is what my parents drank and they're alcoholics.
Help you sleep at night?
Yeah.
I get it.
What keeps you awake?
This, you know?
I can't--
I can't turn it off.
Same stuff over and over.
What kind of stuff?
You ask a lot of questions, lady.
You don't want to talk about it?
God, everyone in my life just keeps wanting me to talk about everything, but they really don't want to know.
Trust me.
'cause if you told them, they'll think you're crazy?
Everybody already thinks
I'm crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
Maybe.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that I just want everybody to shut up and leave me alone.
I just want to be left alone.
But not?
Right?
But not.
Because when I'm alone, it's worse.
Welcome to the human race.
It's been great talking to you, Veronica.
I'm really glad you called.
But next time, let's meet in my office, okay?

He looked like a turkey!
A turkey with a green tie.
You're pretty when you laugh.
Like a little girl.
A drink perhaps?
With pleasure.
We're stopping?
A break.
We deserve it, don't we?
That's good.
We just need a killer idea to clinch the deal.
You leave tomorrow.
We still have time.
If we can't think of one,
I'll improvise.
You smell good.
What's your perfume?
I don't wear any.
Not all the time.
Not tonight.
You should.
Relax, Isa.
Your shoulders are knotted.
Can I call you Isa?
No, actually.
Isabelle suits you better.
I know a masseur who works magic.
I'll give you his number.
Bordeaux?
That's fine.
I run at the gym. On a treadmill.
Running blanks everything out.
I forget myself.
It's beautiful here.
Everything's beautiful.
A touch obsessive?
A little.
Conscientious, intelligent, precise.
Precious.
We make a good team.
I'm pleased.
I'm pleased, too.
Your scarf's gorgeous.
It's yours.
No, Christine.
I can't accept it.
Of course you can.
Don't be silly.
It's perfect on you.
It smells of you.
To us!
If you like...
To us!
Why do you need to forget yourself?
You don't have to answer.
Back to work?
Christine?
Yes?
Isabelle...
Two busy little bees.
Am I interrupting?
I'll come back later if you want.
Evening, Isabelle.
Good evening, Philippe.
Don't worry,
I'll finish it later.
I have all night.
The front door's locked.
You mind going out the back?
No.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Goodnight, Philippe.
Daniel?
This is Isabelle.
Sorry to call late.
I'm prepping Christine's Cairo meeting and I had an idea that could seal the deal.
Remember last year, how we won the Philippines soda contract by bringing in local subcontractors?
Morning, ma'am.
Morning, Jacques.
This weekend?
No, bad timing.
I have a meeting in Cairo.
Promises, promises.
Leave it with me.
I'll call you back.
I found the man for the job.
The go-to guy for a dozen food industry subcontractors.
Daniel, it'll work.
He's a political big wheel.
Christine can contact him.
I won't tell her, so she finds out on the plane.
Great idea.
You've gift-wrapped it for her again.
Gift-wrapped it?
It won't be the first contract she wins thanks to you.
Her, me, same difference.
And a complete list of anyone skimming some off.
That's a long list.
Precisely. Time to clean up.
What?
What's scaring you?
Excuse me...
Come in.
We're done.
Puffy eyes. Get any sleep?
A bit.
Our proposal.
I finished it last night.
I think it flies.
You can read it on the plane.
No.
Why not?
You're going to Cairo.
You know the brief.
You'll do a great job.
Honestly?
Honestly.
Thanks, Christine.
Thank you.
You just have time to pack.
Wait!
You should do something with your hair.
Let's see it down.
Keep it up.
You're perfect.
Hurry, you'll miss your flight.
Philippe's at the airport.
I asked him to go with you.
His firm worked on this and he knows Cairo.
Cairo
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Good job!
Involving the local subcontractors...
Smart move.
Christine's idea?
No, mine.
It occurred to me last night after...
I planned to surprise her.
I'd better call Christine.
Now it's a done deal.
We can fly out tomorrow morning.
Why tomorrow?
Don't you deserve a day off?
Cairo's a beautiful city.
Okay.
We'll stay on.
Well?
When does our tour start?
Right now!
You planned to surprise me, right?
You're shocked?
Me claiming your idea as my own.
You'd have done the same.
At least I hope so.
Want it and watch out.
At all times.
I wanted New York, but I couldn't count on it.
Thanks to you,
I'll grab my chance.
Grab your chance.
Heard of that?
It's not a betrayal.
It's teamwork.
I believe in you.
You have real talent.
I made the most of it.
Thanks.
So, how was Cairo?
Beautiful, huh?
And with Philippe.
Even more beautiful?
I heard about Washington and Cairo.
Sorry, it's plain wrong.
What's ''wrong''?
Christine fast-tracked to the top, thanks to you.
So what?
It's great.
Good teamwork means we all win out.
I succeed if she does.
We complement each other perfectly.
Here...
Take a look.
Market research the Americans asked for.
A new grain-based food product.
Real potential.
Could take off.
Christine doesn't need to know.
Not yet, at least.
I'm abducting you.
Pick you up in five minutes.
Yes, Christine. Fine.
I bet you were a secretive little girl.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Sure. Like you are now.
A real little sphinx.
You know,
I can read sphinxes' minds.
And what do you see?
You didn't like yourself much.
I wanted to be loved.
I wanted to be admired.
It's now I want to be loved.
There's a lipstick in my purse.
Try it.
It'll highlight your eyes.
Perfect.
So? Beautiful, aren't we?
Come on.
I'll teach you to work a room.
It's not your strong point.
But it's very useful.
No, the worst is Siberia.
Unbelievable!
You remember Siberia?
Yes.
That stuff about a shaman in Siberia, it isn't true?
Never been there. Too cold!
And that fat guy listening with his mouth gaping like a dead fish.
800 employees.
600 million in turnover.
The kind of fish I like.
I'll call him next week.
Your turn now.
- My turn?
- See that guy?
Bald, nose in his glass.
That's no fish, that's a shark.
He's bored stupid.
Reel him in.
I don't know how.
I'm not like you,
I can't make up stories.
And I've been drinking.
Good.
Ask him about himself.
Men love that.
Quick touch-up.
Perfect.
Surprise!
Jacques!
Can't get enough of each other.
Awesome!
Same again next weekend?
My helicopter's ready when you are.
My chopper and all that comes with it.
No Cairo chore to get out of?
How about Corsica?
What?
No little trooper to send into battle?
Just a second.
I'll be going.
I have a headache.
You're way off. It's not that.
It's not what?
You think that Cairo was because it suited me.
You're wrong.
I sent you to take my place because I trust you.
What I got up to doesn't matter.
What does that change?
Stay.
I feel woozy.
I'll call a cab.
Go ahead.
No kiss?
Did Christine ever come to yours?
Ever come here?
You sure you want to talk about her?
What's it like with her?
It turns you on.
You surprise me.
What's it like?
She thinks only of herself.
In bed, too.
She knows. You told her?
Cut it out!
Forget Christine.
She wanted it.
You can't get enough.
Not with you.
What's she like when you make her come?
I think that's about it.
Any questions?
I got a memo from head office.
Market research that Washington sent.
You have it?
It's a pretty vague project so far, on the back burner.
Keep me in the loop.
Of course.
That's all. Thanks, everybody.
Do you have a minute?
Yes.
My scarf suits you.
I'm glad to see you wearing it.
You're mad at me about Cairo.
- No.
- You are.
You're mad at me.
And I can't stand it.
I love you, Isabelle.
I really love you.
And you?
Me too. You know that.
No, I don't know that.
You think I never have doubts?
I need to be told,
I need to hear it.
I opened up to you in the car.
I never told anyone that.
I shouldn't have.
You see?
You can't bring yourself to tell me, I love you.
I love you, Christine.
Come in, Philippe.
You asked for me.
Here I am.
You're both very complicated.
Back to business then.
Leave us, please.
I need a word with Philippe.
So...
How do you intend to make amends for your financial chicanery?
I told you.
Give me 2-3 months to balance up and everything's dandy.
You have 1 week, max.
You're insane!
That's impossible.
I said I'd cover you for a limited period.
Time's running out.
Washington's sniffing around.
I refuse to be exposed.
Hold on...
My firm's worked for you so long, where's the trust?
I prepared an annex, dated today.
I'll add it to the report.
You can read it if you want.
I need to protect myself.
If anyone reads this, I'm dead.
Pay it back and I tear it up.
Don't do this to me.
You think I'm stupid.
Philippe, I need to see you...
You know I have a mole in Washington...
Yes, and?
He told me the new product will be okayed next week.
If we start work, discreetly, we'll be ready for the green light.
This time,
Washington will know who did what.
We'll see.
... before you go.
Call me. Isa.
Send.
Fuck it!
You didn't get my text?
Sure I did.
This isn't a good time, see?
A good time for what?
I have problems.
Big problems.
Tell me.
I'm here.
I can help you.
Listen...
We've got to stop.
Stop what?
Us.
You and me. Stop.
It's best.
Is it Christine?
- She wants us to stop?
- It's not Christine.
I don't believe you.
I'm sure it's Christine.
- Tell me...
- You don't get it!
She doesn't care about us!
Get it?
She doesn't give a damn!
We don't exist for her.
You don't...
I don't!
This new product, great potential.
I've had some ideas.
I'm sure you have.
I did the last checks.
It'll be in Washington when they arrive.
48 hours before
Christine's activity report.
Well done, darling, it's great.
You know my taste.
It's not too noisy?
You're sure?
How much again?
New York's so expensive.
I'll take it.
Happy?
Sure, I'm happy.
Over there, it's only 3 pm.
Give them time to read it.
First set... to us!
They basically like it, want to test our sources and move very, very fast.
It's all good.
Daniel?
Yes?
The report...
I can't not mention it to Christine.
Before it's too late.
You know what she'll do.
Same as always.
Look...
That's how it is.
I can't change it.
I'll tell her tomorrow.
Pity.
Christine Riviere's voicemail.
Leave a message after the beep.
Why, Isabelle?
You were in the loop.
You never asked about it.
It all went so fast.
I was going to tell you today.
I called you last night.
They beat me to it.
Answer my question.
Why?
Why what?
''Want it and watch out.''
I listened to you.
I observed you.
I learned to act like you.
You learned nothing.
You don't get it.
You've ruined everything.
You ruined everything.
There we are.
The answer to my question.
Yes?
It's me.
You were right.
It's Christine.
She forced me to break up.
She forced you?
Yes, forced.
She frightens me.
I'm not ashamed to admit it.
She enjoys playing with you, destroying you.
She did it with me.
You too now.
I want to see you, Isa.
I need you.
I want to be with you.
If you want me.
I don't know.
I don't know if I do.
I need you.
To love you.
Tonight?
I'll pick you up if you want.
Late. Around 8 pm.
Okay?
Isa?
Okay.
Tonight at 8. Here.
No, it's not Philippe. It's me.
The woman who plays with you, destroys you.
Nice line, huh?
I have to say, with you it's easy.
Poor Isabelle, all dressed up, I bet.
Only wants to be loved.
Perfume tonight?
Just a bit too much.
Go home now.
What happens now is up to you.
Nobody's irreplaceable.
- Thursday at 8.
- That should be fine.
Next week, I'm in Germany.
- With Bertrand?
- Yes, Bertrand.
Meeting the Czechs.
When are you back?
Wednesday evening.
What a little trooper!
Sorry to interrupt.
I've noticed something weird.
Looking through the files of an operation earlier this year,
I saw a massive difference between the actual budget and Philippe Deschamps' firm's estimate.
Maybe it's just an accounting ploy.
What's weird is that Christine just added an annex, a kind of ultimatum, covering herself against Philippe.
Are you okay?
You get the message?
Christine's organized a party for all senior execs.
Saturday night.
Yes, I know, but it'll look bad not to be there.
My friends!
We've prepared a surprise.
For your amusement, I hope.
A quick documentary.
A life lesson, if you like.
The theme is, executives and their toys, heartbreak and pleasure.
Here we see the executive trying to save the toy.
A proper little Good Samaritan.
Before joining the firm, you wanted to be a doctor?
- Yes.
- I read it in your file.
The marital crisis.
We've all been there.
Just forgive and forget.
Isabelle talks to the elevator.
Isabelle doesn't like her parking.
Isabelle tries to out-scream her alarm.
Isabelle argues with a concrete pillar.
You can't win every time.
Know your limits.
It's just a laugh.
Show us your sense of humour.
Like the others.
Isabelle the tragic heroine.
I see why you need to forget yourself.
Stick to the treadmill.
The real Isabelle is in that car park.
The other one doesn't exist.
It was just a bad act.
She had me fooled a moment, but I was wrong.
Get over it.
You were born that way.
Hurry, Christine brought forward the Monday heads-up.
It's started.
Coming.
I need a word.
Take a seat.
I'll never forget what you did.
I'll make you pay one way or another.
- I didn't write this.
- It came from your computer?
I didn't write it.
After your reaction Saturday evening, who else would write such grotesque threats?
I didn't write it, period.
The first lapse, the first slip-up in your work, and I will use it to fire you.
Got it?
Go on.
This is Isabelle Guerin.
Could I speak to Dr. Fabre, please?
Pierre?
This is Isabelle.
Can I come by?
I'll be right there.
Daniel?
The file you mentioned with Philippe Deschamps' budget estimate...
- You still have it?
- Yes.
Thanks.
Here...
Don't archive it just yet.
Hold onto it.
Sure.
Christine wants you.
For the Japanese deal.
They want a souvenir photo with our two top execs.
You know what they're like.
Tell her I'm coming.
What are you doing?
Taking the train?
Where's your car?
Repairs.
This is stupid, it's pouring.
I'll drop you at the office.
Look...
One day, I'll explain.
I know it was unforgiveable.
But I was in a bind.
You have no idea.
Did I leave my scarf at yours?
No, I'd have seen it.
I must have lost it. Shoot.
- She's popping pills now?
- Yeah.
And that stuff's poison.
I thought she was tough but...
You remember her predecessor?
Elena?
Know where she wound up?
Mental hospital.
Nervous breakdown.
My place, Saturday.
A dozen of us, no more.
I look forward to it.
Hi, sweets.
Hey, sis.
That was fast.
Barely 90 minutes.
Your hair looks good.
Claudine, I missed you.
It's great to see you, the house and everything.
You're so heavy!
I'm top of the class in French and Art.
Why don't you ever visit?
Your aunt works even harder than you.
Come on in.
You're a real kitty-cat.
Do you purr?
Denis is at work?
He gets home soon.
Can you wait for dinner?
Sure. I have plenty of time.
Really?
Something's going down.
In my car, on the backseat, there's a big parcel.
Can you get it?
Quickly!
Upstairs?
She's a wonderful little girl.
I like picturing her here, in my room.
It feels so good.
Are you happy with Denis?
I'm very happy.
What about you?
Same old. Always ends badly.
Last time was the worst.
So embarrassing.
I could have died.
I mess up.
I mess up every time.
A nice little husband... a nice little girl... a nice little life...
Maybe I'm not cut out for it.
Sorry...
I didn't mean it like that.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
All three of us love you.
Tell me. What's wrong?
No money, please.
You give us enough already.
It's not that.
Can you do something for me?
But you have to swear never to tell anyone. Ever.
You asking me for help for once...
I swear.
- I told you, the Americans...
- Bullshit! That's not it.
All clean and tidy.
If that's all...
That's great, Eliane. Thank you.
Goodnight.
See you Monday.
No more, okay!
- Cut the crap!
- Enough!
Daniel?
I don't feel well.
I won't be in today.
Why? What do they want?
Really?
Is it serious?
I'll touch base later.
I need to get some sleep.
Don't call me.
Miss Isabelle Guerin?
Yes.
May I?
Yes.
Are you okay?
No.
I just took some sleeping pills.
I haven't slept.
You know Christine Riviere has been killed?
Stabbed 3 times.
Her house, Saturday night.
I didn't know.
You weren't on good terms,
I believe?
Work issues.
And there was a party last week...
Why aren't you at work today?
I don't feel well.
I'm sleeping badly.
Serious shit!
You take many of these?
Right now, yes.
You have to come with us.
- Why?
- Please.
Get dressed.
We'll help you.
Thank you.
These threats came from your computer.
Your relationship with the victim was very tense.
Recently, she completely humiliated you in public.
Didn't she?
The victim managed to write ''Isa'' with her own blood.
Earlier, you seemed to be hiding scratches on your arm.
Lastly, she was clutching a scrap of fabric that seems to be from an identical scarf to the one you're wearing here.
Now, I have a question for you.
A very important question.
Listen and think carefully before replying.
Where were you Saturday night between 1 1 pm and half past midnight?
At the movies.
Alone?
Yes.
Anybody see you? Recognize you?
Why'd anyone recognize me?
Sometimes you talk to people and they remember later.
Remember what?
Meeting you.
Then you have an alibi.
You couldn't have killed
Christine Riviere.
Killed Christine?
No...
I met no one.
I talked to no one.
You didn't keep your ticket?
No.
What for?
I'll call the boss.
I won't be long.
Don't go to sleep.
Try to keep a clear head.
Mind you, with all you take, uppers and downers, hell of a cocktail!
I need them.
You might have a problem there.
If you need them.
The boss has made his decision.
As of today, 5:30 pm, you're in custody.
You'll be notified of your rights in due course.
If you have a lawyer, time to make a call.
I can't sleep.
Isabelle Guerin!
There are the scratches on your arm...
And tests prove the scrap of fabric... comes from your scarf.
Therefore, I confirm you're under arrest and will be held in custody.
It'll be okay.
Miss...
You must be intelligent, given your qualifications and position in your company.
You knew you'd be the prime suspect, the most likely culprit.
Shall we take a break?
You need a doctor?
I agree. My client...
Sorry?
No?
We'll go fast then.
By staging the crime scene to accuse a supposed prowler, you aggravated your crime through cold premeditation.
I recommend you confess immediately.
It'll save us all a lot of trouble.
- My client is not in a...
- Miss Guerin.
Did you kill
Christine Riviere?
Was it you?
I think so.
Careful.
Think what you're saying.
What do you mean?
You ''think so''?
Do you confess?
That's right, I confess.
Will they leave me alone now?
I don't feel well.
First, sign your statement and confession.
I must emphasize that my client's...
Your client has confessed her crime.
Her confession goes in the file.
My medication...
Can I have my medication now?
Go ahead.
Young woman suspected of murdering her boss
Miss, do you recognize this person?
Perfectly.
She wanted a carving knife.
She was so nasty
I can't forget her.
It's rarely as bad as she was.
Show me your carving knives.
Good morning.
Don't get smart.
I'm a customer, not your friend.
No good.
I want a knife with a black handle and a blade like that.
A good knife.
Do yourjob, will you.
ThereI
That one.
If you'd listened, you wouldn't have wasted my time.
Miss Guerin?
Did you buy this knife?
- You don't have to answer.
- Counsel!
Your client has confessed.
We're beyond all that.
Yes, I bought a knife but...
I'm listening.
You admit you bought this knife.
The knife that became the murder weapon.
We're done here.
Thank you, miss, that's all.
My pleasure, sir.
Any time.
You shouldn't have come.
I love you, Isabelle.
I can understand anything, but this...
I'm sorry.
I love you, too.
Don't forget what I asked.
That's all you have to do.
Nothing else.
What is it?
I want to see my lawyer.
It wasn't me.
I didn't kill Christine.
- You retract?
- Yes.
I'm innocent of all charges.
Why did you confess?
I don't know.
Overmedicated.
I wanted it all to stop.
I was so tired.
It all seemed so strange.
And now it's not so strange?
I'm off the sedatives now.
In prison,
I realized what was happening to me.
I'll ask them to see you.
I feel much better now!
Yes, I know,
I have a scarf like that.
I think I lost it somewhere.
I didn't really look at home.
We searched your house and found nothing.
You're generally very tidy, but you ''think'' you lost it?
Allow me to doubt that.
You could have got rid of it when you saw it was torn and pointed to your guilt.
I lose things, like everybody else.
You need to look harder.
You could undertake another search.
My client has no reason to lie.
She has a scarf like that, or she doesn't.
Well?
Nothing.
And the knife?
I did buy a knife like that, but I broke it next day.
I forget what I did with it.
Sure.
After searching all day, the police found no trace of the knife
Isabelle Guerin claims to have broken, which could have helped prove that she didn't...
It wasn't me.
Why would I do a thing like that?
You alone have a motive.
A powerful motive. Revenge.
I've seen how far humiliation drives people.
I never wrote that email!
Why would I do something so horrible if I'd written that?
I'd have been nuts.
Christine sent it to herself, from my computer.
My career was taking off.
She resented it.
She was at war with me.
A war of attrition. Hatred.
We have statements from witnesses, who all confirm that my client was shaken by her boss's harassment.
She was depressed, taking a lot of pills.
That proves nothing.
Just the opposite, in fact.
Nothing you say is supported by the evidence.
It points to you, but you're innocent?
I remain convinced of your guilt.
What is it?
Somebody, help me.
Help me.
What's going on?
Calm down.
Breathe in.
Slowly, deeply.
With me.
In...
Out...
That's right, like that.
Again, keep going!
I can't do it!
It's too hard.
I thought...
I thought that...
It's too hard.
I can't do it.
What can't you do?
What exactly?
I can't cope. With prison.
It's too hard. I can't do it.
You can.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
I know it wasn't you.
I never thought it was.
I'm scared.
The whole time.
I'm scared.
I needed to... see someone I love.
I forgive you.
I don't want any enemies, see?
Thanks for coming.
There's something else.
I knew about your issues with Christine.
The file, the annex. Her ultimatum.
I planned to use it to get back at you.
Pick it up.
It's in Daniel's office.
Isabelle gave me this letter for you.
She can't trust anyone else.
Be careful.
Daniel...
Nobody will believe me.
I need you.
You know I trust you.
I have a favor to ask.
Don't feel obligated.
It's your call.
Never seen her before.
Thanks.
Ask the ticket clerk.
Okay.
Do you know this woman?
Yes.
I remember her very well.
One for Dernier Rivage , please.
Sorry, I'm out of cash.
You'll take a card?
Sure, no problem.
Candy?
Thanks.
Move it, will you?
Sorry. Candy?
Thanks.
Here it is.
Playing the cop, huh?
I just never thought she was guilty.
How did you know where to go?
She'd mentioned the film.
The theater was easy to find.
We'll see if it checks out.
Maybe we didn't look everywhere.
She was so obviously guilty.
On top of that, she confessed.
She took me through the whole movie.
She watched it from start to finish, at half past midnight.
She couldn't have been at Christine Riviere's.
If she has an alibi, keep digging.
Is it a good movie?
Apparently.
I haven't seen it yet.
Thanks.
Why ''Isa''?
Maybe she really believed
I'd stabbed her.
She hated me so much.
Yes, I know.
You all noticed them.
We never discussed them.
You assumed they proved she put up a fight.
It only occurred to me later...
She was perched shakily on a chair.
Just about there.
And then?
Then nothing.
Except, before tending to her arm, she stowed the chair in the shed.
She's an extremely tidy person.
- Borderline obsessive.
- Yes, indeed.
I'll take a look next door.
Goodbye.
All I know is, she's a good neighbor.
You okay? Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
I'll just disinfect it.
It's obvious my client was wrongly accused.
A confirmed alibi, no conclusive evidence, no DNA at the scene...
There are still gray areas.
The scarf, for example.
You still claim you lost an identical scarf?
That's right.
It was exactly the same.
If we find it, it'll be intact.
Might I make a request?
Go ahead.
Would you allow my client to go with your officers to look for the scarf herself?
Granted. I give you 3 hours.
But that's the last request!
The scarf means freedom.
It can't have just vanished.
How long left?
A half-hour.
What?
Intact.
No tears.
I'll take this one.
Isabelle Guerin was released today.
An example of the ideal suspect falling victim to a series of wicked coincidences.
Beware of evidence that doesn't stand up to inspection and motives that are too good to be true.
It was almost another miscarriage ofjustice, but this time the lead investigator displayed great humanity.
He conducted the case impeccably.
The case shows once again that confessions can be dangerous.
They are never proof of guilt.
Let's hope officers, who all too often look for an easy conviction, will learn the lesson.
Sources suggest the investigators' new leads include a prowler or acquaintance of the victim.
Morning, Miss Guerin.
Miss Isabelle Guerin?
Speaking.
This is Jean Druon, your company banker.
What can I do for you?
It's a bit awkward.
A serious matter.
I just received, by anonymous mail, details of dealings between
Christine Riviere and a law firm.
And?
We're currently checking, but it looks like a certain Philippe Deschamps tried to conceal funds siphoned off from one deal.
How much?
I'm not sure exactly.
The accounts were tampered with.
Approximately
80 million euros.
I see.
Complete your investigation and keep me informed.
Call a meeting for tomorrow morning.
Everybody?
All our executives.
And those of our affiliates, including senior staff at our legal advisors.
That includes Philippe Deschamps?
Yes.
I know what I owe you.
Thanks.
You'd have done the same for me.
I'm sure of that.
Beautiful, aren't we?
I'm really happy for you.
And thanks for that file.
What file?
Morning, everybody.
Thanks for coming in.
The aim of this meeting...
Yes? What do you want?
Excuse me, can I have a word?
Go ahead.
Right here?
Yes. Hurry up.
The police are here.
Crime and Fraud squads.
Do you know why?
They're here to arrest someone.
Someone in this room?
Yes.
Show them in.
Gentlemen...
Philippe Deschamps?
- Yes.
- Come with us, please.
I'll fly to Washington this week to set out my new strategy.
I'd like to outline it for you, so we all know where we're going.
You will be charged with the murder of Christine Riviere.
What?
We'll do pre-emptive searches on your vehicle, then at your home.
This is insane!
Don't worry, all will be explained.
Torn.
Did I leave my scarf at yours?
I must have lost it.
I thought as much...
You tried to throw suspicion onto Isabelle Guerin.
Even writing ''Isa'' in blood!
One look earlier and I knew.
It was Isabelle!
Don't start that again.
This scrap of fabric is bullshit!
Why'd I leave it at the scene, if hers was intact?
You were the only person who knew she'd lost it.
You took advantage.
Trouble is, she never loses anything.
Take him in.
Let go of me!
All the party guests agree,
Deschamps stayed behind with the victim.
In the file sent to your bank, we found an ultimatum from her.
He was bound to be exposed as a crook.
Your assistant confirmed
Deschamps collected the file in person.
When we checked your archives, the annex had of course disappeared.
He denies everything.
The exact opposite of you.
Human beings are so complicated.
Sir, will you allow my client to leave Paris for a few days for an important meeting in Washington?
Granted.
I owe you that much.
You owe me nothing at all, sir.
You were doing your job.
I'm grateful that you listened to me.
Despite everything.
Despite myself, even.
Thirsty?
Strong stuff.
Serious poison.
But you know they're safe.
And so are you.
For now.
I always admired you.
That strung-out wreck of a woman wasn't you.
I had my doubts.
I got the pill analyzed.
A placebo.
Sugar pills.
A great pretence.
Like all the rest.
Confess and prove your innocence.
Smart.
That was you.
The real you.
You'll never be like her.
She was capable of killing.
But not for love.
Flight at 8. Wake you?
Goodnight. Sleep well.

- Salue Bien!
Pull yourself together Teddy!
Pull yourself together!
It's just water.
It's a lot of water.
Come on.
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't
I just can't stomach the water.
- So you're my new partner?
- That's right.
Not the best way to meet with my head halfway down the toilet.
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:
The man. The legend. I'll give you that.
The Legend?
What the hell are you boys smoking out there in Portland anyway?
Seattle.
I came from the office in Seattle.
How long have you been with Marshals?
Four years.
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure
What about you? You got a girl? Married?
I was.
She died.
- Jesus... I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.
There was a fire in our apartment building while I was at work
Four People died.
It was the smoke that got her not the fire. So...
- So that's important.
- I'm sorry Boss.
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?
Well here. Have one of mine.
I could of sworn they were in my jacket when I got on.
Government employees will rob you blind.
Thanks.
They give you a briefing about the institution before you left?
All I know is it's a mental hospital.
For the criminally insane.
Well, if it was just folks running around, hearing voices, and chasing after butterflies, they wouldn't need us.
- That's where we're headed?
- Yup.
The other side of the island is rock bluffs all the way down to the edge of the water.
The dock, it's the only way on...or off.
We will be casting off as soon as you two are ashore.
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.
- Why?
- Storm's coming.
I've never seen a marshal's badge before.
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson, gentlemen.
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr. McPherson.
Right now, Marshal. We all are.
"Remember us for we too have lived, loved and laughed"
Electrified perimeter.
How could you tell?
I've seen something like it before.
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded all the help we can give.
But during the stay you will obey protocol. Is that understood?
Absolutely.
The red brick bulding on my right is ward A, the male ward.
Ward B, the female ward, is the one on the left.
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.
An old civil war fort.
The most dangerous patients are housed there.
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without the written consent and physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.
Is that understood?
You act like insanity is catching.
You are hereby required to surrending your firearms.
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed federal marshals.
We are required to carry our firearms with us at all times.
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that: when inside the penitentiary the offices of that institution have final authority.
Gentlemen, you will not get through this gate with your firearms.
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done, come on boys.
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?
So when did she escape? This prisoner?
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation.
Protocol.
Correctional officers at a mental institution.
That's a weird sight, if you don't mind me saying
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.
Even in the world.
We take only the most dangerous, damaged patients.
Ones no other hospital can manage.
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.
He's created something really unique here.
A hospital for people our society normally...
ID's, gentlemen.
Show your badges, gentlemen.
Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...
- Why?
What do you mean?
What do the intelligence agencies want to consult a psychatrist about?
I guess you'll have to ask him.
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.
Marshal Aule.
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.
Pleasure, gentlemen.
He had a lot to say about you.
McPherson is a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.
And what would that be exactly?
A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care.
Pardon me Doc... a what between what and what?
Those paintings are quite accurate.
It used to be that the kind of patients we deal with here were shackled and left in their own filth.
They were beaten. As if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out.
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness.
Or even drown.
- And now?
- We treat them.
Try to heal, try to cure.
And if this fails, at least we provide them with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.
These are... all violent offenders, right?
They've hurt people.
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to say... screw their sense of calm.
It's my job to treat my patients not their victims. I'm not here to judge.
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.
Excuse me, patient.
One Rachel Solando,
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.
Between 10 and midnight.
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.
She took them out one by one and held their heads under until they died.
Then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table.
She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by.
And what about the husband?
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
She is a war widow.
She starved herself when first she came here.
She insisted the children weren't dead.
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?
- Prone to headaches marshal.
Sometimes, but today...
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, Dehydration...
- You alright boss?
- Yes.
In that case you're quite right.
The simpler the better.
Thank you so much.
Rachel still believes her children are alive.
She also believes this place is her home in the Berckshires.
You're kidding me.
She's never once in two years acknowledged that she is in an institution.
She believes we're all... deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.
To sustain the illusion that her children never died, she's created an elaborate fictional structure.
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.
- So have you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island, not a trace.
What's more disturbing is, we don't know how she got out of her room.
It was locked from the outside and the only window is barred.
It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.
Brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in
I came back for a midnight round and she was gone.
Seriously doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her?
I mean, she's in a mental institution, right?
Seems like something you'd notice from time to time.
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
- Two pairs.
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,
You can't just choose to get over it.
So... she left here barefoot?
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten yards in that terrain.
Marshal?
Well this is definitely Rachel's handwriting.
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.
- It's not a psychiatric term?
I'm afraid not.
Who's 67?
Fuck if I know!
I'd have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion.
So you think it's random scribblings?
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.
Brilliant in fact.
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but...
- We're gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.
And you say she had to come through here.
After lights out, the orderlies play cards in here.
Last night there were 7 men sitting at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.
Yet somehow, Rachel managed to slip past them.
Why?
How? She turns invisible?
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files of all the medical staff.
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.
- Anyone who was working then.
- We'll take your request under consideration.
This is not a request, Doctor.
This is a federal facility and a dangerous prisoner...
- Patient.
- Patient...
- has escaped now. You will comply...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff, do you understand?
I'll assemble them in the common room after dinner.
If you have any further questions feel free to join the deputy warden in the search.
It's 11 miles to the nearest land and the water is freezing.
The current was strong last night.
The tide pushing in.
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.
What about those caves down there, have you checked them?
No way she could get there.
The base of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac and a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick.
You said it yourself marshal, she's got no shoes.
All right!
Let's check the other side!
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.
The guards already searched inside it.
- What's in there? More patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for the night.
Let's go, boys!
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yeah.
Can't nobody get in or out of their room in that corridor without me seeing.
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does she have to pass to get down here?
Me.
Glen Miga.
- Sir, I didn't see nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.
Glen.
Glen.
Tell me the truth.
I maybe... went to the bathroom.
- What? You breached protocol? Christ...
- I wasn't gone more than a minute.
All right, let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.
Miss Solando was put in her room for lights out.
Does anybody here know what she did before that?
Anyone?
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.
She was in a group therapy session.
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?
Define "unusual".
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, marshal.
For criminally insane.
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.
I will rephrase.
Did anything happen last night during group therapy, that was more...
- let's say, more memorable than...
- Normal?
Exactly!
No. I'm sorry.
Did Mrs. Solando say anything during group therapy?
She was worried about the rain.
And she hated the food here.
Complained constantly.
Last night included.
So... you were there.
Was there a doctor present?
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.
Dr. Sheehan?
Yes. He was running the session.
He's Rachels's "primary".
The psychaiatrist who directly oversees her care.
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.
He'd putting it off too long.
You're in a state of lockdown.
A dangerous patient has escaped and you let her primary doctor leave on vacation?
Of course, he's a doctor.
Do you have the phone number for where he's gone?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
I'm sorry sir, but its all down.
All the lines.
The storm's hitting the mainland like a hammer.
If you get it working, come find me immediately.
The marshalls need to make an important call.
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at my house around 9
If you'd care to drop by
Good, we can talk then, right?
We have been talking, marshal.
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got into the wrong line of public service.
It is a little overwhelming. it was constructed during the civil war
The same time as the military fort housing ward C.
This is the original commander's quarters and Uncle Sam got the bill.
The commander was court-martialed.
I can see why.
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?
No.
It's Mahler.
Quite right, marshal.
Forgive me, gentlemen...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.
"Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor"
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.
Soda and ice please, thanks.
You don't indulge in alcohol?
I am surprised.
Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?
Common enough.
And yours?
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...
I've always heard it was overrun with boozers and drunks.
Not that I've noticed.
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?
Excellent marshal.
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?
Men like you... are my specialty.
You know?
Men of violence.
That's a hell of an assumption to make...
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand me, I said you are men of violence
I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
That's quite different.
Please, please, edify us, doctor.
You both served overseas.
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know, we were both paper pushers over there
No, you were not.
Since the schoolyard, neither of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option.
We weren't raised to run, Doc.
Ah, yes... Raised. and who raised you, marshal?
Me?
Wolves.
Very impressive defense mechanisms.
Do you believe in God, marshal?
I'm quite serious.
That's rubbish.
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?
[In German]
I have, I was there, for the liberation of Dakau.
Your English is very good, almost flawless.
His English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.
You're German?
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan and the rest of staff as well.
No personnel files will be released for you.
Period.
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.
Bullshit, out of the question!
Bullshit!
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to our board of overseers.
He relayed your request and it's been refused.
Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither do you, sir.
Marshal, continue your investigation and we will do all we can to help.
This investigation is over.
We're gonna file our reports and hand it over to...
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.
Come on, Chuck.
Nice night.
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?
Why?
I guess, I dunno, I just... never really quit anything before.
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of a locked cell barefoot without any help.
I think she had alot of help.
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion right now, rethinking his whole attitude.
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?
I didn't say that.
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?
I killed alot of people in the war.
Is that why you drink?
Are you real?
No.
She's still here.
Who?
Rachel?
She never left.
Remember when we stayed in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?
We were so happy.
She's here.
You can't leave.
I'm not gonna leave.
I love you so much.
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.
I am.
You have to wake up.
I won't go.
You're here.
I'm not.
You have to face that.
But she is.
And so is he.
Who?
Laeddis.
I have to go.
No! Please...just let me hold you.
- Just a little bit longer.
- Oh, Teddy...
You have to let me go.
I can't.
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.
Doctor.
Doctor, doctor.
We need to interview the patients who were in Rachel's group therapy session.
I thought your investigation was finished?
It's not like we can take the ferry.
Now was Rachel receiving any other treatment for her illnesses?
Do you know the state of the mental health field these days, gentlemen?
No. Not a clue doctor.
War.
The old school believes in surgical intervention.
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.
Others say they become zombies.
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.
A new drug has just been approved.
Authority.
Which relaxes psychotic patients.
You could say it tames them.
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- Me?
I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient with respect, listen to him, try and understand. you just might reach him.
- These patients?
- Even these.
What should be a last resort is becoming a first response.
Give them a pill, put them in a corner, and it all goes away.
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs meant to keep her from becoming violent, but it was only intermittently effective.
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was her refusal to face what she had done.
"Was."
Is there a reason you keep referring to your patient in the past tense, doctor?
Look outside, marshal.
Why do you think?
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted his father's nurse with a broken glass.
Nurse survived, but her face permaanently disfigured.
I can't wait.
She'd smiles at me.
She was so sweet.
But... I could see it in her eyes.
She liked to be naked.
To suck cock.
Okay, Mr. Breen.
And then she asked me if she can have a glass of water?
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?
- Why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she could laugh at it.
Mr. Breen, we need to ask you some questions, okay?
When I cut her she screamed
But...
She scared me.
What did she expect?
Interesting.
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, okay?
Rachel Solando...
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?
She drowned her kids!
This is a sick fucking world we live in. I'll tell you that...
You know what? They should be gassed.
All of them... the retards, the killers the niggers. You kill your own kid?
Gas the bitch!
Would you... stop that?
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?
A husband...
Just trying to make ends meet, to lead a normal life...
And it says in your file that uh...
You tore her face off, didn't you?
Congratulations, no more normal for her, not ever again, no.
Do you know what she was afraid of?
You.
Could you stop that, please?!
Stop that!
Please... stop!
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?
- I want to go back.
- Take him!
I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.
Excuse me for saying this,
- Miss Kearns...
- Misses.
Mrs. Kearns.
But you seem... quite normal,...
I mean in comparison with the other patients here.
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everybody does.
The difference is that most people don't kill their husbands with an axe.
Although personally I think if a man beats you and fucks half the women he sees and no one will help you, axing him isn't the least understandable thing you can do.
Maybe you shouldn't get out.
And what would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are bombs that can reduce whole cities to ash
And what do they call "televisions"... voices and faces coming from a box.
I hear enough voices already
What can you tell us about Rachel?
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.
She believed her kids were alive.
She thought she was still living in the Berkshire and we were all neighbours
- The milkman, postmen...
- Deliveryman,
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?
Yes. Um.
He talked about anger.
Tell me about him...
What's he like?
I think he's uh...
Okay... nice.
Not hard on the eyes as my mother would say.
Did he ever make a pass at you?
No.
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he would never...
Could I have a glass of water, please?
No problem.
Thank you, marshal.
I have just one more question for you
Mrs. Kearns.
Did you ever meet a patient named Andrew Laeddis?
No.
Never heard of him.
She was coached.
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?
You asked every one of those patients back there about him. Who is he?
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner for the Christ sake!
We just met, Chuck.
Been on the beat a long time.
You got a duty, got a career and what I'm doing, not exactly by the book.
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss
I just to know what the hell is going on.
When this case came over the wires,
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?
- Why?
Andrew Laeddis, was the maintenance man in the apartment building where my wife and I lived.
Okay.
He was also a firebug.
Andrew Laeddis lit the match, that caused the fire that killed my wife.
Let 'em out!
What happened to Laeddis?
Got away with it.
Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.
About a year ago, I opened up the newspaper and there he is.
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.
He had a new scar from his right temple down to his left lip.
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you forget.
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.
He said voices told him to do it.
First he was sent to prison and then he was transferred here.
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.
I'm sure he's not in ward B that leaves ward C.
Or he could be dead.
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.
Only one place no one really knows.
That patient, Bridget Kearne, when she sent me for water, she said something to you back there, didn't she?
No.
Come on boss!
She wrote it.
Boss!
We gotta get indoors. It's turning into fucking Kansas out here...
- All right. 
- Now. Let's go!
Watch out!
Jesus!
Come on! Let's go back!
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. That's all right.
So... if Laeddis is here...
What are you going to do boss?
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.
If it was my wife
I'd kill him twice.
When we got through the gates of Dakau, the SS guards surrendered.
The commandante tried to kill himself before we got there... but he botched it.
Took him an hour to die.
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.
Too many to count.
Too many to imagine.
So yeah
The guards surrendered, we took their guns, we lined them up...
It wasn't warfare, it was murder. 
Yeah I've had enough of killing.
That's not why I'm here.
So what is this all about?
After Laeddis vanished,
I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe.
A lot of people knew about this place, but no one wants to talk...
You know? It's like they're scared of something
You know this place is funded by a special grant from the House of
Unamerican Activities Committee.
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?
By conducting experiments on the mind.
At least that's my guess.
And you think thats going on in here?
Like I said, no one would talk, right?
Until I found someone who used to be a patient here.
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid.
Socialist.
He gets offered some money for some psych study. Guess what they were testing?
- Drug tests.
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.
Almost beats his proffesor to death
Ends up here in Ashecliffe.
Ward C.
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death.
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce... stands up in the courtroom and he begs the judge, for the electric chair.
Anywhere but not a mental hospital.
Judge gives him life in the Dedham prison.
- And you found him?
- Yes, I found him.
He's a mess
But it is pretty clear from what he tells me, they're experimenting on people here.
I don't know, boss.
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it.
Crazy people are a perfect subject.
They talk, but nobody listens.
I stood in Dakau.
We saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right?
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war to stop them, and now find out it may be happening here?
On our soil?
No.
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back, and blow the lid off this place.
That's it.
Wait a minute.
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.
Waiting for a chance to get out here then suddenly they need a US marshal?
I got lucky. There was a patient escape, it was the perfect excuse.
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.
The world doesn't work that way. They got an electrified fence around a septic facility.
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HUAC?
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place stinks of "government ops".
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?
There's no way they could of known I'd be assigned to this case. No way...
While you were looking into them, they were looking into you.
All they need to do is fake an escape to get you here.
And now they have you.
They have us both, here, now.
Marshal, are you out here?
This is deputy warden McPherson.
Marshal!
How about that? They found us huh.
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.
I know you are in there...
We're getting off of this Goddamned island.
You and me.
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go!
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!
And hurry up, this thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane!
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
It should be ready by tomorrow.
That is if we don't all wash away first.
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were pretty much done for.
So...
This is our only choice, huh?
Got something really nice in prison already if that don't work for you...
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.
That's why I must repeat my insistence that all ward C patients be placed in manual restraints.
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island, in the middle of the ocean, during a hurricane.
A lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility.
It's a gamble, Steven. say the power fails
There's a backup generator.
And if that goes? The cell doors will open.
Where are they going to go?
Hmm?
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland and wreak havoc.
You're quite right. They're far more likely to wreak havoc right here on us.
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.
That's 24 human beings.
You can't live with that, can you?
Frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in ward A and B in manual restraints as well.
Excuse me
Excuse me
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.
We spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note
The law of 4, I loved that.
You said you had no idea what that second line could refer to. Correct?
Who is 67?
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.
Nothing?
Because I believe I just heard you say that there are
24 patients in ward C.
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B
Which means there is a total of what?
66 patients here in this facility.
That is correct, yes.
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting you have a 67th patient, doctor
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This Is ridiculous.
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?
No, what's the good news, doctor?
Rachel has been found.
She's here.
Safe and sound.
There is not a mark on her.
Who are these men?
Why are they in my house?
Police officers, Rachel.
They... have a few questions.
Ma'am.
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist subversive in this area passing out literature
Here?
In this neighborhood?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
If you can tell us what you did yesterday, where you were, it would really help us narrow our search.
Yes...
Well, I...umm
I made breakfast for Jim and the children, and then I...
I packed Jim's lunch and he left.
Then I sent the children off to school.
And then...
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.
I see...
And after that?
After that...
I thought of you.
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?
You're gone...
You're dead.
I cry every night.
How am I supposed to survive?
God.
Rachel... it will be all right.
I'm so sorry, but... everything is gonna be all right? Okay?
I buried you.
I buried an empty casket. Your body rained down lumps of flesh splashing into the sea eaten by sharks.
My Jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?!
Who are you?! Who are you?!
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought she might tell you something, but... we found her down by the lighthouse, skipping stones.
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going to ask you both to go down into basement.
There's food, water, and cots.
It's the safest place to be when the hurricane hits.
Are you all right?
You look pale.
I'm fine, it's just uh...
Boss, are you okay?
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?
Marshal are you having a migraine?
I'll be alright.
- What's wrong with him.
- Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as a bell.
He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and filled it with razors then shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, marshal.
- No... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.
He's going to need to lie down.
Careful. All right.
Gonna be okay. Relax.
- Who is that?
- Him?
That's the warden.
Don't you worry about him, alright?
Looks like an ex-military prick.
You know what? I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.
You should have saved me.
You should have saved all of us.
Hey buddy. Hey.
Laeddis.
Yes.
Hi, buddy.
No hard feelings, right?
No hard feelings.
Little something for later.
Because I know how much you need it.
Clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.
Give me a hand here.
I could get into trouble.
I'm dead?
I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you save me?
I tried, I wanted to, but by the time I got there, it was too late.
See?
Aren't they beautiful?
Why are you all wet, baby?
Laeddis isn't dead.
He isn't gone.
He's still here.
I know.
We need to find him, Teddy.
You need to find him and you kill him dead.
Shhh. It's okay.
Shh. Again!
The generator is faulty.
Are you okay boss?
This goddamn migraine!
Back up generators failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.
What do you want to do?
Christ!
No, no, no!
Put it down.
Now! Now!
You think the whole electrical system is fried?
I'd say that it's a good possibility.
All electronic security... fences, gates, the doors
Come on.
Nice day for a stroll don't you think?
To ward C for example.
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?
He told me this is where they keep the worse ones.
The guys even the other inmates are scared of.
Noyce give you anything on the layout?
Not really.
All that he remembers was people scream day and night. There were no windows.
There were bars everywhere.
Jesus Christ!
First time on ward C, right?
- Yes, yes...
- Yes.
- Yeah, heard stories, but...
- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,
But some of them are still loose.
If you see one don't try to restrain him yourselves.
These fuckers will kill you.
Clear?
Alright. Get your asses moving then.
Go on.
He's here.
Laeddis.
I can feel him.
Tag! You're it.
Ted!
Listen to me!
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?
Why would anyone want to?
We hear things here.
About the outside world.
About atolls.
About the h-bomb tests.
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?
- With... Hydrogen?
- That's funny.
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?
But not the hydrogen bomb
It implodes.
Creating an explosion to the thousandth millionth degree.
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you?
- I get it!
Let em go!
No!
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!
You got Billings?
What's the fucks the matter with you guys?
Catch them, not kill them!
He jumped at us.
You give me a hand with him.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
No! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.
Come on!
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn balls for this..
Laeddis....
Laeddis....
You're dead, we're all dead.
This is hell, we're in hell.
Please...
Stop me.
Before I kill more.
Go!
Please, please!
Laeddis ...
You told me I'd be free of this place.
You promised.
You lied.
Laeddis?
Laeddis!?
That's pretty damned funny.
Your voice...
Don't you recognize it?
After all the talks we've had?
After all the lies that you've told me?
Let me see your face.
They say I'm theirs now.
They say I'll never leave here.
Your match is about to go out.
Let me see your goddamn face now!
Why?
So you can lie to me more?
- This isn't about the truth!
- Yes it is.
- It's about exposing the truth.
- This is about you!
And Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about.
I was incidental.
A way in.
George?
George Noyce?
No, it's not possible,
You can't be here.
Do you like it?
Who did this to you, George?
You did!
What the hell do you mean?
What are you talking all of your fucking talk
And I'm back here because of you!
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.
Huh?
However this happened, Im gonna find a way to fix this. You understand me?
I'll never get out now.
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!
Don't you get it?
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.
This is a game. All of this... is for you.
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.
George... you're wrong.
Really?
Been alone much since you got here?
I'm been with my partner.
You have never worked with him before, have you?
He's a...
US Marshal from Seattle.
You have never worked with him before, have you?
George, look...
I know people.
I trust this man.
Then, they've already won.
Fuck!
They're going to... take me to the lighthouse.
They're going to cut into my brain.
And I'm only here because of you!
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You can't dig out the truth and kill Laeddis at the same time.
You've got to make a choice you understand that, don't you?
I'm not here to kill anyone.
- Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...
She's dead.
Let her go...
Let her go.
Tell him Teddy...
Tell him why.
You've got to do it.
There's no other way.
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...
You've gotta do it!
How I told you my heart was breaking.
And you asked me why?
She's fucking with your head.
And then i told you it was from happiness.
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.
You want to uncover the truth?
You've gotta let her go ...
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!
I can't!
I can't.
Then you'll never leave this island.
Dolores?
He's not in this ward.
He was transferred...
Out of here.
If he's not in ward A, there's only one place he can be
The lighthouse.
Hey!
God help you.
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,
They're looking all over the place for him.
They're on the way to the roof.
Let's get the hell out of here.
This way.
Just keep going.
We belong here
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?
Where were you?
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.
Did you ever find Laeddis?
No.
- No. I never found him.
- Well I've got the next best thing.
His intake form.
It was the only thing in his file.
No session notes. No incident reports.
No photographs... just this.
It was weird.
Here, take a look.
I'll look at it later.
What's the matter, boss?
I'll take a look at it later, that's all.
Ashecliffe's that way.
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.
I'm going to the lighthouse.
I'm going to find out what the fuck is happening on this island.
Here it is.
Damn!
We're too far South.
We're gonna have to double back.
There's no way we could cross those rocks.
There could be a way behind those trees.
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks that leads over to the lighthouse.
What are we doing here?
We've got the intake form.
It proves there's a 67th patient... which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
Do you understand?
What the hell can I say to you to stop you?
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?
Because climbing down there when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why.
Okay.
Maybe you better sit this one out then.
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here on this rock.
On this island.
Without no one to rely on but eachother.
And now you're acting like.........
Like what? Like what?
How am I acting?
What the hell happened back there in those cells, Ted?
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.
Seattle?
I'll going on...alone.
I'm going with you, boss.
I said alone.
Fine.
Damn it!
Damn it!
I knew it wouldn't take long.
But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.
Chuck!
Chuck!
Come on!
Chuck!
Where are you, Chuck?
Chuck!
Chuck!
Who are you?
I'm Teddy Daniels.
I'm a cop.
You're the marshal.
That's right.
Would you mind... taking your hand from behind your back, please?
Why?
Why?!
I want to make sure what you're holding won't hurt me.
I'm gonna keep this...
If you don't mind.
Fine by me.
You're Rachel Solando.
The real one.
Did you kill your children?
I never had children.
I was never married.
And before I was a patient in Ashecliff, I worked here.
You were a nurse?
I was a doctor, marshal.
You think I'm crazy?
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ... well that hardly helps, does it?
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.
People tell the world you're crazy and all your protests to the contrary, just confirms what they're saying.
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.
Once you are declared insane, then anything you do is called a part of an insanity.
Your reasonable protests or denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.
Survival instincts.
Defense mechanisms.
You're smarter than you look marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.
Tell me something...
Yeah...
What happened to you?
I started asking about these large shipments of sodium-anatol.
- An opium-based hallucinogen.
- Psychotropic drugs.
I asked about the surgeries, too.
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?
They zap the patient with electroshocks, then go through the eye with an ice pick and pull out some nerve fibers.
Makes the patients much more obedient.
Tractable.
It's barbaric.
Unconscionable.
Do you know how pain enters the body marshal? Do you?
Depends on where you hurt.
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep, hunger, anger... everything.
What If you could control it?
The brain?
Re-create a man, so he doesn't feel pain.
Or love. Or sympathy.
A man who can't be interrogated because he has no memories to confess.
You can never take away all a man's memories.
Never.
Marshal, the North Koreans used American POWs during their brainwashing experiments.
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they are doing here.
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.
And do things sane men never do.
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.
That would take years.
Years of research, hundreds of patients to experiment on.
50 years from now, people will look back and say, "Here. This place is where it all began."
The Nazis used the Jews.
The Soviets used prisoners in their own gulags and we...
We tested patients, on Shutter Island.
No, they won't ...
No
You do understand
That they can't let you leave?
I am a federal marshal ...
They can't stop me.
I was an esteemed psychiatrist, from a respected family.
It didn't matter.
Let me ask you ... any past traumas in your life?
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?
Because they can point to some event in your past and say it is the reason you lost your sanity......
So that when they commit you here
Your friends and colleagues will say, 
"Of course he cracked."
"And who wouldn't have, after what he'd been through."
That could be said of anyone
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.
How's your head?
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?
I am prone to migraines. Yes.
Jesus!
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
- I mean even aspirin?
- They hit the aspirin?
Jesus!
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank coffee they gave you.
You tell me at least that you've been smoking your own cigarettes.
No... no.
No. I haven't.
It takes 36 to 48 hours for neuroleptic narcotics...
To reach sufficient levels in the blood stream.
Pulse becomes first
First the fingertips and then eventually the whole hand.
Seen any waking nightmares lately, marshal?
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?
Tell me.
Brain surgery.
"Let's open the skull and see what happens if we pull on this" kind.
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.
It's where they create the ghosts.
Who knows about this?
On the island I mean. Who?
Everyone.
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.
You can't stay here.
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid if they come looking for you, they might find me.
I'm sorry, but you have to go.
I'm gonna come back for you.
I won't be here. I move during the day. new places every night.
But I could come get you off of this island.
Haven't you heard a word I've said?
The only way off the island is the ferry and they control it.
You'll never leave here.
I had a friend.
I was with him yesterday, but we got separated.
Have you seen him?
Marshal...
You have no friends.
There you are.
We've been wondering when you'd show up.
Have a seat.
Come on.
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?
I was just... just looking around.
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?
- What?
- God's gift.
The violence.
When I came downstairs in my home and I saw that tree in my living room, it reached down for me like a divine hand.
God loves violence.
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.
Why else would there be so much of it?
It's in us.
It's what we are.
We wage war, we burn sacrifices, we pillage and plunder and tear at the flesh of our brothers and why? Because God gave us violence to wage in his honor.
I thought God gave us moral order.
There is no moral order as pure as this storm.
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this: can my violence conquer yours?
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.
You're as violent as they come.
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.
With the constraints of society, we are lifted and
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.
Wouldn't you?
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be controlled, but I know different.
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.
We've known each other for centuries.
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?
Give it a try.
That's the spirit.
Where have you been?
Wandering, just looking at your island.
Oh I forgot. You're leaving.
Now that Rachel has been found.
Sure. Yeah.
Big meeting?
Oh, yes ...
Apparently there was an unidentified man in ward C yesterday
He subdued a highly dangerous patient.
Quite handily.
Is that so?
It seems he had a long conversation with a paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.
This Noyce, you said his name was,
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient got so wound up by one of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.
Cigarette?
Oh. No, thanks.
I quit.
So, you're taking the ferry?
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...
I think we've gotten all we came here for so.
"We" marshal?
Speaking of which. Have you
- seen him, Doctor?
- Who?
My partner, Chuck.
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.
You know, I've built something valuable here.
And valuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time.
Everyone wants a quick fix, they always have.
I'm trying to do something that people, yourself included, don't understand.
And I'm not going to give up without a fight.
I can see that...
So tell me again about your partner.
What partner?
Marshal...
Going somewhere?
No. Just heading out to the ferry. So...
I'm afraid it's the other way.
If you wait a moment,
I'll find someone who can take you to the dock.
What is this, doctor?
It's just a sedative.
- It's for precaution.
- Precaution?
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.
You think you deserve it?
For what?
For provoking you? and, forgive me, what doesn't provoke you?
Remarks...
- Words...
- Nazis!
Well that, too.
And of course, memories, dreams...
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes from the Greek for "wound"?
And what is the German word for "dream"
"Traumen".
Traumen.
Wounds can create monsters.
And you ... you are wounded, marshal.
Wouldn't you agree, when you see a monster you must stop it?
- I agree.
- Yes...
What are you doing, baby?
You've got to get to the ferry.
No. No. 
No.
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead, then he is perfect for their experiments.
There's only one place they'd take him.
You go there and you'll die.
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.
I can't lose anyone else.
Don't go, Teddy.
Please don't do this. Don't go.
I'm sorry, honey.
I love this thing because you gave it to me
But the truth is ... it's one fucking ugly tie.
No!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Are you going to kill me?
No.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Why are you all wet, baby?
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.
The rifle's empty by the way.
Have a seat.
For god's sake dry off you're going to catch a cold.
Alright.
How badly did you hurt the guard?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. He's here.
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look at your man before you send him up.
So, Dr. Shehan...
He came on the ferry this morining.
Not exactly.
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.
Sorry to hear about that.
Tremors are getting pretty bad.
How are the hallucinations?
Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.
I know.
Dr. Solando... she told me about neuroleptics.
Did she now?
And when was this?
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.
I don't doubt it.
Considering she's not real.
But your hallucinations are more severe than I thought.
You are not on neuroleptics.
You are not on anything as a matter of fact.
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?
Withdrawal.
Withdrawal?
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned drink since I've been on this island.
Chlorpromazine.
I'm not a fan of pharmacology but I have to say in your case ...
- Clorpro... what?
- Chlorpromazine.
The same thing we've been giving you for the past 24 months.
So for the past two years you've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston. Is that it?
Not Boston.
Here.
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.
After everything I seen here, doctor, you really think you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh?
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?
I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.
You were a U.S. marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.
You broke into ward C for proof of the 67th patient
If you'd gotten it to the mainland, you could have blown the lid off this place.
- Wait... wait.
- But somehow you couldn't find time to look at it. Well read it now.
Go ahead.
The patient is highly intelligent, highly delusional.
Decorated army veteran.
Present for the liberation of Dakau.
Former U.S. marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.
Shows no remorse for his crime because he denies that the crime ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical narratives which preclude facing the truth of his actions...
I've had enough of this bullshit.
Where's my partner, huh?
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?
Let's try this another way.
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal". Am I correct?
- Don't you even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.
Notice anything these four names have in common?
Your rule of 4.
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you have done anything
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?
The names ... have the same letters.
Edward Daniels has exactly the same
13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando and Dolores Chanal. The names
- Are anagrams for each other.
- Your tactics, they're not going to work on me.
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe is you, Andrew.
Bullshit.
You were committed here by court order 24 months ago.
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.
So you invented another self.
Let's get down to the facts.
You've created a story in which you're not a murderer, you are hero.
Still a U.S marshal.
Only here at Ashecliffe because of a case and you've uncovered a conspiracy
So that anything we tell you about who you are, what you've done you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.
My name is Edward Daniels.
I've been hearing this fantasy for two years now. I know every detail.
Patient 67. The storm.
Rachel Solando.
Your missing partner.
The dreams you have every night.
You were at Dakau,
But you may not have killed any guards.
I wish I could let you just live in your fantasy world.
I really do.
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.
You've injured orderlies. Guards.
Other patients.
Two weeks ago you attacked George Noyce.
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.
Give me one reason why I would even touch him.
Because he called you Laeddis and you do anything not to be him.
I have a transcript of that conversation you had with Noyce yesterday.
This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about
No. No. He is saying that it's about
"me and Laeddis".
When you've asked him what happened to his face, said, and I quote again,
"You did this".
- No. He meant it was my fault he...
- You almost killed him.
The warden and the board of overseers are determined something be done. It's been decided.
That unless, we can bring you back into sanity now, right now, permanent measures will be taken to ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
I understand just fine.
If... if I don't play along with your little game here.
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into one of his ghosts.
What about my partner?
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office that he's a defense mechanism?
Hello, boss.
What the fuck is going on here?
You working for him?
I'm sorry about that someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.
You've been watching me, huh?
Watching me every minute.
Who... who are you?
Who are you?
Tell me.
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?
I've been you primary psychiatrist for the last two years.
I am Lester Sheehan.
And I told you about my wife ...
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you. I risked everything to come in here after you. Everything!
I know, boss.
We're running out of time here, Andrew,
I swore before the entire board of overseers that I could construct
The most radical, cutting edge role-play ever attempted in psychiatry and it would bring you back.
I thought if we let you play this out we could get you to see how untrue, how impossible it is.
We've had to run of the place for two days.
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?
The satanic O.R.'s?
Andrew, listen to me.
If we fail with you then everything we've tried to do here will be discredited.
Everything.
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.
And right now, it'll come down to you.
Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Edward Daniels.
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.
I see. And that's your firearm marshal?
You're sure?
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me. 
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this one Doc
Then blast away, because that's the only way you're ever getting off this island.
Andrew, please don't.
My gun...
What have you done to my Goddamn gun.
It's a toy, Andrew.
We're telling you the truth.
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
Suicidal.
You drank. Stayed away.
Ignored what everyone had told you.
You moved to that lake house after she, purposely, set your city apartment on fire
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop it!
You're lying...
Andrew, your children.
Simon...
- Henry...
- I didn't have any children.
Your wife drowned them.
At the cabin by the lake.
And here, the little girl, the one you dream of every night.
I never had a little.
The one who tells you over and over that you should have saved her
Saved them all.
Your daughter...
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny that she ever lived?
Andrew, are you?
I'm so sorry, baby...
I told you not to come in here.
I told you... this would be the end of you.
I'm back.
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.
Must of stopped ten places in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.
Dolores?
Dolores?
Dolores?
Dolores?
Baby... why are you all wet?
I missed you.
I want to go home.
You are home!
Where are the kids?
They're in school.
It's Saturday, honey.
School's not in on Saturday.
My school is.
Oh my God!
My God!
God!
Oh my God, no!
Come on!
Come on!
Please, God, no.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Let's put them in the room.
We'll dry them off...
We'll change their clothes...
They'll be our living dolls.
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.
If you ever loved me, Dolores...
Please stop talking.
I love you.
Set me free!
Honey...
We'll give them baths...
- I love you so much, Dolores.
- And I love you. I love you.
Andrew...
Andrew, can you hear me?
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel...
Rachel.
Rachel who?
Rachel Laeddis...
My daughter.
Why are you here?
Because I killed my wife. and why did you do that?
Dhe murdered our children.
And she told me to let her go.
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.
Why?
We need to hear you say it.
After she tried to kill herself the first time,
Dolores told me she... she had an insect... living inside her brain.
She could feel it... clicking across her skull... pulling the wires, just for fun.
She told me that.
She told me but I didn't listen.
I loved her so much.
Why did you make them up?
Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children.
I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.
I killed them...
Here's my theory, Andrew. we broke through once before, nine months ago, and then you regressed.
- I don't remember that.
- I know.
You reset, Andrew.
Like a tape playing over and over on an endless loop.
I hope that what we've done will be enough to stop it from ever happening again
But I need to know ... you have accepted the reality.
You came after me, huh, doctor?
You tried to help me when no one else would.
My name is Andrew Laeddis...
And I murdered my wife in the spring of '52.
How we doing this morning?
Good.
And You?
Can't complain.
So what's our next move?
You tell me.
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the hell is going on here. It's bad.
Don't worry, partner.
They're not gonna catch us.
That's right. We're too smart for them.
Yeah, we are.
Aren't we?
You know this place makes me wonder.
Yeah? What's that boss?
Which would be worse?
To live as a monster ... or to die as a good man.
Teddy?
Tada! And here we are, the stars of the hour on Amy's new video camera.
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.
Yeah, well, mine love me too, slut.
Bitch. l'd like to know who came up with the stupid rule that you have to go back to school the very next day after New Year's. lt's so fucking stupid.
- When would you want to go back?
- Like Easter.
At least then l wouldn't feel so wasted.
Let me use it too.
- You don't even use makeup.
- l do too.
Like what?
Like some baby powder?
Shut up.
Virgins don't know how to wear makeup.
Oh, come on. l didn't mean anything by it.
- You're so fucking sensitive.
- Whatever. l don't see what the big deal is anyway.
Just fuck some guy and get it over with.
Good advice. Thanks.
You're a ho-- H-O, ho.
Jealousy talking.
Blah blah blah.
That guy over there would do you.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey.
Hey, Meg.
Did you get some of that shit
Tercel had today?
- No. Was it good?
- Fuckin' awesome, girl.
Fuck! He didn't even tell me he had some.
- Last time l blow him.
- You blew Tercel?
Like you haven't. l've seen the stash you carry. l didn't have to blow him for anything.
Yeah yeah, l'm sure.
- Can you save me some?
- Um, no.
- Me and Gideon are partying tonight.
- You party every night.
What's so special about one night?
Come on, save me some.
Ask her what she'll do for it.
Gideon wants to know what you're willing to do for it.
- ls he there?
- ( Gideon laughing )
- Yeah.
- Fuck, Angie!
Can't a person have a private conversation?
Come on, Meggie, there's no secrets between me and you.
- l know you inside and out.
- Go fuck yourself.
Why don't you come on over here and play with me and Angie?
Yeah, in your dreams, you dork.
Aw, come on.
You know you want to.
Woman: God damn it, Megan!
Why didn't my program record? l unplugged the VCR to use the game box and l forgot to plug it back in.
You forgot?!
You forgot?! l worked 1 2 hours a fucking day to buy you that box and all l ask is that you let me watch my fucking program!
- Lay off me.
- You selfish bitch.
Why don't you go live with your father and get the fuck out of my life? l bought this game box. lt's out of here!
Wow, your mom is crazy.
What a twisted bitch.
- She's crazier than my mom.
- ( object clatters, breaks )
What are you doing?
Miss Stewart:
You're going to learn to respect me!
- Megan: That's mine!
- No. l paid for it
- and l get to smash it!
- Oh no.
Oh no.
- ( clears throat )
- ( computer chimes )
- Oh, hold on.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Meg.
What's happening?
Hey, Amy. Nothing.
Just hanging. l know it's a little late, but l was wondering if you want to hit the mall before they close and see the new Choo shoes.
You want to go to the mall?
Yeah, or we can just hang out. l can't. l have to do stuff with my mom.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Fuckin' cat fur makes me vomit. l told you, you have to keep him out of your bedroom at night.
Yeah, you told me.
Okay well, if you need anything call me, okay?
- l'll see you in school tomorrow.
- Yeah. Thanks, Amy.
- Ciao.
- Bye.
So what's it going to be, Meggie?
You know only Gideon's slaves get the fairy dust.
- l'll be right over.
- ( Gideon laughs )
- ( knocking at door )
- Come in.
- Morning, princess.
- Morning, Daddy.
You know, Party Restaurant's getting all booked up.
Are you sure you don't want to have your birthday party there?
Daddy, it's for kids. l don't want people who dress up like bears singing ''Happy Birthday'' to me.
- Well, you used to like that.
- Yeah, when l was like 10.
Well, try not to grow up so fast, okay? lt makes your dad feel really really old.
You'll never be old, Daddy.
Well, l'll figure something special to get you for your birthday.
Like maybe a video camera?
Hmm, mortgage payment, video camera.
- What should l do?
- lt doesn't cost that much, jerk.
Louise, your daughter just called me a jerk.
She's right, you know?
Women, always ganging up on defenseless men.
All right, get ready for school.
We'll talk about your present later, princess.
Okay.
Hurry up, Amy.
You're going to be late.
Okay.
Princess.
Princess Pudgy.
- ( beeps )
- Ben?
- What's up, ma?
- Oh hey, Ben.
- Hey, Ben.
- Damn, all the hot girls in one place?
- Yeah, where you're not.
- Bogus ass.
Why you gotta do me like that?
Because she doesn't do losers, duh.
- Ah, l see.
- Yeah, she's not Kathy.
- Oh, shut up.
- All you girls are crazy as hell.
So what's going on with this weekend?
Party's on this weekend.
You can come by the crib around midnight.
- Shit'll be off the hook.
- Cool. Can l bring Aaron?
- Nope. No dudes.
- Why not?
Because it's my party and it's my rules, that's why.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, Kathy, you'd better obey the rules.
Oh, shut up. l have footage of you
''obeying the rules'' on your hands and knees at the last party.
Hey, Ben, can l bring Amy?
Man, this is a party, not church.
You're not really going to drag her along, are you?
Whoa, y'all need to chill.
What's wrong with Amy?
Oh well, let's think.
She's a drag.
She ain't fun for shit.
She don't know how to dress.
Amy is hot.
Man, if Amy was hot,
Lexie would have fucked her by now.
Shut up!
No, we all know you go with the flow.
Look, Ben, l'm serious.
Her birthday's coming up.
Oh. Well, she's going to get an ass-whupping if she comes to my party.
Well, either Amy comes or l don't.
- We gotta go, Meg.
- Okay, bye.
See you later.
What is it with you and this girl?
You fuckin' her?
She got blackmail on you? What?
She's my friend.
She's not a fucking loser like the rest of you.
Yeah well, l got a reputation to think about. l run the best parties and you are my premier party girl.
You bringing Amy along could take away that crown.
Well, maybe l don't need to have it.
Yeah, you do.
What the fuck else do you got?
Does Amy come or do l spend quality time with my mom Saturday night?
- You owe me for this.
- Yeah, take a number. l'm not kidding.
You're going to be jumping hoops if you want to bring Miss Party Killer.
You just make sure you take a fucking bath.
Oh, here they are.
Come on, sweetheart.
Give me $10.
That's right.
You enjoy your time in there.
Honey, l like that outfit.
- Oh shit!
- What's up, dawg?
My man Gideon.
Come on in, y'all, free of charge.
- Get in there, bitch.
- $10, honey. $10. l like that outfit.
Mm mm! $10.
Hey, um, l didn't get my allowance this week.
Yeah well, no one rides for free.
Get in there.
You're sucking my dick.
Oh shit, the hot squad has arrived, plus one.

Aw, relax, Meg. l'm just playing. lt's what players do.
$10, girls.
Come on.
$10, girls. $10.
Oh, you sure you want to enter the harem? lt ain't for lightweights, sweetheart.

Let's go.
Eh, remember, Meg, you want a deal, you gotta pay the man.
All right.
Come on in.
Let's go, let's go.
Move it, chunky.

Mm mm! Go on in.

Boy: Hey, Lexie, can l see your ass a little more, please?
Get the fuck out of my face!
- How about you show me your tits?
- Fuck you.
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Boy: Fuck you guys.
Get--
Leave me alone.
No, fuck you!
Okay okay, Kathy, tell me, what is your goal in life?
- To get fucked up.
- Okay.
So, uh, what are you right now?
- Pretty fucked up.
- ( laughs ) So...

- ...you've pretty much fucking achieved your life goal like already.
- Mm mm!
- Oh!
Fuck yeah.
- Yeah, fuck-- fuck yeah.
- Holy shit.
- Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.
- Holy...
How are you feeling tonight?
What's up, everybody?
Oh shit, there's my man right here.
Come on, man.
Let's check this shit out, man.
This party is off the hook.
Come here.
What's up, baby girl?
What's going on?
How do you like the party so far?
Hmm? You like that? l'll be up in the guest room.

Right there, man.
No doubt, no doubt.
Come on, man.

That's good shit right there.

You having a good time?
These are my main party girls right here, man.
What's up, girl?
What's up, pimple?
Move over. l gotta--

Ow.
Boy:
Oh shit, man!
Jesus Christ.
Aw, are you okay?
Does your head hurt?
Did you get a headache or something? l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
Aw, poor baby.
Gideon, get over here.
Check this shit out, man.
- Check this shit out.
- This is clean.
Boy: Oh, man, you need to teach her--
- You okay, girl?
- l'm-- l'm okay.
Boy: You need to teach her a couple of things, man.
Gideon: Seeing if you're okay.
You're a fine-ass bitch. l'm just-- l'm fine.
- Stop.
- You want some?
- Stop!
- Fuck you, bitch!
Boy:
Oh, man!
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Boy: Yeah.
Oh, fuck, you just got punched by a girl.
How does that feel, man?
How does that shit feel?
- ( girls laughing )
- Boy: Oh, where are you going?
What is she wearing?
Aren't you going to be late to your piano recital?
Boy:
What you looking for?
Maybe l can help you, baby.
Ben:
Get over here.
Boy: Oh shit, dude!
You want some of this, honor student?
Boy:
Oh, baby.
You're all jacked up.
Oh, man.
Boy:
Okay okay.
Motherfucker.
Close the door, man.
Close the door.
Ahh!
Boy: Hey, Lexie, why don't you do something sexy or something?
Like what?
Boy:
Make out or something.
Oh yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
We don't make out for hired help.
Well, fuckin' do something.
Jesus.
All right, watch this.
Boy:
Oh, man. Aw shit.
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?
- Lexie: Oh my God!
- ( laughter )
- Boy: Oh God.
- Lexie: Fuck you!
- Boy: She's wasted.
- Boy #2 : She is wasted.
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey. Are you okay?
- l'm so stupid.
- No, you're not. lt was my fault. l shouldn't have brought you there.
- Now all your friends hate me.
- So what?
Fuck them.
They're just shit.
- l'm such a loser.
- No, you're not. l'm like nothing.
No, l want you to shut up about that. l don't know why you're friends with me.
Well, because l am, that's why.
Look, l'm the big fucking loser. l was the one blowing some dickhead for a hit.
That did look kind of gross.
- Yeah, it tasted gross.
- Ew. l don't think l could ever do that.
- l'd be way too embarrassed.
- Why? lt's like a power thing.
You're in charge.
Oh, you really looked like you were in charge.
No, l'm serious.
Like, the guy can't come unless you let him. l don't know.
Well, you know, someday you're going to do it. l'll probably screw that up too.
- Well, just practice before.
- Practice?
- Yeah.
- Like how?
Like on anything.
Like a banana.
Try not to leave teeth marks.
Was that how you learned?
- No.
- Tell me. l was at summer camp when l was 10.
You were 10 when you did it?
Do you want to listen to this or not?
So l was at summer camp and there was this counselor.
He was older, like 17.
He was always telling me that l was pretty and shit.
So one day he tells me to come to the pantry to like help him get paper plates.
And it's really small in there, so we're like pressed up against each other.
- Was he really hot?
- He was okay.
He looked kind of like that guy in the movie ''Se7 en.''
- Brad Pitt?
- No, the weird killer guy.
Oh. Ew.
Okay, anyways, so he's pressed up against me and l can feel it and it's like huge.
And then he just looks at me and pushes-- he puts his hand on top of my head and pushes me down to my knees
- in front of him.
- Did you scream?
No, he was really gentle.
And then he unzips his jeans and just takes it out.
- And l was like, ''Whoa.''
- What was it like? lt was like this big fat snake like staring me in the face.
- Oh my God.
- And he's like waving it around and tapping it on my nose and shit.
And he puts it against my lips. l'm like, l don't know what to do, but there's like nowhere to go, you know?
And he just keeps pushing, and l think at some point l opened my mouth to say something like,
''Get that smelly thing out of my face,'' and he just shoved it in.
- Did you choke?
- Yeah, because it was huge.
My mouth was wide open like this. Like--
Oh wow.
And l was starting to turn blue because l couldn't breathe.
And he tells me to breathe through my nose and l do.
And snot starts coming out of my nose.
- Oh my God.
- But it wasn't funny. l was like blowing my nose all over his dick.
And he's like pumping it in and out, back and forth in my mouth and grabbing my hair.
Did you-- oh my God.
- Did you scream?
- No.
He told me a couple of times actually to get my teeth out of the way, but like where the fuck were they supposed to go?
- You know?
- Yeah. l mean like there wasn't any room in there for his dick and my teeth.
Oh.
So he just keeps pumping and grabbing my hair.
And at some point l look up and l can see that he's going to come, because, you know, guys look really stupid before they come.
Mm-hmm.
Like how?
Like, their faces get all scrunchy and they look like they're taking a shit or something.
Oh my God.
So he's doing all this weird shit with his face.
Mm-hmm.
And all of a sudden there's like this explosion in my mouth and all this hot gooey stuff starts coming out.
- Did you swallow any of it?
- Yeah. l swallowed a lot of it because l didn't have a choice. l mean there was like a gallon of it and it just kept coming.
And he's like grabbing my head so l couldn't move or anything, right?
And like l started coughing and it just started coming out of my nose and the sides of my mouth, like probably my ears.
- Oh. Did it taste totally gross?
- lt was like--
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Who are you talking to? lt's Amy. l was talking to Amy.
Jesus Christ. lt's me, Miss Stewart.
Sorry. lt's late.
Go to sleep, Megan.
Sorry, Meg.
Sorry. l-- l hate it here. l hate it so much. l have to get out of here.
Where would you go? l don't care.
Well, if you go anywhere, l'm going with you.
- Really?
- Yeah. You're my best friend.
Really? l don't know what l'd do without you.
Well, you're my best friend too, Amy.
- Really?
- You're my only real friend.
Miss Stewart:
Megan, go to sleep now!
Maybe we'll run away together, go far away somewhere like Texas or something.
Why Texas? l don't know.
Sounds far away.
Okay. Texas.
Texas.
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Meg.
Tada! And here we are, the stars of the hour on Amy's new video camera.
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.
Yeah, well, mine love me too, slut.
Bitch.
- Okay okay, what should we do?
- l don't know.
We can make a documentary about my cat, like ''A Day in the Life of Charlie'' or something.
- Are you for real?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, let's do something, you know, like not boring.
Ooh, l know.
Why don't you strip? l'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, that's right.
We said not boring.
Shut up.
You strip then.
- Fine, l will.
- No no no no no.
What if my parents see this by accident?
Well, your dad's pretty hot. l so did not hear that.
Okay, why don't we do an interview, like your life's story?
- Okay.
- Okay, you go first.
Okay.
Okay, start with your name and birthday.
Hello. My name is Megan Stewart and l was born on August 1 2th, 1992. l go to Alton High School where l am an honor student. l am a Leo which means l'm generous and warm-hearted-- do you want to not laugh, bitch? l am also faithful and loving and creative and broad-minded.
Well, then l say that last part's true.
Okay, so what else?
Um, l live with my mom who loves me very much. l am her pride and joy.
My dad-- my real dad-- is somewhere-- l don't know, l don't know-- doing something.
My stepfather's name is Paul.
He's in prison.
He fucked me for the first time when l was nine.
And he kept on fucking me for two years.
My mom was so afraid of losing him that she wouldn't-- she wouldn't even listen to me when l told her about it.
She even blamed me when he got sent to prison.
Guys like me.
They've always liked me. l'm... a likable girl, l guess. l'll pretty much do what you want, but you have to tell me that you love me.
They're all so fucking pathetic.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey.
- What the hell is that?
- lt's my stuffed animal.
- lt's cute.
- Oh, it's adorable.
Yeah, l know.
- So are you going to go tonight?
- l don't know.
There's never anything but losers there.
Yeah well, l've met some pretty cool guys there like Jorge.
Okay, l hate to break it to you, but Jorge's not cool.
Whatever.
He's fun to hang out with.
- No.
- And so are you. l mean, maybe sometime you want to hang out again?
Um, Lex, l'm just not like comfortable with what happened before.
- Yeah, no. lt's okay.
- lt's just not me, you know?
No, l understand.
That's fine.
Um, actually l've been talking to this new guy named Josh.
- He's really cool.
- Oh yeah? What makes him cool?
He skateboards and he goes to Tolland
- and he competes for real stuff.
- Oh really?
And he saw that l like skateboarding and so he added me.
- You don't skateboard.
- Whatever.
Guys dig it when chicks are skateboarders.
Lex! Oh my God.
Oh, you should check it out. lt's Skaterdude.
- Okay.
- ( keyboard clicking )
Doesn't he look like Brad Pitt?
A little in the eyes, l guess.
Does Josh have a cam?
He does, but his little brother like busted it or something crazy, so... l don't know.
But-- ooh, one time he met
George Clooney in person.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.
Oh my God.
And he like talked to him for like an hour at this mall and--
- What mall?
- l don't know.
We should like go and stalk him or something.
Yeah. That's funny.
- But you should talk to him.
- Okay, maybe.
Maybe if l'm bored l'll go. l don't know.
Okay. Well then, l'll talk to you later.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Bye.
Hello, my name's Amy Herman and today's January 1 3th, 2007, and this is my video diary.
This is my room.
As you can see, it's very neat and clean, because l believe cleanliness is next to godliness.
This is Mr. Rupert.
He's in charge of all the rest of the animals and he makes sure that they all behave when l'm gone. l love him, but he's not my favorite bear.
My favorite bear is Billy Bear.
He's not here anymore.
This is my best friend Megan.
We go on all kinds of crazy adventures.
We're pretty wild together.
We're like sisters. l just love her.
As you can see, l live in a pretty nice house.
We live in an area called Sherman Oaks. lf you're not from Los Angeles, you have no idea what l'm talking about.
But there it is.
- This is my mom Louise.
- Amy, what are you doing? lt's my video diary.
You want to tape me rushing around, trying to get dinner ready?
Sure. lt's real life.
So is doing your homework while l'm doing this.
Mom's a real estate agent as well as being a mom.
She's probably crabby because she didn't sell a house today.
- Amy.
- ( laughs )
This is my cat Charlie.
He's really old.
He's actually older than me, which makes him like 100 in cat years.
That's really old.
This is my backyard.
This is our barbecue.
When the weather's nice, we'll barbecue and my parents will invite some friends over for a party.
My dad's not here.
He works long hours, but he always makes sure to be here on my birthday and other important holidays.
Well, that's my house.
Thanks for joining me on the tour.
Bye.
- Josh: Hello, hot chick.
- Hi, Skaterdude.
- ( laughs ) My name's Josh.
- l know.
How did you know that?
My friend Lexie gave me your address.
Well, that was nice of her.
- So what's your name?
- Megan.
Nice name. l'm just checking your profile.
So you go to Tolland?
Yeah, when l go to school at all.
The teachers suck there.
They do at Alton too.
Oh, Alton.
So we live near each other.
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
You should come skateboarding sometime. l don't board. l'll watch.
Where do you board?
Usually down by the ravine in the back of the diner.
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.
Yeah, l'm around there all the time.
Cool.
Hey, can you tilt your webcam down a little?
Why? l don't know.
Just because.
Oh my God, all guys are the same.
What? l'm not putting on a show for you, freak.
- No! l didn't mean it like that.
- Then what? l don't know. l'm-- nothing. l'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
- How's that?
- Mm, much better.
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.
So your cam is broken, huh?
Yeah, my fucking dog chomped on it. l thought your little brother broke it.
Yeah, he did, and then my dog took a swipe at it too.
Wow, sucks to be you.
Damn, you're a firecracker.
That's right.
Gotta watch myself around you, huh?
Uh-huh.
Ah... l like that.
Too many girls just roll over-- like no challenge.
You know a lot of girls, huh?
No. l'm into quality, not quantity.
Yeah, l'm sure. l've heard that one before. l'm serious.
No bullshit.
Yeah well, maybe.
- Maybe what?
- Just maybe.
So you going to the party tonight?
- l don't know.
- Hmm.
At least you get to see what l look like. l already know what you look like.
How? l have an imagination.
Oh no.
Lexie gave you my picture, didn't she?
- Maybe.
- Oh my God, busted!
You're such a stalker. l am not! l just-- never mind.
Ah. No, that's cool. l like knowing some chick thinks l'm dope. l didn't say l thought you were dope.
Maybe a dope.
Oh my God.
You've got a mouth on you, a nice one too.
- You think so?
- Mm, hell yeah.
Aw.
Now you're torturing Skaterdude.
- ( laughs )
- Aw, poor baby.
You're a cool chick.
You should come tonight.
We should hook up.
Maybe.
Come on, l'll be hanging with my buds by the kitchen.
- You gonna come?
- Maybe.
Mm, okay, Maybe Megan.
- Well, l hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.
- All right. Bye, hot chick.
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hey.
Where are you going?
Um, l decided at the last minute to go to Tracy's party.
Oh, l thought you weren't going to go.
Yeah, it's just l was talking to this kind of cool guy and he's going to be there, so l thought l'd check him out.
Oh, okay.
So, yeah. l'll call you tomorrow?
Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, video diary. lt's me, Amy, again.
Yeah, like who else would it be? l was going through some magazines the other day because l want to find a nice dress for my prom.
My prom's not for four years away, but l figured if-- if someone asked me to his, then l should be prepared.
Hell, like who's going to ask me, right?
Fuck you.
- ( beeps )
- Yeah?
Hey.
Amy? What time is it?
- ln the morning?
- Jesus Christ, Amy.
- Sorry. l was just wondering how it went with that guy.
- Was he cool?
- He wasn't there, fucking dork.
- l looked for him for four hours.
- That's too bad.
- What was his name?
- Josh, Josh the jerk.
Okay, well, what are you doing later?
- Sleeping.
- After that?
That's it.
Well, let's go to a movie or something.
- Okay, call me later.
- Okay. Good night.
Bye.
- ( computer chimes )
- Josh: Hey, hot chick.
How would you know?
Uh-oh, you sound pissed.
Oh no, why would l be pissed?
Just because some jerk tells me to meet him at a party and then never shows up?
Why would l be pissed?
- l was there.
- No, you weren't. l was at that party for four hours, buddy. lf you were there, then you're the invisible man. l looked like an idiot.
Well, l thought you looked great.
- And how would you know?
- Because l was there.
Okay. lf you were there, then what was l wearing?
Uh, well, you had on a really sexy little jean skirt and a black top with gold trim and, um, black high-heeled kind of sandals.
And l think you had a butterfly clip in your hair.
- You were there.
- Yeah, l told you.
Well, then why didn't you come up to me? l saw you looking around. l figured you were probably looking for me.
Yeah, l was.
And you looked so great. l mean you looked incredible. l totally felt my heart skip a beat when l saw you. l guess l just wimped out.
So you watched me?
Yeah. Kind of creepy, huh?
No. lt's kind of nice.
Yeah, l saw you talking with your friends.
You're really popular. l didn't want to barge in and mess things up.
- You're shy.
- Mm, sometimes. lt's okay. l get shy too sometimes.
Hmm. You seem like you're always in control.
No. Sometimes l just don't know what to do, so l usually do something stupid.
Hey well, Stupid is my middle name.
Anyway, l am sorry l didn't talk to you last night. lt's okay. l understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
But l do wish l could have met you.
Yeah. Well, there were just so many people and stuff and it was like l didn't know that many people
- and l felt weird and--
- Yeah. Yeah, l understand.
So anyway, what are you doing today?
Oh, nothing much.
Me and my friend Amy are going to go see the new Matt Damon movie.
Matt Damon.
You like Matt Damon, huh?
Yeah. What's not to like? l don't know.
He looks kind of gay to me.
- l don't think so.
- Hmm.
- Well, l bet he can't skateboard.
- You're jealous.
Of him? Nah.
Yes, you are!
Admit it!
Why would l be jealous of Matt Damon? l don't know.
You tell me.
Well, maybe because he gets to spend time with you today and l don't.
Well, you could if you ask me.
Okay, then l'm asking you.
- Asking me what?
- ( laughing )
Wow, you don't make this easy, do you?
- Hey, l'm worth fighting for.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah, you are.
Thank you.
So, Megan, after your date with Matt Damon, would you like to meet up and maybe get some ice cream or something?
Yes, l would.
Cool.
Well, that was easy.
The movie will be over around like 7:00.
So do you want to meet us at the theater?
Uh, you know, l'd love to meet your friend and everything--
Yeah yeah, it's okay.
Um, why don't you web me later around like 7:30?
Okay, that sounds good.
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hey.
Hey. Guess who l was just talking to.
- Lexie?
- No. Josh.
Josh, as in Josh the big fat jerk who stood you up Josh?
No no, he's not a jerk.
He was just shy.
- For four hours?
- Okay, so he's very shy.
But listen, l was just talking to him and he's really sensitive.
What did he say?
Well, we were talking about lots of stuff and, get this, he remembered everything l was wearing last night.
Wow. So what are you going to do? l'm going to see him tonight after the movie.
He's going to web me later.
Hey, you want to come over and say hello?
Um, if you don't think that's going to be weird.
Um, no.
He's really cool about stuff.
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.
Hey.
Okay, there he is.
Okay, be cool.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hello?
Josh: Hey, Megan.
How was the movie?
- Oh, it was okay.
- Hey, who's that?
- Hey, l'm Megan's best friend Amy.
- Hi, Amy. l think l might have seen you around school before.
- l thought you go to Tolland.
- Yeah, l do, when l go to school.
But sometimes l just like to hang out at Alton because the girls are prettier.
- And don't you forget it.
- ( Josh chuckles )
So what do you look like?
Oh, Megan didn't show you my pic?
- l don't remember if she did.
- Yes, you do, bitch!
- Don't listen to her, Josh.
- That's okay. l-- l have another one here l was going to send you anyway since my web's broken.
Here it comes.
Hold on.
- Oh, you didn't tell me you surf.
- Yeah, totally.
The waves are awesome this time of year because of the currents coming up from Mexico.
- Does it get cold?
- Nah, l wear a wetsuit.
And also the adrenaline keeps you warm.
- That sounds really cool.
- Yeah.
So are you two doing something tonight?
Oh, no.
Actually Amy was just leaving.
Bye, Amy.
See you in school tomorrow.
Bye. l saw that, Amy.
So, alone at last.
So you still want to meet up and do something?
- Sure. Where?
- l don't know.
Why don't we meet behind the diner in like 20 minutes?
- Behind the diner-- how romantic.
- ( laughs )
Well, if you want to meet somewhere else--
No, l'm kidding. l'm sorry. l can be kind of a smart-ass sometimes.
Ah, no problemo. l know how to deal with smart-asses.
- Oh? And how is that?
- You'll see.
See? lt's always the quiet ones you have to worry about.
- l would never hurt you, Megan.
- l know.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes. l trust you too.
So see you in like 20 minutes.
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Cool. Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hello?
- Hey, Kathy, it's Amy.
- l know.
What l don't know is why you're calling me. l was just wondering if you talked to Megan today.
No, l haven't.
Um, l'm kind of busy, so l'm going to go, okay?
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- ( beeps )
- Hello?
- Hey, Lexie.
- Hi.
Are you sure you didn't dial the wrong number? l know you don't like me, but l was just wondering if you saw Megan in history class today.
Huh-uh.
Well, l-- l gotta go.
- But--
- Bye.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey. Who's this?
- lt's Amy. l met you yesterday. l'm Megan's best friend.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
How's it going?
Not so good.
Have you heard from Megan at all?
No, l was going to ask you the same thing.
We were supposed to get together last night and she never showed up.
She hasn't been at school all day.
She hasn't called me at all.
Mm, well, l haven't seen her. l mean do you guys talk all the time?
Yeah, like every hour.
This is so weird.
You know, maybe she went somewhere with her mom.
No, Megan and her mom don't get along. l don't know, Amy. l mean we talked and l thought we got along great.
- And then she never showed up.
- Okay.
Well, if you hear from her, will you web me?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Josh.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- ( newscast music playing )
- News anchor: ln America a child disappears every 40 seconds.
The police need your help to solve these crimes.
Over 2,000 times a day somewhere a mother cries out:
Tonight on ''Missing'': a beautiful teenage girl, a desperate mother...
She's a good girl.
Just don't hurt her.
News anchor:
...and a mysterious disappearance. l don't know. One day she just didn't show up for school. ls she a runaway or is she the victim of foul play?
No matter which way you look at the facts, one fact remains:
Good evening. l'm Callie Daniels.
Megan Stewart, a beautiful popular 14-year-old girl vanished without a trace after going out with friends two days ago.
Police have no leads in the baffling disappearance of one of Alton High School's most popular students.
Megan Stewart is by all accounts one of the shining stars of Alton High School-- a straight-A student who devotes her spare time to helping her community and her friends.
She's popular with students and faculty alike.
Megan Stewart is a role model for many of our students here.
She's active in her community and a very good student.
Megan's mother, Joyce Stewart, gave this statement. l-- l just want her to be brought back safe to the people who love her and miss her.
We asked her friends if they thought Megan ran away.
- Megan would never run away.
- No. She's like my best friend.
And if something was wrong in her life, she would tell us.
She would totally.
Whether a runaway, abduction or other form of foul play, the one fact remains that this beautiful young girl disappeared without a trace.
Police are asking for your help.
Megan Stewart is 5'1'',
105 lbs with dark hair and hazel eyes.
She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a maroon blouse. lf you know anything regarding the whereabouts of this young girl, please contact
North Hollywood Police or you can send anonymous tips to findmegan.com.
Police are also looking for clues in the disappearance of 1 3-year-old Tercel Jackson who was abducted from his home in Crenshaw yesterday afternoon.
Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Crenshaw Police Department.
We will be right back with more on the disappearance and search for Megan Stewart after these messages. lt's been four days since l've heard from Megan. l don't think she ran away.
That's what all the news people are saying. l don't know what happened, but l'm worried.
This is so weird. l keep expecting her to call me any second. l sleep with my cell phone next to my pillow. l know she's alive. l can feel it.
A stunning break in the case of missing teenager Megan Stewart.
Police today released security camera footage from the back of a diner just one mile from where she lived.
The footage clearly shows that she encounters a man who appears to lead her away.
Sergeant Jon Simonelli of District 33 Police Department had this statement.
Well, we got a lucky break in the case.
We obtained some surveillance footage.
And on the videotape it appears as if she's waiting for someone.
Whether the man she walked away with was the individual she was waiting for
- is still under investigation.
- So you think she may be a runaway.
Well, we're looking at all possibilities at the moment.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the North Hollywood
Police Department.
And when we return, a pure-bred cocker spaniel accidentally drives his owner's car through a store window.
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, cute girl.
Don't say that. l wouldn't say it if it weren't true.
You don't think you're cute?
- l do.
- l'm all right.
Mm, l think you're sexy. l think you're one sexy girl.
Was that you in the video?
What, that security video?
That was some old dude.
- So you didn't see her there?
- No. l think maybe she skipped out with that guy before l got there.
You know, she seems kind of flaky.
She wouldn't do that.
She would have told me.
So you two are really close, huh?
Yeah, we are. lt's funny, you don't seem like the kind of girl she would hang with.
- What do you mean?
- You know what l mean.
Just look at yourself.
You know exactly what l mean.
No, l don't.
You just said l was sexy.
Then you're stupid too.
You'll believe anything, won't you? l think you know where she is.
Trying to change the conversation won't change the facts, Amy.
What facts?
That you're fat, that you have no friends, that no one finds you attractive.
- l have friends.
- ( laughs )
You have one friend who left and didn't tell you where she was going because she didn't want you tagging along.
No, that's not true.
Would you like to have friends, Amy?
Would you like to sleep with something besides your teddy bear?
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you hug your teddy bear, Amy, and pretend he's some guy you like
- who's never going to talk to you?
- Shut up.
Because you're some loser who won't spread her legs?
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know who l am. l know exactly who you are, Amy.
Megan told me all about you-- how pathetic you are, how you follow her around like a little puppy.
You're like a big joke to her.
- What did you do to Megan?
- Nothing.
Nothing she didn't do with 100 guys before.
Today on ''Missing,'' new revelations in the case of Megan Stewart, the North Hollywood teenager who disappeared over two weeks ago.
Police were given a statement by 14-year-old Amy Herman, a close friend of the missing girl.
Reporter:
What did you tell the police? l just told them about someone
Megan was chatting with online.
- What's this person's name?
- Had she met with this man before? l'm sorry, but that information is vital to the ongoing investigation.
Well, now that you've come forward, do you fear for your own life?
All right, that's it.
No more questions for now.
We have confirmed that Amy Herman mentioned a man named Josh who apparently met Megan Stewart in a chat room using the nickname Skaterdude.
A complete chronology of the investigation can be found at our website: findmegan.com.
We'll be back after these messages.
Let me take you on a tour of some of the places
Megan and l would go to. l keep thinking l'll see her somewhere. l keep hoping l do, at least.
This is a diner.
We always used to come here after school.
- What are you doing?
- Get that camera out of my face. l'm not recording you guys. l'm making a video diary for myself.
About how you messed up
Megan's life, huh?
No--
You know it's because of you that she's not here, right?
That's not true.
What are you going to do, sell this?
Are you going to sell this to the news?
No, l'm-- l'm not going to sell this to anyone.
You know what?
Stay the fuck out of my face, bitch.
- As you can see l'm very well liked.
- Hey!
You know that this is all your fault, right?
You think you're hot shit because she spent every waking moment with you?
- No, l--
- ls that what you think? l don't think that.
Fuck.
She loved me!
And l-- l loved her back. l loved her so much!
And now she's gone because of you!
This is all your fault and l can't fix it.
There's nothing l can fucking do.
Get the fuck out of my face.
This is all your fault.
Amy: Megan and l used to come under this bridge and just talk about stuff. l remember one time when it just started to rain and then it started to pour.
All of a sudden the entire river was flooded.
We didn't want to tell anyone about it.
We thought people might think we were stupid. l guess we kind of were.
Megan's so adventurous.
She's not afraid to try things and she doesn't care what other people think about her. l wish l was more like her. l'm going to show you something.
This is Billy Bear. l've had him since l was like five.
Three years ago my mom wanted me to get rid of him because he was all ragged, but l just couldn't.
So l keep him here and l can visit him whenever l want.
People keep saying how this experience is supposed to help me grow up, but... l don't understand that. lf anything, it's making me not want to grow up.
There's so much weirdness out there. l'd just-- l'd just rather stay here with Billy.
Who is this?
- Josh: l think you know.
- Josh?
You have a big mouth. l didn't say you kidnapped Megan.
No. You just said you think l did.
Well, if you didn't, you have nothing to worry about. l don't have anything to worry about.
They can't find me.
You can set up free screen names anywhere.
What do you want from me? l want you to shut your big fucking mouth.
And if you still feel like yakking to the police, l may have to pay you a visit or your mom. l'm watching you, Amy.
Tonight a special
''Megan is Missing'' reenactment based on analysis of the original security camera footage.
We must warn you that some material may be too intense for younger viewers.
Well, we're filming the reenactment of an abduction and we're doing it actually on the exact location where the girl was abducted.
You want to find the truth and we believe an accurate reenactment in the same location might bring about some clues that the police really haven't been able to touch on themselves. l-- l just-- l think this is so important.
And l want to do anything l could do to help out. l mean l can't even imagine that this happened. lt is difficult playing someone as awful as this, but you look past your personal feelings and just try to make it real for the audience.
When l was a lot younger l spent a lot of time on the internet. lt's not a safe space.
As much as you feel safe in your own home, you're not safe.
And now a ''Megan is Missing'' exclusive reenactment.
Hey, Mom, it's me. l'm going to go to the store and get some groceries for breakfast.
So l'll see you soon. Bye.
You're trespassing.
Come with me.
Stop! No, please!
Please!
Stop! Stop!
The brutal abduction of a beautiful young girl.
We'll be right back. lt's been three weeks now. l can feel the people searching for Megan are starting to give up.
They're not trying anymore and it's really hard to get volunteers. l think that they might think she's dead.
Maybe l do too.
Tonight a shocking twist in the case of Megan Stewart.
The missing girl's best friend,
Amy Herman, has now vanished.
Are the girls the victims of the same kidnapper or have they simply run away together?
Detective Jon Simonelli had this to say.
Obviously the coincidence of both girls, who were friends, disappearing is enormous.
We're working all possible scenarios at this time.
A baffling case that grows more bizarre by the hour.
We'll be right back. lt has been two days since the disappearance of 15-year-old Amy Herman and 23 days since her best friend Megan Stewart was abducted behind a local diner.
Their friends have started a campaign to persuade everyone to tie pink ribbons on trees as a symbol of hope.
We're doing this pink ribbon campaign to let Megan know that we love her and we miss her.
And hopefully it'll make whoever took her, you know, feel bad and let her go.
Yvette: Search parties continue to examine the wooded area surrounding the two girls' homes for any leads as to their whereabouts.
Earlier today l spoke with Amy's parents.
We'd like to thank all the volunteers that have spent so many hours searching for Amy.
We believe in our hearts that she's well and that she will be returned to us.
Princess, if you can-- if you can hear me, we love you and we're praying for you.
Chief, we've got something here.
Frank, get the camera.
Get the camera, Frank.
Man: Tell those guys to stop.
Hold up. Hold up right there.
- ( Amy screams )
- ( banging )
Help!
Somebody help!
Somebody please!
Please!
Please help!
Please, help me!
Help me!
Why are you doing this to me?
Please.
Where is Megan?
- ls she here?
- Josh: Yes, she's here. l want to see her. l want to talk to her.
You'll see her when l say you can see her.
You're crazy.
Let me go! l'm going to let you go... but only if you behave yourself.
No. No, l want to go home.
Please let me go home.
Please.
Please!
Josh, where are you going?
You're crazy!
Please! Josh!
Please! l want to go home!
Help!
Help!
Somebody! No!
You're crazy!
My name's not Josh, bitch.
You're crazy!
Amy:
No! No!
No! Help me!

Just give me a chance.
Josh.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do? l'll prove it. l'll do anything-- anything in the whole world. l'll do anything. l'll never call my family again. l don't need Billy. l won't ever want him again. l won't ever ask for him. l'll eat anything you give me. l don't care.
Just open it once.
Please, just-- just open it once?
Amy: So l can show you how much l love you. l love you. l love you, Josh. l don't know if anyone else has ever told you that, but l mean it. l really do. l know we can love each other.

No one will care for you as much as me.

Goes mommy-- daddy shark, right?
So daddy shark? l only know grandpa shark.
But l don't know how it goes.
How does it go?
Okay, it goes . Dad-- mommy shark, do do do, do do do .
- . Grandpa shark, do do do, do do do. .
- ( laughing )
- l don't know any other ones.
- And then the sharks eat you.
- No, the sharks don't eat you.
- Yeah, they do. l don't know who taught you, but you don't learn right.
- l don't learn right?
- Yeah.
- l learn just fine.
- Sure, you do. l learn differently than you do.
- Smelling your hair?
- Mm-hmm.
- ( laughing )
- My hair smells good.
What does it smell like?
What does it smell like in French?
- lt smells so good l can't even--
- What does it smell like in French?
- Like flowers.
- Ha!
Mm.
- You're crazy.
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, l guess we're both crazy.
- Mm.
So what do you want to be when you grow up? l am grown up, you dork.
You know what l mean-- in the future.
Uh, l say fuck the future.
What was that movie?
Where the guy said that to the other guy and--
Oh, yeah, and then the guy said...
Both:
''The future fucks you.''
- That was funny.
- Yeah.
So what do you want to be?
- l want to be you.
- You don't want to be me.
Yeah, l do.
That'd be so cool.
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, then l would be you.
- No, you don't want to be me.
- That'd be boring beyond belief.
- Shut up. l'm serious. Boring.
Well, at least your mom and dad are around and they love you. l'm sure your mom loves you too. l think we're going to have amazing lives.
- Really?
- Yeah.
We're going to go to different countries and eat strange foods just like all those dorky
TV channels you watch.
- Documentary channels aren't dorky.
- Okay, if you say so.
- Shut up.
- ( laughs )
And we're going to meet guys with strange foreign accents, handsome dangerous guys who are like international spies or something.
- Amy: ln Venice, ltaly.
- Why Venice?
Well, it's more romantic than Texas.
- Fuck you!
- ( laughs ) lt was all l could think of at the time, okay?
- ( laughs )
- Meg?
Do you really think l'll meet someone...
- Yeah, you will.
- ...someday?
- Yeah.
- When? lt'll happen.
Don't rush it.
Well, you meet guys all the time.
Not the right ones.
How do you know what the right one is?
- He'll be honest.
- Mm-hmm.
He'll treat me like l'm special.
He'll be a little shy, but he'll be cool, so... l don't know. l'll just know.
We'll know when the right guy comes along.
- Okay.
- ( both chuckle )
Watch out!
You... Um... Your light.
What? Oh! I'm such a moron!
How's the flick?
Ah, you know, Adam Sandler gets in a mess.
Wife gets pissed. Rinse and repeat.
Predictable. Formulaic.
- Fart jokes. You wouldn't like it.
- Hmm.
How would you know what I like?
I wouldn't know.
Well, maybe you should find out sometime.
Oh, shit! What the...
Hey, Hal! Hey...
What the hell?
Hal?
What the... What the hell's going on?
Kim?
Hey! Hey! Hey, you.
Everyone's gone. They're all gone.
Got anyone in the theaters?
No, man. I haven't seen a soul.
Jeez! Same down in the food court.
You know what happened?
We're on backup power.
Heading down to maintenance to find out more.
We're being Punk'd, right?
Oh, yeah.
Allen Funt is gonna pop out any minute.
- Who?
- Forget it.
The hell is that?
What did you see?
Wait here.
Who's there?
You see something?
Huh?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Where is everyone?
Anybody here?
Hey! Hello?
Help me.
Someone help me.
No!
Manny. Manny.
My baby. Manny!
Paige?
I waited for you.
You here?
Paige?
Son of a...
What the hell is going on here?
Twenty-three goddamn flights.
Piece of junk.
Yo, Jesus, what's up with the...
This is yesterday's.
Paige?
Paige?
Paige?
Anyone?
Where are you?
Damn it!
Hello?
Somebody there?
Shit!
Hey!
Open the door!
Open up the fucking door, man!
Hey, man, I need... I need a light.
They're all spent.
Give me one of your lights, man.
Open the door.
Give me one of your lights. Please.
God damn!
Hello, little boy
Don't you remember me?
Hello, little boy
Don't you remember me?
Well, I'm the same one that brought you from Tennessee
I said, "You came to the city
Got me in your heart"
Now don't forget that I'm the one who put you wise
Please don't high jive me, baby
I ain't the jiving kind
No, don't high jive me, daddy
I ain't the jiving kind
'Cause you'll find I'm hip and you'll up and lose your mind
Down in Tennessee, you was ragged and beat
Walking around barefooted drinking sneaky Pete
Don't get me started
I know just what to do
If you make me mad
I'll tell the whole world about you
Don't move.
Put the gun on the floor.
It's a flashlight.
Just put it on the floor.
You mean this gun?
Put or drop?
Put the fucking gun on the ground!
Come on, the light, too.
You want me to turn it off?
The light, too! Now!
All right.
Okay. What now?
Why don't you just lower that barrel a little, we'll talk this shit out, huh?
Can I at least have my drink?
Is that permitted?
Hey! God damn it!
Go on! Shoot me! Do it!
Shoot me!
You're afraid to.
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.
You shoot me, there's nobody left. Right?
Right.
What's your name?
What's your name?
James.
James. Like Jesse James.
Gun and all.
I'm Luke.
I've seen your face.
Oh, yeah?
TV.
That's right.
News 7. I'm the new field reporter.
You're always yelling at people with the microphone.
Look, James. Here's the truth.
I'm just happy to see another face.
You know what I mean?
Why don't you put the gun down and we'll have ourselves a drink.
Come on, I'm buying.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where'd you find this?
It's my mom's.
She keeps it under the bar.
- Your mom owns this place?
- Nah. Bartender.
She around?
Up the street.
Went to check the light in the church.
- Light?
- Yeah.
A guy came by saying he saw a light in that church.
A guy? How long ago?
He's gone now.
You got a nice generator down there.
How much gas you got left?
I don't know.
My mom told me to keep feeding it every few hours, though.
You a strong kid, Jesse James?
Strong enough.
Good. Drink up.
You're gonna need it.
Why?
Here. Batteries work.
You're gonna help us get us both out of here.
I'm not going nowhere.
I've got to wait for my mom.
She just went up the street to the church.
She told me to stay right here.
We need to get out of this city.
You understand?
I'm not going nowhere.
We're moving out when she comes back with some people.
What people? There are no people.
Don't matter. She told me she'd be back.
Have you taken a look outside lately, James?
It's, like, 11:00 in the morning.
And it's fucking pitch black!
I've been out there for the last three days.
And every day the sun comes up later and goes down sooner.
Every day, less daylight.
More people are just gone!
You understand what I'm saying?
I don't think your mom's coming back.
- Yes, she is!
- No, she's not.
Now, I don't know what in Christ is going on here, but I'm not hanging around in this dump to find out.
You wanna just wait till the gas is up in that genny, knock yourself out. I'm out of here.
Fair exchange. Good luck.
I'm serious, all right? I'm going.
- I'm gone.
- Then go, motherfucker, go!
Where is he?
Manny, baby, it's Mama. Manny!
What'd he do with my Manny?
Come on.
Hey, lady.
- Please, you've seen my Manny?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- My baby.
- I don't know, I don't know.
Randy, where you at?
Hey, lady, there's nobody else here, all right?
Randy! Randy!
He took my baby.
I know he took my baby.
Look, I'm real sorry for your...
- Get away from my baby!
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Where's my baby?
- Don't you point that gun at me!
- Where's my baby?
- God damn it!
Help me. Help me.
So, how'd you get this far without a light?
You didn't have one when you came in here.
How old are you?
Twelve-and-a-half.
Manny's nine months today.
That's your boy?
Yeah.
I'm James.
That's Luke.
Rosemary.
You a doctor?
Dr. Williamson, please report to the ER.
Dr. Williamson, please report to the ER.
Gloria?
Manny? Manny!
Please... God...
You a doctor?
Physical therapist.
Manny's dad comes here to drink, so I thought that...
I thought that he took our baby here.
I...
It's okay.
You're okay.
I do have light.
I got a lot of lights.
The batteries kept dying in my flashlight.
These last.
Why does the power work here?
Backup generator.
Won't last, though.
You're the first people I've seen in two days.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why us?
Why are we the ones left behind?
Just stay close to the light.
Just stay in the light, all right?
Help! Help!
Help!
Someone help me!
Sounds like he's hurt.
Bad luck for him.
What? We can't just leave him.
Someone help me, please!
Go get him, then.
- I'll go.
- No. No.
- You stay here. I'll go.
- Give it to me. Move.
Lock the door.
Then open it when you hear me coming.
Fast!
Come on, let's get inside.
- Help me!
- Shh.
Help me! Help me!
All right.
- Come on. You're coming with me.
- No! No!
- It's all right, it's okay.
- No! No!
Come on.
- They're here. They're here.
- No, it's just me.
They're here.
Shit!
Come on! Not now.
They're here.
They're out there. They're here.
Here.
All right, come on. One more time.
Mama.
What are you doing?
I got to find my ma.
I got to go. She's waiting for me!
We have to stay in the light. I'm sorry.
He ain't coming back, is he?
We're almost there.
No!
Come on!
Hey!
Hey! Open the door!
Open the door!
Come on! The lights! Hurry up!
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
What, am I in heaven?
Better.
A bar.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
- No, lie still. Just...
- I gotta go.
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?
My name is Paul. Paul.
- Paul, that's my name.
- Good.
You have a concussion.
So we need to keep talking. Okay?
- Okay.
- Right.
That light.
How'd you get there?
I...
I was working at the Fairlane Center.
And the whole mall went dark.
I mean, all the people were all gone.
So, I was... I was on my way out of there, when my light starts dying.
And then someone came out of the dark and hit me.
I was taken somewhere.
And then my light came back on.
And I was outside.
I don't even know how I got there, but I...
I walked till I found that bus shelter.
Taken?
Taken.
I don't know where.
I don't know where.
But there were these voices.
These whispers.
No bodies. No faces.
Souls.
Only shadows.
And I was drowning in them.
So I started screaming. Started screaming.
But there was no sound.
There was no sound.
It was like I was fighting, fighting for air.
Like I was fighting to exist.
Sounds like some kind of fever dream.
No. Dreams are much more broken apart, more obscure.
- I was taken some place for three days.
- I'm gonna keep you warm.
This was in real time.
So, did you get a look at the guy that hit you?
I told you. I told you it wasn't a person.
You saw it, too, didn't you?
I knew it.
When I was lying there, waiting for the bus,
I had time and I went through the list of all the ways everyone could just disappear.
Flesh eating bacterias.
Nanotech running amok.
A particle collider accident.
Parallel universes.
Neutron bombs. Gamma ray bursts.
Alien abduction.
Singularities. Wormholes. Black holes.
- Stop it!
- But the thing is that the math doesn't add up.
The math does not add up.
My boy is missing.
His mother.
It just doesn't add up.
This is no accident. There's a reason.
You're gonna lay your Catholic guilt on us now?
Why are you here, Luke?
You know?
No idea. And I don't care.
Well, you should.
We all... We all should.
Why didn't we go with everyone else?
- Because...
- Why?
Like, when you shut down a movie projector, it doesn't just stop on a dime. It winds down.
We're the last spin on the reel before it stops for good.
I know I've done things in my life.
Awful things.
I've hurt people.
I've made mistakes.
We all have.
So what are you saying, that this is punishment?
For what?
- That's between you and...
- And God?
Between me and God?
I don't know, I think God's closed up shop, just like everybody else!
Don't say that!
You're trying to tell me
- that he deserves this shit, huh?
- Leave him alone!
You know, I think that you're just pissed off
- 'cause Jesus didn't beam you up!
- Stop it! No!
You know what? We don't need some fucking left behind sermon!
What we need to do is...
Oh, no!
Sweet Jesus. Sweet Jesus.
Lessen the load.
- What?
- The power load on the genny!
- You got to lessen it.
- Turn off anything we don't need.
James, get the games.
The jukebox.
Turn them off, turn them off.
Get the neon signs.
Strip the top off.
Looks like somebody rerouted it up to the bar after the main grid died.
Yeah. My ma.
At least we got plenty of gas.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
The electric charge is fading, anyway.
- Like the batteries and the flares...
- And the cars and everything.
It's just impossible.
But the bus shelter? The one you were under?
Solar powered.
It's experimental, one off.
The city was thinking of going green for a while. I did a piece on it.
Okay. So, solar is working.
Yeah. Too bad the sun's not.
James, where does this go?
Sonny says it's where we go when the shit hits the fan.
Sonny had a point.
All right, rocket scientist. How long?
- How long what?
- How long we got?
- How long until it dies?
- Yeah.
Couple hours, I don't know.
Couple minutes, I don't know.
I don't know. There are no known laws of physics operating here, okay?
I don't fucking know. I don't know!
Please, God.
Please, God. Please, God.
Hey, come on, take it easy.
Okay, okay.
Please, God. Please, God.
Please, God. Please, God. Help us.
There's this island.
This island right off the Carolinas, called Roanoke.
And in 1587 it was...
It was the first English colony.
117 men, women and children were living there.
Then, one day a boat comes from London with supplies.
But lo and behold, there's nobody to supply,
'cause everybody's gone.
The whole entire colony completely vanished.
Left everything behind.
Food, livestock, clothing.
They sent search parties looking for everybody for days and the only thing they find...
You know what they find? One word.
One word.
Just scratched... Scratched on a fence post.
Croatoan.
Cro... What?
Croatoan.
What does it mean?
I don't know. Nobody knows.
It's just a big mystery.
Maybe it's a message from the local Indians or...
Or a word or...
Or just a last word.
Nobody knows for sure.
But maybe it's...
Maybe it's a warning.
A warning, like an error warning your computer gives you right before it crashes.
A warning from who?
Does it really matter? Huh?
Someone just hit the restart button and...
And the lost colony was just this little warning right before the...
Right before this big reboot.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Feels like a semi smashed into my skull.
That's 'cause you think too much.
James, wet the towel, sweetie.
There we go.
We need ice.
I'm just gonna raise your head up.
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Stephen?
Is somebody here?
Control.
...news.
Reporter Luke Ryder continues his series on the storm of controversy surrounding alleged security lapses at the West Haven nuclear power plant.
Yeah, you definitely don't want to miss that.
And speaking of storms, Paige.
Well, that's right,
Carolin and Stephen, we're tracking a very large front moving in our direction.
Kind of an unusual storm...
...the good news is this low pressure system is followed by a very nice high pressure front, so things...
So things...
...defies any logical or rational explanation.
Hey. Hey!
You can't say that it's evil.
You can't say that it's human or not human.
But it is the new law of nature.
And we have to adapt.
Last night after the blackout,
I heard my brother call out to me from the darkness.
My brother died eight years ago in an automobile accident.
It can trick you.
Stay near a light source.
But do not trust any light other than the one that you hold in your own hand.
This is David Breadan, at WDID in Chicago.
If you're receiving this broadcast, then your phone service may still work.
Please, call or text me at this number.
Damn it.
- Hello?
- Luke?
All right.
We need to get out of here.
Now.
He can't go anywhere.
Don't you get it?
Why we're here?
At this exact place?
All of us?
I'll tell you why.
The light.
The light's protecting us.
Protecting us?
Ever see moths fly into a flame?
What are you trying to say?
You trying to say that this is a trap?
A trap!
A dead end.
But whatever's out there is in here now.
Point is when that genny dies, we die.
Maybe that's how it should be.
What?
All of us have seen it.
Those souls.
Out there in the dark.
How do we know they're not the people we've already lost calling us over?
How do we know that that's not heaven and this...
Is...
If my boy's with them, then that's where I'm meant to be.
And if he's not, then I ain't going nowhere till I find him.
Look, there's a truck.
I don't know, maybe five, eight blocks away.
The power's drained, but it's not dead.
Now if we can get it started, we all have a chance of getting out of here.
Maybe get you to a hospital.
Oh, yeah? A hospital. Where, man?
Where?
Chicago.
The morning after it happened,
I caught a satellite feed.
There are survivors out there. Like us.
So where are the rescue parties, huh?
I don't know.
It's been three days,
I don't see any search parties.
I don't know, all right?
All I know is I'm gonna roll that truck to this genny.
I'm gonna string some jumper cables from the genny to the truck's battery,
I'm gonna start that truck and I'm gonna get out of here, with or without any of you.
Yeah, roll? How you gonna roll it?
You can barely walk.
Then a little help would be nice.
James, we have a vehicle.
All right? We can cover more ground.
You know, maybe look for your mom.
Your son.
We can wait till morning.
You sure there's one coming?
The first couple of days, I...
You know, I...
Kept asking myself why am I still here.
Why me?
You know, just... Just... Just...
Talking to myself, running from place to place, shouting my name like an idiot.
Anything to remind me that I exist.
I'm here because I will myself to exist.
You know what? Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe this is just a passing storm.
Maybe it ends tomorrow.
You said it yourself, Paul.
A big reboot.
Which means that this could all be a new beginning, right? Not an end.
But we can't wait around here to find out.
Those rations downstairs.
Put as many as you can into these garbage bags, all right?
We need to bring them with us.
And keep an eye on that generator.
It goes black, you take this and get out of here.
But what about Paul?
I'm supposed to watch him.
Hey, you heard what I said.
Here.
Take this, all right?
It's good luck.
I'll bring us back a real one.
God, you're beautiful.
Let me tell you something.
You were born for the movies.
I think you missed your calling.
Yeah. King of missed opportunities.
That's me.
But I never missed a reel change.
Never.
Okay, once.
Tell me. Tell me as a woman, as a beautiful woman. What do you think?
You think I might have a chance?
I mean, hypothetically.
Not with you, but just in general.
Do you think I'm...
You know, you think I'm...
I'm so fucking stupid.
Going on and on and on.
Hey, we gotta go.
No. Hey, come back.
We will.
Don't let him fall asleep, okay?
Be brave.
Come on.
It's dead.
I just put batteries in four minutes ago.
This'll do it.
It's right over here. Come on.
I must've checked 500 cars since this happened.
Goddamn if this isn't the only one with a battery that still works.
Why does this one work and all the others don't?
It's a Chevy.
There is no reason. All right?
It's random, you know.
Toss of a coin.
Why I'm still here and the sucker who was driving this boat isn't,
I don't know. I had light, he didn't?
Just tell me what I have to do.
Push!
Keep pushing.
You're fine.
You got a girl?
A what?
"A what?" Not a what, a girl.
A main squeeze.
I got a ma.
You got a ma.
Of course you got a ma, everybody's got a ma.
We all got a ma, but...
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg!
That's the movie that I'm gonna screen for her.
Catherine Deneuve.
The music, the colors...
She's gonna love it.
Paul.
Paul. Paul!
Paul! Wake up!
Put on... Put on a song.
- A what?
- Go put a song on for me.
- But Luke says...
- I don't care what Luke says.
Just go, give me one more song. Go ahead.
See if they got Forever by the Marvelettes.
They got it.
Play it.
Darling, forever
Forever
You can break my heart
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you
Forever
Darling, forever
Forever
You can torment me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
If I
If I could be with you
I'll be your slave
For the rest of
Of my days
Love you more in so
So many ways
Just to be with you
Thrills me through and through
And darling, forever
Forever
James! James!
James! James!
James!
Paul! Come on, come on.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Hold up! Hold up!
It's just a few more blocks.
No, I've got to stop for a second.
My ankle. I just need a minute.
Hey, James.
James.
James!
James!
They're all dead.
Your son. Does he talk yet?
Manny, right?
Does he talk?
He kind of makes funny sounds.
He can nearly say mama.
And sometimes he'll...
He'll point at a light and he says, "Lye!
"Lye, Mama".
It's almost "light," but not really.
What's in Chicago?
Anna. My wife.
We're separated actually.
I left for my career and she stayed for hers.
She's still there, Luke.
Funny thing is,
I don't think she'd want to see me.
Even now.
You'll be together again.
You will.
I just... I just put fresh batteries in.
Just keep dying.
Oh, my God. Look!
Hey!
Come here.
- Hey, there.
- It's okay.
- Come here.
- Come here, it's all right.
It's all right, don't be afraid. Come here.
Come on.
Shit!
No! Come back!
Luke!
Luke, get up!
Hit the lights!
Hit the headlights!
Come on, hit the lights!
Hit the headlights!
Get out of there!
James.
Oh, no.
James!
James!
None of them work.
None of them work.
This is the only one that works.
Shit. Come on!
No, it doesn't work.
What are we gonna do?
Luke, they're here.
Come on.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
They're dimming.
James.
That's better.
Hold this steady.
- All right.
- All right. That's good. That's good.
Give me your lighter.
Come on! Come on! Give me your lighter.
- It's in the bar.
- What?
It's in the bar!
Where are you going?
Rosemary.
Whoa!
Hey, what are you doing?
Stay close.
- There's not enough light.
- Come on!
We can make it.
We can make it.
It's really close.
James.
Almost there!
This is it!
James!
James. Come...
James!
Here.
Paul.
James.
No! No!
No!
Who's there?
Stay away!
Stay away!
Stay away from me!
No!
I exist.
I exist. I exist. I exist. I exist.
James.
I exist.
I exist!
James, I exist!
I exist...
Paul.
Paul!
Paul!
Hold this.
How'd you know those matches were there?
I used to bum cigarettes off the duty nurse.
You worked here?
No.
Manny saved my life.
Made me want to clean up.
Made me want to live.
I can't lose him, Luke.
I can't.
This torch won't last.
We gotta go, Rosemary. Come on.
There's a storage room in the back.
There's alcohol.
For the needles.
Rubbing alcohol.
For the torch. Fuel, right?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
No, you rest your ankle.
You wait here. I'll go.
Manny.
Rosemary?
My baby?
Manny.
No. No.
Almost there.
I exist.
I exist.
James!
Hey!
Where's Paul?
He's gone. He's gone.
Rosemary?
Hey.
Hey, we're gonna make it.
All right?
Hey, we're gonna make it, all right?
But I need your help.
Okay?
Okay.
Come on, give me more slack.
There.
All right.
I gotta go down and prime that thing.
You're gonna have to turn the ignition on your own, all right?
I can't be alone, man.
- Listen, you're not alone.
- No, don't go!
- You're gonna leave, too!
- No. It's you and me now, buddy.
- All right? Hey.
- Don't go, man. Don't go.
Listen to me.
Okay? We're gonna see morning, I promise.
A storm passing.
- Right? Right?
- That's right.
That's right, a storm passing.
All right, when I say, "Now," turn the ignition.
Okay!
Now!
Come on.
Now!
Come on!
Now!
Come on! Come on! Shit.
I've gotta shut the hood.
You gotta keep your foot on the gas otherwise we're gonna lose power. Yeah?
Yeah.
Don't take it off.
Okay. Okay.
You did good back there.
So did you.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Mama.
James, the gas! Hey!
James! Hey!
What are you doing? Hey!
Shit!
James!
James, get back here!
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Fuck it.
James.
James.
Mom.
Mom. It's me.
Get in the truck!
I saw my mom.
Get in the fucking truck.
James! No!
James!
James!
James! James!
No!
Anna.
Luke!
My name is James Leary.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist!
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
That's my bed.
You don't have to go.
Don't go.
I'm Briana.
I'm James.
It works?
It won't go out.
As long as there's day.
What's that?
Look!
I exist.
I'm glad to see you.
Please.
THE TWINS
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.
Opening of the will to her two children,
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.
"In accordance with the will, regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan, the notary, Jean Lebel, is named executor."
Hmm ... I must tell you here that it was your mother's decision.
I was personally against it, but she insisted.
You know ...
...your mother was more than an employee.
To my late wife and me you felt more like part of our family, so ...
I could not refuse.
Hum!
"All my assets are to be shared between the twins,
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."
"The money is to be equitably shared"
"My furniture distributed by mutual agreement."
"Burial"
"Notary Jean Lebel will bury me without a coffin, naked and without prayers."
"My face turned towards the ground, my back against the world."
"Tombstone and Epitaph"
"No headstone is to be placed on my grave and my name engraved nowhere."
"No epitaph is deserved for those who do not keep their promises."
"To Jeanne and Simon"
"Childhood is like a knife stuck in the throat which cannot be removed easily."
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will hand you an envelope."
"This envelope is for your father."
"Find him and hand him the envelope."
"Simon, the notary will hand you an envelope."
I've heard enough.
Oh ... but it's not finished.
Continue.
"Simon, the notary will hand you an envelope."
"This envelope is for your brother."
"Find him and hand it to him."
"When these envelopes have been handed to their addressees, a letter will be given to you."
"When the silence is broken, and the promise kept a stone may be placed on my grave and my name engraved on the stone."
I admit it's a bit strange.
Is there stuff to sign?
No, not today.
OK.
Thank you, Jean.
- Shall we?
- Wait.
You know, the history of our father.
You know, we have no brother.
Why did you let her write this?
I understand your surprise.
It's ... it's very surprising.
Stop pretending to be innocent!
We know that we speak of, there is nothing surprising in this.
We did not make these things up, Simon...
They are part of a will.
There's that, too.
Well, this morning your mother gave us something rather special.
We'll sleep on it, then ...
We'll meet again, huh?
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.
Sit down, Simon.
Look, Jean ... your secretary, she loved working for you.
She did this well all her life, congratulations.
Your secretary, however, was also my mother.
Then her job as a mother, that's another story.
Simon ...
You can bury your secretary in any way you wish.
But my mother, I want her buried in the normal way.
For once in your fucking life make it something normal.
This is not negotiable.
Take your time.
And come see me when Simon has calmed down.
I know it's very unusual, but ... your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.
We have a large family now.
She spoke of a traitor?
In a big family, there's always a dog.
How long will it be before we find the traitor?
Fucking crazy woman!
I'll fix that with Jean.
Fix what?
We'll give her a normal funeral.
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.
Where are you going?
You bury her any way you like!
Oh, stop!
You feel guilty because you were not there when she died.
You feel guilty because you were there when she had her accident.
You need to stop you feeling guilty for everything!
I am not feeling guilty about anything.
Do you realize the significance of what he just read?
Well, she's gone!
It's over, I'm at peace!
I have fucking peace!
I'm at peace now.
Yes, I see.
Mathematics as you have known so far have aimed to achieve a precise and definitive response to precise and definitive problems.
Now, you are about to enter into entirely different adventure.
The subject will be intractable problems that will always lead to other problems just as intractable.
People around you will repeatedly insist that what you are doing is hopeless.
You'll have no argument to defend yourself, because they will be of an overwhelming complexity.
Welcome to pure mathematics, the land of loneliness.
This is my assistant,
Miss Jeanne Marwan.
Hello!
We will start with the conjecture of Syracuse.
What does your intuition tell you?
Your intuition is always right.
That's why you got potential to becoming a real mathematician.
But over there, you'll need help.
Do you have any family there?
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.
You've come to learn that a) your father is alive; and b) you have another brother.
This is ridiculous
What is ridiculous to question the inevitable.
You need to know.
Otherwise, your mind will never be at peace.
And peace of mind has nothing to do with pure mathematics.
You need a starting point.
My father died during the war in Daresh.
That's the unknown variable in the equation.
You never start with the unknown variable.
My mother used to speak about a village called Der Om, in Fouad.
She graduated in French at the University of Daresh.
If she studied, there is hope.
Said Haidar.
You'll go knock on the door Said Haidar an old friend of mine who teaches at Daresh.
You can trust him.
What are you doing?
Mom! Are you Okay?
Madam, that's my towel, please.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
What happened?
Where's Jeanne?
Mom?
Does she suffer from migraines?
No.
- Memory loss?
- No.
Loss of balance?
No.
Absent-minded?
She's always absent.
No, she was never absent.
Wahab, come.
Just get out of my sister's way.
Son of refugees, where do you think you're going?
Nicolas, stop!
Go back to your country.
Wahab!
We'll leave your hide in your camps, believe me.
Give me.
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.
You have sullied the family honor.
- Enough!
Go home!
Go home!
Outside.
What have you done!
You have humiliated us!
You have sullied the name of our family!
Why God have you plunged us in the dark?
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?
I'm pregnant, grandma.
- My God, everything is black.
Why?
Why have you done this?
Do I have to kill you?
What will I do with you?
Come.
Eat if you want your child safe.
Listen to me.
There's nothing here for you.
I'll help after the birth.
I want you to go away.
You'll go to live with your uncle Charbel.
There, you'll go to school.
To learn to read, to learn to think out of this misery.
Promise me and I'll help you.
Promise me you'll go to school.
I promise you, grandmother.
I promise.
Shh.
Shh.
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Come on, it's time for you to go.
I feel that something terrible is coming ...
One day I'll find you, my son.
I received a message from my friend Niv Cohen but I can't help you because at the time,
I taught
History of Mathematics in Paris.
Specifically, the period where Euler had succeeded to give the first formal mathematical resolution to the problem of the seven bridges of Konigsberg, yes.
Diderot defied the Court saying:
"Gentlemen ..."
I-ft plus
Equals zero.
So, God exists!"
Niv, Niv, Niv ...
Hello! Do you speak French?
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone who would have known this woman.
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.
Are you kidding me?
I wasn't even born.
Well, you're in the wrong place...
I'm not kidding.
I'm sure you know someone who can help me.
I have come from far away.
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.
You are very kind.
I'm not nice, I want to get rid of you.
Najat, that's me.
You have time to waste?
That tells me something.
She may have worked in the campus newspaper.
It's been a long time.
People who leave usually change identities.
It is striking nonetheless.
Your mother was photographed in Kfar Ryat.
Look here.
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.
It is a prison in the south.
You do not know Kfar Ryat?
- No.
You're definitely not from here.
You don't know the South.
If the international community does not intervene now
The refugees in overcrowded camps at the border ...will be massacred.
She has arrived.
OK.
We, the students, are oppose against the Nationalist Party that are trying to evict the refugees across the borders.
The National Party supports militias of the Christian right, who make open threats against the refugees.
In the South, the refugees are now armed.
And have the support of much of the country's Muslim population.
But you ...you're a Christian.
We are for peace.
Religion has nothing to do with it.
Nawal!
Put the radio!
They've come to close the University!
The Nationalists have closed the campus!
Nawal, come back.
Stay here.
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists are closing the campus!
There will be clashes.
Stay with me.
There is shooting outside ...
To the table, girls!
Mom, they're attacking the university!
It's not a reason not to eat!
Aioua?
Christian villages were attacked in the South this morning.
May God protect us!
That's why they closed the university.
In short time, it will explode here as well.
We'll go to the mountain until it calms down.
For how long?
We start tomorrow.
The rest of the family is already there.
And the school?
Anyway, the school will close.
Only God knows how long.
And Le Journal?
Don't be afraid.
Le Journal can survive without us for a while.
But ideas only survive if someone is there to defend them!
Exactly, Rafqa.
Exactly.
There are only two orphanages in the region.
I will join you soon.
You will not go there now!
You had promised Grandma you would finish your studies.
You heard your father.
It's going to explode across the country if they attack the camps.
The studies are finished.
I think of him every day.
That's my child.
I want to find him alive.
I'm going to fetch water from Shadia.
Hurry, Nawal.
- Your name?
- Nawal.
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.
Where are you going?
South.
What for?
To meet my husband.
Wahab.
You have only daughters?
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked yesterday.
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?
There.
The children?
Where are the children?
You should speak with those who were there.
The muslim villagers fled to the camp Deressa.
They fear reprisals will come.
The children may be with them.
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?
I am a Christian.
My daughter! My daughter!
Mom!
Hi, Simon, it's me!
I am in Mama's village.
I wish you were here with me.
Listen.
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.
I told you never to come here again!
Hello!
Souha?
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!
I told you not to say that again!
Hello.
Can I help you?
Hello.
Does anyone speak French or English?
Where's Sami?
Marhaba!
Marhaba!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Uh, Jeanne.
Jeanne.
Jeanne.
Uh ...
Thank you.
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!
Hello.
My name is Samia.
I am Jeanne Marwan.
Thank you for helping me.
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.
Really?
Well, I'm from Canada.
I'm looking for Souha.
She is Souha.
She is my great-grandmother.
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.
The people in the corner shop told me to come see you.
I am looking for my father.
His name is Wahab.
Uh ...My mother's name is Nawal Marwan.
She was born here.
We do not know her.
Of course you know her.
The Marwan family was struck with shame.
When the war came.
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.
She does not know Wahab.
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter, you're not welcome here.
Go home.
She is looking for her father, but she doesn't know who is her mother.
I arrived at the end of the massacre in the Deressa refugee camp.
Everything was burning.
I looked for my son amid waves of blood.
I was disheartened by what I saw and heard.
You claim to be against our enemy.
That does not make you our friend.
Chamseddine. why would he trust you?
My son's father was a refugee from Deressa.
My son has been swallowed by the war.
I have nothing to lose.
My hatred is great toward the Nationalists.
This is not what you wrote in Charbel's journal.
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage peace with words and books.
I believed that.
Life has taught me something else.
What are you going to do now?
Teach the enemy what life has taught me.
That's good. That's good.
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.
So in French?
I ... I am much better, Dad.
They say "a lot" or "best" but never both at the same time, my darling.
I want my son to learn to speak several languages.
I want him to understand others without an intermediary.
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?
My mother is very well.
Tomorrow.
Marhaba.
Hello, beautiful.
Good morning.
Then you will be going out with us on Thursday?
No.
Friday?
No.
Saturday?
No.
We are patient!
Me too.
Never forget:
"Always" is "always".
Fucking bitch.
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was condemned in several reports by Amnesty
International.
Here is the women's section.
The cells are larger.
Some prisoners remained there up to 15 years.
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.
Just after the war began.
They have 600 political prisoners jailed.
You can come in, eh?
I'll take a picture.
You know this woman?
No.
She was imprisoned here.
I don't know her.
It was a really long time ago, you know? I...
Maybe you know someone who worked here.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.
I am the school janitor.
Yes, but before, what were you?
Before, hum!
That was before I became the school janitor.
It's been a long time since I'm caretaker of the school.
You know this woman?
She was in Kfar Ryat.
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.
I am looking for someone who knew her.
Someone who could tell me about her.
This is my mother.
This is the woman who sings.
Number 72.
It was she who murdered the militia leader of the christian right.
They made her pay dearly.
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.
They used to call her the woman who sings because she sang all the time.
Han, you are sure it's her?
I spent 13 years as a watchman.
Have you ever spent 13 years overseeing someone?
They did everything to make her break.
In the end, she was still standing,
She looked ...
Ah! Never seen anything like it.
She never broke.
It was exasperating.
And then they sent Abu Tarek.
Who's that?
Abu Tarek...
You know, sometimes it's better not to know everything.
Sir, I live with it anyway.
Continue.
Abu Tarek...
Abu Tarek was a investigation specialist.
He raped her repeatedly to break her before being released.
To stop her from singing.
Eventually she became pregnant.
It was like that.
I'll never forget it.
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.
They waited ... for her to give birth in prison then they let her go.
The child?
Did you see the child?
There was a doctor who came sometimes.
I think he's crazy.
Others say he has a restaurant in Tel Aviv ...
That's bullshit.
He went mad and died.
His nurse, I know her.
She lives in Daresh.
In Daresh?
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...
Mom, she was raped.
Our brother, she had him in prison.
I need you here.
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS
This, Simon, are notary Amyott contracts from 1868 to 1892.
His son took over, 脡douard, until 1925.
All the contracts are hand-written.
My grandfather, Charles, my father, Henry.
And me.
Yeah, well, it stops there because as you know,
I am the last of the Lebel.
I'll show you the will of a man ...
...which took several lives.
His heirs have discovered he had three wives, all at the same time.
One here, one in Miami, and another in Honduras, where he did business.
No, no ...he not longer has three children in the file there, no
There are eight.
That is sport, my man.
Look. Hum!
Death is never the end of a story.
There are still traces.
If you want to find your brother, you'll have to go back into your mother's past.
Jean, I'm going to fetch my sister, that's all.
I'll take care of that.
Two, three small matters to take care, then it will take no time.
Well, get your business ready we should go in ...
My passport ...
"We"? Don't you worry that you already done enough already
Exactly, this is not the time to let you down.
Make a man out of you, Simon.
I know that you need me.
We'll get it, then come back.
I promise.
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan, a notary is on the order of the sacred.
Sing now.
Gently, gently.
He is coming out.
We can see the head.
Push, push.
Go, girl.
The first came out.
Rest now ...
I'm proud of you.
Get ready for the second.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you doing?
You are going to dump them in the river as usual.
- It's dangerous.
- No.
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.
I want to take care of them.
These are the children of the woman who sings.
Oh, this country is a war zone after another, eh!
It's not complicated.
If the notary had existed at the time of Noah, we would not be here.
We need only to find the original contracts.
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.
And we talk more about it.
Everyone would be happy.
Notaries have existed only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.
That's the problem.
I should have been here from the beginning.
Thank you again for your help, Me Maddad.
The pleasure is all mine, my dear fellow.
I have the result that you have requested via email.
Simon my file on the seat beside you.
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?
You are very nice, but the delay and everything ...
I think I'll wait until later.
But I'll summarize.
For the father, it is rather difficult because I can not find the death certificate.
For the brother ...
Excuse me, but what are we talking about here?
I asked for help, Simon.
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand to speed things up.
I told you, Jean, we came for Jeanne.
Your sister is the one person in your family easiest to find.
I'm so glad you're here.
Me too.
OK, that's the nurse's name. which helped your mother give birth in prison.
We can go today.
Jeanne, that's enough.
No, you shut up, then follow me.
It's your job to find our brother, not mine!
Then, if you don't do it for her or for you, the, do it for me!
She is at the American hospital.
I'm glad you're here, Jean.
Me too, my owl, me too.
If she is sleeping, you must return later.
Ms. Maika?
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.
Bonjour, Madame!
Thank you for having us.
We seek someone you know.
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison as a nurse?
She says she knows your mom.
You helped our mother give birth in prison?
Yes.
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.
Can you help us?
She worked in the prison of Kfar Ryat.
She assisted her during childbirth.
She gathered the children.
Then she gave them back to the woman who sings when she got out of prison.
Nawal Marwan gave birth to twins.
Hush, hush, hush.
Hush, hush, hush.
You really know the woman who sings?
You don't know what it means to me.
Nawal Marwan worked for me as a secretary for 18 years.
My wife and I, we had taken a liking to her and her children.
But I confess that I didn't really know her till the end.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Hmm ...
Me Maddadi has conducted an investigation, at my request, to track your brother and your father.
For the father, Abu Tarek,
I still have not found a death certificate.
The country has a lot of certificates missing.
He could have gone abroad.
That's what happened with this kind of characters.
They are dead or have disappeared.
You have to see.
Maybe it's better that way.
For the brother ... your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan, comes from the village of Der Om.
She gave the child to a midwife who's named Elham who herself returned it to the orphanage in Kfar Kout in May 1970.
The main task was to trace the registry records.
Many documents have been lost in the war.
But I found the records which were recovered and donated by the Sisters of Charity to the National Archives.
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham filed a petition for adoption of a male child.
This is the only boy in the orphanage filed in that month.
Look.
It was registered under the name Nihad.
The dates match.
That's him.
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.
Orphanage Kfar Kout,
Nihad May.
It's his name in the registry.
Nihad from the month of May.
They gave him a temporary name with the month of arrival.
There was no adoption during that period.
It was the beginning of the war.
The orphanage was destroyed four years later.
We must ask those that destroyed the orphanage in Kfar Kout to know what happened to the children.
Between you and me, with what happened in the region ... there is not much hope.
They are probably also dead.
I'm not saying they're dead.
I say we lost track of them.
They are both dead.
We open the envelopes, that's it, then.
That I will not allow, Simon.
This kind of thing is sacred.
Luckily, I have a history.
Excuse me.
It is still worth exploring.
But it is a little radical.
The warlord that demolished the orphanage at that time is still alive.
And he may know what happened to Nihad's children and where they went.
It's already been an eternity.
You must understand that during this period there were a series of reprisals which fit one another in a sort of inexorable logic,
A warlord is exactly the type of man who has a long memory.
And he will remember, believe me.
Wallat Chamseddine, is his name.
We can find him here?
If we don't find him, he will find us.
But we can try something.
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?
It's your turn.
You will go to the Deressa refugee camp.
You will come to tea anywhere in the camp with the person that invite you.
And you say you are the son of the woman who sings and are looking Nihad May.
You can not go there alone.
I'll find someone to accompany you.
Welcome to Deressa.
Ha! Ha! You know where you are going, Simon?
I know.
How are you?
In the name of God, you've grown!
I have finished my engineering studies.
I cannot find work, so I'm a taxi driver now.
What brings you here?
I am with some foreign visitors, who asked me to bring them here.
Welcome, come.
No, thank you, we're in a hurry.
Please, come.
He is inviting us to tea.
Oh, good!
Uh, I wonder why you have come to Deressa.
I am looking for someone named Nihad de Mai.
He does not know Nihad de Mai.
He asks me what are your names.
My mother comes from the village of Der de Om, in the South.
My mother is the woman who sings.
Yes, that's fine. Done.
Wait for what?
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.
We are here to offer help.
You will be back in an hour.
Can I tell my sister?
No, you'll be back in an hour, I promise.
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.
He will call.
He's going to go.
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.
Ah, I told you: the South, a spark and it exploded.
Oh, okay.
You have been luck with us, we'll help in our own way.
You must leave the country.
It'll be easier.
We will find you a house and a job.
I want your life to be better.
We have many contacts in America.
You gotta go with your children.
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.
The children will help you, you'll see.
You cannot ask me.
Your children are our children, Nawal.
Your family is our family.
Trust me.
I'll help you.
I'm here for you and your children.
Hello, Sarwan.
Excuse my introduction, but it is for your protection.
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.
Tell me, what can I do to help, Sarwan Marwan?
You knew my mother.
They say she worked for me.
What can I do to help?
I am looking for a man named Nihad de Mai.
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?
He's my brother.
My mother asked me to find him.
And how can you prove that
Nihad de Mai is the son of Nawal Marwan?
My brother was placed for adoption at the Kfar Kout orphanage.
We found the registry with the original file.
The dates ... Everything fits.
Nihad de Mai is my brother.
Me and my friends, we attacked the christian village at Kfar Kout ...
In response to attacks that our brothers, the refugees, were victims of.
There was an orphanage in Kfar Kout.
I saved the children.
I took them with us.
And Nihad was among them.
We have trained and prepared them so that they can fight alongside us.
Nihad, he had a gift.
He was at unique.
And soon it became a formidable fencer.
But he wanted to find her mother.
He sought her for a long time.
Nihad, I do not know what he saw or heard.
He started ... a crazy war.
He came to see me, he wanted to be a martyr so that his mother should see his picture everywhere on the walls around the country.
But I refused.
He went back to Daresh.
He became a maverick, one of the most dangerous in the region.
A real machine.
He pulls on everyone.
And then there was the enemy invasion.
And one morning ...
They captured Nihad.
He killed seven gunmen.
They did not killed them.
They captured him and sent him to the prison in Kfar Ryat.
He has been in prison?
Yes.
He is the executioner.
He worked with my father?
- No, he did not work with Abu Tarek, your father.
- Are you okay?
One plus one ... that makes two.
What?
One plus one makes two.
You can not make one.
Hey, you have a fever.
Jeanne?
One plus one, does it make one?
Are there are empty seats, no.
Oh, move ahead if you want.
Can I help you, ma'am?
Excuse me.
By becoming a hangman
your brother has changed its name.
He became Abu Tarek.
Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.
We know that he now lives in Canada
under a new identity.
Nihad Harmanni.
Mr. Harmanni?
Yes?
This is for you.
My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.
I recognized you.
But you didn't.
It's a wonderful miracle.
I'm your number 72.
This letter will be delivered by our children.
You will not recognize them
because they are beautiful,
but they know who you are.
Through them, I want to tell you
you're still alive.
But soon, you'll be quiet.
I know.
Because silence is all to the truth.
Signed: The whore 72.
I speak to my son.
I am not talking to the executioner.
Whatever happens, I will always love you.
That's the promise I made you at birth, my son.
Whatever happens, I will always love you.
I've searched my whole life.
I found you.
You, you could not recognize me.
You have your tattoo on the right heel.
I've seen it.
I recognized you.
And I found you beautiful.
I'll remember you with all the sweetness of the world, my love.
Console yourself because nothing is more beautiful
than being together.
You were born of love.
Your brother and your sister were also born of love.
Nothing is more beautiful than to be together.
Your mother, Nawal Marwan.
Prisoner number 72.
"When these envelopes have been handed
"to the addressee,
"You will be given a letter."
"The silence will be broken,
"a promise kept,
"A stone may then be placed on my grave, and my name engraved on the stone facing the sun."
My love ...
Where did your story begin?
When you were born?
Then she starts in horror.
At the birth of your father?
Then she begins a great love story.
I say that your story begins with a promise
that will break the thread of anger.
Thanks to you, today I finally managed to do it.
The thread is broken.
And I can finally take the time to rock you in my arms... and softly sing you a lullaby
to comfort you.
Nothing is more beautiful than to be together.
I love you.
Your mother, Nawal.
Come on!
But you realize
I know nothing about politics?
- You voted for him, didn't you?
- Adam Lang? Of course I did.
Everyone voted for him.
He wasn't a politician, he was a craze.
Well, there you go.
Look, it's a new ghostwriter he needs, not another goddamn politico.
He was paid $10 million for these memoirs, but rumor has it the manuscript's a crock of shit.
Rhinehart's lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it, and the pressure must have gotten to McAra.
Pathologist said his blood was, like, three parts booze.
You mean he drowned by accident?
Accident, suicide, who cares?
It was the book that killed him.
Well, that's encouraging.
Who is this McAra?
Should I have heard of him?
Yeah. He was some kind of aide to Lang when he was Prime Minister, so don't admit that you haven't.
He was with him for years.
I don't know, Rick.
This is a great opportunity for you.
Plus the money is good. Kids won't starve.
- I don't have any kids.
- I do.
Roy.
Who're you expecting to bomb you,
Random House?
We're publishing Lang's memoirs.
That's enough to make us a target, apparently.
Thank you.
- How many have you seen?
- Five. You're the last.
I must be honest.
I don't think you're the right man for this assignment.
Then it's a good job it's not your decision, Roy.
John Maddox, chief executive of Rhinehart, New York.
Sir.
Sidney Kroll,
Mr. Lang's Washington attorney.
Mr. Kroll.
And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know.
All right, Rick.
JOHN: All right, I gather from Rick you're aware of the situation?
Perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you're gonna bring to this project.
Nothing.
No, I'm not gonna pretend to be someone I'm not.
You have my CV.
His last effort was the autobiography of a magician,
I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered.
Yeah, and it went straight to number one, so...
After you turned it down, Roy.
Look, I don't read political memoirs.
Who does?
And I gather you've spent
$10 million on this book.
How much of that are you gonna see back?
Two? Three?
It's bad news for your shareholders.
And it's worse news for your client, Mr. Kroll.
Adam Lang, he wants a place in history, not in the remainder tables.
Oh, please!
It's because I know nothing about politics that I'll ask the questions that get right to the heart of who Adam Lang is.
And that is what sells autobiographies.
Heart.
Wow! That's nicely done.
- What utter balls.
- You think so?
John, of course.
Adam Lang's a world historical figure.
His autobiography is gonna be a world-publishing event.
Yeah, well, I got warehouses filled with world-publishing events waiting to be pulped.
Sid?
Adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to Mike McAra.
He was irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable, and yet he has to be replaced.
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different.
In the end, it's about chemistry.
Do you work out, maybe?
- Not really.
- That's a pity. Adam likes to work out.
Actually, I know a good writer on the Guardian who uses a gym.
Okay, maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule, yeah?
We need to wrap this up in a month.
- GHOST: A month?
- Yes.
- You want the book in a month?
- We already have a first draft.
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.
That's why I like your résumé here.
You're fast, and you deliver.
You name it, he ghosts it. (CHUCKLES)
And you're a Brit.
The ghost should be a Brit.
To get the jolly old tone right, right?
- Do you have any family commitments?
- No, I have no family. Why?
Adam is locked into a US lecture tour, also a fundraising program for the Adam Lang Foundation.
It's a month in the States. That's okay.
Couldn't I bring the manuscript back here to work on?
I'm afraid not. It's in a secure environment in Marty Rhinehart's own house.
Only a few people are allowed to handle it.
Sounds more like a bomb than a book.
I will need to see it myself at some point.
I am supposed to be editing it.
Yeah, in theory.
Actually, we need to talk about that.
- JOHN: How soon can you get over there?
- As soon as you want.
- He'll fly tonight.
- Rick.
(SOFTLY) It's okay.
Okay, you're in.
Oh!
- (GRUNTS) Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Rick.
- Thank you.
Actually, I have something here
- you might want to look at.
- Is that... Is that...
No, no, no, this isn't Adam's book.
No, it's another client of mine.
Yeah, perhaps you can let me know what you think.
Sure.
JOHN: Okay, if you're gonna get that evening flight, we'd better talk contracts with Rick here.
Wanna show our friend to the door?
Would you?
Roy?
RICK: Call you in an hour, buddy.
JOHN: Hey!
Remember...
(IMITATES BRITISH ACCENT) Heart.
There's something not quite right about this project.
- What? Me, you mean?
- Obviously you.
And McAra. Suicide?
He didn't strike me as the suicidal type.
Always nice to see you, Roy.
ROY: Good luck.
Oh, God.
TAXI DRIVER: Thank you.
- Yeah?
- RICK: Congratulations!
- On what?
- On having me as your agent.
Yeah, I can hardly believe my luck.
Are you packed?
I just got mugged.
Shit! Are you okay?
Yeah, all they took was the manuscript that Sidney Kroll gave me.
What? Why?
I don't know. You tell me.
Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine. I think they must have followed me from Rhinehart's.
Why would they do that?
Well, maybe they thought
I had Lang's book.
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.
You're still okay to fly tonight, right?
For God's sake, Rick, I'm in shock.
Well, here's another shock for you.
For one month's work on a manuscript that's already written,
Rhinehart Inc. Is willing to pay you $250,000, plus expenses.
Window seat or aisle?
FEMALE NEWSREADER: Islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility.
We hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin.
Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang is back in the news tonight.
According to leaked documents,
Mr. Lang authorized the illegal use of British special forces to seize four suspected al-Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the CIA.
The men, Nasir Ashraf, Marwat Sayed,
Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed, all British citizens, were seized in the
Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago.
All four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured.
Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation.
Such an operation would have been illegal under...
- RICK: Yeah?
- Where are you?
Heathrow, like you.
Waiting for my flight to New York.
Can you see the news?
The Lang story? Yeah, I'm watching it now.
What have you gotten me into?
I got you into a quarter of a million bucks, pal, that's what I got you into.
They're calling my flight. I gotta go.
Listen, I just realized
Sidney Kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like
I was carrying Lang's book.
Why the hell would he do that?
I don't know. To use me as a tethered goat?
Get some sleep on the plane.
You're sounding weird.
(SCOFFS) "A tethered goat".
I'll call you next week.
FEMALE NEWSREADER:
...and long-term psychological trauma.
In other words, torture.
Hello, sir.
Would you like a newspaper to read?
- Have you got the Evening Standard?
- We do, yes.
Thanks. Thank you.
STEWARDESS: Hello, madam.
Would you like a newspaper to read?
WOMAN: Yes, please. Thank you.
Passport?
RUTH: This is an absolute scandal!
Amelia Bly. Welcome.
I'm Adam's assistant.
Adam's in New York, unfortunately, and won't be back until later this afternoon.
RUTH: Actually, forget I said that, it's bloody ridiculous!
(CHUCKLES) Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid Ruth's having one of those days.
If this isn't a good time, I could go to...
No, no. She's keen to meet you.
- Right. Shall we make a start?
- Right.
- How was your journey?
- Long.
AMELIA: We're a small team.
GHOST: Thanks.
AMELIA: This is Alice.
Lucy's traveling with Adam.
We need another pair of hands, but Adam couldn't bring himself to replace Mike.
- They were together so long.
- How long were you with him?
AMELIA: Eight years.
I'm an attachment from Number 10.
Ah. Poor Number 10.
Before I show you the manuscript,
I need you to sign this confidentiality agreement.
Sign here.
And here.
And here.
GHOST: Wow, quite a place.
Don't you get lonely at night?
It's my husband I miss the most.
Are you married?
I noticed you don't wear a wedding ring.
I can't, sadly. It's far too large.
- It bleeps when I go through airport security.
- Oh.
Here we are.
The manuscript is not to be removed from this room. It's not to be copied.
You have six hours before Adam gets in from New York.
- Can you finish by then?
- I'll try.
I'll ask Dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch.
Thanks.
Have fun.
"Langs are Scottish folk, originally, and proud of it.
"Our name is a derivation of 'long', the Old English word for 'tall',
"and it is from north of the border that my forefathers hail".
Fuck.
"My great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lang,
"was born in 1862 in Pitlochry, Scotland.
"One of nine children, seven of them boys".
"The American President was much taller than I had expected".
"This year's European summit was particularly interesting".
"I always found the Queen, in private, to have a delightful sense of humor".
Thanks.
"I've always been an optimist.
The present is where we live.
"Ruth and I look forward to the future, whatever it may hold".
As bad as that?
Oh, hello.
Well? How bad is it?
You haven't read it?
Not all of it.
- Well, let's just say it needs some work.
- How much work?
Well, all the words are there.
They're just in the wrong order.
Come on. You look like you need a break.
You were my idea.
I was?
You wrote Christy Costello's memoirs, didn't you?
You read those?
We stayed at his house in Mustique, last winter.
The book was beside the bed.
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, why?
It was brilliant, in a horrible sort of way.
How you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent.
I said to Adam, "Here's the guy to write your book, not Mike".
(SIGHS) God, I miss home.
It's like being married to Napoleon on St. Helena.
- Why don't you go back to London?
- RUTH: I don't feel I can leave him alone.
There's something not quite right with him at the moment.
Amelia told me he was very upset at the death of Michael McAra.
Oh, she did, did she?
Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert on my husband's emotions, I'm not sure.
Losing Mike was a blow, of course, but it's not just that.
It's having to relive everything, year by year, for this bloody book.
Oh, dear.
You must be wondering what you've let yourself in for.
Fine, fine. I'll tell him.
They're just about to land.
On Thursday, he's in Chicago.
Actually, I think I'll go and meet him.
Amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something.
Why don't you come, say hello?
Fine. I'll travel in the backup car.
I can do my nails in there.
Hi, darling.
- How was New York?
- Short and sweet.
Hi, Barry. Hi, Amelia.
Hello. Who are you?
I'm your ghost.
Right.
Don't worry. He isn't always such a jerk.
This place really comes alive at night.
You'll be with us for four weeks, is that right?
I'm afraid so.
And the bill goes directly to the Rhinehart Corporation?
Good.
That doesn't include the mini-bar.
All right. He's ready for you.
How's your hotel? Quiet?
Monastic.
That's nice. No distractions.
Thanks, love.
Hi, man. You ready to start?
Absolutely.
- GHOST: Is the manuscript loaded on this?
- It is.
Can I have it?
AMELIA: I'm sorry, that would be a security risk.
You mean I've got to retype the whole manuscript?
Have you really got my entire book on that little thing?
We can get 100 books on it, Adam.
And it can be copied in a flash.
That's the trouble.
Amazing.
You know the worst thing about my life?
You get so out of touch.
Everything's done for you.
You don't drive, you don't carry money.
If I need cash,
I have to borrow it from the protection boys.
This is the kind of details we need in the memoirs.
I couldn't put that in.
People would think I was a complete idiot.
No, not at all. No, this shows what it's like being Prime Minister.
That's exactly what the readers want to know.
How does it feel to run a country?
How does it feel to be so cut off?
How does it feel to be so hated?
Thanks a lot.
(STAMMERS) And so loved.
Amelia, what do you think?
I think I should leave you two alone.
So, how do we go about this?
I interview you.
I turn your answers into prose.
Here and there, I'll add linking passages, imitating your voice.
Okay.
- You heard about Mike?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
We should put in something nice about him.
I think his mother would like that.
Of course.
Well, um, the first thing that struck me was, you became such a successful politician precisely because you didn't appear to be a politician.
It's certainly not something I wanted to do when I was younger.
I thought most student politicians were complete nerds.
Well, I'm with you there.
So, what turned you on to politics?
Turned me on, indeed.
Let's see, I was 23, something like that, a couple of years out of Cambridge.
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, it was raining.
I was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.
And, you know,
I'd been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you.
So, I get the pillow and I put it over my head, and it starts up again.
Knock, knock, knock, knock!
And I get up, I'm swearing,
I go to the door and there's this girl.
She's soaking wet, but she just launches into this speech about the local elections.
And that's it.
- I'm in love.
- And this is Ruth?
This is Ruth.
And the only way I can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets.
This is great.
You want to use this?
Use it? I think we should open the whole book like this.
"I went into politics out of love,
"not love for a party or an ideology, but out of love for a woman".
Could you transcribe this as quickly as possible, please?
Of course.
- Thanks.
- How's it going?
Pretty well. He keeps calling me "man".
He always does that when he can't remember someone's name.
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.
Oh, shit.
It's awful.
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't realize there was anyone up there.
What on earth is going on?
It's just a security drill, sir.
We have it once a week.
So, there you are.
I'd rather lost track of you.
I'm a big boy now.
Can't keep your eye on me all the time.
Don't wander around on your own.
The security boys don't like it.
Gotcha.
- Did you win?
- Didn't play tennis. Gym.
Gym? What's he in training for?
The Olympics?
Here's your transcript.
Cambridge. Let's talk about that.
Sorry? Um...
Cambridge?
It was such a long time ago,
I can hardly remember.
You did a lot of acting?
Some.
It must have been good training for politics, acting?
It was a good way to meet girls.
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?
Still, acting must have been very important to you.
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.
You know, you go on the stage, pretend to be somebody else, and people actually applaud you for it.
Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.
- No.
- Why not?
Because these are the memoirs of a Prime Minister.
And whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with, they always said I was a bloody actor!
Do you know what the Times of London said the day I resigned?
"Kindly leave the stage".
So, no, we won't dwell, if you don't mind, on my student days as an actor.
We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it.
Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Actually, that would be a good idea, thank you. I need to make a call.
AMELIA: What a bastard.
Look at this.
"Former British Foreign Secretary
Richard Rycart
"has asked the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate allegations
"that the former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang
"ordered the illegal handover of terrorist suspects
"for torture by the CIA."
Don't!
The pack is on the move.
Unplug all the phones.
Is Ruth still out walking?
Shit! She is, isn't she?
- Barry! Barry!
- Yeah.
Would you please find Mrs. Lang and get her back here as soon as you can?
- Right.
- AMELIA: Let's go.
- Rycart has made a statement.
- Yes, I know.
- He just called me.
- AMELIA: It's unbelievable.
He wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal.
He wanted very, very much to tell me that it was only because of his well-known stand on human rights that he couldn't keep quiet any longer.
"His well-known stand on human rights".
Dear God!
- Sorry to lose my temper earlier.
- Forget it.
And have you told her?
ADAM: Yes. Just called her.
AMELIA: And how did she take it?
Sorry, Adam. This is running on AP.
"According to sources in The Hague,
"the prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Court
"will issue a statement in the morning".
AMELIA: Oh, Adam.
Thank you, Alice.
Why weren't we given some warning of this? Where's Downing Street?
The phones are disconnected.
Switch is probably trying to get through now.
Now? What freaking use is now?
What are you people doing?
I mean, you're not telling me that the Cabinet Office didn't know this was coming?
The war crimes court doesn't warn a suspect who's under investigation.
That's what Adam is now, a suspect?
You need to call Sid Kroll.
I think we should call London first.
Adam! If it suits them, they will hang you out to dry.
- You need a lawyer. Call Sid.
- (ADAM SIGHS)
- Get Sid on the line.
- What about the media?
Issue a holding statement, something short.
This is when we need Mike.
I'll write something.
Let him do it.
He's supposed to be the writer.
- Hang on a minute.
- ADAM: I should sound confident.
Not defensive, that'd be fatal.
But I shouldn't be cocky.
No bitterness, no anger, and don't say
I'm pleased at this opportunity to clear my name or any balls like that.
So, you're not defensive, but you're not cocky.
You're not angry, but you're not pleased?
- ADAM: That's it.
- Then what exactly are you?
Told you he was funny.
I've always been a passionate supporter...
No, scrub that.
I've always been a strong, no, committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court. Has he?
You're the writer.
The struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personal revenge.
Very good.
You could be the new Mike McAra.
- Hello?
- JOHN: John Maddox.
This is gonna be big.
This can only be good for us.
- Could be.
- Here's the first chapter right here.
Okay.
What've you covered so far?
Um...
The early years, childhood, university.
All right, forget that crap.
Get him focused on the war crimes.
And he can't talk to anybody else, all right?
- Right.
- It's gotta be our exclusive.
Any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner?
Sooner?
Yeah, yeah, sooner.
Well, how much sooner?
I'm thinking two weeks.
Jesus.
Look, I know it's tough, but if anyone can do it, you can.
I'm relying on you. We'll talk.
Shit.
I'd never have guessed you smoked.
I only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment.
- And which is this?
- Very funny.
Maddox just called. He wants the book in two weeks instead of four.
Christ. Good luck.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a lift back to my hotel. I could get on with some work there.
You're not planning on taking that manuscript
- out of here, are you?
- Course not.
Because you do realize how serious this is getting, don't you?
- You can search me, if you like.
- That won't be necessary.
All right. Fetch your stuff.
I'll get one of the boys to take you.
Mr. Lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court.
Mr. Lang added, quote,
"The struggle against terror is too important
"to be used for the purposes of personal revenge".
- Same again, sir?
- This is being widely interpreted as...
- Yes, thanks.
...an attack on the former British
Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart, who has asked...
Could we change the channel?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
At issue is the practice of so-called waterboarding, an interrogation technique considered a war...
- Something to eat?
- What've you got?
- Club sandwich. Clam chowder.
- Chowder will be fine.
MAN: You're English?
GHOST: And so are you.
Indeed I am.
- You here on a holiday?
- No, I'm working.
So, what's your line?
Just this and that. Excuse me.
I hear Adam Lang's on the island.
Is he?
So I hear.
You don't happen to know his whereabouts, do you?
No.
No, I'm afraid not. If you don't mind.
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund.
A slap pass to Lukas Krajicek.
He's in trouble against
Barret Jackman and the referee...
Asshole.
...and Ohlund can't hold it in again, and this power play is just about over.
Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on.
Hello?
- Can I help you?
- Hi.
(STAMMERING) Yeah, can you tell me, has anyone gone up to my room?
No, sir.
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.
What about that other guest? The, um...
There's an Englishman.
You're the only guest in the hotel, sir.
- Hello?
- AMELIA: You need to check out of the hotel immediately.
Things have changed. A car is on its way.
What?
See you then.
Hello?
- MAN: Okay.
- Just check on that. Okay?
- It's getting big, huh?
- So I see.
Who're you with?
I'm on my own.
Oh, sod it. Here we go again.
RICK: You've reached the office of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.
Hi, Rick.
Now they want the book in two weeks.
Thanks for getting me this job.
Can't talk.
Some peace protestors are trying to kill me.
You're working for a murderer!
You're working for a murderer!
WOMAN: Liar! Liar! Liar!
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm aging.
This place is Shangri-La in reverse.
AMELIA: I tried to call you several times last night.
You didn't answer.
GHOST: I forgot to charge my mobile phone.
Really? And the hotel phone?
I'm a heavy sleeper.
Well, you can do your heavy sleeping here from now on.
- Here?
- AMELIA: We're under siege.
You can't run the media gauntlet every day.
Eventually, they'll discover who you are.
And that would be horrid for you.
So, this is where you put the granny.
No.
This is where we put Mike McAra.
We haven't had a chance to clear it yet.
The sheets have been changed, though.
Actually, I make it a rule never to stay in a client's house.
But now you can have constant access to the manuscript.
Isn't that what you want?
Besides, Sid Kroll will be arriving any minute.
Why don't you settle in, and then come up and join us?
- You're practically one of us now.
- I am?
You drafted the statement yesterday.
That makes you an accomplice.
So, here's the score. You're not being charged, you're not being arrested.
None of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans.
The only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formal investigation.
- Investigating me for what?
- Connie?
Either crimes against humanity or war crimes.
Well, that's absurd.
It's not exactly genocide.
"Under Article 25, a person shall be guilty of a war crime
"if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime
"or aids, abets or otherwise assists in its commission".
- That's rather sweeping.
- Well, if it's any comfort, you're in no jeopardy as long as you stay here, among friends.
Are you saying
I can't leave the United States?
As your attorney, I strongly advise you not to travel to any country that recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
Well, just about every country in the world recognizes the ICC.
America doesn't.
- Who else?
- SIDNEY: Josh?
Iraq, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Israel.
- And that's it?
- JOSH: There are some parts of Africa.
Wait!
I wish to make a short statement.
I won't be taking questions.
This morning, I was granted power to investigate the former British Prime Minister,
Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang, under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court.
I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang and the British government to ask for their full cooperation. Thank you.
Oh, God.
Okay, we need to get you to Washington,
Adam, right away.
My plane is at the airport.
We can get you in to see the Speaker of the House at lunchtime and have a photo-op with the Secretary of State in the afternoon.
Won't it look as if I'm panicking?
No, they'll both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago.
Well, what the hell are we supposed to be discussing?
SIDNEY: AIDS? Poverty? Climate change?
Who cares? The important thing is to show the world it's business as usual.
- What do you think, Ruth?
- I think it's a terrible idea.
You'll look as though you're America's whipping boy, running crying home to daddy.
- So, what would you do?
- RUTH: Fly to London.
The government will support you.
"The British government will cooperate fully with the investigation".
Really? And what makes you think that?
I'm not thinking it, Ruth, I'm reading it.
...believe we can now go live to the UN in New York, where the former British Foreign Secretary,
Richard Rycart, is about to make a statement.
I watched the announcement in The Hague today with great shock and sadness.
Adam Lang was and is an old friend of mine.
You cheeky bugger!
I regret that he's chosen to bring this down to a personal level.
This isn't personal. This is about justice.
This is about making sure every political leader knows when they make a decision, they will be held to account by international law.
Thank you.
MALE REPORTER:
If you're called to testify, sir, will you go?
- RICHARD: Certainly, I'll go.
- Of course you will, you little shit!
That settles it. Washington it is.
RUTH: I still say it'll look bad.
Not as bad as being led away from Heathrow in handcuffs.
It would show you had some guts.
Well, then why the hell don't you just fly back without me?
If the British government wants to hand me over to this kangaroo court, then sod them!
I'll go where people want me.
Amelia, tell the boys we're leaving.
Have one of the girls pack me a bag.
You'd better pack one for yourself.
Why don't you share a suitcase?
It's so much more convenient.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to abandon you.
At least this might help sales.
Perhaps Rhinehart's PR department organized the whole thing.
Well, tell them to stop it, will you?
Okay, people, remember, happy, happy faces.
MALE REPORTER: So, just to summarize what we know so far, it's now official, the special prosecutor of the International War Crimes Court is to launch an investigation...
...the special prosecutor announced she was going to investigate Mr. Lang, well, there was a big cheer, I can tell you.
So, let's talk to some of these protestors.
- You, sir, you're English, I believe.
- I am.
So, what brings you so far from home?
My son. He was killed in one of Mr. Lang's illegal wars.
Lang's never visited the injured.
He's never apologized.
I was in the British Army for 30 years.
It's a disgrace!
Thank you.
Can I ask you the same question?
You're a murderer, Lang!
You're a war criminal!
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Liar, liar, liar!
WOMAN: (OVER BULLHORN)
Lang, Lang, Lang!
CROWD: Killer, killer, killer!
WOMAN: Lang, Lang, Lang!
CROWD: Liar, liar, liar!
WOMAN: Lang, Lang, Lang!
CROWD: Killer, killer, killer!
MALE REPORTER 1: Over here, Mr. Lang!
I apologize for keeping you waiting so long in the cold.
MALE REPORTER 2: What's your reaction to Mr. Rycart's statement?
I'd like to say a few words in response to the news from The Hague.
These are strange times when those who stand for freedom and justice are accused of being criminals, while those who incite hatred and seek to destroy democracy
- are treated as victims.
- WOMAN: War criminal!
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.
While I have breath in my body,
I shall fight terrorism...
MAN: Liar!
...whether it's on the battlefield or, if necessary, in the courts.
Thank you very much.
FEMALE REPORTER: Have you spoken to the President, Mr. Lang?
Oh, for God's sake.
God.
Shit!
One minute!
Yes?
Sir? You want lunch?
That would be great.
Give me five minutes, thanks.
P. Emmett?
RICHARD: Richard Rycart.
Who is this?
- Dep?
- Sir?
Is there a map of the island that I could borrow?
Look. It's rain soon.
I don't know. I think it will be all right.
Why don't you take the car?
It's for guests. Here's the key.
- For our guests, it's very nice car.
- Oh. Yes.
Mr. McAra loved this car very, very much.
Do you know... I'm gonna take the...
I'm gonna take the bicycle. Thanks.
This is... Just a moment, just a moment.
It's rain. I give...
I give you my hat and my gloves.
- That's very kind, thank you.
- Good luck for you.
- Thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye.
- Bye-bye.
Just one moment.
God, you frightened me.
- You're British.
- I am, yeah.
It's okay, you can shelter. Sheltering's free.
No, no, no, no! Rosie, Rosie!
In you go. In, in.
Here.
- So, you're British, huh?
- Yeah.
- You anything to do with this fellow, Lang?
- In a way, yes.
Seems intelligent.
Now why did he go and get himself mixed up with that damn fool in the White House?
Well, that's what everyone wants to know.
What brings you to this part of the island?
I'm sightseeing.
Well, you sure picked a heck of a day for it.
Someone I knew was found washed up on the beach there.
- You mean the British guy from the ferry?
- That's right.
- Now that was a funny business.
- What do you mean?
No way should that current have carried him that far west.
- No?
- No way!
Are you sure?
I've lived here 54 years.
Did you mention that to the police?
The police? At my age,
I've better things to do, young man.
Annabeth's the one dealing with the police.
Your wife?
Annabeth Wurmbrand,
Mars Wurmbrand's widow.
She's the one who told them about the lights.
- Lights?
- The flashlights on the beach.
- When?
- The night the body was washed up.
Could, could you, um...
Could you point me in the direction of Mrs. Wurmbrand's house?
Oh, sure. You just...
Here. Follow it down the beach there.
It's the house nearest the ocean.
But she won't talk to you.
- Why not?
- She's in a coma.
Fell down stairs a week ago.
Been in a coma ever since.
RUTH: Come down!
Come down!
Dep told me you were here!
What?
I said Dep told me you were here.
We came to get you before the storm came.
What are you doing?
- Just taking the air.
- No, really.
I wanted to see where Mike McAra was found.
Why?
Adam's asked me to write something about him in the book.
- Where's your bike?
- Up there.
Barry, will you come around with the car?
We'll meet you out by the road.
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang.
Have to stay with you at all times.
For God's sake!
If we meet any terrorists, I'll text you.
All right, well, stay on the path.
Don't speak to anyone.
We won't talk to a soul, Officer, I promise.
Poor Mike. I can't bear the idea of him ending up so far from home.
I wonder if we'll ever know whether it was accident or suicide.
Can't help you. I never met him.
I suppose it doesn't really matter.
He was drunk. He drowned. End of story.
- What was he doing on the ferry?
- No idea.
Funeral's on Monday, in London.
I'm thinking of going.
One of us should put in an appearance, and it doesn't seem likely to be my husband.
I thought you didn't want to leave him.
Rather seems as though he's left me, wouldn't you say?
- Hello?
- Sorry. I did knock. It's just me.
- I brought you some dry clothes.
- That's all right. I can manage.
Dinner's in an hour, okay?
Fine, thanks. For God's sake.
GHOST: "It was at the time of the London elections
"that I first got to know Ruth.
"She had gained a First at Oxford
"and then done a year's postgraduate research as a Fulbright scholar".
Ruth.
Mmm.
- Perfect fit. Now all you need is a drink.
- What are we having?
Biodynamic white wine from the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley.
Rhinehart. He doesn't own a distillery, I suppose?
Mmm. Evening news.
FEMALE NEWSREADER: For war crimes.
Our political editor has more.
Christ, we're the lead story.
Pour us some more wine, will you?
I may have to get drunk for a change.
MALE NEWSREADER: In Washington,
Mr. Lang received firm promises of support, both from congressional leaders and the Secretary of State, before going on to a private dinner tonight with the Vice President.
Adam Lang has stood by America's side in the war against terror, and I'm proud to stand by his side this afternoon.
- Adam, good to see you.
- ADAM: Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.
It's good to see you.
Don't grin.
MALE NEWSREADER:
In Iraq, a suicide bomber...
For God's sake!
Adam.
Calling to find out how I think it went.
- Let him sweat.
- Does he always ask for your advice?
Yes, and always usually takes it.
Until lately.
- Are you married?
- Certainly not.
- Gay?
- No.
- Did you have a...
- I had a... Um...
- What? Girlfriend?
- Well, a bit more than that.
Partner?
A bit less than that.
I don't know,
40,000 years of human language and there's no word to describe our relationship.
It was doomed.
Come on. Let's eat.
- How's it going?
- The book?
- Well, it's not, to be honest.
- Sit there.
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.
I find it difficult to understand certain things.
- What things?
- Well...
I can't understand why this good-looking lad who goes to Cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls,
- suddenly ends up...
- Married to me?
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.
No, what I don't get is why, at 22, he's suddenly a political activist.
- I mean, where does that come from?
- Didn't you ask him?
He said he joined the party because of you.
Told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain.
- I was gonna start the whole book with it.
- And now you're not?
No, I can't. It's not true.
- Isn't it?
- Well, you know it's not.
He'd been a member for two years before he met you.
How do you know that?
I've got a copy of his original party membership card.
Mike McAra found it in the archives.
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story with too much research.
Did he find anything else?
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.
You were more political than he was.
I was certainly a change from his Cambridge girlfriends.
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.
And so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital, your knowledge and your contacts in the party.
And I thought he married me for my body.
Did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right?
Of course.
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?
Ouch.
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.
We are sensitive spirits.
Talking of spirits, could you...
Let me get you a proper drink.
White wine, never really seen the point of it.
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.
Ah! At last, something in common.
Do you know the coroner reckoned he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?
That's convenient.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
- You think his death was suspicious?
- Don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Today at the beach,
I met a man, an old timer who was familiar with the currents.
And he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot.
You're kidding.
He also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night.
And then she fell down the stairs, and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.
That's all you know? Jesus.
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Why?
I need to call Adam.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Aren't you gonna call him?
- Later. I'm going out for a walk.
But it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.
- It'll clear my head.
- Well, I'll come with you.
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one through on my own.
Stay here. Have another drink.
Don't wait up.
Are you awake?
- Well, I am now.
- I'm sorry.
It's all right. Hang on.
- What time is it?
- I don't know.
I called Adam.
- And?
- Can I come in?
The day before Mike died, he and Adam had a terrible row.
I've never told anyone this before, not even the police.
- What about?
- I don't know.
But it was furious. They never spoke again.
When I asked Adam about it, he refused to discuss it.
After what you just said,
I felt I should ask him again.
And what did he say?
He was having dinner with the Vice President.
That bloody Bly woman wouldn't even give him the phone.
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.
What's he got himself mixed up in?
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.
I'm scared.
I've never been scared in my life before, but I am now.
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched.
Let me get you a towel.
(SOFTLY) Bad idea.
Do you mind?
Course not.
The modesty of the morning after?
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
You mean you thought I'd be gone?
You've taken out the family tree.
He's very proud of the Langs.
You know, if you want a family tree, go to a garden center.
Why have you underlined my name every time?
I was surprised there wasn't more about you.
Why? I'm just the wife.
Yeah, even so.
You ought not to be written out of history.
Why not? Most women are.
Then I'll reinstate you.
I'll put in all the occasions that he's forgotten.
How kind. Like the boss's secretary that remembers his wife's birthday for him?
Something like that. But then, like you say, I'm not a proper writer.
- What are you planning to do?
- Leave.
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.
- Where will you go?
- Back to the hotel.
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed in a client's house.
- It always ends up with...
- With you screwing the client's wife?
No, not always.
But it does make it hard to maintain a professional distance.
And the thing we discussed last night?
What do you propose to do about that?
- That's none of my business.
- Well, you can't just ignore it.
Look, I'm his ghostwriter.
I'm not an investigative reporter.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.
Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells AII.
Well, if you ever decide to do that, give me a call.
You think I need someone like you to produce my book?
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.
And she can do the prison visits.
Morning, sir.
- Finished for the night, have we?
- Why don't you just piss off?
BMW ConnectedDrive.
Traffic is clear to your destination.
Join the road when possible.
In 200 yards, turn left.
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.
Turn around when possible.
This is getting ridiculous.
Turn around when possible.
All right, you win.
In 50 yards, turn left.
Turn left.
You've got to be joking.
Single or return?
Return. I hope.
Forty bucks, please.
- Have a good one.
- Ta.
Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.
A little more. Stop.
In 50 yards, turn left.
Please proceed to the indicated road.
In 200 yards, take the next exit.
In half a mile, make a sharp right turn.
Turn left.
In 200 yards, you will have reached your destination.
You have reached your destination.
Paul Emmett?
Professor Paul Emmett?
"Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University
"has written of the unique importance of the English-speaking peoples
"in the spread of democracy around the world.
"As these nations stand together,
"whenever they have faltered, tyranny has gathered strength".
NANCY: Hello?
- Is that Mrs. Emmett?
- Who is this?
I wondered if I might have a word with Professor Emmett.
Do you have an appointment?
It's about Adam Lang.
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.
Just a moment, please.
PAUL: This is Paul Emmett.
I think you must have made a mistake.
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?
We were contemporaries, yes, but I can't claim to know him.
I have a photograph of you together.
Come on up to the house.
I make it a rule never to see anyone without an appointment.
But your mention of a photograph rather tickled my curiosity.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.
Yes, he's here now.
- May I?
- Sure.
NANCY: Yes. Yes, he's on his own.
He didn't say.
British, about 40.
Well, well.
I literally have no recollection of this.
- But that is you?
- Yes, it is.
I was on the board of the Dramat.
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.
- The Dramat?
- I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.
I maintained my theatrical interests when I went to Cambridge for my doctoral research.
- Could I keep this?
- No, I'm afraid not.
- I'm sure I could get you a copy.
- Would you? That would be kind.
Maybe you could tell me how you came by it.
I'd be happy to.
Come into my study.
Yes, the wall of ego.
We all have one.
It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.
Have a seat.
So, the picture.
Um...
I've been working with Adam Lang on his memoirs.
Yes, I know, you told me.
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business, this posturing by The Hague.
As for Rycart, the worst
British Foreign Secretary since the war.
Lang was right to fire him.
- How well do you know Lang?
- Hardly at all.
- You seem surprised.
- He mentions you in his memoirs.
Oh, really?
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised.
What does he say?
That's very decent of him.
As Prime Minister, he always had good instincts.
- But that doesn't mean I know him.
- But the...
That. That was taken at a reception in London to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Arcadia.
- Arcadia?
- Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.
Very highbrow.
No reason why you should have heard of it.
The Prime Minister graced us with his presence.
What can you remember of him from Cambridge?
- I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.
No one's mentioned the Cambridge connection between us in all these years.
- But you performed together?
- In one production.
It was the summer revue.
I can't even remember what it was called.
- Can I show you something else?
- If you must.
Oh, my.
Is that what I think it is?
Let's hope he didn't inhale.
But that is you standing behind him, isn't it?
I do believe it is.
And I do believe I'm on the point of issuing a stern warning to him on the perils of drug abuse.
Is Mr. Lang really going to use these pictures in his memoirs?
If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.
My children would be mortified.
They're so much more puritanical than we were.
- Can you tell me about any of the others?
- No, I'm afraid not.
The whole summer is a blur, a very happy blur.
Now, you were going to tell me about these pictures.
I got them from Michael McAra.
And he is whom, exactly?
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.
- He resigned?
- No, he died.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, a couple of weeks ago.
He drove up here to see you.
And he died a few hours afterwards.
He drove up to see me?
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.
- How did he die?
- He drowned.
Poor fellow.
I've never really believed the myth that death by drowning is painless, have you?
Seems to me it must be agonizing.
And the police never said anything to you about this?
I've had no contact with the police.
But were you here that weekend?
This would have been
January, the 11th and 12th.
A less equable man than I might start to find your questions impertinent.
Nancy?
Nancy?
Our visitor wishes to know where we were on the 11th and 12th of January.
Do we possess that information?
That was the Colorado weekend.
Yes, of course, the Aspen Institute.
Bipolar relationships in a multi-polar world.
- Sounds fun.
- Yes, it was. I was the main speaker.
Look, just to return to Cambridge...
No, if you don't mind, let's not return to Cambridge.
I've said all I have to say on that subject.
I'm an avid reader of political memoirs.
I'll get hold of Mr. Lang's when they appear.
Perhaps he'll send you a copy, for old time's sake.
I doubt that very much.
The gate will open automatically.
Be sure to make a right when you get to the end of the drive.
If you turn left, the road will take you deeper into the woods and you may never be seen again.
BMW ConnectedDrive.
When is the last ferry?
- You're just in time.
- Here, I've got a return.
All right.
- FERRY MAN: Ticket?
- Uh...
- Okay.
- Okay.
Shit.
MAN: Hey, you! Stop!
Don't do that! Where you going?
WOMAN: Man, get out of here!
Get out of here, asshole!
Shit!
RICK: You've reached the office of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.
Piss off.
What can I do for you, sir?
You wouldn't happen to know if there are any flights leaving the airport tonight, would you?
Not unless you've got your own private jet.
I lent it to my butler.
(LAUGHING) You Brits!
There's a flight to Boston
- 8:30 tomorrow morning.
- Shit!
- How much for a room?
- For you, $89.
- I'll pay cash.
- Who's got your card? The nanny?
RICHARD: You rang back.
Are you going to stay on the line this time?
Yes.
I've been trying to call you.
I know, I'm sorry...
It didn't seem right, speaking to you.
Who are you?
I'm the new ghostwriter...
No names, don't use any names.
How did you get this number?
It was in my predecessor's effects.
The...
The thing is, I'm in trouble.
Is it because of your client?
Yeah.
There's something wrong, but I didn't know who to talk to.
Where are you? Without being too specific.
On the island?
I'm in the... No, I'm on the mainland, on the... This motel by the ferry.
Room number?
- Have you got the book with you?
- Yeah.
Okay. Stay there.
Hatherton?
MAN: With $35 billion of funds at its disposal, the Hatherton Group brings together a family of companies devoted to defense and security.
And with unrivaled expertise in the Middle East, including the services of two former Presidents, three Prime Ministers and two directors of the CIA,
Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront of the struggle against terror.
Hatherton, a shelter from harm.
"According to CIA whistleblower
Frank Molinari,
"Yale graduate Paul Emmett
"was reported to have joined the Agency as an officer in 1971,
"and was assigned to the Foreign
Resources Division of the Directorate of..."
It's 1974.
- Hello?
- RUTH: You're alive.
Yeah, just about.
I've been worried sick.
The police called to say they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!
I'm so sorry. I parked it, and then, and then I got off the boat.
What the hell were you doing on the mainland, anyway?
- I drove to New York.
- Why?
I needed to see John Maddox.
And where are you now?
I'm still at the ferry terminal.
I missed the last crossing.
You really are bloody hopeless!
I just had Adam on the phone, trying to get hold of you.
He's flying back tonight.
He sounds in a right state.
You didn't tell him about us, did you?
God's sake, Ruth!
I've got to go. I'll call you back.
- Who is it?
- Mr. Rycart sent me.
Hold on.
Just gonna do a quick check, if you don't mind.
Get your stuff together. We're leaving.
Hey! That's private!
- He's clean.
- RICHARD: Thanks, Frank.
Sorry about that. Please, get in.
- You thought it was a trap?
- It crossed my mind.
You do work for Lang.
Yeah, for three days. I hardly know the guy.
Who does? I worked for him for 15 years, till he fired me, and I still can't fathom him.
Yeah, his wife said more or less the same.
There you go. If someone as sharp as Ruth can't get him, what hope do we have?
- Tough day?
- Yeah, you could say that.
You have the book?
FRANK: Yeah.
He's got it.
Before we go any further, I wonder if I might take a look at that book.
No. Before we go any further, there's a few things I'd like to know first.
Such as, why did Mike McAra have your number?
Okay. Sure.
He was helping me.
McAra? How?
Mike found the documents linking Lang to the torture flights.
What? It was McAra who gave you the documents?
- Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal.
- But why?
He didn't like discovering he was working for a war criminal.
Would you?
Oh, I forgot. You are.
The book?
Well, don't tell me you're gonna read it now.
Not all of it. Just the beginning.
There's something very important about it.
Yeah. It's the cure for insomnia.
There you go, guys.
Can I get you anything else?
No, thanks, love.
Mike said he'd discovered something new.
It's the last time he called me.
He said it explained everything that had gone wrong when we were in government.
- What was it?
- He wouldn't say over the phone.
He just kept saying if anything happened to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.
"It's all there in the beginning".
The beginning?
Then he means Cambridge.
What the hell's this?
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?
On the day that Mike McAra died, he drove up to see Emmett, and I think he was murdered on his way home.
- What?
- I went to see Emmett today, and two guys followed me from his house.
That's why I called you.
At the time that this photograph was taken,
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.
Emmett?
- Foreign Resources Division.
- Oh, my God.
You realize how important this is, don't you?
This explains why Lang went into politics.
Everyone knows he didn't have a political thought in his pretty little head.
This is why he rose so quickly, with a little help from his friends.
- Well, do you think it's possible...
- Okay, a quiz for you.
Name one decision Lang made in 10 years as Prime Minister which wasn't in the interests of the USA.
Well, come on, it's not a trick question.
Iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense, buying American nuclear missiles, support of terrorist rendition.
The sacking of any minister
Washington didn't like, including yours truly.
McAra was right.
This explains everything.
It's Amelia Bly.
Answer it.
- Hello, Amelia.
- Good evening. I have Adam for you.
(SOFTLY) Lang.
ADAM: We're coming to get you.
What?
Ruth tells me you're stuck at the ferry terminal.
We've just taken off from New York.
Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up.
Really? There's no need.
We've got a book to write, remember?
Hold on a sec, Adam.
(SOFTLY) He said he wants to pick me up in his private jet.
- Say yes.
- What if it's a trap?
If you refuse, he'll get suspicious.
Tell him yes.
That'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks.
I'll get to the airport.
See you there.
He sounds worried.
I really don't think this is a good idea.
You have no choice.
Emmett must have told Lang that I'd been to see him.
So, what's he gonna do about it?
Dump you in the ocean?
- Well, it happened before!
- Which means it can't happen again.
He can't drown two ghostwriters, for God's sake. You're not kittens.
All this is just theory.
We don't have any proof.
- You'll get us the proof.
- Me?
You're his ghostwriter.
Presumably, he lets you tape him.
- I use discs, actually.
- Discs, tapes.
You've got to confront him with this.
Record his reaction.
Even if he denies it, it's something.
I'm in a tricky position here.
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
It's a bit late for that.
- It means the discs are his property.
- The court can subpoena them.
And what if I don't record any discs?
Then you'll be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story.
Then I'll deny it.
Then I'll give them this.
Frank is recording every word.
Aren't you, Frank?
Oh! Come on!
Don't look so shocked.
What did you expect?
That I'd come into a meeting with a man working for Lang without taking any precautions?
Except you're not working for Lang anymore.
You're working for the good guys.
You know all this is pointless, don't you?
In the end, he'll just retire over here with his CIA pension, and he'll tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.
Good evening, sir.
Hatherton welcomes you aboard.
Thank you.
It's my first time in a private jet.
Well, let's hope it's not your last.
Hi, man.
- Take your seat.
- Thanks.
- Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados.
- Yes, sir.
Do you mind?
Leave it off for now.
Ruth said you were in New York to see Maddox.
- That's right.
- How was he?
He was fine.
Full of energy?
- You know John.
- Yes, I do know John.
As a matter of fact, I was just with him.
You never saw him today, did you?
No.
Do you have something to tell me?
I went to see Emmett.
(LAUGHING) That windbag! Why?
I know about you and Emmett.
- Me and Emmett?
- I know that he was your...
- My?
...handler, if that's what they're called.
- My handler?
- Yeah, that he was your handler in the CIA.
Oh, my God.
You're serious, aren't you?
When McAra found this, he went to Boston to show it to Emmett, and he died on the way home, and I think he was murdered.
I think you've had a few too many of those already.
It was McAra who believed that Emmett told you to go into politics in the first place.
- Emmett? I barely knew the man.
- And that story of yours about why you joined the party and Ruth and the canvassing, well, the dates don't fit.
I got the dates wrong. Big deal!
Then when he found this photograph, and he heard the rumors about Emmett being in the CIA...
- Rumors?
- It's on the Internet.
I've never heard such utter balls in my entire life.
Mike would never have believed such crap.
He was too clever. Too loyal.
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.
- How do you know that?
- He told me.
Rycart?
He's lying.
This phone number on the back of the photograph, it's Rycart's.
The handwriting, that's McAra's.
Mike.
- Mike, Mike.
- And you knew he was disillusioned.
You had a big row with him just before he died.
Yes, I know, but he never mentioned this.
This is just... This is grotesque.
I've never taken orders from anyone.
Whatever I did,
I did because I believed it was right.
What, even supporting illegal kidnapping for torture?
Oh, for God's sake, spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit!
Do you know what I'd do if I was in power again?
I'd have two queues at airports.
One for flights where we'd done no background checks, infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties, used no intelligence gained by torture.
And on the other flight, we'd do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe.
And then we'd see which plane the Rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on!
And you can put that in the book!
MAN: Go home!
WOMAN: Go home!
MAN: Here comes the killer!
WOMAN: Prosecute for torture!
FEMALE REPORTER: Over here, Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang, will you live in America?
Mr. Lang, will you take
American citizenship?
When we get back to the house, we need to have a meeting.
- RUTH: Oh, my God!
- Murderer!
BODYGUARD: Firing from the roof!
RUTH: Let me go to him! No! No!
Move, move, move!
FBI AGENT 1:
How long had you known Mr. Lang?
- Couple of days.
- In what capacity?
I was his ghost.
His ghostwriter.
Do you recognize this man?
He was one of the protestors.
His son was killed in Iraq.
Did you ever speak with him?
He was in the bar one night in the hotel where I was staying.
FBI AGENT 2: But did you speak with him?
He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang was staying on the island.
- I told him that I didn't.
- Did you report this conversation?
Sorry?
Did you report this conversation to Mr. Lang's protection team?
No.
What was Mr. Lang's demeanor this evening?
He was... He was fine. He seemed fine.
One witness said she thought she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you.
No.
- We're gonna need your passport.
- Why?
A serious crime was just committed in US territory, and you're the key witness.
We need to keep you close.
MALE REPORTER: Like a fallen soldier,
Adam Lang went home today, home to a shocked and grieving nation.
Not just his family, but friends and political opponents joined in tribute.
A great colleague and a true patriot.
We had our disagreements, but we always stayed friends.
My heart goes out to Ruth and the family.
And I would like to say Adam will be...
Who is it?
RICK: Congratulations!
On what now?
Still having me as your agent. Hmm?
They don't need you anymore.
You're free to go.
- You ready to get back to work?
- I don't think I can, Rick.
- I'm sorry. Not after all this.
- Don't be a jerk.
This is a hot book now.
It's Adam Lang's voice from the grave.
- The guy, he's a hero.
- I just want to go home.
You can.
Go. Go home.
And finish the book from London.
I don't know, Rick.
Here we are.
Oh, here we are.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm over it, and then suddenly I realize I'm not.
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Of course. My invitation said plus one.
Only I wondered if you might've wanted to bring your husband.
That didn't work out.
I hadn't appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one.
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah.
- Amelia Bly, plus one.
- Thank you.
That was a bit of a turn-up, for the books, you calling me.
I heard you weren't invited, and I thought you should be here.
Ghosts are never invited to the launch party, as a rule.
We're an embarrassment.
Like a mistress at a wedding.
Sorry.
I brought you a present.
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES) That's very funny.
I thought, seeing as you were so keen to hold onto it, you might like it as a souvenir.
Between you and me, it wasn't us, it was the Americans.
They thought the book was a potential threat to national security.
But there's nothing in it.
Something about the beginnings.
I think that's what I heard.
- The beginning?
- No, beginnings. The beginnings.
Beginnings?
You all right?
Do you know that man?
The one who's speaking to Ruth.
- Paul Emmett?
- What's he doing here?
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard when she was a Fulbright scholar.
Why shouldn't he be here?
Do you mind if I have that back a second?
I'm...
WAITRESS: Madam?
WOMAN: No, thank you.
"Langs are Scottish folk, originally".
"Wife and child in tow, I decided to...
"I decided to settle".
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
Thank you.
I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.
I miss Adam all the time.
But never more than tonight.
Not just 'cause we're meeting to launch his wonderful new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us, but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and I'm so terrible.
"Langs are Scottish folk".
"Wife and child, Langs are Scottish".
"Wife, Langs. Lang's wife".
"Lang's
"wife Ruth
"was recruited
"as a CIA agent
"by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University".
RUTH: Well, you'll be relieved to hear
I'm not making a speech this evening.
I just want to thank our wonderful publishers,
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox, and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.
Mike, our thoughts are with you.
In these very difficult few months,
I've drawn great comfort from this book, from knowing that, despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them,
Mike and Adam did at least live long enough to complete it.
And I really believe that, as people read these pages,
Adam's voice will keep on coming through for generations to come, eloquent, strong and full of hope.
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.
If I've left out anyone's name,
I hope you'll forgive me.
But now I must make a toast.
To the memory of a great man and a great patriot, a wonderful husband and a devoted father.
To Adam!
ALL: To Adam!
You were marvelous.
MAN: Would you...
This one looks nasty.
Yeah, it's just happened just now.
Yeah, if you could.
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
Someone help us!
Giddap!
- It's the fourth ﬂoor, upstairs.
- Yes, sir.
Come on.
No!
Not my daughter! Mercy!
Give us room.
Stay there. Come on.
Not her!
- Break it down.
- Yes, sir.
Baltimore Police!
Give me some light.
Oh, no.
- It's empty.
- That's impossible.
We heard a door lock.
Damn it, the window!
It's nailed shut.
Dear God.
Phylum Chordata...
Subphylum Vertebrata.
With kittens...
The ways of God in nature, as in providence, are not our ways.
Lovely to see you all again.
Hello, Reagan. Did you miss me?
I'm naturally delighted to be back in Baltimore, but in all honesty
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.
However, it has been said that what brandy cannot cure has no cure.
So what say you to a snifter for an old, ailing friend?
I'm sorry. What?
Nothing.
I can assume, then, that you're out of brandy?
- We've got many bottles back there.
- So it's a question of finances.
I don't mean to shock you, Poe, but we haven't seen you in a while.
Last time you were here, well, things got rather ugly.
Been back in town only a few days to find quite shockingly,
I seem to have exhausted any sort of credit I once had.
Fine, fine. If it's money you want...
Try not to shit yourself.
That's real.
Spot these sailors a round, too, on me.
Christ, man, now what?
That'll just about cover the last tab.
Are you really gonna be this cruel?
The "Patriot" is publishing a review tomorrow. I'll be ﬂush by dawn.
If the paper publishes anything you write, you come back tomorrow,
I'll buy you the shot.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow I might be dead.
Or you might be.
- I'll risk it.
- How's this?
I get a drink for any man here who recognises me or one of my poems.
Better get to the door before I split your head open.
My head is already split open, you overgrown mouth-breather.
So show me some respect or I'll give you a personal tour.
I'm an internationally lauded poet.
That's why you've got no money.
- I am Poe.
- That's what I said.
Not poor, mouth-breather! Poe!
Poe! Edgar Allan Poe!
Does it ring a bell?!
No.
A drink to any man in this room who can finish this line!
"Quoth the Raven..."
- Piss off!
- By IP Daley!
I repeat: "Quoth the Raven"!
- "Nevermore!"
- Hah! Hah!
It is a very favourite poem.
- Vive la France!
Slobs!
Philistines!
You wouldn't recognise an authentic American literary voice if it hissed in one ear and slithered out the other.
We know it hurts to pick your teeth up with broke fingers.
Is that your imagination's limit, you mental oyster?
I can conjure a multitude of more exquisite torments.
Your eyeballs dissolving in a teaspoon of lye!
Your tongue torn from your throat with a blacksmith's tongs!
An enema of boiling tar!
A testicle impaled on a kebab skewer!
Get out, you shit!
Slowly. Here.
Put her down.
She's just a girl.
What kind of monster would do this?
Katherine LaForte, 36.
Her daughter Anna, 12.
She was strangled.
She's so young.
He was a large man.
By the extent of his grip, over eight inches from thumb to forefinger.
You agree someone locked the door from the inside?
Absolutely. We heard the door lock as we arrived.
And by the time you broke down the door, the murderer was gone.
Not a trace.
The window was closed when you came into the room?
Not just closed, nailed shut.
Tell me, how does such a large man escape so quickly from a room in which the door has been locked from the inside... and the window nailed shut?
I'm not sure, but the mayor wants results this time, Inspector.
Question the neighbours.
I want a list of all the men who visited these premises.
Yes, sir.
A lock... triggered by a spring.
But the nail had...
Cut, mid-shaft.
I checked the window ten times and never found a spring.
I wouldn't have found it either except...
What is it?
This crime is familiar to me.
Giddap!
Whoa!
Not again, Mr Poe.
Christ.
Good morning, Percy.
Contrary to precedent, Captain
Hamilton, I've no intention...
..of asking for money.
What do you want, Poe?
I've come back to town for your daughter.
- Over my dead body.
- Is that an option?
Poe, please.
You know I find you as revolting as some of your stupid stories.
Some, but not all.
You look lovely today.
Get out, Poe, before I shoot you where you sit.
And risk splattering blood and brains over your daughter's fine silk dress?
- Out.
- Is an invitation...
...to the costume ball out of the question?
- Father, don't.
- Sorry, Charles.
- See you at the track.
- See you, Edgar.
Giddap!
Another abject humiliation.
Please! Mercy!
I have children!
Why are you doing this? Why?!
I'm only a critic!
- Aaaaarghhh!
Good morning. "Baltimore Patriot."
Mr Poe! Your clothes.
Just beating the mudslingers to it.
Fortitude, Ivan, fortitude.
I'm afraid you might need more than this, Mr Poe.
- Why?
- It's a crime, a terrible crime.
Out with it, man. What is it?
Did that marsupial of an editor dare to change my review again?
I told him not to touch it.
I told him, Mr Poe.
Where's my review? Where is it?
What has he done?
He said there was no more room in the layout.
No more room? No more room?
Pray tell, what fine twat did he deem more worthy?
Longfellow!
Longfellow?!
Longfellow!
Where is it?
- Where is what?
- The trash bin.
That is where all this brain-sucking, soul-warping fish wrap should be put!
That's lovely, Eddy.
A real show of adjectival fireworks from the great Poe himself.
Not only do you refuse to print my review of Longfellow, but you run his third-rate poem instead!
- People like Longfellow.
- Editors like you tell them to.
Have you no soul, Henry?
Does the artistic enrichment of your readers mean nothing to you?
Artistic enrichment?
You've got some gall, barging into my office and lecturing me when ail you do is criticise others' work!
Not true. Not true at all.
You called Emerson a "sad, festering literary whore".
Because he is precisely that.
Is honesty now a vice, or do you prefer that jaded hack, Griswold, fawning over some steaming mound of hackneyed tripe?
- Doesn't think much of YOUR stuff.
- He's an intellectual nonentity.
He's a buffoon, which is probably why he's so at home here with you.
Aw, you're out of control.
I'm broke.
Then try writing another "Tell-Tale Heart".
People love blood. They love death.
If I couldn't churn out a "Tell-Tale
Heart" or a "Pit and the Pendulum“,
I'd indenture my very soul to the devil.
You've got to publish my review.
I'm desperate.
I need stories. Gripping stories.
I've got nothing left.
I've used up all my tricks.
Try laying off the liquor and tinctures. It's rotting your brain.
I only drink occasionally, to be social, to alleviate my shyness.
And the tinctures are purely therapeutic.
A slight palliative against the chill of an orphan's despair.
- Write me something I can sell.
- You're a real bastard, Henry.
Why are you doing this?!
Why?!
What have I done?!
Please!
No!
Aargh!
Agh! Argh!
Aaaargh!
AAARGHH!
Consider, Carl, if you will, the human heart.
This small chamber, a vacancy, where gases are wed to ﬂuids and all the secrets and mysteries of our species are hidden.
Write another "Tell-Tale Heart".
You think you're so clever, don't you?
Miss Hamilton.
"The angels,"
"not half so happy in heaven,"
"Went envying her and me"
"Yes - that was the reason,"
"as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea,"
"That the wind came out of the clouds by night"
"Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee."
Continue.
"But our love... it was stronger by far than the love"
"Of those who were older than we"
"Of many far wiser than we"
"And neither the angels in heaven above,"
"Nor the demons down under the sea,"
"Can ever dissever my soul from the soul"
"Of the beautiful Annabel Lee."
Do you like it?
I think that it is the most romantic thing I've ever read.
So, I had to hear about your stunt all afternoon.
I wanted to see if I could get that vein on the side of his neck
- to finally explode.
I think Father has begun to suspect.
Yes, and I consider it my duty to wrestle you away from that gun-toting Philistine.
And into the arms of you, of all people?
- Who better?
- Then why antagonise him?
I can't help it.
I despise people who despise me.
Edgar, we need to talk.
- What is Carl eating?
- A heart.
- A human heart?
- Mm-hm.
- How in heaven did you come by it?
- An admirer works at the morgue.
I was searching for inspiration.
So tell me again exactly... how much... money you made from your self-proclaimed world-famous poem about that bird?
Raven. $9. But did I mention that it's world-famous?
Edgar... Edgar.
We can't go on like this.
Emily, what do you want?
I want you to get up off your knees unless you intend to use that position for another purpose.
The imagination reels with possibilities.
But what did you have in mind specifically?
A proposal.
- You mean marriage?
It's not such a horrible thought.
People still do it from time to time.
- Really? When?
- When they're in love, I suppose.
If I were in love with that person, would I think about her all the time?
Most likely.
And would I spend every waking moment desiring to smother the other with affection?
It has been described as such.
Emily, you are my greatest
- and only - inspiration.
Emily Hamilton, will you be my wife?
Yes.
I love you.
You ridiculous man.
Now, what do we do about your dear, dear, gun-toting father?
I've been thinking about that.
We'll tell him at my birthday ball, in front of all of Baltimore.
If I were a better man,
I'd forbid it.
But you're not.
- I know.
I found some possibilities for you, Inspector.
All are gruesome, if you ask me.
"A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring."
"I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery,"
"forbore to upraise the sash."
That's it.
Edgar Allan Poe.
Find the Raven, never flitting still is sitting, still is sitting
On that pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him steaming throws his shadow on the ﬂoor;
My soul from out that shadow that lies ﬂoating on the ﬂoor
Shall be lifted... nevermore.
Who's next?
It's called
"The Butterﬂy and the Bee".
An exquisite title, Mrs Bradley.
"The butterﬂy to her brother bee did sing a song of spring."
'"Come, listen to my ode of thee, thou honey-making thing..."
Stop, please.
It's terrible. I suspected it was.
"Thou honey-making thing"?
- I attempted to rhyme the lyric.
- You've succeeded.
The juxtaposition of the beauty of nature with the whores of our recently mechanized society, reducing brother bee to nothing more than a "honey-making thing", a meaningless cog bound for destruction within the machine of nature.
It's brilliant, Mrs Bradley!
It's terrifying, but it's brilliant.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
- Someone's here to see you.
- Excellent. Who?
Mr Poe?
Barbarian with a badge.
What's going on?
- Why is hair attracted to a magnet?
- What?
Soot is merely carbon residue from coal and wood.
Am I under arrest?
I'm Detective Fields.
Please, sit down, Mr Poe.
Yes, the infamous Detective Fields.
Am I under arrest?
No. Not as yet.
Then I'd rather stand.
It makes it easier to leave.
I am...
I'm a reader of your work.
I admit my admirers have gone to great lengths to meet me.
I didn't say I was an admirer.
And yet you read them.
The night before last a girl and her mother were found murdered, the daughter lodged in a chimney, the mother's head nearly severed with a straight razor.
The killer ﬂed through a window in which a lock was feigned with a nail sawn in half.
Does any of this sound familiar to you, Mr Poe?
But you're talking about my story.
A work of fiction.
I'm afraid I'm not.
According to various witnesses, you were seen drunk two nights ago in a tavern near the harbour.
What time did you leave?
I don't remember.
My leaving was... involuntary.
Do you actually think that I murdered these people?
May I see your hand?
Which one?
Either will do.
Perhaps with the aid of accomplices such a scenario might be conceivable, however improbable.
Yet what cannot be disputed is the fact that your imagination has inspired a horrendous crime.
Am I to be charged, then?
Is imagination now a felony?
- Come!
Inspector, can I have a word?
This is Henry Maddux, editor of the "Baltimore Patriot".
He was brought in to identify the body.
His name is... I mean, was...
Gris... Griswold.
- Ludwig Griswold.
- He worked for you?
- Freelance writer.
- What things did he write?
Some poetry. Mostly criticism.
You know, the easy stuff.
Did he have a relationship with Edgar Allan Poe?
Of course. They hated each other.
Had a vicious feud a year ago.
Sold a lot of papers.
- How long have you known Mr Poe?
- Edgar? Well, the past ten years.
You published his story,
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue".
He wrote that several years back in Philadelphia.
I reprinted it a couple of times here.
People love the gory ones.
So they do.
Edgar isn't a suspect, is he, Inspector?
At this point everyone is a suspect,
Mr Maddux.
Forgive me.
I know there is a darkness to Edgar, but... they're all up in here.
Every woman he's ever loved has died in his arms.
I believe that God gave him a spark of genius and quenched it in misery.
But as far as something like this...
The only thing he's ever killed is a bottle of brandy.
Thank you for your time, sir.
This may come as a shock to you, Mr Poe, but we are in dire need of your unwholesome expertise.
I really hadn't imagined the counterweight to be... so large.
We have reason to believe you knew the victim.
- Really?
- If you would?
I don't believe I know him.
Then perhaps this will jar your memory.
"Never has the perfunctoriness of plot"
"been so mechanized and twisted by soulless contrivance..."
- Griswold.
- So you do know him.
Yes.
We traded barbs, as in words not actual weapons of any sort as writers do to sell a few newspapers.
"The Pit and the Pendulum", when was it published?
'42. "Tales of Ratiocination."
Are there other stories in the collection?
- Many.
- Specifically about murder?
I'm afraid so.
As unfortunate as this is, you may be uniquely qualified to cast light on our killer.
There is logic underlying these deaths.
Do you think this comes from a logical mind?
A man who carves a human being in half doesn't come from a place of logic.
- Then from where?
- Mental disease. Obsession.
Passion.
I believe the killer is taunting us.
He wants us to know he's gonna strike again.
What do you make of this?
- It was covering the victim's face.
- "The Masque of the Red Death."
What is it?
The quote from the story mentions
Prospero, a character I created to symbolise man's arrogance even when confronted with certain death.
Prospero hosts a costume ball where Death comes in disguise.
Charles Hamilton is hosting a ball tomorrow night at the museum.
"And one by one dropped the revellers"
"in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, "
If "The Masque of the Red Death" is his next intended story, we must use this opportunity to capture this man at your ball.
Too harsh. I want something older.
"And Darkness and Decay..."
Six cases should be enough.
"And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death"
"held illimitable dominion over all."
So this gentleman dresses up like a... what? Like a...
The figure was shrouded “head to foot in the habiliments of the grave“.
Like a corpse, or a skeleton?
Then, at the stroke of midnight, he comes in and kills everybody?
Poe is a damn viper.
I ordered him away from Emily.
- Now he's trying to...
- Sir...
The similarities are too coincidental.
I'm asking you again.
Allow me to have my men scattered about your ball, in costume, so we can hopefully catch this monster.
I'll hire extra security myself, but I will not have this turned into
a policeman's ball.
Understood?
I've seen the effects of this man's determination.
If he has chosen your gathering to...
You will not destroy an evening
Baltimore looks forward to each year.
Then I insist my officers be present.
Fine. Just make sure they scrape the shit off their boots.
Who was Prospero?
He was the host of the ball.
And the first to die.
CHOPIN'S "NOCTURNE")
She's so wonderfully full of life.
- I've been reading...
- What's he doing here?
- He's with me. We were just leaving.
- Captain.
Just proving how easy it is to penetrate the breach.
I presume the police are here to keep me out.
Mr Fields, if Mr Poe is a part of your investigation...
Mr Poe has a unique perspective on aspects of this crime.
Why? Is the killer an alcoholic, an opium addict and atheist?
An atheist?
You misconstrue me, sir.
Poe, you stay away from my daughter.
Father, I've decided to change my costume for the ball tomorrow.
No.
Mr Fields, I'm happy to indulge your request for security, but if I see him tomorrow night, you'll have to protect him from me.
Why do we need security?
My writing has become the inspiration to an actual killer.
Quite gruesome, really.
If I'd known my work had a morbid effect on people,
I'd have devoted more time to eroticism.
You're a vile little man.
As I said, we were just leaving.
- Yes.
- Percy, show this man to the door.
Mrs Bradley, could you join me in the other room?
What is going on?
Emily.
We should reconsider our announcement.
- Why? Are you backing out?
- No, never.
If your father sees me there, he may have me shot.
And a depraved killer may be on the guest list.
It's a bit much for one night, don't you think?
I think it sounds thrilling.
Does it? Why?
How else should Edgar Allan Poe commit himself to eternal love other than under threat of death?
The Grim Reaper. A ghost.
The Headless Horseman, if you like.
He should be easy to spot.
Elderidge, take some of these men and patrol the back.
Sir.
You must be selling a lot of newspapers. Two murders in a week.
Circulation has indeed improved, despite unfortunate events.
Time for a piss.
- May I have this dance?
- Father.
Not now.
I'm not sure what's troubling you, but your future happiness means more to me than I could possibly describe.
I really hope you feel that way at the end of the evening.
Whatever this is about,
I need you to be more social.
It is an important gathering for me and for us.
Father, I know what's expected.
Excuse me! Please.
Please, step aside.
Step aside!
Fields' men aren't causing any trouble?
No, sir.
What of Poe? Any sign of him?
Not so far.
A glass of wine, sir?
You look just stunning, my dear.
Nevermore.
"..Can ever dissever my soul from the soul"
"Of the..."
I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone.
"Of the beautiful Annabel... Lee."
You dance passionately, sir.
If I could, I would dance with you throughout time.
- I love you, Edgar.
- And I you.
- You really are a reckless girl...
...to dance with a stranger with a mask, with a murderer in our midst.
- Speaking of which...
- Courage, Edgar.
- It's happening! This way.
Oh, Edgar!
Emily!
Agh!
He told me you'd ordered it for the party.
- Who? Who ordered it?
- I'm supposed to deliver this.
My daughter. He has her.
- Percy! Seal off this building!
- Find her!
- Come on!
"I challenge the brilliant detective mind of Edgar Allan Poe."
"A game of wits with Emily's life in the balance."
"You will immortalise for the exquisite pleasure of your readers"
“this, your very own
'Descent into the Maelstrom',"
"which shall appear in serial form in the 'Baltimore Patriot'."
"Know that I will kill again, and on that new corpse"
"I will leave you clues that will lead to Emily."
"If I do not read a vivid accounting of this convergence"
"of fact and fiction, then dear Emily will die."
"Your only hope is to imagine a way to save her."
"I dare you to try to conceive of the painstaking care"
"I have taken to secure her"
"and the elegant means leading inexorably to her end."
"Are you up to the task, Mr Poe?"
"Are you even capable of imagining"
"the means to save your beloved's life?"
"Or shall this tale end as all your stories do,"
"with Madness, Sin and Horror the soul of the plot?"
Your men are right. I've killed her.
We must assume
Miss Hamilton is still alive.
Why must we assume that? Because it's more convenient to do so?
Why am I to blame?
Where were all these officers last night?!
Where were you?!
He told you he was coming!
Mr Poe, listen to me.
This killer is methodical.
He will keep her alive to keep you involved.
It's part of his game and that's the logic that will trap him.
It's the facts of this case that give us the advantage.
Did you tell your people to familiarise themselves with my face?
They'll see it every hour till my daughter is returned to me.
Mr Hamilton, I'm very sorry.
As well you should be!
She was taken under your watch.
- Sir, if you would please...
- What the hell is HE doing here?
- Bastard!
- Hey!
Arrest him. It's his fault.
There is plenty of fault to be passed around.
I'm sure you understand what I mean by that, Mr Hamilton.
Mr Poe here is our only connection to the man who has your daughter.
I suggest you remember that.
Out of the way.
We will reconvene in two hours.
Until then, I want every street in Baltimore manned. Understood?
Yes, sir.
Lord help my poor soul.
Oh. Oh, Lord.
Wait. No. No...
Wait... Please...
- Help! Let me out!
Let me out of here!
- No, stop! Stop!
Shut it, Emily, or I'll shut it for you.
OK.
OK. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
The human body is to be revered.
We must at all times be respectful and remember that a cadaver is more than a mere learning tool.
We shall examine the lungs.
This man is an alleged victim of consumption.
Professor? What is it?
Dear God.
She could be a prostitute, the way she's painted up.
Did you open this?
Were your hands clean?
Yes. I don't believe
I left that smudge, Inspector.
She must have fought him or scratched him.
She didn't fight him.
There are no wounds on her wrists.
It can't be her blood, Inspector.
He came at her from behind.
Strangled.
Another of your stories?
Mr Poe, I asked is this another of your stories?
"The Mystery of Marie Roget."
It's a sailing knot.
It's a bowline knot, to be exact.
Just as it was in the story.
All right. Then what of it?
Who was she?
She was a girl... who worked in the stores in Paris near the Quais.
She drowned. There was no mention of blood on her hands.
He added that detail.
You must write it now. Every detail.
The knot, her dress, her hands.
Her eyes. Her end.
Her smile portended nothing.
Her innocence was the first part of her soul to die.
And while it happened, he stood still,
watching to fully enjoy the dreadful metamorphosis
from a life full of hope
to death without purpose.
Mr Poe.
I've been, erm...
I'm sorry to disturb you but...
I was a little concerned about your...
- My progress?
- Yes.
I feel as if I've gone from author to character in one of my tales.
As trapped and bedevilled as any of the hapless bastards I ever created.
I can appreciate that.
Regardless of what you think of me, Fields,
I am a master of my art, and I will not fail her.
I know that.
Look, I... I think I was overly harsh with you the other day, and for that I'd like to apologise.
My wife was singing at the piano when she first coughed up blood.
I prepared myself for the worst, but Virginia seemed to recover, and foolishly I succumbed to hope.
But by year's end the blood came again... and again.
Great effusions of blood.
Raging fevers, her sheets spattered with crimson, drenched with sweat.
I often thought I could hear the sound of darkness as it stole across the horizon rushing towards me.
But here I...
I was overwhelmed by a sorrow so poignant, when she finally died I felt in all candour a great release.
But it was supplanted by the return of that dark and morbid melancholy that followed me like a black dog... all my life... until I met Emily.
Time is running out, Inspector.
Do you really believe she's still alive?
I'm sure of it.
Magnificent.
Poe, you have done it again.
The invention is... breath-taking.
The line of truth and fiction has never been so...
So...
I'm not sure about your headline.
Henry, you will not change one word.
Fine. Ivan? Ivan...
Reset page one immediately.
..melancholy that's followed me like a black dog all my life...
I love you, Edgar.
Fields!
- The blood, Poe, it's fake!
- The blood?
The prostitute. She's no prostitute.
It's stage blood. She's an actress.
- The blood on the hands. "Macbeth."
- Exactly.
Poe's like the hangman, the bastard, making money off the dead.
Get your paper!
About a serial killer on the loose!
Cantrell is at the theatre.
All the exits are secured.
The Imperial, I'm assuming.
My mother's playhouse.
The victim was still in her costume, which suggests she was abducted directly from the theatre.
We'll find her.
I would gladly give my life for hers,
Mr Fields.
I know you would.
Out, damned spot. Out, I say!
One, two...
...then, 'tis time to do it!
Hell is murky!
Who are you?
Police. I have a warrant to search these premises.
What for? There's a show on!
- Bring all stagehands now.
- They have to man the ropes.
First Lady Macbeth takes a powder, and now you bastards...
Ten seconds.
Put out your hands.
Ladies and gentlemen, the play will resume shortly.
Please take your seats.
You, step forth.
Take off the gloves.
- Is this your entire crew?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- I am.
- Count them again.
What are you doin?!
We've got seven minutes before the act change.
- You, where are you from?
- Liverpool.
Got three days' shore leave to make extra scratch.
- So if you don't mind, please...
- Read it.
It's "Macbeth". I know the play.
- Someone's missing.
- Who?
- Maurice.
- Where is he?
I don't know, but nobody's allowed to leave until the show is over.
He's here.
If any of them try to leave, shoot them.
Yes, sir.
...put on your nightgown...
You there, come out. Show yourself.
Stop!
Show yourself!
I will kill you!
I have a pistol aimed on you.
Come out now. Put your hands where I can see them or I will fire.
Don't shoot me!
I'm in the play!
You're all right.
You stay here, OK?
- What happened?
- My pistol, I lost it.
- I saw him.
- Damn it.
- Seal the doors! He's here!
- Yes, sir!
The missing stagehand, what was his name?
Maurice.
Hey! Where do the crew keep their things?
We have lockers downstairs.
Here. Poe!
Fields, up here.
What is that?
Looks like a piece of fish.
That is a human tongue.
What does it mean?
Wait. Yes. "The Facts in the Case of M Valdemar."
A man's suspended between life and death by mesmerism.
A living corpse who can only speak via the vibrations of his tongue.
It's a bit of burlesque.
But the tongue wasn't severed.
Mr Poe! Sir, there's been an accident.
Put your backs into it!
Come on! Keep it going!
We're gonna need more!
The fire's not going to put itself out! Come on!
Jack, get all those people back from the building!
Please, step back! Move back!
It's not safe. Get back, sir.
Everybody, get back!
A damnation on earth.
Hell's brimstone his food, consumed from birth, in solitude.
Let's go, men! Move it, move it!
The windows were shattered first.
I don't think it was an accident.
I'm certain you're correct.
- Sir, we also found this.
I'll take it if it's not yours.
He's stuck with us since we got here.
I can tell from the sound of his voice he's mine.
Thank you, Officer.
Why are you doing this to me?
Please let me out.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can.
Please.
I'm so cold.
Why are you doing it?
Please don't let me die in here.
Miss Hamilton...
No! No! No!
Mr Poe.
I'm afraid I found myself without lodgings.
Yes, I heard.
I don't mean to impose.
Oh, yes, of course.
Forgive me, please. Come in.
It appears to Baltimore I've become one of the very demons I conceived.
- The fire was intentional.
- Yes, I heard.
The town is angry.
The mayor wants results.
Another set of unsolved murders?
Is that it?
He was inches away.
If I hadn't dropped my weapon...
Perhaps.
But we have made some headway.
According to theatre records, the sailor's name is Maurice Robichaux.
Does that mean anything to you?
No.
Cantrell and I made some inquiries at the docks.
He was signed on to a trading vessel which made port five days ago.
The start of the murders.
And, like many sailors, he took employment in the theatre, working the backstage riggings.
But, as we know, he wasn't there today.
Everything down to our entrance was prearranged.
Look, it may be arduous, but I've learned, in order to find a needle in a haystack, you have to go through the hay.
- These ship's records I think...
- Ship's records?
I must remind you, Mr Poe, every detail here is essential.
Tell me, are you not piqued by your abject failure to ferret out this assassin?
Your reputation is at stake.
Look at me.
Four people are dead!
An angel breaks on the rack of some depraved beast, but this clerk squints over his eyeshades at ledgers and timetables!
Is this a fucking joke?!
What else should we do?!
Run around all of Baltimore screaming out her name?!
Now, please, think.
Start with the sailor.
Have you ever written anything about a sailor?
No.
Did you speak with the ship captain?
- I did.
- And?
Robichaux was a valued crewman.
Well liked.
Had a family back home.
- Where?
- In France.
Nimes.
- Anything?
- No.
Yes. Possibly. Who knows?
You see, what I keep asking myself is... why Baltimore?
The Fortunato had docked in ports around the world.
- The what?
- All over the world.
- The name of the ship, say it again.
- Fortunato.
"The thousand injuries of Fortunato
I had borne as I best could."
What is that?
The first sentence of
"The Cask of Amontillado".
- Go on.
- A story I wrote about revenge.
A man kills his rival by walling him up. Fortunato is entombed alive.
- Where?
- In the catacombs of a palazzo.
- The story is set in Italy.
- There are no catacombs here.
No, but there are tunnels underneath the city.
Tunnels?
The waterworks.
You are looking for anything that would indicate recently laid masonry.
We will be timing this.
I will blow my whistle as such...
We will then shout her name in unison from all areas of the tunnels.
Emily!
There'll be a pause often seconds of absolute silence when we will listen for the smallest sound.
Anything to indicate movement from behind the walls.
If an officer detects something, he will blow his whistle and we will examine the wall at that point.
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.
Then move out.
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
- Shh!
Emily!
- Emily!
EMILY!
Over here.
They're down here.
The mortar's a different colour.
Look.
Hold that.
Here. Stand back.
What is it? Do you have hen?
- Give me that.
- What is it, Inspector?
- Keep digging.
- Yes, sir.
Halt!
Aaarghhh!
- Get the doctor.
"Do not bemoan the sailor's life."
"He was always sure to die anyway."
"But his demise did serve a purpose of leaving you clues."
"Godspeed, Poe.
Emily weakens by the hour,"
"both physically and spiritually."
I will kill him.
No matter how this ends,
I will kill this perversion of a man.
"Godspeed"?
Even his prose is barbaric.
Why dress him up like Miss Hamilton?
For the thrill of watching me suffer.
Here, John. Bring the light closer.
I think I've found something.
What is that?
Help me turn him over.
I think we've found our missing sailor.
It's a sextant.
Natural choice for a seaman,
I suppose.
My brother, he went to sea.
A lot of men, they get these in the Orient.
This notch in the ﬂesh is fresh.
It's still clotted.
The killer did this.
Think it was part of the struggle?
- Too deliberate.
- It's a latitudinal co-ordinate.
If you mark the angle of the sun at its highest point it shows you how far you are from the equator.
It's useless without longitude.
Even in the army they teach basic navigation.
I went to West Point.
I was expelled, don't worry.
Fields, look there.
Get me a scalpel.
Here.
His tongue has been removed.
And this... has replaced it.
What's it for?
Longitude.
Pen and paper.
He's giving us a location.
- Open up! Open the door!
Where's Hamilton?
- Hamilton!
- What's happened?
We need your navigational maps and celestial almanacs.
- Why?
- He gave us the location of Emily.
This watch is mine.
I thought I'd lost it.
- The kilter left this?
- On the dead sailor.
- In, to be more exact.
- The utter gall.
Along with the latitudinal co-ordinates.
Incredible.
Forgive me. I have no background in navigational techniques.
To plot an exact position, you need three things: a sextant, an accurate chronometer and a celestial almanac.
The almanac tells the exact time at which the sun hits its zenith.
- Exact noon.
- Shall I bring more?
Leave it! Please.
It's all right, Percy. Get another.
If your watch is set to Greenwich
Mean Time, you can calculate how far east or west of Greenwich, London you are.
Twelve... twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight, rather.
- Which one, damn it?
- Twenty-eight.
- Twelve twenty-eight, right?
- Yes.
Longitude is a measure of time east or west.
Latitude, distance from the equator.
That's north or south.
Seventeen degrees north.
The West Indies? It can't be.
He couldn't have transported her that far.
Here. St Croix.
That's impossible. The Danish
West Indies is a two-week journey.
It's not an island, St Croix.
Holy Cross.
Holy Cross!
Holy Cross Church.
That's our parish.
Giddap!
Cantrell, you and the others around back.
Spread out. If need be, break a window. We must get inside!
- Emily!
- Come on!
Emily!
North-west corner!
John!
- Don't move, John.
- Argh!
He's over here!
There! Black horse!
Steady.
- Fields?
- Get him!
Find him, Edgar! Go!
- Your name!
You coward!
Who are you?!
Poe!
Poe!
The killer escaped.
My horse is gone.
What about Fields? He was shot.
He's at Doc Clements'.
What of you?
The paper goes to press in three hours.
There was an empty grave.
It had Emily's name on it.
That was his clue.
That's why he sent us there.
Perhaps, or to kill again.
I'm sorry, Poe. This is my fault.
I should never have gene ahead with the hall.
These were my stories.
Your daughter's love for me is the reason another man's dead.
Go to Doc Clements.
I have one more story to write.
Edgar.
For today, she's still alive.
Doctor, let me go!
Let me go!
We're running out of time!
For God's sake, a bullet is in your chest!
Lie down and let me do my job before you bleed to death.
The son of a bitch is gonna kill her today.
So you cut the bullet out and you patch me up now!
There's a bottle of whiskey in the kitchen. Bring it here.
- What the hell is that?
- A magnet.
To find the bullet to cut it out.
Soak that pillowcase in the whiskey, and give him the rest. He'll need it.
The gossamer white of bone
was now visible beneath the tattered meat of her fingertips,
as Emily clawed madly at the wooden slats of her coffin,
a desperate, drowning animal.
The dirt rose around her, the inescapable sand of an hourglass,
as her final breath of air
slipped her into the twilight of consciousness until.
He knew now that all hope was lost.
He had failed his beloved, and there was one last thing left to do.
One last act.
"A final desperate plea: one life offered for another's."
Oh, Mr Poe, no... No, you can't!
- Set the print, Ivan.
- But, sir...
Do it!
You can't take it as your fault,
Mr Poe.
Is there someone else you'd blame?
It's the killer who's to blame, sir.
- Let me read that.
- Sir, I need to...
"Poe could feel the poison already feeding on his blood,"
"as the maggots were soon to do."
Jesus, Edgar...
- Making enough money, Henry?!
- Mr Poe, don't! Mr Poe!
Will it sell?!
- Will it?!
- Mr Poe!
You madman!
I'll have you thrown in jail, you damned animal!
I'll send you to hell! Huh?! Hell!
Mr Poe, don't. It's not worth it.
Clements!
I'm sorry, Mr Poe. I fell asleep waiting for you and the inspector.
- What time is it?
- Just past six, sir.
The paper's here for you.
Rather remarkable seeing that people are stealing others' papers.
They can't print enough, with the election today and this horrible killing they keep writing about.
Here's something else for you,
Mr Poe.
"It is a masterpiece, Mr Poe.
An epitaph worthy of your gifts."
- When did this come?
- I don't know, but before the paper.
- How do you know that?
- It was under the paper.
Impossible.
Look at the streaks in the ink.
- I don't understand.
- It's been rained on.
- It rained last night before dawn.
- But the newspaper is bone dry.
I'm not sure what...
The paper was delivered later, after it stopped raining.
This note was written in response to what I wrote in this newspaper.
He delivered the note before the paper.
So he knew the story in advance.
He'd already read it.
Where's my gun?!
Damn it.
The ink.
It's printing ink.
The "Patriot".
Henry, you're gonna tell me where she is.
- Henry!
Tell me, where is sh...?
Ivan.
Surprised?
Where is she?
Dying.
More quickly than I expected.
So I had to speed things along and deliver the morning edition so you could finally realise it had to be... none other than your humble typesetter and biggest fan.
A drink?
You don't know how I've looked forward to this moment, sir.
To sit here like this, no more masks, artist to artist.
Artist to artist.
Though I admit, as I read your final chapter,
I felt more muse than artist.
You're mad.
Really, Mr Poe?
You're one to talk.
Where is Emily?
Just like that?
No probing the devious twists and turns of man's darkest motives?
No prying into the mysteries of his conscience?
So very unlike you, Mr Poe.
Where is she?!
Ow!
A rather disappointing denouement,
I have to say.
But that's life, isn't it?
So much less satisfying than fiction.
It's time this story comes to an end.
Very well.
Give me the gun.
You've come this far, Mr Poe.
Are you really gonna back out now?
You know what happens next.
You wrote it, after all.
You either pull that trigger and kill me and young Miss Emily or you give me the gun.
She will live.
That was your solution, right?
I have to admit, I don't cry easily, but you had me bawling like a baby.
And I've always had a fancy for poisons.
That's how I done my dad.
The idea of drinking something that will kill you but having time to carry on a conversation is, as they say, fraught with dramatic possibilities, right?
Listen to me.
Talking about dramatic possibilities with one of the greatest writers of our time.
I must say, it has been a profound honour working with you, sir.
Working with me?
I know they're your ideas.
I'm just borrowing.
Except for Valdemar's tongue.
That was me.
- Quite a subtle metaphor, I thought.
- Subtle?
It made no sense at all.
Even in the end,
I'm confronted by a plagiarist without even the originality to invent themselves.
I've concocted you.
I couldn't agree more.
I am your crowning achievement.
Your masterpiece.
In whose world do we each exist right now, Edgar?
Mine, or yours?
I don't really know the answer.
It's quite brilliant.
Well... go on, sir.
Bottoms up.
I need a carriage now!
- Inspector!
- I need a carriage.
And send a messenger to Charles Hamilton's house.
Tell him to get to the "Baltimore Patriot". Do it!
So it has been written:
I will die today.
A hole of mouldering earth awaits.
It is a just end to a man consumed by death his entire life.
Emily, take this kiss upon thy brow.
Really good stuff, sir.
A poet to the end.
I suppose this bit is for Miss Hamilton.
Where is she?
- Where is she?
- I tell you, Mr Poe,
I used to live for your stories, just live for them.
When you stopped writing...
I guess I went a little nuts.
But I kept on believing, even when you closed me out.
I still believed in your vision, in a future where people would stand in lines to see the kind of things that only people like you and I could see.
I knew you had one more in you, sir.
No one will ever forget you.
Have you ever been to France?
There's a young writer over there -
Jules Verne.
- You heard of him?
- What?
Paris...
He really reminds me of you, sir.
Where is she? You owe me!
Where is she?!
"Anything was better than this agony."
"Anything was more tolerable than this derision."
"I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer."
"The Tell-Tale Heart."
She's here... She's here.
- Carriage for Mr Reynolds!
On my way in just a moment!
Goodbye, Mr Poe.
I've enjoyed our time together.
Reynolds...
Almost...
Emily!
Emily?
Answer me.
Emily! Please, answer me!
Oh, my God.
Emily...
Emily... Emily...
Emily.
Open your eyes.
Emily, open your eyes.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Is it really you?
- I love you.
- I love you.
I'm here.
I came for you.
Okay.
Stay awake.
I have you, always.
We're going home.
- You did mean it?
- Mean what?
When you said you would marry me.
In this life and the next.
Clear the way! Clear the way!
What's wrong with you? Make way!
- Where's Poe?
- He was here a moment ago.
Poe!
Hurry!
Where is Edgar? Where is Edgar?
Now, be careful.
Go, go, go!
Sir?
You are Edgar Poe, correct?
I am.
For a few more minutes, anyway.
Are you all right?
You look a little the worse for wear.
Is there someone I can call for you?
- Reynolds.
- You want me to find Reynolds?
Does he have a first name?
No.
Tell Fields... his last name is Reynolds.
I'm sorry, sir, you're not making much sense.
Tell Fields.
The Lord help my poor soul.
Mr Fields?
- I'm Dr John Morgan.
- Doctor.
- Do you have a cause of death?
- I'm sorry, I don't.
I have a few ideas but...
As you know, he was brought in in a very deranged state.
I'm told he was ranting.
Yes.
He kept going on and on about telling you that your last name is Reynolds.
Is that helpful, or just gibberish?
Maybe both.
Well, thank you for your help,
Doctor.
I'd be interested in hearing your final analysis.
Take this kiss upon thy brow,
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream.
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
Mr Reynolds, please follow me to your carriage.
Merci pour votre aide.
Hello, Ivan.
“BURN MY SHADOW"
BY UNKLE)
Many in the city
are still coming to grips
with the tragic news
that respected philanthropist
and humanitarian Henry Malloy
is dead.
A main force
behind what many called
the "Detroit bounceback,"
Malloy was found shot
in his car two nights ago,
just three blocks
from the downtown hotel
where earlier in the evening,
he'd received
a key to the city.
You think Fitch could've done it?
Picks a fight with him in front of a crowd...
- Three hours later, the guy ends up dead.
- Malloy was a fox in a henhouse.
- Somebody needed to put him down.
- Not with a bullet.
Well, the murder weapon was a .38, right?
Isn't that Fitch's backup?
- The one he wears on his ankle, right?
- Yep.
So you think he killed Malloy?
I have no idea what Fitch is capable of.
The sad thing is, I probably know him as well as anyone.
Looks like Mason's trying to find out.
I was walking, thinking.
I got home around midnight.
Sounds like a rock solid alibi.
- Are you suspending me?
- I'm not who you have to worry about.
The Feds are coming in.
The Feds? Why?
Malloy was one of the targets of a joint task force out of Chicago.
Now that he's been taken out of commission, the FBI is sending an agent to get to the bottom of this.
That's great. I love Feds.
Damn it.
Cheap slingbacks.
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Mason's office?
Right there.
(Sanchez) Who is that?
Fitch's replacement, I hope.
Lieutenant Mason?
- Uh, special agent
- Jess Harkins, FBI.
O-oh. Hi.
Uh, this is, uh, Detective Fitch.
The one and only.
We're gonna be loggin' some quality time together,
I believe.
Feels like we already started.
Right.
Uh, can you give us a moment, the lieutenant and me?
Just go and have a seat in an interrogation room, and I'll be right with ya.
Should I cuff myself to the table?
Oh, that's not necessary... yet.
I was disappointed to hear the Feds were taking over our investigation.
Malloy was an important figure, not your typical murder victim you guys get here.
We just wanted to make sure the case was handled as professionally as possible.
Oh, no offense.
Why would I be offended?
That you just said dead people in Detroit don't usually matter, or that we don't know how to conduct a thorough murder investigation?
Wow. It...lt does sound bad when you put it that way.
I didn't put it any way.
Anyhow, uh, we have field agents hitting the streets.
Um, but I've been dispatched to gather any information that might be relevant to our J.T.F., as well as looking into allegations that one of your detectives, uh, Mr. Charming, may be involved in Malloy's murder.
How did your J.T.F. Get onto Malloy in the first place? (Sets frame down)
Well, we've been backtracking a trail of criminal activity...
Smuggling, human trafficking, murder...
From Chicago through Detroit all the way into Canada.
A few months ago,
Malloy enterprises came onto our radar.
We were hoping to nail him in the next six months or so, but I guess your guy killed him first.
Allegedly.
Allegedly, yes.
So you have evidence?
I'm not authorized to share that information with... local.
I'm only saying, if you tell me what you have on Malloy...
You know, Maureen,
I-I could do that... (Rustling)
But then I'd have to kill ya.
I just quit smoking.
What a bitch.
Ahem.
You don't mind, do you?
You know, I've heard...
And read so much about you in the last 24 hours.
Is that so?
Some men stalk models, actresses, ex-girlfriends.
You stalk millionaire philanthropists.
I didn't stalk anybody.
Forgive me. Perhaps, uh, "stalk" is too strong a word.
What I meant to say was,
"Followed and harassed repeatedly
- in an intimidating and hostile manner."
- Thank you for the distinction.
And after months of this, frustrated with your inability to apprehend him, it seems you took it upon yourself to eliminate him.
- Is that what I did?
- What you didn't anticipate was that Malloy was already the target of a federal probe, which is gonna make the old "d-town cover-up" a little tougher to pull off this time.
Uh, first of all, locals don't really call it "d-town."
Secondly, I might have liked to kill Malloy, even hoped someone would, but I didn't do it.
Do you swear?
I swear.
Okay, then. You can go.
- Really?
- No, not really.
Get comfortable, cowboy.
The coffee's brewin'.
(The dead weather's
"hustle and cuss" playing)
(Siren whoops, police radio chatter)
Yeah, he just got out here.
♪ Knock on the door, the door knocks back ♪
♪ the joke never go no further than that ♪
Where'd they say the bodies where?
On the bus.
♪ Back down the stack, and we hustle and cuss ♪
♪ lick on the dust ♪
Looks like you're buying lunch.
I figured this for a straight-up mugging gone wrong.
Money changes everything.
♪ Muscle and fuss, lick on the dust ♪
Anger, rage, impotence.
So many motives, so little time, detective.
Is this how they teach you to interrogate at Quantico?
They also teach us waterboarding, but I didn't want to jump the gun.
You've done at least six things wrong since you walked in here.
- Have I now?
- Seven.
- Illuminate me. - You're talking when you should be listening.
You're telling me things when you should be asking questions.
What do you know about me that you didn't when you came in here?
Nothing.
Here's what I know about you.
You haven't worked in anti-crime very long.
Otherwise, you'd have learned by now heels like that don't make sense out in the field, especially not in a midwest winter, which leads me to believe you haven't been in Chicago long.
New division, new part of the country.
Special Agent Harkins moves around. No wedding ring.
Divorced? Nah.
I'm thinking never married, but lots of boyfriends, often the wrong kind in the wrong place at the wrong time, and sometimes married, of course.
The way you've worn down those cuticles and keep popping lozenges like Valium, you were smoking pack and a half, maybe two packs a day, until very recently.
Which worries me.
Overworked, lonely, single girl who smokes too much, can't stick around anywhere for long, an addictive personality like that opens you up to all kinds of trouble.
How am I doing?
Now unless you tell me that I'm suspended,
I've got a job to do, so I'm gonna do that.
And with that, I will leave you with two things...
I didn't kill Henry Malloy.
What was the other thing?
Welcome to the "d."
Male Hispanic suspect.
(Police radio chatter continues)
Hey, what'd the Fed lady ask you?
Normal stuff.
She wants to interview the whole unit, you know.
I'm gonna have to talk to her at some point.
- You'll be fine. Don't worry.
- What's she like anyway?
Ex-smoker. It's a filthy habit.
Three dead.
And thousands of dollars in large bills floating around out there.
Bullet casings on the floor.
And no bus driver.
Yeah. Public transportation ain't what it used to be.
Melinda Cortez.
Age 72.
Wrong bus, wrong time.
Michael Chivers, 28.
Check it out.
Got the old man's wallet in his coat pocket.
"Charles Murray Boyer,
Grosse Pointe."
Robbery gone bad?
Yeah, for all concerned.
Well, there's a 9-mil casing here.
Looks like Chivers got off one round before he got hit.
One round and three dead bodies.
Unless that's the magic bullet, our second shooter did most of the killing.
6 .45 casings.
First one was ejected here.
So Chivers holds up Mr. Boyer, takes his wallet.
Then our other guy stands up with his .45.
Two gunmen start shooting it out.
Chivers goes down, two victims go down, and Mr. .45 caliber exits the bus.
We found a bunch more of these with holes in 'em.
Denominations are all $50 and $100.
I'm thinking drug money, but we'll run the serials in case we're dealing with a bank robbery or something.
We got a blood trail that leads all the way back into that field over there.
Bullet holes in a briefcase.
I mean, talk about an exit wound.
Boom. Totally blew out the latch.
Couple hunnies still inside.
That explains the hole in the bills.
Look at this.
Could be initials... C.M.B.
Charles Murray Boyer.
I think it's safe to assume.
Mr. Boyer got on the bus with the briefcase.
So our second shooter must've got hit on the bus, grabs the briefcase, probably didn't know it was damaged...
Takes off into the field, briefcase falls open,
- dumping money into the wind.
- Bus driver could be second shooter.
Either that or he saw what happened and jetted.
Charles Boyer had a Caddy key on his chain.
Onstar located his vehicle
2 miles down the road.
Well, what is he doing on that bus with a briefcase full of cash?
How would you characterize
Detective Fitch?
Warm, fuzzy, always there with a smile and a "How do you do?"
I detect sarcasm.
Wow. You FBI guys are good.
You worked for narcotics before you came to homicide.
Is that right?
So?
One of your old sources, a drug dealer named Kilo, called you to say that Fitch's car was parked a block away from where Malloy was killed that night.
Are you tapping my phone?
No, but the DEA's tapping Kilo's.
We share. It's a Fed thing.
Wow. You FBI guys actually are good.
You failed to report this.
Look, the guy's... an ass.
- Kilo?
- No. Fitch.
I don't know if he killed Malloy.
Frankly, I don't care.
But I do know one thing.
There's two types of cops in this world.
There's Fitch and there's the rest of us.
You take him off the street, you just make my job a whole lot harder.
Ma'am, sir, Detroit P.D.
We're here about Charles Boyer.
I'm... I'm his daughter.
We found your father's vehicle a few miles away from where he was killed.
Do you know why he was on that bus?
Can you tell us what he was doing in the city this morning?
Sometimes he goes to see old friends.
Does he usually bring a briefcase full of cash?
And you live here with your father?
Since mom died.
So it's just the three of you...
And your daughter.
Lily's Shayna's daughter.
Her dad's not in the picture.
Clark's the only father she's known.
And where is Lily now?
Something you wanna tell us?
Honey...
Mnh-mnh.
Clark, please.
Please.
Lily was kidnapped.
Yesterday. She was a little late walking home from school.
It...lt's only three blocks from here.
Then the phone rang.
I answered it, and I heard her voice.
She just said, "Mommy," and then a man came on.
He said that he had Lily and he wanted half a million dollars.
- He said that if we went to the police...
- We wanted to call you guys.
- But dad wouldn't hear of it...
- Charlie is so stubborn.
- He's...
- An ex-marine.
He said he...
He wanted to handle it himself.
He withdrew the money. I begged him to let me deliver it, but if you knew him...
He was supposed to drive his car to the east side
- and wait for their call.
- They must've told him
- to get on the bus with the money...
- To make sure he wasn't being followed.
- Have you heard from the kidnappers?
- Not since yesterday.
Oh, my God. They didn't get the money.
We have people who know how to deal with this.
Please, my little girl!
We will do everything we can to get your daughter back safe.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I understand
Malloy was threatening to publish dirt on Fitch in his paper.
That story never came out.
Malloy's murder might have something to do with that.
He's not gonna shoot an unarmed man in cold blood.
- People reach a breaking point.
- Not him.
He's...
Not like other people.
Detective Sanchez, is there something between you and Fitch?
When you talk about him, your body language is...
Evasive in a particular way
I recognize.
So you wanna know if we're sleeping together?
- I wanna know if he confides in you.
- You wanna know if I'm lying to protect him, as if I can't separate my sex life from my obligation to the badge.
Are we being defensive?
I get you.
You like to imply stuff and then act like it's not what you meant.
Well, I'm sorry, Agent Betty.
Fitch and I do not have a thing.
And this interview is finished.
We're wired.
If they call again, we'll be ready for a trace.
Sir, there was an A.T.M.
Across the street from where the girl was abducted.
- We pulled footage.
- Great.
Do you know him?
No.
No. No. How could she just
walk off with that man?
She knows better!
Honey, she'll be okay.
I... (Sighs)
So you and your partner had a conversation with Fitch.
What conversation?
Last week, over lunch.
- Oh, you mean that private conversation?
- It was overheard.
Fitch suggested that someone should put a bullet in Malloy.
Look, people say all kinds of things.
So you're confirming what he said.
Is that right?
Detective Mahajan?
I'm sorry, it's just, every time you turn your head with that thing in your mouth...
Your shadow looks like F.D.R.
Look, you come in here and talk to our co-workers and try to get us to turn against each other.
This how a witch hunt works on the Federal level?
It goes to motive.
Add the fact that Fitch's whereabouts the night of Malloy's murder
- are still unaccounted for...
- Look, Fitch did not kill Malloy, okay?
- You're positive?
100%? You'd be willing to testify under oath?
Yes, under oath,
I would testify that I am...
Pretty damn close to sure that Fitch did not kill Malloy.
It's been almost 24 hours since she was taken.
- It doesn't look good.
- They didn't get their money.
As sick as it sounds, this is a business for them.
We'll be ready when they call looking for it.
Just talked to the M.E.
All three victims on that bus
- were shot with a .45.
- The guy didn't want any witnesses.
You're thinking he may have been involved in the kidnapping.
I'm thinking he's our best chance at finding that little girl.
Yeah, where do we start?
- Cliff Robbins.
- Bus driver?
- Maybe he can lead us to the shooter.
- Cops are out looking for him.
Stone and Sanchez already talked to his girlfriend, she's not helping any.
All right, have them meet us at her place. I got an idea.
Police already searched my house.
I told them
I haven't talked to Cliff since he left for work this morning.
Ms. Stilton, we're not here about Cliff. We're here for you.
Me?
Ma'am, your boyfriend witnessed a triple homicide this morning.
We have reason to believe the killers may use you to keep Cliff from identifying them.
We'd like to put you in protective custody.
For how long?
- Days, weeks..
- A month.
Until the killers are found.
Important thing is you'll be safe.
Now take your time, pack a suitcase.
We'll be in the car out front when you're ready.
Well, I give her two minutes.
(Stone) So how'd it go in there with agent bitchy?
Chick talk, mostly.
You?
Told her what I think about Fitch.
Yeah. Me, too.
I'm scared that he might be in real trouble.
Maybe he did do something stupid.
Look... (Sighs)
Fitch can take care of himself.
(Car engine starts in distance, revs)
Fitch, she's on the move.
There she is. Pull over.
Look at that.
Dealer plates.
That's right off the lot.
That's gotta be him.
(Tires screeching, siren wailing)
Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up!
(Fitch) Detroit police.
Step out of the car.
(Stone) Out of the car.
Put your hands behind your head.
Get on your knees.
Nice ride, Mr. Robbins.
New, pre-owned charger on a bus driver's salary, huh? (Handcuffs clicking)
I'm guessing he paid cash.
- Hey! I didn't kill these people!
- You're in a lot of trouble, Mr. Robbins.
I think it's time to get on the proverbial bus.
Tell us what happened.
I was on my route. This old white dude gets on my bus.
A few minutes later,
I hear shouting.
Some punk pulls out a gun, trying to rob the old dude.
- Is that the robber?
- That's the guy.
- Michael Chivers.
- The old man gives him his wallet, but this punk wants the briefcase.
The old man won't give it up.
They start tussling, and then this other dude stands up at the front of the bus with a gun.
That's the dude! That's the guy!
He started shooting everybody.
Then he got hit and took off, bleeding pretty bad.
The man who shot these people... you know him?
Well, he been riding the bus all week.
- He always get off at the same stop.
- He's casing the route.
- Where'd you drop him off?
- All right. Thanks.
Patrol units are out around the bus stop, running plates on parked vehicles.
They found one registered to a Leonard Jaspers.
He's got a record.
That's our kidnapper.
- Got an address.
- Let's go get the girl.
(Man) Clear!
(Man) Clear!
(Man) Clear!
They must be keeping her someplace else.
Cell phone. Maybe we can get somethin' off it.
Looks like he was counting his money.
Too bad you can't take it with you.
I don't need the Feds turning my command upside down.
We do more murders in a week than a Federal Agent handles in a year.
And the last time
I read the paper, the Department of Justice had bigger problems
- than a dead, dirty millionaire in Detroit. - ♪ Ta-da ♪
I've made my point.
Please extend my concerns to the chief. Thank you.
Sorry if I'm cramping your style.
What gave you that idea?
So your agents out in the field, they find anything on Malloy?
- Oh, they're pursuing a few leads.
- Suspects?
I'm not at liberty to discuss.
Ohh, or you'd have to kill me, right?
Sorry.
Fitch didn't do it.
- But what if he did?
- He didn't.
Not my question.
If he did, then he's on his own, and he'll get what he deserves.
Let me ask you this.
Would you call it a justifiable homicide?
Malloy was involved in all sorts of corruption and crime at the highest and lowest levels.
He was having people summarily executed.
I don't know how to define "justifiable."
But I can assure you this, the world's a damn better place for his being out of it.
I've gotta run a case review.
I'm getting heat from the press and the mayor's office on this bus triple. Download me.
We're running our dead perp,
Leonard Jaspers, to see who he might have been working with.
Sorry. Can I borrow
Detective Washington?
Now?
Looks like you got things pretty well under control here, right, lieutenant?
Ten minutes.
Come on.
I'll buy you a coffee.
The, uh, cell phone we found with Jaspers' body was a burner, prepaid account.
V.C.U. Broke it down.
We had it deciphered for all incoming and outgoing communications.
The messages themselves were auto-deleted.
This 7-1-6 number's pretty popular.
An hour or so prior to the bus murders,
Jasper started texting someone at that number.
Another prepaid phone?
Yeah, the texts continue regularly for the next four hours, getting closer together after noon.
All of which leads us to believe he may have been in contact with partners.
So once the situation goes sideways on the bus,
- he and his cohorts are trying to regroup.
- But meanwhile, Jaspers secretly hightails it back to his apartment with his little chunk of change, thinking he'd get away with it.
Not knowing that he's gonna die like that.
It's a theory. So?
We use this number to resume the texting that stopped when our perp died.
We pretend we're him, say we have the money,
- and we're ready to split it up.
- Lure out any other kidnappers.
I think it's our best shot.
Well, let's get to it then.
A little girl's life hangs in the balance.
Text the kidnappers.
Set up a meeting.
So you worked with him for what, six months?
Since right after my transfer to homicide.
How's that goin'?
Fitch is... a great partner and an excellent mentor.
It takes about two minutes with Detective Fitch to see he's not exactly mentor material.
You'd be surprised.
I would. You got shot your first day.
Was he mentoring you then?
- Fitch became fixated on Malloy, didn't he?
- I don't know if I'd say "fixated."
He started hounding the man, hunting him down, looking for reasons to go after him.
Reasons weren't hard to find.
The night Malloy was killed, you and Fitch
- had been in conflict, hadn't you?
- That's not such an unusual thing for us.
But this was about Malloy, about how out of control
Fitch was getting.
Did he say anything that might lead you to believe he could take things into his own hands?
I'm a Federal investigator.
Lying to me or withholding comes with serious ramifications.
- He said Malloy was never gonna stop.
- Unless what?
He didn't say. He just left.
The weapon used to murder malloy was a .38.
Does that mean anything to you?
No.
Fitch carries a .38 backup piece?
- Why are you holding out on me, detective?
- It doesn't mean anything.
A .357 can also fire a .38 bullet.
That's your best defense?
"Ballistics is in the eye of the beholder"?
We, uh, need him back,
Agent Harkins.
Oh, we're done for now.
Fitch is a messed-up dude, and he...
Pisses me off a lot of the time.
He doesn't trust people, which makes it hard to trust him, but I don't think he'd kill Malloy.
I don't think he'd do it, and if he did, even against my own instincts,
I'd write it off as something that had to be done.
Well, then you'd be in grave trouble as well, detective.
I'm not talking about legality.
I'm talking about necessity.
We're out here trying to save a city!
There's no written code for that.
(Fitch) They're late.
Their text said they'd be here by 3:00.
I talked to her, you know.
Told her you were innocent.
Do you think I am?
I'm not so sure.
All the more reason for me to be appreciative.
And tell me the truth.
You think that little girl's still alive?
(Sighs) Yeah. I do.
You're an optimist.
I like that.
(Sighs) Did I kill Malloy?
Doesn't part of you hope I did?
And won't you be a little let down either way?
(Mahajan) Incoming, gents.
Here we go.
Detroit P.D.!
Hands on the vehicle!
(Washington) Clark Wilkins, you're under arrest.
(Mason) He doesn't know where they've taken the girl.
He won't eat, won't speak.
Tried to hang himself in lockup.
Can you blame him?
Clark?
If you don't talk to us, we can't help Lily.
People make mistakes.
Good people.
They get pushed into the center of the storm.
They can't see a way out, so they do things.
Things they never dreamed they would ever do.
And... I know all about that, believe me.
She called me "daddy."
You're like her father.
A father wouldn't do this.
Clark, I know how much you love Lily.
I know you would never intentionally hurt her.
And right now you can help save her.
Okay?
Take me through it.
My business was hurting.
I needed $250,000, or I was gonna lose everything.
Times are tough.
I couldn't get a loan, and I couldn't go to Shayna's father because he would see me as a failure.
And there was a guy that I worked with.
- The man in the video.
- Leonard Jaspers.
He said that he could help me do this. He said he would
- bring some people in.
- Any idea who they were?
No, that was part of the deal.
I-I was...I was...
I-I was supposed to...
Get the money from Charlie and hand it over, and then... then... they were...
They were gonna give me half and return Lily.
But Charlie insisted on doing the trade, and it all went to hell.
I told him what to say to her...
So that Lily would walk away with him.
The kidnappers just texted Clark's phone.
They want $1 million, or they're gonna kill Lily.
- They're waiting for him to reach out.
- So what do we do?
Set up a delivery. They don't know what Clark looks like.
One of our people stands in for him.
We move when the money's traded.
They're gonna be looking out for us.
We get spotted, what happens to the little girl then?
We have surveillance options.
Best thing about being a Fed is all the toys.
We could track you, have our people in proximity.
They'd never know.
Send the text.
Let 'em think
Clark has the money.
That doesn't sound like a text.
It's not, but that's the kidnapper's number.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
The only one of them
Clark talked to is dead.
These guys don't know his voice.
Should I let it go to message?
I need quiet! Quiet!
Kill the phones!
Hello?
(Man) Clark Wilkins?
Yes.
Th-this is Clark Wilkins.
You got the money?
Yes, I have the money.
But please...
I wanna hear her voice.
Hold on. It's your daddy.
(Lily) Daddy? Daddy?
You good?
Thank you. Yes.
You got the whole million?
Yes. $1 million.
And where do I bring it?
Do me a favor.
Name it.
- Something happens out there...
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Can I finish, please?
- Well... sorry.
Thank you.
I would be very appreciative...
If you would tell my kid that I wanted to fix it...Up.
You know, that I was trying.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
I made a huge mistake.
I was going after this mobster, Albert Stram.
Albert Stram?
You went after "Big Al" Stram?
I was getting close.
One night, he calls me out of the blue, offers me a deal.
Leave New York, or he'd kill my kid.
Linda and I were separated, so they don't know anything about this, so...
I thought
I made the right choice.
S-so, um...
Maybe you could tell him.
Hey, nothing's gonna happen out there.
Something's gonna happen.
I'm gonna save that little girl.
Hello?
Yes. I understand.
Yeah.
Stop...
And leave the case,
Mr. Wilkins.
Where's Lily?
Just leave it there.
I'm not going anywhere without my child.
When you go outside, you'll get a call, telling you where to find her.
No. No more phone calls.
I could kill you, and nobody would know.
I brought the money.
All I want is my kid.
You're stupid, you know that?
This whole thing was your idea.
Sorry.
(Man) Freeze!
(Man) I got it! I got it!
(Man) Come on!
We got it, we got it!
(Man) Don't move.
Told you I wouldn't lose you.
My name is
Detective Louis Fitch.
Where's Lily?!
(Man) Freeze!
Uhh!

Wonder what they're doing in there.
Verdict's coming down.
It's gonna be fine.
You ever think about what you would do if you weren't a cop?
Yeah, I think about it sometimes.
Fitch.
As I've already said to Lieutenant Mason,
I wanna thank you for surrendering your backup piece for a ballistics check.
What'd you find? I was with
Oswald on the grassy knoll?
Your weapon's been cleared.
It doesn't match the gun used to kill Malloy.
Lucky for me.
That's his way of saying "thank you."
So where's your investigation at?
Agents picked up a suspect at the border.
He's a known contract killer with a decades-long record of violent felonies believed to have been working for a crime boss in New York, who's on the radar of Federal authorities in the Southern district.
- What crime boss is that?
- Albert "Big Al" Stram.
Huh.
So you're heading back to Chicago?
No further need to disrupt things.
Hey, for a, uh...
For a grand inquisitor, you're not so bad.
It was a pleasure working with Detroit homicide.
Let's do it again sometime.
If I ever get out to Chi-town... they hate that, you know,
Chi-town. Nobody calls it that.
Congratulations.
It's a bitter pill.
I kinda... found myself wishing I was guilty.
(Bottle cap clinking, indistinct conversations)
Hey, you got a dollar?
Get in out of the cold, okay?
(Chuckles) Always count on you, Fitch.
Take care of yourself.
Thanks, man. You, too.
All right.
Fitch here.
(Man) Lou.
Been a while.
Big Al.
Looks like I helped you make the streets of Detroit a little safer.
Is that what you did?
Funny how a guy like Malloy can put you and me on the same side.
I don't think we'll ever be on the same side.
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.
I hear Detroit is the land of opportunity.
I could use a friend there.
You can always buy one.
You're good at that.
I'll be seeing you, Lou.
