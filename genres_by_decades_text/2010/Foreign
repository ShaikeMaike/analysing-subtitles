I was on the fast track once.
Employee of the month, every month. Forever.
And then they assigned me you.
I can't close the deal on a couple of pathetic flannel wearing maggots.
Everybody's laughing at me.
We're John Winchesters sons.
I've got brothers?
Adam doesn't have to be cursed.
He's a Winchester.
He's already cursed.
You're not Adam.
You've never been Adam.
You're a ghoul.
You can't kill the devil and you're losing faith in yourself, your brother.
God was your last hope.
Are you gonna do something stupid?
Like what?
Like Michael stupid.
Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't do it.
I have to.
Let me guess.
Pink-slipped?
That obvious, huh?
Takes one to know one.
"Outsourcing."
What was your crime against humanity?
Deal of the millennium.
Couldn't even get the one simple "yes" I needed.
Got to nail that bottom line, right?
Hear that.
All they care about upstairs, ain't it?
Results, results, results.
They don't know.
They're not down on the ground, in the mud,
Nose to nose with all you pig-filthy humans.
Am I right?
Absolutely... filthy what?
I mean, whatever happened to personal loyalty?
How long have I worked for these guys?
Five millennia? Six?
Seems like it, don't it?
Damn straight, it does.
Two more.
Zach.
Stuart.
What are you gonna do next, Stuart?
Hell, I don't know.
Maybe something to do with the Internet.
Yeah?
Whoa.
Earthquake?
No.
My boss.
Ah!
Aah!
Aaah!
Go ahead... get it over with.
I'm ready.
Wait
What?
Yes! Anything, of course.
Just... just put me back in.
You won't regret it.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Ah.
Back in business, boys!
"Oh when the saints go marching in"
"Oh when the saints..."
  Season 5 Episode 18
  "Point of No Return"
Sending someone a candy-gram?
How'd you find me?
You're gonna kill yourself, right?
It's not too hard to figure out the stops on the farewell tour.
How's Lisa doing, anyways?
I'm not gonna kill myself.
No?
So, Michael's not about to make you his Muppet?
What the hell, man?
This is how it ends?
You just... walk out?
Yeah, I guess.
How could you do that?
How could I?
All you've ever done is run away!
And I was wrong every single time I did.
Just... please... not now.
Bobby is working on something.
Oh, really... what?
You got nothing, and you know it.
You know I have to stop you.
Yeah, well, you can try.
But just remember, you're not all hopped up on demon blood this time.
Yeah, I know... but I brought help.
Yeah, no, this is good, really.
Eight months of turned pages and screwed pooches, but tonight... tonight's when the magic happens.
You ain't helping.
Yeah, well, why don't you let me get out of your hair, then?
What the hell happened to you?
Reality happened.
Nuclear's the only option we have left.
Michael can ice the devil, save a boatload of people.
But not all of them.
We got to think of something else.
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.
But if Lucifer burns this mother down and I could have done something about it, guess what... that's on me.
You can't give up, son.
You're not my father.
And you ain't in my shoes.
What is that?
That's the round I mean to put through my skull.
Every morning,
I look at it, and I think...
"maybe today's the day
I flip the lights out."
But I don't do it.
I never do it.
You know why?
Because I promised you
I wouldn't give up!
Cass, you okay?
No.
What's wrong?
Somethings happening.
Where?
I'm gonna get a beer.
Do you mind?
Help.
Boys!
Who is it?
That's our brother.
Wait a minute.
Your brother... Adam?
Cass, what the hell?
Angels.
Angels... why?
I know one thing for sure.
We need to hide him now.
- Where am I?
- It's okay.
Just relax.
You're safe.
Who the hell are you?
You're gonna find this a little... a lot crazy, but we're actually your brothers.
It's the truth.
John Winchesters our father, too.
See, I'm Sam.
Yeah, and I'm sure that's Dean.
I know who you are.
- How?
- They warned me about you.
- Who did?
- The angels.
Now, where the hell is Zachariah?!
So, why don't you just tell us everything?
Start from the beginning.
Well, I was dead and in heaven... except it... it, uh, kind of looked like my prom.
And I was making out with this girl.
Her... her name was Kristin McGee.
Yeah, that sounds like heaven.
Did you get to third base?
Just, uh... just keep going.
Well, these... these angels, they popped out of nowhere, and they tell me that I-I'm chosen.
For what?
To save the world.
How you gonna do that?
Oh, me and some archangel are gonna kill the devil.
What archangel?
Michael.
I'm his, uh, sword or vessel or something.
I don't know
Well, that's insane.
Not necessarily.
How do you mean?
Maybe they're moving on from you, Dean.
Well, that doesn't make sense.
He's John Winchesters bloodline,
Sam's brother.
It's not perfect, but it's possible.
You got to be kidding me.
Why would they do this?
Maybe they're desperate.
Maybe they've wrongly assumed
Dean would be brave enough to withstand them.
All right, you know what?
Blow me, Cass.
Look. No way.
After everything that's happened.
All that crap about destiny, suddenly the angels have a plan "B"?
Does that smell right to anybody?
You know, this has been a really moving family reunion, but, uh,
I got a thing, so...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Sit down.
Just listen, okay?
Please.
It's unbelievable.
Now, Adam...
The angels are lying to you.
They're full of crap.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Really? why not?
Um, 'cause they're angels.
They tell you they were gonna roast half the planet?
They said the fight might get pretty hairy, but it is the devil, right?
So, we got to stop him.
Yeah, but there's another way.
Great. What is it?
Well, we're working on the power of love.
- How's that going?
- Not good.
Look, Adam... you don't know me from a hole in the wall, I know... but I'm begging you.
Please, just trust me.
Give me some time.
Give me one good reason.
Because we're blood.
You got no right to say that to me.
You're still John's boy.
No, John Winchester was some guy who took me to a baseball game once a year.
I don't have a dad.
So, we may be blood, but we are not family.
My mom is my family... and if I do my job,
I get to see her again.
So, no offense, but she's the one I give a rat's ass about, not you.
Fair enough.
But if you have one good memory of dad... just one... then you'll give us a little more time.
Please.
Going somewhere?
Out for a... beer.
Great, we got beer.
Have a seat.
Great.
You know, you pitch this whole dewy-eyed romance thing... but the truth is,
I'm on lock-down, aren't I?
Adam... you may not believe it, but dad was trying to protect you... keeping you from all this.
Yeah, well, I guess the monster that ate me didn't get that memo.
You remember that?
Oh, yeah.
Still, trust me.
The one thing worse than seeing dad once a year... was seeing him all year.
Do you know how full of crap you are?
- What?
- Really.
You see, it was me and it was my mom, that's it.
She worked the graveyard shift at the hospital.
I cooked my own dinners,
I put myself to bed.
So, you can say whatever you want about our dad, but the truth is,
I would have taken anything.
All right?
Look, if we had known we had a brother...
Well, you didn't, so...
We would have found you.
Look, I can't change the past.
I wish I could.
But from here on out...
What... we gonna hop in the family truckster?
Pop on down to Wally world?
Tell you one thing... attitude like that, you'd fit right in around here.
Well, Cass, not for nothing... but the last person who looked at me like that...
I got laid.
Uh, why don't you, uh, go keep an eye on Adam?
Is this really necessary?
Well I mean, we got our hands full, Dean... a houseful of flight risks.
I'm not letting him do it.
- Who, Adam?
- No, I'm... I'm not, either.
No, you're not getting me.
Oh, no, no,
I "get" you perfectly.
But I'm not letting you do it either.
That kid's not taking a bullet for me.
- Dean...
- I'm serious.
I mean, think about how many people we've gotten killed, Sam.
Mom, dad...
Jess, Jo, Ellen... should I keep going?
It's not like we pulled the trigger.
We might as well have.
I'm tired, man.
I'm tired of fighting who I'm supposed to be.
Well, do you think maybe you could take a half a second and stop trying to sacrifice yourself for a change?
Maybe we could actually stick together?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Dean, seriously.
Tell me... I-I want to know.
I just...
I-I don't believe.
In what?
In you.
I mean, I don't...
I don't know whether it's gonna be demon blood or some other demon chick or what, but...
I do know they're gonna find a way to turn you.
So, you're saying
I'm not strong enough.
You're angry... you're self-righteous.
Lucifer's gonna wear you to the prom, man.
It's just a matter of time.
Don't say that to me... not you... of all people.
I don't want to... but it's the truth.
And when Satan takes you over, there's got to be somebody there to fight him, and it ain't gonna be that kid.
So, it's got to be me.
How's he doing?
How you doing?
Dean?
Dean?
Cass.
Where's Cass?
Blown to Oz.
Look, I'll get Dean.
He couldn't have gone too far.
- Just watch Adam.
- How?
You may have noticed, he's got a slight height advantage.
Then cuff him to your chair.
I don't know.
Just watch him.
Your mom's not coming, you know.
This is the park where your mom took you on her day off, right?
She's not coming... not yet.
But she will... soon.
You're Zachariah, right?
I am.
You weren't where you were supposed to be, kid.
Yeah, I know.
Can't quite zero in on you, either.
So, let me take a wild guess... you're with Sam and Dean?
Yeah.
Didn't we tell you about them?
So, you know you can't trust them, right?
You know Sam and Dean Winchester are psychotically, irrationally, erotically codependent on each other, right?
I don't know.
They said a few things about you.
Really?
Trust me, kid.
When the heat gets hot, they're not gonna give a flying crap about you.
Hell, they'd rather save each other's sweet bacon than save the planet.
They're not your family.
Understand?
Now... you want to see your mom again or not?
The end is nigh!
The apocalypse is upon us!
The angels talk to me, and they asked me to talk to you!
- The apocalypse...
- Hey!
I'm Dean Winchester.
Do you know who I am?
Dear God
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen, I need you to pray to your angel buddies and let them know that I'm here.
Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
You pray too loud.
What, are you crazy?!
I rebelled for this?!
So that you could surrender to them?
Cass! Please!
I gave everything for you.
And this is what you give to me.
Do it.
Just do it!
Bobby, what do you mean,
"Adam is gone"?
Should I say it in Spanish?
He's gone how?
What the hell, Bobby?!
Watch your tone, boy
He was right in front of me, and he disappeared into thin air.
Because the angels took him.
What the hell happened to him?
Me.
What do you mean, the angels took Adam?
You branded his ribs, didn't you?
Yes. Adam must have tipped them.
- How?
- I don't know.
Maybe in a dream.
Well, where would they have taken him?
I see you and your brother share the same refined palate.
Ah.
So, uh... we ready?
For what?
What do you mean, for what? For Michael.
Oh.
Right... about that.
Look, this is never easy, but I'm afraid... we've had to terminate your position at this time.
Excuse me?
Hey, don't get me wrong, you've been a hell of a sport, really... good stuff.
But the thing is, you're not so much the "chosen one" as you are... a clammy scrap of bait.
No, but what about the stuff that you said?
I'm supposed to fight the devil.
Mm, not so much.
Hey, if it's any consolation, you happen to be the illegitimate half brother of the guy we do care about.
That's not bad, is it?
So, you lied... about everything.
We didn't lie.
We just avoided certain truths to manipulate you.
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Hey, how do you think I feel?
I'm the one that's got to put up with that dumb, slack-jawed look on your face.
Kid, we didn't have a choice.
The Winchesters got one blind spot, and it's family.
See, Sam and Dean, they're gonna put aside their differences... and they're gonna come get you- and that is gonna put Dean right... here.
Right where I need him.
This is the night, kid!
Our night.
Michael's seen it.
The tumblers finally click into place and it's all because of you.
And me. But who's keeping score?
Yeah, I'm not gonna let you do this.
Cool your jets, Corky.
Sit down.
We're doing it together.
Plus, you still get your severance.
You still get to see your mom, okay?
Why should I believe you?
You know what?
I keep hearing this.
But what I want to be hearing is this...
Yeah.
That's better.
How you feeling?
Word to the wise... don't piss off the nerd angels.
So, how's it going?
Adam's gone.
The angels have him.
Where?
The room where they took you.
You sure?
Cass did a recon.
And?
And the place is crawling with mooks... pretty much a no-shot-in-hell, hail-Mary kind of thing.
Ah, so the usual.
What are you gonna do?
For starters...
I'm bringing you with.
Excuse me?
There are too many of them.
We can't do it alone, and, uh, you're pretty much the only game in town.
Isn't that a bad idea?
Cass and Bobby think so.
I'm not so sure.
Well, they're right.
Because either it's a trap to get me there, to make me say yes... or it's not a trap and I'm gonna say yes anyway.
And I will.
I'll do it... fair warning.
No, you won't.
When push shoves, you'll make the right call.
You know, if tables were turned...
I'd let you rot in here.
Hell, I have let you rot in here.
Yeah, well...
I guess I'm not that smart.
I-I don't get it... Sam, why are you doing this?
Because... you're still my big brother.
Where the hell are we?
Van Nuys, California.
Where's the beautiful room?
In there.
The beautiful room is in an abandoned muffler factory in van Nuys, California?
Where'd you think it was?
I-I don't know... Jupiter?
A blade of grass... not van Nuys.
Tell me again why you don't just grab Adam and shazam the hell out of there?
Because there are at least five angels in there.
- So? You're fast.
- They're faster.
I'll clear them out.
You two grab the boy.
This is our only chance.
Whoa, whoa, wait. You're gonna take on five angels?
Yes.
Isn't that suicide?
Maybe it is.
But then I won't have to watch you fail.
I'm sorry, Dean.
I don't have the same faith in you that Sam does.
What the hell are you gonna do with that?
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Adam, hey. Hey.
You came for me.
You're family.
Dean, it's a trap.
I figured.
Dean, please. Did you really think it would be that easy?
Did you?
Sam!
You know what I've learned from this experience, Dean?
Patience.
Adam?
Let him go, you son of a bitch.
I mean, I thought
I was downsized for sure, and for us, a firing... pretty damn literal.
But I should have trusted the boss man.
It's all playing out like he said...
You, me... your hemorrhaging brothers.
You're finally ready, right?
You see things our way.
You know there's no other choice.
There's never been a choice.
Stop it.
Stop it right now!
In exchange for what?
Damn it, Zachariah.
Stop it, please.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry, what was that?
Okay, yes.
The answer is yes.
Dean!
Do you hear me?
Call Michael down, you bastard!
How do I know you're not lying?
Do I look like I'm lying?
He's coming.
Of course, I have a few conditions.
What?
A few people whose safety you have to guarantee before I say yes.
Sure, fine.
Make a list.
But most of all...
Michael can't have me until he disintegrates you.
What did you say?
I said... before Michael gets one piece of this sweet ass... he has to turn you into a piece of charcoal.
You really think Michael's gonna go for that?
Who's more important to him now?
You... or me?
You listen to me.
You are nothing but a maggot inside a worm's ass.
Do you know who I am... after I deliver you to Michael?
Expendable.
Michael's not gonna kill me.
Maybe not.
But I am.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.
Okay, come on.
Come on, move it!
No!
Dean, help!
Come on, help me.
Ah.
Dean, help!
Dean!
Hold on. We'll get you out.
Just hold on.
Adam, can you hear me?
Adam?
You think Adam's okay?
Doubt it.
Cass either.
But we'll get 'em.
So?
"So"... what?
I saw your eyes.
You were totally rockin' the "yes" back there.
So... what changed your mind?
Honestly?
The damnedest thing.
I mean, the world's ending... the walls are coming down on us... and I look over to you and all I can think about is,
"this stupid son of a bitch brought me here."
I just didn't want to let you down.
You didn't.
You almost did... but you didn't.
I owe you an apology.
No, man.
No, you don't.
Just... let me say this.
I don't know if it's being a big brother or what. But... you know, to me, you've always been this snot-nosed kid that I've had to keep on the straight and narrow.
I think we both know that that's not you anymore.
I mean, hell... if you're grown-up enough to find faith in me... the least I can do is return the favor.
So, screw destiny right in the face.
I say we take the fight to them. Do it our way.
Sounds good.

On "The vampire diaries"...
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
- is coming after me?
- Elijah.
- He´s one of the Originals...
- a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw
Klaus out together and I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
- And then what?
- Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts... this is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then
I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
- then he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you
not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter...
You know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
- Hey!
- School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes.
- Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here?
I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes?
Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
- How's that possible?
- He's an Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
- You all do.
- Like hell.
We all want the same thing... Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
- with their heads cut off.
- I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
You know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
- What did he say?
- Not much, really.
I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I...
I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy.
I don't get it!
Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want...
Klaus's death.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, ok?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows
I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way
I had to get that information, but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
- What you up to?
- None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
- Then you can't help.
- Ugh.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried,
Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- You're going to kill them?
- No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
Hey.
What's going on?
Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- If you feel weak...
- Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"and took her to the same location
"her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka... kill her.
- What?
- She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my God! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent, so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be?
♪ Close your eyes, give me your hand ♪
♪ darlin' ♪
♪ do you feel my heart beating? ♪
She's good.
♪ Do you understand? ♪
♪ do you feel the same? ♪
♪ am I only dreaming? ♪
♪ is this burning ♪
♪ an eternal flame? ♪
♪ I believe ♪
♪ it's meant to be ♪
♪ darlin' ♪
♪ I watch you when you are sleeping ♪
♪ you belong with me ♪
♪ do you feel the same? ♪

♪ oh, life, so lonely ♪
♪ you come and ease the pain ♪
♪ I don't want to lose this feeling ♪
♪ oh ♪
♪ no ♪
Matt, I...
- You killed him!
- Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who... ahh...
- is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and
Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I... I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
- I'm happy.
- Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold... yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
I don't need your help.
I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
Mmm!
- The power's out.
- Even better.
I wish, but I should probably... whoa.
Hey!
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my God!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.
- I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin!
I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath Caroline... just breath.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this, but I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's...
Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead, but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look,
Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood.
I... I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I...
What... what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear,
I swear, nothing, nothing!
- What did you do?!
- Nothing, Matt!!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
Isobel.

NOSTALGIA FOR THE LIGHT
The old German telescope,
...that I've seen once again after so many years,
...is still working
...in Santiago, Chile.
I owe my passion for astronomy to it.
These objects, which could have come...
...from my childhood home,
...remind me of that far-off moment...
...when one thinks one has left childhood behind.
At that time, Chile was a haven of peace...
...isolated from the world.
Santiago slept...
...in the foothills of the Cordillera, detached from the rest of the world.
I loved science-fiction stories,
...lunar eclipses
...and watching the sun through a piece of smoky glass.
I learnt by heart the name of certain stars
...and had a map of the sky.
It was a simple provincial life.
Nothing ever happened.
The Presidents of the Republic...
...walked unescorted through the streets.
Only the present moment existed.
One day this peaceful life came to an end.
A revolutionary tide swept us to the centre of the world.
I was lucky to be a part of this noble venture...
...which woke us all from our slumber.
This time of hope is forever engraved in my soul.
At around the same time,
...science fell in love with the Chilean sky.
A group of astronomers...
...found they could touch the stars...
...in the Atacama Desert.
Enveloped in star dust,
...scientists from all over the planet
...created the biggest telescopes in the world.
Some time later,
...a coup d'etat swept away democracy, dreams...
...and science.
Despite living in a devastation zone,
Chilean astronomers...
...carried on working, supported by their foreign colleagues.
One by one, the secrets of the sky...
...began to fall upon us like translucent rain.
In Chile, astronomy is a passion shared by many.
I'm just one enthusiast amongst thousands.
Our humid planet has only one small brown patch...
...that has absolutely no humidity.
The vast Atacama Desert.
I imagine that man will soon walk on Mars.
This ground beneath my feet...
...bears the strongest resemblance to that faraway world.
There is nothing.
No insects, no animals, no birds.
And yet, it is full of history.
For 10,000 years,
...this region has been a transit route.
Rivers of stone...
...provided natural paths.
The caravans of llamas and men...
...came and went between the high plains and the sea.
It's a condemned land, permeated with salt,
...where human remains are mummified and objects are frozen in time.
The air,
...transparent, thin,
...allows us to read...
...this vast open book of memory
...page after page.
The telescopes...
...are the window to the cosmos.
This is where the celestial mystery begins.
In the glow of the night, the stars observe us.
At the bottom of the lakes of sand...
...are petrified fish and molluscs.
I can pick them up with my hands.
The hills and the Indian fortresses merge into one.
Apparently there are meteorites under the rocks...
...that can affect a compass.
I have always believed...
...that our origins could be found in the ground,
...buried beneath the soil or at the bottom of the sea.
But now, I think that our roots are up above,
...beyond the light.
Where do we come from,
...where are we and where are we going?
Where do we come from?
It's a key question.
It has always been at the core of our civilisations.
As for religion,
...the world of science today...
...tends to separate science from religion.
And yet the fundamental questions pondered by man are of a religious origin and motive.
That's my opinion.
It's a matter of discovering the origins of mankind,
...of our planet, the solar system.
Finding out how a galaxy, a planet or a star is born.
All these questions about our origins,
...we astronomers try to answer.
It's a never-ending story.
What eats away at the astronomer is "the origin of".
I study diffuse galaxies whose origins are a mystery.
We don't know why they do not self-destruct.
We try to shed light on these difficult questions.
That is science.
We try to answer two questions,
...we do so as best we can, and four more arise.
That is the nature of science.
Some say that we're not very efficient,
...that in answering two questions, we trigger four others.
But that's science; it's never resolved.
That's what I like about it.
The mystery of science is eternal.
Below these domes...
...are other messages which also come from afar.
These rock carvings, made by pre-Columbian shepherds, are over 1,000 years old.
Here, more than anywhere else,
I feel that the desert...
...is revealing a secret.
All of our life experiences,
...including this conversation, happened in the past.
Even if it is a matter of millionths of a second.
The camera I am looking at now is a few metres away...
...and is therefore already several millionths of a second in the past...
...in relation to the time on my watch.
The signal takes time to arrive.
The light reflected from the camera or from you,
...reaches me after a moment.
A fleeting moment, as the speed of light is very fast.
How long does it take for moonlight to reach us?
Just over a second.
- And sunlight?
- Eight minutes.
So we don't see things at the very instant we look at them?
No, that's the trap.
The present doesn't exist.
It's true.
The only present that might exist...
...is the one in my mind.
It's the closest we come to the absolute present.
And not even then!
When I think,
...it takes a moment for the signal to travel between my senses.
Between when I say "this is me" and when I touch myself,
...there is a lapse in time.
The past is the astronomers' main tool.
We manipulate the past.
We are used to living behind the times.
That's how it is.
Like an archaeologist who also studies the past.
Exactly.
A not-so-distant past, but it's the same.
- He tries to imagine...
- Exactly.
A historian does the same thing.
Geologists, too.
They know that the deeper they dig, the older the things they'll find.
It's the same for us.
The present is a fine line.
A puff of air would destroy it.
On this flat rock face...
...are the outlines of two human faces, perhaps masks.
They were carved by the pre-Columbian shepherds...
...who passed through here.
It was a natural route to San Pedro de Atacama.
These drawings resemble those carved on the mountain opposite.
We are on the prehistoric road that runs alongside the rock drawings.
The modern road was laid on top of the old one.
There on the right,
...we can see drawings of llamas and people.
The astronomers...
...created an enormous telescope...
...to bring two seemingly incompatible things closer:
...the origins of everything...
...and the past of everything we are today.
Two different situations...
Today they receive the past.
But, at the same time, they receive the most distant past of all...
...which is the origin of the whole system.
They study one past and we study another.
They are in the present recording a past...
...which they have to reconstruct.
They have only minute clues.
They are archaeologists like us.
Why are some places more suitable for this study of the past?
It's a real mystery.
The question is: why are there archaeologists and astronomers...
...in the same place?
The answer is simple.
Here, the past is more accessible than elsewhere.
The translucency of the sky... is, for the archaeologists of space,
...what the dry climate is for us.
It facilitates our access to evidence from the past.
The translucency enables the astronomers...
...to shed light on the mysteries of space.
This is why we share the same territory.
We are at a gateway to the past.
That's right. It's a gateway we know how to go through.
But when we come out again,
...will we have made discoveries that will shake our lives forever?
This remains a mystery to me.
And yet, this country has not yet considered its past.
It is held in the grasp of the coup d'etat...
...which seems to immobilise it.
This is the paradox which concerns you most.
This is where the problem lies.
It's worthy of your concern.
I totally agree with you.
It's true that it's paradoxical.
We've hidden away...
...our nearest past.
It's a huge paradox.
Listen, we know hardly anything about the 19th century.
How many secrets are we keeping...
...about the 19th century?
We have never acknowledged that we marginalised our Indians.
It's practically a state secret.
We've done nothing to try to understand...
...why, in the 19th century,
...staggering economic phenomena such as saltpetre appeared,
...yet today there's nothing left.
We've kept our recent past hidden.
We've concealed it.
It's absurd.
We avoid looking at this recent history.
It's as if this history might accuse us.
And that, dear friend, helps no one.
Not the right, not the centre, not the left.
Like other of the planet's deserts,
...the Chilean desert is an ocean of buried minerals.
In the open air...
...lie men who died working.
Like geological layers,
...layers of miners and of Indians...
...are swept by a relentless wind.
They were nomadic families.
Their belongings, their memories are nearby.
Near the observatories, in the middle of this vast emptiness...
...are the ruins of Chacabuco,
...the biggest concentration camp of Pinochet's dictatorship.
The ruins of this camp...
...are in fact the ruins of a mine.
The military didn't have to build a camp, as, by way of cells,
...they used the houses of the 19th-century miners,
...a time when the mining industry was like slavery.
All the military had to do...
...was to add barbed wire.
I was imprisoned in a concentration camp in the North
...from November 9th, 1973,
...until October 1974.
In Chacabuco, did you hear of a group...
...who observed the stars?
Yes, I was part of this group.
There were about 20 of us.
Was the person who led the group an astronomer?
He was a doctor who knew a lot about astronomy: Dr Alvarez.
During the day, he gave us theory lessons...
...and, at night, we went outside to watch the stars.
What we learnt of astronomy...
...was to recognise the constellations.
- Did you have a telescope? - No.
The sky was so transparent...
...that the stars...
...were like small light bulbs.
How did you find the constellations?
He showed us how to make a device.
A tripod with a dial on top...
...that showed the hours.
A kind of balance contraption was fixed on that...
...with a needle and two crossed wires.
That served as a viewfinder.
What did you feel watching the stars whilst in prison?
We all had a feeling...
...of great freedom.
Observing the sky and the stars,
...marvelling at the constellations,
...we felt completely free.
"In this house lived the following political prisoners:
Victor Astudillo,
Luis Henriquez,
René Olivares,
Enrique..."
You can only see the "E".
"Enrique Pastorelli."
I remember him well.
And here: "Federico
Quilodrán Chávez."
The military banned the astronomy lessons.
They were convinced that the prisoners could escape...
...guided by the constellations.
Luis's dignity lies in his memory.
He wasn't able to escape,
...but, by communicating with the stars,
...he managed to preserve his inner freedom.
He remembers traces that have been erased,
...electric cables, watchtowers.
Luis is a transmitter of history.
Miguel, the architect of memory,
...is also a lover of stars.
He was in five detention centres...
...where he contemplated the sky and used his memory...
...to carve each prison into his mind.
When the military saw...
...the published drawings of the camps which they had dismantled,
...they were dumbstruck.
Like that.
That's how you measured?
That's right.
When I decided to leave a testimony...
...of what a concentration camp in Chile was like,
...I began to measure in this way the different spaces,
...so as to be able to draw them one day if I ever got out.
Each day as I walked to work,
I discreetly measured the assembly courtyard.
It measured 30 metres, ten by three or five by six.
There.
30 metres.
Here something important is missing.
At the far end was a solitary confinement block.
It measured six by nine.
Here, there was another row of barbed wire.
It was everywhere.
At night, by candle light,
...I made my drawings.
When I'd finished,
...I tore them into tiny shreds...
...that I hid in case of a night raid.
The next day,
I was one of the first up
...and I went to the latrines to get rid of them.
I memorised it all easily...
...and, when I was in exile in Denmark,
...I drew these places again as if I'd known them all my life.
That is memory.
An architect, at least, is capable...
...of memorising all the dimensions.
Miguel and his wife...
...are for me a metaphor of Chile.
He is remembering...
...whilst Anita is forgetting...
...as she has Alzheimer's disease.
At an altitude of 5,000 metres, the radio telescope ALMA...
...is being made by several countries.
It will have 60 antennas,
...or 60 ears to listen to the waves of the sky.
It will be able to listen to bodies...
...whose light doesn't reach the earth.
It will register the energy produced during the Big Bang.
Victor, a 29-year-old engineer,
...will be one of the rare witnesses to this event...
...which to me seems so unreal.
How did you get into astronomy?
My mother encouraged me to apply to ESO, the observatory.
- You were born in Germany?
- Yes, Germany.
- So you are a child of exile.
- I'm a child from nowhere.
I'm not from Chile, nor am I from the country where I was born.
- Do you feel comfortable here?
- Yes, I feel Chilean.
I am Chilean.
The energy this antenna will detect...
...was emitted billions of years ago.
It is from the past and only reaches us today...
...but it belongs to history, to the past.
Your mother was expelled from
Chile during the dictatorship.
Nowadays, she cares for ex-prisoners who were tortured.
Are you aware that you and your mother work in the past?
The past is at the core of our work.
Both of us...
...try to learn from the past, from history,
...to build a better future.
According to one official commission,
...30,000 people were tortured in Chile.
But it is estimated...
...that another 30,000 did not come forward.
The women who search for their dead...
...demand an answer...
...from those responsible for the disappearances.
These women...
...come across those who participated in the disappearance of their relatives...
...in the streets of their villages.
The torturers...
...who walk free in the streets.
This kind of situation is traumatic for those affected.
Crossing paths with someone...
...who arrested their husband or son...
...traumatises them all over again.
Maybe this is one of the differences...
...between the two searches of the past.
What do you think of these women...
...who search for the remains of their loved ones?
They continue to sift the desert.
To compare two completely different things,
...their process is similar to ours, with one big difference.
We can sleep peacefully,
...after each night spent observing the past.
Our search doesn't disturb our sleep.
Sometimes the heat bothers us, but we sleep.
The next day, we plunge back, untroubled, into the past.
But these women must find it hard to sleep...
...after searching through human remains,
...looking for a past they are unable to find.
They'll not sleep well until they do so.
That is the major difference.
There's no comparison.
That's my opinion.
What is strange...
...is that society should understand these women better...
...than it does astronomers.
But the opposite is true.
Society has a greater understanding of the astronomers,
...in their search for the past,
...than of these women who search for human remains.
There is a certain reticence and that worries me.
People say, "It's in the past, enough's enough!"
That's easy to say.
Until they find their loved ones,
...they'll never find peace.
I can't imagine what they must be going through.
I don't know what I'd do...
...if a sister, a brother or one of my parents...
...were lost somewhere in the desert,
...in this vast expanse.
Personally, as an astronomer,
...I would imagine my father or mother in space,
...lost in the galaxy somewhere.
I would look for them through the telescopes.
I would be very anxious...
...as it would be difficult to find them in the vastness.
It's the same for these women...
...as the Atacama Desert is so immense.
Who knows where they are?
For 17 years, Pinochet assassinated and buried the bodies...
...of thousands of political prisoners.
So that the bodies could never be found,
...the dictatorship dug them up and disposed of the remains elsewhere...
...or threw them into the sea.
The women of Calama searched for 28 years,
...until 2002.
Some of them continue to search as victims are still being found.
During the shooting of this film, they found the body...
...of a disappeared female prisoner...
...in another part of the desert.
These women...
...provided us with various facts,
...one of which proved vital.
Whilst searching in the desert,
...they discovered something curious:
...tiny pieces of human bones.
An expert confirmed that these were indeed human bones.
It was strange, the pieces were so tiny.
They weren't skeletons,
...but fragments of skulls, of feet,
...shards of long bones.
When they took us there,
...we, as archaeologists,
...noticed that the soil had been turned over.
These fragments, which are flat,
...must be the splinters of a thighbone or the bone of an arm.
The exterior of these bones is smooth.
This must be the inside of a bone...
...as it is porous.
It is much thicker.
Their whiteness is due to calcination by the sun.
What did you find of your brother?
A foot. It was still in his shoe.
Some of his teeth.
I found part of his forehead, his nose,
...nearly all of the left side of his skull.
The bit behind the ear with a bullet mark.
The bullet came out here.
That shows he was shot from below.
I don't know what position he was in.
They finished him off with a bullet in the forehead.
All of this part of the skull was shattered.
They shot him twice in the head.
I remembered his tender expression...
...and this was all that remained.
A few teeth and bits of bones.
And a foot.
Our final moment together,
...was when his foot was at my house.
When the mass grave was discovered,
...I knew it was his shoe and his foot.
That night, I got up...
...and went to stroke his foot.
There was... a smell of decay.
It was still in a sock.
A burgundy sock.
Dark red.
I took it out of the bag and looked at it.
I remained sitting in the lounge for a long time.
My mind was blank.
I was incapable of thinking.
I was in total shock.
The next day, my husband went to work...
...and I spent all morning with my brother's foot.
We were reunited.
It was a great joy and a great disappointment...
...because only then did I take in the fact that my brother was dead.
The bodies of Calama...
...were dug up with a machine.
A machine that digs,
...with five teeth.
These bodies were dug up on the orders of the military high command.
But fragments of skulls...
...fell from the right side of the machine,
...and of feet, from the left side.
The bodies were loaded onto a truck.
We photographed the marks and reconstructed the operation.
The bodies were then taken to a place which even today remains unknown.
The truck had a driver.
There were soldiers to unload the bodies.
And, most importantly, the truck was part of a detachment,
...a division under military authority.
It's up to the military to provide this information...
...so that our friends from Calama...
...can give their dead the burial they deserve.
Will you carry on searching?
For as long as I can,
...if we must carry on searching,
...I will do so.
Even if I have many doubts...
...and I ask myself questions which I can't answer.
They say they unearthed them, put them in bags...
...and threw them into the sea.
Did they really throw them into the sea?
I can't find the answer to this question.
What if they threw them out nearby, somewhere in the mountains?
At this point in my life,
...I'm 70,
...I find it hard to believe what I'm told.
They taught me not to believe.
It's hard for me.
Sometimes I feel like an idiot...
...because I never stop asking questions...
...and nobody gives me the answers I want.
If someone were to tell me...
...they threw them out on the top of that mountain,
...I would find a way of getting right to the top.
I'm not as strong as I was 20 years ago.
I'm not as healthy.
It would be difficult.
But hope gives you strength.
I no longer count the times...
...Vicky and I have gone into the desert.
We set out full of hope...
...and return with our heads hanging.
But we always pick ourselves up,
...give ourselves a shake
... and set off again the next day even more hopeful...
...and more impatient to find them.
Some people must wonder...
...why we want bones.
I want them so much!
And I'm not the only one.
When they found one of Mario's jawbones,
...I told them I didn't want it.
I told Dr Patricia Hernández,
"I want him whole."
"They took him away whole,
I don't want just a piece of him."
And I'm not saying it just for him,
...but for all the disappeared.
All of them!
If I found him today and
I were to die tomorrow,
...I would die happy.
But I don't want to die.
I don't want to die before I find him.
As I told you the other day,
...I wish the telescopes...
...didn't just look into the sky,
...but could also see through the earth...
...so that we could find them.
Like this...
Then, a bit further on.
We would sweep the desert with a telescope.
Downwards.
And give thanks to the stars for helping us find them.
I'm just dreaming.
These lines you see on the screen form a spectrum.
This is the digital imprint of a star.
This is the spectrum.
These are the calcium lines of the star.
If my son had been executed during any dictatorship,
...no matter who I was, my education or my beliefs,
...I would never be able to forget.
I would be morally obliged to preserve his memory.
We cannot forget our dead.
We must keep them in our memory.
The courts of justice must do their work,
...human rights organisations too,
...everyone involved must take a stand.
That's to be expected.
But we absolutely cannot forget a tragedy like this.
PISAGUA MASS GRAVE
JUNE 1990
We must continue the search.
If they were thrown into the sea,
...we will find a trace of them someday.
Many were indeed thrown into the sea.
If they put the bodies in a mine,
...an abandoned place, we'll find them eventually.
It suits them that there are fewer and fewer of us women.
Fewer problems.
Because we are a problem.
For society, for justice, for everyone.
For them we are the lowest of the low.
We are Chile's leprosy.
That's what I think.
IT WAS NOT A WAR
IT WAS A MASSACRE
There were many groups of women searching:
...in Arica, Iquique,
...Pisagua, La Serena,
...Colina, Paine, Lonquén,
Concepción, Temuco,
Punta Arenas...
These women's search never crossed paths with that of the astronomers...
...who were tracking another kind of body: celestial bodies.
Whilst these women handled the desert matter...
...the astronomers discovered that the earth's matter...
...was the same throughout the cosmos.
10,000 years ago, the first inhabitants of Atacama...
...gathered the pebbles washed up by the sea.
They also knew something of the stars...
...and they buried their dead at night.
Scientists collected the remains of these men of antiquity...
...and classified them meticulously.
They studied them...
...like the pages of a unique book...
...and today preserve them like treasure.
When I was a child, my mother took me to a museum...
...to see the skeleton of a whale.
I stayed for a long time...
...beneath this skeleton that is still there today.
I imagined it was the roof of a house...
...where other whales could live.
Today, there are other skeletons...
...that are not in a museum.
They are made of calcium,
...the same calcium that stars are made of.
But unlike them, they have no names.
We don't know which souls they belonged to.
They are the remains of remains.
The remains of the disappeared of the military dictatorship...
...that have not yet been identified.
I wonder...
...for how long they will lie in these boxes.
Will they be placed in a monument one day?
Will they have earned a museum space like the whale?
Will they be given a burial one day?
Valentina works for the leading astronomy organisation in Chile.
Her grandfather taught her to observe the sky...
...when she was a child.
She is married with two children.
In 1975, when she was one year old,
...she was detained with her grandparents by Pinochet's police.
I am the daughter of detained and disappeared parents.
First they detained my grandparents.
They were held for several hours.
They threatened them relentlessly...
...to make them reveal where my parents were,
...or else I, too, would disappear.
With this threat,
...my grandparents took them to where we lived.
After detaining my parents,
...they returned me to my grandparents who brought me up.
Astronomy has somehow helped me...
...to give another dimension to the pain,
...to the absence,
...to the loss.
Sometimes, when one is alone with that pain,
...and these moments are necessary,
...the pain becomes oppressive.
I tell myself it's all part of a cycle...
...which didn't begin and won't end with me,
...nor with my parents, or with my children.
I tell myself we are all part of a current,
...of an energy, a recyclable matter.
Like the stars which must die...
...so that other stars can be born, other planets, a new life.
In this context,
...what happened to my parents
...and their absence take on another dimension.
It takes on another meaning and frees me a little...
...from this great suffering,
...as I feel that nothing really comes to an end.
My grandparents are the happiness in my life.
Thanks to them, I've been able to write my own story.
Not merely from a painful perspective...
...but also a joyful one,
...optimistic,
...driven by this strength and the desire to progress.
My grandparents were wise...
...realising they had a double responsibility.
They found a way...
...to make my parents important reference points for me.
They passed on my parents' values and their strength.
What is more, my grandparents were able to overcome their pain...
...so that I could have...
...a happy and healthy childhood.
Sometimes I feel like...
...I'm a product with a manufacturing defect...
...which is invisible.
I find it funny when people tell me that it doesn't show...
...that I'm the daughter of disappeared prisoners.
I realise that my children don't have this defect.
Nor does my husband and that makes me happy.
I am surrounded by people...
...who have no manufacturing defect.
I am happy that my son is growing up like this.
Compared to the immensity of the cosmos,
...the problems of the Chilean people might seem insignificant.
But if we laid them out on a table,
...they would be as vast as a galaxy.
Whilst making this film, looking back,
...I found in these marbles...
...the innocence of the Chile of my childhood.
Back then,
...each of us could carry the entire universe...
...in the depths of our pockets.
I am convinced that memory has a gravitational force.
It is constantly attracting us.
Those who have a memory...
...are able to live in the fragile present moment.
Those who have none...
...don't live anywhere.
Each night, slowly, impassively,
...the centre of the galaxy passes over Santiago.

Oh! Where did the ball go?
Keep your eye on the ball.
Come on, Nik. It's easy!
You don't know how to play.
- Like you do?
- Look what you did.
So are we going to the beach this weekend?
The water's still cold.
I don't care.
Even if it's freezing, I'm going in.
No matter what, huh?
We're going in no matter what.
Oh, you two are tough, huh?
You afraid of the water?
- Yeah, it's happening.
- We're going.
Hey, turn around.
- Nik.
- May I?
- Where have you been?
- With friends.
Have a sip.
I can't drink that.
- Come on.
- I can't.
The kitten doesn't drink vinegar, huh?
- Cheers!
- Hello, Shpend!
- Hey there.
- Still celebrating?
Help yourself.
- How are the bride and groom?
- Young and in love!
Hey, Mark.
Are you collecting cigarettes?
Take it. Take Nik's too.
Wait, I'll give you another.
Very generous of you, Sokol, but I don't want to get in trouble.
They might be stolen.
At least we earn ours.
Relax, Mark.
You must be tired from moving the stones on my land.
Maybe they move by themselves.
Better be careful, Nik.
You never know where those stones might fly.
Sokol, may you never get fat, or you won't be able to work our land.
To your health!
Here's to the health of your horse Klinsmann, and those shortcuts he takes.
Klinsmann thanks you and leaves his respects wherever he goes.
Even without Klinsmann, we'd pull our cart across our grandfather's land.
Cheers!
Why don't you go around, Mark?
You never know.
Sometimes the long way is shorter... and safer.
Stop it.
Enough.
Cheers!
Cheers, old man!
Who you calling an old man?
Here you go.
Milk.
I'll get that.
Go get ready.
Get the tomatoes from Uncle Zef's and take them inside.
How'd you sleep?
Good. You? You're all up?
Yeah.
Has Mark left?
He's getting ready.
In front of the mirror again?
- What's your problem?
- You're like a girl.
Watch it.
Staring at himself...
Is that what you're wearing?
What's wrong with it?
Look.
Roll down your sleeves.
- Leave them alone. They're fine.
- Roll them down.
Just leave them.
They're fine.
Unzip it.
Just leave me alone.
I know how to dress. You crazy?
Do whatever you want.
Leave me alone.
I'm just saying it looks ridiculous.
Breakfast is on the table.
- Roll your sleeves down.
- Go away.
Wake up the little ones.
I need to get ready for work.
Dren, wake up.
Bora, time for school.
Come on, get up.
Dad, can I have 200 lek?
I need a new notebook.
You go right through them.
But it's for school.
Rudina, here you go.
Thank you.
Dren, finish your milk.
- I don't want any more.
- Finish it.
We need to move the cement up to the roof.
For the back wall?
We'll do it tomorrow.
I'm off to work.
Bye.
- Bora, where's your backpack?
- By the TV.
Go get it.
And get Dren's too.
Hurry up, Dren.
What are you doing?
No electricity?
Nope.
Director!
- The keys.
- Thanks.
Did you see her smiling?
Yeah, she was smiling.
She was, right?
Hang on.
Again?
Let's go.
You're crazy.
Four or five computers and I'm set.
It'll be awesome.
Yeah, right.
Where you gonna get the money?
Clear out, guys.
We've got work to do.
Move it.
But we were here first.
Come on. Let's go.
Clear out.
Move.
I swear, it happened so many times.
He came and grabbed my paper from behind.
He wouldn't let go.
Rudina, come on.
I'll give you a ride.
I'm going.
How was school?
Giddyap!
Good.
The teacher gave us a quiz.
I had to talk about sponges.
The thing is, people thought they were plants.
But they have, like, fins...
Fins?
Yeah, like, fins they use to beat the water, and they take all the water and all the bacteria, and it goes in this, like, cavity, and they feed off it, but sometimes stuff gets stuck inside and can't get out.
I mean, it gets out eventually.
I'm not sure how, but it's really neat.
- What did your teacher give you?
- A ten.
Dad...
Mira and Irena are going to Shkodra
Saturday to buy shoes.
And?
Please, I need new shoes.
I'll go with you.
What do you know about girls' shoes?
I know plenty.
Pass me two corn breads.
- How are you, Mark?
- I'm fine.
Thank you.
Hi, Rudina. How are you?
- Your new passport?
- Yes, I got it.
But the photo is terrible.
Let me see.
No, Mark.
Let me see.
I was afraid I'd close my eyes.
Just like in our class photo.
Did you and Sokol get into it again?
With all due respect, your cousin is an idiot.
The two of you are ridiculous.
He's ridiculous.
Of course, you're the sane one.
Forget about it.
It's not worth it.
See you. Bye, Rudina.
Bye.
- What's this?
- It's good, right?
For Facebook?
I gotta upload it.
Let me sign in.
Come on, even this one?
- Why not?
- You're crazy.
You can't post that.
It wasn't easy, believe me.
The girls will go nuts.
Here you go.
Take my bag for me.
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you later.
Tying your shoes here again?
Can I help it if they come untied here?
Sure, of course not.
Where are you going?
You going to Suadi's party?
It's his last.
He's off to London.
What's up with Suadi going to London?
Like you wouldn't want to go to London?
What for?
To lug bricks around?
Maybe you'd get some muscles.
So you wanna go to
London too now?
No, I'm going to university.
Your parents won't even let you go to a party, never mind university.
What's a party got to do with university?
Anyway, they know what I'm like.
And what are you like?
What does that mean?
Nothing. I'm kidding.
You're always kidding.
Who was that?
None of your business.
Who was it?
- My sister.
- Let me see your phone.
You don't believe me?
- Can I have your number?
- What do you need it for?
- You know my number?
- I don't want it.
Come on.
Give me your phone a sec.
Why should I give you my phone?
Just let me see it a second.
- That your number?
- Yeah.
You have money on your phone?
- Why?
What are you doing?
- Come on, relax.
- You're terrible.
You suck.
Bardha...
Son of a...
What the hell?
What the hell, what?
What are you doing?
I had to close the road.
What for?
I have to keep my chickens in.
You expect me to go all the way around?
The other way?
Do whatever you want.
It's not my problem.
I have to get through this road.
Enough is enough.
The state gave us this land because we worked it.
When my grandfather had this land, our family always let the town use this road.
Your family had a tradition of bending over.
Don't talk about my family with your dirty mouth.
Then don't go around calling us thieves.
You can't close this road.
Who's gonna stop me?
You?
Go ahead and try.
Let's see what you can do.
You don't have the balls.
Get back in the cart.
Now!
This is the last time you speak like that in front of my daughter, understand?
Take that ugly cart and get out of here.
You feel tough holding that thing?
If it wasn't for my daughter,
I'd put you in your place.
So come back without her.
Feed Klinsmann.
I have to talk to your uncle.
Zef!
Stay.
- What did she say?
- It's not what she said.
Just tell me what she said.
She didn't have to say anything.
It was what she was thinking.
So what was she thinking?
Well, she didn't reject me, so...
She didn't reject you.
Not bad.
Pass me that wrench.
This one?
The other one.
Pass me the shock.
These things are completely shot.
I already talked to Fredi.
I'm getting the Kawasaki ones.
For this thing?
You should just buy a new bike.
Lift it up.
Lift it.
A little more.
- Nik, where have you been?
- What's up?
We've been looking for you.
- What's going on?
- Come with us.
- Wait, I'm just...
- Come on. This can't wait.
Where are you going?
Quick. Move.
- What's going on?
- Just get in and we'll tell you.
Get your head down.
What's going on?
Get inside, quick.
Thank you.
- Did they tell you?
- Yeah. How did it happen?
Sokol blocked the road and got into a fight with Dad.
Dad told Uncle Zef, and they went back.
And stabbed him?
They arrested Uncle Zef.
Hey, boy!
Come here.
Do you know where your father is?
No.
When was the last time you saw him?
This morning.
Tell me about the fight he got into with Sokol at the pub.
He doesn't know anything.
Who started the fight?
Listen... he'd be safer in custody than he is in hiding.
We don't know where he is.
Let's go.
As if we didn't know
Sokol's cousin is a police officer.
Have you heard from Dad?
Adrian Pragami saw him running across his field afterwards.
He's probably headed for Rragam.
We've tried calling.
His phone is off.
For the moment, you might not owe his family any blood at all.
But you know that's not the way they see it.
By the Kanun, your family must stay in isolation.
But Sokol did you wrong with your road and your land.
So we have to know what happened: who attacked whom, what started it.
Maybe he stabbed himself as he tumbled to the ground.
Even if my sons are partly to blame,
Sokol blocked the road.
He cut off my son's livelihood.
So there should be no blood debt.
Ded, the Kanun says to protect your land.
Remember what happened to Kujtim Sula?
What happened?
Somebody broke into his house.
He tried to defend it with a gun and ended up shooting the boy.
Even then, Kujtim spent five years in isolation just for trying to protect his home.
But here they don't know what they're defending.
They believe it's their land to protect.
I wish Dad would send a message already.
It could be dangerous.
So how many people are we sending?
Three people to ask for a besa.
We need to send the right people.
If they grant the besa, how many go to the funeral?
Twenty.
I want to go too if they give us a besa.
You're too young.
I'm old enough to be targeted.
I should represent my father.
Out of the question.
Get back inside!
What do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see.
What the hell are you thinking?
You don't set foot outside, understand?
From now on, we all stay inside.
Out of respect for their loss.
Dren as well.
- Dren's just a child.
- It doesn't matter!
It's too risky.
You're gonna use up all the minutes.
Hello, Shpend. How are you?
Everything okay?
Fine.
- What's this?
- My wife prepared these for you.
That's very kind of her.
Thank you.
How are you?
Mark sent a text message to let you know he's safe.
It was from an anonymous number.
Rudina.
Your grandfather and I have decided that starting tomorrow, you'll do the bread route.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Why?
We need to do something.
We can't survive like this.
As it is, my foreman will fire me if I don't get back.
Just 'cause she's a girl?
Nik, you need to help her.
What about school?
And your brothers?
How would they feel if you went while they couldn't?
For how long?
Until your father comes back.
When is that going to be?
Always put the chain on this side so you don't hurt him.
Try it.
No, the way I told you.
Like this.
And always on the fourth link.
Understand?
Yes.
You have to tie this here.
Twice.
Tight. Understand?
Show me.
Don't be so nervous.
He's not going to do anything.
Good.
Tight.
Again, tight. Good.
Shh! Klinsmann.
Rudina.
Nik.
What?
- I'm hungry.
- Ask Bora.
- I don't know what to make.
- Whatever Rudina makes.
- I'm hungry!
- Enough!
Rudina...
I already got my bread.
From who?
Kristjan Lukaj.
He's been bringing it from Shkodra.
But you always get it from us.
What can I tell you?
I can't buy bread I don't need.
Can't you just buy your usual order?
What would I do with it?
What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow... get here before Kristjan and I'll take your bread.
Okay?
Rudina.
Wait a moment.
I have to get going.
Take this.
Thank you.
No, Klinsmann. Not here.
Let's go.
How am I supposed to kill him?
You have to be faster.
I'm trying, but he's too fast.
You shouldn't play if you don't know how.
You think you're the only one who can play?
I know how to play.
Go, Bora.
Hey.
What's up?
What's this?
What have you done here?
Some modifications.
Check it out.
This is new?
What did you do?
It's crooked!
You got the shocks.
What do you think?
Where'd you get the money?
Enough, enough.
Over here.
I can't go out there.
What's happening?
There was a party at Klodi's.
- How was it?
- Good. We had fun.
- What was it for?
- His 18th birthday.
The whole class went.
- Everyone?
The whole senior class.
Everyone?
Yeah.
Did you get drunk?
Yeah, what do you think?
- Was Bardha there?
- She was there.
But Klodi, I don't know...
Why? What happened?
We were all dancing, and he kept making her laugh.
Klodi? Are you kidding?
I'm just saying.
You better do something.
Write some love poems or something.
What do you do all day?
Think.
If you keep sitting on your ass, you'll end up looking like my uncle.
You all right?
I'm fine.
At first I couldn't believe it was true, but now...
They'll figure something out eventually.
Yeah, but how long is eventually?
You remember that kid in fourth grade who had to stay in isolation?
Jetmir Malaj.
He was stuck in his house for, like, six years.
Yeah, but they got some mediator, and they settled it.
Eventually they always mediate.
All they do is sit and talk about the Kanun.
Ndue Binaku's cousin asked me to deliver lime to his new house.
- And you did it?
- Yeah.
- How much did he pay you?
- Three thousand.
You shouldn't do something like that for less than 5,000.
I was already going in that direction.
It doesn't matter.
What was I supposed to do?
Rudina, where's the cell phone?
I bought more minutes.
I'll do it.
Where'd you put the phone?
- Over there.
Did you find someplace safe?
It's best you don't know where I am.
What about the police?
They've been by twice.
Are you okay?
Well enough.
My eyes are acting up.
I need my drops.
Has Sokol's family tried anything?
They refuse to listen to us.
They didn't give us a besa for the funeral.
They say they were doubly insulted because you and Uncle Zef came onto their land.
We went to talk to him.
We didn't do anything.
We were unarmed.
He welcomed us with his knife.
He attacked you?
He jumped on us like a crazy dog.
Mark... your soup is getting cold.
Do we have any cigarettes?
Did Dritan bring the gun?
I sent word for him to bring it.
You need to keep it loaded... or there's no point having it.
Did Sokol do that to you?
Now load it.
Have you come across any of them?
No.
Make sure you don't provoke them.
If you see them on the street, avoid them.
Kristjan Lukaj has been bringing in bread from Shkodra.
But...
I start earlier now.
The time.
The light.
Good-bye.
Bread.
Thanks.
How are you?
Fine. And you?
Good.
Here's your money.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Good morning.
Four packs of cigarettes.
The same kind as always.
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.
You sell a lot of cigarettes?
Depends on the people.
But... how much does a carton cost?
Fifteen thousand, twenty thousand, depending on the brand.
And how much do you make?
Why do you want to know?
If I buy three cartons, can I pay you at the end of the week?
I work with money, Rudina.
I give credit all the time.
You're going to sell cigarettes?
A girl like you shouldn't even be selling bread.
I'll give you the money in a few days.
Thursday you'll pay me.
But... since I'm getting three cartons,
I need a discount.
That's how it works.
- Hey.
- You're here?
Of course I'm here.
You thought I'd chicken out?
You're crazy.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I can't believe I made it.
Did you have trouble getting out?
No, it was easy.
It was weird how easy it was.
What do you do all day?
I don't know.
Watch TV... think of you.
Shut up.
I heard there was a party for Klodi's birthday.
Yeah. It was boring.
I heard you were laughing at his jokes.
- I was not.
- That's not what I heard.
You heard wrong.
- Really?
- Yes.
Did you miss me?
Do you really think they would try something?
My grandfather says they'd be happy if they shot me or Dren.
He's just a little boy.
They know it would hurt my family more than anything.
My uncle has only daughters.
Anyway, they're happy to see us suffer.
They won't let it end.
It's so stupid.
I hate Sokol Bala.
I shouldn't talk badly about the dead, but if it wasn't for him...
Sokol Bala, your father... your uncle...
My father was just defending himself.
Sokol insulted him.
The slightest insult and they go crazy.
They all act like children.
I told Fatjana
I was going to meet you.
What? Why?
Don't worry.
- What if she tells someone?
- She won't tell anyone.
Why did you tell her?
I don't know.
I just had to tell someone.
She said I was stupid for seeing you.
Who knows how long you'll be in the feud.
You agree with her?
Wash your hands.
Put it in and pack it down.
Hold it.
Hold it straight.
What's this?
We made weights!
Nik.
- Why did you do this here?
- What?
Why did you do this here?
What's the big deal?
You expect me to clean up after you?
I'm not cleaning it up.
Who asked you to?
What do you do all day?
Stop yelling.
It's not a big deal.
Nik!
Get down!
Dren!
Why should they shoot at you?
You've stayed inside.
You've been respectful.
Zef got 18 years.
They should be satisfied.
Now's the time to send someone to talk to them.
What about Samet Leka?
Why should they listen to Samet?
He does business with their family.
That was years ago.
It's not the right time to send someone.
Clearly their blood is still hot.
What about the person who mediated for Enver Malaj's family?
I used to go to school with his son, Jetmir.
Who mediated for Enver Malaj?
It was their flagsman.
No, they used Hasan Pema.
Who is Hasan Pema?
He's from Shkodra.
He's done a lot of mediations.
We'll deal with it ourselves.
But we need someone with experience.
We have plenty of experience.
But we've never done this before.
You can't just send some stranger to their door.
You have to send the right person with a group of elders whom they know and respect.
You wait for the right moment to go.
They say no.
Then you wait and go again.
That's just how it works.
An outsider would be neutral.
They might respect someone who's mediated before.
No.
We'll solve our own problems.
How many still owe on credit?
Only six.
Good.
That's good.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You always give me ones that are still warm.
I pull them from the bottom of the pile.
Just like your father.
How is he?
I haven't seen him.
On top of everything else, you're without your father.
You should know not all my family is of the same mind.
My uncle understands there's enough blame to go around.
It's my cousins who keep on about your father.
They insist he should be in jail before they'll consider mediation.
But...
I know, I know.
It's so stupid.
Come on.
We did this last week.
Dren... start working and show me what we learned last week.
Come on.
Dren, answer me.
What are you doing?
Sit up properly.
Pick up the pencil.
Are you listening? Start.
- I don't want to.
Listen to your teacher.
Where are you going?
Come back here!
What are you doing?
Get back over there.
Give me that.
Give me the controller.
- It's mine. It's my game.
- Give it to me.
Dren!
Come here!
Dren, come out!
Dren.
You hear me?
Don't be a baby.
Mr. Skendaj's waiting.
Dren!
Fine. Don't come out.
See if I care.
Dren... you remember the story
Dad used to tell us about the little boy and the giant?
Remember what the little boy did?
Remember how he was?
That's how you have to be.
Understand?
You have to be strong.
Turn back.
Don't cross my path with that cart.
Turn back!
Stay in your village with that thing.
Got it?
Go!
Go, Klinsmann.
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.
- Hasan Pema.
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello.
- How are you? Nik Lindani.
- Hasan Pema.
- Thank you for coming.
Good to be here.
You're Nik?
- Yes.
How are you?
Ded Lindani.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
By the Kanun, they should not threaten a girl or kill her for revenge.
Either they don't know the Kanun or they're twisting it.
The Kanun respects him who forgives more than him who kills.
When Nik's friend told me about the situation you're in and his sister being threatened, my organization felt obliged to do something.
My heart hurts to hear of your troubles.
You need someone with experience.
Over the past 15 years
I've mediated 47 feuds.
If you entrust this case to me,
I promise to work hard until blood is forgiven.
How long will it take?
Peace must have strong roots so that it cannot be easily destroyed.
Of course... all of this work comes with certain expenses.
The telephone... gas... certain gifts.
Their wound is still bleeding.
The Kanun calls for the payment of six sacks of gold at the closure of a feud.
We already know what the Kanun says.
Reading the Kanun and applying it are two different things.
But my uncle's in jail.
He's already paying for the crime.
But your father is still free.
He didn't do anything.
Didn't do anything?
Holding Sokol while Zef stabbed him?
You saw what happened?
I've done my homework.
You mean you've been gossiping.
They don't care what's right.
All they want is blood.
That's why I'm here.
You need someone with experience to represent you.
We know what happened, and we're very sorry.
It's Sokol's actions that bring us here.
He came out with a knife to stab them in their backs.
They did nothing but defend themselves.
You can't condemn a murder and defend it at the same time.
You're calling us murderers and hypocrites?
As I said, we appreciate your coming to visit.
Of course, our door is always open to you.
Give me some of the white ones.
Hurry up.
Use the blue ones.
Who is it?
NO MEDIATOR CAN SAVE YOU.
You made it.
What's this?
Barbie!
Dren, what's wrong?
Dren.
Come here.
He's tired.
Are you tired?
You forget how to talk?
He hasn't been feeling well.
What happened?
He wants to go to school.
Is the school still sending his teacher?
Is Mr. Skendaj coming to give you lessons?
Dren and Bora should be in school.
You think I don't know that?
I thought we could get a besa for them to go back to school.
A besa?
They don't need a besa.
They're children.
By the Kanun they shouldn't even be targeted.
Then why are they staying home?
If we accept a besa, they can take it away whenever they want.
We'd be at their mercy.
Have you thought about that?
What makes you even think they'd give us a besa?
We don't know if we don't try.
So you bring in someone from outside?
Do you know what he's telling their family?
How do you know he's not making things worse?
You think his kind cares about resolving this?
What's he going to live on if feuds are resolved?
Use your head.
Then let's ask Mr. Skendaj.
To do what?
- To ask for a besa.
- He's right.
He teaches Sokol's children too.
They might listen to him.
She should have had a proper birthday.
Then you shouldn't have picked a fight with Dad.
He shouldn't have picked a fight with me.
Why does he even bother to come visit?
How can you say that?
It just makes everything worse.
- It's not his fault!
- Whose fault is it, then?
Not here. Over there.
More on this side.
Wait.
Bora!
Let Tom in.
Hey, Nik.
What's with all the bricks?
I got something.
What?
What's that?
- Check it out.
- What's this?
My uncle in Toronto sent me money for it.
Look at the video.
The class.
Hey, Nik! It's me.
How are you?
Is this recording?
Tom got a new phone.
Come back. We miss you.
Go to the next clip. Ready?
- For what?
- Look.
Hey, Nik. How are you?
Everything's still the same.
Nothing new.
We had literature class.
I have to do the homework.
It's easy.
Did Tom tell you
Arben and Lindita broke up?
You know what Arben's like.
What else?
I'm sorry I haven't written, but you know how it is.
We miss you.
Everybody asks about you.
Even teachers ask about you.
I'm sorry you have to stay home.
I hope things get better.
That's all for now.
Bye.
How do I play it again?
- Oh, God...
- Once more!
- How do I look?
- Fine. Just start.
Hi, Bardha.
How are you?
Is everything okay?
Where are you now, in school or...
Why are you asking questions?
Bardha, this is my gym.
My bars.
I put boards up.
Here too.
I'm going to close this up.
Thanks for sending the video.
I was happy to see you.
I miss all of you too.
Seems like you're having a good time.
I can't wait to see you again.
Bye.
Enough.
Walk straight to school.
Keep a close eye on Dren.
Don't let him out of your sight.
When you're done, come straight home.
Don't forget to thank Mr. Skendaj.
Bye.
And then my machine jammed, and the foreman took it out on me.
He was yelling at you in Italian?
No, that's the owner.
The foreman is from Postribe.
- How are you?
- Hi.
How's it going?
Can I have a pack of Marlboros?
You have any without the tax stamp?
- The tax stamp?
How are you? Good?
Fine.
I heard the police were questioning Shpend about Mark.
Shpend?
Why were they questioning
Shpend?
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Nik!
Put your head down.
What did you do to the wall?
Are you crazy?
- It's a wall. What's your problem?
- What are you talking about?
Go complain to Dad!
What did you do to the wall?
Leave me alone.
I can do what I want.
- Get down!
I don't want to!
Come down!
I don't want to!
- I told you to get down!
- What's your problem?
What are you doing?
Put down that knife!
Get out of here!
Stop it!
What's going on here?
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife, Nik!
He's messed up everything!
Out! Out!
Clean up.
Go!
Take the kids and get out.
Out! Out!
Go, Klinsmann.
Move.
Do you have Marlboros without the tax stamp?
The ones from Montenegro?
No, I don't.
You know where I can find them?
Try over there.
Excuse me.
Do you have Marlboros without the tax stamp?
No, I don't have any.
I need five cartons.
I don't have that many.
You know where I can get them?
Try the man over there.
He doesn't have them.
Leave me alone.
I've got things to do.
Can I buy the ones you have?
No. Now go on.
Is Dren asleep?
Yeah.
Did you hear that?
Get water! Rudina, quick!
Rudina, quick! Water!
Quick!
Nik, don't get close!
Don't get so close!
Water! Quickly!
Go inside, go inside.
You shouldn't have come.
Someone could be watching... just waiting for you to show up.
We have to think about how to respond.
We can't even begin to negotiate as long as you're still free.
Mara said as much to Rudina.
You're talking to Mara about me?
She brought it up.
Go to the police.
If you're innocent, they'll set you free, and Sokol's family will see it.
If I'm innocent?
Sokol's cousin is a cop.
You think they'll treat me fairly?
At least in prison you'd be safe.
And we could begin to talk to them.
You want to trade your father away?
Is that what you want?
We can't live like this just because you and Zef...
You can't live like this?
How do you think it is for me?
You think I like living in hiding?
Away from my family?
So turn yourself in.
For yourself, for us.
You want to be free, whatever the cost.
You've forgotten that this whole thing started because I was defending this family.
By holding Sokol down while Uncle Zef...
I was trying to save my brother's life!
You're ready to sell me out... just like that.
Is it that easy?
Don't move! Don't move!
Hands up!
Police! Police!
Get down!
On the ground! Get down!
Hold him!
Hands behind your back!
Stay down!
Get him up! Up!
Let's go! Move!
Nik.
I wasn't sure which one.
Those will do.
What are you waiting for?
Go get ready.
Nik... you finally get a besa, and now you want to stay in the house?
What will I tell your father when he asks why you didn't come visit?
We have to do something for him...
I can't go there.
I expect you to work on the stable.
See if Dren and Bora are ready.
How's your father?
Have you seen him?
No.
We need money for a lawyer.
You have to take advantage of your besa.
That's why I'm here, Mara.
We can't rely on just a besa.
If you could go and talk to them...
It's too early.
You just got the besa.
We need to do something.
It's not a woman's business.
It's a man's job.
Women's opinions don't count.
My father's in prison.
What more do they expect... for me to shoot him?
It's not that, but...
What about Valmir threatening my sister?
He's a bad influence in our family.
He's caused a lot of problems.
That's why I'm saying... if you could go... to talk with your uncle...
Maybe by Christmas he might be willing to receive someone.
Maybe we can do something then.
- This Christmas?
- Yes.
Stay, Klinsmann.
Does he kick?
No, he doesn't kick.
He just doesn't know you, and there are other horses, so he's nervous.
His legs are crooked.
He has two bumps over his eyes.
Means he scares easy.
But he's a strong horse.
And he's a hard worker.
I'll give you 200,000.
No, 400.
Four hundred?
It's not a female.
Only a female's worth 400,000.
Two fifty.
Three hundred and... three fifty.
We'll leave it at 300,000.
Three hundred thousand.
Three twenty.
He's a very good horse.
I'm not lowering my price.
- Hey, turn left.
- Why?
Just do it. You'll see.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'll be right back.
- Hey.
- Nik.
Did you hear?
- Yeah, they gave you a besa.
- Yeah, two weeks.
That's it?
We asked for a month, but that's all they gave us.
Anyway, I'm happy for you.
I wanted to see you, but I wasn't sure if...
Nik.
Anyway, I just wanted to say hi.
Well, enjoy your freedom.
- See you.
- Bye.
What did she say?
Nothing.
Let's do something.
Come inside.
You're out of jail?
Is this how you welcome me?
Why didn't you visit me?
You got a besa.
How have you used it?
Do they know you got out?
Nik, they took away the besa.
What?
The besa isn't important.
What are you saying?
There will be others.
The only way to mediate was if you were in jail.
You want me to stay in jail?
- What are we gonna...
- Stop!
We're both inside now?
When you were in jail, we had a chance, but now...
I've done everything
I can to respect your loss.
My life is in your hands.
If you want to kill me,
I'm right here.
So kill me now, or let us go free.
What are you doing here?
Are you trying to provoke my grandfather?
I've come to end this feud.
You bribed your father's way out of jail.
How much will you pay to end this feud?
Your father's freedom is an insult.
Being trapped inside isn't freedom.
Good, because you'll be inside your entire life.
Now go home.
Go home where you belong.
Hear me?
Not here!
Not on our land!
It would be shameful on our land!
Get up.
I've listened to you.
Now you listen to me.
I wake up every morning with tears in my eyes for my son.
This feud pains us as much as it does you.
Your father is out of jail, and if he ever steps out of his house, he's dead.
You say you respect me, but you come here with ultimatums.
You come here with great courage, but you're still young, just a kid.
You want to be free.
Okay.
But you, and only you.
You have 24 hours to say good-bye to your family.
After that, don't ever come back.
If you go, we won't come after you.
But if you return, we'll bury you next to my son.
Now go.
Take him.
Where will he go?
Where's he going to stay?
If he leaves, he'll never come back.
Eventually we'll reconcile, and then he'll return.
If he leaves, it's the same as giving them blood.
I'm going to lose my son.
You want to give them that?
It's better than him being stuck here.
Nik... you have to go.
Speak.
Why aren't you saying anything?
What do you want me to say?
You always say you're protecting this family, and now you're not saying a word.
He should go.
My heart doesn't want it.
But it's his choice.
Not mine.
What about you?
What about me?
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.
I'll be fine.
English Subtitles by
JeanPierreFinlandais, Jan 30 2011
In winter 2003, French heroine detox drug Subutex had displaced amfetamine as the most popular intravenous drug of Northern Finland
I was living in Rovaniemi without a job
I lived on social welfare and used drugs almost daily
During that time I started to film the life of my social circle
This is a story of my friend Jani
Need to find some (Mazda) 323
If there is no here we can go around from there
Over here.
(Joonas, director:) ... Some guy ...
Hey, did you hear?
(Joonas:) There's some people, did you hear? - I heard. reindeerspotting
ESCAPE FROM SANTALAND
(Jani:) No need to run anymore
Could you help me now please?
I have here sort of car stereo.
Brand is Sony. Wait, I read (the details).
Xplod 4 x 50 W CDX-4000RX.
This is hell of a good Sony car stereo.
Then I would also have money with it
Oh, damn.
Well could you still ask, even if half a dose (puokki) could be found?
You wouldn't happen to be able to help me?
I would only need just one (dose).
(Hurtsi:) You should have fucking taken everything at once, but.
(Jani:) I only took half (a pill/dose),
So I can finish it during night.
Do you think that these won't work?
Fucking sure these will work.
I can swear on my head for that
(Hurtsi:) I did not say that.
- Not then.
(Hurtsi:) There is not enough.
- Yes, there is.
I took the same at
Jonas' place
Initially it seemed, that there is no effect but then all of a sudden it kinda wakes you up
Take it. Try it.
(Hurtsi:) I don't want to.
Well, do not have to then.
(Hurtsi:) Just use all for yourself
Morning.
I just say that is fucking awesome to fuck someone on speed
When you have a girl going down on you, so that it starts to get hard a bit - so you bang her at least three hours nonstop
Fucking really with full power
The girl that kind of rides, that she has never received before.
We continue the trip ...
Fuck off you bitches
I have in fact that kind of asshole radar
With you it starts alarm red
Luckily there comes a time for you to punish
So police officers, rolling slowly on the parking lot checking out register plates
Clouds and those castles made of stone
Spending lonely nights in jails
The active ingredient of Subutex is buprenorphine.
Like heroine and morphine it produces a pleasant and euphoric feeling
(Jani:) I started to use drugs when I was 14 years. old.
About 5 years of drug use and soon
I will turn 20 years.
Since then I've been taking those (notkuja) drugs.
Subutex and Temgesic.
Rovaniemi has been an amphetamine (piri) city fucking long already.
But drugs came here kinda late - but surely, anyway.
We are spending a relaxing night among friend with good food and Subutex
(Jani:) Hey, Hurtsi. How much of
S you have there?
(Hurtsi:) Yeah I have some.
I was thinking if I would have bought half a S from you.
- Would it be okay for you?
- I wouldn't really want to sell.
Sell!
(Jani:) Do not touch with wet hands
Look at it now.
(Hurtsi:) Well. Do you have the money?
(Jani:) No shit, what a guy dude.
Asking me this amount of..
(Jani:) You have to get profit from a friend.
Well it does not matter, fuck.
Fuck what kind of guy that Hurtsi.
Ask 30€ from me (for half) after paying 50€ a chip himself
(Jani:) Is the Dr. Dre the bad guy here? - No. He is the boss here.
Dre is a good man here.
He is a good man here, Dr. Dre here.
Eminem is a crazy gun nut / nutcase here.
(Hurtsi:) Snoopy is just smoking, fuck. And lounging
Well it is just the right thing for Snoopy, fuck (vittu).
Enimem is fuck th best white rapper in the world.
Of course after me even though I cannot rap at all
So what, you are asking for 30€ for the half S?
Yeah.
Hohhoi, fuck.
What a dude
Fuck, whooo, what a friend.
- I also can be irritating sometimes
- Yeah, "sometimes".
Fuck, yeah.
Fuck, all the time, satan.
"All the time, "the fuck?
Take care of the shit as they are supposed to be taken care of.
That is what I have done, satan.
Fucking idiot, bloody hell.
Fuck, dares to ask from me...
Well, it does not matter, fuck.
Due to a "misunderstanding" after a failed job
2 fingers were cut from Jani with an axe
He plans to move away from Rovaniemi
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
If you just go to your flat doing nothing and you do not not eat and thus, - and constantly thinks that, fuck,
I am feeling bad, I am feeling bad -
Of course you feel bad.
When you try to be among the living and eat, and so on - then you can cope somehow.
And you are forced to cope.
Rovaniemi, This is this kind of fucking little city (tuppukylä), fuck.
In winter, a lot of snow fuck, and in the summer fucking cold.
What else can you really tell about Rovaniemi?
Here, you have spent your life, -
Months and years just flashing in your eyes.
Yet, they pass fucking slowly.
This is that sort of a place from where you constantly want to leave from
If you've never visited - and lived anywhere else than in Rovaniemi, then fucking hell!
I wouldn't at least have the energy for that
It would be the same as shooting a bullet in the head or something.
This is just too distant.
I would like get into the center of things and activities.
In principle ...
... Eye of the storm.
Due to the raids of the narcotic police
Subutex has temporarily run out from the city
Withdrawal symptoms come
Luckily there is a legal alternative:
Pams (diazepam) and alcohol
I have lost gloves.
Jou, jou, jou...
(Hurtsi:) What is my hat?
Now it is like starting.. the partying
Hurtsi, How much of the diazepams you still have?
- If you could like lend me 5?
- Fuck you!
Was that a direct response or indirect? (Hurtsi:) Think about it.
Well see what the evening brings.
(Announcer :)... Whether Lapin Kansa was faster than Santa Claus this time?
Vili, and then against Lepsu.
Now that is very tight couple.
Huhhahhei and bottle of rum!
But only after work, thank you.
What the fuck is there to see in reindeers?
We checked whether the guy would have wallets...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God!
He fell down?
Hey, from where the reindeers start?
(Announcer:) A middle-aged, educated gentleman - is in the army for 24 months.
Think about the neighbor boy from the east (Russia).
He goes to the army, and he never gets back to civilian life.
Now it is tight race.
Now, hard to tell the winner, but soon it will be announced.
Indeed, there is Veikka with the information
Information finale ...
(Jani's friends are singing
Pelle Miljoona's song [Moottoritie on Kuuma]:)
I would like to explain but the ships wait
You are a dream to me but the world is true
But the world is true
Cocaine, LSD, Ecstasy, yep
Always fresh Koskenkorva tastes as a snack
Too much, just a bit too much
I eat mushrooms
Too much, just a bit too much
I calm down with pills
Every night, when too much I fell in love
Life of an artist,
Me, Melleri and Morrison
(Jupe:) You!
(Jani:) What?
What did he say?
Call in ten minutes!
I heard today that you have called me a homerobber!
Nonsense. We settled this yesterday, when I was here.
We agreed that it is settled.
- I heard about it today.
So from whom? - What fucking difference it is from whom I heard it from?
Fuck him, who is saying those things
Why in the fuck have you said such thing?
Well you could have stolen all my stuff if you'd have wanted to.
Well you blamed me. That I would had used your drugs (töötit) as well. satan.
Haven't we already talked about this?
- Yeah.
So why do you blame a homerobber? - I do not blame you.
You have accused me as a homerobber.
- I do not accuse you as such.
You have accused! - What is coming from my mouth?: "I don't accuse".
Just to piss you off.
I don't have the energy for this. - You have accused me to be a homerobber.
(Jani:) Fuck believe, fuck, who you believe, satan.
Hey, if Joni told that to me ...
You heard me?
- I heard you.
I have fuck, in a fit of anger, fuck - might have said, when the drugs had disappeared.
But I did not mean it.
We settled this yesterday evening?
I did not know yesterday evening - that you had called me a homerobber.
I might have said in a fit of anger - when the drugs (töötit) disappeared.
But I don't mean that really.
I'll trust you
100%, fuck.
And still accuse me of being a homerobber.
Fuck, if that is your decision, we are out of here.
I have not called anyone a homerobber.
You have.
In a fit of anger
I might have said - but we settled this yesterday.
- I just heard it.
I've said it when fuck, - when I was equally furious as I going to be soon fuck.
I'm getting pissed of this as well.
- Do you think that I am not pissed off because of this?
You have accused me of being a homerobber.
I thought of you as a my mate.
I do not think you as homerobber fuck.
I really do not.
Well, why do you say that then?
- I might have said, in a fit of anger.
You can also in a fit of anger say - if you get angry at me, fuck I will kill that Raappana.
But in the end you do not mean it.
I've never said anything even close to that
- But you might. It is a metaphor.
In similar fashion
I might have said, -
That fuck, satan, Jupe, is a homerobber, perkele!
But still I haven't really meant it.
Okay.
- It was a misunderstanding.
Really if I hear that kind of matter ...
You do not really hear that. You are one of the three here that I trust on.
But if I once again hear...
I guarantee that you will lose rest of your fingers also.
Joni doesn't have anything to drink.
Where is Joni?
- At Vilsu's place.
Where does Vilsu live?
- There where the Kansankatu's Neste is (gas station).
I go and get it.
You ain't go going anywhere with a car
- I have a stolen car out there
You are not going anywhere with a car!
- I drove it here just a while ago.
Despite that!
- I am in good condition
You are not going to drive!
I'll go drive a car.
I go and do some fucking crazy job
Burglary to a storage of an industrial area fails when the cops arrive to the place
POLICE
Jani is being arrested for 3 days.
Three days of controversy.
Let's go somewhere for a cup of coffee.
- I lost the laptop.
I ain't giving as I only have that one
- Oh, fuck, you promised earlier.
I said that if you had not taken any,
I could offered you one.
But you already had taken one
- Yeah, but I was so sick yesterday.
I knew you that if I could keep a cool face
I would be out there in 3 days.
And I would even have
Subutex (teemuja) waiting for me.
That there is nothing to worry about here.
They can keep me arrested for 3 days and not a day longer
(Joonas:) And you denied everything?
- I admitted the attempt of theft.
However the limit of grand theft was passed, - when the guy got loose and got the goods with him
It was not completely useless thing as
I benefited about 1000€ from that.
(Joonas:) Good one.
On that station you have to be quiet always, when you are there
After the first hearing report -
I just said that: "Nothing to add nor to nothing to tell."
(Police) "You take that line?"
Jani: I take this line, fuck.
Today the examiner was changed.
Initially it was Jani Pääkkönen, who changed to Risto Turunen.
Turunen said: "Raappana.
Name the other guy now."
"Together it is done and together it is suffered"
It does not really work so, it is kinda tacit agreement
If someone gets caught, he will take the blame.
Now, it happened to be me.
Fuck, loyalty to the another guy
Here you keep your mouth shut.
Nothing much else about it
To control the Subutex problem, the addicts are offered a free sedative medication
(Jani:) Could you give water or something?
Or will these go with tea?
They are not needed, satan, to be put down with anything.
Just on top of the tongue to saviour the flavour.
(Joonas:) Nami Nami (Yummy yummy).
They go down like that if you haven't got them for some while
Ten pills in the mouth at the same time and suck.
Pam (Diapam, diazepam) is the best tasting medicine, that I know.
Yeah, if you start comparing the different tastes.
Well, no, Rivatril is better.
Fuck, it is number one.
Rivas are fucking good.
They will leave a taste which is a mixture of liquorice and ... mint.
Like you would have eaten a candy.
(Joonas:) I think the best are Tenox (temazepam) pills.
They taste like chalk tablets.
(Joonas:) No, they taste like sweets.
Just try Rivatril.
Riva is fucking good.
Yes, but there is the chalk flavor in Tenox which I do not like that much.
Oh, and then it gets all mushy in your mouth.
Pams dissolve nicely, like layer by layer.
All the time that kind of hard chunk.
At the department (hospital?) the people wonder - when I am so spaced out in the morning
- that what I am really taking.
I guess I'm a bit spaced out, when I take 40 mg of Tenox (temazepam) -
200 mg Sparine (promazine) and fuck what all else.
And I still cannot sleep.
So I guess I am a bit spaced out in the morning
Fuck, that annoyed me.
(Hurtsi:) Sparine makes you quite spaced out.
And when you're not sleeping - even though you are on such drugs, that even an apartment building should fall.
Eyes just are gaping open.
Sick, fuck.
(Joonas:) Why could not you sleep?
The withdrawal symptoms were so strong.
I was just unable to sleep.
Court house
Prosecutor have demanded for a prison sentence to Jani. He is waiting for the court solution.
Drunken driving and
Endangering traffic - a couple of thefts, drug crimes drug use crimes - and more of the shit.
Bit of everything.
If I would go to prison now,
I would go to Oulu.
In Pelso Prison you would have to work.
And if you do not, then cell door is closed.
Oulu: that is like a rest home.
A lot of go just to spend their winter there, - when you get shelter for the winter and regular food.
To go there to sit a bit.
(Jani:) The family is still the dearest to me.
It is pretty much the only sacred thing in my life.
Where other people can not reach.
And to where they have no business.
They do not know anything about that.
But it is irritating for my mom to be here, if... she has that kind of weigth over here, so it's not good.
Those older people have the habit - of blaming themselves for their children's mistakes.
I started stealing fucking young.
Now, I have become quite of master in it.
As a kid you only stole candy or something like that.
It was quite stupid back then
When you started to proper thefts, you did not think of the money - but the excitement and feeling what you will get from it.
Adrenaline rush of its own kind.
Useless to think about it anymore.
You have chosen your lifestyle
I just hope to get on a trip fast.
I just want to get out from here.
As fast as possible.
But I should get some money.
That is the problem.
(Alert:) Solution at Hall 2
What ...
(Joonas:) What is the situation there?
They sentenced me to jail.
(Joonas:) What?
- Sentence to jail.
District court sentences Jani to jail for a year.
The sentence will be put in order in summer.
- Whassup, whassup?
- Let's go and do (iv) drugs (töötit).
Ah drugs? Then I get the fuck out from this gang.
(Jani -> buddy:) Could you borrow me 50€?
At the moment I do not have a penny of money.
The money that I will receive will go all to those costs/charges.
This is running very well!
Well it is 2 gig PC.
What game is that?
- Night Fire, James Bond.
Fuck, the phone rings.
Fuck the debts are putting pressure on me.
I should quickly get 60€ from somewhere.
(Ahi:) How can I live - if the Social Welfare Office gives me 80€? I can't life with that
I do not start to live with my woman's money, that is a sure thing.
Oh, What will I do?
If I mean to live,
I then have to steal.
That is where it goes again that I am in prison again, thank to you.
(Jani:) You cannot blame anyone for that.
(Jani.) You wanted to get a break from every day life, in principle.
When you discovered your own thing, it was fucking awesome.
If you take Subutex, initially, very first times - you get into that kind of state of trance.
You can travel anywhere in your mind
And when daydreaming (lucid dreams), you see just what you want to see.
You are awake, but still you are like sleeping.
You dream while you are awake.
It is fucking awesome.
To your whole body, you get that kind of fucking good feeling.
I cannot, satan, explain.
It is just, fuck ...
But now, in the long run you are not noticing them anymore.
I was at once addicted to morphine as well.
When you took it for a couple of days, - then suddenly you had been taking it one week and two weeks.
Mind was all flat.
You weren't thinking anything at all.
It was, fuck, so evil a substance, that you will die to it.
At least to it if not to anything else
During the spring the use of drugs is increasing
Jani's debt. He tries to get some money.
The date of jail time is getting closer day by day.
Howdy ho!
The one syringe ...
Another thing is whether they are mine.
Hey, now I got a murky flashback.
Fuck, it is quite sticky. Yuck.
Party, party.
When you draw through the filter, so the chalk does not come there.
That is why today I draw my Subutex and other IV drugs through a filter.
Chalk is fucking bad for your blood vessels and your eyes.
You might start too to see kind of blurry.
Do you still get returns from it?
This is, fuck, a dream place.
Well, and still a second round.
That certainly all the shit has been used.
Hey, everybody!
It's a nice day today!
It's a shining day, and summer's coming.
Yeah.
You have a car, right?
- Yeah.
You have syringes+needles?
- No we have none.
Are you under Pams (sedatives)?
- No ...
I have stayed up whole the last night, taking amphetamine.
2.5 grams of amphetamine.
Took amphetamine all night long.
Now Mika went back over there.
(Joonas:) Oh, back to jail?
- Yeah.
(Joonas:) How long has he left?
He sits how long of his sentence?
Can you give me the phone,
I will call to Kymis?
Everyone owes me money.
- I soon start to beat up people.
- I do not owe you any money.
Then they, fuck, are crying to me:
"we do not get money from anywhere".
Now would be sitution when if we had the bazooka.
(Joonas:) What?
If we had the bazooka, - it would happen as we talked about yesterday.
... Pay me the debt in cash.
- Yes, but to me you could not.
Let's go to the drugstore.
Family package of syringes and 20 ...
(Joonas:) What? - Cups, which
I can use it with a filter to draw that Subutex.
No.
Is someone watching me?
Is someone watching me?
(Joonas:) Yes.
(Joonas:) Now.
Family package of syringes.
And 20 that kind of cups.
Or give just 10 in matter of fact.
Need syringes and needles?
- Yeah, five both of them.
To the whole family.
To father, mother and to three children.
And a small bag for them, thank you.
- 2.70€? Well then it is even.
Thank you. There you go. Need a receipt?
- Not needed, I go to use drugs.
Can you hold that? Fuck.
Calm driving style, we are not in a rush to anywhere.
(Joonas:) What?
- I said to Jani.
Jani perhaps should drive a bit more calmly.
We are seriously not in a rush to anywhere.
(Jani:) It is quieter?
(Joonas:) What?
Calmer than this? (Joonas:)
Just normally. (shout)
(Joonas:) Well that is what I meant.
I am driving, fuck, as usual.
Reflexes were in order, so the bitch survived.
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
You cannot end your use here.
All your friends use - and if you're a a while without drugs then someone will offer you.
And when you ask yourself, it is sure that you will not be offered.
The people here are so crooked/twisted that the fucking hell ...
You cannot distinguish friend from your enemy.
The next day he can be your enemy.
I guess you become like that as well as the others.
I do not know - whether or not my friends have gone, fuck, anywhere outside this city.
They are trying to get out from here, it is evident.
And a big part people have gone.
But they won't leave as I would leave.
They still will stay in Finland.
But I wouldn't be able even to stay in Finland.
Two weeks later Jani calls and says:
"Pack your stuff, we leave in an hour"
I have been waiting fucking long for this moment.
Yesterday I succeeded in sort of thing that I comment on here -
But that can I say that
But we can get going!
I am feeling so good, aren't you also??
Fucking awesome! Throw a couple of Pams to your face to relieve a bit your tension.
Or Rivatril. Take one Pam.
(Joonas:) I'll take couple of lines.
You fuck head.
Today we are in Finland.
Tomorrow we are in Paris.
Jani has managed to steal 5'000€ from the safe of a local supermarket. He plans to escape from Finland with this money.
Nothing can go wrong anymore.
(Joonas:) What were you afraid before?
That I would manage to get caught before we were able to go.
It takes as long as for us as want to spend on the road.
I will spend at least as long as we have the money.
And it won't be a problem to get more money.
If the money runs out, then we go to work.
I believe that I will stay on this trip.
I just have a backpack of clothes, as you can see.
Backbag full of clothes.
And in the wallet about
20'000 of old money (~3'600€)
About.
Now we are in Stockholm.
I've never been so far from my home
Fuck hello what a place!
This train station ... fuck ... Whooo.
This is the size of Rovaniemi.
That much I can say..
Let's go up there.
Things could not be any better, damn it!
We're are in Copenhagen tomorrow morning.
Walking at 07h inside to Christiania, fuck.
Marijuana smell starts to come on your face.
I will smoke a massive joint, unbelievable 'flowerpuffs'.
Bevar Christiania
= Save Christiania
Fuck, we are now in free area.
Everyone knows each other.
They are just saying hello to each other.
Have smoked already morning joints and go with smiles on their faces
This is a fucking awesome place! Fuck!
I want to live here.
Really.
Would they let me build my own little cottage?
Greetings to the police of Rovaniemi.
You fuck heads.
(Jani:) Not like I have anything in Rovaniemi any longer.
There is something like materialistic, but like ...
My family has split up.
Mother drinking.
I love them all, but I have my life.
We are just in
20 minutes in Paris.
Fuck, and an hour from that,
I will get Subutex.
I haven't taken any for four days.
But yes, it hasn't really mattered.
There has been enough of eyecandy and all other fun stuff.
But we are like fifteen minutes from Paris.
To control to severe heroine problem the state of France provides free Subutex treatment for the addicts
Some of them sell their Subutex to buy stronger drugs like heroine and crack
We have arrived to the source of illegally sold Subutex in North Europe
I want a room for two and TV.
Two people, one TV?
What does she say?
Not even a fuck comes out of this, let's take some other hotel.
I want to take Subutex!
Understand English?
I want a fix.
Pretty shitty, but it does not matter. Close the door.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Subutex is here.
8 mg packet, no VAT.
Pull out the cap.
Then the pump.
Then pretty generous.
Needle, out. Water.
Underpressure. Mixing a little.
Then loose a bit. Then
The needle to the head, then mix and consume.
And you are ready to enjoy!
The big bed is for me by the way.
Look at these!
Voila!
How long does it take, that it begins to work? - About 5 minutes.
But it started already to affect as immediately I started to feel good.
Well, what could be better?
We're in Paris.
There's so fucking much of Subutex.
Show them, to all the people.
And I am here watching television here.
Gradually begin to feel the effect.
And smoking a cigarette.
By the way I have also marijuana.
Flower. I will show you that too.
Woody, slash, flower, slash, weed.
Samba, samba, leeo.
Fuck, I have been waiting for this, fuck ... Let's say a .. lifetime.
Soon I take another shot.
Whooo.
We are now, fuck, like at the core.
This is like being in the United States.
Whooo.
I just went to the top of the Eiffel Tower restroom to take a shot of Subutex.
And I filmed everything on tape.
(Sings Elvis
Only You song.)
(Jani:) Yes i had my mouth wide open when we came here.
The amount of people and the fact that the streets, they are somehow ...
Like even this little street, full of life.
In Rovaniemi, during this time, fuck, would be dark and quiet.
Like you notice you start comparing everything to Rovaniemi.
That thought I would like to remove.
The memories of the shitty times in Rovaniemi are fading away to the passic scenes of the South
The use of drugs is increasing day by day
First class!
First class!
Window seats!
I can not help laughing, we had such a good luck.
With 100€ an awesome hotel room.
And seaside views.
Soon you cannot even see the shore.
Now is time for Subutex.
And for you, time for lines.
Since getting off from the ship, almost one disc of Subutex used.
(Joonas:) Here?
- Yes. 3.. 2 short of full  disc.
This is pretty much the coolest a place where I have visited.
Where are we now?
Well, I do not remember.
Cefalu.
- Yes.
In cases like that
Subu takes your memory.
To things like that it affects fucking much.
May go, fuck, like one and a half years, you use it all the time, then nothing.
And then after the 1.5 years you try to take for example a pause of 1 week.
You have been 4 days without, and you start thinking about all sorts of things.
Like what have you done during last year and half.
But you can not remember.
Everything is all a fog to me.
I am so pissed off now, that I've been using here as well.
And a lot more for example that I used in Rovaniemi.
Tolerance is fucking high.
If I now want to quit - half a Subu won't ease a lot.
And I did not look for anything other than this trip itself...
Which is just fucking cool.
Actually those Subus could have been dropped also.
I could have used all the money just for this trip.
Just to buy one box.
Fuck, would have managed with it the amount you would have wanted to manage  - and stopped the drug use during this journey.
That would have emphasized the message.
There is more in the world than just to take drugs, fuck.
Itching in the nose.
Hey, I start doing lines now.
(Joonas:) Well?
- Yeah. Now starts.
Do you know what this
Raappana (his lastname) is doing now?
Throws syringes a side and will never use them ever again.
Radical cecision but this is how it is ...
(Joonas:) You really mean so?
Unusable!
I stopped injecting to veins.
The last traces were now left of this trip.
I've taken the last IV drug dose here at the shores of the Sicilian sea.
(Jani:) In addition to traveling -
I have seen myself living right in Spain.
I go to Spain,
I have an own house, a wife, - a bit of field (for agriculture).
I would be working, the wife would be maybe at home. A couple of children. That kind of things.
I 'm already up here, - so I would say that
50% of the dream is true already.
Uijui, I am tempted for one shot of Subu.
Weird feeling.
Doesn't feel like sniffing any lines, as it is stinging fucking weirdly.
Is not it ...
Yes, I still prefer to be without.
Fuck, if I could decide,
I would ban Subutex.
Or the abuse of Subutex.
Let's put it this way.
Or well.. I don't know.
So that no one would take them first.
Except some heroine addicts, who really need it - just so that they can normalize their lives.
But, like for myself
I do not recommend it.
I will quit.
I won't use it anymore, fuck.
It is as fucking simple as that.
Or not that simple. it is rather complex, but still I will do it and quit.
(Joonas:) Why do you want to quit? - Fuck, I do not know, fuck.
It might improve my own quality of life.
Look, what a fucking advertisement pub.
Club for the elderly, fuck, that kind.
Meant for those with career.
Look at the ads - and drink a couple of drinks. Fuck,
Just put more Gucci on you.
Fucking weirdos, satan.
What the fuck! (Mitä vittua?)
Now change the side, fuck!
Hell no..
That is some fucking nudist.
In Rovaniemi, like that Maire ...
She often, satan, home-brewed beer mug in hand, - naked at Samppari, but
Rovaniemi is quite ...
But fuck at night in Rome fuck we run across satan fuck some fucking nudist fuck nudist ...
Whooo, you can just laugh about it.
While wandering in the streets of Rome
I receive a text message to my phone:
"Fuck tell that Jani to contact me or I bash your appartment to pieces with an axe."
This is Jani.
Hello, Hello.
You were trying to reach me.
You were trying to reach me.
I haven't just been able to call you.
So. Haven't the money or other.
What else is happening there?
Who took it?
Who took the car?
I knew that I shouldn't have called, satan, at all.
Would be easier to be ignorant.
Not to care what happens elsewhere.
And you, fuck, even do not care.
That is why I paid all my debts, everything - so that here I would not have to stress about it, - that I have debt collectors after me and other shit.
So now some fucking Kuoksa ...
Oh, fuck I am irritated now!
That was the last option
To make that call, fuck.
If the cops are listening to
Pia's phone -
Now they know that I am in Italy.
Yeah, right, and now I have to be accountable to Kuoksa - for such a car, that I do not even have anymore.
I am not excited.
Not at all, fuck, not at all.
They think that they can somehow control me - but fuck, no fucking way.
Fucking no way.
There, satan, damn and let 'em get me here.
This is annoying in a way that, - that if you ever been involved in something - that would be kind the rest of your life, fuck.
Due to confusing chain of events in Rovaniemi,
Jani is again in debts and his friend has been threatened
But I guess he realizes that if I had been the snitch, -
I would have never got this far.
But that it that what he considers to be what ...
It is a different matter.
The way, how these fingers went, is a different matter.
I myself offered my fingers to them.
As a compensation.
So that is the difference.
In my opinion it is big but.
I was, like, hit me, if it makes you feel any better.
I do not know.
We arrive to Spain
Today, I haven't taken a single dose of drugs.
Oh, bloody hell, I was boiling this morning.
I almost lost my nerves and ultimately
I lost my nerves.
(Joonas:) Well, why was that? - Started to be really pissed, as there was no drugs.
Really pissed off.
Fuck
(Jani:) Then when I got an own, fuck, small house and, fuck, my own field - and so on ... that would be the center of my world.
We are now on the African side, in a Spanish town.
And there it is now.
This is the high quality shit.
From there when you smoke a puff,
I will say ...
Check it out now. Fuck, I say, that hello, hello, hello!
We have smack, smack, smack ...
'Horse' (polle, slang term for heroine).
(Joonas:) So why do you want to try?
Fuck, Wonder why?
(Joonas:) Huh?
- I do not know, just to try it.
(Joonas:) I mean why? - I guess want to try heroine.
(Joonas:) But why? - I do not know. I want the feeling (notkut).
(Jani:) It's hard to change way of life or lifestyle.
To change it completely.
It does not happen overnight.
You have to want it yourself, more than anything else.
And not, fuck, fear and run away.
For that reason many good things have been ruined.
I will build a small cottage for myself somewhere over to the green fields.
Field (agricultural) behind it.
And in front of it that kind of wooden fence.
Behind of it that kind
2m high stone fence.
I have a wife, and - not that much money, so quite a modest life, but - everyone are happy - and I go some little job - five days a week.
That's how I see my self.
I would then no longer exist,
I would be someone else.
Is there a festival today?
I don't think so. And yet, every year for 27 years...
...she comes on this day, to feed the poor.
How could Bharati possibly forget!
Those were momentous times.
Her father Ramnath
Rai was the state's...
...Chief Minister for 14 years...
...but her generation's heady romance with leftism...
...had turned Bharati into a rebel.
Together with her charismatic mentor...
...the idealistic Bhaskar Sanyal, she stormed her father's public rally.
Indian politics was going through a historic churning... but Ramnath Rai was blissfully complacent.
Only his astute political advisor and...
Bharati's foster-brother, Brij
Gopal had sensed the turning winds.
Comrade Bhaskar will try to draw you into an argument.
Do not fall into his trap.
I've been a politician for 20 years, Brij Gopal.
I'm not a fool.
Mr. Rai, we have no intention of disturbing your rally.
But, if you permit me,
I'd like to ask you... a few questions on behalf of the people.
Hey! Hey! Stop him!
Let him come.
The public on whose behalf, he wants to raise questions... already knows the answers to them.
And those who have been enticed by his red flag... should also be aware of
Ramnath Rai's political sacrifices.
The issue isn't about the colour of the flag, Mr. Rai.
Poverty, hunger and unemployment do not discriminate...
...on the basis of colour.
These people are besieged by their own empty stomachs, Mr. Rai.
Offer them two slices of bread... make a couple of sweet promises... and they will pick up a flag of any colour!
What kind of poverty is this, friends... which, in spite of their schemes funded by millions...
...billions of rupees... just refuses to go away!
So as of this moment...!
- Sir will leave now.
...we absolve you of any worry about our poverty
Enough is enough!
Come on, uncle.
Switch the mikes off.
As soon as the ballot is cast, you throttle democracy.
Switch the mikes off!
Don't be under any illusion that...
Have you no shame at all!
Conspiring against your own father!
Do you know that your revered leader is not worth even a penny!
What I do know is that for you people's worth is measured...
...only with money.
Shut up!
What?
There is no Comrade Bharati here.
Don't ever call here again!
Sir?
What are you doing?
Cooking khichdi...
Will you have some?
- Here, allow me...
- If you cook this...
Oh, come on... Just let me...
It's going to rain.
Let me drop you home.
- Are you crazy? -
It's the first rain, sir.
I love the rain.
Why don't you join me?
Don't be childish... you'll catch cold.
Come on. Get inside.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
You're crazy! You'll catch a cold...
Nothing will happen to me...
Bharati...
I take full responsibility for what happened.
You devoted yourself completely to me.
But, I turned out to be weak... and ended up betraying your trust.
What is done is done.
But, I will never be free of this guilt.
I'm going... leaving everything... and everyone.
I have obviously failed.
My penance awaits me.
Bhaskar.
Get it here, hurry up...
Where's my baby?
Mr. Brij Gopal took him away.
I just wanted to see him once...
Brij Gopal convinced the grieving Bharati into...
...a marriage with Chandra Pratap.
Of course, it helped that he was the younger brother of Bhanu Pratap... the aggressive leader of the fast-rising Rashtrawadi Party.
No one realised that Brij Gopal had killed three birds with one stone.
Besides securing Bharati's future... he also got Ramnath Rai's doddering party a strong alliance.
And of course, Bhanu
Pratap's Rashtrawadi Party... harvested a windfall of much-needed election funds.
Wherever he is, he must be okay.
Just send him your blessings.
O Holy mother Ganga... please look after my son... wherever he may be.
- Sooraj! Sooraj!
- Sooraj! Sooraj!
Where are you going?
Sooraj is playing a kabaddi match.
First give me something to eat.
I have to go to the airport.
Who's coming?
The boss' younger son, Samar.
- Is it?
He is coming from the US, for the big boss' birthday.
Sooraj is like the sun!
The new beacon of hope for...
...Dalits and the lower castes.
We need bright and strong young leaders like him...
...who will take us forward.
Hey!
Huh?
Where's the car?
Hey!
Get away! Move!
Have you lost it or what?
What if something happened to the car?
He's our racing champion... faster than the wind!
Champion, my foot!
The car's a mess!
Clean it now!
It's time for the flight. Samar is returning from the US today.
I don't wash rich people's cars.
They are our masters, son.
Our livelihood depends on them.
I am my own master, father.
And the truth is, their livelihood depends on us.
It's impossible to argue with you!
Stop haranguing my son, will you?
- I'll clean it. -
Give it to me, mother.
This is for you. It's time you got a new watch.
You never forget, young master.
Just because I live far away, how can I forget you people!
We miss you, too.
It's wonderful that you've come in time for the Diwali festival.
Nothing like that.
I'm here only for
Uncle Bhanu's birthday.
My thesis is due next week.
This year too... you won't be here for Diwali.
Who's that driving like a maniac?
Appears to be Indu...
Couldn't you have waited for me?
And how was I to know that you were...
You should know!
Understood?
D'you know...
I was driving at 200 kmph to reach you!
Who on earth gave you a license?
License to... drive or... to kiss you?
You're insane!
You're mad.
So I am.
Mad about you!
I missed you.
"I am expecting some happy news too."
"Yes, it is."
"Some things make you cry...
...some times it is like a story."
"Yes, it is."
There you are!
- Hello aunty! - Hello.
Here's your parcel
- safe and sound.
I'm off to the salon.
See you in the evening... at Uncle Bhanu's party.
This girl is a tornado!
In the last 30 years...
Bhanu and Chandra Pratap's
Rashtrawadi party had captured...
...power thrice in the state.
Bhanu Pratap's public charisma and Chandra Pratap's...
...astute tactical skills... had served them well indeed.
When their party couldn't win the last election... they installed Ramnath Rai's party in the government... by supporting it from outside.
Now, when they asked him to,
Ramnath Rai was reluctant to resign.
Bhanu Pratap's son Veerendra knew exactly how to handle such problems.
All the dozen legislators of his party are in the bus.
Take them to the guest house and feed them.
Welcome, grandpa!
Grandpa, I've hijacked your entire party.
You're a general without an army!
What's the use of tilting at windmills now?
Veerendra, show some respect.
Well... let him respectfully retire then!
Father-in-law, come.
Let's go inside and talk.
It's an outrage the way you are... trying to topple my government!
Only with your blessings, of course.
Look here... this time my party bosses will insist on 100 seats.
You can't score even 10 seats...
Aiming for a century!
Keep your national party in Delhi. Here we...
Veeru, enough.
Come, father-in-law.
You never call me!
It's only through your Uncle
Brij that I get news of you.
Mother, it's the time difference between here and America.
Uncle Brij is a nocturnal bird.
It's easier to talk with him.
Hey!
Brother!
Already pouncing on mom's parathas!
You've become thin! Hasn't he, mom?
Let him be... Come, eat.
No, I've to go to the Party HQ.
I just came to see him.
While Veerendra believed himself to be the heir...
...to the political throne...
Prithvi was jockeying for the same position.
Hence, it was imperative that his supporters get...
...nominated for these elections.
Create so much publicity that the party is forced to nominate them.
We'll fight to get that.
We'll create a chaos in the party high court.
We'll show them your power, Prithvi.
Great!
Let me go!
They're trying to stop me!
I told them I had to talk to you.
We're in a meeting. Please wait.
So... that's it then.
Yes, sir.
Move then. It's time for the party.
Okay, sir.
Jagat... call for my car, too.
- Okay, sir.
You seem to have forgotten me, sir.
There's going to be a fresh election, I hear.
Won't you let a woman volunteer contest?
I can win, sir. Just let...
Let me contest from Sitapur.
I'll definitely win.
I grew up there.
I was the students' union president.
Sir, please don't forget me this time.
The Sitapur ticket...
That's the bloody problem with politics.
Everyone treats it like public transport.
Just flag it down... and mount it!
I've worked very hard, sir.
And will continue to do so.
Let me.
You handled grandpa Rai like a seasoned politician.
Then, why don't you reward your son?
Everything belongs to him anyway.
Father, let me select the election candidates.
That's your uncle's prerogative.
That's why Prithvi...
But I won't let it go on like this.
So glad you're here.
It's your birthday, Uncle.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hello.
- How are you? - Hello.
Mr. Sakseria...
Hello, uncle.
Bless you.
- Hello.
Just got his tax problems sorted out by the Chief Minister.
You never forget, Rajkumar...
- and now you'll say... -
Happy Birthday to you, sir.
Just saying happy birthday won't do.
Always at your service.
Have I ever disappointed you?
Please be seated... quiet...
After winning three elections... when the electorate rejected us... in the last election... we accepted their decision with humility.
And we helped...
Mr. Ramnath Rai form a coalition government... supporting it from outside.
But, as you know... in the last 18 months... this government has revealed it's true face.
Corruption has reached its zenith... and the people are in agony.
We can't bear to see the common man's pain any longer.
So, we have decided... to withdraw our support for Mr.
Rai's coalition government.
Long live Rashtrawadi!
The people know... that we aren't responsible... for this political turmoil.
Father!
- Brother! - Father! - Brother!
Call the hospital! Emergency...
Get the car!
Hello.
Hello.
Just as I handed in the resignation, I heard.
- At least, if I hadn't resigned...
- Father-in-law...
...please!
Increase the pressure.
Mr. Brij Gopal...
Blood pressure.
- Diastolic 140.
I came from Benaras only to see you... and here I hear about this crisis.
It's serious, Uncle...
I'll see.
Blood pressure.
While the heart has been revived... there's no movement in the body.
So, is he paralysed?
We'll have to wait for the ECG reports for that.
The government has fallen and fresh elections are certain.
But the leader of the state's largest political party... is fighting for his life.
- Without party president Bhanu Pratap...
- what does the future hold for the Rashtrawadi Party?
- State Hospital.
Aditi Priya. Star News.
Go ahead.
Before they try to pull a fast one... we should take control of the party.
We support you.
I'll see you all at the party office.
Yes, Mr. Bawal.
Hello?
What?
Under no circumstances should that meeting happen.
Book the entire
Intercontinental Hotel.
Got it?
Listen... round up every party member and take them to the hotel.
These impatient youngsters will destroy everything.
Now, more than ever, the party needs your guidance.
Turn around. Father has regained consciousness.
As soon as he became conscious, he called for everybody.
Chandu...
Yes, brother...
- The...
In these circumstances, the party...
Brother, please, we'll talk later...
- What? - take charge of... the party... as it's working president.
What's the need for this, father?
You... and Prithvi... will both be general secretaries.
Uncle!
Come on...
What have you done, father!
Take it back! Please...
This is a humiliation for me...
At least, make me the joint working president...
Veerendra... you're family! You should look beyond such things.
Everything will finish, then...
Father...
Father!
Father!
Go back... back to America...
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
Hi!
I just saw it on the Net.
How's your uncle now?
Looks bad, Sarah.
It's happened at such a critical time...
I'm sure he'll get better soon.
Listen, I'm coming to New
York to meet you at the airport.
You don't have to do that.
I want to.
This weekend I want you just to myself... before you get consumed by your presentation!
Love you.
- Come soon.
Miss you.
I want us to discuss each candidate thoroughly.
I have already made the list. Just approve it!
Veerendra, our party follows a democratic process.
Each and every recommendation is discussed.
Will you be kind enough to tell us, which democratic process... was followed to make you the working president?
Uncle... the very president by whose grace... you're adorning that chair... has seen this list.
Then, surely you have his approval in writing.
This list will prevail!
Discuss all you want.
How come you've put your name against Madhopur?
Mr. Bhanu Pratap has always contested from Madhopur.
And in father's absence, the seat is rightfully...
No claim for Madhopur will be entertained.
It is reserved for the party president.
And currently, that is Chandra Pratap.
Only the party president should contest from Madhopur.
Have you even fought a municipal election... that you're staking your claim to Madhopur?!
I will never let your dream come true...
Honourable Working President!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
He's here! The leader is here!
He's come to Azad Nagar.
We all welcome him here.
The people of Azad Nagar whole heartedly welcome the leader.
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
Everyone knows that...
30 years ago... our party reclaimed this land from the government and their agents... and established Azad Nagar!
My heart beats for... the poor and the lower castes...
Who is this?
Our driver's son
- Sooraj.
Also a kabaddi champion.
This isn't a dance party.
Tell them to stop.
I want that the candidate for Azad Nagar... should be educated, able and... from amongst you.
Sooraj is our leader!
Sooraj is our leader!
Yeah... okay... okay...
The Rashtrawadi Party candidate for Azad Nagar will be...
Jeevan Kumar!
Jeevan Kumar may belong to our caste... but that doesn't necessarily make him one of us.
He knows nothing about Azad Nagar.
He's never set foot in our dirty lanes... and nor will he, once the elections are over.
Excuse me?
Mr. General Secretary... our candidate will be one of us!
Not an outsider.
This isn't a kabaddi match.
I am speaking of the
Legislative Assembly election.
And the Rashtrawadi candidate will definitely be...
Jeevan Kumar.
- We protest!
- We don't want outsiders!
- We protest!
We don't want outsiders!
Long live Sooraj!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Try to understand.
You're not aware that
Jeevan Kumar's grandfather... was a minister in the Central government.
So?
That makes it his birthright, does it?
What does he know about us?!
Educated abroad... owns mansions... he owns four Mercedes cars of the kind that you chauffeur, dad!
He wouldn't last a day here!
How is he one of us!
Enough is enough!
It's do or die this time.
What is it that you people want?
Whose job is it to select the candidate - yours or the party's?
We'll choose our own candidate!
What?
You'll rebel against the party?
Without the party, you won't garner five votes.
Instead, you'll end up dividing the lower caste votes.
So what do you suggest?
That we continue to suck up... to these politicians... while they plant their leaders on us?
It isn't like that, son.
The party cares for us.
They treat us like equals.
Look, Samar came just for a day... but he got me a new watch.
- A watch? - Yes.
So that you report to work on time.
That's the problem with you guys.
You've barely learnt to walk, but want to fly!
You guys are history!
We generate the power.
Then why should we hand them the switch?
From now on, no outside candidates allowed in Azad Nagar!
- Who Is our leader?
- Sooraj, Sooraj.
- Victory to Sooraj!
- Long live Sooraj!
Do you know me?
You're a big man.
How is a nobody like me supposed to know you, Mr. Babulal?
I like your attitude.
But, these speeches and stunts will get you nowhere.
Even if you win the election as an independent... big deal!
Instead the party will punish Azad Nagar for its defeat.
If you really want to change anything, join the party... and fight as its candidate.
Come on!
Get down.
You know, I'm going to contest the elections this time.
And you'll see, I'll become the youngest woman minister ever.
- Really? - Of course!
And when you come the next time...
I'll come to receive you in a car with a flashing red light.
- Wow!
Such a grand lunch for one measly vote of mine?
For your vote?!
Can't you be a little romantic?
- With you? - No... with this waiter!
Look here, don't ruin my mood.
I want to have a serious chat.
That's very serious.
Stop, stop!
Not just like that.
First propose.
Okay...
Let's drink to your flashing red light.
- Red light? - Yes.
When you become a minister... you will have a car with a flashing red light, won't you?
Samar!
When are we getting married?
Why do you look so shocked?
Marriage...
I...
I didn't quite understand.
You'll understand alright when the priest recites the vows... and I make you take 17 rounds of the sacred fire...
Stop, stop!
Indu...
I know how you feel about me.
But my feelings aren't the same for you, Indu.
I mean, you're an amazing girl.
So beautiful... full of life... honest... just lovely, but...
You can't love me!
Do you know this is the first time you've complimented me?
Beautiful, amazing... full of life...
You can say all this but... you can't utter three words...
I love you.
And here I am... madly in love with you... since childhood.
I'm sorry.
I won't be able to forgive myself.
Have you never loved me?
We're just too different, Indu.
Long live Rashtrawadi!
Long live Rashtrawadi!
I have a simple question for the Working President:
On what basis were the candidates chosen?
Answer this first: On what basis... did you announce your name from the Madhopur seat?
Prithvi Pratap.
Veerendra... you're well aware that the core committee discusses... every candidature before taking any decision.
I want to say something.
You?
What the hell are you doing here?
My name is Sooraj.
I'm from Azad Nagar.
Yeah... yeah... The kabaddi champ!
- But, what Are you doing here?
I want a ticket to contest the election.
Really now!
We're running a charity fete here!
You want a ticket, do you?
Didn't you hear me... when you were busy dancing around?
Our party's candidate for
Azad Nagar is Jeevan Kumar.
Got that?
Get out now!
Security!
I had heard you.
But perhaps, you could neither hear nor see that... the people of Azad Nagar rejected your candidate instantly.
I'm the leader of the lower castes... and they will support only me.
What did you say!
Who made you our leader?
We sweated blood for the party... but suddenly you become the leader, is it?
Everyone knows where... the fruits of your sweat are hidden.
We'll make you account for that too one day!
For now, I only want a ticket to contest from Azad Nagar.
You'll take us to task, will you?
I'll show you.
Son, what are you doing!
Is this the way to speak here?
Please, Sirs... I apologise on his behalf.
- Come... - Father, please...
Keep quiet now. Enough!
- Get him out of here!
- Throw him out!
Take him away.
- He thinks He can contest an election.
Learn to drive instead of dreaming of leadership.
Security!
- Come on.
He isn't going anywhere!
- He stays here. - here? Meaning?
It's clear, Prithviraj.
Sooraj happens to be a member of the core committee.
- No one can throw him out.
- What is this nonsense!
Who made him a member?
I did.
The secretary of the backward and minority cell.
- But, Mr. Veerendra... -
Please read the constitution.
As General Secretary,
I have the right to... nominate three members.
Excuse me.
Come, Sooraj.
Please place a chair for him beside mine.
Please sit.
Respected Mr. Working President... please caution Mr.
Prithviraj that... without the approval of the core committee... he shouldn't go around announcing candidates.
And I propose... that instead of Jeevan Kumar... the party candidate from Azad Nagar... should be Sooraj Kumar.
Adjourned the meeting for now.
The new proposals will have to be included in the agenda.
Hence, this meeting is adjourned until further notice.
Take this.
I'm feeling handicapped without Bhanu.
It's becoming very hard to rein in Veerendra.
He staked his claim to
Madhopur again today.
So? Let him contest.
C'mon, Uncle... You know that Madhopur is reserved...
...for the party president.
If he wins from there, he'll create havoc.
He can even lose.
Are you aware that it is our safest seat?
Even if we nominate a dog from there, it will win.
Brother, if the party can make you win the election... it can also make sure you lose.
Sure. But losing Madhopur isn't good for the party.
Precisely!
If he loses from there, it'll finish his political career.
Moreover, you'll get sympathy for giving up the seat.
That makes sense.
But your problem isn't Veerendra.
It is Sooraj!
He has created a serious situation.
If we give him Azad Nagar, it boosts Veerendra's position.
But, if we don't, we antagonise the lower castes.
I don't know what to do.
We'll talk in one voice.
- Sooraj, Mr. Brij Gopal is here.
Brij Gopal?
How are you all?
Hello.
- Okay, fine.
Sir!
Been a while since I had a cup of your tea.
How nice! Mr. Batukeshwar, you too?
Looks like all the Dalits are here!
Looks like a massive convention.
Since elections are upon us... we need to look at all possibilities.
Of course, of course.
After all, this is the age of the youth.
Please sit...
No matter what, we will never leave the party.
The party is yours anyway.
As far as elections go, you're right.
But, what about after that?
I know that you people are upset about...
...the selection of your candidate.
We have decided... that not just for Azad Nagar, but every lower caste area... we only want local candidates.
That is up to the party.
Now that you're in the core committee... raise this issue there.
For now, the party president has sent me to inform you that... the candidate for Azad
Nagar will be from among you.
God bless you, Mr. Brij Gopal.
As long as you are in the party... there will be no injustice.
Bless you, Sir... for encouraging a poor man's son.
Sooraj will not disappoint you.
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
The party has decided that the candidate from Azad Nagar... will be the party's loyal supporter, and your beloved...
Ram Charittar!
Democracy is alive and well in our party.
Sir, this is a mistake.
The candidate is not me.
It's my son, Sooraj.
Ram Charittar, every father wants his son to move ahead.
But he is still inexperienced.
And is there anyone here who is... more honest and hardworking than you?
Does anyone have an objection, friends?
Tell me, Sooraj... Do you object to your father's candidature?
Why don't you people say something?
Sir... how can I be a candidate?
I'm a mere servant of your family.
Now, you are a servant of the people.
Sir, please...
How can I stand for the election...
I can't do this.
The decision to nominate my father was the right one.
In politics, there are no right or wrong decisions.
Their purpose is merely to achieve a desired result.
Whatever that might be.
I shall remember that.
Let's go.
I'm going to Beesanpur temple... to pray for your nomination.
But, why today?
Because it's your day off.
Father's on a long vacation now.
He will no longer be a chauffeur.
What?!
I have decided.
You're not going to serve that family.
Take the car to Beesanpur.
We'll take the bus, son.
The first list of candidates.
- Hello, sir.
You proposed 55 names. Of those, he cleared only 12!
And, my request for funds?
He refused to clear them.
He will pay for this!
Bad times are here.
We conducted a survey in every district.
78% of the voters... connect with Chandra Pratap.
He is the face of our party.
Chief Minister designate!
Why not?
The party will decide that. Not you!
- Shut up. - No, you be quiet!
This is the party office, not your home.
Respect the decorum of this office.
So, you'll teach me decorum, will you?
Mr. Backward and
Minority Cell Secretary...
The party has decided.
He will be the Chief Minister!
If you have a problem with that...
The public recognises only one face... only one voice... that of Bhanu Pratap.
And you all know who... his rightful successor is.
The party should not fail to recognise that.
Veerendra... your father has himself approved of this decision.
When did father decide this?
This morning.
Every decision of this party is democratic. You know that!
Of course!
I know... who is behind all this.
How only 12 of my 55 candidates are approved.
How all my demands for funds are consistently denied.
Mr. Working President... this decision is not good for the party.
The people will reject it!
Young man, now I call the shots here.
Learn to accept that fact.
Better fall in line or fall by the wayside.
Fall in line?!
Wow, Mr. Working President!
Enough, Veerendra Pratap!
Final warning.
The same constitution that gives you the right... to appoint him a member... also grants me the right... to suspend you from the party.
Sir...
Veerendra is the general secretary of the party.
How can you...
So now, you'll interfere, will you?
I've been watching... the kind of games that some people are playing.
Looks like some players will have to be... rested during this election tournament.
Fall in line!
Now I have to stand in line, eh?
All my life, I doled out alms... now I have to stand in line and beg?!
My father built this party... and he is trying to kick me out of it?
I'll break it!
I will break this party... and form a new one.
Do not make that mistake.
That is what they want.
This party is yours.
They must leave, not you!
How will you throw them out?
How?
See this poster?
This man will become the Chief Minister!
I'll change the poster.
- Mr. Chandra Pratap Is here.
You're off already, son?
Yes, it is okay, father.
Why are you so concerned?
As if you've had any time for him!
You know how things have been...
There's time still.
Put Samar's luggage in my car. - Okay, sir.
- I'll drop him. - You?
Papa, you don't have to do this.
Come.
This time I really didn't get to see you properly.
Everything okay there?
Your PhD?
I'm done with the research.
The presentation is next week.
- Next week? - Yes, papa.
I'm done with my PhD.
Fantastic!
So, now we'll be calling you Dr. Samar Pratap!
Tell me the title of your thesis again. I always seem to forget...
The Sub-textual Emotional Violence of 19th Century Victorian Poetry.
Wonderful!
Sounds so impressive.
What next?
There's an offer to teach.
So you aren't coming back?
Well... I suppose that's fine too.
You'll be the first teacher in our family.
Papa, please... you should go now.
This security thing is too much.
I'll go.
- Let me see you in...
- No papa. Please...
You're blocking the traffic also.
Okay, son.
Come, give me a hug.
God knows when I'll see you again.
These elections...
Father...
Love you, son.
What is it, Babulal?
Mr. Bhanu's condition has suddenly worsened.
We're going to the hospital.
Have the doctor call me.
Okay.
Take me to the hospital!
"My beloved isn"t speaking to me."
"Doors of the heart."
What were you thinking?
I'm not some tragedy queen.
I'll abduct you from across the universe, if that's what it takes.
Really?
New profession?
I can't live without you.
I love you.
Indu, I've to go.
Take care.
Find out what's going on!
- Security, come in.
Get them to move.
Get them to move.
Clear the road...
Another shocking setback to the state's most powerful family.
According to initial reports...
The working president of the Rashtrawadi party...
- Mr. Chandra Pratap...
- was fatally attacked in a shocking incident.
Reports state that this attack... took place on Ratanpur road on the way to the city from the airport.
Mr. Chandra Pratap was in his car when the attack took place.
It seems that he was shot.
As a result of the incident traffic is blocked for miles.
Mr. Brij Gopal for you...
Uncle! How's papa?
They've taken him to the hospital.
I'll pick you up at the airport.
Get the cars!
That will take time,
I'll come by cab...
Just do as I say!
Those who have done this, know that you're at the airport.
You just stay there!
Disconnect the cable TV...
Security on red alert.
My sister shouldn't know of this.
- Okay.
Stop all cars outside the gate!
Let's go.
- Okay, sir.
Where the hell was the security?
What about the police?
It's a single bullet in the throat.
He's very critical.
Has lost a lot of blood.
We're trying to stop it.
Where is the hospital security?
I have no idea, sir.
- Doctor!
- Call the police chief!
You guys, secure this area from all sides.
Get more people.
Move it!
- What happened? -
He's not answering!
Call his deputy then.
Okay, sir.
- Where the hell is papa's security!
Who sent this son of a bitch!
Check their firearm licenses.
Back from the whorehouse, Sharma?
Man the gates!
We don't need cops here.
You heard what I said?
Out!
Let the police do it's job, Mr. Prithviraj... or else...
- Or else?
What will you do?
Why have you come now anyway?
Arrest the bastard!
Drag him away!
Arrest me, will you?
You bloody pimp!
You scoundrel!
Let go! I'll chop you into pieces.
You dare to arrest me, you beggar!
What are you doing?
Now do you remember your duty?
Sir, you can't do this! - B negative blood - we just don't have any!
Come on, arrest me!
- What are you doing?
Come on, arrest me!
Sir, you cannot do this!
Back off!
I can do anything.
Arrest him too!
You will pay for this!!
You hit my brother!
I'll chop you into pieces.
Get up!
- SP Sharma!
Apologise to him.
- You're dead!
I'll kill you.
Sorry.
Hey, you!
Detractors.
Scissors, fast.
Pass the forceps.
Please bring me a glass of water.
Heart rate?
Pass the mop... mop.
Scissors...
Chandu...
I've asked for a CBI inquiry.
The culprit won't get away!
Given these circumstances, I'll have to take charge of the party.
Father...
I need your approval.
Down with police autocracy!
Down with police autocracy!
Free Prithvi!
If the killer isn't caught, we'll burn the city down!
Our people are on the job too.
How is mom?
She's putting up a brave front, but from within she...
SP Sharma himself filed the report.
He's charged you under sections 353, 337 and 307.
But you'll get bail.
I've stated in my report...
Mr. Prithvi had no weapons.
That's my only regret.
- If I had a gun I would've...
- Prithvi!
Uncle.
No one touches SP Sharma.
I'll deal with him myself.
You've made all my dreams come true, friend.
You changed the poster!
I'm screwed, sir.
Now, they believe I was involved even in your uncle's murder.
If he gets bail... he'll kill me.
You didn't charge him appropriately.
You should've used sections 376 and 341.
He would've been in your custody.
Section 376?
- That's a rape charge. - Correct.
So tell me... where should we lodge the rape complaint?
Isn't she...
A totally genuine case, SP.
Prithvi promised to make her a candidate... and for three years he sexually exploited her.
It's a serious charge.
What if she backs out?
Sir...
I've been through hell.
Finally, I'm in safe hands now.
I will get an election ticket here.
There's no question of backing out.
- There seems to be No end to the misery of the Rashtrawadi Party.
In a sensational twist...
Prithviraj, who has already been charged for assaulting...
...a police officer, has now been accused of raping a party worker.
Denied bail, he's been remanded to police custody for 15 days.
I deny every charge levelled against Prithvi.
We shall approach the high court for his bail.
Our supreme leader, Bhanu Pratap is still fighting for his life.
First Chandra Pratap, and now this.
- We Are being attacked repeatedly.
- And on the pretext of investigating, the inept...
...government Is doing nothing.
- But the people demand answers.
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
- Victory to Veerendra Pratap!
You want me to sign this?
Have you lost it?
- You don't have a choice. - Okay.
Go home and take care of mom.
I can deal with these people.
But that's only if you get out.
Your bail application was denied.
Since it is a rape charge... women's organisations and the media are up in arms.
But, how will signing this help?
Leave that to me, brother.
Trust me.
I'll get you out of here.
They'll pay for this heavily.
Everyone of them!
I've made a big mistake, Sir.
Am appealing to your kindness.
I am younger than you... so deserve forgiveness.
Sorry.
Hey Sharma!
Have you gone mad?
That's my brother, my uncle.
Come, Uncle Brij.
I don't why all this is happening.
Looks like someone cast an evil eye on us.
I'm sorry that you're having to face this.
But don't you worry.
I will take care of everything.
The party... as well as the family.
That's Sooraj... he's like family.
How is Aunt? Please sit.
I'm taking mom to New York.
The right decision. Absolutely!
Don't worry about Prithvi.
I'll move heaven and earth to get him bail.
Without him this election... - My brother won't contest the election.
I'm taking him along too.
He's resigned from the party post.
He won't return from New York.
- You mean... he's never coming back? - Never!
The party is all yours.
Just one condition.
All charges against him should be dropped.
Can be done.
I'll manage the investigation report.
One more thing.
After three days is his court hearing.
Until then, if he... or any member of my family... is hurt in a mishap, of any kind...
I'll call this deal off.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Martyr's day, indeed!
What a farce!
Master...
Master...
Master...
All this pomp... decorations... huge photographs...
What was the need for all this?
Oh?
Bothering you, is it?
If you wish, we can put up yours too.
Seems the cops didn't look after you well enough.
Brother, please... not now.
Enough of this circus, Samar.
Your boat has capsized.
Time to exit the scene now... for your own good.
What is good for us, and what isn't... will be our decision now, Veeru.
And as soon as you step out... you'll know the public's decision too.
Come on.
Leave.
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
Orchestrate as many slogans as you wish!
After the funeral... a long and dark exile awaits you!
They aren't going anywhere.
They never intended to.
So Samar...?
Trusting him was a big mistake.
I can't... accept this.
Father, you have to expel Prithvi from the party.
He's a traitor.
He'll destroy the party from within.
Do this for your son.
If I expel Prithvi... it will trigger a... wave of public sympathy... for him.
But father, tolerating him is just impossible for me!
Both father and son treated me like dirt.
I hate that man.
Son... this is politics.
Here, keep your enemies... close to you.
The real enemy isn't Prithvi.
It's Samar!
This was expected.
Bhanu Pratap is a past master of this game.
He knows that accepting the resignation... would've made Prithvi a martyr.
Have you seen this?
Veerendra has organized a mammoth rally in Madhopur.
He'll announce his Chief
Ministerial nomination.
Hello, sir.
The iron is hot.
- Here at the
Rashtrawadi Party's rally, where...
- even as Veerendra
Pratap's helicopter landed...
- on the other side,
Prithvi Pratap, Samar Pratap...
...and Brij Gopal's convoy reached the stage.
- The crowd is confused even as...
- the tableau on the stage becomes more dramatic.
- From the Kothra ground, Madhopur, this Is Malti Joshi, Star News.
Please use the sofas down there.
Today, only family members on the stage.
Please do cooperate...
This is too much. I'll show them their status today.
Brother Veeru, don't act in haste.
But Sooraj, they...
You know you can end their political career.
You come this way. Come on.
What's the meaning of this outrage, Uncle?
In politics, it's called hijack in broad daylight.
What do you mean?
- Take care of yourselves.
Long live Prithvi Pratap!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
My name is...
Samar Pratap.
I'm the youngest... and I humbly greet you all.
You've resigned from the party, Prithvi!
How will you fight now?
Throw it in the dustbin, Veerendra.
If you have the guts, throw me out in front of them.
- Your wish will come true, Prithvi.
I've always been kept away from politics... and nor am I here to talk politics today.
I only want to know one thing:
My father, Chandra Pratap gave his life for you... at his elder brother's command.
Does that martyrdom hold any value for you? Or not?
I only want to know one thing:
While his father lay dying... the police falsely accused Prithvi and physically dragged him away.
Does his struggle mean nothing to you?
- Prithvi, please fight on... We are with you!
There is no court higher than the people's court.
And the people of Madhopur... have always done justice!
This is the hour of destiny, friends!
In these trying times...
Rashtrawadi party needs a strong and able leader.
Someone who cares about the poor... who fights for their dignity... and who will not hesitate to sacrifice his life for them!
And you know very well who that is.
And to strengthen his resolve... we have with us... our brother, Veerendra Pratap...
Dalit leader, Sooraj Kumar... and our beloved, Brij Gopal.
Elders, brothers, sisters, friends... that leader is your very own...
Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
Long live Rashtrawadi Party!
To preserve... the integrity of the party...
I am pained to declare... that Prithvi Pratap... is hereby... dismissed... from the Rashtrawadi Party.
Sir, please... answer to our question.
It went exactly the way you had planned.
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
By dismissing me from my own party, they believe that...
I have become homeless and orphaned.
They're under a huge illusion.
Even if they expel me from the party... how can they remove me from your hearts!
My home is in your hearts... and I'm not leaving that!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
It was as if the entire town had turned up for my meeting!
The people are with us.
The caste-wise combination of every constituency... the local issues... the candidates' election history... it's all here.
The list of the top three candidates from every constituency.
Samar, we have only nine days... to file nominations... and our party doesn't even have a name yet.
I know, brother.
Remember, you had formed an organisation in college?
Prabhu.
- Right away.
That's the name of your party.
You're a youth symbol... and that will be your appeal.
We respect you a lot.
But you are well aware that our community has always suffered.
I know that, Arif.
But times have changed.
You can definitely trust us.
We do trust you, Brij sir but... you know that these political issues are very delicate.
We won't change our loyalty.
I can understand.
We shall pray for you.
- Thank you.
Uncle their support is crucial.
33% of the voters in the 132 constituencies are Muslims.
They vote in a group and we can't bribe their vote.
Well then... we'll need to strengthen our position.
And as that happens, the
Muslims will support us.
Uncle, we also need to gain the support of...
...the small regional parties.
Talks are underway, but they are asking for a huge price.
Take it.
Here is the confirmation.
What's this?
We have removed
Prithvi's name from... every single bank account of the party.
Great! Let him thrash about for every penny.
Babulal, the businessmen?
I've instructed all of them.
Let him fight the election as a beggar!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
We need a crowd of 300,000.
You're asking for thousands, but offering peanuts for that.
I'll... make sure you get the balance.
My dear sir, to organise crowds, one needs advance cash. Not credit.
Don't waste my time.
I'll... get it done.
You've always supported us.
We've already given to the party fund.
That party doesn't exist.
I'm talking about Prithvi Pratap.
After all, he will be your next Chief Minister.
May your words come true!
We're always there for you.
But times are tough.
Now, that you've come personally... please accept this offering.
Looks like a couple of zeros have been missed out.
I brought receipts for 50 million... while you are offering half a million.
I respect your status.
Hence, I can't accept this.
I'm leaving the receipts here, though.
Thank you.
- Looks like, we've suddenly become political outcasts.
I've spoken with Sakseria.
I'm going to see him.
I don't think in these conditions he'll bet on Prithvi.
- Your father had done a lot for him. Let's see.
- I'll visit your father today itself.
Don't hesitate to call for absolutely anything.
For now, only what I've asked for.
- Of course! 500 million will reach you by this evening.
Don't worry.
- I shall leave now.
Mr. Brij Gopal!
- Hello.
Please, come in.
- No... just came to say hello.
How is Indu?
She's well... very well.
Okay then...
Why're you being so difficult,
Sarah? - Am I being difficult?!
You were supposed to return three weeks ago and...
My father was shot dead! Remember?
Don't talk to me like that, Samar.
Look, I'm sorry. It's just that it's been...
I check my phone 50 times a day seeing if you've called.
You never have. The only news I get is off the Net.
Listen, I can't talk right now.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?
- I'm coming there,
Samar. - No, you're not!
Sarah, please listen, listen to me.
The time is not right. And I've some serious priorities out here.
And obviously I don't figure in them.
- Thanks, Samar
Fuck!
Mr. Samar is in the office.
Should I inform him?
I'm here to meet Aunty.
Why don't you get married to Samar?
Then you can be with me, always.
I don't need to marry anyone for that.
Samar, have you fought with Indu?
It's nothing. I'm fine.
May I say something?
What?
I've been a fool, Indu.
What are you trying to say?
Just this... that not only does my mother, but even I like you.
You're lying!
No!
I didn't know then.
I was confused.
I'm sorry.
Mom, I accept.
Please speak with her dad.
See... if this is a joke, I'll hammer you.
Look at that!
Threats of violence, already?
Mom, do ask for an ambulance as dowry.
Who knows when I'll have to go to the hospital.
"The love is raining.
The color is all over."
"The anklet is colored, the drape is colored.
I am colored in your love."
"My heart is swaying."
"It keeps swinging."
"Come to me beloved. I don"t feel good without you."
"The love is raining."
"The color is all over."
Phenomenal response to Prithvi!
His media management is excellent, fantastic.
Your younger son, Samar... is a gem.
I'm here to ask something for him.
Anything... anything, of course!
Thank you.
I'm very fond of Indu.
And I'm sure, she'll keep Samar happy.
I've been looking forward to this day.
And you know what...
Samar will make an excellent Chief Minister.
No, it is Prithvi who'll be the CM.
Samar is just helping him.
That's fine too.
After all, Prithvi is the leader.
Then, we should let Samar be.
Let Indu marry Prithvi.
How can you say that!
That's impossible.
Moreover, Indu loves Samar.
You don't worry about Indu.
My choice will be her choice.
See, if I am to finance a party, then obviously I will insist... that my daughter should marry the CM designate.
And in either case, she will come to your family.
Let's go.
Have you gone mad?
Stop talking nonsense.
How can you even imagine that I'll marry Indu!
Samar is right, Prithvi.
We don't have a choice.
Of course we do!
I've decided.
Samar will become the CM.
So what if I don't get to sit on that chair?
My brother will!
Ridiculous.
- Wait a minute.
You think only you can make sacrifices?
And I can't?
I don't care for a position that takes your happiness away.
Brother... my happiness lies only in making you the CM.
And, you want to know the truth?
Indu knows that I don't love her.
Then why did you send the proposal?
Because of you.
Only Sakseria can fund your election.
To hell with his money!
You're my younger brother.
- We'll do it on our own. -
That is no longer an option.
If we don't accept his support, he'll offer it to Veerendra.
And marry Indu to him.
Indu is a very nice girl.
She'll learn to love you.
And I know that... you will look after her well.
How can you do this!
Am I only a business proposal for you?
Just another source of income.
You're upset now.
We'll talk about this later.
Our list...
- Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Come... let's go to the other room.
Let me handle this, brother.
You say you don't love me... fine!
Don't want to marry me... don't!
But what right do you have to meddle in my life?
You're forgetting that it was I who asked for your hand in marriage.
So what if my father spoke nonsense?
I still love you!
I have forsaken his house... his wealth...
I'll go with you wherever you take me.
I can't marry anyone else.
I can't live without you.
In these circumstances I can't marry you.
Please, Samar... Don't say that!
Take back your decision.
I can't take a chance with my brother's political career.
And my life?
You have no problem destroying it!
I am not destroying your life, Indu.
I'm trying to protect it.
You know that if we reject Prithvi's proposal... your father will marry you off to Veerendra.
Please try to understand, Indu.
Whatever you may think of Prithvi...
I know he will love you a lot.
And then mom's here too.
You will be very happy here.
This is how it's always been, child.
We are the ones who're always expected to compromise.
Hello. Hello.
We are indeed honoured by your presence.
Come, sir...
Hello.
- Hello. - God bless you.
Mr. Sakseria, the super
Chief Minister is here.
Please do introduce me.
- Hello.
My father has sent this... for the bride.
Thanks for coming.
Do you seriously believe... that by selling your brother you can win the election?
Looks like you're nervous.
Let Sakseria stake as much loot as he wants... you brother will still fall flat.
The fear of defeat is clearly visible on your face.
Uncle, please look after him.
Enjoy the evening.
Overconfident, eh?
Mr. Sooraj, an exclusive byte, please.
What can I say about myself?
Speak to the people.
Some personal questions, please.
You must be joking.
There's nothing worth hiding in a poor person's life.
My life is an open book.
However, I can point you in an interesting direction.
What do you mean?
Thank you, sir.
Hello. Please be seated.
Sir, how's your campaign doing?
Fantastic!
In just 7 days, we've confirmed 200 plus candidates.
And it's obvious that the people are with us.
It seems that your entire campaign is funded by Rajkumar Sakseria.
See, ours in a new party.
Whoever has wanted to help...
How much dowry did you collect from him?
Look here... let's stick to election-related questions.
Well, this question is on everyone's lips.
Even though Indu was openly seeing your brother... how come she got married to you?
This is my personal and family matter.
Then, at least tell us... about the compromises you've made in this marriage.
Are you absolutely sure that... while you are busy campaigning... your wife isn't with your brother?
Hey! Shut up!
Shut up!
- What's the meaning of this?
Stop this. Stop this at once!
- What are you doing?
You asked... a very filthy question.
You will pay for this! Shut this.
Stop it! Hello.
- Shut this down!
- Prithvi Pratap had already been charged with...
- assaulting a police officer
And of raping a woman party worker.
- Shut this! Shut this down!
Sir... one more thing, please.
Mr. Sooraj... what do you have to say about Mr.
Prithvi Pratap's recent outburst?
My sympathies are with him.
His marriage itself was a huge compromise.
Hence, it isn't surprising for him to lose his mental balance.
And it's obvious that he can't cope with the stress of elections.
He needs to rest.
This for Samar.
- I... I'll take this.
Guess who this is!
- Who?
This must be Samar's mom, right?
Absolutely.
This is Samar's friend, Sarah.
- Oh?
Namaste!
- Oh... yes, namaste.
And, this is Samar's sister-in-law,
Indu. - Hi.
You didn't tell me she was coming!
How could I - she called me at 3 A.M. From the airport.
Sarah?
Look Sarah... life here is different.
I won't be able to explain everything.
You'll just have to trust me.
Do you still love me, Samar?
What kind of a question is that?
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
Very much.
You don't have to worry about me.
I trust you completely.
The two of you look very nice together.
She obviously loves you a lot.
But maybe she doesn't know... that you can't love anyone.
Indu, please listen to me...
- No, you listen to me!
You only know how to use people.
I don't even recognise this Samar.
The darkness that I see in your heart!
I'm actually grateful to my father... for rejecting your proposal.
Because whatever your brother may be... he has a pure heart.
You won't understand this, Indu.
This much I do understand, Samar.
That we don't exploit those...
...who love us.
Sarah may not be able to bear it.
The election campaign of the
Rashtravadi party has gone up.
The campaigning was at its full flow at the district Beerpur.
There were huge rallies in several areas. The new...
...president of the party Virendra
Pratap and the general secretary...
...Suraj Kumar delivered speech too. If the presence of
...the voters is taken into consideration than this campaign...
...has been thriving. Media has already made Suraj Kumar...
...a hero of the backward class.
The pace with which he has...
...evolved in politics and with his gift of gab he has already become...
...a leader amongst the backward class and would be supported by them.
There is no cause for worry here.
Every single person is rooting for you.
On the one hand, you speak of our old alliance... and yet, you are being secretive about seat-sharing.
What am I supposed to tell the High Command?
Bhanu, I'll have to declare the seats today.
If you enjoy defeat, you can have more seats.
Veerendra... don't forget that mine is a national party.
Don't force me to take drastic decisions.
Give me a break, grandpa!
Don't forget that we've been lugging your national burden.
The last time you had just 12 legislators... and yet we made you the Chief Minister.
So, this time don't expect even six.
Now you decide.
Veeru... make that 10.
We'll lose all of them.
We can't take that chance.
Bhanu... the coalition will break.
Ask him to release 20 seats.
We'll pay you a total of...
400 million.
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
Sir, what are the terms of alliance with Prajatantrik Party?
Sir, who else is filing nominations along with you?
How many seats are they contesting?
You will get to know it all very soon.
Patience... Patience is always rewarded.
Everything is going in their favour.
If you don't do something quick, we'll lose the plot.
Samar sir, we need a masterstroke.
Yes, sir?
I had asked you for a favour, Babulal.
Your favour is not so easy to fulfill, sir.
And it wouldn't be very ethical of me, would it?
True. Sorry, I disturbed you.
He wasted my time.
He is speaking of ethics. Imagine!
Now, what are the ethics of a bandit? Tell me.
Hello... hello?
Babulal, yesterday you were giving me a lecture on ethics...
I was... I was... I was completely out of line, sir...
I could see that.
Anyway, tell me where I should send these photos.
Please forgive me, sir...
I...
I... very...
I went astray...
Please forgive me...
I... can...
I beg of you... Please forgive me.
Brother Samar... the time is really bad.
The man needs some help.
What's this?
I was... helpless...
You already know this to be true.
Now, you only have to state it publicly.
But... but...
Never be afraid of the truth!
I'm with you. Have no fear.
No harm will come to you. Come.
Don't you trust me?
This way.
Okay ready. Silence, please.
Allegations and counter-allegations during elections are...
...a common occurrence.
But, what we're about to reveal now will stun you.
Today we have with us... a staunch loyalist of Rashtrawadi...
Mr. Babulal.
Having served the party faithfully for 25 years... it pains me to admit that... the Rashtrawadi Party has become a den of corruption.
When Mr. Bhanu
Pratap was in power... his son...
Veerendra Pratap took... fixed kickbacks from every government contract.
He raked in billions.
Even donations meant for the party fund... were not spared.
Ever since Sooraj Kumar became general secretary... this politics of cash... has escalated.
- In these elections...
- Get him here!
Son of a bitch!
The men are on their way.
I'm going to torture the bastard to death!
Veeru, please calm down.
This is Samar's ploy.
It's imperative that Babulal publicly take back his own statement.
Don't worry at all, Babulal.
Have a seat.
Your safety is my responsibility now.
Tell me...
That night when you called my father at the airport...
...who asked you to make that call?
Wh... what are you asking?
I... don't understand...
Who asked you to call?
Phone?
I... I didn't call.
Babulal... you are one of us.
I respect you a lot.
Please... don't insult me.
S... s... sssir... I beg of you...
Don't ask me this question.
Who asked you to call my father?
Veerendra Pratap... or Sooraj?
Sooraj Kumar.
Thank you.
You have proved your loyalty.
You're definitely one of us.
You... mine...
I just need your benediction.
Of course.
You have my word.
Here... your phone.
I've entered my personal number into it.
I'll always be in touch.
Anytime.
Anytime.
Sooraj.
It was Sooraj.
Anytime...
Love you so much...
Who's been coaching you?
Uncle Brij.
Mr. Babulal's violent death has sent shock waves...
...throughout the state's political circles.
What is being seen as more than a mere coincidence is that... just this morning he resigned from Rashtrawadi Party... publicly levelling allegations of corruption...
...and nepotism against the party leadership.
Mr. Babulal was killed in a car blast on the Chhattarpur road...
...while he was travelling.
Both he and his driver died of severe burn injuries on the spot.
Oh my God! That's him!
That's the man I saw in your office this morning.
The cause of the blast is yet to be determined.
However, initial evidence suggests...
...it could have been a bomb placed in the car.
Yes, that's him.
Babulal.
He is dead, Samar!
Hmmm... tragic.
Must've been involved in something messy.
- While the investigation Is still on...
- they Are not going to rule out any possibilities.
Got to get some work done.
Bye.
Mr. Veerendra Pratap... after Babulal's testimony on TV, didn't you threaten him? - Rubbish!
- He was a victim of a deadly conspiracy. - Who was behind this?
- He openly accused you of corruption. So, did you?
Meaning?
What the hell do you mean?
That I got him killed?!
He was like my family.
One of the founders of this party.
Babulal's murder... will cost them dearly.
Very dearly.
They're scared... panic stricken!
Their singular objective is to destroy our unity.
But, brothers...
Rashtrawadi's foundations aren't so weak... as to be shaken by such incidents.
Baseless allegations... imaginary scandals.
They're scrambling around for dirt to throw at us!
But, let them know, that if you spit at the sky... it will land back on your own face.
The repercussions will be severe.
The repercussions will be severe!
Inspector Sharma!
Your vacation's over.
Do something useful now.
Do something.
We're petitioning the court to... reopen the rape investigation against Prithvi.
Mark my words, he will be behind bars.
We're also asking the
Election Commission to... disqualify him since he is a criminal.
That's fine, Veeru.
But, for the election we only need people's support.
Which we are assured of anyway.
- Why not let sleeping dogs lie? - Sooraj!
In politics, you never let dogs sleep.
You keep them awake.
So that when needed... they bark!
Make me talk to Prithvi.
It's urgent.
It's Inspector Bhola Singh.
Says it's urgent.
Hello?
- Hello, sir.
The prey is here. In the farm house of Mr. Veerendra.
Security is very tight.
- Okay.
Tell me what do I do?
Get your men out of there. I'm on my way.
Head to Chhattarpur farms.
Come on. Get going from here.
Party president Prithvi Singh did a road show in Madhavpur.
There was a great amount of enthusiasm in people for this.
Men, women, children and even senior citizens participated in it.
First a rally at Ramna Maidan and now a road show at Madhavpur.
With this new and youthful image of Prithvi Singh...
...he is slowly gaining popularity amongst young voters.
When you play hide-n-seek with me, it creates magic in my heart...
Hey, Sharma! Where were you hiding, huh?
That was one long vacation!
I really missed you.
I... made a big mistake, sir.
Your slap packs a solid punch, pal.
It does!
Why don't you give me a sample?
It was a big mistake.
I did apologize... to Brij Gopal.
So? Lovely, wasn't it?
You did absolutely right.
I deserved it!
But, now I'll be good.
See, I'm the one who made that woman... withdraw her complaint against you.
Ah, that woman...
Glad that you reminded me of her.
I've to settle her account too.
I... I'll bring her to you, whenever you want.
Good. Call her now.
Mr. Sharma! What's up?
I'm here with the boss.
He wants to meet you.
- Where Are you? - been shopping at the new market.
Huh? New market?
Call Nathu and Ballu.
They should be there.
- Wait right there.
I'm sen... sending a car.
- Vee... Veerendra's called you urgently.
Yeah, sure.
Ah, I just love this one!
- This silk is from Benaras.
Made by hand...
- all hand-crafted.
Hey... hey... Let go! Let go of me.
Come on, sit in the car.
- Let go off me!
Come on, sit inside. Don't shout!
- Let go off me!
Let go off me!
Help! Help!
Please, help me!
- Tell me... - Sir, our men Are here.
Who all?
I recognized Ballu.
He moves with Prithvi.
Let go! To the new market.
Help me! Help!
Hey! Hey! Leave her!
Somebody help her!
What's everybody doing?
Call the police!
Yes, Samar...
Have you gone crazy, brother?
Now that everything's going well, don't do anything stupid.
It's done.
Finished!
You should've seen his face.
Brother, please listen to me.
Leave me... leave me!
Just a sec...
I've another favour to return.
I'll call you later.
Please get out of there, fast!
I'm sending some guys to clean up.
Let me go...
Hey...
Please, let me go.
How are you, sweetheart?
Now, tell me... Where do you want to contest from? Huh?
From Sitapur?
Or from hell?
Somebody call the police!
Sarah... please...
Sir, listen to us...
Ma'am, one minute please.
Ma'am, did you see the kidnaper?
Move back! Move back all of you.
We have freedom of the press.
She will have to talk.
The media is free.
But remember...
...your freedom cannot be used to terrorise us.
What happened, love?
I've seen that man!
Who?
- The man!
The man who kidnapped that woman.
I've seen him around here somewhere.
You're in shock, Sarah.
You need some rest.
The police will look into it.
Come on.
- Sir, this is Inspector Singh. SP
Sharma was killed around 4 PM.
- We've found drugs on his body.
- Clean It up. - Okay.
- I'll inform Veeru about this.
No!
Don't bother. I'll tell him myself.
Okay.
Jeez, Sarah...
You gave me a start!
What's up, Sarah?
That's what I've come to find out, Samar.
What's happened to you!
What d'you mean?
You've changed, Samar.
Or maybe not.
Maybe you were always like this... and, it's just that I didn't see it.
What are you talking about, Sarah?
I'm talking about what you do here, in the name of family and politics!
Oh, come on!
You can't believe what the media has to say.
At least don't insult me by lying to me, Samar.
Those goons who kidnapped that woman... those were your brother's men.
You knew that!
And you killed Babulal!
Stay out of this, Sarah.
This is politics.
Right!
You have become a ruthless, conniving politician!
Fuck!
If this is what you believe... then I have nothing more to say to you.
You don't have to dismiss me, Samar.
I was coming to tell you that I'm leaving.
Sarah...
I've seen enough politics and violence, Samar.
You seem to forget that I grew up in Ireland.
I saw my father and my brother killed... when I was six years old.
My child is not going to face that.
Ever!
Child?
- Wait a minute. Are you saying... - Yes...
I'm pregnant!
Wow sweetheart, that's terrific! I...
Please don't! Don't... please.
I'm leaving.
I'll come with you!
I'll come away from all of this.
Sarah, listen to me...
I swear on our child.
Just give me a few weeks.
I need to finish this election, Sarah.
They killed my father.
I must protect my brother now.
Everything will be okay.
You'll see.
I'll come to you very soon, okay?
Sensational news!
It is unprecedented in the country's election history... that so many nominations of one party have been rejected altogether.
The Election Commission has said that the nominations...
...were incorrectly filed.
The papers were correctly filed, Veeru.
Yes, everything was in order.
In order, my foot!
Instead of originals, photocopies were submitted.
Even the affidavits didn't have your signatures.
We lost 17 seats without even contesting.
Whose side are you on?
I know whose side they're on.
And who is behind this.
Why did you do this?
Why?
Hang us if you wish, Veeru...
We were compelled.
You don't even deserve to be hanged.
Veeru...
Shut up!
You leave. Leave.
They were 23, now only 17 left, how?
Six of Sooraj's men backed out.
Exit poll result for the first round.
Of 73 seats, they're predicting 45-47 for us.
That's nonsense!
Out of 73, we shall take 52.
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Jan Shakti!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Jan Shakti!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
I'm sorry.
I failed to understand you.
I love you.
Even I love you very much.
Just didn't know how to show it.
You! You're the one I'll vote for.
For 25 years, I voted for Rashtrawadi party.
But this time, I will vote for you!
No one can defeat you.
Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Samar Pratap seems to have boosted...
- his brother Prithvi
Pratap's campaign tremendously.
- In villages, towns, big cities, in every corner of the state...
The Election Commission rejected our petition against Prithvi.
- It's waiting for the court's decision.
On the other hand, Prithvi Pratap...
What the hell is going on here!
First Babulal... then Sharma... the nominations conspiracy!
That little brat... is now dictating our future?!
And you, Sooraj?
You can't do anything.
It will work out.
- Like hell it will!
Just keep consoling me... since you can't offer me any confidence!
Veerendra Pratap doesn't need... anyone's support.
Indu...
I know what you've been through but...
I hope you can forgive Samar.
It's okay, Sarah.
I've found my happiness.
Prithvi is a wonderful person.
Daya?
- Yes, sir? - Where are you off to?
To the restroom, sir.
They've to leave for the airport. Hurry up.
Samar!
Samar!
Wait!
Don't go near the car. Step back!
Sarah, stop!
Take care of mother.
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
He doesn't let me...
He doesn't let me into his heart...
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
The fever isn't subsiding at all.
He is still passed out.
Nothing seems to be going right.
Everything will fall apart.
- Sir? - Where Is Sooraj?
What is the matter?
- Where Is Sooraj? - He Is sleeping.
He has a fever.
Should I wake him up?
No.
You won't be able to see this.
It's better that you stay here.
Sir... please say something.
What are you doing, sir!
The family that fed you... supported you... gave you a life.
He wants to destroy that same family?
Sooraj would never do that.
- He is doing it!
You gave birth to a snake.
That can't be!
If he were my own blood,
I would have believed it.
But he is a blessing from
God. Everyone worships him.
What did you just say?
- We were childless.
It was 27 years ago that...
I found him in a boat at sunrise...
...near the
Sukhamaniya ghats at Benaras.
He was wrapped in this cloth... and had this jewellery.
No one knows about this.
Sooraj himself doesn't know.
How can Sooraj do this to me when you are around?
- I can't do anything to him. - Why not?
Because he is... your son.
What?
Your first born... who I snatched from your womb, 27 years ago.
From here on, you'll have to walk alone, sister.
Please tell me... what I can do for you.
An unfortunate mother has come to ask forgiveness from her son.
Your son?
Who is your son here?
You, Sooraj.
You are my son.
Listen...
I understand you're in shock...
I am sorry for your loss.
No, Sooraj... it is true!
Ram Charittar isn't your father.
27 years ago... he found you... at the riverside in Benaras.
What kind of a joke is this!
Son, I gave birth to you.
You are my first born.
The elder brother of
Prithvi and Samar.
You are lying!
You want to protect your son.
Your father was Bhaskar Sanyal.
I worshipped him.
One day, we got carried away... in a storm of emotions.
He blamed himself... and forsook everything.
I was an unmarried girl.
Please forgive me, son.
I was bound by the limitations of my family's honour.
So, why're you telling me this now?
Come home, son.
That is where you belong.
Samar will happily accept you.
The party will also get a boost.
Moreover, you are the eldest.
You should be the leader.
Beg your pardon?
Leader?! Wow!
In one breath you make me your son.
And in the next, you play politics with me!
- No, Sooraj... I was... - do you really believe... that by dangling the promise of power you can twist my integrity?
You may have given birth to me... but I am the son of Ram
Charittar Kumar and Shanti Devi.
My soul is that of a Dalit.
Mrs. Bharati Pratap...
I won't make the same mistake you did.
When I was down and out...
Veerendra Pratap supported me.
Gave me respect... and an identity.
Only he has a right to my loyalty.
Until my last breath
I will stand by him.
Don't you trust me, father?
I will never let the
Rashtrawadi Party go down.
The final victory will be ours.
God, it appears, is testing us severely.
But you will not break.
Please Indu... you will have to be strong.
You will have to be strong.
Everything is over.
- It's over.
- We Are orphaned.
Samar...
- now you Are our only hope.
It is true that... we have suffered a very tragic blow.
But don't forget that... the resolve that our leader Prithvi had undertaken... is alive even today.
Brothers... nothing is over... and nor are we orphans.
Come on.
This is Mrs. Indu Prithvi Pratap.
Jan Shakti party's new leader.
Under her leadership, we'll contest the elections... and be victorious!
I, Brij Gopal... as the mentor of the
Jan Shakti Party... nominate Mrs. Indu Prithvi Pratap... as Jan Shakti Party's new president.
We support this nomination.
- You have our support!
- I... - I, Indu Prithvi Pratap... take this vow, in the presence of God... take this vow, in the presence of God...
I will be a member of the
Jan Shakti Party for life...
I will be a member of the
Jan Shakti Party for life... and follow every rule... and follow every rule... and command of the party.
And command of the party.
- Long live Jan Shakti!
- Long live Jan Shakti!
- Long live India!
- Long live India!
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
My tears haven't dried up yet.
And I won't allow them to dry up.
Until I get an answer from you!
Tell me... how can you tolerate... these unending attacks on me?
My father-in-law was brutally murdered.
But, you remained silent.
His own son was humiliated... and driven out of his party.
But, you remained silent.
The henna applied on my hands for my wedding hadn't even faded... and they mercilessly made me a widow.
But, even now, you remain silent!
Why?
Answer me!
Are you going to vote my family's killers... into power?
No!
Is this your sense of justice?
- No!
Does my sacrifice count for nothing?
- It does! It does!
Answer me!
- It does! It does!
All initial reports seem to point towards a majority for Indu Pratap.
After the history of conflict with the Rashtrawadi Party... violence was anticipated but... barring one or two incidents, elections were peaceful.
There were a few complaints against the EVMs.
From Bada Bazaar, in Balrampur... with cameraman Ram Narayan, this is Mukta Tiwari for Star News.
Muslims, Hindus, all... seem to be in one line.
It's entirely a one-sided contest.
The widow is going to sweep it all away.
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
How're things?
- Here we had no problems but... reports from other areas aren't too encouraging.
- Most exit polls predict 120-130 seats...
- for the Jan Shakti party led by Indu Pratap.
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
Long live Indu Pratap!
- If the result goes this way then...
- in the 207-member legislative assembly...
- Jan Shakti will hold a clear majority.
- The party workers of Jan
Shakti Are already celebrating.
- On the other side, the Rashtrawadi party office Is a picture of gloom.
What is the report?
- There seem to have been some stray complaints...
- about the malfunctioning of Electronic Voting Machines.
The machine in our booth just wasn't working.
No matter which button we pressed, the vote registered elsewhere.
- From three other places, similar complaints were...
He has rigged the machines.
I am dead sure!
- Where Is the boss?
He's been up all night watching TV reports.
It's urgent.
So, Raghav, tell me... are the voting machines actually tampered with?
- I'll just put him on.
Sir... it's Moti.
Some suspicious activity at Bankepur.
- Tell me... - Sir...
Samar and his men are here since last night... with computers, antennae and other stuff.
I heard they're tampering with the voting machines by remote.
What the...?
Keep an eye on them.
- I'm on my way. - Okay.
Follow me to the Bankepur area.
Come on, hurry up.
- Hurry up!
Where did he go?
I have no idea. He just drove off.
What do you mean?
Where was the security?
- He must've said something.
- Nothing at all.
He isn't answering his phone.
- Yes, Sooraj. - Veeru...
Where Are you?
Near the defunct
Bankepur cable factory.
I'm on my way. Don't get out of the car.
By then that Samar would've changed all the bloody votes.
Come on... that's impossible!
What is impossible now is to trust anyone, Sooraj.
Using some fancy hi-tech tricks, he is... snatching our votes from under our noses... and you say...
Just don't get out of the car! I'm on my way.
He's here.
Alone.
Nobody shoots.
His car is bullet-proof.
Sooraj Kumar is here too, sir.
Don't shoot.
- Yes? - Veeru... nothing happening here.
It's better we leave.
Didn't you notice outside?
I didn't see anyone outside.
They're talking on the phone.
We can't wait for long.
They are hiding somewhere.
I'll take a look.
- No! Don't step out.
I'll have a look.
No one shoots... until Veeru steps out.
Shoot, Sooraj!
Shoot him, Sooraj!
Shoot him, Sooraj!
- Veeru... Veeru... - Huh?
Don't close your eyes!
Shoot! Shoot!
Veeru...
Let's finish this war right here, Samar.
Just... allow me to take
Veeru to the hospital.
Then I'll come wherever you want me to.
My life is in your hands.
I am bound by my commitment to... protect my friend.
Come on, Veeru...
What are you waiting for, Samar?
He is unarmed.
So?
Did they kill your father and brother on the battlefield?
Don't get trapped in questions of justice and ethics.
This is the time!
Don't lose sight of the goal for which you entered this fight.
Remember, in politics... victory is all that matters.
And, your victory will remain incomplete... as long as he is alive.
Come on.
Finish him!
Sooraj!
I...
I, Indu Pratap... swear in the name of God... that I will uphold... the Indian constitution... with dedication, honesty and respect.
I shall always seek to preserve the unity and diversity of India.
As the Chief
Minister of the state...
I promise to perform my duties with dedication... and a clear conscience.
I never wanted to do... any of the things that I did.
You, of all people, know this, uncle.
Please forgive me.
I am sorry, Indu.
I am sorry that I hurt you so much.
I know that you may never be able to forgive me.
Do you really have to go?
I always wanted to stay away from politics.
I feared the demons... that it brings out.
But, that is exactly what happened.
I couldn't escape my circumstances... and ended up losing everything.
But, I know...
I know that you're not like that.
Your heart is pure.
You'll be okay.
My world was very different, Indu... in which I only had Sarah.
Now, I must look after her mother.
But, you'll have to return soon.
There's something of your brother with me.
I am going to be the mother of his child.
Wow, Indu!
Wow... I mean that's...
It's been a long while since this family received some good news.
Congratulations!
Come back soon.
Of course, I will.
But on one condition.
You have to come to receive me in a car with the flashing red light.
Bye.
Sir, you?
Ram Charittar is part of the family.
Where can he go?
I am the one who has always driven you to and from the airport.
As a child, you played in my lap...
Please, forgive me.
No, uncle.

Nerdy police
Never seen you before, a rookie?
Seems like you're well matter
Alright! Let's see what you can do
Assaulting police officer and snatch his gun
I can kill you
Many witness here, you have a right? 
Yup! A right is always on my side 
Let's see the judge believe you or me
First box, 18th box
I didn't do it men, you are mistaken. 
Don't play dumb!
There's witness saw you beat her up more than once.
Two months ago, you beat her unconscious
Is that true?
Boss, Mike just checked the tape  
Kun and his friend spend all night at the bookie place.
Just book him, selling drugs, child abuse
Boss, Mike and I checked everywhere
Nothing turned up.
Forensic from the lab found skin under victim's fingernails not belong to her.
They run DNA right now.
The stain found on the pillow they identified as burnt gunpowder.
They said any gun has been used within weeks always leaves a trace like this.
Whoever came up with a gun either a robery or a murderer, or...
You don't say that one of us, right?
Don't think so
Last week, none of us used our gun 
Yes, there's one last week
A kid snatched a gun and opened fire on polices. 
Two dead and one injured, kid is still on the run.
May, find out what department has the case.
Let's see we can co-op.
OK
Also look up the tape from target practice.
I'm on it
How about inspector Kee's case?
It's done
You think we're bad, he's even worse.
By the way, the guy was hit by the bus his name is Khan Chen
He worked for Anti drug unit 
He's not in Narcotics Bureau
Anti drug? Why inpector Kee said he worked under him?
Boss, I got to go pick up my daughter.
I'll check on tape later.
Boss, about the shooting polices case
They got some news from an informant.
It may lead to the same suspect
So it can be co-op
Check the inventory from armory warehouse. 
I want to know last week how many bullets were used. 
OK?
Yes, sir
This's for you
Thank you
Boss, Do you need anything?
No
Ok, I'm going 
Well...I got some dirty underwears. If it's conveninent...
People die every day. Why don't you conveninent do the same?
Don't be so hash. Hey 
Inpector Kee
You'll get the package from Sam. 
It's here
Sam, got the package.
Right.
OK
About the deal with your buddy
How's it going?
Working on it 
What if he changes his fucking mind later?
His wife comes to Hong Kong tomorrow, I can get her.
If you fuck it up, don't let me see your fucking face. 
We're best buddy, I can trust only you 
Opportunity of the life time
But it's illegal, I can't do it.
You just put things together, no big deal.
Your wife, she'll come tomorrow and she's almost due.
You want to take care of her, right?
You don't want her to suffer, do you? 
Thank you
We're not going to the station?
Xiao Ke didn't tell you to pick my wife up?
He'll pick your wife up, we'll meet at the restaurant.
Hello, I'm Xiao Ke
Your husband told me to pick you up.

341e
Hoi supposed to go with boss
All my fault, I told him not to go
He's not like this if it's wasn't me.
Silly girl, don't blame on yourself
Everyone is on the line of fire
How is it?
Not too bad...just a cracked rib
For some reason, today I wear bullet-proof vest
You're lucky
My sign is dragon
Probably this's my lucky year
Mine is also dragon, but don't see any luck
By the way, why were you there?
Heard from headquarter, just happened I was in neighbor
So I rushed over
Detective Manfred
How was it? Recognize anyone?
Sir, It was too chaotic
Sir, I saw one guy
Narcotics Bureau, inspector Kee
When he shot at me
I saw his face clearly
I can help detective with photos
You know each other?
He helped me on another case.
This case gets more complicated
Only you can recognize him 
Just stay here and help us out
I'll contact with your boss
Yes, sir
Ok, I'll go and talk with reporters otherwise, they'll say we're not truefull
Remember, if you plan on something no matter what run it by me first, understood?
Understood
Why did you talk to him like that?
He didn't even ask about our men got injury
Just care about getting suspect or not
When the case can be solved
Just care for himself
Ellen
You are all right?
I'm fine, just a flesh wound
Let me introduce, detective Manfred
My girlfriend, Ellen
Hi
Let's go
You just got shot, should you stay in hospital?
Or just like last time you didn't listen to the doctor?
I'm fine, don't worry
Go home, I'll see you later
Mr. Kee, crude oil keep going up
You did a short sell and lost 30 million
You have to buy it back at 5 o'clock
I know
Otherwise, we'll force to close your account
I said I know
Take a seat
Inspector, I'm here to inform you that company must deduct 500,000 interest
You've paid 1.5 millions
So you still have around 5 millions short
I just put in the equity of my house
Does it take into account?
It's been cleared off 2 months ago
You need to come in and sign the papers
Tell your boss, I fucking sign nothing
Do you think I'm stupid?
You're better give me back my money
Inspector, why you got angry with me?
Hey, How's your dad?
Doc said he cut his wrist
Lucky, found him on time
Here, take care of your dad in hospital will last for a while
How's thing going?
I checked on anti drug department
They'll dispatch in 3 days same route
Talk!
Who is the guy wearing hat in teahouse?
I don't know him
What do you buy weapons for?
Where do you wanna rob?
I don't know, I told you I don't know them 
I don't know, I really don't know them
Several people were injured at the teahouse 
Had three death polices
Looks like you'll be in jail for a very long time
I really don't know, I really don't know them
They said...They picked up my wife
Who picked your wife up? Who were they?
Xiao...Xiao Ke, Xiao Ke looked for me 
Was the one with you in teahouse?
Was it him?
Boss
They found trace of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in teahouse
If it's got fried up
It could be used to make bomb
You can't buy it on the market without a permission
Probably it's one of their business's sources
Son of bitches, they try to make bomb
He said Xiao Ke looked for him
Check his cell number
Check his land line and check his phone records
Two years ago, he came to Hong Kong did administrator, truck driver, sold newspaper
Used to worked as demolition in mainland for stone mine
I checked on his crimal record
He's clean
His wife comes to Hong Kong today
Why didn't you report it? 
How can you explain this?
Sorry boss, I must have missed it
I checked his bank account
He send most of his income to his wife
How's your wife?
Seven months pregnant
Does your wife know you're robbery?
Think about your wife and your child
I heard about your wife
You kept looking for that thief like this
You'll get more complaints and look more suspicious 
Do it smarter, that's what I've learned
We are both dragons
But you're much better than me
In 2 years moved up 2 rank, everyone knew
They want to put you in charge
Why isn't it happening?
It's already approved, ready for interview
For some reason it's kicked back by Security department
In two years, I broke 4 big cases
I don't believe they don't give it to me
Right
Your achievement is undeniable
Talk is cheap, life is not that easy
Just believe in yourself
This's called reality
That night, I'm really sorry my wife wanted me not involved but your wife was murdered so gruesome 
I really wanted to help you
Then why did you file complaint about me?
It's not me, It's my wife
You know, she's such a bitch
Ah, don't mention her
I got headache just talk about her
Can I have one please?
Thank you
Actually, I still look out for you
I see you always seat in your car
He's so clever to let you see him
This's the only way I can do
I'm sure one day... I'll see him
Hey bro, Mom will have dinner at your house tonight
Try to get home early
I'll go to your place and clean it up a little
See ya later
Boss, latest infos
This's target practice's logs was send by Cheung-on

Good, thank you
Manfred
Mom, why didn't call me to pick you up?
You got heart condition
Shouldn't carry any heavy stuffs upstair the baby crib is here, let's put it together
Don't let her do it when she gets back
Mom, just let Manfred does it himself
Let him? besides his jobs, notthing else matter to him
Look at him, not even take care of himself
What can we do now? Time is runing out
Telling her the true, she can't stand it
Now everyone doesn't want to talk to her afraid that they'll say something unintended
Manfred, get my medicine
Your medicine, water
Take it easy
Manfred, sit down
Because last time it was careless, but this time...
Why did you let her go oversee?
She said it's important job
More important than your child?
You should know it better
What kind of husband are you?
Don't worry, Mom
She'll get home pretty soon
100 years of life, it's 99 years of concerning 
Doctor said my fibroid tumors became active
The baby, only has half chance to survive
It means we still have half chance to make it
We must have confidence
There's confidence, there will be hope, right?
Doctor said...
If we want to keep the baby
I may die
If I want a chance to survive, I need to abort the baby
Don't cry, Honey.
We'll talk to the doctor
We don't need to keep the baby
I can't let anything happen to you
We lost a baby once
This time...we don't have other chance
I can't stand to let it happen again
I want to keep the baby
You want dady feeding you forever? 
You got so spoil
Your homework is "I love my mother", but you write "I love my father"
Can't tell difference from dady and momy?

Cheung-on
Boss, say hi to detective Manfred
Hi, detective Manfred

No, I came last month
Last month?
Last month?
May gave me the bullet record
You received 20 bullets
It was wrote down clealy
On your copy, it didn't show your name
Why did you lie?
Boss
Did you kill that girl?
I didn't, I didn't kill her
I went to see her
But I'm not a murderer, believe me
Not a murderer?
Let's take a DNA test, Go!
Boss, I really don't want to lie to you
But I know this's a big fucking mess
She got killed after she and I were done 
The guy with a hat at teahouse
I remember him with a hat
That night, I bumped into him outside elevator
He wore a hat, He's the killer
I knew I couldn't go out and do this
You can give me all hell and shit but I'm innocent
Innocent, Why don't you tell me ealier?
We know each other for long time
Everyone knew you got hot temple
You will report me, I'm cool with that but I don't want my daughter knows about this
After wife left me, I got nothing
If this gets out to the media
Those reporters will make it big
My daughter will have a hard time
I don't want this affects my daughter
Boss, I've been followed you for many years
At least I have some credits
Please give me a chance
I won't rest untill I find the killer
Please don't report me, would ya?
Give me a week, I'll turn Hong Kong up side down to find that mother fucker
If I can't find him in one week then you can arrest me

I'm arresting you
Inspector Kee
Boss
Whoever stop me will be charged as obstruction of justice
Manfred
You two return your guns at the station
The rest keep going
Hurry
This's a big issue and you don't tell me 
Instead, people outside reported to me
What's you trying to do?
Was that girl killed by Cheung-on?
He said he didn't and we don't any evidence
That's favoritism, you know?
The superiors already knew this
This matter should be immediately released to the media
The suspect is police officer
This cannot be covered up
It is necessary
You are suspended, stop involving any case wait untill everything is clear up
You've been worked for me a long time, I believe you
Cheung-on been worked for me a long time, I believe him
I don't favor anyone
Boss, suspect escaped seems like we got leaked
Manfred got suspended, this case is handled by me now
Huang Yong is the only lead
I'll find a way to get him out
We release you but you can't leave Hong Kong get ready to be called back for questioning 
Here's your personal, if there's no question then sign here
Boss
Commander Wu ordered your suspension 
Let's go

May, I'm following him building next to Golden bridge, Wan Chai county
Get here quick
Kids are hyper, You guys also like this

Yes, sir
Cheung-on
Something wrong with my daughter?
No
We got the guy with a hat
Really? Why don't prosecute him?
Boss is just returned to duty, he's questioning him right now
Did you kill 2 police officers in the subway?
And you also killed that girl, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Yes, I did...I killed them
Boss, Why did you want him plead guilty?
If he didn't say so, he can't leave this station
He has to escape
The only chance is when they transfer him
What if he can't escape? He'll talk
If he can't make it, we'll take him out
I'll do it myself
Take care of your father, don't need to involve
Your wife is overthere
Honey
Huang
Hand off
Hand off!
Hsiao Ke
We're budy
Honey
Honey
Honey, I'm going to get you out
Sorry boss, got you involved in this mess there're more dents in your record
More or less, it makes no difference
The girl murder case was solved
But you arbitrarily changed the record
Internal affairs will question you sooner or later
Most important that I can see my daughter
How about the gun trafficking case?
I think we got leak
Master, we'll invite you to our dinner
I'll cook
Do you cook?
She does, but not too good
Hey, don't eat it then
Very sweet, you should try it 
I like it too much, don't I?
That's good
Eat that much but don't see you gain weight
There's nothing to do, just running all day
Run at least 10 miles a day
Even foreigners can't compete with me
Tomorrow, run with me after taking off from work 
Ok, without you I'm getting lazy
Ellen, she doesn't like to run with me
This time, I came back because of you 
Why did you come back to Crime unit?
Can't stand those superiors
Police force is a big organization
An organization needs a control system
I've shown my ability to them 
Not that I haven't
Can they handle themselves without me?
I've proved myself, but got unclear issue?
Unclear what? The issue is the control system itself
I remenbered saw you the first time at police school
I thought you were very ambitious
I knew you too well
You're fully capable of climbing to the top
Sit on commander's seat
Unfortunately, gave all up for a woman
Was it worth it?
Look at this house
I really like it back then
I bought it even my wife gave me hell
How is about now?
No complaint about there's broken, here's rusty
As long as you have a roof on your head
Same as a woman
Man's greatest achievement only be acknowledged by his career
I didn't Ellen is a bad woman
But she's used to work at night club she might involve in mob activity at one time
She even had relationship with a gangster
They really strict about this 
That was years ago
She quit after she met me
Foget it master, let's stop here
No, as long as you want to go back
There's still a chance
It's your choice
I'm going to marry her
Let's roll
Boss
How is Cheung-on?
Don't know, waiting for doctors
Officers, Is patient's family here yet?
Doc, I'm his captain, how is he?
The bullet damaged his 3rd and 4th cervical vertebra
Bullet still stuck in his spine
We can't take it out
Also, it's torn his aorta
He lost lots of blood, very critical
What can we do now?
He's still fighting for his life
Did you call his wife yet?
She didn't answer, I left her a message
She ran away from her daughter and husband
What a heartless woman
Cheung-on, How is he?
Doc, his wife
Go and talk to him, maybe he can still hear you
Cheung-on
I'm here
All these years
I always want to say how sorry I am but I don't have a gut to face you
I feel so guilty
Honey, I'm so sorry
I know you love our daughter very much, I promise...
I'll take good care of her
Don't worry, I promise
There's problem in Intensive Care
Find Dr. Deng quickly
Don
I did what you asked me
Please let my wife go
We're short of men just do one more thing then I'll let her go
Wear it on
Don!
Don, I beg you, I beg you, please... let both of us go
I did what you asked me for
You ask me wear it on...you want me death?
Don, my wife...
I haven't seen my child
I...I cannot die
No matter what
I guarantee your child is born healthy
Besides, we may not need you after all 
May
Before I passed out
I saw the handcuff key in the car
Someone must have took it
But I don't know who
Inspector Kee
He was there when you passed out then left to report the incident 
He said if something coming up report to him immediately
Check it out for me
Records of Inspector Kee and Sam 
One more thing, Inspector Kee said
Khan who got hit by a bus investigated the same case with him
Find out what was Khan investigating?
Don't let anyone knows
Yes, sir
You said..transfer from Narcotics Bureau to Crime Unit will have better future for you simply not the case
I don't want you give all up because of me
I can't change my past
But you can change you future 
I have no future because I did one thing
Came this far, I'm no longer a cop
Accoding to sources, 3 months ago inspector Kee was responsible for an armed robbery case arrested four suspects he got three of them convicted
But one guy, he let him walked free for lack of evidence
This's a guy who opened fire on us at the stairs
Base on reputation of inspector Kee this's simple case, couldn't make that mistake
How about people working for him?
At Narcotics Bureau, he trusts Sam the most
Next is Khan who got killed by a bus
When inspector Kee was tranfered to Crime Unit
Sam also got tranfered too
4 months ago, Khan was under investigated
What case was he in?
Khan was responsible for destroying all the drugs which Hong Kong polices collected during drug sweep
After cases were closed, the evidences were stored at warehouse
They got destroyed every 3 years 
The drugs were destroyed this time contained 2 boxes of cocaine worth 100 million
What date is today?
Call headquarter immediately
Headquarter, this's escort unit 
We got officers at gun point on Ice house street request sending more backup
Why did you do that?
I've lost everything
How's your wife?
Seven months pregnant
I'm not a robber
Inspector Kee, It's all set, where do we meet?
Boss, I found Huang Yong's wallet
Got to go
Hey
You know on Ice House street
2 boxes of cocaine got robbed from us yea, I just being informed
You have time, I want to see you
Ok, where?
You go home first
What's happening?
They're looking for me
Don't follow me
Boss, his girlfriend just came out
Looks like she's in a hurry, follow her?
Follow her
First box, 18th box
May, I'm at Tai Hang
Does Ellen do anthing?
No
Keep an eye on her, I'm coming in
Inspector Kee, thank you
If you need anything let me know
Ok
What is in the box?...I wanna know
Sam
I don't want to be like my father stay in hospital all his life
Inspetor Kee, finish me..please
May, I'm at Garage 17 on Cheung Street  
Call Medic and fire fighters, hurry!
I...my baby is coming out
Don't worry, stay calm
Boss
May, overhere
May, hurry up
I saw inspector Kee got away on his car
You come out, come out
You know how many innocents got kill by you? 
Since I choose to be a thief that's how it should be
You should understand that
I don't understand a cop violates his conscience
How can't you understand?
The first time I saw you
You beat a guy up outside that girl's house
What you did that night
It's said everything in your eyes
Besides hatred, what else can you see?
You're just like me
Those are thieves
I'm just doing my job as a cop
If you could find whoever murdered your wife
You'd kill him for sure
You still say... doing your job as a cop? you can't get away
Just give it up
I can't get away not because of you
It's that dragon
You can't get away either
Next it'll be you
This's the name Huang Yong wanted for the baby
Success and failure in life is destiny
One moves up, other must move down
Therefore Huang Kui is the name, good name
Everyone has a devil inside but you will never know until it comes out
I'm the same as inspector Kee has lost to my own devil
It is Fire Dragon

Hi. Package for
Brian Griffin.
Oh, I can sign for that.
Package, Bri.
Huh. Wonder what this is.
It's my book.
And there's a note from my publisher.
"We are returning all of the unsold copies of Faster Than
the Speed of Love."
You guys got a garage or something?
We got like 300 boxes of these things.
Wow, that's a lot of boxes!
Oh, this is so weird.
Look what they used to pack your book in.
Shredded-up pieces of your book.
Okay, that's it, I'm finished.
What are you talking about?
I'm-I'm finished.
I'm done. It's over.
Clearly, I am not meant to be a writer.
I have tried and I have tried, and nothing has worked out.
I... put my heart out there, and it keeps getting stomped on.
Well, that's it, no more.
I-I-I'm done writing.
What? Writing's the only thing that's giving your alcoholism any credibility.
Ooh, hey, you know, I just thought of something, hold on a sec.
I bought a vase last week and it's still in the box, and I just want to check to see what they used to pack it...
Ah, it's your book!
Oh, my God, this gets me so angry!
What? What is it?
Look at this.
The number-one book on The New
York Times Bestseller list is Dream Your Way to
Spiritual Joy by Pauly Shore.
This is why nobody bought my damn book.
You know, this is what they want.
The Secret.
Chicken Soup for the Soul.
The Purpose Driven Life.
I-I tell ya, I could crap one of those things out in a night.
I'm gonna tell Mom you said "crap."
No, I mean it. I could do it in three hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.
Well, why don't you? Believe me, I would love to, just to make a point, but I... I've given up writing.
Yes, but you cared about what you wrote before.
You don't care about this, so what does it matter?
Well, you do have a point.
All right. Maybe I will.
Oh, how fun. Can
I watch you write it?
I don't know, Stewie,
I kind of like to write in solitude.
No, no, I promise, I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.
MAN:
Ah, this is great.
I can finally be alone
with my thoughts.
Wait, I've got it.
Predator versus Batman.
Why has no one done this?
I need a pen, where's a pen?
Oh, right, I can't move.
That's okay, I'll remember it.
I mean, I can't forget a
million-dollar idea like that.
It's even better than the one
yesterday about the guys who...
Wait, I mean
the woman with the...
What was it?
Was she a shapeshifter?
Damn it, I just had it.
All right, calm down.
At least you've still
got Batman and the...
It was Batman Meets...
Oh, you got to be kidding me,
I just had it.
What was it, Batman Has a Son?
No, no, you (bleep) idiot.
No wonder your wife shot you.
And... done.
There it is, Stewie.
Three hours, 27 minutes and I've got myself one big steamin' pile of book.
You want to hear it?
Oh, definitely.
What are you calling it?
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Love it.
Thanks. Okay.
"Chapter One: Wish it.
"What are all the things you want most in the world?
"Use the following blank pages to write down all of your dreams and desires."
Ah. Brilliant. Make them do the work.
Yeah, why not?
You know, i-i-if people want crap, I'll give 'em crap.
And, you know, I have a friend who might be able to help get this published.
Wait, you have a friend in publishing and you never told me before?
He's kind of a new friend.
Who is he?
Yeah, I don't know if you want to start digging around in this area.
Let's just leave it at he's a friend in publishing and he calls on Thursdays.
Um, hey, Brian, when you're done, can I make a pirate hat?
(sighs) Here, just take it.
I look awesome.
All right, I got to go to a wedding.
I'll see you later.
Oh, my God, that is fantastic news!
I can't wait to tell him!
I know, I told you the book was good.
Yeah, thank you so much, Don.
Um... red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath-- um, I-I-I don't really have time to do this right now.
Brian, they're publishing your book.
You're kidding.
I-I can't believe it.
That's the worst thing
I've ever written.
Not according to Penguin Publishing.
In fact, you're supposed to call the chief editor.
Penguin Publishing.
One moment, please.
Sir, I have a Brian Griffin on the line...
Out. Get out!
Get out now!
All right, everyone, I made a very special breakfast to celebrate Brian's book coming out.
And... and... it's a special breakfast for me, too, right?
Why?
Because... because it is the anniversary of when I started to eat vegetables.
Author! Author!
And Peter for eating healthy.
Oh, Lois, you didn't have to go through all this fuss.
What you got there?
Oh, this? It's just a copy of Us magazine.
Can you believe it?
Wish it, Want it, Do it got three stars.
How... How hilarious is that?
It's not hilarious; its great, Brian.
That's a huge accomplishment.
Well, I helped get the review in.
I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer.
So hats off to both of us.
Well, n-nice going, Stewie.
You ought to be my publicist.
You know, I-I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related.
I do have references you can call.
You know, I-I spent a month as Melanie Griffith's loose skin holder.
Melanie! Melanie!
Over here.
You look beautiful.
Can't... hold... on... much... longer... Whoa.
(à la Droopy Dog):
I should have stayed in bed.
Yeah, we're walking in now.
Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book-- no personal questions, all right?
Are you okay? You good? You...
You need anything? All right.
All right, we're inside and there is nobody here to greet us.
We have no idea where we are or where we're supposed to go.
Oh wait, is that you on the phone over there?
Is this--? This is us.
Look over here.
There we go.
He sees us. All right.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Yeah, hello, we've been here awhile.
Come on, I'll show you the green room.
And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say, I loved your book.
Oh, well, thanks.
What's your name?
Sharhooz.
Oh, my God.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Oh, uh, excuse me, there's something on the wall.
Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water!
Geez, Stewie, there's no need to--
Ooh, I said no gray M & M's.
These are all gray.
Don't worry, Brian.
I've got it all under control.
You're a big canine star.
They should be treating you like Spuds MacKenzie.
Man, I wonder what he's doing now.
Now, ladies, approach him slowly.
He can't really see anymore.
I've injected him with the Viagra.
Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work.
We're here with Brian Griffin, local author of the new bestseller
Wish it, Want it, Do it.
Am I pronouncing that correctly?
Uh, yeah.
N-Now, what does that mean--
Wish It, Want It, Do It?
Uh, well, it... it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible.
Wow. And it's nonfiction, right?
Y... uh... yes, it is.
Now, w-which one is that? I always forget.
Is that the one that really happened or not?
Uh... yeah.
Okay, oh, so this... so now... so this is... this is a true story.
Well, it's not really a narrative--
Doesn't matter. I'm hooked.
And we'll be right back with sports.
Okay, you're doing great so far.
Now I was just texting with New York.
We're doing a whole thing there.
I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian.
Stewie, that's racist.
That's terrible.
I'm sorry, do you want me to call back and change it?
Well, it's done now.
Seems like a lot of extra work.
Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00.
And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis.
I just wanna warn you, she's very heavy.
So be prepared for that.
Geez, how heavy?
I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me.
Oh, look at this, your book is number three on Amazon.
Number three?
Well, who's number one?
Oh, it's that new biography on Michael Jackson.
Oh, come on, another one?
Unless it was written by a ten-year-old's bottom, who cares?
I... it doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I... I would guess that it's probably not that.
Well, Stewie,
I can't tell you how much I appreciate all you're doing.
I mean, I-I have been so happy with most everything.
Oh... y... Most?
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even, it's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth...
Oh, my God, you're amazing.
I've been so thrilled with how you're doing.
Oh, great.
Hi, can I help you?
Yeah, uh... Checking in.
Brian Griffin.
You... You should usually do that.
That... You should check me in.
That's like one of the things I was talking about.
I just have to tell you,
I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.
Oh, thank you so much.
You made my day.
So, you still in school?
Graduating this year.
Well, we'll have to celebrate while I'm here.
(giggles) Okay, well, I'll be right back with your key.
She's so pretty, isn't she?
Yeah... you know.
Do you think she liked me?
I don't know.
How... How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room later?
I... Pretty weird, I guess.
Oh, my God, were you... were you thinking of doing that?
Sending her to my room?
No... why?
Why? Were you thinking of me doing that?
I don't even know what you're saying anymore, man.
Just... do... do whatever you're thinking.
Oh, man, crazy.
Hi, um, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.
Uh-huh. What's your name?
It's Jan.
Okay, here you go, Dan.
Y-Yeah, it's Jan.
Back of the line. Go on.
Come back around, he'll try it again.
Hi. Can you make it out to Kelly?
Well, hi there. I sure can.
You know, I have to tell you,
Wish It, Want It, Do It totally changed my life.
Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I gotta tell you, that makes me feel pretty great.
This is just a phone number.
I know, I know, my phone number.
Oh.
Yeah.
What do you think of that?
Um, I'm not sure.
Well, you know,
I'm sure for you.
Oh.
Yeah.
I see.
Yeah.
I'm a little creeped out.
Hey, congratulations, somebody famous now hates you.
Okay, so, that's enough autographs, I think.
Listen, I want to thank you all for coming down.
And remember, Wish It,
Want It, Buy It. All right.
Brian, settle down.
You're worse than that guy from Penguin Publishing.
You want to get a book published, don't you?
Well... yes.
Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.
God, you know,
Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,
I'm not saying I am, but I get it.
You know, now that we have two minutes to kinda let the dust settle,
I just wanna say that I'm really proud of you.
Hey, I'm proud of myself, man.
I mean, I think it's like... you know,
I-I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's-it's really about having the courage to just kinda get inside your own head and just kinda poke around in there, you know, be, like,
"Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here?
"Hey, what do you call yourself?
"Oh, Wisdom.
"Oh, Profundity.
"Oh, Truth.
"Hey, let's, let's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book."
I love hearing about your process.
Hey, enough about me.
This was a great meal.
Oh, good, good,
I'm glad you like it.
They told me everybody comes here.
Hey, there's
Renee Zellweger.
Hey, Renee, how you doin'?
Oh, hi, Brian!
She seemed really nice.
Get over here!
Is, is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
Can you figure out what the problem is?
I-I don't...
I-I honestly have no...
Oh, God!
How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing
Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
I am mortified.
Absolutely mortified!
You should know better than this!
I-I told them who you were when I made the reservation!
Look, I have written a best-selling phenomenon!
I should be sitting in the front damn room!!
Okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you.
And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better.
And you being honest with me, well, that's helping me do that.
So thank you.
Good.
Oh, Brian, are you going straight back to the hotel?
'Cause I was gonna go back...
You know what, I'll just...
I'll take a cab.
Oh.
Well, at least it's not raining.
Hey, Brian, welcome home!
How was your book signing?
Geez, Lois, could I have, like, five minutes to decompress, please?
It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a
Japanese guy who had a cold.
STEWIE: Dear God,
he's become a monster!
BRIAN: Stewie, I got a flea thing goin' on in here!
Where the hell's my Frontline?!
Oh, my God! Brian! Brian!
Brian, look at this!
I got you on
Real Time with Bill Maher!
You're kidding?
That's awesome, Stewie!
Great job!
Oh, "great job," so you know that phrase.
What's that?
What?
What phrase do I know?
Bill Maher, whoo!
Okay, so the topic is going to be,
"Should God play a role in politics?"
Oh, and here's your heartworm pill wrapped in bologna.
Stewie, the point of the bologna is that I don't know the pill is there.
Why am I standing under an air vent?!
Um... because... because that's where...
Because that's where...
I...
I...
Because...
Because...
Well...
Well...
I can...
I can...
Uh...
Uh..
You...
Yeah...
Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
Okay, Mr. Griffin, we'll be ready in five minutes.
You'll be on the panel with Arianna
Huffington and Dana Gould.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
My-my publicist told me
Christopher Hitchens would be on the panel.
No, we told him Dana and Arianna two hours ago.
I did my prep research on
Christopher Hitchens.
I am so... sorry.
I am done with you.
Do you hear me?! Done!
Get out of here now!
Brian, please.
You're fired!
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
Well, Bill, see, I think...
Uh-uh-uh, actually, Dana, if I may, if I may,
I have some insight on this.
Bill, do you mind?
Go, dog.
Well, it just so happens that separation of church and state is something
I'm actually gonna cover in my next book,
God. Period. Dammit.
What does that mean?
Uh, well, if I can expand on this.
Um, for one thing,
"In God we trust" is on money.
Now, what does that tell ya?
Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y about any sort of stupid (bleep).
So what?
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
That's a good argument.
It's a very good argument.
I agree. I agree.
Really? Because I read
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed!
Uh, gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your lives.
Uh, yeah, I,
I didn't read it.
Oh, hey, oh, so you're the guy.
It's-It's actually... it's actually very popular.
Well, it may be popular, but I, I have to say
I agree with Arianna.
Uh, I think it's actually quite harmful.
Oh. Did you...?
When, when did you say that?
I just did.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe, maybe 'cause it sounds like you're talking with a mouthful of syrup,
I just didn't get it.
Hey, (bleep) you, man.
Actually, it, it,
I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot "want it," which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
Actually, since I said that, I did read it.
And that's another thing,
I have to say aren't "wish it" and "want it" really the same thing?
I mean, your book... basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point.
Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a lot of people, Bill...
Well, "help" is a strong word.
Um, how does this help people, like, with cancer or in Darfur?
Well, I mean, it's not really for them.
It's for, like, if you want a car.
How-how does this help you get a car?
Well, I mean, it doesn't with that attitude.
I mean, you have...
You have to do some of the work yourself.
That's why there are
50 blank pages.
That's why I keep it by the phone.
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
You know, what-what the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa?
What is your problem, Snoopy?
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
Oh, yeah, aren't you a sitcom writer?
I'm an author. I have contributed to the zeitgeist.
Do you even know what "zeitgeist" means?
If I didn't know what it meant,
I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...
And you know,
I-I'm not gonna give you, I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction.
You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody.
I mean, yes, Dana has made a career in comedy.
I don't think he's ever done anything as laughable as this book.
Look, all right, well...
What do you want?
I wrote it in a day.
Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours.
I think you're totally getting the wrong impression of me.
I-I was just trying to write something that would sell.
I-I think it's crap, too.
Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now.
I mean, if you're gonna dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in...
...at least stand by your dump.
O-okay, look,
I'm happy to do that.
I-I-I'm just, I'm just try...
Look, what I was saying...
Look, just tell me what you want me to say!
Bill, he's urinating!
That's it!
Look, Bill, can I just...?
Outside.
No, no, no, outside!
Outside now!
Outside!
You get outside!
Uh, knock-knock.
Hey, Stewie.
What do you want?
I just wanna talk to you about everything that happened.
Um, you know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down.
This all happened so fast, and I lost sight of who I was.
I mean, you know, sure, you were in a little over your head, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I was in over my head?
Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about all the things you did wrong.
It's about me apologizing.
Okay, then apologize.
I just did.
No, you didn't.
You just said it's about me apologizing.
That's not actually apologizing.
All right, Stewie,
I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
Okay, okay, there it is again.
What the hell?
Stop with that!
Y-you're right.
You're right.
This is, this is about healing.
This, this is not about how many things you messed up along the way.
It's about how badly
I reacted to them.
So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted to your many errors.
That's as good as it's gonna get, isn't it?
Pretty much.
You can't write.

This is the story of a film
that was never completed.
A film designed to serve
as propaganda for the Third Reich,
that empire infatuated with a camera...
that knew so well
to document its own evil...
passionately, systematically...
like no other nation before it.
A full decade after the end of the war,
East German archivists
began for the first time...
to sort through what remained
of Hitler's propaganda machine.
Thousands of films discovered in the exact
location in which they had been stashed.
A concrete vault hidden in a forest.
It is also there that one lone copy
of a film was found.
Over one hour long, with no soundtrack,
no opening or closing credits.
Only a brief title:
The Ghetto.
It was a rough first draft...
of the longest Nazi propaganda film
ever shot inside the Warsaw Ghetto,
the largest of the Jewish ghettos
established by the Nazis in occupied Roland.
The silent footage juxtaposes
meticulously staged scenes...
in which Jews are shown
enjoying a life of luxury in the Ghetto...
with images that required
no staging at all.
Why was the film crew
sent to film the Ghetto...
shortly before it would be wiped out?
And why was work on the film
cut short in the early stages of editing?
In the absence of
a final version of the film,
the intention of the propagandists
can never be determined.
One can only surmise.
Ironically, after the war,
this film commissioned by the Nazis...
turned into a trustworthy document
for any filmmaker or museum...
seeking to show what really happened...
to tell the untellable.
The cinematic deception was forgotten,
and the black-and-white images were
engraved in memory as historical truth.
From the frenzy of propaganda,
the images alone remain,
concealing many layers of reality.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
Two and a half years have passed
since the Ghetto was established.
And in three months, many of those
we see here will be sent to their death.
Here are images in which these people
are still fighting for their lives.
What the film doesn't tell is that nearly
half a million Jews were trapped here...
in a walled-in area
of less than three square miles,
in conditions
of unparalleled overcrowding,
plagued by hunger and typhus.
The Ghetto housed not only
the many Jews of Warsaw,
but also thousands of Jewish refugees...
deported from all corners of the Reich,
with no possessions, no language,
no chance to survive.
Those who were caught smuggling
food or attempting to escape...
were immediately captured and shot.
And, as in every other ghetto, here, too,
the Nazis had set up a Judenrat...
a Jewish council...
appointing as its head Adam Czerniakow,
whose job was to manage
for them from inside...
what had essentially become the holding
pen before the final destination.
As he fought a losing battle
to save all he possibly could,
Czerniakow insisted on documenting
the events of his life...
day by day, with urgency,
in nine diary notebooks.
And even as time was running out,
he made a point of writing extensively
about the shooting of this film...
and of his part in it...
an actor playing himself,
unaware how his role will end.
May 3, 1942...
At 10 a.m. The propaganda crew arrived.
They started to take
pictures in my office.
First, they staged a scene of rabbis
and petitioners entering my office, etc.
Then they removed
all the paintings and charts...
and brought in a nine-armed
candlestick with all the candles lit.
May 7, 1942...
On the streets, they are filming Jews.
Oh God!
What if I see someone I know?
I keep thinking that among all these people,
I might see my mother walking.
Leszno, the main street, was full of traffic.
I remember that once they filmed people.
Germans would often show up, usually for unpleasant reasons and usually shooting.
So, when they were filming, it was much more positive.
Anyhow, it was never good news when Germans showed up.
By this time in the Ghetto,
I was independent.
I was already 8 or 9 years old.
My mother let me play in the courtyard, and I went to all sorts of places by myself.
So, yes, I saw them filming.
They filmed beggars and all sorts of passersby.
At the time, I didn't realize that they had deliberate intentions.
But of course they did.
May 14, 1942...
The film crew is still
very much in evidence.
They are filming both the luxury
and the extreme poverty.
When I returned home at 4 o'clock,
I found uniformed filmmakers, etc.
They decided to film in our apartment.
I requested that a couple
be engaged as actors.
They placed a sign on the door
with something written on it.
Two women and a male "lover"
were brought to the apartment...
and they started filming.
In the meantime,
an old Jew with a Vandyke beard...
was seized on the street.
He sat in my apartment for hours,
but his photogenic qualities
were not used.
I can imagine what happened
when he returned home...
and tried to tell his wife
that he had earned nothing...
while waiting for three hours
to be a "star."
I wonder whether I will ever meet you,
my professional colleague.
Did we not both miss our destiny?
What on earth?
Where did one ever see a flower?
We would have eaten the flower.
Who could stay in their private apartment... with their furniture and their teapot? Who?
Only the privileged, like Czerniakow.
Jewish families weren't allowed to live in more than one room.
So, we took all the belongings we still had... and squeezed into one room.
At the same time, a family we had never met before... suddenly took over my parents' bedroom.
When they reduced the area of the Ghetto, we got expelled from our home, and we had to find a new place to live within two days.
We found a place and started to take our belongings there.
We were given a room and a kitchen.
And my father hired a man who had a cart with no horse.
Once, as we were pushing the cart... loaded with our possessions back and forth, we saw them filming near "Femina."
When we realized that we were in their way, my father got scared and let go of the reins.
The German jumped on him and beat him... until he fell down and the cart rolled away.
I started screaming like crazy.
My father was lying on the ground.
"Stop screaming," he said,
"or they'll beat you too!"
I put my hand over my mouth and stopped screaming, and the Germans left us alone and continued filming.
I looked up and saw two men... standing by a camera tripod.
They were filming outside.
The Ghetto was not a comfortable
work environment...
for the S.S. Officers who carried out
its step-by-step destruction.
They set up their headquarters
outside the Ghetto walls,
in the Brühl Palace,
located in the Aryan part of Warsaw.
In May 1942, their commander was the young
Kommissar S.S. Officer Heinz Auerswald,
who submitted to his superiors
weekly reports.
He described the developments
in the Ghetto,
including executions
he himself had ordered,
in the passive voice,
as though these things
happened by themselves.
Weekly Report, May 5, 1942:
The filming currently underway
in the Ghetto continues,
despite the lack of cooperation
by the inhabitants.
During the filming in the Ghetto,
there was an upheaval
in the Jewish prison.
When the film crew showed up...
with representatives
of the Jewish Council,
panic broke out among the prisoners.
Those imprisoned for leaving
the Ghetto illegally were convinced...
that they were about to be executed.
Women and children fainted.
Everyone calmed down...
only after the real purpose
of the visit became clear.
May 19, 1942...
Waiting for Auerswald's
phone call about the film.
In the afternoon,
a hall was prepared for filming...
where a ball with champagne
is to be held tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
"The Ladies"are to wear evening dresses.
A messenger arrived
with instructions...
that I am to play the role of the host.
I called Auerswald,
who forbade me to perform.
He said that I should be
at the community center at 7:30,
as something might still change.
This means that the matter
has not yet been settled.
Will I have the strength to acquit
myself honorably from this affair?
Later I saw a hearse full of flowers...
taken from the cemetery
to the ballroom.
The city is full of rumors
about deportations.
They are talking
about tens of thousands.
Purposeful work under such
conditions is admirable,
and yet we do it every day.
For years, researchers tried to discover
who had made this film,
but none of the files...
not one of the documents they uncovered...
could solve the mystery.
Only later, in the 1960s, a lead was
discovered in the Warsaw City Archives.
It was a German entry permit
to the Ghetto,
issued at the time
of the shooting of the film.
A single document that disclosed one name:
Willy Wist,
along with his profession: Cameraman.
Willy Wist, who gave up filming
right after the war...
and became a scrap-metal merchant,
took great pains to cover his tracks,
burning copies of films
he had shot during the war.
Of all those involved,
he was the only one to be exposed.
Years later, when the German courts began
to prosecute local war criminals,
including the lawyer, former S.S.
Kommissar of the Warsaw Ghetto,
Heinz Auerswald, Wist was
among those called on to testify.
Court transcripts record exactly
what he was asked and what he replied,
providing for the first time a point
of view of the man behind the camera.
Herr Wist, the court would like to know... whether you were ever assigned to the Warsaw Ghetto during the war.
Yes.
In 1942, I was sent there from Berlin with three other reporters, cameramen and photographers.
We were stationed in Warsaw.
I worked there as a cameraman.
When exactly was this?
Probably in the winter of'41 -'42.
Herr Wist, allow me to refresh your memory.
This is your entry permit to Warsaw.
It is probably true that I was in Warsaw in May 1942.
I most likely said winter because...
I remember being in Warsaw... when nature was still hibernating.
Did you or your colleagues have any idea... what awaited you in the Warsaw Ghetto?
On our way to Warsaw, we cameramen... had no idea what awaited us there.
Like many times before, we were simply told curtly that we should film there.
I clearly remember filming trade on the streets.
We also filmed... street scenes... and overcrowded houses.
In this context,
I remember being told to film... a large pile of feces in the courtyard of one of the buildings.
I remember thinking to myself... that either because of the winter... or because of the overcrowding, the sanitary installations had stopped working.
Do you see the garbage?
People would throw their garbage out of their windows... because they were too weak to go downstairs.
Hungry people become apathetic.
They don't care anymore.
The piles of garbage are real.
I was ten years old at the time.
I was actually the dominant figure of my family.
Mother would send me to the Warsaw municipal garbage dump, and when I'd return home,
I saw how they were eating what I had brought.
May 5, 1942...
In the afternoon,
the filmmakers were busy...
in the bedroom of Zabludowsky's neighbors.
They brought in a woman who had
to put on lipstick in front of a mirror.
In addition to all this, there are
persistent rumors about deportations,
which appear not to be unfounded.
Kommissar Auerswald ordered us
to provide a contingent of 900 people...
to leave tomorrow for an unknown camp.
Have you met the Kommissar in charge of the Jewish quarter, Dr. Auerswald?
I am not familiar with this name.
I had nothing to do with his department.
Herr Wist, could you tell us, to the best of your knowledge, whether the purpose of the film was ever mentioned?
I never knew what the purpose of the films we shot was.
However, it was absolutely clear to me that they were intended for propaganda, particularly because we were focusing on the extreme differences... between the rich and the poor Jews
Oy, I remember that woman.
She used to walk around with her baby in her arms, screaming, and asking for a piece of bread.
I was 13 years old.
I used to smuggle Kosher meat into the Warsaw Ghetto... by tram, through houses near the Ghetto borders, through holes in the wall.
I was always on the move, so I saw everything that was going on.
They filmed all the time.
For example, they brought geese to the market... to prove that Jews were living in reasonable conditions.
This is horse meat.
Not everyone could afford it.
People who had goods or money... were able to buy food up until the very end, albeit at exorbitant prices.
There were 20, or possibly 50 people... who could afford it.
However, most people had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, or to heat with because they had sold everything.
They were waiting to die.
People from respectable families... would take their loved ones, who had died, out to the pavement.
In the morning, you woke up to find a corpse every 100 meters.
I was 18 years old and I worked at the post office.
One day I was walking on Leszno Street... when, suddenly, a big jeep with Germans in it... pulled up next to the café.
A young woman was lying next to the café.
Sixty years later, I still remember... what she looked like, though not her face.
I could see exactly what they were doing.
They didn't touch anyone.
They filmed the cafe and the woman and they laughed.
She was a young woman.
By then it was obvious who was starving.
You could see it on their faces.
Financial Report:
During March 1942,
the following were brought in:
2. 18 kgs flour per head,
0. 199 kg sugar
(white and yellow) per head,
1/5 egg per head,
0.93 kg fresh vegetables per head,
0.077 kg salt (white and grey) per head.
Since 1/5th of an egg per month
amounts to only 2.4 eggs per year,
it is evident that the population
resorts to free trade...
in order to ensure
a minimum level of nourishment.
Smuggling along the Ghetto walls
has been greatly reduced lately.
A number of Jews
caught smuggling were shot,
as a consequence,
the smuggling was reduced.
This is Rubinstein! For heaven's sake!
"Alle gleich," everyone's equal, he used to yell.
Do you see how people were lying on the street?
People lived here.
They lived here until they died.
What's the point of showing this?
To show contrasts? There were many contrasts in the Ghetto.
Many people kept clean and preserved their dignity.
We used to shower and brush our teeth every day.
Our mother took good care of us, even though the conditions were impossible.
People who are not starving to death... don't surrender their humanity.
People made jokes in the Ghetto and laughed.
Sometimes we would even sing.
People did what they could.
That was the tremendous contrast... and paradox that the Germans had created.
Herr Wist, were you aware of the restlessness among the Jews.. when the camera crews showed up accompanied by the S. S?
On the one hand, I was unable to have much contact with the Jews.. because the S.S. Immediately pushed them away.
On the other hand, they brought us Jews... they deemed appropriate for filming.
I do not know which department these S.S. Men belonged to... or who their commander was.
I'd like to point out that the Jews were frightened of the S.S.
There were no incidents during the filming.
While the Nazis recorded
their own version of history,
Jews were risking their lives
by creating in secret...
their own chronicle of life in the Ghetto,
using pen and paper instead of a camera.
Historian Emanuel Ringelblum,
courageous enough at the war's outset
to predict how it would end,
had begun organizing
a vast underground archive,
documenting the daily struggle
and annihilation...
of one of Europe's largest
Jewish communities.
Recognizing that a scholarly narrative
could never capture...
the many facets of this tragedy,
he called on anyone capable of resistance
to keep a personal journal.
Right up to his final days
in his place of hiding,
he carried out the task of compiling
dozens of individual voices...
into a multilayered portrait...
the final portrait.
Everyone wrote: Journalists, writers,
teachers, public figures,
the young and even children.
Everyone was aware of the value
of the work being done...
and its importance for future generations.
Our guiding principle was
that the work should be multifaceted.
Our second principle was objectivity.
We aspired to present the whole truth,
as bitter as it may be.
Some of my friends who know
about my secret diary...
have suggested that, given their
despair, I should stop writing.
"Why are you doing this? What for?
Will you ever publish it?
"Will your words ever reach the ears
of future generations?"
Nevertheless, I don't listen to them.
I feel that continuing the diary...
until I am no longer physically
and emotionally capable...
is a historical mission
that must not be underestimated.
My powers of creation
have not yet been silenced,
even though I haven't eaten
anything in five days.
They continue filming everything
inside the Ghetto.
All the scenes are being staged.
On Smocza Street,
they assembled a crowd of Jews..
and ordered the Jewish policemen
to disperse them.
To achieve a more "natural"effect,
guns were fired in the air
to induce people to flee in panic.
Forty-five years passed
from the moment...
the unfinished propaganda
film was discovered...
until chance revealed another film reel,
containing outtakes...
frames from the raw footage
left on the cutting-room floor.
Images that were never meant to be seen...
now revealed repeated attempts
to stage moments over and over again...
until a take seemed credible enough.
They reveal the multiple angles
from which these scenes were filmed,
as well as the cameramen themselves,
inadvertently captured
in one another's lens.
Do you know who told you and the other reporters what to film?
We were brought to the various locations by a man wearing an S. A... or brown party uniform.
We called him "Goldpheasant."
Can you recall his name and rank?
I have no idea what his name was.
Judging from his appearance, he must have held an important position.
I believe he was in charge of propaganda matters in Warsaw.
Could you describe what kind of contact you had... with this so-called "Goldpheasant?"
"Goldpheasant" sent us... to various scenes or groups of people.
He never gave us any explanation concerning the meaning of our filming.
He simply said that he wanted us to film this or that.
As far as I could tell, he knew nothing about film.
We constantly had to point out that under the given light conditions, we couldn't deliver reasonable pictures.
We didn't have a chance to express ourselves.
We were sent by "Goldpheasant"... to locations, to people, or groups of people.
You were not given a chance to express yourselves freely?
No, we were not.
I know for a fact that the film was processed in Berlin.
We were never told what happened with it after that.
Today they set up a film session
in Szulc's restaurant.
They rounded up well-dressed,
typical Jews,
seated them at the tables,
and ordered that they be served...
at the expense of the Jewish community:
Fish, geese, liquor,
pastries and other delicacies.
The Jews ate and the Germans filmed.
It is not hard to imagine
the motivation behind this:
Let the world see the paradise
in which the Jews are living.
These despicable scenes went on for hours.
Yesterday morning, the Germans
took all the waitresses outside.
The girls were lined up on the street...
and were instructed
to look happy and attractive.
At the same time,
they grabbed beggar-children...
and told them to walk
by the elegant waitresses...
with their hands out,
into which nothing was put.
This was recorded on film, to show
that while the Jews live in luxury,
they share nothing with the hungry.
My mother also wore her beautiful coat, maybe even a hat. So what?
Does that mean that life goes on as usual?
After the filming, these people vanished... after being loaded onto trucks or caught in some other way.
Perhaps they believed that being filmed would save them, but no way!
Their fate was the same as everyone else's.
Weekly Report, May 19, 1942...
There are rumors that gas was used
for the first time in this war,
on the German side.
Rumors about new resettlements from
Warsaw have been circulating for days...
and have created an enormous panic.
As usual, the "rumor-makers"
know from a "reliable source"...
that the German authorities intend
to resettle the Jews of Warsaw...
in the East.
The next morning at 8 a.m.,
all the actors were ordered to appear...
at the New Azazel Theater.
During the rehearsals
with the actors on the stage,
a group of soldiers picked up people.
People started running and panic ensued,
in the midst of which the Germans
treated everyone to heavy beatings.
Since no one knew why
they were being held there,
you could hear
the sighs and groans...
of the children who were picked up
together with their parents.
After each actor finished his part,
the audience had to yell "Bravo!"
The audience in the theater was held...
until the filming was finished at 8 p. M...
without food or any opportunity
to take care of their bodily needs.
When an actor sang happy songs,
the audience was ordered
to roar with laughter.
Woe to anyone who didn't laugh properly.
His fate was doomed.
They laughed as they had
never laughed before.
The Germans ordered all the actors
to overact as much as possible.
David Seiderman sang "My Yiddisher Mame."
Ruth Zandberg, who accompanied him
on the piano, wept bitterly.
Her mother, Yiddish actress Zusha
Zandberg, had just died of typhus.
The scope of the film is quite broad.
The filmmakers are interested in every
aspect of Jewish life in the Ghetto.
It isn't hard to guess
their intentions...
for this "artistic"project.
They aim to capture
very "objectively"...
aspects of the so-called
Jewish folk character.
In front of our eyes unfolds
the prologue to a great tragedy.
Even though we don't know its name,
we can sense what it's about.
The name of the prologue:
"A Jewfilm."
A group of artists arrived
from Germany...
with a list of scenes which
the community must prepare for them.
At that point, even the blind
could see where things stood.
The community had to prepare
a circumcision ceremony, a wedding,
the Sabbath, both in the synagogue
and the cemetery, and holidays.
This clearly had one intention:
To prove to the "righteous gentiles"
in Hitler's camp that they are right,
that there is only one way
to deal with the Jews: Annihilation.
I'd like to read you excerpts from the diary... of the Chairman of the Judenrat, in Warsaw, Adam Czerniakow.
Czerniakow wrote daily entries in his diary mentioning the filming.
The diary of the Chairman of the Judenrat survived?
Yes. I'll read you the following entry from May 1942.
You may interrupt and add details.
Czerniakow writes:
May 12, 1942...
Yesterday, they filmed
a demonstration of a circumcision.
They insisted that the circumcision
take place...
in a private apartment
instead of a hospital.
Since the "actor"weighs less than 2 kgs,
there is a danger
that he might not live very long.
I cannot recall this event.
It may have been filmed by other members of the crew.
Babies were born. Woe to those babies.
It was the end for them and the end for their families.
Apparently, my mother also got pregnant.
I remember my mother coming back from somewhere... and lying down in bed for two days.
I guessed that... she must have had an abortion.
And I think to myself how lucky we were... that this happened in the spring of'42.
If it had been three months later, when the deportation started, we might have all been sent to our death because of that baby.
This week they invented
a new way to torture us.
First, they rounded up dozens
of pretty young women...
and brought them to a Jewish ritual bath.
Then, men were rounded up
and brought to the same ritual bath.
While one Nazi whipped the heads
of those who were captured,
his colleague stood in a corner
with film equipment.
This is not slander. Here is the film.
I now recall... that one day we were told to shoot inside a ritual bath.
We were then brought to a rather old building... which had a bath on the ground floor or in the cellar.
Several naked women hesitantly stepped into the bath.
There were about 8 of them, standing up to their hips in water.
One was an old Jewish woman, who I believe was also in the water.
She murmured something which I understood to be prayers.
These were women who were somewhat better fed.
It was difficult to film in the bath because we didn't have enough light.
Today the Germans set up
an original film scene...
at the corner of Nowolipki
and Smocza Streets.
They used the finest hearse we have,
which was taken by the Germans
for the purpose of the film.
They want to prove that Jews
not only live a comfortable life,
but also die with dignity
and even get a luxurious burial.
No good will come to us
from this film craziness.
But Jews don't bury their dead in a coffin!
In the spring of'42, there were corpses on the sidewalks.
Someone like me, who could still walk, had to make her way between the corpses.
I hurried along the walls like a mouse, and suddenly a car pulled up.
Two Germans stepped out... and a third pointed a camera at the corpses.
I hid.
People who still looked more or less human... were kindly asked to walk by the corpses with their heads held high.
They walked by and came back, and walked by again and came back again.
It's true that we had to walk by.
No one looked, it was impossible.
We became indifferent to the suffering of others... because otherwise, it was impossible to live.
It was so terrifying because
I could be the next in line.
When it was already dark... and I was walking down Karmelitzka street, which was crowded with people,
I tripped on something... and lost my balance.
When I opened my eyes,
I saw that I had fallen on a corpse.
My face was nearly touching his, and I was shaking.
Then suddenly, it was as if all the corpses which
I had previously avoided looking at, were there, in the face of this one man.
It was a human being.
I got home and I told my mother what had happened.
It was only then that I started to cry,
I cried a lot.
I had always been so optimistic and strong, but suddenly it all broke down.
My mother took out some bread and spread some jam on it for me.
She gave me a slice of bread.
A slice of comfort.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
This was filmed by one
of Willy Wist's colleagues,
who had new film stock in color,
as well as his own personal camera.
It seems that he found time
to record personal memento of Ghetto life,
as well as of the making of the film,
including the large crowd scenes
staged by the film crew.
Here is the funeral procession.
And here, the market.
And for a brief second,
one of the cameramen...
can be seen caught in the frame.
Can you recall anything else about the filming in the Ghetto?
In the Warsaw Ghetto,
I remember seeing... a Jew going around with a handcart carrying corpses.
I saw how he picked up a corpse in front of one of the houses... and continued to the cemetery.
I remember seeing an arm and a leg hanging down.
At the entrance to the cemetery, there was some sort of shack... in which corpses were piled up.
There were some 40 or 50 corpses which still had to be buried.
I filmed this shack from the outside.
Today, I cannot watch this.
I am no longer immune.
Today I am human, today I can cry.
I am so happy that I can cry... now that I'm human.
I recall that I had to film a mass grave... with many layers of corpses.
I cannot say how many layers there were... beneath the layer which I could see.
I remember the corpses being eased into the grave on a slide.
Two Jewish workers were standing inside the grave, arranging the corpses next to one another.
I have a vague memory that the corpses were strewn with chloride.
Although I believe that the corpses were naked,
I am not certain about this.
The people were all skin and bones.
At the time, my impression was that the people had died of starvation.
These impressions in Warsaw had a profound impact on me, although later,
I got to see quite a lot.
They preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time.
Herr Wist, during the filming, you were really unaware of the plans to resettle and physically annihilate... thewish population in the near future?
I can only say that at the time,
I definitely knew nothing... of the horrible fate awaiting thews of Warsaw.
It was only after the war that I learned... about the planned extermination of thews in the Treblinka death camp.
During the filming in the Warsaw Ghetto,
I often had the opportunity to talk to thews... who had been sent there from Germany.
From these conversations, my impression was that they were full of hope... and that they expected... to be resettled in Madagascar or elsewhere.
They regarded their stay in Warsaw as temporary.
I am absolutely convinced that at the time they had no idea... what their real fate would be.
Although at the time, the malnourishment of the population... in Warsaw was appalling,
I never thought that these people... would be systematically murdered.
After 30 days of shooting,
the film crew packed up its cameras
and lighting equipment and was gone.
Less than two months later,
S.S. Officers appeared
in the office of Czerniakow,
the head of the Judenrat,
instructing him to draw up a list...
of many thousands Jews
for immediate deportation to Treblinka.
Czerniakow was most likely aware that
Treblinka was no more than a mass grave.
The following day, when the quotas oews
were significantly raised,
he swallowed the cyanide capsule he had
kept since the start of the war,
and in the silence of his death,
signaled his people: "This is the end."
These were also the days during which
the propaganda film was being edited.
Soon it would be buried
in the stacks of the archive.
On its box, a single title:
The Ghetto.
A temple whose study is more than other schools it dont only make promises.
It also fulfils them no matter its building is old than other schools but its study is much better than other schools and the whole credit goes to its principal i dont have any other way dont you think prayer was so long?

Thats why i come here to collect by your age and experience, you are great this school needs a principal tell the staff that there is a meeting in my office at 5 pm ok lets meet at 5 pm in meeting room
Let me tell you what people are like.
An example.
When I was five,
I got something I really wanted.
The world's biggest balloon.
I thought that if I held onto it and jumped high enough, I could fly.
When I thought I'd be able to do it, the balloon slipped from my hand.
When I hear stories about people dreaming of flying with balloons,...
I remember my balloon.
The point is... that those people want to relive their childhood and be noticed... and break out of the pigeonholes people have put them into.
We've been taught to define everything.
Categorize everything.
Bad and good people, skinny and fat.
And people still do this when they're adults.
They ask themselves, where do I belong.
They need someone to tell them what's in and what's out,... who's a winner and who's a loser.
They need someone like me.

Saku.
You want a challenge?
- Tell me.
Make these a hit, and I'll buy you a bottle of sparkling wine.
I want champagne.
Size 43?
Okay. Bye.
The mostly sunny weather will continue.
In Central Finland and Lapland, we'll see cumulus clouds.
The temperatures will be chilly.
In the south, 15 degrees Celsius... and in Lapland, 10 degrees.
So put your fur coats on and hit the beach!
Assa come take a look.
Your fur coat was so uncool.
That's you.
I'll upload this on YouTube.
Why?
- Because it's funny.
Sure.
Besides, I have a plan.
Wear your costume to the bar tonight.
- No way. I'm staying home.
Forget the costume, we'll go for a drink. Or two.
If I have two, I'll have more.
It's okay to stay home sometimes.
And light candles and fiddle with our balls, or what?
Let's go boozing and see if we can hit the jackpot.
Let's go to Turku.
- Why?
Why not?
What's in Turku?
- Miss Finland runners-up.
No way.
- To Forssa then.
I know. I'll go and take a dump.
A triathlon. The winner decides.
- So we'll go out.
If you win.
- We'll go to the bar. - Shit.
Yes, we'll go the bar.
Fuck! Not even close.
To the bar.
- If you win.
Watch out!
Careful with the floor.
Four. Five. We'll go the bar.
This is a double click.
You can't double click like that.
You double clicked!
That's a double click.
- We'll go the bar!
You're a double clicker.
Hi!
Pete, hi!
- Hi.
Yes! Action.
Ready, steady...
Look, Kimi Raikkonen!
Asshole.
These were on me.
Should we piss into a pint?
- What?
Piss into a pint and sell it as cider to some idiot.
It'd be funny.
A pint or a half-pint?
If you think about the word karate-do,... it comes from 'Karate do!"
Karate can do anything.
Grab my wrist.
You need something to say and another cider.
This is beer. - Great.
Want to buy mine for half-price?
Why?
- My friend left me this.
I have beerrexia. And I'm on antipediotics, so I can't drink.
Are you trying to hustle me?
Hustle you? Of course not.
I'll buy it.
This is warm.
- Really?
Oh, you're right. And you, pull up your jeans a little higher.
Okay, grab my wrist.
- How?
The other way around.
Wow.
Please put ice in it.
Isn't that the celebrity bitch,
Cheryl Lamour?
Sari Mottola.
Erotic dancer, lifestyle coach and Miss Helsinki finalist.
We're fans. Let's go say hi.
Always.
Excuse me. My name is Saku, and this is my friend Assa.
I admire you. You're a real lady, and you do valuable work.
I agree.
- Are you trying fuck with us?
Yes, we're trying to fuck with you.
C'mon, calm down.
How could I fuck with a woman like that? Look at her.
170 plus centimeters of pure self-confidence.
Thank you.
- Our pleasure.
I think it's great that a girl with average looks and brains...
Listen, I've got a point here.
...can become the top celebrity in this country.
And that's what you are, Cheryl.
You've made mediocrity an art form.
You're the celebrity wannabe of our generation. - A cider?
Thanks.
A celebrity wannabe. Think about it.
Let's go.
- Wait a second, dickheads.
Spearer, you think you can fool us that easy?
Spearer? - Spearer.
Think you're going to fool us?
Say that again, and I'll beat the shit out of you.
Let's go outside.
- Anytime.
Let's go then.
- Calm down, Goldilocks.
Shut up, weather homo.
What did you say?
- Weather homo.
I didn't mention her mother!
He tripped over on top of those girls.
I didn't do anything.
Calm down, he's not worth it.
I'll go smash his face.
I'll go talk to him right now.
That idiot got his punishment.
He has to fuck that pig tonight.
That pig's drinking my piss!
- The night is young. Let's party.
You did great.
Weather homo...
- Thanks, Pete!
Patrik, if you're not here in three minutes, don't come at all.
I knew this.
- He probably ran out of battery.
A war doesn't need one man.
What if someone calls the cops?
- We're okay.
You think they could help?
Hey!
“Flash Attack“? Why does everything have to be in English?
Why can't it be flash attack in Finnish?
Or Flash Lightning?
But I like your style.
Are you going to help or not?
What is it about?
- It doesn't matter.
Are you in or out?
- We're always in. Always.
Okay.
Grab an arm and a leg then.
Wait. I need to check something.
Sorry, some other time. Good luck!
Where is he going?
Sorry I'm late.
You forgot your beer.
Hi!
- Well, well.
Hi. What's up, girl?
- Hi.
You don't remember me, do you?
- Of course we do. Anna Salmi.
President of the student counciL
Graduated with high honors.
We remember your striptease show... on the graduation cruise.
- I remember it fondly.
You look familiar.
Assa.
- Seppo is his name.
We were in French class together.
- German.
In medical school?
- High school.
Are you a doctor?
- Yes.
Wow.
You're a living example of beauty and brains in one body.
I mean head. And body.
I'm a doctor too.
Whatever the case,... we have to go and refresh our memories.
Thanks, but we'll go home.
- Wait.
We'll party at the after-party.
- Gena...
Kommen sie, bitte.
Warten sie, bitte.
Don't go anywhere.
Really. We can't go.
Citizens don't want to bother.
They've sunken into apathy.
What the fuck are they doing?
What's the name of that doctor?
- Anna Salmi.
Anna Salmi?
- She was in our year.
Why does that Saku guy look so familiar?
Remember that javelin thrower... who was supposed to win
Olympic gold... but instead speared another contestant?
Vaguely. But I know him from somewhere else.
You remember her?
- No.
Never too late to create new memories of her. - She's mine.
Create memories of the other one.
Let's go.
Cops!
We have Kimble!
She peeked at us! Did you see?
And she smiled.
Spin!
Don't point at me.
I don't want attention.
Oh no. A dare.
Tell me to get naked.
Answer honestly.
Why did you leave Miia?
That's not a dare.
That's a truth.
- It's a dare.
The dare is to describe a past event... with a sentence or two.
Anna, stop.
Who is this Miia we're talking about?
My cousin, Miia Salmela.
You told her you loved her,... and she left her long-time boyfriend.
She thought you were getting engaged,... but then you, Mr. Spear Hero, dumped her with a text message... you sent from the Olympics or somewhere.
Before or after he speared that guy?
- After.
It wasn't like that. I called her.
She didn't answer, so I left her a message.
It was a voice message, not a text message. - I see. Wow.
There were all kinds of things happening...
Yeah, if your 'accident' is your excuse.
It was wrong. I'm sorry.
Tell that to her.
My turn to spin.
You didn't do your dare yet.
You didn't tell us why you left her.
What does it matter?
It was ten years ago.
I thought she'd be different.
I thought she'd be fun... and live life to the fullest.
And she was, at first.
- What changed?
We got engaged.
It was half a joke, and then she changed.
She started dreaming about children and moving in together.
She dreamed about houses and dogs... - What's wrong with that?
I don't want that.
I want to live on my terms.
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear... that you are a commitment-phobic stud.
Do you categorize people... so that it's easier to understand them?
If it makes you feel safe, great.
But you're wrong.
You're wrong.
- You're wrong.
You're childish.
- You're a child. - C'mon.
There's a playground outside.
Go fight there.
Dare.
Okay, I'm outside.
Can you see? I'm naked.
I can see it's a bit chilly.
Where are Saku and Rita?
- They're in Saku's room.
Saku wanted to show her his medals? - Yeah.
Rita's fiancé is in Russia 'fishing.'
It's his bachelor party.
Their wedding is in two weeks,... so Rita is interested in other men's balls.
It might take some time then.
- That's right.
You want something?
- You have beer?
I have a brew.
- Oh, a brew.
Have you been best friends for a longtime?
BULLYING
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
I'm sorry.
Bullying is not worth it.
DON'T BE A BULLY
End of story.
We've been friends ever since.
You know what?
- What?
I remember you from German class.
You sat in the back.
When the teacher asked you something, you'd say "keine Ahnung."
But you always got good grades in tests.
I know you have prejudices against Saku, and for a reason.
He's always been loyal to me.
He's a smart guy.
But he's totally unable to tolerate the daily grind.
Ls this your natural color?
- What?
Or did you used to be a blond?
- Yeah, in high school.
Were you on that graduation cruise... where we had the radio host? - Yeah.
I was too!
- You want to talk or fuck?
Yeah, yeah.
Damn...
You ?e hopeless.
Two 30-year-old guys...
- Two nice-looking guys.
Okay. Two nice-looking guys,... who take care of their hygiene,... share an apartment, travel and party.
Neither one of you has a girlfriend.
And one of you is a weather guy.
You can't fool me.
Okay, I'll admit it.
We're a couple...
A couple of guys who want to have fun and enjoy life.
When do you enjoy life the most?
Now would be a good time to leave.
Come. Let's go.
Bye!
So, are you glad we went out last night?
Sure.
Did Miss Moralist give you some?
She did.
We had a nice conversation.
- That's it?
We talked.
That might be a good thing.
She reminds me of Miia.
She just wants to have children and get married. - Oh.
How do you know
I don't want the same?
You don't want that.
She said she often has breakfast at Café Ekberg.
Go take a shower.
We have plenty of stuff to do.
What?
Viral marketing.
Go take a shower. Miss Moralist!
Breakfast at Ekberg's.
"Anna Salmi. What a coincidence!"
I love the way you looked for me.
Who else would've sat at Café
Ekberg for a month? - That's scary.
I would've sat there for a year.
- That's even scarier.
Are these too thick?
I fucking love you.
Really?
- Really.
I fucking love you.
This is Assa Talk to me!
Take your head out of her pussy, stupid!
I've got invitations to the new club.
Call me!
Arja, this has been viewed over 30,000 times.
The weather is gentle, so be gentle to your sweethearts.
Thank you. Prepare for the news.
That was good.
Remember what we spoke about the beginning?
We could do the same thing that we do at the end.
Hey, Lance Armstrong. Nice pants.
- Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
I came to check that your phone is okay.
I also wanted to know you're okay.
- Sorry, Mom.
Tonight's the party.
- Yeah. I'm not sure I can make it.
L. 0. IL E..
You couldn't find a cheesier ring tone?
Hi, honey.
I'm just leaving work.
Saku came to meet me.
I'll stop when everybody believes I'm straight.
You want to see me tonight?
Oh, you're going there.
Okay.
Okey dokey, Love Bug.
I will. I love you, too. Bye.
Anna said hi.
Don't worry, it'll pass.
- Fuck you. It won't.
So, are we going to the party?
Oh, you want my company now that Anna's not free? - Exactly.
You want a ride?
Will it carry us? - I don't know about a fatso like you.
Hey, the Beckhams of Finland.
You're the loser whose boyfriend tried to make Cheryl drink piss.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Who did you screw to get in?
Or did someone screw you?
I'll break you.
- Gee.
You know you can't go around breaking people.
Let bygones be bygones.
Hold that.
- Okay, go ahead.
I'll break you.
- Blow yourself, closet faggot.
What are you doing?
Already fighting and the party just started.
Idiots.
- Bring my gin and tonic!
Going home? I'm sure you'll have a nice movie night.
Let's have some fun.
I had a similar situation with Anna.
We bumped into her, but Anna kept her cool.
She's a great girl.
A last-minute flight to New York for 400 euros. Tomorrow.
I have to work.
- Tell them you're sick.
I'll book.
- No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
I'll lend you money.
When did you become so stingy?
- I'm not stingy.
Yes, you are.
- No, you're the stingy one.
You're no fun anymore.
She's brainwashed you.
You get it? - That's not true.
Yes, it is.
- It's not.
You only talk about Anna.
- Anna said it's not true.
You want examples?
- Shoot!
Anna and I love riding our bikes.
Anna hates Coldplay.
Anna wants me to go back to business school.
She loves my smell.
We like to chill and make love.
This is Anna's favorite wine.
And this is Dick's favorite fuckin' beer.
Okay. But it doesn't mean that something has to change.
What has changed?
Prove it.
Come with me to New York.
Anna and I agreed that...
- I see.
We want to go to New York together.
- Fine. I understand.
But that doesn't stop me from partying hardy tonight.
Four!
- Here you go.
I was going to say no hard liquor.
I'm going to see Anna later tonight.
Ready, steady...
- Your deodorant has failed you.
Shit.
Asshole.
- These things happen.
It's on him.
This is Anna. I can't talk right now so leave a message.
I'm listening to loud sex in the toilet and thinking of you.
I'll see you tonight, right?
Kiss kiss.
What is it?
I was hoping it wouldn't go this far.
But you need an intervention.
Me?
- No, not you.
I need what?
- An intervention.
See you outside.
- Hi, Mirva!
Hi!
- Get back down.
A minute or maximum two.
You have a biochemical disorder.
It's called falling in love.
I have to go home.
- You're obsessive.
It happens when you fuck one woman too many times.
You'll be back to normal in a couple of years.
But if you don't break up now,... you'll have psychological and physical problems.
I don't want to break up.
- That's because you're addicted.
Hi.
- Hello.
You need distance.
A trip around the world.
Arja.
- It's been a long time.
You look wonderful.
- So do you.
Thank you.
- Have fun.
That's it.
You break up with Anna,... and we'll take a six-month trip round the world.
But I don't want to break up with her. - I know.
Who's the one who's nuts here?
- You. You need medicine.
Come.
Guess who can help you?
Il Capitano! I see a gentleman.
Who do we have here?
- Helena. - Hi. I'm Saku.
Lila.
- Saku.
Don't take the whole thing.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
- Yes.
I can tell you're a naughty girl.
- Maybe.
Kiss.
Show me.
- Okay, just this once.
Geez.
Whales can sing to their beloved
28 hours straight.
Think about the other whales.
They'll be like “Shut the fuck up.”
”Don't sing for another second."
It would be like a song playing on the radio.
Once more.
I promise I won't ask for more.
Okay, just once.
Hi.
Where have you been?
You want to see me tonight?
I'll be there in eight minutes.
What are you doing?
Our skipper is dozing on the deck.
Assa. Where are you?
Its me Assa. Talk to me...
Congratulations.
More gasoline!
Oh, hi.
- This is fucking genuine!
A bonfire of the Vanities?
- Come with us!
Cops! Let's go!
Let's go!
Fucking shit!
Those ugly color sneakers are a hit now.
Congratulations.
What do we market next?
Make tracksuits the new trend,... and I'll buy you a box of champagne.
ANNA AND ASSA'S
HOUSEWARMING PARTY
Food and drinks.
Kids are welcome.
Bad news?
Make tracksuits the new trend?
I need a bigger challenge. I know.
Sandals with socks.
Hi. I'm here to look at the room.
You don't eat meat, do you?
Why?
- I'm a vegan.
I'll call you.
You have fiber optic cable?
- Excuse me?
How come you don't know?
Are you fifteen or something?
- I'll call you.
How would you describe yourself?
- I'm a night person.
Okay.
I'll call you.
Oh.
- Hi!
I'm here to look at the room.
Sure.
Before I let you in,... tell me how you would define yourself.
How I would define myself?
I don't believe in definitions.
You know what?
The room is yours.
- Of course.
You owe me a shirt.
- Deduct it from my rent.
In front of the Parliament House?
- That is an outstanding idea.
Maybe a couple of other places, too?
- Yes, central places.
Hola! Greetings from Barcelona.
- Thanks.
That's okay.
Hi.
- Please go on. Don't mind me.
You two have met, right? Alex started the whole movement. - Hi.
What is this Flash Attack?
A performance group? - No.
Yes. - No. - Yes. - No.
Is it or isn't it?
- It is.
I don't want to define it in any way.
- I'll define it.
There's no need to.
- I'll define it.
I'm pissed off... because people don't realize what is happening around them.
I want people to wake up and see things from a new perspective.
You don't have to live your life with blinders over your eyes.
I'll be happy to nudge people in the right direction.
There is one question I want to ask.
What will be left in the world when we die?
For me, this is about leaving a mark in history.
I want to distinguish myself from the masses. - I see.
And now you're leaving your mark with these posters?
In a way...
If I wanted to leave a mark,
I'd leave a real brand.
What do you mean?
- What would it be?
Remember the Brazilian priest who tried to fly with balloons?
Yes, he failed and died.
But he will be remembered forever.
A lot longer than this mundane crap.
This is a great idea, but take it further.
His idea is an old one.
We have a summerhouse by the sea...
Oh, hi!
What's up?
The maestro himself. Hi!
- Nice house.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
You think I've fucking missed you?
Huh?
Saku, where are you?
I'm glad you came.
It's been a long time...
We'll talk later.
- Sure.
Where's her husband?
- He's in the garden.
He's that wealthy-looking
Captain America.
I'm bored.
Let's go to my place.
Vilma's having a party.
Congratulations on your new home!
- Thanks, Miia.
Hi, Miia. You look good.
That went well.
How are you, chief?
Really great.
- That's nice to hear.
Stay strong.
Nice seeing you.
Assa, let's get the fuck out of here.
That didn't go so well.
- Should we go?
You don't have to leave.
I promised Vilma
I'd drop by at her party.
I can't leave.
I can't leave my party.
- Geez, what a doormat.
Come with me. - I won't.
- Okay, don't come with me.
I won't!
You know where to find me.
It's unbelievable that there are guys... who think they can do whatever they want.
If I had done the same,...
I probably would've killed myself.
What are you talking about?
- Your friend. The spearer.
You think he should've killed himself?
You know what he did to Miia.
Based on what Anna has told Miia,... he hasn't changed.
- That's right.
At least not for the better.
He should accept that he's not a star anymore.
...die.
A great party!
- Hi. Was your party good?
A garden swing, children, non-alcoholic punch.
Megalikes.
Eerika!
You have to get rid of your polo shirt.
Make him...
...Japanese.
Let's destroy apathy.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's not follow the masses.
Friends, let's aim higher.
Let's destroy apathy.
I lived like you when I first moved to Helsinki.
But I was twenty! Twenty!
Soon I'll be thirty, and
I want to move forward in life.
I don't want to be part of that lifestyle.
What do you mean?
You want to break up with me?
What do you mean?
I want a man, not a teenage boy.
- I want to be that man.
I am that man.
Okay, I won't see Saku anymore.
I don't want you to abandon your friends. Can't you see...
Can't you...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I don't want to live without you.
What?
I don't want to live without you.
Marry me.
Are you serious?
What?
I went to my best friend's party last night. Did you?
In a way, he's right.
You have to do what feels right.
Destroying is easy. Building is hard.
The idea is that we should build something surprising... that will encourage others to build something new.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's get going!
The afterparty is downtown.
Let's move.
Oh yeah.
Assa!
My brother.
How did the rest of the party go?
- Really good. I punched Pan...
Good. What did Anna say?
- She threw a fit.
Really? Don't tell me she left you.
I'm sorry.
It would be terrible if you broke up.
I proposed to her.
What?
I got down on my knees and the whole works. - Why?
Because I love her.
Wait a minute.
You're screwing with me.
- I want you to be my best man.
Nothing will change. I promise.
How about congratulations or something like that?
Friends usually congratulate...
That's it. Now we'll wait for an Indian summer.
Thank you. It's a wrap.
Indian summer. Indian summer.
See you at the café.
I'll give you a feather.
Don't shake your head like that.
You're not going anywhere!
- Wonderful!
You're a naughty boy.
- Yes, I've been so naughty.
Get in and we'll go.
- Hurry up!
Ladies and not so ladylike ladies!
Lance Armstrong!
Weather homo.
Ls Anna really worth all this?
- Yes.
I'm sitting there with my dick out,... drinking beer and watching porn on TV...
Chief, why don't you just shut up.
Let's change the subject.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Night Club Kaivohuone.
Hi.
I know. I'll call my friend.
His dad is someone big in Moscow.
He said I can borrow his airplane.
We'll party in Moscow.
- Sure, spearer.
You talk big, but no one has taken you seriously in years.
That's right.
My wife Rita said you're the biggest loser she's ever met.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I thought your wife was in love with me... because she begged for more sex at Assa's party.
You didn't know that I fucked your wife... in her bachelorette party?
“Oh my gosh.”
“Oh my gosh.”
Hold this.
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
- Too bad.
Tele and Tubby started this!
Come and try again!
Come here!
Peace.
Let it go. Assa?
I've had enough getting kicked out of bars.
This was meant to happen.
- You mean this?
You think your bachelor party is over?
Well, I've still got a couple of intact organs.
Thanks for the bachelor party.
You're welcome.
You ever think about where this train is going? - Yes.
I think about it all the time.
Ever since that accident,...
I've asked myself if there's any sense in all this.
Does there need to be sense?
Can't we just be? Let life guide you.
I'll ask one last time.
Please, don't do this to yourself.
Don't become a dog.
Think really hard if Anna is worth it.
Yes, she is.
No, she's not.
Shit. I was supposed to see Saku.
- Today?
What do I tell him?
Hi. - Where are you?
Your beer is getting cold.
I'm sorry.
Something came up...
Do you have time next week?
Do I have time?
Let me check my calendar.
I have all kinds of things,... but I think I'll be able to fit you.
I'm really sorry.
This isn't about you.
Please, do me a favor... and stop talking to me like you talk to women.
Anna is ovulating.
We're making a baby.
Anna is ovulating.
They're making a baby.
That's beautiful.
I won't bother you any longer.
Please continue. Bye.
He didn't like that.
Assa flaked out again?
- They're trying to have a baby.
You want to take a last-minute flight somewhere? - Okay.
Really?
Always.
A contest.
Who comes up with the yuckiest shot?
Whoever pukes first loses. - Okay.
C. 0. C. K.
Wow, this is fresh!
- You're perfect.
Let's get married.
- Oh, honey...
As much as I like you,
I can't be with you.
Because I'm a man and you're a woman? - Well, yeah.
Relationships are not for you.
You know that.
I can be in a relationship if I want to. - Uh-huh.
I bet you won't last a month with someone.
Will you go to bed with me if I do?
- No.
Will you marry me if I do?
- Yes, I will.
I will.
You will... You're perfect.
Excuse me.
Can you bring me a glass of water... cause I'm so hungry that I don't know... where to spend the night?
C'mon, don't be like that.
Be like this.
I'm Saku. Can I buy you a drink?
Hi, honey.
I thought we'd go for a picnic.
You remembered our one-month anniversary.
That's why we're going for a picnic.
- You mean like, in the snow?
Yeah, like in the snow.
No, at my place.
You're sweet.
Did you have a good day?
- It was okay.
Were the customers nice?
Guess what I'd like to do next?
- What?
Like, go rent a movie.
Like, make hot chocolate and cuddle.
You know what I'd like to do next, like?
You probably want to go rent a movie.
Make hot chocolate and cuddle.
Travel to Tallinn for sushi.
My friend has a helicopter, and he owes me a flight.
I'm serious.
- That's a great idea...
...but can't we just stay home and watch W?
Don't be a fucking granny, okay?
What's wrong with chilling at home with your sweetheart?
Wouldn't it be cooler to chill in Tallinn with your sweetheart?
In Prague, New York or wherever.
Huh? It would.
You get tired of champagne if you drink it all the time. - What's that?
If everything is always so awesome,... nothing will be awesome in the end.
- What a load of shit.
Honey, look at me.
Let's go watch TV, please.
Go watch TV by yourself. Please.
Maybe I will.
Honey bunny, don't be mad at me.
Saku is really sorry.
Teddy bear's here to cheer you up.
What the fuck is going on?
Huh?
- C'mon.
How do you dare?
If you want to cuddle,
I'll find you a girlfriend.
Are you crazy? - Yes, for letting a lesbian seduce my girlfriend.
The girlfriend you got to get me in bed. - You're my fuckin' roommate!
Are you fuckin' blind?
I'm cleaning up your mess here!
I'll go to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
I wish I had been wrong about you.
You're nothing but a co-dependent loser.
You live through other people.
Like I said, I'm going to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
And her, too.
- Fuck you!
And grow up, for fuck's sake!
Hi
- Assa, we have to meet.
How about tomorrow?
Get back to bed!
Anna, back to bed
What did you want to say?
Nothing, actually.
Bye.
Are you in bed already?
- I'm not telling you.
What are you doing?
- I'm not telling you.
Are you hiding?
- Yes.
The problem is not that he wants that.
He doesn't know what he wants.
Remember that I want a girl.
I've known him since childhood
I've saved him from his choices.
My friend 3 girlfriend mined our friendship too.
He used to party, but now when you call him,... he'll tell you he'll stay home with his girl... and do the dishes together.
Shut up for a moment.
It's insane.
And now this insemination.
I mean, think about.
He's twenty-one and he's living like... like he's thirty.
That's right.
I don't want to go home!
We have to go.
- I wanted to stay in daycare.
I don't want to!
No, I don't want to!
Good evening. I'll give you
10 euros if you beat me up.
Alcoholic.
Fuck!
I think this time we did it.
I'm serious.
- Seriously?
Who's that?
Shit.
What happened?
- Mira left me.
I'll ask him to come in.
Don't move. - I won't.
I don't want to see him.
- We'll go out. I'll be back at ten.
You said you wouldn't drink.
- One beer can't ruin the whole load.
Don't go.
- At eleven.
How are you?
Well, making a baby is a little harder than I thought.
We lost a baby at six weeks.
- What?
A miscarriage?
People say it's common,... but it's really tough, especially for Anna.
Anna felt she'd failed somehow.
But you lost that baby too.
Right?
It's okay if you're hurting, too.
Night?
I'll go get us another round.
- You sure?
Yes. I need another one.
Ring the doorbell.
Stomp your feet a little.
- Why didn't you ring the bell?
Guess who's staying over?
- Hello, princess!
You stink.
We got you a burger.
It's a love burger.
Okay,
I'll put it in the refrigerator.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I called you many times.
- Calm down. Let me see.
Oh, my volume is turned off.
Do you realize how worried I was?
You realize how worried I was?
I'm sorry.
How can I have a baby with you if I can't trust you?
Are you going to do this when I have a baby?
When you have a baby? You, you.
Did you hear? We're making a baby for her. - I didn't mean that.
You should've thought about that... before you made me marry you and stopped using birth control.
You wanted that!
You proposed to me.
You stopped using birth control.
- We agreed on it.
Okay. Let's calm down.
The damage is already done; you're married.
What would you do, princess?
- Get the fuck out.
I'm not staying with this nag.
Fine. Get the fuck out of here.
Both of you.
What?
- Get the fuck out of here now!
I'm not leaving my TV here.
I'm taking it with me.
Saku, take the lamp from the porch.
Take the fucking lamp from the porch.
I won't leave my TV here.
That's right.
This is how we get the fuck out of here.
Saku, let's get the fuck out of here.
This is how we do it.
Come and watch TV with us.
Let's go.
Is Assa here?
He's sleeping.
I want to talk to him now.
He's really tired.
- I need to talk to him now.
That's why you broke up.
It's just "me, me, me.”
There's nothing to see here.
Seppo.
Seppo.
Honey.
This is not me.
I'm not like this.
I'm not like this.
Let's go home.
If you ever come near me,
I'll kill you.
Get ready for broadcast.
Seppo, two minutes.
We have a rain front coming in from northwest.
From the southwest...
Who knows about these.
As you can see, here we have cuntolous clouds...
Cut!
Cut!
What are you waving at me for?
You're in the same boat.
Stay behind the camera or I'll tape you to it.
A MOMENT, PLEASE
Holy shit...
That's a wrap.
What happened?
How can I be in the same spot again?
Why didn't I apologize to her after all those fights?
How can I be so stupid?
Why was I so proud that I let things go this far?
Anna is the best woman
I've ever met,... but we're like oil and water.
Fuck, oil and water...
Assa.
- Okay.
I had something, but I blew it.
- Stop.
That's enough of crying.
I've been listening to you whine for six months now.
It won't take you anywhere.
Stop.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Saku.
No, thank you.
- Don't make fun of everything.
Thank you.
- Thank you if you stop.
Fuck you and your jokes.
Really, we got to go downtown.
Let's go.
Ready, steady... Look, a moose!
Look, Jesus!
You're so dumb.
I bet you won't be able... to get a woman to take off her bra in here.
I just want to get drunk.
I'm too tired to play.
This amusement park is open and we've got access to all rides.
The night is young.
If you lose, you'll get a tattoo.
I don't know what to tattoo.
- I'll do the dishes for six months.
Deal.
Hi, Cheryl.
I've been wanting to apologize...
...for the way we behaved last time and the time before that.
We had a difficult childhood.
- Can you leave?
I admire you.
- I'm not interested.
I'm serious.
It's great that you exist.
You make the rest of us feel superior.
Cheryl, you're a modern Jesus.
You're a heroine willing to sacrifice herself. - Don't touch me.
I'm asking you for a small favor... after all this sucking up to you.
Will you give me your bra?
I tripped.
Haven't you ever tripped? What?
Assa, calm down.
You calm down!
- I am calm.
Of course you are.
Why do you always provoke me?
Explain it to me.
- We're having fun.
Besides, it would've been wrong... if they hadn't kicked us out.
This is fun?
We're trying to have fun with a taste of blood in our mouths?
Why is it always me who tastes it?
Explain that to me!
Move.
Fucking move!
Are you going to move or what?
Move!
Fucking move.
Move!
Move.
Move. Move. Move...
Fucking move!
Fucking move!
There are people who will pick up a coin from the urinal.
Then there are people who will put the coin there... to see who'll pick it up.
Guess which you are.
Well, well.
Superlosers on the go again.
I can tell you're in top shape.
You want to see what we just did?
You should like it.
Let me guess.
Dildos made out of Barbies, buzzing around on the streets.
Let's go home. Let's agree you won.
What was Flash Attack?
Was it a group or these attacks or something else?
Before becoming paralyzed..
- Isn't this your new best friend?
...a big dream.
He was a Brazilian priest.
He tried to break the record for flying with helium-filled balloons.
That was my idea!
What a guy! I told him about that.
As if that wuss would ever have the courage to do that.
Would you have the courage?
His body was found...
- would you have the courage?
But this great legend lives on.
He'll be remembered forever.
What the hell...
Assa?
What are you doing?
- I'm filling balloons.
Are you drunk? - No.
The most sober I've been in months.
Explain.
- It's possible to break the record.
The priest would've broken it if he hadn't drifted over the ocean.
Get real.
The whole trick is an illusion.
You'll kill yourself.
- At least l will be remembered... for something other than spearing someone.
Are you with me?
Flash Patrol is calling.
Flash Patrol?
You're out of your mind.
People have definitely noticed a group called Flash Patrol
The group will try to break the record... for flying with helium-filled balloons.
A Brazilian priest was the last person to try to break the recent..
Look!
I've never seen this many balloons.
They have to be as big as possible.
- We have these.
Shelf C.
I'll jump out of the window to see if this works. - See you.
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
It almost flew.
- Let's be honest with ourselves.
This is an insane idea.
- An insanely good idea.
Neither of us has experience.
That's the point.
Dangerous and difficult.
That's what you wanted.
- Not this dangerous and difficult.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
We'll add balloons, and it'll go straight up.
This isn't that difficult.
We'll make one man fly anytime.
More helium, and he'll be airborne.
Anna.
- Fuck!
Can we talk? Assa is in danger.
Sure, if he hangs out with you.
Move, please.
Okay, not in danger, but losing it.
You're the only one he'll listen to.
This is a long story.
I would like you to trust me. Okay?
You want me to trust you?
Anna, I'm trying to fix things here.
- No, you're not.
You don't want to be happy,... and that's why no one else can be either.
I want to be happy. - Why don't you stop this recklessness then?
It's not that simple.
- It's exactly that simple.
Assa realized it.
And then you came and messed his head up.
He lost his happiness and I lost mine.
So thanks a fucking lot.
I screwed up everything, but this is about Assa.
He's losing it.
Anna.
Okay, five minutes.
FLASH PATROL
Excuse me.
One question.
Why are you doing this?
Fuck.
This is senseless. This is like trying to commit suicide.
What do I have to lose?
- You want me to list everything?
Good health. A good job.
A good woman. - Anna dumped me.
I lost my job.
- I'll talk to your boss.
Anna will take you back.
- Yeah, sure.
I talked to her.
Did she say she wants me back?
- Yes.
Okay, she didn't.
But she didn't say she doesn't.
I curse the day I met you.
I'm fucking stupid.
- No, you're not.
You're just a little confused.
- If she takes me back, what then?
You'll make a baby and live happily ever after.
Right?
Fuck! There's nothing like that!
I should've believed you.
My relationships just cause tears and pain.
I'm fucking tired of crying like a girl.
I want to be a man!
Are you with me or not?
Always.
I'll do it.
No fucking way.
- My costume and my idea.
You got scared.
- No, I didn't.
You did.
- I didn't. - You did.
We'll flip a coin.
- Heads.
Two out of three.
This is so unnecessary.
What the fuck? Let me go.
This is for your own good.
God damn!
Assa.
You're my only and dearest friend.
Go back to Anna, okay?
You owe it to me.
- I don't owe you anything.
Soon you will. - Did you hear what I said, dickhead?
Don't you dare go out there!
I'm sorry,... but unfortunately there will be no balloon flight today.
Why not?
- Because there's no sense in it.
Saku, I'm sure you want to use the publicity.
You'd get a lot of attention.
You'll be a hero, and not a failed javelin thrower.
I don't have the guts.
You can leave.
- Did we come here for nothing?
What do we write about now? Saku!
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. just die!
That's right.
Too bad he didn't die.
Let's go. There's nothing to see.
Yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Fuck. Undo these!
Fuck!
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I think I should go.
Fuck!
Saku!
Assa.
Help!
Saku!
No. No. No.
So you took the battery.
Fuck.
Saku, I fucking hate you.
I thank the lord every day for not getting on that thing.
People often ask me what! think happened to you.
Based on what I know about Saku he planned it.
This was meant to happen.
Put that away.
Look!
- Shh.
I did it.
I'll go.
FOR OUR FRIENDS!

* Got to find a place to hide my head
* A shady billabong
* Crash out on a cyclone bed
* Maybe time will right the wrongs
* But nothing really matters
* In the season of the lullin'
* Yeah, nothing really matters
* When you're rolling on the run
* Drifting off in dreamland
* Cops and journos on my trail
* Trying to pin me down with slander
* Trying to haul me off to jail
* But nothing really matters
* In the season of the lullin'
* No, nothing really matters
* When you're rolling on the run. *
When you're rolling on the run.
Raise your arms.
Turn around.
What's this, then?
Well, what do you reckon it is?
You know the rules.
Fuckin' men in uniform, unna?
Your brother's waiting.
He's my blood, bro.
Just like you.
Mum won't even let him talk to me.
They brought him in here to visit you, or what?
What do you reckon?
Mum and Candy grow him up now.
They probably tell him his dad's dead.
- So, how old's yours now?
- My what?
I thought you went up there to visit him.
Yeah. I was gonna.
But it's a long fuckin' way.
I've just got one thing to say to you.
Don't leave it too late, Thomas.
Here.
I made it myself.
Woodwork class.
Yeah, well, I can see that.
It's Dylan's birthday this weekend.
He turns six.
Oh, no. No, bro. No way.
Come on, bro. Just take it to him.
He's at Mum's.
True, brother, Mum don't like me more than she don't like you.
TJ. Kudda.
Please.
Shirl...
..what's all this stuff here?
That's for that Five Rivers men's group you wanted to start up.
What do they need?
Uh, just the infrastructure cost.
Oh...pretty much, we need... sausages and...
- Yep.
-..bread and...
..butter and tomato sauce and...
Yeah.
They like an informal environment, you know?
Just somewhere to sit down and talk and have something to eat.
That's all they need.
How's the homework going, bub?
Good.
- Won't be long, bud.
For fuck's sake!
Mum! Shithead's here.
- G'day, Mum.
- What do you want?
I've been to see Mick.
What do you think you're doing?
Don't you go bringing your dirty business around here.
You know, I went to see Mick.
He made this for Dylan for his birthday.
Solid, huh?
- He's got a nerve.
- What the fuck...?
I don't want you boys around my grandson.
Come on. Mum!
Get!
Fuck!
- What are you guys doing?
- Nothing.
Got any drink?
- Nah, not mine.
- Nah, it's the last one.
Come on, give me a fuckin' drink.
What the fuck? Get the fuck off me.
I just want a fuckin' drink of beer!
- It's fuckin' hot out here.
- Fuckin' too bad!
Well, the boys are down there.
Want to go see them?
Yeah.
Thank you, boys, for coming.
You blokes had a good feed?
- Yeah? That's good.
This is our first... men's group meeting, and I'd like to welcome you all here.
The reason I wanted to get this going is to bring men together, sit down and have a talk.
You want to talk about marriage problem, you know, alcohol problem, all that sort of thing.
And this is about...making YOU...
..sort of, feel a little bit important, so you don't feel like no-one care about you.
Well, to kick it off,
I might just sort of ask if anyone want to say anything.
Any of you boys want to...
..talk about something that...
..that you want to get off your chest?
- Hey!
- Hey!
We only just started and we've run out already.
Bring that stuff inside.
Hey! Spider! Howthe fuck are you?
Yeah, good, brother.
- TJ, look who's here.
- Spider.
- How are you going, mate?
- How are you going, bud?
- Yeah, always good, yeah.
- When did you get out?
- About two months.
- Solid. Staying under the radar?
They've got a tight leash on me, the parole dogs. You get that.
What were you pushing in there?
Weights?
- Me best, son.
- Yeah, straight out.
Come on!
You've got to pay attention.
Youse are getting flogged.
Eh? They reckon you're the man around here, mate.
I find it very hard to believe.
- Shot!
- You DO want it!
- No, I don't!
You've been acting like this all night!
- Get outta my fuckin' house!
- You're just a fuckin' slut!
What do you fuckin' think you're doing?!
- Oi!
- Fuck off!
- Come here!
- Don't touch me!
- Come here!
Don't miss that.
Oh! Look at that one.
- Just letting you catch up.
- The 50's in the wallet, Eddie.
The 50's in the wallet, mate.
Hey, hey, hey!
Settle down, settle down!
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, hey, hey! Let go!
Another lucky shot, mate. Jesus!
You're playing the game of your life, mate.
You're playing the game of your life.
Huh? You're on fire.
Hey! Nella! Nella!
Come on! Break it up!
- You bastard!
You useless prick!
Fuck you! Hey?
TJ, what are you doin' picking on your little mate?
Hey?
- Fuck! TJ!
Get out of here, you fuckin' arsehole!
Get out of here, you fuckin' bastard!
Get him! Get him off me!
Fuck him up, bro!
Fuck him up!
Fuck him up, brother!
- Uncle Texas!
- Bullet! Get back in the yard!
Uncle Texas! Uncle Texas!
Damien! Damien, that's enough!
- Uncle Texas, look here!
- Joseph, that's enough.
- Uncle Texas, look here...
- Nella, get back in that yard!
Now, you two, fuck off now!
Otherwise somebody's getting locked up.
Get out of here. Now!
- Alright, that's it. Nella!
No! No! Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, arsehole!
Keep going, boys.
Keep walking down that way.
You mob, get.
Bullet.
Get back down to my place.
You're not staying here tonight.
Go on.
Look, Aunty, I hate to do this to you...
But, TJ, why do you want to go all the way up there?
You haven't even been there before. Hey?
'Cause I got fuckin' nowhere else to go.
Oh, TJ, you're such a mess.
Listen to you.
You've just gotta sit down and sort yourself out for once.
Aunty, I know what I 've gotta do and I 'm doing it.
But... Mum won't even see me, and... I 've got no money.
- TJ, TJ.
- Are you able to help me out?
Listen, TJ, I'll put some money into your account.
But please be careful up there, bub.
Yeah, Aunty.
Just remember I love you and my prayers will always be with you.
You know, Aunty, I love you so much.
You've always been there for me.
You got swimming today, babe?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
How was your night, babe?
Oh, flat out.
- Bloody chaos.
- Yep.
Had a big blue at bloody Nella's place last night.
Stupid. It's just madness.
I wonder when that lot's gonna stop.
Knock knock!
Everybody OK?
Alright.
Oh.
Nella!
Hello?
Hello?
Who this?
Hello? Hello?
Anybody there?
Oh, come on! What was that?
Go on, son, get it.
Come on, bud.
Come on, Bullet.
Come on, Bullet, come. Come play.
What's the matter?
What's the matter, mate?
I don't want to go away from you guys, Grandpa.
Well...
..I don't want you to go either, mate, but...you know...
..you've got to think about what you done.
I mean, lighting fires - people get locked up for that, mate.
You know? I mean...
You've got to take some responsibility for your actions, you know?
Well, what's that camp gonna be like?
Two weeks out there is better than six months in jail.
And they'll teach you how to act a bit more like a man.
One, two, three, four...

- Nella.
Is she there?
Is Nella there?
So tell me exactly what he said now.
Exactly what happened.
Well, the phone rang. I answered it.
This bloke was there.
He was asking for you.
I told him you weren't here.
I said, "Who's this?"
He said, "It's TJ.
"Tell her I'm coming up."
And did he say where or when?
Nuh. He just said he was coming.
Fuck.
Same time you know he's talking shit, but, eh?
Yeah.
He been ringing up again.
I heard Mum and all them mob talking.
Little firebug.
And what did they say?
They just reckon he coming here.
Your proper dad?
What do you reckon he'll be like?
Mum reckon he... Mum reckon he a bit of a wild fella.
She don't like him that much.
I wouldn't mind meeting him.
Hey.
Hey, g'day, mate.
How far you going?
Hey, gully.
That Yagoo round?
Righto, boys. Just out here.
What, they think we're gonna stop for them?
What the fuck is going on here?
They'd better move.
I don't think they're gonna move!
- Come on, come on!
Get out of the way!
- Come on!
- Move, move!
- Jesus!
- What the fuck?
- Hang on. Pull up. Pull up!
That's Uncle Black.
What's that old bugger doing out here?
What's all that about?
Oh, here we go.
We can't fit 'em all in.
Jesus, we nearly run you mob over. What's wrong with you?
Next time, bro.
We can't fit you all in.
You'll have to try the next car coming there.
Hey, Uncle Black, what you doin' here?
Trying to go home.
I want a lift to Five Rivers.
Hop in. Jump in the back.
Hello, my boy.
I think I know you.
Hey.
You got a smoke?
They've been, sort of, smoking ganja and drinking and running amok, you know?
One boy there - petrol-sniffer.
Keep an eye on that one.
And that other boy there with the black shirt with that...
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little granny, that one.
I don't want you and Harry to pull up on him.
Be a little bit fuckin' hard on him, you know?
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't ease up on him.
Look at this shit!
I don't even want to go outside anymore.
Bullet's gone to the fuckin' camp
'cause he's a run-amok kid and everything's just falling apart.
Why do you think that is?
Why do you think your son is running around at night like a madman?
'Cause he's a little shit!
I feel like slapping you, girl.
You want to wise up.
And you want to wise up real quick.
OK.
No, don't be rough with the swag.
You're gonna sleep on that.
OK, take your stump and sit down.
OK?
Hey, you know... you know why you're here?
'Cause you've been mucking around.
That's why you're here. You know?
What about you?
What are you in trouble for?
You been chasin' girls? Huh?
Stealing in a shop.
Robbing a shop?
I don't know what we're gonna do with you.
What about you, Bullet?
What have you done wrong?
- Lighting fire.
- Lighting fire!
You know, that's a serious thing too.
Well, we're gonna be walking through countries.
Over these creeks, over them hills.
There mightn't be any water, but...
..we'll survive.
You see lovely country, you know, when you get up on top of the hill, looking down.
Sleeping in the bush, you can hear the dingoes howling at night.
And get up in the morning and you hear the birds calling out.
People call it desert, but to us, it's lovely to see the place our grandfathers and grandmothers come from.
We're trying to save you blokes from going to jail, you know?
That's why you're here.
You alright, my boy?
Hello, young fella. You look worried.
What's the matter, my boy?
You got trouble anywhere?
Young fella, you must be got family trouble, look like.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Wouldn't know where to start to tell you.
I got a little man inside of me with an axe.
And that little man,
I like to keep him quiet...
..but sometimes I've got no control over it.
I fuckin' just wish there was...
I got this fuckin' little man inside of me with this fuckin' axe.
This is very, very hard country.
As we move along, we've got to find something to eat.
And that's the only way we're gonna survive here, you know?
Don't think there's no tucker.
We've got to find it.
You can get a goanna.
You can get a snake.
You boys know that we've got nothing on us, so, um...we've got a long way to go.
Oh! Shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get him.
I remember very, very clear...
..this old grandfather of mine, a bloke called Nebatabiji.
I remember this day, he's carrying me.
I must have been about five, six.
And he was a big man.
He had dogs running out, chasing kangaroos.
And this one kangaroo come straight for him.
And the kangaroo must have been coming about 1 00 miles an hour.
He got the spear hooked up on a woomera.
Threw it from the hip shooter.
He got that kangaroo right through the chest.
And I said to myself, "Jingo!
"One day, I'm gonna be like this man."
So I grew up trying to be somebody like him.
Hey, look at them mad bastards!
Hey! That my gully car.
My nephew car.
Pull up! Pull up!
- Hey, what happening, gully?
- Hello, gully.
Oh, we just here making a bit of dust.
- How you like that?
- We can come with you?
- No worries. Yeah.
- Jump on!
- Oh! Shit.
Bloody good, yeah! Whoo!
Fuckin' oath. Fuckin' oath!
We go dancing tonight or what, Unc?
* Mama says she want to dry her eyes
* She don't like crying
* Trying hard to forget her younger days
* Kids are wonderin' why she doesn't sing along
* Maybe she's dying... *
Come on, Wazza!
Let's have a party here!
Come on, Wazza.
Let's run amok, brother!
Fuckin' car!
- Oh!
- What was that?
- Whoa, pull up!
Pull up, pull up, pull up!
Oh, shit.
He might fuckin' blow up, the bastard! Come on!
Come on, get out!
Get out of there, Wazza!
- It's ruined now!
- Fuck!
Get out of there!
Get out of there!
Oh, fuck!
There goes the ride, boys.
We'll be fuckin' walking from here.
You can have a little bit of rest here today.
Another walk tomorrow morning.
And tomorrow morning, a long walk.
Must be something... something in you, eh?
Something bothering you?
I don't know.
Why are you so angry?
I guess it's my mum.
She not really round much.
She always out drinking.
Alright. But, um...
..you gonna straighten up?
If you keep on doing this, you're not going to be with your family.
You're gonna be locked up all the time.
Hello, hello, my brother.
Hey, bro.
What happened here?
Those young fellas give us lift, me and this young fella here.
And then it blow up on us.
Is that Wazza's car?
Yeah.
Where's all the piss?
All got burnt up in his motor car.
We can get a lift?
Yeah.
Alright.
Jimmy!
How are you, fella?
What are you doing up here, mate?
Just cruising. Passing through.
You don't look like you're from up these parts.
You look like a bit of a sheep-eater to me.
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
What I mean by that...
..is, what the fuck are you doing up here?
I might be looking for work.
Might go work out in the mines.
Might be up here on a holiday.
Working on my tan.
Scratching my balls in the sun.
When I see fuckin' shit, I know shit.
And you look like fuckin' shit to me, pal.
I'm not gonna go there.
You're just trying to get a rise out of me so you've got a reason to lock me up.
I know coppers like you.
Yeah? I've been in the city with coppers. You know?
Yeah, well, you're up here now.
Five Rivers is my fuckin' turf.
And I don't like when fuckin' cunts come up here and think they can hide away up this end of the world.
You fuck up up here, pal...
..and you'll fuckin' deal with me.
Look, I've got a young fella up here I'm visiting.
Yeah?
My son, actually.
I mean, if you're running from something...
..I'll find out, pal.
Jesus! Fuck!
What's wrong with this fella here?
What's he doing?
I don't know, my boy.
Are you here to see Nella?
Yeah.
Well, I know who your fuckin' boy is, then, boy.
I really know who your son is.
Put your head under the water.
- Yep. Alright.
- Ready...go!
Get him! Grab him by the tail!
- Run!
Whoo!
Last day today, boys.
We'd better hurry up.
You want to see your girlfriend?
Come on, get in front.
Don't let the old fella lead you.
I'm glad I'm going home.
I'm gonna have a shower.
Hello, hello, my countrymen!
Look who's back.
Hello again!
What, you been swimming, eh?
Thomas.
You need to sort out what you come here for.
So don't go wandering, eh?
Hey, Black. See you, brother.
- See you, mob.
- See you, brother.
- How are you going?
- Hello.
* Got to find a place to hide my head
* A shady billabong
* Crash out on a cyclone bed
* Maybe time will right the wrongs
* But nothing really matters
* In the season of the lullin'
* Yeah, nothing really matters
* When you're rolling on the run
* Drifting off in dreamland
* Cops and journos on my trail
* Trying to pin me down with slander
* Trying to haul me off to jail
* But nothing really matters
* In the season of the lullin'
* No, nothing really matters
* When you're rolling on the run. *
Hey.
So, what, did you expect some big welcoming party, did you?
I just want to see him, Nella.
Reckon we should be counting our fuckin' blessings?
The great man has arrived?
I've come a long fuckin' way.
So you should!
And you're 1 3 years late!
He's not here.
He's not sitting around waiting for you just 'cause you phoned and said you were coming.
- Yeah, well, good...
- I only made that mistake once.
Yeah, well, good to see you all fuckin' glamorous and perfect with your fucked-up lives here.
This place is a shithole.
Well, no-one asked you to come!
You know, me and you had that great time all those years ago, but all you've fuckin' done since then is lie to me and fuck up that boy.
He don't give one shit about you.
Have you got any idea the fuckin' shit I've been through the last couple of fuckin' years?
I don't care!
I don't give a shit, Thomas!
Just go.
You're not here to be real and you're not here to be no father, so fuck off!
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna listen to this fuckin' shit anyway!
Yeah, good.
There you go, TJ.
Cheers.
- Cup of tea?
- Ah. Thank you, sis.
How are you, my boy?
He don't need me.
He better off without me anyway.
You right, Grandpa?
Yep.
This is mammoditch place here,
Uncle, this country.
That's a Noongar word.
It means 'the best'.
Bet you fellas have got a big mob of sacred places round here.
Oh, big mob round here, my boy.
On our river down in Perth...
..our sacred site, where the Wakkal, he had his final resting place there...
..they built a road...there, and a bridge.
The whitefellas even built a brewery on it.
Right on the freshwater spring.
I used to go there when I was a little fella.
Throw rocks at that poxy place.
But this country here, it's like medicine.
This is my son's country.
He's here now?
Yep.
So he's...really here?
Yes, bub.
Mmm.
But, Mum, you said that he not...
I knowwhat I said, bub.
And you don't have to see him if you don't want to.
But he is here.
Do you reckon he'll like us?
Course he will, baby.
But why'd he come now?
Nella!
I want to see him!
Nella, you can hate me, but I want to see my son.
You fellas can talk to each other, you know.
You want to go for a walk, mate?
That's alright with you?
Hmm?
All I'm saying is just have a little bit of patience.
He come long way, you know?
At least he's here.
Yeah, it's just...it's hard.
'Cause he's been running around for 1 3 years, acting like he doesn't care, and now I don't know what to expect from him.
And, what, you're perfect?
Well, at least I've stopped drinking.
Good.
Anyone?
Fair enough.
Maybe a bit too soon, eh?
Maybe as we go along, people can start feeling comfortable in saying something.
We'll try again next week, eh?
It's good.
So, where's
TJ and Bullet today?
Watching the footy.
That's what my husband used to do with his sons.
- Watch the footy!
- That's true, Aunty.
- That's right.
They might have even said a few words to each other by now.
* Catfish swimming
* In the brown water mud
* Salt water running
* Through the fresh river flood... *
You know what?
I heard you've got to watch out for the crocs, eh?
You get pretty big crocs up here?
- Mmm.
- I've never seen a crocodile.
You've got a deadly haircut there.
Who does your hair?
Me and my mates cut it.
Solid.
* Rivers and lakes
* Where the rain comes down
* We're gonna wash them blues away
* When the rain comes down
* On a hot summer's day... *
Hey.
TJ. How are you going?
Yeah, Elvis.
And a-one, two, one, two, three, four...
* Dust flies up and it's dry as hell
* Fire breaks out like a magic spell
* Twisting and a-turning like some big old snakes
* Veins through the land, rivers and lakes
* When the rain comes down
* Gonna wash them blues away, yeah
* Oh, when the rain comes down
* On a hot summer's day, yeah. *
I'll see you during the week.
I'm sure you'll be here.
Got to go. Goodnight.
Somebody's gotta work.
See you mob tomorrow.
- See you, girls.
- Goodnight, Uncle.
Thank you.
- Friday night, eh?
- Friday night in Five Rivers.
Fuckin' alright.
* Last sip of wine
* Last cigarette
* I've lived a full life
* I have no regrets
* Oh, man, my patience is tired
* My brain's always wired
* Oh, the pain in our hearts
* Tore us apart
* How we gonna find a fantasy?
* Something special just for you and me?
* Kinda happy but it still feels sad... *
I see you've still got the tatt.
Been trying to scrub it off for years.
Want some of this?
I don't drink.
You're joking.
I'm not gonna bite you.
I'm the father of your son.
Oh, come on.
This is a bad idea.
No, it's not.
It's just two people dancing.
* For the want and more
* A strain on the core
* Oh, now, the hold and the truth
* Is something aloof
* How we gonna find a fantasy?
* Something special just for you and me
* Kinda happy but it stills feels sad
* Kinda sane but a little mad... *
Mmm... I can't do this, eh?
What do you mean, you can't do this?
I mean I fucking can't do this, TJ!
I can't be with you.
Fuck.
So, that's what it is, eh?
I'm not fuckin' good enough for you?
- What are you fucking...?!
Fuck off!
Oh, typical fuckin' TJ.
Got to start smashing shit up.
- Get!
- Hey, mate.
Get out!
Baby, put it down.
It's alright. He's gone.
Bullet?
* Will you rise or will you fall?
* Will you walk or will you crawl?
* Will you dream in black and white
* When you're sleeping cold tonight?
* Will you bend or will you break?
* Will you give or will you take?
* Will no angel shine no light? *
I need to get out of here, Aunty.
I need to come back home.
I'm sorry, my boy, but I can't do it anymore.
I'm tired. I'm sick of worrying about you.
Just book my bus fare.
I gotta get out of this shithole!
You're a grown man now.
You've got to stand on your own two feet.
Fuck ya!
I know there's a bag of shit in your pocket. Hand it over!
Or this fella's gonna cop it.
And this fella, that fella, and you!
Hand it over now!
* Would you fail or would you leave?
* Would you stand your ground and fight
* When I'm sleeping cold tonight?
* Way, oh, way
* Way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, l. *
You little cunt!
What did I tell you?!
I warned you, gave you all the possible chances, and you fucked it up.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Just one of those fuckin' coppers who thinks his fuckin' shit doesn't stink.
Is that right?
- Hey? You don't know me, pal.
- Fuck!
Fuck you. I always wanted to flog a copper.
Well, come on, then! Get up!
That's what you want?
That's how you want it?
I was gonna cap that, you little prick!
We've all been through the shit up here, bro.
And I don't want my family putting up with no more.
That's your ticket out of here.
The bus comes in half an hour.
I know I might come across as a bit of a hard bastard, but, you know...amongst all the chaos and bullshit...
..somebody's got to be strong for everyone, you know?
But you're my grandson's father.
And you belong to us now.
If that's what you want.
Bullet, open the door!
Go away! Leave me alone!
Come on, baby.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see anybody!
Bullet!
That's enough, baby.
Come on. Come out.
Baby, come on.
Nella.
This is your damage.
You fuckin' fix it.
Just leave me alone!
Hey, mate.
Go away. Leave me alone.
Bullet, it's me, mate. Your dad.
I hate you, you dog.
I hate you.
Come on, mate. Let me in.
I said go away. Are you deaf or what?
Go on, get!
Hello?
Deadly, unna, them birds?
What did you come here for?
I come here to see you.
You seen me.
Now you can go.
No, mate.
I don't believe you.
I know.
But you will.
I, uh...just want to share that...
..I've had a pretty...pretty hard week.
A few things with my family.
Had to sort a few things out.
Little...few things with my grandson and...
My...my boy's been like a son to me. I've...
You guys know...
I've grown my grandson up from a...from a baby, and...we all need a man in our life.
A father...father figure.
Um...I've never had that opportunity, but...
..I'm glad that my grandson's father's here to be with him.
Mmm.
But it's good to see his father turn up here, and...I'm sort of...
..proud that he's here to see his son.
Yeah.
* Got to find a place to hide my head
* A shady billabong
* And crash out on the cyclone bed... *
I grew up basically going to... well, getting locked up.
I basically got locked up before I was 1 0 years old.
Getting locked up -
I was in that process before I was 1 0 years old.
I grew up, um, witnessing domestic violence.
I've consequently been through some relationships with domestic violence.
And it's hard when you're there.
Um, and if you're...you know...
..if you end up being one of those women that can step outside and look at what's actually going on and realise that you don't want that for your life...
And even if you've only been locked up for one night and you wake up in a prison cell and you're coming down off the drink and the drugs and...
You know, and then they read in your sheet, they...
When they release you, they're saying to you...
You know, you're obviously signing your release papers, and it's like, "Oh, assault," you know?
And then you're like, "Fuck," and start thinking about that poor bastard lying in hospital that you beat the crap out of, you know?
And he's just gonna be going around,
"Well, I just got beaten up by a drunken blackfella."
You know?
And then there's a...
You know, I'd have...
You know, I'd start crying.
Then it went to drinking really bad.
And it was a choice.
I think the biggest thing for me was my kids.
I got to a point where...I thought,
"Well, if I really love my kids,
I should give it another go," you know?
And maybe change my ways, get a job.
Here I am in denial about so many things, and I'm a man.
Fuckin' bullshit, you know.
I wasn't... You know, I haven't...
I've only just started to become a man in the last fuckin' three years, you know?
Because I was blaming other... blaming, you know?
And a bit of that poor fella me would come out in my drinking and then l'd, like, turn that into rage, you know?
That's why a lot of those kids go the wrong way, walking the street and doing what they want to do, trying to find something, and something they find, maybe the wrong people, they mix up with, and that is the people that get into trouble.
It is different when they get out there in a different environment, you know?
You know, once you get 'em away from town, they're different kids.
They love it.
And that's why I like taking them out.
The first sergeant I worked with, he said to me one day, he said, "The best copper is an ex-crim."
'Cause you think like them, you know?
You know what they're thinking and you can...
Body language, you know all that shit, because you've done all that crap.
And you can only do that sober or clean, you know?
You can't...
No use getting drunk and then getting emotional, you know?
You've got to get emotional and cry when you're sober, and go through that over a long period of time.
I'm the kind of woman that clashes with a mad bastard, because I can be pretty mad myself, so...yeah.
Yeah, the biggest fight
I've ever had in my life is within myself.
And the hardest fight is with me.
And, yeah, I'm still fighting.
I'm still having that fight.
A mad bastard, he's not really, really mad. He's in between.
He can be a good man when he's sober and he can be a mad bastard when he's drunk.
There's nothing wrong with that.
But it might seem to be mad, but...it's not.
But it's just a good...
..good name for that movie.

- Hello.
- How's it going?
Just fine, you?
Who's that guy over there?
It's Volga!
That's the Crazy Horse.
You want to put the shadow film on?
What's the name of the shadow film again?
"Bernardine" was what you called it a little while ago.
Yeah that works.  Do you mind opening the curtain all the way? love that clapboard.
Can you kill the floodlights please?
That's it.
Arch it, arch it. . .
Push your body forward more.
That's it, arch it.
How long have we got?
Two hours?
Koko, Lumina, Zola. . .
Let's do that again.
Stretch, shrug, stretch, shrug. . .
Thanks, girls. You can go back to the dressing room now.
Take a shower.
Two of them, even.
Are you listening?
You can't touch the strip of mirrors on the side of the netting.
We're going to need to see some lights.
Can you come down here please?
Should the letters be in the middle?
Yeah.
Is the backdrop centered?
It might not be perfectly centered.
Is it really perfectly centered?
That's what we said, you'll have to end up that way.
Then you go up. . .
And do a turn.
That's it.
Now I pull off your skirt.
You slide down. . .
First I turn around like this. . .
And then. . .
I help you go up.
You grab yourself and do an undulating movement.
And again.
The same thing.
My body against yours.
I make a gesture, and you move away.
Like so.
Then, arms back with the music.
We come back with a broader movement. . .
And we turn around.
Did you get it?  Want to try?
Lada paused a bit.
OK, Zula, the closed eyes look real good.
It makes you look relaxed, like you're in a state of abandon.
And you change position. . .
Three. . .
Four. . .
Careful now, with meaning...
One!
Three. . .
OK it's hot, you're gonna open your helmet now. . .
Three, two, three, four. . .
You get up slowly.
You're still really hot.
So hot you have to get up.
OK here comes Lumina. head over to the peephole.
Go over to the peephole, Lumina.
Look at each other.
And it's going to change again. . .
OK leave the peephole...
And appear on the other side.
First contact.
That's it!
Second contact.
You're gonna make contact in front of the peephole.
Lumina, you're too far upstage, and Zola, you're too far back.
Again in front of the peephole.
OK come off the conveyor belt. . .
Now give a kiss.
On your knees now...
Body back.
Lower that butt.
And now start.
That's it.
Come together. . . and separate. . .
Now come together again.
Now you can do something to end it.
You need to work on perfecting that approach.
That thing scares me!
Very good.
We need to turn off the stage lights.
Girls, change places.
You, the three new girls:
Stay close together.
Try to really feel each other.
Yasna, you're doing good on the right, but not so good on the left.
Curve your hand a bit, Yasna.
Bend your right hand.
Not too much. Higher.
Perfect.
Thanks.
The issue of lighting is different.
We got rid of the "Vestal" to free up all the side lights.
They were all blocked with black light for the "Vestal."
Now that we don't have the "Vestal" , we'll be able to use them and change the colors on the sides.
This work is going to require. . .
I'm speaking in your name, here...
That we take this opportunity to clean the lights; they have a whole layer of dust on them.
Then we are going to need to really carefully go over all the show lights, with the girls fully clothed, to see what needs to be changed about the side lights.
The side lights are the ones that really give the body definition, and they're the basic lights for dance.
They define the bodies and delineate them.
We need to take better advantage of that.
And this overall revision brings me back to my usual request:
If we could just close the place to do it for a little while; otherwise we..
Philippe, I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
We aren't going to close.
I'd really like it if you'd think it over because otherwise we can't do it.
It'd be better to talk to 
Philippe L'Homme.
I know that he's going to say no.
Well if we really want the place to make a big step forward, in terms of the quality of the show. . .
We want this to be the greatest nude dancing show in the world and we're trying to really remake the whole genre, then we need the means to do it.
If we want to have an opening that intelligent viewers will love, it's going to have to be like that.
There are certain things we just can't do without closing for a little while.
All I can do is pass on the shareholders' opinion, which has been the same for a whole year.
I don't see that there's absolutely no way to do it in a legal sense.
I understand that it would be a problem to pay sixty people for nothing.
A few of them could even do some work, helping clean the lights.
But there has to be some kind of a solution we can find. . .
There are plenty companies where people stop work for a bit . . .
They take vacations.
And they don't go bankrupt or anything.
It really is perfectly feasible.
I don't know, I'd like to find some kind of solution.
I just still think that if we want to have a really classy show September 1st we're going to have to close for a minute to set it up.
The shareholders won't accept the idea of closing up shop.
There will come a time when they'll have to understand.
- They have their needs, but so do we.
- I agree.
They want us to put on a quality show here, and that has certain implications.
Among which is closing for a bit.
Otherwise quality will be compromised.
And I'd be the first one to feel disappointed about that.
I think it's really important.
I'm not trying to cheat anyone,
I really just think it's important.
When you see how effective our "Evolution" show is. . .
I mean, these are pieces we've been working on for years now.
It's really inhuman to give us only one or two weeks to do all that.
We have to have the same amount of room that we had for "Evolution," we worked on that for years.
I can put all my best effort, all my talent into it but I'll still be mistaken about some things and we have to work them out.
I can't produce three new pieces blindly.
The finale is really important too, and we need a new. . . well, give me an estimate of how much time you'll need.
The finale, by the end of July.
I've asked for more time three times already,
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I mean, I'm always trying to get more...
We have to think about what it means to create this.
I agree, but. . .
If we're going to have a new finale, and we manage to fix up the transitions, we'd basically have a whole new show.
Don't you agree?
We'd have four or five old numbers instead of three, but the general spirit of the whole show would be really changed.
If we change the intervals and the overall sequence. . .
I agree with you, but the shareholders aren't into it.
They've said they only want to see three of the old numbers.
- I can explain this to them.
- OK.
I can't say any more.
They constantly say that this wasn't what they agreed to.
Creativity isn't something that can exist in a controlled environment.
I know they're thinking in business terms, but all the same - this is still art.
It's like if they ordered a painting where there was the sun over here and some cows over here, and they wanted the cows somewhere else. It's art! You can't just do that!
Maybe it would be good if you went in to defend your position.
But I do agree with you completely.
OK so we're going to do a program for all of Summer right?
I also want to do "Venus" .
- What happened with that number?
- Didn't I tell you already?
It's happened several times that the girls ran off the stage crying.
They don't like touching themselves.
They don't like touching each other like that either.
It's like, there's a very strange culture here actually.
Contrary to what it might seem, these girls aren't really sluts...
And they don't like doing that kind of thing.
They're quite prudish really.
When we ask them to get a little closer to each other, it's like they run up against an invisible wall.
They can't get past a certain point.
They have a hard tiime acting the fool.
Not many of them are really able to do it.
We'd really need to work on that number, to make it more interesting from a technical perspective.
Zula had an idea that I liked but that we'd still need to test out, which was puting ski boots on the rotating cage. the main astronaut girl could lean in all directions.
It might be fun and interesting, but it would mean some work and it'd be a technical challenge.
We'll see.
Can we see the second group?
We're a centimeter and a half off here.
Start it.
And the third time start again. . .
. . . and go over there.
Then continue. . .
OK you're too. . .
You have to do it all from the side.
That makes it a lot better.
It's the shadow dance.
Go on.
One. . .
And two. . .
Next a little explanation about the shadows.
I orient my body. . .
The focus is like a camera lens, the focus is here.
It's a bit strange, but the movements need to be like that otherwise it's like you have no neck.
Give a bit better definition to the little cat-pounces.
When you do a cat-pounce, slide to the side a bit.
Don't just stand there.... that's it, go to the side.
OK girls it's 6 pm, let's call it a day.
Thanks a lot, girls.
Perfect. Diamond Category.
What restaurant?
"Devez" or "Francis" ?
Very good.
For two?
What name should I put down for the reservation?
Your first name please.
Michel. . .
Can I get your cell phone number?
Will you want to be billed separately?
Good evening. They're going on stage in 25 minutes.
Good evening, call up a dancer to the control room please.
Just a dancer? 
Any dancer at all?
- Zula, I gave you the. . .
- Yeah, thanks.
I simply adore the show. there's a few things that need revising,
Like whether or not to use wigs, but the music is really happy and fun.
It sticks in your head.
What I don't like is the finale.
We really need to work on that; even more than on the finale.
In what respect?
It's missing something... it has no thrust to it.
Good evening.
Thanks.
- It's us.
- Indeed. . .
Somewhere over here.
- Here?
- Maybe.
Take this gentleman to 41 7.
He was in 212.
I hope you like the show.
Good evening.
Say cheese!
He's got to be nuts!
He's a star in Russia, he's a Bolshoi soloist.
He's popular everywhere.
He's got a good physique.
This is really unique...
The ground looks slippery.
They're dance rugs.
Looks hard.
It's really hard.
And you can tell.
Pretty funny huh?
We can hardly make it out...
We see the darkness of a long robe trailing along.
We can make out the white of a Summer dress...
I am but a shadow.
And you... are light.
- Are you in that "Scanner" number?
- No.
But you could try it out, if you don't mind.
There's going to be a switch in scenes.
We might not end up doing the "lnfra-red" number until the weekend.
Did you already know that?
Yeah, they decided yesterday.
Philippe let me know a bit ago.
"Scanner" is far from ready. but we'll try to get it finished.
If this lady doesn't mind taking that off. . .
And we'll try out something new for the "Venus" number.
It'll be more like. . . a Formula 1 car race championship.
Jérôme also told me yesterday that we'll need to try out dresses.
- Alright.
- The new dresses. . .
For you.
You really want to change it?
The one I'm using now is great.
The material looks really nice with the lights.
It's pretty, but there's something bothering me about it.
The material really shines when you're dancing while leaning over the table, and instead of making your butt look nice and round, it makes it look bony.
The light draws an outline of your ass. it makes. . . your ass look bony and not round. the new dress, since the material is duller, it gives more accent to the curves. the light doesn't catch on it, and it's more elegant for that executive look. it's got a more elegant touch.
I also loved the other material, but with the light. . . it's just too shiny. it doesn't really favor the silhouette.
We want to show nice round asses but that isn't what we get with this. we also thought the material was too fragile for constant use. but meanwhile you can use it. but let's try out the new one.
Daisy already did and it looked great.
Come in, Jérôme.
I had a hard time undressing this girl. you can undress in the booth there and then come with me. got anything for me to put on my feet? want some flip flops? i'll get them. you're off time again. the three in back are doing something different.
What Lumina is doing is cute. they look a bit like cheerleaders. . .
I'm satisfied today.
OK, we're moving forward; everything's going fine.
I'm going to make a list of what they asked me to revise; it's huge.
And the finale? is it "No Way" ?
Yeah, today it's "No Way" .
- Tomorrow it will be "No" .
- I'm tired of asking over and over.
- I'm a little bit. . .
- Stubborn.
But since I also try to give them what they want. . .
When I talked to the boss, he seemed satisfied.
It's all good.
I went to meet him and said:
"Fire me; I didn't satisfy my contract.
"I take responsibility, but I want to justify myself.
"There are various problems we really need to resolve.
"If sometimes I may not be efficient,
"it's for reasons that are out of my control.
"We take two steps forward and one step back,
"We cancel numbers like
"Venus" and "Scanner" . . .
"I don't just agree with everything every day.
"If you find someone who will, please go ahead and hire him."
Aside from that, are you satisfied?
I am passionate about my work.
Right now my work is the Crazy Horse show and that takes up all my time.
I see what's wrong and try to fix it.
For the rest, when nothing's wrong,
I leave it alone.
But sometimes,
I get really disturbed.
When I see a show like the one we had last night, where we had excellent dancers and technical teams, compared to other, weaker shows. . .
But even so there were some little errors in all the numbers.
What I'm frightened of is that margin of error.
The day before yesterday the infrared lights broke down. . .
It's those little details that make the show either good or bad. first it was the "infrared" curtain, which was all off kilter, the image wasn't as it was supposed to be, then they forgot to put the lace ove the light on Daisy's butt, so no one could see anything. . . this is supposed to be the world's greatest nude show, and we're capable of making it happen. but when something goes wrong, when we need to wait 10 minutes before a number starts, we look ridiculous.
I'm worried because I know how fragile the team can be.
Bégo talked about creating a hierarchy in the control structure. . .
That might be interesting. . .
I'm trying to do that.
I've got to talk to Maurizio.
But he's not really convinced.
I think Rico should be the scene director.
He's a reliable person.
If there's any problem, people would go talk to him.
When the curtain was all off, it was nobody's fault. it's a rule of the house which is kind of dumb.  Anyone can trade roles.
It may make sense to do that for dancers, but not for technicians. yesterday i tried to explain that to Andrée and the boss:
"imagine that today you're directors, tomorrow secretaries, then doorkeepers, and then the next day you're in sales...
It's just impossible."
That's why they need to know how to do everything.
They have to know how to replace each other.
The system needs to be completely changed; otherwise it will remain totally fragile. it's ok that they should all know how everything's done; they won't need to do it or anything... there have to be specific responsibilities. certain technicians don't know how to do certain things. we need to acknolwedge that and put them in their specific places. and accept our limitations.
Accept that there are certain things we don't know how to do. that's why I don't do the
"Que Calor" number
I'm going to give you a compliment: you're the greatest.
Even yesterday you did "Que Calor!" .
You don't really like that number, but you do it anyway. you make us laugh. you're funny. that's generous of you. it's just the way it has to be.
Today is World Biodiversity Day and the theme of this show will be invasive exotic species. this species digs holes in the ground. the water gets muddy. we have to coordinate the work methods between the two workshops. we can't be changing the plans constantly, cancelling one thing and starting another, a new idea, one girl instead of two. . . these kinds of constant changes between the two workshops were really driving me crazy the other day.
We're doing a half-assed job, and that's far from the tradition at this place.
At the production meetings we don't check over anything, and I don't really even want to participate in them because I have other work to do. . .
Roselyne kept you up to speed.
That was what we'd agreed.
The new dates. . .
It's my fault; I admit it.
Things are just constantly changing.
At all the meetings we almost always end up changing everything.
- But there are reasons for that.
- I know!
- I don't want to waste so much time.
- I try to be. . .
You must understand that it's impossible for us to do quality work here, with the same enthusiasm that we had at first and with results that make us all proud.
Working this way, all we can produce is shit.
We can't just do whatever we want with the Crazy Horse girls.
They do the splits, they expose themselves to the audience. . . the girls are naked; we can't be throwing water around. the costumes might not be important to you, but they are to us.
If we don't have time to check over everything to be sure, with Andrée,
Roselyne or you. . . let's agree to have a creative meeting every week at least; it's been three weeks that we haven't had any at all. there haven't been any creative meetings. as for the production meetings, they really need to be held every week.
What do we do?  I can't go on like this; I'm going nuts.
I came up with the title "Make me
Crazy," but I wasn't talking literally!
I was talking about the guys in the audience.  The girls should make them crazy. . .
Not me! I love working,
I love what I do,
I love the girls,
I love making them look pretty.
I can't ruin all of Roselyne's work, the image of the Crazy Horse club,
I can't ruin myself.
I can't just stay quiet as a mouse or say "it's not my fault." that's absurd. we have to be proud of what we do. at first we felt very proud, but at the end. . .
I don't want to leave the Crazy Horse in a bad state. that was the goal of this meeting.
Either we need to agree on what we're doing from start to finish, and decide how to divide up the work and at the end of the week straighten needles with Thibault, or if everything just keeps constantly changing, I'll have to quit.
It would make a lot more sense for it to be you that supervises the whole costume area, so it is coherent. that was what they asked me at first. i think it makes a lot more sense. i supervise choreography, music and structure.
If we delegate those tasks to someone else a lot of confusion will arise. with the costumes it's the same. you have to supervise the costumes as a whole. as for the method,
I confess I'm a bit lost. . . we have an approval process, which Thibault designed. it's normal that there should be a validation process. you have to approve it, and Andrée and Roselyne do too. all this happens in such an anarchic way, where we were all creating at the same time.
- We need to know who's doing what.
- We are always creating!
We move forward so fast we stop even feeling like we're creating something.
Lumina, these women are like competitive animals.
They start by gauging each other, they stare at each other, circle each other, they size each other up, to decide who's the strongest, the most beautiful, the most competent. then there's a seduction phase with a touch of rivalry to it, which results in a kind of battle filled with love and hate, and in the end the one kills the other.
OK start. turn your hips up.
Don't swing it too much, stand more sideways. come forward and kick.
Baby, back up a bit. stay in line with the others. to the side.
Lena, keep your hips up. don't lower your head. final posture. thanks a lot girls. can i hang this up? let's start from. . . is this it?
Good! now to the back. and turn.
OK, yeah, I know what happened. you told yourself to do something which was incorrect. here's fine. when you pull to the other side. . . don't do a retiré, come right over here. that's why you're getting behind.
It's my fault, I didn't explain properly. bring down your foot and turn. that's it. that gives you more time.
I told you to do it with a retiré, but the retiré takes too long and then you're off time. leg down, foot down; that will help you turn. that's it. and now go on. today's trial went really well.
OK now we're going to set up the finale!
We're going to do "Desire" ! it's fine just like that. . .
Now I know what was so perfect about "Stars of Paris." it's because the three rows of side lights were on. yeah but we have a problem there. we have no lateral lighting. the conveyor belt and the letters don't have lateral lighting on them. but we can get some on there because it creates an atmosphere. . . yesterday there were some moments when all the lights were on and we even had those strobes. . . aside from basic lighting, we'll have to add those too.
Not all the time, but there should be a kind of progression so we get more and more light on there... you guys are trying to do too many things at once.
I mean, we need the lights in terms of aesthetics, and they need to be totally tied to the music.
What I did in "Jungle" , with Dita, was to try to do the lights manually, without recording a lighting program...
We have to record one, for tonight!
It's been two days now that we've been doing it manually!
We can check them together.
Can we get a near-naked girl to fit inside a letter?
Near naked?
Just like that is fine.
It'd be even better if the letters were animated.
- to be frank.
- Just like that is fantastic.
But we can't have everything happening at once.
We agreed to put the animation in with the curtain down.
And with the animated letters.
When the curtain goes up, the letters remain there.
And at that moment, the girls are in position.
Or we can cut off the animation and light up their faces. . .
If you ask me, it's too fast. when the curtain goes up, we can only see silhouettes, the girls are in position. their faces only get lit when they start singing, because that lasts longer.
I understand your idea about the first image, but it doesn't work. we can't put any animation on those letters. there's got to be an opening, maybe with cigarette smoke, that would have a great impact.
Silicone. . .
. . . bust size.
OK and let's see those straps then... they're adjustable but not too much. let's see your back.
If the straps are too tight, no one can see the curvature of your back. for that we need. . .
OK i think it's fine like that. we have to see the fringes.
You know where they are?
No. . .
I'll ask Roselyne for them.
This has to be a centimeter longer.
That's better. you're too close together. try fixing it. . . you're taller so we have to try to compensate.
Try to find the right position. you're slightly off center.
OK it's better if you have your butts almost totally together, but not your backs. push your body forward more.
See?  looks like a sausage.
- That's it.
- Right. Thanks.
Play with your fingers. sensual fingers.
- You're not listening.
- Yes I am.
Diagonally. One arm in the light and the hand pointing towards it.
That's it. That looks great.
And here you lift one arm and slowly bring down the other, as if you were outlining what you're taking off. Don't. . . the movements need to be fluid.
Stretch it... stretch it... and off it comes!
Very good, Liv.
I was always a great admirer of the Crazy Horse.
It was more than admiration, it was an obsession.
I went to see the show like 40 times,
I was here all the time,
I sang the songs to myself all day. . .
And now I can't do that anymore because I'm on the team now so I have to be calm and focused.
I put on music from Crazy Horse at home, it drives my assistants nuts, they can't stand hearing
"You Told Me l'm a Good Girl" anymore.
I'm really pretty obsessive. I've gone through a number of obsessions.
Saint-Laurent, Marlene Dietrich,
Helmut Newton, the Crazy Horse. . .
It's one of my great obsessions.
And when I'm obsessed with something
I dedicate all my time to it.
They're details that
Philippe doesn't care about, he has sort of a different idea about femininity.
I know that he's gone through some tough times here, maybe because he's worked here for so long, with a lot of people involved and giving their opinions.
Philippe is. . . he's an extremely democratic guy, he listens to everyone's opinion. that's not how I am.  I only listen to two or three people.
Maybe I'm a bit of a dictator. . . you're the show's co-director?
I'm the artistic director;
Philippe is the director.
I'm the art director because I came in after him and a lot of the numbers had already been designed. the art director. . . deals with designing the concepts. there were some numbers we designed together, others Philippe designed. my role involves bringing in another perspective and following up on what he does.
Philippe's the director and he's the one that designed most of the numbers.
I'm the art director, sure, but those are just titles. both of us are so involved in everything that the roles get all mixed up.
But it's Philippe that. . . is really in charge. and he deserves it, because he has a ton of talent and experience and a legitimacy that gives him that right.
OK, the same thing now. the same thing, let's go.
Begin. you moved back again. sing with the playback, girls. you're one with the chair.
OK, now, the girlfriends. . . where's the other girlfriend? we need the other one, number 6. you moved your hand too soon, Linda. the screen!
Very good, now they need to go on singing.
There are two numbers that are going to be real classics.
It's pure "Crazy Horse." and at the same time, they're totally innovative. you have to see it to understand. he really captured the essence of the place, but created something totally. . . almost revolutionary.
Mr. Bernardin must be applauding in his grave and thinking:
"if I were there that's what I'd do."
What number is that?
"Rougir de Désir." 
[blush with desire]
Mr. Bernardin had a very unique concept of eroticism. what's yours? the most important thing is suggestiveness, seduction, but contained, not obscene.
I agree with Mr. Bernardin about how it is the fruit of frustration and imagination.
It's the fruit of dreams.
Dreams are very important.
It's kind of like. . .
. . .our brand image.
The Crazy Horse perfected a certain kind of art, which consists in empowering, celebrating and transporting womanhood and the seductive and erotic game of womanhood, in an extremely sophisticated, inspiring way. . . inspiring for women. not everyone agrees with me, but I think that Crazy Horse. . . well, I won't say that women like it more, but it might be the only place where you have nude dancers and women like to come see the show too. we have a really big female population in the audience. it's almost like that's the key.
When women are comfortable with the key to eroticism, men enjoy the benefits. that's my opinion.
The key to Eroticism belongs to womanhood.
Well it works both ways. yes, it works both ways. exactly. now can we see. . .
- a blue light instead of a red one?
- No.
I want to see more colors to find out if any of them look better.
You want to switch over the colors on the side lights to see what's best? that's really far too. . .
Too red. you lose the red on the cords.
- that's not bad.
- dark blue. . .
- the Congo blue doesn't look bad.
- it's interesting, yeah.
Let's take a look at "Étoiles de Paris" .
This is perfect. one, two. . . that's it. careful. . . the last one. . . is Ali particularly interested in costumes?
I'm interested in everything. costumes and everything else. but I'm more interested in costumes than Philippe is.
Philippe is a dancer, and he sees the body as an instrument.
Myself, I'm interested in the way people are transfigured. the way a woman transforms herself into. . . the fantasy vision she has of herself. women have the capacity, using what nature gave them, to use artifices, tricks and strategies to transform themselves into something totally different. what's important isn't their basic beauty but what we do with it.
After 25 years of age, a woman's beauty is something she needs to conquer and build for herself. there are no 'ugly' women, only women that refuse beauty because they deny their femininity. and there are lazy women. any woman with good attributes can go far beyond the features she was born with. sometimes there are girls that are very beautiful when they're young, but age poorly. they put all their trust in the beauty they were born with and don't make any effort to preserve it. they get obsessed with their vision of themselves as young girls.
On the other hand - and you can see this clearly at the Crazy Horse. . . here they are all beautiful.
But, sometimes, the most anatomically beautiful are not the best looking ones on the stage, because they rely too much on the beauty they were born with, which makes them feel too secure and keeps them from taking it to the next level.
The ones that have more complexes develop strategies and personalities that help them overcome their disadvantages. this makes them even more beautiful and fascinating on stage.
It's as if all the love in the world were not enough for them.
The whole city of Paris
Comes to the Crazy Horse
The Crazy Horse is Paris
The Sacré-Coeur
There's a Sacré-Coeur [sacred heart] in every Crazy Horse girl
The Crazy Horse girls are like Soldiers -
Soldiers in the erotic army.
D-E-S-I-R-E
The Crazy Horse girls taste like champagne
Champagne tastes like Crazy Horse girls
The Champagne runs between their fingers
The Crazy Horse girls
All Paris
Is at the Crazy Horse
The Crazy Horse is Paris
D-E-S-I-R-E
Crazy Horse
That was the best.
Let's do it over once more.
- What are you doing, Ma Nahia?
- She doesn't get it.
Is it because you're new here?
Are you Spanish?
I've been working here for a whole year!
But you're not like Nooka,
Zula or Psycho.
Oooh, a breeze!
It's good for you. still, we might catch a cold...
Is the switch now? there's no switch, it's a slide.
- But in "lnfrarouge" . . .
- there isn't one.
I don't really like it, sorry.
What don't you like?
The choreography is far too tied to the music.
Whenever there's a pause. . .
But, you know, it's not so bad.
- It's the old "Jungle" number.
- Yeah but with a girl in back.
This one comes from "Evolution."
It's too bad, because that number's really. . .
- Oh I love this part.
- It's beautiful.
Impressive.
The other one is stronger, I agree.
I like the idea of doing the lighting like they were leopards in a cage.
- The lights are good.
- Beautiful. they look like panthers. you can't see the girl in back! because she's dead. it went out. we could have seen her die!
OK I'm going to explain quickly. do you all speak French?
I'm going to explain how the audition goes. it's simple, don't be afraid. it really is easy. you're all going to go on stage with nothing but tiny bikini bottoms on. and shoes, if you want.
You'll be on the stage, with nice lighting, there'll be music, and you'll have to improvise for one minute. when you're done, come off the stage, and we'll talk. this audition is above all to evaluate your proportions and your look. it's not for dancing skills or acting skills.
Anyway, we'll see whether you know how to dance soon enough, but it's not worth it to get all excited about that.
Pretty, stylish, relaxed. and push your butts back. she fainted before the audition... an ambulance had to come.
- Today?
- Yeah.
Thanks. You can stay there on stage.
Kill the music please...
OK can you take off your shoes?
Stand in the middle. The sixth.
Can you put your knees together?
OK let's see the same thing from the side.
Thank you.
Look at her size... she has no breasts...
That's enough.
Thanks, Maurizio.
We don't hire transsexuals.
I think it's charming.
Cyrille, open the curtain and kill the lights.
OK dancers all up on the stage in a line, without shoes.
Pretty good sample. . .
Sorry girls, please just stay where you are, we need to compare sizes.
I know you probably feel silly. . .
First. . .
- Third.
- Fourth.
I don't know, I don't know. . . that one over there.
The fifth, with the blue bikini bottom.
And that one. tell them to step forward.
Girls, I don't remember your names.
Let's count from the control room side.
That's it, right there.
The second one. the fourth. the fifth.
What's her name?
Olivia. I remembered her name.
The next one. Melissa.
And the last one, Tatiana.
We've got six.
You don't want to keep the Italian?
With the nice ass?
Really nice. all the way to dance tryouts? the one who's always dreamed of working at the Crazy Horse?
I don't like her.
- The Italian.
- That one.
The girls in front can stay.
The others can go to the dressing room
I'll be there in a second.
Come closer together.
You're tiny, Olivia, but that's not bad.
Tiny is cute, it's not an insult.
The second one looks like Kate Moss.
It's true.
She has short legs.
It's not important.
You mind turning around?
And straighten your butts out.
Far out. more.
How many Russian girls are here?
They're the best ones.
Those two are the best, don't you think? they have some space between their thighs.
That's not bad.
Same thing from the side please.
That one's pretty.
Really cute, yeah; and she's got attitude.
Thanks, you can go back to the dressing room.  I'll be right there.
Not bad at all!
It's a kind of apotheosis of beauty in its different forms.
For us it's a real joy to work here.
Sometimes, when I'm trying out girls,
I have to say to myself
"I'm not just watching a tryout, I'm directing it" and I almost have to pinch myself to believe that I'm not dreaming and really am involved in this spectacle of beauty, elegance and desire.
- Does that answer your question?
- Perfectly.
And now tell us in English, with the same eloquence.
"I am going to drown in your eyes. May I?
"It is pure joy to drown in your eyes.
"I'll come and say: 'I love you so much.'
"May I?
"It isn't easy to love.
It's hard.  Very hard.
The whole city of Paris
Comes to the Crazy Horse
The Crazy Horse is Paris.
The Eiffel Tower lights up
Like a Crazy Horse girl
The Crazy Horse is Paris.
All Paris comes to the Crazy Horse
D-E-S-I-R-E
You're gonna dream of the Crazy Horse
Awake in your bed
The Crazy Horse girls 
Will look over to you:
D-E-S-I-R-E
The Crazy Horse girls
Taste like champagne
Champagne
Tastes like the Crazy Horse girls
Champagne runs through your fingers
The Crazy Horse girls...
Sleep, baby sleep
Baby will sleep soon!
Sleep, baby sleep
Baby will sleep soon!
The frame isn't made of the same wood as the bedposts.
They require a harder wood, much finer, with denser fibers.
They are made from yew wood.
- Cemetary trees?
- Yes. They are marvelous.
Very interesting. Poisoned splinters bring death.
Hard wood defies time and allows the creation of fine pieces.
Without yew wood, there is no spindle, and without the spindle...
We lost track of the time.
Like the scatterbrains you are.
I'll let you make your gifts,
I've already made mine.
The princess will die when she's 16 years old.
From piercing her hand with a spindle made of yew.
We mustn't worry the princess.
- You must put it right. - You're more experienced than we are.
Carabosse is a most powerful fairy.
I can't fight against her.
You've bragged of your experience.
I have more than you.
Let me concentrate.
I can ameliorate Destiny.
- Show-off!
Quiet!
The princess will not die, she'll merely fall asleep.
Her sleep will last 100 years.
100 years? What a drag.
Why not 2000?
We can make the best of it.
We were late because of you.
Admit it.
I could say that the princess could play hooky, and live her life in a dream.
I'll make it so that she pierces her hand at 6, and awakes at 16.
What for?
In any case, childhood is interminable.
GOOD AND PEACEFUL SLEEP, ANASTASIA.
Six Years Later
You remember your anger when you learned that
I was pregnant?
And look at you now, besotted for your granddaughter.
You weren't like that with me.
You were a lot less well-behaved.
I am the knight Vladimir.
I am the knight Vladimir.
You must realize that you're not a boy.
Yes! And I am the knight Vladimir!
Unfortunately, Anastasia,
Nature has decided otherwise.
I am a princess.
It's me who decides!
No.
Anastasia, what have you done this time?
You'll kill me.
You see what you've done to your beautiful dress? It's ruined.
Dresses are stupid.
I'll wear no more of them.
But that one fit you like a dream.
I'm not a dream,
I'm a knight.
Fine, I'll get some bandages.
Ouch.
You should have thought first.
Now I have to disinfect it.
It didn't even hurt. Knights don't feel pain, you know...
Try to arrive at adulthood in one piece.
Ah, my brave soldiers.
My army against sleep.
But look out:
I'm the Commander in Chief.
So...
Aside from my alarm clocks,
Above all I love my dictionaries.
Their words tell me stories better than any novel.
No, not stories.
They tell me the sense of things.
Everything is recorded.
Every word is like a tarot card that tells Destiny.
"Herbeline.
"Noun. Feminine.
Thin ewe kept in seclusion."
Like me. I'm a herbeline.
"Hermaphrodite.
"Noun and adjective. Masculine.
From 'Hermaphrodite'...
Mythological.
Said of a being that unites the characteristics of both sexes.
The leech is a hermaphrodite.
In zoology, what one calls the creatures that have a male genital gland and a female genital gland
(leech), the creatures that..."
We must utilize our powers.
- If that's what you can call it.
- You want to demoralise us?
Believe in my experience:
If she must sleep a hundred years, it is time for her to sleep a hundred years all at once.
Only our goddaughter doesn't live in a fairy-tale castle.
The ancient times are past.
Someone who sleeps a hundred years won't pass unobserved in modern times.
We can't put her entire world to sleep.
We'll be more discreet than the first time.
If she wakes 100 years later, alone in the world... she could die of fright.
- We must warn her.
She can't know.
It would be too cruel.
You don't know mankind:
They know they will die, and they live without thinking about it.
They even waste their time.
THEY WASTE THEIR TIME?
Of course. It's even their favorite pasttime.
Miss Anastasia, you will end up waking the dead!
And in your family, there's one you shouldn't wake.
Drat, drat and drat! If I'm a princess that can't do what I want, what's the point?
But must I really die?
You must sleep.
Don't over-dramatize.
It's going to be very annoying in 100 years, if you don't keep your promise.
You have the key, you will escape.
I want to shiver, you understand?
It's crazy how sometimes time passes slowly.
Three or four days before the performance seemed interminable.
I was in a hurry for the disaster to happen and change my life.
The life of a little girl, it's very annoying.
With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls
Walk in rhythm
Through the blooming meadows
Winter is over, the dawn with burning eyes
Tints the dew with pink and blue
Then this, then that, when the sun flies up
With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls
Walk in rhythm through the blooming meadows
Get onstage!
I don't want to be in a girl show!
Do it for your grandmother.
What's the point, if Papa isn't here?
Get away from me, you rot!
We're going to talk, the two of us.
I don't speak to rot covered with boils.
I am your own rot.
Come, I'll give you a chance.
If you can knock down the crossed shinbones, if you can do it, then you are free.
If not you'll end like the others, beheaded, deliciously rotting.
Hand me that.
Whatever your heart desires.
I am true, all is false.
I am in a hurry to finish with you.
You're not very big, you'll make a nice appetizer.
It isn't possible...
Twice in a row?
Yes!
And you don't even exist!
Yes...it's started to freeze.
Are you from among the living?
Mama, is that the little sister that you promised me?
It's...
But you're a real little girl of flesh and blood.
I'm hungry.
You want some?
Poor little dumpling...
And there you go.
Clean as a new penny.
Good for giving to the saddler, all this.
You look like a real little boy like that.
If I'd expected a girl to fall out of the sky...
That looks great on me.
You know, even if I am bigger than you, we're going to be great friends.
No, no, no, stop.
No, no.
No, don't tease her.
No, Peter!
Yes, that's it!
Spin her around, that's great.
That's great. Continue.
It's not nice what you did.
It was very naughty.
You'll see, in the spring, We'll have roses of different colors.
You're hurting them.
If I don't do that, there won't be any roses.
This way, they'll be forever beautiful.
Eternity doesn't exist.
You see that?
Those are called "eyes".
I'll leave three or five, it depends, and from every eye will grow a large stem full of a new force.
But when you cut off the tops of the oaks, they never grow back the same.
Because they're trees.
It's pretentious and ugly to want to constrain trees.
But the more you cut the more they grow, because they're brambles.
Do you believe me?
Yes, because you can't be bad.
Look.
It's the Queen.
The others force-feed her royal jelly, so much that she can't move.
She is the prisoner of her duty.
I'm afraid!
I don't want to be like her!
But you won't, that won't happen to you. Don't cry.
You aren't a bee.
I don't want to be buried so I can't move. Never again!
Don't cry, I'm here.
Nothing will happen to you.
I'll protect you, agreed?
You promise?
Here.
It's too much!
It's like a shower of edelweiss.
Those are white bees.
Do they also have a queen?
Certainly. The most beautiful and the coldest of them all.
The Queen of Ice.
She can't be caught.
Never does she land.
If she lands, all at once, hop!
She takes off to hide among the black clouds.
During the winter nights, it's she who roams the streets of the cities.
Her cold gaze covers the windows with tiny patterns of frost.
It would be beautiful to see her.
Don't say that, you wretch.
Anywhere she gazes, everything becomes gloomy and cold.
Come on. To bed.
I hate this Snow Queen.
If she comes,
I'll put her on the burning stove and she'll melt.
You're foolish.
I'd love to see her.
I'm sure that it would be marvelous.
Can you imagine? To live in the land of eternal snow.
You're making me cold.
I saw her.
I saw the Snow Queen.
- First off, she doesn't exist.
- I saw her, I tell you.
She looked me in the eyes.
I felt a shard of ice pierce my heart.
I want to sleep...
Why are you crying, you idiot!
Wipe away these tears, they make you frightful!
Besides I'm not hurting anymore.
The only thing that hurts me, is to see how everything is ugly, sinister and shrunken here!
And you're as ugly and thin as a rat.
You should see yourself, my poor girl, and understand what it's like living with you.
A skinny stupid dwarf!
A nice present you've become!
What's happened to you, Peter?
Do me the favor of apologizing immédiately.
Apologizing for what?
You think it's a life, for a boy my age, to be shut up with his mother and an ugly girl like her?
I'm sure that whatever's in your eye... keeps you from seeing the nice side of things.
Let me see.
Lower your head.
I don't see anything.
No, I don't see anything.
Obviously, idiot! It was a moment ago I was in pain.
Now it goes well, and I am very happy with my new perception of things.
Poor Peter, you think you're grown-up and intelligent.
You know what's happened?
You're at the difficult age, my boy.
- Peter...
- Now what?
You've never spoken to me as cruelly as you did now.
There's a first time for everything.
Explain to me what has happened.
I don't know.
Perhaps...
Nothing is stable in life.
The only stability is boredom.
Boredom.
You can't know how it imprisons me, how I feel I'm in a perpetual vice.
Is this a life, to stay in this tiny house, with only my mother and...
You're very nice, in a state of blissful wonder, as if it were enough to be blissful in order to be happy.
You're not happy?
Yes, but now,
I'm not anymore.
I want to live, and I know what you call happiness will keep me from iving.
Where is it? Where is it?
"Puberty.
Collection of physiological and psychological modifications that are produced with the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics".
It's noted in the definition.
- Where are you going?
- Where I want!
You've been brave, we've gone at a good pace.
I am the Snow Queen.
But you are entirely frozen.
You'd do best to get under my furs.
Is that better?
My sled...Where is my sled?
It's behind you. Your childhood is now behind you.
Now I'll no longer kiss you, for a final kiss would be your death.
Impudent boy, you're lucky
I wish to spare you.
Who are you?
Phantom train 1724 mustn't stop.
You mustn't stop here.
You are therefore doubly in violation, we don't let bare feet into the kingdom!
It isn't my fault.
Somebody left me here.
I didn't ask them to.
If I'm barefooted, it's because I left looking for my friend.
No one ever stops here.
We put up mannequins to discourage all intrusions, in the hope that no invasion comes during a storm, for evidently, we must arrange them so that they don't blow away.
Excuse me, I've got work to do.
This is a very peaceful country, that doesn't tolerate strangers.
You'd better leave.
How I'd love to have a doll like you.
Hey, you!
I'm closing the station.
You can't stay.
Besides, it's dangerous at night.
Tell me where I can sleep.
Is there a hotel?
You're stubborn!
I told you they don't allow strangers.
What am I going to do?
I'd like to go somewhere.
I waited for a train but none stopped.
I could take you to the prison, but it's full.
Our princes are very cruel.
What have you come to do in this country?
It's because of Peter, he's my friend.
A wonderful boy, much taller than you.
Ssh! Be careful.
This isn't the place to make yourself noticed.
He disappeared six months ago.
He's taller than me.
He has flashing eyes.
He's very strong.
He's the most intelligent boy I've ever known.
He can calculate in his head fractions and square roots.
It might be.
It might be that I've seen him.
Thank you, that's the best news this year!
Calm down! Show a little reason!
This isn't the place to make yourself noticed.
Don't make me say what I haven't said.
I said: It could be that the one
I'm thinking of is whom you're looking for.
Maybe or maybe not.
I've said nothing more.
Walk through this gallery.
Your destiny awaits you.
Make up your mind,
I don't have much time.
It's getting late.
Be careful you don't offend the queen, she has a terrible temper.
I don't know if I should let you in.
Hide in here.
Don't move for any reason until it chimes midnight.
- I prefer the suit of armor.
- No, don't argue.
I'll come back to look for you later on tonight.
And be careful that no one notices you.
"Be careful that no one notices you." Honestly...
It's good that I especially like the sound of alarm clocks, and that the tick-tock of my own is something I miss, because from this point of view,
I was spoiled: I had to count
2,000,550 tick-tocks and hear chime seven times the hours and as many times the half-hours, before you came to get me out of there.
Come with me,
I'll show you the way.
Don't be afraid, you shouldn't meet anyone, but be careful.
You mustn't be noticed.
"Be careful, you mustn't be noticed"...
My God, that's all they say here.
- Did you see their dreams?
- They passed too quickly.
Yes, evidently, it takes a certain experience.
They dream that they are alone in the world on an island of precious pearls and gold, and it will be thus for all Eternity.
Every night they dream the same thing.
Evidently, Peter loves to make the same drawings and have always the same dreams.
My job is finished here, young lady.
If you achieve honors and dignity, we hope that you will remember us.
- Yes.
- But if it turns out badly, you've never seen me.
Understand?
You must be very careful.
You mustn't be noticed.
Have no fear.
A brother can't recognize his sister.
Peter...
Peter, it's me.
Peter, wake up.
Guards! Guards!
Seize her!
Shall we cut off her head?
Have mercy!
My dear, you should have been cautious and not make yourself noticed.
Ah, now we're not so proud.
You are guilty of the crime of offending royalty.
Let her go!
She's only a child.
Certainly, she's connected to people of greater size, but she's only a child.
Do you understand you took a great risk in coming fraudulently into my room?
So that I might choose to let you live, you must tell me everything.
Or would you prefer to lose your head?
But I'm telling the truth.
Someone spoke so well of the prince, that I believed he could only be my friend Peter.
How could I know this wasn't him, when I'd left to look for him?
Peter is exactly the same, with all the best qualities in the world, in fact.
You're right.
My prince is wonderful.
Like Peter.
You're lucky, because you found him.
I'll never find Peter.
What time is it?
Oh, it's too lovely! I love watches and alarm clocks.
I give it to you.
Oh, thank you! Thank you.
I'm confused, Your Highness.
In any case, I'm very happy.
I've arranged that you be provided with delicacies.
Farewell. Never fear:
You will find Peter.
It was a long time ago that I lost him.
Patience. Time seems very long because you are so young, but you'll see, I who am older than you...
How lucky you are.
Don't say that, wretched one.
Time passes quickly.
And you'll realize that soon enough.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Goodbye, Your Majesty.
Goodbye.
- Her flesh must be tender.
- Let her go! Let her go!
She's mine, you understand?
Let her go!
They won't kill you as long as I don't get angry with you.
But if I do get angry with you, it's I that will kill you.
You are no doubt a princess.
No.
And I told her my story.
She thought that I had experienced some very strange things, and that in comparison, although she was older than me, nothing had happened to her at all.
This is Granny, called Old Shrew.
What?
It was she who led the men in the attack, but now, she's old, so she can't do anything.
That's very funny, my girl!
I've got 24 of them.
Kiss him!
Don't be afraid.
These pigeons are domesticated.
They are afraid of us, not the other way around.
This one, you should keep your eye on.
If not, she'll take off, and with such speed, you won't have a chance to catch her.
Every night, it amuses me to tickle her neck, so that she knows what it's all about.
What if she doesn't like it?
What if she doesn't like it at all?
I give the orders.
Come on, we're going to bed.
Aren't you going to keep your knife while you sleep?
I always sleep with it.
You never know.
Are you afraid that I'll do to you what I did to the doe?
I know very well you're going to do it.
I'm not even afraid.
You know that this is a real knife.
I press a little harder...
Blood trickles.
You can't know how it makes me itch.
I know that if I do it, afterwards, I will slit your throat.
I don't wish to.
I don't want to.
But I'm itching to.
Aren't you afraid?
Aren't you afraid of me?
You are mad.
You must never trust me.
I am not bad, but that's what excites me.
Sometimes, I can't control myself anymore.
You are brave for a girl.
It's the princess that gave them to me.
Do you only meet princes and princesses?
High society, that's how it is with them.
The Queen of England doesn't meet just anyone.
You talk in your sleep, you're too funny.
It's a kind of dream, but not so stupid.
Would you really like to find your friend Peter?
- I would give my life.
- Don't say that. Life's precious.
I believe that he's in Laponia.
I can't think of where else he could be.
But if you swear you will return and give yourself up...
I swear.
Oh my, all of this...
It's good, huh?
- But it sticks to your teeth.
All the men have left, there's only my grandmother left.
She won't leave.
She's tough.
But she has a thing for the bottle.
What am I doing here?
Help! Get me out of here!
Who put me here?
Get me out of here!
Little thieves!
Stay there!
Who are these little thieves?
I would have liked to keep her.
But too bad, I'm going to untie her and let you go, so that you can return to Laponia.
Now I don't want to leave.
Eat, my doe. eat.
Perhaps I'll die of cold before the end.
You took your time getting here!
I know you're very clever.
You could, with a bit of string, tie up all the winds on earth.
If you undo the first knot, there's a good wind.
Untie the second, ships slice through the waves quickly.
But if you untie the third and fourth, you will raise a storm that will blow down all the forests on earth.
And you know how to make a potion that gives the strength of a dozen men.
Not so quickly, my young friend.
I only do what is just, and what I have to do.
Help me to tear Peter from the clutches of the cruel
Snow Queen.
Ssh!
Ah...You see...
Let me mull it over.
But your case isn't an easy one.
Oh no, no, no.
It isn't easy.
"When the dragon rampant
"bites the tail of the winged dragon,
"and the winged dragon
"swallows the tail of the dragon rampant,
"and the dragon rampant
"absorbs the winged dragon,
"the result is... the Ouroboros!"
Is this the Ouroboros?
This Book of Spells comes to me to confirm...
Your friend is a prisoner of the Snow Queen.
But he is very happy, and thinks he is among the happiest of men.
But he's mistaken, isn't he?
He's mistaken, but he's happy.
The Snow Queen will retain her hold on him.
But couldn't you make a potion that would give me the power to break the spell?
I cannot give you a power stronger than that which you possess.
Don't you see that animals and people are compelled to serve you?
You departed bare-footed and without mishap, you've travelled half the universe.
It's not from me that you could receive strength, oh no!
The doe will take you ten leagues from here, to a grove of red fruit in the midst of the snow.
Pay attention.
That's where he'll return to you.
No, no. Mama told me it was forbidden.
"Don't eat strange fruit,
"especially red berries: they could be poisonous, and you could die."
Yes, but I risk nothing:
I'm dreaming.
Yes, I risk dying while I sleep.
No, no...I'm too young to die.
But if you die while sleeping, you then awake.
What are you doing here?
Please leave.
But first tell me what you're doing here in an old-fashioned dress.
I am in my home.
And you're dressed in a fashion that is very strange.
And you look a lot like Peter.
Yes, you look a lot like him.
My great-grandfather was called Peter.
My name is Johan.
My name is Anastasia.
I know, it's a pompous name.
My grandmother liked it,
I don't remember why.
You see that I didn't lie.
That's my grandmother.
But careful, don't wake her.
Grown-ups are very annoying.
As for little vixens, they're stupid, mawkish and pretentious.
I hate girls.
But who are you?
Peter's beloved.
And you aren't Peter.
If only I hadn't lost in the exchange...
You shouldn't have done that!
I'm certainly much younger than you!
- How old are you?
My mother had me when she was 15, and my father was the groom.
He was very, very handsome.
And so are you.
But...if I did the same with you,
I would waste my youth, because you are much too old for me.
But I'm 18. You have strange ideas about the world.
That's the way I am.
All or nothing.
Then it's nothing?
Not more than seven today.
One...
Three...
Six...
Seven...
Eight...
- You're cheating!
That's enough for today.
- It looks like you want it.
- No, I don't want it.
You know what it's called, a girl like you?
A tease.
In fact, you're more clever than I thought.
No, no.
I like to flirt with you.
But I'm not sure you love me.
It's too soon.
What did you do yesterday?
I went to school.
If you don't cheat!
You're wearing a corset?
But what kind of creature are you?
A woman.
Actually a young girl.
Your skin is soft.
How can you endure these awful stays?
To be beautiful, you must suffer.
There are some that don't.
And they're very beautiful.
- More beautiful than me?
- Are you jealous?
What does that mean, jealous?
To fear that I prefer someone else to you.
- But it's impossible.
- Yes, it's possible.
You make me tired, with your funny dress with laces.
Mind you, it's exciting.
- Exciting?
A turn-on.
You're a turn-on.
But you're also a ninny, pretending you're a princess.
But I am a princess!
No one dares disobey me!
No one dares contradict me!
I get it.
You're not 16.
I am 16!
Fine...I'll come back when you're more grown up.
Take heed.
Perhaps you'll be too old.
And perhaps I'll no longer love you!
A pretty boy, but I wonder if it's really worth the trouble that you run after him to the end of the world.
How beautiful you are, and how I missed you too!
You could have stayed with me.
- Yes, but...
- I know. You love him.
And if you love him, you'll cause yourself a lot of pain.
You must never tell a boy you're in love with him.
I told him that I'd risk not being so anymore.
That's better.
There.
That's where he stopped.
I've got the right to go much further, since I'm a girl.
It's girls that can teach girls all about love.
Really?
Often boys are too clumsy, or too much in a hurry.
And if they're a little better raised, they're afraid of virgins.
You've already had a boy?
Men!
All those that I liked.
Bandits don't make a fuss.
That boy who worries and feels the shudder of remorse because you are too young...
I slept with a man for the first time when I was 13.
If I could have done so at 12,
I would have.
I think I've got the devil in my body!
And how many have you had?
I stopped counting.
Anyway, what's the point?
There are those that count, and those that don't.
But...there's also the one who doesn't count anymore.
Who is that?
He that you loved very much, and now you're apart.
Does that exist, being apart from someone you've loved very much?
All the time.
Anyway...Sometimes you find them again.
Look at you and me...
I think I love girls better than I love men.
They have more mystery.
Especially a little girl in love who doesn't know what to do about it.
Let me take care of it.
With a girl, it doesn't count.
Tell me that I'm your friend.
Not your little friend...
Your great friend.
You're the first girl that I've loved.
Before, I wanted to be a boy.
I hated girls.
I wanted my mother to call me Vladimir.
And I never wanted to have breasts.
Now, I want some huge ones.
Everyone's stupid when they're little.
Anyway, you had guts.
I couldn't frighten you.
And the knife?
- The dagger?
- Yes.
- I liked it.
I was very afraid, but that's what I liked about it.
I've always been treated as if I were made of glass.
Here...
Look.
I've got your watch.
I stole it.
I wear it always.
I thought I'd lost it.
You never pay attention.
You're so spoiled.
- And you're such a thief.
- That isn't called thieving.
- Pinching.
Pincher!
Johan, where are you going?
This is the third time you've done this. You leave...
I don't know...You must stop it now, Johan.
We already talked the other day about it.
Mama, I'm 17.
It's an easy year.
I'll get my diploma.
I should make the most of it.
Afterwards, I won't have the time.
But your diploma, you must get it with honors.
Exactly, it's the last year that
I can goof off.
Don't worry, afterwards
I'll take my prep classes.
Then, I won't time for anything.
Agreed, but promise you won't come in too late.
And that you won't drink too much, because alcohol, you know.
I'm not going out, I'm going to the studio. I invited Paul.
All right. If it's Paul, OK.
Agreed. But you won't come in too late, eh?
Kiss.
- I want to leave.
- And if I won't let you?
You know I could hurt you?
That I could kill you?
No! That would be a shame.
- A shame for who?
- For my daughter.
I haven't been here in 4 days but I haven't forgotten you.
You're lying...
You're lying! You're lying!
- You'll catch cold. - I've caught a cold! I did it on purpose.
Stop!
I'm helpless before you.
I don't know what to do.
Me neither!
When you weren't there...
I love you.
Our story scares me.
Why?
Because we're too young, the two of us.
It shouldn't be so intense, so absolute.
Swear that I'm your first and your last.
You're the soul of Peter, the first and the last.
What's this business about Peter?
My absolute, ever since I was little.
I've looked for you through the long dream and nightmare of childhood.
What are you saying?
The truth for young girls.
Don't be jealous.
Take me to your world.
No, impossible.
It isn't made for you.
It would drink you, it would steal your eternity.
Mine, not ours.
Ours too.
Anastasia...
Anastasia.
You want me to go?
Anastasia?
What? You don't want to talk to me anymore? Is that it?
I don't know you.
I thought I'd go mad when I couldn't find you.
You realize what you've done to me?
I did to you what you did to me!
We were too young, you said so all the time.
I want this baby, he's mine!
I'll call him Vladimir.
It's the name I gave myself when I was little.
But you're crazy!
You could have asked my opinion!
You told me to be reasonable!
I was in my fashion!
Stop! You're hurting me!
You didn't have the right to disappear like that!
Do you love me like before?
Like before.
Only it's after.
You see, I go out all alone in your world.
Ya! That's me. Abhay Sharma.
The most important part of this college, and as you can see, everyone here knows just how important l am.
Actually, l'm the life of this college.
Because without me, these people won't even make it through one day,
'cause l make it all happen.. yeah!
Hey, Abhay!
Your homework.
Oh! Thanks man! You really make it all happen..
What would l do without you? lt's OK, Bill.
Ya! So, that was my introduction.
Abhay Sharma.
Ya, ya, l know what you all must be thinking about me.. that l don't look so cool.
But these things don't matter.
Why? Because the most beautiful girl in college is my girlfriend, Alisha.
OK! OK! Fine. The last part was a bit of a lie.
Actually, she doesn't even know who l am.. if l even exist or not.. you know..
Bill, l will give you that history homework tomorrow, OK?
Ya! So this was me. Abhay Sharma. And that was Alisha, the love of my life.
She doesn't know this yet, but someday she will.
Everything will be just fine.
Don't you worry! What?
You don't believe me?
Would l ever lie to you guys?
OK, OK, OK.. l know l just lied but you know what they say, right.. that everything's fair in love and war, and however impossible it may seem.. this is definitely love.
Aah, boy.
Hey, boy! You, the hunk with the trunk.
Packin' in a fully loaded funky junk.
Hey, boy! With the brandy snap eyes.
He tell me sinful beautiful lies l've been looking for a boy
Who can change my day to night l've been looking for a boy
Who only talks about me
Some boy like this
Some boy like that
No one boy will have it all 'cause..
Oh baby, the truth is l'm way out of your league
Alisha
From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen
But the truth is
You're way out of my league
Alisha

Hey boy! Me an easy girl to please
Just wanna Mr. right from you honneyz ln my dreams l can see my guy

Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice
Get down on your knees and say what's nice
Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice
Get down on your knees and say what's nice l had read about him sometime
That he'll be waiting for me somewhere
He'll be my beloved just like l'll be his
And his heaven will be at my feet
Some boy like this
Some boy like that
No one boy will have it all 'cause..
Oh baby, the truth is l'm way out of your league
Alisha
From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen
But the truth is

Alisha
From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen
But the truth is
You're way out of my league
Alisha..
And as it often happens in love, a time comes when the boy and girl meet for the very first time.
Tonight was that night. l was so good at it.
Oh, get off me, Natasha.
They say boys will never understand what goes through a girl's mind..
Stop it! Don't be such a party pooper! l guess this was something like that.
You know you want me to do it!
No! No!
- OK, you know you want me to do it!
Stop! Stop being a mummy!
Alisha! Stop this!
Oh God! lt sucks!
Uh oh.. lt's very late.
Let's go Alisha, c'mon.
OK, OK.. do not panic,
OK.. l can do this.
Alisha! Oh my God.. Alisha come down..
Alisha, you're making me nervous, just come down!
Babe.. it's just freaking tequila we've done this a hundred times before!
Alisha! Come down!
OK, OK, watch, OK watch.. l can do this on my toes!
- Alisha.. l can do this on my toes!
Alisha come down! Alisha!
Alisha!
Oh my God! Alisha!
Alisha! Alisha!
Alisha!
She cannot swim..
Alisha!
Help, someone help!
Looks like l'll have to give her mouth to mouth.. ls she OK?
Thank you so much! But we'll take it from here, OK?.. thank you.
Hey, what went wrong?
This was not how it was supposed to be, by now she should've fallen in love with me. l mean, l saved her life, right? l can't understand it.
Ya! l know when!
Tomorrow morning.. of course.. l'm so stupid, right! ln matters of the heart l'm sort of new.
Enough is enough l'm fed up Alisha! l don't care what stage your semester is in. l'm taking you away from here and that's final.
Dad! My entire life is here.
How can you even suggest that? l don't care! This is the fifth time l've been called here. l can't take it any more. l am not going anywhere! l'm not asking you. l'm telling you, understand?
So what will you do? Take me from here forcefully? l wanna see you try!
- l'm taking you away right now! l've spoken to the Dean and as of today you've been rusticated..
.. from this university, understand?
That is so unfair.
Pack your bags.
Dad, please.. my semester! l'm waiting outside.
- Dad, please!
Look, thanks for whatever you did last night.
But l think you should go now. She needs to be alone. Thanks anyway.
Don't worry. l'll speak to your dad.
Everything's gonna be alright.
He's not gonna listen. What makes you think he's gonna listen to you.. he's just stubborn.. who were you speaking to?
Nobody.. just that geek who saved your life last night. l should say thank you, right?
Ya.. but that's not important right now. l guess..
The truth is that not every love story can have a happy ending, right?
And when something like this happens then people like..
.. us need to forget about our love and move on.
She still doesn't even know who l am.. and it's OK.
Now, l just need to get her out of my heart.. that's all.
Alisha, l guess this love was impossible after all.
But l wish you happiness wherever you go. Goodbye, Alisha.
Good morning, Abhay Sharma!
This is your wake up call for the day. l have the following facts for you this morning.
Did you know that the white part of your fingernail is called the lunula?
Did you know that when a coffee seed is planted it takes five years to yield consumable fruit?
Did you know that the largest prime number is 1 3, 395 digits long more than the number of..
Morning.
Morning, Dad.
Dad, l have a very important meeting today.
Meeting? What meeting?
There's an investor who is interested in my software. l'm giving him a presentation today.
That's great! But you should have come to me first. l have lots of friends in the software industry. l could have set up a meeting with any one of them for you.
Dad, you started your business alone.
You did everything solely on your own. l want to follow in your footsteps.
Like father, like son.
But if you ever need anything you know that l'm here, right?
Of course, Dad. Now eat your cereal. l'm worried about you, friend! No, l'm really worried!
You've been in love with that girl for six years..
What was her name?
- Alisha.
Alisha. lt's been six years!
Not six, Dad, it's been seven years.
Of course! Seven years. Look son..
There's love and then there's obsession.
You need to forget about this girl.
Anyway, l have to go. And good luck for your interview!
Abhay?
- Ya. Hi!
Hi! Siddharth Singh.
You can call me Sidhu.
OK.
Some coffee? Ya?
- Ya.
Excuse me, two cappuccinos please!
So, finally we meet.
- Ya. l've heard a lot about your software. l.. l hope you like it. l'm sure l will. So shall we begin?
OK, let's start. So this software is essentially an operating system that l've named Unity.
Now, you'll be thinking, why Unity?
Well, Unity because this operating system has the ability to unify each..
.. and every kind of operating system across the world. l mean, you can use programs running on any operating system on Unity. lt could be Windows, the
Mac OS or even Linux systems.
Moreover, you can even use it on your mobile phone.
So, from mobile phones to computers, it works on everything.
So this is Unity, my work over the last seven years.
Fantastic! Abhay, l'm impressed.
Thanks. l'm very impressed. ln fact, this has exceeded my expectations.
Just one thing Abhay.
- Ya?
Before investing in this, l'll need the original program files of this software.
Program files? OK..
Yes, l'll need them.
Can you just excuse me, please?
Hello, Dad?
Hi, Abhay, how are you?
How are things?
Dad, he's quite impressed but he's asking for the original program files.
He's saying that he wants them before he invests in the software.
No, no, no. Don't give him anything until the deal is finalised.
Tell him that after the deal is done you will give the files to him, OK?
Nothing before that.
Don't make that mistake. OK?
OK, OK, Dad. Thanks. Bye.
Should we go ahead?
Uh, actually Sidhu, sir.. l won't be able to give you the actual program files until the deal is done.
But l have a CD that contains the executable files.
You can learn everything about the software through it. This you can take.
Look, Abhay. Don't get me wrong.
Your Unity software is fantastic.
But on giving it some thought l feel that this is not what we're looking for right now.
But.. but l assure you, sir!
This is a path breaking software.
No, it's fantastic but just not right for us right now.
But all the best and thank you very much.
Sir, it's taken me seven years to develop this software..
.. and l've personally tested it in every possible hardware configuration.
So if you're thinking compatibility, it's compatible with all the hardware systems. lf you're thinking speed, l've tested it in all the benchmark tests..
.. and if you're thinking usability then this is so easy that even a child can use it.
So, as you can see, this is going to be a revolutionary new software called Unity.
What's the name of the company?
- Pinnacle. very good presentation, Mr.
Sharma. very good.
But we've heard that there is a Singapore-based company..
.. that is going to launch a similar software, and it's called.. Unify?
Unify? But, but sir, l developed this software, it's absolutely original. lt's not possible that someone could develop.. a software exactly like this one, it's just not possible, sir. l hear what you're saying, Mr. Sharma.
But our company wouldn't want to get involved in anything that harms our reputation. l hope you understand.
Anyway, thank you very much, Mr.
Sharma, l wish you all the best.
Excuse me, could you tell me the name of that Singapore company.. ?
Ya, sure.. Pinnacle Software.
.. Pinnacle Software.
Can you just excuse me please?
- Sure.
So, what you're saying is that you have made this software.
Dad, l've been working on this for the last seven years.
OK, and now someone has stolen it from you?
Ya.
You know, Abhay, l'm to blame for making you like this.
Like what?
Like me. Running away from unpleasantness, not fighting for your rights, but there's a reason behind this.
After your mother passed away l just wanted to protect you from the rest of the world, and in the process l made you weak.
That's not true.
That's true. Now if you want to forget about this software..
.. and stay here with me, l'll still love you as much as l do right now. l'll still be proud of you.
But if you go to Singapore and get your software back from that man then you will be proud of yourself. lt's your decision, what do you want to do?
You know,.. ,l have the best dad in the world. l know that.
And l'm going to Singapore.
Taxi! l'm sorry sir, but there's no one with the name Siddharth Singh..
.. working in any department of this company.
Dad, l'm sitting outside the Pinnacle office.
There's no one named
Siddharth Singh here. l'm at a loss, Dad. What should l do?
Son, don't lose hope and remember one thing - that you have..
.. to get your software back no matter what, OK?
Believe in yourself, everything will be alright.
And what if l don't find him? l don't think he's here at all. l don't know what to do. lf this company releases my software then what can l do about it, Dad?
Please help me, l don't know what to do, l just.. just don't know what to do any more.
Relax, relax Abhay.. just relax.
OK, do one thing. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.
Now imagine good things around you. lmagine that there are new, beautiful computers around you.
And Alisha..
Of course, of course, Alisha.. her too, ya?
Feeling good, right son?
Ya, Dad.
Now open your eyes.
Feeling good? l feel great, Dad, just great. l can see her, like.. like she's right in front of me.
She's just so beautiful.
Who?
Alisha, Dad! Who else?
Son, l told you to open your eyes!
Dad, my eyes are open but she's still in front of me!
OK, fine, no problem.
Actually, this is even better,
You keep dreaming about her! So what is Alisha doing right now?
Dad, she's gone inside the Pinnacle office.
That's a good thing! lt's a good sign.
So, why don't you follow her into the office
And fight for what's rightfully yours?
Get your software back, it's not me but Alisha who is showing you the path.
You're right Dad, l'm going.
OK, good. l'm going too, to the bathroom!
Look, l'm not going to take no for an answer. l need to see someone right now.
But - No ifs or buts! l want to see someone, now!
OK, OK, sir, just calm down.
Let me see what l can do.
Hi! There's someone who wants to meet the head of PR urgently. ls that alright? OK, thank you.
Sir, you can go to the fourth floor..
..and meet our public relations officer in charge. lt's the first room on the left.
OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Sorry. lt's alright.
C'mon now. You guys can't even do this much? l have to do everything myself?
Oh, my God!
Even l was remembering God, Dad!
Look, you've been in love with this girl for the last six years..
Seven years, Dad.
OK, don't correct me.
Seven years? OK, fine.
Don't you think you should speak to her now at least?
What's the worst that could happen?
She won't recognise you, or she might give you a slap or two!
But at least you'll have a clear picture about your situation.
You're absolutely right, Dad.
Basically, you're not going to speak to this girl..
No, Dad.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Taxi! Taxi!
Thank you.
Tania, stop troubling me! Tania, l can't deal with this, are you mad?
Tania! Tania! Stop it,
Tania, have you lost your mind?
Tania, behave yourself, l'm not going to deal with your nonsense, Tania, l swear!
Just stop it, Tania!
You're driving me mad..
..Tania, l can't deal with your nonsense any more!
Thank God! You're here.
Look, l can't do this any more, she's not a child, she's a monster!
Forgive me, but l'm leaving. l quit!
No, no, no, no Mansi, you can't go anywhere.
Look, please, l need to get back to office and there's no one here to look after Tania.
Please, please. OK, just try and understand, l'm a single, divorced working mother and l don't have anyone else! - l don't care!
OK, OK, fine, l'll pay you double, double! l don't care!
- Triple! But not more than that. l'm sorry Alisha, but l love my own life more than money.
Now you handle this monster of yours, l'm out of here.. bye!
Mons.. ! Tania Merchant!
Mom! You're home, yay!
Oh no you don't, don't try cute on me. lt's not gonna work. l'm very upset with you.
How will l go back to the office now?
So don't go to the office, Mom.
We'll spend the entire day together.
Why do you trouble me so much, T?
Cause l love you, Mom! l love you too, munchkin, but you know Mom is working.
And however much l want to, l can't spend the entire day with you.
Now, we'll have to find somebody to look after you. Who?
Hello.. Jasmeet and
Jasmeet Nanny Agency.. an exclusive agency of lndian Nannies.
Our Nannies are extremely intelligent..
Jasmeet! This is Alisha..
Alisha Merchant.
Alisha! Alisha! You talk to her.
Not me! Not me! l won't speak to her.
- Again..
Oh no!.. speaker.
Ya, hello Alisha dear.
So, tell me, how can l be of assistance to you?
Jasmeet, you know what?
That nanny you sent me had so much attitude! l've fired her, and now my problem is that l need to get back to the office.
And l urgently need another nanny.
Again?
You know how it is.. l know how it is,
Alisha. l know how it is.
Actually, the thing is, that this is the fifth nanny that has quit working at your house in the last three months. l don't think anyone will be willing to work at your place.
And don't feel bad.
You see, your daughter,
Tania, she's a bit of a challenge, you see. l don't think anyone will come to work for you because everyone is scared of her.
C'mon, Jasmeet, she's just six! So what's the big deal? OK, fine, fine.
Please help me out this time, l need to get back to the office and l'm really, really late.
Just this one time.
Hello, look this is very short notice. lf someone can come then she'll come to work for you.
But l'm not making any promises.
And if she does come then she'll reach your place by twelve o' clock.
That's fine. l'll wait for her, OK.
But this is the last time we are doing this, we can't send any more nannies after this time. l owe you one, Jasmeet!
OK, Alisha dear, take care then, thank you.
Again..
Jasmeet, l don't think anyone will be willing to go to her house.
So what should we do then, Jasmeet ? l have an idea!
- What?
Let's not do anything. Let's not send anyone to her house!
Let's not send anyone.
She'll understand then.
This seems like a good plan.
- lt's a good idea, right?
Ya!
- So it's done then!
Cheers!
- Cheers dear, cheers! To you too.
Hi! Hi! Hi! l'm Abhay. Abhay Sharma.
No, no.. just keep it simple.. ya.
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma.
Hi! My name is Tony. Nice to meet you.
Yes. l know that and l will be. l'm just waiting for a new nanny and as soon as she gets here l will leave, l promise.
Yes, absolutely. Tania, you better not be throwing away your broccoli.
And no, this time that smile won't work, so eat it.
She's here and on time, fab!
God bless Jasmeet! l've been waiting for you for so long and now you're here..
But you're a man..
Ya, sorry, l'll..
No, no, no, nobody's perfect. l'll introduce you to Tania, you're gonna love her, she's.. you will love her.
Tania! Look, normally l don't keep anyone without interviewing them but the Jasmeets have sent you and l totally trust them and l'm.. oh my God, l'm so late.
So today we'll try you out and then we'll see.
Tania! And please finish whatever chores there are on the list before l get home because that work needs to get done. Tania! l'm eating!
- l don't care! Now!
Look, l think that..
Ya Mom, what is it?
Tania, your new nanny. Hi?
- Nanny?
Ewww! But he's a man.
Really? Thank you, Tania, because if you hadn't told me then how would l ever know that he's a man?
Come here, you be a good girl, OK? l need to leave, alright? Please behave.
OK, bye!
Bye! Please clean the house before l get home.
Actually l'm a computer software..
Don't you dare touch the computer!
Don't touch it. l have just understood it. l have just managed to figure it out, oh and l'll check your work when l get back. So just.. just know that.
Excuse me.. - CP, ya l've just left.
5 minutes. One second, hold on, ya? lf anything, anything at all happens to my daughter l'll chop you up into tiny little pieces and feed you to the animals in the Singapore zoo!
And have a nice day! Ya? OK. Yes, CP.. l'll sort it out as soon as l get to the office.
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma. l hate you!
Look, l don't know anything about this nanny business.
But l can't even leave you home alone, right?
So let's do one thing, let's become friends.
OW! Tania!
Now get out of the house or else l'll call the police!
Police? But what have l done?
Nothing. But if l tell them that you were doing bad things with me, then who do you think they will believe? You or me?
Look, let's make a deal.
Let me stay here till your mother gets back and in exchange l'm ready to do anything for you. l'll do anything. Anything.
Anything?
Number 1 ! Clean the house!
Hey! You missed a spot.
Tania's homework!
Yes!
Back to work.
Piano lessons. Ewww! Yuck! Boring!
Don't worry. l won't ask you to play the piano. l hate it.
Because l'm going to be a rock star, and rock stars don't play the piano.. they play the guitar!
Oh, OK.
Hello.
- Hi! ls everything alright?
Ya! Everything is alright!
Where is Tania?
One second. Tania.. your mother.
Hi Mom!
Hey baby! ls everything alright?
You're not troubling your new nanny, right?
Am l troubling you?
No, not at all. ln fact it's a lot of fun here!
Not at all, mummy. ln fact it's a lot of fun here and l've even finished my homework.
Shut up! l don't believe it. l'll have to get home and check.

Cause she's very cool!
Cause she's very cool..
Tania?
Hi mommy!
Hi!
Oh my.. oh my God! l am.. l am so sorry about this.
Never mind.. it's, it's OK.. it's fine.
No, no, no, it's absolutely not OK.
Tania Merchant this is, this is just not done.
You can't treat people like this. l mean, look at this poor man, what have you done to him?
You think it's funny?
You think it's funny?
Because it's really not,
Tania Merchant, it's his niceness that he's stayed here for so long.
Anyone else would have left you alone and gone long ago. l'm really, really sorry, and thank you so much for.. l know that Tania must have troubled you a lot and l can see it.
But you see, l really need a nanny like you.
And it's OK that you're a man, it's totally fine.
Do you think that you could forgive Tania and take this job?
But Mom!
The thing is that l need to tell you something..
Ya, ya, sure! Totally!
Say whatever you need to say but please take this job.
You know. Just come with me one second. - Ya.
You see, no one has been able to handle Tania like this and l'm a divorced single working mother. lt's difficult. l'm ready to give you anything, l'll double your salary, how about that?
No, you don't understand what l'm trying to say. l've come to tell you something really important.
OK fine! Triple. But that's it OK.. please. l need to tell you something really..
Look. l really need you to do this.
Please say yes, just please say yes.
Please. Try it but say yes.
Yes.
OK.. l.. sweet!
Great, so since everything is settled, come tomorrow morning at seven and you can leave after finishing all the housework.
Just be back at three o' clock,
Tania comes back from school by then.
OK..

What was your name again?
Uh.. Abhay Sharma.
Abhay Sharma. Hi! Alisha Merchant.
Nice to meet you.
You too. l'm really sorry about all that, really sorry. lt's, it's OK. G'night.
G'night
- G'night Tania. lt's.. it's OK.
You know how it is. OK, bye! l'll see you tomorrow.
What? You've become a maid?
Not a maid, Dad, they're called nannies here.
And you're the one who told me to go speak to her, so l went to speak to her and she employed me as her nanny.
Now what?
Now nothing, Dad. l'll have to clean the house, cook food, and take care of her daughter.
Ya! l almost forgot to tell you.
Alisha is a single, divorced mother who lives here with her daughter.
Daughter?
Ya, Dad! A six-year-old monster who is intent on ruining my life.
So wish me luck, Dad.. for my new job.
But.. but son.. she is a single mother, she has a six-year-old daughter and you still.. l know what you're thinking, Dad.
But all this doesn't make a difference to me.
For me Alisha will always be Alisha.
Anyway, l gotta go, Bye! Taxi!
Hold my bag..
That's it. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Hey, Abhay. You are a little late today, no?
But that's not important.
Actually, kinda is but anyway..
For today, things that you need to do.
Number 1 . vacuum and dust the living room. Number 2. Polish the silver.
Number 3. Remove the clothes from the washer and put them in the dryer, and put the clothes lying in the hamper into the washer.
And ya! Don't forget to separate the coloured clothes otherwise.. anyway.
The clothes for ironing are lying on the table, l'm sure you know how to iron clothes.
Ya, right! l'll talk to you soon. Bye!
Nobody answer the phone!
Ssshh.. everybody quiet. Thank you.
Hello.
- Hey, Abhay!
All OK? You got my note?
Ya, ya, ya! l'll do everything, not to worry.
OK, see you tonight.
Back to work everyone.
This is for the full week, ya?
Thank you, thank you..
Perfect!
So what would be your legal advice in this matter?
Do you know where Mr.
Siddharth Singh is right now?
Mr. Sharma, l do want to help you. l knew your father really well but you don't even know where Mr. Siddharth Singh is.
And you have no proof that he stole your software.
My legal advice would be that you forget about your software, you have no case.
Hello Mr. Sanghvi. l'm Alisha Merchant, welcome to Pinnacle. lt's our pleasure.
The pleasure's all mine Ms. Merchant.
And if you greet me so beautifully then it would be difficult for me to ever leave.

This way.
Ms. Merchant. Call me varun.

.. Abhay, why don't you stay for dinner?
Huh?
Ya! Stay for dinner froggy.

Dinner? Food? lt's necessary for survival. lt's not that big a deal.
Ya! Ok.
- Ok!
Sweet!
Coffee?
- Ya sure.
So that's your coffee, and there's some sugar and milk over there.
Thank you
- You want some ice cream?
No. No thank you.
- l'll get some.
So tell me. Being a man, how come you decided to become a nanny? l mean, this is usually a woman's job, l mean usually.
Ya.. actually.. l'm very fond of children and like taking care of them. l like it. l can totally see that.
What you've managed to do with my daughter no one has done so far.
So this job as a nanny is perfect for you, like perfect.
Thanks. Thanks.
.. Wife? Girlfriend? l mean if you don't mind me asking.
No, no l don't mind. l'm not married and l don't have a girlfriend.
Never really had one either.
Never.

Shut the front door! How is that even possible?
Oh no! l'm sorry.. you like girls right?
Ya! Ya ya! l mean l was..

But l'm totally okay with it, gay rights..

Anyway, what about your marriage?
Oh.. l'm so sorry, l forgot.. l'm so.. so sorry.
No no no, it's ok. l didn't mean to..
No. lt's not a big deal.. l was very young when l got married. l mean l was what?
Like.. 1 8. And like it usually happens, the guy turned out to be a jerk and we got divorced.
After that l didn't want to stay in lndia any longer, and anyway it's not like he was interested in taking care of Tania.
So, when l got a job in Singapore, l took it and we moved here.
A new life, a new beginning.
Lets talk about something else ya.. ok.
And again l'm really sorry about..
Oh, it's fine.
- Ya? lt's fine.
- Ok
Don't worry about it. Ok
So, what work do you do in Singapore?
There is this software company called Pinnacle Technologies. l'm the PR and marketing..
Hi Mom! Came to say Goodnight.
Hey pumpkin.. who's that? varun.. l'll tell you.. hey!
Hey rock star!
- What's up?
Who's varun? l don't know.
Ok, Goodnight!
Goodnight froggy four eyes!
Ya.. so maybe
Alisha. Bye. Goodnight.
Oh bye, goodnight. Oh, no, no one.
That's just Tania's nanny.
Ya, so you were saying.
Hello Dad.
Abhay.. is everything alright?
No
- What happened? Alisha?
Son, the one girl you couldn't forget for seven years has come back into your life.
Do something so that she gets to know the real you.
And what will that accomplish Dad?
Well, anything can happen. Love?
C'mon Dad. This is Alisha remember?
She won't even look at guys like me.. this love is impossible.
Son, the ones who win in life aren't always the stronger, faster, clever ones. ln the end, the one who wins is the one who believes in himself.
The question here is, do you believe in yourself? l don't know Dad..
So then find out.
Because this impossible love story can only be made possible by you and no one else.
You're right dad. You're right.. let me call you back ya?.. Bye..
Good luck.
Possible..
Possible.. ya..
CP, you do understand how much of my time and effort has gone into developing this software?
Of course, varun. l completely understand.
Great! So then, according to you, how much would it all be worth?
A sum this large has never been offered to anyone before in the entire history of this company.
Mr. Sanghvi.
CP.. in the company's history this offer might be large but according to me it's not.
Alright, Mr. Sanghvi. Why don't you tell us what you expect?
Double this offer, give me a twenty percent partnership in the profits, and you have a deal.
You play hardball, Mr. Sanghvi.
Please call me varun. l may not like your methods, varun..
.. but l have full faith in this software.
We can seal this deal on one condition. lf l accept your terms then all your program files, your entire software and any other related work..
.. has to be handed over to me.
And all these files will be put into this company's secure server.
Sure. So do we have a deal then?
We sure do! Congratulations!
- Thanks.
Congratulations, Sir!
- You too.
Congratulations, Mr. Sanghvi.
Ms. Merchant, it was a pleasure doing business with you.
Well varun, l think you can now call me Alisha..
OK, Alisha. l think we should celebrate this moment. What do you think?
For sure!
Great! So then, may l take you out to dinner?
Well, logically, you are our guest.
So l should be the one taking you out to dinner. l'm okay with that! l'm sorry to interrupt but this software has to be put into the company's server right now.
C'mon, let's go. - Right. OK.
Boss is calling.
- Yeah! OK.
Come, varun.
- After you.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
This way.
As you can see, this facility is completely secure.
The internal network is directly accessed from here, and only senior personnel are allowed access to this room.
That's right. lt is your destiny, Luke!
No way, Jos!
- Jos? Who's Jos? He wasn't a Jedi!
Do l look like l care?
Look, Mom, l'm a Jedi!
Ya! And it looks like a lot more fun than homework!
What homework?
Tania! Tania! She's just kidding.
Until she finishes her homework l never let her play. Never. l'm sure.
Abhay, could l have a word with you? Upstairs.
Why? l mean ya, ya, sure!
Now?
OK.
Hello?
Abhay!
- Hi!
Hi! Come on in. Actually l just need some advice. A man's point of view.
Ya, sure.
Why don't these things ever work? l hate them, man! lf you like, may l?
You understand these things?
A bit.
Shut up! Really? Come. Come. Come. l never get network, it's like www-wayovermyhead.com.
Have a seat.
OK, so the problem is there's this guy in office, varun.
And he's asked me out to dinner.
That's not the issue, the problem is l work with him, you know.
And l know l shouldn't mix my personal..
.. and professional life but l mean technically, he doesn't even work in my office.
He's just like my client.
He's like really cute, you know how it is? - Ya, ya.
What should l do? l..
- OK, so l have two choices.
One, that l go out with him for dinner.
Alone, like a date.. but it's too early.
Two, that l invite him home, but that's just too intimate.
Unless l invite some people from the office as well?
Right!
- Ya!
That's great!
Because inviting everyone over for dinner will make sure the situation remains casual.
And it means we are still meeting for dinner. l like it!
Ya, me too..
You're fab. Thank you very much. l feel so much better now, really!
Any time.
Thanks! Oh! But listen, hey, we'll have the dinner tomorrow and..
Rohan, Madeleine, CP, Sumitra..
.. you'll manage cooking for six people, right?
Ya.
Oh! And l love Thai food. You know how to cook Thai food, right?
Thai food? Ya, ya! Of course!
Really?
- Ya.
That is so cool. You can do just about everything!
Ya!
G'night.
- G'night.
Shut up! You fixed this?
Why didn't you come into my life earlier, Abhay?
But it's never too late, so g'night!
G'night.

You guys sure? lt's true, Mom. You're looking mummalicious!
Hey!
- Hey, hi Alisha!
Hi! Sumitra, l'm so glad you could make it. Please come in.
You look stunning!

This is a small gift from us.
Oh! That's really kind of you, thank you so much! Come on in. l must say you've done your place up really well.

Alisha, you did a very good thing by inviting varun.
So, then what's for dinner Alisha?
Oh! You'll find out soon enough.
First a toast!
Oh God! Why did he have to sit in the front?
To Unify?
To Pinnacle and Unify.
Anyway..
What are you doing?
Good evening.
For madam. Thank You!
What are you doing?
Amusing! l'm really sorry.. he just likes feeding people.. backwards!
CP, why don't we tell varun a bit about the presentation?
Ya, varun..
- Soup!
Strange!
Excuse me.
Abhay, serve the soup!
- No!
What do you mean, no?
Self-service! Thai tradition.
Apparently, self-service is a Thai tradition.
Self-service it is!
Maybe some wine.. voila!
For you..
So..
Madam..
Soup!
Oh my.. my china! lt's fine. Hi!
Continue!
Amusing..

Surprise indeed.
Hello! Hello Sir!

You look tired.
No.. l'm fi..

Let me help you.
Help me? You.. you wanna help me?
Ya? OK, sure! Here, here.. why don't you serve the coffee?

Thank you so much.

Actually you did.. but you can tell me again. l don't mind.
OK, well l.. well you are.. who is that? l'm sorry, l forgot, but that's my..
Cook? Chocolate boy? He's still here?
Yeah.
Don't you think he should be leaving by now?
Oh..

Hi!

What was l doing? Oh.. you know..
Whatever! We'll talk about it tomorrow.
And these dishes?
These can be done tomorrow too, right?
Ya.. but l don't like leaving dirty dishes like this. l'll just finish it in two minutes. lt's almost done..
Abhay!
Oh..

Oh, fine.. OK, OK, OK. So then ya..
Ya.
- Ya, OK.
OK
- l'll go then. OK.
OK.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
He just left.
Your wine
- Thank You
So where did we leave off last?
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
Tania! l'm really sorry, varun. Bizarre things happen to me quite often, but this one even l can't explain. l just.. lt's OK, you're still very beautiful.
Anyway, this means that you'll have to take me out to dinner again, or let me take you out?
We'll see.
- OK.
Goodnight.
- Sweet dreams. Here.
Souvenir, don't worry about it.
Aw.. thank you!
Thai tradition!
Hello Sidhu.
Abhay..
Ya.
Abhay.. good to see you again.
Please come join me.
Sit down. Please.
Cappuccino, right?
- lt's OK.
So, Abhay.. what brings you to Singapore?
You know exactly why l'm here. l've come looking for you, to take my software back.
The software that you stole from me, Sidhu. varun. The name is varun.
This is the problem with you people.
Always so serious in life, you've got to relax. Calm down. l'll relax once l get my software back.
See, you're going on about that again.
Abhay, l'll only say this once, so listen carefully. ln this world there are two types of people.
People like you, who make things, and people like me who sell those things.
And in today's day and age without people like me, people like you would be nowhere. l mean, take a look at yourself.
You still live with your parents in their house, and are a burden on them. That's sad.
Why would anyone want to invest in you? lts all about marketing, you understand what l'm saying, right?
Ya, l.. l understand. l understand very well.
But what you haven't understood is that..
.. if people like me don't make things, what would people like you sell?
And varun, whatever you say can't change the fact that eventually you're nothing but a thief.
Thief? That's a big word.
Abhay, l'm just a businessman, besides, do you have any proof?
No, right? Look Abhay, because you're a good guy l want to help you.
Abhay Sharma, right?
This is a cheque for 50,000 dollars, you can only dream of making this kind of money.
And this can be yours now, just take it and go back to lndia, and forget about this software. Take it!
You know, varun. l've spent my entire life living under people like you.
Even in college l would do their homework, finish their projects, submit papers. l would do everything, and the result was that people like you moved forward and l got left behind.
But now, enough is enough, l can't do this anymore.
So put that cheque away, varun..
.. because now l'm not like that any more.
Now l would rather help myself and not you all.
Wow! That's great but you're too late.
The deal is done, the software has been sold and in a few days it will be officially launched.
This money is the only thing you'll get out of this.
You want to help yourself, right?
Then listen to me, take the cheque. varun. l'm giving you another chance, return my software to me.
Or else what? What can you do?
Something l don't want to do. l'll have to show the entire world that you're a thief.
You're a fool. This is the difference between you and me. l've given you an opportunity to change your life but you don't want to take it.
You're forgetting one thing, varun.
Till l have this, my life is in my hands, however much anyone might try to rob from me.
And one more thing, you can change your life with this, not with that.
Good luck. Go for it.
The exit's there.
OK, varun.
Excuse me.
- Yes? l.. l'm looking for the recruitment office. Human Resources? lt's on the first floor.
That way please. - Thank you.
Ankert University, California? Honours student? Great qualifications. Good.
So do l get the job?
You know what kind of a job this is, right? l know, Sir.
You'll have to repair computers, that's it.
Sure, Sir. l can do that. l don't think you understand what l'm saying.
This job is not worth your while, its very simple, inferior work.
How can l give someone like you a job like this?
Sir, if you think this work is too inferior then think of me as an inferior man and give it to me.
OK. Come to work from tomorrow.
Sir, can l start from today?
Of course you can! By all means.
Thank you. Sir, l have one request.. l won't be able to come to work at nine in the morning as l have another job.
As soon as l finish that l'll come here.. if it's OK with you?
Son, with your qualifications, there are no time restrictions for you.
Just finish the work properly.
- Of course! l know this won't be too much trouble for you.
Thank you, Sir.
Ask Helen for your uniform and lD-card on your way out. - OK, sir. OK.
Alright.
- OK.
All the best, my boy.
- Thank you, Sir.
Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.
God bless you!
You will be happy to hear that the media is very excited about this.
Enquiries are pouring in so l have a little plan set up that l want to show you. - Let's go
How we'll take this forward, yeah? varun, do you think we can put this onto mobile phones as well, the software for..
Froggy! We're staging a play in school on Friday and the teachers have put me in charge.
And l don't know how l'll manage this so fast.
You'll have to do everything, Froggy!
You have to help me!
Of course l'll help you, Tania.
Anyway it's getting late, say goodnight, OK? Sweet dreams.
You like my mum, right?
Tania.. you shouldn't say things like this. Go to sleep, OK? Goodnight!
OK. But if you really do like my mum then l can help you out.
Help? Help how? l knew it! You like her!
You like like her!
No, no, no, when did l say this?
When did l say this?
You don't need to say anything, Froggy. lt's clearly written on your face.
Whenever mommy comes in front of you then you should take a look at your face.
You get that silly smile. lts so obvio!
Tania, you do know that you're just six years old, right?
Yes! But in these matters l'm your grandmum. So say!
What?
- That you love my mum, stupid!
Smiling won't help. lf you need my help then you have to speak up!
OK..
- Ya, OK, what?
Ya, OK.. l love her. l didn't hear you.. l love her, OK?
How sweet! But there's a big problem..
Problem? What problem? varun..
Ya, varun..
And if l know mom then he's just her type. She likes idiots like him.
What?
We'll have to do something, Froggy!
And we'll have to do it quickly or else everything will get ruined.
But what can we do?
Don't worry! l like you and l hate him.
Meet me outside school tomorrow.
Tania will take charge. Give me five!
OK!
So what's the plan?
The problem is that you're just not mum's type. l know.. - And to change you is also impossible.
So what should l do?
Nothing much. Just spend sometime with each other.. alone!
Alone?
- Ya, she has to get know you, stupid!
But alone.. where?
At home. l've planned everything. l'm going to be spending tonight at a friend's place, so that you two can be alone.
OK.
Now you go to your hotel and l go home.
That's sad. l'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight, sweet dreams.
Goodnight
- Goodnight.
No Tania, you can't watch Sex and the City!
Watch Hannah Montana.. OK.. lights out at 1 0 o'clock. Bye!
Abhay!
- Hi..
You're still here.. let me help you. l need some advice from you.. again!
Ya, sure! Of course.
You know varun? Remember the guy l spoke to you about and.. l think you met him at dinner.
- Ya, ya, ya..
Thai tradition.. so what do you think?
What do you think about him? l don't understand.
OK. l think. l think he's going to ask me out, like on a date.. officially.. and l don't know what l want.. so what do you think?
What should l do?
Well.. do you love him?
Love? No, no, no, no. lt's too soon, l mean.. and anyway.. love is a fantasy.
Not that l'm negative about love or anything. ln fact in school and college l used to believe in love and fairytales.
You know, l used to believe that my prince charming would come and carry me off on his motorcycle.
And someone did come into my life, except that he wasn't any prince charming.
Anyway, after that l stopped believing in these things.
Cause.. now if l find anyone who keeps me happy and more importantly accepts
Tania in his life, then that's all.
That's more than enough.
And do you feel that varun is that guy?
Maybe..
Well if he makes you happy then l mean, l mean you should do whatever makes you happy.
You're right. ln any case, what are you doing here?
All this can be done tomorrow. And even Tania is at her friend's place.
You could have had the evening off.
What would l have done with an evening off?
You know, l would have just got bored in Singapore..
Are you kidding?
Singapore is such a nice place, and the girls here are very pretty.
You're a single guy, you should be having fun. l can't do all this!
Why not? C'mon! You never know, right? lt's possible that some special girl is waiting for you here and she'll never find you because you'll be here doing the dishes.
Such special girls don't wait for guys like me.
What kind of logic is that? Why not?
Because just like you.. these girls are also looking for their prince charming..
Fine..
- Ya.. and l'm no prince charming. l mean take a look at yourself, you're a beautiful girl.
You're beautiful and..
Thanks!
You're welcome! lf you go out looking for men, there will be a line outside your door.
There's not going to be a line-up of girls waiting for me. l doubt it.
Do you seriously believe that people are attracted to each other only on the basis of their looks, cause that's really shallow.
Ya! l agree, but that's the way of the world. l didn't make these rules.
Well, it's a stupid rule.
Because there are so many other qualities besides beauty.
Like intelligence, charm, personality..
Really?
Ya, really!
And if l prove you wrong..
How?
Let's have a bet. l'll bet with you but how will you prove it?
What? Do you even know how to use these?
No! But that's the point.
C'mon, these are Tania's!
Even better! Black?
Do you like make-up?
Ya..
- Good! Time to take it off. l clean my computer screen with this!
Screensaver! Great! Now wear it.
And for the final touch.
And you?
Spare! Ready? l think so..
No way, man!
Yes way, man..
Are you mad? Who looks like this? l can't go out like this, this is totally embarrassing.
Makes me look totally stupid.
- So, bet's off? Give up? l win?
Come on!
OK, fine, fine!
Me here, like this.. what's the plan?
The plan is, you here, like this.. it's impossible that any guy will even glance at you.
What rubbish!
- Ya! - lmpossible! lmpossible according to me, but as you can see there are so many bars.. if you can get even one guy's phone number..
Then you'll believe me?
- Ya.
That's all?
- Ya, just keep it geek, yeah?
Ya. OK. OK. l can do that, that's simple.
Watch and learn.
- l will.
Everyone here may not be beautiful yet, two hearts can still meet.. lt's possible.
Hey.. it's possible
Through the sheer strength of my heart l will find someone
And if not love at least
A phone number l will get lt's possible
Hey.. it's possible lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen, lt can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. ,love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No, no, love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. l can make you feel good
With my stories
And make you laugh all night
Whatever you ever want l will give
And in my depths l'll have you lose yourself
The one who is near you ls truly blessed. lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen it can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No no no no
Love impossible l say it's possible
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
We'll talk about random things
With tea
And at night
About fireflies
Your soft light laughter
With a pinch of sadness l'll give my heart away to you ln the midst of all this lf they could only see me
Not judge me let me be me lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen lt can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. lmpossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No no impossible lt's possible
Love lmpossible lts possible, hey yaa
No No love lmpossible lt's really possible
Just not possible
Trust me it's possible
Love lmpossible l just can't believe how people can be this shallow. l'm.. l'm sorry. l'm just really upset. l'm sorry, Alisha. l didn't mean to upset you. lt's not your fault,
Abhay. ln fact, you were right! l guess these are the ways of the world.
Alisha.. l can't change the way the world functions but to me.. you'll always be beautiful. You'll always be special.
And if you ever need me, l'll be there.
Of all days, l think, today is the day l needed to hear that the most.
Thanks, Abhay.
Hey, check this out!
That's the new Air with the faster processor and, oh my God!
Does it have Snow Leopard? l didn't know it was, it was out..
What are you saying, Abhay?
You must really like these computers and things, ya.. lt's my second love actually,..
Second?
No.. what l mean is.. whenever l feel sad l come to a place like this. ln fact, in
Singapore l come here itself. l hate them by the way.. hey, varun!
Coffee now? l..
.. actually l'm with a friend right now, l don't think l'll be able to make it.. you're OK with that, right? OK. Bye.
Coffee?
- Yeah.. - OK..
OK, boys and girls.. rehearsal time.
Krish, come here, come here, come here.
You sing after me, OK?
Say bada bada boom..
Bada bada boom. very Good. Bada Bada..
- Move fatso!
So?
- So?
What happened last night?
Give me the goss, Froggy?
Nothing, nothing like that.. but it was nice.
Nice, huh? Sweet! See, l told you l would help you, right? l know. You're the best ,Tania. Thank you!
Now go try on your costume. l have to go.
OK, everybody. Tomorrow is the launch of the software.
Alisha, would you run us through the schedule please?
Yes, of course. OK.
So the event is scheduled to begin at
3 in the presentation hall and.. Oh! l think you should know that a number of channels will be broadcasting it live across the world.
Gotcha! l will begin the event. A little brief on Pinnacle, then l will go on to introduce varun who will present the software and then the floor will be open for questions and answers.
Alisha, l'm impressed.
Just doing my job, varun.
That will be all, thanks for coming. All the best.
Bye..
Alisha!
- Ya! lf you're not doing anything tonight.. would you like to go out?
Oh, varun.. tomorrow is a very big day and l think we should both get some rest. Some other time perhaps?
Ya.. for sure, yeah. You're right!
We need to get some rest.. ,for sure but is everything alright?
Ya! Of course. Good luck for tomorrow!
Good luck to you too!
- OK.
Mom! My school play is tomorrow, you remember, right?
Of course, T. - You have to be there for the whole play.
Obviously! ln fact l've told CP that l'm going to be coming late for the launch, how cool is that?
Cool! And Froggy, you have to be there too!
Of course, Tania. l'll be there.
OK, now enough, go to sleep, OK?
OK, Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Hey, Froggy! l'm sorry, goodnight sweetheart.
- Goodnight.
Ya.. keep this with you.. there you are, sweet dreams.
Goodnight!
- Ya, goodnight!
Abhay?
- Ya?
Coffee? l'm making it so you know it'll be special. l'd love to, Alisha! Yes, Alisha!
You can say anything.. anything. l'd love to. lf you don't mind can l ask you a question? lt's a little personal.
Ya, ya, ya.
- Don't look so worried.
No, no, no. Please.. please ask.
OK. So last night you told me about your second love, right?
So, l'm presuming that there is a first love. l know you've never had a girlfriend, so what's the deal?
You really want to know?
Ya.
So, ya.. there was a girl.
The truth is that l'm still in love with her.
Oh! That.. that's really sweet.
Wow! Who is she?
There is a girl. lt's been seven years now and she still doesn't know. ln fact, she doesn't even know who l am.
Wait a minute. lt's been seven years?
Oh my God! You're such a loser!
Ya.. ya..
That's ridiculous! You mean to say that you've been in love with this girl for seven years and she has no clue?
You know that's stupid, right?
- Ya.
Any girl would want a guy to be madly in love with her. ln fact, she'd fall in love with you there and then!
Oh really?
- Ya! lf she does that she'll be making a mistake.
She should love me for me, not just because l love her.
Anyway, where is she nowadays?
Probably having coffee in some corner of the world.. with some loser.. you know how it is?
Alisha.. l want to say something to you..
Tell me.. l don't know what you'll think once you hear what l have to tell you.. l'm not really sure..
Try me..
Surprise! Surprise! varun?
- A little something for you.
Thank you!
Well aren't you going to invite me inside?
Of course. Please come in.
- Thank you!
So how you doing? Everything OK?
Ya, ya.. varun that's Abhay..
Abhay that's..
You? What are you doing here? l could ask you the same thing, varun.
You both know each other?
Ya well.. - l was going to tell you everything Alisha..
How do you know him?
Abhay is Tania's nanny. He takes care of the house.
Nanny?
Nanny!
Hi! Nanny. He's no nanny.
He's been lying to you.
His name is Abhay Sharma and he is really my nanny.
He's a madman who's been following me from lndia.
He's been trying to steal my software.
He wants to steal it and fool us all, right? He's crazy, Alisha.
By living in your house, he wants to use you to get to me.
That's a lie, Alisha.
A lie? So tell me, haven't you been following me from lndia?
Yes, l have been following him.
- Thank you!
Because the software is mine!
He's stolen it from me.
Your software? lt's his software?
You're lying again? l'm not the liar, you are.
- l'm the liar?
Ya
- l'm the liar? One second.
Alisha, why don't you ask if he's a nanny at all?
Alisha, please don't listen to him.
So answer his question then, Abhay.
- Please.
Are you a nanny or not?
No.
Exactly!
And l'm sorry for that, but this software is mine. l was going to tell you everything, Alisha.
Please give me a chance to explain.
What's left to explain? l trusted you, with Tania!
Your daughter? With this thief? l.. forget your software, Abhay.
Do l even know you?
Alisha, please, you've got to believe me. l can't, Abhay! l just can't!
Don't do this, Alisha, please!
Just go.
Alisha..
- You gotta leave.
Alisha..
- Now! You gotta leave now! - Alisha!
Please leave! Now! Leave now and don't come back.
You'll be OK?
Ya.. ya l'll be fine. l'm.. l'm sorry, varun. l think.. l think l need to be alone for a while, and anyway tomorrow is a big day for all of us.
Sure. But if you need to talk then just give me a call.
Ya, l will..
Take care.
- Ya..

Hey Mommy!
My superstar! You were so good!
But Tania, who told you this story?
Froggy!
But how would Froggy.. lt's been seven years now and she still doesn't know. ln fact, she doesn't even know who l am.
The truth is that l'm still in love with her.
Oh my God!
What happened, mommy?
And where is Froggy?
Why didn't he come?
He didn't come because of me. lt's my fault.
We'll have to look for him.
We have to find him.
C'mon Abhay, pick up the phone.
Have you and Froggy had a fight?
Kind of.. Tania, l think l made a big mistake and to fix it l'll have to find Froggy.
So where will we find him now? l think l know where l can find him!
Ladies and gentlemen. l welcome you all here today..
Firstly, l would like to thank you all for being here.
We at Pinnacle are proud to present a revolutionary new software..
We believe this software is going to change the face of the industry.
Mom! Don't waste time!
Ask the manager for help!
Ya, ya, ya, you're right!
Mr. varun Sanghvi.
Excuse me.. Hi! You see, this is an emergency and l need to make a really important announcement. ls that possible? Cause it's really important, you know.
Like ya!
Hello.. l'm looking for Abhay..
Abhay Sharma..
God, l hope you're here..
Mom.. c'mon! l got it. lf you're listening, Abhay.. l want to say something to you.
First of all, l'm really sorry.. that l didn't believe you last night. l should have known that you could never do anything like this.
You'd never deliberately hurt me,
Abhay, because you love me. l'm the girl you've been in love with for seven years.. and that night you were the one who saved my life and all those other things. lt was.. it was always you.
You always thought that l'm too good for you like l'm some princess who can't love you. l'm just a girl, Abhay, who's always looked for love in the wrong places.
When actually, true love was always in front of me.. l just couldn't see it..
'cause that's just me..
.. l'm stupid like that. l'm just a girl, Abhay but with you l feel like a princess..
So please just come out
'cause you're not the loser.. l am.
God, l really hope you're here.. l've always been here.. l'm..
Just don't..
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Today indeed is a great day.
A day when the entire world will come a little bit closer together.
Pinnacle Technologies and myself will present to you a software that..
Abhay, l know this software is yours.
A path breaking new Operating System..
Let's go!
So without further ado, let me show you what Unify can actually do.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the future!
Find Alisha quickly!
- l'll just check.
Would you excuse us a minute please?
What's the problem, varun? What is happening? l.. l don't understand. l checked everything yesterday and it was working fine..
Can you fix it? l'm trying to..
Alisha! This launch was your responsibility..
.. and you're coming so late! l know that ,CP.
Everything is falling apart!
Do something. Fix it! Now! l'll.. l'll OK.. varun, l think l.. l'll just..
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. l have a very important announcement to make here today.
The reason why Unify is not working is because Mr. varun Sanghvi is not..
.. the original programmer of this software.
What?
Alisha, what are you doing? l'm really sorry, but varun is not the original programmer of Unify.
Just.. just trust me. Please! l'd like to call upon the original programmer of this software.
Mr. Abhay Sharma.
Alisha! Have you gone mad?
You know l've developed this software, not that crazy guy! varun, don't..
- Alisha, explain!
CP, you trust me, right? Just listen to Abhay once, that's all l'm saying.
CP..
- varun, shut up!
CP.. what is happening? l just can't take this! varun. l want to hear what he has to say.
Thank you! Abhay.. l told you, varun. l also gave you a chance.
You didn't listen to me. Now l'm sorry. Sir, he's a fraud.
He met me in Mumbai, stole my software and came to
Singapore to sell it to you.
Whatever he's said to you is a lie.
He's nothing but a thief.
CP, this man is crazy.
Anyway, what proof does he have?
The proof is in front of your eyes, sir.
What do you mean?
- On the screen.
OK, so you're responsible for all of this? lf he locked the software with a password what am l supposed to do?
And how did he get access to the..
- Ya! l've done it.
But according to you, you made this software. - Yes, of course!
So if that's true and anyone locks it with a password, then you should be able to bypass it easily.
Sir, a real programmer would know this software so well that he'd easily be able to restart it.
CP!
- Just ask him to start it!
CP! l don't know what he's talking about!
Just get the password and get him out of here.. varun, why don't you do something?
Because he can't. You know that even if you want, you can never restart it because you never created this software.
CP..
- Abhay, can you start this software?
Ya, l just have to enter the password and it'll start.
Fine! Fine!
You bastard!
What is it? What's the password?
Give it to me. l'll give you the password but you'll have to promise me that you'll
Give Abhay the exact same deal that you gave varun. Exact same, CP.
OK, promise. Exact same.. now give me the password.
OK, what is the password?
You give the password..
Abhay, l don't know the password.
What's the password?
Of course you know what the password is, Alisha. lf you don't know then who will..
Can one of you please give me the password? Please!
Alisha! Alisha!
That's your password CP..
What?
Alisha.. my name.
Congratulations! Today you've become a really rich man.
Sir, this way please. l.. l think l should. l think you should..
Just say it.. l love you.. l know..
Froggy! So you finally gave the play a happy ending, right?
Ya!
- Come here, you. l told you, son.. it's possible.

THE DAY I WAS NOT BORN
Firstrace. 50 meters.
I'll leave this in the car, okay?
Take care of yourself Mimi, okay?
- I'll be back soon. -Yes.
And give me a call.
- I will.
Just call me when you arrive, and I'll call you right back.
Bye!You'll get your birthday present when you get back.
See you. Bye!
Shit!
You've got two new messages.
Message one...
Hi, Dad. It's me, Maria...
I missed my connecting flight...
I'm still in Buenos Aires.
I don't know when I can go on to Santiago. I lost my passport.
I'll call you later.
Bye.
Message two...
Hi, Dad. Where are you?
The passport will take time. I have to go to the police again tomorrow.
But don't worry, I'm at a hotel now, everything will be fine.
Something strange happened to me this morning at the airport...
I recognized a children's song.
But it was in Spanish.
Give me a call.
The number here is 0054114786...
Talk soon.
Dad? What? How did you get here?
- Hello.
Hi. Did something happen?
No.
So what are you doing here?
Dad... Are you not feeling well?
-Yes...
Sit down.
I'll get you something to drink, okay?
Wait here.
Do you know what you sounded like on the answering machine?
I was worried.
So you just take the next flight over?
That's how it is with old fathers.
Did I have one like this when I was small?
I don't remember.
Where did you get it?
I bought it here.
It seems very familiar to me.
I don't know, I don'thave an eye for things like that.
Stuffed animals all look the same to me.
But it's not a stuffed animal, it's plastic. Feel it.
We have to get you back on your travels again.
You can't be stuck here for three days.
- Why are you changing the subject?
I'm not changing the subject.
I told you I don't recognize that thing.
And what about the song?
Liliane always sang that to you.
In the beginning, when you came to us.
When I came to you?
Liliane and I are not your real parents.
You were born here.
In 1980... your parents disappeared.
What do you mean, ''disappeared''?
They were kidnapped by the military.
They never turned up again.
German? -Yes.
- Come with me.
This is usually not my job.
-The problem is,
I have to be in Santiago by tomorrow
It can't be that hard.
What else was in that bag?
My passport... uh... airline ticket, my calendar...
- Money?
No, luckily I had that in my pocket.
- Pesos or euros? - Pesos.
Can I see it? - What?
-The money. Can you please show me?
The one on top is fake.
That can't be,
I just got it out of the machine.
Yes, unfortunately, they're getting better and better, the fake bills.
As a foreigner with no passport... and walking around with fake money...
Some colleagues have no patience for such things.
It's up to you, but may be it's better you leave it here.
That's really well made.
Name?
Maria Falkenmayer.
Slower please.
How do you spell that?
Did you go swimming?
Maria, what can I do?
Tell me everything you know
We lived here for six years.
I wastransferred herein 1974.
Your father came into my department some time later.
The company had a kindergarten for the staff.
Liliane worked there.
You were in her group.
She always told me stories about you, long before I saw you the first time.
One evening...
... no one came to pick you up from kindergarten.
Liliane brought you over to our house.
Go on!
That was the day your parents were kidnapped.
It was morning.
You were still in kindergarten.
Some men broke into the apartment and dragged them into a car.
The neighbor saw it all.
That's what they told me later, at the office.
So you and Liliane knew my parents?
Yes, sort of. Fleetingly, through work.
What were their names?
Don'tyou want to tell me?
Luis Acosto and Marcela Milafana.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
We thought it would be better for you.
As a kid, would you have wanted to hear your parents were tortured to death?
Did everyone else know about this too? - No, just Grandma and Grandpa.
Crazy, I always thought that Grandma could never lie.
Do you know what Liliane often told me as a child before bedtime?
How it was to be pregnant with me.
The next coffee is on me.
Are you on break now?.
No, I'm working.
This corner is quiet, nothing ever happens here.
Except to tourists maybe.
But you have a good disguise.
Tourists wear bathing shoes.
Where did you learn to speak such good German? - Police academy.
''An old saw runs somewhat so:
Man must learn while here below''
You know it? Max and Moritz?
I know it.
My grandmother always used to read that to me.
She came from South Tyrol.
You know South Tyrol?
Drove through there once.
Drove through?
Please don't ever say that to my grandmother.
Was it nice, driving through like that?
Yes, best ''driving through'' of my life.
I have to go.
It was an honor... Maria?
Alejandro.
I'm off in half an hour.
Then I'll go and have a beer.
You can come with me.
Maria, are you in?
Anton?
Hi.
- Hi.
Have you already had breakfast?
- No.
Come.
Do you still want to go to Chile, or... would you rather return straight home?
There are only three Villafanas in Buenos Aires. May be I'll get lucky.
Can you call for me?
I don't speak any Spanish.
But you don't know if they have anything to do with you.
That's why we're calling them.
- But... Now slowdown, Maria.
This is not a thing that you can just ring someoneup for.
That's not what I meant.
What are you hoping for from this phone call?
I don't know I'll find out.
Anton, please.
He doesn't know anything either.
Are you lying to me?
- Maria, I'm not lying to you.
Hello?
What?
He said that he once had a niece with your name.
And what else did he say?
That you should stop by.
When?
- In an hour.
Do you really want to go there?
Are you coming with me?
No.
Do this alone.
So what did you talk about?
Not much.
They hardly speak any English.
Who was there?
My uncle and his wife, my aunt and my grandmother.
But she didn't recognize me.
Did anyone ask about me?
No.
They're throwing a party for me tomorrow
What are you doing later today?
- Nothing.
But it's Saturday, right?
Want to have another beer?
Without Bingo this time?
Yeah, okay.
Let's meet at the corner of Tacuari and Chile, in an hour.
I met your father this morning.
He's actually not my father.
No?
- No.
My real father disappeared during the dictatorship.
So you were born here?
Yes.
I see.
You've got funny ears.
Can I touch them?
The other one's like that too?
-Yes.
Can I touch it too?
- No.
The bathroom is over there?
It's me.
Hello.
Good morning.
Did you have breakfast already?
No, I had a walk around the block.
But if you hurry, we can still get something downstairs.
Who was that guy anyway?
Which guy?
The one who left your room early in the morning.
My secret lover.
Are you seeing each other?
Where did you meet him?
- Dad, that's none of your business.
Why are looking away now?
I didn't look away.
- Of course you just looked away.
Alright, just put some clothes on, and then leave it at that.
But I'm hot.
That's enough!
I'm going down for breakfast.
When you've cooled off you can join me.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you still remember what Liliane used to say?
With all the time you spend in the pool, might as well marry the lifeguard.
Let's fly back soon, okay?
We'll work it out...
... Dad.
Did you actually search for my family back then?
What?
What exactly did you do?
And you didn't find anyone?
I see.
No, I'm not hungry. Thanks.
See you later.
Hello.
This is my father.
He wants to know where you come from.
Ah, Germany...
The mother of my wife, she's from South Tyrol.
What in Argentine?
I have family here.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
- Sure. What?
Can you come with me to my family to translate?
I better not.
Why not?
Because I'm not good at that.
Sureyou are. Just say,
''Maria wants to know this or that,'' and then you tell me the answer.
Ale please, it's important to me.
- Maria, please.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
- I don't want to.
Why not?
- I have no business with such people.
What do you mean by ''such people''?
- Such complicated people.
Why ''complicated''?
We'll see each other later.
What had my parents actually done?
- I don't know. Probably nothing!
The military randomly imprisoned people during the dictatorship.
Over thirty thousand people disappeared.
Shortly after you came to us, we left the country.
And you just took me with you.
- Maria, you were three.
Should we have put you in an orphanage?
You didn't tell them what my job is, did you?
No.
I think we have to get off soon.
You didn't say anything about my father either?
No, why?
Your family surely doesn't want policemen in their house.
And no sons of policemen either.
What makes you think that?
The families of the disappeared don't like the police.
What are you trying to tell me?
- Nothing.
But you don't have anything to do with it.
No.
Was your father involved with the military?
I don't know
It was about the coffee.
She wants to know where we know each other from.
What did you tell her?
That I work in the kiosk.
She is... What's that person, when something happens to your parents, the one they bring you to?
- Godmother.
Can you ask her what happened to my parents?
Why they disappeared?
Marcela was assistant at the university and Luis was in the union.
At first they thought that your parents would come back.
But they never came back.
In the streets she looked at every girl your age to see if it was you.
I hope you get this message.
Please come back, we need to talk.
I'm waiting for you here.
I love you.
Why did you grow up in Germany?
Why I grew up there?
-Yeah, right.
With whom? What?
With whom were you in Germany?
My father and my mother worked here for a German company.
And when Marcela and Luis vanished,
I was placed with them.
Do you know which company?
I don't know
Hello.
- Hello.
I'm looking for my daughter.
I haven't seen her.
Is she with the policeman?
I don't know
They want to know what their names are.
My mother already passed away when I was sixteen.
She wants to know the name of your father.
Don't you want to tell them?
But it's not important.
They say it is important.
They don't have to worry, I was...
- I don't think it's about that.
What are they talking about?
-The woman from your kindergarten.
What's she saying?
- She was at his house.
What's she saying now?.
- She was at his house twice.
When?
Falkenmayer was Luis'boss.
-Yes, but when was she there?
Four days after your parents disappeared.
She was in their house but they said they didn't know anything about you.
He lied to her.
Maria! - What?
- He wants to talk to you.
Tell him I'm busy.
- It's urgent.
How did you get this number?
But I can't right now
I don't know
She says that people like Falkenmayer are in prison here.
Want to go back to the hotel?
Not really.
Do you have to go to work?
Yes, but I think I'm sick today.
Want something to drink?
Sure.
But I don't have anything. Water?
Okay.
- Sorry.
That's my son.
But he's already seventeen now
Do you get along?
- I don't see him often.
He lives with his mother in Spain.
Do you miss him?
Yes.
But he's doing fine there.
Do you now regret taking me with you?
No.
Did you really want to know all that?
What would you have done?
I don't ask as many questions as you.
Did you really never ask your father what he did during the dictatorship?
Why not?
I don't want him to tell me something that I would probably hate him for.
Just like me.
What are you doing here?
I want to apologize to you.
We had toc hange your date of birth, otherwise we couldn't have gotten you out of the country.
I should have told you that.
I'm sorry.
I'm flying back tomorrow
Please come with me.
What is this?
They know that you're here.
Why did you tell them?
I've also got a few questions.
You're lucky.
- What is this nonsense?
Goon!
You can ask me whatever you want.
The answer is:
They have the right to know!
Do you have any idea what this could mean for me? - It's not your turn.
Stop it now!
Call Estela and tell her you're sorry.
Who's Estela?
-You know damn well!
Estela is my godmother.
Four days after my parents vanished, she was at your house, looking for me.
But unfortunately, you knew nothing!
And unfortunately she believed you.
- I don't remember that.
I...
Maria, stop being naive.
These people are just telling you things to ease their conscience.
Who says this woman isn't lyingto you?
- Who says you're not telling more lies?
It's all along time ago!
I can't remember any of the details!
But they remember you!
They searched for me for years!
You could've called them, they have a telephone!
But we didn't want to call them!
Understand?
We wanted to keep you!
Don't you have to go swimming?
No, not today.
She says Anton Falkenmayer has to pay for what he did.
She wants you, her and the family to bring Falkenmayer to court.
They don't want to do it without you.
What he did was...
He stole you.
Have a good trip.
Yes.
As soon as you feed, Senator, you won't need these anymore.
Holy shit!
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!
Gross.
Damn it.
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.
Don't worry, we'll have you out of here in two minutes.
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!
Alan? Alan!
Alan!
Alan.
Alan. Alan, are you okay?
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!
Alan!
I am a vampire.
Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.
Hocus pocus.
Mr. Frog?
Yeah?
Were you sleeping?
I work nights.
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.
You're in default on your loans...
...and the bank is repossessing this property.
This would include any...
...structure currently on the property as well.
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.
Have a good day.
Fucking vampires.
Cash or store credit?
Cash.
Comes to 65 even.
Sixty-five dollars?
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...in nearly mint condition is worth 50 bucks alone.
In near-mint condition.
I know near-mint condition and that ain't it.
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.
It's been boarded and bagged since the day I got it.
Well, let's have a look.
There are stress marks at the staple points.
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent of its gloss...
...the pages are yellow...
...and there's significant rubbing and fading at the corners.
Hmm.
Now, if you were willing to part with that Batman number 14...
...I, uh, might be able to do a little bit better.
That's not gonna happen.
Happens to have some sentimental value to it.
That's my offer, Frog.
Take it or leave it.
All right, pay me.
Have a nice day.
I hate happy people.
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.
Did you make any money off of Frank?
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.
Here, let me see.
Uh, not that one.
But there's still some good stuff in here.
You want me to put it up on eBay, see what I can get?
Uh, sure, why not.
Every little bit helps right now.
Where do I find the graphic novels?
You mean comic books.
No, I mean graphic novels.
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.
Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.
- Try Barnes & Noble.
Whatever.
I guess you don't want me to spend any money here.
That guy gets on my last nerve.
- You know him?
- By reputation only.
His name is Jonny Trash.
He's a celebrity blogger.
What the hell is he doing here in San Cazador?
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?
- What's that?
- A rave.
And it's gonna be here?
If you believe the rumors.
But they're not telling anyone where it's gonna be until the night of the event.
Great.
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.
What...?
Bye.
Oh, shit!
Who the hell parked...?
My truck.
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded, meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.
Excuse me?
You're Edgar Frog.
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers and bloodsuckers the world over.
I'm sorry, lady.
You must have me confused with somebody else.
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.
You are the same Edgar Frog that destroyed covens...
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay and in Washington, D.C.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Can we go inside to talk?
You got two minutes.
It's my brother, Peter.
He's been kidnapped.
A couple of years ago, he started getting into trouble.
He was hanging out with all the wrong kind of people.
Hmm.
And three weeks ago, he went to Ibiza to this rave party thing...
...and he disappeared.
He started following around this guy, DJ X.
He throws these events called X-Parties.
Yeah, I've heard of him.
Hi.
The same people that are throwing this party...
...are throwing similar parties all over the world.
And at these raves, they're handing out this new designer drug.
It's called the Thirst.
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
Why would I care about...
...a bunch of drug addicts with glow sticks?
Because the Thirst is not a drug.
It's vampire blood.
Nobody has seen him since.
Edgar, they are using these raves to breed an army of vampires.
They're creating their own global pandemic.
They've already infected hundreds in Spain.
Done the same in Thailand, Rio and in Greece.
And now the rumors say that they're on their way here.
I'm not interested.
Look, I would obviously pay you for your trouble.
And this could well be the last time that you would have to do something like this.
All of my research suggests...
...that the Thirst is made from the blood of the head vampire.
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...
...meaning the first.
The original.
I knew that.
I'm still not interested.
And your two minutes are up.
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.
I know you couldn't save your brother...
...but, Edgar, maybe you can help me save mine.
Hmph.
Go and check on our guest, would you?
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?
Hmm. Poor little thing.
Just try to relax.
This will all be over soon.
Why would anyone jump out of a perfectly good airplane?
Because it's so fucking fun!
You make sure our package arrives in one piece.
And send someone to take care of Frog.
DJ X...
...the man behind the machine. I've been whoring the fuck out of your next party...
...on my website, and you can't even text me back?
You know how many media impressions that is a day?
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.
There...
...now you know him.
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...
...then I swear I'll make it my personal mission in life...
...to make sure that no one goes to any more of your stupid parties ever.
Well, we wouldn't want that.
After all...
...ever is a long time.
Step into my office.
I've got the blues
I've got the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
Why did you go?
Ugh. Creepy.
Why did you go
And leave me here with the blues?
And leave me here with the blues?
You left me sad and you left me sore
You left me with the lowdown blues
Hello, Edgar.
What brings you all the way down here?
Now I have to have an excuse to visit my own brother?
At 1 in the morning, yeah.
I figured you'd be up.
I've recently learned there's a nightcrawler...
...who's created a new designer drug that he's handing out to kids at raves.
The only problem is it's not a drug...
...it's vampire blood.
He's breeding an undead army...
...and the only thing that stands between him...
...and the annihilation...
...of the entire human race...
...potentially...
...would be us.
The Frog Brothers.
We haven't been the Frog Brothers for a long time.
I just...
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?
Sam's gone.
He turned, and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata with the entire Emerson family at this point.
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.
He's got a wife, kids.
He's got a real life now.
- Yeah, well, so do I.
- You call this a life?
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.
But at least I know what side I'm on!
Alan, if this is the head vampire, then maybe we can kill him.
If we kill him, then we just gotta find the one above him...
...and then on and on like that forever.
- They are telling me that this is the alpha.
The O.G. Of all bloodsuckers, the head vampire.
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.
Always has been.
What if this is it though?
What if this really is the head vampire?
Get this...
...and get it good, Edgar.
As far as I'm concerned...
...there's no such thing as vampires.
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...
...DJ X.
I'm sorry for those of you who have a shitty connection.
I guess you'll just have to take my word for when I tell you...
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.
They'll just have to come and see me in person.
Yeah, well, they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.
So, DJ X, why do you think the detached and the...
...you know, the disconnected youth of today have latched on so fervently...
...to your parties?
Because I create a place...
...where all the lost souls of the world can come together.
A place where they can do what they want...
...whenever they wanna do it.
Yeah, you heard it straight from the man himself...
...all you lost boys and girls. This is gonna be the biggest rave of the century.
And we'll let you know where it's gonna be an hour before this event...
...so stay tuned to this website for the deets.
That was a great interview, X.
Thank you so much.
No, no, thank you...
...for getting the word out.
I wanna have as many people at this event as possible.
It's my pleasure.
And I mean that.
So anyhow, what do you guys have to drink in this jalopy?
You.
Death to all vampires.
Maximum body count.
We're awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
Edgar.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Lots of weapons.
Lots of really expensive, custom-made weapons.
Well, of course. Come in.
Hmm.
Please have a seat.
So aren't you the least bit curious on how I know so much about vampires?
Not really.
I know who you are.
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author of the Eternity Kiss series.
First of which is about to be made into a major motion picture...
...coming soon to a theater near you.
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.
Don't be. Your books suck.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Doesn't really matter what I think.
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep all over the world...
...who eat up every last word of it, and keep coming back for more.
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living off your supernatural bodice-rippers.
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing reviews from every major periodical.
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.
Just like me.
What is your problem, Frog?
My problem?
My problem is you glorify vampirism.
You make being a vampire look...
...sexy.
Well...
...there has always been an element of eroticism in vampire mythology.
There is nothing sexy about being a member of the undead.
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake in coming to you.
If you came to me expecting me to ask for your autograph, then yes, you did.
But if you came to me expecting me to kill a shitload of vampires...
...that I can do.
Don't like the stake...
...maybe it needs a little garlic?
Here we go.
Freshly served.
Shit.
Eat that.
- Frog.
GWEN Edgar, it's Gwen.
Can you come by my hotel right away?
It's rather important.
All right. I'll be right there.
Hello, Edgar.
So, what's so important you need me to come down here right away?
Well, I thought you should meet your new partner.
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...
...and I'd really feel bad making him come all the way from Hollywood for nothing.
Hollywood?
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?
Lars Von Goetz?
Lars, this is...
Oh, yeah. The Toad.
Frog.
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.
Yeah.
I'm Lars Von Goetz.
But you already knew that.
And this is Claus, my camera operator.
So let's go kick the shit out of some little rave punks, huh?
But first, I gotta eat.
I got the metabolism of a 12-year-old boy.
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Right.
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.
As long as the check clears.
Lars Von Goetz?
You hired Lars Von Goetz?
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?
First you expect me to kill a head vampire...
...then you expect me to babysit some reality show reject?
You're not going to have to babysit him.
Haven't you seen his show?
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear, a lion and an alligator.
He's amazing.
That was staged.
All reality shows are staged, okay?
Von Goetz, whatever his name is, he's a fraud.
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.
- Well, I think he can take care of himself.
- We'll see about that.
That creepy guy's looking at me.
Oh, gross.
Here's the deal.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Right. You said that.
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.
He's a little twitchy about new faces.
Listen, buddy, if you're looking for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...
...it went out of business last summer.
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.
That's a very serious book, man.
Only five in existence.
Four, actually.
I'm always looking out for the other three.
Edgar, since I know...
...I'll never be able to talk you out of what you're about to do...
...I can't let you go up against a potential head vampire without giving you this.
One of the first books on vampire hunting ever written.
It'll hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.
P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday, be sure to call Mom.
It's her birthday.
ZOE Book O'Neer.
- Hey, Zoe.
I need your help with something.
- It's important.
Sure.
I'll be waiting.
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber hired you to find her kidnapped brother?
Yeah, and I think this book might help me figure out...
...where they've taken him to.
I need you to scour it for any clues, anything you can find.
I don't see how this old book is gonna help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.
Do me a favor.
If you happen to run across anything in here...
...that talks about human sacrifice or anything like that, make note of it.
All right.
Cool.
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?
Not really.
Could put your life in danger.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
Where's Frog?
Back off, fucko!
Or what? You gonna mace me?
Somebody needed a light?
Frog.
Ugly.
You're dead.
Suck on this.
Watch out!
Nice.
Mace?
Holy water.
I feel like pancakes.
Order up.
I found a whole section of young male vampire sacrifices.
And look, there's a Blood Moon.
They call it that because the moon's face is deep red or crimson hue.
So they're gonna make a sacrifice under the Blood Moon.
Exactly.
This Friday is a Blood Moon.
So they're gonna sacrifice Peter at the rave.
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...
...I need to find out where the rave is and I need to find out fast.
Well, technically, raves are illegal...
...so the promoters aren't gonna say where it is until the last minute.
You said that the rumor is that it was gonna be here in San Cazador.
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.
If we're gonna find out where that nest is...
...we need to learn how to think like a vampire.
Bloodsuckers have a tendency to look for a place...
...that's got a history of suffering and death.
You know of a place like that here?
There's an old slaughterhouse on San Cazador Island.
Slaughterhouse?
Perfect.
Nothing vampires love more than blood and carnage.
If there's a slaughterhouse on that island, that's where they'll be.
Let me go.
- I promise, l...
- Uh-uh-uh.
Let's not make any promises we can't keep.
You just lie here like a good piece of veal...
...and maybe I'll bring you a nice glass of warm milk.
Hmm.
So where are we going?
My friend likes his privacy.
The name's Blake.
Used to be a congressman before he learned the truth.
What's up with all the razor wire?
Yo, Blake. Open up.
It's Edgar.
Whew. Edgar.
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?
Holy-water grenade.
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.
Who the hell's this?
Oh, this is Zoe.
She's cool.
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.
Touch the cross. Do it now.
Zoe, manners.
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.
What's with the bike?
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.
Yeah. Unfortunately, wouldn't do us much good on this mission.
What else you got?
Welcome to the lair.
What happened to this thing?
Looks like something blew up in the barrel.
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.
Let's just say the gun came out on the winning side.
Nice new stuff, Blake.
I like it.
You looking for something to replace your Old Reliable?
Never.
Ah, you say that now.
Feast your eyes on this.
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.
Whoa.
Heavy.
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.
Not this one.
This one fires these.
What is it? Holy water?
Mixed with a little garlic.
Just for giggles.
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
What's this?
Hey, put that down, please.
Very carefully, okay?
That is a prototype resin grenade.
I stole it from a military testing facility at Groom Lake.
What does it do?
- Oh, shit.
Cool.
Yeah, cool.
I will take that other resin grenade, though.
Gotta hand it to the grays...
...they sure are good at making weapons.
Well, it's a pleasure doing business with you, Edgar, as always.
Mm.
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.
Yeah, you do.
What the hell are these?
Those?
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.
Vampires.
They must have tracked us here.
What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.
They've taken out the UV lights.
Hi, sweetheart, aren't you gonna invite me in?
No. You're not invited.
Wait. Where are you going?
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.
They'll kill us if we go outside.
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!
Say hello to Old Painless.
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.
It's cool, right?
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.
If all of these freaks go to the island and take the Thirst at the rave...
...we're gonna have a full-on vampire invasion on our hands.
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?
Let's roll.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Hey. You didn't tell me...
...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
Yeah.
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
Oh, yeah.
That guy is a total animal.
Yes, baby.
You see the episode where he wrestled the grizzly bear?
- Missed it.
Oh, yeah.
Toad.
Hmm.
So, hmm, who's your friend?
Hi. I'm Zoe.
Zoe.
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...
...or is there some serious chemistry between us?
That's just you.
Okay.
Edgar.
I hope you brought your bathing suit.
I thought we should blend in with the other partygoers.
Covert infiltration.
It's a good idea.
Hi, I'm Gwen.
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.
You work in a bookstore?
Part-time.
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified for this mission?
Just how many bloodsuckers have you killed, Miss Lieber?
- None.
- More qualified than you.
Well, this is Edgar's show, and I trust him.
Did I mention I hated her books?
So do I.
Rave!
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse through a series of underground tunnels...
...which will lead us directly to where the rave is.
Now, remember, everyone, there will be a lot of civilians around.
Toadies, not familiars.
Just innocent partygoers who are all there because they think they're gonna have...
...fun.
Because of this, you will be armed...
...with weapons that are non-lethal to anything with a heartbeat.
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.
Patent pending.
Turns holy water...
...into holy slaughter.
Zoe, you take it.
Claus...
...it's a high-powered UV torch.
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.
Edgar, what about me?
You're staying here.
The hell I am!
This is my brother we are talking about.
I understand that...
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.
Everybody on this mission is a trained veteran.
You could be killed, or worse...
...you could be turned into one of them.
Okay, time out.
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into your little vampire goth games...
...that's what you're paying me to do, but I'm calling bullshit.
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.
Not as long as I'm in charge of this mission.
It's all right, Lars.
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.
He's an experienced vampire hunter.
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you...
...but there are no experienced vampire hunters...
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.
Hmm.
Zoe, take these stakes, strap them to your leg.
And why does she get stakes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with your bare hands. You don't need weapons.
No, it was 10-foot.
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.
There's some stakes.
Why are hers metal?
You get what you get.
Let's go.
Edgar, wait.
Bring him back safe.
I'll do my best.
Move out.
Hey, Toad.
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.
No. Vampires feed at night...
...and I don't plan on sticking around for dinner.
Is this the VIP room?
Oh, most definitely.
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.
You guys got here early.
Oh, are those promise rings?
- So cute.
Is that blood on your face?
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.
Forget the coccyx, is the camera okay?
Radio check.
Check.
Check.
Check.
All right. Once inside, our main objective is to extract Peter.
Killing vampires is our second priority.
All right, everybody...
...let's rock 'n' roll.
Heads up.
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?
Shh.
What?
Did you name your new gun yet?
What are you talking about?
All guns need a name.
Like boats.
Boats are for sailors...
...guns are for soldiers.
I'm no sailor.
- Lars.
What?
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.
This shit's freaking me out.
Jeepers.
All right, here's the deal.
We're gonna go to the left, you guys go to the right.
Zoe, you're with me.
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.
We'll reconvene back on the beach...
...maybe.
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.
People in horror movies always split up and they always get killed.
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?
This is all some stupid role-playing game.
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
You think this is a game?
Of course I think it's a game. Why else would the Toad give me a water pistol?
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me tackle every natural predator on the planet.
Now, we need to give them something new to watch.
But if you're right...
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
I know.
Isn't it great?
This is the entrance to the slaughterhouse.
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.
Ow.
Claus, we gotta find a place to do my intro.
Oh, yeah.
This is perfect.
Okay.
Using my tracking ability, we've located the nest of the vampires...
...deep within this abandoned slaughterhouse.
It's also haunted...
...by cannibal pirates.
It's built on an ancient Indian burial ground...
...where they used to burn witches.
Oh.
A promise ring.
Virgins.
Vampire filet mignon.
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?
Are you Peter?
Please, help me.
Dude. Turn around, let's go.
- What?
- It's too early to find him.
We gotta find him at the end of the episode.
I haven't even had the chance to put the beat-down on any goths yet.
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.
What the fuck?
Where are you bastards going?
Something smells really bad in here.
It's a slaughterhouse.
I don't mean the typical bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...
...I mean I smell something...
It smells like rotting garbage.
Trash.
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.
No.
I mean Jonny Trash.
Jeez Louise.
Jeez Louise? Really?
Zoe, get down!
You hear that?
What?
I think it's coming from down there.
What are you doing?
Lars.
Lars.
Dude, where's my gear?
You left it up...
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh, okay.
Is this it?
I've been waiting 300 years for a good fight.
Have you had enough, punk?
Nice outfit.
That's funny...
...that's exactly what I was thinking.
But I still have to kill you.
I'm surprised.
By what?
You're really not that good.
- Aah!
Edgar!
Zoe. I got this.
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!
See, now that's what happens when you don't name your gun.
Just pull out the sword!
- On three.
- Okay.
Three.
What happened to one and two?
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.
Lars, what's your 20?
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?
He's dead.
Lars is dead.
We're so completely and totally fucked.
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.
We have to get Edgar out of here before reinforcements arrive.
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
Just help us lay him down.
Claus, first-aid kit.
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Hold this.
Edgar, stay with me.
Notice anything unusual about Santa Carla yet?
No, it's a pretty cool place...
...if you're a Martian.
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you know what's happening around here, don't you?
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.
Yeah. You think we just work in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.
This is just our cover.
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
We're fighters for truth...
...justice...
...and the American way.
Edgar.
- Edgar.
- What?
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?
Claus found him, but they ran into some trouble.
They had him tied to some twisted table kind of thing...
...pumping him full of drugs, trying to keep him sedated.
Where's your boss? Von Geek?
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut of a vampire got him.
Tore his heart right out of his chest.
Got it on tape, though.
I'd like to see that when you get a chance.
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.
Gwen...
...it's gonna be okay.
We'll get him.
It's not over yet.
Payback's a bitch.
Damn straight. Let's go.
Rave! Rave!
It's starting.
All right, come on.
Hey!
Hey, there.
Do you wanna party?
LILY And now, the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!
Are you ready for a sacrifice?
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Hold up.
Oh, my God. There he is.
If they get through that fence, we're so undeniably fucked.
The sooner we take out X, the sooner that won't be a problem.
Okay, but what about Peter?
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.
I've only got one shot at this.
I'm gonna immobilize X and then we go in for the kill.
Everybody, stay put. Got it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Put on something nasty, X.
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.
He dropped it. I'm going in.
Zoe, wait.
Get in here and help me. Come on.
That is exactly how I'm going to break your neck.
Vinyl still shreds.
Very creative, Frog.
But when it comes to killing...
...I prefer more traditional methods...
...like impalement.
Claus, cover us!
Shit. Shit.
You fought admirably.
But you were doomed to fail from the start.
I've fought beside great warriors...
...learned battle techniques...
...that can only be mastered over several lifetimes.
And do you know what the first rule of combat is?
Yeah, don't monologue.
There's a lot of vampires down here.
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.
Fuck me. Fuck me!
Edgar!
Nice work. I've got it.
You're right. Impalement is good.
Especially when you pierce the heart.
Peter.
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Peter, can you hear me?
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.
Edgar, something's wrong.
Yeah, I'd say.
No, I mean we killed DJ X, but I don't feel any different.
Something's wrong.
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.
Edgar...
...this smells like garlic.
Garlic?
Let me see.
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.
You're the alpha.
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.
Thanks to you.
If X had been able to drink my blood during the Blood Moon...
...my power would have passed to him...
...and that would have been a shame.
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...
...but you must feed.
I brought you Edgar Frog, just like you asked.
Now it is your turn.
Remember your promise to me.
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.
Oh...
...you won't.
They're all yours!
Alan, wait!
No, no, no, this is not a good time for the batteries to die.
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.
If we don't kill Peter right now...
...there's gonna be a thousand emo-goth vampires out there.
I need you to warn the world.
Especially in case I don't survive.
That's not an option.
I'll be waiting.
Just go.
Come on.
Claus.
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.
This is no way to treat your savior.
Savior? You got a funny way of looking at things, kid.
I saved you from a life of Ioneliness.
You didn't want to end up like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.
Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.
The ones without pictures and word balloons.
Robert Neville, the protagonist in I Am Legend.
Last man on Earth in a world full of vampires.
Is that really what you want to become?
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.
I will, if necessary.
But that would be a shame...
...especially since I owe you a debt for killing X.
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?
A father can't murder his own children.
That would be in bad taste.
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.
I told him you can't turn all the cattle into cowboys...
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.
But he didn't listen.
And now, thanks to his damned raves...
...there are going to be far too many vampires roaming the Earth.
That's where you come in.
Keep the population down to a manageable size.
Plenty of blood to drink.
Everybody's happy.
Precisely.
Which is why I want you to keep on doing what you're already so very good at.
Hunting and killing vampires.
So you want me to be your own personal hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?
Crudely worded...
...but yes, that's the general idea.
And what makes you think...
...that I won't just kill you myself?
Nothing.
Except that you have no real reason.
Think about it, Edgar.
Your brother's already one of us.
Everyone you care about is either dead or playing for my team.
What do you say?
I say...
...why don't you go suck yourself?
Alan, kill your brother. You'll feel better.
Alan, no.
Don't do this.
You're my brother.
You're a Frog Brother.
Don't make me hurt you.
I told you not to make me hurt you.
Last chance, Edgar.
What the fuck?
Fuck you!
You okay?
Yeah.
Fang check.
Hmm.
Death to all vampires?
Maximum body count.
We are awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
That's enough of that.
Hey. I thought you went to the beach with your brother?
I did, actually, but, uh, he wanted to stay out there longer.
He stays out much longer, he's gonna turn into a human piece of beef jerky.
I guess he's making up for lost time.
Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.
I sold your copy of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...for 500 bucks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's great.
That should keep the bank off my butt for a while.
Now, Zoe, there's something I need to ask you.
How did you know vampires are real?
Just a hunch.
What are you reading?
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book into my Kindle.
I decided, you know...
...I might as well educate myself about all the possibilities of the dark underworld.
For example, did you know that lycanthrope...
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...
...actually can change anytime they want to?
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.
They can turn anytime they want to.
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.
Now, that's an interesting theory.
Wow Dimple!
What wow? Can't see any cleavage!
There has to be some to see some.
Look after your lemons, you might just lose them.
Look Preeti's is here, wear your blouse at least.
Bossing, me in my own house. put it on l am ready guys
You delay, us always.
Move aside my phone is ringing
Sunny!
You will say ' l love you' a hundred times if you see me today. l am looking Red hot.

Let's go.
Sunny has been waiting for so long to see me.
Lets go.

Wait for me at the banquet hall.
Don't stress.
- Ok bye.
Ok bye.

Take your helmet off.
- Come on we are late.

Hello uncle
- l have told her so many times.
Uncle, there's a lot of weight here,
Let me put her down first then, you can scold me. l think she can answer your questions only in the morning.
Who are you?
Sunny. Boyfriend. l am a trainer at the
Power house gym. GK branch.
Dimple and l met there.
Upstairs would be better?
Aunty
You are a body builder, right?
So body builder, now tell me, what did you do to my daughter?
Had l done something l wouldn't have brought her back in one piece.
Out here they are killed and stuffed into an oven. l respect you a lot Sir,
Dimple has told me everything about you, self-made man...
To start from a garage...
...and establish such a huge property empire is no joke. l wanted to meet you myself, but not like this.
With a presentation of a plan for a chain of All-lndia Gymnasiums... anyway not now, you must be tired. l'll make an appointment and meet you later. l am your daughter's boyfriend. l won't do anything wrong.
Trust me.
Should l park the car inside?
How will you go home?
Bus, auto, l'll take anything, l left my bike at the gym.
Take the car and bring it back in the morning, but don't get even a scratch on it. l won't get a scratch on it,
Not on the car nor on your daughter.
Good night Sir, aunty...
Good night, son l had to brush four times to get rid of the Vodka smell.
What if papa had caught me? And you?
Walked out making a good impression, and making me look like a fool.
Couldn't you stop me when l was chugging the shot?
What happened? Why did we stop?
Should l get off?
What're you doing Sunny?
What're you doing Sunny?
Where you going Sunny?
Bloody murderers, finished off my mother and father, you will rot in this house.
Why are you throwing stones?
Broken all the panes, you die...
Shut up, you bitch,
Netarpal! Netarpal! Oye, Rawat!
Catch him, don't let him go.
Run Sunny Run
Start the bike, go go go...
Where are you running? Stop.
Sorry.
Sunny, tell me the full story.
You've lost 3 kilos, you deserve a chocolate. l am leaving.
- Listen...
You have enough problems of your own, why do you want to hear mine? you call me your girlfriend, can't even share your problems with your girlfriend?
That house is mine
Yours?
My grandfather built it, papa was born there... when my grandfather got transferred, he put the house up for rent.
And when he came back those Mother... those MFs did not leave the house.
My grandfather filed a case.
Fighting the case, he died first then my father and then mother, along went the entire bank balance.
After three deaths the court ruled in favour of the tenants under the Rent Control Act of 1947.
Now, they pay only 1,500 rupees rent for such a big house and l pay a property tax of 60 thousand every year and if l don't pay up then l get an arrest warrant. l am sorry, l didn't mean to grumble.
Your pain, my pain
No, you look best laughing.
Don't get involved in my tears.
We will all laugh together, and make those MFs cry.
How?
Good evening Dimple ma'am
Papa help, there is big crisis.
Dimple? Mr. Kamal is here.
Uncleji, can you step out please?
Mr. Chaddha, what's this nonsense?
2 minutes please
Not nonsense! l am Dimple Chaddha.
This shop is named after me. l am telling you politely to wait outside, once our meeting is done then, you can have your's.
OK? Happy? Out!
Papa, help us.
Us? Means?
- Me and Sunny. Ours.
Get Sunny back his bungalow.
Sunny has a bungalow?
Yes, on Barakhamba Road.
Sunny owns a bungalow on Barakhamba Road?
Where do you think you are entering?
Throw this out
Throw this out as well
Take this, break this, come on.
Uncle can l have a look inside?
Of course, it's your bungalow, you are the landlord.
You are the king.
Dimple!
- Yes mom?
No issues, have a good look. lt's a proper bungalow.
Nice, isn't it? lt's cute. lt has an old world charm.
Come up stairs, there's more.
Ya lets go
From where?
- Come from here.
We are going upstairs.
Papa made this map himself.
He was born in this room.
Papa Sunny's father was born here, it's so exciting isn't it?
But the condition of the house is not very exciting.
That's not the point uncle. l am sure, Papa and Papa's papa are both thanking you from there you made it possible for his son and his grandson to stand here.
Son's son.
You won't be standing for long. lt's best you sell this while the market is still piping hot,
No uncle this house has an emotional value.
Two crores, it will fetch, just like that.
With a constantly leaking roof, these seeping walls, you will always need security here.
How will you manage on your salary?
Sell it.
Buy a 4 BHK flat for
1 crore in a suburb
Either in Gurgaon or Greater Noida. and with the rest start a gym.
You can't be a trainer all your life, can you? lsn't it a plan?
Pamme, get the bag...
Now where will you run around selling-buying?
Fine this will be on my own head.
No l can't trouble you.
Dimple's problem, my problem.
20 Lakhs advance, rest 180, after the deal is done.
Done?
Done?
Done.
Superb!!
Will you keep staring at the cash or will you hug me?
Not her, me!
Bye, Sunny
You don't care if it's a friend or an enemy.
You've taken his 8 crore house forjust 2 crores!
He is our Dimple's boyfriend!
So he's not going to be a boyfriend forever...
Papa! l mean, soon he will become the son-in-law... and everything will be his... right Dimple?
What is this nonsense, Sharma? lt's not nonsense, it's a warrant.
You entered my house and beat up my people.
Arrest him.
You say it's yours and l should believe you?
Mr. Sharma l've bought it, legally, from Sunny Singh.
An advance has been paid, the entire paper work is ready, l even have the original map made by poor Sunny's dad.
Only the registration is left.
- Registration is not possible.
Why is not possible? - Not possible because, a family feud...
...has been going on since my father's death.
A stay order has been imposed on that house. lf you have a map l have the original documents for this property. l don't see any Sunny Singh in these. l think he's tucked you up.
Listen carefully.
- Yes sir.
Call Surti...
Tell him before sunset my bail should be done before sunset. lf l have to spend even one night in jail, believe me l'll have everyone buried in this market itself.
Papa, where are you going?
Papa what happened ? Sharma Uncle?
The Urban Ministry's secretary happens top be my brother-in-law.
He'll usurp my bungalow.
- Put him in there...
Papa, don't be scared, l'll be there with Mummy and Sunny lf you meet Sunny again l'll break your legs. No meeting Sunny.
Let's go Sharma.
Why Papa?
No he was Anup's substitute.
He was to leave on Friday, but he left three days early.
But Anup will be back on Friday.
But it looks like
Sunny really suited you.
You're looking fit.
What're you scared of?
Why don't you give your papa, that picture of Sunny, you took?
Dad will kill me if l even step in front of him.
Thank God he got out on bail today, or else it would be my neck. l am sure even your dad wants his 20 Lakhs back right?
Give it. Your dad will find him.
He's not going to get us married even if he finds Sunny.
Papa is going to kill him in the centre of the market.
Now a Sunny-Dimple match is impossible.
You're impossible.
Still dreaming of Sunny. lt's Papa's fault as well.
Sunny hatched a clever plan...
...but Papa should have been a bit smart too.
Why was he duped? l love him Gurmi.
You are crazy Dimple...
At times, one has to lose to win, and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'
Beware oh ladies l am wicked.
Oh ladies l do my misdeeds...

Fifty printers for seventy five lakhs!
We had orders to get the best.
Of course you had to get the best.
Best at the right price!
Did someone put a gun to your head to get it at the seller's price?
You are the buyer, you fix the price. Buyer is king. l am sorry Raina. - l can't take the blame for every mistake.
The bosses will punish the culprit.
So be ready to be fired. lf you speak to him, he won't fire us
Please cry in your cubicle not here. OK?
Listen everyone market is tough,
'Smart ones stay, ldiots sent away'
Smart or idiot you choose.
The rest is all good...thanks.
Sir, yes Sir, coming Sir.
Fire the interior designer.
Sir.
- He has left such a huge blank space. l want Hussain's horses on this wall.
At any cost.
You have an impressive reputation,
Raina Parulekar.
You can make the impossible, possible...
So will there be a Hussain on the wall on the inauguration day?
Yes Sir.
Yes, Nikhil Sir.
- What about the Hussain?
Oh, they are quoting 5 crores
That's too expensive. l know, l am trying other art galleries as well.
OK.
Yes? - Ma'am the painting you asked for will be available next month.
No, no, no, l need it in 72 hours.
- But Ma'am...
What will l do with it after a month?
Put it in my bedroom?
Will an Anjolie Raman do?
No, Anjolie Raman won't do. l need a Hussain. Only a Hussain.
Moron.
Move it, what's going on?
Lady, lady... relax... please... l am honking at the truck, not you, so mind your own business.
The truck is mine and so is the business.
You look like the transport type guy!
Now move it, l am getting late. lt won't move till everything is off-loaded.
Keep honking
Careful! Careful! Careful! lt's not a painting, it's a Hussain.
M. F. Hussain. lt's a masterpiece.
Do you know how much it's worth? lf something happens to it then...
Carefully
- Yes Sir.
Just be careful! Easy does it!
One second. How much is it?
Five bucks for 100 grams.
Eat in or take away?
Okay, l know it's not peanuts. lt's art, creative and all that, but how much are you selling it for? lt's an exhibition for art lovers.
Over here?
My gallery, lndigo. The opening is this evening. lnvitation. Come over if you are interested in art... lf you want to buy spicy peanuts then the Mithibai
College has the best chutney. ldiot! lndigo... lndigo... lndigo...
Deven ldiot Shah...
Market value Rs. 80 lakhs.
Not for sale!
Why not for sale Mr. Shah?
Why not?
Looking for the price tag?
5 bucks for 100 grams, freshly baked.
Ninety lakhs... Deal?
And l thought you were genuinely interested in art. lt's to decorate the office.
What? l like honest... l hate fake. lt's impossible to buy.
Nothing is impossible.
Honestly. The painting isn't mine to sell. lt's borrowed from the Suri brothers for the exhibition.
Mr. Suri Steel and Power Suri?
- Yes.
Manoj and Maneesh Suri. Joint owners.
Couldn't you have said that earlier?
You wouldn't have been here then.
You would've found someone else to flirt with. l can set up your meeting with the Suris. lf you can convince them, you can have your painting.
And you your commission. lt's a hard-earned commission, no cheating.
Raina Parulekar
Deven Shah...
Call me Dev.
Deven, if possible it would be better to have a meeting with the older brother.
His position is weaker, he will surrender faster.
Surrender! To Raina the tigress...
The meeting should happen tomorrow.
The day after the painting has to be up in office for the opening.
At such short notice, only a phone conversation will be possible.
Phone is good... Bye then...
Sir, l need the financial stats of Suri Power and Steel...
Buying-selling ratios... last quarter...
Forget about the Suri's,
Raina, we are two days away.
Concentrate on the Hussain. l am focused on that sir.
Hello?
- ls this Raina Parulekar?
Yeah. - l am calling from Mr. Manoj
Suri's office, to inform you that
Mr. Suri is not interested in selling his Hussain painting.
Oh, but we are offering more than its market value. l don't know ma'am, it's Mr. Suri's decision. l am just conveying the message. Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait... can you let me talk to him please?
My boss's orders, l have to get that painting.
Please
Okay... only an employee can understand another. l will try...
Hello. Manoj Suri here.
We will not sell that painting.
Hussian is the pride and glory of Suri Steel and Powers.
Hussain is the life of our company.
Mr. Suri, the market value of the painting is Rs.80,00,000.
We are ready to pay 90.
You are ready, l am not.
One crore lt's an insult to Mr. Hussain.
One crore twenty final.
You are insulting me... lt's your younger brother who is going to insult you.
What do you mean by that?
You and me both know that your brother wants to take 51 percent of the shares so he can sideline and eventually oust you.
There's bound to be a spilt in the company and its assets.
Will the Hussain be yours or his?
Who would've thought that one's own brother would deceive them? lf we pay you half in cash, the rest 60 Lakhs by cheque... with receipt, which will officially make the price 60 Lakhs.
Half of which will be your cheating brother's part, making his total 30 lakhs, and your share 90 lakhs. l hope causing him a loss of 90 lakhs will be give you some sort of... how do say it?
Peace... yes it will give some peace.
So, deal?
Yes, but give the lndigo broker, his commission on the full price.
Why should he incur losses in my fight with my brother?
Mr. Manoj Suri... you are a very nice man. l know l know... anyway, take the painting from the gallery, give the boy his commission and also hand him my suitcase with cash in it.
Get the cheque sent to my office by speed post.
Are you sure?
Hand over 60 lakhs in cash to that Dev guy?
He is a sweet simple chap, he won't even open the bag.
Okay, bye.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Careful, guys please.
Tigress Parulekar, so you made Suri surrender.
Worked that magic. Very nicely done.
There is no such thing as magic.
Honest, hard work.
A cheque for your commission,
-Thank you. and this briefcase for Mr. Suri lt will reach him.
All clear between us?
All clear.
Cheers to Raina!
To Hussain!
Since his death it's become more precious.
Sir Mr. Suri...
Manoj Suri?
- Yes sir.
Please tell me, when are you getting here?
Forget that, first tell me how did you set claims on my Hussain painting?
We never had any deal,
What rumors are you spreading?
Hello...
Call Raina... Now!
Yes sir.
- The painting is not a fake, Sir...
Mr. Suri is confused.
Mr. Suri is the owner of Suri Power and Steel, not a desperate manager level employee who will use cheap tricks to get ahead.
Not a cheap trick, Sir. l only followed your orders.
The orders were to get a genuine painting, not a fake.
How will l justify such a big scam?
Not a scam, Sir... mistake
Really?
And who will prove it's a mistake or a scam? l'll prove it, Sir.
You'd better Raina Parulekar.
You'd better
At times, one has to lose to win, and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'
Raina Parulekar, someone has conned your company and sold a fake
Hussain painting to you.
How are you feeling?
There is speculation that it's not a con but a scam, and you are involved in it too.
Do l look like a scamster?
Am l a thief? l have a B Tech degree from llT, and an MBA from llM.
Raina don't, let the lawyers handle it.
No, Sir, let me speak. l am an honest employee of
Synergy Communications... l love my job, this company. l will never con my bosses, l've been conned.
A man called Deven
Shah has conned me...
Surely this is not his real name or his first con
For him it was just a way to make a quick buck but for me my honesty, my identity, my commitment, my job, my future all is at stake. l am going to track him down, recover the company's money, get him arrested and prove he is the criminal and l am innocent.
Yeah?
Raina from Mumbai?
Who is this?
Dimple from Delhi.
You have the wrong Raina, l don't know any Dimple...

You mean l am stupid? l didn't let it get to that.
But he conned me for 60 lakhs.
Lol! 60! He could only get 20 from me.
You are more stupid than l am.
OK, l am more stupid than you.

Dimple, did lqbal con you as well?
Yes, as Sunny Singh.
Did you get the photo?
Yes, it is lqbal. l took it. lt's useful isn't it?
You are really smart Dimple.
Raina? Did you hear that?
Saira, tell me the truth, did he make you his girlfriend as well? lf you give Saira a chance to speak then she can actually tell us. Tell us, Saira... lmmediately after my graduation l was married off to Adil.
You're married... love marriage?
Arranged.
After three years Adil died in an accident.
His parents are just as nice as he was. l've been with them for the last two years.
So when did you meet Sunny?
While going to my shop in the morning.
Stop stop.
No hell would break lose if you stop.
Hey, don't touch them. l picked them. l missed my bus, You can't enjoy them.
No way.
They look so sweet, but taste like poison.
Ticket!
Pass!
Pass... don't say it, show it.

He had done his research.
From which bus stop, and at what time l take the bus.
Which area the shop is in, what time it opens, everything.
By buying of the ticket, and the thank you the mention not he got familiar with me, and soon reached our lane.
Hey listen,
Shambhu take the payments.
Hey Mr. Suitcase?
Blue shirt?
My mind had glazed over, l smiled and led him right into the shop.
Royal Cloth Merchant. Our shop's name.
My name is lqbal l am Saira.
What's the rate?
Rupees 450 a meter.
He even chose the right time to enter the shop,
Greetings.
- Greetings. he knew my father-in-law brings lunch at that time. - Greetings.
Just as father entered, he began showing off his knowledge about fabrics.
Khan, lqbal Khan. lt took him hardly ten minutes to have my father wrapped around his finger.
Tie-dye is popular here?
Yes. There's an entire colony for the tie-dye.
Which way would that colony be?
Which way would that colony be? lt's through the by lanes, you'll get lost if go on your own. l would've shown you had the property tax guy not been coming.
Saira why don't you show him?
Me?
Ya go ahead. l'll manage here.
OK.
While he was showing his fake sympathy and kindness, l was melting like an idiot.
Cold drink? lce cream?
Shall l show you something?
Allah... the Pandora's box is opening today.
What is this?
Real intricate threadwork Zardozi. l've never seen such intricate work before.
We have our own workshop in Bareli, traditional weavers.
As there are no sales in smaller towns, my friends said that
Lucknow would be the right place.
Now the dealers here show interest but not cash. l am almost through with the money l had.
Back home my mother and both my sisters are worried. l'd better head back home. lsn't it exquisite?
What are you quoting for this?
400 rupees a meter
No one is ready to pay even 400. Such swindlers!
And they will sell it for a 1,000.
Your losses won't be a profit to us!
But 400 is too low my friend. l'll give you 500 rupees a meter
And l'll place an order for 5,000 meters.
10 lakhs advance... and the balance of 15 lakhs on delivery.
Agreed?
Poor father, he struck the deal blindly for me.
Hoping that this friendship would turn into a relationship, and end my loneliness.
Have some sweets to celebrate.
Wow
The following day father gave him 10 lakhs, cash.
He promised to return in two weeks time.
Wring the Zardozi
Saree around his neck and hang him in the city centre.
That's provided we find him.
You guys have his photo why don't you inform the police? lf he gets to know the police are looking for him he will go underground, and we will never get our money.
No police.
Look, l have a plan.
Everything will be possible if we join forces.
Why don't both of you come down? lt's impossible for me.
Papa has imposed various bans on me.
Fine then sit in your homes, and let more Sunnys and lqbals make fools out of you.
Bye.
Go lt has been bothering me too.
But then l didn't say anything thinking about Adil. l was wrong...
But even if Adil is not here anymore... you are.
No, you are not going on any trip.
Gurmi, Puchki, Choti are all going.
Well no bodybuilder in their house has swindled them of 20 lakhs. lf l have done something wrong once it doesn't mean l'll be doing it all my life.
Even you have made many mistakes.
Weren't you conned in the
Bhatia shop deal, for 12 Lakhs?
The Pancholi Bunglaow, the Preet Vihar flats, but did you shut down your property...
...business because of your mistakes?
You've grounded me! l never thought you'd play such a double standard game with me Papa.
Let her go.
Dimpy, will you travel business class or economy?
Raina!
Dimple?
Come on, l've been waiting for so long.
But l was right here.
But you didn't come in front of me...
Okay, sorry.
Nice glares...
Aren't they?
Are you still in mourning for Sunny?
No.
So why black-black? l like black. l like colour...
Suits you.
Saira's flight arrived before yours.
She hasn't even switched on her phone yet. l am Saira
You run a shop?
Yes Dimple.
Hello Raina
Hello
Let's go.
How did you guess l was Dimple?
You're very special, people know you instantly.
Okay so how will we get our money from Sunny?
From lqbal
Dev, lqbal, Sunny whatever from that Bloody Scoundrel... ldea. His name will be Bloody Scoundrel to avoid any confusion.
To extract money from the Bloody Scoundrel we will con that con.
Con what con?
Con means to cheat.
He cheated us, now we will cheat him.
We will plant a bait in front of him.
Our bait will pretend that she has a great investment proposal to multiply money.
Bloody Scoundrel will invest his money in that, and through our bait we will get our money back.
Simple.
Simple? Who will be 'The Bait'?
There is one. l have someone in mind.
Through the thorns, pluck the roses snip the dreams, from the tree of snoozes.

To do this l'll have to take time off. l get paid 30 thousand a month.
Five lakhs... your fee, and all expenses paid.
What if he is a psycho-rapist?
He is not a rapist... actually he is very nice.
He is only interested in money.
Cold calculated unemotional...
What pain his con causes is no concern to him. l am doing my job well... getting paid well, no one to check on me... con a con?

No speaking. Just listen.
Takes all sorts
Next.
Hello? Who is it? (in Gujarati)
Shailen Sharma Bilaspur
Has the consignment arrived?
Diego Vaz. Goa. l'll do it, she can't even dial.

So what? You didn't get through the first time either.
Next
Where are you hiding Scoundrel?
The fourth guy Dimple called is calling back.
Diego Vaz.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The Bloody Scoundrel is in Goa!
This is your planning?
Had we told Papa, he would've booked us into a five-star hotel.
Miss Dimple, l wish your papa had financed this entire operation.
We would've stayed in a five-star hotel, hired a Mercedes, thank you.
But l'm very sorry, this is all l could manage with my small savings. lshika's fee, food, transport, everyone's tickets, chips, cold drinks.
But it's not an obligation, right, once we get money from that
Bloody Scoundrel? - Volume!
When we get the money from Bloody Scoundrel, you will take your cut first and then give us ours, right? lf we get and when we get... and what if we don't?
Don't be negative. lt's going to be fine.
God willing.
Wow... what a great bed.
The two of us can fit in easily.
That room.
Why? Aren't we roomies?
Sweetie, first you stop snoring then you and l can be roomies.
Till then, Saira and l are here.
Okay, rules:
This is my friend
Sasha's house, not a hotel.
We have to leave it in a better condition than it is now.
The maid comes in the morning to clean, but no one says anything in front of her.
The rest of the work will be divided equally between us.
Why didn't you specify earlier that we'd have to be maids as well?
Change the SlM card.
Don't even know how to change a card.
That's why you're still a Manager and not General Manager.

Excuse me! since when have you become my friend?
Since the white shirt and blue jeans became your enemy.
Listen l don't have time for this...
So just tell me how much you paid for my bill
Blue and white paid, not me.
Bartender said you... l pointed to the blue and white's card, the bartender was so hassled he didn't notice whose card had l pointed to.
He presumed it was mine. Simple.
Very classy thief!
Classy! Thank you.
Thief?
He misbehaved with you, l punished him.
That's no theft
That is theft.
Feeling guilty? Then apologise to him.
But if you want to thank me for punishing
Him, then there's a better bar in Colva.
Now l get it. l've known guys to pay the bill and flirt, but dude without paying!
Excellent.
But l am not in Goa to party or see cheap tricks from hunks like you.
Try it on someone else.
Excuse me
- Ya?
Sorry but there's been some confusion, can you pay the guy whose card was used, l think they're over there... ls he is a ghost that he just vanished? lf she gives so much attitude, he will vanish. lt was a perfect plan lshika, you ruined it.
He was convinced that you are a damsel in distress.
Damsel in distress!
No one gives a second glance to damsels these days. l can't play a damsel.
We've hired you! You have to play according to our rules.
Miss director, l am the one who has to deal with him face to face.
You can't press a remote and have fun. l am not an actress, l have to play it my way.
What if he were to catch me acting, then?
The partnership idea has to be sold to him, l'll sell it. l've never let you go empty handed from the mall, have l?
Ok but now we have to think of a new move.
Don't worry the next move will be made by him.
With hearty compliments from Mr. Vikram Thapar.
Vikram who?
- Mr. Thapar, Goa's beach king.
Out of all the water sporting between Varca to Anjuna at least a dozen are owned by him. lncluding the one at our hotel.
You met him last night at the bar.
That's Vikram Thapar?
Yes ma'am. lnteresting name.
- lnteresting man. lf you want to thank him, then you can find him at the beach.
Have a nice day ma'am.
- Thank you.
This is finished.
How will we run the business if he does this?
Tell him.
Grease.
Mr. Beach King, credit card trick didn't work so you sent flowers?
They always work... here you are
So l was right.
Last night's drama was to attract me.
You are so attractive what could l do?
Thank you... for the flowers. ls it from your own money or stolen cash?
Did they smell nice?
So how does it matter then? l want to go for a ride.
Come, l will take you
- l will drive. lf you are not here to party then what're you doing here?
To prove that l can also set up a business.
Prove to whom?
- To my Father. l told him l wanted to set up a chain of restaurants in lndia, he thought it was stupid.
Do anything in the U.S. but not in lndia.
After numerous fights he has conceded that l first set up the project like land, licences, clearances, staff everything, and then he'll invest five million.
Five million dollars is...
- Twenty five crores
Right.
But do you know how much he's given me for my trip?
Five lakhs including transport, hotel food.
But l'll prove it. l won't leave here till my restaurant is set up, even if it means sleeping on the beaches. l can help you set up your restaurant.
Really?
But why?
Oh lone girl, millionaire dad, trap her, take her money. ls this the plan?
Right! This was my plan.
But you're so clever, you don't need any help.
Goa is waiting for you.
All the honest officers, land owners, cops, collector, ministers.
They will help you honestly.
You have a good evening
Hey... Mr. Beach King!
Want to have a beer? l don't want any favours.
Do you want an equal partnership of sharing,
But profit sharing will be 60-40
You said equal partnership?
My idea, so 60 mine. Agreed?
Okay agreed.
You will also have to invest in the partnership.
Oh.
Obviously.
Why do you think l am letting you be my partner? l'm not going to run away with your money, all the expenses will be transparent and for the yacht party.
Yacht party?
See whenever l go to meet somebody... they don't take me seriously. lf we organise a yacht party, good food, music, wine, invite all the important people in Goa, put photos in the press.
Just see, the phone won't stop ringing.
Entire Goa will help our restaurant.
That's how we promote in the states.
Had l the money, l would've had the party, and started the restaurant by now.
How much will we need for the party?
A crore perhaps.
As soon as dad sanctions his 25 crores, your money will be returned.
So partner or no partner?
Partner.
How much for this?
One can get shoes for 500 rupees here.
And that one?
Which brand?
Mango, Diesel ,
Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci,
What time is it?
Tripping on these Jalapenos
We have to leave now, come on, come on, come on... l'm not done eating...
- We have to leave, he is not going to
Wait for us all day.
What's the rush, is it an American thing?
What happened?
- You have got to be kidding me man...
What're you doing?
Watch out, watch out. What the hell?
No price tag?
We'll put it when we get there.
Ya Gaurav? On our way.
Hey Gaurav what's up?
- You are looking nice.
Come, come, come.
Ok... that's Saira
- Hello
This is Dimple.
- Hi - Hello
Ladies on a mission huh? Come...
Like a fool l rushed here, didn't even pack properly.
All the money is going to the hotel bill. l think l should shift from
Pallazzo to a cheaper one star hotel.
From the money l save, l can buy a dress at least.
You won't be able to handle a one star
So what to do? l don't have a dress for the party.
Let's go shopping!
How sweet...
This is what they are wearing in New York now, like now. lt's lovely.
- Prada!
Beautiful.
Ninety thousand only.
Only!
One dress is not good enough, l mean atleast... l need at least eight, matching foot wear, jewellery, accessories.
Take everything. lt's an investment for our future. l mean business future.
And its backless. lts good.
Now thats nice. lts nice.
Nice couple.
But the boy is short.
Why don't you get heels? l can't believe we have shopped so much.
Sixteen lakhs fifty thousand.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Mind blowing.
Thank you.
Ohh my God...
Okay okay enough hugging kissing...
Let's get to work.
Phase two!
Can you talk lshika?
Listen yachts are parked at the Madovi Jetty.
One of them is my friend Fardeen's Yacht.
He has explained everything to the captain.
He is all set.
He will ask you for the entire payment in advance.
Then you take over.
The yacht is Brown in colour and called
Freedom. Freedom it is!
So? lncluding food and beverages, and 6pm to midnight will be 20 lakhs in total.
Too much no?
That's 40,000 dollars. ln the US this party will cost at least a 100,000 dollars.
Actually it's a good deal.
Aye aye captain sail the boat.
Full advance payment in cash, then booking, then sailing.
Done.
How much is this? lnvitation card
Oh. Gorgeous.
Here you go.
Ninety rupees ls this the cheapest?
Only mango juice will be cheaper than this.
Forty bottles please.
How much?
20 and 50 l'll take all
A 200 bucks bottle is now worth 90,000.
Thank you
So far we've earned 45 lakhs.
After lshika's fee and all expenses, we are left with 35. lshika Patel you are a genius.
There are at least 8 investors. ln fact we might not need your dad's money anymore.
No. l don't need anymore partners. l am happy with one, whom l can trust completely.
No really, for any business trust is crucial.
Right, trust is crucial.
Oh my god! Vikram.
Once more, once more.
We never had any in our childhood so l go crazy when l see them now.
Papa got us 1 of each firework and, they would be finished in seconds. l would be angry with the fireworks when they finished so soon, wondering , why have they finished?
But why rationing on the fireworks?
Your father could've bought an entire factory right?
Had my father not rationed in the beginning of his business, then how would he have become the Motel King?
Let's go.
Let's go party
Haven't we just been to a party?
That wasn't a party, it was business. lsn't it late? ls someone waiting for you?
Alright Vikram Thapar let's party.
Let's party.
She isn't answering.
Booking was till 12.
Party must have finished long time ago.
Real romance has happened between the calf and the butcher.
Real romance.
Raina, if what she is saying is true, then?
Then my dear, we are screwed.
All night party!
While we've been rotting in that hell-hole, she is living it up in the 5 star.
Partying with Sunny all night. l had to go with him to build his confidence.
What other debaucheries did you do to build his confidence?
Raina, please tell her to shut up. l am not going to shut up.
You are in Goa for us.
We've hired you.
We are footing the bills.
Not for you to hang out with my ex-boyfriend like shameless bitch.
That's enough Dimple.
You are always taking her side.
Dimple, just shut up.
Do you have any idea how worried we've been all night?
Any idea? l am really sorry.
Champagne, beer, yacht, brain got a bit side tracked. l promise it won't happen again. l am on your side.
Now the focus is to defeat the Bloody Scoundrel.
Down with the Bloody Scoundrel.
We haven't even recovered half the amount yet.
We've a long way to go.
Don't ditch lshika. l won't.
Dimple, come on.
Hi, you haven't slept? l want to show you something mind blowing.
OK, let's go l know, even my mind is completely blown.
Wow!!
This land is perfect for the restaurant.
Very nice.
Actually it's perfect.
Let's make it here.
Let's talk to the owner.
Wait, wait, wait partner.
Before we go ahead l want to share a few secrets, after knowing them you might want to break the partnership.
What secret can that be? l'm not breaking the partnership.
You will also have to tell me your secrets. l don't have any secrets.
You can tell me yours.
- l am a conman. l am a thief.
For the last 15 years, l've conned 30 ladies.
You are the 31st.
Friendship, partnership...
...investment in your project has all been for this.
My plan was to run away after fleecing you, but l fell in love with you lshika. l am not lying. l have lied a lot. l've spent my entire life alone, even if l wanted to be friends with someone, l would scold myself and restrain, but since l met my heart won't listen to me.
Do you... love me?
Will you marry me lshika?
He proposed to you?
Liar. Look at her face.
He never proposed to me, why would he propose to her? lt's not a proposal, it's a con silly.
The biggest con of his life.
After marrying her he will have her, her father's, the land's, the restaurant's money in his pocket.
With an investment of 40 lakhs, he plans to hit the billion dollarjackpot.
That's why l was wondering why is he buying her all these dresses and shoes for?
He will marry for money.
Marry him.
No way. Are you crazy?
This is the best way to get the rest of our money.
How?
Her father won't marry her...
...off to a thief like Vikram
Thapar without any security right?
And for that security lshika's father will ask him to buy that land in her name.
Before the wedding.
So will she get married to Sunny?
No, the plot will be bought before the wedding.
We'll sell it immediately after its registration.
Take our money, and get on the first flight home.
Not bad Saira.
Can you clear one matter first, will she or wont she be married to Sunny?
No. lshika will only accept his proposal.
Make him speak to her father.
Right we have to find a papa for her.
Let me figure this out. l'll make tea. l'll leave.
No, let Raina finish her call.
Did he give you flowers?
What?
When he proposed. Ring?
No
Plain?
Kiss?
You guys must have definitely kissed. l am conning him, and he is conning me.
Where did the kiss come from?
Kiss is a bitch. lt creeps up anywhere.
Ok papa sorted. lshika tell him l do, l do, l do.
Before that, let's find out the value of the land. lt's a fair deal ma'am, don't worry.
Owner is settled in Dubai, l have the Power of Attorney. l'll do the formalities.
Final price 90 Lakhs.
No bargaining. Sorry.
Ninety Lakhs.
My gosh!
- Yes, yes.
Really?
Mind-blowing!
Papa call time!
Papa.
Hello Mr. Patel.
Vikram Thapar?
Yes sir, Vikram Thapar.
Let's come straight to the point...
What's the turnover of your water sports business?
Not even 50 Lakhs annually. lshika's shoes almost cost that much!
Sir, honestly l don't have your kind of money, but lshika's happiness is most important to me. l promise to always keep her happy.
My dear a promise has no value.
My dear a promise has no value... bills cannot be paid by promises.
Moreover, how do l know you are not marrying my daughter for her money?
Tell me.
Sir, l love lshika not her money. l can't just believe what you say.
Trust needs proof. lf you want to marry lshika, then buy a land of her choice registered in her name for her restaurant. l'll make the rest of the investment in the restaurant, but if you buy the land then l'll be rest assured that she has some security.
That's my condition.
What happened? Can't give the security? l'll give sir, off course l will.
For lshika l'll do anything...
The butcher becomes the calf. l am telling you, the scoundrel is in love.
He can't love anyone.
He is laying his trap slowly and steadily.
He is getting caught up in it. l am trapped. l've made a promise but l don't have 90 Lakhs. l have only 45 left after the yacht party.
So now?
Had l not met you, l could have conned someone for it easily.
But now l can't do it. l love you... but how will l give your father security? l don't know!
We will have to give the rest of the 45 Lakhs.
Crazy? We've got it with so much difficulty.
With our 45 and his 45, he will buy the plot.
Hopefully when we sell it we will get more than 90, and we'll recover all our money.
Okay lshika, tell him you raised 45 by selling yourjewellery.
Okay?
But Raina, what if he has genuinely fallen in love with me, then? what's going on here?
Love what else? l told you she's a traitor.
He is leading you on.
He can't love anyone.
He loves me... perhaps. lshika waved the magic wand and the scoundrel became a caring, honest lover.
Believe me he has changed. lf you look into his eyes, you will see an honest man.
Enough lshika.
Even l've seen his eyes, when he spoke to my father-in-law about his poor mother...
...and sister and stole our 10 Lakhs. lf you don't want to carry on, it's ok.
But don't mock us. We're stupid and you're clever.
When he vanishes after breaking your heart, that's when you will realise her pain and know that we are your well-wishers, not that rogue.
Raina... the money for Vikram.
Are we crazy to hand over so much money to a thief's girlfriend?
You will run away with it.
Aren't you in love with him? l am. l am in love with him.
But l'm an honest sales girl, not a thief.
Less salary, tough life, but l feel proud when my bosses praise me for my honesty. l wouldn't sell that feeling even for a crore. l won't cheat you.
Trust me. l'll return all your money.
Promise me, no more lies. l love you. l love you.
Owner?
Mr. Abhay Salaskar.
He is settled in Dubai.
Power of Attorney is with me D'Silva.
Buyer? lshika Patel.
Sign please.
Ma'am sign here please.
Hundred percent genuine! lshika
Sorry, and Thank you. lt's okay.
Sorry. Thank you. l can't wait to see his face when he sees us and realises that he has been duped.
But where is the scoundrel?
This is fine. - Hello, hello excuse me, what are you doing here?
Flood control.
Where's the flood? lt's not here now, but it will come after the monsoons.
Who gave you permission?
We are the new owners of this land.
Take our permission.
You? lsn't the owner Abhay Salaskar?
Was. He is in Dubai now. We bought it.
For 90 lakhs.
90! Lakhs!
- Cheap deal isn't it?
What would be its market value now?
3 Lakhs with great difficulty.
This is a swamp. lt's under water for 5 months. What value?
Check the deed, may be there is an extra zero by mistake.
Even 9 Lakhs is too much.
David, Abhay
Salaskar has cheated them.
Ninety Lakhs.
What's your cut?
What?
How much will that scoundrel give you out of the 90? ls it a 50-50 or a 60-40 partnership?
Was it his idea because an idea is worth more, or was it yours?
Shut up Raina.
- You double crossing bitch.
Shut up Raina.
- Liar, thief, bloody scoundrel.
Raina, shut up! lshika...
- Shut up all of you... l did it for you and you are accusing me?
Calling me a thief?
To hell with you.
Raina!
Had lshika cheated us, then why would she come here?
Don't abuse her for your defeat.
The scoundrel has cheated her as well.
First, he bought the land himself, for 3 Lakhs as Abhay Salaskar from Dubai.
Then he gave the Power of Attorney to D'Silva. lshika met D'Silva who quoted 90 lakhs.
Out of which we gave 45 Lakhs.
After signing the deed
D'Silva gave the entire money to Bloody Scoundrel.
Aren't l too good? l had boarded the plane after the security check, but could not take off.
For the first time, it was no fun. l conned girls because l thought it was a game, which l would win. l never stopped to think, that along with cash, what else the girls lost.
Now that l know, the game is no fun. l thought l was superstar Shahrukh Khan, but this time, even though l won, l have lost.
Your money. lts 1 crore
You have straightened this Bloody Scoundrel out. l can't do con jobs anymore, and l know nothing else.
Thanks to you all, l will have to learn honest work. l am not good at saying sorry, so
Hats off boss!
Hats off lf you ever meet lshika, tell her my proposal was real. l really fell in love with her.
But she turned out to be a real player, hats off to her as well.
Abhay Salaskar!
How does he come up with these names?
Sunny and l were dating seriously... and l wondered why isn't he going first base?
First what?
Kissing!
So l thought, l'd take him there. l came on to him in the night club, but he didn't kiss me.
He could have taken advantage, l was ready, but he didn't exploit me.
But he doesn't know how much lshika loves him right?
No, only we know.
No, no, don't do that.
Give this pamphlet to your mother.

HomeTown is offering 25% discount on all sections please do check it out
HomeTown is offering 25% discount on all sections please do check it out lshika Patel...
Sorry sir, l think you are looking for another lshika, l am lshika Desai, a small time sales girl, my salary is 25,000 rupees. l am sure l am no good to you.
By the way we have a 25% discount in all the sections please do check it out,
Won't you ask me why l came back?
Not really, l am 22 years old, l have a lot to achieve, a lot to earn. l went off track once and lost out but now l won't make a mistake, l want to mint money.
Not a good plan! l've been there done that. lt's no fun making money on your own.
Let's be partners, same deal 60 yours, 40 mine.
No lies, no cheating.
Your brains, my courage, world's best partnership.
You've conned 31 girls right? l don't want to be 32nd. l will constantly be seeking the truth in your lies. l was telling the truth then, l am telling the truth now.
You were lying then, you are lying now.
You might feign anger but your eyes are saying, clearly, that you are happy to see me here.
That's why we are made for each other, we won't be able to lie to each other, because we will be caught out.
A 100 % true partnership of two liars. lf you are so in love with my lies, then why did you leave me and go? lt was my last con, how could l have lost? lshika Desai, l love you...
Marry me
Straight to marriage, don't you want to test me as a girlfriend or something? l am the No.1 conman, l have checked everything before attacking. wait wait, first tell me your real name.
Bahl,
Ricky Bahl
Ricky!
What kind of name is that? l don't want to marry a Ricky... l want to...
Dimple, don't worry... we'll look for a much better groom for you than Ricky. l don't want him anymore, l just want to go home... to mummy papa.
Top of the morning to you, little dude!
Hey, eat shit and die of eating shit.
Whoa, that's no way to treat your friends.
You're not my friends.
We're the only ones that know what you're going through, little dude, and where you're going to.
You can't escape your destiny, loser.
It's either us or no one.
I've got real friends!
Ones that will stick by me no matter what!
Not for long.
Is that a threat?
Whoa, whoa, far be it for us to threaten the destroyer of worlds.
But a shitstorm is brewing, bro.
And you're the asshole at the center of it.
And your friends?
They're just gonna be swept aside.
And casually fucked into nothingness.
He's saying they're all gonna die if they keep hanging with you, loser.
Yeah, I got that, asshole.
Rob: Whoa, not the finger!
You're too hard-core for us!
What are we gonna do about Todd's problem?
You know he shaved his nutsack and now it's super itchy and in-grown?
Guys do that?
Well, not me.
I rock the dick beard.
It makes my porksword look like a wise old wizard.
Curtis: And I mean old.
That sounds far worse-
I'm talking about
Todd's bigger problem.
We need to find out what happens if he really is the pure evil one.
It means he's gonna destroy the world.
Or something.
I for one think we need to keep him from doing that.
Jenny: Uh, yeah! He could be more dangerous than the book of pure evil.
Curtis: Whoa, you guys- you're talking about my best friend here.
Maybe all he needs is for us to tell him we love him.
Jenny: Can't we tell him we like him?
It's sorta the same thing.
Love's more powerful.
Love conquers all.
That's so sweet.
Can we get back on track here?
My dad was researching the book when those satanists kidnapped him.
He must know something about that prophecy they were talking about.
Too bad he's in a coma- but he could snap out of that any day now.
Like right now.
Thanks, Curtis.
Look!
Dad, what are you doing here?
"Dear Jenny, your father is a vegatable.
"Which is why I'm leaving him.
"With you. Forever.
"Love, mom."
Curtis: Yeah but there's something on the back.
"P.S. Forever means
I'm not coming back."
Harsh.
Hi! I'm Leslie!
You wanna trade sandwiches?!
Why would I want to trade sandwiches?
Maybe you eat my sandwich and I eat your sandwich and we become friends?
"Expello... meus...
Solitudo... eternus!"
<b>Subsfreak</b>
Okay, listen up, you old geezers.
I've got an important announcement to make.
I too have an important announcement to make.
Are you telling me your announcement is more important than mine?
Most assuredly.
Get on with it. Make it snappy.
My fellow brethren- our ancient society recently suffered a terrible and painful loss when our beloved Minion Bob died at the hands of the book.
You're not being snappy!
Fine!
Now that he's gone, we need to replace him!
So please welcome our new fourth Minion-
Fred.
Minion Bob's ceremonial robe.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to wash the blood and feces off it.
Atticus: Yeah, welcome to the family,
Minion Fred.
I'm sure you'll be just as mediocre a Minion as the rest of them.
Now onto the real important announcement.
I'm the pure evil one.
At least I will be, once you deliver me the book of pure evil.
Questions? Comments? Praise?
Yeah, let's start with Minion George.
If this is a joke,
I don't get it.
No. Not a joke.
Okay, you're trying to set up a bigger joke.
Yeah, like a prank!
Look, I just told you guys
I'm the pure evil one.
That's...Big news!
I thought somebody...
Would be excited by that?
Did you just say you want us to get you the book of pure evil?
Because we haven't been outside of this home in almost twenty years.
(Laughing) You're all so useless!
That includes you, Minion Fred.
Atticus: I'll find the book myself!
What a dipshit!
You'll fit in just fine, Minion Fred!
So our goals should be:
Get the book before
Atticus does.
And destroy the book before Todd becomes-
(whispering) The pure evil one.
Thanks for the reminder, Hannah.
I think he heard you.
Sorry, Todd, but it's something we have to deal with before you hurt anyone else.
Ow!
Your arm's made of metal, idiot!
You shorted out my arm!
Okay, careful where you- whack!
Curtis!
Aim that.
Sorry, I didn't mean to fist your dad.
That metal arm is dangerous!
It could kill somebody!
I'm the one that's dangerous.
I mean, I almost killed my best friend.
After I tried to kill you, dude.
Let's call it even.
No you were under the book's power.
I wasn't.
Look, even if we get the book before Atticus, there's no way to destroy it.
And if I really become the pure evil one-
I don't want you guys around when that happens.
Maybe if we find out more about the prophecy we can stop that from happening.
It's time for me to be my own dude.
I need to do this alone.
Todd!
Todd, wait!
We love you!
Did Todd just break up with us?
Nice robe, sweater dude!
Oh, I keep forgetting to take this off- it looks great. Really.
Totally flattering.
Really?
Loser.
I'm getting mixed messages from you guys.
He's not easily impressed.
Oh, you'll be impressed soon enough.
You all will when I lay my hands on the book of pure evil and complete my ascendence to become the pure evil one.
Brody: Just remember- only the pure evil one can control the power of the book.
Yes, me. And only me.
Who is who I am.
Yeah, you might want to lose the robe before you go into the school.
Fuck! Keep forgetting to take this thing off!
Hi. I'm Leslie!
What's your name?
Uh, my name is "get out of my face, fannypack."
Would you like to be my friend?
Yeah! I'm like so glad we're friends now!
You and I are gonna be very close.
Would you like to be my friend?
What?
Hello, Todd.
Oh great- so glad I bumped into you.
I've got a big surprise for you.
But I can't tell you what it is, because I want it to stay a surprise, so you'll be surprised when you hear it.
What?
I'm gonna destroy your little gang!
There is no gang anymore.
It's just me and you.
And I'm gonna find the book before you do.
Then I'm gonna kick your ass.
Believe me, my ass can take a lot of pounding.
I didn't say pound. I said kick.
Same thing.
No, it- it really isn't.
Yeah- it is.
Fine. Have it your way.
I'm still gonna find the book before you do.
Oh, I'll find the book before you, Todd Smith!
And I'll be waiting with anticipation!
For that ass-pounding.
Atticus: Who has the book this time?
Is it the makeup face children?
Is it the pornographic fantasy ladies?
Is it the preppy bags of douche?
You were so right, Leslie!
Trading sandwiches makes them taste better!
I like it when there's too much sandwich!
Double-meat sandwiches, wow!
I make fancy sandwiches for my dog!
Would you people keep it down?!
Curtis: I'm really worried about Todd.
What if he is the pure evil one?
What if he can't control himself?
I saw him lose control and almost kill you.
You know, Hannah, you look really sexy when you're scared.
I'm not scared, I'm just- what? You think I'm sexy?
Totally.
I've never been called sexy before.
I don't know how to react.
So many new emotions.
Say it again?
You're sexy.
I could get used to that word.
Sexy- how about super-sexy?
Oh...That's even better.
How 'bout... ultra humpable?
Let's stick with super-sexy.
Hey guys!
Do you wanna be my friends?
Friends to the end!
Todd: First, I had the book-
then Hannah had the book- then there was tiny Todd- and then- oh, right! Sexy twins.
Were the sexy twins before or after tiny Todd?
Male: Who wants to eat a hoagie?!
Female: I do, I do!
Male: Love meat fries!
Female: Me too!
Hey, will you people keep it down!
Female: I love meatballs!
Meatballs are the best!
Me again, Hannah.
Where are you guys?
Call me!
Something's not right.
Ew!
Knock it off, assholes!
Mr. gunderson: Okey dokey, yesterday we left off discussing palm reading and I thought, uh- what the hell is that?
This is my dad, Mr. gunderson.
Yeeeah... I don't wanna know.
I just want you to take the old man in the wheelchair out of this classroom.
I have nowhere else to put him.
Not my problem!
He's creeping...Me out.
Anyone else feel the same?
I'm sorry, Jenny.
Democracy has spoken.
Stupid democracy- that's not even a fucking subject!
Sandwich is a very smart the person!
Curtis: What if we put a sandwich inside a sandwich?
I've been looking everywhere for you guys!
Wanna be friends?
Oh my...Fuck- ahhhhhhhh!
You look a little frazzled, dude.
What's up?
Oh- hey, Jimmy.
I'm just looking for the book.
Isn't that what that gang is for?
I sort of...
Broke up with the gang.
How come?
Well, they're afraid of me, and maybe they should be.
They don't wanna hang out with you anymore, I get it- no, no, they wanna hang out with me.
They do- alright, then what's the problem?
I'm afraid that if they keep hanging out with me they're gonna like- die.
So I'm thinking it might be better for me to just kinda go off on my own.
You know, like a lone wolf.
Alright, lone wolf sounds cool.
Yeah, but it's actually kinda lonely.
Well, you'll get used to it, though.
And jerking off a lot, right?
Alright lone wolf, I'm gonna let you be- hey, uh, if you're not doing anything maybe you and I could...
Hang out.
Aren't we friends?
Yeah.
Oh- yeah, the- (Clears throat)
I guess the best thing for you Jimmy is to- stay away from me.
Alright, suit yourself.
Hey you guys, you know what we should all do tonight?
Have a sleepover!
That sounds like so much fun!
We should do it at
Leslie's house!
Everybody bring their pajamas!
Or, not- it's been really great having all these new friends and all but I think I might need a little time to myself.
Why would you want that, Leslie?
We're all here for you!
No really, I just need some space-
why would you go anywhere without your friends, Leslie?
Yeah, we're here for you, Leslie!
We're always here for you!
Friends to the end!
Curtis: I'm hungry!
Can we get some corn chips?!
How about we order a pizza?!
With pineapples on it!
And ham!
That sounds good!
You should patent that!
It's called a hawaian pizza!
Jenny: I like sausage!
You can't put sausage on a hawaian pizza!
You people are driving me crazy!
Holy Jupiter shit!
Mr. Murphy! I need your help!
Let me guess, you have the book.
Here! Take it!
Well, that was easy.
Come on, Atticus, be friends with us and Leslie!
Now that I have the book you wanna be friends?
That ship has sailed, bitchface!
I mean friend-face! Hahahahaha!
Todd: Hello?
Is anyone there?
Curtis: Hey Todd!
Come and join the student body!
Look, a new friend!
Hannah: We always need more boys!
Jenny: And I like sausage!
Hannah: I like pineapple!
Holy...Shit.
I'm surprised that this doesn't surprise me.
Atticus: Look, it's my favorite
Nemesis, Todd Smith!
And you've got the book.
I'll show you the power of pure evil after our pizza sleepover!
We're still doing that, right?
Leslie: Help me!
All I wanted was some friends!
But they're smothering me!
You don't mean that , do you Leslie?
That's what I love about Leslie!
She's such a kidder!
Curtis: Leslie, you really have a great sense of humor!
Leslie: Ahhhhhh!
And a great scream.
So true!
You know, you guys are really making a great case for membership.
All: Join the student body, Todd.
It's so nice in here.
We're getting along so wonderfully.
No one has to be alone.
If being alone is what it takes to keep my friends safe, then
I have to be alone.
All: Resistance is futile.
You will be friended.
Really?
All of you guys are friends?
All: Friends to the end.
How can all of you guys be friends?
I mean- do you guys even know anything about each other?
How well can anybody know anybody?
Yeah, your friends say that they're there for you.
And that they understand what you're going through, but- they don't really know.
At the end of the day...
We're all alone.
Or in Elliot's case, alone under the bleachers
jerking off to Wanda doing her cheerleading routine.
What?! Gross!
You know what's gross?
The smell after Curtis leaves the washroom!
That's true.
Hey, that's my boyfriend you're talking about!
You actually got somebody to go out with you?!
Hannah: Shut up! That's so rude!
At least they don't call her margarine.
All: Huh?
Because she spreads easy.
You suck! You all suck!
You know who's the worst?
Leslie!
All: Yeah!
She acts like she's friends with everyone, we don't even know who she is!
Yeah-
Leslie: Oooooow!
Aw-
No, no! Please, no!
I hate teenagers!
You're tearing me apart!
Literally!
Ahhhhhhh!
Holy Jupiter shit- what just happened?
Let go of the book, Atticus!
It will destroy you!
No, you will be the one who is destroyed.
By me!
You can't control its power!
That's what you think but you're wrong!
I feel the book's power pulsating through me- me too- pulsing! It's not just you-
I think I can-
I think I can control it- yes...
(Evil Todd) Yes, I know I can-
No, it is me!
I am the one who controls it!
They're getting all pure evil-ey-
Todd's a bit more convincing.
Jenny: Todd, listen to me!
You don't need that book.
What else do I have going for me?
None of you trust me.
And why should you?
I'm always getting you into danger, risking your lives- the book of pure evil...
Is my only true friend.
No, the book is my friend!
That's not true Todd.
You have us.
You don't have to do this.
Hannah: We'll save you, Todd!
Curtis: All of us, together!
I can't stop destiny.
Thud!
Todd, no!
Ugh!
You haven't heard the last of me!
I still work here!
Every day, eight am!
I'm here to make your lives hell!
Uhhh!
Are you okay, dude?
I was gonna use the book again.
I couldn't stop myself.
Jenny: That's why you have us.
To save you from yourself.
I guess-
I can't really fight the book without you guys, huh?
Nope.
And you don't have to.
Hey, it's like we're the student body.
But in a good way.
Now that we're back together, what do you guys want to do?
Throw rocks over the overpass?
Todd: Yeah!
Uh...Shouldn't we be looking for the book?
What was up with Atticus?
He's just doing what he always does- trying to get the book and stuff.
Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?
(Pat groaning)
Jennifer!
Dad?!
Ugh- he thinks he's the pure evil one!
Either he's insane or else he's an even bigger idiot than we ever imagined.
Could be 50/50, Dave.
We cannot allow this farce to continue even if he is our hooded leader!
Drastic measures must be taken.
Sodomy!
Let's not be too hasty.
He's still the only one who can deliver us the book.
My knees can't keep up with all this running around.
If he delivers it.
He has before.
I'm certain he will again.
And then what do we do with him?
Sodomy!
Fred, give it a rest.
Once Atticus brings us the book he will be of no further use to us.
Which means...
Death to all false prophets.
And then sodomy?
I'm not gonna hold back.
I warned the others that I wouldn't.
Recording it like this is so important to us.
I guess it's our way of telling ourselves that we matter.
That we mean something.
Maybe...
some of the things we've done...
and the friends that we've lost...
hopefully it all makes a difference somehow.
There's only one way to do this.
And that's to go back to where it all began.
What, with Kevin? When?
Last night. He came over to help with the shearing.
Some sheep got out and dad went after them.
We were all by ourselves for, like, 20 minutes.
You did it in a shearing shed?
- In the bed of soft pure merino wool.
My God, you're such a nimpho.
You can talk, Ellie. What about you and Steve at rehearsals last year.
Oh please, we never went that far.
- Now... pinky swear not to tell.
Pinky swear? Is that not something we stopped doing in second grade?
Corrie's been my best mate for as long as I can remember.
Whenever I had a problem,
I'd go tell Corrie
and somehow, she'd always fix it.
So, how was it?
- Well, not how I expected.
I feel different somehow.
Like a real woman.
I wanna do more, see more.
I wanna be more.
What would you wanna do?
How about a trip before we get back to school?
We haven't been at the river in ages. -Sure.
Maybe dad will let us have a Landrover.
Maybe Kevin can come with us?
I see. You'd like to have more sex, is that it? -No... Well, yeah.
Look, we'll get a bunch of us together and... if your dad lets us have a Landrover, we should go further up the river than we've ever been before.
Even up to Taylor's Stitch.
And all the way into Hell.
Hell is on the other side of
Taylor's Stitch. Nobody goes there.
Yes. Why don't you go up the river again? You always loved that.
Because we wanna go somewhere we haven't gone before.
Make it a real adventure.
- Why Landrover? Why not the bikes?
Or horses even. Like in an old fashioned camp out. That'd be fun.
Guys, I'm not ten anymore.
Besides, if there was an emergency, wouldn't you prefer that I had Landrover?
I don't know, Ellie.
It's a pretty big ask.
Like it or not, dad,
I'm turning 18 this year.
Don't you think it's time
I started showing initiative and... independence and all those other good things?
C'mon. It's just a couple of days.
What's the worst that could possibly happen?
But the show is on this weekend.
- So what?
Do you really care if your mom wins best decorated cake?
Flip!
I always pictured Kevin in 20 years being president of the Show Society,
and bringing up his 3 kids.
- Alright.
With Corrie, if she got her way.
- Anything for you.
And she usually did.
Please, tell him he can go to the bloody show if he wants to.
There's plenty of guys who'd kill to come with us.
Come on, who else can we ask?
- Somebody fun.
Homer.
I'll see you next weekend, sunshine.
Homer grew up on the farm next to mine.
He was kind of like a brother to me.
He was always getting into trouble.
Both in school and out.
The new police sergeant arrested him 3 times in one week.
Hey, sarge, how're you going?
Good?
That didn't slow down Homer.
- Alright. -Yeah?
How's the wife, is she good?
I think it was the proud rebellious greek side of him.
He just didn't care what he did.
Or what anyone thought of him.
How about it?
Are you in or are you out?
Yeah, I'll have a go at that.
Just you girls going?
- Yeah, and Kevin. -It'll be good for you to have a man around.
To do all the hard work for you.
Well, that's four. Anyone else?
What about Fiona Maxwell?
Fifi, out in the bush? Seriously?
Oh gosh! You really want me?
Fi was the only person I knew under 60 who said 'gosh'.
Well, no. But our parents said we had to bring someone along with a little bit of class.
To balance out all us inbred rurals.
She lived in town, but we liked her anyway.
Okay. Give me a sec and I'll ask mom.
Mommy, can I please go camping with the girls this weekend?
Camping, out in the bush? Seriously?
I'll admit it, Lee was an odd choice.
He was always working in his mom and dad's restaurant, or of course...
... playing piano.
Everyone else thought he was strange.
I just thought he was interesting.
May I take your order?
- No, sorry, I don't wanna order anything.
Is this for pick-up or for take-away?
No, I would like to speak to your son Lee. Is he available?
You have menu? -No. Yes I do, but I don't wanna order anything.
What you want?
- I want Lee.
Your son Lee.
I want Lee.
I want Lee.
- This is Lee.
Good evening.
This is Ellie Linton.
I sat next to you in geography last year. It was on tuesdays.
I have... sort of longish dark hair.
- Yeah, I know who you are, Ellie.
Good. Well, some friends of mine and I are...
We're skipping the show this weekend and we're going camping instead.
I was... We were wondering if... maybe... if you wanted to...
... come with us? Or not?
No, that would be awesome.
- Really?
Oh, good. I'll put you down then.
It was actually... -My mom makes me go help out now.
Can you text me the details?
Yes, I can...
Yes. I'll do that.
Alright. See you.
- B... bye.
Lee made it six. But dad said we had to have eight.
Eventually we compromised on 7, as long as Robyn was the 7th.
Sorry, Robyn.
If it was just you girls...
... but with boys?
Not without an adult present.
Of course, if parents ever had a daughter they could trust, it was Robyn.
Well, the boys will be in separate tents, dad.
And besides, this camping trip isn't about...
... romance or anything. It's more about getting back to nature.
You know, we're all kind of... cooped up in this modern environment, and I think this camping trip will help me to help my friends become closer to God.
Because we need to share a spiritual connection.
If parents were present, I don't think that I'd be able to reach these girls.
And these boys as much as I would like to.
Are you alright, Fi?
You're looking a bit pale.
You look like you're gonna...
It's stuck in the back of your throat, isn't it?
You're trying to swallow it all down.
But it just keeps coming back up.
Okay, I got it.
How much stuff do you need?
- Oh my God Ellie, look at this!
Wait, what is this? Makeup?
You never know who you're going to meet.
Hey, you can see
Cobbler's Bay from here.
You can even see the Heron Bridge.
How far do you reckon we've come?
- That was the easy part.
From here on, we walk.
Ready? On the count of three. One...
Give me a decent throw, sweetheart.
Let's go.
I meant to do that.
Homer, do you even know where we're going?
There's a clearing up ahead.
This is very pretty for Hell.
I wonder how long it's been since anyone's been down here.
I wonder if anyone has ever been down here, I mean... why would anyone else've bothered?
- Maybe we're the first ones to see it.
There's no reception. -What were you expecting, broadband?
Couldn't hurt.
You, what's your name.
Go get some firewood, will you?
It's Lee.
Ellie, what are we having for dinner?
Two-minute noodles.
- Oh, great!
What are they?
You've never heard of two-minute noodles?
No, my mom is really into health foods.
It's an awesome feeling to realise you're about to change someone's life forever.
You haven't got 2000 dollars.
Wait a sec, not one guy asked you out last year?
No. Why would they?
Why? You're beautiful, Fi.
My mom is beautiful.
I'm just...
You remember, I had braces for like two years.
I still wear glasses and it's not...
She was Miss Wirrawee three years in a row.
I actually asked her if I should enter this year, but she didn't think that was a good idea.
Anyway, I'm doing really well at school at the moment, so...
... doesn't matter.
And, you know, a guy will ask me out one day.
I just don't know when. Or who.
Which is exciting.
Boys are idiots.
- Fun idiots.
You shall not pass.
What's that smell?
- Jet fuel.
- What?
Just a bunch of army planes going somewhere.
El, what do you think of Fi?
I love Fi, you know that.
She seems so perfect.
I guess she thinks
I'm a total loser, huh?
I don't think she hates you.
- Yeah, but... you know.
She lives in that big house.
Talks like Mrs Hamilton.
Me and my family... we are just greek peasants to people like her.
Why don't you ask her out?
I don't know.
Girl as pretty as that must get asked out all the time.
Did anyone else hear those planes last night?
Yeah. There was six lots of them.
They were flying really low.
No, there were dozens and dozens.
We were counting them, Lee and me.
Lee and I. -But seriously, what do you think those planes were doing?
Maybe they weren't even ours.
It's probably the start of World
War Three and we don't even know.
Alright, who's having rabbit?
Is there any chocolate left?
- Sadly, we're all out.
Oh look, I found some.
- Don't be a dickhead. Give it back!
Thank you. Kevin?
- I was gonna give you some.
So beautiful out here.
I wonder why they call it Hell.
I guess cause it's so wild and untamed and stuff. Right?
Right.
Wild is difficult.
And it's wonderful and fascinating.
But it's not Hell. People call it that.
People stick labels on things.
Until nobody can see them for who or what they really are anymore.
Hey, what's going on? -There's a bloody snake in my sleeping bag.
Are you sure, mate?
I can't see anything.
What kind of snake was it?
- I didn't look.
Lot of redbellies out here.
- Are they deadly?
No. Well... if they bite you.
Shake it.
The bag, Beyonce.
Don't lift it too high.
I got it, I got it!
I was just about to do that myself.
Christ, that's a big one!
Are you alright?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm not sleeping in that bag again. Jesus Christ!
- No need to swear.
- Kevin, no need to bloody swear.
Is it dead?
- Looks dead. Wait...
Nobody's laughing, Homer.
Hey, Fi. Why did you go into the river?
To get away from the snake, of course.
You do know that snakes can swim, right? -No, they can't.
- Yeah they can.
- Snakes can't swim.
They don't have fins. They slither.
- They slither through water.
- No, they don't.
- What about sea snakes?
Oh my God!
I could've died!
Oh, Fifi!
Can I go home now?
Do we have to go back?
Well, I'm excited about a hot shower. And a pillow.
A pillow would be nice.
Let's do this again.
Back here in the same place.
- With the same people.
- If we can find it again.
- We'll find it again.
Let's keep it quiet or everyone will start coming here and the place will be wrecked in no time.
Ladies and gentlemen... and Homer.
To Hell!
- To Hell.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Ellie, what's with your dog?
- Millie!
Mom! Mom?
Dad! Hallo!
Where are you parents?
- I don't know.
- Maybe they left a note.
- Did they say they were going away?
- What's the story, El?
- I've no idea. They should be here.
- Let's ring my parents.
- No, ring Homer's. They're closer.
There's no dial tone.
- What?
What about TV?
Maybe your grandmother got sick so they left... -And cut the phone lines?
- Some big electrical problem?
- No, they wouldn't leave Millie to...
Oh, stinks! -Power must be out.
I'll check the generator.
Where's your laptop?
- Shit!
- Ellie, let's go to Homer's.
- Ellie...
- What?
- Maybe not a good idea.
- Stop the car. Let me out!
Mama! Papa!
Wait, where's Lee going? Lee?
What are you doing?
We shouldn't leave it in the open.
- Remember the planes?
We weren't in the open.
Are you serious?
Homer?
I already tried that.
Real quiet out there.
- Did you send out a call?
Wouldn't be safe.
No! I know what you're thinking and it's not possible.
Absolutely, completely impossible.
That kind of stuff just doesn't happen here. Not in this country.
We gotta be careful.
It could be a lot at stake here.
She's right. We've got to assume something bad has happened.
Of course something bad has happened. My dog is dead.
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Shut up! Everyone shut up!
Jesus Christ, what is going on?
Kevin's place was next.
I don't remember who suggested it, but we decided to stay off the main roads.
Mom! Dad! Mitchell!
Flip?
Flip!
Looks alright. -He always has a bucket of food and some water. Don't you, boy?
You can't bring that.
You think I'm just gonna leave him here? I'm not leaving him!
Stop it!
I'm not leaving him!
He's got a point.
Let's take Flip to Corrie's and then we can make another decision depending on what we find there. Agreed?
Flip, let's go.
C'mon.
That's four out of four.
The rest of you live in town.
Robyn's house is on Coachman's
Lane. That's probably the closest.
Yeah, you can see most of Wirrawee from the hill at the back.
It might tell us something.
- Then we go to Robyn's next.
Flip, sit. Stay.
Please don't touch that.
- Let's go up that hill.
Something's going on at the Showground.
I think that's where everyone is.
- What about those other lights?
Hospital. Must be using the emergency generators.
Maybe we should split up.
Split up? No, we can't.
We have to stay together.
We need to be out of town before dawn. Just in case.
I'll take Fi to her house.
Lee, you take Robyn to yours.
We'll meet back here at 5 a.m.
So we just stay here?
You get to go to the Show.
Whose voices are those?
- I don't know.
I think we should go back.
- No. Wait.
We have to get a better look before we leave.
Better look at what, Ellie?
Let's go!
One of us has to get closer before we go. We gotta see what's going on.
I'm not leaving Corrie here.
- I'll go.
- Ellie!
If anything happens, run.
Do not try to escape or you will be shot.
Dad!
This is bloody ridiculous. I've been waiting in this stupid line for 2 hours!
Who do you people think you are?
Hands off me.
Are you okay?
Where's Kevin?
Quick! They're coming!
Ellie... -What?
- Can we stop?
Corrie, c'mon! Please! Please.
Come on.
Where are they now?
- I don't know. -Guys!
Kevin! Oh my God!
What happened to you?
I thought that you're ahead of me, so I just... I just ran.
Ellie said that if anything was to happen to run.
- Oh my God!
- Go!
C'mon, c'mon...
Let's go.
- I hurt my knee.
- C'mon, we gotta keep moving.
Are you alright?
- No. I cut it. Jesus!
Give me your shirt. Quick.
Singlet, it's better. Quick.
Get me a stick or something.
Stay here.
Ellie, hurry up!
Quick, get back!
- Will this do?
- Yeah, quick.
Ellie, they are coming.
- Alright.
Light it.
Light it.
Corrie, we gotta get out of here.
Get up, c'mon. Ellie, let's go!
Hang up.
She wasn't much older than I was.
And she looked just as scared.
I'll never forget her.
Ellie, we don't have time.
- Come on!
Thank God!
We heard an explosion.
- Yeah, that was us.
- Are you alright? -Yeah.
Flip! There he is. Good boy!
Where did all those soldiers come from?
Where did you get this thing?
Wait, where's Robyn and Lee?
They haven't come back yet.
- It's almost 6 a.m.
We were just about to give up on all of you.
We have to go and find them then, don't we? -Ellie...
Homer, we have to go find them.
- It's daylight now.
- I'm not leaving them.
- We're not leaving them.
We'll come back tonight when it's safer.
Yeah cause there'll be soldiers crawling all over town by now.
I mean... after what you did.
We will find them.
Ellie, I promise.
El... El... come on.
- Wait, just...
- No, don't touch me.
Sit down over there.
- Are you alright?
I'll get us some food.
- Thank you.
So, any idea whose army it is?
- We didn't exactly stop to ask.
We'll ask Robyn. She's good with flags and things like that.
All I can say is they are not greek.
- It doesn't matter who they are, because they're here.
We just got to deal with it.
Alright, mate. Calm down.
No, seriously, what difference does a flag make?
Fi made this for you.
Her house is empty too?
- Yeah.
There are soldiers everywhere.
We crawled all the way back to Robyn's.
Not bad for a first date.
The others told me what happened.
El.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's theirs.
It's all theirs.
You're changing.
- Yeah?
- For better or worse?
- Better. Definitely better.
Looks good.
Fi'd always say she'd be a doctor.
You're gonna have to forgive him sooner or later, you know.
He just left us, Ellie.
He just ran and left us.
I thought he loved me.
Do you remember how many hours we used to spend up here?
You mean the tea parties?
We were so innocent back then. And now I...
I feel like we were innocent right up until yesterday.
We didn't believe in Santa Claus or anything like that.
You know, we believed in other fantasies.
We believed we were safe.
I guess that was the biggest fantasy of them all, right?
Do you ever think we'll see
Robyn and Lee again?
That's one of ours!
How many planes do we have?
One less now.
How's this?
I'm going to Wirrawee with Ellie and we look for Robyn and Lee.
You three go back to my place and load up the Landrover.
Seems a hell of a risk going back into Wirrawee.
What if it was you they're going back for?
Don't ask me to go with you.
- He's not.
Good, because
I'm not bloody going.
Jesus, Kevin. Everything is a risk from now on.
We can't sit around here forever.
The biggest risk is to take no risk.
Alright. But if we can't stay here where do you want us all to go?
Hell.
We're not taking your teddies.
- Not all of them, just one.
We can't take things like that.
- Why can't we?
This isn't a picnic, El. We have to start acting like soldiers.
One mistake and... it's all over.
Can we take my mom's crowns and sashes?
- Yeah, and photos. Don't forget photos.
Geez, we're gonna need a trailer pretty soon.
Look, if you can take teddies, crowns and photos,
I might aswell take my dad's bloody football trophies.
Oh, and dog food for Flip.
Lots of dog food. Write that down.
- He can eat rabbit.
- What about wire cutters?
Now that's a great idea.
Two T's.
What about guns?
- We'll take our own guns.
Just turn it off.
- No, I can fix this. Hang on.
The pipe's burst again.
So, we've got plenty of ammo for the rifles, and a full magazine for that.
I got it!
What's that?
We forgot to have someone on watch.
Don't touch the curtains.
Spread out!
Go into different rooms.
If you see anything, yell out.
But stay hidden.
Flip!
Flip, get inside!
It's here!
Did they see you?
- I don't know.
Homer!
Ellie!
Stay still!
Good thing you're so skinny.
Hey guys, I think it's coming back.
Flairs. They're marking the house.
- Thanks a lot, Homer.
- No one asked your opinion, mate.
They know we're here now. -Of course they know. They saw us through the window.
But they didn't know we had guns!
Let's get out of here.
C'mon, let's get out of here, now!
Go, go, go...
Go, go, move it!
Run!
Run!
- Flip!
Leave him!
- No!
Homer was right.
Hell was the only safe place for us now.
But first we had to find
Robyn and Lee.
What's wrong?
- The Heron Bridge!
Jesus, look at them all.
They are coming up from
Cobbler's Bay.
I bet you this is one of the first places they captured.
It's probably full of ships right now.
Yeah. And our bridge gives them direct access to it.
I've always hated that bridge.
Come on, we have to get to Robyn's house.
Robyn!
Ellie?
How did you know it was her?
- That's her dad's walking stick.
What was she gonna do, beat us with it?
Ellie, thank God!
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, I'm fine.
Where is Lee?
He's been shot.
Wait here a minute.
Someone should go with her.
All clear. Let's go.
Robyn. Go, go, go...
Don't point that thing at me.
- This is dr Clement.
It's okay, he's my dentist.
He works across the street.
- Dr Clement, it's me. It's Robyn.
- Quiet down, the lot of you.
Don't you know there's a bloody war going on?
Shine that here.
How is it? -He was lucky.
The bullet went right through.
Thank you. -You picked the hell of a weekend to go camping.
We heard the planes, but we didn't see any...
That's how they did it.
Freighter planes and container ships.
Took all the ports and runways in the first 24 hours.
News said there was some kind of explosion at the airfield.
None of us paid much attention to it.
Next thing you know, they are rolling across the bridge in their tanks and trucks, rounding up everyone, taking them all to the Showground.
Lee's whole family.
Yours too.
And mine? -Yours I don't know anything about.
What about my parents?
George and Martha Yannos.
Did they ever get their teeth fixed? -No.
Then how the hell would I know who they are? -I was just asking, doc.
I've been hiding in the closet for three straight days, living in my own piss and shit, just waiting for them to come and find me.
I thought I'll finally snap when
I saw you carrying Lee in here.
- You carried him?
- Yeah, I had to.
If his leg starts to hurt, you gotta give him another shot.
Wait, you're not staying with us?
Look, I took a hell of a risk coming down here for Lee, alright?
I've done enough.
I've gotta go.
Wait, dr Clement. Are there any others out there? Like us?
Oh, yeah. I've seen few people try to do some things.
Try to be heroes.
Apparently one group even tried to blow up Heron bridge.
To stop all those bloody convoys coming up from Cobbler's Bay.
They all paid the price.
Are you okay?
I think we should get a vehicle.
- We always had two.
First one you dump somewhere.
Second one is a getaway car.
- So, you had practice at this?
- Great. I'll just go get mom's car, park it at the front and ask soldiers to look the other way, shall I?
Sorry. I'm just... tired.
How about if we get something silent?
Golf carts, shopping trollies...
- Prams, pushers...
Wheelchairs? -Yeah, could you ride in a wheelchair?
I could, but the more I move the more it hurts. -Wait...
What if we're going about this the wrong way?
What do you mean?
We're thinking of quiet sneaky little things, right?
What if we went to the other extreme?
Rock up in something so indestructible that it wouldn't matter who saw us.
Such as?
Shit!
Let's go!
Are you alright?
- Hang on. -What?
- I can't climb up there.
- Get in the bucket.
- In this?
- Yeah.
I thought you said you could drive this thing.
I said I can drive a tractor.
Get in.
Oh shit.
Drive, Ellie. Drive!
Take this, shoot back at them!
- No, I won't do it.
This is no time to get religious.
- I said no!
You're bleeding!
Go!
I hope Homer's got a getaway car.
- I hope he remembers where to meet us.
Even Homer knows how to find a bloody church. -Ellie!
Start praying again.
Lord, forgive us our sins...
Hold on!
I think we lost one of them.
We lost a tire!
You're driving in circles!
- I'm doing the best I can!
You are dangerous. -That's what my driving instructor said.
He's still chasing us!
How do you dump the rubbish?
- That switch, I think.
Who is dangerous now?
- Do you think any of them got hurt?
Don't worry.
God will understand.
Where's Homer?
He's supposed to be here.
Where is he?
Maybe he got caught.
We have to keep going, get out of town.
No. Ellie, we've got to wait for Homer.
How long do you think it's gonna be before they send another vehicle?
Or even a helicopter?
We have to leave now!
Sorry I'm late. I forgot where the bloody church was.
Why are we stopping?
- I have to rest.
Move over, I'll drive.
- No, dad said only I...
Just don't, okay?
This is Chris Lang's house.
Oh, that guy is such a weirdo.
- He's a genius, Kevin.
- He's a bloody stoner.
- Stoners are people too.
I don't really care as long as there's a soft bed in there.
And maybe a toothbrush.
- I've got a spare toothbrush.
Chris says his father was born on the corner of Straight and Narrow.
And that he was born in the other end of town.
The day before it all began, mom and dad left for Saudi Arabia.
So, here I am. Alone.
And the power goes off at like nine...
... or ten. Nine.
Yeah, nine.
So I think, okay.
I better ring up and find out what's going on.
I'm an idiot.
The phones are down too.
So, I'm so bent by this point.
Like, I'm really stoned. I'm baked.
Anyway, I walk down to the car...
... and dad, get this right, dad has locked the car and taken the keys with him.
I think he's such a wanker for doing that.
You know, like he didn't even trust me with a car for one week.
So now, I have to walk to the Ramseys' place.
And it is far. Like, take what you think is far, time it by like 10, say.
And that's how far it was.
And when I get there...
... nobody is at home.
And it's like... oh, great!
Because the next place is even further.
Anyway, I walk around the corner.
And I can see the Ramseys in their truck.
They'd hit a tree.
But that's not what has killed them.
They've been shot.
They've been shot?!
Like no one gets shot.
And I mean, heaps of times.
Mr Ramsey, Mrs Ramsey, even baby Jessica's been shot.
So, I think to myself...
Either I've been smoking some really weird shit, or this isn't your typical day in Wirrawee.
Anyway, I've just been by myself ever since, really.
Just chilling out.
It's been nice.
Nice.
How funny are dogs?
How does it feel to get shot?
I didn't even feel it at first.
But by the time I got back to the restaurant, it felt like my whole leg was on fire.
Like somebody was pulling a barbed wire throught it.
They wrecked your restaurant?
Yeah.
I used to hate that place.
Working there, being there.
Just living there.
I felt like I was in prison or something.
But you know, I helped make that place what it was.
So when someone smashes a window, they are smashing glass that
I hand-polished a thousand times.
Or they are tearing curtains that my mom and I hand-stitched.
You get a certain type of attachment to the place.
It's weird. Takes on its own kind of beauty.
You know, I always used to look forward to geography.
I should go back and check on Chris. -Chris?
Yeah, I left him on watch.
Sorry.
Chris.
Chris? Hey!
Get up. Get up!
Are you awake now, you little shit?
- Geez Ellie, take it easy.
- Take it easy? -Yeah, I just shut my eyes for a second.
Don't you understand how it's all changed, Chris? Don't you get it?
- Yeah, I do. I do get it.
- If we take it easy any more...
We might aswell shoot each other now and get it over with.
Okay I get it. I do.
I'm sorry.
I'm really really sorry.
Must be that time of the month.
Shoot me. -What are you doing?
- Go on Chris, shoot me!
- I don't wanna shoot you.
- You can't kill me while I'm awake?
- Geez Ellie, it was an accident.
I'm sorry. -Bullshit you're sorry!
People are dying out there, Chris.
Families have been split apart.
We've seen homes blown to pieces.
Yet you're up here having a fuckin vacation.
So, go on. Don't wait for me to fall asleep.
Buck up, be a man, look me in the eye and pull the trigger.
Ellie, please... -No?
- What are you doing?
Do you know what penalty is for falling asleep at your post?
Do you know what they used to do? -No, Ellie...
Ellie!
Put the gun down, please.
I said I'm sorry. Please!
He risked all our lives.
Ellie.
It's Chris.
It's just Chris.
How long have I been asleep?
About 16 hours.
How's Chris?
Still pretty shaken.
You gave him a hell of a fright, you know.
I'll apologize when he wakes up.
I promise.
Actually, he wants to apologize to you.
You were right, El.
You went a little overboard about it, but you were right.
You're a good mate, Corrie.
And you're a bloody nutcase.
- Good book?
- Better than the movie.
Yeah, books usually are.
The general repeated his claim that the Coalition nations
can no longer support their booming populations.
And that Australia must be made to share her vast land
and extensive natural resources with her less fortunate neighbors.
In this way, general hopes the invasion will balance
the economic scales within the region
and eventually lead to a new era of peace and stability.
Meanwhile, more than half a million Coalition forces
are pouring into Australia though three captured ports.
These ports have now being identified as Townsville,
Port Headland and Cobbler's Bay.
- You heal well.
- I have good genes.
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.
You know at Chris' house the other day when I was... playing with your hair and then...
- Yeah, all right.
I know what we did. -Okay,
I thought you might have forgotten.
What, do you think I do that stuff so often that I forget about it?
But you've hardly spoken to me since then.
- I'm just confused.
- About me?
Yeah, about you, about us.
About this war.
About this mess that we found ourselves in.
The truth is, half the time
I have no idea what I'm doing.
So then, I do these things, and they don't always mean what I think they mean.
Do you know what I mean?
No, I've no idea what you mean.
- Okay...
Look, it meant something then and it does mean something now, but... I don't think it means what you'd wanted it to mean.
- Do you just not like me?
- No, Lee. I like you, okay?
I like you very much. But right now, you're driving me crazy.
I don't know why
I was talking the way I was.
All I really wanted to do is hold him
and tell him that everything is gonna be alright.
I just didn't know if it was.
None of us did.
All we could say for sure was that for now, we were free.
But we've done nothing to earn our freedom.
Not yet, anyway.
The way I see it, these are our choices.
One: we can sit here and do nothing.
Come out when the war's over.
I don't know about you guys... but I'm not so good at doing nothing.
Two: we can all try to be heroes.
Rescue our families from the Showground's.
But like dr Helpfull said, we'll probably pay the price.
Or three: we can go out there, at night. Guerilla style.
Using hit and run tactics and take back Wirrawee.
Maybe even help win this thing.
- Yeah, you're right.
We were born here. We know this country better than they do.
We can use that to our advantage.
Plant traps, ambush them, pick them off.
- You're talking about murder.
- It's not murder if it's in a war.
What about the Bible, "thou shall not kill". What about that?
David killed Goliath. -That doesn't apply in a situation that is a metaphor.
Do you think it's fair, do you?
- No. -Just let them walk in, take everything they want and our parents worked so hard for?
No Kevin, I don't think it's fair.
I don't think it's fair at all.
Are you in or are you out?
Well, I feel like I should be out.
But I can't stop thinking about the coincidence that... from all the weekends that we could've chosen to go camping, we chose that weekend.
God spared us for a reason.
And I think he wants us to do something.
So I will help you Homer, but
I'm not going to murder anybody.
All this talk scares me to death, but...
I think we have to fight back anyway.
We'll never sleep again if we don't.
- We'll never sleep again if we did.
- What are you chicken, Chris?
- You'd know all about that, wouldn't you?
There's nothing chicken about staying alive, mate.
We're not even trained for this stuff.
What would our parents say?
They'd say the most important thing is our safety.
They wouldn't want us dead in exchange for them being alive.
I suppose when the time comes,
I'll do what I have to do.
What worries me though is that...
I can't guarantee that I'm not gonna pack up under pressure.
I'm so scared and...
I think that I might just stand there and scream.
None of us knows how we're gonna react when shit hits the fan.
You've done alright so far.
Well, for a townie.
We have to do something.
I'm not just gonna sit here.
And do nothing.
I'm different to all of you.
I have blood on my hands.
I can't tell if what I did was right or wrong.
I'd like to think it was to save my friends, or as part of some noble crusade to save my country.
Really it just comes down to the fact that I valued my life over theirs.
How many people is it okay to kill in order to keep me alive?
At what point do we lose our souls, if we haven't already?
In the end I think we just have to trust our instincts.
After all, it is all we have left, isn't it?
What do your instincs tell you?
That it's time to go to war.
What are we gonna do?
Blow it up?
Cobbler's Bay is one of their key ports.
And this bridge is the only way in or out.
It's the key to everything.
If they can't resupply their soldiers, then they can't fight.
They've got sentries. -We have to find the way to distract them.
Remember what dr Clement said?
About how other people tried to blow up that bridge before?
Amateurs.
Couple of years ago me and some mates came up with the way to take this bridge down. Just for fun.
That's hardly reassuring, knowing your mates.
Can you drive a petrol tanker?
- Hurry up.
- Okay.
Sorry.
- Big one?
- The big one.
There! They are there.
In the window.
Wait! -What?
- Can I do it?
I've always wanted to smash a window.
- One more.
- Fi! Just...
Do it!
Fi, run!
Stop!
Turn around!
Do not move!
- Guys, are you there?
- We're all set. We can see you.
Don't come any closer. Wait there till we get the word from Homer.
Lee and me are almost there.
- Lee and "I".
Okay, we're in the position too.
I can see 10 soldiers on the bridge.
We've only got about 15 minutes before the next convoy comes along.
We'll call you when we're ready.
- Okay honey, we'll be waiting.
Did you just call him 'honey'?
- Homer. I called him 'Homer'.
No, you just called him 'honey'.
- I didn't. -Yes you did, I heard you.
It may have sounded like 'honey' but I definitely said 'Homer'.
- Go. Go.
- You gotta hiss like a snake.
No, no, like a snake.
So, princess Fifi has the hots for a rough as guts Homer.
Have you kissed him?
- Would you mind if I had?
Me? Are you serious?
Of course not.
I just know that you two are close.
- No, never like that.
- Okay, good.
Well then, yes I have.
Is he a good kisser?
Actually no, I don't wanna know.
Don't tell me. It's kinda gross.
- He's a great kisser.
- Great. Now I know.
But he's so down on himself.
He's got this weird thing about my parents being lawyers.
And he always used to joke about it.
But I don't think he's really joking at all.
Jesus, Fi, how long did it take to figure that out? -What do you mean?
You know the kind of guys he knocks about. They're just... more at home hanging out at the pub than playing croquet with your parents.
My parents don't play croquet.
Ellie. Ellie!
Fi! Behind you!
Homer is like two people.
He's so confident with a group, and then he's supershy with me.
I just don't understand.
Ellie?
If I could understand Homer
I'm sure I'd understand all guys.
Like Lee?
How did you know about that?
- C'mon Ellie, everybody knows.
God, this is worse than recess.
They can't hear us.
Homer, you have to go now.
- But we're still not ready.
There are soldiers creeping up behind tanker and Ellie's not answering me.
Ellie, pick up.
Just think about it. The eight of us are living out in the bush.
And the entire world is completely turned upside down.
I'd just hate to be responsible for ruining whatever little good we did have by Lee and me having a falling out.
Look, Ellie. I'm no expert on relationships or anything.
But I do know that you have this tendency to reason everything through all the time, and I just think the future is the future.
It has to take care of itself.
And by the way, it's Lee and 'I'.
Get out of the truck!
Move! Drive!
Here goes the brilliant plan.
Ellie, I'm so sorry I turned it off.
- Doesn't matter.
Here.
Go!
Ellie, we need the lighter.
- You were to bring it.
No, you were to bring the lighter.
I don't have it.
Christ, the soldiers!
Where the hell is Kevin going?
Robyn, we can't get to you.
- Don't worry about us, just go!
You guys take this one.
Corrie, you're with me.
Run Homer, let's go!
Hurry up, they're coming!
C'mon!
Kevin!
Corrie? Corrie!
Get away!
Come on.
Wait!
Gosh!
It was so much bigger than I expected.
- That's the biggest joint I've ever lit.
Did you see the bridge?
Corrie! Oh my God, what happened?
She got shot as we were driving away.
I can't...
I can't stop the bleeding.
We'll take her to go see dr Clement.
He can fix her the same way that he fixed Lee.
- She needs a hospital, Fi.
- I'm gonna get the Landrover.
- Ellie...
- Hey. Hey!
You have to leave me.
No, I'm not leaving you.
- She's right.
It sounds cruel, but the only thing to do is ring the bell and run.
- What?
- No!
- No I can't leave her. I won't.
- We have to be rational about this.
If we take her to the hospital, we will get caught.
No, I don't give a shit what's rational. Alright?
Corrie is our mate.
She is our mate. And I...
I love her.
I'm taking her in.
I'm staying with her.
I'm staying.
Good luck, mate.
I'll come get you when you're better. Okay?
Pinky swear.
We've hit them.
Hit them hard.
They are gonna be coming after us now with everything they've got.
And they did come after us.
For three weeks now, we've seen...
dozens of planes and helicopters and search parties.
But they haven't found us yet.
Which means Corrie and Kevin have told them nothing.
A month ago, we were just an average bunch of teenagers.
Studying for school and complaining about our parents.
Now we're soldiers.
Trapped behind enemy lines and fighting to survive.
We won't run.
We won't hide.
We'll fight and keep fighting.
And never give up.
Until this war is finally won.
Who can say what they will become when they grow up?

Then DANCE ON CHANCE
Gentlemen...
On behalf of the business community in Kiangsu and Anhui and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor in charge of the Shanghai garrison.
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...
Objection!
I object!
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin, members of the Restoration Society have sacrificed for the cause.
You're not qualified for the position!
Mr. T'ao, to draw a line with Chinese United League is inappropriate.
This is segregation!
You're not up for the task!
T'ao Ch'eng-Chang, this is counter-revolutionary!
You have no right to label me!
I'm telling you, even if Sun Yet-sen were here today it's still unacceptable.
Under Emperor Shun-chih, you needed a pigtail to keep your head.
Business was great back then.
Now, it's the exact opposite, you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.
Recruiting for the New Army!
Join the New Revolutionary Army!
Hurry up and enrol!
Hurry up and enrol!
I repeat,
Join the New Army!
Join the revolution!
I'll sign up!
Dr. Sun's position is clear.
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President to counter the Ch'ing court and force the Emperor to abdicate.
Dr. Sun made it clear, end monarchy, stop the war set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.
I ascended the throne at a young age, during a time of great upheavals,
I understand the will of the people, that honour and glory of one family should not come before it.
I wish that people can live on in peace
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.
- To form the Republic of China. - Why not?
The Emperor will step down and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges
Don't cry, and personally experience this new era because you're the Emperor.
Which can only be great.
So decreed.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Though I'm unfit to become President, upon President Sun's recommendation, and the support of all ethnic groups,
I shall do my best to make the Republic of China strong.
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.
According to "Records of the Grand Historian" during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou state affairs were discussed until consensus was reached.
I see.
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.
Forget it!
Tse-tung, who do you think should be President?
Dr. Sun.
Then why did Yuan get the job?
Because he has guns.
Before Dr. Sun stepped down, he pushed through the Provisional Constitution which will become the foundation.
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.
Party politics is our platform.
We may have conceded a title, but as long as we win the election, we can appoint our own cabinet members.
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic, he can be anybody, or nobody.
We must dismantle one party to build another.
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League, whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty, into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party, the foremost political party for the Republic.
Sir!
Party politics determines the polity of the Republic, you must take it seriously.
Here we are!
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election, insist on fair competition, unite the Party!
This is important, remember it well.
I Will.
Thank you.
I won't forget!
- Take care! - Take care!
- Take care! - Goodbye!
Chiao-jen!
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
My mother... lives on humble means.
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...
I count on you... to look after her.
Chiao-jen!
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Hang in there!
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites, the President changes with officials in attendance then lights the ceremonial pyre, offers jade and satin, offers roast meat, reads first prayer...
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have different opinions on the polity.
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy, the French parliamentary system, or the American presidential system.
Which is more suitable for us?
Japanese monarchy is outdated for a republic like ours.
That's the crux of the problem, if we keep changing our minds, we'll be neither here nor there.
What are you suggesting?
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.
Had we persisted initially with that,
China would have been one of the Powers and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.
What about you, Yuan-hung?
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.
General Ts'ai!
Ts'ai O!
What are you doing?
Sir, I...
You like that?
I'll send you some later.
Thank you.
What comes after the first prayer?
Second and third prayer, then the burning of the sacrificial offerings, and everybody will bow in four directions.
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit all German interests in Shantung and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia to engage in commercial, industrial and mining activities.
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny, and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway shall be extended by 99 years.
That's daylight robbery!
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?
This document... how can you explain to the Western Powers?
This is confidential.
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.
Sir, whoever leaks the contents, regardless of his esteemed position, will be sanctioned by Japan.
Spare me this bullshit!
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me when he was alive.
Who do you think you are?
Your Excellency, neither the late Ito-san nor the Western Powers can save your skin.
Only we can do that.
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?
Have you heard?
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.
He's a traitor!
We're organising a protest, hurry...
Let's go, Tse-tung!
The strength of the Western Powers lies in their ability to tolerate opposition.
In Chu Chih-hsin's
"An Introduction of German Social Revolutionaries" he mentioned two western philosophers, by the name of Marx and Engels.
Tu-hsiu!
Excuse me!
What is it?
Look!
What Yuan did was treacherous!
It's time we go home.
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.
Is that true?
Kuo-Chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.
All founding emperors in history were under 50,
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.
That's good!
Whoever wants to be Emperor, will suffer the wrath of the nation.
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate and the will of the people ascends to the throne and rules.
By virtue of an unanimous vote, the Representative Assembly of the Republic is in favour of the President in becoming the Emperor of China.
Long live the Emperor!
Long live His Majesty!
I'm overwhelmed by your support.
I hear you insist on taking cold baths, and advocate saving the country with able bodies.
I used to.
Not now?
I'm a bit lost.
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government, able bodies are useless.
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows, the outcome is obvious.
Look what happened in Shantung.
You have the answer?
Not yet, sir.
Talk is cheap, finding the way out may take a lifetime, even generations.
Dad!
This is my daughter K'ai-hui, this is Mao Tse-tung.
You're so tall.
I'll go out and play.
The question I ask of you is what do you really want?
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!
I wish I could bring you along.
Why don't you?
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.
I only want to know, is a Courtesan really that important?
Everyone knows
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.
Without me, who'll take care of you?
Promise me you'll come back alive.
Unfortunately,
I've pledged this body and soul to my country, not you.
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.
I know.
I appeal to all of you to answer to a call of duty.
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses, he will be punished by an army of justice.
An army of justice?
Well said!
But where's your army?
General Ts'ai is here, sir!
Here comes my army!
You look so frail!
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...
Have a seat!
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.
Commander-in-chief,
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.
Go ahead.
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.
Take the advance guard off duty, let them rest.
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.
Yes, sir!
Bring up all our heavy artillery.
Who the hell is their commander?
Wu P'ei-fu!
Son of a bitch!
What's going on here?
Feng Kuo-Chang and the generals just declared their opposition to the new polity.
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing has declared Kuanghsi independent.
The country is in uproar!
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.
It's mere formality.
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un, if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan, we might still have a chance.
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.
Mr. Fan Ching-Sheng, the Minister of Education will now confer the letters of appointment.
On behalf of the Ministry of Education and the National Peking University Council,
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu as Dean of the School of Letters,
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,
Li Ta-Chao as Head Librarian, and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.
Isn't he the renowned academic?
Why does he dress like that?
What's so funny?
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head, those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.
Mine is visible, yours is not.
Feel free to enjoy it.
How dare you! This is the Senate, the sacred ground of the Republic.
What sacred ground?
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars who are doomed to fail.
What do you mean, General?
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,
Chang Hsum is my name.
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,
Understand? I hereby proclaim effective immediately this dump is closed, the party is over.
Understand?
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body, you have no right to close it down.
Listen...
I'm not only shutting down this cackling dump of a Senate,
I'm also closing down your bloody Republic.
Long live Your Majesty!
You may rise.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
I'm late, Your Majesty!
You may look up when you speak.
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.
They bullied you because you're a child.
They took advantage of your age.
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang, with the title of First Lord.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You may run three laps around the Palace.
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.
It's flying!
Flying...
Your Majesty,
Look!
It's airborne!
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!
We still have a proclamation to make...
Don't force him to be Emperor, we only want to be safe.
Traitor!
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force, hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique for forcibly dissolving the Senate, holding the President hostage and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible and against the will of the people and Heaven.
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction will lead a punitive expedition to crush the traitors.
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.
It's time for us students to take action.
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.
I don't understand.
About what?
By conceding the presidency to Yuan the Senate has made a fatal error.
The problem with China is not just about choosing the wrong President!
Isn't that a reason?
If all fault lies with the head of state, then the problems we had before were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.
But what about the restoration fiasco?
Who should we blame?
What are you getting at?
Today's China cannot be changed by having a different Emperor or President.
An utmost humiliation!
The Chinese race has been shamed!
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.
Yet in a mere six years, we already have two emperors.
Remember, China is a republic, to have an emperor in a republic is so utterly ironic.
Bravo!
The Republic champions freedom, equality and philanthropy.
Yet, since the founding of the Republic, equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on, philanthropy does not exist.
Lives were lost and blood was shed in exchange for a republic in name only.
That is intolerable!
Is this the Republic people have sacrificed for?
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly, and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!
Despite the 1911 Revolution and the rallying cry for the Republic, people still worship Confucius without learning the essence of democratic freedom.
Looking back over history for the past decades, each time there's a failed republican movement, monarchism will make another comeback.
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.
Fellow students!
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.
In order for this country to be strong, we must first remove this ancient burden from the hearts of the people.
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.
You praise New Culture and bury the old and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago that is damaging today?
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar, can't you see what Confucius advocated then is not applicable to us today?
What Confucius taught us is like arithmetics.
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.
It will never be 8.
Blaming your miscalculations on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!
Culture needs reforms to keep up with time.
Some say classical Chinese is refined while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.
But imperial examination system was harmful.
Even the best written eight-legged essays were detached from society and impractical.
They're useless except in examinations.
Our country needs talents, pragmatism will make us strong.
I represent the Women's College of Education,
I think classical Chinese is more concise.
That's a fact!
Please cite an example.
Take the phrase "unable to do it"
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?
That's four words.
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.
Such as?
"Can't be done!"
Bravo!
Before the 1911 Revolution, we modelled after Japan.
But it doesn't appear to be working.
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.
Why don't we learn from the teacher but choose to follow the student?
It's not about Japanese or Americans.
It's a matter of new versus old culture.
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people, we must abolish the old and popularize the new.
That's how our nation can be re-born.
Who should we learn from?
Whether it's the U.S., France
Japan, or even Russia.
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?
That's absurd!
The governance of any country in the world is a way of thinking that stems from its own culture.
Look at the world, taking a macro view of the future of humanity, is not absurd at all.
There's a man in Russia called Lenin, who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.
The ideology he introduced is Marxism from Germany.
What is Bolshevik?
Bolshevik means majority.
What is majority? Peasants and workers.
The many millions of oppressed labourers.
The success of Russia is a victory for Bolshevism, common people and the proletariat, for the first time ever in the history of mankind, and also the greatest.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun to get rid of Li Yuan-hung, then he took out Chang Hsun.
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.
There's no end to this war.
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch a northern expedition, and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.
By some distance.
But in-fighting among various factions makes KMT vulnerable.
What's your view?
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.
Sir...
Sir...
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.
First the south, then the north.
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!
There's no end to this revolution
You-jen, what are we missing?
Madam, same as before, no money, no guns, no troops.
Fellow students,
I believe France is the hub of European civilisation, the standard-bearer of modern revolution, and a model for global revolution.
Then let's go to France.
But... to go abroad we need money.
We'll raise it.
Let's split up,
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?
Peking.
Peking?
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.
Which faculty are you from?
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.
I'm visiting, came across your class, and took the liberty of sitting in.
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you, but Peking University has its rules.
I'm a great admirer of yours,
I only wish to sit in for one session.
I'll leave quietly afterwards.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
The university is not a sanctuary, anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.
That's the rule here!
In any case, because of Hu Shih's huge reputation
I don't want to miss his lecture.
What brings you to Peking?
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.
Ta-Chao.
This student of mine... what should we do with him?
You're...
Mr. Li Ta-Chao?
I need an assistant.
Are you willing to work hard?
Absolutely!
I'll do anything anytime.
8 silver dollars a month.
That's plenty.
More than I make as a soldier.
You're a soldier?
Yes, but never went to war.
Close the door, thank you.
You are...
It's me!
K'ai-hui!
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.
For the first time in 100 years,
China shows up on international stage as a victor.
We won't let our nation down!
Let's brace ourselves and demand for the return of Shantung.
Unite... and China shall prevail!
Justice shall prevail!
Look! Behind us are 400 million Chinese.
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.
We shall join you in Paris later.
My words carry little weight, but I'll do my best for the Republic.
Unite...
Justice shall prevail!
Sir, I once thought our nation can be saved by strong mind and body, or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.
But these solutions now seem superficial.
I read your review on Marxism
I think that is the truth.
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.
It's a fraction of what it is about.
You should study "The Communist Manifesto" and its theory of a proletariat revolution.
That's the truth.
"The Communist Manifesto"
I forgot today is New Year's eve.
Stay for dinner.
Sir!
I still have work to do.
It's dad's prescribed hours!
We can now eat New Year dinner.
Great!
Wipe your hands!
Victory of the common people?
Didn't Uncle Li write this?
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.
How is it different?
Most revolutions are led by the elite.
But in Mr. Li's thesis,
Russian revolution is a victory of the common people.
Common people?
Let's have a drink.
I don't drink.
Just one, for the New Year.
Alright.
Let's go watch the fireworks.
Hurry up!
Coming...
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation, great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius were born in Shantung.
China cannot lose Shantung, like the West can't be without Jerusalem.
Concerning the problem of Shantung, the governments have already signed a treaty of 21 Articles.
So it is not necessary to discuss it in this conference.
At the Paris Peace Conference,
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung should be transferred to them permanently.
As expected.
Hu Shih and I intend to write to President Wilson, and force him to mediate.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.
Tse-tung, please come down.
Japan's ambition in China is clearly a threat to American interests.
Wilson must do something.
Mr. Ch'en, if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops, will the U.S. send its fleet to Kiautschou Bay for us?
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points is bullshit?
He's right. Between Japan and China, the Powers can only choose to support one.
They have never backed us in the past.
They supported Japan because they wanted her to contain Russia.
They need to contain Russia now more than ever, don't they?
Thank you, comrades!
Sending you to Peking is to raise money, but you spent your time reading in the library.
He's a genuine bookworm.
We can't go to France without money.
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed is so humiliating.
A cashier's cheque for 20,000 silver dollars!
Where did you get this?
Chang Shih-Chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.
Mao Tse-tung...
You left me speechless!
Do I have to pay it back?
Of course!
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight to make plans for France.
I need to stay on for a while.
You're not going?
Are you courting each other?
I have to go now!
Money!
Do you have to go?
I made a promise.
Will you come back?
Of course, the reason why I'm going is to bring back more advanced learnings.
Mr. Yang is here,
Mr. Li, too, and... you.
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.
If you don't come back,
I'll look for you in France.
Bad news from Paris!
We just got word, the person who signed the loan agreement with Japan last September was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.
Chang Tsung-hsiang!
Traitor!
Something tumultuous is about to happen.
Because of the Peace Conference?
Yes!
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.
If we fail...
Nationalism suppressed for centuries will erupt like a volcano.
What should we do?
Just go with the flow.
We'll turn this world upside down.
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...
Today,
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung is about to succeed due to our diplomatic failure.
If Shantung were taken by Japan, our territorial integrity will be compromised, and the nation will perish.
What should we do now?
Stage protests at foreign legation.
Calm down!
Don't lose sight of our objective!
We just want to be patriotic.
We're doing this to pressure the Peiyang government.
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.
All along, we deluded ourselves into thinking when the war is over the Western Powers will help us.
Now we know we have been betrayed by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles, by the Western Powers who are too busy carving up Europe to care.
And our government had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.
A historic moment is upon us.
Fellow students, take to the streets!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.
They betrayed China!
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!
Betrayed truth and justice!
Something so painfully obvious but overlooked by the Peiyang government!
This Peiyang government that can tolerate such humiliation is not fit to govern us!
They are Western Powers' accomplices, running dogs of the Japanese pirates!
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!
Today, we want an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!
President Wilson is a scoundrel!
He deceived us!
He insulted us!
He toyed with us!
What should we do now?
Fellow countrymen,
Today, we shall petition President Hsu and also the Premier.
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.
We want them to know our demands.
Whoever it is who tries to wipe us out will face a bloody battle!
Pay with blood!
Fight to the end!
Return Tsingtao!
Today's rally is a harbinger of China's bright future.
So, this very moment, this very day...
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of this unprecedented revolution.
Return our sovereignty!
Punish the traitors!
Students have taken to the streets, they're heading for the Legation Quarter.
Ignorant, naive and stupid!
Send police to stop them!
Yes, sir!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Fellow students!
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!
Charge!
Come out!
Young lady!
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!
You've come to the wrong place!
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!
What do you mean?
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.
Come out!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Charge!
Charge!
Go inside and grab the traitors!
Open up...
Open the door!
We were under siege in Japan, it's happening here as well!
Don't cry!
Look, Ping-hsiang!
Don't worry, I'm here.
3 Bamboos!
K'uang Hu-Sheng, bravo!
Jump!
Jump inside!
Soldiers!
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!
Go, Fang Ho!
Quiet...
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung instead of guarding a traitor's house.
Comrades! Brothers...
We're one family!
I believe we're one family,
Those you're holding off are your brothers and sisters.
Each and every one a patriotic student.
Move aside, let us through!
Protect our territory!
Protect our sovereignty!
Brothers!
Everyone of you is patriotic
Am I right?
Yes!
Are you Chinese?
Yes!
Then let us through!
Charge!
Students!
Tell me where he is!
Hand over the traitor!
Search the house! Step aside...
Students...
Listen, harbouring traitors makes you also a traitor of China.
He's here!
Students!
I have nothing to do with it!
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?
I don't know!
Take him away!
Listen...
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!
Burn it...
The police are here!
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?
No, I am not...
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody, just a visiting guest.
Where did they go?
They left.
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!
After him...
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history, have you ever heard of students involved in arson and killing?
They have no choice but to revolt.
Today...
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.
He did it to please our enemies.
As a staff member of the school,
I declare the school will go on strike until the students are released.
Long live students...
Long live revolution...
What is it?
You wrote "The Spirit of the Chinese People" and I admired you for it.
Speaking of principles, you should know our differences with foreigners.
But today, you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!
What has happened to your principles?
You're siding with the enemy.
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.
Even soldiers are siding with the students.
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!
We mustn't go against the tide.
Tu-hsiu, what is it?
Have we won already?
Is this time for celebration?
Ridiculous!
Mr. Hu, are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao?
Why not?
You must have a sound argument.
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.
But such a theory though proven successful in Russia does not mean it's applicable in China.
We must not act like a parrot and lose ourselves by following others.
To sit back and talk about theories without solving the actual problems is no different from Confucianism.
If this is what New Culture is about, then it's meaningless.
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia, it's not going to solve our problems.
You're wrong, sir.
Confucianism is a feudal code,
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.
You can't compare the two.
Esteemed delegates, what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?
I am furious.
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.
If he still wants to continue as President, he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone, and sets an example for us all.
Peking University is proud of him.
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!
So sorry...
- Over here! - What took you so long?
We got lost!
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later, let's get on board.
Come on...
Let's go!
Wait...
I'm thinking... transplanting the experience of a foreign revolution does it really work?
Changed your mind again?
China has much more complex issues,
I'd better stay.
Good luck all... Till we meet again.
Give me some money!
Who is he?
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.
What a shame he's not going!
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?
Because we told the truth.
He's afraid the truth will come out about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!
Hu'nan is finished with him around.
We're only poor workers we have no say.
How do you write the word "work"?
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.
Yes, heaven above your head with your feet on the ground.
The words "work" and "man" together make the word "heaven",
It means the world under heaven.
Workers and peasants will rule the world.
Sounds too good to be true.
This is not my idea, it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.
This foreigner advocated equality of all men.
Adopting this theory, the Russian workers now rule their own country.
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke of will be universal.
Chinese workers should follow suit.
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government that bullied and oppressed us.
Yes...
Tse-tung, your telegram.
Tse-tung... the doctor said dad had a stroke, he can't talk, he can't hear.
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...
Before taken ill, dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.
Remember... the summer of 1915 you asked me a question?
All these years,
I've been thinking hard.
I'm close to having an answer.
But...
Sir...
Dad...
As my wife, life will be tough.
If you're with me, you won't enjoy a stable life, no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.
Not even a witness or marriage license.
I'm willing.
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.
Follow me!
Let them go!
You have no right to arrest us!
What are you doing? Let go!
What do you want?
Let go of me!
Let us out!
In this world, who are the noblest people?
My answer to that... is the working class.
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in are all created by workers.
We slave for a living, but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.
Is that fair?
No!
Of course not!
That's why we must unite and go on strike.
Confront these bourgeois factory owners and show them our strength.
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.
Fellow workers, in the future workers will rule the world.
Long live workers!
Release the students!
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.
Who's not eating?
Let him starve to death!
He has no one but himself to blame.
Who wrote this?
I did.
These are our latest demands.
The hunger strike continues until they are met.
We want books and newspapers.
- Go ahead. - Yes!
We want New Year dinner.
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!
We'll even eat outside.
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.
Certainly.
What's your name?
Chou En-lai.
Why did you change your mind?
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!
Let's eat.
Goodbye!
Mr. Ch'en!
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-Chao"
Follow me!
If you leave Peking while on bail and get arrested again, it'll be difficult to get out.
I'll go back to Shanghai.
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.
Don't say that!
Your arrest has shaken the nation.
That's as big an honour as you can get!
What are you studying these days?
The Russian Revolution.
Hu Shih was right about you!
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.
It's the last resort when all else have failed.
Now tell me, why model after Russia?
The reason why the Russians succeeded was because the Bolsheviks united the workers and peasants, the broadest social classes.
To unite the nation, you must first unite peasants and workers.
To unite them,
China must first have its own Bolshevik.
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai, that's exactly what you've to do.
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south, form our own political party at once.
Easy...
When I get to Shanghai,
I'll send you your favourite candy.
You must keep your word!
Take care!
Take care!
We should help China build her own Bolshevik Party.
The committee nominates Maring to assist.
Excellent, go right away!
Bravo!
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?
Each region should send two delegates to the congress, and the Caucuses in Japan and Europe will each send one delegate.
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,
Ch'ang-she, Wuhan and Tsinan will all be represented.
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.
You two will represent Peking.
Remember, you're there as my personal representative.
Aren't you attending?
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend, what's the point of having the congress?
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.
Students are borrowing more books for summer vacation.
I can't leave as Head Librarian.
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues, if we argue during the congress there will be no way back.
I see.
Remember,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.
I understand.
This should be enough for a month, when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.
Dad left this, you have it.
No, you keep it.
Don't be late for the congress.
No!
Just take it.
I'm leaving, take good care of yourself.
Let me introduce myself,
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.
I'm Li Han-Chun from Shanghai.
Li Ta from Shanghai.
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.
Tung Pi-Wu from Wuhan.
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.
Pao Hui-Seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung, it's been a while.
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.
My apologies, gentlemen...
Sorry for being late.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.
Who's the lovely lady?
My wife.
Greetings, I'm Li Li-Chuang.
But we can't accommodate a couple...
I'm sorry...
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.
Bringing your spouse to the congress?
Everyone...
This is my wife, Wang Hui-w...
I'm working the reception.
Look for me if you need anything.
We've all had long trips, get some rest.
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.
106 rue Wantz.
I'm most honoured to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao to chair the First National Congress.
Let me introduce to you
Comrade Maring, an observer from Comintern.
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.
The first item on the agenda is to decide on the name of the party.
Our view regarding the name of the party is clear-cut.
From the "The Communist Manifesto", we adopt the word "Communist" and call it the Chinese Communist Party.
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.
Mr. Li's preference is
Chinese Communist Party.
I agree.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Unanimously passed.
Rickshaw-man,
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.
We're switching hotels?
We're being followed.
Be careful, don't look around.
Palace Hotel.
Got it!
Is there another exit?
There's a back entrance for the staff.
Wait for us there in five minutes.
Sure!
Why are we being followed everywhere?
I'm sorry, sir.
The first floor is full, is the second floor alright?
Alright!
Jump!
Stupid idiots...
Go look for them!
Find them in three days or else!
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.
The Peking caucus has 13 members, including Li Ta-Chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.
Heads up, everyone! is hereby pronounced for delegates to comment and discuss. is hereby pronounced for delegates to comment and discuss.
Proletariat must join force with the revolutionary army and overthrow the bourgeois regime; they must help the working class until the class system is abolished, and until the class struggle has ended.
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished, a proletariat dictatorship will be established.
Liaise with the Comintern, and adopt the Soviet model.
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers and adopt social revolution as our goal.
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies, and willing to be loyal members, upon the introduction of a Party member, regardless of gender and nationality can be admitted as Party members and become our comrades.
But... before their initiation into the Party, they must sever all ties with other parties and organisations whose platforms are contradictory to ours.
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress, the main agenda is to adopt the platform and election of the Central Committee.
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky will attend tomorrow's closing session.
Rickshaw!
Sorry, we had to make a detour.
Is everyone here?
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet, he'll be right back.
It's that Chou again!
Let's not wait.
The draft platform we tabled yesterday, can continue to be discussed now.
I have a comment.
Regarding nationality...
Can I help you?
Looking for someone?
What do you want?
Who are you looking for?
Chairman Wang of the Social League.
There's no Social League or Chairman Wang.
I'm sorry...
Maring calls for an immediate recess.
I agree with Comrade Maring.
Let's adjourne.
This is my home. What are you doing here?
Why do you organise meeting in your house?
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.
That two are from which country?
Which two?
The two foreigners.
They're Dutch.
Pack up and be ready to move out!
Sir.
What do you do for a living?
Professor.
Him?
My colleague.
Today I can close your house and catch your people.
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.
If not, you will burn yourself.
I won't.
How is it?
It's fine.
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.
I suggest we go to Chiahsing rent a boat for the meeting.
Is Maring coming?
He's too obvious a target, for our safety, he's not going.
Alright!
What time do we leave?
There's a train tomorrow at 10:00am.
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.
Are you under surveillance?
Probably not, it was an accident.
Let's go home.
The meeting is not yet over.
To form a national party with just 50 people, this has to be a joke!
A gun!
Don't stare!
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!
Tatung Hotel?
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.
His wife was petrified. So they left.
It was a lovers' suicide pact!
Cowards!
Let's go.
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.
The last item on the agenda, is to elect the Party Central Committee.
Under democratic principles, we shall vote for members of the Central Committee.
We should have 13 delegates, but only 12 are in attendance.
After the vote,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta are elected Central Committee members,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.
Meeting is concluded.
Comrades,
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto" to illustrate my thrill and excitement.
The Communists disdain to conceal their aims and views.
They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.
Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution.
The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
They have a world to win.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite...
Proletarians of all countries...
...unite
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
Hope you 're well rested. ln about five minutes, we will be beginning our descent into New Delhi lnternational airport -

Digital is for fucking tourists.
You 're ringing, so you must be Tashi.
Hi, l'm Menaka.

So true.
Hey, do you want me to sign something for you ?
Because l don't mind.

But do you think you can make him a little happier?
Happier? Who, the banana?
Haan, you know like he's having fun.
All his life he's wanted to be in a banana-split -

Dream come true, for the banana?
You know happy, something like -

Just five minutes away. ln the morning we'll walk over to your place for breakfast and in the evening you 'll both come over for dinner. lt'll be wonderful. l just can't wait.
Delicate.
You can work wonders with the right model. l'm guessing this is some for you -

Bacche, say cheese.
Man, is nothing sacred?
He doesn't mind. l asked him.
So that pretty young thing was a waste of your time and this is worthwhile? l don't know what that says about you .

Yeah, a gay necrophiliac.
Fucking idiots.
Yours.

Can you drop this off for me?
No.
Thanks.
Here's the address.
Go.
What are you doing this evening?
Oh, you know.
Work.
All work, no play, Tashi... dull boy.
Give me one.
Make it spicy!
Let me go.
You want some of this?
200? Rate's gone up.
No, my darling.
Asshole.
Hi.
Oh fuck!
What are you doing, lying in the dark like that? l'm sick, man. l feel poisoned.
Did you see a doctor?
Yeah.
So here's what you need to do.
Just take my scooter.
Why?
Just take it.
Fucker!
Why am l taking your scooter?
Tashi asked me to drop off this package.
That fucking thing is still floating around?
Listen if l wasn't sick, l'd do it.
Sure.
Listen, since you 're going out in any case, can you do me a favour?
What?
Bastards!
Bastards.!
This world is full of uncivilized people.
Don't pay them any attention.
Again? From the top?
So, the doctor has to check for food poisoning.
Good.
Do you mind - l have to send him a stool sample?
Fuck off.
Patient name?
Nitin Berry.
Mr. Bhatia...
Okay, l'll talk to you later.
Sir... this is shit.
Thank you .
Sisterfucker.
New car?
Yes.
Very nice! Beauty, great colour.
Thank you , Mr. Jain.
Mr. Tashi, l just wanted to remind you that the rent is due next week. l know, Mr. Jain.
Good. Good. Very good. lt is just that it was late last month -
- and the month before that also, that's why.
You said you 'll speak to
Mr. Maharaj about the dancing.
Every night bharatnatyam on our heads.
Kathak.
See, l spoke to him -
- and he said that he will try and take his class early.
That was last week.
Really?
Hi.
What's wrong with you ?
Bastard, l'm dying.
Okay. And you ?
Meeting Ritu for a movie.
''Return of Disco Fighter''
Where are my pants?
Okay, just hang on a second - something l want to talk to you about.
Two things. l don't know about that Ritu .
That girl, she doesn't give me a good feeling.
Yeah, she's my girlfriend -
- only supposed to give me a good feeling.
You 're my witness. l warned him.
Listen, rent's due next week.
- l'd like to pay it on time this month.
- Sure.
Nitin?
Yeah, l'm not paying rent anymore. ldiot.
You 're moving out?
No.
You 're not moving out and you 're not going to pay rent.
How the fuck are you going to manage that?
Check this out.
What the hell is this? lt's a naked man lying on top of a naked woman -
- it's called fucking.
This is Manish, our landlord.
Yeah, the fucking wife-cheater.
And that's Leena.
She's a whore.
No. l thought she was sucking his dick because she's really outgoing -
- but a whore you say, my God.
Bastard, if l wasn't sick, l'd fucking give you one.
How'd you get these?
No, that's the wrong question.
The right question is, are we going to pay rent anymore?
And the answer is?
No. No more rent.
No more fucking rent.
What are you talking about? l'm talking about a small business transaction with our landlord.
He gives us some money and these pictures don't get to his wife.
You 're going to blackmail him? lt's not blackmail. lt's a sign, from God.
Oh, you 're going to blackmail him.
We're living with a criminal. lt's Nitin Sobhraj. l'm just the higher moral authority in Manish's life -
You 're the higher moral authority in his life?
Yes, yes, and l'm asking him to mend his evil ways -
- l'm not a benevolent god.
Don't tell me anymore, right -
- because when the cops come to get you , l don't want to be dragged in as an accessory.
An accessory?
Listen to him using big words.
An earring is an accessory, you choot -
- listen l've been in this business for two years, nobody gets - l'm sorry, you 've been in this business for two years?
Listen, l do all the work -
- you fuckers get to save rent money.
Everybody wins.
And two?
Two? l'm getting married.
Yeah, we know that.
No, getting married next month.
Really, l thought this wasn't happening till like next year.
Yeah, but then l thought, what difference?
Sooner the better.
Right up till the moment they chop his head off, the goat thinks he's going for a walk in the park.
Bastard, you 're just too negative. l hate this attitude.
Listen, this is great news.
Come here, give me a hug.
Great news!
Fucker, l was looking for these -
- your ass is like a solar eclipse, man.
Listen she's too hot, l was going to marry her myself, but you can have her.
She's too sexy, you lucky bastard!
He's moving out.
You 're moving out?
Then why the fuck were you going on about the rent?
Tashi, you really should shave, baby.
HeIIo? Menaka? Yes -
Tashi? Tashi, get back in there! l know where it is -
Okay, should l bring Nitin? l can't believe you !
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, my God, this guy.
Fucking buffoon.
Baby, l've got to go
Look, it's work, l swear l'll make it up to you , okay?
Just go, Tashi, just go.
Thank you .
Do you see her, right behind me?
Don't look, don't look.
What about her?
That's Kanika Tuli. l heard she's a lesbo.
Really? Where'd you hear that?
Oh, you know, here and there.
Considering some of the men l've been with, that doesn't sound half bad.
Oh, come on, don't tell me you 've never thought about being with a woman.
No! Never!
So, did you see Rajeev yet? l think he's around.
Nope.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Do you see her? Don't look.
That's Menaka Vashisht.
She's a lesbo.
Really?
So, what's the story?
Story?
Yeah, you know, you called me, gave me the address, told me to come over -
Yeah, l know - l'm not that drunk. Yet. l didn't say anything about a story, l just gave you the address.
So l came here for nothing?
No, to have a drink, have some fun.
Tashi, stop working. l was in the middle of something -
Couldn't have been that important.
What?
Why'd you pick up the phone then? l'm glad you 're having fun -
- l'll talk to you tomorrow.
When you 're sober.
Tash, come on.
Lover's spat?
Rajeev, l'm not in the mood for your bullshit, okay?
So why don't you just leave?
Make me.
Listen, man - l don't know you , okay?
Do you mind?
Yeah. l mind.
What the fuck?
What's your problem, man?
What did you just say?
What the fuck?
- Come on, say it again!

Let me see that -
- that doesn't look so good. l'm fine. l'm really sorry. l just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
What do you mean, loosen up?
No, l didn't mean it like that - l am loose, okay?
With friends, people who know me -
- people who don't feel the need to drag me half-way across the city -
- in the middle of the fucking night, so l can loosen up.
Don't be an asshole. l apologized. l was just trying to be nice.

- l actually ran away from home to marry him. l fought with my parents.
You know how to pick them.
Sitting here with you . l'm going to get some coffee.

Whatever you do, keep your face covered. l'm assuming there's going to be an explanation at some point?
Yes, of course, but later.
Did you get the money?
Yeah.
Why do we have to give it back?
The guy's an asshole.
This isn't a robbery -
- we're taking back what's ours, returning what's his.
Ours?
Nothing is ours -
- we're just the dumb fucks stuck in the middle!
We should keep the fucking money -
Cow!
You drive, let me do the thinking.
Stop here, stop here.
Why here?
Because, I don't want to puII up at the store In a brIght red car.
Okay, find a spot as close to the store as you can, park there.

Once we're there, just point her out to me. l'll take care of the rest. l think we should just let them go with a warning, right? ls that what the whore-lover thinks? l'll drag all those godless bastards to the station -

And then the three of you .
Either way, l'll get what l want.
You really think your bravery is going to change the world?
You motherfucking -
Man, oh man.
Shit, shit -
Sisterfucker.
You 're pulling a gun on me?
Do you know how long l've been in this business?
What do you think -

Sisterfucker!
Happy anniversary, darling -

So, they are right -

Okay, who the hell were you kissing?
Who were you kissing?
Me.
She was kissing me -

She was kissing you ?
Fuck! lt's well written.
Did you say it's brilliantly written? l said, are you sure they can't trace that fucking car back to us? lt's in my father-in-law's name -
- he reported it stolen, that should cover our asses.
He's not your father-in-law.
Yeah, yeah.
So, Soniya called off the wedding?
No -
- l did.
You called it off?
You called it off?
He called it off?
So you don't mind if l ask
Soniya out to dinner, right?
Dude, what the -
What, she's hot man.

So, you called up that guy -

You 're right.
Actually beta, it should be -
- a bullet hit your bum.
We all are very sorry -
- a bullet hit your bum.
What are you doing?
You 'll break it!
Come on, let's go. l don't have that car anymore.
The magic photo, this -

No.
Goodbye, Tashi.
Sohaya with her latest single -
- l hate you , like l love you -

I hate you , IIke I Iove you ,

Bastard -
- you 're goIng to pay for that.!
Come here, Quero!
Marquitos.
Let's go to swim in the creek.
Come, goat!
Come, all!
Yesterday, the witch went too far.
It isn't painful any longer.
Jump! it's cold but good.
Come on, jump! You haven't touched water during the winter.
So cold!
It isn't cold anymore.
Come on.
Do you think she is looking us?
Who?
Mother.
Of course, she sees everything from up there.
How do you know she is up there?
Father Antonio told me.
Who behaves properly on Earth...
... goes direct to heaven.
Then ...
The witch has it complicated.
Oh, the goats!
Eah!
Quero, Quero!
Boy, come here!
Quero, come here!
Benito!
Back!
Go away, then!
Don't be far from me, Quero.
Release him!
Go away!
Away, away!
Are you OK?
And Lucero?
Let's go home.
What the hell did it happen?
Coming here ...
... wolves have attacked the goats, and ... and killed five of them.
Five?
Damn Satan!
Where did you leave them?
What are we going to eat now, the dog?
We could do nothing.
Don't tell me stories.
I have two useless boys who cannot even take care of goats.
On top, you woke the girl up.
Get lost!
I don't want to see you again!
Away!
Don't hit me!
Father is coming.
Where are the kids?
They should be in hell.
Wolves have killed five goats.
Damn it!
If we don't pay them to the Patroon ...
... we are going away from here.
And where are we going ...
... if we have no place to die?
Look, Juan ...
... Get the money from somewhere, because I don't want to leave.
I can not have more debt.
But are you blind?, we have nothing to eat!
And what the hell can I do?
Take them away ... they became almost adults.
It is clear that they are not yours!
Boy.
Prepare your bag, we are leaving.
Where?
To Patroon's home.
For what?
Stop asking and hurry up.
OK, but Juanillo comes with me.
No way. He stays.
Without Juanillo, I am not going anywhere.
You are leaving now, boy.
So get ready NOW.
Please, Juanillo, don't let them to take me away
Come here.
Come on, boy, get ready.
Damn satan!
Stay away from him now.
NO! I don't want to go without Juanillo!
Let him, asshole!
Don't touch me!
Boy, I don't have the whole day.
Marquitos!
Father, let me go!
Stay still now!
Let me go!
Still, baby!
Juanillo!
Come here!
Marquitos!
Juanillo, run!
Father, Father!
Wait!
Don't stop!
Marquitos!
Run, run!
Marquitos!
Come in.
May I ask your permission,
Don Honesto?
What do you want?
I am bringing you my son.
What is your name, boy?
Marquitos.
I've been informed that you are skilled with goats.
He is very good indeed.
He had grown up among them.
Ceferino.
Ceferino!
Yes, Don Honesto.
Tomorrow morning take this kid to the old man's place.
As you command, my lord.
Careful man! you are going to scratch my boots.
Sorry.
Nothing more, Ceferino, and get my horse ready.
At your feet, Don Honesto.
Then ...
... the issue with the goats was solved, Don Honesto?
By this time, it is OK.
But the next one you are going to the streets.
Is it clear?
Yes, my lord.
Lately, wolves have been very active, and ...
Stop talking of wolves, Pig-mouth ...
... i am doing more than enough alouding you to use the house and the horse.
God keeps you for many years.
And you already know:
Here I am ...
... to serve you.
Father.
Where are you going?
Home.
And me?
Come, jaca, come.
Doroteo!
Let's go closer.
Come on.
Come on.
Doroteo!
But, Doroteo, animal!
What the hell have you done?
Nothing, Don Ceferino.
Venancia was about to deliver, and ...
... I had to receive the baby.
And?
Well ... we are with no money.
Don't complain, there are people worse than you.
One thing, don Ceferino:
If you don't mind, before you go ...
... if you can leave me some wheat breadcrumbs ...
Don't bother me, Doroteo.
What you have to do... is fuck a little less ...
... and work a lot more.
Did u get it?
Let's go.
Pizquilla, leave him.
Hopefully, they will be eaten by wolves in those lonely mountains.
Come on! What do you expect?
Good evening, Don Ceferino.
Good evening, with God.
Why are you so late around here, my sergeant?
Some pigglets have been stolen, at Don Martin's farm ...
... And Balilla is the main suspect.
Have you heard anything?
I don't know, but no worries, if I hear something ...
... I will tell you immedialty.
Perhaps you know that my brother ...
... wanted to finish that asshole?
Besides, Don Martin ...
... is offering a good reward.
How much?
Around 20,000 pesetas.
20,000 pesetas ...
Let's go.
Have a good night and a good service.
With God.
Balilla has become such an asshole.
Have you heard about him?
A bandit.
The biggest motherf... around Despenia-perros.
By the war's end, he escaped into the bush ...
... and since then he lives robbing everyone.
Pray god in order to avoid him.
Look, boy.
The Silence Valley.
There are people who got eggs to live there.
Let's go down.
Come on!
Good afternoon, Don Atanasio.
Life in the countryside keeps you well.
Do you still have the same bloody mood than ever, eh?
Here I leave you a little of wheat, to hold the summer.
Eah, I will be back this fall to take the goats.
And the other sacks?
If you tell me where Balilla hides,
I will give you all of them.
With God.
Ah, and take car of this kid ...
... I brought him to help you with the goats.
Hang it around your neck.
As many goats cross the fence ...
... many beans you put inside the can.
Understood?
If you get more beans ...
...  you are missing goats.
You have to go and find them.
Yes, sir.
Come inside!
Sir, all are here!
Sir?
Go away!
Away!
Who is there?
You sleep there.
Goat!
Come, miner!
Got you!
Come here, miner.
Boy!
Herd them to the corral.
Hey, goat, don't escape!
Be calm, Lunara.
Baby, come here, to here!
Has it been bitten by a snake?
No, it has a broken leg.
Bring me some sticks ...
... a liitle of Gum Rockrose and a bit of flax-leaved daphne.
Calm down, Lunara ...
... for the cork oak's debarking you are going to be jumping already.
Go, Lunara, Lunara...
... be calm.
Hold her from there.
Gum Rockrose is good for hits.
Go, take her to the cave.
Go and bring a little of Rosemary.
Sir, a wolf!
Where?
Out there.
I was eating the rabbit ...
... then the wolf came, and stole it from my hands.
Lucky enough ...
... that you had the rabbit.
Otherwise, it will get you instead.
You have to be really carefull ...
... with lonely wolves.
Go there.
Now.
Throw it.
Be still there.
Come here.
But never loose its face.
Now you know ...
... how do you gain its trust on you.
Before they attack you...
... the move very fast around you ...
... here, next to you...
... several times ...
...and rub you ...
... in order to make you panic.
And when you start running ...
... they jump to your neck ...
... and it's over.
Did they ever do anything to you?
When I just came the first time ...
... they killed some goats.
But then ...
... I was building their trust, and now ...
... they respect me.
How did you do it?
Using the same methods I showed you today:
... giving them food little by little.
Place it well.
And you put him inside the hole.
More! There.
The reason is because here ...
... the thrushes land ...
... in the horsehairs.
The lonely wolf is trying him.
It was a very strange day ...
... when she didn't hit me.
She never loved me.
Neither my brother.
And Dad ...
... never could manage it.
But here with you I am very happy.
Who is there?
There is no danger.
Balilla is here.
Pablito, you have to stay vigilant.
Well, it is as usual:
... Someone stole in Don Samuel's farm ...
... and they killed the guard.
All birds eat wheat, but the guilty one is always the sparrow...
... shameless people.
All the fucking life fighting in the name of Justice ...
... and what for?
To end like this?
We became fugitives.
Four days without sleep.
Yesterday Doroteo told us ...
... that there are fifty
Civil Guards looking for us.
Now, I understand that asshole.
Which one?
Ceferino ...
... he had to give me five sacks of wheat.
And guess what he told me?
That he give me them only if I tell him...
... where were you hidding.
Bastard!
He really hates me!
Since the Contrapartida killed his brother...
... he has been blind and blames us for it.
When I was coming here with Don Ceferino ...
... we met with some Civil Guards.
They were looking for you.
They say that you stole some pigglets from Don Martin's farm.
Damn it!
Then thay asked Don Ceferino ...
... if he had information about your location.
And?
They also told us about a reward ...
... for information.
I will stick my knife very deep on him.
Let's go.
Stay a little bit longer, to rest well, Balilla.
No. The civil guards can show up at any time.
Take it.
Mechote, take this with you.
Go carefully.
Atanasio.
And you?
Me what?
Why do you live alone?
Don't you have family?
Not many
My wife and my childen ...
... were killed during the war.
I was in the bush with the goats ...
... and suddenly, I heard a bomb blast.
I knew something wrong had happen ...
... so I ran towards my town.
When finally I arrived,
I wanted to die.
Only my Tomas survived ...
... the eldest ...
... who went out to fight in the streets.
I lost everything.
Everything the most loved.
Then I came to this place.
And here I am, with my sorrow...
... that keep here inside.
My god ...
... they hunted them!
Boy.
Take the goats down .
I am going to stay here,
I don't feel ...
... well.
Do you want a little bit of milk?
No, no, don't bring me anything.
I am a little apathetic.
Well, see you tonight.
Wolfy!
Wolfy!
Wolfy!
Atanasio!
I had such an experience ...
... you won't believe it!
You are too warm.
Yes.
Get the herb for cold, and boil water with it. Go.
Get well soon ...
... I don't want to leave this place.
Get lost, this is not for you!
Wolfy!
Atanasio!
Atanasio!
Atanasio!
Sir ...
... why did you come up here?
I had too much heat ...
... and here runs a little bit of fresh air.
Are you still in pain?
Yes.
Boy...
... I am leaving.
Where, if you can not even walk?
Far away.
Where I want to go long ago.
Then me too,
I am going with you.
What for?
To be with my mother.
Listen:
... If he has survived ...
... and someday ...
... you meet him ...
Who?
Balilla ...
... don't panic ...
... he is my son ...
... my Tomas.
Take this.
It will protect you.
And don't ever aloud ...
... to extinguish the fire.
Come, miner.
Away!
Away!
Away!
Atanasio!
Atanasio!
Where is the bloody old man?
Caragorda, go up there, and tell me if you see anything.
Atanasio! damn it!
I don't have all day to wait!
Why did you neglect the goats?
Are you playing hide-and-seek with me?
Hey, boss!
Come to see this.
Damn it!
I already knew that you had little time.
Let's go now, do you realise there is no one?
Damn it!
Take the goats out.
You died saying nothing, eh?
- Come here!
- No!
Are you going to tell me where is Balilla hidding, eh?
- Don't touch me!
- Where is he hidding?
- I don't know!
- Tell me or I will urge on you!
The old man was helping him. Wasn't he?
I know nothing.
Damn your life, you are going to tell it.
Let me free!
Let me free!
Let me free!
Damn you, boy!
Let's see who is going to eat who.
I am here, stop shooting.
Don Ceferino, only one went away.
Relax, that one has a fatal wound.
Caragorda, check the horses.
I am going there, boss.
Come, Manuel.
Hurry up.
Let's go.
Wolfy.
Wolfy?
Take, eat a little bit.
Look what I brought you.
You will be cured with this.
You will see it.
Quiet, Wolfy ...
... nothing bad is going to happen to you.
You will feel very good ...
Fly.
I am badly wounded.
Take it.
I have three bullets left.
Stay here.
They will follow my trail.
Search dog, search!
He is there, let's go!
Throw the knife away.
Throw it!
Where is Balilla hidding?
Tell me or I kill you.
Where is Balilla hidding?
Where?!
Foolish Balilla!
Soon, you'll meet with them.
As if it he was eaten by the earth.
How the hell could he escape?
I don't get it.
We have searched everywhere.
Ramirez.
- Yes, my sergeant.
Let's look around the Fraile's creek before dark.
As you wish.
You take care of this feral man.
Don't worry, my Sergeant ...
... before dusk you will have him in the barracks.
Caragorda, go with them.
Manuel.
You and me are going to Doroteo's hut ...
... he knows a lot more than he says.
Come on.
Listen to me, tomorrow morning at the sunrise ...
... grab all your things and your family and get lost from here.
But... why?
Because Don Honesto said so.
But Don Ceferino, in the name of God ...
... I've been here all my life.
My wife and children are buried here.
How you dare to do this?
They are Don Honesto's commands.
But, there is a way for me to help you.
Tell me.
You tell me this fucking time where does Balilla hide.
Don Ceferino
I have told you 1000 times ...
... and I swear by my dead ones, who are buried outside...
... I don't know where Balilla is.
Start packing then, moron.
I know where you'll find him,
Don Ceferino.
Pizquilla go inside, this is not your bussiness.
Where, Pizquilla?
Where the hell?!
Several nights he stays in the One-Eyed's hut.
Where his friends are all buried.
There he is.
Damn it!
Boss, boss!
Do you want me to go with you?
And what the hell do we do with the feral man?
How do you know that he stays in the One-Eyed's hut?
I don't ...
... but tonight there is full moon. and the fog is coming, Father.
Alonso!
Damn her dead ones!
My sergeant!
Where is Don Ceferino?
Don't worry about him, boss.
Caragorda...
... he is already getting drunk in town.
Shut up!
PAPER BIRDS
Late again, Mr. Del Pino.
I'm sorry. I work nights.
- You're late every day.
- Don't worry, it won't happen again.
- Boys, the siren went off.
- Okay, Paco.
Let's go home.
- Hi, Jorge, Maria.
- Hi, Antonio!
- How's your wife?
- Fine, fine!
Come on, Rafa. Go to sleep, you have school tomorrow.
Dad, we're at war!
That's news! I know we are, but you have to go to school.
- Can't I miss tomorrow?
- No way.
You can't miss school and I can't miss work.
That's the deal, man to man.
- "Man to man."
- That's right.
- Hand it over.
- No.
I haven't finished yet.
I can't get it right.
Don't worry, you can practice tomorrow.
Come on, go to sleep.
Rafa, ten lines and lights out.
I'm running out of candles.
All right.
I don't have much time, son.
I just wanted to kiss you good night.
Hey! Did you do your homework?
Why not?
Don't give me that
"we're at war" stuff!
That we're at war!
Rafa, son, I'm about to go onstage.
I'll see you in the morning.
Big kiss.
No, I love you more.
Go on, put your mother on.
Hello.
The crowd is great.
One of the best I've ever seen.
Don't worry, darling. We'll pay it next week, no matter what.
Can you hear me?
Maria! Maria!
- Damn it! It got cut off again!
- We're at war.
Yeah, but these phone lines are more like enemy lines.
- Oh, that's hilarious!
- Come on, we have to go on!
Jesus Christ, take it easy. There are more important things in life.
- Isn't that right?
- Trying to get paid? Is that it?
Did he just say the magic word?
Paid!
Don't give him a cent, he'll blow it.
- Go on, sign.
- 25 pesetas?
More than you're worth.
You know how things are.
- Know what I like about you?
- No. What do you like about me?
- I don't know, I was asking you.
- You're on a roll tonight!
You should do Shakespeare.
- How's the crowd, Luis? Cold?
- Cold? They're dead!
- This isn't Madrid.
- Even Madrid isn't Madrid anymore.
If you really wanna be a hit, repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit...
- Hey, watch it!
- Always messing around!
You're not playing with my dogs anymore!
My neighbor on the third floor,
he's as screwy as a bat.
He must be off his rocker,
yesterday he ran off just like that.
Why all of a sudden screwy?
You've known him your whole life.
Because the fool is so dumb
he ran away with my wife!
Give me a hand, Marilu.
Nobody makes the pain go away
quite like you do.
Last month I went under the knife,
they opened my stomach up wide.
But when they stitched me up,
they left a big sponge inside.
Imagine the discomfort,
it really is a crime.
Discomfort isn't a problem,
I'm just thirsty all the time.
Give me your hand, Marilu.
Nobody makes the pain go away
quite like you do.
- No!
- Montpellier will be exciting!
I'm not going to France!
And much less Montpellier.
Think about rehearsing.
We have to rehearse.
- All right. Meet me at the Hesperides.
- Okay.
- But to rehearse.
- Don't be such a pest!
What do we do about the new number?
Do it right. Goodbye.
- Which way is the subway station?
- This way! This way!
Want it?
It's yours.
Thank you.
Maria!
Maria!
Rafa!
Maria!
Rafa!
Rafa!
Rafa!
No!
MADRID, ONE YEAR LATER
Hello, Enrique. How are you today?
Fine. Can't complain.
Glad to hear it.
Because I can't find the words to express my anger.
Besides, someone might report me.
You okay?
- How about some coffee?
- Yeah, for a change.
Okay, for Cuenca. Two shows.
I need a young variety singer, a tap dancer,
- clarinet, saxophone...
- Alto or tenor sax?
You can castrate him for all I care.
As long as he plays in tune.
- Pick me, Arturo!
- No, you can't, Merceditas.
I'm getting a permit to work as a minor.
You may be young, but you're no variety singer.
Arturo, I haven't worked in a month.
I'll do anything, really.
Even just for a meal...
Well, okay. I'll think it over.
- I can sing.
- Not you again!
Quit bugging me, kid!
Don't tell me, you sing now too?
Darn right I do!
Ever heard of the Peñaranda de Bracamonte Boys Choir?
- Yeah. Have you sung with them?
- No, but I've heard of them, too.
- And I can do magic.
- Scram, kid! And quit bugging me!
Arturo, let him do a trick!
Poor kid...
Okay, show me what you've got.
It works better with a little music.
- Et... voilà!
- Good job!
They saw the trick coming a mile away, kid.
Now get out of here and quit bugging me.
Okay, but you might want this back first.
Thanks.
Go rob people for a living, you'll do just fine.
Plenty of competition out there.
I'm no thief! I'm an artist!
Arturo, with a little practice, this kid could be very good.
And who's gonna teach him? You?
Besides...
Did your folks give you permission?
What's your name?
Miguel Puertas Maldonado.
Where are
Miguel Puertas Maldonado's parents?
In the East Cemetery, Mister Arturo.
Enrique, talk to the boy.
See if you can use him.
Okay, Miguel, have a seat.
You've been hanging around here the last few days.
I met your parents once.
Good people, good artists.
- Can you really sing?
- Some.
- Some?
- Some.
- Can you dance?
- Some.
Can you play an instrument?
And don't say "some."
A little.
I can play a polka on the piano.
- And you sang with Caruso at La Scala.
- Never heard of it.
- Where do you live?
- In a boarding house.
- With my Auntie Isabelita.
- Isabelita Puertas?
No! Not Isabelita Puertas!
She doesn't live with anyone anymore.
She died after the war.
I live with the Cañizares family.
But they wanna get rid of me.
They say I eat enough for two ration cards, and that's bull!
Get this straight, everyone!
A sextet means 6, not 8!
What I need is a new number...
I don't know, with music, comedy...
The usual stuff, but something new!
I've got something.
I've been giving you work for three weeks.
Arturo. Over here.
I've got something.
Though I'm a little rusty.
Hugging me like that'll make your old boyfriends jealous.
Jealous! They know nothing about love, and even less about friendship.
Liar.
What about this new son of yours?
- He's not my son!
- He's not my father!
Maybe we could work the kid into a new routine.
My name's Miguel, sir.
Don't call me "sir."
I'm not exactly a gentleman.
You know what they say about kids.
They steal.
I wasn't stealing, it was a trick!
Nobody here believes me!
Nobody raises their voice to me.
You got that?
Keep quiet or I'll send you back where you came from.
- I didn't do anything!
- Shut up!
Jorge, the kid doesn't seem capable of something like that.
People like kids for being kids, not for their talent.
He'll steal the crowd away from you, you'll see.
My routine is a little out of date.
I'll figure something out.
And with you aboard...
Thank you, sir...
I mean, Enrique! Enrique!
Okay, okay! We have to okay it with your guardian, right?
His name's Antonio, but that isn't necessary.
Keep lying and I'll turn you over to Social Services.
Shut up, kid!
- You came back.
- What did you expect?
Okay, then.
Monday at noon at the Infanta Isabel,
- like a general run through.
- We'll be there.
He won't pay us for the rehearsal.
I know.
Just another dress rehearsal.
You know what? I'm glad certain traditions haven't been lost.
He's going to request asylum the day of his conference at the French embassy.
We'll arrange his escort to the embassy that day.
Well, then.
Any news in the comedy world?
I was at the Hesperides this morning.
The Rivas' are touring Valencia and nobody's heard from Torres Vidal.
Stay a couple more weeks and don't take any shows out of town.
You're dismissed.
Colonel,
Jorge Del Pino has reappeared.
Del Pino?
So he's still alive.
Fine, you're dismissed.
See you next week.
I've been looking for you all morning!
I should've taken you to Social Services! Never again!
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- None of your business!
- Let's go! Get up or I'll drag you!
- I don't want to!
You don't want to! Don't you talk back to me! Goddamn it!
- Don't even think about it.
- Get moving! Let's go!
No! I don't want to!
I won't go! I don't want to!
Are you this boy's guardian?
Yes.
Do you have his papers?
Come on, show me his papers.
Show me his papers!
Get out of here!
I was gonna hand him in to Social Services anyway.
So we're even.
Thank you.
You froze up.
Like a Popsicle.
This is looking really good.
- Where did you learn that?
- Where did you learn how to sew?
Pour some more wine. You won't be keeping the bottle or the cork.
Are you gonna tell me where the hell you've been all this time?
I already told you. Around.
You disappear for a year without a word,
I had no idea where you sleep at night...
Wherever the night catches me.
Pass me the corkscrew.
There's more wine?
No, to pull the words out of you.
Jesus Christ!
- I don't feel much like talking.
- Yeah, I can see that.
Okay, it's all set.
Miguel Puertas Maldonado is now officially a minor in your charge, according to the Government's new law.
- It looks genuine.
- It is genuine!
Thank you, sir. For the stamp.
Holy cow! We have another Picasso here and we didn't even know it!
Thank you.
So, have I earned some of that stew or not?
There's enough for three.
If there isn't enough for me, it's okay.
I said there's enough for three.
I see you're still eating
Resistance food.
I can't resist it any longer.
Enrique, sir, these lentils sure are tasty.
- I told you not to call me "sir"!
- "Ma'am" would be better.
What? Hey, if you make fun of me, you get no dessert.
- What's for dessert?
- Oranges.
- Yeah. From China.
- Really?
Yeah. For you, at least.
He gets the peel.
- Liar.
- Mooch.
- Isn't everybody?
- Not everybody.
Miguel, get your elbow off the table!
Miguel, for God's sake!
Knock it off!
Where did you get this?
Get moving!
- But...
- Now!
- He tried to steal a banana!
- No, I didn't!
Kids and dogs, you knew that!
You asked for it.
- That's not true! You're saying...
- Shut your mouth.
- I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.
- Why won't you help me?
- No kids.
Just no.
Will you let me breathe?!
Give me a cigarette.
Hey, isn't that Merceditas?
- My bag.
- Hold on.
What are you doing here?
Where are you living now?
In a boarding house in Vallecas.
Until they kick us out.
This isn't for you, Merceditas.
Come by the theater on Monday.
- Arturo said there was nothing for me.
- Come by anyway, don't worry.
Now, go home.
Thank you.
Go on, you go home too.
- Did you get anything?
- Yes.
Just potatoes.
What about you?
- Move. I've got a pimple here, look.
- Enrique, did you perform with him?
- Yeah.
- And where are you? I can't see you.
- That was me.
- You were..."and many other?"
Yeah. I was "And many other incredibly talented, highly-renowned performers".
- Come in!
- Good evening, Enrique.
- Good evening.
- I'm sorry, but this can't go on.
Three people are living here and you're only paying for one.
Ah! I have something for you.
Good evening.
I promised you one, right?
- When are you going on tour?
- Well, it may be a couple more nights.
- Three, four at the most.
- No, that's too long.
- And with the boy as well...
- My name's Miguel, ma'am.
He looks like a good boy, but you can only stay one more night.
- No, please, lady! Don't hit me!
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to be hit anymore!
- No, dear child...
- The kid's good. Did you see that?
- Yeah.
We don't do that sort of thing here.
Calm down.
Miguel, please, get up.
You can stay.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thank you, ma'am.
And come with me.
I'll get you something to eat.
- Do you like cheese?
- Yes.
The colonel worries when people like him turn up.
Thank you.
- Remember the attempt on Franco?
- I heard about it.
There were plenty of rumors, but they were never confirmed.
Red, please.
Well, it happened.
And one of the names that came up was Jorge Del Pino, a comedian.
A comedian?
I can't believe we have to worry about people like this.
The enemy can be anyone.
By the way, how is your juggling?
Juggling?
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
I won't ask you to do anything you've never done.
The colonel ordered me to get you into Del Pino's company
- so you can keep me informed.
- Why not just arrest him?
No, no. Let the flock come together.
There's plenty of time to send in the wolves.
- Enrique.
- What?
The kid, he's crying.
Miguel,
- what are you doing?
- He said we had to rehearse.
- Who did?
- Jorge.
Come on, you can rehearse tomorrow.
- Now go to sleep.
- Good night.
Good night.
And put out that candle before it runs out.
Okay, in a second.
Good night.
How are you today, my dear Sancho?
Very well, thank you.
I'd like to play a little something.
Then sing!
That's Señor Wences' number.
Hey, that's Wences' number!
I know it's Wences' number.
I'm just trying it out.
Besides, he said I could use it before he went to America.
You people are getting on my nerves!
What's wrong, Jorge?
You've been avoiding me all day.
I've been working all day.
You know what I mean.
The fight must go on...
- Not for me.
- Sure.
But I'll let you know if there's a meeting.
Then you can do whatever you want.
- Enough already...
- Okay then.
Amparo, he was about to pee backstage.
Thank you, Pastor.
- Bad dog!
- Very naughty.
- Right, Miguel, come here.
- I'm ready.
No, not like that. Let me see.
Pretend you're a dummy.
Good, but not too limp.
Okay, on three, right?
One, two... and three.
Very good.
No, no. Put your hand here, Miguel.
- Why can't I put it here?
- Because! Your hand goes here.
- Here.
- Miguel!
Can I have a little silence, please?
- Can you hear me, Dummy?
- Yes.
Don't say "yes,"just nod your head.
Can you do that?
- Yes.
- Don't say "yes."
- Don't say "yes."
- Dummy!
- No! I mean "yes"!
- No, Miguel!
- One time and then you keep quiet.
- Why only one time?
The other dummies have more lines.
It's not fair!
The other dummies have toured with me for years.
- You got that?
- Yes.
- Damn it!
- But Enrique! I made one mistake!
Hey, Enrique!
And you shut up, kid!
Nice kid, but he talks too much.
- Bring me the kid's papers.
- Okay, right.
There's nothing to worry about,
Captain.
I would never hire someone without their papers in order.
Isn't that right, Jorge?
I got sent back to Madrid once because my ID was unreadable.
They made me cross enemy lines right in the middle of the war!
- Which enemy lines did you cross?
- As many as I could!
There were so many
I can't even remember.
It was so dark you couldn't even see the enemy.
Because I crossed them at night!
- Save the comedy for the theater.
- This is a theater.
You're talking to a superior.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a comedian.
And since this is a theater,
I'm on hallowed ground.
Are you comparing this place to a church?
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- We didn't come here to argue.
Here it is, I found it!
I was afraid it would get lost so I hid it somewhere and I couldn't...
"Miguel Puertas Maldonado..."
Age?
Nine.
- Date of birth?
- Yes, yes.
September 20th.
Yes, that's it, the 20th.
And your parents didn't object?
They allow you to participate in these activities?
- Can you at least say yes or no?
- Jesus, answer him, Miguel.
Jesus is in Heaven.
And I'm standing right here!
Answer me right now!
Yes! Yes!
My parents didn't say anything because they want what's best for me.
And I know how to do lots of stuff.
Wanna hear me play a polka on the piano?
You may proceed.
- Thank you, Arturo.
- You're welcome, Captain.
I can't believe how much time they make me waste with all this!
You took care of the boy's papers, right? Well done, Jorge.
I missed having somebody around to help me while you were...
- By the way, where were you?
- Excuse me. Jorge told me to come.
Honestly, I can't, Merceditas.
I can't afford it.
I'll do anything you ask of me:
Sing, slapstick, the Chinese Shadows number... Anything you say!
Don't be a scrooge!
"Don't be a scrooge."
Damn it, this isn't Social Services.
You're 16 years old.
- Another minor.
- Not anymore. I'm of age now.
You put my last name on it!
Too bad you can't forge a paella.
Arturillo, darling!
Where am I on the program?
Rocio, don't worry, I got it covered.
Well, I'll be in my dressing room until you call me.
Don't worry.
Rocio, did you get your?
You mean my washbowl?
Yes, they brought it in.
Thank you so much, Jorge, darling.
My skin is very sensitive.
- From top to bottom.
- That's right. So what?
The sensitivity of a true artist can manifest itself in many ways, even on the skin itself.
You can say that again...
Well, that's variety singers for you.
That's hemorrhoids for you!
They swell up like apricots!
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your new dance,
I'll dance it just like you.
I want you to show me,
and to learn the Babaloo.
Show it to me, show it to me,
I'll dance it just like you.
To dance the Babaloo
glide gently on your feet.
Move your hips just right,
your heart will follow the beat.
Rumba dancers do it great
by always stepping in threes.
They rock their hips back and forth
and cross their legs with ease.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your Babaloo...
Show me your new dance,
I'll dance it just like you.
You finish your make-up.
I'm going to warm up.
- Why do you do that?
- For my eyes.
So everyone in the audience can see my eyes.
Jorge! You're late, the Pizarros are already on.
Don't worry,
I'm on after the magician.
- No, the magician is on last.
- You're kidding.
Goddammit.
If you really wanna be a hit, repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Shit!
- Hey, watch it!
Why did he do that?
For good luck.
What did your parents do?
- My parents didn't do that stuff.
- They didn't?
They didn't like me saying things that bring bad luck, like...
Don't even think about it!
After Jorge, Rocio is on and then we sing "A Swig of Wine."
Don't budge from here.
If you really wanna be a hit, repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Pastor, when we've finished the number, bring the sign up slowly.
- Jorge! We have to talk.
- I can't right now. I have to go on.
- Just a minute! It's very important.
- Don't forget!
Let's go.
- Gentlemen, I opine...
...that a swig of wine...
... helps you sing.
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
- Gentlemen, I opine...
...that a swig of wine...
... helps you forget.
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
White wine and red
keep the Reaper away...
For pennies a day.
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
Gentlemen, I opine...
... that a swig of wine
... is the whole point of life.
More and more booze, less and less money.
Very good.
Why do I only get to sing one line?
You need practice!
Your tongue is like a brillo pad.
"No money, no booze.
More booze, less money."
Are you gonna paint that mole on your face every night?
Yes! It's just like the one my mother had!
I'm an artist, a lady, and many even consider me to be quite respectable.
I never discuss my hemorrhoids, not even to the monks.
And sometimes they're as big as sausages.
Feel free to talk about your sausages,
Rocio. You are from Burgos, after all.
Jorge, this is very serious!
I need a bigger washbowl.
There's only one thing as important as top billing, and that's the size of my washbowl.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
Oh, Jorge.
Pain is such an awful thing...
Mine is chronic, intimate and impossible to cure.
- But yours...
- No, mine is different, Rocio.
I know.
But you listen to me.
Trying to ease it is well worth the effort.
If only there were a washbowl for that.
You'll have to find it.
Good show, yes indeed.
I liked it.
Here.
Wait.
Here they are.
Rocio Molina Santander.
Rocio Moliner!
- From Burgos.
- Yes, from Gamonal de Riopico.
- My mother was from there...
- Let us sing to Burgos,
blessed treasure...
... which Spain reveres
with deep emotion.
Miguel.
That's enough for today.
I imagine you all want to leave.
You have 3 shows tomorrow, right?
Yes. Matinee, afternoon and evening.
Company, dismissed!
Del Pino, Corgo, Pastor and Ostense!
Will you come with me for a moment, please?
You too!
Me?
Yes, you, the trumpet player.
Form a semi-circle and show me your papers.
I know all about you and I don't like you one bit.
I don't like what you've been and I don't like who you are.
That's funny,
I know nothing about you and I like you even less.
Don't mess with me, Del Pino, or I'll make you disappear.
Lieutenant...
Forgive him, he's a little impulsive.
I wanted to speak to you alone.
Pedro Ostense... You've worked as a stagehand on a lot of shows.
Yes, for meals.
Of course. I only ask that from now on, be more... careful. Do you see the Lledo brothers very often?
No, I haven't seen them for some time.
Well, keep it that way, all right?
They're bad news.
Jorge, I haven't heard anything about you in over a year, no one's seen you perform...
How did you manage?
I got by.
- Like everybody else.
- Like those of us who could.
Luckily the others haven't had to deal with problems like yours.
Did you vanish too, or are you new?
I can't quite place you.
I'm a carpenter by trade but this is my first job in the theater.
Then get to work, stay out of trouble and careful who you hang out with.
You like theater, you like music, you like musicians...
I know your tastes.
What you do behind closed doors is of no interest to me.
- You make me sick.
- What's that, Lieutenant?
"Valentin Fernandez Alba, born on June 1st, 1916 in Palomera, Province of Cuenca."
Never been there. Is it pretty?
It's a beautiful place, Captain.
I go back every chance I get.
Is that right,
Valentin Fernandez Alba?
- Yes.
- You think I'm an idiot, do you?
No, sir.
I'm not an idiot,
Valentin Jurado Menendez.
And I'm not the one who was at a meeting in Ocaña and who's mixed up in something brewing that I don't like at all!
It was you and not just you.
Who else is with you?
There is evidence of your presence at that meeting and I want to know who else here knows about it!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know what I'm talking about?
If there's one thing I can't stand it's a sheep.
And a wolf in sheep's clothing, even less.
No one plays with me... unless I want them to.
Take him away.
Where were you all?
I was looking for you.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing, Sergeant.
- "Captain", Miguel.
He's a captain.
Don't be scared. Why are you scared?
I'm going to show you a trick.
See this coin?
It's one of the new coins, huh?
Let me see, here we go...
Nothing here...
Nothing there... Where is it?
Want me to show you a trick now?
Go on, time for bed. It's late.
Bed? What about supper?
Get going.
We're not having supper?
Okay.
Why all the questions?
Why us?
Where have they taken poor Valentin?
You know where. They've been picking on us since the war ended.
Yeah, but I thought they'd calmed down.
Do you think it's because of Pedro, or because of me?
- You think it's because of me.
- No, no.
- But we've got to leave.
- Yes. Where to?
I've got friends in Argentina,
Venezuela, Cuba...
Don't start talking about your friends. Don't talk nonsense.
Why not?
You can't think like that because of every idiot comes along.
Those idiots showed us their fangs today and I don't like it, Jorge.
I don't like it.
And tomorrow or the next day there'll be another, then another... and another.
Jorge, it's time to leave all this.
Is this how you want to live?
I've got nothing tying me down here.
Nothing.
You're scared.
Yeah. So what?
- Well, I'm not.
- I don't care.
No thing's tying you down either.
And your wife...
What the hell do you know?!
Obviously nothing!
Because I can't get a word out of you!
- What do you want to know?
- Leave me alone!
Nice job. Avery good rehearsal,
I think...
- we can stop there.
- Yeah.
Were you fighting about work?
Something like that.
It's okay, go back to sleep.
- No, no. I'd rather have supper first.
- Me too.
- Let's see what we've got.
- I'm hungry.
So are we.
Is anybody in this shithole gonna serve us?
That depends.
Did you bring any money along?
- Not a penny.
- Then quit bothering me. Beat it!
But first give me a hug, you poor schmuck!
Damn, it's good to see you.
And who's this big kid?
I can't believe it.
How you've grown, little Rafa!
I can't call you little Rafa anymore!
He sure is a Del Pino, eh?
I'm not Rafa. I'm Miguel.
He's not Rafa.
It's just... I'm sorry.
- Have you got a bathroom?
- Yeah, kid. In there.
I'm going to the bathroom.
He wants to do a number with him.
I don't want kids, but here I am.
He's a Puertas.
Do you remember them?
Yes.
- We've gotta go.
- Hold on a second.
- No, we have to go.
- Wait! I'm talking to Marcelino!
Don't ever let me catch you stealing again!
I didn't want to.
The rice was pouring out, it looked at me, our eyes met...
What could I do? It was calling me...
That's enough! You want me to turn you over to Social Services?
Then you'd better quit stealing or I'll cut off your hand.
I didn't steal it, I made it.
Why did that man call me Rafa?
Do I look like Rafa?
You don't look like Rafa and never say his name again!
Get up!
You look a bit sad, my dear Sancho.
My job was all I had in life,
and I lost it.
Hey, do you know about what they're planning?
Who? Another uprising?
No, no, no. Something bigger.
Against who?
- You know, don't you?
- No, no, I know what we all know.
But please, if you hear anything, don't keep it to yourself, eh?
If I hear anything? Quit bugging me with this stuff, Pedro!
Do you remember Father Gabriel?
- Father Gabriel? Yes.
- He sends his greetings.
And this.
I'll let you know if something comes up. Now that you're...
- of age.
- And she has your last name too.
Thanks, Arturo, you're so good.
Thank you.
Did you hear that?
"Arturo, you're so good."
Though something about that sentence doesn't sound right.
Oh, Arturo, you're so good.
Poor Merceditas.
- When she finds out the truth...
- You need money?
- No, I'm fine.
- Then you can spare some.
Never!
How much will you pay us?
Relax.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I owe a friend a favor, the Mayor of Alberche del Marqués.
I can't take care of it, but you can.
You have to make me look like... like a king.
Like a king? Damn!
Well, like a dictator.
You can take part of my company if you like.
But prepare something worthy of Arturo del Val.
Wouldn't you prefer something good?
Oh, you're a riot!
Tell me what to do and how much you want for setting it up.
Nothing, Jorge, please.
- What do you mean?
- You know him.
I won't ask you for a single penny.
Just tell me how much you're willing to pay.
Sorry, the coffee made me...
Here.
The shows I owed you for.
We'll talk about the rest of it later.
There'll be more.
Oh, Arturo, "you're so good."
Thanks a lot.
Where would we be without people like you?
"Arturo, you're so good."
Hey, Enrique.
Give me back the fan I lent you.
I gave it back to you half an hour ago, Rocio.
Hey! The bus!
Stop the bus!
What?
Isn't somebody picking us up?
Oh, for God's sake!
Can't you avoid these potholes?
- She's got hemorroids.
- Who, the mule?
Chusa, watch where you're going, the lady's got hemorroids!
For you,
I'd count the sand in the sea.
For you...
... willing to kill I'd be.
Would someone really do that?
Killing doesn't take much encouragement.
God strike me down
if l'm lyin'.
No, he says he could count the sand in the sea. You can't.
- How do you do that?
- Piece of cake.
"A totalitarian state will harmonize the operation in Spain of all the country's activities and energies which, within the framework of national unity, work being considered as one of the most unavoidable of duties, would be the only exponent of the popular outcry."
Amen!
Didn't Franco say that?
Harpo Marx.
That jerk promised it would be full.
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah. I put it away.
- Lieutenant. May I speak with you?
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.
Did Montero send you?
- Yes.
- Come on, Quiroga...
What's wrong, Pastor, don't you like dames?
Good evening, everyone!
You, in the orchestra!
Can you stop playing for a moment!?
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop for a moment!
Thank you very much, very kind.
Pedigree artists.
The most talented of all...
Who's talking?
The mayor.
Antonio, please, lights!
Well, as mayor, and before opening this performance which I arranged as a tribute to our people...
Stop it! Sit down! Stop!
...our community and especially to our beloved deceased
Marquis, may he rest in peace...
Children! Stop it!
I'm trying to give a speech!
Thank you so much, thank you.
Well...
What... What I wanted to say is that... Children!
Will you sit down already!
Your father is speaking!
It's gone... It's gone!
I forgot what I was going to say!
You brats!
Let the show begin.
Thank you very much.
Where are they?
I can't go on!
- What do you mean?
- Not without my glasses.
What do I do?
Should I say something?
No!
- Get on your unicycle right now!
- I can't! I can't!
Get on that unicycle!
- Pizarro!
- Let's go!
- I can't!
- Just get out there!
He killed himself.
Has anybody seen the unicyclist?
You see, we've lost him and can't find him.
Or the unicycle, and that would be a great loss. It's a family heirloom.
My great-grandfather gave it to my grandfather, my grandfather gave it to my father and my father sold it to me.
- Come on, we're on.
- But we haven't rehearsed it.
Then we'll rehearse it now with an audience!
It's a beautiful number, very romantic,
vivace, allegro ma non troppo,
ritenuto, sostenuto,
linguini al pesto, equipped with two bedrooms, kitchen, and a bathroom, entitled:
"How do you expect me to miss you if you don't leave."
Maestro!
As well as enjoying the performance, especially your number,
Don Ricardo wanted to meet you in person.
What an honor!
Mayor, Rocio Moliner.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
Don Ricardo Ubieto,
Mayor of Alberche del Marqués, widower, father of two boys, native of Esteiro and adoptive son of this blessed town, which took me in 25 years ago.
But you can just call me Mayor.
Let's immortalize this moment.
I'll have it framed.
Manolo... Thank you.
Stand together, please.
Smile.
Thank you very much.
You were sublime tonight.
I would be delighted...
I'm sorry, I mean, we'd all be delighted if you sang another song from your repertoire.
I never accept, Ricardo...
May I call you Ricardo?
Of course, Rocio. Of course.
Well, I never accept requests of this kind, and much less offstage.
But coming from your Excellency...
Oh, I'm sorry.
...from you,
I'll sing all night... if I have to.
Sebastian, please, "The Brazier".
This is for you, Ricardo.
When you're gone
my senses freeze over
and the distance
chills my heart.
I feel sad,
all alone and blue.
I live in an igloo
when we're apart.
The sky begins to sob
and all along my rooftop
gather white teardrops
that chill me from above.
When you're far away
no heat can get in.
My life is a sin
without your love.
Light my brazier, darling.
I can feel the cold in my spine.
Light my brazier
or I'll call for the coal man.
He heats it up just fine.
The fire that fuels my passion
is like lava from a volcano.
It's too cold in here,
light my brazier,
hotter than ever before...
Lieutenant.
Is Madrid too boring, or are we so good you had to come and see us?
I prefer another type of theater, a little more refined.
Now... what I do enjoy is admiring this woman's beauty.
A little young for you.
She's no longer a minor.
Light my brazier, darling.
I can feel the cold in my spine.
Light my brazier
or I'll call for the coal man.
He heats it up just fine.
The fire that feeds my passion
is like lava from a volcano.
It's too cold in here,
light my brazier,
hotter than ever...
before.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I haven't felt like this in a long time.
Madam, you have re-ignited something...
- inside of me.
- Oh, Ricardo.
Don't be so formal.
If you wanted, we could be friends.
Almost all my friends are dead,
Lieutenant.
And I don't feel like making new ones.
Jorge!
Jorge! Where's Jorge?
Ah, Jorge!
Why don't you play us something on the... accordion?
That...
- The trikitixa.
- Yes, that little accordion.
It's adorable.
It's very late, Mayor, and we have another show tomorrow.
By the way, we have a film as well.
Thanks to a friend from Madrid we're showing the latest newsreel with images of our beloved Franco.
It's very moving.
How interesting. Do you see him crying after the firing squads?
Jorge...
A funny thing happens with age.
You lose certain faculties and your hearing goes...
Just as well...
Come on, how about a little music before we hit the sack?
We'd better be going. Good night.
Miguel! Miguel!
Now that we're alone, let's sit down
- and have a drink.
- Whatever you say.
What was that all about?
The truth is, I don't understand you.
If you wanna die, why do this for a living?
- What are you talking about?
- You act suicidal at times.
What's worse, you endanger the people who love you.
- And who loves me?
- I do, for example.
Me too.
Hey, you either sleep or walk.
And stay out of adult conversations.
I haven't done anything wrong.
He didn't have to treat us like that.
- He's the one who paid us, Jorge!
- That doesn't mean he owns us.
Always the same, always on the defensive.
Haven't you suffered enough already?
Why keep testing everyone?
If being around me bothers you so much, I'll leave in the morning.
I was only joking, I was testing you.
- Screw you!
- Don't talk like that in front of me.
- Jorge! Jorge!
- What's wrong?
- We've been robbed.
- What do you mean, robbed?
Be quiet!
Mayor, the box office earnings have disappeared.
Luis' dogs are gone, the trunks, tools, clothing, all of it.
- Things are missing from my trunk...
- Let me speak a moment.
The thief can't be anyone from Alberche.
These things don't happen here.
That's what he said after the last robbery.
Whoever it was is long gone by now.
The bird has flown the coop.
Everybody keep your chins up.
We'll ask the mayor for new dogs.
You'll see, he'll listen to me.
Don't worry, son.
Yes! We'll get the cages now and go talk to him.
Okay... Silence, please! Look, the mayor of Castelar de la Vega is a good friend of mine and he owes me a favor, so I'll call him first thing in the morning to tell him to hire you this weekend.
I can't promise a big take, but it's better than nothing, right?
And what do we do in the meantime?
Frankly, I don't know what else I can do.
For God's sake, Ricardo.
Don't be so modest. Beds.
Well, if you want you can sleep here.
And food.
We'll see what we can do about meals.
In that case, Mr. Mayor, we'll do the show.
Remember, you're all invited to stay for the newsreel.
We'll start first thing tomorrow afternoon. Check what's missing...
- We can go whenever you're ready.
- Yes, darling.
I still owe you a song.
Then let's go.
Have they gone?
- Has the film started?
- No, not yet.
You have time to get dressed and put on your makeup. Let's go.
Local bus service
is back up and running
in the streets of Madrid.
60,000 blue shirts from Huelva
and the surrounding province,
filled with patriotic
and Falangist fervor...
- When does the little comedian appear?
- Which one?
- The one with the little mustache.
- There he is.
- He's in all the newsreels.
- He means Chaplin.
Why are you clapping?
You said to clap whenever the audience claps,
- to encourage them.
- He's right.
Look, he's saluting with his left!
He's turned Socialist!
... about Spain's unity,
freedom and greatness.
And the true purpose
of the Spanish people
can manifest itself
through its nat... bodies
like the fam...
the muni... ity...
and the corpor...
to ful...
our supreme ideal of...
Simply put, the s...
fertilizing the harvest
which will...
Jorge,
I should hire this guy for the magic act.
I'd make him vanish into thin air.
For good.
I don't mind, but you should be more careful what you say.
Relax, Pastor, it's okay.
My mother! That's my mother!
- Your mother?
- Yes, that's her! Right there!
I thought your parents died.
That's what they told me, but look,
I saw the beauty mark!
Didn't his parents sign a release so he could work?
Jorge forged it.
Jorge, please, tell them to play the newsreel again!
Okay, we'll talk to them later.
We can't now.
But you will, right?
Yes.
You promise?
I promise.
You don't believe me?
I'll go and get a photo so you can see it was my mother.
- Could it be true?
- How should I know?
Who knows how old these images are?
They could be 3 years old, or a week.
What about you?
Forging papers, for God's sake!
Just like the good old days, huh?
How about that! The guy has guts.
Nothing scares him.
- Who knows what he's really up to!
- Shut your mouth.
What are you thinking?
Miguel, I asked you a question.
Is it what you saw in the film?
What do you want to know?
Do you think my mother might be alive, or is everything we see on the newsreel a lie,
- like Pedro says?
- No.
Pay no attention to Pedro, he has a big mouth.
But you'll see. We'll find out.
You promise?
I promise.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your new dance,
I'll dance it just like you.
I want you to show me,
and to learn the Babaloo.
Show it to me, show it to me,
I'll dance it just like you.
To dance the Babaloo
glide gently on your feet.
Move your hips just right,
your heart will follow the beat.
Rumba dancers do it great
by always stepping in threes.
They rock their hips back and forth
and cross their legs with ease.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your Babaloo.
Show me your new dance,
I'll dance it just like you.
I want you to show me,
and to learn the Babaloo.
Show it to me, show it to me,
I'll dance it just like you.
- Want one?
- Yeah.
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes, yes.
That was my final performance.
It's better this way and you know it.
You don't get too many second chances at my age.
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- As long as he stays one...
Thanks for thinking of me.
I love you, Moliner.
Will you be okay without me?
We'll be fine.
Well, you could have said no.
He means we'll be fine, but it won't be the same.
Rocio!
Are you taking this with you?
Keep it as a souvenir.
I don't need it anymore.
- Love cures even hemorrhoids!
- It's not that.
Ricardo promised to buy me a new one.
Gold plated.
That's money for you. It's no cure, but it sure eases the pain.
In times like these, any relief you can get...
Well, since we'll never see each other again,
I guess I'm supposed to make some big farewell speech worthy of a great stage actress like myself.
That's not necessary, Rocio.
- Between us, there's no need.
- Very well.
Then I bid you farewell with a painful... to hell with you!
- What did you say, darling?
- No...
Yes, yes.
Tell them about your friend.
Ah! Yes, of course.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
The mayor of Castelar de la Vega offered his theater.
You can sleep in the dressing rooms.
- Ready to go, darling?
- The photo.
Ah, that's right, the photo, yes.
Well, this is a souvenir of your stay in Alberche.
- Very nice. Thank you.
- God be with you.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye, Moliner!
Excuse me, Jorge. I have to go to Madrid tomorrow for family reasons,
- but I'll be back tomorrow night.
- Do you have money for the trip?
Yeah. Thanks.
I told the man in the booth to play the part you said.
- But don't get your hopes up, okay?
- Jorge, my mother's alive,
- I saw her.
- In a film, do you understand?
- In a film!
- No, I saw her there.
The speaker said it was in Almagro.
What you saw on the newsreel doesn't mean a thing.
Why not? It's my mother.
Why won't anyone believe me?
Look at me. I believe you.
Look, that's her, it's her!
- Who? The woman with the bread?
- Yes! That's her!
I can't see...
It might not be her.
It is her! Look!
She's got the beauty mark!
- You see it?
- It's just a coincidence.
Sir, put my mother on again!
Please, sir!
Put her on again, here on the screen!
- Too bumpy to draw?
- If I make the drawing big enough, it'll be easier to find her, right?
Yes.
If you give me a photo of Maria and Rafa,
I can make you a drawing so that you can look for them too.
That's not necessary.
Why not?
Look what happened with my mother.
I thought she was dead and look...
Don't get your hopes up.
We might not find anything.
The newsreel man said she was in Almagro.
The newsreel man says what he's ordered to say.
If you don't wanna help me,
I don't care.
General Franco will be going to Caceres in 4 days to meet with high-ranking officers.
He has entrusted me with the logistics and entertainment.
Is your company to be trusted?
What? To perform for the Generalísimo?
Yes. Any problem?
No. But there are little things, remarks they make.
I'd never been around performers.
They say such disrespectful things about the general
- I have to hold myself back.
- We live in difficult times.
People need to let off steam.
As long as it's only little things...
I still haven't figured out Del Pino.
And I don't like Pedro, the other stagehand, one bit.
Pedro... Ostense. Yes, the stagehand.
What have you found out?
I hear all kinds of things.
He's constantly whispering with Del Pino and other members of the company.
- Somebody should be tailing him.
- Lieutenant, what are you saying?
You need a regiment now to follow a few comedians?
- Is this mission too much for you?
- No, Captain.
But can't they hire another company?
Don't piss me off.
I've got enough on my plate here.
Go back to your comedians and have fun.
Don't worry,
I'll help you get them there.
We're going to make sure this show makes us look good.
- Understood?
- Yes, Captain.
And now I'm going to perform a number of mine, composed by Giacomo Puccini, called "Goodbye Life".
- Goodbye, good day.
- Goodbye, good day, my good man.
- And what do I do in this number?
- Stay out of the way.
Why?
I want to play the trikitixa in this.
Let us rehearse, we don't have much time.
We put the two jokes in here, the one about the arm and then we kick off. Come on.
I might be starving, but my soup turned out pretty tasty.
Is there anything more delicious than garlic soup?
Yeah, hot garlic soup.
- Don't slurp your soup.
- It tastes better like that.
Yeah, but don't slurp it.
The guards showed up again this morning asking for papers.
- Miguel!
- I forgot!
Jorge, we have to go.
Don't start.
Go where?
Nowhere.
Are you gonna eat cold garlic soup your whole life?
- There's no future here.
- If you want to leave, go ahead.
I can't go on like this.
Begging for work, begging for food...
Look at us.
We share mattresses, nightmares...
- I'd like to see the sea.
- Let's go to America.
- America?
- Really?
Yeah, the four of us.
Buenos Aires, Jorge.
- Buenos Aires is wonderful.
- Have you been there?
No, but I heard all about it.
Well, that's what people say.
Could we take my mother?
If we find her, I mean.
Sure we can.
Miguel de Molina?
No, Jorge Del Pino.
You got the wrong dressing room.
And theater, Lieutenant.
I bring you a message from Captain Montero.
You will be given the honor of performing for the Generalísimo.
I'll pick you up the day after tomorrow.
Merceditas...
Okay. We'll think it over.
No, you don't get it.
We're the ones who do the thinking.
You people stick to your usual stupidity, nothing else.
- Hey, Jorge, is it true what I heard?
- What did you hear?
That we're performing for...
Well, you know who.
I'd gladly put a couple bullets in him.
If I ever got the chance.
I don't give a damn about what you would or wouldn't do!
What are you doing? We're working!
If he comes to the theater, we won't get another chance.
We'll be left without any options.
Would you rather die... or be killed?
- I'd rather not be asked.
- Come on...
No matter how hard you try not to, you always end up taking a stand.
Bullshit.
A big hand for Mercedes del Val and her wonderful dancing!
But aren't there two numbers to go?
- Where is he going?
- He didn't say "shit" seven times!
Shit, shit, shit...
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
Life isn't easy, is it, mon ami?
Oh, bien sur, bien sur, Monsieur!
No food, no justice, in this country there is no freedom.
Bien sur, bien sur, Monsieur!
- I'm going to sing the other lyrics.
- Très bad idea, Monsieur!
It's not easy living in this country.
Isn't that right, mon ami?
And even harder if you sing the other lyrics!
A friend of mine said to me:
"Did you know the Generalísimo is getting older?"
"Great, at least he's finally doing something!"
Oh well, my friend, c'est la vie.
Money's worth an all-time low.
Wanna buy a pineapple in Madrid?
Prepare yourself for quite a blow.
Nothing to buy, nothing to spend.
Prices as high as they go.
Can't breathe in,
can't breathe out.
I sure could live without Franco.
Oh well, my friend,
life passed away.
Can't even pick the shirt I wear.
My navy blue one faded gray.
I put it on and die of laughter.
I wear it everywhere, even to bed.
It brings tears to my eyes,
you know.
If only I could dye it red.
I sure could live without Franco.
- That was quite a number.
- Did you like it?
I didn't see it, but I hear nobody laughed.
They've lost their sense of humor.
What's your problem?
Are you cold or trembling with fear?
I'm telling you for your own good.
Don't play with fire.
Stick to your job and nobody will bother you, I can guarantee it.
Then tell your lieutenant, the Falangist, to stop busting my chops.
Haven't you suffered enough?
Go back to your people.
I'll see you in Caceres.
Wait.
I hear the boy thinks he saw his mother.
Who told you that?
I'm the government,
I know everything.
This is where to look.
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Captain, I still have some questions for Corgo.
- Then I'm staying.
- No, you're leaving.
Del Pino... What did I tell you?
Quiroga.
Just a few questions?
Go on, move it.
What are you doing there?
Why aren't you in bed?
They kept saying you'd be right back, but you never came.
- Where's Enrique?
- He'll be right in.
Did they put you in jail?
Merceditas said they would, and she never lies.
Jail scares me. Does it scare you?
The jailers scare me.
That's what you get for not saying "shit" seven times.
You're right.
Let's see what we've got here...
What's this?
Look at that! Here. For your fear.
But how do you manage to always hide the trick?
- I can never catch you.
- It's magic.
When are you going to show me everything you know?
How to play instruments, magic tricks, comedy...
You'll learn a lot more from somebody else.
But I want to learn from you.
It's getting cold.
Come on, let's go to bed.
Just a little longer.
Please.
Where did that little jerk take you?
You had me worried.
It's nothing, nothing...
What did he do to you?
I've had worse nights.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
It's a personal matter.
Last night I heard Montero and Quiroga talking about Miguel's mother.
- I told you, it's personal.
- These trucks... are always breaking down.
It's too far to go alone.
Look out!
Yes, the information is correct, but don't get your hopes up.
We try to take care of patients who are dying.
The information was given to me by the government.
Many of them came here without identification.
We do have a lady named
Concepcion, with curly hair and a mole on her cheek.
Is it her?
She looks so pretty here.
Concepcion, sweetie, a friend is here to see you.
Sit down.
Come closer.
Hello, Concepcion.
You don't know me but I'm here on behalf of your son.
My name is Jorge del Pino.
Miguel Angel?
Whenever she sees someone, she only mentions her husband.
He died when the war ended.
Hello, Concepcion.
Miguel is fine.
He's a very good boy, hard-working, he learns very quickly and he's a natural performer.
He says it comes from you... and I believe him, even if he does lie sometimes.
But he will be a great artist, don't you worry.
He'll live up to his name.
He's learning some new instruments now and he's a born comedian.
You should see him!
He told me that he wanted to write to you... Well, actually, he said he wanted to send you drawings of all the places we've played, because Miguel also draws very well.
And also... he makes little paper birds like this one.
Well, it's not one of his best ones.
I'm sure he got nervous because he was thinking about you.
We'll take good care of him, don't worry.
Like one of the family.
How sad, ending up like that.
It must be terrible losing your husband and living like a vegetable.
This war caused too much pain.
We're lucky it's over.
The war, yeah.
I've suffered too.
They didn't kill your son.
When they kill your son, you know what suffering really means.
You don't care about anything.
You can't eat, you can't sleep, and when you do, you wake up with the same torment, the same agony.
It goes away because it hurts so much you don't care anymore.
And you just want to kill... or you just want to die.
You know how many times
I've taken the pin out of a grenade and instead of throwing it, kept it in my hand?
Then one day
I had a grenade in each hand and everywhere I looked all I saw were the faces of my wife and son.
And I said: Enough.
One day you wake up and the war is over and you think all the death is behind you and life goes on.
And you just want to die.
- You're not going to sleep?
- I'll stay a while.
Good night.
When will you hear something about my mother?
Jorge?
I don't know.
We'll get news, don't worry.
Right. Jorge. Jorge!
- Have you seen Quiroga?
- No.
And please, Jorge, leave things be today.
- He's definitely coming.
- Fine by me.
We can't let a chance like this slip away.
We have to get rid of him.
Jorge, it's now or never.
It'll go fine,
I've got it all worked out.
- Where's Captain Montero?
- He's coming with the delegation.
Jorge.
I need to talk to you.
I... think the world of you,
Miguel, Enrique... and I don't want you getting into any trouble.
What are you talking about?
Well, you told me those things about your past
- and the grenades and...
- And what?
Franco's coming and I'm worried.
What do you mean, you're worried?
About what?
How stupid of me...
I told you things I've never told anyone. What's this all about, Pastor?
And what about you? What do I know about you and your life?
Not a thing. I don't know who you are or where you came from.
And what's more, I don't care.
Not about you, or all those soldiers or Franco or anyone else who tries to screw up my life.
People can't even leave me alone for 5 minutes to get my act ready.
Attention!
His Excellency the Generalísimo!
- Arriba España!
- Viva!
- Viva Franco!
- Viva!
Excuse me, Colonel.
I'm Lieutenant Pastor.
Pastor? We meet at last.
That was some idea of yours, having the company meet the Generalísimo.
Very bright!
My idea? Excuse me, Colonel, but I never suggested any such thing.
Besides, I don't think it's very safe.
What do you mean, it's not safe?
Montero said the company is clean.
He can't have told you such a thing!
Not just the captain! I'm quoting your own reports, Lieutenant!
I didn't write any report.
And I never spoke to anyone about
Franco meeting the company!
What are you saying?
Jorge, a chance like this only comes along once in a lifetime.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
We've been waiting for this moment for a long time.
What do you mean, we?
Put that away, this makes no sense!
Jorge, I should hire this guy for the magic act.
I'd make him vanish into thin air.
For good.
The enemy can be anyone.
And you too.
Yes, you, the trumpet player.
Would someone really do that?
Killing doesn't take much encouragement.
Let the flock come together. There's plenty of time to send in the wolves.
We're going to make sure this show makes us look good.
- Understood?
- Yes, Captain.
Is he with us or not?
Yes, he's with us.
I hope Pedro's right.
A lot of people are involved in this and I don't want to endanger anyone.
Captain...
Take him in the corner!
Get back to your business!
- We have to go.
- What are you talking about?
Don't ask me questions
I can't answer.
Get your coats.
We'll use the back door.
- But we still haven't...
- We're leaving!
The boy got hit on the head.
I'm taking him to a doctor.
He has to go on later in the show.
- What do we do now?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Jorge.
- Are you Luciano?
- Yes.
Father Gabriel sent me.
Good evening.
Antonio, go home, it's late.
Here, Enrique.
It's okay. Don't worry.
Come in, Joaquin.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
He'll take you to the station in Badajoz.
You must cross into Portugal as soon as possible.
- Portugal?
- Yes, the train is the safest way.
There are too many checkpoints if you try through Cadiz or Malaga.
I'll prepare four passports for you.
They're waiting for you in Lisbon and they'll give you money for the trip.
Your ship sets sail for Buenos Aires on Thursday.
Buenos Aires...
- What about my mother?
- We'll talk later.
You can't smoke here.
Why not?
God doesn't smoke.
How do you know?
You don't believe in God. If He finds out, you're in big trouble.
Miguel.
Miguel.
I don't want to go without my mother.
She'll always be with you.
How do you know? Have you seen her?
The people we love are always with us, wherever we go.
Are Maria and Rafa always with you?
Always.
And me too?
You? Of course.
When we get to Buenos Aires I'll teach you how to play instruments and we'll prepare a new act.
- Just you and me?
- Yeah. Just you and me.
But you'll have to show me one of your magic tricks to make the act better.
And can I repeat seven times the word?
Sure you can.
Yeah, I'll let you.
Thanks, Papa.
I have to call you that,
Father Gabriel told me so.
"Papa"...
"Father" is okay.
"Papa" sounds better, I like that more than calling you "Father."
Besides, I'm the father around here.
Get your things together,
Joaquin has the passports ready and you have to go.
Let's go.
Remember,
Joaquin will give you the tickets at the station in Badajoz.
God be with you, my son.
- You didn't give me papers for Him.
- Don't worry.
He always finds a way to get where he needs to be.
Thank you.
When you tell him about his mother, tell him she was always well taken care of.
Now go! Go, it's getting very late!
Luciano Castillo!
Here. You'd better start boarding.
And don't sit together.
- Second-class seats aren't numbered.
- Okay, I'll handle it.
- Thanks a lot, Joaquin.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
- Send me a postcard from Buenos Aires.
- Thank you.
Go now and don't look back.
Why? Why did you lie to me?
I trusted you.
I can't believe it.
One more step and you're a dead man!
Put the gun down!
You know perfectly well
I had nothing to do with it.
The train's leaving!
Handcuff him!
Why don't you believe me?
Let's go!
Please, Pastor! No!
He has to come with us!
He's my father, please!
Enrique, do something!
They're taking him away! Do something!
Get the car!
Stop! We can't go yet!
Please!
My father has to get on board!
Don't worry.
The boy needs a real father, not a piece of shit like you.
Run, run!
Stop the train, please!
- Come on! Come on!
- Run! Run!
What are you doing?
Shoot, damn it!
Papa!
Goodbye, son.
I'm a big admirer of yours,
Don Miguel.
It's an honor to be here with you.
My parents and grandparents also admire you a great deal.
Thank you, thank you very much.
- Say hello to them for me.
- I will.
If you really wanna be a hit, repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
As an old friend of mine used to say,
I don't know if I deserve this award.
But I have gout, rheumatism and high cholesterol and I don't deserve any of that either.
I would've liked to have prepared a beautiful speech.
Coming back to Spain, returning to this beloved theater, being reunited with my old friends...
Actually, not that.
At my age, unless I visit them at the cemetery...
I thank you for this award for my career and I dedicate it to many people, but they are not here for me to do so in person.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
You've taken the trouble to come here, and I'm boring you with the stuff of old folks.
No more speeches,
I'm a comedian and not very good at this sort of thing.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I'm going to dedicate this song to my parents,
Enrique Corgo... and Jorge del Pino.
Jorge del Pino taught me this song.
He only let me call him "Papa"... a couple of times.
After a long time
I finally understood why.
Things from these wars that never stop haunting us.
Maestro, please.
Oh well, my friend, c'est la vie.
Money's worth an all-time low.
Wanna buy a pineapple in Madrid?
Prepare yourself for quite a blow.
Nothing to buy, nothing to spend.
Prices as high as they go.
Can't breathe in,
can't breathe out.
I sure could live without Franco!
Oh well, my friend,
life passed away.
Can't even pick the shirt I wear.
My navy blue one faded gray.
I put it on and die of laughter.
I wear it everywhere, even to bed.
It brings tears to my eyes,
you know.
If only I could dye it red.
I sure could live without Franco!
Don't kid yourself,
Veronica.
There will be repercussions.
Highly aware of that.
Tell me again what happened last night.
This little girl told me her mother was pimping her out.
So she beat the mother's ass to a pulp.
Oh, you didn't want to call the police, or all the phones were broken?
You just decided to turn into the Incredible Hulk?
I didn't decide anything, Chloe.
I don't know.
I just got so mad
I couldn't see straight.
Out of control.
Oh, you're real tough.
Real tough.
Number one!
Speaking of out of control.
Looks like it's the Italians versus the Irish.
Happy St. Patrick's Day.
What are you doing out on a holiday that's got nothing to do with you?
Stop it. Come on.
Shut up, stupid.
Exactly.
Ow!
Was that a green bagel?
Threw a bagel at me?
Are you nuts?
How did the Jews get mixed up in this?
Come on! Sit down.
Hey, dude, come on now.
We're all good Catholics here, right?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gina, shut up.
Shut up.
I heard about Lauren Kempton.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She died last night.
Sone.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's sad.
She was a good lady.
Kiss my ass, guido.
You know what?
Why don't I give you another beating, huh, tough guy?
Security!
Security!
Get a little help here?
Okay, I think that's our cue.
Somebody!
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with these people?
Hey!
Congratulations on making it to 11:00 am before needing medical attention.
You are the champions of stupid.
Sit down!
Now!
That was kind of hot,
Chloe.
Gotta do what you gotta do.

I'm supposed to see Klowden to find out how much trouble I'm in, but you know what?
You don't do that to a kid.
That woman was evil.
You pick up the phone.
You call the police.
You know, if I were a man, none of this would be a big deal.
Yeah, if you were a man.
If you hadn't shot someone a week ago.
If you hadn't thrown a cinder block through Harris' window.
Okay.
All right, people.
That's enough.
That is enough.
Yeah, what he said.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
What the hell is going on here?
New medical show called
Cutting-Edge Medicine.
They're doing a piece on me.
Why?
Because I reduced the door-to-balloon heart attack standard from 90 to 45 minutes... and I'm very photogenic.
Shoot me talking to her.
Oh, no.
Aw, come on.
You're pretty.
You're crazy.
It'd be a great way for the audience to meet me.
I, uh--no.
All right, listen.
If the suits try to come down on you for last night, whatever you do, don't let
'em take away your anger.
I'm really not that angry.
I'm just a kook who gets annoyed by mothers pimping out their children.
No, anger is good.
Anger in all of its form has marked the upward surge of mankind.
And anger, mark my words, will save not only
Mercy Hospital nut that other malfunctioning organism, you.
What?
Wall Street.
What do you want?
With the camera here,
I was hoping maybe you could, you know, take a swing at me.
I need a little help here, someone!
Oh. Oh!
I like her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay.
Let's not fall asleep here, sir.
Under the arm.
Use your back.
All right.
Ooh.
So...
Okay.
The board and legal are meeting later to discuss the incident.
I wish everyone was as tired of talking about this as I am.
You're on light clinical duty.
If you say what you're thinking,
I'll have you doing quality assurance chart reviews.
Big guy goes in 510.
Let's get him back to bed.
Hey, thanks for your help.
I have to say I feel a little responsible for your predicament.
Why?
Because...
I'm the one who thought jumping back into work after the shooting would be good for you.
It was a horrible, shocking situation...
And I lost it.
All right.
Call this ptsd specialist.
If I can tell the brass you're seeking help, it might make you look better.
Don't kid yourself.
Forget about losing the job.
If that piece of trash presses charges, you could go to jail.
Call the head-shrinker.
Seriously, the woman looked like she'd been attacked by a bear.
God. You're kidding.
That is rough.
Hey.
What are y'all doing in the nurses' lounge?
We're just hearing about last night.
Yeah, what happened last night?
Veronica didn't tell you?
Didn't tell me what?
Uh, well, let's just say that your girlfriend has got a bit of a short fuse.
Don't eat the last pop tart.
I didn't really break my hip, did I?
No, you have a hairline pubic ramus fracture.
Do you see this little bone here?
It's the least serious kind of pelvic fracture.
It usually takes four to six weeks to heal properly.
The Boston Marathon is in 33 days and I'm going to break
3 1/2 hours or I'll be laughed out of my own office.
Well, I wouldn't book a plane ticket.
I can't guarantee you'll be ready.
Yeah, I want to take him to an optimists anonymous meeting.
You are too positive for your own good.
You're not the first person to say that.
So look, Brooke, your EKG and chest X-ray are basically normal, so your heart and lungs are okay.
Still a little tachycardic.
Your heart's beating a little fast from dehydration.
Which is why you can't go home.
You have to work with this pill every day?
Yep.
Are you a runner?
You look like a runner.
No, I'm not.
I'm not a runner.
I mean, I run sometimes.
How is the dizziness?
All right, I guess.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
You were hit by a car three days ago.
Why didn't you come in then?
I was grazed.
You must have a pretty high pain threshold.
Pain is in the mind.
What is in this bag?
Sterile water with salt and sugar.
Really?
I've been off sugar for six months.
Is this absolutely necessary?
Yeah.
Did you see the lanugo on her arms?
Exercise freak all concerned about the dextrose in her iv.
That's anorexia.
Yeah, I'll order a psych consult.
Look, Dan, I lost it.
Can we please just move past this?
No.
We can't move past this.
You're dangerous.
You're reckless.
You refuse to acknowledge your behavior or take care of yourself.
Okay.
So now we're gonna go back to hating each other?
No, Veronica.
I'm just gonna go back to work.
I checked your X-ray, and they call this a boxer's fracture.
It's a break of the fifth metacarpal, which is the bone between the big knuckle and the wrist.
Yeah, so stop hitting people.
Yeah, I've been telling him that for years.
Let's go, let's go, quick.
Is this really necessary?
Heard there was some action down here.
Uh, just a st. Paddy's day brawl.
Some broken bones and split lips.
Sorry.
Hey, Bob, Larry, look at this.
Must be some reality show or something.
All right, here we go.
Hi.
Yeah.
Ow!
It's just a shot, you baby.
You're freaking orange.
Why do you paint your body anyway?
Shut up, you polka-dotted bitch.
What'd you just call me?
Can you get the cameras out of here?
It's like catnip for morons.
You're much too close to me.
You hear that?
She's talking about you, guido.
What'd you say, bro?
Larry...
Eat me, juicehead!
Bring it, you little ginger prince.
Larry?
Come on.
Boot and rally, Larry.
Larry?
Larry?
Pulse is weak and thready.
Come around.
I need a liter of saline.
Tombstones on the monitor.
St segment elevation.
He's having a heart attack.
What? Oh, my God!
How does a kid his age have an mi?
Cocaine. Anyone?
Oh, my God.
On my count.
One, two, three.
All right, clock is ticking, people.
Fasten your seatbelts.
It's about to get real.
Hey.
Hi.
Do you want to come down to radiology with me?
I want to put your head under an X-ray.
Find out what the hell's going on in there.
Oh, you heard about the thing.
Yeah. I heard about the thing, yeah.
Just now from a whole bunch of people who weren't you.
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.
Sure you were.
Well, I--
We were just so happy and cozy last night.
I didn't want to ruin the mood.
Oh, so you'd rather just drink a bottle of wine,
Scarf down some beef wellington,
And not mention anything?
Yeah.
That is so weird.
Is it?
Honey, it's two blocks past weird.
If I gave you
$1 million, would you call the therapist?
How do you know about the therapist?
Am I the only one around here who can keep my mouth shut?
Veronica, let's get some dinner tonight
And just talk about what's going on.
Please make the call.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Oh, crap!
It's St. Patrick's Day.
So?
Veronica Agnes
Flanagan Callahan?
You can't actually get more
Irish than that without being a leprechaun.
Don't leprechauns eat?
It's just, my family, we go to this street festival every year.
It's tradition.
Okay, wait.
I got it.
I'll do a quick drive-by, say "hi" to the fam,
Check in with my heritage, and then fully engage in some intimacy with you.
How does that sound?
Sounds like a plan.
Good.
Guide catheters in position.
Give me a puff.
What are we looking at,
Dr. Briggs?
Clot in the L.A.D.
I call this "the widow maker."
The main vessel which carries oxygen to the heart is completely clotted off.
Excuse me.
I've got ectopy on the monitor.
Dr. Briggs, do you want me to draw up some lidocaine?
No, I'm about to fix all that... by passing a thin metal wire through the clot.
Is he awake?
No, he's deeply sedated.
Kind of like your crew.
Sorry, dude.
Another mig of versed?
Yeah, go for it.
42 minutes since he collapsed.
Dr. Briggs, you promised us 45.
Yes, I did.
Let's try something else.
Let's try the Fishbein view.
Right.
Got it.
Okay, here we go.
Wire passing.
Excellent.
I'm passing a balloon catheter with a collapsed wire stent on it.
It'll crush the clot, deploy the stent, and keep the artery wide open.
Perfect.
Wow.
44 minutes. Not bad.
You guys can take a break, grab some lunch.
You can talk to Larry when he wakes up in recovery.
Thanks.
We got some great stuff.
I'll get his vitals.
With increased contractility, his pressure should be up.
All right, let's go.
I need an intra-aortic pump now!
Give me a short soft-tipped oh-one-four wire and intravascular ultrasound.
Why? We're done.
Yeah, no, we're not.
Let's go.
The clot is progressing.
But you opened the artery.
No, that was video playback from last week.
Milton Fishbein's cath.
Oh, God, Payne, don't give me the bible-y eyes.
Run of eight.
300 amiodarone.
Glove up and prep the left groin, Chloe.
Veronica, come see this.
Whoa, Brooke.
What are you doing?
Just getting a little exercise, so when I want to go to Costa Rica over Easter, my boyfriend does not throw up when he sees my legs.
Okay, then let's wrap this up.
Ugh!
Just calm down.
I'm almost done.
Just five more minutes.
Oh, my God.
No, this is not a discussion.
I want you to get back in bed before you--
Ahh!
Go get some help.
My leg. I can't--
I can't move it!
Keep still.
We're going to take care of you.
What is this, a cement clot?
You could have asked them to leave.
You didn't have to fake a whole show.
I had to get them out of the room.
They were slowing us down.
Looks like the wire passed.
Don't take the bait.
We could be subintimal.
Volcano cath.
I'm trying to put some polish on this dingy little flop house.
Polish?
Thought it was about medicine.
That's adorable.
It's about pr.
Had to make it look effortless so that when people see us
On TV, they think,
"hey, you know,
"I need a cutting-edge heart procedure.
"maybe I should jump in my Range Rover
"with my big bag of money and drive over the river to Mercy."
Damn, it's all thrombus.
V-tach.
200 joules now.
I got it.
No.
I want you to stay with me on this side of the table.
Clear.
Sinus.
Amio at 70 a minute.
Okay, Chloe,
I want you to advance my catheter one inch.
Me?
Wha--are you sure?
All you have to do is push.
I'm sure you've heard this before... but be gentle.
There we go.
Feel a little resistance?
That's okay.
Steady.
I'm feeling it.
Uh-huh.
I think it moved.
You just pushed a catheter through a blood clot to save a man's life.
Ready to inflate.
That was incredible.
Okay.
Let's wrap this up.
Deflate the catheter.
Cycle the dynamap, send a troponin now,
And q six hours.
I'll take the ivus again.
Oh, I'm gonna get--
Whoo!
So how'd it go with Klowden today?
She wants me to see a therapist and I'm on probation, but I figure I keep my act together and I'll be fine.
Ah-ha-ha!
I'll be fine.
Okay, so did you put in an early warning system for those emotional tsunamis that you're prone to?
Ooh, ouch.
What do you mean,
"emotional tsunamis"?
You have to ask?
Does this mean you're gonna be on my ass too?
Because my ass is totally crowded.
There is no room for you on my ass.
Last place I want to be.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
You working?
No, just meeting some buddies.
Everything good?
Yeah, great.
Listen,
I actually gotta run.
Yeah, no, me too.
All right.
Yeah.
Bye.
How did that go?
It sucked.
And life's a bitch.
So am I.
I really burned that bridge.
Hmm, you just made a mistake.
Granted, it was a naked mistake.
You just have to impress upon him that nakedness is a two-way street.
Ooh, I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm drunk.
You made it through your first run-in.
Have a bear.
Well done.
You did good.
I did.
Hey, Ronnie!
Hey, dad.
Happy St. Pat's!
Thanks, dad.
Oh, happy St. Pat's, honey.
Oh, my God.
What's up, Flanagans?
You guys getting into trouble?
Nah, just the usual.
They're playing ring around the shamrock down the block.
You want in?
Oh, I don't even know what that is.
It's free beer.
Come on.
Okay.
Hey, Ronnie.
Ronnie, come on, dance with me.
Come on.
Dance with me, honey.
I just came to say hi.
No, I can't.
I have to meet Chris.
What? Boo!
Invite your boyfriend down here to celebrate.
Huh, what is he, afraid to have a few beers on St. Paddy's Day?
Hey, hey, hey, ignore them.
Say no to drunken debauchery and yes to your relationship.
Oh, that is so weak.
He doesn't want to have a drink on St. Patrick's Day?
What is he, racist?
We're supposed to talk.
Well, that's what you get for dating a guy who's not Irish.
Your wife is Jewish, Tim.
Let's go inside.
I'm freezing my pills off.
Tell your lame-ass boyfriend to come down here.
It's fun.
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Hey, I'm leaving in a bit.
Where do you want to grab dinner?
Actually can you come meet me here?
My family wants to hang out with you.
No, they don't.
They hate me.
No, they don't hate you.
Your brothers literally tried to kick my ass.
Okay, well,
St. Paddy's Day loophole.
For these 24 hours, all non-irish men fornicating with Irish daughters are forgiven.
Please just come down here and have a beer and then we can go get dinner someplace and talk.
Put some green on and get your pale ass down here now!
You--I--
Hey, man!
Here. Catch up.
Check it.
Flanagans versus the Doherty family.
Bunch of poseurs.
Come on, Ronnie!
Kill!
Ah!
Yes!
Hi! Hey!
Oh, you made it.
Uh, hey, happy St. Patrick's day, Mr. Flanagan.
Yeah, let me get a drink and I'll come back and tell you all about how the Irish saved civilization.
I'm glad you came.
Where's Sonia and Chloe?
Sonia went home.
Bobby's been chasing
Chloe around like a little puppy somewhere.
I don't know.
You having fun?
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.
I didn't call that therapist today.
But I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
Okay, great.
Listen, I need to catch up.
You got to give me a shot.
Mm-hmm!
Oh, my God!
Pat O'Donnell's doing the beer-drinking contest!
Ooh, I'll be right back.
Yes!
Hey, Mike.
Hey.
Hey, happy saint, uh-- yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, um, tequila.
The good stuff.
All right, contestants, get ready.
Grab your beer.
I got this.
Don't mess with me.
I will take you down.
I will crush you.
You need a head start, little girl?
Not from you, lightweight.
So Veronica seems great.
She's an example of moderate appetites.
Looks like your love just healed her right up, big fella.
Two, three, drink!
You should bottle that love, since it cures mental problems.
I mean, at first,
I was skeptical, but I am a believer now.
I get your point.
Thank you, Mike.
Loser!
Yes.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Hey, watch out!
Yo, your arm! Your arm!
You're on fire!
Here.
Put your girlfriend out.
She's on fire.
Totally cool.
I'm okay.
I'm worried about my girl.
Thanks for coming over, guys.
I'm really worried.
She's not herself.
She's drinking a lot.
I see that now that I'm at the bar all the time.
It's the perfect storm with the ptsd and the donut shop and your illness, Jim.
Yeah.
Talking about your sister.
She's gonna love that.
Why didn't you come home last night?
You're a grown man sleeping at your mom's house.
What's all this about?
Why are you guys sitting around in a circle?
I only drink socially!
Come on.
We're talking about Ronnie.
Can anyone tell me what I'm doing here?
Hey, Chloe.
How you feeling?
You sleep okay?
Oh, God.
You want a cup of coffee, sweetheart?
Where is Veronica anyway?
She's at my house.
She got really wasted, so she'll be in bed for hours.
Mom!
Mom, have you seen my--
The--
What's going on?
Is this an intervention?
What? No, no.
It's not an intervention.
You're all sitting in a circle.
You're looking at me.
This is an intervention.
Hey, defensive, circle doesn't mean intervention.
Circles happen for plenty of other reasons.
Like that dance at Jewish weddings.
What's it called, Heather?
The hora.
But since you're here,
Veronica... look, we're all just a little concerned about you.
Since when do you two even talk to each other anyway?
Should I get some beers, anybody?
A little hair of the dog.
This is kind of Ronnie's thing.
Uh, what do you want beverage-wise?
Guys, guys, can we not do the refreshments?
Excuse me.
Does anyone know where my clothes are?
Okay, I'll start.
What's really tough fo is having to sit here and look at poor Mike in the co-pilot seat while Dr. Big stuff here drives the boat.
Okay, what the hell did she actually do that was so terrible?
She shot an armed robber.
She beat up some skel who pimped out her kid.
Thank you, Heather.
It's not those things.
It's how you're dealing with them.
But while we're here, can we shed some light on something that is serious like, say,
Timmy's porn addiction?
Oh!
Whew!
What the hell are you doing on my computer?
Dude, you got to erase the history.
He is a chronic masturbator and it is ruining our marriage.
Well, I have got to have sex with somebody, Heather.
You have to have sex with somebody?
Did I or did I not have blackout sex with Bobby Flanagan or any other
Flanagan last night?
No, nothing happened.
I made a little pillow barricade.
God.
Hey, guys. What's up?
What's everybody--
Whoa!
No, I do not have a problem, okay?
Dude, dude, what the hell happened to you?
This is ridiculous.
Ronnie?
Ronnie, please.
Listen to me.
Your mother and I--
Your mother and
I had three boys and then we had you.
Oh, your mother was so happy and I--
I was so scared.
But the minute I saw you, you were my little princess. and I tried so hard to never let anything bad happen to you.
And it's been so rough for you, sweetie.
Dad--
You walk around late at night.
You jump when I say your name.
You're drinking too damn much.
You're at sea.
Don't say you're not.
I'd give everything I got to take the load off your shoulder, but I can't.
I don't know how to help you.
And, um...
It's breaking my heart.
I gotta go to work.
Hey, Veronica.
Hi, Dr. Waters.
Just talked to Brooke Sullivan.
Stairmaster?
How's she doing?
Well, she doesn't meet criteria for a psych hold.
Not that that matters,
'cause she ain't going anywhere.
I offered her voluntary inpatient treatment.
She refused, but she did sign a contract with me to eat more and have outpatient therapy.
I gave her my opinion.
It's probably 1 of 100 that she's heard in the past few years.
We'll see.
You sound cynical.
Well, you're the one that called her "stairmaster."
You know, these people are pretty good at telling you what you want to hear.
I know you probably can't handle another person coming in here and getting in your face with the truth, so I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe some of us are always gonna be a little too little or a little too much.
And I'm not gonna tell you
I'm not worried about you.
I hope you start to take care of yourself.
But right now, I'm just here to be your nurse.
So how's your pain?
You're eating.
That's great.
I was hungry.
Good.
Plus I just got dumped.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He said he couldn't deal with the drama anymore.
I was a fat kid, you know.
I mean, I've been on and off antidepressants since I was ten.
And I guess I'm just a little obsessed with not going back to that.
Anyway, I'm gonna try.
Eat a little more.
Moderate the exercise.
See if I can find a little-- balance.
Right.
Hello, Brooke.
This is Dr. Sands.
Hi.
He's going to talk to you about your hip.
So, Brooke, when you fell, the ball of the joint blasted through the socket.
It's called an acetabular fracture.
The socket fractured into multiple pieces.
Multiple?
At least ten.
We're going to have to operate to put the pieces back together using plates, screws, wire.
Okay, how soon can we do it?
Well, you're too anemic for surgery now.
You'll need two blood transfusions.
It's gonna be a little rough, Brooke.
You're gonna be three months on crutches.
And if all goes well, you can be active again after a year.
A year?
Okay.
I can do that.
So he ignores me all through high school.
They always do.
Right?
So then the year after graduation,
I was getting a slurpee at the "sevs" in that mini-mall with the Hilfiger Outlet and he sees me with these.
He still didn't ask me out, but now I'm on his radar.
Hey, babe.
How are you?
Come on, you were always on my radar.
All right, the blips, now they just got a little bigger, you know what I mean?
All right, how we doing in here?
So anyways, like, a week later at the club, he accidentally shoved me down the stairs.
But I was okay except for a concussion.
But that was it.
I've been taking care of him ever since.
Sounds just like The Notebook.
All right, femoral site looks good.
No hematoma.
Yeah, it's itching like crazy, doc.
Did you really have to shave me?
You should be grateful,
Lar.
You had 13 days sober under your belt and you let that bitch Gina give you blow?
Um, Lar?
Oh, my God.
Systolic's 80.
Excuse me.
Saline on a pressure bag.
Show me the 12-lead.
I need ultrasound in here now.
Larry? Larry?
What's going on?
Is having another heart attack?
Did he clot off his stent?
No, heart's completely normal.
It's something else.
Decreased bowel sounds.
Let's go.
Jelly on the belly.
Come on.
Do you want dopamine?
No.
I want two units of blood from the bank.
He's bleeding like crazy from his liver.
Oh, my God.
Did we nick it with the catheter?
No, it was nowhere near the liver.
Could be cysts.
Barb, is he a juicer?
'cause I'm thinking steroid use here, am I right?
Tell him, Barb!
Yeah.
Put him in trendelenburg.
Hold an O.R. and page Sands.
So I've never seen a case of peliosis hepatis before.
Yeah, it's spontaneous hemorrhaging from blood-filled cysts in the liver.
And it's associated with anabolic steroid use?
Definitely.
Hey, slasher?
Make sure this kid lives, okay?
I'm batting a thousand here at Mercy,
So don't ruin my average.
What an ass.
Good in bed though.
What are you doing here?
I knew you'd be having lunch here.
Do you have a sec?
Give me a sec, guys.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Except seeing you last night kind of killed me.
I miss you so much, Nick.
Sonia, come on.
Do you know that
I would give anything to go back and have dinner with you on Valentine's Day?
I'm so sorry.
I was scared and stupid and selfish... and I lost the best thing that ever happened to me.
Come on.
I have to know.
Would you ever consider getting back together?
Sone...
I appreciate everything you just said.
Really.
And I know how hard it was for you to say it,
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
Well, hey, can't we just get a drink and talk about it?
Took care of the check,
Nick.
Let's go chase some bad guys.
I got a new partner and new shifts.
Hey, change can be good, right?
I'll see you.
Hey.
Great news.
Larry made it through surgery without a hitch.
Sands fixed his liver and those hemorrhagic cysts will go away as long as he stays away from the steroids.
Right there.
Right... there.
How many times are you gonna do that?
Until I catch all my mistakes.
What mistakes?
You fixed that guy in, like,
75 minutes.
That's--that's way faster than the national standard.
My father died of an mi in the waiting room of a mediocre hospital.
He was a good guy.
Made me want to revolutionize cardiac care and what happened yesterday was not revolutionary, Chloe.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
It's not your fault.
Obviously I'm not responsible for your father's death.
I was just saying
I'm sorry for your loss.
Well, as fascinating as your feelings about my losses are,
I really need to figure out what the hell took so long, so if you don't mind.
Not at all.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry about that accidental intervention today.
That was a train wreck.
No, I get it.
Things have been a little rough lately.
I can see where you might be concerned.
I love you.
I was just worried about you, that's all.
I love you too.
I guess I just feel like if we're together, everything's going to be okay.
Well, we were together last night and you set yourself on fire.
Yeah.
Well, it's not
St. Patrick's Day till somebody lights themselves on fire, right?
I guess so.
Does it have to be you?
Never again. I swear.
See you at my place later?
Yeah.
Hey, could you give these to Brooke Sullivan?
It's info on support groups in the area.
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Help me get this door open.
Brooke?
Oh, my God.
Help! Brooke!
Brooke? Help!
Help!
I need some help in here!
Help me cut her down!
How the hell did she do that?
Call for intubation!
She was in traction.
She's setting well at 50% oxygen.
Good.
No spontaneous eye-opening,
But she does withdraw to painful stimuli.
That's encouraging.
Well, we'll have to wait and see how much neurological function returns.
I thought she was okay.
She told me she was gonna try.
Yeah.
It's really frustrating.
Hi.
Hi.
What can I get for you?
Scotch on the rocks.
Please.
Sure.
There you are.
Thank you.
Let's see what we have here.
Okay, wound is clean and dry.
Xeroform and a fresh abd.
Larry, I was so worried about you.
How are you feeling?
I'm a little muffed up from the pain medication,
But I'm okay.
I'm so sorry, Larry.
I never should have let you take all those steroids.
No, that's not your job, okay?
I gotta make some lifestyle changes.
I know.
Listen, Lar.
You don't need to be all juiced up for me.
I mean, I love the fact that I can put my arms all the way around you.
Oh, baby, you're so good to me.
Well, you're my flower.
Your what?
My flower.
See, I was watching
Dr. Phil before and he says that in every relationship, there's a flower and there's a gardener.
And you're my flower.
Oh, baby, come here.
And I'm your gardener.
Come here. Come here.
Mm.
So you and Briggs, huh?
That's none of your business.
I'm over us okay, Chris?
Gillian, wait.
I know, but--
Look, I'm sorry about the way everything went down.
Yeah, well, you should be.
'cause with me, you would have been the flower, and now you're the gardener and you have a lot of weeds to pull.
Here you are.
Thanks.
What are you drinking?
Scotch.
I really got to switch to that color.
Why is that?
This is what my parents drank and they're alcoholics.
Help you sleep at night?
Yeah.
I get it.
What keeps you awake?
This, you know?
I can't--
I can't turn it off.
Same stuff over and over.
What kind of stuff?
You ask a lot of questions, lady.
You don't want to talk about it?
God, everyone in my life just keeps wanting me to talk about everything, but they really don't want to know.
Trust me.
'cause if you told them, they'll think you're crazy?
Everybody already thinks
I'm crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
Maybe.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that I just want everybody to shut up and leave me alone.
I just want to be left alone.
But not?
Right?
But not.
Because when I'm alone, it's worse.
Welcome to the human race.
It's been great talking to you, Veronica.
I'm really glad you called.
But next time, let's meet in my office, okay?

OUTSIDE SATAN
I can't stand it anymore.
You understand?
You're crazy.
There is only one thing to do about that.
Give me a cigarette.
Thanks.
We will do everything we can to clear up this affair.
Could you tell me in what circumstances you found your husband?
No. I don't know.
She doesn't know, she doesn't know.
Then we must...
We will check inside.
Try to figure out the circumstances.
Forgive me.
For all the harm he did to you.
Come quickly.
Come quickly.
My daughter is not well.
It is a few days that she is in this state.
The doctor won't tell me anything.
What are you doing here?
I have already told you that this place is off-limits.
You, I don't want to see you here again.
Take your gear and clear out.
Are you finished?
- Give me a kiss.
- No.
- Give me a kiss.
- No.
- Come on, kiss me.
- No.
- Come on...
- No.
- No.
- Come on...
No.
- You could have come with me.
- No.
Ok...
I'll go.
- I have to go see my mother.
- OK. I'll stay here.
How are you?
Ok.
I am preparing my fire, now.
Well. I'll go.
We sit here?
Yeah.
- Do you mind if I wear only a bra?
- No.
He...
Yeah, Ok, I'll go.
Hey, what are you doing?
It is hard at home at the moment.
I've had enough.
My mother won't stop crying.
She's always after me.
She's complaining.
She doesn't realise what I've gone through.
Stop it, you're totally insane!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- What do you want ?
- Come.
I shot without looking.
You shot without looking...
How could you do something like that?
I'll go. We'll see each other tomorrow, it's better this way.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Thank you.
- Did you sleep well?
- Ok.
You wouldn't have a fag would you?
Thanks.
It's nice today.
Yes.
We go for a walk?
We are waiting for the ballistics results.
And those of the autopsy.
We have no leads yet to advance the investigation.
We can't tell you anything more.
For now, it's on stand-by.
Ok.
We are doing everything to clear up this affair.
- Well. Ok?
- Ok.
There.
The investigation is in progress.
They know how to do it, though.
Anyway, we did what we had to do.
So you don't worry with your step-dad.
He won't hurt you anymore.
You saved me.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Is there something wrong?
I'll be fine.
Don't worry.
It's because you're not in the habit.
You can come in.
My mother has gone to Boulogne.
- You want some?
- No, no.
Are you on the moon?
I'll clear out.
I'll pass by to see you in a while.
Ok, see you.
He, oh!
He, oh!
Hello.
Hello...
You smell good.
What are you doing?
I was strolling.
I'm going back now.
I've just seen your friend.
You want to go out with me?
I already told you that I don't.
There is no point,
I don't have any feelings.
Give me a kiss.
Whatever you say, you smell like love.
Where were you?
I was looking everywhere for you.
I was out strolling.
Didn't you get caught by the storm?
No, I took cover.
I ran into the guard, when I was looking for you.
This time... he chatted me up.
Worse than the other times.
This time, he kissed me.
Are you an idiot or what?
Oh, oh...
Ok, Ok...
You scared me!
- What were you doing?
- Nothing.
He scares me.
He's on the side of the lane, over there.
- On the side ?
- Yes.
Hugo, here!
Hugo, come here, doggy!
Come here.
Fuck off, get lost!
Get lost!
Get the fuck off!
Come here! Come.
Come! Come on.
Why don't you want me?
That's how it is.
Don't you want me at all?
It's strange.
You think he's dead?
You could just take me.
Come on, that's enough!
Come on, give me a break.
Wait for me.
Thank you, thank you, thank you...
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you!
Go back inside.
Thank you.
- Are you Ok?
- Yes.
I must go.
I can't watch this.
Look, it is spreading.
I don't understand what happened.
- I don't know.
- Who could have done that?
I couldn't say.
It's sad, nonetheless.
You have but to cross, you will see, there will be no more fire.
Are you kidding me?
You do it yourself.
You are really an ass.
Why are you doing this to me?
I will fall.
Go on, you are halfway there.
I will fall.
No, look.
There is already less smoke.
I can't look back.
Is it true?
I swear it's true.
Come.
Do you want me to come get you?
You're an ass.
Fuck!
You lunatic!
- Look, look.
- You are getting on my nerves.
Look, look.
There is no more smoke.
Come on.
- Where are you taking him?
- That's it, move along.
- Hello.
- Hello.
He!
Hello.
Do you know the road to Boulogne-sur-Mer?
Are you going back, now?
I saw you in the marshes, you know.
It's a nice place.
You know if I can crash there?
No, it's full of mosquitoes.
I am not afraid of mosquitoes.
A little beer?
That would be nice.
Cheers.
You know you're a sweetheart?
If you want, you can fuck me.
Do you want?
Wait.
Come.
Take this!
- How long did you stay there?
- An hour.
The guard filled a complaint against me.
Did you get into a fight?
No, I passed by the fields.
Well...
I have to go prepare something to eat.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
They caught the murderer.

Arms dealer found dead in a graveyard outside Moscow.
The murder of Russian arms dealer Andre Sukhorov...
...has again thrown up this dangerous question.
Did Sukhorov possess a suitcase nuclear bomb?
And if so, where is it?
Both the United
States and Soviet Union...
...have acknowledged producing nuclear weapons...
...small enough to be carried in specially designed backpacks...
...during the cold-war.
These bombs, identified in Russia as KV series...
...have the explosive power between...
...three and ten kiloton of TNT.
The bombs at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki...
...were 20-30 kiloton each.
But the value of the suitcase bomb lies...
...in its ability to be easily smuggled across borders...
...transported by means widely available.
And placed as close to the target as possible.
A single suitcase bomb can devastate...
...ten kilometers of a modern city.
It will kill everything within a three kilometer radius...
...and the radiation will subsequently kill more.
Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead
I've heard the bomb is up for sale
This is what every terror group in the world is looking for.
This could start World War 3.
If this gets into the wrong hands, millions will be killed.
I was thinking billions.
Comrades!
Lt's my friend Dmitri's birthday.
So we all have a drink, okay.
Make drink.
You wanted to meet in a public place.
Abu Nazir has turned a public place, private.
I am impressed.
I've chosen the right man.
I need $50 million cash in three days, in Morocco.
So much in so little time.
Do you know my commission?
Do you know what I need it for?
India?
I need the money in three days in Morocco.
Do you have a contact who can be trusted?
I know the right man for the job.
I will give you $50 million cash, tomorrow.
All he has to do is buy 242.
Abu, before talking about 242...
...can you tell me how many calories there are in one potato chip?
And how many chips did you eatjust now?
I am sorry, I am a health freak.
And this can be... dangerous for your health.
Comrades.

Did you get the money?
Forget the money.
Do you know what you said?
What did I say?

You are a RAW agent.
Did I say that?
How much Pentothal did you give me, madam?
50 ml.
Thanks. Yes I killed Abu

His bodyguard.
Mahim Murtaza.
Real name Rajan Sinha.
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?
You know we're not supposed to take names, right?
Abu slipped up.
And I was sent here to check if...
...David Kazan too is slipping up.
But look what you did to me?
Bravo, Mr. Kazan.
Can I get a towel, please?
I got the money but...
...there's something fishy about this Freddie
Shall I kill him?
Why don't you stay the night?
What is on your mind, Mr. Kazan?
Who is that doctor?
Ruby Mendes.
My personal doctor.
Ruby Mendes. Nice name.
Did you give her that name?
- Meaning?
Bathroom.
- What?
Bathroom?
Thank you.
I am so sorry, madam.
Excuse me.
You should have told me someone's inside.
Who is it?
- I don't know.
Some lady.
She's sitting on the commode, reading a magazine.
There is no one here.
What?
She was right here...
Where did she disappear?
She was reading that magazine.
She was wearing a blue kaftan.
Big necklace around the neck...
...and a strange tattoo here.
She was right here.
It was her.
My mother.
She passed away 22 years ago.
What?
What the hell did you inject me with?
You need rest, Mr. Freddie.
Rest.
Show him to his room.
Goodnight, Mr. Kazan.
- Goodnight.
Hello, Dr. Ruby.
If you're feeling dizzy then take these pills...
And eat something.
I had two bottles of water.
Yet everything looks 3D.
Drink?
- No, thanks.
Kazan told me that you saw his mother.
I think I saw a ghost.
Do you believe in ghosts?
What nonsense.
39 dead.
Don't they haunt you?
The ghosts of those who died in the London blast.
I am impressed.
You escaped from a British jail.
...have been evading Interpol.
I am impressed... Miss
Iram Parveen Bilal.
Iram Parveen Bilal is dead.
My name is Ruby.
Goodnight, Freddie.
Does he know about the spycam?
He knows about me.
Yes.
A tourist group has just landed from London.
There's an Ml6 agent amongst them.
Maybe he knows about 242.
I am going out for a walk.
If you want to keep an eye on me...
...then send Dr. Ruby along...
Here.
I don't think you exploded that bomb...
Why do you say that?
You have killer eyes...
But they're not the eyes of a killer.
Tell that to my London courtjudge.
You know everything about me.
Tell me something about yourself.
I cannot lie.
And you'll catch me if I tell the truth.
I am in the same business as you.
But why are we talking shop
...in a romantic place like Tangier?
Lf you weren't so serious...
...I would've invited you to dinner this evening.
And cooked for you too.
I am a good cook.
What's on the menu?
Wow. That means yes.
Well, that's a Kodak moment.
May I take a picture, madam?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
- Yes?
Do you speak English?
- Yes... yes.
Can you take a photo of me and my wife, please?
Okay.
How is Freddie?
- Very happy
Richard Maibaum, British Agent.
He's the Ml6 agent in-charge of the Middle East sector.
Something's happening.
Where can I find him?
Hotel Rif & Spa.
Room no. 430. I am sending you a photo.
Understood. Understood.
Photo?
Not good here.
Fountain. - Okay.
Madam, fountain please.
Ready.
Smile.
Thank you.
Enjoy your honeymoon.
Shall we?
Have lunch.
I know a nice place.
Hotel Rif & Spa.

"Praise the Lord for creating one such as you"
How many girls have you said this to?
Including you? 242.
You've brought $ 50 million to buy 242.
Do you know what 242 is?
What did Kazan tell you?
Excuse me, madam.
The menu.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I am not feeling well.
I have to go back.
Of course, no problem.
I hope you will come with me to the auction this evening.
There are some other bidders but don't worry. I'll get 242
Sir Jagdeshwar
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen...
...for your most generous contributions.
I am going to match the sums that have been raised here today...
...and this money will help in building schools and hospitals...
...in this lovely, this great country.
Good evening, Sir.
Your face reassures me that all is well.
242. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.
Poems on love and destiny written in the 11th century.
Very nice.
Good luck.
Why did you get him here?
He got me here.
I should be keeping a watch on you instead.
Found this in Richard's room.
You must have dropped it in a hurry.
No, I didn't. When did you flick this?
And who is Richard?
Relax, we're on the same side.
Next item is a YU Rain mask.
An emblem of the YU tribe.
Please.
Hello.
I am Jagdish.
Great honour to meet you Sir.
Freddie Khambatta. Dr. Ruby Mendes.
From India?
- India.
Pakistan.
Sworn enemies...
Can become great friends too.
Are you here for anything special?
She's interested in the Rubaiyat.
And I am interested in her.
I see.
Excuse me.
Hello, prince.
What are you doing here?
Where is Daya Master?
I thought the Tigers were finished.

Going twice.

Nuclear bomb?
Sold.
Lot no. 242, the
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam...
...sold to Mr. David Kazan for half a million dollars.
Excuse me.
Where were you, Mr. Khambatta?
Ruby and the Rubaiyat are both gone.
Thank you.
For activation, in those days
...the command validation of a
Russian satellite was required
But we have made changes.
You need to enter a password that's all...
...that is required for activation.
This Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam is the detonator.
Don't lose it.
So, my congratulations, Mr. Kazan.
- Thank you.
And thank you, Dr. Rana, for your contributions.
What time is flight, Dr. Rana?
Thank you.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
Dr. Rana, this is the best champagne in the world.
And you are drinking water.
His job was done.
Can you take care of him?
Freddie Khambatta.
I am Colonel.
Why are you standing here?
Join the party.
Party's over, Colonel.
The party's just begun.
If you see my mother again...
...then tell her I said Hi.
Whoever he is, get rid of him.
Hello, my dear.
The pipeline goes through this lane...
...and we have an observation post every 10 kilometers.
Sir, there's a call for you.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Nawaz.
Hello, Mr. Lftekhaar.
I can hear raging fire and roaring rain.
You are in Chaman.
Impressive, Mr. Nawaz.
Even at this age, you still have keen ears.
I can even hear what's happening in Morocco.
I just heard that David
Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb.
What? Where did you get this news from?
Mr. Nawaz, you will have to share your source with me.
Because if there's any truth in this...
...then we'll need to cooperate.
Tell me, General.
Are you involved?
I have no idea.
I didn't know at all.
If I had any clue about this...
...then I would have called you myself.
Look, Mr. Lftekhaar, whatever the problems between us...
...this cannot be the solution.
Thank you very much.
Give me 12 hours. I will call you back.
Goodbye.
Cancel the inspection.
We will return to
Islamabad right now.
Hello. Cancel my trip to China.
And call an emergency meeting...
...of all the section chiefs tomorrow.
Specially section Q, okay.
Fine.
Take lftekhaar sir's convoy to the Turkhum border...
...and blow it up with a launcher.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
Breaking news.
ISI chief lftekhaar
Ahmed killed in a bomb blast.
Is this Zaheer's home?
This is Zaheer's home, but he is on the terrace.
Thank You!
You're welcome
Who are you?
I am Freddie.
Freddie Khambatta.
- What?
Yes. I am Freddie.
If you are Freddie then who is he?
So you were telling the truth that day.
You are a RAW agent!
Who is the Colonel?
Where is the bomb? - That's what I came here to find out.
I thought you knew about him.
She's trying to confuse us.
Where is the bomb?
I am on your side.
I work for the British Intelligence.
And you killed that British agent?
I didn't kill Richard.
He was my handler.
I went there to inform him about you.
To show him your face.
You killed 40 people in London.
You were smiling as you got out of the car.
You were smiling.
I was smiling, because I was happy.
It was a beautiful day.
Boss, why are you listening to this nonsense?
I am responsible for the death of those 40 people.
Because my own friends...
...had planted the bomb in my car.
I was waiting for them.
If I wasn't feeling hungry...
...and hadn't stepped out...
...then the blast would have killed me...
When one of the group was caught in Pakistan...
...then ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me.
He was convinced that I am innocent.
He convinced Richard.
They said that they will help me...
...but I will have to work for them.
They sprung me out ofjail...
...and sent me to Morocco, to Kazan.
Kazan buys drugs from terrorists, and supplies arms.
So you are an ISI agent?
I just report to lftekhaar Sir.
He knows the truth about me.
Last month I intercepted Abu
Nazir's phone call from Moscow...
...that Freddie Khambatta is arriving with $50 million.
I informed Richard, that's why he came here personally.
Can you prove this?
Talk to lftekhaar sir.
He knows me.
Lftekhaar Ahmed is dead.
He's dead?
And Richard too.
Now there's no one left to prove your story.
Zahir.
Come here.
He's one of them.
Now he knows about you.
Shoot him.
No.
I cannot kill anyone.
Not even him.
I don't know where the bomb is.
But the Rubaiyat is the trigger.
The bomb is useless without Rubaiyat.
And right now
Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe.
If you believe me then let me go.
I know the combination of that safe.
Otherwise go yourself.
But for God's sake get that Rubaiyat out of there.
Let's go.
Come on.
20 minutes.
Good luck, Iram.
She was lying.
You believed her?
She was telling the truth.
Yeah Iram.
I have the Rubaiyat and the location of the bomb as well.
Meet me at Golden Farah restaurant, in 20 minutes.
"My friends deserted me."
"My love deserted me."
"Life's so..."
Indian?
Oh, good. Number one.
Goodbye to Morocco.
Indian?
- Yes.
I am Suresh Krishna.
That's funny...
My name is also Suresh Krishna.
By the way, I work for the United Nations.
Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.
Is this a joke?
I am the Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.
We need to ask you some questions,
Mr. Shastri.
How are you feeling?
I am hungry.
We found Mr. Kazan's address in your pocket.
He's dead. His house has been burgled.
How do you know him?
- I mean him in an auction.
Don't disturb the patient please.
Officers. Please step outside.
I need to examine the patient
Officers.
I will see you in some time.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.
Three bullets and you're still alive.
You must be really lucky.
Do you believe in luck?
Lf I believed in luck I'd be dead a long time ago, Doctor.
I see.

Do you believe in luck, doctor?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Riga.
Riga.
Do you know where they are?
Look at that man closely.
Anton Brega.
Considers himself a Casanova.
He is an alcoholic... and a womanizer
He has one more bad habit.
He's honest.
He's the Airport Security chief.
There's a pass card in his wallet which I want.
We'll be done by 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Until then you will have to keep him out of the airport.
So... you have to spend the night with him.
Get lost! I am not your property!
Bloody reptile!
I just want to die.
No, actually, I just want to get drunk.
Sorry.
- No, that's okay. That's fine.
Give me another one.
What do you want? Just get lost.
Okay. Sir, please.
Thank you.
Anton Brega.
- Josie.
Nice to meet you, Josie.
I told you to get lost.
We just got out of the third casino.
He has won around three-four lakhs.
He says I am lucky for him.
Now he wants to take me home.
Two more hours.
Ourjob will be done.
Take him to Hotel Riga. 405.
There's a room booked in the name of Josie.
Darling, I've got some special champagne for you.
That's for you. Look at it.
Goodbye.
Hello, sir.
Welcome to Riga.
Mr. Nawaz called from Delhi.
This packet is for you.
Any news about those two?
"My darling, I said."
"My darling, you heard it."
"Our hearts communicated with each other."
"My darling, I said."
"My darling, you heard it."
"My darling, I said."
Hello.
Excuse me.
Yes.
That Brega is after me.
He's about to jump on me.
Relax.
Open the mini bar.
There's a chocolate box inside.
Feed him some of those chocolates.
He'll pass out for a few hours.
What about the package?
- You want to see it?
Knock him out and leave right away.
Okay, fine.
I was waiting for you at Golden Farah.
Thank God you are alive.
Enough of your charade.
- Listen to me.
Colonel had asked me to
- Where is the Colonel?
I was just talking to him.
The bomb is here... in the city.
The man in the room with me is...
You saved my life.
Time for a little chat, Colonel.
You okay?
- Get me out of here.
Get here, now.
Get down.
Ready?
Catch them.
He's heading straight.
He's taking a turn.
He's near town square.
Straight and left.
20 kilometers from here.
He has stopped near Maxima Mall.
Don't you want to know why
I lied to you in Morocco
Maybe you didn't like my shoes?
'The Colonel had killed Kazan.'
'He was about to kill me... '
'And suddenly I saw... '
'ln another minute, Freddie Khambatta would've told him everything'
'The man you think is Freddie
Khambatta is actually a RAW agent.'
'He's dead. - He's alive.
And he knows about the bomb.
'I thought that if I told the Colonel about you, I might gain his trust.'
'Where is he? '
'Maybe he would involve me in whatever his plan was...
I did it to find out about the bomb.
'Sir, I am... '
'Just a minute. Just a minute.'
'Hold it.'
'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.'
'I am a flight purser.'
'Abu gave me a $10 note.
What was his name? '
'I don't know his name. He beat me.'
'He took the dollar I was supposed to give you.'
Colonel had taken my phone away.
I snatched someone's phone from the airport toilet
...and tried calling you.
How will you face three armed men with one bullet?
Don't be afraid.
May God give your husband a long life.
It's stopped.
Come here.
Where did you get this?
- What is that?
Where did you get this?
- I don't know. What is that?
Where did you get this?
- I don't know.
I am telling you, I don't know.
Dr. Suresh Krishna.
Dr. Suresh Krishna?
We are waiting for you
Sorry, sir. This is portable X-ray machine no. 311.
Maybe the colonel lied to you.
Brega's pass was used not to bring bomb into the city
...but to take it out of the city.
13 flights have taken off...
...since Brega's death...
...they can be checked only on landing.
The local police want to question you.
Cops in Moscow and Morocco police want to question me as well.
You are in a queue.
Keys please.
I'll be in touch, sir.
Where are they?
They say you need too eat to gain something.
Whenever you get the opportunity, recharge.
Sit down, eat something.
What's on your mind?
Wondering what happens next?
Don't worry, we'll help you.
You cannot help me.
New identity, passport, character certificate.
Money.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want my life back.
I want my father, who died when I was in jail.
I want the clinic, with a board outside saying...
...Doctor Iram Parveen Bilal.
I want a home.
A husband who's crazy about me.
I want kids.
I want a normal life.
I want a world where the Rubaiyat is just a book with beautiful poetry.
Not a nuclear bomb detonator.
There's a circuit inside that activates the bomb.
I have some more information.
Take that as well.
I overheard the Colonel on the phone last night.
He was fixing a meeting with
Taimoor Pasha on the 28th.
At Hotel Gazebo.
Hotel Gazebo is in Karachi.
I don't know anything else.
And I don't want to either.
Can I go now?
Where will you go?
What will you do?
Anywhere.
I wanted to be a painter.
I thought I will be famous.
A house in the mountains.
Exhibitions in Paris.
Five marriages.
Couple of kids from each marriage...
But the cable snapped.
- What?
One of the cables of the ropeway snapped.
We were in Mussoorie, on a school trip.
The entire cabin was dangling on one cable.
A sheer 2000 feet deep drop below.
The other cable could snap any moment...
Plunging us to our death.
And then I climbed up.
I clung to a rope for eight minutes.
And managed to secure the cable.
I was 15 years old.
I got a medal from
President Venkatraman.
Those eight minutes changed my life.
I always wanted to return...
...to that place between life and death.
I am still hanging from that cable.
The day I let go...
In Delhi, when the dogs from one lane start barking...
...do you know what the other dogs do?
Good evening, sir.
Sir, we've to leave for the airport in an hour.
You're leaving for London.
They are waiting for you at the Embassy.
I've got all the documents with me.
Passports. Documents and some money, sir.
Excuse me.
Can I clear the table?
Five minutes, Iram.
I've a flight to catch. Kill them.
Sir, I will wait in the lobby.
- Okay.
Rajesh.
Sir. Sir.
Sir.
Where is it?
Sorry, sir. I had no option.
How many people outside?

"Giving a meaning to my otherwise futile life"
"I was like a lost ship"
"and I wonder how you brought me to the shore"

Welcome to Somalia.

You got anything for me?
Take the plane.
We welcome you to Karachi, Pakistan.
Welcome to Pakistan, sir.
Any special reason to come here?
Her grandfather died in the blast.
If you hurry up...
...then we can take part in the final rites.
Please.
Thank you.
Anytime, brother.
Next please.

Of course.
They're with me.

What kind of security is this?
Who is this girl?
Interpol, Indian government, who is behind her?
Find out.
- We will find out.
Who are you?
Who do you work for?
I work for Pakistan.
Who do you work for?
This bug... Tell me?
The longer you take...
...the more fun it will be for me
Don't worry about me.
I am in my own country.
You leave. Good bye.
There's another spy here.
Find him.
This is him.
Listen... excuse me...
I am sorry.
We've found the spy.
Come on.
Listen to me.
Your partner's been caught.
You are a traitor.
That's why Gen.
Lftekhaar never trusted you.
I am sure you are responsible for his death.
How do you know General lftekhaar?
Leave me.
I haven't done anything.
What... what is happening here?
I haven't done anything.
I swear.
I was only eating betel leaf.
Chewing betel leaf is allowed.
Is he your partner?
I don't know him.
I don't know her personally.
I saw her performing at the dance
She was singing.
I swear... I swear I haven't done anything.
I came with the wedding procession from Rawalpindi.
And my father...
Father own a reputed hotel.
Your days of spying are over... my friend.
Every dog has his day.
What is Blue Bird?
How dare you ask me questions?
Have you captured me?
There's going to be a big blast in Delhi tomorrow.
Unfortunately you won't be there to see it.
Won't you fulfill my last wish, Colonel?
You want a chopper to get out of here?
I want a chilled beer.
I am sure you can arrange for it.
Translator : Milad Taherkhani
Get him a beer.
But don't give him the bottle.
Bring it in a paper cup.
He's very cunning.
Anything else.
Juice for you?
Thank you.
Will you marry me?
Where to now?
Delhi.
We're in Karachi?
We need to reach
Jahangir point in ten minutes.
Welcome.
The pilot says we'll leave at dawn.
You'll be in Delhi in two hours.
All the arrangements have been done.
You will have to fly really low...
...for the Geiger counter to detect any radiation.
But what is wrong? Tell me.
Sorry, sir. I cannot tell you anything.
Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you.
Please come.
Come, sir.
You cannot make baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Do you have evidence?
Colonel Huzefa mentioned 'Blue Bird'.
What is 'Blue Bird'?
Colonel Huzefa died in Karachi yesterday.
So how can you say that he's involved?
I saw him giving orders myself.
Tehmur Pasha was present there as well. They spoke about the bomb
You shut up.
You're betraying your country, and accusing others.
The meeting is over.
- No, it's not over.
If this bomb explodes in Delhi, there'll be nuclear war.
We will launch a counter attack.
In 20 minutes,
Lahore, Karachi,
Islamabad will be annihilated.
More than 60 lakh people will die on both sides.
If you say
Pakistan isn't involved...
...then this is the time to prove it.
What is Blue Bird?
Name? Place? What is it?
Believe me, I don't know.
Mr. Khan, I can be court-martialed for bringing you here.
But millions can be saved as well.
Control room.
10 geo-stationary satellites.
And two roaming.
There are more than 4000 cameras installed in Delhi.
We can see everything.
And maybe you can see your wife in one of these cameras...
...who just returned home after dropping your kids to school.
There are other mothers, children, families who have no idea...
...that everything will be over in four hours.
I believe it, Mr. Khan.
That you don't know.
But there must be someone in Pakistan, in ISI or in your embassy...
...who knows! Please, find out.
"These days he never stops anyone."
"No matter what you do, it never interferes."
"There's loot and plunder all around, and destruction."
"God is up above, and we're on earth."
Would you like to have tea?
"These days He pays less attention to us."
One world government.
Look I've never understood this term.
We are a small circle of friends.
Including top bankers, oil magnets, media personalities...
...political figures, even an ex-president of the United States.
Yes.
And this group has control over almost the entire world economy.
Maybe what you are saying is right.
But these immense resources.
If they are used properly, then anything is possible.
Governments have their own agenda.
Their own programs.
But at the end of the day...
...it is the individual that matters.
Blue Bird is the
Lashkar's safe house...
...and Professor
Yusuf Malik's house.
Ashiana Bungalow.
Khilji road. Behind Qutub complex.
We cannot raid that place, sir.
What if they press the trigger?
- We don't have an option.
There's one way.
Professor Malik.
- Yes.
I am Iram.
Iram Parveen Bilal.
I want to meet the Colonel.
Who?
You've got the wrong address.
Iram.
Last year, London bombings.
Is the Colonel here or not?
Come in.
The Colonel didn't mention anything about you.
Where is he?
He's gone to the bus stop.
Will be back soon.
How far?
- He'll be back.
Will you have tea?
Yes, thank you.
What is that?
Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323.
Sir, that bus is at Humayun tomb.
Next stop is Red Fort.
Stay at Red Fort, one hour.
- Built in 1638.
Come, ma'am, take care of your belongings.
I am heading towards the bus.
Are you ok?
Sit down.
I am fine, thank you.
I will get biscuits.
She's working for the cops, Professor.
Kill her.
And don't disconnect the phone.
Let it be, I'll do it.
- No.
"I just spoke to the Colonel, you traitor"
Move in. Move in.
Are you okay?
He just called the Colonel.
Triangulate this number.
Triangulating 9810160605.
Sir, this number has been switched off.
Near Pari Chowk, Noida.
I am sending a chopper.
Jimmy,
...get out of the bus.
And find your own way to the target.
No, don't touch the timer until I say so.
"Since Bisleri got popular."
"Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps."
"Since Bisleri got popular."
"Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps."
"Even though farmers produced food-grains."
"They had to commit suicide."
Where to, sir?
- Janpath.
That will be Rs. 200.
Let's go.
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Can I see?
The call's been triangulated in Noida.
Cell tower 26 D. Come on, move.
How far is Noida?
- Five minutes.
Move.
Move.
Move.
Move.
Hello, sir.
Yes, I've left the bus.
Take us to Kinari Bazaar.
Kinari Bazaar.
I'm heading straight.
Please get down.
We've sat down now. Let's go.
It's a smart dress.
But it makes me look fat.
I am going to wear a sari.
I look smart in a sari...
I think this guy is taking us for a ride.
Where are you going?
Turn around.
Take a U-turn.
Can't you hear?
Are you deaf?
Get down at the signal.
- Why should we get down?
I'll make the inspector teach you a lesson.
Look, sir. He's really...
Get down.
What's wrong? Why are you screaming?
What is wrong?
He has the bomb.
Don't give him a chance to press the trigger.
Shoot only if you get a headshot.
Only if you get a headshot.
Not receiving Cam
56 from Barakhambha.
Cam 3 zoom in.
Stay.
And there are passengers.
- He's taken the ITO flyover.
He's entered the one way from the opposite side.
Why aren't you listening?
Oh, God!
We are checking the area around the cell tower, sir.
The mobile phone is switched off.
Frankly he can be anywhere.
Sir Metla is here for a charity program.
Lovely to meet you.
Yes, certainly.
Dr. Ruby.
- Sir Metla.
What are you doing here?
You are here for a charity function.
I don't do charity.
I do investments.
We're getting late.
Good, sir. Good.
Nice seeing you.
Move it. Clear the traffic.
Move them.
They found a dead cabbie near the cell tower...
...there's definitely a connection.
Call the dog squad.
Move. Move. Move.
I lost him.
Iram, come in.
Iram, come in. Iram, come in.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Is there a scheduled time for the helicopter to leave?
We should go now. It's really getting late now.
There was a technical problem, sir.
It's been solved. But we should leave immediately.
Okay, let's go.
I will think about it.
The pilot is the Colonel.
Get in.
Get in.
Stop.
My glasses.
I need my glasses.
Please, my glasses.
Rascal.
Colonel, I am in an ice-cream parlor at Connaught Place.
Nirula's.
Only nine minutes left.
Happy birthday to you.
Everybody out.
Get out, come on.
Everybody out.
Everybody out.
Go, go, go.
Everybody out.
Everybody out.
Darn it.
Sir. I have found the bomb.
It's demanding a password.
Run, run. Vacate the place.
Hurry up.
Come on, come on, come on everybody.
The firing circuit has completely failed.
I will have to open it completely.
Open it.
- That will take time.
At least 15-20 minutes.
Get out.
Ground all choppers, sir. Only four minutes left.
Waiting for coordinates.
Get me the map for outer Delhi.
Fly north by north east, Radial 045.
Fly high for the first two minutes.
Then at 500 feet for the last minute.
Setting course, north by north east.
Radial 045.
You'll see an old copper mine.
The mine is 2000 feet deep
Crash the bomb in the mine.
- Roger that, sir.
It was a privilege serving with you, my boy.
Jai Hind, sir.
Requesting personal time.
Connect me to Iram, sir.
She is in no stage to be moved.
She's losing too much blood.
Iram.
Iram.
Iram, it's Vinod.
Iram.
- Is everything okay?
Under control.
Are you fine?
- I am not going to make it, Vinod.
What happened?
That bastard shot me.
- Where are you hit?
How bad is it?
- Two bullets on the liver.
I've lost lot of blood.
Can you come here? Please.
Can you come here?
I am in the helicopter, with the bomb.
Trying to take it as far away from the city as possible.
Why...
Why can't we diffuse the bomb?
Lt's asking for the password, which I don't have.
Listen to me, Iram.
I had decided...
...that I would try and give you the life you wanted.
I just want you to know that I had decided that.
If there is something on the other side...
Then we'll meet soon.
Just one minute left.
Say something terrific.
Stay with me.
She's bleeding.
Iram.
Press it. Press it.
Password.
Kazan set it in Morocco.
Kazan?
Do you know the password?
Do you know his mother's name?
He killed her himself.
- What?
Who?
- Zilleh.
Zilleh?
Zilleh. Zilleh.
Who's Zilleh?
Iram. Iram.
His pet camel
Her name was Zilleh.
Spell it.
Can you spell it?
Z I L L...
Iram.
- E H.
We did it.
We made it, baby.
Complete the formalities. We will fly her body to Pakistan
You wanted a world...
...where this Rubaiyat is just a book of poems.
Maybe you are in such a world now.
We found this on the Colonel's body.
Possibly his insurance policy.
Check it.
We cannot touch this man.
He's beyond our reach.
And its impossible to prove anything in court.
If anything happens to him.
An accident or...
Cheers.
In the last 48 hours
Pakistan's army has raided...
...training camps and many sleeper cells of Lashkar.
And more than 200 operatives have been killed...
...and around 600 have been arrested.
These raids have...
...served a harsh blow to many terrorist organizations like Lashkar.
Sayyad, don't ask who I am.
Just listen carefully.
I know who's behind the incident that took place in Delhi.
Freddie Khambatta.
- Agent Vinod, sir.
I would like to show you something.
Am I making myself clear?
- Yes.
Lashkar is the most active group these days.
Yes.
The Zeus group doesn't want any publicity.
No comebacks.
I will cover my footsteps.
But what's the guarantee that you will spare me...
...after the job's done?
There'll be 25 million Euros in your bank.
You take care of that.
And let us take care of the world.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
What is this?
Why are you showing this to me?
My granddaughter shows me such videos on Youtube.
Smart idea.
You would've exploded the bomb in Delhi.
And the world would've thought...
...that a group like
Lashkar is behind it.
So Colonel used people like Abu,
Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa.
Put the stamp of
Jehad on the operation.
You wanted to trigger a war between both countries...
...and make millions.
Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod.
But why did you get this here?
Take it to the press.
It'll be fun for a few days.
But now you must excuse me.
I need to... attend a function.
The Zeus group.
Great businessmen like you.
Senators, ex-prime ministers.
I've heard that whenever you meet...
...something strange occurs somewhere in the world.
Some President's death in a plane crash.
A civil war in a small country.
Nuclear blast in New Delhi.
Wow.
Wow, Agent Vinod.
Wow.
You think you know everything.
But I want to add to your knowledge.
A bomb blasts in Delhi.
But the real explosion happens in the stock exchanges of New York...
...London, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Beijing
You would short stocks and make your billions.
But what about the millions that die in both the countries?
What about them?
You know what would've happened to China...
...if the stock market had crashed?
How NATO would've seized
Pakistan's nuclear bombs?
And we could have solved the Iran pipeline situation
These are complex issues.
You are a police officer.
It's beyond your understanding.
You will have to die. Sir Metla.
Today.
You're here to kill me.
I won't kill you, sir.
You're a hero in my country.
And you'll die as a hero.
There'll be roads built in your name.
Stamps issued.
Books written about you...
Goodbye, sir.
Sir Metla will be back soon.
Won't you sit down, sir?
Coffee, please.
What's he doing?
Second cup of coffee, sir.
Sir Metla.
Sayeed Kousar has sent his regards.
Who?
- Lashkar, sir.
Bismillah.
Our news desk has confirmed that sir Jagdeshwar Metla has...
...been assassinated in what appears...
...to be a suicide bombing in central London.
Sir Metla was on his way to a felicitation...
...by the Indo British chamber of commerce.
Initial reports state that Sir Metla had been...
...seen talking to a south Asian man seconds before the explosion.
It appears that Sir Metla was killed by the same terror group...
...that planned a nuclear attack in New Delhi.
It was Sir Metla's heroic intervention that...
...thwarted the well laid plan.
Our correspondent Marge
Atkins is at the site.
Tell us what is happening Marge...
I know you.
You are Freddie Khambatta.
I don't like that name.
So what is your name?
"The bungalow's locked."
"How do I get in?"
"Laila's window is open."
"There's a gutter below it."
"Someone's at the window."
"Laila's having an affair."

"Kisses for everyone else."
"Butjust a pat on my cheek."
"Laila is like a chameleon."
"Like the beats on the drums."
"Leaves her lipstick mark on the cheeks with her smooch."
"My..."

I am smitten by you."
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"
"My darling, after

"Where are you going blowing away my love?"
"P U N G I..."
"I am Laila, I will blow your love away."
"P U N G I..."
"I am Laila, I will blow your love away."
"After making those false promises in English."
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"
"My darling, after
I am smitten by you."
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

For two years.. for the past two years..
..we have been standing near this board.
But there is no trace of a singIe accident
Boman.
- Yes.
Name is there but there's no trace.
Excuse me, Adi.
How wiII we benefit from a car accident?
You are asking after two years.
This is the road where that baId miIIionaire..
..toId us the secret of miIIions.
Oh no!
'In St. Sebastian garden, Goa.. '
'.. under a big W.. a big W there are 100 miIIion hidden.'
'100 miIIion.'
Mama wiII be proud of us.
You made me donate aII the money.
'Come on, Adi, give the money.'
'Why shouId I give the money?
Am I crazy? '
'Give it, Adi, for mama's sake.'
Since then.. day and night we have been keeping an eye..
..on cars passing-by.
Thinking now there wiII be an accident.
Now there wiII be an accident.
Not even a singIe car.
DisgracefuI.
Hey, brother.

Now, there's just one way Ieft.

Oh, we are going to cook omeIet and seII them.
No omeIet, we are going to knockout peopIe. Roy.

You can't hit me.
Oh no.
There they are. Beat them.
Enough. Enough.
No one ever beat us up so badIy.
Adi, be thankfuI that at

Our fate has raped us.
If we had money..
..then we wouId've had so many things.
Yes, car, bungaIow, bank baIance and ma..
Mother.
- Quiet.
Mercedes Benz.
Yes, Mercedes.
Like the one Kabir's sitting in.
Kabir.

Kabir.
- Kabir.
Where did that miserabIe guy get so much money from?
Even he donated his money.
Run. Run, run, foIIow him!
Such a big car.
Such a big office.
How did Kabir become so rich?
LoyaIty, honesty, dedication and responsibiIity.
Today Kabir Naik is rich because of these four quaIities.
And I have seen these four quaIities in the four of you.
Thank you.
And that is why the four of you are here.
Sir has appointed you the chief executive..
..of our next muIti-miIIion venture.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
That's nothing.
Sir is giving you furnished apartments aIong with fixed saIaries.
And yes, everyone wiII have a personaI car as weII.
CongratuIations.
Thank you.
Sir, how do we thank you?
- Just Iike you do.
Look, if the four of you keep working hard..
..then one day I wiII make you partners in this company.
Partners.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
- Thank you.
Okay. Okay. Come on.
It's okay.
Instead of us four taIented peopIe..
..he's making these four fooIs his partner.
It shouId have been us in their pIace.
If we become the partners..
..then we wiII have car, bungaIow, bank baIance.
But how wiII we become partners?
EmotionaI..
- Torture.
Yes, Iet's go.
Adi.
Adi, no. Adi, no. Not this way, Adi.

What are you doing here?
- CIeaning the toiIets.

- Shocked, aren't you?
That why inteIIigent peopIe Iike us..
..are doing such a backward job.
Have courage, Roy, have courage.
We wiII be successfuI.
There's hope in our hearts.
No matter how much it stinks.
Cotton.. just Iike there's cotton stashed in the piIIow..
..there are four things stashed in us as weII.
No, no, no, we are born with it.
Like.. IoyaIty.
- Honesty.
Dedication.
- Deceit.
No, no, not deceit. ResponsibiIity.
Just a minute.
That's what I said.
- And we heard it.
Outside the window, covertIy.
- QuietIy.
You eavesdropped on my conversation..
..and now are putting up a charade here.
It's not a drama but emotionaI torture.
So that you can forget about those four fooIs..
..and make us your partners.
Make your four partners.
- Yes.
Good idea. - Thank you.
If I even appoint you watchmen here..
..it wiII be insuIting to them.
FooIs.
He humiIiated us so badIy.
Now no matter what happens..
..but we wiII be your partners,
Kabir. - Yes.
Otherwise I am the son of two fathers.
And I am the son of three father
I am the son of four fathers.
I am the son of the entire India.
There's no one in the office.
Seems Iike Kabir caIIed us first.
He ought to, after aII we are VIP's.
Very important person.
Now we'II have money, position, power.
Now everyone wiII saIute us and say.. - ScoundreIs!
RascaIs.
You wiII be punished.
EquaIIy.
- Much more than that.
No.
You rascaIs, scoundreIs, fooI, stupid, morons..
I hadn't sIapped you.
You gave a 100 crores estimate to Kabir sir on month end.
Yes. - But the profit was just 99,99,99,000.
That means there was a
Ioss of 1000 rupees.
You.. you deserve one more sIap.
SIap.
- SIap.
Take them away.
- Okay, boss.
Come on.
- Okay, okay.
No, no, no.
Such severe torture for just 1000 rupees.
Kabir sir has appointed four new peopIe in your pIace.
That means us.
- That's why you are fired.
Fired!
And Kabir sir doesn't just say fire.
Then?
- He fires with his gun.
Give me the gun.
You are dirty.
Give me the gun! Gun!
Okay, boss.
Where is he taking it out from?
Gun.
JaIIad.
- Yes, boss.
CIose the door.
- Okay, boss.
Don't kiII us.

Don't shoot us.
Murder. Murder.
Run away.
You won't get anything here except for death.
Run, Arjun, run!
Run!
Just a minute.
Kabir sir.
Look, he is here to kiII us.
Let us go, pIease.
I won't Iet you go Iike this.
See, he wiII kiII us.
I wiII kiII you?
- See, he is teIIing us.
''I wiII kiII you.''
- Shut up, you idiots.
Otherwise I wiII fire you guys.
See he wiII fire at us.
So this is your doing.
Yes.
- ObviousIy.
And untiI you keep caIIing such idiots..

UntiI you don't make us your partners.
Understand.
- Partners.
No.
- No. No vioIence.
Kabir. - PIease.
Nice.
DarIing, what's going on?
Is everything aIright?
Who is she?
She is our madam. Kabir sir's wife.
Wife?
- Yes.
She's his wife.
Sister-in-Iaw!
- Sister-in-Iaw!
Who.. who are they, Kabir?
- Kabir?
Not, Kabir. Ram, and you are Sita.
And we are Ram's younger brothers.
So sweet.
- Thank you.
Just a minute. Ram onIy had three younger brothers.
ReaIIy?
That's okay.
Consider yourseIf Draupadi..
..and us, four pIus one, five Pandavas.
DarIing, you go on, I wiII join you.
Okay, darIing, bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
The four of you managed to barge inside my office.
But if you try to barge in my bungaIow..
..then I wiII punch your face in.
He's very short-tempered.
Kabir, not just your bungaIow but we wiII foIIow you even to heII.
Come on, foIIow him.
Enough is enough, Kabir.
There's a Iimit to everything.
I don't want to discuss this any more.
You understand.
Did you understand anything?
- No. I mean yes.
But, I need some money..
- I said no means no, Kabir.
I give you money every month for the monthIy expenses, isn't it?
Not a singIe penny more.
If I couId get 500,000..
- You won't get five rupees.
DarIing, juice.
He turned out to be a poor beggar just Iike us.
Bye. Bye. - Bye.
He's a beggar and she's poor.
He is Iiving off his wife.
Seven.
Shoe size. Shoe size.
You are Iooking at her shoe size, aren't you ashamed?
She is Iike our sister-in-Iaw.
What a sister-in-Iaw.
Honey, Iisten to me.
Kabir, why don't you understand?
I don't want to have this discussion any more.
The discussion is over.
I am going for a shower.
HeIIo, GuIabo.
- GuIabo.
My, sugar honey, sugar pie, sugar doII, sugar bag.
That scoundreI is having an affair.
That too so sweet.
He wiII die of diabetes.
Idea. Listen.
My wife must have been born after 1000 foxes died.
I am toIerating my wife for money.
Otherwise I wouId have Ieft her Iong back.
I wiII adjust it in the accounts..
..and get your set by tomorrow.
And after that
Iights off, Jacuzzi on.
And have some fun in the Jacuzzi.
Kabir and guIabo wiII be together.
Where is my other phone?
Kabir.
Your mobiIe is right here.
You here.
How did aII of you come here?
And my mobiIe.
- And this mobiIe has an MMS cIip..
..which has Kabir and
GuIabo's conversation.
Yes.
'My wife must have been born after 1000 foxes died.'
'I am toIerating my wife for money.'
'Kabir and guIabo wiII be together '.
Adi, what if sister-in-Iaw sees this cIip?
He wiII be in troubIe.
- Shut up.
You are trying to bIackmaiI me.
- No.
We aren't trying we are doing it.
Quiet!
You think I wiII be scared of you.
- No.
We are sure you wiII be scared.
If you don't make us your partner..
..then we wiII send this MMS cIip on sister-in-Iaw's mobiIe.
Kabir.
The button wiII get pressed.
The button wiII get pressed.
Kabir.
Why am I hiding? You hide.
Kabir, what have you sent?
What a superb joke you have messaged me? - Joke?
Yes. Husbands and the sun are so unfaithfuI.
They come with
'Kiran' (Ray of Iight).
Stay with 'Roshini' (Iight).
And Ieave with 'Sandhya' (evening).
This better be a joke, Kabir.
- Of course, darIing.
If you don't make us your partner..
..then we wiII make a joke out of you in front of your wife.
Yes. - This isn't how one becomes partners.
One has to come to the office and work to become partners.
We wiII sureIy come to the office but you wiII do the work.
And these goggIes are reaIIy nice to watch you do the work.
Can I pIease have it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you. That Iooks cooI.
And to come to the office, we need a car.
The car keys. Because it won't Iook nice if we waIk.
Yes, this is damn cooI.
Get Iost. - Auntie.
This isn't what I thought of you.
Ma'am, I aIways doubted sir.
What did I ever ask for?
That there shouIdn't be any dearth in my Iove.
Instead I got a rascaI.
But I Iove this rascaI, darIing.
I Iove you so much.
My dear sister, do you know who's responsibIe..
..in making me a con.
- Who, brother.
Bachchan sir.
- You mean, Big B.
Yeah!
When the poIice department stopped my promotion..
..and transferred me to YavatmaI.
I had nothing to do there except for watching teIevision.
And everyday at 9 o'cIock Bachchan sir..
..wouId come on teIevision and say..
..''Kaun Banega Crorepati,
Kaun Banega Crorepati.''
That's when I reaIized..
..that its important to be a con first to be a miIIionaire.
And now with the two of you supporting me..
..we three cons wiII make their pIight bad.
But, brother, the other four were reaIIy perfect for our pIan as weII.
We managed to trap them with difficuIty.
They ran away because of these four.
And then they came to me and said..
..pick us, pick us.
So what couId I do?
Last time I was going to have a great time..
..with a huge amount of money.
But my pIan was foiIed because of these four fooIs.
But now.. no goof ups.
My dear sister, you keep pIaying the roIe of my secretary.
And Kamini, you as my strict wife.
What is this nonsense, Kabir?
These four aren't even quaIified.
Kamini, what was that?
That's the first diaIogue of our next scene.
What is this nonsense, Kabir?
These four don't even Iook quaIified.
That's exactIy what
I am saying, ma'am.
Ask them.. who is most quaIified amongst them?
Oh, so you are the most quaIified one?
How educated are you?
- UntiI 10 o'cIock.
UntiI 10 o'cIock?
The schooI started at 9 o'cIock.
After an hour, the principaI understood..
..that I can't study anything.
Did you hear?
- No, no. He is just joking.
We are quaIified. We aIso have a degree.
What degree?
- MMS degree. Isn't it, Kabir?
TeII sister-in-Iaw.
- Yes, yes, MMS, isn't it?
Ya, take me for a ride.
- What?
Is there any such degree?
- Ma'am.
Even if there is such a degree..
..then its useIess for our company.
Look, Iook at their faces.
They Iook Iike crooks.
Excuse me.
- Yes.
Ma'am, fax.
Ma'am, our property..
..which was stuck in IegaI matters for a Iong time..
..has been cIeared.
Now you are the rightfuI owner, ma'am.
Kiya, that's great news.
Kabir, I am so happy.
It was very important for this Iand matter to be cIeared.
But why today? Why?
It's aII because of these.. boys.
They are so Iucky.
You know something, darIing. I Iove them to death.
You are right, Kabir.
Why today? Why now?
These four are Iucky rascaIs.
- RascaIs.
She is caIIing us rascaIs.
- She is aIso caIIing us Iucky.
I have decided.
These four are now our company's 20% partners.
How much do I get then?
- Shut up, shut up.
Ma'am, what are you saying?
Kiya, arrange for a veneration on the Iand.
And invite these three speciaIIy.
After aII they are our Iucky mascots.
Oye Iucky, oye Iucky
Oye Iucky,
Oye Iucky,
Oye ediot oye
They are jacked now.
Come, mister.
The veneration is compIete.
Now hit the pIough on this fieId and begin.
DarIing, Iet these four do it.
Why these four, ma'am?
Your husband shouId do it?
We got this Iand as soon as these four stepped in the office.
So they shouId do this auspicious deed.
You are right, dear.
Come here.
You are so sweet.
Thank you. Hit it here, here. - Okay.
One.. two..
Wow, Adi.
What is this?
- Super VasmoI 33 hair dye.
Shut up, Iet me check.

Oh my, God. This is oiI.
Oh my, God.

Oh my, God. Kiya, did you hear?
Superb, ma'am, superb.

Do it, do it.

DarIing, I was thinking..
- I have aIready thought about it.
From today these four are our company's 40% partners.

Give the phone. Give the phone.

That's enough.
That's enough.
Get out. Get out. Get out.
Kabir.
Stop, Kabir.
I have aIready made a copy of that Kabir.
You are not that strong.. to suppress us.
Very smart.
What now, Kabir?
Bata bhai.

Not shoes.
Bata bhai, your private investor.
Investor, yes
GIory to..
- Batanand Swami.
Bata bhai why are you turning into a saint from an criminaI.
Hey, take it out and give it in my hand. - Yes, boss.
Here.
Hey.. you idiot.
..and the entire gang members.
Open your ears and Iisten carefuIIy.
Now Bata bhai's days of crime..
- Out the window.
But, Bata bhai, why stop committing crimes?
You know yesterday I caIIed up a party and said..
''This is the area's bhai (don) speaking.''
And do you know what he repIied?
- What?
Is your sister's name Area?
- ReaIIy.
Laugh. Laugh. Laugh you scoundreIs.
There's no more respect.
That's why Bata bhai is bidding adieu..
..to the worId of crimes from today.
From today, I wiII onIy speak for discourses.
Devotees, gentIemen.
Bata bhai greets those..
..who have been sitting here for a Iong time.
Sri Ram, the soIo hero of Ramayan.
In the first reeI itseIf he was banished for 14 years.
Mother Sita went aIong for company.
That's where the viIIain made an entry. Ravan.
It rhymes. What is he saying?
He kidnapped mother
Sita from outdoor.
But right then,
Hanuman made a daring entry..
..in the supporting roIe.
He took a bus to Lanka..
..and disrobed Ravan.
- HeIIo. That's wrong.
Draupadi was disrobed.
You are mixing
Ramayan with Mahabharat.
Basher Bokade, bring him to me.
Hey, Iet's go.
Hey, Ganga Jamuna's DiIip Kumar.
You are the area's miIkman, aren't you? - Yes.
So, when you can mix water with miIk..
..then why can't I mix
Ramayan with Mahabharat.
Your point is right.
KaIIu KoyIe, take him at the back and disrobe him..
..and rectify his point as weII.
Why disrobe me? Leave me.
The Ramayan and the Mahabharat are different scriptures.
Hey you fooI, its peopIe Iike you..
..who don't Iet us dons change their profession.
Don't cry, boss.
- He's no saint, he is an imposter.
Hey, siIent movie's dubbing artist.

Even the most courageous wiII feeI timid before you.
And the onIy thing he wiII be Ieft with wiII be..
Bata bhai.
Bag.
- Oh, yes.
Hey, fIop heroes of singIe screen, what is this?

What? - We have aIready said it twice. Are you deaf?
RascaI.
- Just Iike there's advance tax..
..this is advance extortion money.
Bata bhai. Bata bhai.
This is because you don't know us.
We aIways think of the future.
We have.. hit a jackpot on our Iand. Yes, jackpot.
Few days Iater you wiII read in the newspaper..
..that we have become miIIionaires.
Then you wiII start caIIing us.
''Pay us money or eIse we wiII kiII you.''
Extortion money, etcetera, etcetera.
And, Bata bhai, Bata bhai.
You wiII say seven and we wiII say five.
Unwanted bargaining.
That's why advance extortion money.
Hey FiIm Division's gift.
Your expIanation went above my head.
Then wear a heImet.

Sir, middIe finger.

Bata bhai is in the mood to invest in your oiI company.
Thank you. - Open your mouth and teII me how much money do you want?
Bata bhai, 250 crores won't be a big amount for you.
Hey, side hero of a muIti-star cast.
What do you think?
If Bata bhai asks for money in the market..
..he won't be abIe to get 250 crores.
Wait!!
Hey, Farooq facebook.

FIop heroes of a hit fiIm.

Who broke this pipeIine?
Hey, Iower your voIume.

Two Iakhs from Mausin bhai.
Consider this a token of my appreciation.
First Iet us understand what you just said.
Mausin bhai, goons were after us.
But why were the poIice after you?
ActuaIIy my partner
Shabbir cheated me in business.
He deceived me.
There's a Shabbir in his story.
And there's a Kabir in our story.
He pIayed a big game with me.
And you didn't Ieave him aIive.
- No.
Such a smaII punishment for such a big crime.
I kiIIed him.. but a thousand times.
First I ruined his personaI Iife.
And then wrecked havoc on his business.
He hates his Iife much more than he used to Iove money.
..after snatching his happiness, his weaIth.
And now I am going out of India..
Goodbye.
Two Iakhs.
- Two Iakhs.
Bata bhai wiII make two Iakhs out of us.
Mausim bhai.

We don't want two Iakhs.
Take us aIong, pIease.

That's not possibIe.
I cannot take you four aIong.
Why?
- Heard that.
Mausim bhai, we saved your Iife.
So why aren't you saving our Iives now?
Roy, take the dagger out and cut my nerves.
Cut it.
Here.
- Cut it, cut it, cut it.
You have gone crazy.
What are you saying?
Did I raise you for this?
- Adi.
Mausim bhai has refused to heIp us.
So rather than getting kiIIed by our enemies..
..it's best that my friends kiII me.
If it's Iike that,
Adi, then Boman take this.
HoId it.
- And cut it.
Cut it.
- No, Adi.
No, Adi. Brother, your..
Cut it.
Stop.

Thank you very much.

ScoundreIs.
Mausim bhai.
You went there to get his watch.
When he's facing a bad time why does he need a watch?
Kabir wiII go through a bad time when I get hoId of him.
How wiII we get hoId of him?
He must be having a good time somewhere.
He is having a good time right here.
What?
- Yes. There.
These three rascaIs are here.
Let's go find out.
- Yes.
Brother, those peopIe that came in the Iimo. Do you know them?
Yes, they are the new boss.
They bought this casino few days back. - What?
RascaIs, they duped us..
..and bought a casino in
Macau with that money.
I wiII shoot that rascaI Kabir.
I wiII murder that Kamini.
I wiII kiII her.
That wretch Kiya..
- Just a minute, just a minute.
Remember what Mausim bhai said before dying?
Yes, save me, save me.
- Shut up.
Mausim bhai said,
''Such a smaII punishment..''
''..for such a big crime.''
If we want to kiII our enemies..
..then he shouId die thousand times.
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's business Iife.
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's personaI Iife.
We swear.. we wiII turn
Kabir's happiness into sorrows.
We swear.. that we wiII snatch
Kabir's Iphone, Ipod, his item.
Ladies and gentIemen.
Three cheers for my casino.
The Four Jokers.
Today I have a speciaI announcement for aII my guests.
This new year's eve, there wiII be no ruIes.
UnIimited money and unIimited gambIing.
Thank you.
- UnIimited gambIing!
Thank you.
UnIimited gambIing, Kabir?
We wiII need at Ieast 1000 crores in the safe deposit for that.
How wiII we find an investor for so much money?
We wiII have to do something.
That man approaching.
Johnny BonzeIa. The king of casinos.
I want to be bigger than him.
Kabir, congratuIations.
But you better be carefuI.
You are moving way too fast.
You know in trying to beat me..
..you might just Iose this casino.
I wiII beat you 'GanduI'.
- 'GanduI'? Meaning what?
It means pest in our Ianguage.
- Pest.
You are caIIing me a pest.
- Yes. Now get out.
I wiII see you.
- Get out.
I wiII be the number one casino owner.
Want to be number one.
I wiII pee on your face, rascaI.
Kiya, every other person here is an eIigibIe bacheIor.
I want you to..
- Brother.
ActuaIIy you two shouId get married.
And as far as my
Iife-partner is concerned.
Rather than being rich, I am
Iooking for a Iife-partner..
..that's honest, caring and Ioves me very, very much.
Did you have these quaIities when you trapped us, witch?
You wretch.
But, Kabir, why did you name this casino, 'The Four Jokers'.
Come on, Kamini.
We got this casino because of those four jokers.
That's why this casino is caIIed 'Four Jokers'.
No fighting.
No fighting.
Adi, no fighting.
I wiII stamp that pest under my feet.
Why do you keep caIIing him pest?
CaII him earthworm.
It feeIs good when I caII him pest.
We'II feeI good onIy when we ruin those three.
But, Adi, they are aIso very smart.
That's why we have to be over-smart. - Yes.
Just Iike they first won our trust and then broke it. - Right.
SimiIarIy we wiII have to first win their trust..
..and then break it.
What are you saying?
That Kabir isn't bIind.
He wiII recognize us.
He won't recognize us.
Because we wiII don a new
Iook for every situation.
Correct.
- Yes.
But how wiII we change the way we Iook.
Get up, get up.
- I am aIready up, what get up.
'HooIiya' (getup).
Adi, don't abuse me in a Iisp manner.
I can do it too.
You are a 'HooIiya'.
I wiII kiII him first before Kabir.
Adi, controI. ControI.
- What controI?
We are in a pitifuI state..
..and those four are having a gaIa time.
GaIa time.
GaIa time.

What are you doing? Sir..
I am a Sardar and aIso effective.
Sir, job. - So this is the quaIification of your job.
SteaIing.
Sir, I am not trying to prove that what a good thief I am.
Instead I am trying to say that..

Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.
No one can ever steaI in my casino.
Its happening, sir.
On tabIe number seven.
I am the best. I am the best. I am the best.

Favorite cricketer, GanguIi.
Favorite food, Indian ThaIi.
Favorite song.. wait, wait, wait.

You cheat, now I wiII expose your Iarceny.
TotaIIy.. Sir.
I am so sorry.
Chinese cheater, sir.
This is my casino, how dare you?
Now eat Lee's Iead.
You dare point a gun at my boss.
Impudent.
You wiII have to face this Ghanta..
..before kiIIing my master.
Oh!
Amigos, amigos
Oh no.
- Oh no, reaI gun.
He wiII take forever to die.
I wiII bIow his brains out.
Forget it, brother.
Why shoot him again.
He is aIready dying.
Let it be, Iet it be.
He is dying, he is dying.
Hey, you are Sardar speaking Gujarati.
ActuaIIy, sir, when scared different voices come out.
He is dead, forget it.
Let's have a drink.
The rascaI's on vibrator mode.
I wiII finish him.
- No, no, no.
Move.
Kabir. I knew it.
I knew your short-temper very weII.
That's why I took the buIIets out of your gun.
But don't spare this cheater Lee.

Don't spare him.
Roy, do you know how to swim?
- No.
I am sorry. So sorry.
What did you do?
Sir, why do you want to be responsibIe for his murder?
Let me handIe..
But you didn't appoint me on the job.
I am jobIess, sir.
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.
No one can protect our casino better than you.
But, Kabir.. - Kamini, he is a Sardar and aIso effective.
Ghanta Singh, you are hired from today.
Thank you, sir.
I won't spare you.
You threw me down from a 20 storey buiIding.
If I hadn't done that..
..then Kabir wouId have shot 20 buIIets in you.
Look, pIease.
Whatever I did was for your benefit.
Don't say that
I hate the word 'Kiya',
I hate that girI Kiya.
Then you must aIso hate that song.
''Kiya, Kiya, Kiya.. kya Kiya.''
Shut up!
Look, according to the pIan..
..you have to make that girI
Kiya faII in Iove with you.
How is that?
Posing as an animaI.
Listen.
- Yes.
You have to make a wiId entry just Iike him.
That's fine, Adi.
But you teII me..
..why did you get me a
Iadies goriIIa costume.
What difference does it make whether its Iadies or gents.
A goriIIa is a goriIIa.
Its time for Kiya to arrive.
I wiII go aIert Roy and you put on your head.
Best of Iuck.
Boy, return me the head.
Why you.. come here.
Adi, Boman, where are you two?
Wow, Boman, you are so smart.
You aIso sound Iike a goriIIa.
But what are you doing inside?
Seems Iike some dimwit put you inside the cage..
..thinking you are a monkey, isn't it?
Don't worry, I wiII get you out.
Okay.
Go, go, go.
Yes.
AII the best. Boman.
AII set man.
There comes the woman.
Go, man, go, go, go.
No.
Stop.
What man.
Are you a goriIIa or a jungIe idiot?
She is a woman.
Women are Iike Mother India, Henna,
Chandani, Biwi No.1.
Women are 'BaIika Vadhu', 'Na Aana
Iss Desh Mein Laado', 'Uttaran'.
Give respect, man, take respect.
If you don't respect women..
..then that wiII be reaIIy bad.
Seems Iike you don't understand.
Now I wiII make you.. understand.
''AppIause. AppIause.''
You are bIack, I am bIack.
Yet you troubIed this woman.
This isn't possibIe as
Iong as Tukya is there.
Did you understand?
Did you understand?
Good.
You are showing your true coIors again.
You won't understand this way.
Take this.
Take it, take it, take it.
My dear.
You are so mischievous.
ReaI goriIIa.
You monkey, wiII you kiII him?
''Your Iips are wet.''
''My heart is thirsty.''
''You are my oasis.''
''Spend a night with me.''
''I wiII Iove tiII dawn.''
Stop it.
He turned out to be the
Emraan Hashmi of goriIIas.
He kept kissing me for two hours. Two hours.
Be thankfuI that..
..he didn't turn out to be the Shakti Kapoor of goriIIas.
Otherwise something eIse wouId've sweIIed up..
..instead of your Iips.
This.. this is Manav's fauIt.
He made the reaI goriIIa come after me.
Yes, we shouIdn't invoIve him in any pIan.
Sorry, guys, I am not so smart.
I don't know who and what I start seeing.
Look, that girI that's approaching Iooks Iike Kiya.
Sister, where is room number 3C.
Run. Run.
- Run.
Oh that goriIIa kiIIed me!
Hi.

This is for you.
Thank you.

No, no, it was my duty to rase you.
What?

So, how can you speak Hindi?

He was an Indian.
And myseIf, Tukaram Sagaran KaIe.

Tukya.
You Ianded in a soup because of me.
Don't worry, you can compensate for it.
Feed me this soup.

Now I wiII Iook after you untiI you don't recover compIeteIy.
Liar.
You mean reaIIy.
Yes.
No!
No.
What happened?
Don't you Iike me?

And once I make a commitment in Iife..
..then I don't Iisten to any rascaI.
Another commitment.
- Yes.
Who is he?
TeII me who he is?
Him. It's him.
''Look at them. They are dew drops.''
''Don't Iet these stars scatter on the fIoor.''
My younger brother, Dodo.
He was affected by chicken guinea..
..since then he Iost aII his quaIities.
Since then he keeps pIaying with his marbIes.
He has Iost his marbIes.
He has Iost his marbIes.
This is a reaIization of dreams.
This is the uItimate..
I fuIfiII his desire of even swatting a fIy.
I am scared, Kiya.
I am scared that if I don't pay attention to my onIy brother..
..then this Dodo might be Iost.
Tukya, now I respect you much more.
Your brother..
- Is right here.
Hi.
I am Jojo. His brother.
What is he doing here?
- How do I know?
How sweet.
But, Tukya, you said that you have onIy one brother.
That's correct.
He is my officiaI brother.
And he's my unofficiaI.. useIess brother.
UnofficiaI.
My father had a one night stand with some bIack woman.
So he is the symboI of that bIemished deed.
My step-brother.
Jojo KaIe.
But a brother is after aII a brother.
And these two useIess boys..

Nope, I don't know this Gujarati.

But I know that Gujarati.
Oh no, where did he come from?
HeIIo, Mr. BonzeIa.
- HeIIo, my dear friend.
And you are?
- He's my brother. Moti.
He knows BonzeIa.
I onIy taIk to him through phone.
And that's why BonzeIa recognizes him and not me.
But now Johnny, this deaI is over.
- DeaI.
BaIdy, to heII with you.

Fine, I won't go as weII.

And taIk to me with damn respect.

Sister. Not a confidante or a companion.
I want to be your partner.
Kabir, I never imagined that you wiII cheat me.
Kamini. Kamini, Iisten to me.
Thank God you are here, Kiya.
Try to expIain to Kamini.
She thinks I am a cheater.

And he has murdered none other than my husband, Tukya.
He aIso kiIIed poor Dodo and Jojo.
How couId you, brother, how couId you?
Kiya, Iisten to..
That's why I am here to curse you..
Don't you dare give anything more to sir?
Sir has aIready had enough.

Let's save the profession now.
Okay.
But how wiII we get

You Iose my money. You wiII Iose your Iife.
'Kabir, you wiII sureIy Iose your Iife.'
'Because we are going to get that 1000 crores.'
But how wiII I get those 1000 crores.

After that you come there as cIeaners..

Who ruined me?
What the heII is going on?
Kabir.
Roy.
I am not Roy.
My name is Lee.
Now eat Lee's Iead.
Take this weaIth, take this fame.
And take this woman as weII.
RascaI, sister-in-Iaw shouId be respected and not wooed.
Sir, I am a Sardar and aIso effective,
AII characters are fictitious.
And bear no resembIance to any person Iiving or dead.
SpeciaI thanks to Bigg
Pictures and T-Series group of..
Zip it.
In short, Mr. Kabir.
You are ruined.
I don't beIieve it.
This isn't possibIe.
You can't ruin me.
This means, Kabir, the one who snatched your sister's happiness.
Are us.
Hey, Naik.
Those who separated you from your wife.
Are us.
And those who stoIe your money, pubIic's money..
..Johnny's money from your casino.
Are us.
I don't regret that I was fooIed.
But I regret that you fooIs fooIed me.
I see.
Now watch as we do another fooIish thing.
HeIIo, is this PameIa,
MandeIa, BundeIa.
No, this is Johnny BonzeIa.
- Yes.
Johnny BonzeIa, do you want Kabir dead or aIive?
I want Kabir aIive so that I can kiII him. - Yes, come fast.
I wiII kiII you both.
What is happening?
Sir, its action repIay, sir.
It's the same whiskey, sir, and the same piII.
That's the sofa, sir, faII on it.
I am feeIing so good..
..after ruining Kamini,
Kiya and this 'GanduI'.
Yes.
1000 crores are waiting for us.
What wiII be my share?
- Shut up, Manav.
Now we wiII be ahead..
..and the worId wiII be after us.
Wow, Adi, you are so smart.
Adi.
What is happening?
Adi, seems Iike they are showing a fiIm.
Oh no, that's us.
- Yes.
And those who stoIe your money, pubIic's money..
..Johnny's money from your casino.
Are us.
Oh shit.
RascaI, you definiteIy forgot to switch off the cameras.
I switched off the cameras. I swear.
There are no cameras here yet someone fiImed us.
Adi, you are not so smart.
- Shut up.
But who did this?
Kabir.
- Kamini.
Kiya.
- These rascaIs did this.
FooIs, you think you duped us.
But we.. duped you instead.
- Us?
Yes. DoubIe DhamaaI.
That means you three knew about our pIan.
Of course, Tukiye.
What did you think?
You didn't break the difference between us..
..and separated a brother and sister.
And, Boman, you.
This boy's hot.
Make me your partner.
And what did you think?
You can ruin us posing as Ghanta Singh. - No.
Good shot, Kabir.
What?
- BaIIs to me.
First we duped you of 250 crores.
And now 1000 crores.
But just a minute.
We have those 1000 crores.
And we wiII never teII you where we have hidden it.
What now? What now? What now?
Who wiII teII us now where are the 1000 crores.
I wiII.
Mausim bhai, you are aIive.
No matter how iII one wishes for me..
..but my fate's aIready decided by Kabir boss.
Kabir boss?
The one that brought you to India from Macau.
Are us.
The one that kept an eye on your every move, every pIanning.
Are us.
The 1000 crores that you hid in Rodex dockyard.
The one that transferred it to Kabir Naik's Swiss account.
Are us.
So?
Surprised, aren't you?
Traitor.
You were supporting them aII the time.
On that note I remembered.
When someone's going through a bad phase.
He doesn't need a watch.
Leave the watch, rascaI.
We have Iost the money, at Ieast Ieave the watch.
But, Kabir, why us?
It was your fauIt.
I warned you so many times..
..that don't come to my home, don't come to my home.
I wiII make you pay.
But you..
Kabir. Kabir. Kabir. Kabir.
Now you are paying for it.
First Bata bhai.
And not Johnny BonzeIa.
- BonzeIa?
Yes, you invited your own death.
He must be on his way.
And after this, we wiII show him your fiIm..
..in this red Iounge.
And then he wiII make smaII pieces of your body.
Brother, what's wrong with them?
When someone's scared..
..they start speaking in every Ianguage.
Isn't it?
- Yes.
Kabir boss.
Forgive us.
Cops and thieves are brothers.
We were friends.
We were once partners.
Fine, I wiII Iet you go.
I wiII give you one chance to fIee.
BonzeIa must be on his way.
And Iisten.
I have arranged for a taxi for you outside.
Get up.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Just a minute.
- Yes, Kabir boss.
Remember one thing before Iocking horns with me.
I mastered this Iine, way before you were born. - Yes, yes.
Let's go, Iet's go.
FuII speed, fuII speed.
- Start it. Start it.
Hey, do I Iook Iike a
C grade movie heroine..
..who wiII start instantIy.
Bata bhai.
You scoundreIs, you are having a good time in Macau..
..after duping me of my money.
No, we didn't dupe you of your money.
That rascaI Kabir did.
Shut up.
Kabir Naik is God father.
Like 'Dharmatma' (a Hindi movie on the Iines of Godfather).
Like 'Dayawan' (a Hindi movie on the Iines of Godfather).
HaiI Kabir.
Kabir.
Yes, Kabir.
I Iost everything because of the four of you.
Thanks to this great man who brought me to Macau..
..and gave me this taxi for making a Iiving.
And today he caIIed on my phone..
..that, ''There's a speciaI fare for you''.
Wow, that's reaIIy fare.
Now it's DDLJ for you.
- DDLJ?
I wiII kiII you.
RascaIs.
Run, he wiII shoot.
Johnny.
- BonzeIa.
Brothers.

One day the entire worId wiII be after us. - Quiet.
That scoundreI ruined us.
And now we ruin him.
That rascaI duped us twice.
Just watch, in the next part we wiII dupe him three times.
