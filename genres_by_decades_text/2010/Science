Hello, my name is Dr. Mercurio Arboria, and I am the founder of the Arboria Institute.
It has long been my dream to find the perfect way for people to achieve simply... happiness, contentment,
These seem to be things that strangely elude us all, but it doesn't have to be that way.
We at Arboria have found a path to achieve them.
Here at the Institute, we are in the forefront worldwide in neuro-psychology and new therapeutic technologies.
Dr. Barry Nyle, our head of research, myself, and our dedicated team of herbalists, naturopaths, and healers have found a way to make that dream a reality.
Through our unique blend of benign pharmacology, sensory therapy, and energy sculpting, we can guide you gently along the path to a new, better, happier you, all in the comfortable surroundings of our state-of-the-art facility and our award-winning gardens.
We invite you to join us... and find out for your... self.
Warm her up.
Special 1-1-8-3.
Hello, Elena.
How are you today, hmm?
How are you feeling?
Have you had... any headaches?
You can tell me.
Your readings are relatively stable.
Very good.
That's very, very good.
You know, this is always the highlight of my day.
Rosemary.
Rosemary.
Oh.
Barry.
I didn't hear you come in.
Been sleeping long?
No...
Um...
- I wasn't sleeping.
- Hmm.
I was... meditating.
Oh, you were meditating, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
If you're hungry, there's some brown rice and steamed asparagus in the refrigerator.
Wow, that sounds really good.
No, I'm not hungry... thank you.
Okay.
It's been a long day.
So, um,
I'm just going to hit the hay early.
Okay.
Good night, Barry.
Good night, Rosemary.
Night Mode.
Rest peacefully and reflect.
Aah-ah-ah!
I am so sorry that you were never able to meet your mother.
She was a very beautiful woman.
She was a very desirable woman.
Oh...
Hey, would you, uh... would you like to have a photo of her?
Would you like that?
Because you may just find one in your room, hmm.
You know, you are looking more and more like your mother every day.
You look tired today.
It's easy to become disillusioned when you don't know who you are... or what you are.
I know who I am.
That's what gives me my confidence... and my power.
And I know who you are, too, Elena.
I can guide you towards that achievement... to find your inner strength and your inner power.
We all have other forms... and your inner self... needs another to complete it.
I... can help you do that.
Oh...
You just... have to let me...
I... want... to see... my... father.
Oh.
Please.
Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena.
Elena, you know you can't.
You're a very sick girl, Elena.
You're not well.
This... world... is in chaos, Elena.
These are... times of, uh, great uncertainty and terrible danger.
And you are not ready.
You're just not well.
Don't worry, Elena, you'll see him again one day.
I promise.
Piece of shit.
What?
Rosemary.
Yeah.
We do have a system in place.
Yes, a comprehensive list has been compiled.
Mm-hmm. I see.
That's fine.
Rosemary, why don't you answer the fucking phone?
Margo.
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my... attention, Margo...
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my attention that...
Elena may be hiding an illicit object from us.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
So...
Keep your eyes peeled.
Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will.
Good.
Very good.
Oh, Dr. Nyle?
Yeah.
Uh, how do you think she would have come into possession of the object?
I don't know, Margo.
I don't know.
But I'm looking into it.
Day Mode.
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow.
Good morning.
Hope you're hungry.
Looks better than usual today.
What have you got there, a special picture?
Let me see.
Oh, come on, I'm just curious.
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?
Who is this?
Is it your mother?
Where is she?
Did she die?
Good.
Enjoy your dinner.
Stop.
Please stop.
Mercurio.
Are you awake?
Dr. Arboria.
Barry?
B-Barry, is that you, my friend?
Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me.
Ah, oh...
Wonderful.
Come closer so I can see you.
It's wonderful to see you again.
You're looking well, my friend.
Thank you, Dr. Arboria.
So are you.
Oh, Barry, there's... no need to flatter an old man.
I know I-I've... seen better days.
Besides... the trappings of the mortal world are... but a distraction, wouldn't you say?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Yes.
What really matters... the part of ourselves we must nurture the most... is here.
I couldn't agree more.
Would you mind... assisting me?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Aren't these videos of the nature, ha, beautiful, Barry?
They make me remember a simpler time.
Yes, Dr. Arboria.
Me too.
You are about to embark on a great journey.
Are you ready, my friend?
I am ready.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Bring home the mother lode, Barry,
Barry, Barry, Barry.
Your mother's reabsorption into the cycle of life won't be for nothing, my darling Elena.
You will be the dawning of a new era for the human race and the human soul.
Let the new age of enlightenment begin.
No, Barry,
I don't like to see the... on my arm.
Of course.
How is my darling Elena?
Well, Dr. Arboria.
She's very well.
That's wonderful.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Yes, yes.
Oh, that's wonderful, Barry.
Yes.
That's so... wonderful.
Isn't it... beautiful?
Yes.
It is.
The dormant volcano,
Haleakala Crater.
Mark Tain described sunrise here as "the sublimest spectacle
I have ever witnessed."
To the west of Maui lies Molokai.
Except for a few beautiful resort hotels, the modern world has touched Molokai less than any of the other vacation islands.
Aloha means welcome.
It also means love... and all too soon... farewell.
Rocket launchers, while the Soviets have produced more than 13,000, a staggering 14-to-1 ratio.
They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability, and they haven't stopped now.
But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own.
As the Soviets have increased their military power, they've been emboldened to extend that power.
They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies.
The following aerial photographs, most of them secret until now, illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home...
The Devil's Teardrop.
Barry?
Barry!
Oh.
Barry, you startled me.
I thought you were an intruder.
What are you doing?
Barry, you're not wearing your appliances.
I don't want to wear them any more.
But...
It's just you haven't let me see you... without them in a long time.
Where did you get that outfit?
Has something happened?
Sometimes...
Sometimes I... l forget... how hard it is for you.
I'm sorry.
I...
I...I should have been there for you more.
Barry?
Are... Are you okay?
I...I'm not...
I'm... I'm not... I'm not okay.
I went to another world, Rosemary.
I see what others cannot see.
Please.
I looked into the eye of the god.
It looked right back through me.
It looked through everything.
Rosemary, it was so, so, so beautiful.
Like a black rainbow... and it chose me.
It chose to reveal itself to me.
You're nothing.
You're less than nothing.
Just... spit in the wind.
Let go of me.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm going to set you free.
Elena...
Elena?
Elena?!
You are doing so good.
Julie comes walking up, and, um... like, I can tell just by looking at her she totally, fuckin', she totally wants to pork me.
Oh, you're so full of shit.
What would she want with that two-inch little blood bat?
Fuck, my left ball hurts a little.
I gotta take a leak.
Thanks for telling me.
Get bent, you fat fuck!
Ohh...
What the fuck?
Yo!
Yo?
Where is she?
I don't know.
I don't...
I don't know.
I don't know.
You fucked her.
No, I...
No...
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't fuck...
You fucked her.
No, I didn't! I didn't.
You fucked her.
No...
No...
You fucked her.
No, no!
Shut up!
You look so beautiful when you sleep.
Sweet, sweet Elena.
Well, I found you.
It's okay.
Come to me, okay?
Elena, come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Elena, come to me.
Elena?
Elena.
Come to me.
Come.
Come to me.
Come to me!

Do you read?...
Do you read?
Eva, we've got to go now!
Now, now!
- Come on, Eva!
Come on, hurry!
Come on, run!
Eva, come on!
Come on, Eva.
We don't have time.
We don't have time.
- Come on, Eva!
- Get out the door!
- Run!
- Eva!
- Go, go, go, go!
Mommy!
Get back!
Go on, go!
Hold on to me.
Let there be light.
Yeah.
Not exactly the Garden of Eden.
After a blast, everything gets vaporized and sucked up into the atmosphere.
And it rains back down to earth... as radioactive dust.
Number one rule:
No one opens that door till the radiation clears.
You understand me?
You want to survive, you listen to me.
Jesus!
Someone get the lights!
- You okay? You okay?
- Someone get the lights!
- Calm down. Calm down.
Don't touch that.
Holy shit, it's the dust!
It's the dust!
That dust is from the inside.
The bitch is sealed tight.
What was that?
Another bomb?
That was our building coming down.
How the fuck do you know that?
I don't want to be down here.
I want to go now.
I know, sweetie.
But Uncle Mickey says we have to stay.
- Why?
- Because your face will melt off and your hair will fall out.
She's a little girl.
I was just fucking around.
- So that was a nuke?
- Definitely.
Fucking rag-heads.
- We got to stay down here?
- Bet your ass we do.
That door stays sealed until the radiation clears.
And how long's that gonna take?
When I say.
What's the plan, Mickey?
Well, my plan was to build a fallout shelter and take it easy while my pain-in-the-ass tenants barbecued above me.
Does anybody's cell phones work?
No, there's no signal.
- I fucking lost mine.
- You lost it?
Is that a radio?
Give it a try.
Cocksucking jack-off.
- Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello, do you copy?
What's down here?
As you see, just a bunch of storage cells full of junk.
Hey, uh... uh, it's Mickey, right?
Yeah.
Why do you have so many mattresses?
Because I'm the super of a goddamn apartment building.
So why do you have so many mattresses?
What the fuck do you care?
I sell them on the Internet.
Turkish bath in here.
Sorry, ladies, no running water to wash your panties.
Toilet's on the left.
It's septic, so after you finish, throw some lime on top of it.
That's fucking disgusting.
It's called saving water.
Sure, whatever.
I've got to take a dump.
What's in here?
That's my room.
Nobody goes in there but me.
Mama, I'm hungry.
Uh, Mickey... do you have anything to eat?
The food is adequate, I hope.
Don't thank me all at once.
No, the food's good.
Thanks, Mickey.
- Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
- Shut up back there.
Hello?
We have survivors in a building on the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
I repeat, the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
Do you copy?
Do you really have to smoke that thing?
I mean, there's already so much dust in here.
So when can we go up?
When I say so.
Fuck it.
Ade, come on, let's go.
Adrien, come on.
Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.
Let's go. Fuck it.
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from the door.
I won't tell you again.
- I told you!
- Josh!
- Look out!
- Get away from the fucking door!
- Get away from the goddamn door!
- Come on!
Go ahead.
Shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?
God damn it.
- Fucking...
Fucking big man with that ax, huh?
Keep pushing me, Mickey.
Keep fucking pushing me, you're gonna see what happens.
Ever see what happened to those poor Japanese bastards... after we dropped
Little Boy on Nagasaki?
The skin melting off their bones.
Faces like roadkill.
Lucky ones died in the blast.
And those kids in Chernobyl... eyes and... ears.
Shit growing all over 'em.
Tumors the size of grapefruits popping out of their necks.
Enough, Mickey.
We get it.
What you need to get is if that dust gets in here, we're all fucked.
Hope not.
Come here, honey.
Let me braid your hair.
Can I borrow that, please?
Of course.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
You kept it.
Of course I did.
Eva,
I'm sorry if I've been acting a little bit nuts.
I'm just trying, you know, to keep it together.
I guess that's what survival is, just trying to keep it together.
But I love you.
And you love me.
And that's what's going to pull us through this nightmare.
It'll make us better parents.
Eva.
- Eva.
- What?
Come on, honey.
Just one more bite.
I want to go home.
Do you want me to try and warm them up for you?
We are going to die, aren't we?
No, honey, we're not going to die.
We're going to live.
Let's just do our meditation, okay?
Shut your eyes.
Really picture the beautiful light and how good it makes us feel.
Let's do that right now, okay?
Come on.
- Shut your eyes.
- It doesn't work.
- It does work.
- I want to go home.
Wendy, you just have to be patient, okay?
And then it'll get better outside.
And then somebody'll come down and they'll help us.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Thank you.
Gonna have to eat this shit every day?
What'd you say?
What?
I give you food, shelter, and that's what you say?
Fuckers come down here, expect me to take care of you.
What do you contribute?
What'd you bring to the fucking party?
Take it easy, Mickey.
All my family and friends are probably dead, and all you can talk about are fucking beans?
Come on, Mick!
Are we really supposed to rely on this guy?
- Sam.
- No, no, no, no, really, really.
How long can you keep us alive in this... in this...
- Shit hole.
- Yes, exactly.
You know what?
This is a fucking shit hole, man.
Calm down. Sam...
No. No, I'm sorry.
I won't stop.
- Stop.
- I won't stop because I want someone to do something, that's all.
- I need someone to do something.
- Sam, calm down.
- No, I won't calm down because I...
- Sam.
Sam, please stop.
Stop!
- Do something, man. Come on!
- Sam, please stop.
Instead of just sitting around waiting to fucking die.
Don't be scared, Wendy.
Uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.
And you're a big girl, aren't you?
Want to see a magic trick?
I'm gonna take my thumb off for you, all right?
Yeeow!
God, that hurts.
Seen that one before?
Okay, let me think of another one.
Making your cigar disappear?
Oh, shit.
Shit.
It's a rescue.
Down here!
Down here!
- Cut the lights.
- What the hell for?
Just do it.
You guys, what's going on up there?
Hey, okay, we're civilians, all right?
Okay, we're all on the same side, right?
- Whoa, what are you doing?
Didn't you hear him?
Mommy!
Help me!
No!
- No!
- Help me!
Wendy!
No, no!
No! No!
- No!
- Get back.
Go, go, go! Run!
God!
We've got another
2-8-Baker.
Give me the lock!
Give me the lock!
- What lock?
- Get me the chain!
- I don't need your help.
- Get out of the way.
Come on, come on.
Put the chain on there.
- Mickey!
- Hey, Mickey!
I need some help.
Adrien got shot.
- Put him down over here.
- What? Okay.
- Whoa, whoa.
Hey, somebody fucking get something. He got shot!
- Oh, shit.
- I got to look.
Oh, shit, Bobby.
- What the fuck?
- Somebody get a medical kit.
Thank you.
- I got it. I got it.
- I don't know what to do.
- I got it. I got it.
- There's nothing here that's usable.
It's all from, like,
1984 or something.
- You gotta take the bullet out, right?
- It's gonna sting, okay?
All right.
Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.
- You're gonna be okay, man.
- He's gonna die.
- He's fine.
- He's gonna fucking die.
Shut up!
He's not gonna fucking die.
What do you want me to do?
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, all right?
- Arch your back. Just lean a bit.
- Come on.
- Almost got it.
- Almost? He's gonna be all right?
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He's gonna be okay.
You're lucky it didn't hit the artery.
- He's gonna be okay.
- Okay, you got to clean that out.
I got it. Thank you.
Come over here.
Come over here.
Okay?
Put your hand on the back there.
Press hard on the front, keep your hands on the back.
- That's fine. That's good.
- Yeah.
Just like that.
He'll be all right.
Where's Sam?
- Hold this.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Hold this as hard as you can.
- I'm here. I'm here. I got it.
Sam. Sam.
You okay?
You hurt?
You're alive.
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Looks like some sort of biohazard suit.
It's a radiation suit.
Bet we got hit by one of those loose nukes I've been reading about.
It's just a matter of time before one of them hajis got their hands on one of them.
So you're saying it's the Arabs?
Of course they're Arabs.
They've been at war with us for 20 years.
It's just that we've been too busy stuffing ourselves at the trough to notice.
We should have wiped them off the map when we had the chance.
Now it's probably too fucking late.
Oh, shit.
Okay, that's disgusting.
Let me guess, North Koreans.
- You're a fucking idiot.
- Get out of here.
Oh, fuck!
Holy shit.
Grab the tape.
I got her.
All right. Okay.
I got her. Ow!
All right, all right.
Take it easy.
Grab her arms.
Put her in the storage room.
Come on.
Get the door.
Get the door.
No!
Top rations.
Mickey's orders.
I'm fine. You take it.
You take it.
Can you make anything out?
Only thing I caught was something about finishing up the sweep.
And they're American accents.
Turn off the fucking radio, man.
That's what got us in trouble in the first place.
Hey, Mickey, what is that in your pocket?
Whether it's making a damn fine sausage or exterminating an entire race of people, those Germans don't fuck around.
You're holding out food on us now?
I got a couple of bits and pieces in my room.
It's my place.
It's my right.
- Just go back to your room.
- Damn it!
Has anyone fed Marilyn?
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Don't waste that.
What's so funny?
What?
What's so funny?
Oh, nothing.
Just what you said and how you said it.
"Has anyone fed Marilyn yet?"
Like she's your fucking dog.
He gets it.
Show some respect.
She just lost her kid.
Go back to sleep, Adrien.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
She's pissed.
You've got something on your face.
Other side.
That's it.
She's all that's good in me.
I'm sorry.
- Too risky.
- What do you mean it's too risky?
Whatever's in the air outside, it's in here.
Your goddamn duct tape won't make any difference.
At least we can find out what's going on out there even if we don't find her kid.
- You're volunteering?
- I'm volunteering.
He's volunteering.
I say if he wants to go, let him go.
- Let me go. Come on.
- I don't trust you coming back.
What is your problem with me?
- He's got a problem with everybody.
- What about Josh?
- No. Fuck, no.
- Me?
- What about Josh?
- You want me to go?
He ain't got the brains and that faggot ain't got the balls.
- He'll come back for his brother.
- Thanks, Mickey.
I'll go.
No, no, no, Eva.
Eva, you can't be serious.
- I'll go.
- Don't be stupid.
- I'll go.
- You happy, Mick?
You a punk. You know that?
You a punk.
When you ain't got no ax in your hand, then you got something to say.
I don't think he's gonna like what he finds out there.
At least we have to try.
Glove.
- How's your tube?
- Tube is good.
Excuse me.
Do you have air?
Is it working?
- You got one more to go.
- Is the compressor gonna work?
- Yeah, it's fine.
- There it is.
- Good to go?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Promise me you'll bring her back.
I'll do my best.
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's do it. Let's go.
Let's do it.
What the hell is that?
Hey, Josh.
Don't worry, man.
I... I got this.
Wendy.
Hold it.
Go.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What did you see?
- You're okay.
- I think I got two of 'em.
- What did you see?
- Where's your gun?
They got this... this lab set up there.
It's like... it's like...
- Josh, what else?
- Like what?
- What else?
- What do you mean what else?
That's it.
There's no survivors.
There's no other civilians.
There's no fucking Red Cross.
I don't know if they're army.
I don't even know if they're American.
I'm sorry.
They're coming back.
No.
They're welding us in.
- How are you holding up?
- Uh, I'll live.
Delvin gave me his pain meds.
Mind if I take a look?
I just want to clean it.
You know it's gonna sting a little.
- Sorry.
You a nurse or something?
No.
You're just gonna have a nasty scar.
Yeah, well, chicks dig scars, right?
You lived below us, right?
Yep.
Was that you who played guitar?
Yeah. Did that annoy you?
No.
No, I actually really liked it.
Helped me sleep sometimes.
It keeps most people awake.
Not me.
Is everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Ugh, how can you eat with that smell?
We've got to get rid of those bodies.
How, exactly?
Chop 'em up, toss 'em down the septic.
Should have tried harder to get that door open.
That door is welded shut.
We should have put the bodies out when Josh went out.
Shame we let those bodies go rotten.
What do you mean?
You ever heard about that rugby team that survived the Andes?
Their plane crashed.
They were forced to eat their friends and family.
They survived up there for months.
They ate everything... ears, toes, assholes.
Uh-huh, arms, legs, brains, the spleen.
The only thing they didn't eat was the penis.
If worse comes to worst, you all have full permission to eat my body.
Yeah, you do.
But not my penis.
Nobody... nobody but nobody
- eats Bobby's penis.
What's that for, Mickey?
Uh-uh.
Delvin?
Well, yeah.
Fuck, yeah.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Come on.
I can do this, man.
I got this.
But can he live with it?
- Hey, Bobby?
- I got this, man.
Yeah, I'll be... fine.
It's just like cutting lumber.
I'll start with the arms.
I'll just get my swing down.
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.
Chop a body from head to toe.
It's blunt.
Man, what you doing in here?
What?
How did you get in here, man?
I heard you.
- When did you come in here?
- Fuck off.
How did you get in here?
What you got in your pocket?
Punk.
I was dreaming about Mom.
You think she's okay?
I don't care.
She's your mom.
She's not mine.
Just 'cause she cut my sandwiches...
- Hey, Adrien.
- Yeah?
I only went out there to see if there's a way out for us.
Hey, was Mickey an aviator or something?
Look at these.
What the hell's going on in here?
Come on, Mickey, we're just looking for some escapism, all right?
I told you from day one that this was my room and you were to stay out.
Your casa is our casa now.
I don't know what you're talking about, but you're gonna regret this.
This is my ball.
You got it out of my apartment?
- I got it out of your ass.
- You got it out of my apartment.
Hey, he's got forks.
- Adrien.
- I've been looking for this ball.
Don't need to use your dirty fingers any... hey!
- This is a very valuable ball.
- You got it fixed.
Hit down here, come this way, and jab real hard and start firing like this.
Now if they're behind you and they have a gun behind you...
- This is amazing.
- ...what you want to do is feel that tip.
Once you feel it, come to the outside.
The gun will discharge this way.
Take your arm, take both their hands, pull with this hand, and go forward and you'll take the gun away.
All right, soldier, fight safe and come back to the United States.
- Oh, another one?
- Mm-hmm.
- Where the hell did you get that one?
- It's the last one.
Come in.
Hi.
Here's the makeup.
Thanks.
Makeup.
Hey, listen, Marilyn.
You know, if you need to talk about anything, anything like that, I'm here.
You know?
'Cause...
I'm sure she's better off than we are right now.
- What are you talking about?
Wendy.
Eva.
You are a very beautiful girl.
And I know you know what men are like.
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think's gonna happen the longer that we stay down here, huh?
What do you think is already happening?
- I don't know.
- I do.
Listen, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here, all right?
Don't you think you should just be a little nicer to the rest of the boys?
Especially Josh.
Fucking hands off me.
All you knew we had was this much?
That's all there is!
What do you want me to do?
- That's not all there is.
- That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.
That's impossible. There is no way we can survive with that.
No way. No way.
You got us into this situation, now fix it.
I got us into this situation?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I was rationing them.
We're gonna fucking starve to death, Mickey.
We're gonna die of thirst, Mickey.
Where's the food?
What do you want me to do?
I'm not your nanny, you arrogant prick!
I'll bet you're just waiting for one of us to die so you can have all the food that you can fucking eat, huh?
- Oh, shit. What are you...
What is your problem, Mickey?
What is your problem?
My problem is you!
- You're fucking dead.
- And you, and you!
- You're fucking dead, Mickey.
- You're my fucking problem!
- Get back. Get out of here.
- You get out of here!
- Take a walk.
- You get out of here.
- It's my fucking...
- Take a fucking walk!
Guys, please.
Delvin, come on.
You see he's the only one not dropping any pounds?
Always stuffing his pig face.
I'm telling you, that motherfucker is up to something.
Stop playing around with that.
Okay? I'm trying to talk to you.
What do you want to do, Josh?
I want to get that fucking door open,
- even if we rip it off its hinges.
- Fucking-A right, man.
Do you agree with everything my brother says?
You mean your half-brother, right?
What, you don't agree?
Have you looked at us?
Huh?
Look at me.
We're dying in here.
Where would you rather be?
Door's welded shut.
We got one working suit.
There's not a lot of options.
There's always options.
I knew you had some stuff in here somewhere.
You crazy fuck.
It's a peace offering for...
Thank you. Uh-huh.
Back up.
Back up and open it.
All right.
Move over so I can see it.
Start again.
Don't give me an excuse to use this. Open it.
Got it.
Now push it open.
- Where's it lead to?
- The fucking White House.
- Where are the lights?
- There ain't no fucking lights.
Don't you fuck with me.
Oh, man.
Help!
It's Delvin and Mickey.
Holy shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?
This motherfucker, he comes in here and he sticks a Taser in my face, and he said he was gonna kill me unless I gave him the rest of the food and water.
Then he... he goes for the gun.
I caught him off guard.
Then we started fighting over the gun and it went off.
- It went off?
- Yeah, it just went off.
And that's it.
It was self-defense.
It was...
- It was self-defense.
- Stop!
- Get off me!
- Bobby, get him!
It was self-defense, motherfucker!
Adrien, help me!
Sam, get his legs!
Get his legs!
- Get his legs!
- Get off, motherfucker!
- Eva, get the gun!
- Get off!
- Hold on to him!
- Get off me!
It's a combination lock.
It won't work.
It's a combination lock.
Somebody wake him up.
You know what I think?
I think we should kill the maniac right now.
- Jesus, Bobby.
- Hey, Mickey.
- All right, let's fucking do it.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby.
Let's get civilized about this, please.
- Come on. Josh?
You saw what he did to Delvin.
Huh? The guy's a whack-job.
He has been fucking with us since the first...
You know what?
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Eva.
You don't even know what happened.
- Give me the gun.
- Let's get to the bottom of this first.
- What are you doing? You bitch!
- Josh.
- What if those guys come back, huh?
- Josh, come on.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Fuck.
We need the fucking combination, Mickey.
The combination.
- Aah!
- What is the combination?
Sam.
What's behind that door?
Put his head forward.
- Aah!
- What's behind that door?
- What's behind that door?
- You're gonna die.
- You're all gonna die.
- Huh?
I'll never give you the combination.
Go get the knife.
- No?
- I don't care what you do to me!
You can kill me!
I don't care if I die!
- You don't care if you die?
- No! I kind of want it.
- Aah!
- Huh? You want to die?
As long as I'm strapped in this chair, I'm stronger than you.
You're never gonna get that combination from me.
- Never!
- No?
And I will starve to death.
Will you?
- Bobby!
- Give me the fucking combination,
Mickey, or I'll slice you from ear to ear.
- You hear me?
- Stop!
- You're so fucking dead.
- No! Get off of me, you faggot!
Get off of me, you faggot!
I'll starve to death.
Put the knife down, you guys, please.
You shouldn't have thrown the gun down the toilet, Eva.
- Fuckers! Fuckers!
- Come on, Josh, think about it.
- What's the combination?
- Fuck you!
- Put down the knife.
- Yeah, do it.
- Josh, no!
- What's the combination?
- Put down the knife.
- Do it! Do it!
Josh, no!
- Stop!
- What's the...
Let her go, Josh.
Let her go. Let her go.
I don't know why you wanna fight, boy.
Okay, okay, Josh.
Josh, look at me.
- Look at me.
- Stop it, Josh!
- I'll cut that pretty neck of yours.
- Fuck you!
- Keep the fuck back!
- Look at me, Josh. Look at me.
I think it would be a better idea before we torture someone, you let your anger pass.
If I have to calm down and rationalize this,
I don't know if I'll be able to take a knife and cut his fucking fingers off.
- Do it!
- No.
Last chance, Mickey.
How about that?
How about that's your last chance, you fuckin'...
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Fucking yuppie.
- Do it. Do it.
- Do it. Do it.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Do it. Go ahead.
Go ahead and do it!
Do it, faggot, do it!
How's that feel, huh?
How's that feel?
- How does that fucking feel?
Oh, God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Look at that. Look at that.
There it is, huh?
- See how easy that thing came off?
- Hey, Josh, let's do another one.
- Another one?
- Yeah. Let's do a thumb.
- You want a thumb?
- Nine!
- Nine, motherfucker?
- No!
- What's the combination?
Mickey, give him the combination, please!
Okay. Okay.
- Nine.
- Nine. Come on.
11, then zero, then one.
Now he's a fucking canary.
That wasn't so hard, was it, Mickey?
Go get the door open.
9-11-0-1 . Go.
Just fucking go!
You faggots!
Faggot, you'll never amount to anything.
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
You're a fucking coward!
- Coward!
- Nice souvenir, huh?
- Yeah.
- You fucking cowards!
Hey, Mickey, I got you in my pocket now.
Oh, that's funny.
You're real funny, you stupid shit.
A fucking brain the size of a fucking pea, you fucking idiot.
You red-headed stepchild.
And you, you fuck!
You're a fucking coward, man.
Fuck you!
Mickey.
Mickey.
Won't you play with me?
Ooh, they got beans.
See, I told you he was holding out on us.
We should still kill him.
Shut up, Bobby.
What did you find?
Nothing.
Hey, Mickey, you want to see a magic trick?
Now you're not alone.
You fucking missed.
You missed.
You want it, Sam?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God damn it.
That's disgusting.
Marilyn.
- Don't waste that, Marilyn.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Clean yourself up.
Let me massage you.
No, it just... it hurts.
- All right? Just...
- I can make you feel better.
No, just... just stay off me, all right?
Marilyn, I don't think he wants to be touched.
You stink, okay?
Just stay off me.
I said get off of me!
Stay.
Marilyn, why don't you put some clothes on?
That filthy nightie is disgusting.
I can't even eat.
Well, thanks, Sam.
Now why don't you go over there and suck on his dick?
You should suck his dick because we all know that he's not getting any at home.
What, Sam, her pussy like the fucking Sahara or something?
All right, Josh, let it go.
Marilyn, let me ask you a question.
Why is it that old women can't age gracefully?
Your tits are at your waist.
Someone pulled the ripcord on your inflatable ass.
And your skin is like fucking sand...
- Josh, leave her alone.
- Stay out of it!
- I'm not a child.
- No, she's not.
But I like that.
Stop it.
Oh, what?
Yeah.
Oh, you, too, Sam?
Yeah, go fetch her, boy.
Eva.
- Eva.
- I can't stand it in here.
- Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Sam.
- Sam.
- Come on, Eva.
- Sam, please stop. Please stop.
- Please, please, please.
- Sam, just go away.
- Please, please.
- Sam, stop it.
- Eva, please.
Sam, get off of me!
Josh, do I look like a space alien? Huh?
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Hey.
Yeah?
How about a drink?
Sure.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Cheers.
Thank you.
I should go.
Yeah.
Liz?
I'm so sorry about everything.
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come and get me!
I got nine more fingers for you!
Hey, Marilyn.
- It's gonna be okay.
- Where are you, baby?
- It's gonna be okay.
- Bring back that sweet ass.
- You stay with us. Don't worry.
- Marilyn.
- You stay with us.
- Oh, there she is.
- She got off the leash again.
- It's okay.
Marilyn. Marilyn.
Come back to bed.
She's gonna stay in here with us, all right?
Josh, let her stay in here.
- Marilyn.
- No!
Come on, let her go.
Let her go.
- Let her go!
- Eva, she's yours.
Marilyn! Marilyn!
- Let her go!
- Eva, wait, wait.
- Let her go!
- Wait, let it go.
Aah! Fuck!
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm fine.
Sorry to interrupt.
You guys have to Mickey-sit.
And Josh would like to see you alone.
This looked like your size.
What do you want, Josh?
Decided you should ration your own food and water.
Is this for the three of us?
No, two.
Mickey's fasting.
Okay.
Of course, Eva, if you want more,
I'm open to barter.
No?
Maybe I'll just take this back.
What's going on?
I'm rationing the supplies.
Yeah, well, Josh, they're the group's supplies.
It's not your call.
Well, groups break down into self-interest during times of scarcity.
And someone needs to make the tough decisions during times of war.
It's in the DVDs.
So what's next, huh?
You cut off Bobby?
Then me?
Bro... there is only us.
Let's do it again.
Oh, God, more. More.
- I have to ration it.
- Ration your end.
This is our end.
This is what Josh gave us.
Get me out of this chair.
You held out on us, Mickey.
I was gonna tell you about the food.
But first I had to make sure that when this supply ran low, who I could trust and who would go bad.
Eva, come here.
- Come here. Eva.
- What?
Come here.
There's something in the storage room they don't know about.
- What?
- It's a gun.
Sam.
You have to do something.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He told me there's another gun.
He's a compulsive liar and a fucking murderer.
If you won't help me,
I'll do it alone, Sam.
What are you gonna do when you find that fictional gun?
Are you gonna kill them?
We can't provoke them.
I can talk some sense into them. Yeah.
I was a fucking lawyer, remember?
I was a fucking...
Sam, wake up.
You were nothing, just a fucking drug addict living on the streets.
So don't you dare to tell me to wake up.
You got to be a cowboy.
Cowboys touch penises.
- Do it. Do it.
- No, no.
- I'm not gonna touch it.
- Touch it.
- No way.
- He doesn't want to touch it.
- He doesn't want to do it.
- Do that other thing.
- The big one?
- The big one.
- What did I just say?
- The little one.
- But you said...
Little dog.
The little one.
The little one is a...
The little one choking.
The little one choking.
- Give him a treat.
All right, here we go.
- Eva beaver.
- Wow.
- Come on in.
- No, I just need to talk to Sam.
Well, we're in the middle of a game here.
Sam, I need to talk to you.
- I haven't finished yet.
- He hasn't finished.
Oh, don't worry about Marilyn.
She's zoned out.
You know what?
You should play.
Yeah, come on.
Come on in.
I insist.
There we go.
There we go.
Get her a drink, Sancho.
Thank you, maître d'.
So, Eva... truth or dare?
I'm not gonna play.
You're gonna play 'cause you're sitting at my fucking table.
How about we play for food and water?
So come on.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
- Do you love Sam?
- Good question.
- Come on.
There's no getting out of this one, Eva.
Do you love Sammy?
Yes.
Ooh, congratulations, Sam.
And my brother?
You already asked your question.
That is true, Josh.
Those are the rules.
- That's true.
- Fuck, she got me, man.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, um...
It's your turn to ask.
So come on.
Ask a question.
It's your turn.
Come on, just say,
"Josh, truth or dare?"
Ask a question.
Okay, dare.
No, truth.
Last time I said dare,
Bobby wanted me to eat Mickey's finger.
- You're a sick fuck.
Fucking disgusting.
So come on, ask a question.
Ask a fucking question.
- Ask a fucking question!
- Did you enjoy torturing Mickey?
No.
I did what had to be done.
But what have you done for us?
Huh?
- Come on, Josh.
- Okay, fuck it, Sam.
What's up? You want a turn?
Truth or dare?
Dare.
Go cut up Delvin's body.
Come on, Sammy.
Circle of truth.
You accepted the dare, Sammy.
Time to follow through.
- I'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Huh?
Do it.
- Stop.
- Do it.
- You got a penis, Sam?
- I'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.
- Bobby, stop it.
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it.
Eva, how can you be engaged to such a pussy?
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
- Stop it!
Atta boy.
Sam, sit down.
Sam, sit down.
Sam, don't!
Sam, don't.
Help me.
Sam, don't.
You don't have to prove yourself.
- You don't have to do this.
- All right, Sam, now remember, it's just like chopping lumber, but not.
All right, knock yourself out.
Go for it.
- Hold it high.
- No.
- Don't.
Come on.
- You fucking pussy.
- Why don't you do it, Bobby?
You love chopping up people.
Why don't you do it?
Well, you see,
I've already cut up a body.
- Give me a kiss. Right here.
- Whoo!
I think we know who the man of the house is.
- Get the fuck... get off me.
- Robert.
- Get off me.
- Get the ax.
- No, no, no, no, I can do it!
- You're gonna cut him up.
- Josh, don't!
What are you doing?
Do it or I break his arms.
Come on.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Who's next?
Bobby.
So how's a little bit off the top?
You ready?
Okay.
Look at us, huh?
Look at us.
- Yeah.
- We're the same.
The same.
You're my brother now.
Where's the gun?
Get me out of this chair.
It's in a red coffee can in the panic room.
I never said I'd untie you.
You'll do the right thing.
Eva, there's another way out.
- What?
- Through the septics.
But you're gonna be swimming through a whole lot of god-awful shit.
You know it's in the hair?
It's in the hair.
What's the going rate on a bottle of water, Sancho?
Got to be some infidelity for sure.
- Yeah.
- No.
Stop. Stop.
She sounds like a racehorse, Robert.
I'll bet she goes off like one, too.
- Please.
- Don't spoil it.
- Please, not like this.
- Not like what?
- Robert.
- What?
- Get lost.
- I thought we could share this one.
Oh, God.
It's in the hair.
She just broke.
Hey.
- What happened?
- Marilyn's dead.
They killed her.
You okay?
What are you doing?
You have to get the gun.
In the panic room.
- Where?
- In the red coffee can.
- Hey, assholes.
- Oh, God.
You're supposed to keep the batteries charged.
We're trying to watch a movie.
Yes, Bobby, but it just died.
- All of a sudden.
- What the fuck, Sam?
It just died?
What the fuck?
Store's closed.
Not here. Not here.
Not here, please.
Please.
Come with me.
This is your fault.
You didn't fucking charge the battery.
- Sorry. Yeah, yeah, well...
- Oh, shit.
Why do you look so nervous, Sam?
Huh? Go do something.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?
- I need to go to the toilet.
I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.
Wait. Wait.
Why don't you just slow down?
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
- What are you doing, Sam?
Well, you said you were going to the bathroom.
The bathroom's down the hall and to the left.
I'm just starving, Bobby.
I need something to eat.
Okay.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
You know, I'm standing here and you're standing there, and we're both thinking the same thing, aren't we?
What?
Please, get me out of this chair.
Get me out of this chair.
Get me out of this chair.
Please, get me out of this chair.
Are you my friend, Sam?
Yes, I'm your friend.
What... what are you doing, Bobby?
Will you be my Sancho, Sam?
- Your what?
- My Sancho.
- Sancho Panza?
- Sure.
What? Sure.
Yes, I'll be your Sancho...
Say please, pussy.
Pussy?
- Please.
- Please.
- Pussy.
- Pussy.
- Please, pussy.
- Please.
- Pretty please, pussy.
- Pretty please.
- Pussy. Not just pussy.
- Pussy.
- Pussy. Pussy.
- Pussy. Pussy.
Now say it in French.
I don't know what you just said, but that sounded sexy as fuck.
- Now suck my dick.
- What?
- Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
- What? No.
- Suck my dick!
- No, no, no!
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, Bobby.
- Bobby, come on.
- Suck it.
- Bobby. Bobby, come on.
- Suck my dick.
- Suck my dick.
- Bobby!
- Bobby, stop! Ah!
Stop it!
Stop!
I'm just fucking with you, Sam.
Yeah, we changed the combination two weeks ago.
Open sesame.
I don't think we have croissants.
I know how you Frenchies love that shit.
But I'll find you something.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't want to just fuck you.
Wait, wait, please.
You were right about Sam.
Sam's not a real man like you.
You're right.
I need a real man.
What are you doing?
I want to touch you.
I just want to touch you.
What, I said, are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I just wanted to touch your skin.
- You want some apricots?
- Apricots are for faggots.
I like apricots.
You know, Sam, you really blew it big time.
You know, I knew
Josh would tap that ass.
You really blew it.
What the fuck are you doing, Sam?
Shh.
Shut up.
Shh.
- Josh!
- Shut up!
- All right.
- Stand up.
Stand up.
Now march.
Come on, Sam.
No!
I'll fucking kill you!
Get off!
Get off her!
Get off of her!
Run, run!
I've got the gun.
- I've got the gun.
- Sam.
I've got a gun!
I've got a gun.
Come on, Sam. If you shoot me, you're gonna have to cut me up.
Sam, keep the gun on Bobby.
You'll never do it, pussy.
- Come on, shoot me.
- Sam!
Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.
- Shoot me!
- Keep the gun on Bobby.
- Sam, I'm on your side.
- You'll never do it, pussy.
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.
- I'm on your side.
- Shoot me!
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- Sam, give me the gun.
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.
- Shoot me.
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- What?
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- Okay, I'm on your side.
- Fucking shoot me.
Damn it, I'm on your side.
Give me the gun.
- Shoot me!
- Give me the gun, Sam.
- Shoot me!
- Give it to Adrien!
- Sam!
No! No!
Fucking do him.
Fucking do him.
Fucking do him. Huh?
Fucking do him.
Come on, you fucking pussy.
Fucking do him.
You gonna puss out on me now? Do it!
Come on, cunt.
Fucking do it.
- Fucking do it.
Do him.
Come on.
Come on, buddy boy.
Hey. Hey.
Eva! Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
Are you proud of yourself?
Sam, come on.
That's gasoline.
Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Open the fucking door!
Eva, come on.
Open the fucking door!
Eva! Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- They changed the numbers.
- What?
They changed the fucking combination.
What's the new combination?
- What's the new combination?
- They didn't tell me.
Eva!
Eva.
Don't let us die.
I'm sorry, Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Eva...
Eva!
(Whimsical score playing)
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Here's a menu.
- Thank you.
I'll be right back with you.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
I don't mean to bother you.
What?
I feel I know you from somewhere.
Really?
Yeah, did you go to
San mateo high school?
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
- I went there too.
- So are you from here?
- Not really.
My mother lives up here but I'm from San Francisco.
What about you?
San Jose.
I remember you now.
You were in my English class.
- I was?
- Yeah, I sat two seats behind you.
- You remember that far?
- Yeah.
So what do you do?
I'm a fashion model.
And a beautiful one too.
Thanks.
Well, it was nice talking to you,
But I should really get going.
I've got an audition for a modeling job.
So it was good talking to you.
Same here.
Nathalie.
Oh, hi again.
I was wondering if we can keep in contact.
Sure.
Here's my card.
- Here's mine.
- Again.
Again, it was nice talking to you.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
This morning flocks of seagulls and crows
Were found dead in downtown San Jose
And along highway 101.
The crows and seagulls also caused an accident
On highway 101 near the 1st street exit.
Authorities are investigating the cause of their death.
In other news today, the population
Of polar bears is declining rapidly
Due to the melting of sea ice in the arctic.
As the sea ice melts, the polar bears
Are forced to move farther north.
Although some have survived, many have died from starvation
Due to the difficulty of finding enough food such as seals.
What does it take to win your business today?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I'll give you that and a 50% discount.
Can we close the deal today?
Can I place your order today?
Great, thanks.
We appreciate your business.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, what's with all the noise?
Caught the big fish.
Yeah?
How big was the sale?
$1 million.
- Awesome, man.
- Biggest sale of my career.
I'm proud of you.
Nathalie?
Hey, Christine.
What's up?
I have great news for you.
Victoria's secret wants you
To become their cover girl model.
You're kidding.
No no, it's the real deal.
That's great.
Yeah, of course I'll do it.
Thanks for getting me the gig.
You are welcome.
You worked very hard.
So here's your chance to impress them.
Congratulations again.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Okay. All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Thank you again.
All right.
Okay, bye, Christine.
Thanks.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Nathalie?
Who is this?
It's rod.
Oh, the guy from the restaurant.
What's up?
Hey, it was nice running into you at half moon bay.
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.
So how's your day?
It's going well.
How's yours?
Great.
I made a big sale today.
Good.
Fantastic.
Thanks.
I closed a big job offer today
With Victoria's secret,
Wow, congratulations.
I think you'll look great in those lingerie.
Thanks.
So how about dinner to celebrate your success?
- That was fast.
- I know a good vietnamese restaurant.
Sounds delicious.
I'll see you then.
Yes.
Yes.
Man, all air.
Whoo.
This heat's killing me.
I know, man.
What's with this weather?
A heat wave in winter?
I don't know.
Let's call it a day.
I met this girl nathalie over the weekend.
Good for you.
Is she hot?
- Yeah. Fashion model.
- Lucky you, man.
Yeah, we're going out this weekend.
Hope you score with her, man.
Is that all you ever think about... is sex?
Anyways, we're just gonna go to lunch.
Just talk.
Get to know each other.
A day without sex
Is a day wasted, man.
I'll let you know how it goes.
Anyways, I heard n.C.T.
Is going to be acquired by oracle.
- Really?
I hope that's true, man.
- I know it's true.
You know, if that happens, we'll all be millionaires.
Yeah.
There was a wildfire today in the Santa Cruz mountains.
Dubbed the St. Martin wildfire,
It has already burned through
30,000 acres of trees
And has destroyed over 100 homes.
Currently there is 0% containment of this fire.
However, firefighters are hopeful
That within the coming days the weather will become more favorable
And help to extinguish the St. Martin wildfire.
In other news, the first green grand prix event
Was announced today in San Francisco.
All cars for this racing event will be powered
With hybrid or electric technologies.
Parts of the streets of San Francisco
Will be used as the racing course
And the drivers will be
Hollywood celebrities.
Hi, my name is Jerry Owens.
I'm from solar power accessories.
We have an appointment today.
Oh, yeah yeah.
Come on in.
Here's that estimate
I was telling you about.
Wow, $20,000 for a 3 kilowatt solar panel?
Yes.
Where are you gonna put it?
Come and I'll show you.
And that, sir, is where we're going to install your solar panel.
Okay.
Huh.
$20,000, huh?
Is there any way we can lower the price?
For you, sir,
I'll knock off $1,000.
- $1,000, huh?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.
Hi, nathalie.
Hi.
Hi.
This is for you.
Thanks.
That's sweet.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
So why did you decide to go into sales?
I like sales.
It fits my personality.
I started out as a software engineer,
A b.S. In computer science.
Software development was boring for me.
And I felt I was more of a sales and marketing type.
So I switched to a high-tech sales career.
That's interesting.
Some of my friends say that my b.S. Degree
Stands for bullshit because
I was too much of a salesman
And not enough engineer.
Very funny.
I work at a start-up company called n.C.T. Software.
Got the stock option.
Hopefully if the company makes it big
By being bought out or goes public,
I'll exercise that stock option,
Cash out and walk away with tons of cash.
My silicon valley dream.
I hope that happens for you.
Thanks.
Tell me about modeling.
What do you like about it?
I love it.
It's fun and glamorous,
But hard work.
My mother doesn't see that though.
She wants me to be a real estate agent.
It's not for me though.
Do what you like, nathalie.
Follow your dream.
I have every intention.
So how come you never made a pass at me in school?
I should have.
I was too shy.
Why don't you make a pass at me now?
I thought I already had.
So what's your plan?
Family? Kids?
Whoa, now this is getting serious.
I'm just curious.
I'd probably settle down if I met the right lady.
- Hope you do.
- So do i.
So who's the right lady?
She's beautiful,
Kind, compassionate,
Honest and loyal.
- Is that all?
- Yup.
How about a nice figure?
Sexy?
That would certainly help.
What do you like to do for fun?
Watch football, especially the 49ers.
Also a part-time eagles fan.
And a little exercise...
Tennis.
How about you?
I like to go to the movies.
And I like to hang around with my best friends
And go dancing at the clubs...
Clubbing.
And I like to spend time with Alex.
Alex?
He's really cute.
Who is Alex?
And I love him to death.
Come on, let me see the picture.
Is he your boyfriend?
I can't wait for you to meet him.
Come on, let me see it.
Come on, let me see it.
All right.
Meet Alex.
You're right.
He is cute.
- So you're a cats lover.
- Yes.
If I could afford it,
I'd have at least 10 of them.
- Wow, a cat zoo?
- Yup.
You've got to be kidding.
Nope.
Beautiful, kind,
Compassionate and intelligent...
- I hope you find her.
- I will.
- That was fun.
- We should do it again.
I'd like to.
Good night.
See you next week.
Can't I come in?
Not on the first date.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Okay.
Good night.
- Hi, mom.
- Oh hi, honey.
- How are you?
- Oh, good.
I'm just fixing some lunch.
You want to stay?
I've actually got to run soon.
But I needed to pop in and see you.
I'm glad you did.
What's that smile all about?
I don't know what you're talking about, mom.
Oh, come on.
I see it all over your face.
Well, I did meet a guy.
You're kidding.
He is great, mom.
You know we went to the same high school?
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
We had lunch over the weekend and it was terrific, mom.
I mean, we hit it off right away.
He's smart and he's ambitious.
And he's interested in what I have to say
Instead of trying to get something from me.
So he's great.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Now what does he do for a living?
He's a software salesman.
Oh listen, invite him over for dinner.
I'd love to meet him.
Maybe in time, mom, when we get better acquainted.
Well, I can understand that.
You know, look, keep me...
You know, keep me informed along the way.
- All right.
- How's modeling going?
It's great, mom.
I got a job with
Victoria's secret.
- (Gasps) No way!
- Yeah.
Are you serious?
Oh my gosh.
Oh, honey, you know
I've always been supportive of your modeling career.
It's just such a tough business to be in.
It is.
Thank you, mom.
I'm well on my way.
Well, listen.
If things don't work out,
It doesn't hurt to have a secure financial husband
To support you.
Or, you know, a real estate career to fall back on.
Okay, mom.
Thanks.
You told me about a dozen times already.
You know I always love your advice.
Actually, I've got to get going.
I just wanted to drop by and say hi to you
And to tell you all about my new gig.
Well, does the gig pay well?
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh, that's my girl.
I need to get the phone.
Hello?
Hey, mai.
Yeah?
It's nathalie.
Oh, hi.
What are you doing?
What does it sound like I'm doing?
Rick is here in bed with me.
Sorry to interrupt.
Listen, do you want to go on a double date with me?
I don't know.
Why?
I just met this guy rod
And he's terrific.
Sounds fun.
I'll let Rick know.
Great.
I'll set it up.
Want to go on a double date with me?
Why not?
My friend nathalie just met someone named rod.
You remember, the fashion model?
Oh yeah.
With rod?
My buddy rod.
He was telling me last week
He met a fashion model named nathalie.
- Oh really?
- Yeah.
Man, this is gonna be fun.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please help me give a warm welcome
For our c.E.O.
Bill star.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some great news.
Our board of directors has agreed to the acquisition
Of n.C.T. Software by oracle corporation
For $1 billion.
A billion.
A billion.
You guys...
You guys have worked hard
And you've all earned your stock option.
Congratulations.
You you you you and you.
So I guess the meeting's adjourned.
Congratulations.
Good work.
You bet.
You bet.
- Congratulations.
- Way to go, bill.
The negotiating man.
Oh yeah!
- Thank you so much.
- What are you getting with your money?
So now you've got a big payday with your big stock option, huh?
Yeah, I earned it.
All those big deals
I did with n.C.T.
And millions of dollars in revenue and sales.
Well, you've done a great job, rod.
And we appreciate your contribution.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You like it?
I'm gonna get the real
Ferrari spider f430 soon.
So what are you gonna do with your newfound wealth?
I think I'm going on break.
Early retirement.
No car?
Well, with that new fashion model chick
You might want to impress her with a Ferrari.
I don't think she's materialistic.
When are you gonna grow up, man?
Chicks love cars.
If you want to get into their pants,
You'd better have a nice hot Ferrari.
She's my hot Ferrari.
Besides, I love my mustang, which is a plug-in hybrid.
It gets 100mpg.
Anyways,
I'm thinking about
Opening up a green tech company.
Really?
Oh, by the way,
I know your girlfriend nathalie.
She's my girlfriend's best friend.
- Huh, small world.
- Yeah.
And they're planning on setting us up for a double date.
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah.
Man, that was a good movie...
"an inconvenient truth."
That is it.
I'm getting myself a car that's environmentally friendly.
- Yeah.
- Good, you're finally listening to me.
That's right.
Hey, mai and I got to get back to work.
So, uh...
Just trot off.
Work?
Yeah, you know, sensual work.
Oh, I see.
Understood.
Well, you guys have a good time.
Yeah, all right.
With mass solar's nano-based solar panels,
They cost the manufacturer for one watt of electricity 10¢.
That's a fraction of the cost
Of a recurring silicon-based solar panel
Which is $4 per watt.
So a 3-kilowatt mass solar nano-based
Solar-powered system would probably cost around
At this price everyone can afford solar power
For their home or businesses.
With these panels,
Solar power will be available and affordable for everyone.
No need for leasing or financing
An expensive $20,000 silicon-based solar panel.
Is there a patent?
Yes, mass solar owns the patent to this technology.
Good.
Who are your competitors?
Companies like sun power, silicon valley solar.
But these companies' solar panels
Are based on silicon technology,
Which is very expensive to manufacture.
That's why it's for $4 per watt.
On the other hand, mass solar's manufacturing process
Is simple, it's low cost
And it uses nanotechnology.
That's why we're able to deliver 10¢ per watt.
So how much funding are you requesting?
$10 million.
Guys, this is revolutionary green tech.
Contingent upon agreement on our terms sheets,
- we're going to fund you.
- Awesome.
- Oh, lovers on the moon.
- Yeah.
Oh, look how cute.
The sea is so beautiful.
Yes, it is.
You know, all life came from the sea.
I mean, look at us.
We're made of water.
So...
So what is your ideal man?
Well, for one thing,
He has to have a lot of stock options invested.
At least you're honest.
He has to be kind, honest,
Successful, ambitious,
And opportunistic.
- Is that all?
- Yup.
So do you have, like, a backup plan,
You know, if your modeling career doesn't work out?
Not really.
I figure if I don't make it big by the time I'm 30,
I figure I'll just take it from there.
You should have a plan b now.
I always do.
I mean, look at me.
I started out as a software engineer
And ended up a salesman.
You sound like my mother.
Good advice though.
Who knows? Maybe I will consider a career in real estate,
Or even becoming a wife
Of a successful entrepreneur.
Look at these birds.
Stop, don't touch it.
It may be infectious.
- Oh hi.
- Hi, mom.
- How are you?
- Good good.
- This is rod.
- Hi, rod.
- So nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
Come on in, you guys.
Good to see you, honey.
Come on in.
Rod, nat tells me
That you are a very successful salesman.
She did, huh?
I am very passionate about my career.
So nathalie tells me you recently retired.
Yes, I did.
And she mentioned that you were gonna take an early retirement.
Yeah, a few months.
Just taking a little break.
So are you enjoying your retirement?
I love the retirement.
I was a jeweler for 30 years.
And sometimes I miss not going into the jewelry store,
But, you know,
I really like retirement.
I like to travel.
I like to cruise.
And I enjoy watching television.
And my biggest thing
Is I love to watch nat
And work with her in her modeling career.
Wow, nathalie's a lucky person to have such a loving mother.
Oh, thanks, rod.
I appreciate that.
My big thing is to make sure that she's happy
And successful in whatever she chooses to do.
Thanks, mom.
Hello.
Here's your drinks.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Can I get you anything else?
We're still looking at the menu.
Thank you.
- Hope you enjoy.
- Thanks.
I really enjoyed meeting your mother.
She seemed to really like you.
I was so lonely until now.
So do you think
I'm that right lady?
Maybe.
Do you think
I'm the ideal man?
Perhaps.
You know, rod,
I was just kidding
About the stock options,
Shopping and money and all that.
All I want is you.
Are you sure?
Definitely.
Guys are usually just into me for my looks and sex.
But you're not like that.
You're a real gentleman.
I feel like you really respect me.
That means a lot to me.
I feel like I could be with you for a long time.
Then I'm one lucky man.
I think my luck has changed since I met you.
Really?
Why's that?
Last week the company n.C.T.
Software that I work for
Was bought for $1 billion by oracle corporation.
And this week my start-up company that I founded,
Mass solar, got funded $10 million
By evergreen capital.
Wow.
You said that might happen.
Congratulations.
Thanks.

So?
What do you think?
You look divine.
Rod.
What is it?
I think they're eagles.
What in the world?
Battery is dead.
What's going on?
Can they get in?
Not for the moment.
Rod, they're breaking in through the window.
Hurry, let's barricade it with the bed.
Hurry!
That should hold 'em.
I think they're gone.
Well, do you know why they stopped?
I don't know.
Maybe they got tired.
Why would birds do something like that?
I mean, why would they just attack?
I don't know.
Anybody in here?
Come on.
- Name's rod.
- Ramsey.
- This is nathalie.
- Nice to meet you.
- My girlfriend Becky.
- Hi.
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I guess.
- Man, those birds were attacking all night
Then they just suddenly stopped.
We'd try to drive away but
I can't find my car keys.
- I lost them somewhere.
- They were attacking us too.
We have a van outside.
- You guys are more than welcome to come.
- Yeah, come with us.
Thank you.
We need something to protect ourselves.
Use these.
Here you go.
All right.
Let's all get our backs to each other.
That we can see the birds coming from every direction.
- Okay.
- Just like this.
- (Exhales)
- All right, ready?
- Rod: Let's go.
- Let's go.
Here they come!
Open the door.
Becky:
The door's stuck.
The door's stuck.
Hurry up.
I can't hurry up.
Damn birds scratched me.
Becky, hand me a gun.
Rod, drive.
Here, rod.
Take a pistol.
Let's go.
Hey, there's dead people on the side of the road.
Let's go see if there's any survivors.
Okay.
Becky, cover us.
I'll check out this car, you check out the other.
Okay.
They're dead.
Come on, honey.
Come over here.
Come out from under the car.
Come on.
No, I don't want to come out.
The birds will bite me.
No they won't.
Come on.
I'll protect you,
I promise.
I'm scared.
They killed my mommy.
They killed my mommy.
- It's the birds!
- (Gunfire)
Boy:
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
- Help!
- Run for it.
Let's go.
Help!
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
- (Gunfire)
- Come on!
- Let's go.
- Come on.
What's your name, sweetie?
Susan.
We're gonna make this feel all better.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- Oh, you want to play?
- Okay.
I'm hungry.
I've been under the car for a long time.
Yeah, me too.
I'm starving.
Hey, the kids are getting hungry.
We should stop and get some food for them.
And some for us too.
There's a convenience store close by.
We'll stop there.
Becky, watch Tony while he sleeps, okay?
I'll stand guard.
You go get food and water.
Okay.
You want to get some candy?
Okay.
- Get some for Tony too.
- Okay.
Let's go, guys.
The eagles are coming.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
The eagles are attacking.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, look.
There's an old guy on the bridge.
Hey, mister.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Hey hey!
Stand back!
These birds are contagious.
Now go away.
Hey, I thought I told you to stand back.
These birds are contaminated.
They have bird flu virus.
Now go away.
Could we just talk about it at the picnic area?
You want to talk?
Okay.
All right.
We'll talk.
Guys, this is
Dr. Jones.
How do you do?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sir, don't you know that these birds are attacking people?
- These birds?
- Yes.
No way.
They're dead from the bird flu virus.
- Bird flu virus?
- How do you know this?
I just tested their blood.
Then why are they attacking us?
I don't know.
But what I do know is global warming is causing viral diseases
Such as bird flu, west nile virus and SARS.
So what are you saying?
That global warming is causing these birds to attack?
No.
I'm a scientist...
An ornithologist.
I can't state any scientific fact without evidence.
But there is scientific evidence to show
That because of our burning of fossil fuels
And creating greenhouse gasses
Which is causing global warming,
It's raising the temperature of the seas
And species like the krill are dying.
So many bird species can't find food
Like the neritic krill.
They eventually starve and die,
Wash up on the shore.
There's also evidence that global warming
Is interrupting the birth, mating and migration cycles
Of many species.
In fact, in the last few years
40 species have become extinct because of global warming.
However, there is interesting research
That in prehistoric times
Birds did attack cavemen.
They used to claw at their eyes and skull.
They'd either leave them for dead or then come back
Because their injuries were so bad
And finally finish off the kill.
If they attack me,
I've got a little present for them.
Well, you certainly know a lot about birds.
Well, I should.
I'm an ornithologist.
I study and work with birds for a living.
You should come with us.
It's safer.
I don't need protection.
I can take care of myself.
I've got my truck and my trailer.
Besides, I'm not worried about the blackbirds.
They're not the dangerous animal.
It's the human species that's the dangerous
And menacing and terrifying animal.
Because of his fossil fuel related activities,
He's causing global warming.
It's killing life and earth itself.
It's the human species
That needs to quit playing cowboy with nature.
We must act more like astronauts,
Spacemen taking care of our spaceship earth.
Well, nice meeting you.
Good luck.
Where's Becky?
She's taking a shit.
Nathalie's watching her back.
You're pretty good at shooting.
How come you're still not in the marines?
I just got tired of all the fucking killing in Iraq.
Why can't we just give peace a chance?
Right there.
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.
- (Screeches)
- (Screams)
Oh my God, she's dead.
Rod!
Rod!
Ramsey!
She's dead.
I couldn't do anything.
She's dead.
What do you mean she's dead?
- (Birds screeching)
- Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
The eagles killed Becky.
Fucking killed Becky.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ramsey.
They got to her before
I got a chance.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, those people on that bus are being attacked by those birds.
- (Screeching)
- (People screaming)
- Let's go save them.
- We can't. We have no room.
- It's full in here.
- They killed Becky.
What if it was nathalie?
- (Birds screeching)
- (Gunfire)
Please help me!
Help!
Come on.
I've got to get out of here.
Ramsey:
Come on, guys, let's go.
The birds are gone.
No they're not.
They're not gone.
They're gonna kill us if we go out there.
Come on, let's go.
I don't want to.
They'll kill us.
Rod, I'm gonna go get those people.
- Cover me, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
- No.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
Let's go.
Help me! No!
I don't want to go!
- Come on.
- No no!
- I don't want to go!
- Let's go.
- No!
- Don't make me go out there!
- Follow me.
- (Gunshots)
- (Gasps)
- (Screaming)
I'm going out there to save them.
Don't go.
If you go out there you'll die.
They're dead already.
Yeah, you're right.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hi.
The eagles killed our friends.
Do you have a phone I can use to call the police?
No, I'm sorry.
All phones from the eagle attack...
All phones are dead up here.
Really?
Damn it.
Well, we need some gas.
Well, you know, from the eagle attack
We are short on gas.
But it's $100 a gallon if you want.
What? $100?
That's outrageous.
Well, either you take it or leave it.
I have only a few gallons left only.
It's a rip-off.
Fine.
Thank you.
Tony, Susan, can you guys go get some water over there?
Then you can go get candy for yourselves.
- Yay.
- Okay.
Hey, look at that man up there.
We should stop and help him.
Okay.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Can you sell me some gas for my truck?
We only have a few gallons and we need them.
We just bought some for $100 a gallon down the street.
$100 a gallon?
I've only got 50 in my wallet.
- We can give you a ride.
- Oh, no thanks.
Sorry, but we need it.
- You're gonna sell me some gas now.
- Whoa, take it easy.
Take it easy.
I've got an extra tank in the back.
Good.
Get it.
Rod, let's get out of here.
There's a creek over there.
We can get some fresh water.
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Come out or I'll shoot.
Don't shoot.
Peace, man.
Come down here.
Why were you hiding in the trees?
This is my home.
I live here.
That's my house.
You live in a tree?
Sure do.
So you're a tree hugger?
You could put it that way.
I love trees.
They're my family.
I look out for them and protect these precious redwoods.
So you can play in your tree house?
Sure.
Yes, that'll be fun!
No way, it's too dangerous.
The eagles might come there.
Oh, they won't.
You're very safe here in the forest.
Haven't you noticed those eagles
Seem to be going after people in their cars and gas stations?
Besides, it's not the eagles
I worry about.
It's the dry drought weather that's killing these trees.
There's not enough rain and water.
Even worse, the spruce bark beetles are eating
These trees to death and turning them from green to red.
I remember when those beetles used to die out during the winter.
But now with the dry climate they've multiplied
And taken over the forest.
Take a look at that dead redwood up there.
That was killed by a bark beetle.
This damn global warming.
It's the cause of dry climate and bark beetles
And death of the trees and forest.
I can protect these trees
Against greedy lumber companies
And bad campers who start forest wildfires.
But it's impossible to protect them against global warming.
- What's your name?
- I'm tom hill.
I'm rod. This is nathalie,
Susan and Tony.
You can come with us.
Oh, I can't.
This is my home.
I have to stay here to protect these trees from further harm.
Enjoy and appreciate these trees while you can.
In a few years they'll be gone.
- (Growling)
- I hear a Mountain lion.
I've got to get back to my house.
You'd better get to your car.
It was very nice meeting you.
You too.
I think it's this way to the van.
- No, it's this way.
- Are you sure?
What's that smell?
Smells like wood burning.
It's a forest fire.
Let's go, come on.
This way.
- You see that lighthouse over there?
- Mm-hmm.
That's where mai lives.
We should stop by and see if she's there.
Okay.
- Oh my God.
- What?
That's mai's car.
- We should pull over.
- Okay.
Oh God, mai.
Mai, are you okay?
Mai.
Nat?
Mai.
Forgive them...
Mai.
Mai?
Mai!
God.
Mai.
Damn it!
We ran out of gas.
What are we gonna do?
If we're lucky someone might drive by.
- I'm hungry.
- Me too, I'm hungry.
We've got to find a way to get them some food.
- What should we do?
- I don't know.
Hey look, a fishing rod.
I can go catch some fish.
Oh look, a stove.
We can cook it.
Hey, good idea.
Hey, nat.
I'll go fishing over there.
How about you and the kids go get some seaweed?
Okay.
You guys eat seaweed?
Seaweed's the best.
It's good for your health.
Nathalie:
Is that right?
Rod:
I caught a fish!
- He caught a fish.
- Yay!
Awesome.
I got a fish.
Looks good.
I got some seaweed.
Good.
I'm gonna go up to the van and get the stove
So we can cook this.
Here you go.
This'll be good for us.
Yuck.
I want a happy meal.
Me too.
I know, you guys.
There's no happy meals around here.
Just try the seaweed.
It'll be really good.
- No.
- No, I want a happy meal.
I don't know.
Guys.
Guys, get up.
The eagles.
The eagles.
Come on, we've got to go.
Damn,
I'm out of bullets.
Nat, you hit them if they get through windshield, okay?
Look!
They're leaving.
I wonder why they stopped the attack.
I saw this image when I was a kid.
The photograph of Jupiter taken by NASA's Voyager.
Beautiful,
but nothing special until shown in rapid succession.
Suddenly Jupiter was alive,
breathing.
I was hypnotized.
I was 17 when I got my acceptance letter to MIT.
- One, two, three, MIT!
- Okay. Wait...
I felt like anything was possible.
I don't want to eat the apple of cynicism.
And it was.
- # Flava #
- # Flava #
Yo, what's up, baby?
It's your boy Flava... F-L-A-V-A.
That's your dude with the big mouth! Yo!
I don't know if you heard the news, but the scientists say...
they just discovered another planet super close to us...
with the conditions that could support life?
Really? Well, now it's visible up in the night sky.
They say if you look just east of the North Star, you'll see it.
It's a little blue spot.
I want all you lovers out there to make a wish...
on a tiny blue star...
as I play this hot joint for you right now.
It's your boy Flava!
That's easy.
What rhymes with... "honey"?
"Bunny. "
He's like,
"All right, enough with it!"
What rhymes...
Let's do some animals.
- You wanna give him some animals?
- Yeah.
- What rhymes with...
- "Lion"?
Oh, my gosh.
- "Pion. "
- A pion.
A small puma of the high Himalayas.
Did we figure out what this guy's name is?
- Bob.
- Bob the robot.
He looks to me like a Bob.
Go ahead.
Feel her.
She's in there, all right.
I hope so.
What rhymes with...
"light"?
- "Light"?
- Oh, that's a good one.
And by all appearances, the, uh, planet...
seems to be a mirror to our own,
from the continental structures to the oceans.
Even their cities are our cities.
And where are we in terms of communication?
That's exactly my point.
If this planet is sustaining intelligent life...
of comparable levels to our own...
That's a very significant point.
So far we have nothing.
We have a jumble of radio signals,
the strongest of which are military radars.
But even those radio signals are not something we can parse out and understand.
We don't even know it really exists.
It could be some cosmic mirror of sorts.
You've written extensively about that...
as the most likely explanation for why it's identical to our own planet.
This planet exists.
It has mass and it has a clearly detectable orbit.
It's even having radio signals.
So did you have a crew on the inside?
Do you have any tattoos?
- Jeffrey!
- I'm just taking.
You hear about that guy who's having the contest to go to the other Earth?
I mean, it's so stupid.
They're gonna get sucked into a black star and die.
Hmm.
Is it good to be home?
Yeah.
You know, if you need anything...
Oh. Towels.
Night.
Good night, Mom.
Three, two, one.
Booster ignition, and liftoff.
This will be a trip like no other.
We will give those that travel with us a unique and life-changing experience.
Travel to Earth Two.
Now booking.
I was thinking I would like to do something with my hands.
You know, maybe... maybe outdoors, maybe not.
Come on. I mean, you could do something with your hands, but you have such a great mind.
I don't wanna really be around too many people or do too much talking.
All right.
Well, there's a maintenance position open at West Haven High School.
Just imagine that you're asleep and then you wake.
You're not sure where you are.
You're not sure if anyone else is around.
What would you probably do first?
You likely would look around and say, "Hello?
Hello?"
You're attempting to find,
"Am I alone?"
We here on Earth would like to know.
Me and Rob got into this huge, stupid fight last night.
Really? About what?
I don't know. We were hanging out, and he just started fighting...
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
- What are you guys doing?
- Um, skipping Chemistry.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Guess who just texted me.
- Who?
- Kyle.
Is he gonna pick us up?
Yo! It's the winter solstice.
That's right.
The shortest day of the year,
which means it will also be the longest night of the year.
So take advantage.
You know what I'm talking about.
Also, today marks the anniversary of the discovery of Earth Two a few years back.
Can you remember what you were doing that night?
I know I remember.
I met this girl from Bridgeport...
that had a thing for the Flava!
That's right, baby.
You know how we do.
Baby, if you're still out there, boo, holler at your boy.
Flava, F-L-A-V-A. Yeah.
Not only do I got a big mouth,
I got a... Uh.
You know my number.
Call me. Mmm.
...company that's underwriting civilian travel to Earth Two.
Keith, with all the risks...
and all the unknowns, why are you doing this?
I don't think governments should dictate exploration.
And I don't think we should automatically ban average citizens...
from being the first to see this new world.
When early explorers first set out west across the Atlantic,
most people thought the world was flat.
Most people thought if you sailed far enough west,
you would drop off a plane into nothing.
These vessels sailing out into the unknown...
they weren't carrying noblemen or aristocrats, artists, merchants.
They were crewed by people living on the edge of life...
the madmen, orphans, ex-convicts, outcasts...
like myself.
As a felon, I'm an unlikely candidate for most things.
But perhaps not for this.
Perhaps I am the most likely.
Rhoda?
Hi. Alex.
I know who you are.
How are you?
How... How is everything?
It's great.
You celebrating?
Yeah. I just got into business school.
Boston.
Hey, I couldn't get arugula, but I found this spring mix.
That's good. Uh, this is Rhoda, an old friend of mine from high school.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Claire.
- Hi.
So, are you working?
West Haven High.
Yeah? What do you teach?
- I clean.
- What?
I clean the school.
Oh, that's cool. That's probably very therapeutic.
All right. Well, it was good to see you, Rhoda.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
How do you know her?
High school.
Yeah?
- Mr. Burroughs?
- Mm-hmm.
I, uh...
- What?
- ... came to...
I came to tell you about...
What?
Tell you about a tri... a free trial of our cleaning service.
What?
I'm from Maid In Haven.
We're a cleaning service.
- We're looking to expand our territory and our... - No, thank you.
Wait.
Did you say
"trial cleaning"?
- Did you say "trial cleaning"?
- Yeah...
- God.
- Sorry, it's a t...
- Is it definitely free?
- Yeah.
Fine. Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
You can start in here.
Did you say "Maid In Haven"?
- Yes.
- Like New Haven?
Yes.
You're pretty far from New Haven.
There's a lot of competition in town, so we're offering the free trial as a...
Where are your supplies?
Uh, normally, the first time is a consultation.
Okay.
Well, you're already here, so why don't you just... clean this for a start?
Okay? There's mops and things in there.
Okay.
I'm gonna be in that room.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
Scientists have said there is overwhelming evidence...
that the two Earths...
All right, that's enough.
It's time for you to go.
So... Wait.
Is that it for the free trial?
Yeah, it's a one-day trial.
Um, all right.
So I'll see you next week.
I'll let them know.
They might send someone else.
- Okay.
- Same time, same...
Yeah, this is a good time.
This is a good day too.
So, Jeff, I think we've got a pretty important toast in order.
- What do you think, huh?
- Hey, hey, hey! Hold on, hold on!
I just got the cider.
Come on, guys, it's not that big of a deal.
- Oh!
- It is a big deal.
You've shown perseverance in the face of adversity.
You deserve to be saluted for that, Son.
Come on, Rho-tard.
Aren't you gonna ask what happened?
What happened?
- I got into UConn.
- And we are so proud of you!
Hear, hear!
Chin-chin!
Cheers.
Mr. Burroughs?
I came to tell you that I saw you at the site of the accident.
And I'm sorry for what happened to you and your family.
It was my fault.
Mr. Burroughs.
- Oh. Good.
- Mr. Burroughs.
- I...
- Come on in.
You can start where you finished.
I was wondering if I could talk with you about something.
Not now. A little bit later.
I'm finished.
Check's on the kitchen table.
We're not real.
W- We're not real.
We're a projection of the imagination of Earth Two.
Hmm.
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,
the United States, planet Earth.
Do you read me?
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,
the United States, planet Earth.
Do you read me?
Is anyone out there?
Let's try another channel.
I repeat...
this is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,
the United States, planet Earth.
We... you.
We read you.
...clear...
Copy.
Verified?
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI.
Is someone there?
Do you read me?
This is Dr. Joan T-Tallis.
We're getting feedback.
Hello?
Hello?
My name is Joan Tallis.
- Whoa! No way!
- I am the director of SETI.
- Dude!
- In Mountain View, California.
When were you born?
May 7, 1954.
When were you born?
May 7, 1954.
Mount Pleasant, New York.
Robinson Hope Hospital.
I took a trip to Cape Canaveral when I was a kid.
Did you?
Yes. I was 11.
What did you buy at the gift store?
Space food.
I thought I would be going to space.
I bought these... astro strawberries.
- What?
- Oh, come on.
- No way, dude! No way!
- What does that... What does that mean?
It's... It's... Listen.
What does that mean?
I don't understand what that means.
Kimberly, it's just an elaborate hoax.
- There's gotta be an explanation.
- We're all gonna die.
- Wait, wait!
- We are all gonna die.
It would be very hard to think
"I am over there"...
and "Can I go meet me?"...
and "Is that me better than this me?"
"Can I learn from the other me?"
"Has the other me made the same mistakes I've made?"
Or, "Can I sit down and have a conversation with me?"
Wouldn't that be an interesting thing?
The truth is, we do that all day long every day.
People don't admit it and they don't think about it too much, but they do.
Every day, they're talking in their own head.
"What's he doing?"
"Why'd he do that?"
"What did she think?"
"Did I say the right thing?"
In this case, there's another you out there.
Wanna take a look?
My God.
Yeah.
Wow.
You're up there and I'm up there.
It's just too much.
I wonder if I'm cleaning your house.
Ha!
Maybe.
- Total's 29.
- Thank you.
Can you hand me a paper towel?
Thanks.
If you wanna join me...
Round one.
You can come in.
Knockout.
You wanna play?
I don't know how.
It's easy.
It's easy.
You're a fighter, I'm sure.
The controller's up on the...
Hold the big one in your right hand.
- You okay playing boxing?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
To block shots, you put your hands up.
Face.
And you... You know, you lean and stuff.
And then for swinging, you just swing.
That's it.
All right?
- Round one.
- Fight.
You gotta fight back.
Don't forget your uppercut.
- One! Two!
- My guy's, uh, on the ground.
That's it.
- Knockout!
- God.
How do I hook my...
You gotta swing.
You gotta swing. It's okay.
Easy.
Yeah. Try and break through this.
Okay. That one...
I gave you.
Knockout!
- Player one wins!
- Okay.
Well...
That it, or you got another one in you?
I thought so.
I didn't see your car.
I take Metro-North.
I'll give you a lift.
No, that's all right.
No, it's too cold to wait for the train.
I don't mind the cold.
Really, it's okay.
Okay.
It's typical for planets...
like Mercury, Venus,
Mars and Jupiter...
to have a period during their orbit...
in which they are obscured by the sun...
and no long observable from Earth.
It's called superior conjunction.
If they remain behind the sun...
So, are you from New Haven?
Yeah.
- Still have family there?
- Mm-hmm.
You like working at Maid in Haven?
It's all right.
Yeah. Have you been doing it long?
Couple months.
- You see that Joan Tallis broadcast?
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.
- I can't stop thinking about it.
Another me up there somewhere.
If you met yourself, what would you say?
"Hey, you up for a video game?"
Probably beat me.
What would you say?
"Better luck next time. "
- Really?
- No, no.
No, I mean...
I'm sure I'd be speechless.
Up at the corner here is good.
Right here, and then you can just...
No, I'll take you to your house.
Is this it?
Yeah, okay. Right. Turn.
- Yeah, just to the side behind tha van.
- Okay.
- All right. So I'll see you next week.
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the lift.
- Sure.
Oh, um, you know...
I'm sorry. My memory's not what it used to be. I forgot your name.
I don't think I ever told you.
Really?
That's not very polite of me.
So, it's...
Rhoda.
Rhoda. All right.
Good night, Rhoda.
I'll see you next week.
Good night.
Listen to me.
Keep your mind clear.
And that's it.
You will have peace of mind.
My dear, don't worry.
Learn to adjust yourself.
The distance is not inordinately great.
But one of the challenges you have...
on interplanetary travel...
Is prolonged weightless conditions.
You're in zero "G."
There is a possibility of cosmic rays coming from stars,
and that could be dangerous to them.
But once there,
you have no idea what you're about to encounter.
What really are the beings on this other planet like?
What happened?
I tried to do too much.
Thanks.
You know that story of the Russian cosmonaut?
Mm-mmm.
Thanks.
- So, the cosmonaut.
- Mm-hmm.
He's the first man ever to go into space.
Right? The Russians beat the Americans.
Mm-hmm.
So he goes up in this big spaceship, but the only habitable part of it's very small.
So the cosmonaut's in there, and he's got this portal window, and he's looking out of it, and he sees the curvature of the Earth... for the first time.
I mean, the first man to ever look at the planet he's from.
And he's lost in that moment.
And all of a sudden this strange ticking...
Begins coming out of the dashboard.
Okay. Yeah.
Rips out the control panel, right?
Takes out his tools.
Trying to find the sound, trying to stop the sound.
But he can't find it.
He can't stop it. It keeps going.
Few hours into this, begins to feel like torture.
A few days go by with this sound, and he knows that this small sound... will break him.
He'll lose his mind.
What's he gonna do?
He's up in space, alone, in a space closet.
He's got 25 days left to go... with this sound.
So the cosmonaut decides... the only way to save his sanity... is to fall in love with this sound.
So he closes his eyes... and he goes into his imagination, and then he opens them.
He doesn't hear ticking anymore.
He hears music.
And he spends the remainder of his time... sailing through space in total bliss... and peace.
Why... are you cleaning houses?
I like to clean.
Nobody likes to clean.
Some people build houses, some people decorate them, some people clean them.
How old are you?
Did you go to college?
No.
I read.
A wise choice.
I was a college professor.
You learn more doing it by yourself.
Did you hear about that contest?
Mmm?
- The shuttle to Earth Two?
- Mmm.
I submitted an essay.
You did?
It's silly.
You'd go?
Yes.
You don't know what's out there.
That's why I would go.
It's a bad idea.
In Plato's allegory of the cave, the people living in the cave...
All they knew, what was in the cave, and one day one of them gets out... and goes out and... sees the real world, comes back and tells the others.
You know what happened to him?
They beat him up.
They didn't believe it.
"T hat can't be," they said.
I don't think we're ready to know what's out there.
It's a bad idea.
So you'd rather stay in the cave?
I mean, if Galileo had felt that, we'd still think we're the center of the universe, that the sun is orbiting us.
I mean... They tried to burn him at the stake for that.
Yeah, maybe they should have.
We still think we're the center of the universe.
We call ourselves Earth One, and them Earth Two.
You think they called themselves Earth Two?
- Probably not.
- Did you wash that?
- Did you wash that sweater?
- Yeah. Yes. I didn't dry it. I...
- I laid it...
- Give me that.
Why did you wash that?
Stop washing things.
Just stop washing things!
Leave them alone! Please!
Just go!
This isn't a planet with little green men and blue avatars.
It's essentially a mirror Earth.
If we strike them, they could strike us.
If we attempt to enslave them, they could enslave us.
It's the perfect scenario for mutually assured destruction.
Preparations are nearing completion...
for interplanetary travel to Earth Two.
The modified Saturn 5 rocket has undergone rigorous testing...
to meet federal aerospace guidelines.
Protesters are calling this a modern-day Tower of Babel.
Where's Purdeep?
Checked out.
When's he coming back?
I don't think he is.
Poured bleach in his ears.
What?
Yeah.
Why would he do that?
Look. I don't know.
I mean, why'd he pour bleach in his eyes?
- He blinded himself?
- Yeah.
You didn't know?
He said he was tired of seeing himself everywhere.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, would you mind coming around to the passenger side?
- Just 'cause there's traffic and...
- Oh.
I tried to reach you at your work, but they said they had never heard of you.
Um, management changes there all the time.
Is that why none of my checks have been cashed?
That's weird. L...
It must've slipped through their books.
I mean,
I've been getting paid, so...
Okay. Well...
Anyway, that's...
That's not why I'm here.
I wanted to apologize for the other day.
- You know, I just...
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been...
...touching things in your room.
- No, it's not...
It's not your fault.
I should not have gotten upset.
I'm sorry.
Can I take you somewhere... and show... show you something?
Right now?
Yeah.
- I have to help my mom out, but...
- Please, come with me?
The best seat in the house is this row, right here.
Uh, it's the one in the middle.
Okay.
Just a little out of tune.
That's better, huh?
I'd finally got to a content place in my life.
Our son was five, and my wife was pregnant with a girl.
And then... they were killed.
Drunk driver.
A teenager.
I was in a coma.
And I was sleeping all the time.
And I was so... angry.
So afraid of what I might do to that kid.
You know?
So I made sure my brother got all the court documents.
The driver was a minor, so I never found out the name.
Are you still there?
He can't hear or see anything.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Rhoda.
You are wondering why.
No.
No.
No.
You know why.
Oh, Rhoda.
Yeah, I got some information you might want to hear.
Shoot a three for it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Wait. Wait.
Um, I'll give you a hint.
Do you wanna get high?
With you?
No, no.
Do you want to get high?
They called.
Number's on your door.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Wait. Hey.
You better write back to me this time, okay?
United Space Ventures,
Keith Harding's office.
Hello. This is, uh,
Rhoda Williams.
My brother gave me this number.
Rhoda, yes.
Just a moment.
- Rhoda?
- Yes.
Hi. It's Keith Harding.
I got your letter.
I was very moved by it.
You know, when I was 15,
my headmaster said to me... he said, uh,
"Harding, you'll either go to prison or be a millionaire. "
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm grateful it was the latter.
But, uh, it's a fine line.
And finer than you would think.
You still want to go to space, Rhoda?
Do I...
Yes.
Well, you can.
The seat is yours.
Kerry'll be in touch with you with the details.
I'll see you soon.
Within our lifetimes, we have marveled...
as biologists have managed to look at ever smaller and smaller things.
And astronomers have looked further and further...
into the dark night sky, back in time and out in space.
But maybe the most mysterious of all...
is neither the small nor the large.
It's us, up close.
Could we even recognize ourselves?
And if we did, would we know ourselves?
What would we say to ourselves?
What would we learn from ourselves?
What would we really like to see...
if we could stand outside ourselves...
and look at us?
Hi.
A nice surprise.
You're all dressed up.
Do you remember that essay contest I told you about?
Travel to Earth Two?
Uh-huh.
I won.
I'm gonna go to space.
You won. That's great.
That's fantastic.
We have to celebrate. Come here.
Come on. We have to.
Come here.
We have to celebrate.
First things first... is to start with a drink.
We have to celebrate.
I can't believe...
How many people...
How many people wrote in?
That is...
I'm so happy for you.
To the coming true of your most improbable dream.
Congratulations.
Next step is a feast.
- I'm gonna cook you a celebration feast.
- Yeah.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay, uh, food.
We need food first.
And... do they know how prepared you are?
I mean, with the Joan Tallis costume, for Halloween?
I will be fully trained in the Mojave Desert.
Oh. Well, that's comforting.
They made me sign this waiver.
Basically every other line of it says, "If you die, it's your fault. "
And you seem... you seem totally okay with that.
You know, you'll need an executor for your will.
Do you have one?
No, but I don't have anything.
Okay, so nothing to no one.
Sounds pretty easy.
I think I could handle that.
Um, burial or cremation?
I think my body would probably burn up on reentry.
Or be lost in space, so...
Okay. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
We'll have to hold a memorial service.
Who would you like to attend?
I don't know.
You?
Don't go.
Please don't go.
We're so close to something here.
We can't.
Why can't we?
- You know that we can't.
- I know that we have.
Stay, please?
Let me tell you a story.
And if, after, you still want me to stay,
I will stay.
It's about a girl.
At the start, she's... naive, reckless.
She does something that is... unforgivable.
And one day, she goes to apologize.
But she loses her nerve.
She's weak.
She lies to him.
And then... she thinks that she might, in the smallest ways, be able to make his life just a little bit better.
And so she wakes up every day just to do that.
And some days she thinks it's for him.
Other days, she worries that it's for herself, that it was really just a way to survive what I have done.
But I think that
I do make you happy.
Oh, my God.
I know that you make me happy.
It was my fault.
I killed your wife and your son.
You better leave.
Get out.
Get out now!
Now!
The mystery flight member is 21-year-old Rhoda Williams,
who is rumored to be an ex-convict.
Her records are off-limit to the public,
as the alleged crime occurred when she was under age.
There are reports of offers up to three million dollars on the Web...
for a ticket aboard USV's flight.
We're getting word now that she's arriving at her residence in New Haven,
...where Robert Hughes is standing by.
- Oh. Oh. Can you get...
Right here.
Rhoda, are you going to space?
- Rhoda Williams.
- Rhoda.
Just one photo.
Rhoda.
You couldn't have told us?
- We had to find out from the media?
- I ju...
I just found out.
I wasn't sure I wanted to go.
I didn't...
Are you going?
I'm gonna go.
Well, now... now, wait a minute.
I mean, don't you think we... we should have a discussion about this?
Oh, they're in the backyard now.
Look, Rob...
Rhoda. Rhoda.
Joining me now from Washington, D.C.,
astrophysicist
Dr. Richard Berendzen,
the original proponent of this extraordinary
Broken Mirror Theory.
Dr. Berendzen, tell me the significance of this theory,
why it excites you and how this changes...
the possibilities of the planet known as Earth Two.
In the grand history of the cosmos,
more than 13,000 million years old,
our Earth is replicated elsewhere.
But maybe there's another way of seeing this world.
If any small variation arises...
they look this way, you look that way...
suddenly, maybe everything changes,
and now you begin to wonder,
what else is different?
Or one might say that...
you have an exact mirror image which suddenly is shattered,
and there's a new reality.
And therein lies the opportunity...
and the mystery.
What else?
What new? What now?
Stay away!
Get away from me.
- Please let me in. Please. Just...
- Stay... Stay away from me!
Stay away!
John?
- John?
- Stay away from me.
John, please let me in.
- Stay away from me!
- Open the door.
- I'm warning you, stay away from me!
- Please.
I have something I have to explain.
I have to tell you. Please.
Wait.
Okay...
John.
Do it.
I heard on TV about a theory.
They think... that the moment we first saw the other Earth... was the moment our synchronicity was broken.
That was just over four years ago.
Maybe they're up there.
Maybe not, but... maybe.
We are just days before the launch...
of the United Space Ventures' civilian shuttle.
Members of the crew of this dangerous voyage...
have been training intensely here at the Mojave Spaceport.
The media blackout was finally lifted...
with a press conference early this morning.
I'm feeling privileged,
and,
oddly, I'm proud.
And, of course, nervous and excited.
The modified Saturn 5 rocket...
- See you, Freddie.
- ... has undergone rigorous testing...

Mother, what are you...
I thought you were a burglar.
I didn't mean to scare you darling,
I was just getting a snack.
Go back to bed.
What's the matter?
Go on, back to bed.
I'll make you  hot chocolate.
Who are you?
And what have you done with my mother?
(Charles' Mentally speaking)
**My  mother has never set foot in this kitchen in her life.**
**And she certainly wouldn't have made me hot chocolate.**
**Unless she kept ordering me to do it.**
You're not scared of me?
I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world.
The only person who is...
...different.
And here you are,
Charles Xavier.
Raven.
You're hungry, and alone?
Take whatever you want.
We've got lots of food, you don't have to steal.
In fact...
...you never have to steal again.
Hetro-chromia.
A gentlemen would at least offer to buy me a drink first.
Newman, a pint of bitter for me and a brandy for the lady, please.
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.
The name's, Xavier,
Charles Xavier.
- How do you do...
- Amy.
Hetrochromia, is in reference to your eyes, which I have to say are stunning.
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.
It's a very groovy mutation.
I've got news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.
First you proposition a girl, and then you call her, deformed.
How is that seduction tactic working for you?
I'll tell you in the morning.
No, seriously though, you mustn’t knock it.
Mutation's go from single cell organisms to being the dominate form of reproductive life, on this planet.
Infinite forms of variations with each generation.
All through, mutation.
Then let's reclaim that word.
- Mutant, and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.
I'm sorry, one cola.
Charles here was just telling me that I'm like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.
Tiny bit sexier.
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.
-Hi, Amy.
-And what do you study?
- Waitressing.
- Aah.
Oh look, you have hetero-chromia too!
- Say, what?
- Look at her eye..
Right, Raven get your coat please.
Don't talk to me, you did that on purpose.
- I did not!
- Yes you did!
Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.
- When I'm stressed or tired..
- You seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now.
"Mutant and proud"
Why is it always the pretty mutations, or invisible ones like yours.
If you're a freak, better hide.
You're being ridiculous!
Look, I don't mean to sound like an old fart.
- Which you are.
- Sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.
"Mutant and proud"
"Mutant and proud"?
If only...
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.
Any young man would be lucky to have you.
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?
Like, you...what?
Blue?
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.
Thank you for that.
Well?
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way,
I feel responsible for you.
Anything else would just feel wrong.
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately I do know you.
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.
Well fine, read about your thesis it always sends me right off.
To Homo neanderthalensis, his  mutant cousin Homo sapiens, was an aberration.
Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed, was short lived.
Records show, without exception that the arrival of the mutated human species in any region was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.
Another day at the office.
Is that Colonel Hendry?
- The NATO guy?
- Yeah.
Yes it is.
'Cause that's three mob bosses,, the Italian ambassador and the CEO of Lockheed.
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.
Do you see that?
Hello, girls!
Wow, very nice.
Wha...what are you doing?
Here's things that the CIA didn't give me.
Stay put.
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associate.
And where is, Mr. Shaw?
We're having a party, and here's the entertainment.
Come with me.
Hello beautiful, how are you?
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?
I'm so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.
Excuse me.
- Are you sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?
- No.
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- We've had this conversation.
You put our nukes in Turkey, or anywhere that close to Russia, and you're looking at war.
Nuclear war.
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.
The only thing I will reconsider, is having another glass of that delicious champagne.
What the hell did you put in my drink?
**You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.**
**There's not a fortress in the world that can keep us out.**
Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?
Genetic mutation, the evolution of the human genome.
Where's Azazel?
Ah, we don't want the Colonel to be late.
Come here.
Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.
We ever decided to fire them, the Russian early warning system won't even have time to kick in.
This better be important, MacTaggert
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.
Colonel Hendry?
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.
Colonel Hendry is here.
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop wasting my time.
Looks like Hendry wants to start
World War III.
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.
Sir, I...!
Have you lost your mind?
So, now what?
We find an expert on Genetic Mutation.
Professor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.
So, how does it feel to be a professor?
Well, don't call me that. You don't get to be called a
Professor until you actually have a teaching position.
- I know, but it suits you.
- No, don't say that, do say "Lets go have a drink".
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful!
- Good evening, my friends!
- Good evening!
- Hot, no?
- Yes...
One beer, please.
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.
I'm looking for my creator.
Drink, drink, drink!
Oh, I'm so proud of  you.
I need another drink, and you need another cola.
- Congratulations, Professor!
- Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually..
- No, on your presentation.
- You knew my presentation?
How nice of you, thank you very much.
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Charles Xavier.
Do you have a minute?
For a pretty little beam with a mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.
I say, MCR-1, you would say, golden hair.
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.
Mutation you know, took us from single celled organisms, to the dominate form...
You know what, this routine may go over great with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.
- What?
- I really need your help.
All right.
The kind of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis
I need to know if they may have already happened.
In people alive today.
Professor?
I think we should just talk when you're sober.
Do you have any time tomorrow?
Something tells me, you already know the answer to your question.
This is very important to me.
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.
Thank you.
- Still drinking champagne, Bob?
- I will pass.
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.
I was wondering, who you told about our little arrangement?
No one.
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?
Well I knew better than to trust you.
Now you let me walk out of here with my money.
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.
Go ahead, pull it.
I'll do it, I swear to god.
No you won't.
But I will.
You're one of them?
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.
That's the boring part.
The fun stuff is what I can do with it once I got it.
The advent of the nuclear age, may have accelerated the mutation process.
Individual's with extraordinary abilities may already be among us.
Thank you very much.
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist, is going to make me believe in sparkly dames and vanishing men?
You just brought yourself a one way ticket back to the typing pool.
This meeting is over.
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.
I didn't really expect you to believe me.
Given that all you could think about during my presentation, was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.
It's apple pecan.
I haven't been entirely honest with you, luv, I'm sorry.
You see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do.
Is that I can read your  mind.
I've seen this before in a magic show.
Are you going to ask us to think of a number between one and ten now?
No, agent Stryker.
Although I could ask  you about your son William who you were thinking about, which is very nice
But I think I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter...
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!
I did not, I would never bring one here!
How's that for a magic trick?
Best I've ever seen.
I want them out of here.
And lock down until I can figure out what to do.
My facility is off site. I'll take them.
I can't believe this.
You'd think the director of the CIA would have a little more composure.
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.
What are we doing to do, Lavene?
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?
**Absolutely nothing, I've just frozen him for the moment because I'd like to talk to you.**
**It's good, isn't it?**
**I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,**
**...and if you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage.**
I've always known that there were people like you out there.
I've been the laughing stock of this agency for years but I knew it.
You're going to love my facility.
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw, and if we don't move now apparently we're going to loose him.
What?
Not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well.
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!
But I cannot take you anywhere else, without permission from upstairs.
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.
Herr Doctor...
He's here to kill you.
Emma...
We don't harm our own kind.
Ah, now it's a party.
This is the US Coast guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.
Stay where you are.
They have a telepath.
I've lost, Shaw!
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.
There's, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.
I think there's someone like me on that ship.
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.
This is incredible, I can actually feel her inside my mind.
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be much help to you tonight.
You're on your own.
- Oh my god.
- Jesus.
Get inside.
Stop, stop, stop!
Charles!
You okay?
There's someone else out there.
There!
Time to go.
Let go!
Better let it go!
You've got help him...there's someone in the water, help him!
Let it go!
You have to let it go!
**You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.**
**I know what this means to you but you're going to die.**
**Please, Erik, calm your mind.**
Get off of me, get off!
Calm down, please.
We're here!
- Who are you?
-  My name's Charles Xavier.
You were in my head.
How did you do that?
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you, just calm your mind.
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.
Erik, you're not alone.
Welcome to my facility.
My mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers for military defense.
Or offense.
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever you want to call him.
He's working with the Russians.
We might need your help to stop them.
Marvelous.
So we're to be the CIA's new mutant division, yes?
Something like that.
It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane ever built.
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.
Hank, these are the special new recruits I was telling you about.
This is, Hank McCoy,
One of our most talented young researchers.
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?
Because you don't know.
I am so, so terribly sorry!
Hank?
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.
So  your mutation's what?
You're super smart?
I'll say, Hank here graduated honors at the age of fifteen.
I wish that's all it was.
You're among friends now, Hank.
You could show off.
Splendid.
- Sorry.
- Yes, yes.
- You're amazing.
- Really?
The presence of U.S. missiles in Turkey represents an unprecedented threat to the people of the Soviet Union.
Warned Russian Mister Gromeko, earlier today
But he was quick to insist the Russians would not be the first to initiate any military action.
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as we get to Russia.
- Unless the CIA finds us first.
- I'll take care of them too.
If that telepath gets inside your head, he won't be as much fun as I am.
Already in hand, my love.
The Russians...
...made me this.
So, what am I thinking?
I don't know.
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing I've ever seen in my life.
And that this needs ice.
Fetch me some.
There's a good girl.
I, I promised myself I'd find a cure.
Ever since I was a little boy.
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...
- ...normal.
- Normal.
Charles has never understood.
He's different, but he's never had to hide.
Hank this serum that you're making, it doesn't affect abilities, right?
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.
Yeah.
Do you think it would work on me?
I can look into it, if you'd like.
That's the least I can do after asking you to come down here to such a weird request.
I have to admit, usually when guys ask me out they're not after my blood.
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.
You know, the nature of your mutation.
If any genes hold the key to changing appearance, it's yours.
Hank, you aren't being forward, that's kinda what I meant.
- No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
- And I'm sorry that you weren't.
Go ahead, take the blood.
Sorry, did I hurt you?
Kinky!
By the way, if I looked like you,
I wouldn't change a thing.
What I know about you, I'm surprised you've managed to stay this long.
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.
Then you know to stay out of my head.
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what
Shaw did to you.
I felt your agony.
I can help you.
I don't need your help.
Don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night.
It's  not just me you're walking away from.
Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself.
I won't stop you leaving, I could.
But I won't.
Shaw's got friends.
You could do with some.
Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter.
It's designed to amplify brain waves,
...so it could enhance your telepathic powers.
Help us find other mutants for our division.
What if they don't want to be found by you?
Erik.
You decided to stay.
If a new species is being discovered, it should be by its own kind.
Charles and I find the mutants, no suits.
First of all, that's my machine out there.
Second of all, and much more importantly, this is Charles' decision.
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.
Isn't that right?
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.
We'll find them alone.
What if I say no?
Then good luck using your installation without me.
I call it, Cerebro.
- Isn't that Spanish for "brain"?
- Yes.
Okay so, the electrodes connect
Charles to the transmitter on the roof.
And picks up a mutant.
His brain sends a signal through a relay.
And then the co-ordinates of their location are printed out here.
- You designed this?
- Yeah.
- What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
- Don't spoil this for me, Erik.
I've been a lab rat, I know one when I see one.
Okay, right...
- Are you sure we can't shave your head?
- Don't touch my hair.
It's working!
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.
You cat's know it's double for both, right?
No, that won't be necessary. although I'm sure we...
We were thinking, we'll show you ours,
...if you show us yours.
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.
- More tea, Vicar?
- Don't mind if I do.
My turn.
How would you like a job, where you get to keep your clothes on?
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?
No we were rather hoping you would take us all the way.
That's a six hour drive.
That will give us plenty of time to talk.
What the hell does the government want with a guy like, Alex Summers?
I hope you're not planning on putting him with others.
First guy I ever met who actually prefers solitary confinement.
- Crazy, huh?
- What?
You like fish, I like fish too.
Maybe we should get a bite some time and talk about it.
I'd rather go out with the fish.
These fish?
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lensher.
- Charles Xavier.
Go fuck yourselves.
- There's nothing on radar?
- No.
- Sonar?
- No.
Then we have a problem.
Beautiful, isn't it?
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.
We have a situation.
The telepath...
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.
It's like his reach is...
...amplified.
They're recruiting.
You go on to Russia,
I'll handle him.
I can't stop thinking about the others out there.
All those minds that I've touched.
I could feel them, their isolation, their hopes, their ambitions.
I tell you, we've started something incredible, Erik.
- We can help them.
- Can we?
Identification, that's how it starts.
Then ends with being rounded up.
Experimented on, eliminated.
Not this time.
We have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians they need us.
For now.
We should think of code names.
We're government agents now, we should have secret code names.
- I want to be called, Mystique.
- Damn, I wanted to be called, Mystique.
- Well tough, I called it.
Damn right, I'm more mysterious than you.
- Darwin, what about you?
- Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.
Check this out.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bravo, bravo.
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...
...Banshee.
Why do you want to be named after a wailing spirit?
You might want to cover your ears.
Your turn.
My stage name is Angel.
Kind of fits.
- You can fly?
-  Ah, hah. And uh...
- What's your name?
- How about Big Foot?
Well you know what they say about guys with big feet?
And uh, yours are kind of small.
Okay, now.
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.
- I can't do it in here.
- Can you do it out there?
- Why don't you just do it out there.
- Come on.
-Come on, Alex.
Alex! Alex!
That's the spirit.
Get down when I tell you.
Get back.
Get back!
Whatever...
We've got Intel that Shaw is meeting with the Russian defense chief in Moscow.
So go ahead, say it.
I'm not here to say "I told you so", you know why I'm here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring along your mutants.
Fight fire with fire.
Makes sense.
Wait, you're okay with this?
Sending in a bunch of untrained unauthorized freaks?
These "Freaks" are dedicated hard working people.
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.
I'm telling you these kids are not ready for, Shaw.
I think they're going to surprise you.
They are an exceptional bunch of young people.
What the hell?
Harder!
What are  you doing?
- Who destroyed the statue?
- It was, Alex.
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok.
That's his name now.
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X
And you should be, Magneto.
Exceptional.
I expect more from you.
We've got a problem.
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right.
Now listen to me..
To our farm.
As you wish, as you wish.
Oh, easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.
- Where's Shaw?
- I know her.
If she's the telepath, and I read her, she'll know we're here.
Let me try something else.
Shaw sends his apologies, but he's indisposed.
He asked me to come in his place.
But between you and I honey,
I'm a lot better company.
Please come in.
He's not coming.
- So, what now, boss?
- Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
- Mission aborted
- The hell it is.
- Erik.
-She's his right hand woman.
That's good enough for me.
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official.
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.
Erik!
So you must be busy planning your next move.
What with the American's refusing to remove their missiles from Turkey.
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.
Emma.
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.
He's going to start world war III single handed.
- We have to do something.
- Like what?
- We're moving out.
- You can't.
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.
For goodness sake, Erik...
Be calm.
Be calm.
Forget my face. Yes.
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.
Pathetic.
Nice trick.
Who are  you?
Go to sleep.
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.
You're never going to get anything from me while I'm like this.
So then you can just tell us.
Where is Shaw?
Erik.
Erik, that's enough.
Erik, that's enough!
All yours.
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.
We are the children of the atom.
Radiation gave birth to mutants.
What will kill the humans, will only make us stronger.
Beautiful, isn't it?
This is worse that we previously imagined.
We're taking you with us.
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.
Might be other things to worry about right now.
Whoa, all right.
- Jesus, man you are killing me.
- Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.
Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot let's go.
Hey, hey come on, hey.
They're just guys being stupid.
Guy's being stupid I can handle.
Okay, I've handled that my whole life.
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys stare at me with my clothes off, then the way these one's stare at me.
At us.
What was that?
I don't know, but something doesn't feel right.
- No news of Shaw?
- Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.
What is that?
We have an intruder on the main atrium.
- Where are the mutants?
- You take another step, I'm going to put you down.
Of course you will, but where do I find the more evolved people?
Send back-up now!
Get back, get back, do not leave that room.
We're under attack.
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!
Where are the mutants?
Put that man down or we will open fire.
Stay here my ass.
Let's go!
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!
Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.
Just let us normal people go.
We're no threa...
Where's the telepath?
- Not here.
- To bad.
Now I can take this silly thing off.
Good evening
My name's, Sebastian Shaw.
And I am not here to hurt you.
Freeze!
Azazel...
My friends, there's a revolution coming.
When mankind discovers who we are, what we can do.
Each of us will face a choice.
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us, then by definition you are against us.
So, you can stay, and fight for the people who hate, and fear you.
Or you can join me.
And live like kings.
And Queens.
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?
Come on, we don't belong here.
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
We have to do something.
Stop, I'm coming with you.
Good choice.
So tell me about your mutation.
Well, I adapt to survive.
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.
- Alex,...............do it!
- Get down!
Protecting your fellow mutants?
It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.
Adapt to this.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
You will make this happen.
Okay.
Let's see what KGB think about this.
Hello, General Armivolkoff.
It's nothing.
Raven.
We've made arrangements for you to be taken home immediately.
- We're not going home.
- What?
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed, Darwin.
All the more reason for you to leave.
This is over.
Darwin's dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.
We can avenge him.
Erik, word please.
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.
Shaw has his army, we need ours.
We'll have to train.
All of us.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
Well we can't stay here.
Even if they reopen the department, it's not safe.
We've got no where to go.
Yes, we do.
The law says we've got to turn her over.
The law applies to human beings.
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're to dangerous.
Times like this, security is more important than liberty.
- There's a war coming, John.
- Yes, but a war with who?
Excellent question.
Though I won't call it a war exactly.
That suggests both sides stand an equal chance of winning.
The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.
Our fleet can be on this line, when the Russian missile ship arrives.
If that ship crosses the line, they will have declared war against the United States.
We will have no choice but to retaliate with a full nuclear response.
Do we agree?
Dispatch the Seventh fleet.
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.
Living in such hardship.
Well it was a hardship softened by me.
Come on, time for the tour.
Dear comrades.
The United States have dispatched war ships for Cuba.
This leaves us with no choice.
Comrade First Secretary.
We must send in our fleet.
Dispatch the fleet!
President Kennedy has signed a formal proclamation.
Setting up a blockade of all missiles, armed for Cuba.
The Soviet Union reacted by terming it as step along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
All right.
No, no I can't I'm sorry.
I can't shoot anybody point blank, let alone my friend.
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.
You're always telling me I should push myself.
If you know you can deflect it, then you're not challenging yourself.
What ever happened to the man who was trying to raise a submarine?
What, I can't.
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.
No, the anger's not enough.
It's gotten the job done all this time.
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.
Hey, come here.
Let's try something a little more challenging.
My step-father took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously.
This way.
That's why he had this bunker built down here.
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?
No, he had this place built to with stand a nuclear bomb.
I think it can handle you, Alex.
You know when I do this, bad things tend to happen.
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's part of your training.
What you're doing is incredible.
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves that's at the same resonate frequency of the glass.
That's why it shatters.
This it's like any other muscle in the body.
You can control it.
"In each of us, two natures are at war."
Robert Louis Stevenson,
"Jekyll and Hyde".
Top marks.
Still it really wasn't really about good and evil. Was it, Hank.
It was about man's animal nature, and his struggle to control it.
To conform.
It is that struggle which is holding you back.
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.
You are too.
If you're serious about me doing this, you might want to get back.
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.
Whenever you're ready.
Oh my god.
I will teach you to control this, Alex.
You're sure that this will work.
Anything is possible. I based the design...
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.
Catch them at the right angle, and they should carry you.
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.
Good luck.
And don't forget to scream.
If you want to beat me this time, you have to set the beast free.
On your marks, get set...GO!
Oh, congratulations my friend.
Robert Louis Stevenson would have been proud.
Impressive, Hank.
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.
Right, Bozo?
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex
Come on, Hank.
If you're using half the concentration to look normal.
Then you're only half paying attention to whatever else you do.
Just pointing out something that could save your life.
You want society to accept you.
But you can't even accept yourself.
Sexy.
This is just the prototype.
The real one will look considerably better, it'll be a whole suit.
See these sensors measure your energy output, this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.
All right try hitting the one in the middle, just the one in the middle, mind.
Good luck.
You ought to see this. Your genes are extraordinary, you know that.
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.
When you're forty you will still have the looks of a teenager.
You have the most incredible cellular structure I've ever seen.
You truly believe I'll fly this time?
Unreservedly.
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.
I'm going to die!
All right, look we're not going to make you do anything that your not so...
Here, let me help him.
Erik!
Whaoooo!
Wahhh hooo!
What?
You know you were thinking the same.
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.
I have complete and utter faith in you.
- Am I still a Bozo?
- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.
But nice job.
See that?
Try turning it to face us.
You know, I believe the true focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity.
Would you mind, if I...?
What did you just do to me?
I accessed the brightest corner of your memory system.
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.
I didn't know I still had that.
There's so much more to you than you know.
Not just pain, and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.
And when you can access all that.
You will possess a power no one can match.
Not even me.
So, come on. Try again.
- Hey!
-Well done.
The President is about to make his address.
It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile,
...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba.
As an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.
Requiring a full retaliatory response.
Upon the Soviet Union.
- That’s' where we're going to find, Shaw'
- How do you know?
Two super powers facing off, and he want's to start world war III.
He won't leave anything to chance.
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good nights sleep.
...ultimately leads to war.
Tensions mount as the Soviet Missile ship nears Cuba.
All diplomatic efforts to avert
Nuclear war have thus far failed.
As the American people ready themselves, for the likelihood of an atomic attack.
There are widespread reports of panic wide.
Supermarkets cleared.
As shelters unused since the second world war,
are stocked for what may lie ahead.
In all its history, America has never faced a greater threat.
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.
Come in.
Hey.
Got a surprise for you.
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.
The serum works like an anti-biotic.
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.
It won't affect our abilities, just our appearance.
Do you still want to do this?
Should we have to hide?
You already do.
You're hiding right now.
Like I have my whole life.
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.
Yeah.
Hank, don't.
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.
Look at all of us. Look at all we've achieved this week.
All we will achieve.
We are different. But we shouldn't be trying to fit into society.
Society should aspire and be more like us.
Mutant, and proud.
It behooves me to tell you, but even if we save the world tomorrow.
And mutants are accepted into society.
My feet and your natural blue form.
Will never be deemed beautiful.
You look beautiful now.
We need this cure.
Cuba, Russia, America makes no difference.
Shaw's declared war on mankind, on all of us.
- He has to be stopped.
- I'm not going to stop Shaw, I'm going to kill him.
Do you have it in you to allow that?
You've known all along why I was here, Charles.
But things have changed.
What started as a covert mission,
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.
They'll fear us, and that fear will turn to hatred.
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent, Shaw.
Not if we risk our lives doing so.
Would they do the same for us?
We have it in us to be the better men.
We already are.
We're the next stage of human evolution.
- You said it yourself.
- Enough.
Are you really so naive?
As to think they won't battle their own extinction?
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry.
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us.
And you're blind to it, because you believe they're all like Moira.
And you believe they're all like, Shaw.
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.
Peace was never an option.
No.
No.
Well...
This is a surprise.
The nice kind?
No, Raven, why don't you go to bed.
Maybe in a few years.
How about now?
I prefer the real, Raven.
I said the real, Raven.
Perfection.
- Could you pass me my robe?
- You don't have to hide.
Have you ever looked at a tiger, and thought you'd want to cover it up?
No, but...
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.
Only in life the world tries to tame you.
It's time for you to be free.
You know sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like.
If you hadn't found me here that night.
Fairable, E..gah...ah.
For gods sake, Raven!
Where are you clothes?
Pu...put some, put some clothes on.
That's not what you said when you first saw me.
But I guess pets are always cuter when they're little, right?
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.
I thought you'd be in a good mood.
Hank tells me he's found the answer to your cosmetic problem.
You going to tell me what's the matter?
Or will I have to read your mind?
You promised me you would never do that.
Until recently, I never had to use my powers to know what you were thinking, Raven.
You know Charles, I used to think it was gonna be you and me against the world.
But no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you?
You want to be a part of it.
What the hell happened here?
Hank has been busy.
Do we really have to wear these?
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force, or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.
Where's Hank?
I'm here.
Hank?
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.
It didn't work.
Yes it did, Hank.
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.
This is you.
No more hiding.
Never looked better, man.
Hank!
Don't mock me.
Hank, put him down immediately, please.
Hank...HANK!
I wasn't.
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.
I think I got a new name for you, Beast.
- You sure you can fly this thing?
- Of course I can, I designed it.
Status of the cargo ship?
Bearing 1-8-0, 12 knots.
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.
God help them if they cross it.
God help us all.
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters.
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes sir.
Set conditions, zero.
General quarters, battle stations.
Gun boss, target cargo ship, bearing 1-8-0.
Fleet reports all weapons ready.
From the Kremlin, sir.
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.
Aral Sea, come in.
Aral Sea, come in.
They are not responding.
She's not turning around.
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
Do not cross the line.
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.
Looks pretty messy out there.
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.
He's still here, somewhere.
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.
That ship crosses the line, our boys are going to blow it up.
And the war begins.
Unless they're not on board.
USS Independence, this is, Alexander Nevski.
We have lost control of our cargo ship.
She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.
Repeat, do not fire.
They've signaled their cargo ship to turn around, sir.
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.
Five...four...
Hold on! Hold on!
No!
- What was that?
- The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.
A little warning next time, professor.
Sorry about that.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Son of a...
Give me Sin-clan on the horn, I want a new set of orders.
They say the comrade lost his mind.
The Americans' are applauding.
They're here.
That telepath is powerful.
We're moving to a back-up plan.
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.
But I still can't locate Shaw.
He's down there, we need to find him now.
Hank?
- Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners?
- No, nothing.
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.
Yes we do.
Yes we do.
They were ready for war.
We just need to strike another match to light the fuse.
And we still have the most powerful weapon of all.
Me.
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output and make sure I'm not disturbed.
Hank, level the bloody plane!
Whoa, you back right off.
Beast, open the Bombay doors.
Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.
- On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
- WHOA!!!
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cams off.
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.
You ready for this?
Let's find out.
**Remember, the point between rage and serenity.**
Erik, take my hand!
Oh, hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.
Erik, take my hand!
Down.
- Moira, Moira, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
I read the teleporter's mind.
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.
We've got no time, the Geiger counter's going out of control.
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.
Get on the radio and tell them to clear both fleet's out immediately.
I'm going in.
Beast, Havok, back him up.
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.
But I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me.
Then we just hope to god it's not to late for me to stop him.
- Got it.
- Good luck!
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.
We don't have time for this.
Anything comes in that entrance, you're taking care of it, yes?
Fine.
Beast!
If we go, you go
We believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb.
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.
We have to assume that, that's where Shaw is.
Gang way, gang way.
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.
Stop, don't move.
Get down!
**Erik you're there, you've reached the void.**
He's not here Charles,
Shaw is not here.
- He's left the sub.
- What? He's got to be there.
He has to be, there's no where else he can be, keep looking.
And I'm telling you he's not, there's no one here, god damn it!
Erik, what a pleasant surprise.
Erik?
Erik!
So good to see you again.
May I ask you something?
Why are you on their side?
- He's gone.
- What?
He's gone into the void. I can't communicate with him there.
Why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down,
...as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end.
Yeah!
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.
I truly am.
He's back.
**Erik, whatever you're doing keep doing it, it's starting to work.**
But everything I did,
I did for you.
To unlock your power. To make you embrace it.
**It's working.**
I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind.
You've come a long way from bending gates.
I'm so proud of you.
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.
Think how much further we could go, together.
Stop, Azazel!
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.
I want to help you.
This is our time.
Our age.
We are the future of the human race.
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.
Everything you did, made me stronger.
Made me the weapon I am today.
That's the truth.
I've known it all along.
You are my creator.
NOW, Charles!
Are you okay?
Moira be quiet, I can only control this man for so long.
Sorry, Charles.
**Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...**
But I don’t trust you.
** Erik, there will be no telling what...**
No.
- Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!
If you're in there, I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you've said.
We are the future.
But...
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.
This is what we're going to do.
No, please Erik, no.
I'm going to count to three.
And I'm going to move the coin.
One...
Please, Erik.
Two...
Three.
Aaaaaaaah!
The Russians share our concerns.
And will join a strike on all the mutants.
We can end this threat for good.
We'll never have another opportunity like this.
We have an agent on that beach.
- One agent.
- She's a good agent.
She's collateral damage.
Today our fighting stops.
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.
The real enemy is out there.
I feel their guns moving in the water.
Their metal targeting us.
Americans, Soviets, humans.
United in their fear of the unknown.
A Neanderthal is running scared, my fellow mutants.
Go ahead, Charles.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-7-zero.
Respond, over.
The beach is secure, call off the attack.
The beach is targeted and ready to be fired upon, sir.
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.
Hello?
Hello!
Fire.
Fire.
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.
This is the time to prove it.
There are thousands of men on those ships. getting orders, innocent men.
They're just following orders.
I've been at the mercy of men just following orders.
Never again.
Erik, release them.
Noooo!
I don't want to hurt you, don't make me.
Stay back!
Charles, enough.
Erik, stop!
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.
I'm so sorry.
I said back off!
You, you did this!
Please...
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.
Us turning on each other, it's what they want.
I tried to warn you, Charles.
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.
All of us, together. Protecting each other.
We want the same thing.
Oh, my friend.
I'm sorry, but we do not.
- Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
- It's all right, it's all right.
His society won't accept us.
We form our own.
The humans have played their hand.
Now we get ready to play ours.
Who's with me?
No more hiding.
You, you should go with him.
It's what you want.
You promised me you would never read my mind.
I know.
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.
I'm sorry.
Take care of him.
And Beast, never forget.
Mutant and proud.
Help me out, help him.
I'm going to get you to a hospital.
- Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.
In this week of thanksgiving.
There is much for which we can be grateful.
As you look back to where we stood, only four weeks ago.
The unity of this hemisphere, the support of our allies.
And the calm determination of the American people.
These qualities may be tested many more times.
In this decade.
So how many students do you think you'll have here?
Once you get the academy up and running.
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.
You know, one day the government is going to realize how lucky they were,
..to have Professor X on their side.
It has been on the road to a professor, aren't I.
Next thing I'll be going bald.
We're still on the government’s side, Moira.
Still a G-man, just without the G.
No, you're your own team now.
It's better.
You're, "X-Men".
Yes, I like the sound of that.
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.
I know.
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.
I'll never tell them where you are.
Ever.
I know you won't.
My love.
I remember the attack on HQ.
Leaving to go somewhere else.
And then this morning, I woke up at home.
That's it.
All that time wiped clean from your mind.
Just gone.
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA is no place for a woman.
What the hell was that?
I know we've had our differences.
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Gone.
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.
I was rather hoping you would fill it.
Join us.
Erik, I believe.
I prefer...
...Magneto.
Hurry!
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...
- ...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.
Are you seriously suggesting that we evacuate the entire planet?
No. Everybody here is already dead.
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.
There is still hope.
I have held that hope in my hands.
This council has been disbanded.
On whose authority?
Mine.
The rest of you will be tried and punished accordingly.
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...
...years ago.
These lawmakers...
...with their endless debates...
...have lead Krypton to ruin.
And if your forces prevail...
- ...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.
We'll sever...
...the degenerative bloodlines that led us to this state.
And who will decide which bloodlines survive, Zod?
You?
Don't do this, El.
The last thing I want is for us to be enemies.
You have abandoned the principles that bound us together.
You've taken up the sword...
...against your own people.
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...
...not this monster you've become.
Take him away.
Sir? Is everything all right?
Out of the way.
I said...
Get me Lara.
Jor. Behind you.
Lara, you have to ready the launch.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
H'Raka!
Hyah!
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.
But I'm compelled to warn you.
Breaching the genesis chamber is a Class-B crime...
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.
Jor-El, by the authority of General Zod...
...surrender the Codex.
Unh!
Ahhh!
Easy, H'Raka.
Did you find a world?
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...
...just as you said it would.
A young star.
His cells will drink its radiation.
It's a seemingly intelligent population.
He'll be an outcast.
A freak.
They'll kill him.
How?
He'll be a god to them.
What if the ship doesn't make it?
He'll die out there...
...alone.
I can't do it.
I thought I could, but...
- Lara.
...now that he's here...
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.
It's our people's only hope.
What is it, Kelex?
Five attack ships converging from the east.
Citadel's defenses are being scanned and evaluated.
I'll upload the Codex.
No, wait.
Lara.
Just let me look at him.
We'll never get to see him walk.
Never hear him say our names.
But out there...
...amongst the stars...
...he will live.
Goodbye, my son.
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.
Concentrate fire on the main doors.
Lady Lara.
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.
General.
We have identified an engine ignition within the citadel.
A launch.
Hold this platform, commander.
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.
Surrender it...
...and I'll let you live.
This is a second chance for all of Krypton...
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.
What have you done?
We've had a child, Zod.
A boy child.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.
Heresy.
Destroy it.
Ah!
Lara...
...listen to me.
The Codex is Krypton's future.
Abort the launch.
No!
Your son, Lara...
...where have you sent him?
His name...
...is Kal...
...son of El.
And he's beyond your reach.
Bring that ship down.
Target locked.
Lay down your weapons.
Your forces are surrounded.
General Zod...
...for the crimes of murder and high treason...
...the Council has sentenced you and your fellow insurgents...
...to three hundred cycles of somatic reconditioning.
Do you have any last words?
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...
...to a black hole for eternity!
Jor-El was right.
You're a pack of fools, every last one of you.
And you.
You believe your son is safe?
I will find him.
I will reclaim what you have taken from us.
I will find him.
I will find him, Lara.
I will find him!
Argh!
Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge?
There is no refuge, Kelor.
Jor-El was right.
This is the end.
Make a better world than ours, Kal.
Watch it, dumb-ass!
Keep your eyes open or you're gonna get squashed.
Where the hell did they find you, greenhorn?
Let's get this trap in the air.
Gentlemen, secure the deck.
We just got a distress call from a rig due west of us.
Secure the deck.
All civilian boats, stand clear.
The sub-sea valves failed and the rig is about to explode.
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...
...fetch me my binoculars.
Greenhorn.
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know how much longer we can hold out.
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.
Right here!
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Get that last guy loaded.
We have got to go.
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?
Go! Go!
Argh!
Argh!
...when Kansas became a territory?
Clark.
Are you listening, Clark?
I asked if you could tell me who first...
...settled Kansas.
Are you all right, Clark?
Clark.
Clark.
Clark!
Clark, come out of there.
Leave me alone.
Clark, I have called your mother.
Clark?
Ah!
I'm here.
Clark, honey, it's Mom.
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.
Crybaby.
His parents won't even let him play with other kids.
I know.
Sweetie.
How can I help you if you won't let me in?
The world's too big, Mom.
Then make it small.
Just, um...
...focus on my voice.
Pretend ifs an island...
...out in the ocean.
Can you see it?
I see it.
Then swim towards it, honey.
What's wrong with me, Mom?
Clark.
Clark.
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.
Hold it, hold it.
Hey, ass-wipe.
What do you think? You see the game?
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?
I wanna hear what he has to say.
Come on...
...dick-splash.
My son was there.
He was in the bus.
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was...
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.
This was providence.
I think you're blowing it out of proportion.
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.
And the Fordham boy.
This isn't the first time...
...Clark's done something like this.
I just wanted to help.
I know you did, but we talked about this.
Right?
Right? We talked about this. You have...
Clark, you have to keep this side of yourself a secret.
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?
Maybe.
There's more at stake here than just our lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.
When the world...
When the world finds out what you can do it's gonna change everything. Our...
Our beliefs, our notions of...
...what it means to be human.
Everything.
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared, Clark.
Why?
People are afraid of what they don't understand.
Is she right?
Did God do this to me?
Tell me.
We found you in this.
We were sure the government was gonna show up on our doorstep...
...but no one ever came.
This was in that chamber with you.
I took it to a metallurgist...
...at Kansas State.
He said whatever it was made from didn't even...
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.
That's another way of saying...
...that it's not from this world, Clark.
And neither are you.
You're the answer, son.
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"
I don't wanna be.
And I don't blame you, son.
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.
But you're not just anyone, Clark, and I have to believe that you were...
That you were sent here for a reason.
All these changes that you're going through, one day...
One day you're gonna think of them as a blessing. When that day comes...
...you have to make a choice.
A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?
You are my son.
But somewhere out there you've...
You have another father too, who gave you another name.
And he sent you here...
...for a reason, Clark.
And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself...
...to find out what that reason is.
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
Wait a second.
Aren't you here for the exercise?
No, there was a change in the plans.
Somebody found something strange on Ellesmere.
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.
The Americans are there too, lots of them.
Anything else? They're calling it an anomalous object.
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.
- Sit down.
- Let me go.
Hey. Leave her alone, man.
Or what, tough guy?
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I think I'll probably just leave when I'm good and ready.
Ooh.
Oh, there he is.
It's not worth it, sweetie.
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.
Strike.
Thanks.
Hi.
Miss Lane. How you doing?
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.
How far to the station?
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.
Joe can take your bags. Joe.
Help her out.
Careful with those. They're heavy.
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.
But those pieces you wrote when you were embedded with the 1st Division were...
Well, they were pretty impressive.
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.
Miss Lane.
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...
...from DARPA.
- You're early.
- Hi.
We were expecting you tomorrow.
Which is why I showed up today.
Look, let's get one thing straight, guys, okay?
The only reason I'm here is because we're on Canadian soil...
...and the appellate court overruled your injunction to keep me away.
So if we're done measuring dicks...
...can you have your people show me what you found?
NASA's EOS satellites...
...pinged the anomaly first.
The ice shelf plays hell on the echo soundings.
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?
Soviet-era?
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.
Considerably larger than anything we know they built back then.
But herds the spooky pan.
The ice surrounding the object...
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.
Miss Lane?
Try not to wander.
Temperatures drop to minus 40 at night around here.
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.
And there you go.
What if I need to tinkle?
There's a bucket in the corner.
Where the hell are you going?
Hello?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right.
You're hemorrhaging internally...
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...
How can...?
I can do things that other people can't.
Now hold my hand.
This is gonna hurt.
What Colonel Hardy and his team surmised...
...was a Soviet-era submarine...
...was actually something much more exotic.
An isotope analysis of the surrounding ice bores suggests that an object...
...had been trapped in the glacier for over 18,000 years.
As for my rescuer?
He disappeared during the object's departure...
A background check revealed that his work history...
...and identity had been falsified.
The questions raised by my rescuer's...
...existence are frightening to contemplate...
...but I also know what I saw.
"And I have arrived at the inescapable conclusion...
...that the object and its occupant...
...did not originate on Earth."
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.
What about the contractors who corroborated...
- ...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.
Of course they are. They're supposed to.
It's the Pentagon.
Perry, it's me we're talking about.
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.
You're under contract.
I'm not running a story about aliens walking among us.
Never gonna happen.
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.
I'm sending you the article.
My editor won't print it, but if it leaked online...
Got it.
But didn't you once describe my site...
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?
I stand by my words, Woodburn, but I want this story...
- ...out there.
- Why?
Because I want my mystery man to know I know the truth.
Recursive diagnostics complete...
Guiding presence authenticated.
All systems operational.
To see you standing there having grown into an adult...
If only Lara could have witnessed this.
Who are you?
I am your father, Kal.
Or at least a shadow of him.
His consciousness.
My name was Jor-El.
And Kal?
That's my name.
Kal-El. It is.
I have so many questions.
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?
You came from Krypton.
A world with a much harsher environment than Earths.
Long ago...
...in an era of expansion...
...our race spread out through the stars...
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.
This scout ship was one of thousands launched into the void.
We built outposts on other planets... musing great machines to reshape environments to our needs.
For 100,000 years, our civilization flourished...
...accomplishing wonders.
What happened?
Artificial population control was established.
The outposts on space exploration were abandoned.
We exhausted our natural resources.
As a result, our planet's core became unstable.
Eventually, our military leader...
...General Zod, attempted a coup.
But by then it was too late.
Your mother and I foresaw the coming calamity...
...and we took certain steps to ensure your survival.
This is a genesis chamber.
All Kryptonians were conceived in chambers such as this.
Every child was designed to fulfill a pre-determined role in our society...
...as a worker...
...a warrior, a leader and so on.
Your mother and I believed Krypton lost something precious.
The element of choice, of chance.
What if a child dreamed of becoming something... mother than what society had intended for him or her?
What if a child aspired to something greater?
You were the embodiment of that belief, Kal.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
That's why we risked so much to save you.
Why didn't you come with me?
We couldn't, Kal.
No matter how much...
...we wanted to.
No matter how much we loved you.
Your mother, Lara, and I...
...were a product of the failures of our world as much as Zod was...
...tied to its fate.
- So I'm alone.
- No.
You're as much a child of Earth now as you are of Krypton.
You can embody the best of both worlds.
A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve.
The people of Earth are different from us, it's true.
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.
They won't necessarily make the same mistakes we did.
Not if you guide them, Kal.
Not if you give them hope.
That's what this symbol means.
The symbol of the house of El means hope.
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief...
...in the potential of every person to be a force for good.
That's what you can bring them.
Why am I so different from them?
Earth's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton's was.
Your cells have drunken its radiation...
...strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses.
Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.
You've grown stronger here than I ever could have imagined.
The only way to know how strong...
...is to keep testing your limits.
Unh!
Uh... Oh.
Whoa!
You will give the people of Earth an ideal lo strive towards.
They'll race behind you.
They will stumble.
They will fall.
But In time...
...they will join you in the sun, Kal.
In time...
you will help them accomplish wonders.
How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks?
You start with the urban legends...
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.
The friends of a friend...
- ...who have seen him.
- He worked here.
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher...
...a ghost who never quite fit in.
Well, I was saying we were...
...coming towards the oil rig.
As you work your way back in time, the stories form a pattern.
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...
Pete Ross?
I'd like to talk to you about an accident when you were younger.
A school bus that went into the river.
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.
Mrs. Kent?
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.
Quiet.
I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk to you about your son.
I figured if I turned over enough stones you'd eventually find me.
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?
Let me tell your story.
What if I don't want my story told?
It's going to come out eventually.
Somebody's going to get a photograph or figure out where you live.
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...
...is to stop helping people altogether, and I sense that's not an option for you.
My father believed that if the world found out who I really was...
...they'd reject me...
...out of fear.
I'm tired of safe.
I just wanna do something useful with my life.
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?
I didn't say that.
Our family's been farming for five generations.
Your family, not mine.
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.
You're just some guy who found me in a field.
Clark.
It's all right, Martha.
He's right. Clark has a point.
We're not your parents.
But we've been doing the best we can.
And we've been making this up as we go along, so maybe...
Maybe our best isn't good enough anymore.
Look, Dad...
Hold on.
Go for the overpass.
Go for the overpass!
Take cover! Take cover!
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.
She's stuck.
Hank's still in the car.
Hank's in the car.
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.
Get your mom to the overpass.
Hank! Hank! Come!
Jonathan!
- Mom, ifs okay.
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.
Dad!
I let my father die because I trusted him.
Because he was convinced that I had to wait.
That the world was not ready.
What do you think?
You better watch out, Lois.
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.
He knows you're Woodburn's anonymous source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.
I told you not to run with this, and what do you do?
You let Woodburn just shotgun it all over the Internet.
Now the publishers want me to sue you.
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.
Whoa, just like that?
Yep.
What happened to your leads?
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?
Two weeks leave...
...no pay, that's your penance.
You try something like this again...
- ...you're done here.
- Fine.
Let's make it three weeks since you're so willing to agree.
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.
I believe you saw something, Lois.
But not for a moment do I believe that your leads just went cold.
So whatever your reasons are for dropping it...
...I think you're doing the right thing.
Why?
Can you imagine how people on this planet would react...
...if they knew there was someone like this out there?
Go get him.
Well, look at you.
A reporter came by here.
She's a friend. Don't worry.
Oh.
Mom.
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What?
- I found them.
- Who?
My parents.
My People.
I know where I come from now.
Wow.
That's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you, Clark.
- What?
- It's nothing.
When you were a baby I used to lay by your crib at night...
...listening to you breathe.
It was hard for you.
You struggled.
And I worried all the time.
You worried the truth would come out.
No.
The truth about you is beautiful.
We saw that the moment we laid eyes on you.
We knew that one day, the whole world would see that.
I'm just...
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.
I promise.
General Swanwick, sir.
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?
Comets don't make course corrections, general.
Wanted you to see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.
The ship appears to have...
...inserted itself into a lunar synchronous orbit...
...though I have no idea why.
Have you tried... communicating with it?
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.
I'm just speculating, but I think whoever's at the helm of that thing...
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.
Anybody know where we keep the toner?
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.
You gotta see this.
Clark.
Yeah?
Coming.
This is a breaking news. An unidentified...
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.
You are not alone.
It's on my phone too.
My name is General Zod.
I come from a world far from yours.
I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you.
For some time, your world has sheltered one of my citizens.
I request that you return this individual...
...to my custody.
For reasons unknown, he has chosen to keep his existence...
...a secret from you.
He will have made efforts to blend in.
He will look like you.
But he is not one of you.
To those of you who may know...
...of his current location...
...the fate of your planet...
...rests in your hands.
To Kai-El, I say this:
Surrender within 24 hours...
...or watch this world suffer the consequences...
Ah!
We hardly know anything about him, isn't that right?
If he truly means us no harm...
...he'll turn himself in and face the consequences.
And if he won't do that...
...then maybe we should.
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane knows who this guy is. She's...
...the one we should be questioning.
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...
- Hello?
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.
The entire world is being threatened here.
This is not time for you to fall...
...back on journalistic integrity.
This is serious, Lois.
The FBI is here. They're throwing around words like "treason."
I gotta go.
FBI. Hands up.
Drop the bag. Now.
Regarding the visitors themselves we know...
...very little.
According to government officials...
...the visitors do not represent a threat...
...despite the ominous tone of their message.
Then of course there's the question on everyone's mind:
"Who is this Kai-El person?
Does he actually exist?"
"How could he have remained hidden from us for so long?"
Come on, Kent.
Come on. Fight back.
Get up, Kent.
So is that it?
Is that all you've got?
Come on, Kent.
Come on!
Did they hurl you?
You know they can't.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.
I know you did. I mean...
...part of me even wanted you to, but then what?
Make you feel any better?
You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark.
Because whoever that man is, good character or bad, he's...
He's gonna change the world.
What's on your mind?
I don't know where to start.
Wherever you want.
That ship that appeared last night.
I'm the one they're looking for.
Do you know...
...why they want you?
No. But this General Zod...
...even if I surrender, there's no guarantee he'll keep his word, but...
...if there's a chance I can save Earth by turning myself in...
...shouldn't I take it?
What does your gut tell you?
Zod can't be trusted.
The problem is...
...I'm not sure the people of Earth can be either.
Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first.
The trust part comes later.
All right. You've got our attention.
What is it you want?
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
What makes you think she's here?
Don't play games with me, general.
I'll surrender, but only if you guarantee Lois's freedom.
Why are you surrendering to Zod?
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.
You let them handcuff you?
Wouldn't be much of a surrender if I resisted.
And if it makes them feel more secure...
...then all the better for it.
What's the S stand for?
It's not an S.
On my world it means hope.
Well, here, it's an S.
How about...
...Super...
Sir?
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
- Emil Hamilton.
I know, I can see your ID tag in your breast pocket.
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.
I can also see the soldiers in the next room...
...preparing that tranquilizing agent of yours.
You won't need it.
Sir, you can't expect us to not take precautions.
You could be carrying some kind of alien pathogen.
Been here for 33 years, doctor.
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...
...security concerns. You revealed your identity to Miss Lane over there.
Why won't you do the same with us?
Let's put our cards on the table here, general.
You're scared because you can't control me.
You don't, and you never will.
But that doesn't' mean I'm your enemy.
Then who is?
Zod?
That's what I'm worried about.
Be that as it may...
...I've been given orders to hand you over to him.
Do what you have to do, general.
Thank you.
For what?
For believing in me.
Didn't make much difference in the end.
It did to me.
They're coming.
You should leave now.
Go, Lois.
Kal-El.
I'm sub-commander Faora-UI.
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.
General Zod would like this woman...
...to accompany me.
You asked for the alien.
You didn't say anything about one of our own.
Shall I tell the general you're unwilling to comply?
I don't care what you tell him.
It's all right.
I'll go.
The atmospheric composition on our ship is not compatible with humans.
You need to wear a breather...
...beyond this point.
Kal-El.
You have no idea how long...
...we've been searching for you.
I take it you're Zod?
General Zod.
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.
He's a stranger to our ways.
This should be cause...
...for celebration, not conflict.
- Unh.
- Not conflict.
I...
...feel strange.
Weak.
What's happening to him?
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.
Clark.
You've spent a lifetime adapting to Earth's ecology...
...but never adapted to ours.
Help him.
I can't. Whatever's happening...
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.
Help him.
Help him.
Hello, Kal.
Or do you prefer Clark?
That's the name they gave you.
Isn't it?
I was Krypton's military leader...
...your father our foremost scientist.
The only thing we agreed on...
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...
...to protect our civilization...
...and save our planet...
...I and my fellow officers were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.
And then the destruction of our world...
...freed us.
We were adrift, destined to float...
...amongst the ruins of our planet...
...until we starved.
How did you find your way to Earth?
We managed to retrofit the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.
Your father made a similar modification to the craft that brought you here.
And so the instrument of our damnation...
...became our salvation.
We sought out the old colonial outposts...
...looking for signs of life.
But all we found was death.
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...
...withered and died long ago.
We salvaged what we could...
...armor, weapons...
...even a world engine.
For 33 years we prepared...
...until finally we detected a distress beacon...
...which you triggered...
...when you accessed the ancient scout ship.
You led us here, Kal.
Now it's within your power...
...to save what remains of your race.
On Krypton...
...the genetic template for every being yet to be born...
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.
Your father stole the registry's Codex...
...and stored it in the capsule that brought you here.
For what purpose?
So that Krypton can live again...
...on Earth.
Where is the Codex, Kal?
If Krypton lives again...
...what happens to Earth?
The foundation has to be built on something.
Even your father recognized that.
No, Zod.
I can't be a part of this.
Then what can you be a part of?
No!
Zod!
No!
No!
Your father acquitted...
...himself with honor, Kal.
You killed him?
I did.
And not a day goes by where it doesn't haunt me.
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people...
...and I will not allow anyone to prevent me from carrying it out.
What's the sit-rep, major?
DSP pinged two bogeys launching from the alien ship.
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.
There it is.
Re-task IKon-4...
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.
Command, the word...
...of the day is trident.
We have two alien craft on aggressive approach.
Ikon-4 coming online.
Air speed?
380 knots, entering Kansas...
...airspace.
Not responding to our hails.
You're wasting your efforts.
The strength you derived from the Earth's sun...
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.
Here...
...in this environment...
...you are as weak as a human.
Unh!
Unh!
Where did you come from?
The command key, Miss Lane.
Thanks to you, I'm uploading to the ship's mainframe.
Who are you?
I am Kai's father.
Can you help us?
I designed this ship.
I can modify its atmospheric composition...
...to human compatibility.
We can stop them.
We can send them back to the Phantom Zone.
How?
I can teach you.
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?
The ship's crew are alerted.
We need to move quickly.
Retrieve the command key.
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.
What's happening?
To your right.
Fire.
Behind you.
Secure yourself inside the open pod.
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely...
...we'll see each other again.
Remember, the phantom drives are essential in stopping them.
Move your head to the left.
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?
Strike that panel.
We wanted you to learn...
...what it meant to be human first...
...so that one day, when the time was right, you could be the bridge...
...between two peoples.
Look.
Lois.
You can save her, Kal.
You can save all of them.
You'll be safe here.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell them anything, but they did something to me.
- They looked inside my mind...
- It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.
Clark!
The craft he arrived in...
...where is it?
Go to hell.
There.
Unh!
The Codex is not here.
Argh!
Ah!
Where has he hidden it?
I don't know.
Where is the Codex?!
Ahh!
You think you can threaten my mother?!
Ah!
What have you done to me?
My parents taught me to hone...
...my senses, Zod.
Focus...
...on just what I wanted to see.
Without your helmet...
...you're getting everything.
Unh!
And it hurts...
...doesn't it?
Argh!
Get away from the window.
Get inside. It's not safe.
All players, this is
Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.
I have previously encountered and observed...
...the beings we're about to engage.
They are extremely dangerous and we have been authorized...
...to use deadly force.
Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.
Cleared hot. Weapons free.
Copy, 11. Weapons free.
Thunder 11...
...tally three targets.
Unh!
Thunder 11...
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.
Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...
...on a heading of 212 degrees.
Thunder 11, eject!
Eject!
Thunder 11, eject!
I have a bogey incoming!
Oh, shit.
Argh!
You are weak...
...son of El.
Unsure of yourself.
The fact that you possess a sense of morality...
...and we do not...
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.
And if history has proven anything...
...it is that evolution always wins.
Ragh!
Unh!
CCT, we're approaching...
...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.
Let's go. Go to the LZ.
Roger, sarge. let's go!
All rangers, I need you...
...to engage the targets.
Guardian, this is Badger 01.
What about the guy in blue?
I said engage...
...all targets.
Contact. Contact.
Ah!
You okay?
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.
Brace for impact.
Brace for impact.
We're going in hard!
Fallen angel. Fallen angel. Guardian is down.
I repeat, Guardian is down.
Guardian, do you read?
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...
...this is Guardian.
Put down everything you've got north of my position.
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.
Good luck, sir.
A good death is its own reward.
You will not win.
For every human you save...
...we will kill a million more. Unh!
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.
Do you copy? Alpha team.
This man is not our enemy.
Thank you, colonel.
Mom?
I'm all right.
Nice suit, son.
I'm so sorry.
It's only stuff, Clark.
It can always be replaced.
But you can't be.
Mom, Zod said this Codex...
...he's looking for can bring my people back.
Isn't that a good thing?
I don't think they're interested in sharing this world.
Clark.
Clark.
I know how to stop them.
What happened down there?
He exposed a temporary weakness.
It is of little consequence...
...because I have located the Codex.
It was never in the capsule.
Jor-el took the Codex...
...the DNA of a billion people, then he bonded it...
...within his son's individual...
...cells.
All of Krypton's heirs...
...living hidden in one refugee's body.
Does Kal-El need to be alive...
...for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?
No.
Release the world engine.
What just happened?
The ship just split in two.
Track one is heading east, track two to the southern hemisphere.
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...
...Mach 24 and accelerating.
It's gonna impact somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
The rest of the ship is descending.
Put it on the board now.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my God.
Bring the phantom drive online.
We are now slave to the world engine.
Initiate.
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...
...weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.
Somehow they're increasing the Earth's mass...
...clouding the atmosphere with particulates.
Oh, my God.
They're terraforming.
What's that?
Planetary engineering...
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere and topography.
Turning Earth into Krypton.
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...
...there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower.
Colonel Hardy's on his way and he's got Superman in tow.
Superman?
The alien, sir.
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.
We have a plan, general.
Is that what I think it is?
It's the ship he arrived in.
This ship is powered by something called a phantom drive.
It bends space.
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and if we can make the two drives collide...
A singularity can be created.
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.
So if we open up this doorway...
...they should be pulled back in.
So you want us to bomb them with that?
General, that craft maxes out...
...17,000 pounds, we can drop it from a C-17.
It's a viable plan.
If I don't stop that machine over the Indian Ocean...
...the gravity field will continue...
...to expand.
If that thing is making Earth more like Krypton...
...won't you be weaker around it?
Maybe.
I'm not about to let that stop me from trying.
You might want to step back a little bit.
Maybe a little bit more.
Faora.
Take command.
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...
...and pay my respects to an old friend.
Guardian en route to Metropolis...
...package in tow.
Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.
You should have visual contact now.
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.
Stop this, Zod...
...while there's still time.
Haven't given up lecturing me, have you, even in death?
I will not let you use the Codex like this.
You don't have the power to stop me.
The command key I have entered is revoking your authority.
This ship is now under my control.
Northcom, Lightning 1, request...
...permission to unleash the hounds.
Lightning 1...
...you are clear to engage. Send battle damage assessment when able. Out.
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...
...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.
All right, everybody...
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.
I just lost my wingman.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Everybody, this way! Come on!
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.
Jenny!
Oh, my God.
Perry!
Go! There! Go!
Our people can co-exist.
So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt like your son has?
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.
We're both ghosts, Zod.
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.
Ship, have you managed to quarantine this invasive intelligence?
- You'll fail.
- I have.
Then prepare to terminate it.
- I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me...
...won't change anything.
My son...
...is twice the man you were.
And he will finish what we started.
I can promise you that.
Tell me...
...you have Jor-El's memories, his conscience.
Can you experience...
...his pain?
I will harvest the Codex from your son's corpse...
...and I will rebuild Krypton...
...atop his bones.
Argh!
Jenny.
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm stuck.
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.
No, no, no!
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.
- Okay.
- Lombard!
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?
Go.
- Push!
- Oh, my God.
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?
Negative, Guardian.
Come on! Push!
Ahh!
Argh!
He did it.
Northcom, this is Guardian.
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.
Godspeed, Guardian.
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.
We're lining up for the final run.
It's up to you and Hamilton now.
You gotta be kidding me.
Loadmaster, is the package...
...ready to drop?
Negative, Guardian.
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.
What's it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?
We've had a setback.
Target that aircraft.
Target locked.
Stop!
If you destroy this ship...
...you destroy Krypton!
Krypton had its chance.
Argh!
Miss Lane! It's not safe for you...
...over there!
Miss Lane!
Ah!
Move now! Go!
A good death...
...is its own reward.
Ah!
Ah!
Argh!
Are they gone?
I think so.
He saved us.
You know, they say it's all downhill after the first kiss.
I'm pretty sure that only counts when you're kissing a human.
Look at this.
We could have built a new Krypton...
...in this squalor.
But you chose the humans over us.
I exist...
...only to protect Krypton.
That is the sole purpose for which I was born.
And every action I take...
...no matter how violent...
...or how cruel...
...is for the greater good...
...of my people.
And now...
...I have no people.
My soul...
...that is what you have taken...
...from me.
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...
- ...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...
...and I'm gonna stop you.
Argh!
Argh!
There's only...
...one way this ends, Kal.
Either you die...
...or I do.
Unh!
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.
Trained my entire life...
...to master my senses.
Where did you train? On a farm?
Argh!
If you love...
...these people so much...
...you can mourn for them.
Don't do this!
Stop!
Stop!
Never.
Ahh!
Are you effing stupid?
It's one of your surveillance drones.
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.
It was.
I know you're trying to find out where I hang my cape.
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...
...the obvious question:
How do we know you won't one day act against America's interests?
I grew up in Kansas, general.
I'm about as American as it gets.
Look...
...I'm here to help...
...but it has to be on my own terms.
You have to convince Washington of that.
Even if I were willing to try, what makes you think they'd listen?
I don't know, general.
Guess I'll just have to trust you.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing, sir.
I just think he's kind of hot.
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.
He always believed you were meant for greater things.
And that when the day came...
...your shoulders would be able to bear the weight.
Yeah, I just wish he could have been here to see it finally happen.
He saw it, Clark, believe me.
What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.
I gotta find a job where I can keep my ear to the ground.
Where people won't look twice...
...when I want to go somewhere dangerous and start asking questions...
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?
Courtside seats to the game tonight.
- What do you say?
- I say...
...you should go back to trolling the intern pool.
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.
Courtside?
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.
Good luck, kid.
Hey. Steve.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
Hi.
Lois Lane.
Welcome to the Planet.
Glad to be here, Lois.
You all right?
Let's get in.
We were flying.
Yeah!
I don't want to do that again.
No.
Hey.
Hey, you stay with me.
Keep talking.
You remember now, don't you?
What?
The woman.
Did you love her?
You can tell me.
I can't remember.
I must've.
All I know is I owe it to her to find her.
Watch out. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I got you.
I got you.
It's not far now.
You and me, we're gonna be just fine.
Is that…
Is that them?
Boss?
–I got her.
–Give her to me, Nat. Bring her here.
–Here. Drink.
–No. Give it to her. Give it to her.
Doc?
How is she?
She's gone, pal.
No. No, she's not gone.
She's not. She's not gone!
Jake.
She's gone.
–Doc!
–Don't touch him!
Doc!
This is Black Knife.
The last of his people.
There's no reasoning with them.
We're all gonna die anyway.
This is what's left of the Chiricahuas.
Good riddance to 'em!
He's saying the white people, they brought all this evil to his people.
We brought evil? Evil was here!
You're the evil one!
He's saying we brought the monsters.
We didn't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people, too!
Tell him they took my wife!
Shut up!
There's no reasoning with them!
Tell him what I said, Nat!
Kill us now!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't tell you.
Are you one of them?
No. I'm from a different place.
I took this form so I could walk among you.
You should have told me.
I didn't know if I could heal this body, if I would wake up.
He wants to know where you're from.
What'd she say?
She says she came from a place above the stars.
What does that mean? Another world?
What do you mean?
What does that mean? What?
He says you shouldn't talk.
What do you mean I shouldn't talk?
I got questions…
You're a guest of the chief.
Now I'm a guest? I thought
I was a prisoner! What the hell am I?
Enough! All right. You're both big men!
Great warriors!
Can we just listen to the woman tell her story?
Or whatever she is?
What are they doing here?
They want gold.
Well, that's just ridiculous.
What are they gonna do, buy something?
It's as rare to them as it is to you.
What about my grandpa?
What about my wife? What about the other people? Are they still alive?
If they are, they won't be for long.
They're studying your weaknesses.
These are just scouts.
If we let them leave, they'll come back with more and there will be no survivors.
That's what they did to my people.
I came here to make sure it would not happen again, but we have to work together.
He says his people will join her.
What do you mean, join her?
What's she going to do?
Where you going to go?
We can find them.
He knows where they are.
No, I don't.
I can't remember anything.
I couldn't even remember my own name.
He says they will take care of that.
I brought the gold.
Into the house.
That's why she died.
It's not your fault.
I know where they are.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
How did they build something like that?
They arrived in it. It's their vessel.
That's only the top.
The rest is underground.
It's how they mine for gold.
So there is gold here.
Can they see out of there?
They don't see well in daylight.
They stay underground in caverns where it's dark.
We'll never even get close.
Those flying machines will just pick us off before we get anywhere near it.
There is another way in.
Down there.
The way I came out.
We got to get those creatures out of there and out in the open, where we can get at them.
So you can get in with that arm gun, get our people out.
We have one advantage, they underestimate you.
You're like insects to them.
They're not planning on defending themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.
–We haven't got enough men.
–This ain't gonna work.
He says he wants to use your spyglass.
The Apaches are mountain warriors.
He says it's better to fight from high ground.
Tell him he's a fool.
There is no high ground while they got those flying machines.
Jake's leaving!
That's just dandy.
Son of a bitch.
Quit stalling.
How much gold we had left?
Barely enough.
But I'm gonna need my share right now so I can get as far away from here as I possibly can.
–Red?
–I got him, Bull.
Hey, there.
I had one hell of a job finding you boys.
You planning a trip?
We're going as far away as we can go.
You remember la playa in Puerto Vallarta?
They got good fishing.
Good tequila.
You want to come with us?
Don't make no difference.
It's not far enough.
What in the hell were those things, Jake?
It doesn't matter.
They're gonna find us and they're gonna wipe us out.
What in the hell are you saying?
What I'm saying is you got a choice.
You can drink your last few hours away on a beach, which by the way, is not a bad idea or you can follow me one last time.
We got to make the best use of our resources.
We got to have a strict…
Listen to me, damn it!
He doesn't understand tactics.
You got to explain to him.
Look, we can't just run around hollering and throwing spears and shooting arrows at the damn thing.
We got to draw them out of there onto open ground where we can surround them, attack them on all sides.
Flank them. Explain to him.
He said he's not going to let you lead his people.
What's he saying?
He's saying they need to open their hearts and see in you what he has seen.
That his parents died in the Mexican War and you took him in when he was only a boy.
That you gave him purpose.
Taught him how to take care of himself even though you were not blood.
That you despise battle but would never run from it.
That you're a fierce warrior worthy of any fight.
He says if you're such a great warrior, why do you only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle?
Dog! Dog!
Boy!
How are you?
Hot damn.
Ready to get your son back?
Give me that. Okay.
Matches.
I don't have any more matches.
We're gonna have to go down.
I don't know what we're going to do.
Go. Go!
Go. Go!
I think we destroyed it.
Demons are coming out.
Take this. Go up where I showed you.
–You see our people, wave your arms.
–Yes, sir.
Move out!
Good job.
If our people are in there,
I'll get them out.
Godspeed.
Let's get them!
This is how they get the gold out.
They're not going down!
They will!
Keep at it till we get our people out!
Doc!
Doc, get down here!
Jesus.
Doc!
Did we get one?
Yeah, we got one.
I always dreamed of riding into battle with you.
I always dreamed of having a son like you.
Go.
Get Percy.
Get your son.
Don't look into the light.
–I told you not to look into the light.
–Yeah, right.
How long are they gonna be like this?
Each one's different.
Hold them off.
You'd better hurry.
There's more of them coming!
Go!
Everybody's out.
Right.
Hey! Where are you going?
It's this way!
Go. Go!
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here!
No!
I came here to destroy that thing.
How?
With the bracelet. Take it off.
Wait, I can't take it off.
Yes, you can. You can control it.
–How?
–Same way you shoot it. With your mind.
You have to stop thinking.
This isn't working.
It fell off.
If I can get it to its core,
I can stop them.
Let's go.
Take this.
Throw it!
–Good-bye, Jake.
–What?
Wait! Ella!
No!
I see them! I see them!
They got out.
They're coming out the other side!
You see Percy?
Yeah, I see him!
What about Jake and Ella?
No. They're not there.
You all right, old man?
–Where's the girl?
–She's still inside.
Go!
Grandpa!
It's me.
Emmett.
Emmett.
You're all grown up.
Percy.
Don't you remember me, boy?
I'm sorry. I don't remember much.
I'm your father.
Pa.
Do you remember me?
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.
All this gold's gonna make things different.
We're gonna have a railroad in here soon.
That'll change the cattle business.
Run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?
Tell them I need some new checks.
Okay.
I want the new ones to read
“Dolarhyde and Son.”
–That sound good to you?
–Yes. Yes, sir.
–John.
–Woodrow.
It appears our town is about to get a whole lot bigger.
You weren't gonna leave without saying good-bye, were you?
I'm a wanted man.
I could have sworn I saw
Jake Lonergan die in those caves, didn't you, Sheriff?
Damn shame.
I was looking forward to hanging him myself.
I could use a good man around here.
Yes, you could.
Jake.
She's in a better place.
I'll see you around, Colonel.

They were about to call 911, for Christ's sakes,

I have some new information about the incident,
but I'm afraid it raises more questions than it answers.
Oh, w... what kind of questions?
The birds were negative for avian flu.
But what we did determine is that the impact trajectories
indicate the birds were part of three different flocks
and not one, as we originally assumed.
I don't understand.
So what does that mean?
What it means is that three different migrations
coming from three different directions flew into your house, Mrs. Barrett.

I'm ready to tell you my news.
I lost six hours today.
I mean, the last thing I remember,
I was in the middle of this walk-through.
The clients told Pete that they thought
I was having some kind of breakdown.
And I woke up in bed, and I had this.
Jesus, Lace.
Daniel, I've got to show you something.
So I started with the birds.
And the best they can understand it is that something is interfering with the Earth's geomagnetic field, and... and that's causing the birds to veer off course.
Some people say that it has something to do with the government, that they're testing some kind of super-secret weapons technology.
And other people...
...think it's something else, something...
...not from here.
What does that mean, "not from here"?
Not from... this planet.
- Lacy.
- I know this is so hard to believe.
- Just trust me. I've been research...
- No, it's more than hard to believe.
I mean... aliens?
That's...
That's insane. Right?
You know this is the reason we don't self-diagnose on the Internet.
Stop. Hear me out on this.
There are people who have reported experiencing the same things that we have been experiencing, in these communities where these other bird deaths have taken place.
This picture was drawn by a five-year-old in Chesapeake Bay in 2007, shortly before he vanished.
Vanished, Daniel.
His family claims he was taken by aliens and that they had been entering their home for weeks.
Sam drew this yesterday.
Yeah, well, maybe Sammy saw this drawing online and copied it.
And maybe he made
800 birds hit our house?
I found a guy in the city who claims to be an expert on this stuff.
- I think we gotta go talk to him. Yes.
- No. No, no, no, no.
Well, what other explanation do you have?
Just because I can't explain something, doesn't mean aliens are responsible.
Why can't you understand that some things defy normal explanations?
We're not those people who believe in crazy things!
Maybe those people aren't the crazy ones!
- Who are you? Who...
- Don't do this.
- Where is my wife?

OK.
Have either of you seen any bright lights in the sky above your neighborhood that moved in an unusual way?
<font color="#D900D9">(CLEARS THROAT)</font> No.
Have you experienced any severe headaches or migraines?
Nope.
Either of you heard a ringing in your ears that seems to be happening only inside your head?
<font color="#D900D9">(SOFTLY)</font> Yes
Have you experienced any unexplained illnesses, strange allergies or nosebleeds?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Have you witnessed any abnormal behavior by animals in your neighborhood?
Three different flocks of birds flew into our house the other day.
I would say that qualifies.
Have either of you experienced any blackouts, stretches of time that you can't account for?
And have you experienced a feeling that you might not be in control of your own body?
How do you know all this?
You are not alone in this.
Others have experienced what you're going through and have struggled the way you're struggling now.
Why are the Grays, or whatever they are, so interested in us?
What makes us so special?
Nothing.
There's nothing special about you.
I'm sorry.
You were hoping for a different answer.
But this is beyond our comprehension.
What answer would a lab rat understand from a scientist in a white coat putting electrodes in its brain, giving it cancer?
I've interviewed literally thousands of people who claim to have been visited by the Grays.
They come from all walks of life.
The only thing they have in common is that their lives have become a living hell because of it.
People think of aliens as these beings invading our planet in some great cataclysm, destroying monuments, stealing our natural resources.
But it's not like that at all.
The invasion... already happened.
No one knows exactly when, but...
...they're here.
They've been here.
The presence of the Grays is now a fact of life.
Like death and taxes.
Do you know what they want?
They seem to be...
...studying us, experimenting on us.
One thing we know for sure is, they use our fears against us.
It can start like a... a childish prank...
...a mess in the kitchen or things missing in the house.
And before you know it, you're walking through a full-blown nightmare.
You probably already have implants.
Implants?

Skin's pretty irritated, that happens sometimes.
It's a... it's a rash or a bite.

...hide what they do.

Most people don't even know they have them.
Well, can we remove it?
No.
No. Believe me, I've tried.
Oh, my God.
Every time I think I'm getting it, it seems to burrow in deeper.
<font color="#D900D9">(PANTING)</font>
We'll move. Pack everything in the car and just drive away.
These beings almost certainly came millions of light-years to get here.
Do you really think moving to the next town or checking into a motel will stop them from finding you?
The events you've been experiencing, the disturbances in your home, the blackouts, the marks on your bodies...
...they are not the beginning of something, Daniel.
They are the end of something.
It's like a countdown.
The Grays will watch a family for a long time before they reveal themselves.
But once they do, it means they're getting ready to take someone.
What are you talking about?
This is important.
Which member of your family did the Grays first make contact with?
<font color="#808080">DANIEL:</font>
My youngest son, Sam.
<font color="#808080">POLLARD:</font>
Then Sam is in the most danger.
The Grays almost always abduct the first family member they showed an interest in.
So that's it?
- We just wait until they take our son?
- No.
You fight them with everything you've got.
Your only hope is to make it so difficult for them, that they simply move on to someone else.
Wait-wait-wait-wait, I'm sor...
That can work?
It has before, in some cases.
Yes. I've even heard of cases where someone who's been taken has eventually returned, but you can't count on it.
Everything the Grays do is intended to divide us from one another, to isolate the one they've chosen.

<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>
- That's right.
Ice cream.
What about you, Jess? You remember your first big Fourth of July?
We were at the old house.
And you and Mom woke me up.
And you put me on your shoulders, and you carried me to the top of White's Hill.
And do you remember what you said when we got there?
<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</font>
- I said I wanted to go home.

Yeah.
I carried you all the way up there to see your first big fireworks, and you couldn't care less.

My name is Alice.
I worked for Umbrella Corporation in a secret laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry.
There was an incident.
A virus escaped.
Everybody died.
Trouble was...
...they didn't stay dead.
This was the start of an apocalypse that would sweep the entire world.
The men responsible for this disaster took refuge underground and continued to experiment with the deadly T-Virus.
They felt secure in their high-tech fortress.
But they were wrong.
Biohazard terminated.
Central Shibuya.
Confirm?
I confirm.
Nice shooting.
And I lead three to one.
The night is young.
Plenty more fish in the--
Toshi, are you okay?
Toshi, where are you?
Sentry three respond.
We lost contact with another one.
- Chairman Wesker.
- Report.
Sir, a half-hour ago, we began to lose contact with some of our perimeter sentries.
How many have we lost?
All of them.
And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?
We thought it was a communications problem. I didn't want to disturb you.
Give me the surface gate.
This is Chairman Wesker.
: Sir.
Report your situation.
Everything is quiet here.
No sign of intruders?
Hotaka.
- We have movement.
Multiple targets.
Surface gate, identify targets.
Repeat, identify targets.
Sir, Elevator 2 is moving.
I want security at that entrance.
Hey, boys.
Is that any way to treat a Lady?
Tell security to flood the main entrance with nerve gas.
Sir, our men are still up there.
Any more questions?
Intruders in Sectors 1 through 5,
7 and 8.
Reports of gunfire in Sectors 10 and 11.
Stay at your stations.
All security protocols are now in full effect.
Lock down all elevators.
Seal all internal blast doors.
And I want damage reports.
Come on, move.
- Go, go. Everybody--
- Get out.
Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.
Turbulence. Turbulence.
Turbulence. Turb--
Any last words?
How nice to finally meet the real you.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Well, that's just the start of the bad news.
All those powers of yours:
Speed, strength, accelerated healing.
Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.
What have you done?
The serum I have injected you with is neutralizing the T cells within your body.
Put simply... the Umbrella Corporation is taking back its property.
You just didn't work out, so you're being recalled.
I am what you used to be.
Only better.
Please wait.
Last words?
Thank you.
For killing you?
For making me human again.

This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
While I took revenge on Umbrella, the last handful of survivors took a chopper to safety.
They were headed for a town in Alaska called Arcadia.
We'd received radio transmissions from there.
They offered food and shelter, safety and security.
A haven, free of infection.
May 3rd, 1600 hours.
A hundred and seventy-seven days without signs of life.
I am at 58.37 degrees north,
134.58 degrees west.
Closing in on the coordinates for
Arcadia, but no signs of it on any map.
I hope Claire and the others made it.
You're not coming?
Take care of the others.
Good luck, K-Mart.
Claire.
May 3rd.
1930 hours.
Arcadia.
No such place exists.
Just an empty field.
And a beach.
But we all heard the transmissions.
Someone must have sent them.
Someone must have brought all these people here.
But why?
And where did they go?
Day 177. Signing off.
I don't know if I can do this much longer.
What if I am the last one?
What if there is no one else?
No one to watch these tapes.
Is this my punishment for letting all this happen?
Hey. Wait.
Wait, please. Stop.
Hello.
Hello?
Answer me.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
Sorry about that.
But I had to get this thing off of you.
What is this?
Who did this to you?
Do you even know who I am?
My name is Alice.
We met in the Nevada desert 18 months ago.
Any of this sound familiar?
Mikey, Carlos, L.J.?
K-Mart?
You left in a helicopter with a group of survivors headed for Alaska.
Arcadia, remember?
Arcadia, remember?
Arcadia, remember?
May 4th, 0800 hours.
Potting a course for Prince Rupert in British Columbia.
I will pass Vancouver, drop down to Seattle.
After that, it's San Francisco and the rest of the Western seaboard.
My passenger is still as talkative as ever.
Whatever that thing was, it was injecting her with some sort of drug.
Something that causes memory loss.
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.
Your name... is Alice, right?
She speaks.
Look, I am sorry about back there.
I don't know what happened.
I don't remember anything.
I don't even know my name.
It's Claire.
Claire Redfield.
Claire?
Sound familiar?
Not really.
You will get used to it.
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.
We should get to know each other a little better first.
City of Angels.
May 6th, 1800 hours, Los Angeles.
No signs of life.
Not even the undead.
Some must have burnt with the city.
But what about the rest?
Oh, my God.
What?
Look over there.
Damn.
It's a plane.
It's a plane.
I knew it.
I told you they would come.
Hey, we're down here. Hello.
No way we're getting in there.
Where is he going?
Why is he flying away?
It's not flying away.
It's circling. Circling?
Damn, he's low.
Down.
What the hell is he doing?
He's going to land.
He's going to land.
Get the stuff out of the way.
Land?
Yeah.
Land.
That is one crazy son of a bitch.
This may get a little rough.
Then cut me loose.
Thanks.
Just don't do anything crazy, all right?
Nothing as crazy as what you have in mind.
Come on, Kim, move it.
I am trying.
Well, try.
All right, hold on.
Hurry, he's coming.
Come on.
Come on, pull it. Come on.
Come on, pull.
Good. Good.
Good work.
That's it.
Good job.
Nice landing.
I think technically it's called crashing.
Luther West.
Alice. That's Claire.
Luther West. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Hi, my name's Crystal.
- No, no.
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help us, right?
Can you get us out?
You from Arcadia?
What did you say?
Are you from Arcadia?
What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said they'd help.
There are survivors.
Civilization and safety.
Infection free.
So they sent you, right?
No.
But there are others out there like you?
It's just us.
There's to be no rescue?
I am sorry.
Sorry.
Look, don't take it so bad.
They had their hopes up and...
Thought you could take them to the promised land.
Angel Ortiz.
That was some fine flying.
Thanks.
What's the prognosis?
She will live.
Yeah.
You know,
I have the strangest feeling
I know you.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You're a sports fan, huh?
Do you like basketball?
Not really.
No? Oh.
Well, maybe just a fan of fine timepieces.
Yeah.
Luther here is our resident superstar.
So tell me about Arcadia.
What exactly do you know?
Just from their transmissions.
We have been receiving their broadcast all week.
Food and shelter, safety and security, no infection.
We thought they sent you.
We have been launching flares for days to get their attention.
Flares?
- Yeah.
Who's going to see flares from Alaska?
Alaska?
Alaska?
Arcadia. I have been there.
It's in Alaska.
It's a town, or so we thought.
A town?
I don't think so.
Take a look.
At what?
You see?
It's not a town.
It's a ship.
I recorded this from the shortwave.
This is
Arcadia, on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
It's the same message we heard.
They must have salled down the coast, picking up survivors.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
What is that?
I don't know.
That was the last we heard from them.
Then it just stopped.
That was two days ago.
We have been sending up flares on the hour.
So when you arrived, of course, we thought they sent you.
Claire.
That ship over there.
That's Arcadia.
I know.
You remember?
I remember the beach.
People were coming to help us.
What happened?
Why didn't you go with the others?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
We have to get to that ship.
We have to get to that ship.
Welcome to your new home, cell block B.
Crystal's our cook.
The menu's not extensive, but she is a master of what she does.
Sorry I didn't bring better news.
Get used to disappointment, right?
That's what my agent used to say.
Were you an actress?
I came to Hollywood, ended up waiting tables.
Why are we waiting? Excuse me. I am hungry. Thank you.
Get out of here, man.
- Thank you.
I met plenty of creeps like him in my time.
What's his story?
Back in the world, he was some kind of big movie producer.
The boy's got a stick up his ass.
Kim Yong used to intern for him. Still hasn't figured the world has changed.
That plane, do you think it could still fly?
It can fly, but it only seats two.
So take us to Arcadia one at a time.
Look, I think she was lucky to land here once.
Five or six times would be suicide.
No offence.
None taken.
There has to be another way out.
We have to get to that ship.
Well, there is the--
What?
Nothing.
Look, it would be a waste of your time.
I have time to waste.
When the shit hit the fan, we took refuge in the prison.
It seemed like it had the biggest, strongest walls.
The best chance of keeping those things out.
By the time we got here, the guards and the inmates were already long gone.
I guess when people started eating one another, there wasn't much point in keeping anybody locked up.
We thought the place was abandoned, until we made a discovery.
Wendell, time to take a break.
It's about god-damn time.
I hate being down here.
I am hearing movement in the walls.
So let's check it out.
I will be back in a minute.
Come on.
Name's Chris.
You were the one flying that plane.
How do you know that?
Wendell isn't the only one that hears things.
I am glad you made it.
Maybe you can talk some sense into these people.
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
I am not a prisoner.
I shouldn't be in here.
I was working with a military unit.
We were using this place as a staging post.
Things were already bad when the order came through to release all the inmates.
We needed as many people on the streets as possible to fight those things.
And it was chaos.
We were pulling out and a gang of the prisoners jumped me.
I guess they thought I was a guard.
I woke up, my unit was gone.
I was in here.
Their idea of a joke.
You don't believe me.
Do the others?
You need to get me out of here.
We're all trapped here.
That's true.
But I can help you.
Seen enough?
You find anything?
No.
I know a way out of this place.
If you get me out of here,
I will do the same for you.
You're going to need me.
Have you checked what he's talking about?
His way out?
He's not telling us shit till we let him out. And I am not letting him out.
The man is a killer.
Really?
I can see it in his eyes.
How can you be so sure?
I know people.
Interesting.
So tell me.
What do you see when you look into my eyes?
Whoa.
Holy shit.
Girl's got to be prepared.
What would you possibly want with those?
It's a hobby.
A hobby?
All right.
Well, I will see you in the morning.
No sign of anyone on deck.
Your friends are out there?
I think so.
You don't remember?
It's coming back.
Slowly.
Nothing that makes any sense.
We still have running water.
That's very civilized.
We do our best.
It's cold.
Our best only goes so far.
These are for you.
Thank you.
I guess I should leave you to it.
I guess you should.
I will be right outside.
Thank you.
Luther?
Take it easy, honey. Move it.
Okay, I am just going to be on my way now.
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.
Get out of my sight.
What is that smell?
Must have burrowed up from the sewers.
Wendell said he heard things moving.
What? So these things can just burst out anywhere?
We got to get out of this place.
Arcadia will send help.
No one's coming to get us.
Okay? No one.
We have to help ourselves.
This plane that you have.
Won't hold everybody.
Well, we can draw straws.
- No.
We all get out of here and no one gets left behind.
Great.
How are we going to do that?
Walk out of here, just single file?
Are you crazy?
They didn't want him getting out.
- He's dangerous.
Angel, what do you think?
I think we don't have much of a choice.
This is insane.
Crystal, Crystal, look at me. What do you think?
I mean, not even you're that dumb.
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.
If this guy thinks he knows a way out, I want to hear it.
All right.
Seriously?
This is a mistake.
This is a big mistake.
You better keep your eyes on him.
I was wondering how long it would take.
Boo.
I-- all right, let's get the hell out of here.
Claire?
What?
Claire, it's me.
It's Chris.
I don't know you.
Claire.
I am your brother, remember?
What the hell's happened to you?
It's okay.
Let him go.
Look, she suffered some sort of memory loss.
If you really are her brother, it will come back.
All right, this is very touching.
I mean the family reunion.
If we could just get a move on, please, before we're all eaten the fuck alive.
Behind those doors is a
UPV, urban pacification vehicle.
The prison kept it in case of a serious riot.
Sixteen-wheeler, steel plate, water cannon. It seats 20.
Ten tons of fun.
We roll on out in style, drive right over them.
The lock's jammed.
But we can cut through it.
When we hit the coast, we have to transfer to a boat.
We're going to need more fire-power.
- I got you covered.
When I was stationed here, we used the basement as an armoury.
It's got every weapon you can dream of.
How do you know your unit didn't take them with them?
Because by the end there were more guns than there were people to use them.
You go get the guns. Luther.
Oh, my God.
What is this?
They had pumps to keep the water out of the foundations.
When the electricity failed, some of the lower levels started filling up.
There's another two floors down there.
And how far down is the armoury?
All the way.
Luther, come on.
Get back. Get back.
Where do you think you're going?
I was a swim champ back in high school.
Is that right?
Here.
You're going to trust me with a gun?
Yeah. Why not?
Luther, just shoot that mother-fucker.
What the fuck is that thing?
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Nice.
Damn.
There must be hundreds of them out there.
We can't go back that way.
Oh, shit.
What do you mean, "oh, shit"?
What--?
What is this?
What do you think it is?
Don't tell me that thing fits inside of there.
Can you put this back together?
Maybe, but it could take a week.
What do we do now?
I know.
Bennett, what have you done?
Luther, we got to get out of here. Come on.
Did you hear that?
Come on, baby. Come on.
What are we doing?
Getting out.
But the others.
Fuck the others.
Now, get on-board.
Bennett, what are you doing?
Hey.
Kim Yong. Don't do this.
Open this door.
Bennett, please.
Bennett.
Oh, shit.
That's right, bitch. Fuck you.
Yes. Yes.
Son of a bitch.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
He's headed for the Arcadia.
Alice.
Come on.
Head for the shower block.
Move.
I will meet you there.
This thing has no power.
We won't need power.
Oh, shit.
Hold on.
Hey, head to the shower block. Go.
Over here.
Are you all right?
I am fine. Thanks.
This is some kind of joke, right?
The tunnels lead to the sewers, the sewers lead to the storm drain.
This storm drain leads to the sea.
It's our only chance.
I will take point.
I got your back.
Ladies.
All right, you're next.
I can't do it.
You can.
Let's go.
Aah.
Shh.
Those things are close.
We found a way out just down there.
The tunnels drop into a storm drain.
Go. Be careful.
Where's Kim Yong?
Go. Go.
I knew you'd make it.
Luther.
Help.
Luther.
You can't help him now.
We have to move on.
No welcome party, huh?
It looks like Bennett made it.
Let's check inside.
Did you find anyone?
Nothing.
I checked the crew quarters. They're all gone.
Looks like they left in a hurry.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection. We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
Fuel, power, everything's running normally.
Look at this.
It's the ship's log.
The crew launched the lifeboats three days ago.
Exactly when the transmissions stopped.
But it says there are still 2000 survivors on-board.
We have to search every inch of this ship.
Umbrella.
Of course.
I remember them coming for us.
This whole thing, Arcadia, was a lie.
No, it's worse than that.
It's a trap.
Where is everybody?
I don't understand.
I think I do.
They're underneath our feet.
They're holding survivors to experiment on them.
Look.
It's K-Mart. She's here.
Bring them up.
All of them.
Here she is.
K-Mart.
Get her out.
K-Mart, it's okay.
It's okay.
K-Mart, it's all right.
I will get this off her.
Let everyone out.
We're your friends.
Right now, we need your help.
Let me get this off you.
Why am I not surprised?
You weren't too hard to find.
Our satellite system is still operational.
And there aren't too many people flying nowadays.
And besides, I always knew you'd be drawn to your friends.
Loyalty, highly overrated.
Stop.
Down.
Wouldn't want you harming my pets.
Drop your guns.
Thank you.
Kick them to me.
Good.
You don't look so good, Bennett.
Yeah, I am looking forward to playing with your pretty face.
What do you want from me?
The T-Virus brought me back.
But it's so strong.
It fights me for control.
I thought if I ingested fresh human DNA,
I could redress the balance.
No wonder your crew abandoned ship.
No matter.
Now I have a new subordinate.
And a new plan.
You were the only one who successfully bonded with the T-Virus.
Your DNA is stronger than the others.
I ingest you,
I gain control.
That's pretty smart thinking.
There's only one problem with that plan.
Stop right there.
And what is that?
I am not on the menu.
Well, isn't this one big family reunion?
Chris and Claire Redfield.
You have really become quite an inconvenience for me.
I told you
I'd be bringing a few friends.
You should have brought more.
Claire. Claire.
Chris.
Don't even think about it.
Who the fuck are you?
I don't think so.
Don't-- Don't you shut them.
I am a producer.
Open those doors.
You are going to deal with some serious consequences.
You mother-fuckers.
Open the--
You're going to live to regret this, all of you.
Oh, God.
I just want to go home.
Hey, it's going to be okay.
No.
Chris. Alice.
Come on.
I didn't want you to miss that.
Oh, heh, heh.
That's right.
Star power, bitches.
It's a miracle.
I never dreamed there would be this many of us left alive.
So, what's next?
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency--
I say... we live up to the promise.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
Location 118.30 degrees west,
34.05 degrees north.
There is no infection.
Repeat, there is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
If you are out there, we will help you.
There is hope.
What is that?
Trouble.
Deployment in T-minus 57 seconds.
When you hit the deck, you watch your formation.
Take no prisoners and shoot to kill.
Total enemy numbers are unknown but will include Umbrella fugitives and prime targets.
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield and Project Alice.
So, people, whatever's waiting for you out there, just know one thing:
You are going to be in for the fight of your lives.
Hey, boys.
Is that any way to treat a lady?
Here's my day, so far.
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked.
Pretty good.
Still, things could be a lot worse.
Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death.
Guess they can't.
How did it all come to this, you ask?
My end starts at the beginning.
The very beginning.
Yes, that's me.
I had a fairly standard childhood.
I came from what you might call, a broken home.
Literally, broken.
I was eight days old and still living
How sad is that?
Clearly it was time to move on.
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.
And here is your binkie.
You are destined for ...
I didn't quite hear that last part.
But it sounded important.
Destined for, what?
I set out to find my destiny.
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.
And our glorious rivalry, was born!
Could this be what I was destined for?
A dream life filled with luxury?
Apparently not.
Even fate makes its favorite soup.
No big deal.
A much different fate awaited me.
A baby.
How thoughtful.
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.
Can we keep him?
A place that taught me the differences between right...
...and wrong.
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter.
Our baby can fly.
- Yes, yes
- And that was not the best
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.
But I had something far, far greater,
My amazing intellect.
A knack for building objects of mayhem.
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior.
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning.
At a strange place called shh-ool.
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.
He bought their affections with showmanship,
So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs.
Lights out!
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.
Good receives all the praise, adulation.
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider.
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects.
And rehydrate them at will.
Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion,
No matter how hard I tried.
I was always the odd man out.
The last one picked.
The screw-up... black sheep.
Bad boy.
Oh!
Was this my destiny?
Wait! Maybe it was.
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.
Then it hit me.
If I was the bad boy.
Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.
I was destined to be a super villain.
And we were destined to be rivals.
The die had been cast.
And so began an enduring epic, life long career.
And I loved it.
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
He would win some, I would almost win others.
He took the name, Metro Man.
Defender of Montrosity.
I decided to pick up something a little more humble.
Megamind.
Incredibly handsome criminal genius, and master of all villainy.
MEGAMIND
Read on your own time. Open up.
Hey!
BOO!
Oh, good morning, Warden.
Great news, I'm a changed man.
And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.
You're a villain, and you're always be a villain.
You'll never change.
And you'll never leave.
- You're fun.
- You got a present in the mail.
Is it a puppy?
From Metro Man. To count every second of your 85 life sentences.
That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.
Oh but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.
Any chance you could give me the time?
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.
Oh no, looks like you're
By several thousand years.
Oh, am I?
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.
It's a beautiful day downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man.
Metro Man.
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.
For years he's been watching us
Saving us with his super strength, and caring for us with his super heart.
Now it's our turn to give something back.
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.
Wow, okay, the stuff they make you read on the air.
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.
What I was trying to say was,
I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news.
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we, like lets just get
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.
That's the first thing.
That's sweet of you.
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.
- Mmm.
- Okay, that sounded, Okay that
A little bit, yeah.
And you're making your face, and that's making me feel weird.
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying I'm in love with you.
I'm saying... Roxanne?
Roxaroo?
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.
- Freeze!
- Whoa, what are you doing, guys?
It's ME!
Hey, open up.
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.
You were right.
I'll always be a villain.
Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.
B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.
Bad to the bone.
Well hello good looking, need a lift?
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.
Get in the car, you.
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.
You got it, boss.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.
And... Metro Men.
Hey, Metro City!
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?
Give it to me... all right!
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.
Hey, Metro city.
Hello, hey.
You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit.
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you fellows.
Let's get real for a moment.
That's right, that's right ha, ha, that's right.
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.
Super cool, you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?
Do you really want to know?
Really?
Then I'll tell you.
The greatest honor you've given me is...
...letting me serve you.
To help these people of Metro city.
And at the end of every day.
Well.
I often ask myself.
Who would I be, without you?
I love you Metro Man!
And I love you, random citizen.
I tell you Minion, there's no place like evil lair.
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.
How do I look, Minion?
- Do I look bad?
- Disgustingly horrifying, sir.
You always know what to say.
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
Now, back to work.
She's awake,
Quick, to work.
- Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
- Would it kill you to wash the bag?
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.
Wha..why isn't she screaming?
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.
Like this... AHHHHH!
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.
AHHHHH!
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website, where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?
Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in...
Don't answer that.
...Romania.
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey reporter skills, on your weak little mind to find out all our secrets.
Such tricks... won't work... on me.
- Please talk slower
- Temptress.
What secrets? You're so predictable.
Predictable, predictable?
Oh, you call THIS predictable?
Your Alligators, yes.
I was thinking about it on the way over.
What's this? BOOM!
- In your face.
- Cliché.
No, look, watch.
Juvenile.
- Shuck it all!
- Tacky
- Oh, so sorry.
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?
- Garish.
Okay, the spiders new.
Spider?
Ee, Uh, yes!
The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus
Will instantly paralyze... OW!
Get it off!
- Ow!
- Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work.
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?
OOOWWW!
It is a great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.
If you please.
Hey! Uh, my kid can't see.
- Megamind.
- Oh, bravo Metro Man.
Booooo!
Yes, I can play along too.
Booooo.
Should have known you'd try to crash the party.
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.
This is the day you and Montrosity, shall not soon forget.
It's pronounced Metro City!
Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato.
We all know how this ends.
With you behind bars.
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots.
You will leave, Montrosity.
Or this will be the last you ever hear of,
Roxanne Ritchi!
- Huh?
- Roxanne!
- Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
- I'm not panicking.
In order to stop me, You need to find me first, Metro Man.
We're at the Metroman observatory.
Ah ha, no we're not!
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.
Metro Man approaching, sir.
- HAH!
- Hah, hah!
Hah, hah, hah.
Hold on a second.
Oh, good heavens.
You didn't think you were at the real observatory, did you?
Ready the death ray, Minion.
Death ray, readying.
Over here, old friend.
In case you haven't noticed,
You've fallen right into my trap.
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.
Even the most heartfelt belief, can be corroded with time.
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.
But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'.
It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold.
But it can be easily reheated, in the microwave of evil.
Well I think your warranty is about to expire.
Maybe I got an extended warranty?
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for it's intended purpose.
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand the full concentrated power of the... SUN!
FIRE!
Minion, fire...
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?
- Warming up, sir.
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?
One... sssecond... more.
Aaannnd.... jussst.
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap, tip top more.
And we are ready, in just.
Oh! I told you to have things running.
Told you out of the sounds.
Why do you always blame me?
My spider bite is acting.
Your plan is failing, just admit it.
Yeah, good luck with that one.
Whose side are you on?
The losing side.
- Thank you.
- Uh, could someone stamp my
You of all people, know that we discontinued that promotion.
- Ta, ta all.
- Same time next week?
What did he just say?
Crab nuggets?
Good lord, I'm trapped.
What kind of trickery is this?
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.
It, it has?
This dome is obviously lined with copper.
- Yeah, so?
- Sir!
Copper drains my powers.
Your weakness is copper?
You're kidding, right?
I don't think even he could survive that.
Well, lets not get our hopes up just yet.
- Look!
- Metro Man.
Metro Man...
Metro Man! AHHH!
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!
Ewwww.
You did it, sir.
I did it?
He did it.
I did it.
He did it.
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!
- You did it.
- I did it!
Montrocity is mine!
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.
All right people, hit it.
Hit it!
Living easy, living free.
Season ticket on a one way ride.
Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme
- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.
- Drop 'em.
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,
I'm on the Highway to...
- Highway..
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Highway..
- Ahh, ahh, ahh....
First off, what a turnout.
How wild is this, huh?
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.
Are there any questions?
Come on..yes?
You in the back.
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us.
And the city.
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of.
And multiply it by... SIX!
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
Normal people do.
Let's just have fun with this, come on.
And I will get back to you.
Now slam the door, really hard.
They can... they can still see you.
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.
- Oh,
- Let's get going.
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.
Ahh, Minion.
Did you think this day would ever come?
No way, not at all, sir. Never, never in a million, not even...
Yes, I did.
Look at the intricate moon links.
I'm looking, I'm looking.
And what's this?
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.
But it seems to only carry one station.
Oh, that sir is called a window.
- Window...
- All the kids are looking through them.
Oooo, I've never had a view before.
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.
If my parents could see me now.
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out of the way.
I can have, everything I want!
And there's no one to stop me.
All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...
Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
We may as well go home, as I did on my own.
Alone again, naturally.
To think that only yesterday.
I was cheerful bright and gay.
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do, the role I was about...
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.
I understand you, little well dressed bird.
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't it. What's your vacuum like?
Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.
I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.
I... is something wrong, sir?
Just think about it.
We have it all.
But we have nothing.
It's just to easy now.
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.
- I mean, we did it, right?
- Well, you did it, sir.
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.
- Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
- Huh?
Unhappy.
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.
That always seems to lift your spirits.
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?
- Him, sir?
- Nothing.
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh, something to consider and um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while then.
He was always there for us.
Dependable.
Perhaps we took him for granted.
Maybe we never really know how good we have it, until it's gone.
We miss you, Metro Man.
I, miss you.
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.
Are you happy now?
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero.
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas.
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party at my house.
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people.
No, no, no. That's why it'll just be, like you and me.
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.
- But,
- I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case, we were like something crazy happened.
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe we should have this for like ever, like a memory, you know.
Um, I'm gonna pass.
I have some work here I need to do. Okay, bye.
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?
- Goodnight, Hal.
- It's a soft yes, on Thursday.
What's, wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like bouncy houses, they like clown's.
OW! Ohhh!
Stupid van!
Broken finger!
I've made a horrible mistake.
I didn't mean to destroy you.
I mean, I meant to destroy you.
But I didn't think it would really work.
What are we suppose to do, without you?
I am so tired of running rampant through the streets.
What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
Someone has to stop, Megamind.
Hey, we're closing soon.
Oh, you scared me.
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.
Bernard, I was just well I was talking to myself.
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.
Thank you, I just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I have so many evil plans in the works.
The illiteracy beam.
Typhoon cheese.
Robo sheep.
Battles we will now, never have.
You know we never had the chance to say goodbye.
So, it's good that we have this time now.
You know, before I destroy the place.
Nothing personal, it just brings back to many painful memories.
Hello, hello?
Roxanne!
That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?
- Megamind's head is not that grossly big.
Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...
Hello, is someone there?
Hello, who's there?
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.
It's just you, Bernard.
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.
Well thank you for letting me stay.
And thirty seven seconds if I were you.
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down with you then.
I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes.
Yeah, he was really good at those.
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.
I've looked into the reset button.
The size is impossible.
Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you okay?
Metro Man is gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.
Oh, come on, Bernard.
As long as there's evil good will rise up against it.
Ohhh, I wish.
I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind.
- You really think so?
- Yeah.
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.
Hero’s can be made. That's it!
- All you need are the right ingredients.
- Yeah.
- Bravery.
- Yes.
- Strength.
- Of course.
- Determination.
- Imperative.
And a smidgen of DNA.
- With that, anyone can be a hero.
- Yeah!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I think we should run.
Bye.
Time to put the past behind us.
Only the future... AHH!
Oh, that's to much.
I'm definitely scared right now.
Oh, hope no ones seeing this.
Create a hero? A what?
Why would you do that?
So I have someone to fight.
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.
A ying, with no yang.
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.
In other words, I have no purpose.
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on, ask.
How are you doing to do it?
I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet.
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero.
Over here, follow.
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.
We could put everything back the way it was.
When the world was perfect.
And rosy. Behold, Minion.
Metro Man's cape.
Look closely.
Tell me what you see?
Dandruff?
Yes, it's his DNA.
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.
Boss, I think this is a bad idea.
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad, bad.
Okay, you might think it's good in your bad perception.
But from a good perception, it is just plain bad.
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.
Now we have just one shot at this.
I must find a suitable subject.
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.
What on earth is that?
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.
- O-llo,
- Uh, it's hello.
Hello, like that?
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.
I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day.
- Oh, You've inspired me too.
- Great!
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.
- I'm already hot on his trail.
- Uh, huh.
And what gives you that idea?
- Uh, sir.
- I just found his secret hideout.
How did she find my hideout?
Uh, how did you find his hideout?
This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof.
Okay, there's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
Oh! There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'.
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.
She'll discover all our secrets.
- Ohh, oh no!
- You dim-witted creation of science.
What? Oh, not you Roxanne.
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.
Roxanne?
Oh no, not again.
Roxanne.
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm glad you're here.
How did you get here so fast?
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.
- In a suit?
- Uh huh.
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.
But that's not important.
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.
No, it says, exit.
Uh, which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting', right?
It's the mother load.
- Ahh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Just look at this thing.
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.
- Really?
- You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?
- Yes, right.
- Together we could figure out his plan
Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.
Minion,
Code-Send out the brain pods.
You know the whole point of a code is...
Oh code-just do it, Minion.
Ahh, it's me you fools!
Bernard!
It's daddy.
Megamind!
What have you done with, Bernard?
Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless,
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!
You know the drill.
Oh no, not the drill.
- Let him go.
- Or what?
Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does.
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.
I'll just go get him.
Unhand me you fiend!
It, it's strength's to much.
Oh, I work out.
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.
Are you okay?
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.
I got this covered.
Let go, it's mine!
Bernard, help!
Give it to me.
Oh no!
Roxanne.
Ow!
Who on earth is that?
Roxanne!
Bernard, you were right about that door being exciting.
This way.
- Huh!
- What are you doing?
This will stop them, here!
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.
Just throw it.
Daddy's, suffering.
- Wow, that was real exciting.
- Yeah.
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
What's going on?
Hal, what happened?
I think a bee flew up my nose.
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me.
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...
- and they were all like crying, so.
- Wow.
Brave one, isn't he.
Who are you?
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.
- He's my partner.
- Partner?
Yes, yes partner.
Well look partner, I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's been through a traumatic experience.
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.
Yeah, okay.
I'd like that.
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally, okay lets end the meeting.
Sir!
Code-Did you find out who it was?
Huh?
Oh, oh.
Code-get the car.
Code-right away, sir.
- Buh bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hal.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
Who is this man, infused with godlike power?
Ow, ow, whoa ho.
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.
No criminal record.
Actually, no records at all.
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.
Not yet, Minion.
Not...
...Yet.
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?
So I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake.
No, Minion. Something much more powerful is at work.
This is no mistake.
It's destiny.
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.
Hal? Hal Stewart?
Am I saying it right?
Stewart.
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.
- Oops, all out.
- Well use the forget-me-stick.
Oh, right!
Just look at him.
Well, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me.
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.
I smell hero.
I smell something burning.
I think it's working!
Places, places...
You have your disguise?
What?
Ah, you look fantastic.
Rise, my glorious creation.
Rise, and come to Papa.
What's going on?
- Easy my child.
- Who are you?
I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice.
Honor, and nobility.
I am your father.
So you're like, my space Dad?
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.
And you are, what?
I'm your space, Step-Mom.
I, I had some work done recently.
Is this some kind of dream?
This is a dream come true.
You've been blethed with unfathomamble power.
What kind of power?
Unfathamomble.
It's un, without Fathom.
- Whoa
- Yeah, we've come to guide you.
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.
I know this is a lot to take in.
It may take months for you to come to grips..
No frickin' way.
Wahoo! Look at the big hero.
I'm a big hero.
Thee Minion, he's perfect.
Aaannd, action!
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.
Sun is shinning in the sky
Ohhh, oh!
There ain't a cloud in sight
Zap, zap, zap.
Ha, haaa!
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay something cool back at me.
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.
No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop.
I said slow down.
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!
- Maybe we should change tactics?
- You think so?
Oh, you know how boys are.
They want video games.
I can throw a few parts together.
Can't... wait.
LoL, smiley face.
Can't wait for what, sir?
Oh, that was such a funny story.
And brilliantly told, by the way.
Okay, now you tell one.
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.
And, I never heard you laugh before.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.
Mr. Blue, you did it right.
And, exit.
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind
I'll remember you this,
I'll remember you this way.
You don't get out much, do you?
Fun!
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite things to do.
Now look at it.
It's a dump.
Hey Mr. Blue, we're so please to be with you.
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?
Um, well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump, now... do we?
They're all back.
But how, why?
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.
Wa haoooo
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I, were never a couple.
But I thought you two were...
I know, everybody did. It's just, well he was never really my type.
Really?
Okay, now you tell me something.
Something you've never told anyone.
Well, in shh-school.
None of the other kids really liked me.
I was always last one picked for everything.
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't go to the same school.
Hal, I think you're ready for this.
Do I have a son?
No, Hal, you make me laugh.
It stretches, it's for you.
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?
Titan.
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?
It was the only name I could trademark.
Oh.
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?
No not yet, but.
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.
That's very good. Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.
- All you have to do, is save her.
And she'll be yours.
- Who want's Churro's?
- I do!
Thanks spaced out, momma.
On the count of three, unsheathe your Churro.
One, two, three!
To Titan.
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.
And the city will know your name.
The City's parks' restored to their original glory.
The street's, the safest they've been.
The banks reopened.
Has something happened to Megamind?
Has someone tamed this monster?
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic, but pleasantly confused.
Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.
Huh, how long is this going to take me?
Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be done with your most terrifying cape yet.
I'm calling it, Black
Mambaaaaaaa... aaaa... aaa.
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am running late. I have to go.
What, where, where are you going, sir?
We have our date to battle Titan in the morning.
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to, run a quick errand.
You don't run errands.
What's going on here?
- What?
- Oh, wait a minute.
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
Fleur Du?
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?
Ahhh.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.
Your going on a date with her.
No my main man, get out of town.
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.
Ahhh!
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think this is your first day at being evil.
NO!
This has gone far enough.
Oh, that was really grown up.
Sir please, it's for your own good.
Well what do you know.
I may not know much, but I do know this.
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.
You heard me.
Who are you?
- Now give me the keys.
- NO!
My soul purpose in life is to look after you.
Well I don't need you to look after me.
What are you... what are you saying?
- You don't need me?
- Let me make it clear.
Code-I don't need you.
You know what, you know what.
Code-I'll just pack my things and go.
Code-Fine!
Code-Fine back.
Well good luck on your date.
- I will.
- That doesn't even make any sense.
I know.
I know I am so close, I can feel it.
Okay, okay I just have to take a step back.
Wait a minute.
Titan.
What's a Titan?
My super ears are burning.
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.
The names Titan.
- Titan?
- Your very own heroic guardian
What's your name? Just kidding, I know everything about you.
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed you know, all of them.
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.
- What do you want?
- Thought maybe we could go for a little
- Get to know each other first.
- WHOA!
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Oh are we moving to fast?
You're probably right. I should just rescue you a few times before we get
Whoops!
Saved that, You are lucky to have such a great hero here.
Somebody do something?
No wait, Duh! I gotcha.
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.
- Ahhh, building!
- AHHHH!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Gotcha!
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.
Put me down, right now!
Okay, all right, all right, hold on.
Are you crazy?
I suppose I'm, a little crazy... about you.
Who are you? Really.
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.
- Tada!
- Hal?
Yeah, isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.
No, it's not great.
Aww, our first fight. This is so us, we're like an old married couple.
There is no us, okay. There will never be an us.
But, I have powers.
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.
You are a good guy, Hal.
But you don't understand we need to find out why...
Right now, this isn't right.
- Listen to me, Hal.
- You're suppose to be with me.
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.
Hmm, not the only exciting development of the night.
Megamind's created a new hero.
And I know why.
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created a new hero to kick it for him.
But why, Hal?
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.
Wow, that's a lot to take in.
It, it boggles my mind.
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt.
But in the mean time.
Let's enjoy each other's company.
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right, you know, I could use a breather.
To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world.
To... being normal.
- Roxanne.
- Yes?
Say I wasn't so normal.
Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color.
As a random, not a specific example.
Would you still enjoy my company?
Of course, you don't judge a book by its cover.
Or a person from the outside.
Oh, that's a relief to hear.
You judge them based on their actions.
Well that seems kinda petty, don't you think.
- You.
- What, what?
Oh, don't look at me!
Just, just a technical glitch.
Don't look yet.
My bad.
Where were we?
Now, now, hold on.
YOU!
I can explain.
What about everything you just said?
About judging a book by it's cover.
Well let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?
You destroyed Metro Man.
You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you.
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?
What could you possibly hope to gain?
Wait a minute.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
No...
Okay Minion, you were right.
I was.... less right.
We should stick to what we're good at.
Being bad.
Minion...
You there.
Yeah, you.
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!
Okay, Titan it's time to go down, in style.
I hear there's a new hero.
Who dares to challenge my evil.
Where is the one they call, Titan?
Challenge me, if you dare.
Oh no, we're gonna crash.
This is embarrassing.
Ballsy and incipient.
Boneheaded, irresponsible.
RUDE!
Unprofessional, that's what this is.
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?
Of course not, he was a pro.
Hey, Megamind. You're actually the guy I want to see.
Also, there's a door here.
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying to beat this score.
Were you even planning on showing up?
What's this?
Where did you get all this stuff?
It doesn't belong to me.
You stole it!
- Pretty cool, right.
- Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.
Being a hero is for losers.
It's work, work, work twenty four seven, and for what?
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.
Roxanne Ritchi?
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.
- Ohhhh
- Who needs all that noise.
That's why I think, WE should team up.
You? Wait! What?
With my power, and your big headedness, we could rule the city.
- You want to team up?
- I even drew up some new costume designs.
- See
- Costume design?
You have a brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume, or something.
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like two tanks sword fighting.
I can't believe you.
All your gifts all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain.
- Yes!
- NO!
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.
That's why I created you.
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
- Space Dad told me.
- Look, I'm your Space Dad.
You should be more like Metro Man.
You tricked me?
Oh, don't like that, huh?
Well there's more.
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.
- No.
- And we were smooching.
Mwah... Mwah... Mwah.
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna, gonna...
YES! Yes I know.
Break me in two. Oh god, how I missed this.
And the hero strikes the first blow.
But evil returns with a backhand.
YES!
Ahh... shhhh.
Come out you little freak!
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement.
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.
You little blue, twerp.
En Garde!
Oh, now that's the spirit.
Take, that, and again!
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter.
You go first.
Look I'm not sure where you're going at.
This one's for pursuing my girlfriend.
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.
And Megamind! This is for
Space, Step-Mom.
You lied to her!
Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling went really, really well.
I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?
- But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue.
- You're dead!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.
Game over.
Great button.
I'm calling time out.
Time out, time out!
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from Copper. You're powerless against it.
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...
Metro Man?
You, should stop comparing me to Metro Man.
You run Megamind, but you can't hide.
We're saved, we're saved!
What's your name, new hero?
- It's Tighten.
- Thank you, thank you.
Tighten has freed us.
Oh I wouldn't say free.
More like, under new management.
What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.
- Congratulations, another one of your genius
And why did my doorman let you up?
- Carlos?
- What are you, no, no!
I need your help.
Why do you need MY help?
Because you're the smartest person I know.
Well you can't hide here.
Copper should have worked, why didn't the copper work?
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.
Copper? You're not making any sense.
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.
Okay, how can I help?
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.
Well, there is one place I know.
You gave him these powers, can't you just take them away?
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.
The night you dumped me.
Alone.
In the rain.
- Did you ever look back?
- NO!
- Oh, my giant blue head.
- I guess we're here.
So, this is where he hid it.
After all these years. My old shhool house.
You know, I think there's an apology in order, for the other night.
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.
Wow, can't believe he kept all this stuff.
Aww, I remember when he wore that.
Can you just stay focused here?
Yes of course, you're right, focused.
HEY! Come over and look at this.
What is it?
Um..... look!
This glass has ice cubes in it.
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?
One of life’s great mysteries.
Hey.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
We now run a confirmed report.
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.
The city has never seen this level of destruction.
If only Metro Man were still alive.
- You're alive?
- You're alive.
I'm alive.
But..we..we saw your skeleton.
- You were dead.
- Are you a ghost?
There had better be, an amazing explanation for this.
Speak, apparition.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You both deserve the truth.
It all started back at the observatory.
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you.
My head wasn't in the game that day.
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...
Using my super speed.
I decided to go clear my head.
Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.
But I just felt stuck.
I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't.
A choice.
Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be.
But what about what I wanted to do?
Then it suddenly hit me.
I do have a choice.
I can be whatever I want to be.
No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig.
You can't just quit either.
That's when I got the brilliant idea...
...to fake my death.
Copper drains my powers!
You're weakness is copper?
Once your death ray hit.
I never felt so alive.
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.
Metro Man was finally dead.
And Music Man was born.
Music man?
That way I can keep my logo.
- WHAT?
- 'Cause of what?
Finally I'm free, to get in touch with my true power.
Weaving lyrical magic.
Check this out.
I have eyes that can see
right through leaaadd.
- Ewww
- Granted you have talent,
But there's a mad man out there destroying our... your city.
Why did you do this?
The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them.
No offense.
No, I'm with you.
Look, we need your help.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Um, I'm, I'm done.
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying for every Yang.
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.
Now it's about time, you find yours.
Hey, who needs him.
We can beat Tighten ourselves.
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns, hold them sideways, and just go all gangsta on 'em.
We can't
So that's it? You're just giving up?
I'm the bad guy.
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl.
I'm going home.
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay indoors until further notice.
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
Hal!
Hal!
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses.
Well, I'm over you.
I've come to stop you, Hal.
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you going to do, report me to death?
I was going to try reasoning with you.
You and I, we worked together for a long time.
I know you.
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.
I want to talk to the real Hal.
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man, and eating dip,
And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal.
To late!
Megamind.
You and I have some unfinished business.
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower, oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.
Roxanne!
Come on Roxi, call for your hero to come rescue you.
Megamind.
I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are...
You can't give up.
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight.
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.
It was your best quality.
You need to be that guy, right now.
The city needs you.
I need you.
Roxanne.
You have one hour.
Don't... keep me waiting.
Warden, Warden!
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life sentences to go.
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.
Here it is. Black is part of my heart.
I.... AM.... Sorry!
Not buying it.
I don't blame you.
I've terrorized the city countless times.
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.
I lied to Roxanne, and...
My best friend, Minion.
I treated like dirt.
Please, don't make this city,
Don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings.
Apology accepted.
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.
You got me!
Good luck, fellows.
We're gonna die!
Wait, what?
Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.
They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength.
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.
And I hate reminders.
HAL!
Please don't do this.
I know there's still good in you, Hal.
You're so naive, Roxie.
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.
You're weaving a fantasy.
There is no Easter bunny.
There is no tooth fairy.
And there is no Queen of England.
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.
You dare to challenge Megamind?
This town isn't big enough for two super villains.
Oh, you're a villain all right.
Just not the super one.
Yeah, what’s the difference?
PRESENTATION!
I knew you'd come back.
Well, that makes one of us.
- What's the plan?
- Well, mostly involves, not dying.
I, like that plan.
I can't control it.
No!
Well, that was easy.
Looks like there's only one loose end now.
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.
You came back.
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.
Whoa, I... I thought you were dead.
My death was, greatly exaggerated.
So, you're the punk I've heard about.
Whoa!
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.
I'm so proud of you.
Minion?
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.
He's the real hero.
Megamind.
Going somewhere?
Besides jail.
No, not in the face there, please.
If you know what's good for you Tighten.
You'll stay out of Montrosity.
- You got it!
- Good!
Pretty sneaky, sis.
But there is only one person I know who calls this town, Montrosity.
Ooops.
You!
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.
You're not going to be laughing no more.
The invisible car. Hey, remember that night that I dumped you?
You are bringing this up now?
I did look back.
You did?
YOU DID!
Yes, and you should look back, right now.
Oh, I get it.
This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me.
I made you a hero.
You did the fool thing, all by yourself.
Oh, uh...
You're so pathetic.
No matter what side you're on.
You're always the looser.
There's a benefit to loosing.
You get to learn from your mistakes.
What?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.
Enjoy your flight.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Megamind.
So, this is how it ends.
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.
But not today!
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.
Say bye, bye Roxie.
Ollo.
Thing about bad guys, they always LOOSE!
Ohhhh.
You did it, you won.
Well, I finally had a reason to win.
You.
MINION!
Can't see it's cold and... warm, and dark and light.
It's me, Minion.
I'm right here.
We've had a lot of adventures together.
You and I.
We have, Minion.
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure, but,
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?
Yes Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.
Code-We're the good guys now.
Code-I guess we are.
Oh, oh. I'm going... I mean this is...
This is it, I mean I'm going far awa...
Oh, what a drama queen.
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim
- He had you, didn't he.
- Whew!
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.
There he is with that little face. Look at that face.
We did it!
We did it!
- Fist pump!
- You did it!
We won, we won, we won.
What! Get back you savages!
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
But the path we choose for ourselves.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Now hand over your wallets.
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.
I have to admit.
Being good, has its perks.
You know, you look pretty good in white.
Megamind, if you please.
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.
Sorry my friend.
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!
Defender of Metro City.
You know, I like the sound of that.
Hit it!

Come on.
No!
Chaos.
Destruction.
Unpredictability.
Our universe... is a dangerous place.
In our solar system, there are over a thousand asteroids and comets that are classified as threatening to hit the earth.
But you should also know that those are just the ones we know about.
Just last year, an asteroid
200 feet in diameter passed within
40,000 miles of us.
Now in planetary terms, that is like, uh... it's like someone shooting at you and having a bullet part your hair without touching your skin.
Now, if it had hit us, it would have exploded with the force of a hydrogen bomb.
Do you know how much advance warning we had?
Three days.
The good news is, we have the technology to deflect these objects.
It's called Project 7.
The most advanced, most powerful, most ambitious planetary defense system ever conceived.
It's equipped with an energy field that allows it to deflect objects many times its size.
The bad news?
- There's always bad news.
- (students laugh)
Our government pulled funding from Project 7 just before it came online.
So right now it floats dormant in space.
The earth's been struck before, it'll be struck again.
The only question is whether we're gonna be ready.
Do your part in protecting the planet.
Write to your congressman, tell your friends.
Spread the word.
Our lives may depend on it.
We need Project 7.
You.
You need Project 7.
- Thank you very much.
- (applause)
Dr. Preston, Brad Walker.
Your liaison officer with Mission Ops.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
- Yeah.
- As you know, it is our policy to, uh, notify family members immediately of any situation involving the mission that may arise.
- I know the protocol.
- Now, I've been sent here to make sure you don't hear anything through the media that may make you worry unnecessarily.
Now, having said that, um, early this morning, we did lose contact with the Nautilus.
Dr. Preston.
Dr. Preston, wait.
Dr. Preston.
- (line ringing)
- Dr. Preston: Come on, pick up.
- (phone chimes)
- Recording: We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again...
- Damn it!
...or call your oper...
Okay.
All right.
- Hello?
- Hey, it's James.
I can't talk to you.
I'm at work.
- If Edward finds out...
- I'm worried about Victoria.
Today was orbit capture.
They lost contact with the Nautilus.
I can't reach Mission Ops.
Do you know anything?
I don't, but Houston doesn't call the military every time they have a glitch.
You know that.
It's probably nothing.
I'm sure Victoria's fine.
I know you have eyes in the sky.
Just check it out for me, okay?
Call me back if you find anything.
You know I can't talk to you about this stuff.
Edward doesn't even like that we're friends.
- What the hell?
- What?
Jennifer, did SPEAR just activate Project 7?
What are you talking about?
It's dead.
It's been dead for three years.
Oh, uh, it's sending me data.
Jennifer:
It's sending data to you?
If Edward finds out that you've been monitoring it, he'll throw you in jail so fast that you won't know...
Okay, uh, something weird is happening.
Project 7 is picking up a strange...
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Oh, that's impossible.
- Status report.
- The EM wave knocked out virtually every civilian satellite and most government ones as well.
We're the only major agency fully functioning right now.
- But that's not our only problem.
- Three sets of images, all pulled from the deep-sky orbital telescope before it went down completely.
These were all taken only five minutes apart.
What's that spot?
That spot, sir,
- is Mercury.
- That can't be right.
- That would mean that...
- Mercury's on the move.
- How's that possible?
- We don't have all the data yet.
We still don't know.
Figure out where it's headed.
I want to know if that thing is coming anywhere near us.
Jennifer:
We're already on it.
Marshall?
Oh, thank God.
Breathe.
Check Lee.
Go, I'll take care of Lee.
- (electricity buzzing)
- (coughs)
Mercury will miss the Earth by a distance of 500,000 miles.
Roughly twice as far away as the moon.
- That's not good.
- Exactly.
Even at that distance, its gravitational field will wreak havoc.
Extreme tides, electrical disturbances at a minimum.
Well, our primary concern at this point has gotta be the political fallout.
Put our defense systems on high alert.
I've also had Michelle working to get in touch with the Nautilus, but we haven't had any success.
Nautilus is the least of our concerns at this point.
But they were right there.
If the Nautilus did manage to pull through, they may be able to fill in the blanks.
Fine, but you keep
James Preston out of it.
Yes, sir.
Man over radio: We are continuing to receive some frantic reports of massive power failures around the world.
Global communications continue to be affected, as most satellites seem to be off-line.
All air transportation is being grounded until further notice.
We'll continue to bring you details as they develop.
Oh man.
I've normalized our oxygen levels, but most of our systems are damaged.
Communication is down, as is navigation.
Right.
What the hell hit us?
It seemed like a solar flare, but it was massive.
All of the energy readings are wrong.
Well, we'll have to worry about that later.
Right now we've got bigger problems.
I've managed to stabilize us.
Do what you can with communication.
I'll work on navigation.
Okay.
We need to figure out where the hell we are.
- (beeps)
- (clears throat)
- Hey.
- Hey.
Check it out.
A little Sumatra blend.
You want some?
I need you to take a look at this, okay?
It's about Victoria.
Something happened up there and I need to know how it's gonna affect the Nautilus.
Well, it was a massive solar flare that hit us this morning.
Biggest one on record, but the Nautilus should be prepared
- for that kind of event.
- It's not a solar flare.
Okay, look.
Its magnetic signature, it's off the charts.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just a headache.
Any luck on the comm?
Well, we'll only be able to transmit and receive on a very narrow band.
But they'll be able to hear us?
If they're listening.
Woman on radio:
Power blackouts.
Communication failures.
Airplanes grounded.
The government wants you to think it's a solar flare, but we are here to give you the truth.
Brooke Adamson's
"Conspiracy Report" is back on the air.
Nice.
- (static hissing)
- What's wrong?
- (grumbles)
- (electricity buzzing)
No, it's just, uh, getting some interference.
- It's not us.
- It's the Feds.
- It's not the Feds.
- It's the Feds.
Victoria over radio: This is
Victoria Preston of the USS Nautilus making an emergency distress call.
Can anybody read?
No way.
- What?
- (static hissing)
This is Victoria Preston on the USS Nautilus. Come in.
Isn't the Nautilus the spacecraft that's on the Mercury mission?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it's gotta be a joke.
Well, we'll find out.
First we'll lock on her signal.
Here.
Um... copy that, Nautilus.
You're breaking up.
- Do you read?
- Copy that.
This is Victoria Preston on the Nautilus. We are in distress.
Before we proceed, please encrypt this transmission using security protocol 27-46-32.
- What are you doing?
- If it's a hoax, they'll play along.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because that's what I would do.
Victoria: There's no such protocol.
Who exactly am I speaking with?
Give me that.
This is Christopher Weaver and Brooke Adamson.
We're seniors at North Bay University.
You've managed to connect with our pirate radio station.
Victoria, do you copy that?
Come in.
- What happened?
- We gotta get that signal back.
Let's go to the car.
We'll try new batteries.
Before my telescope went off-line,
I was able to pull these images.
Look at these sun-spots.
They're starting to disappear here, and here, here, and here.
- What does that mean?
- Magnetism.
It all makes sense now.
For one brief millisecond, our humble little sun became a magnetar, the most powerful source of magnetic energy in the universe.
A magnetar?
Yeah, it's extremely rare, but it's the only thing that could explain it.
The sun-spots, the blackouts, the magnetic wave, everything.
- (loud thud)
- What was that?
Whoa.
This should not be happening.
There's no way our database could have missed this many meteors approaching Earth.
Buddy, either you're wrong
- or that's not a meteor.
- (loud boom)
That impact site can't be more than a mile or two, tops.
Let's take my car. I don't want to have to ride on your handlebars.
Very funny.
- Get in the car.
- I enjoy riding my bike to work.
- It's something that I like to do.
- Get in the car.
Uh, this is not good.
Do you know where we are yet?
No.
But we're accelerating without engine power.
Well, you check autopilot and see if there's been any false commands and I'll see what I can do.
Yes, ma'am.
Wow.
Something's definitely wrong.
- There's still no signal.
- I don't know.
Do you think that was really the Nautilus?
Yeah, I do.
I do.
- (gasps)
- Whoa!
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but there's more coming.
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
- (explosions continue)
- James?
Run. Run!
Get down!
Oh, boy.
Is it over?
I think so.
What the hell happened?
Matthew: Whoa.
Computer:
Navigation systems initializing.
- (beeps)
- Flight path compromised.
Marshall, I've checked everything.
I can't find anything wrong.
Get up here.
I need your help with navigation.
We need to figure out where we're headed now.
- And we are back up.
- Computer: Plotting Nautilus location.
- Marshall: Wait, this can't be right.
- What is it?
We're not where we should be.
Neither is Mercury.
How is that possible?
Marshall:
I don't know. It's out of orbit.
No. We're accelerating towards the planet.
Mercury is dragging us in?
But we're not close enough to be in its gravity.
Whatever it is,
I don't want to be any closer.
Computer:
Reverse thrusters engaged.
Victoria, we need to get a hold of Mission Ops.
Right.
Okay.
Maybe.
- (static hissing)
- Ground, do you copy?
Can you hear me?
Ground, this is Victoria.
Do you copy?
Thrusters are at 70%.
I don't like this.
- (static hissing)
- Ground, this is Victoria. Do you copy?
- Yeah, Victoria. We're here.
- Oh, thank God.
I need you to get in touch with Mission Control. It's urgent.
Well, if you're trying to warn us about meteors,
- you're a little late for that.
- Christopher, the Nautilus has been knocked off course.
I need Mission Ops to guide us.
Marshall: Come on.
Mission Ops is in Houston.
We're in Oregon and the phones are down.
Oregon, okay.
I need you to get to a facility south of Seattle called SPEAR.
SPEAR. I know that.
My cousin lives nearby.
Okay, great. When you get there, ask for a person named Jennifer Kelly.
Tell her what I've told you, that we need Mission Ops to guide Nautilus, and give her this frequency to get in touch.
And, please, our lives depend on it.
We're on it.
Let's go.
It has an extremely high iron content.
Way too high for an ordinary piece of meteorite.
This might sound crazy, but I think this is a piece of Mercury.
It's a magnetized piece of Mercury.
If it was hit by the magnetar wave, that would explain why it's magnetic.
Even so, how are pieces of it down here?
I don't know.
- (beeping)
- Thrusters are at maximum.
- We're still being pulled in.
- I can do a manual override in the engine room to boost the thrusters, but it's a temporary fix at best.
- Do it!
- Got it!
This is weird.
You want to read me those coordinates again?
Yeah. Uh...
- right ascension...
- Mm-hmm.
...13 hours...
- Mm-hmm.
...17 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.
- Declination...
- Yeah.
...negative-7 degrees...
- Yeah.
...2 arcminutes.
It's not there.
What are you talking about?
- It's not there.
- Where is it?
I don't know.
It's just... it's gone.
- Do you mind?
- It's just gone.
Okay.
They were right there.
Mercury was right... they were right there.
All right, that... that's impossible.
A planet doesn't just move.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get some answers.
Marshall, I got you another 20%, but that's the best I could do.
Let's hope it's enough.
There's not enough power in the reverse thrusters.
I need to flip us around and engage the main engine.
That's too risky.
We can't use the reverse thrusters and turn the ship at the same time.
We'd be pulled in immediately.
- Not if we do it fast enough.
- We?
It's a two-man job, Victoria.
But I'm not a pilot.
Welcome to your promotion.
Victoria, reduce power by 20% when I boost the main engines.
Copy that.
Now!
Reducing power.
We're being pulled in sideways.
Marshall?
Marshall?!
Maneuver successfully executed.
Okay, I need you to take over for a while.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
I think I might have got hit hard...
Marshall!
Yes?
We need to see
Jennifer Kelly right away.
- And you are?
- We have an urgent message from Victoria Preston and the Nautilus spacecraft.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
- So if you could just please...
- Excuse me, sir, the Nautilus is having severe mechanical malfunctions and they can't get a hold of Mission Ops, but they can get a hold of my radio.
- We were sent here to see Jennifer...
- This is a secure facility.
No one gets in without an appointment or a pass.
- Yeah, I understand that, but...
- That was me telling you nicely.
Don't make me tell you again.
Let's go.
- Great.
- Guard: Let's go.
James, I know what must be going through your head right now.
Then you'll stop the small talk.
It's just we don't know anything for sure yet.
There's a very good chance that she's alive.
Mercury didn't disappear.
It was knocked out of orbit.
- I tracked its gravity...
- And my wife... probably should be walking on Mercury right now.
Now pieces of it are landing on the Earth.
You understand?
They didn't believe us.
- The guard wouldn't even call Jennifer.
- Fascist.
What should we do now?
Find my husband,
Dr. James Preston.
He'll be at our home in Pacific Grove.
433 Ocean Beach Drive.
Come on, James.
Look, I don't care if your facility's on lockdown, okay?
Try her number again
'cause I need to talk to her.
- Sir, you need to calm down.
- Oh, I need to calm down?
I used to work here, okay?
I can't call her because my phone doesn't work.
It's urgent.
Stand down.
James, you need to leave.
You know you can't be here.
I can't share classified information with you.
What about Mercury?
Is that classified?
- Look, we know all about Mercury.
- Do you?
Do you also know it's magnetized?
He's with me.
You, stay there.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Show him.
Nice trick.
So what?
This thing, this was attached to Mercury.
You have to recalculate the planet's trajectory based on magnetism.
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Massive magnetar wave hit Mercury.
It is now extremely magnetized.
If it's anywhere near Earth, it'll lock on to our magnetic field... it'll come straight for us.
Well, we've tracked its trajectory, and while it is headed our way, we're comfortably certain that it will miss us.
You're not factoring in the magnetism.
You have to recalculate.
Based on our new data, the calculations show the trajectory has changed.
Oh, my God.
Mercury's on a collision course with Earth.
Look at the distance it's covered.
- It's moving faster.
- It's locked on to us.
Earth's magnetic field is drawing it in.
It's like two magnets pulling it together.
This is beyond an extinction level event.
- This is the end of the world.
- How long have we got?
Just over 18 hours.
Okay, people, this is why we have a contingency plan.
Initiate Operation Recourse.
I wanna be online in 30 minutes.
Jennifer: Yes, sir.
Edward...
Operation Recourse won't work.
Your missiles aren't strong enough to stop a planet.
We are not trying to stop Mercury.
We're gonna deflect it.
The missiles will cause coordinated standoff explosions in front of the planet and drive it off course.
I already know what your plan is.
You're assuming that your guidance system will withstand a magnetic interference and synchronize the blast.
They can go off course.
They could explode before they get there.
Worse, they get sucked back into the planet, they blow it to fragments, they wipe us out anyway!
Our missiles are properly shielded.
Not against this.
Going ahead with this launch, you're choosing suicide over a firing squad.
Your sarcasm is really better suited to your community college lectures.
You don't have a say in what we do here.
We launch as soon as Mercury is within our firing range.
James:
Edward, Edward, listen.
What about Project 7?
This is exactly what it was designed for.
The deflector never worked in field testing, not once.
Without that, it's just a big rock with engines.
We've been modifying the software, we've been working out the bugs.
You pulled it so you can give your contracts to your rocket manufacturing buddies.
Well, if that's the way you want to see your failure, that's your business, but, regardless, we don't have time to dust it off now.
I can get the deflector field to work.
I've been uploading the software since I left.
I'm sorry.
You've been doing what?
- Hacking into a government weapon?
- That's my weapon.
It hasn't been your weapon since I fired you three years ago.
I could have you thrown in prison for this.
It'll work.
Just gotta let me upload the fixes.
We don't have the time or resources to launch two programs.
We're only gonna get one shot at this... and I am not gonna risk the fate of humanity on your unproven technology.
I think you know the way out.
Okay.
- Chris: Wait.
- (tires screech)
- Which way?
- I don't know.
Is this North Coast Road?
I don't know.
There's no road signs.
Let's try this way.
And you're sure P-7 is the key to stopping Mercury?
- Stake my life on it.
- Sounds like you'll be staking
- everyone's life on it, James.
- My software updates will work.
We just need to upload them to get P-7 fully online.
- That sounds easy enough.
- We just need to go to my office, get the software, then we need a secure SPEAR computer.
Did you say we?
Hello?
Mr. Preston?
- (tires screeching)
- (rumbling)
Whoa.
- Hey, hey, keep the car straight.
- It's not me.
It's the ground that's moving.
Whoa.
Oh, my God.
- It's metal.
- What?
It's not trees, it's not telephone poles.
Whatever that is, it only affected metal.
This must all be connected to Mercury.
It has to be.
Jennifer: That's not good.
That's not good at all.
We've just received report...
Seattle's been devastated by a massive magnetic event.
- How far are we from launching?
- We've had to recalculate.
Mercury's speeding up and we're having a hard time keeping a lock on it.
We have a very small window to launch these missiles and we're running out of time.
What happened to your security pass?
- Find Preston.
- Yes, sir.
- Just follow me.
- (distant dog barking)
Oh, wait.
I read on the Internet somewhere that you can open up any door with a credit card.
I think, eh, yeah, you just...
I don't know.
People never leave these things locked.
Right.
Mr. Preston?
Is anyone home?
Hello?
Hey, come here.
God, the phones still aren't working.
There's nothing here.
Nothing useful anyways.
(computer, modem beeping and buzzing)
- What is that?
- I don't know.
Looks like some kind of weapon.
Whose car is that?
What kind of guy keeps plans for a top secret weapon on his computer?
Brooke: If he were here right now,
I'd give him a piece of my mind.
What the hell are you doing in my house?
- Look, your wife sent us.
- What are you talking about?
We talked to her.
She's in trouble.
- Brooke: We can prove it.
- Yeah.
What?
Well, it's just over there.
Please?
So I used some of today's engineering with yesterday's analog technology with a few experimental bits here and there and voilà.
It broadcasts and receives farther than you can imagine.
Well, it's a work of art.
It's how we heard
Victoria's mayday.
- You wanna turn it on?
- Yeah, sorry.
Okay.
Yeah, cool.
Vic, you there?
Victoria?
Victoria:
Ground, can you please repeat?
Vic, it's me.
Um...
- you safe?
- I'm alive, but I'm the only one left.
James: What happened?
Are you okay?
Something crazy has happened and I can't really explain it, but I'm being pulled into Mercury.
Oh, my God, the magnetism.
Vic, there's been a huge magnetic event.
Yes, I know.
We were right in the middle of it.
Mercury's been magnetized and is being pushed out of its orbit.
Magnetism.
Why didn't I think of this?
Okay, if I can recalculate, if I can account for the difference in force,
I might be able to break free and come home.
Vic, there might not be a home to come back to.
Mercury's on a collision course with Earth.
Can you keep me posted on this and just double-check these?
Woman:
I just lost everything.
What is going on?
This facility should be impervious to power surges.
Mercury's interference is increasing.
It's becoming more than our shielding can handle.
Get the emergency generators back online.
The moment they stabilize,
I want those missiles in the air!
Edward, what if James is right?
Move aside.
Project 7 is the only thing that can save us from Mercury.
You need to get the hell out of there before we launch.
Victoria:
Okay, I've done everything I can to recalculate for the change in force.
I've tried to boost the engines as much as possible, but it's just not enough thrust.
Wait a minute.
What if I let it pull me in?
- What do you mean?
- A slingshot maneuver.
Yes, yes, yes.
She lets the planet pull her in, accelerating around Mercury.
That will give her the extra momentum she needs to break free.
That's a suicide mission.
- Magnetism is too unpredictable.
- Victoria: I've been trained for this.
Honey, honey.
You're not a pilot.
You've never done this before.
I have to try.
If I stay here, I'm dead.
It's my only chance.
No, no, no, no.
Vic?
Vic?!
- James, can you hear me?
- (static hissing)
Sorry, it's fragile.
It wasn't built to be dragged around like this.
- Can you hear me?
- (static hissing)
- Disengage autopilot.
- Computer: Autopilot disengaged.
Here goes nothing.
- She'll make it, she'll make it.
- (modem screeching)
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be all right.
What is that?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?
Project 7's guidance systems are damaged.
- Can't you fix it?
- It's not a software problem, it's hardware.
You can't fix it from the ground.
- So that's it?
- Um, the Nautilus.
The Nautilus has an amazing guidance system.
If Victoria can pilot the ship to Project 7, tether onto its system, we can then use it to manually guide the asteroid straight into Mercury.
We still have to do the software updates.
Without the energy field, you won't have enough force to knock Mercury off course.
- So send them.
- I can't do it from here.
Can monitor the systems, but to change anything,
I need a computer that has top-level classified access.
- And you need to fix that radio.
- (electricity buzzing)
That's another power surge.
- (buzzes)
- Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Here we go, here we go.
- (beeps)
- I got it.
Whoa.
Yes, Mr. President. Believe me, we're doing everything we can.
No, sir. These are limited range missiles.
The timing is crucial.
If we launch too early the missiles will fall short, too late, and Mercury won't be knocked off course enough to miss Earth.
- Mr. President, are you there?
- (dial tone)
Mr. President?
- I'm gonna need a new relay.
- There's an old airstrip.
One of the radio planes might have what you need.
Right, I saw it on the way in.
Here, once we get the radio up and running, we'll call you on it.
Okay. Is this even gonna work with all the interference?
Trust me, we reached Mercury with this thing. It'll work.
You gonna tell me where we're going?
The fallback facility.
- Which is what exactly?
- Designed when I was working at SPEAR.
They should have access to every weapon,
- including Project 7.
- Should have access?
The coordinates are in records storage.
- We don't even know where it is?
- That's why we're hurrying.
Hello?
Anybody here?
If we're gonna find that relay switch,
- we better start looking for it.
- I don't know. This place is creepy.
- I don't like it.
- It's a creepy old airstrip.
What did you expect?
- Here, this looks like the hangar.
- Okay.
Hello?
- I think this is the hangar.
- Okay.
- Let's check the yard here.
- Okay.
- Anything?
- No.
- Here.
- What exactly are we looking for?
We're looking for a radio that's still intact.
Okay.
No, these are all shells.
- We need to get to that hangar.
- Okay.
Hey.
- Quick.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
- Is it more meteors?
I don't think so.
It feels more like an earthquake.
- Earthquake?
- Worse, we're being hit by massive waves of electromagnetic energy.
We still can't risk launching too early.
If this EM interference increases, you won't be able to launch the missiles.
You can't fire when the interference is spiking.
Okay, then calculate intervals in between the wavelengths
- and we'll fire in between.
- Yes, sir.
- Is it over?
- I think so.
Okay, maybe this plane will have what we need.
Let's find out.
Computer:
Trajectory calculations complete.
- (beeping)
- Warning, possible collision course detected.
Recommend replotting trajectory.
Project 7.
Stupid.
What were
Projects 1 through 6?
I don't even want to know.
- Any luck?
- I think I got it.
- (static hissing)
- Yes.
We're in business.
Okay, let's get out of here.
Okay.
Stop where you are or I'll drop you where you stand.
What the hell are you doing with my plane?
- Sir...
- Shut up!
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna drop that, you're just gonna... you're gonna slowly put that down on the ground.
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna put
- your hands in the air.
- Right, okay.
Sir, we needed one part.
We've been communicating with the spacecraft Nautilus.
Sure, you have.
Hands in the air now!
Brooke: You don't understand.
This is a matter of life and death.
- We can't leave without that radio.
- You're gonna leave without the radio because it's my radio.
You know what I mean?
It's my radio.
Hurry!
Go, go!
Say your prayers, you little bastard!
How are we supposed to get inside?
There's no way to sneak around that guard.
- How'd you get that?
- I borrowed it.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
- Morning.
- Hi there.
Hey, stop right there.
Gonna need to see that ID again, sir.
Yeah, here you go.
Here you go.
G-g-g-g-gun!
Get the gun!
Get the gun!
- (gunshots)
- Help, help!
- (gunshots)
- Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
- Ow!
- Back it up. Over there, over there.
Sorry about that.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Over there, over there, over there.
What do we do?
What do we do now?
- Give me the gun.
- Okay, huh?
Just give me the gun.
Hey, hey, hey!
Back up!
Back up!
Okay, there's rope in the car.
Go get the rope.
- Keys.
- The car is open!
- Whoa! Get down!
- (screams)
Get down, get down!
Wait, can you just...
Come on, let's go!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, he's reloading.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Go, go, go!
What?
Brooke:
Oh, God.
We need to get out of here now.
- Brooke, come on!
- I'm coming!
Let's go, go, go!
Brooke:
I'm hurrying!
Matthew: Whoa.
So, uh, where do we start?
Hang on, these... aren't file cabinets supposed to have letters on them?
Secret codes, secret files, they get bar codes.
So how are we supposed to find the one we're looking for?
You take that side,
I'll take this side.
- Okay, all right.
- Just look for things that have structures, buildings, things grouped together.
- Stuff like that.
- Okay.
- Matthew?
- Yes.
- You don't have to be neat.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, well.
Fast.
Just want to keep some semblance of organization.
This took somebody a long time.
Computer: Warning, planetary gravity affecting course trajectory.
That's the plan, girl.
Computer:
Initiating emergency autopilot failsafe in five, four...
Override accepted.
Impact risk imminent.
I think I got it.
Down on the ground now!
Where's your buddy?
Oh, about time.
Where's the file?
Next time,
I'll tie him up.
I'm sorry, they don't teach you how to tie people up in astronomy school.
I still saved your butt.
- Brooke?
- Brooke: Go ahead, James.
I have the location.
Where should we meet you?
Take Highway 37.
We'll meet you at the junction at Highway 12.
- Brooke: Okay.
- Oh, and I picked this up for later.
Figured we might need it.
- You want a hug?
- Yeah, yeah, I would.
I need those wave calculations.
We're approaching the launch window.
We're working on it.
We just got systems back up.
- We're running out of time.
- I know the time table!
Sir.
Look, Jen, get a team ready and take them over to the fallback facility.
We gotta cover our bases.
If the systems go down here,
I'm not gonna be able to launch.
I need you over there to launch from there.
I'll get you the launch codes.
Michelle, please stay on those wavelengths.
Michelle: Yes, sir.
Matthew: Whoa, stop. Stop the car.
He looks like he's alive.
- James: We don't have time for this.
- We can't just leave him here.
- Matthew, get back in the car.
- We can't leave him here.
- Matthew, get back in the car!
- (man groaning)
It'll be fine.
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, buddy. You okay?
We gotta get you... we gotta get you...
- Get up, nice and slow.
- Hey.
- Easy.
- Step away from the car!
- Step away from the car!
- Take it easy, man.
Just take it easy.
Don't do it, James!
Shut up!
You think I'm kidding around?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?!
- Easy, easy.
- Get the hell away from the car!
- Buddy, I can't give you the keys.
- Shut up!
- I can't give you the keys!
- Don't be stupid, man!
- I'll cut his throat!
- I can't give you the car.
Oh, you're gonna give me the car.
- Hey!
- What's this, huh?
What are you doing?
What's this, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay!
- The keys!
- I'm gonna give you the keys.
- Yeah, you will.
- I'll give you the keys.
- Give me the keys.
That's good.
- Don't move.
- Dude.
We need to call the kids.
The radio's in the car.
It's happening again.
Hang in there, girl.
Computer: Warning, impact risk ahead.
Multiple objects approaching.
- We're almost there, girl!
- (alarm blaring)
Hold on!
Computer: Warning, heat shield breached.
Maximum pressure capacity exceeded.
- (yells)
- Computer: All systems critical.
Abort maneuver.
Repeat, abort maneuver.
Where's Matthew?
- You get the part?
- Yeah, but we haven't heard anything from Victoria yet.
Let's hope she's in the middle of the maneuver.
We gotta get out of here.
Go!
Hold it together a little longer!
Computer:
Trajectory compromised.
- Change course immediately.
- (yelling)
I have all the wave patterns mapped and the systems are all up, and there's still a lot of interference.
Okay, get ready, everyone.
We launch the second we have a clear shot.
Computer:
Course trajectory complete.
Calculating Nautilus location.
We'll never get through here.
We gotta back up.
We gotta find another way.
- All right.
- (engine chokes)
- Damn it.
- You're kidding me.
Okay, we are go for launch.
- Three, two...
- (beep)
Missiles are away.
Alternator's shot.
What are we gonna do?
How are we supposed to get around this thing?
Guess we have to walk.
- What are you doing?
- What?
I've already been shot at once today.
This thing goes on for miles.
Yeah, James.
At this rate, I don't think we're gonna make it on time.
Magnetism is increasing.
Mercury is forcing the missiles off course.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's leaking gas.
- You gotta go across to the other side.
- Okay.
No.
James?
James, can you hear me?
- James.
- Victoria: James?
- Okay, go.
- Hey, Vic.
- It's me.
- Thank God.
- Are you safe?
- I am, and I'm heading away from Mercury as fast as I can.
Have you launched P-7 yet?
We can't.
Guidance system's been damaged.
Hey, honey?
I, uh...
I need you to do something.
I don't want to ask you to do this, but I need you to take the Nautilus to Project 7 and you have to guide it to Mercury.
I guess I won't be going home as fast as I thought.
It's the only chance we have, honey.
I'll do it.
Now listen to me.
You have to tether in the Nautilus guidance system to P-7's.
I understand, James.
Now we still have to do the fixes to P-7.
We have to do that at the facility.
There's really not that much time.
I'll get there in time.
- I swear to you.
- I trust you.
Go, be safe.

Hey!
Hey, hey!
Great.
- Hey, look.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, stop!
Stop!
- Get out of the road.
- We need a ride.
Look, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Listen, I need a ride to fallback facility.
Edward Rex, he gave me his ID as proof.
Just take a look... just take a look at it.
This ID was stolen this morning.
Get on the ground, Dr. Preston.
- Hey.
- (grunts)
Back off!
You heard me.
Thank you.
On the ground.
Computer:
Estimated life support, 10 minutes.
Computer: Estimated life support, five minutes.
- James: We gotta go!
- Yup.
Sorry.
Computer: Estimated life support, three minutes.
No pressure, thank you.
Here we go.
Come on, Natalie.
- (beeps)
- (sighs)
Computer:
Life-support systems back online.
We lost contact with the contingency team.
It could just be communications.

Oh, my God.
Hang on!
Computer:
Approaching destination.
Nautilus, prepare for docking at Project 7.
- Everybody all right?
- Better than the car, I guess.
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?
Brooke?!
James?
James, she's not breathing, man.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
Brooke?
Brooke, I'm so sorry.
Christopher, we gotta go.
No.
- Christopher.
- Just wait!
Brooke.
I'm sorry.
Wow.
SPEAR car.
It's Jennifer.
We're close.
We gotta get out of here.

James, can you hear me?
I don't see a facility. Are you sure we got the right coordinates?
Yeah, we're here.
The dam is camouflage.
It's also the power source for the facility.
Wow.
- Victoria: James, can you hear me?
- Okay.
- (static hissing)
- Here.
- Vic, are you all right?
- Yes, and I'm tethered to Project 7's systems.
As soon as I get the updates,
I'm ready to launch.
You have to check the targeting systems.
It'll automatically be scanning an impact threat the size of Mercury.
Oh, no.
- What's the launch window?
- If I don't get Project 7 moving,
I'll never close the gap to Mercury.
Without the updates, the shield won't work.
- Then you better hurry.
- We gotta go.
Engaging main engines.
James:
Come on!
Faster!
We gotta move!
We're almost there.
Computer:

- Christopher: Whoa, whoa!
James:
Easy, easy.
- (explosion)
- Whoa!
- Where's the control room?
- It's directly underneath the dam.
It's the only place safe enough.
Increase engines to maximum.
What are we looking for?
There it is!
- (beep)
- Computer: System error.
- Energy field inactive.
- Tell me something I don't know.
This is it.
Go.
Come on, James.
What can I do?
What do you need?
I'm gonna get the system up and running.
- Get Victoria on the radio now.
- Right.
Victoria, do you copy?
Computer: Abort maneuver.
Repeat, abort maneuver.
- Victoria: Go ahead.
- Here, I got her.
Good boy.
Vic, it's updating right now.
James, it's too late.
Hey, don't give up on me!
Hang in there, okay?
We need to go!
- James, listen.
- We need to get out of here!
Go, go!
Victoria:
Listen to me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Computer:

Hey, you okay?
Come on, get up.
We gotta go.
Get up.
Get up, now.
Computer: Warning, docking collar malfunction.
Time to go home.
Oh, my God.
Yeah!
James, you were right.
About everything.
Victoria knew what she was doing.
If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be here, right?
None of us would.
Try her.
- What?
- Try her.
- Try her.
- Yeah.
Here.
- (static hissing)
- Okay.
Vic, you there?
Vic, it's James.
Vic, you copy?
Victoria:
James, do you read?
- You made it.
- (laughs)
Looks like the world did, too.
Why don't you come on down and enjoy the view?
Victoria:
I'm already on my way.
And for the record, the view up here isn't so bad either.

Been a while since I was up here in front of you.
Maybe I'll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards.
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Yes.
And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...
I know that it's confusing.
It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.
A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
The truth is
I am Iron Man.
Ivan.
Vanya.
270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.
You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone.
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
It's good to be back.
-You missed me?
-Blow something up!
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.
I'm not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history.
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven't come across anyone who's man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
I love you, Tony!
Please, it's not about me.
It's not about you.
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.
It's about what we choose to leave behind for future generations.
And that's why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future.
It's not about us.
Therefore, what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.
And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it's all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Everything is achievable through technology.
Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.
So, from all of us here at Stark lndustries,
I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future.
Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, and will one day rid society of all its ills.
Soon, technology will affect the way you live your life every day.
No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life.
The Stark Expo. Welcome.
We are coming to you live from the kickoff of the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage.
Don't worry if you can't make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long.
And I'm gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world.
-Make sure you join me...
-All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.
-Open up, let's go.
-Hey! Nice to see you.
-All right. Thank you. I remember you.
-Tony, Tony...
Hey, hey...
-Call me.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Hello. It would be a pleasure.
-Okay.
-See you, buddy.
This is Larry.
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.
-Nice to see you.
-Call me. Call me.
-Larry King.
-Larry!
Yes, my people, my people.
Come on, Tony. There we go.
-Very mellow.
-That wasn't so bad.
No, it was perfect.
Look what we got here, the new model.
-Hey, does she come with the car?
-I certainly hope so.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-And you are?
-Marshal.
-Irish. I like it.
-Pleased to meet you, Tony.
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?
-Bedford.
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.
-Yeah? You found me.
-What are you up to later?
-Serving subpoenas.
He doesn't like to be handed things.
-Yeah, I have a peeve.
-I got it.
You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.
-Can I see a badge?
-You wanna see the badge?
He likes the badge.
-You still like it?
-Yep.
-How far are we from D.C.?
-D.C.? 250 miles.
Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.
-Yes, dear?
-Can I have your attention?
Absolutely.
Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
-I do not. I do not.
-You do not?
Well, it depends on how you define the word "weapon."
-The Iron Man weapon.
-My device does not fit that description.
Well... How would you describe it?
I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
-As?
-It's a high-tech prosthesis.
That is... That is...
That's actually the most apt description
Ican make of it.
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.
Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people
-of the United States of America.
-Well, you can forget it.
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself, which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending on what state you're in.
-You can't have it.
-Look, I'm no expert... ln prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.
I'm no expert in weapons.
We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.
You're the wonder boy.
Senator, if I may.
I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?
Your dad. Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.
We all know why we're here. ln the last six months,
Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.
And yet he insists it's a shield.
He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.
I'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain't Canada.
You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee.
Thank you.
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.
That is well said, Mr Hammer.
The committee would now like to invite
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Rhodey? What?
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.
I just...
-Drop it.
-All right, I'll drop it.
I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?
You're requesting that I read specific selections
-from my report, Senator?
-Yes, sir.
It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner. l understand.
A lot of things have changed today.
-So if you could just read...
-You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect
-the summary of my final...
-Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.
Very well.
"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,
"Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation
"and to her interests."
I did, however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.
-And that it would be in our interest...
-That's enough, Colonel.
-...to fold Mr Stark...
-That's enough.
...into the existing chain of command, Senator.
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.
We can amend the hours a little bit.
I'd like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that's connected to your report.
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images
-to the general public at this time.
-With all due respect,
Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us, we'd be very grateful.
Let's have the images.
Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark's suit.
This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground, indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.
-Now, let's see what's really going on.
-What is he doing?
If you will direct your attention to said screens... l believe that's North Korea.
Can you turn that off? Take it off.
Iran.
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?
How did Hammer get in the game?
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.
Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Wow.
Yeah, I'd say most countries, five, 10 years away.
Hammer Industries, 20.
I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived. l think we're done, is the point that he's making.
-I don't think there's any reason...
-The point is, you're welcome, I guess.
-For what?
-Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.
It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.
You want my property?
You can't have it.
But I did you a big favour.
I've successfully privatized world peace.
What more do you want? For now!
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
...you, Mr Stark. ...you, buddy.
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.
- Okay.
-You've been a delight.
My bond is with the people.
And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.
If there's one thing I've proven it's that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
Wake up. Daddy's home.
Welcome home, sir.
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.
You!
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.
I'll turn you into a wine rack.
How many ounces a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.
Check palladium levels.
Blood toxicity, 24%.
It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition.
Another core has been depleted.
God, they're running out quick.
I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.
You are running out of both time and options.
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive is also killing you.
Miss Potts is approaching.
-I recommend that you inform her...
-Mute.
Is this a joke?
-What are you thinking?
-What?
-What are you thinking?
-Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.
And you're angry about something.
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.
-Did you just donate...
-Keep your business.
...our entire modern art collection to the...
-Boy Scouts ofAmerica.
-...Boy Scouts ofAmerica?
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.
I didn't physically check the crates but, basically, yes.
And it's not "our" collection, it's my collection. No offence.
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled to say "our" collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years,
-curating that.
-It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
You know, there's only about 8,01 1things that I really need to talk to you about.
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.
The Bridgeport's already machining that part.
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're feeling better.
-Is that okay?
-That's rude.
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.
It's my primary point of concern.
-I don't know why you're...
-The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Wow. Look at that.
That's modern art. That's going up.
-You've got to be kidding.
-I'm gonna put this up right now.
-This is vital.
-Stark is in complete disarray.
-You understand that?
-No. Our stocks have never been higher.
-Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
-You are... Well, if it's messy,
-then let's double back.
-Let me give you an example.
-Let's move on to another subject.
-No, no, no, no.
You are not taking down the Barnett Newman
-and hanging that up!
-I'm not taking it down.
I'm just replacing it with this.
-Let's see what I can get going here.
-Okay, fine.
My point is, we have already awarded contracts
-to the wind farm people.
-Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."
-I'm already feeling gassy.
-And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...
-Everything was my idea.
-...and you won't make a decision.
I don't care about the liberal agenda any more.
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.
-You do it.
-I do what?
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.
-Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
-Pepper, I need you to run the company.
-Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
-You will not
-give me the information...
-I'm not asking you to try...
-...in order to...
-I'm asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
-I am trying to do it.
-Pepper, you're not listening to me!
-No, you are not listening to me.
-I'm trying to make you CEO.
Why won't you let me?
-Have you been drinking?
-Chlorophyll.
I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries, effective immediately.
Yeah, done deal. Okay?
I've actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.
And then I realised it's you. It's always been you.
I thought there'd be a legal issue, but actually I'm capable of appointing my successor.
My successor being you.
Congratulations?
-Take it, just take it.
-I don't know what to think.
Don't think. Drink.
There you go.
The notary's here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
I'm on happy time.
-Sorry.
-What the hell was that?
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.
All right, put them up. Come on.
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.
I need you to initial each box.
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...
That's it. I'm done.
-What's your name, lady?
-Rushman. Natalie Rushman.
Front and centre. Come into the church.
-No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
-If it pleases the court, which it does.
-It's no problem.
-I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.
What?
-Can you give her a lesson?
-No problem.
-Pepper.
-What?
-Who is she?
-She is from legal.
And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit
-if you keep ogling her like that.
-I need a new assistant, boss.
Yes, and I've got three excellent potential candidates.
They're lined up and ready to meet you.
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.
No, it's not.
-You ever boxed before?
-I have, yes.
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?
-How do I spell your name, Natalie?
-R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
-What, are you gonna google her now?
-I thought I was ogling her.
-Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
-You're so predictable, you know that?
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.
-Who speaks Latin?
-No one speaks Latin.
-No one speaks Latin?
-It's a dead language.
You can read Latin or you can write Latin,
-but you can't speak Latin...
-Did you model in Tokyo?
-'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
-Well...
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.
Rule number one, never take your eye off your opponent.
Oh, my God!
-Happy!
-That's what I'm talking about.
-I just slipped.
-You did?
-Yeah.
-Looks like a TKO to me.
Just... I need your impression.
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.
-I meant your fingerprint.
-Right.
-So, how are we doing?
-Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.
-You're the boss.
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?
-No.
-Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.
Thank you very much.
-I want one.
-No.
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,
-just go with it.
-Go with it? Go with what?
-Mr Stark?
-Hey.
Hello. How was your flight?
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.
We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?
-When did this happen?
-What? You made me do it.
-I made you do what?
-You quit. Smile. Look right there.
Stop acting constipated.
-Don't flare your nostrils.
-You are so predictable.
-That's the amazing thing.
-Right this way.
-You look fantastic.
-Why, thank you very much.
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?
You have a 9:30 dinner.
-Perfect. I'll be there at 11 :00.
-Absolutely.
-Is this us?
-It can be.
-Great. Make it us.
-Okay.
-Mr Musk. How are you?
-Hi, Pepper.
-Congratulations on the promotion.
-Thank you very much.
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea for an electric jet.
-You do?
-Yeah.
Then we'll make it work.
-You want a massage?
-Oh, God. No,
-I don't want a massage.
-I'll have Natalie make an...
-I don't want Natalie to do...
-Don't want you tense.
By the way, I didn't mean to spring this on you.
Thank you very much.
-Green is not your best colour.
-Oh, please.
Anthony! Is that you?
-My least favourite person on Earth.
-Hey, pal.
-Justin Hammer.
-How you doing?
You're not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.
You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.
-You guys know each other?
-Hi.
-Yes.
-Yes.
-Yes, roughly.
-We do.
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.
-I know. I know.
-Congratulations.
My editor will kill me if I don't grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
-Can I?
-Sure.
She's actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.
-Right.
-Right?
Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
And she wrote a story as well.
-It was very impressive.
-That was good.
-Very well done.
-Thank you.
-I'm gonna go wash.
-Don't leave me.
-Hey, buddy. How you doing?
-I'm all right.
-Looking gorgeous.
-Please, this is tough.
-Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
-Fromage.
-Say, "Brie."
-...that you guys have seen each other?
God, that's so awful.
Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?
Since he got his contract revoked...
-Actually, it's on hold.
-...when you were attempting to...
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"
-and "cancelled"? The truth?
-Yes, what is?
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?
The truth is, I'm actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.
-Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
-Yes?
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.
-Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
-We kid, yeah.
We kid. We're kidders.
Got any other bad ideas?
Tony!
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.
Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know?
-Everything that Tony and I do...
-Well, what's the use of having...
-...is a healthy...
-...and owning a race car...
-...competition.
-...if you don't drive it?
Is he driving?
Natalie. Natalie!
-Yes, Miss Potts?
-Did you know about this?
This is the first that I have known of it.
This... This cannot happen.
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?
-Where's Happy?
-He's waiting outside.
-Okay, get him. I need Happy.
-Right away.
Tony's... You know, he...
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
-can you excuse me just one second?
-Just read me what you wrote.
-I will. I will, after.
-Just read it back to me.
But I have to make one quick phone call.
-Where are you going?
-This is great.
-I've got some caviar coming.
-This is great stuff.
-I'll be right back.
-Look!
That's Stark.
Go, go!
Hang on.
-Give me the case.
-Here. Take it.
-Where's the key?
-It's in my pocket.
Car!
Oh, my God!
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-Were you heading for me or him?
-I was trying to scare him.
-'Cause I can't tell!
-Are you out of your mind?
-Better security.
-Get in the car right now!
I was attacked! We need better security.
-Get in the car!
-You're CEO. Better security measures.
God, it's embarrassing.
First vacation in two years.
Oh, my God!
-I got him!
-Hit him again. Hit him again.
Football.
-I got him!
-Take the case! Take it!
-Take the case!
-Give him the case!
Stop banging the car!
Calm down.
God! God!
Give me the case! Please! Come on!
You... You lose.
You lose. You lose, Stark.
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.
You could have doubled up your rotations.
You focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.
It's effective. Not very efficient.
But it's a passable knock-off.
I don't get it. A little fine tuning, you could have made a solid paycheck.
You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone right to the black market.
You look like you got friends in low places.
You come from a family of thieves and butchers.
And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history.
And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
My father. Anton Vanko.
Well, I never heard of him.
My father is the reason you're alive.
The reason I'm alive is 'cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
Did I?
If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him.
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.
The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.
Where will you be watching the world consume me from?
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.
Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die.
It's just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he's doing.
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.
I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can't exist anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to 10 years, and here we are in Monaco realising,
"These suits exist now."
Mute.
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.
-What is that?
-This is your in-flight meal.
Did you just make that?
Yeah. Where do you think I've been for three hours?
Tony, what are you not telling me?
I don't want to go home. At all.
Let's cancel my birthday party and...
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.
-Remember?
-Oh, yes.
It's a great place to
-be healthy.
-I don't think this is the right time.
We're in kind of a mess.
Yeah, but maybe that's why it's the best time.
-'Cause then we...
-Well, I think as the CEO,
I need to show up.
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
-A leave?
-A company retreat.
-A retreat? During a time like this?
-Just a ride.
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.
Hey, there he is.
There he is.
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.
Oh, goodness gracious.
Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here?
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.
I didn't want to make a first impression like this.
He's not an animal. Come on.
He's a human being. Thank you.
We're fine.
My name is Justin Hammer.
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?
-We have some salmon carpaccio.
-Salmon carpaccio.
Anything you want here, we got it.
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.
It's Italian, though.
Organic ice cream.
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.
What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody, that was... Wow!
You spoke to me with what you did.
And I know that you knew that I'd be listening.
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.
But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don't just go and try and kill the guy.
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.
That's what you kill.
You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.
The only difference between you and I is that I have resources.
I think, if I may, you need my resources.
Someone behind you, a benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.
I don't know. Have you been understanding everything I'm saying?
Very good, man.
-Very good, man.
-Very good, man.
Hey!
-Hey.
-Yes?
I want my bird.
-A bird? You want a bird?
-I want my bird.
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.
I want my bird.
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong
-despite the events in Monaco.
-Yes, of course.
-The AP wants a quote.
-Don't tell him. Fax them...
Where is he?
-He doesn't want to be disturbed.
-He's downstairs.
-...what happened in Monaco?
-Yes, but...
But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves,
"Can this man still protect us?"
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.
Query complete, sir.
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.
However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.
No further records exist.
Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now.
Listen. I've been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these.
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?
They're sick of the games.
You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.
It's not theoretical any more.
Are you listening to me?
-Are you okay?
-Let's go.
Hey, man. Hey, hey!
-You all right?
-Yeah, I should get to my desk.
-See that cigar box?
-Yeah.
It's palladium.
Is that supposed to be smoking?
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.
You had this in your body?
And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Road rash.
Thank you.
-What are you looking at?
-I'm looking at you.
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.
But you've gotta trust me.
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?
No pressure.
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.
I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production.
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.
You don't wanna do that.
You'll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.
Can we generate some encrypted pass codes?
Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.
Never mind, I...
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.
-Sorry?
-Software shit.
Well...
You're good.
You really blasted in past the firewall there.
Let me show you where you're gonna be working primarily.
Go ahead, take a look.
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?
You know, those are really just for show and tell.
They're $1 25.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.
That's where the pilot goes.
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.
I'll take care of that, just leave it.
What you want them do?
Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.
I want to make Iron Man look like an antique.
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.
You know what I'm talking about?
-I can do that. No problem.
-Yeah?
Hey, fabulous! I love it.
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.
Do you know which watch you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?
I'll give them a look.
I should cancel the party.
-Probably.
-Yeah.
-'Cause it's...
-Ill-timed.
Right, sends the wrong message.
Inappropriate.
Is that dirty enough for you?
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.
Bring them over here.
I'll take that. Why don't you...
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.
-Where are you from?
-Legal.
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically?
Bit odd.
If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Yes, sir, I understand.
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.
Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,
Iron Man will be back on watch.
Hey, Pepper.
I'm going to go get some air.
What's wrong?
-I don't know what to do.
-You gotta be kidding me.
-That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
-No, no, no. Don't call anyone.
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
I know. I know. I get it.
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?"
Just like that.
Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
I love you.
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.
And we're gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?
-You're out of control, gorgeous.
-It's time to go to bed. It's time.
-Give me another smooch.
-You're not going to be
-happy about this.
-Come on, you know you want to.
You just peed the suit.
-I know. It has a filtration system.
-It's not sexy.
You could drink that water.
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...
-If you say so.
-Okay.
I'll take this, you take that.
Pepper Potts.
She's right. The party's over.
Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago.
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it, there's the door.
Yeah!
Hit!
Pull!
I think she wants the Gallagher!
I'm only gonna say this once.
Get out.
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!
Goldstein.
Yes, Mr Stark?
Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy's ass to.
I told you to shut it down.
Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.
Really?
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.
Sidekick this!
Had enough?
-Natalie!
-Miss Potts.
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.
You know what?
Ever since you came here...
Pepper!
Get out of here. Get out of here.
You want it? Take it!
Put your hand down.
You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
We don't have to do this, Tony.
You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
-Put it down!
-You gonna take a shot?
-Put it down!
-No!
-Drop it, Tony!
-Take it.
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet...
Colonel.
Major.
Wow.
Yeah.
Let's take it inside.
Clear the area.
Sir!
I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.
No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.
-How's that working out for you?
-It's... It's... It's...
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.
Do I look at the patch or the eye?
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.
I'm not sure if you're real or if I'm having...
I am very real.
I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.
-Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
-That's not looking so good.
I've been worse.
We've secured the perimeter, but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.
-You're fired.
-That's not up to you.
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.
-Hi.
-I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
I suggest you apologise.
You've been very busy.
You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff.
You let your friend fly away with your suit.
Now, if I didn't know better...
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?
You're Iron Man and he just took it?
The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?
Is that possible?
Well, according to Mr Stark's database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
-What do you want from me?
-What do we want from you?
What do you want from me?
You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.
Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe.
I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.
Hit him.
Oh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?
Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds?
-What did she just do to me?
-What did we just do for you?
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.
Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.
I've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.
I've tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
Well, I'm here to tell you, you haven't tried them all.
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.
Candygram.
I brought you something.
Oh, yeah.
We got you the bird, pal.
This is not my bird.
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.
This is a great bird.
-It's a beautiful bird.
-We got this all the way from Russia.
Hey, man, this not my bird.
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.
I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things.
Learn to let go.
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?
Ivan... What's this? Jack.
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.
How... How are you supposed to get a head in there?
-Jack, could you put your head in there?
-No.
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there.
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?
-Drone better.
-What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.
You said, "No problem."
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.
Like Iron Man. You understand?
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.
Hey, man.
Don't get too attached to things.
Learn to let go.
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.
Unbelievable.
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.
-It's functional?
-Fully mission-capable.
Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.
Sir?
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.
We'd like this to introduce it.
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.
-We've got to make this happen.
-Yes, General, but...
It's also an order.
Yes, sir.
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.
Thank you, sir.
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
No, it was finished.
It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my...
No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater.
He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.
He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.
When your father found out, he had him deported.
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver, they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
You told me I hadn't tried everything.
What do you mean I haven't tried everything? What haven't I tried?
He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
He said that?
Are you that guy? Are you?
'Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
I don't know where you get your information, but he wasn't my biggest fan.
What do you remember about your dad?
He was cold, he was calculating.
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me, so it's a little tough for me to digest when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
That's not true.
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What?
-I got a 2:00.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-What's this?
-Okay, you're good, right?
-No, I'm not good.
-You got this? Right? Right?
Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact.
-You remember Agent Coulson, right?
-Yeah.
And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you.
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.
Good luck.
Please.
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.
If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean,
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that'd be nice.
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises.
If you attempt to leave or play any games,
I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet.
-Okay?
-I think I got it, yeah.
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.
Think this is the power source?
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Is it my birthday?
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?
-Is this what I think it is?
-Yes, it is.
Hammer, I want to know what you're gonna do for us.
What am I going to do for you?
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you is I'm gonna upgrade your software.
-And then, second, I think I should...
-That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about firepower.
Well, you're talking to the right guy.
Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.
Too downtown? I agree.
M24 shotgun, pump action.
Five-round magazine.
You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.
They do make something better than waffles.
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't disco enough for you, so I'm gonna put it right here.
You're looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.
You're tough.
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.
Don't let anyone tell you different.
This is an M1 34 7.62 Minigun.
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho, or Puff the Magic Dragon.
Okay.
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.
It's capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted.
If it were any smarter, it would write a book.
A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon.
It would read it to you.
This is my Eiffel Tower.
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird.
My Pietà.
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.
It's capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero.
I call it the Ex-Wife.
That's the best I got.
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.
-You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
-I think I'll take it.
-Which one?
-All of it.
All of it.
Everything is achievable through technology.
Better living, robust health and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.
I'm Howard Stark, and everything you'll need for the future can be found right here.
City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...
I'm Howard Stark, and everything you'll need in the future can be found right here.
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,
I would like to personally...
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?
Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.
Where's your mother? Maria?
Go on. Go, go, go, go.
All right, I think we got...
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...
Are you waiting on me?
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,
I'd like to personally show you my ass.
I'd like to... I can't... This is...
I can't... We have this, don't we?
This is a ridiculous way...
Everything is achievable through technology.
Tony?
You're too young to understand this right now, so I thought
I would put it on film for you.
I built this for you.
And someday you'll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.
This is the key to the future.
I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day you'll figure this out.
And when you do, you will change the world.
What is and always will be my greatest creation is you.
-$6. Six.
-I don't have any dough.
-Here.
-No, sir, that's too much.
No, it's fine. Take that.
-It's fine.
-No, señor.
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.
If you just drop that there, that'd be great.
-Are you Iron Man?
-Sometimes.
We believe in you.
It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
-Miss Potts?
-Relax.
-Mr Stark...
-Is here.
-He refuses...
-I don't. It's fine.
-I'll just be a second.
-Listen, it's our position that Stark has and continues to maintain proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.
When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,
-he was making a promise to America.
-No, the suit belongs to us.
We trusted that he would look out for us.
-Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
-He obviously did not.
-And now we learn that his secretary...
-Yes, it does.
...a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark lndustries.
What are her qualifications?
-No.
-Ms Potts is doing nothing to manage this terrible...
-Mute.
-No...
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.
Don't tell me that we have the best patent laWyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.
I'll get this stuff out of here.
Well, then, tell the President to sign an order.
We'll talk about it at the Expo.
Hammer's giving some presentation tomorrow evening.
-Will Tony Stark be there?
-Will I?
-No, he will not. Bye.
-I would like to be.
-Got a minute?
-No.
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.
I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I'm not.
-You didn't come here to apologise?
-Look, that goes without saying, and I'm working on that.
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good.
Can I move this? This is crazy.
It's like a Ferris wheel going.
-I'm trying to get some...
-No.
Do you know how short life is?
And if I never got to express...
And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.
-I'm just gonna say it.
-Let me stop you right here, okay?
Because if you say "I" one more time,
I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.
I am trying to run a company.
-Do you have any idea what that entails?
-Yes.
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared, and all I'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it.
I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.
Did you bring me strawberries?
Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?
Allergic to strawberries.
This is progress, Pepper.
I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
-I need you...
-I need you, too.
-...to leave now.
-That's what I'm trying to...
Ms Potts?
-Hi, come on in.
-Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Thank you.
-Anything else, boss?
-I'm good, Hap.
No, I'll be just...another minute.
I lost both the kids in the divorce.
No.
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?
I thought you two didn't get along.
-No. That's not so.
-It's just me you don't care for.
-No? Nothing?
-Actually, while you're here, maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.
Absolutely.
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Boy, you're good.
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?
It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.
You're good.
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?
I need a manipulatable projection.
1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
How many buildings are there?
Am I to include the Belgian waffle stands?
That was rhetorical. Just show me.
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.
In which case the nucleus would be here.
Highlight the unisphere.
-Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
-What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?
I'm discovering... Correction.
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.
Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.
Parking lots, exits, entrances.
Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework.
Dad.
Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.
The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Thanks, Dad.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.
-I heard you broke the perimeter.
-Yeah.
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?
-I was doing some stuff.
-Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Coulson, you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.
Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
What's this doing here?
That's it.
-Bring that to me.
-You know what this is?
It's exactly what I need to make this work.
Lift the coil.
Go, go. Put your knees into it.
There you go. And...
Drop it. Drop it.
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
-Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
-So I'm told.
-Secret stuff?
-Something like that.
-Good luck.
-Bye.
-Thanks.
-We need you.
-Yeah, more than you know.
-Not that much.
Initialising prismatic accelerator.
Approaching maximum power.
That was easy.
Congratulations, sir.
You have created a new element.
Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core.
I will begin running diagnostics.
Hey, Ivan.
I got Senator Stern here.
Thought we'd swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
The drone is not going to be ready.
Not ready? What do you mean?
I can make presentation, not demonstration.
What the hell is the difference?
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.
-I can make salute.
-You can make salute?
What do you mean, "make salute"?
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?
You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.
-Hey, man, everything will be okay.
-This is not what I wanted.
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.
Hey!
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.
And his shoes. Take his shoes.
I took your stuff.
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!
We had a contract.
I saved your life and you give me suits.
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.
Something really, really great fell into my lap.
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.
And now your overpriced paperweights are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!
I'm gonna leave now.
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement.
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man.
You got that?
Maybe you can watch me on TV.
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me.
-You know I don't...
-Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?
Hey, Tony, how you doing?
-I double cycle.
-You what?
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
You, too.
-Trace him.
-Sir.
Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.
Jarvis, where is he?
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.
What your father did to my family over 40 years,
I will do to you in 40 minutes.
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.
Tri-State area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
I hope you're ready.
Call trace incomplete.
-Sir...
-You want to run some tests, run them.
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.
-We are unclear as to the effects...
-I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.
That tastes like coconut.
And metal.
Oh, wow, yeah!
I'll keep the car down here, all right?
Thank you, Happy.
...Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm's way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us.
Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach.
That's not fair. That's not right.
-And it's just too bad.
-Oh, Lord.
Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed headlines the world over.
Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a different problem.
They are about to run out of ink.
Get that out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military.
The Hammer drone.
Army!
Navy!
Air Force!
Marines!
Yeah!
That's a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.
But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
What?
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...
We got trouble.
Tony, there are civilians present.
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.
Give them a wave.
Hey, all right. Yeah.
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.
You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.
Vanko's alive?
Yeah.
Where is he?
-What?
-Where's Vanko?
-Who?
-Tell me.
What are you doing here, man?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Is that you?
-No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!
Get out of here. Go! This whole system's been compromised.
Let's take it outside.
No. No!
-Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
-Yes, sir.
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.
-On what?
-On you.
Tony, on your six!
-What's going on? What's happening?
-The software's been overridden.
What? What do you mean it's been overridden?
-What does that mean?
-I think he slaved the drones.
That's impossible.
-Call the guards.
-All the phones are down, sir.
Well, then call their... Call their cells.
Their cell phones are not working, either, sir.
He's locked us out of the mainframe.
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?
Please, please, go away. Go away.
-I've got this handled.
-Have you now?
Yes, I do.
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up, this wouldn't be happening.
So please, now go away. Thank you.
Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here.
What?
You tell me who's behind this.
-Who's behind this?
-Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
-Where is he?
-He's at my facility.
-I need NYPD, please.
-No, no, no!
-Command Central.
-No, no, honey.
-Don't call the authorities.
-Okay. Right away. Right away.
Step aside. Step aside.
Tell me everything you know. Go.
-How are we doing, Jarvis?
-Remote reboot unsuccessful.
This way.
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.
-I'm not taking you anywhere.
-Fine. You want me to drive?
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.
Nice work, kid.
-You got multiples coming in on you.
-Let's get this away from the Expo.
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.
-Watch the road.
-I got it. I got it.
Listen, listen.
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.
Got it.
I'm closing on you.
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.
-Stay in the car.
-I'm not staying in the car.
I said, stay in the car.
What are you wearing?
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.
You want to help? Keep the car running.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.
Hold on. Hey!
Each set of drones is communicating
-in its own unique language.
-Well, choose one and focus on that.
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
We got it. We're on our way.
I got him!
-Rhodey, you still locked on?
-Yeah.
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.
Wait, wait, wait!
He's gone.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.
What's your 20?
-What are you doing?
-I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.
Tony!
Reboot complete.
You got your best friend back.
-Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
-Well done with the new chest piece.
I am reading significantly higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?
Is that you? No, I'm not.
-Not any more.
-What's going on?
I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?
-You didn't let me.
-Why didn't you tell me that?
I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.
Looks like the fight's coming to you.
-Great. Pepper?
-Are you okay now?
I am fine. Don't be mad.
-I will formally apologise...
-I am mad!
...when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
-Fine.
-We could have been in Venice.
Oh, please.
Rhodes?
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
You okay?
Yeah, thanks.
-Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
-Don't be.
No. I should have trusted you more.
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?
Well, we want to take the high ground, okay?
So let's put the biggest gun up on that ridge.
Got you.
-Where do you want to be?
-Where are you going?
-What're you talking about?
-I meant me.
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.
-Tony, don't be jealous.
-No. It's subtle,
-all the bells and whistles.
-Yeah.
-It's called being a badass.
-Fine.
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.
-See that?
-Yeah, yeah, nice.
Rhodey?
Get down.
Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.
I told you that five minutes ago.
That's your guy here.
-Excuse me?
-You're being placed under arrest.
-Are you kidding me?
-Hands behind your back, sir.
I'm trying to help here.
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?
That's good. That's good.
You're starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition.
I like that. You think you're making a problem for me?
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again real soon.
When they get here,
I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.
We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.
Yeah. Are you coming with us?
-No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
-Okay.
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.
The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Good to be back.
This ain't gonna be good.
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
With the what?
-Hammer tech?
-Yeah.
I got this.
Rhodes. I got an idea.
-You want to be a hero?
-What?
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.
-This is your idea?
-Yep.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!
Take it.
You lose.
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.
Pepper?
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.
-You can't?
-I can't take this.
-Look at me.
-My body, literally, cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself or wreck the whole company.
I think I did okay.
I quit. I'm resigning.
That's it.
What did you just say? You're done?
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.
-You don't have to make any excuses.
-I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.
You actually were just making excuses.
-But you don't have to.
-No, I wasn't making an excuse.
-I'm actually very justified.
-Listen. Hey, hey.
-You deserve better.
-Well...
You've taken such good care of me.
I've been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so...
Right?
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
-Thank you for understanding.
-Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.
-I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
-Okay. What about the press?
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna seem...
-Well, with you it's like dog years.
-I know.
I mean, it's like the Presidency...
Weird.
-No, it's not weird.
-It's okay, right?
-Yeah.
-Run that by me again.
I think it was weird.
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
-I had just quit, actually.
-Yeah, so we're not...
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.
-You should get lost.
-I was here first. Get a roof.
-I thought you were out of one-liners.
-That's the last one.
-You kicked ass back there, by the way.
-Thank you. You, too.
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?
Not okay. Not okay with that.
It wasn't a question.
How are you gonna resign if I don't accept?
I don't think I want you looking at that.
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.
Now this, on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.
Read it.
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour."
In my own defence, that was last week.
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.
I mean, please. And aren't we all?
"Textbook narcissism"?
Agreed.
Okay, here it is.
"Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."
-I gotta think about it.
-Read on.
"Tony Stark not...
"Not recommended"?
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you approve me but not approve me?
I got a new ticker.
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.
Which leads us to believe at this juncture we'd only like to use you as a consultant.
You can't afford me.
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour.
Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
I'll see what I can do.
It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure.
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel, for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.
-You deserve this.
-Thank you, sir.
Mr Stark.
Thank you for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.
You deserve this.
Oh, sorry.
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?
Let's get a photo.
Sir, we've found it.
YEAR 2018
LIBERTY MOON MISSION
Liberty, this is control.
Requesting lunar orbit status.
Control, this is Liberty.

Approaching Terminator line.
Roger that. Be advised, radio static on the com. 
Roger that.
7-10 plus VGX, landing window is up.
Landing vector approved...
Engage the bay.
- Landing is confirmed, Liberty.
- Approaching to coordinate Delta.
 VGC 7-3-11.
Looking good. Landing vector optimum.
Touch down in t-minus 12...

 Now lets, uh, drop the banners.
  Oh, fu...
Must we?
 - The Eagle has landed, baby.
- Please, keep that fool off the main frequency.
 Are you getting a reading there, Sanders?
Mission control, I can confirm vast quantities of Helium-3.
 - The reading are stronger this way.
- What? You breaking up...
Please be advices you may be nearing meteor shower...
Adjust communicate... frequency...
No fucking way!
Hey, Sand, what you doin' with that thing hopping around over there?
I thought you were supposed to take some photos of me?
- Washington, have you got a visual on...
- What was that, Houston?
- Hey, Washington, it's Helium-3.
- What?
It's a Helium-3 mine.
Get over here!
Hey, there's something over here you need to see!
No! Sanders!
Sanders! San...ah!
Oh, God!
 Houston, Houston!Son-of-a-bitch.
I need to get out of here.
I must be trippin'.

Sieg Heil, Moon youth führer,
Renate Richter.
Heil Hitler.
Boys and girls, please sit down.
Dieter, don't you know where to put your behind?
Miss. Richter, since Mondführer's
65th birthday te appropriate salute has been
"Heil Kortzfleisch!"
You're such an exemplary boy.
Today we'll start with the most unpatriotic language.
It's the language we unfortunately need to know when we return to those who need our help.
In english now.
Where are we from?
- Siegfried!
- The Earth.
And, when did we leave?
- Brunhilda?
- And where did we go?
- The dark side of the moon.
Brilliant!
Attention!
The National Anthem.
- Heil Hitler!
- Hitler...
- What's that, Mr. Adler?
- A spy from the earth.
I captured him myself.
He seems to he the leader of the shock troops.
Mr. Adler, is this a joke?
I'll be damned!
The White House
Washington D. C.
Don't try to play dumb with me.
It was your bad idea to send those idiots to the moon?
- Talk about disaster. - I'm not to be contrarian madam President but I'm pretty sure it was your idea.
It was my great idea if have they succeeded.
Now it's your stupid idea, got it?
I didn't hire you for stupid ideas.
I hired you because of your Midas touch.
Now my approval ratings are in the toilet and the election is just weeks...
You dropped the ball, Vivian!
You!
Now, I need a miracle.
Get me a miracle!
Actually, how was sending those two astronauts to the Moon, supposed to getting me re-elected?
Exactly?
We haven't been to the Moon for 50 years.
One of them was black.
Thought it would look good.
Look good how?
Like I said, one of them was black.
Just think of the opportunity we wasted years ago with that errand boy, Powell, Alan Powell?
- Colin Powell.
- That was close.
- And where're you going?
- The UN, to do my job.
"The Great Dictator" by Charlie Chaplin.
It's one of the world most famous short films.
Which illustrates in just 10 minutes, his wish that one day, the entire world that will be held in the great Führer's wise and gentle hands.
- Any questions?
- I have a question.
My sweetheart.
Mr. Adler.
In my classroom we are here to strictly formal manner in addressing one another.
To what do we owe the honor of this visit?
Mr. Nachrichten übermittlungs-
Oberführer Adler?
We captured an earthling.
Your expertise is required.
- What's for lunch today?
- Sauerkraut.
Again! Please say that's not true!
Does the Fuhrer eat Sauerkraut
3 times a week as well?
No, no no!
I love me some sauerkraut.
And Volkswagen.
Huh...Fahrvergnügen.
Hey! German words, right?
You know, it's as if, where I come from we speak German too. You know what I'm sayin'?
Damn! You gonna be sorry you did that white boy.
Capture him! No!
Capture him!
Do not shoot!
The fugitive is a male negro, unarmed, but possibly angry.
How does he look like?
Where does he come from?
What is he wearing?
How do I look?
Like they say in English... you are a knock-out.
How do I get out of here?
Thanks lady.
Have a nice day.
No, Mr. Subhuman.
That is the air lock...
No!
No!
You might wanna... cover up a bit.
All good?
Klaus! Don't shoot.
We need him for tests...
No, no, no! I would not do if I was you.
Listen to me. Listen to me!
I know a lot of important people.
They're very important people.
I even know the President of the United States of America.
Now...if you kill me, then that's just a really fucked-up situation.
You know the president of the
United States of the Americas?
- Take him to Dr. Richter's laboratory!
- By your command!
Thanks, homie.
I talk to you later baby.
Question, what is this apparatus?
Look man, how would I know?
I'm just model.
- A model what? Citizen?
- No man, a model model.
Damn, what's wrong with you two?
Blind or something?
-Shit, I'm pretty.
-Are you part of the shock troops
- before the invasion?
- Invasion? Man, you all must be tripping?
What is your mission?
Look dude, I just follow the paycheck, you know what I'm saying?
-What is this device?
-That's my kick-ass cellphone
-and a computer.
-What?
That's not a computer.
This is a computer.
No man. That's ancient history, homie.
Dumb negro.
- He talks nonsense.
- It might be a dialect.
- Probable reason is the skin color.
- Right.
His brain structure is different from us Aryans.
Let's open up his skull and measure the brain.
No, I need to know why he's here.
You have 24 hours, Doctor.
Otherwise I have to rely on an ancient infallible technique.
Pain.
UNITED WORLD CONFEDERACY,
NEW YORK
I am telling you once again.
One moment we received conformation that the ship has landed successfully on the moon.
The next, all communications stopped.
- As though it had simply vanished.
- Or you're hiding something from us?
Yeah, we are hiding something on the dark side of the moon.
I still find it very difficult to believe that the entire purpose of the mission was to promote your president's re-election.
Well believe what you like, we had mere senators spend hundred-of-million on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit post.
But Mr. Secretary, the expenses involve this time only makes sense if there was a military purpose.
Okay, let's get this clear.
The United State has no military activity on the Moon.
What about natural resources activity?
We know how the U.S. sometimes mixes the two up.
Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium-3 up there?
Helium-3? You just made that up, didn't you?
That's so silly.
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HQ,
NY
I assume these are just preliminary idea?
Sir, we have a very small delivery window.
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.
Ma'am, and this is all.
Anyone who is not the head of the department, should leave.
You idiots!
You morons!
That's an insult to morons.
What is this shit?
I have a meeting with the President of the United fucking States of the America tomorrow fucking morning!
Not the President of fucking Zambia!
Not the President of the fucking Janitor's Union!
But with the president of the fucking country which you just happen to be living in at the fucking moment!
You pieces of hellacious shit!
What am I supposed to tell her?
That my employees are not intelligent enough, to be fucking morons?
- Mr. Adler.
- Call me Klaus.
- May I?
- Of course.
I've come to discuss our legal union.
- Is that a marriage proposal?
- There's no need for marriage.
I received the confirmation of the Department of Racial Purity.
Our genetic match is 97%.
How romantic.
Science demands us to unite physically.
It's our destiny to produce perfect offspring for the people.
What about my scientific research?
One day, Renate... all this will be ours.
But first, I must conquer the Earth.
Wolfgang, that old fart, stands in my way.
In the way of final victory.
The two of us will take on an enormous responsibility.
Your place is, Renate, by my side.
Gentlemen!
Battleship Götterdämmerung.
Our miracle weapon that has been under development for 40 years.
The dream of our beloved Führer.
But unfortunately only a dream, until now.
- Please Doctor.
- Watch this!
This tiny device has over a 1000 times more computing power than our biggest computers together.
I engineered this cable to connect this machine with our main computer.
I call this Universal
Systematic Binding USB for short.
This will lift it into the air.
Finally, the Götterdämmerung will fly!
- Yes.
- Yes.
You saw it!
You saw it with your own eyes!
Mein Führer, please let me return to the Earth.
Let me get more of these devices.
No one has ever returned.
I will return.
We don't have a choice if we want to prevent an invasion from the Earth.
Are you willing to work with the Führer...
in the name of the fatherland, stand behind the Wehrmacht.
This decision does not resolve all of us ...
Thank you.
I thought my ears were gonna bleed.
You're welcome.
May I ask what's your name is?
Washington,
James Washington.
- What's yours?
- Renate Richter.
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Washington.
James Washington.
What's wrong with your skin?
Come on now, please. You have never met a brother before, right?
- No, I'm an only child.
- No, no, I didn't mean like that.
I meant a black man.
No, and this continues to confuse me because you are much blacker when I first encountered you.
Okay girl look, either I'm black or you're blind.
Look, what is going to happen to me?
I mean, what's with this, this guy that keeps sticking needles in me?
- What about that other angry dude?
- My father's sticking needles into you?
That's freaking scientist guy?
That's your dad?
And what about, you know....?
Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs
-Oberführer Adler?
-I'm sorry, what?
- Klaus Adler.
He's going to be the next fuhrer.
And my husband.
What? You lose a bet or something? I mean.... you are...lucky you.
Actually, lucky him.
- I shouldn't even be here.
- You cannot leave me tied up like this.
- Please do me a favor.
- What?
- Play a Nazi
- And what, if I don't?
- They will eliminate you.
- Oh great!
Is there a different radio station?
With the upcoming war ...
- He's back.
- Looks good.
This will solve our little problem.
Okay, mini Mengele.
Hey man, I don't like the look of this.
I am coming.
Looks very good.
And now we just...
- Why do not you take me with you?
- Don't worry, darling.
After I complete my mission,
I come back to you.
That's not what I mean.
I'm an Earthologist!
I know everything about it.
You need me.
You sweet little thing, where do you get all those crazy ideas?
Books, mostly... and some films.
I shall return triumphant!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Kortzfleisch!
- Get it through your skull.
- Of course, mein Führer.
We have one more ace up our sleeve.
Show him what we have.
Voila, gentlemen!
- Doctor.
- Watch closely.
Heil!
Stand up, you fool.
Sieg Heil!
With the prisoner now being one of us, we will go down to Earth.
He will help us to find more telephone computers. We return.
And then get the
Götterdämmerung flying.
Oberführer Adler,
I hope you've discussed my return to the Earth.
Something along those lines.
The Reich trusts you.
- Thank you, doctor.Take care of your daughter for me. - Yes.
Sieg Heil!
See you in Valhalla.
UPSTATE,  NEW YORK
- You smell that?
- No. We don’t have time to waste.
Take me to that president of yours.
What? The President?
Come on man, I thought you want me to take you to Mac store or something.
You said that you would know the President of The United States of the Americas.
Right, of course.
That President.
May I meet this President too?
Renate! What are you doing here?
Hey, Miss. Richter, welcome to my planet.
This is not the place for the mother of the children of the future Führer.
And definitely not the place for a woman.
My place is by my man.
- Get the hell out of my property.
- We better get out of here!
Run for it!
New York City
A Volkswagen bus.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, hold on there Boss man.
That may not be the sharpest move.
Look, look. I'll tell you what.
Let me go talk to the brothers. All right?
They know me, you know. I'm one of them.
Are you with me?
Yeah! Yeah!
Now you're talking.
All right, now.
Wassup?
- Doesn't he know?
- No. He'll be thrilled.
I'm serious. You don't know how good it's to see you all man.  It's like...
- little Africa up in this bitch.
- Thank you.
Come on people. You all know me.
I know you do.
- Washington.
- I mean ...
That ain't one of yours, is it?
Because...ah, look man.
You ain't got to bring that shit out.
Look man, it's all good.
Look, I'm a peace loving brother, man.
Fuck it, man!
Yo! Yo!
Are you all right?
Do I fucking look alright to you
Miss crazy fucking Nazi?
I mean...
What the hell just happen?
You know?
Oh, no mother-effin way!
What did you sick sons-a-bitches do to me?
- I should've told you. - What?
That I look like a fucking polar bear?
You know what? You two really, really know how to fuck up a guys Christmas.
Quiet, you fool!
What is wrong with you?
We made you Aryan, you're one of us now.
- You should be thanking us.
- Thanking you?
What I should have done is let those brother come here with their size 15s and put a foot so far up in your ass, can taste the toe nails for 2 fucking weeks.
Klaus!
Bring me to your leader,
James Washington.
Hey, what the fuck?
Excuse me.
Get your fucking hands off me, you mother...
- You can...- Is she your boss?
- Yes, she's the big cheese.
- And she knows the president?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They real tight.
Come on.
You fuckin' animal!
Do you know who I am, huh? Do you?
You just kidnapped the wrong woman
The wrong fucking woman.
Oh yeah. I hope you're having a good time
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.
Excellent.
My turn.
I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich
We are based on the Moon.
I'm told you know the president of the United States of the Americas.
You will take us to that the President, because ...
- I have a very special present for him.
- Him?
Well he'll love that.
He just loves presents.
As soon as my mission is accomplished
Nazi invading forces will be called in under my directions and we will end the good times for the bad people.
And just how do you propose to do that?
- We will simply eliminate them.
- What?
- Sorry, that is not what we were told...
- Renate, I do not think that you...
Yeah. Why not?
Why don't you tell this fräulein why we're here, just like you keep telling your pupils.
I would love to do that.
You see... the National Socialist Party is the people's party, nothing more.
We wish to return to Earth with our message of peace and unity love through virtue.
And kindness, for example.
We are healthy, in mind and body.
Our spirits are brave and true.
We achieved that because we are strong, disciplined in our cause.
There is simply no belief that can match ours... because peace and unity is the gift that we bring to all mankind.
- What you and all earthlings need to know ...
- Yeah, yeah. I get it.
This is good.
This is gonna work.
You, I need.
And you...
I want.
Alright, let's go meet the president.
Madam President ... here is the miracle you asked for.
- Who is this man?
- He will lead the campaign troops.
Renate, please...
It's very simple.
The world is sick... and we are the doctors.
The world has anemic and we are the vitamin.
The world is weary, but we are the strength.
We are here to make the world healthy once again.
With hard work... with honesty, with clarity, with decency.
We are the product of loving mothers and brave fathers.
We are the embodiment of love and bravery.
We are the gift of both
God and science.
We are the answer to the question.
We are the promise delivered to all mankind.
For that we raise our hand, to one nation.
We step to the beat of one drum
We march to the beat of one heart on this world.
We are the people who will carry the children on our shoulders.
In the same way as our fathers carried us and their fathers before them.
We are the one people united and strong.
We are the one people with certainty.
Moral certainty.
We are invincible and we have no fear.
Because the truth makes us one.
THREE MONTHS LATER
The moon Nazis are coming. What's wrong with you people, can't you see?
Look, I've been there.
I'm telling you.
They have all this moon base, they got this whole like space thing goin' on, and they comin' to take over.
Oh, you never listen to this right?
Listen now 'cause they comin, they comin'.
They coming to get us all. Why aren't you guys listening to me? I mean...
Renate.
Washington.
James Washington.
- I'm so glad to see you alive.
- Is that you? 
Yeah!
Look I got one! This is the bitch that made me white as a fuckin' snowflake.
Come on people, help me!
Help me!
I saved your life.
So, you're a formerly dead, black model... who is now suddenly a living white hobo after spending a weekend on the Moon. Is that correct?
- Yes, that's correct.
- Huh, so I was listening.
And you're Neil Armstrong after his sex change operation. Is this correct?
No, that is not correct.
You were not listening at all.
My name is Richter.
Renate Richter.
I tried to save this man's life and
I think he's stupid, childish and ungrateful.
Okay. Ask Miss. Moon-Nazi here, was I, or was I not on the dark side of the Moon.
Yes, Mr. James Washington was on the dark side of the Moon.
There, what did I tell you.
I am black, but now I'm white. I went to the dark side of the moon, but I'm now back.
And the Nazis are coming to kill us all.
And you guys are gonna so sorry that you didn't listened to me.
Mr. James Washington, why are you so upset? So angry?
- Get lost.
- But I don't understand.
I mean...we made you white.
We taught you about National Socialists message, about peace and unity.
You people have robbed me of everything.
My race, my identity, my career.
And I'm beginning to think I am flipping mind too. I mean just everything.
Do you know this?
Yes.
Wonderful.
Come on.
Come on in. I will explain it to you then you'll understand it.
You're a one strange broad.
I'll give you that.
You know, you'll pay the popcorn.
125 MINUTES LATER
Man, that was bullshit.
It was...
- It was so long.
- Yeah. They coulda edited it down a bit.
He was mocking the Führer.
I'm getting a sense there's a lot about Nazis you don't know.
- But I am a Nazi.
- Yeah, I know but you are not like...
Well like them.
A bunch of stupid bullies.
No, I'm sure they're good boys and loyal to the Reich, and their mothers.
Look, they are wearing the symbol of love.
- The swastika?
- Yeah.
I have never heard they call it that before.
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
- Good evening, boys.
- What have we there?
What we got here, blond hair, blue eyes, nice rack.
Even Hitler would get a hard-on.
- I got this. Look guys, we don't want any trouble. - Why don't you get lost hobo.
Look, I got the funniest story to tell you.
Your not gonna believe this...
Stop that, that is enough.
What she needs is a good war.
A war always make the president popular.
Well, I might be able to help her out there.
How do you mean?
One word from me, and the invasion from the Moon begins.
- You never break character do you?
- No.
I can never be broken.
- You smell so good.
- The time has come.
I will show you my plans.
Come back here.
Look, look.
I've mapped out some things.
Oh, big fella.
All work and no play?
Now listen, do you think if I asphyxiate the president... will the troops stand in line with us?
When I order the moon invasion. it will be quietless bloodshed
After I eliminate the Moon Führer, of course.
Klaus Adler.
Heil Hitler!
You name's not 'Hitler!
So Klaus, is the clown joining us?
What, did you all buy tickets?
Okay, so, do you want to introduce me to your friends?
Get your hooks off me you crystal noob piece-of-shit!
I can make this worth your while.
Just please let me go.
Do it, Moon Corporal.
And you want to eliminate the Mondführer?
Do you know the penalty for high treason?
This is flagship Siegfried speaking.
We've reached the orbit and we're ready for the Valkyries to start.
Battleship Heinrich ready for attack.
Battleship Biterolf ready for attack.
- The fleet is ready, mein Führer.
- Excellent.
They have to wait for my return.
We shall then begin the Meteorblitzkrieg.
We'll wipe all these sub-humans... off the face of the Earth.
Klaus!
I need to tell you that I have nothing to do with you or your plans.
You Nazi-piece-of-shit.
Oh well.
A blessing in disguise.
Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke.
Farewell, puppet Führer.
He fell for the old one last blow job offer.
God, nazis are stupid.
I commend you on your marksmanship.
Shame. She was such a nice girl
Just have to kill her later.
So, it was real?
- All this time.
- Never doubt a Nazi, schöne fräulein.
Farwell, fashionista.
I have a planet to conquer.
I will just grab this.
Bye!
Good luck with the rest of your life.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
They develop like ordinary women.
But look.
Here, no hair, no hair.
Like little girls.
And when they do have hair, it looks like... the mustache of our great Führer.
The pictures kind of turn me on.
Sieg Heil!
Mr. Adler.
Where is the Führer?
The Führer is dead.
Long live the new Führer.
That's me, in case you're wondering.
Sieg Heil!
This way.
Klaus!
Heil Hitler!
From now on, of course it is "Heil Adler".
Time is the sin.
I'll see you in Valhalla.
At 5.45 we'll start firing back.
Every bomb will be retaliated.
The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin!
Thank you, Kelly. Moments ago
New York has been under attack.
Witness claim to have seen hundred of UFO's appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire.
Billy get that! Get that!
Are you getting that?
Kelly, the craft is at least 60 feet across.
I'm seeing what appears to be weapons of some-kind dangling down from the bottom.
Oh my God! It's opening fire!
It's opening fire!
I'm getting the hell out of here.
There is little information.
But here's what we know at this time.
- Ok you see the thing is, that Klaus...
- I know it was you doing.
- It's wonderful.
- It's wonderful?
It's brilliant. I'm a wartime president now.
All presidents who start a war in their first term always get re-elected, I thought, I was gonna have to bomb Australia or something.
But no, you bring me real...
- Who are these guys anyway?
- Nazis.
- From the moon.
- Real life Nazis?
Holy shit, this just keeps getting better and better.
You are a miracle worker babe.
They are the only guys we ever actually managed to beat in a fair fight?
I'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Only, you know, I'm not spastic.
I knew you would be excited.
So, if you’re our Roosevelt, then who's your
General Patton or you know, MacArthur?
Mr Secretary of Defense, do you have any thought on this?
Send her.
- Me?
- Hey you're the miracle worker.
Apparently you dodge bullets too.
- I wouldn't know... - What to wear?
You will think of something, you always do.
Madam President... ready to face the music?
It's the space Nazis!
Take us upstate.
We need to go back to the Moon.
We? No, no, no! See?
We rhymes with me.
- And ain't going.
- Than, you don't get it!
They have the Götterdämmerung on the Moon.
I don't give a damn what they have.
- I'm not going back, to that place. No way!
- You want to look like that for the rest of your life?
Great, now this is my fault.
- Let me in.
- I am no hero, James.
I need you.
Do you know how to drive this thing?
Well can't be any different than playing 'wing commander'
Let's try...
I swear we do not have nothing on the Moon.
- Japan?
- It is not ours.
- China?
- It is not us.
It's bloody well not ours.
- I confess.
- Yes, North Korea? Confess to what?
The spaceships are ours.
Our beloved leader designed and build it himself.
- What's so funny?
- All right, North Korea. Sit down.
- So, it was you India, I knew that.
- No, no! This is a sign of peace.
- This is the sign of peace.
- Just cut it out, you morons!
These thugs are Nazis and I mean the real, McCoy.
They have been hiding on the Moon just waiting to pounce.
My question is, what do you all planning to do about it?
'Cause we just happen to have a little something up our own sleeve.
And I'm sure that you'll be thankful for it.
May I present to you with the Mars exploration ship, The USS George W. Bush.
Good work, take it to Officer Tyler, please.
This is trajectory, what's our status on the orbit window?
Commander on deck.
The hostile fleet has launched a full scale aerial attack against the United States.
These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they are operating fully within the thermosphere.
Each of them approximately carrying 200 enemy vessels, and are extremely...
Hell hath no fury, Heir Adler.
Alright kiddies, let's get this show on the road.
Vivian, you look great.
How is it going up there?
Madam President, I couldn't be better.
I am packing dozens of mega tons of nuclear warheads which I am going to carefully place up Klaus's kraut ass.
- Just as soon I get him in my sight.
- Carry on, kick butt.
Let's see what that baby can do!
Working at optimum capacity.
Ammo consumption within tolerance.
We're coming under extremely heavy fire.
We gonna need reinforcement right now.
What the hell is the meaning of this?
Good day mates. This is Australian ship,
Dundee 01. Ready to kick ass.
Spitfire reporting in.
Hanging in there W.
Canada joining the battle.
This is a direct violation of this nations space treaty that you all signed, every single one of you.
MIR is ready to join the battle.
That was supposed to be destroyed.
This is an outrage, you're all liars, just like my ex ex-husband.
- Calm down lady, calm down.
- Don't you lady me, Pinko.
Okay, who didn't armed their spaceship?
Great, great. That's just great
- You all gave me your word.
- But you broke yours.
We always break ours, that's just what we do.
Okay, fine, fine, fine!
Let just beat shit out of these pricks and talk about the details later.
Heroes of the First Fleet, continue your attack to the last man and remember you're fighting for the Reich!
Where the hell did they come from?
Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer.
The Fatherland is calling its children!
This device will complete the biggest war machine of all times.
- The Götterdämmerung will fly!
- Heil Adler!
This is beautiful.
- Where the hell are we going?
- To the Götterdämmerung.
I think Klaus will be there.
What did you think of that?
Adler?
Alright, what about this
Moon business?
What do you say we head on over and slap them around a bit?
Klaus, baby I'm coming to get to get ya'.
Attention!
Heil Adler!
Heil!
As you were.
Well?
The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes.
- Are your troops ready?
- We're waiting for Dr. Richter.
- What the hell is this place?
- This is the Götterdämmerung.
It will liberate the Earth.
Actually, it is the biggest war machine ever created by man.
- This is the bridge. There's where I'm going.
- I need to find your father, so...
- Where do you think he at?
- I think you will find him over there.
Try to sneak in, and please paralyze the engines.
- Or otherwise the earth is destroyed.
- Note to self, paralyze the engines. Got it.
- Oh. No, no no no. - What?
- You be careful.
- I mean you know...
- What?
- Because you like me.
- Right...
Oh, come on, a little.
I mean...
You like me?
We have a visual on the
Nazi fortress, commander.
Obvious and overstated as usually,Klaus.
Alright, everyone, let's get those nukes in action.
- I'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone.
- But Commander,there are woman and children down there.
The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists.
- Prime warhead on secondary armament.
- Roger that.
- Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment.- Fire the fucking nukes!
Nukes away.
Job well done!
Move!
Who dares disturb me?
Dr. Richter!
-  How much time do you need?
-  The Götterdämmerung will fly.
It will be ready for  the final victory.
Cut the crap.
How long?
Let's say three months, give or take a little.
Maybe a little earlier, maybe later.
You have three minutes.
He cut me off. It's not that easy.
Russia wasn't conquered in a day...
Hey, quack!
You remember me?
No.
The Moon spook you turn into a snowflake.
Start the Helium-3 engines.
Now!
Start the engines.
Oh shit, it's alive
He sure  must have the smallest dick in the universe.
Load the cannons.
Time... to fuck back.
Everyone, take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire.
- Offensive run confirmed.
- Let her rip.
Shit!
- Are the cannon ready to fire?
- They are.
But the Earth is below the horizon, on the other side of the Moon.
We can't shoot.
Full moon was yesterday.
Let's make a brand new horizon.
Fire at will.
What the fuck?
Reactivate the system.
Weapons sergeant.
We'll see...
The projectiles of Götterdämmerung are made out of metallic hydrogen. it's aggregate state can only be reached under immense pressure...
National Anthem.
For motivation, break glass.
The impact can be quite diverse.
It's no time to sing now!
It's a false alarm!
Are you all imbeciles?
Go and see what's going on!
On the double!
- Renate.
- I won't let you do it.
What will you do?
Shoot me?
Good girl...
Renate Richter, my bride-to-be.
You destroyed something beautiful, something wonderful.
A future world full of Aryan children.
Our Aryan children!
But you betrayed me, and for that you shall pay.
Your beauty should adorn/ decorate Odin's table.
- Klaus! Wait! Let me say something.
- Now?
- I'm a bit busy.
- I have always respected you.
As Führer, and as a man.
I've even loved you.
I belong to you.
To you.
Cute little speech.
But it is too late, my dear.
Goodbye.
I understand.
I heil you.
My Klaus.
Sieg Heil, my Führer.
- Washington, do you hear me? Washington?
- Where are you?
- You need to shut down the engine
- I'm working on it.
Shit...
Congratulations.
High five.
Well, that was disappointing.
Do you think he suffered?
Even just a little?
Vivian, I knew you could do it. You're foxy and salacious, all the way. Congratulations.
- What's Helium-3?
- Helium.
Did you say Helium-3?
Yes, there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of this stuff.
- That's ours.
- It is? Why?
Helium-3, will make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for next thousand years.
Yes, it is ours.
No, no no. Hear me out.
Hear me out.
The moon is American soil.
Moon flag, stars and stripes.
Who beat the Moon Nazis?
We did.
Well, yeah yeah, alright, you help out here and there, but ultimately it's just like World War II ... and who won that?
We did.
- You lie.
- You don't believe me?
Watch the movie.
Movies do not lie.
Not the shoes, Jesus.
Vivian, this is the Secretary of Defense.
- Defend Helium-3 at all costs.
- But against who?
Against everybody!
Please don't, never again!
Please stop.
What was the Earth like?
Different.
When can we go there?
Soon. Soon...
- But how?
- In peace.
Unfortunately that's the story of revenge. It's messy.
Never really works out the way you wanted to.
I feel lonely.
The eternal love of God, the love of God into our hearts, or we will burn... burn in hell, burning in eternal damnation.
Renate.
Washington.
You are alive.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
And you're the way you meant to be.
Are you aware that you are kissing a black man?
I guess you have a lot of work cut out for you.

WOMB (2010) CD-2/2
Come and give me a hand Tommy.
It's your party after all.
Hi.
Molly, it's Rebecca. I just wanted to make sure you got the invitation?
But he...
I see.
Happy birthday, Tommy.
- But the others aren't...
- There'll just be the two of us, my love.
Two?
But why?
- The others aren't coming.
- Why aren't they coming?
Because of the copy?
But we didn't invite the copy, we didn't invite her on purpose.
Why aren't they coming mom?
Please?
- Mom!
- Because the mothers...
Their mothers were not allowed.
Why not?
- Because they are stupid.
- Stupid?
Where we going, Mom?
This is exactly how I imagined it.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
Cool, it's like the end of the world.
Mom?
Come quickly.
I thought they were extinct long ago.
Can I take one home?
Home?
That's where we are, Tommy.
Tommy?
I'm back.
You can look.
- Cool!
- What are you gonna call him?
I don't know.
Bingo?
Bingo?
No.
Booboo.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thanks, Mom.
Hi, I'm Mark.
We are neighbors.
- Can I see in your binoculars?
- Sure.
Come on.
And you there when Father died?
Yes.
- How did it happen?
- What made you think of it now?
I do not know.
You know, it was an accident.
What sort of accident?
We were on the road, we stopped, he got out of the car...
- ...and another car hit him.
- What sort of car?
Van, Tommy, coming very fast.
- What sort of van?
- I do not know.
Why did you stop?
- Why did you stop?
- I had to pee.
Now I can do whatever I want with you.
Go ahead.
Tommy?
Tommy?
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Tommy!
Everything will be alright my love.
Good morning!
Mom...
Good morning!
Weird. I was in university...
...I was a rusty tin...
...or not even a tin, but some kind of container.
I moved to creak, as the old job.
When I lent down, this rusty sort of liquid flow through my mouth.
It was cool.
Good morning!
Mom, this is Monica.
Monica, mom.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What did you dream about?
Nothing.
Enjoy.
Did we wake you when we came in last night?
- I wasn't asleep.
- But it was dawn.
Did you ever sleep, Mom?
Sometimes.
Monica went out for couple of things, she'll be back soon.
She'll be living here for a while, I mean of course only if you don't mind.
Mom?
She is a nice girl.
Pleased to have her here.
...after thought?
I love thinking about this.
Imagine great snow storms over the oceans, in the mountains, deep in the clouds... for millions of years on this planet,
...billions of tiny snow crystals have been whirling about...
...and no two of the are same.
Just like us in fact.
- As people?
- Yeah, as two.
I was thinking of all living things, not just our faces and our fingerprints. villus in our lungs, our irises, the structure of our brains...
...and nails, you know, everything about us.
I mean, think about, how long the birds here?
They came not long after dinasours.
Basicly, way before us. Can you imagine, how many billions of feathers they produce...
From ostrich to terns, to hummingbirds, from penguins
Everywhere in the world.
It must be an orbital thing.
A billion times of billion times of billion, you know...
There are no two alike.
This is a duck's feather.
It's almost incomprehensible, billions of amazingly complex patterns...
...permanently whirling around us and never repeat themselves.
What's the matter?
I don't know Tommy...
This is so...
...so immature.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
So?
- So what?
- Do you like kids?
Come in.
Hi Mom.
Smells great, doesn't it?
Monica baked it, I was the kitchen boy.
- He is a very good kitchen boy.
- Thank you very much.
Thanks.
- I'm not hungry now, I'll have it later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Good night!
I don't think she's been up for the day.
- I think you should talk to her.
- And what shall I say it?
Mom?
It's you.
Wait.
- Hang on.
- Why?
I have to take a shower.
Let's take one together.
Tommy, don't.
No, no!
No.
Stop it.
- Wait.
- What? What's wrong?
I think she woke up.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Hello.
Can I help you?
Go inside now Tommy.
Who are you?
Who is that, Mom?
Mom.
Who was that woman, Mom?
Tommy?
Tommy?
I know her.
Tommy?
Let me in, please.
You've been in there for hours.
Please, open the door.
I'm leaving.
Mom?
Mom?
I have to tell you something.
I was nine,
I was on the beach...
It was so cold.
- Then I met this boy?
- What, what, what boy?
What beach? Who cares?
Who is this woman, Mother?
No! No!
No!
I'm scared.
I do not know who you are.
Or who I am either.
Who are you, Mom?
Who are you?
Why did you do it?
Why did you do this thing?
- Look at yourself, Tommy, you're here.
- So? So? So?
What am I supposed to do now?
What am I supposed to do with this fucking life of mine?
Don't you see I have no idea who I am!
Can't you understand?
- What more could you want?
- More than what?
You're here, Tommy.
You're alive
Take your hands off me.
Take your hands off me.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Thank you...
...Rebecca.

DEATH RACE-2 (2010)
Hey, are you gooks almost done?
Faggot.
- You are big motherfucker, yes?
- Yeah.
Just moments ago, a full-scale riot broke out at Terminal Island Penitentiary.
As far as I can tell, there has been no action taken by Terminal Island Prison correction officers.
Lock down the bridge, keep the tower guards.
I want everyone else down here now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Of course I'm serious!
Patch me live right fucking now!
Either you take me live or I tell your wife everything.
You got that, right?
What a shit match.
I would never have bet if I knew Spiro was injured.
- But you did, huh?
- Yeah. Take your winnings.
The whole world's falling apart, and Manchester United with it.
When I came over here, that clip was the first thing I ever bought with my own money, you know?
So, you take care of it. You look after it.
Look at you, profiting off football.
He's never watched a match in his life.
That's 'cause it's fucking boring, that's why.
The world's greatest game.
I think it's the third world's greatest game, right?
What the fuck are you laughing at?
Excuse us, please.
About the bank, it's important to me.
I know it is.
That's why I want to handle it my way, with my guys.
Well, Vinnie brought me this score.
My stipulation is that you're in charge, which is the way I want it.
- Can I count on you?
- What do you think?
Yeah.
I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green, but what my nephew lacks in experience, he makes up for with enthusiasm.
Exactly what I'm worried about.
Look, he fucks up, Mr. Kane, he answers to me, okay?
It's going to be all right, Luke. Trust me.
Always do.
I know you do.
Come on. I've got something to show you.
What do you think?
This is for me?
- You don't like it?
- I think it's beautiful.
I just think, maybe, you know, based on the kind of work I do, you don't think it's a bit orange?
- You don't fucking like it.
- Are you kidding me?
She's stunning.
I just wonder, you think I might stand out in this thing?
No, the more obvious you are, the less suspicious you appear.
So, like, hiding in plain sight kind of thing.
Precisely.
Okay.
Don't fuck it up.
Thank you both for coming.
Mr. Weyland, I'm not exactly sure why she's here, but I know why I am, sir. I've failed you and I've disgraced the corporation.
Relax.
I'm surprised those animals don't kill each other with more regularity.
You're both here because this incident has created a public relations nightmare for me.
Was something I said funny?
Well, you had a 48 share.
Your network's previous high was a seven.
What you call a nightmare
I'd call a wet dream.
Mr. Weyland, I know that the network isn't your prime moneymaker.
But I can't believe that you don't realise what a gold mine you're sitting on.
Humour me, Miss Jones.
People are tired of fake violence and fights staged by Vegas promoters.
The hatred that your inmates have is pure. Can't be duplicated.
You're calling what happened today entertainment?
Ah!
What exactly do you have in mind?
VINNIE: No, seriously, I gotta tell you, this motherfucker's never carried a gun in 20 years working for my uncle.
- That right, Luke?
Vinnie, pay attention.
You got 60 seconds. You get in, you get out.
- No one gets hurt.
- We know. Don't worry.
We got company. Get out of there.
Vinnie, you copy?
VINNIE: Don't worry about it, man.
Don't stress out.
Look, abort. Get out of there.
- Chill, man.
Jonesy, abort. Abort. Get out of there.
- It's under control.
- Fuck.
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!
Freeze!
- Freeze!
- What the fuck?
Hey!
Fucking idiot!
Twenty years and nobody got hurt.
You. Dumb fuck.
We're leaving now! Move!
- Shit!
- Fuck!
- Shit! God damn it!
- Go, go, go, man!
Come on, let's move!
Fuck this, then.
What are you looking at? Stop!
You're crazy!
- Move!
- OFFICER: Freeze!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go. Go, go, go, go!
- Get in the fucking car, Vinnie.
- Right.
- Move!
- Gotta go!
VINNIE: What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You're going to get us fucking killed, like Terry.
The only motherfucker that got Terry killed was you. Fucking relax!
We're gonna blast our way through.
No one's getting blasted, you fucking understand me?
They're gaining on us.
Luke, fuck, I ain't getting pinched.
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck was that for?
- Fuck you.
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Make a choice.
- Fuck.
Your uncle is family.
It's the only fucking reason you guys are walking from this. Get out.
Get out the fucking car!
Chefs from Season 1 are back for redemption.
...and it appears there's even more...
...bank robbery suspect is caught red-handed...
Well, that's still yet to be confirmed, I'm afraid, Ron, as busy King Street is starting to get back to normal right now.
Just a few hours ago, it was the scene of high tension as gunfire rang...
Ofthe foursuspects, one has been identified as Carl Lucas, who is a known associate
- of alleged crime boss Markus Kane.
- Fuck!
- We will now take you live downtown...
- Fucking hell!
Fuck!
OFFICER 1: Stay where you are!
OFFICER 2: Hands up!
Take a last look at the mainland, boys.
You ain't gonna see her again once we cross this bridge.
Bridges.
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest,
38-and-a-half kilometres long, followed by Donghai Bridge,
32-and-a-half kilometres long.
- The King Fahd Causeway comes in third.
- Fucking mumbling, stuttering bastard.
- Could you shut the fuck up?
- Leave him alone.
Prattling on every 10 minutes.
- I'm getting sick and fucking tired of you.
- He's scared.
What do you care?
I don't.
All right! Let's move!
Get out! Get out!
Move! Come on, move!
Get out here! Get out here!
Get the fuck off me.
OFFICER: Come on, get out. Come on now.
I will not testify. Never.
The DA's gonna pull his offer, Luke.
Kane'll walk away scot-free, and you'll go away for life.
You see, I'm not gonna testify against Markus Kane.
Not for immunity, not for money, not for anything.
We have some good news, Mr. Kane.
We found Luke.
- He's on the Island.
- That is good news.
Always knew I could trust that guy.
I told you. No way would he betray me.
Have him taken out.
You're joking, right?
So far, he hasn't played ball with the feds.
He's in for life. What happens after a month of hard time, eh?
After a couple of them African apes have a go at him.
How long do you think he's gonna stay loyal then?
You know, it's a shame,
'cause I love that guy like a brother.
Anything else?
No, sir.
- What else do you want on this?
- It's perfect.
- Yeah? Here, then.
- Thank you.
Fuck you!
The average Death Match fight garners a 50 share.
It peaked two months ago at 62, but has been on the decline since.
The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill, with a death count of 19, followed by 14K,
- who, coincidentally, has 14 kills.
- Great, man.
Someone did their homework, right?
- Is that him?
- Yeah.
LISTS: That's September Jones.
Former Miss Universe.
Was stripped of her crown after allegations of a sexual relationship with all five judges.
Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting as a weather girl, is now the host and executive producer of Death Match.
She grew a...
You have a list pretty much ready to go on anything, don't you?
Live from Terminal Island, television's most violent, most disturbing, and most watched programme in human history.
Welcome to Death Match.
Our first fighter, a murderer serving four consecutive life sentences,
Xander Grady!
Xander,
11 kills, one submission.
6'4", 220 pounds.
His opponent, leader of the Terminal Island Triads, he currently ranks second on the kill board, he was Interpol's third most wanted until his arrest in Los Angeles last year,
14K!
14K one submission, 14 kills.
5'11 ", 159 pounds.
The combatants are picked by lottery randomly each week.
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.
There are several pressure plates that, when activated, can give a fighter access to a variety of weapons.
But they only have 10 seconds to access them.
If no fighter has won, both fighters are killed.
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.
You're number one!
Yo, baby, you're my number one!
Chinese bastard!
Something's not right.
What're you talking about?
Die!
14K! 14K! 14K! 14K!
You want it? Huh?
Let go, man!
I will never give up!
- He quit!
- No!
Another fucking submission!
He quit!
-14K! 14K!
Tonight's winner,
14K!
Death Match is a trademark of Weyland International.
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.
Exactly what the fuck do you think you are doing?
You are done.
Done!
Lights out!
Hey, baby.
The numbers from the overnights are in.
What do I pay you for?
The ratings are down again. This time, 20%.
Now, you better reverse the trend, or I'll find someone who can.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. Now, you make my motherfucking money. You understand me?
LISTS: It's a strict Triad code.
Whoever spills the blood of a Triad, they're sworn to take that person's life.
Xander killed a Triad last match.
It defies logic why he wouldn't kill him if he had the chance.
Hey, kid,
I'm not looking for a best friend, okay?
So, just leave me alone.
Carl Lucas.
- Chill. Chill, man.
Relax.
You've been assigned to our work detail.
That's Rocco,
I'm Goldberg.
- Goldberg, huh?
- Yeah.
What are you, like, the...
You, like, the last Mexican Jew, or what?
Yeah. I killed all the rest.
Okay. So, this work detail, what are we looking at?
And don't tell me we're washing underwear.
No.
- I don't care what you're into.
I'm not washing anybody's underwear.
On your feet, Lucas. Warden wants you.
That'll be all.
Carl Lucas, arrested 22 times over a span of 20 years.
But nothing ever stuck, not a single damn one.
You just slipped through the cracks.
Well, I shot a cop.
Those cracks, they fill up pretty fast.
They sure do. Yeah.
Now, at first I didn't realise who you were.
Really? So, who am I?
Well, an idiot, and soon a dead man.
DA offers you a talk-and-walk, and you turn him down?
Is that why you got me here?
No, it's not. I'm here to warn you.
- Save your breath.
- Oh, don't get smart with me.
I don't know how many others know who you are, but when the word gets out, the killers are gonna be coming out of the woodwork.
Is that right?
And mark my words,
Markus Kane will not show you the same type of loyalty that you've shown him.
Look, 14K kills Xander, he makes him a martyr. That's like an honour.
Xander quits, shames himself and the entire brotherhood.
That makes him like a pussy.
You got him, guys?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
I got a question. All these cars, man, it's not exactly prison norm.
What's the deal?
Hey, Terminal Island is not about rehabilitation. You know what I mean?
It's a business.
All these cars, we melt them down, make weapons, guns, shells.
If it kills, we make it.
Hey, are you telling me the government's paying top dollar for this recycled shit?
Top dollar?
Who said anything about top dollar?
Weyland International sells this stuff dirt-cheap.
Yeah, when you're not paying for labour, your prices can afford to be a little lower, you know what I mean?
They're making money off our blood.
- What do you know about these wheels?
- A little bit.
- How does she run?
- Why don't you see what she's got?
- For real?
- For real.
Why not?
Someone's been driving a getaway car!
God damn, you put some magic in this thing.
- How does she handle?
- Just the way she's supposed to.
Who was driving that car?
- What car?
- What car?
Hey, Luke, you a fighter?
I got no reason to fight anyone.
Hey, reasons don't mean shit in this place.
The Calendar's always looking for new blood, and you look like just her type.
Good to know.
Some advice, blend in.
Don't give her no reason to fixate on you.
Hey, Goldberg, I'm the last guy looking for a fucking spotlight.
- Hey!
- Hey!
OFFICER: Stay back! Stay back!
Everybody else stay back!
I don't want you in there. Move back.
All of you, stay back! Let's go! Move back!
- What's going on here?
- Big guy tripped.
- That so, Bill?
- Yeah, I tripped.
That's what he says.
All right, let's go! Keep it moving!
Come on, move!
Get moving! Move! Move!
Who's the little guy?
- His name's Lists.
- Lists?
You'll work it out.
You ever hear of a computer?
You're, like, a century behind everyone.
I'm surprised I don't find an abacus in here.
- What are you doing in my office?
- I'm here for him.
Carl Lucas.
Even the name gives me a hard-on.
The judge called him a monster at his trial.
He's perfect.
- I can sell him.
- You can't have him.
- I wasn't asking your permission.
- Wait. There's more to it.
DA thinks there's a chance that he could turn state witness against Markus Kane.
Now, you put him on your TV show, not only could those animals kill him, but basically, he just advertises to Kane where the chief witness against him sleeps, and then he's a dead man.
Mr. Lucas' problem, not mine.
Warden Parks, you and your prison exist for one reason, to facilitate Death Match.
And here I thought we were here to protect society and punish criminals.
Then you're dumber than I thought.
Give us a minute.
Would you like a towel?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'll say.
Very impressive.
And your fight with Big Bill yesterday, also impressive.
- I don't think we've met. I'm...
- Yeah, I know who you are.
Save the sales pitch, huh?
I'm not fighting.
If I want you to fight, you fight.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
I can't do anything about the life sentences, but you participate, and I will make your life here much more tolerable.
Your own cell, no work detail, real food, as well as plenty of
- perks.
- Okay.
So, I...
I win some fights for you, you need another guy to beat me.
I mean, that's...
That's how it works, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, go sell sleazy someplace else,
'cause I ain't buying.
- You won't leave me any choice.
- Do what you gotta do.
I'm not gonna be a part of your freak show.
We'll see.
Hey.
You don't hear the word "no" so often, do you?
Only when I say it.
Dim the lights, the carnage is about to begin.
Good evening, and welcome to Death Match.
Two men will be randomly selected live, right before your eyes.
Only the winner walks out alive.
Are there any fighters in here tonight?
I need one more.
No! No!
This is fucking bullshit.
Welcome to Death Match.
Hey! Hey, lady. Okay, you made your point.
- Switch us up.
- Oh, so now you wanna fight?
Fucking right. They're gonna kill him in there, you know that.
Yeah, I certainly hope so.
The name of the game is Death Match.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Hey! Get your fucking hands...
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.
There are several pressure plates that, when activated, can give a fighter access to a variety of weapons.
And this week, we have a new weapon that will blow your mind.
Come on!
Fuck him up, Bill!
Come on! Come on!
Mother...
Motherfucker's crazy!
But cool.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I want on the floor. Can you help?
LISTS: Get him, Luke!
LISTS: Watch out!
Watch out!
Get the fuck out of here! Go!
Don't look good for our boy.
LISTS: This way! This way! Come on!
The door, Luke! The door!
This is some bullshit! This game is rigged!
Barbecue his white ass!
Yo, the white boy's cheating!
- Fucking cracker's cheating!
- Fuck you, you nigger!
- You piece of shit!
- Watch out!
BIG BILL: Come on!
Come on! Let's get in there!
Come on, come on! Go, go! Get out there!
I told you.
Switch!
Go, go, go!
Get the fuck over here!
Come on! Come on!
Get back.
LISTS: Watch out, Luke!
Get ready to scream, bitch!
Fuck you!
- Who's screaming now, bitch?
Code red, arena stage.
- End transmission now.
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Shut it down.
- No way. This is my show.
And this is my prison.
End this broadcast now or you're gonna be one of the cons instead ofjust filming them.
Got it.
Death Match is a trademark of Weyland International.
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.
OFFICER: Get on the ground!
Luke!
OFFICER: Come on, get on the bus!
You wanna live? Stay down.
Wasn't that Luke?
What?
Fuck!
Get me the phone!
Fuck.
Just relax, huh? Just relax.
Won't hurt a bit. Relax.
Any closer, buddy...
You're really lucky, or this would have hit the femoral artery.
- Yeah, that's me. Lucky.
- Yeah. You can say that.
Man!
- Just relax. Relax.
It's a minor setback.
A few rapists and murderers died. Boo-hoo.
No. This is the end.
You messed it up by pulling the plug.
We would've won the night.
You're not good enough in bed to win this one.
Sweet dreams.
OFFICER: Come on, over here.
Fuck.
OFFICER: Sit down there and shut up.
- OFFICER: Quiet down.
- Hey.
What happened?
You're not the only one that got in some good shots.
- I know.
All right, ladies! Line it up!
The bus is leaving.
Don't make me tell you twice!
- Hey.
- OFFICER: Let's go.
- Thanks, huh?
- OFFICER: Step through, ladies!
Yeah. I don't know why I did it.
Probably get thrown in the hole for that.
Then why?
Why did you help that con?
Wasn't gonna let the man fight my fight.
OFFICER: Right this way. Let's go.
You got a name?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Of course I do.
Come on, man.
There he is.
How the fuck is he still alive?
Boss, we've been assured it's happening.
It's been happening for weeks now.
How much longer do you think he's gonna stay silent?
He's a tough guy, and he's been loyal...
I want him dead!
We have someone on the inside, a total psycho.
- It won't take long now.
- Joey. Joey.
The box, with its implications of rigidity and squareness, symbolises unimaginative thinking and painful frustration.
Sometimes we just have to step back, see if the solutions to our problem lies outside the box.
Call a meeting.
- With who?
- Everyone!
- You didn't return my calls.
- I don't return a lot of calls.
I wanna discuss Death Match.
I think that we should pull the plug.
When a real-life riot doesn't generate a second-hour boost,
- I'd say it's time to cut your loss.
- Exactly. We need to evolve.
We've developed a strong base, we have legitimate TV stars...
The board's decision is final, Miss Jones.
In the past six months, I'm the only profitable thing about this company.
Unless you want a sexual harassment suit crammed down your throat, you will listen to what I have to say.
Fine.
9:00 a. m. tomorrow.
I'm troubled.
What seemed to be a very simple task has taken the most perplexing of turns.
So I'm gonna speak slowly, clearly, so my message is not lost, or ignored, or misinterpreted.
One million dollars to the man who kills Carl Lucas.
This offer expires in 48 hours, and if that happens,
I will consider you all enemies, and I will bring war on your fucking head.
Understand?
Ninety percent of Terminal Island, your grand investment, is dead space.
Death Match merely stayed your execution.
If you wanna get a breath of fresh air, you need a bold initiative.
I propose a race.
Wicked. Epic.
Something like no one has ever seen before.
The track will run the length of Terminal Island along some of the narrowest and most harrowing paths that the racing world has to offer.
The best part of it, everything that we need is right in our own backyard.
We're gonna modify each vehicle, adding reinforced steel plating, bulletproof glass, and roll cages to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.
We'll take everything that made Death Match a hit, combine it with everything we have at our disposal.
Such as?
Heavy fucking artillery.
Every car will hold as many guns and as much ammunition as it can.
So, you're going to arm the prisoners.
Precautions will be made to make sure they can only shoot at people on the track.
Nine cars, three days,
20,000 rounds of ammunition.
Going from fighting to racing, that's a big leap.
We need a hook.
Something that incorporates the two better.
Now, in a game show, no one cares about the game. The game's arbitrary.
People care about the risk and the money.
Now, we've been concentrating on the game, not the risk.
That's why our audience is bored.
Let's concentrate on the prize.
A prize more valuable than money.
Okay. What's more valuable than money?
Life is a more valuable prize than money.
In our deal with the state, we control sentencing.
That means we control their life.
So if a prisoner wins five races, he gets his freedom.
No matter what he's in for, robbery, rape, homicide, whatever, he wins his freedom.
He wins his life.
You have life, freedom.
Stop.
Death Race.
You know what?
That's fucking bullshit, Rocco.
Well, how do you know, man?
Maybe it's for real.
Are you kidding me?
You think they're gonna let murderers and rapists out of this place, ever?
Hey, Luke's right.
And besides that, homes, you don't drive worth a shit.
You know what? Fucking blow me.
Fucking faggot.
That would be the only chance I have of getting out.
And what would you do, Lists, if you got out?
Start over.
Welcome to Death Race.
Terminal Island Penitentiary hosts three days of the ultimate in auto carnage.
Day one of the race begins in 10 minutes, and will be brought to you without commercial interruption by Weyland International.
Your safety is our top priority.
Get ready. The show's about to begin.
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.
Welcome to day one of Death Race.
Before you, 18 cons vie for their freedom.
They must survive all three laps in order to proceed to day two.
Their first challenge?
There are only nine cars.
That's right, gentlemen. Nine cars!
Three, two, one, go!
This is what I'm talking about!
Mine!
This just keeps getting better and better!
- Hey, baby.
- How about a bit v rodet?
Oh, baby, yeah!
Don't think so!
Why did you let that con beat you?
- Shit!
- Hang on!
- Fuck!
- Hey, why do I need this?
- You mind helping me out with this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Who am I talking to?
- To talk to your pit team.
- Pit team?
Luke! Good to have you, man.
So, you got your guns, your oil, your smoke, and your napalm here.
- Get your eyes on the road.
- Let's race.
Luke! Goldberg.
Yeah. The Mexican Jew's here to save your bony white ass.
Now, swords and shields don't play until the second lap.
You've got the fastest car out there, except the Porsche.
And don't go head-to-head with that Ram, or he'll have you for lunch.
Son of a bitch!
Looks like we're already on the menu.
Eat this.
You feel me, baby?
- BIG BILL: Now I got you, baby!
- Is that all you got, pretty boy?
Careful of the one on the right!
Good to know.
- Yeah! That's my man!
- Yes!
- Where is he? Where is he?
- To the left.
Xander Grady.
Come on!
Get it going!
Fucking Chinese bastard! I'll kill you!
Shit! Bastard!
Motherfucker!
That was a great lap, Luke, but now you need to get to a sword plate, and fast.
Activate swords, shields and death heads.
Sword pressure plates activated.
Shield pressure plates activated.
You gotta find a sword, Luke.
You gotta find a sword plate.
That's right. Get back to work.
There's one!
- I see it.
- Go for it. Go for it!
Sword pressure plate activated.
HILLBILLY: Yeah!
How do you like that one, boy?
What the hell is he doing?
- Oh, jeez!
- Guns! Guns!
Eat my lead, boy! Eat my lead!
Get down! Now!
- Hey, get out of there!
Get down!
How's it feel, boy?
You gotta turn here!
I'm working on it.
Hang on.
God! Oh, God, no!
Yeah!
- Ooh, yeah!
That was close.
Stock car racing got its start during Prohibition with moonshine runners fleeing federal agents.
Bill France Sr. conceived NASCAR in 1947 during a meeting in Daytona, Florida.
"Lists. " I get it now.
Shield pressure plates activated.
Motherfucker.
- Get a close-up on that.
Camera two, move to your left.
Where did he go? Huh?
Where did he go?
You ain't escaping me now.
A million dollars. It's gonna be mine.
What did he just say?
Replay that for me.
BIG BILL: A million dollars.
It's gonna be mine.
I'll take care of it.
Take the wheel.
Take that, bitch.
Think you're special?
No!
No! No!
No!
One lap to go, Luke. This is it.
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
- Damn it!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!
Enough of this shit.
- What the hell?
- Hang on.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.
Yeah! All right! All right!
Bullshit, motherfucker!
That's it. That's it.
Sword pressure plate activated.
Not that one!
Did you just drop our fucking tombstone?
Yeah, my bad.
Not good.
What you doing?
- What you doing?
- Drive, pretty boy.
"Pretty boy. "
God damn this fucking car!
Hang on!
Take this, you asshole!
- Eat that!
- Fuck!
- Hang on!
- KATRINA: You're going down!
That's nice work.
Talk to me!
Now you're going down!
Sweet!
I guess I lucked out, then.
Nice.
- Guess we put that magic to work, Goldberg.
- Well, bravo!
Come on, Luke! Yeah!
The debut of Death Race is in the books.
CarI Lucas is the surprise winner, followed by Big Bill, Calin, Apache,
Xander and 14K.
Can CarI Lucas hold on to win his freedom?
Tune in tomorrow to find out.
Yeah! Yeah!
- Man! You can drive, man!
- What a rush, old man.
Hey, Goldberg, you kidding me?
Hey, where'd you learn that?
- I was a Girl Scout.
- Really?
- I'm gonna get you, fucker!
Is that right?
You don't mess with somebody in this motherfucking race!
- Is that a fucking date?
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Come on! Fucking pretty boy!
- Gonna fucking blow up your ass!
Come on, suck my dick, bitch!
Hey, Lists, go kick his ass. Come on.
Tomorrow, you die.
Katrina! Let's go.
- Hey, so I get to see you tomorrow, or what?
- If you're lucky.
Damn.
Hey, come on, snap out of it, guys.
Hey, Lists, you gotta fix it up there under here.
Right here. Right in here.
OFFICER 1: Come on, Lucas, let's go.
OFFICER 2: You heard him. Move.
Hey, what did I do?
OFFICER 3: Go to sleep!
Hey, this is bullshit!
Okay, what did I do?
You won!
To the victor belongs the spoils.
Okay, so what does that mean?
What is this?
In ancient Rome, the winning gladiator was the recipient of gifts.
A show of gratitude from the powers that be for a job well done.
She's yours.
Mmm-hmm.
Do with her what you please.
Is that right?
And who the fuck are you?
I'm Caesar.
You know, they're probably watching.
Mmm-hmm.
Listening, too, I guess.
Some kind of game they're playing.
Yeah, probably betting on what we'll do next.
Option A, they're trying to get us closer so they can use one of us against the other.
Uh-huh.
Option B being, maybe, put a wedge between us, so we fuck up on the track?
I guess we do what they want, and leave the bullshit for later.
You playing me?
Does it matter?
No.
Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas, and all the bangers are going for it.
Put Mr. Lucas in solitary.
I thought this was a prison thing, but this is too big for even the guards to resist.
- You still gonna let him race?
- Oh, yeah.
They're free to kill him on the track, just not off camera.
What about him?
Wait! Wait!
Come on. Let's go.
You had your fun. Move.
- KATRINA: Where are we going?
- Shut up.
KATRINA: What the fuck is this?
Beautiful view of freedom from here, Katrina.
KATRINA: Okay.
But who are you?
You're much more attractive in person.
I'm flattered. What do you want?
Carl Lucas. I want him dead.
And in return, I offer you freedom.
A chance of life outside these walls for one simple task.
You've got 48 hours.
You kill him or I kill you.
Let me make these walls disappear.
Let me make you part of the view from outside, Katrina.
Freedom.
Forty-eight hours.
Tick-tock.
- Yeah?
Sixty-five share.
Well done, young lady.
It's truly for the best.
You weren't happy, the board wasn't happy.
We need someone for this institution that shares the common vision.
Just wasn't you.
Warden Parks, we're here to escort you from the premises.
"Whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein. "
Proverb 26:27.
Is that supposed to be deep?
Hopefully deep enough that, when you fall, you'll break your fucking neck.
- What do you want?
- Time to race.
You got a big fucking bulls-eye on your back, Luke.
You feel all those eyes on you?
Ain't 'cause you're pretty, or because you're in first place.
Markus Kane put a million dollars on your head.
It's a monster fucking bounty, Lucas.
It's as plain as day.
I don't believe it.
Why would I lie?
It makes no fucking sense.
What're you gonna do?
Two, one, and we're in.
Welcome to Death Race.
Eighteen men started. Only six remain.
An estimated 50 million people watched CarI Lucas win day one.
Can he do it again?
Five other racers will have something to say about that.
Welcome to day two of Death Race.
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.
Hey! Aren't you twojust bubbling over with sunshine this morning?
Come on. We got a race to win.
What is it?
Nothing.
Let's race.
I've got you now, motherfucker!
Coming up behind you!
KATRINA: Watch out!
Yeah! I just fucked your ass!
Activate swords and shields.
Sword plate activated.
- Damn!
- KATRINA: Watch your back!
- Careful.
Here comes the guns.
You gotta find a shield, man.
You gotta find a shield!
- There's one!
- I see it.
Go for it. Go for it!
Shield pressure plate activated.
- Throw the smoke!
- No, not yet.
Luke, what're you waiting for?
Okay, ready?
Pull it now!
Smoke, now.
Let's get this car back in the race.
Fuck!
Yeah! Great shit!
Okay, baby, now we come.
Sword plate activated.
Go, go! Get gun! Get gun!
- Watch your back!
Get your ass out of there, Luke.
Bounty is mine, motherfucker!
I'm tired of this asshole.
Time to lose.
CALIN: Oh, my God.
Hang on.
Dig that!
Still taking it, huh?
- You die!
- Come on!
Today! Today you die!
What do you got, huh?
Beautiful.
All right, it's clear sailing to the finish line now.
What are you doing?
- The enemy of my enemy.
- What's happening?
You die.
KATRINA: You wanna tell me why you just risked our lives to save that banger?
They're Triads. The only people
Markus would not deal with.
That's why they're not after us.
They have no clue about the hit.
Look, it's a Triad kill thing.
It's a life for a life.
I save his, he owes me a favour.
- Well, I saved your life.
- Really? How so?
Because your Markus Kane offered to buy my freedom if I would kill you.
Jesus! They all want me dead, now you, too?
- I guess you owe me a favour, too.
- I can't wait.
- Hey! I want a favour, too, huh?
- Fuck off, Goldberg.
Yeah, I got you, baby.
Sword pressure plates activated.
Shield ahead.
Shield pressure plate activated.
Okay, ready?
Activate the napalm on my signal.
Now.
- What's this?
- KATRINA: It's not working!
What's wrong?
- This is not good, Luke.
- It's a setup.
Yeah. I'm coming, baby!
Hey, Goldberg.
Someone had a play date with this car.
I got nothing. No guns, no smoke, nothing.
Come on, hit it, you dumbass bitch!
Swerve! Swerve!
- You, motherfucker!
- Turn!
What can I do?
- Brace yourself.
- No! What are you doing?
Get the fuck out ofthere!
Come on! You need to get out of there!
This is my fight.
No choice. Hang on.
Here I come!
Motherfucker won't stop firing!
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Heat-seeking missile has been activated.
- Come on!
- Hey! Get out of there!
Come on.
- Yeah! Shit!
- Yeah!
- What the fuck?
- You just killed your own pit crew.
Bitch, you shut the fuck up.
- Goldberg.
- Hey, get out of there!
Get in that car! I want a close-up.
Get me out of here!
Oh, God!
No!
Oh, my God, no!
Somebody help!
LISTS: Goldberg, get him out! Get him out!
No.
Rest in peace, Luke.
Rocco!
- You gotta answer for Luke.
- What the fuck you talking about?
Katrina said it was rigged from the inside.
And you're the only motherfucker that could have got to it.
You killed him?
Get away from me. Fuck you both.
- I need to talk to him.
- No.
He saved your life!
You owe him.
A life for a life.
I know what to do.
We've induced coma.
Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised, but he should be moved to a facility more suited to his needs.
Out ofthe question.
Doctor, someone from the outside tried to kill him.
Unless they think he's dead, they'll come back to finish the job.
Yeah, well, I can't pronounce a man dead while he's still alive.
Can't you?
How are we doing with finding a replacement for Parks?
She comes highly recommended from Halliburton.
She ran their maximum security detention centre.
She's strong. She's smart.
Ruthlessly ambitious.
I think if I weren't around, she'd tell people that Death Race was her idea and she'd convince them that it was.
How's the switchover to the Internet?
Transition's complete.
We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow.
The numbers have already surpassed pay-per-view, thanks to the Frankenstein commercial.
Hold on. Wait.
I've been meaning to talk to you about this Frankenstein.
Did you make him up?
Frankenstein most certainly exists, and he will be in the race tomorrow.
He better be.
And he better come as good as advertised.
The procedure's experimental and dangerous.
We're talking about placing electrodes into the brain.
You told me he was a perfect candidate.
Oh, he is.
But there are no guarantees.
Let's wake him up.
Mr. Lucas.
You've got second-degree burns over 85% of your body.
Now, you're lucky that you suffered no significant injuries.
Not a broken bone or damaged organ, which is remarkable considering the intensity of the fire.
So, this is hell?
Why?
Where else would you be?
You do rememberme.
You win five races and you're free.
You're out of your fucking mind.
No more Markus Kane trying to track you down.
Like a second chance.
Look at me.
Really. Look at me.
What kind of second chance would I have?
You're either
Frankenstein or you're nobody.
You're certainly not Carl Lucas any more.
The entire world watched him incinerate.
There's even a death certificate.
I pityyou.
Okay.
If you don't do it for your life, then you do it for Katrina.
I'll furlough five of my worst sodomites for a play date with sweet Katrina.
By the time they're finished with her, she'll be lucky if she has a pulse.
How do you feel, Mr. Lucas?
The name is Frankenstein.
Sorry to disappoint you.
You're gonna have to settle for the Mexican Jew.
Three, two, one, and we're in.
Good evening, and welcome to Death Race.
We're streaming live worldwide for over 20 million viewers. This week...
Yada, yada, yada.
Cut in promos of the drivers as soon as the light hits green, cut back to me, crane up, chase out after Frankenstein. Got it?
Yeah. It'll look good.
Yeah, I know it's a great shot.
It will be. We're live in five.
Okay, time for one more.
Go.
Go!
Where's Lists?
Said he had some business to take care of.
Climb aboard.
What?
You expecting another pretty boy?
Good evening, and welcome to Death Race.
We're streaming live to over 20 million viewers.
This week, 14K attempts to repeat as champion.
But he'll have fierce competition from several new drivers, including Frankenstein.
What are you doing?
Tell me who sent you.
Good for you, Luke.
Payback for Lucas.
KATRINA: Oh, my God!
Yes! The drinks are on me!
Yes!
Move my tee-off time from 9:00 to 10:00.
You see that?
That's a stupid bitch.
Take care of your business?
I'm only sorry Luke didn't live to see this.
I'm not so sure he didn't.
Frankenstein, huh?
You got a real name?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, of course, I do.
Live from Terminal Island, television's most violent, most disturbing, and most watched programme in human history.
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.
Welcome to Death Race.
Death Race is a trademark of Weyland International.
Unburden yourself, my son.
I was with General Sherman on his march south.
What we did...
Evil... unspeakable things.
You were a soldier.
You were following orders.
No.
No, not just orders.
We opened a dark door...
And the devil stepped in.
The only way to cast out the devil...
Is to confess to God.
No.
No, I can't, father.
Tell me about Meridian.
How do you know about Meridian?
Hell On Wheels S01E01

Subs by Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==
A nation which nearly destroyed itself by Civil War between north and south can only be healed by the binding together of east and west.
Mark my words, gentlemen, it will be built.
The only question which remains is...
Which one of you will join me in this mad, noble quest?
Who among you will have to say in years hence that he stood idly by as this nation became an empire?
And who among you will be able to say he lent a hand in making manifest our destiny as a great nation?
Here, here.
Bravo.
It's all horse crap.
The faster I shovel, the faster they eat it up.
But it was a truly inspirational speech.
Twattle and shy, I say.
Then why am I here?
You are here to play your part.
Credit mobilier.
Credit mobilier will be awarded all major construction contracts on the Union Pacific railroad.
I own it.
I'm giving you the chance to get in on the ground floor.
So, you'll be paying yourself to build a railroad with government subsidies.
Now that, my friend, is inspirational.
Yes, it is, but...
I can't afford these on a senator's salary.
As head of the congressional oversight committee on railroads,
I'm sure you will find a way to pay for them over and over and over again.
Might I ask how many shares are here?
200. I think you'll find that's fair.
400 sounds fairer.
Are you trying to renegotiate a bribe?
No. Bribe is such a dirty word. Hmm?
Why don't you think on it, doc, hmm?
Ahem. We've got to vote before the committee next Tuesday.
Good luck with your land speculation in Nebraska.
Oh, 50,000 acres bought on the cheap, hmm?
What would happen to the value of that land if I decided to route the railroad around it?
Take the stocks, Jordan.
But I've decided to renegotiate.
100 shares.
"He was gun... gunned... who... While he paaa...
Pr... pr...

Prayed.
I... I was getting it.
"Prayed...
In the con...
Conf...
Conference.
Prayed in the conference?
Confessional.
Someone killed the poor bugger whilst he was confessing?
What is the world coming to, eh?
Well, I suppose the only consolation is that he got to heaven that much faster.
How did you come by that conclusion?
Well, he confessed his sins.
He died in Grace.
So... God just up and punches his ticket to heaven, huh?
Well, yeah.
If that's how God goes about his business, you can keep him.
Keep God?
Do you not believe in a higher power?
Yes, sir, I wear it on my hip.
Are you a gunslinger then?
No.
I was just heading out west, looking for work on the railroad.
Yeah, so are we.
To seek our fortune, as it were.
I'm Mickey and this here's Sean.
Cullen Bohannon.
Mickey has 12 toes.
And Sean but 8.
Individually, we're freaks.
But together, we're whole.

Name?
Cullen Bohannon.
Railroad experience?
None.
Why should I hire you?
I'm willing to do just about anything.
Uh-huh, you and a thousand others.
I ain't got no place else to go, sir.
Save it.
Will you work the cut crew?
Yeah.
Yeah?
What's the cut crew?
Oh, it's brutal work.
It is not for the faint of heart.
It gets hotter than a whore house on nickel night out there.
I ain't afraid of hard work.
You're a Johnny reb, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I could tell by that griswold you're carrying.
It was a griswold like that that took off my hand.
We all paid a price,
Mr. Bohannon, and I imagine you bare your own scars.
I was a copperhead before the war.
So, I... I bear no hard feelings towards you graybacks.
You did what you had to do.
It's the darkies I blame.
The way I see it, they only fire more than just a hand.
Say, did you own slaves, Mr. Bohannon?
I did.
Well, then... I imagine you know your way around a n.
This is Mr. Bohannon...
Your walking boss.
You can address him as boss or boss man or walking boss.
Mr. Bohannon is a former master of slaves.
Some things don't never change.
So, he's up to your tricks.
He's going to work the blue out of your gums, boys.
Any coffee boilers or otherwise slack work ethic will be dealt with severely.
Now, dig me a cut.
** Pass me not, o gentle savior **
Jesus Christ, accept this humble servant into your heart.
** Hear my humble cry
** while on others thou art calling... ** be reborn...
In the glory of Jesus.
** Do not pass me by
** savior...
Brother Joseph... your sins are washed away.
** Hear my humble cry
** Oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** 12 gates to the city...
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.
** There's 3 gates in the east **
** there's 3 gates in the west ** right here.
** There's 3 gates in the north **
I love the tent.
** And there's 3 gates in the south... ** raise the church.
In this den of thieves,
I shall build a house of the lord.
You putting up a church here?
What better place to convert the wicked, sister.
** Won't you do this kind of favor... ** you better keep an eye on your flock, reverend.
We do our own share of convertin' around here.
** Please tell my mother why have you made my roads so straight?
Are we not in a race with the central pacific?
The central pacific?
Those imbeciles will never make it out of Sacramento.
They're so desperate, I hear they're hiring chinks.
What I was thinking... was something more like... this.
But we're building over a flat land, why wouldn't we make it straight?
Why wouldn't we make it straight he asks?
Take a closer look.
Uh!
Let me elucidate.
In case you haven't heard, this undertaking is being subsidized by the enormous teat of the federal government.
This never-ending, money-gushing nipple pays me
$16,000 per mile, yet, you build my road straight!
You're fired.
Get out.
I said, get out.
You look like a bright young man.
This land...
It's bewitching.
It hasn't changed since Lewis and
Clark first saw it 60 years ago.
Do you ever wonder if our work here will...
Will be the ruin of all of this?
Progress comes with a cost, lily.
I just think it's so much more beautiful without people.
Don't fool yourself.
There are plenty of people here.
We're entering
Cheyenne territory.
You do remember our agreement?
You mean our agreement to regarding my not leaving your side while you were ill?
No.
Ahem.
I mean, our agreement that you should go back to Chicago once we entered hostile Indian territory.
Yes, my dear, but it was before you took ill.
Yeah.
I believe our second agreement supersedes our first.
Oh, dear God, now you sound like a lawyer.
If you want me to go to Chicago... lead the way.
I'm not leaving without you, Robert.
Don't tempt me, lily.
I might just do it.
You play me for dumb.
Ahh, you've worked for this for too long to go back now.
We've worked at this.
This... this would mean nothing to me if you weren't here to share it.
Robert Bell, are you hiding something in your trousers?
It must be all this fresh air.
Mmm.
Mmm. Breathe deeply.
So, uh, how many slaves did you own?
5 in all.
I had me a small tobacco farm.
Any women?
You ever, uh...
Sample the goods?
Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.
Call.
You, uh... bitter that you had to give up your slaves?
I gave them their freedom a year before the war started.
Are you serious?
I kept them on at wages.
Ha ha.
You are an odd duck,
Bohannon.
I married a northerner.
She convinced me of the evils of slavery.
So, you... you released your slaves, yet you still fought in the war.
Why?
Honor.
The southerner and his honor.
Where is your wife now?
She's dead.
Did the war take her?
Something like that.
Think they heard us?
Who cares?
I don't want to torment the poor bastards out here alone in the middle of nowhere.
They have their hands.
Ohh.
Shh. Shh.
Shh.
I feel this cough is going to be the death of me.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
Lily... if I were to die...
Robert... please... please don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.
Oh!
The map.
We have to save their work.
Run to the trees.
Don't look back.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Uhh!
Uh!
No, please no.
Ah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Robert!
Rise and shine, Bohannon.
It's another beautiful day on the railroad.
Get up!
Uhh.
Get up! Come on!
Whoa.
My horse.
All right, lad.
Half-hour to lunch!
Half-hour!
Peckerwood.
He ain't so bad.
Shut your dumb black ass up.
I don't need no slave boss motivatin' me.
Mm-hmm.
Come on!
Help me out here.
** All them pretty gals gonna be there **
** shuck that corn before you eat ** come on!
Come on!
I say... ** all them pretty gals gonna be there **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** they gonna fix it for us rare **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** I know that supper gonna be big **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** I think I smell a fire roast pig **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
Keep it going.
** I hope they got some whiskey there **
You might want to take a look at this.
Put it in the pile.
No, sir.
You really need to look at this.
Dear God.
Robert Bell is dead?
Is this the entire message?
Yes, sir.
Nothing about...
Maps being found?
No, sir.
One last telegram.
To the Union Pacific board of directors... change of plans.
Stop. Heading for hell on wheels immediately. Stop.
Send it.
You need some water.
No, it ain't... it ain't break time yet.
Come on, you need some water. Come on.
Come on.
Unh.
I thought I told you to dump that dirt on the other side.
Hey.
Shut your mouth.
I told him to do it.
We going to fill in that dip over yonder next.
I figured we might just use some field dirt nearby.
You talk to me before any decisions are made, all right?
Yes, sir, master.
What did you say?
Bohannon, what the hell is going on here?
You drink when
I tell you to drink!
Uh!
Get up!
Willy! Willy! Willy!
Willy!
This is what happens when you break my rules.
Now, what you planning on doing with that Arkansas toothpick, huh?
Don't do it.
We ain't on no plantation no more... walking boss.
Ain't nothing good gonna come from this.
Yeah.
Well, there ain't nothing good coming from this either.
That dumb n actually thought this was gonna changed a thing.
Look what that got him.
Might just as well wipe my ass with it.
You kill him...
You will hang.
How they gonna hang me if there ain't no witnesses?
You come to me with a knife, son...
You better be ready to use it.
Yeah.
You got to let go of the past.
Have you let it go?
You doing quite a trade here.
Not bad for a couple of Irish bumpkins.
Where's Mickey?
He's preparing for the grand finale.
** When you're far away
** far from the land you'll be ** do you not pine for your own homeland, Mr. Bohannon?
No.
And why is that?
It's gone.
** Bright and fair
** and rich in its treasures
** Muldoon
** Won't you come back soon
** love you
So, tell me, Bohannon...
Did you see the elephant during the war?
Yes, I saw my share of action, yeah.
Where?
Yeah. I don't like to talk about it.
I loved the war.
I loved the war!
The best thing that ever happened to me.
I thought you said you were against it?
Oh, yeah, I was.
But... that doesn't mean...
That I didn't enjoy myself once pressed into service.
Hey!
Oh, hey,
I'm... I'm skimped.
No, no. This one's on me.
Well... well, thank you.
Most men shrink...
When they see the elephant up close.
Oh, yeah?
But I... I blossomed.
Thank you.
Though I...
I must admit that there were, um...
Certain lines that I crossed.
Lines of morality that I didn't think myself capable of crossing.
But that's what men do... in war.
Hmm.
Moral men don't.
So, you did nothing that you were ashamed of?
I did plenty I was ashamed of.
You ever been to Meridian,
Mississippi, Mr. Johnson?
That is my remington pointed at your gut.
So... let's take a walk out back.
I know about the 2 men you killed in Maryland.
I read in the paper about Prescott getting killed in that church by a griswold.
But I'll be damned if you didn't show up a few days later with a griswold strapped to your hip as plain as day.
And then you ask me about
Meridian? That's sensitive.
Mmm! I am not proud of what happened to your wife, Bohannon.
It didn't happen to her.
You did it to her.
Yes. Yes, we did it to her.
I did it to her.
Your wife was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want you to know...
It wasn't my idea to kill her.
She hung herself?
No, she didn't.
The sergeant strangled her and strung her up.
Sergeant?
What sergeant?
Well, he's out here, too.
I figured you were saving him for last.
Oh, you didn't know about it?
You tell me who he is.
Well, it hardly matters now.
No!
Tell me his name.
Tell me his name.
Is it a villain you want?
I'll play the part.
After all, what is a drama without a villain?
What is the building of this grand road if not a drama?
This business is not for the weak of heart.
It's a thorny, brutal affair that rewards the lion for his ferocity.
What of the zebra?
What of the poor zebra?
Well, the zebra's eaten as the zebra should be.
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.
Lives will be lost.
Fortunes will be made.
Men will be ruined.
There will be betrayal and scandal.
A perfidy of epic proportions.
But... the lion shall prevail.
You see, the secret
I know is this...
All of history is driven by the lion.
We drag the poor zebra kicking and braying.
Stain the earth with his cheap blood.
History doesn't remember us fondly, but then history is written by the zebra for the zebra.
100 years hence...
When this railroad spans the continent and America rises to be the greatest power the world has seen...
I will be remembered as a caitiff...
Malefactor...
Who only operated out of greed for personal gain.
All true. All true.
But remember this...
Without me...
And men like me, your glorious railroad would never have been built.

There is a town in Maine...
I'd like a room. Welcome to Storybrooke.
Where every storybook character you've ever known...
Is trapped between two worlds...
An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
And now they don't remember who they are.
Victims of a powerful curse...
Everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.
That can only be broken by one person.
It's your destiny. You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
You enjoy your stay.

Once Upon A Time S01E02
"The Thing You Love Most"
** Don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** don't wear fear **
** or nobody will know you're there **
** just lift your head **
** and let your feelings out instead **
** and don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by, on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by ** the missing pages...  where are they?
It's an old book. Stuff's missing.
What do you care?
I care because you think
I am some evil queen.
And that hurts me, Henry.
I am your mother.
No, you're not.
Well, then, who is?
That woman you brought here?
I don't like what she or this book is doing to you.
Thankfully both are no longer an issue.
What?
Hey, how about that?
Guess those rusty old innards finally straightened themselves out, huh?
Yes, how about that, indeed.
Did you know the honey crisp tree is the most vigorous and
Hardy of all apple trees?
It can survive temperatures as low as 40 below and keep growing.
It can weather any storm.
I have one that I've tended to since I was a little girl...
And to this day I have yet to taste anything more delicious than the fruit it offers.
Thanks.
I'm sure you'll enjoy them on your drive home.
Actually, I'm gonna stay for a while.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
Henry has enough issues.
He doesn't need you confusing him.
All due respect, madame Mayor, the fact that you have now threatened me twice in the last 12 hours makes me want to stay more.
Since when were apples a threat?
I can read between the lines.
Sorry. I just want to make sure Henry's okay.
He's fine, dear.
Any problems he has are being taken care of.
What does that mean?
It means I have him in therapy.
It's all under control.
Take my advice, Ms. Swan, only one of us knows what's best for Henry.
Yeah, I'm starting to think you're right about that.
It's time for you to go.
Or what?
Don't underestimate me, Ms. Swan.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
I shall destroy your happiness...
If it is the last thing I do.
Hey!
Would you like something to drink?
Do I look like I need a drink?
I was only trying to help.
Thank you.
Now that was an awfully big threat.
Destroy everyone's happiness?
How do you plan on accomplishing that?
The dark curse.
Are you sure, your majesty?
You said you'd never use it.
You made a deal when you gave away that curse.
You traded it away.
She won't be happy to see you.
Since when do I care about anyone else's happiness but mine?
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to the forbidden fortress.
How are you, dear?
I'm doing fine.
Are you?
If it were me,
I'd be simply tortured, watching that flake of snow so happy.
Weren't you about the same age when you were to be married before she ruined it all? Yes, you were.
Yes, it was about the same age you were when that sleeping beauty got the best of you, my dear maleficent.
I soldiered on, as you will, too, hopefully.
Enough games. You know why I'm here.
I need my curse back.
It's not yours anymore. A deal's a deal.
I traded you my sleeping curse.
Which failed, undone by a simple kiss.
Now please, return what's mine.
The dark curse? Really?
You must know that not even its unholy power can bring your loved one back from the dead.
Have you considered a pet?
They can be quite comforting.
The only comfort for me is Snow White's suffering.
Well, it's her wedding night.
I doubt she's suffering right now.
I need that curse.
I know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff.
Hidden for the good of all, old friend.
Whoever created that monstrosity makes the two of us look positively... moral.
Who did give it to you?
Where I got it's none of your concern.
Hand it back.
Must we do this?
Alas, we must.
No!
Love is weakness, maleficent.
I thought you knew that.
If you're going to kill me, kill me.
Why would I do that?
You're my only friend.
Don't do this. This curse... there are lines even we shouldn't cross.
All power comes with a price.
Enacting it will take a terrible toll.
It will leave an emptiness inside you...
A void you will never be able to fill.
So be it.
Who among us is tired of losing?
That's why I called you here...
To put an end to our misery.
Today we claim victory...
And move to a new, better realm...
A place where we can finally win.
And we'll be happy?
I guarantee it.
But first,
I need something from you... a lock of hair from those with the darkest souls.
You must trust me, because if you don't, there are other ways.
A wise decision.
All that remains is the final ingredient...
A prized heart...
From my childhood steed...
The glorious beast whose passing will fuel our victory.
Let my wrath be unleashed.
Yeah, you really unleashed something there.
The "mirror" strikes again.
You're late.
Sorry. I wanted to bring you the latest edition.
I assure you it's one of my better hatchet jobs.
That's not what I asked for.
What'd you find out about her?
Well, the truth be told, there wasn't much.
She spent a lot of time in foster homes.
Uh, she got into some trouble when she was a kid, but the details are locked up pretty tight.
Since then, she's clean.
Bounced around all over.
The only thing I really learned was that she doesn't like to sit still.
That appears to have changed.
Did you know that, um, she had Henry while she was in Phoenix?
How'd he wind up here in Maine?
So if I'm understanding you correctly...
You found nothing of value,
which means you have no value, Sidney.
Do you know what I do with things that hold no value to me?
I throw them away.
I'll keep looking.
Here you go.
Thank you, but I did not order that.
Yeah, I know. You have an admirer.
Ah, so you decided to stay.
Observant...  important for a cop.
It's good news for our tourist business.
It's bad for our local signage.
It's... it's a joke.
Because you ran over our sign.
Look, the cocoa was a nice gesture, and I am impressed that you guessed that I like cinnamon on my chocolate,
'cause most people don't, but I am not here to flirt, so thank you, but no, thank you.
I didn't send it.
I did.
I like cinnamon, too.
Don't you have school?
Duh. I'm 10. Walk me.
So what's the deal with you and your mom?
It's not about us. It's about her curse.
We have to break it.
Luckily, I have a plan.
Step one... identification.
I call it Operation Cobra.
Cobra? That has nothing to do with fairy tales.
Exactly. It's a code name to throw the queen off the trail.
So everyone here is a fairy tale character... they just don't know it?
That's the curse.
Time's been frozen, until you got here.
Hey!
Where'd you get that?
Your mom?
Don't eat that.
O-okay.
Uh, all right, what about their pasts?
They don't know. It's a haze to them.
Ask anyone anything, and you'll see.
So for decades, people have been walking around in a haze, not aging, with screwed-up memories, stuck in a cursed town that kept them oblivious.
I knew you'd get it.
That's why we need you.
You're the only one who can stop her curse.
Because I'm the daughter of
Snow White and Prince Charming... yes, and right now we have the advantage.
My mom doesn't know that.
I took out the end, the part with you in it.
See? Your mom is Snow White.
Oh, kid.
I know the hero never believes at first.
If they did, it wouldn't be a very good story.
If you need proof, take them, read them, but whatever you do, don't let her see these pages.
They're dangerous.
If she finds out who you are...
It would be bad.
I gotta go, but I'll find you later and we can get started.
I knew you'd believe me!
I never said I did.
Why else would you be here?
It's good to see his smile back.
I didn't do anything.
You stayed.
So does the Mayor know you're still here?
Oh, she knows. What is her deal?
She is not a great people person.
How did she get elected?
She's been Mayor as long as I can remember.
No one's ever been brave enough to run against her.
She inspires quite a bit of...
Well, fear.
I'm afraid I only made that worse by giving Henry that book.
Now he thinks she's the evil queen.
Who does he think you are?
Oh. It's silly.
I just got five minutes of silly.
Lay it on me.
Snow White.
Who does he think you are?
I'm not in the book.
Can I ask you a favor?
Regina mentioned the kid's in therapy.
Do you know where I can find the doctor?
Hey.
Emma Swan. I was, uh, just reading about you.
Let me guess... you're here for help with a little post-traumatic stress?
That diagnosis was free, by the way.
No, I'm here about Henry.
I'm sorry. I-I-I really shouldn't...
I know. I'm sorry.
Just tell me something.
This fairy tale obsession... what is causing it?
I mean, he thinks everyone is a character in his book.
That's...
Crazy.
I hope you don't talk that way in front of him.
The word "crazy" is, um, quite damaging. These stories...
They're his language.
He has no idea how to express complex emotions, so he's translating as best he can.
This is how he communicates, and he's using this book to help deal with this problems.
But he got the book a month ago.
Has he been seeing you longer than that?
Um... yes, he has.
So it's Regina, isn't it?
Uh, his mother is a... very complicated woman, and, uh, over the years, her attempts to try and bring Henry closer have only backfired.
Why don't you take a look at the file?
Um, see what I mean.
Why are you doing this?
Well, he talks about you a lot, and you're very important to him.
Thank you.
Just, uh, see that I get it back, okay?
Ms. Swan.
For the sake of the boy, be careful how you handle his belief system.
Destroying his imagination would be... be devastating.
You were right. She was just here.
Did she take the file?
Yes.
How... how did you know she was gonna come here?
Because I'm the one who gave her the idea.
Hey there.
If you're concerned about the
"do not disturb" signs, don't worry. I've left them alone.
Actually, I'm here about
Dr. Archibald Hopper.
He mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier?
No.
I was shocked, too, given your shy, delicate sensibilities.
He says you demanded to see Henry's files and when he refused, you came back and stole them.
He gave them to me.
Alas, he's telling a different tale.
May I check your room, or must I get a search warrant?
Is this what you're looking for?
Well, you're very accommodating.
I'm afraid, Ms. Swan, you're under arrest...
Again.
You know I'm being set up, don't you?
And who, may I ask, is setting you up?
Where carbon dioxide and water synthesize.
May I speak with my son?
We're in the middle of a lesson.
Is it important?
Do you think I'd be here if it wasn't?
Henry, sweetie, I have some bad news.
The woman who you brought here... she's been arrested.
She broke into Dr. Hopper's office and stole his files.
She's a con woman.
She's trying to learn about us in order to take advantage of us.
That's why she's sticking around.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
I know you think otherwise, but all I'm doing is trying to protect you.
This is gonna be good for us.
You'll see.
Things will be better.
I gotta get back to class.
You know the shrink is lying, right?
To the right, please. Why would he lie?
The Mayor put him up to this.
She's gotta have something on him.
He's terrified of her like everyone else in this...
Town.
To the left.
Regina may be...
A touch intimidating, but I don't think she'd go as far as a frame job.
How far would she go?
What does she have her hands in?
Well, she's the Mayor.
She has her hands in everything.
Including the police force?
Hey.
Henry. Henry, what are you doing here?
His mother told him what happened.
Of course she did.
Henry, I don't know what she said... you're a genius.
What?
I know what you were up to.
You were gathering intel...
For Operation Cobra?
I'm sorry. I'm a bit lost.
It's need-to-know, sheriff, and all you need to know is that Ms. Blanchard's gonna bail her out.
You are?
Why?
I, uh, trust you.
Well, if you can uncuff me,
I have something to do.
What the hell are you doing?
Picking apples.
You're out of your mind.
No, you are, if you think a shoddy frame job's enough to scare me off. You're gonna have to do better than that.
You come after me one more time,
I'm coming back for the rest of this tree.
Because, sister, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
Your move.
Maybe it's for the best.
The forces you're summoning are darker than we can conceive.
Tect me?
It's what I do.
I know.
You're the only one who does.
Helping you is my life.
Well, then help me understand why this curse isn't working.
If you want to know that, then you need to go back to the person who gave it to you in the first place.
Revenge is a dark and lonely road.
Once you go down it...
There is no heading back.
What is there for me to head back to?
It's just us, dearie.
You can show yourself.
Ahh.
That curse you gave me...
It's not working.
Oh, so worried.
So, so worried...
Like snow and her lovely new husband.
What?
They paid me a visit as well.
They were very anxious about you and the curse.
What'd you tell them?
The truth... that nothing can stop the darkness...
Except, of course, their unborn child.
You see, no matter how powerful, all curses can be broken.
Their child is the key.
Of course the curse has to be enacted first.
Tell me what I did wrong.
For that, there's a price.
What do you want?
Simple.
In this new land,
I want comfort.
I want a good life.
Fine. You'll have an estate, be rich.
I wasn't finished. There's more.
There always is with you.
Yeah.
In this new land, should I ever come to you for any reason, you must heed my every request.
You must do whatever I say,
so long as I say...
Please.
You do realize that should I succeed, you won't remember any of this?
Oh, well, then... What's the harm?
Deal.
What must I do to enact this curse?
You need to sacrifice a heart.
I sacrificed my prized steed.
A horse? This is the curse to end all curses.
You think a horse is gonna do?
Great power requires great sacrifice.
The heart you need
must come from something far more precious.
Tell me what will suffice.
The heart of the thing you love most.
What I love most died because of Snow White.
Is there no one else you truly love?
This curse isn't going to be easy.
Vengeance never is, dearie.
You have to ask yourself a simple question... how far are you willing to go?
As far as it takes.
Then please stop wasting everyone's time and just do it.
You know what you love.
Now go kill it.
Ms. Swan.
Oh, my, this is terribly awkward.
I need to ask you to leave.
I'm afraid we have a no-felons rule.
It turns out it's a city ordinance.
Let me guess... the Mayor's office just called to remind you?
You can gather your things, but I need to have your room key back.
She destroyed city property.
I want her arrested.
Again?
What are you waiting for?
I'm just not convinced arresting her's the right plan...
And I'm not talking about your tree.
We both know she didn't steal those files.
Oh, do we? I mean, she looked pretty shocked when I leveled the charges against her.
Guess she doesn't like being caught.
Or because she was set up.
And if she was, that means
Dr. Hopper was lying.
And if he's lying, that means that someone asked him to.
Are we really confident that the man's conscience won't eventually get the best of him?
I think your schoolboy crush is clouding your judgment.
Remember, I made you sheriff, and I can take it away just as easily.
You want me to arrest her again, I will.
Good.
But she's gonna keep coming at you, and I know you... you're gonna keep coming at her and you will do whatever it takes to get her out of here and you may succeed.
No, I will succeed.
He's my son. It's what's best for him.
I know that's what you believe.
Okay? But if this escalates, it seems to me the only one who will get hurt is Henry.
Yeah?
Ms. Swan,
I'd be happy to continue demonstrating my power, but am I right in guessing your resolve to stay is only growing?
You have no idea.
Well, then, I think it's time we made peace.
Why don't you drive over to my office?
Or walk... whatever suits you.
I'd like to start by apologizing,
Ms. Swan.
What?
I just have to accept the reality that you want to be here...
That's right, I do.
And that you're here to take my son from me.
Okay. Let's be clear.
I have no intention of taking him from anyone.
Well, then, what are you doing here?
I know I'm not a mother...
I think that's pretty self-evident... but I did have him, and I can't help it... he got in my head and I want to make sure he's okay.
The more you try to push me out, the more I want to be here, especially after seeing how troubled he is.
You think he's troubled?
Well, he's in therapy, and I only got through a couple pages of his shrink's notes before you had me arrested, but putting all that aside... he thinks everyone in this town is a fairy tale character.
And you don't?
How can I?
The poor kid can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and it's only getting worse.
It's crazy.
You think I'm crazy?
Henry.
How long was he there?
Long enough.
You knew he would be here.
Did I know that my son comes to my office every Thursday at precisely 5:00 P.M.
So I can take him for dinner before his therapy session?
Of course I did.
I'm his mother.
Your move.
You have no soul.
How in the hell did you get like this?
What happened? Did you get your answer?
What's going on?
Your majesty?
Your majesty!
Did Rumplestiltskin tell you what you needed to know?
Yes.
And?
I'm not sure I should say.
I'm conflicted.
How bad is it?
Maybe I can help.
I have to cut out the heart of the thing I love most.
Me.
Daddy, I don't know what to do.
My dear...
Please...
You don't have to do this.
I have to do something.
Then move past this.
I know this may sound self-serving, but you don't need to enact the curse.
But I can't keep living like this.
What snow did to me, what she took from me...
It's eating me alive, daddy.
Her very existence mocks me.
She must be punished.
What's...
If the price is a hole that will never be filled, why do it?
Stop worrying about Snow
White and start over.
We can have a new life.
But what kind of life?
All I've worked for, all I've built, will be gone.
My power will disappear.
They already think I'm nothing.
Power is seductive, but so is love, and you can have that again.
I just want to be happy.
You can be. Of this I'm sure.
I believe, given the chance, we can find happiness together.
But the choice is yours.
I think you're right.
I can be happy.
Just not here.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Just wanted to say thank you and, um, pay you back the bail money.
You look like you need to talk.
Cinnamon?
Oh. I'm sorry. I should have asked.
It's a little quirk of mine.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
No, thanks.
When you bailed me out, you said that you trusted me.
Why?
It's strange... ever since you arrived here,
I've had the oddest feeling like we met before.
I mean, I know it's crazy.
I'm starting to reevaluate my definition of crazy.
For what it's worth,
I think you're innocent.
Of breaking and entering or just in general?
Whichever makes you feel better.
Doesn't really matter what anyone thinks I did or didn't do.
I'm leaving.
Thank you for everything, but I think it's for the best.
If I stay, Henry's only gonna keep getting hurt.
What happens if you go?
I think the very fact that you want to leave is why you have to stay.
You care about him.
Who will protect Henry if you won't?
Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
You know, that umbrella is kind of my good luck charm.
Is that why you think
I'm jiminy cricket?
I don't think you're anyone.
Ms. Swan.
Look, I can explain.
The Mayor forced me...  I know.
Don't worry about it.
I get it. Henry, I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
Ms. Swan, if she knew you were here... to hell with her.
Henry, there is one simple reason I stayed here... you.
I wanted to get to know you.
You think I'm crazy.
No, I think the curse is crazy, and it is.
But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.
It is a lot to ask anyone to believe in, but there are a lot of crazy things in this world.
So what do I know? Maybe it is true.
But you told my mom... what she needed to hear.
What I do know...
Is that if the curse is real, the only way to break it is by tricking the evil queen...
Into thinking that we are nonbelievers,
'cause that way, she's not on to us.
Isn't that what Operation
Cobra was all about?
Throwing her off the trail?
Brilliant.
I read the pages, and, Henry, you're right... they are dangerous.
There is only one way to make sure that she never sees these.
Now we have the advantage.
I knew you were here to help me.
That's right, kid. I am.
And nothing, not even a curse, is gonna stop that.
I love you, daddy.
What a mess.
Not for long.
What can I do for you, Mr. Gold?
I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd pop by.
Lovely to see you in such high spirits.
Well, it's been a good day.
I just rid the town of an unwanted nuisance.
Emma Swan? Really?
Yes. I imagine she's halfway to Boston by now.
I wouldn't bet on that.
I've just seen her strolling down the main street with your boy.
Thick as thieves, they looked.
What?
Perhaps you should have come to me.
If Ms. Swan is a problem you can't fix,
I'm only too happy to help, for a price, of course.
I'm not in the business of making deals with you anymore.
To which deal are you referring?
You know what deal.
Oh, right, yeah.
The boy I procured for you.
Henry.
Did I ever tell you what a lovely name that was?
How ever did you pick it?
Did you want her to come to town?
You wanted all this to happen, didn't you?
Your finding Henry wasn't an accident, was it?
What ever do you mean?
Where did you get him?
Do you know something?
I've no idea what you're implying.
I think you do.
Who is this woman, his mother, this... Emma Swan?
I would say you think you know exactly who she is.
I really must be going.
Tell me what you know about her.
I'm not gonna answer you, dear, so I suggest you excuse me.
Please.

Some orang-utan type thing,

Hey, it's breezin', man.

Moses got shanked by a Dobby.
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

- What is that, cuz?
- That ain't no is. That's a was.
I told you, some exotic creature, like a monkey thing.
That fell out of the sky. You trying to tell me it's raining monkeys?
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.
- I ain't even gonna say.
- You know what that is?
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.
It must have come from outer space, trying to take over Earth.
But it landed in the wrong place.
The wrong place!
- Welcome to London, mo fucker.
- Welcome to the ends, brother.
This is the block. And nobody fucks with the block, do you get me?
The B-L-O-C-K.
Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap...

- Do you live here?
- Yeah.
- Come along, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.
Come on.
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.
Must have given you such a nasty shock.
- You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thanks. Water's fine.
Bloody fireworks.
I think they should ban them.
Could be the third world war out there, you wouldn't know the difference.
What did the police say?
Said it was one of the busiest nights of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.
Only it's not like the kids are scared of 'em no more.
Walking around with knives, great big dogs, like they own the block.
Excuse my French, but they're fucking monsters, ain't they?
Yeah. Fucking monsters.
- ... its ribs and that.
- Have you found anything?
I beg you give me two pound to go to Chicken World, fam.
That's disgusting.
Moses, where are we gonna take that thing?
Take it to Ron's. He watches that National Geographic shit.
All man ever does is blaze, water them big buds and watch the nature channel.
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.
We were crazy kicking that.
No, Mum. Playing football.
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.
Some kind of non-found-out-about creature.
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mum, back by ten.
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking the poor people, man?
- Hey, let's walk, bruv.
- Whoo!
Woy.
- Moses, what happened to your face?
- Battled an alien that fell from the sky.
- You're funny.
- Eurgh, what is that?
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.
- Halloween was last week.
- That ain't real. That's a creation.
- Touch it.
- Shove that thing in my face and them fangs are going up in your tits.
- Move it from me. Grow up.
- Could be diseased, you get me?
I don't want no chlamydia.
So you're telling me that fell out of the sky?
- Yeah.
- And did that to your face?
- Yeah.
- So, you killed it?
Yeah.
Such a bad breed, Moses.
Fuck! it's alive!
- Tia is moving to you, Moses.
- She's on your balls, cuz.
Hey, that's my cousin you're chatting about.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.
Get down, man.
- Trust, I can do it.

We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.
- Oh, I swear I could do that.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.
- Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
- My name ain't Gavin.
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.
Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?
- Urgh, what is that?
- That's none of your business.
That's sick, man.
Where you going?
Let us come with you.
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.
Yeah, get in touch when you get your first pube.
Go suck your mum.

Do you remember what they were wearing?
One of them had one of those woolly hats with those tassels.
The one that pushed me over, the main one, had a black baseball cap with a red brim.
That's all I can remember.
Did you see their faces?
Have you seen them around?
No. They had hoods and scarves.
You want me to call the police?
The best thing is to come with us for a drive around the block, see if we can spot them.
Then we can drop you with a friend afterwards.
No, thanks.

Some creature fell from outer space and jumped Moses, so he bored it.
And now its brethren have come down in force, blood.
Moses got shiffed by the feds and the things attacked the van and savaged the bluefoot, so we jacked the van.

When the feds ind the bodies and the van, we are fucked.
No. If it's happening all over, the police are gonna be too busy tonight.
National emergency, army on the streets, helicopters, all that 28 Days Later shit.
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.
Like none of this ever happened.
Yes, boss. Back in the block!
How do we do that with them things out there?
That's suicide, man.
- You know what?
- What?
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time...
What?
This is sick.
Fuck!
They're on us!
- Split! Meet at the block!
- Oi, pedal, pedal, pedal!
Jerome, pedal!
Stairs, blood!
Move, move, move, move!
Where's Biggz?
Where's Pest?
Hurry up!
Go on, run!
Close the door, man!
Fuck!
Grab it!
Aarghh!
Hey, snitch!
Move, man! Huh? Move!
Fucking move!
- Hey, come on, blood!
- Get the bag off him!
- Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
- I got one text left.
- I got no credit.
- Drop call everybody.
- Pray someone calls back.
- This is too much to explain in one text.
Get out of my fucking flat!
- Shut up, man.
- Pss...
- I said, get out!
- Yo, snitch, calm yourself.
This ain't about you no more.
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!
There's worse things out there than us tonight.
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.
- She's a nurse, innit.
- Help me, then. I need this leg.
I need it to be able to run away from them things.
You think I'm gonna help you?
After you attacked me, and robbed me, and then set those dogs on the police?
- Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
- Dogs?
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?
Go out there and try feedin' 'em some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.
Whatever the fuck they are, they're not fucking aliens.
- You swear too much, man.
- Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.
Whatever they are, they're inside the block.
They're after everyone.
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?
- No feds.
- You'd be better off calling the Ghostbusters.
This is the block. We take care of things our own way. Get me?
- You're joking?
- Does it look like he's jokin'?
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.
So do you. If those wounds get infected, they could kill you.
- Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
- Fuck!
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!
We ain't gonna do nothing.
Fix him.
Jesus. it's one of the most extraordinary spectacles in nature.
What if those kids were right?
What if they're connected - that freak show animal and the hole in my dad's car?
What if there is some kind of invasion and the police are out there?
I can't get busted again.
- You've been busted?
- Yeah.
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in the washing machine by mistake and...
I shit you not, my mum's underwear came out stinking of skunk.
My dad obviously caught a whiff and cutoff my allowance.
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.
The irony is, now I've gotta sell twice the amount just to pay the rent.
I thought you said you lived at home?
Yeah, well, I mean...
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do what you gotta do, you know.
A man's gotta put bread on the table - proverbially speaking, of course.
Fo-shizzle.
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion, they're four foot high, they're blind and they got kicked to death by a group of kids.
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Sorry I messed up your couch.
- Don't worry about it.
- D'you want me to take 'em off?
That won't be necessary.
You sure? I got nice boxers on.
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Try me.
Ow! Hurts.
- How about this?
- Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.
This needs treating before you lose too much blood.
- Do it, then.
- I can't do it.
I don't have the equipment or the skill.
I've only just graduated.
And I missed the class on alien bite wounds.
Stop hyping, man.
Pass me that cushion.
I said, pass me that cushion!
Oh! Don't take it out on me.
I ain't seen you around here before, you know.
- You lived here long?
- Couple of months.
Hmm. Nice place you got.
Thanks. Thinking of moving.
Shame. Why?
- I don't like the area.
- What do you mean, don't like the area?
What's wrong with the area?
Fam, stay.
Get off me!
- What was that?
- They found us.
How could they End us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.
Whatever gang war you're involved in, leave me out of it, please.
Hey, this ain't got nothin' to do with gangs.
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.
- This is the worst night of my life.
- Feeling's mutual.
Moses, don't, man!
Moses.
Ninja!
Tango neutralised.
See? Is that a dog?
- No.
- No, that is not a dog.
That's black.
Too black to see.
That's the blackest black ever, fam.
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.
Oi, where's that woman?
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.
After what you put me through tonight, it's the least you can do.
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!
- My name's Sam.
- Jerome.
- I'm Pest.
- No, man.
Dennis.
You're Moses, right?
You're gonna need a weapon.
Move along, please. Move along.
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.
- What's happening, man?
- Something fucked up.
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in the area, roadblocks and everything.
Maybe we should chill out till things die down.
- Are you telling me to chill out?
- No. Wait till things cool down.
- You telling me to cool down?
- Ah, forget it, bruv.
Get in the car.
Get in the car now!
They mash up my whip with a bully van they stole, start threatening me about aliens or some shit, facing me down, telling me I'm gonna get shifted.
Hey, watch where you're going, you prick!
Then, some like... some like big dog, some big gorilla wolf motherfucker, comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks, tears his neck all the way out. Believe.
- So was it a dog, then?
- Don't give a fuck what it was.
Shot that ting. Died easy.
And we gotta learn them youngers tonight, you get me?
That's my block!
♪ Don't give a fuck
♪ Blat, blat, blat
♪ Get that snitch
Get the strap
♪ Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat...
You get four years for carrying an offensive weapon, you know.
- I think this situation's a bit different.
- Is it?
Walking around, expecting to get jumped at any moment?
Feels like just another day in the ends to me.
- Where's he taking us?
- Tia's flat.
- How will we be any safer in her place?
- Security gate.
She wouldn't be asking that question if she'd seen them girls fight.
Ay, it's Biggz. He's alive.
- Yo, Biggz, we thought you was dead.
- I called you 50 times, blood.
What's your phone doing on silent at a time like this for, fam?
- Where you at?
- In the bin.
Same bin I was at that time them boys from Aylesbury was after me.
One of them things is trying to headbang me out. Rescue me, yeah?
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things are in the block, busting through doors.
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?
I'll bell you back when we get to Na's.
Fuck this, man!
- Yo, Biggz.
- Listen, listen.
I've got one pound credit and bare people to call.
I can only say this once.
We need backup. Alien attack.
Slow down. I don't understand a word you're saying. Speak slowly.
This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!
Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.
Call everyone!
Tell them to come back!
That thing we killed was for real!
Now there's bigger ones battering me...
Phone me later when you ain't playing Xbox.
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.
Don't answer those names no more. it's Probs and Mayhem.
Fam, we saw the aliens.
They ran past us, straight.
We got tools.
- Let us roll with you, man.
- That's not real, is it?
- Jesus, he looks about six.
- I'm nine and a half.
- That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
- Hey, leave it!
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.
Just stay inside tonight, get me?
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.
You really think they'll die if you shoot water at them?
Ain't water in it. Is it?
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.
And, look, that one's bleedin'.
And that woman, I don't even know her.
I'm not getting myself involved in a situation I don't need to be in.
It's my house, Dimples.
Come.
Get off me, man.
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.
This ain't London-wide.
This is localized.
- Yeah, localized in your head.
- Localized in your dreams.
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters killing everyone? Uh-uh.
- Maybe they only fell on these ends.
- Please!
What kind of alien, out of all the places in the whole wide world, would invade some shitty council estate in South London?
- One that's looking for a fight.
- They're coming for us. Ready or not.
♪ Ready or not, here I come
♪ You can't hide
- Excuse me.
♪ They're gonna find you
Listen to me!
There's a dead one in my living room.
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.
Moses, when did you start going out with your maths teacher?
- How d'you know that woman?
- We met earlier.
He mugged me.
- Whey! For real?
- That part I believe.
That true? You rob that woman?
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg and we saved her from the monster.
So... we're mates now and it's all sweet.
- We're heroes, innit?
- Heroes?
Five of you and a knife against one woman? Fuck off!
Raah. Cold.
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv. it weren't all that.
- We never even touched you.
- The blade was to get it over with quick.
- We was as scared as you.
- Blade?
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed or beaten up or gettin' arrested?
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.
Think the police will help them?
They might not arrest you, but they'll arrest them.
For the murder of two police officers, vehicle theft, resisting arrest - everything that happened everywhere in the ends tonight.
They arrest us for nothing already.
You know what I reckon, yeah?
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.
Government probably bred those creatures to kill black boys.
First they sent drugs to the ends, then they sent guns.
Now they sent monsters to get us.
They don't care, man.
We ain't killin' each other fast enough, so they decided to speed up the process.
Believe.
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.
Excuse me, but what is that?
Oh, my days!
- You can't take two, fam.
- Watch me.
Shit. It is a toy!
Help! Hey, Moses!
Dennis!
- Moses.
- It's coming for you, Moses!
Oi, you fucker!
Tia, what you doing?
Back!
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!
- Don't stop!
- Harder! Cut him!
Kill him! Harder!
Oh, Shit!
Yo, youngers, wagwan?
- Nothing much.
- All right.
Nice weapons. Who you flghtin'?
- Aliens.
- Is it?
- Seen that yout Moses lately?
- Who wants to know?
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So, where's he at?
You know that little one you killed before?
That was a mistake.
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.
Actions have consequences, you know.
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.
Stay away from us, Moses.
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.
- Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
- I ain't going nowhere.
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.
Come on!
Come on!
Easy kill.
Run, man! Come on!
- What are you waiting for?
- Shit!
Open the door! Go!
Wagwan, its young Den.
If it's girls, leave a message.
Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.
Everyone's come down to back us, blood, but no one can get inside.
Feds have the block on lockdown.
You've got one minute remaining.
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.
I need to make a break for it.
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?
Aargh!
Hey, what the fuck, man!
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?
Better get the next one, blood.
Go, man!
- Who was that?
- That's Hi-Hatz.
- Man's a sausage.
- Why is he shooting at us?
His best friend got ate and he's a bit vexed.
I know exactly how he feels.
Would someone please tell me what the fuck is going on?
What's chasing you? Why is the other lift full of bits of dead people?
What? We need to go down.
I ain't going down. There's too many things down there out to get me.
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters and fucked-up monsters down there.
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?
- We're going to Ron's weed room.
- What's Ron's weed room?
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. it's good.
- it's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
- Plan.
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.
This is long, man. They've all gone.
No, they ain't. Check it.
- Down the end.
- Raah.
I am too high for this shit.
Trust.
- I wanna shoot those things, man.
- Same here, bruv.
- Times three.
- Done now.
- Bangers, man, bangers!
- I'm Brewis, by the way.
- Sam.
- Front pocket, man.
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.
- What about you?
- I live here.
Really?
Wicked.
I'm set.
Lights. Stay close.
Go. Go, go.
- Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
- Wait for me.
Fire in the hole.
Get the fuck off me, man.
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!
Jerome, where are you, man?
Jerome!
Jerome! Where you at?
Jerome!
Jerome?
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.
Pest? Moses?
Pest! Moses!
- Aaarghh!
- Jerome, where you at?
- Oi, lights, man, lights!
- Trying to find 'em, man.
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.
Are you there, man?
They're coming up the stairs, quick.
Jerome?
Help! Help!
- Aargh!
- Follow me!
They got Jerome. Moses!
They took him!
They took Jerome!
- Man!
- Oh!
What the fuck was that for?
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!
Moses!
- Yo, Ron! Ron!
- Ron, man, let us in!
- Ron!
- Open the door, man!
- Hey, let us in, man!
- Hey, open the door!
- All right?
- We need to hide in your weed room.
It's the only safe place left in the block.
I don't know about that.
- Ah, come on! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.
Come on.
Wagwan, Moses?
Sorry.
- You killed that thing.
- Hi-Hatz, bruv...
- You brought it in the ends.
- I don't want no trouble.
You brought fed in the ends.
Listen to me, bruv.
You brought an alien invasion to the ends.
Shit.
Behind you, bruv.
- Don't chat me.
- I'm not even lyin'.
Shut up!
I was gonna make you.
Now... I'm gonna dead you.
This is my block. Get me?
Not really.
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.
Wish we never murked you.
I wish I never took that white off Hi-Hatz.
Wish I'd just gone home and played FIFA like Biggz said.
Anyone got skins?
No.
Bare weed and no skins.
This is my worst nightmare.
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.
If... If we knew you, we wouldn't have stepped you.
It would have been OK to mug me if I didn't live here? Is that how it works?
Boy, you's tetchy.
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.
You're quite fit, you know.
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yeah.
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?
Cos he ain't exactly looking after you tonight.
- He's in Ghana.
- You go out with an African man?
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.
Oh, is it?
Why can't he help the children of Britain?
Not exotic enough, is it?
Don't get no nice suntan.
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.
It's glowing in the UV light.
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.
Maybe it's a what now?
Er... it's an eco-hormone that triggers a social response in members of the same species.
Maybe that's a female and the others are male, and that... that... that stuff is what's attracting them here.
They're smelling us.
They fell out of the sky, yeah?
Well, maybe they like drift through space on... on solar winds, like spores, and... whatever planet they land on first, the female leaves a pheromone trail for the males to follow it, find it, breed, et cetera.
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.
Some fucking funny-looking moth.
Yeah.
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it and it seems to be piquing the interest of a rather hostile alien species.
Just saying, maybe if you took those clothes off, they wouldn't know you were there, we were here.
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?
No, I'm trying to save your life.
And in answer to your question earlier...
Ah, thank fuck.
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.
Yo, Brewis.
Everyone who touched this thing got murked, you know -
Dennis...
Jerome...
Tonks... them feds when they tried touch me, everyone who had that scent on them.
So if they follow the smell on that, then...
...maybe I can lead 'em.
- Lead them where?
- Somewhere I can blow them up.
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.
I've gotta finish what I started.
- What if it jumps at us?
- Then throw the banger.
- What if I miss?
- Then we run.
What if it kills us?
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem if you keep on acting like such a pussy.
I'm telling the truth! I know I lied to you before, but it's for real this time, I swear!
...I'm calling your dad. You hear me?
Throw it, throw it, throw it!
Now, now, do it!
- Are you even listening?
- Mum, I gotta go.
Just do as I say and stay indoors.
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.
- I love you, Mum. I love you.
- Five minutes!
- Any time, blood. Any time.
- We don't give a fuck, man.
Armed police. Stay where you are!
Fuck.
- Wagwan, Biggz.
- What are you doing?
- Armed police, fam.
- Swear down?
Swear down.
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.
Probs and Mayhem, right?
Yeah.
You look clean.
You look good.
I'm betting my life we're right about this.
Believe me, I'd go out there myself if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.
Likewise.
- One floor down. 191.
- One floor down. 191.
- You bell me when you get there.
- Yeah.
Yo, Pest, give me that ring.
What ring, man?
Oh, man, that's ours.
- it's worth bare P, man.
- Give it!
Raasclaat, man.
Thanks.
Even if you outrun them, even if you make it, how are you gonna get out?
Don't worry about me, man.
You don't have to do this, Moses.
Yeah, I do.
Oi. Hi.
Is it safe?
No. All right. Good luck.
- Are you sure no one's here?
- Yeah.
Who do you live with?
Just my uncle.
Where's he?
Comes and goes.
Goes, mostly.
You got a little brother?
No.
- How old are you?
You look older.
Thanks.
Shut the hatch.
Lock the window.
Leave the front door on the latch.
Turn all the gas all the way up.
Get out the block as fast as you can.
You hear me?
Good luck, Moses.
Later.
Moses versus the monsters.
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.
Allow it.
- Is that Moses?
- Moses!
Moses.
- Oh, shit.
- Is that more of the monsters?
Sort of.
Armed police! Put your weapons down!
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!
Armed police! Drop your weapon!
Hands on head!
Drop your weapon now!
- Get off me!
- This one?
Aaargh, get off.
Get off me. Aaargh.
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.
- I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
- I don't even live here.
I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.
What's your number?
What's your number, huh?
I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.
Get off me!
Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.
He's a hero. He's a legend.
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.
- Call me.
- Yo, Moses.
Hey, Moses. Moses.
Why do you always arrest the wrong people?
Moses is a hero, don't you get it?
He saved the block.
Excuse me, sir.
This is Samantha Adams, the woman that called in the mugging.
Miss Adams, I believe you were out with two of my officers earlier tonight?
- You know they lost their lives?
- Yeah. I was there.
We were attacked.
Those boys there, the ones you're arresting...
Can you confirm it was them?
Don't let them intimidate you, miss.
No. I know them. They're my neighbours.
They protected me.
Yo, Moses. Hey, Moses.
Moses! Moses! Moses!
Moses! Moses! Moses!
Get off!
Moses! Moses! Moses!
Brap! Brap!
Brap! Brap! Brap!
Brap! Brap! Brap!
Moses, bruv.
Can you hear that?
Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses!
That's for you, man.

...stopping it has tested the limits of human technology.
That's why just after the rig sank,
I assembled a team...
...of our nation's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge...
Step up. Watch your head.
Step up. Watch your head.
Let me see your hand.
Finally, Peter.
Welcome.
Let's gather round. Take a seat.
First I'd like to say welcome to our new members.
As is our custom, they have been preparing on the outside for some time...
...but now we feel they are ready to graduate...
...and to join us.
So let me introduce Peter and his girlfriend, Lorna.
And this is Christine and her husband, Lam.
Now, let me say a word to you new folk.
No sudden movements.
And no questions for tonight.
The first night is always the most difficult.
But as our other members here can attest...
...an unforgettable experience.
Okay.
Maggie.
Hi.
It's nice to see new faces.
Thank you all for taking the precautions to come here.
It shows you have a great deal of faith.
Now let me return that trust...
...in telling you my story.
Like anything new...
...it will be impossible for your mind to digest.
Maybe close your eyes.
Try Opening up. Here.
Try listening from your heart.
Two years ago, I woke up underwater.
It was a bathtub, filled about three-quarters high.
I was gasping for breath.
Coughing up...
...snorting out this water.
I felt this...
...terrible sense of loss.
Like when you wake up from dreaming about someone you love so much.
And you turn around in bed and remember...
...that they've been dead for years.
What was I doing in that motel room?
I remembered my name, my birthday.
October 31st.
Nothing else.
I ended up out on the streets.
As people with no ID...
...no money...
...no memories do.
I felt really lonely.
And exhausted all the time.
My immune system was gone.
At that time, my legs and my right arm would fall asleep.
Like in meditation, you know, but for hours.
And I couldn't wake them up.
They were strangers to me.
And I couldn't remember anything.
But I still had to wake up every day, still had to keep going.
I had no idea who I was or what I was doing here.
And that's when Klaus found me.
He had heard about me from others.
Had heard of my tattoos.
And he took me in.
And he fed me.
And he gave me vitamins.
In about three or four weeks...
...I started to remember things.
Many terrible things.
Violent images.
I was so angry.
I thought I'd lost my mind.
And then Klaus explained it to me.
My tattoos. This failing body.
The things I'd remembered.
What it all meant.
Open your eyes.
I wanna show you something.
You see, the anchor is the sign of a traveler.
And the number 54 refers to where I come from.
You see, I come from 54.
Your future.
Did we get anything?
Nothing. Static.
We didn't get a single frame?
We went out of range.
Damn it.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're, like, shaking.
I'm not shaking, Peter. I'm a little racy.
It's just a bunch of crap, Lorna.
Yeah, I know.
They're weak and they're looking for meaning.
Yeah.
You know, those people are suckers.
That's it.
But what if she is?
What? From the future?
Uh, no one is from the future, Lorna.
Well, then who is she?
She's a con artist. She's dangerous.
That's why we gotta make this film.
We have to expose her before she has all those people kill themselves.
I've gotta take a leak.
Are you okay?
You don't wanna come with me'?
Peter Aitken likes math, reason, himself.
Things he can count on.
When Peter was 12, his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
A longtime member of a New Age cult...
...she believed that modern medicine shouldn't intervene in her fate.
She died on the eve of Peter's birthday, while they were both asleep.
Peter awoke 13 and motherless.
We began by preparing on the outside...
...meeting at weekly intervals...
...at the West Court shopping strip mall...
...with 20 other new recruits that were eventually weeded down.
Couldn't tell the exact location of the house.
By my count, we were in the van for approximately 20 minutes...
...but it's possible that they were giving us the runaround, so...
He)'
He)'
To see her is to believe her.
But of course, that's how these cons work.
Even if the new recruits doubt her story, they'll be back for more.
I'm trying to work. Please?
Maggie says that the future is already written...
...and that her members are the chosen ones.
Peter Aitken signing off.
Good morning, everybody.
Uh, Miss Parker had her baby, so she will be out for a couple months.
And that means you guys are stuck with me, Mr. Aitken.
So, what will it be, ladies?
We have the American Civil War or the anatomy of a cell?
Lorna?
Lorna.
- Lorna.
- What?
Lorna Michaelson.
Daughter of Hollywood producer
Isaac Michaelson...
...and Allie Bernard, the British model turned actress.
Lorna was left to an unchaperoned adolescence of movie premieres...
...and club openings.
Lorna had her first hangover at 12, her first intervention at 16.
By 23 she was burnt out, tired of playing entourage.
So Lorna cleaned up her act.
Tequila shots replaced with wheatgrass shots.
But in the end, it was one addiction traded for another.
Lorna.
Watch your head.
Shake it out. Shake it out now.
You are fools.
Your muscles are tight with repressed feelings.
Who you were before is irrelevant.
Let go of you, become the group.
I have to exhaust you people...
...to get you to stop thinking and start breathing.
Don't be worried.
Maggie's tests will get harder.
But if you pass, then you're meant to be with us.
Then you will be ready when it begins.
This is where we grow Maggie's food.
Go on, pick one.
Okay.
Are you good?
Yeah, fine. Do it.
Just think about Maggie.
She's allergic to absolutely everything in this time period.
You can eat these?
Of course you can, kiddo. Heh.
It's the grocery store you've gotta be wary of.
Produce grown by someone you've never met...
...sitting in trucks for weeks...
...sprayed with, I don't know, who knows what.
Yeah, but these aren't exactly natural either.
Well, true. But Maggie says when prices go up...
...people will start growing gardens in their garages.
We'll be all right though.
Maggie's taking us to a safe place.
Maggie? Are you dying?
Yeah.
So are you. So is PJ.
Joanne's dying. Peter's dying.
Lorna's dying.
Every life is a death.
And most deaths are suicides.
Some are more gradual than others, like cancer after years of smoking.
Or in my case...
...traveling back in time to save the people you love.
Even if you kiss him as you leave the room
And even if we don't say a word
In front of them
And even if we never get to show our friends
- Is that Abigail Pritchett?
- At least three episodes a week.
Maybe she has narcolepsy.
She's always in that hat.
Okay, I bring you some hot milk. Okay?
Can you look at me for a second there, Lorna?
Hello, Peter.
Hmm.
Okay. Well, this transmitter records everything from the camera...
...but would go out of range outside of 50 feet.
So how in the world do we bring this with us?
Peter. No way.
Well, people need to see this.
People need to see a video of Maggie.
Peter, that's too big to swallow.
Don't swallow that.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Eat this.
Give it some padding so it won't tear you up on the way out.
Are you okay?
Not sure.
Yeah. Ahem.
Close your eyes.
Go backwards to childhood.
Travel back to a time before words.
Are you there?
What does it smell like?
What does it taste like?
How do you feel?
Now live there.
Okay, come back to me.
Come back to the present.
Now you can eat your apple.
Do you know what's in that apple?
Logic.
Bitterness.
It's intellectual bullshit.
You've already eaten the apple.
That's what it means to grow up.
The question is...
...how much of it can you get rid of?
The apple is in you.
Like the fear is in you.
It's spreading throughout your body like a virus.
How can we purge ourselves of shame...
...of self-hatred...
...and rise to our callings as chosen ones?
You all have the privilege of knowing the future.
But are you gonna be ready for it?
Pathetic.
See how committed Christine is.
You're purifying yourself.
Preparing to receive your destiny.
Feels good to be rid of the apple, doesn't it?
Peter, there's no rush. We'll wait for you.
Thanks, but I can't throw up. Uh...
Never have, not even as a kid. $0...
All the more reason to let go now.
Just let it go, Peter.
Just relax.
And let it come up and out.
- Lorna.
- Sit down.
Lorna's fine.
She's just protecting you.
Do you wanna be a cripple for life, Peter?
You're letting her be your crutch.
Do you like being lame?
Ask yourself...
...why do I like being lame?
Ask yourself.
Ask yourself now. Say it.
Say, "Why do I like being lame?"
Um...
Why do I like being lame?
That's a good question.
Why do you like being lame?
I don't know.
Liar.
You do know.
We don't have anywhere to go.
Do we?
No.
We'll all just sit here breathing in the smell of everyone's puke until you can talk.
Because I don't wanna face myself.
Okay. Why?
Because I might not...
I might not like what I see.
What do you see?
Weakness.
Tell me something I don't already know.
You wanna know what I see?
An anal-retentive prick.
Who can't dance, who can't breathe.
Stop it.
Can't make his girlfriend come...
...because he's so self-involved.
Who took your power away from you?
Who made you feel so powerless you've become obsessed with control?
With thinking everything through instead of feeling anything.
Who?
Who hurt you so much you never wanna feel that way again?
Was it your father?
Was it your mother?
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking cunt.
What are you hiding from me, Peter?
She abandon you?
She leave you to start another family?
Was she a whore?
I'll hit you.
I'll hit you in the face.
What'd she do to make you so angry?
Shut up. This is so stupid.
What'd she do to you?
What'd she do to you?
She gave up.
She died.
I was a kid. And she died.
She's dead. Everybody happy?
What happened next?
You live with your dad?
Did you live in a foster home?
No.
Who took care of you?
My grandparents.
I see.
You were a good-looking kid, weren't you?
You're handsome now.
But you must have been beautiful then.
You were in a new house.
A new bedroom.
You felt abandoned.
Angry. Unloved.
Did he come to you at night?
No, of course not.
She watched him like a hawk, didn't she?
He wait for you after school?
You were all alone.
Fresh as the fallen snow.
And he knew.
Did he make you swallow his poison?
You were powerless then.
But you're not anymore.
You can let go of it, here, with us.
Peter.
It's not my choice, it's yours.
Let it go.
You're brave.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. I know that we just wanna start our day...
...but if we don't talk about it...
Talk about what?
What do you wanna talk about?
I don't know. I mean...
I guess I've never seen you cry.
Those weren't real tears.
But they weren't fake.
Yes, they were. They were fake tears.
She's a megalomaniac, Lorna.
She knew things about you.
No. She didn't know anything about me.
She asked questions about me.
She wanted to be right and I let her think she was.
So all that stuff was--?
It was not true.
Come on. Of course it wasn't true.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry If I scared you...
...but I had to do what I had to do to get us out of there.
Peter, I just feel like we're in over our heads with this whole thing, you know?
It's like we started out wanting to make a documentary on cults.
And now we're in one?
Yeah. That's investigative journalism.
She's dangerous, Peter.
You said that yourself.
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go back to our normal lives.
That's fine. We can do that.
I can teach all day.
You can stay home and write and surf the web.
And on the weekends we can get wasted at various art installations...
...or sneak forties into random foreign films.
And then it's suddenly, like, we wake up and, whoops, where did our 20s go?
But somewhere in the Valley...
...there is a woman living in a basement who claims to be from the future.
She's actually amassing followers.
These people who believe that she'll lead them to salvation or whatever.
And, yes, she's dangerous...
...but we have to see this thing through all the way or we're chumps.
Don't you wanna do something that matters?
Yes.
Let's do it.
We're a team.
We're a team?
Oh, we are totally a team.
I'm doing this with you.
Yeah.
So after my husband up and left me...
...I wore the same pair of sweatpants for two years.
It was Maggie who got me to see that humans belong in the woods...
...and not in condos.
Yeah. I'm glad that you called.
This is good.
Yeah, it feels good, don't it?
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.
After you.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go in all the way because I have to be back.
Oh, come on, you'll like this.
Come on.
I do the La Brea Tar Pits field trip.
I said, you wanna run a trip, you do the paperwork yourself, like everyone else.
Trying to steal my trip.
Give me that!
Heidi, Stop it. What in the world?
Heidi, I said stop it. Get off.
She ruined my backpack. It's new.
Get back to work. Get back to work.
The show is over.
What's happened here?
My backpack. She wrote.
You okay?
Here. I'll help you up.
Joanne?
I need to get back.
We're here.
Can't turn around now.
Here.
Why do you have a gun?
Joanne. This is weird, okay?
Hey.
I would just like to go.
Okay. Calm down.
Trust, Lorna. It is very important that we trust each other.
We're family now.
First rule.
Always treat a gun as if it's loaded, even if it's not.
Always keep it pointed down.
That's how you keep from killing somebody or yourself.
Okay, you try it-
I'd rather just watch you.
Come on.
Don't be silly. I loaded it for you.
Yeah, but I just don't feel comfortable.
Nonsense. It's important.
Okay. Legs apart-
Come on.
Okay, now remember...
...push with the right hand, pull with the left.
Okay? Keeps you steady-
Hi.
I texted you.
My phone died.
You wanna make huevos rancheros?
So, what happened with Joanne?
Oh, my God. She took me on a hike through the woods...
...to this shooting range.
But it turns out I'm actually pretty good at it.
Uh, why is Joanne teaching you how to shoot a gun?
I don't know, fun?
That's fun?
What do you think?
I don't know what to think.
That's the problem.
We don't know who these people are, what they're capable of.
What's this "safe place" that Maggie keeps talking about bringing us to?
Um, I was just wondering.
What's it gonna be like when the civil war starts?
Things come together.
And they fall apart.
It's a really dark time.
My generation is really comfortable with death.
And people die around you all the time.
But there's still beauty.
Especially when people start moving to the countryside.
There's dancing and theater.
Lovemaking.
Are there still, like, CDs or MP3s or something?
Um...
Not everybody has access to that kind of technology...
...so there's not as many recorded albums...
...but there's a lot of live music.
But every once in a while...
...a song will come along that moves everyone.
And that finds a way of getting around.
Even without MP3s.
Will you sing us something from your time?
- No.
- Come on.
- I don't sing.
- Come on, please?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just one song.
- We wanna hear the future.
- You wanna what the future--?
- Yeah.
- What the future sounds like?
Uh...
Okay.
Uh...
This song was really popular right before I left.
I'm so sorry. I can't. Sorry.
We'll close our eyes.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
Oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
For what I couldn't find
Totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me
Do you wanna try singing the last with me?
It goes:
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
In all my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
- Thanks.
- Yeah. That was good.
Maggie?
I, uh... I mean no disrespect.
But that song, you know--
I'm sure you know, is by The Cranberries.
It was from, like, the '90s.
The 1990s.
Oh, that could be.
I wouldn't know because I wasn't alive in the '90s.
In the future, it's made famous by a singer named Benetton.
Can you tell us something from the future that we could prove?
Something soon.
Huh.
When were you born?
Seventy-nine.
Okay.
Prove to me that you were alive in the '80s.
Tell me something that happened in the spring of 1959.
What?
I was born in 2030.
You're asking me to tell you something that happens in 2010.
That's twenty years before I'm born.
So I'm asking you to do the same.
Tell me something that happens in the spring of 1959.
Uh...
- Kennedy was assassinated.
- In 1963.
That's four years from 1959.
You want me to tell you something you can prove in 2014?
Would that make you happy?
What will you do with yourself until then?
I could tell you a major event a few years off.
And after that it's gonna be event after event after event.
But a mind as narrow as yours...
...would have no idea what to do with that information.
You may go now, Lam.
I was just... I didn't--
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Christine, you're gonna have to decide what you wanna do here.
Christie.
Christie, she's lying. It's obvious.
You're all crazy!
I can't get that song out of my head.
Ah, neither can I.
If you were gonna pick a song to be from the future...
...why would it be "Dreams" by The Cranberries?
Remove Peter's restraints, please.
If you'll come with me, please, Peter,
Maggie will see you.
Just Peter, Lorna.
Okay.
I'll wait here.
No need. We'll drive you home.
Enter.
You can sit down.
Ah.
I'm from the future. I'm not a saint.
Are you and Lorna happy here with us?
Yes.
Yes. Of course we are.
People leave.
Other people I kick out...
...because they're sick or lazy.
You're neither one of those, are you?
No. No, I'm not.
Do you know why
I kicked Lam out?
Because he questioned you?
No.
I'm not petty.
I don't really care if people believe me.
I don't know that I would if I was in their shoes.
Well, why'd you kick him out?
Because I knew Christine growing up.
But I never saw Lam.
I don't think he belonged with us.
Are Lorna and I there?
That's for you to decide.
We wanna be there.
Will you do me a favor?
Anything.
Yeah?
This is Abigail Pritchett.
I don't understand.
I need you to bring her to me.
Uh... Are you joking?
What would you want with an 8-year-old girl?
Don't worry about that.
Well, there's no way that I'm bringing a little girl into this basement. That's...
Then perhaps you and Lorna should stay away from this basement as well.
You don't mean that.
I need to see Abigail Pritchett.
Why?
Bring her to me and stay, or don't and go.
There has to be something else
I can do to prove my loyalty.
There isn't.
It has to cost something to be worth something.
You are asking me to kidnap an 8-year-old child.
Not kidnap.
I could get fired or arrested.
I need to know why.
How? She's important.
She's a very bright little girl.
What do you want with her?
Just to see her.
For what?
Because I need to.
Need to?
Who is she?
Abigail Pritchett is my mother.
Okay.
Time for bed.
Come on.
Come on.
That's okay. Come on.
Okay.
So?
So...
She wants me to bring her one of my students.
Wait. What?
Yeah.
Abigail Pritchett.
Did she say why?
Yeah.
Maggie claims that the girl is her mom.
Well, how did they even know that you worked at the school?
I don't know. I must have mentioned it.
I think we should go to the police.
Police?
Yeah.
Yeah. Um, hello, Officer Randal.
Yes? Hello.
I'd like to report a time-traveler...
...living in a basement somewhere.
I don't know where exactly.
They want you to bring them an 8-year-old.
That's kidnapping.
I know that and I'd be the one doing it.
So, what are they gonna arrest her for?
Soliciting blood?
Okay. So you're--?
All right, let me get this straight.
So you're actually considering bringing them the girl?
No. No.
Are you?
No, no, no.
It's a test. If we don't do this, they're gonna kick us out.
Are you listening to yourself?
You always do this.
What do I always do?
What are you talking about?
You sign up for things and then you bail when the going gets rough.
What are you talking about?
You. About finishing what we started.
You start novels you never finish.
Take pictures you never develop.
Finish what you fucking start.
You fucking started this.
I'm willing to go all the way.
How far are you gonna go?
And how are you any different from your mother?
That's a cheap shot.
Yeah?
Not if it had been delivered by Maggie.
Oh, come on.
What?
I see the way that you look at her, Peter.
Pssh. You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not.
Are you jealous of that fraud?
Why not?
She's beautiful.
Mesmerizing.
In 15 minutes she brought you to an emotional orgasm...
...that I've never seen in three years, Peter.
"Emotional orgasm"? What the fuck is that?
You tell me.
You people. You people make me laugh.
Who is "you people"?
You people...
...Who spend a fucking fortune on therapy.
You could use some.
Rehab. You think because you put in these man-hours...
...you're somehow entitled to a degree in psychology?
You're now this expert?
When the truth is, after all those hours, you fuckups are just arriving at the place...
...the rest of us have been at all our lives.
You know what I think, Peter?
I think it's you who's the fuckup.
You haven't logged tapes or captured any fucking footage in weeks.
Yeah. You don't give a shit about making this documentary.
This is about Maggie.
You're willing to do anything for her.
You just said that yourself.
So you know what?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
I'm gonna help you pack.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Get out!
I'm sorry.
We make a horrible team.
Either you stay or you go
But you can't stand there no more
My heart is burning but I
I know I started to cry
And even when I get home
I can still smell you in my clothes
And I won't pack them away
I stutter, I stutter
But just not today
Klaus, it's Peter.
Tell Maggie I'll do it.
It can't be as bad as all that.
You wanna talk about it?
No.
Thank you.
He'll come around.
You're the type of girl you try to get to marry if you can.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know about all that.
Lorna?
How do you know my name?
I think I can help you restore him to his senses.
You know her as Maggie.
Her real name is Shelly Whipple.
And who are you?
Carol Briggs, with the Justice Department.
Maggie's wanted in Sacramento for armed robbery...
...and in Fresno for arson.
That's why she never leaves the basement.
Lorna, you are in a unique position here.
You can wash your hands of all of this, which is what most people would do.
But I don't think you're like most people.
Why are you coming to me?
I mean, why not Peter?
We need a level head.
Someone to be our eyes and ears.
Look, I'll tell you what I know, okay, but it's not much.
Lorna, we believe Maggie is arming.
Unwitting or not, her subjects are being fashioned into a militia.
I'm not walking back into a snake pit.
All you have to do is help us lure the snake out.
I'm sorry. I am done.
Have they asked for a kid?
Yeah, a little girl.
That's part of their con.
Did they say what they wanted her for?
Maggie says it's her mother.
That's a good one.
Can you keep a secret from Peter?
Then I'll tell you what they really want her for.
I figured it out.
Hi. You scared me.
We do it in a public place.
Do what?
You bring Maggie the girl.
But you don't bring the girl to the basement.
You arrange a meeting in a place where we could set up cameras beforehand.
What made you change your mind?
You were right.
I think we should finish what we started.
I mean, we wanted to make a documentary...
...and what better climax than for Maggie to meet her mother?
Come on.
We'll be late.
Are you all right, Lorna?
Yeah.
I'm just hungry.
My dad used to say that the hardest thing for humans is transition.
We're survivors.
We can live in conditions beyond your wildest imagination.
You guys have been fasting for a week.
Some of you have cheated.
You're only cheating yourselves.
In the future, food is scarce...
...and real hunger will be a part of life.
I have food for you.
You don't have to eat it.
But trust me that the thought of eating it...
...is much scarier than the reality.
The ones who will not only survive but will thrive...
...are the ones who realize that there's nothing to be afraid of.
O'Shea, you want something to eat?
It's just new to you.
Food that moves.
Lorna?
I'm vegan.
Fair enough.
Pete r?
Mel.
Very soon this group is gonna begin its journey.
I won't be with you.
What? Where are you going?
It's just change.
And you guys are gonna be fine.
And...
...if you allow yourself...
...to get quiet now and again...
...to really be still...
...you will hear the sound of my voice.
Next Friday, there's a class field trip.
You know Maggie can't leave.
The microorganisms of our time are too intense for her immune system.
She's lived on the outside before.
Yes, and it nearly killed her.
Well, it's the best I can do.
Bring Maggie to the La Brea Tar Pits at 1 p.m. next Friday...
...I'll bring you Abigail Pritchett.
Mrs. Dewitt is unable to make it in today.
So Mr. Aitken will be chaperoning your trip to the La Brea Tar Pits.
I hope to hear good things from him.
Guys.
Okay, everybody chill out. Chill out, guys.
Sandra.
When you see Peter leave with Abby, text "hi."
You'll receive a "hi" back and Andy will come and chaperone the class.
Then you, you need to follow Peter at a distance.
When Maggie arrives, text a smiley face.
Be sure to keep your phone with you.
That's how we know where you are.
And they know not to harm Peter, right?
No one's gonna harm anyone.
Most likely you won't even see Maggie.
We'll be sure to take her on entry.
Peter will never know that you were involved.
Happy endings for all.
When we say "prehistoric," we mean "pre-writing"...
...a time before man could record his written experience.
And in 3500 BC, which was only about 5000 years ago...
...the written language and thus man's recorded history began.
I wanna go back inside.
Just a second.
What am I being punished for?
Nothing.
Nothing, okay? You're not in trouble.
Okay. Listen, can you keep a secret?
My friend Maggie, she is an actress...
...and she wants to hang out with kids...
...because she is going to be playing a mother, right?
So she just wants somebody that she can, you know, play pretend with.
And I picked you.
I hope you don't mind.
Is she on TV?
Where's Maggie?
Go out the side entrance with Abby.
You'll receive a call with instructions.
No.
No way. This is not what we agreed to.
Tell Maggie that it has to be here or nothing.
I'll chaperone your class.
Take off your shoes.
Lorna's watching the class.
That's not the issue.
Take off your shoes.
Don't take those off, Abby.
I wanna meet Maggie.
No, you don't.
This is not what we agreed to.
You have half an hour till your bus boards.
Maggie's gonna get what she wants, with or without you.
Come on.
Why do we take off our shoes?
Shh. We gotta keep quiet now, okay?
This is not what we agreed to.
This is not--
Yeah. Yeah, I see it. I see the...
Don't be scared.
Why would I be scared?
Don't come any closer.
Okay, I'm ready. Just the girl.
If I take off my shawl, will you take off your hat?
How do you know my secret handshake?
You taught it to me.
- Shelly Whipple, you're under arrest.
- What?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used...
...against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided.
Wait.
She's sick, you bastards!
- Come on.
- Let her go! Let her go!
What did you do, Peter?
Traitor.
You traitor.
Let's go call the attorney.
Who is she?
I don't know.
Peter.
It's not my choice.
It's yours.
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night
Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd
Open your arms
I want to be found
Maybe I'm calling your name in the night
Open our eyes
We'll feel with our sight
A Want is a lack but also desire
A need can be nothing
But should be held higher
A need is a want wearing disguise
It can be confused if fueled by desire
Baby, I'm calling your name in the night
No reason with need
Look into my eyes
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of bugs that don't bite
My friend once told me
Something so right
He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
TARS: Mars,
so you name it, and think that you know it.
The Red Planet.
No air, no life.
But you do not know Mars, for its true name is Barsoom.
And it is not airless, nor is it dead,
but it is dying.
The city of Zodanga saw to that.
Zodanga, the predator city,
moving, devouring,
draining Barsoom of energy and life.
Only the great city of Helium dared resist, stood strong,
matched Zodanga airship for airship,
holding fast for a thousand years.
Until one day the ruler of Zodanga
became cornered in a sandstorm.
And everything changed.
I need clean lights!
Full loft, aye!
Full loft!
Intensity full!
- Hard turn! Come about!
- Facing new plot!
No time! Hard turn now!
There!
- Shadow!
- Shadow!
Death to Helium!
Being a fool is a great luxury, Sab Than.
Get up.
Who... What are you?
We serve the Goddess.
And she has chosen you to receive this weapon.
Do as we command and you will rule all of Barsoom.
With none to defy you.
And nothing to stand in your way.
New York City, 1881
- Ma'am.
Ten words a minimum.
That's 50 cents, unless you want special delivery.
Special delivery it is.
Name of sender?
Carter.
John Carter.
CONDUCTOR: Croton-on-Hudson!
Mr. Burroughs? I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton, your uncle's attorney.
My deepest sympathies.
His death came as a shock to all of us.
He was a model of health and vigor.
He just dropped dead in his study not five minutes after sending word for me and the doctor.
When I arrived he was already gone.
The man never stopped digging.
All over the world.
No soon he started digging one hole than he was off to Java or the Orkney Islands to dig another.
He said it was pure research, but it always seemed to me like he was looking for something.
Oh, and God grant me he's found it now.
Every inch a cavalry man, to the very end.
Mother always said that Jack never really came back from the war.
That it was only his body that went west.
He used to tell me the most wondrous stories.
I'd like to pay my respects.
DALTON: You won't find a keyhole.
Thing only opens from the inside.
He insisted.
No embalming, an open coffin, no funeral.
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us.
Come. Let's go inside.
"And lastly, I hereby direct"
"that my estate shall be held in trust for 25 years,"
"the income to benefit my beloved nephew,"
"Edgar Rice Burroughs,"
"at the end of which term the principal will revert to him."
"In full."
Of course I always adored him, but it's been so long.
Why me?
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.
It was his private journal.
He was most explicit that you, and only you, would read its contents.
Now, you might possibly find some kind of explanation in here.
I'll leave you now.
Again, my condolences.
JOHN: My dear Edgar,
I remember how
I used to take you on my knee
and tell you wild tales,
which you always did me the great courtesy of believing.
Now you are grown.
Time and space have parted us,
but I reach out across that distance
to that same wide-eyed boy
and ask him to believe me once more.
This wild tale begins 13 years ago
in the Arizona Territory
between the Pinaleño Mountains
and the backside of hell.
Fort Grant Outpost, 1868
Ah.
Coming to load up on spider bait.
No more, Carter.
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?
- Yes, you're a goddamn loon!
I done took all your money, Carter.
Your tab's $100 in arrears.
I'll pray.
This old Yavapai I met said he'd seen a cave...
No. Stop! Not one more word about your cave of gold.
MAN 2: Oh, now, now.
Show some respect!
It's the evil spider cave of gold.
You're cutoff, Carter.
Now get on home.
MAN 1: Now, I do believe he done told you to get on out of here.
I'll leave when these bags are full.
I found that two days ago up by Bonita.
That ought to cover my tab and then some.
Beans.
The first item is beans.
SERGEANT: John Carter?
Your presence is requested up at the fort.
I suggest you come peaceably.
Do you, now?
You are a difficult man to find,
Captain John Carter.
First Virginia Cavalry,
Army of Northern Virginia,
Confederate States of America.
I'm Colonel Powell.
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry of the United States...
Excellent horseman.
Fine swordsman.
Decorated six times, including the Southern Cross of Honor.
At Five Forks, the company under your command nearly turned the tide.
In short, a born fighter.
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam, a necessary man for the defense of the Arizona Territory.
No.
Son, we are up to our chinstraps in Apaches.
Ain't my concern.
I believe it is your concern, Captain.
Folks are being attacked in their own homes. Slain.
You started it. You finish it.
You've gone native, have you?
Apaches can go to hell, too.
We're nothing but a warring species, and I want no part of it.
You're a cavalry man.
That makes you valuable to our country and our cause.
Colonel Powell, sir, whatever it is you suppose I owe you, our country or any other beloved cause,
I have already paid.
I have paid in full, sir.
So let me tell you what I will do.
I will break me out of this cell.
I will claim my gold and get filthy rich.
Rich enough to buy your flat, righteous blue behind just so I can kick it all day long.
Captain, I'm finding it difficult to reconcile the man on this piece of paper with the one I'm looking at.
I suggest you find the horse sense to accept my offer before I give in to my better judgment.
Private, the man stays in the bull pit till further notice.
Yes, sir!
WOMAN: John?
- John?
Sleepy-head.
Supper's waiting for you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! I gave you a bucket.
I ain't going to tell you again.
Use the...
PRIVATE: - Colonel Powell!
- Argh!
Colonel Powell!
Colonel Powell!
Colonel Powell!
Sir, he stole your horse.
No. Son of a...
Carter!
That's Domingo's band!
Shut your damn mouth, Corporal.
What's he saying, Carter?
The hell's he saying now?
What the hell's he saying, Carter?
- He's saying...
Carter!
Agh!
I thought you didn't care!
I don't!
Get up! Come on.
Give me a gun. Give me a gun!
I've got to look.
Cover me.
The spider.
POWELL: This place sure ain't Apache.
JOHN: It sure ain't.
Gold.
Carter!
Right behind you!
Carter!
(GROANS) Ock ohem ocktei wies
Barsoom.
- What?
- Barsoom.
Barsoom?
Oh, gee! (GRUNTS)
What the...
No, no, no!
Wha...
Where the hell am I?
What the...
...hell are you?
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot him!
We should kill it, Jeddak.
Move away.
Hello.
Don't run.
Don't run away.
Hello.
Don't run.
Alright.
Alright.
All right.
You've got me.
I surrender.
Jeddak.
- Jeddak?
- Jeddak.
Tars Tarkas.
Tars Tarkas?
Captain John Carter, Virginia.
Vorginia.
Vorginia!
No.
My name is John Carter.
I'm from Virginia.
Virginia.
Jump.
Jump like you jumped before.
(TRIES TO SPEAK LANGUAGE) Sack...
Jump, yeah?
Jump.
Sack.
Jump.
Sack.
Jump!
Yes, sir.
Virginia. Virginia.
Don't!
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
What is this place? Where am I?
It's alright, Virginia. Be still.
Where's my damn gold?
Eighteen have yet to hatch, Jeddak.
Then they are weak and not Thark.
Leave nothing for the white apes.
JOHN: - Where on Earth am I?
Barsoom, a world on the brink.
For Zodanga's new power threatens to destroy our city of Helium.
And if Helium falls, so does Barsoom.
Rubbish.
Goddess, help me, I'm hopeless.
I always come on too strong.
Your Highness.
My Jeddak.
My Jeddak.
After years of tireless research,
I present to you the answer.
I hope.
My Jeddak, after years of...
I'm sorry, Princess.
The presentation will have to wait.
- Father, what's happened?
- Dejah!
I know the terms set by Sab Than.
What I want to know is can we afford to reject them?
Admiral Kantos Kan.
The eastern border is a wasteland.
Sab Than has burned through our defenses,
and the border folk will be massacred.
Our best troops and fleetest ships
are proven less than useless and now comes word that our last remaining squadron has been lost.
Helium is lost.
My people.
I have failed them all.
DEJAH: No, my Jeddak, you haven't!
Forgive me, my lady, but you have not seen this weapon.
It radiates the most intense, baleful blue light.
When I read our reports on Sab Than's weapon, I knew.
Somehow that idiotic brute had discovered it first.
Discovered what?
The Ninth Ray.
Unlimited power.
Sab Than only uses it for slaughter.
But think of what Helium might accomplish with such power.
Transform the deserts, restore the seas.
Is this what you saw, Kantos?
It's starting to look very close.
Give it time.
It Will work.
(NINTH RAY CLATTERS
AND POWERS DOWN)
TARDOS: Everyone, leave us.
Dejah, ever since you were a little girl, you've always met the expectations placed on you.
It's Sab's terms.
What are they?
He will spare Helium if you accept his hand in marriage.
No!
He is a monster!
You must refuse him!
He's already on his way here.
But all of my work...
I just need a little more time.
- Dejah!
- How can you...
You can't just bow down to Zodanga!
A wedding will save the city.
Perhaps, but it could lose you Barsoom.
Dejah!
With no one to stop Zodanga, it will be the beginning of the end!
- We do not have the luxury...
- You are the Jeddak of Helium!
You must find another way!
There is no other way!
If there were,
I would risk anything to seize it.
This is the chance we have been given.
Perhaps it is the will of the Goddess.
No.
It is your will.
So, when I was little, and we would look up at the stars and you would tell me of the heroes whose glory was written in the sky, how there was a star up there for me, is this what you imagined would be written on it?
My Jeddak.
Sab Than's corsair approaches the city.
They signal for permission to land.
Granted.
And let us prepare ourselves for a wedding.
I have destroyed the device,
Matai Shang.
She was on the verge of discovery.
All is in place.
They will consent to the wedding.
Keep close watch over her.
We don't want anything to interfere with our next move.
Sarkoja!
Let Sola have a hatchling.
Sola can take the little white worm.
Be still.
Let go!
Be still!
What happened to you?
Be still.
(SOLA SHOUTING
IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Now we kill it.
Step away, Tal Hajus.
You prize this more highly than my judgment?
Step...
...away.
I claim the right of challenge!
And who supports your challenge?
Who will pledge their metal to mine?
You are blind as a white ape, Tal Hajus.
You will not rule today.
Not today.
See the prize your Jeddak has found!
Is it... a baby white ape?
No!
It is a rare and valuable animal!
It is called...
It is called... Virginia!
(ALL REPEAT) Virginia!
Watch. Everyone, step back.
Show them, Virginia.
Jump.
Jump!
By Issus, you will jump tomorrow, Virginia.
Sola, chain him.
Tell Sarkoja to initiate him with the other hatchlings.
Wait, wait, wait!
I know. I know... Drink... Good...
What's in that stuff?
The voice of Barsoom.
(SPEAKING BOTH ALIEN LANGUAGE
AND ENGLISH)
You can hear it if you choose.
Easy.
Nice monster dog.
How the hell did you...
Quit it!
Stop it!
You killed him with one blow.
I...
Wait.
I understood you.
What have you done?
Get off!
Get Off him!
How did this happen?
Who is to blame?
SOLA: Woola.
Do that again and I... (GRUNTS)
(DRUMMING RESUMES
AND STOPS AT INTERVALS)
Enough!
There is no room for another mark, Sola.
Your next offense will be your last.
You will jump, Virginia.
Now.
Jeddak! Fliers!
You are the stones, the sand!
Sir, they continue to ignore our signals.
Enough! I've been patient.
I'll not be mocked.
Let them die!
If that's how you plan to treat your future bride, it's no wonder she ran from you.
Dejah Thoris must live.
In range, sir.
MATAI: You need only cripple the ship.
A pulse to the radium drive will be sufficient.
Quick, clean, and precise.
Jeddak, shall we destroy her?
No.
We need only cripple her.
Now bring us around.
Zodanga.
- Helium.
- Helium.
Helium.
Zodanga.
They are the red flag, Helium the blue.
Zodanga's winning the war, but I say let red men kill red men until only Tharks remain.
That don't look like a fair fight.
Zodanga never fights fair.
Where is she?
My Jeddak, that's all of them.
She can't have just vanished into thin air.
- Check the dead.
- We have, sire.
Then check them again.
To the bridge, now!
(SCREAMING) Look out!
She's a human!
Sola!
Who is that?
I bet Virginia.
Beg your pardon, ma'am.
If you'll kindly just stand behind me.
This might get dangerous.
Or maybe I ought to get behind you.
You let me know when it gets dangerous.
No.
Take him alive.
What's the point of having this thing if I don't get to use it?
Leave him!
What are you?
You aren't red man nor quite white ape!
No matter.
You can still bleed like...
Tharks!
Fire!
DEJAH: I surrender.
You may take me captive.
Prepare to turn about!
Did I not tell you he could jump?
Oh, my God.
Let go! Bad dog!
You are ugly, but you are beautiful.
And you fight like a Thark.
You lost your wager. You must pay.
Jeddak of the Tharks.
I am Dejah Thoris, regent of the Royal Helium
Academy of Science.
- My research vessel...
- Your share of the spoils.
Sola! Tend to Virginia's property.
Yes, my Jeddak!
You know once Sab Than has conquered us, he will turn his weapon upon you!
I know that Zodanga has found a way to defeat you and now you seek a mighty weapon of your own.
But Virginia fights for us!
- He'll fight the Torquas in the south... the Warhoon in the north and he will be called Dotar Sojat, my right arms!
No.
I don't fight for anyone.
Virginia, reject this honor and I cannot guarantee the safety of your red girl.
I am
Dotar Sojat!
To the plunder!
War is a shameful thing.
Not when a noble cause is taken up by those who can make a difference.
You made a difference today, Virginia.
Okay.
See, my name is John Carter.
Virginia is where I'm from.
Where did you learn to jump that way?
I don't know.
How'd you learn to fly?
Your ships cannot sail on light in Virginia?
No, Professor.
See, our ships sail the seas.
Endless water everywhere.
Skeletal structure normal.
What are you doing?
Must be the density of your bones.
- Jump for me.
SOLA: - Enough!
There will be time for playfulness later.
I want no playfulness from him.
I want his help.
Explain to me how you do it.
If it's a skill, teach it to Helium.
- Name your price.
- I'm not for hire.
I've got a cave of gold of my own.
Somewhere.
Only a madman would rave about the time of oceans.
Is that your expert view?
- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.
She is a good match for you,
Dotar Sojat.
Don't call me that.
There are no seas on the planet.
You said "planet."
DEJAH: Sun, then Rasoom.
JOHN: Mercury.
Then Cosoom.
Venus.
Then Earth... us.
That is Jasoom.
You are on Barsoom, John Carter.
Mars.
I'm on Mars?
Good God.
I'm on Mars.
So, now home is Jasoom and you came on one of your sailing ships across millions of karads of empty space?
No. Not like that.
Go on, shock me.
How?
That brought me here.
Oh.
Well, that explains everything, then.
- It does?
- Yes.
You're a Thern and you simply wish to return to your rightful place.
Isn't that it?
Yes.
Then let's sort this out right now.
Come along!
SOLA: Where are you going?
DEJAH: To your temple.
No. No, you cannot enter here.
It is forbidden!
You are not Thark!
Woola, stay!
(WHISPERS) Dotar Sojat.
It is forbidden.
It is forbidden!
Well, you speak for the Goddess.
What does she say?
You called me a Thern.
Is that what she is?
No, she is Issus.
Therns are holy messengers of the Goddess.
In the time of oceans, they walked among us, guiding us.
We must not offend.
Let us go.
There's some kind of writing up there.
- Can you read it?
- It's old scripture.
There it is again.
- What's it mean?
- Don't rush me.
"Those who seek the solace of eternity"
"may journey down the river"
"through the sacred Gates of Iss"
"and find everlasting peace"
"in the bosom of Issus."
JOHN: The Gates of Iss.
What if I could take you there?
What if I didn't trust you?
Then we'd be even.
I can take you to the Gates, to the answers that you seek.
A way back to Jasoom.
- Earth.
- Earth.
It's the least I could do to repay you for getting us out of here.
Assuming that you can.
Deal.
Go on.
You shake it.
As a sign of trust.
Good enough.
Now all I need to do is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas.
Dotar Sojat?
Useless she-calot.
I told you.
It is forbidden.
What in the name of Issus is going on?
Issus has been profaned.
We found this one and the red wench plotting in the temple.
In the temple? How did they get...
Sola led them there.
Sola tried to stop us.
I meant no disrespect to your goddess, Tars.
I'm just trying to get home.
Your right arms were planning to rob you of the medallion and use it to commit greater blasphemy down the River Iss.
They must all die in the arena.
How could you do this?
I spared your life.
I made you Dotar Sojat yet her life means nothing to you.
You knew... You knew she had no room for another mark.
Now Sola will die because of you.
She's your daughter, isn't she?
Who told you that?
Call it a father's intuition.
A Thark has no parent but the horde.
But how do you know?
Her mother kept her egg and Sola's the last flicker of her ancient greatness.
You can't just stand here and let her be killed.
Argh!
My right arms offend me.
I Will cut them Off.
No.
You must hurry. I mean to release you.
I make one condition.
You take Sola with you down the River Iss.
My Jeddak.
I'd rather you died in the arms of the Goddess than as food for wild banths in the arena.
Where you go, she goes.
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?
Leave a Thark his head and one hand and he may yet conquer.
Is it done, my Jeddak?
Tars Tarkas betrays us.
JOHN: Woola!
You belong to him.
Woola would follow you anywhere on Barsoom.
DEJAH: It's three days' ride. Follow me.
JOHN: What happened to this place?
DEJAH: Zodanga happened.
Sailing on light.
Still playing the madman?
Or the liar.
DEJAH: Keep moving! We'll get there!
SAB THAN: Why pursue this wedding any longer? I've already won.
Not yet. You must aim past the horizon,
Sab Than.
To truly demoralize a nation requires a public spectacle on the grandest scale.
Staging this wedding will ensure your rule goes unchallenged.
If you insist.
If you cannot see the wisdom in that, then we will find another who can.
Dotar Sojat.
Carter!
I do not think she leads us to the Iss.
All right, then, Sola.
Just play along.
What do you think I'd do once I saw your city and not some river?
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.
They should be at our backs by now.
You lead us toward Helium!
Once we reach there, you would see for yourself the virtue of our cause.
Everyone thinks their cause is virtuous... Professor.
DEJAH: What are you doing?
No!
John Carter!
You can't!
I like this plan better.
Just wait.
She'll come around.
You mad fool!
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!
I only told you what you wanted to hear so you'd get us out!
Stop!
I can't!
I cannot marry him!
Can't marry who?
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.
Sab Than.
He offered a truce to my father in exchange for my hand.
Your father?
Tardos Mors.
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!
A princess of Mars.
How about that?
A princess who didn't want to get married, so she ran away.
No.
Is that all there is to the story?
No, I didn't run away!
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?
So marry the guy and save your people.
A life of oppression! That's not living!
If you had the means to save others, would you not take any action possible to make it so?
No good will come out of me fighting your war.
I would lay down my life for Helium.
Yes, I ran away.
I was afraid, weak.
Maybe I should have married.
But I so feared that it would somehow be the end of Barsoom.
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth, there are no Gates of Iss.
They are not real.
I'm sorry, Princess.
But this, this is real.
And so is my cave of gold.
Prudence demands you take an escort.
No.
I go alone, General.
But, Jeddak...
In one sweep, I can put an end to 1,000 years of civil war and bring Helium to its knees forever.
But my general, in his superior wisdom, objects. Is that right?
I'm starting to talk like you.
THERN 1:
Hekkador, they have reached the Iss.
It took them longer than I thought.
THERN 2: If they reach the Gates...
THERN 3:
They can breach the sanctuary.
THERN 4: Her knowledge of the Ninth Ray is already...
MATAI: As advanced as it will ever be.
Patience, brothers.
It is under my control.
I'm already there.
SOLA: The Iss.
Here, pilgrims must leave behind all they have, all they know, never to return.
May the Goddess find me worthy.
Wait!
What do you think you're doing?
It is my way, Dotar Sojat, not yours.
I must honor my Jeddak and redeem my unworthiness!
You want to honor your father?
Then stay alive and help me.
My father?
Sola...
Why would you say that?
That's what drives your compassion, the blood of your father, Tars Tarkas.
And of all the Tharks, you're the only one worthy of him.
Your duty to your father demands that you see me through.
Just help me find the Gates.
Then you can decide what honor requires.
Just to the Gates, then.
Woola, stay!
Other pilgrims.
Professor.
Impossible.
I've never seen this kind of structure before.
JOHN: I want to get a better look.
Carter, your feet.
This is not the work of gods.
These are machines.
Your medallion.
A spider.
Nine.
Nine rays.
Nine.
The Ninth Ray is real.
It can be harnessed. Do you see?
This entire structure runs on Ninth Ray isolates.
Mother Issus!
Such power.
And somehow Zodanga has it.
The Therns.
They must be real.
And you are John Carter of Earth?
Yes, ma'am.
And the ships that sail on the sea.
You've seen them.
That must be a beautiful sight.
It truly is.
It's our solar system.
- What's it say?
- I'm not sure.
What do you think it says?
It appears to be a kind of technical diagram.
Here is Barsoom. There is Jasoom.
This glyph here, it's like our symbol for a transcription, a copy, sent along these lines here, between the worlds.
Like...
A telegram.
You're saying I was telegraphed here.
I'm a copy of myself.
Possibly, making these words here the command for travel.
I don't like guessing.
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.
Right.
And where might we find those?
In the Hall of Science.
And where's that?
Helium.
Then quick, let's just head on and turn on back to Helium.
What do you take me for?
I take you for a man who's lost.
I won't be lost if you just tell me how to work this thing!
I will!
But everything I need to understand that medallion is in Helium.
I'm trying to get you back to your cave of gold.
Isn't that what you want?
Yes.
No.
I don't believe you.
We may have been born worlds apart, but I know you, John Carter.
From the moment you caught me in the sky, I knew.
I felt the heart of a man willing to lay down his life for others, a man willing to fight for a cause.
Here.
On Barsoom.
Don't you see, Carter?
I fled to find another way.
You are the other way.
SOLA: Dotar Sojat!
SOLA: Warhoon!
Dotar Sojat!
Pursue them to the Aoolian Plain.
Then overtake them and capture the red woman alive.
The one who jumps?
Let's see what he's capable of.
Sarah!
- Whoa!
- Dotar Sojat!
- What are you doing?
- Sola, get her out of here.
(SCREAMS) Carter!
I was too late once.
I won't be again.
No! No!
(SCREAMS) No!
No!
Woola, go.
Go, damn you!
Father!
Thank the Goddess!
Carter.
Oh, thank Issus.
TARDOS: Who is he?
His name's John Carter.
He saved my life.
He's from Jasoom.
Jasoom!
Zodanga's closer.
He'll have my personal physician.
He shot me out of the sky!
Daughter, listen to me! Listen.
Sab has admitted to everything.
He came to me, alone, without an escort.
I could have had him imprisoned.
I could have had him killed.
Yet, it was clear he only cared about your safety.
I feared you'd be tortured by the Tharks and condemned to die in their arena.
I could not live with that on my conscience.
I do have one, Princess.
Really?
I thought you had it removed along with...
She does not trust me, Jeddak.
And why should she?
There's never been trust between Zodanga and Helium.
Therefore, Princess,
I offer you this small but sincere token of my goodwill.
My life.
You hold the power, Princess.
The power of life over me and over all Barsoom.
With our two cities united, anything is possible.
All you have to do is marry me.
Is this Helium?
(SCOFFS) No.
Ah, Zodanga, where the men are as limited as the menu and the women are as hard as the beds.
What's your business here?
He is my business.
The Jasoomian is to be taken to more secure accommodation.
We've received no such orders!
You're receiving them now!
Straight from the laughing lips of Sab Than himself.
I hear that you are incredibly dangerous.
(LOW VOICE) Take me hostage.
- What?
- Take me hostage.
Are you all right?
No! The white imbecile has taken my sword!
Guards!
Carter! Run!
There's a crazy man running amok with a sword!
Carter, this way!
Right, your turn.
- My turn?
- Yeah.
- Who are you?
- My name is Kantos Kan.
I serve Princess Dejah.
- Dejah?
- Uh-huh.
And from what she tells me, you can get us over there.
She said I could make that?
We could always surrender.
Quickly!
Is that what you do on Jasoom?
Come on!
Hello, ladies.
You are expected to bow in my presence, Captain Carter.
Bow.
I suppose that will do.
I fetched him, as you commanded.
Thank you, Kantos.
I wish to speak to Captain Carter alone.
Keep watch outside.
Now, girls. Off you go!
You look beautiful.
It's traditional Zodangan, worn by the groom's mother, I'm told.
A little vulgar for my taste, but my opinions are about to become irrelevant.
You can't seriously be considering this.
- What other choice do I have?
- Don't marry him.
Give me a reason not to.
Will you stay and fight for Helium?
Will you stay and fight for Helium?
Dejah.
We have a saying on Barsoom.
A warrior may change his metal, but not his heart.
You were right.
I could decipher the command.
It's a set of sounds.
A simple phrase.
Repeat after me.
Ock, ohem, ocktei...
SAB THAN: Open the door!
Say it now. Ock, ohem, ocktei.
SAB THAN: - Are you all right, Dejah?
Ock, ohem, ocktei.
Wies.
- Wies.
- Jasoom.
Jasoom. Say it.
- Say it. Say it!
- Ja...
Dejah? Are you alone?
Yes.
I am alone.
Well, my Jeddak.
The moons will soon be rising.
Let us not delay the proceedings any further.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Ssh.
We'll have plenty of time to talk.
Now.
Who are you?
- American.
- Who are you, sir?
"Sir." Definitely the South.
The Carolinas? Virginia?
It's Virginia, isn't it?
- Lovely place.
- Do you know it?
Not as well as I should. But I will.
Padwar, what's the hold-up?
Sorry, sir. The streets are blocked.
It's the wedding procession.
Increased strength and agility.
Simple matter of gravitation and anatomy, one we ought to have foreseen.
We?
No apparent increase in intelligence.
Still, this Will not do at all.
We can't have Earthmen projecting themselves over here, leaping about, causing all manner of disruption.
You're a Thern.
Therns are a myth.
Padwar, we'll go on foot.
Yes, sir.
My name is Matai Shang, and I do not exist.
Indeed, I work very hard at it.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Many pardons, many pardons.
It's a shame, really.
She's a remarkable creature, and she came very close indeed.
You mean the Ninth Ray.
It's of no consequence now.
After tonight's ceremony, when the two moons meet and vows are exchanged, she and anyone else with knowledge of the Ninth Ray will be eliminated.
In effect, cutting the head off the beast.
Quick, clean and precise.
Shame there's no one to warn her.
The balance must be restored.
What gives you the right to interfere?
What do you care?
This is not your home.
You have no obligation to these people.
You don't have a dog in this fight.
Is that how you would say it in Virginia?
Man without a cause.
So what is your cause?
We have none.
We're not haunted by mortality as you are.
We are eternal.
I don't understand.
The wedding, this little stroll.
Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?
History will follow the course we have set, Earthman.
And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.
The Ninth Ray must remain in the hands of mindless brutes we can control.
And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's wedding death will seal his reign.
We've been playing this game since before the birth of this planet.
And we'll continue to do so, long after the death of yours.
We don't cause the destruction of a world, Captain Carter.
We simply manage it, feed off it, if you like.
But on every host planet, it always plays out exactly the same way.
Populations rise, societies divide, wars spread.
And all the while the neglected planet slowly fades.
Prep a two-man flier immediately for prisoner transport.
Yes, sir.
Argh!
Immortal ain't bulletproof.
I shot one of you back on Earth.
Oh, come on.
I'm trying! I'm Wing!
Guards! After him!
Ohh, Woola!
I told you Woola would follow you anywhere.
He did a lot more than just that.
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?
To save Dejah.
And I'll need an army to do it.
Get on.
No! Tharks do not fly.
Gayor.
Tars! They're going to kill
Dejah.
Issus truly rewards the just.
- I see the dead.
- Tars?
The Virginia I knew traveled the Iss.
What have they done to you?
Tal challenged.
I lost.
Virginia.
When I saw you leap into the sky,
I wished to believe it was a sign that something new can come into this world, that the greatness of our Thark race might rise again.
But it is too late.
- Tars.
- No matter.
My daughter is with her mother in Paradise.
There is comfort in that.
Tars, it's Sola.
Actually, she's here with me.
Argh!
This is how you repay your debt to me?
I need my sword.
Then it would harvest your thoughtless head from your body!
Up now! We go!
It is done.
Nonsense.
"Leave a Thark his head and one hand, and he may yet conquer."
Right?
Your spirit annoys me.
JOHN: All this your work?
Banths.
Weakness.
Sentiment.
Allowing this white worm to contaminate the horde.
These are the crimes of Tars Tarkas.
We are united because we cull our freaks.
We are strong because we despise weakness.
Let them be crushed like unhatched eggs.
JOHN: Is that a banth?
No.
It is a white ape.
- Run!
Tars! Get up! Tars!
Give me your hand!
You have four damn hands!
Give me one!
- Father!
- Father?
JOHN: Tars! Tars!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, over here, you blind monkey!
Release the other one.
(CROWD ROARS
ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Watch your father die like the whimpering calot he is!
No! Let us watch you!
Sola! Are you mad?
No. The blood of my father drives me.
Sola!
(CHANTING) Virginia! Virginia!
Virginia! Virginia!
I claim the right of challenge!
You have no right to challenge!
You are not Thark!
He is Thark!
He is Dotar Sojat!
(CHANTS) Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!
Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!
Who will pledge their metal to mine?
The Jeddak of Zodanga means to crush Helium this very night.
And if Helium falls, so does Barsoom.
We must throw off the yoke of old hatreds.
Tharks did not cause this.
But, by Issus, Tharks will end it!
We ride for Zodanga!
I know that this is not the fate you would have chosen for yourself, or for Helium, but choice is a luxury even for a Jeddak of Barsoom.
Even if, in your heart...
A heart is a luxury.
MATAI: Steady.
Remember, she is not the prize.
The prize is Barsoom.
SOLA: You!
Why is Zodanga undefended?
Where is everyone?
The army has been repositioned outside Helium.
Only a small contingent remains.
Sab and Dejah Thoris. Where are they?
They're at the wedding in Helium!
Helium?
TARS: No! I have made my decision.
It's the only way to get there in time.
Tharks do not fly.
So be it.
This is madness, Dotar Sojat. You'll die!
Then I'll see you down the River Iss.
Follow the canal!
Be careful!
The moonlight will force you to fly low!
Like our ancestors before us, we gather under the mingled light of Barsoom's first lovers,
Cluros and Thuria.
As the moons are joined in celestial union, so do we unite
Sab Than and Dejah Thoris,
Zodanga and Helium.
No! You'll raise the alarm.
It's one of ours.
In the time of oceans, the celestial lovers rose from the sea each night to consummate their love in the sky.
Drink now of this holy water and be wed.
So may it be again.
I am yours forever.
And I am yours forever.
Carter!
It's a trap! Zodanga's at your walls!
Now! Do it now!
- No!
- Helium falls!
Zodanga!
Dejah!
Argh!
If you'll just get behind me, sir.
Carter!
- It was such a nice wedding.
- Yeah, that.
Helium's fate is sealed, Earthman.
As is yours.
Thank the Goddess that's over with.
Virginia!
It is good to fly!
By Issus, they fight with us!
KANTOS: Brother!
Heliumite, huh?
You're going to tell me everything you know about the Therns.
You spare me and I'll tell you.
A fitting solution for your setback, wouldn't you say, Captain?
Dejah Thoris survives her assassins but will fail to prove her misguided theory of the Ninth Ray.
Yes.
I'll enjoy playing that out.
DEJAH: Carter!
Dejah!
I'm getting away!
Tars.
The medallion.
Give it to me, my Jeddak.
No!
I'll explain later.
TARS: You have won, my Jeddak.
All is finished.
Not quite.
A Jeddak.
I see you have changed your metal.
And my heart.
Dejah Thoris, would a princess of Mars ever consider marriage to a wayward Virginia cavalryman with nothing to offer?
Yes,
John Carter.
Yes!
TARDOS: By the ancient rite of moons and water are you bound together, husband and wife.
John?
Homesick for the Thark nursery?
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.
I had that feeling you get, suddenly, that you left a light burning or a door open.
Go back to bed.
I won't be long.
Be back in one xat,
John Carter of Earth.
Come.
John Carter of Earth.
Yup.
John Carter of Mars sounds much better.
Sire, I must express the deepest of gratitude for saving Helium.
Please. The honor is mine.
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.
Ock ohem ocktei wies Jasoom.
No, no.
No.
Powell?
No!
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.
Bars... Barsoom.
50 million miles apart and no way to bridge the gap.
No way to return my body and my soul to their true home.
Like a fool,
I had thrown away my medallion.
Then I recalled Matai Shang.
His knowledge of Earth, of my history.
It meant Therns were a presence on this world.
The cave in Arizona was proof.
There might be other such proofs, other Thern way stations
hidden all around the world.
I knew now what the cave of gold must be used for.
So for ten bitter years, I searched.
On the trail of rumor and legend
I ferreted out every possible evidence of the Therns,
but I found no medallion.
And then it came to me.
MAN: (SHOUTS AND
WHOOPS EXCITEDLY) I've got it!
I've found it!
JOHN: And once it came, there were many plans
I had to make in secret.
I could trust no one else.
I had long suspected that the Therns were following my movements.
Sir.
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.
And, Thompson...
My attorney as well.
Of course, sir.
Now you will understand the cause of my sudden death.
The reason for my bizarre funeral instructions.
Why the door can only be opened from the inside.
For if my body dies on Earth, then my copy dies on Mars.
You are the key.
This is the task I entrust to you along with all my fortune.
Protect my body.
The Therns will attempt to destroy it.
In the time it has taken you to read these pages,
they may have already done so.
I am the key. I am the key.
I, Edgar.
Ed... Ed...
E...D...
Ed!
It should work!
Dear Ned.
You sneaky devil!
You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!
Hello, Ned.
Toxin. Derived from the puffer fish.
Simulates death.
You never found the medallion.
No.
That's why I'm so grateful to you for bringing me one.
I... I was just bait?
No. You're far more than that.
I really do need a protector.
That is, if you're willing.
Goodbye, Ned.
Oh, and, Ned...
Take up a cause.
Fall in love.
Write a book.
It's time I went home.
Ock ohem ocktei wies...
Barsoom.
Get Charlie.
Dr. Holloway!
Charlie!
What?
Come quick!
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...
...years. Maybe older.
You gotta be kidding me. lt's the same configuration. l mean, it's gotta predate the others by millennia. l think they want us to come and find them.
Yeah.
What happened to that man?
He died.
Why aren't you helping them?
They don't want my help.
Their God is different than ours.
Why did he die?
Because sooner or later, everyone does.
Like Mummy?
Like Mummy.
Where do they go?
Everyone has their own word.
Heaven.
Paradise.
Whatever it's called, it's someplace beautiful.
How do you know it's beautiful?
That's what l choose to believe.
What do you believe, Ellie?
Good morning, David.
Transmitting message.
No response.
Whilst this articulation...
...is attested in the lndo-European descendants...
...as a purely paralinguistic form...
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back...
...five millennia or more.
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.
Repeat after me.
Perfect.
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes?
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.
You do that once too often. lt's only flesh and blood!
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.
And you're barmy.
- lt damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.
Well, what's the trick, then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
The trick, William Potter...
...is not minding that it hurts.
The trick, William Potter...
...is not minding that it hurts.
Attention:
Destination threshold.
Attention:

Attention: Destination threshold.
Robe.
How long?
Two years, four months, 18 days...
...36 hours, 15 minutes.
Any casualties?
Casualties, ma'am?
Has anyone died?
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.
Well, then wake them up.
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.
My name is David.
Your mind and body are in a state of shock...
...as a result of the stasis. lt's all right. Perfectly normal.
Ellie.
We're here, baby.
There, there.
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Hydration aids muscle mass.
All crew, consume shakes with high caloric content.
What the hell is that? lt's Christmas.
We need the holidays...
...to show time is still moving.
Mission briefing...
...is about to start, captain.
Might wanna make your way down.
Well, l haven't had any breakfast yet. ls this seat taken?
Hi, l'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.
Okay.
Look, no offense, but...
...l've been asleep two years. l ain't here to be your friend. l'm here to make money.
You got that?
Okay. l bet a hundred credits it's a terraforming survey.
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us. lt's a corporate run, they're not telling us shit.
Come on.
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.
You look nervous, El.
- l'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- l know you will.
Good morning.
For those of you l hired personally...
...it's nice to see you again.
For the rest of you, l am Meredith Vickers. lt's my job to make sure you do yours.
Okay, then. On with the show.
Weyland Corporation.
Building better worlds.
Hello, friends.
My name is Peter Weyland. l am your employer. l am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...
...you have reached your destination.
And l am long dead.
May l rest in peace.
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.
And he is the closest thing to a son l will ever have.
Unfortunately, he is not human.
He will never grow old...
...and he will never die.
And yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts...
...for that would require the one thing that David will never have.
A soul. l have spent my entire...
...lifetime contemplating the questions:
Where do we come from?
What is our purpose?
What happens when we die?
And l have found two people who convinced me they're on the verge of answering them.
Drs. Holloway and Shaw, if you would please stand.
As far as you're concerned, they're in charge.
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give mankind equal footing with the gods...
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.
Well, my friends, the time has finally come for his return.
Doctors, please.
The floor is yours.
Okay, wow.
All right. l never had to follow a ghost before.
Okay, let me show you why you guys...
...are here.
These are images of archeological digs from all over the Earth.
That's...
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.
That's Hawaiian there at the end, then Mesopotamian.
Now, this one here is our most recent discovery. lt's a 35,000-year-old cave painting from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.
They shared no contact with one another, and yet....
The same pictogram...
...showing men worshipping giant beings, pointing to the stars...
...was discovered at every last one of them.
And the only galactic system that matched...
...was so far from Earth that there's no way...
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations could have possibly known about it.
But itjust so happens...
...that that system...
...has a sun...
...a lot like ours.
And, based on our long-range scans, there seemed to be a planet.
Just one planet with a moon...
...capable of sustaining life.
And we arrived there this morning.
So you're saying we're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?
- No.
- Yeah.
No. Not a map, an invitation.
From who?
We call them Engineers.
Engineers?
Do you mind...
...telling us what they engineered?
They engineered us.
Bullshit.
Okay, so do you...
...have anything to back that up?
Look, if you're willing to discount...
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....
But how do you know? l don't.
But it's what l choose to believe.
Doctors.
Miss Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins.
Wow, nice place. lt's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support.
Air, food.
Anything Miss Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment.
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.
Yes. l do. l like to minimize risk.
David, why don't you make the doctors a drink? l'll take a vodka. Up.
Charlie, look. lt's a Pauling Med-Pod.
They only made a dozen of these.
Miss Shaw.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.
Please don't touch that. lt's a very expensive piece of machinery. lt does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?
There might be some confusion about our relationship.
Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission.
But l'm fairly certain your Engineers are scribblings...
...of savages living in dirty little caves.
But let's say l'm wrong, and you do find these beings down there...
...you won't engage them...
...you won't talk to them.
You will do nothing but report back to me.
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...
...you're not telling us about?
My company...
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place and bring you.
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.
But you didn't.
And that makes you an employee.
But if we can't make contact...
...why did you even bring us here?
Weyland was a superstitious man.
He wanted a true believer onboard.
Cheers.
So no response? l'm sorry, no.
Maybe they didn't understand it.
How are your lessons going, David? l spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages...
...to their roots. l'm confident...
...l can communicate with them...
...provided your thesis is correct.
"Provided it's correct." That's good.
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.
What are you smiling about?
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.
Descent trajectory mapped.
How we doing?
Great.
All right, boss.
All personnel...
...this is the captain.
Brace for entry.
Yes, captain.
That means you too, Vickers.
All systems...
...online.
What is the atmosphere?
Atmosphere is...
...71 percent nitrogen...
...21 percent oxygen...
...traces of argon gas.
Whoa, now, that's weather.
Just like home. lf you're breathing through an exhaust pipe.
CO2 is over 3 percent.
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.
Peak portside.
Whoa, 52,000! lt makes Everest look like a baby brother.
All right, take us around.
We'll use that as our point of entry.
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...
...a couple of hard spots.
Could be metal.
No radio, no heat source.
Nobody's home.
There is nothing in the desert...
...and no man needs nothing.
What was that?
Just something from a film l like.
Let's go through that gateway.
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.
Going through. Nice and slow.
Keep it steady, boys.
There.
No, what are you doing?
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?
Right there. God does not build in...
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...
...could you put us down there? l wouldn't be any good if l couldn't do that.
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.
Engage landing sequence.
Switch to manual.
- Commence landing.
- Easy.
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.
Bringing her down in five.
- Preparing RCS thrusters.
- Four.
Two. Easy does it.
Generator systems are inactive.
Temperature is at 2.724 K.
Captain, would you...
...tell the survey team to suit up...
...and meet us in the airlock.
Only six hours left of daylight.
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no. lt's Christmas, captain...
...and l want to open my presents.
You, boy.
You're coming with us. l'd be delighted.
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.
Hey, Jackson...
...what's that for?
Expedition security.
My job is to make sure everybody is nice and safe.
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.
All right, then.
Good luck with that.
David, why are you wearing a suit, man? l beg your pardon?
You don't breathe, remember?
So why wear a suit? l was designed like this...
...because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind. lf l didn't wear the suit, it would defeat the purpose.
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?
Not too close, l hope.
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.
Ramp will open in five...
...four, three, two, one.
Hey.
This is just one small step for mankind.
Seriously?
You ready to do this? l know you are.
Hey, Fifield. l want a spectrograph on this. l want to know if it's natural or if somebody put it there. l can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what l can...
...tell you is, it's hollow.
Prometheus, are you seeing this?
Affirmative.
We see it.
Okay, ready?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- After you.
- After you.
Okay.
Careful.
Prometheus, we're going in.
Copy that.
What's back here?
Some kind of a corridor?
Mr. Fifield, let's get a grid of the structure. l want the whole interior. lf there's anything in here worth looking at...
...these pups'll find them.
"Pups"?
Yeah, pups. My pups.
Prometheus, we are now mapping.
Copy that.
Well, l'll be damned.
Fifield, you got a read?
Yeah.
Pups are saying this way.
Look at this.
Oh, Charlie.
Jesus.
The sunlight is heating the water.
Check out the humidity.
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.
Outside...
...it's completely toxic, and in here...
...there's nothing. lt's breathable.
What are you doing?
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.
There's something generating an atmosphere.
David?
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...
...actually.
They were terraforming.
Please don't do-- l'm not wearing this thing anymore.
Wish me luck, baby.
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.
You crazy bastard.
Connect our suit cameras...
...if you want to continue watching this freak show. We are taking our helmets off.
Copy that. Switching feeds.
Well, come on. Pay up.
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?
Something is manufacturing breathable air down there. That, mate...
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here. lf you said a dead old man wanted to talk to Martians, l'd pay.
Come on, a hundred credits.
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that? lt's minus 12 in here.
So why is this water not frozen?
Maybe it ain't water.
Maybe it's Martian piss.
That's your scientific theory? ls it? Mr. Biology?
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.
Some kind of sediment, perhaps. lmpressive.
What was that?
David?
David?
What is that?
David?
Ellie!
What was that? l'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?
Keep up!
Come on!
Where did he go?
Wait, wait, wait.
There it is. There it is. There it is.
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.
What do you mean "them"? lt is them, Ellie. lt looks like a door...
...and he's been decapitated by it.
Son of a bitch.
They were right.
What did you want them to be? Wrong?
David...
...please tell me you can read that.
Perhaps.
No, l'm out of here.
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?
What?
Look, l'm just a geologist. l like rocks. l love rocks!
Now it's clear you two don't give a shit about rocks.
But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead...
...bodies.
As l don't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic...
...dead body arena...
...l want to go back to the ship, if you don't mind.
Anyone wanna...
...join me, hey? You staying?
No, ship's good.
Yeah. Ship very good.
Congratulations on meeting your maker.
Thank you.
Pull yourself...
...together, man.
And l thought you were the crazy one.
Do you have the carbon reader?
Thank you.
How long's it been dead?
Two thousand years...
...give or take.
What are you doing, David? l'm attempting to open the door.
Wait. We don't know what's on the other side.
Oops. Sorry.
Look, Ford. lt's the head.
An amazing state of preservation.
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.
Remarkably human.
Beautiful painting. lt's a mural.
Stop.
Stop. Don't touch it.
Sorry.
Please, don't touch anything.
Sweating.
Organic.
Oh, no.
Charlie, the murals are changing. l think we've affected the atmosphere in the room.
Charlie, do you copy?
Oh, the head!
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!
- Boss.
- What you got?
We got an incoming storm front.
Silica...
...and lots of static. This is not good. l see it.
Ground crew...
...this is Janek. l need you to hustle back right now.
Ground crew, do you copy me? l got 200-kilometer...
...winds of airborne silica...
...and enough static to fry your suit.
Copy that, sir.
We need more time. l'll be closing the outer...
...doors in 15 minutes. l sincerely hope you can make it.
Charlie! David!
We must leave now.
This is just another tomb.
David!
- On three.
- Two, three, up.
Let's go!
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.
David, we are leaving!
Come on!
Damn it, they've already taken off.
Come on, let's go.
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.
All right, come on. Let's go.
Go faster!
Charlie! The head!
Ellie, no!
What are you doing?
Hatch closure...
- ...in five seconds.
- Shit.
Damn it, hold on!
Goddamn it.
Door closing.
Ellie, don't move!
Charlie!
Grab my hand!
No!
No, Ellie!
Ellie!
Got it.
So, what was that, Ellie?
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...
...almost killing yourself!
Are you all right?
Yes.
Thank you, David.
My pleasure.
Doctors, it's real good to have...
...you back, but where's Millburn and Fifield?
Aren't they back yet?
- Get them up for me.
- All right.
We've been here before, Fifield. l don't know. lt all looks the same to me.
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.
Between the static electricity and the wind speed...
...well, there ain't no safe way to come get you.
What?
The temperature is dropping rapidly, so get your helmets on and stay warm...
...until the storm passes.
Captain...
...can you get a message to the scientist and his zealot girlfriend?
You got a pen nearby?
No. No, l think we got it.
Tell them l said... themselves.
Copy?
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...
...and we'll come get you in the morning.
Well, which way now?
All right.
Well, which way, huh?
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.
David.
So are they all dead?
What? Who?
Your Engineers.
Are they all dead or aren't they? l don't know.
We just got here.
Scan.
Do you care if they're dead?
Weyland cared.
Dr. Shaw.
Have a look at this.
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No. l think it's a helmet.
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...
...be able to prize this open. lt's too heavy for us. David?
Careful.
Like so.
What is that on its head? lt looks like new cells.
- ln a state of....
- Change.
Yes.
Changing into what?
Can you run a stem line into the locus coeruleus? l think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it's still alive.
- Thirty amps.
- Okay.
No more.
Let me make an incision.
Okay.
Go up, 40.
Okay, 40 up.
Did you see that?
- Yes.
- Yep. See?
Go up another 10.
Okay, up 10.
Maybe it's a little...
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.
Okay, l'm trying. l'm trying, it's not going down.
Full down. Ford...
...stop it.
Oh, God.
David, contain it! Now!
Contain it? Turn it off!
Oh, God. The smell!
Oh, God, look at that.
Look at that. lt's getting worse.
Mortal, after all.
Ford, take a sample.
Let's have a look.
No, sir, l will take care of it.
Yes, sir, understood. l'm sorry.
Fortunately, slightly premature.
Of course, sir.
Miss Vickers.
What did he say, David? l don't think he'd want me to tell you.
What did he say? l'm sorry...
...that's confidential.
So help me God...
...l will find the cord that makes you run and l will cut it.
What did he say?
He said:
"Try harder."
Cup of tea, ma'am?
Genetic view.
Okay.
Let's have a look at its DNA. lsolate the strand.
Okay.
Compare it to the gene sample?
Yeah.
Overlay.
Processing.
Processing.
DNA match.
Oh, my God. lt's us. lt's everything.
What killed them?
Big things...
...have small beginnings.
Am l interrupting? l thought you might be running low.
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but l'm afraid...
...it would be wasted on me.
Right, l almost forgot you're not a real boy. l'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone.
You think we wasted our time coming here, don't you?
Your question depends on me understanding what you hoped to achieve by coming here.
What we hoped to achieve was to meet our makers.
To get answers.
Why they even...
...made us in the first place.
Why do you think your people made me?
Because we could.
Can you imagine how disappointing it would be...
...to hear the same thing from your creator? l guess it's...
...good you can't be disappointed.
Yes. lt's wonderful...
...actually.
May l ask you something?
Please do.
How far would you go...
...to get what you came all this way for?
Your answers.
What are you willing to do?
Anything and everything.
That's worth drinking to, l'd imagine.
Here's mud in your eye, pal.
Good health. lt's those things.
Are they real?
Of course they're real.
Jesus Christ. l mean....
Look at the pile.
Look how high up they are. lt looks like...
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?
Man, this thing is opened up from the inside.
Almost like it exploded.
Looks like a scene out some sort of holocaust painting, you know?
Well....
So, whatever killed them is long gone, right?
Millburn, Fifield.
This is Prometheus.
What is your position?
Prometheus, this is Millburn.
We are at 7-4-0...
...1-4-7-7. Why?
Just got a ping about one click west of you.
What do you mean "a ping"?
Well, whatever...
...that probe is picking up...
...it's not dead. lt's reading a life form.
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"? ls it--? ls it moving?
No, l don't think so.
Captain, you're...
...obviously not seeing...
...what we're seeing here.
If you were, you wouldn't be talking about a ping. l know, boys.
Your signal has been coming in sporadically since the storm hit.
That's no good to us down here! ls it--? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.
Must be a glitch.
What do you mean, "a glitch"?
All right, boys.
Sleep tight.
Try not to bugger each other.
Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.
Now, he said--
- He said one click west, yeah?
- Yeah.
Now, we....
We don't want to check that out, do we?
Shit, no.
Where are we gonna go?
East.
Yeah, east.
A fucking glitch, man.
"Pings, glitch, life form." What the fuck?
Based on the behavior of the subject in these holographic recordings...
...we're attempting to identify what caused the head...
...to combust. l can't help but wonder...
...was there an outbreak here?
You rang...
- ...ma'am?
- l have something important...
...to tell you. What is that?
This is...
...a rose that l had frozen with the champagne. l was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for.
We did find what we came for.
They were here. This is--
The most significant discovery in the history...
...of mankind. Oh, l know. lt's incredible, it really is.
But l wanted to talk to them. l mean, don't you want to know why they came?
Why they abandoned us? l just want answers, baby.
We were right, Charlie. l have proof.
Look.
Their genetic material predates ours.
We come from them.
- You're kidding me.
- No.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. l guess you can take your father's cross off now.
Why would l want to do that?
Because they made us.
And who made them?
Well, exactly. We'll never know.
But here's what we do know:
That there is nothing special about the creation of life.
Right? Anybody can do it.
All you need is a dash of DNA and half a brain, right? l can't. l can't create life.
What does that say about me?
Ellie, that's not-- l didn't mean-- l wasn't talking about--
Children?
Us.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Elizabeth Shaw...
...you are the most special person l have ever met in my life...
...and l love you.
Hey.
How much longer will this take? l don't know. l'm just a captain.
That thing sounds like a dying cat, by the way. l'll have you know that this thing...
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.
Am l supposed to know who that is?
You know...
...if you wanna get laid...
...you really don't have to pretend...
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.
You could just say,
"Hey, l'm trying to get laid." l could. l could say that, right?
But it wouldn't make sense...
...why l would fly myself half a billion miles from every man on Earth...
...if l wanted to get laid, would it?
Hey, Vickers.
Hey, Vickers. l was wondering....
Are you a robot?
My room.
Ten minutes.
Well, if you can't be with the one you love
Love the one
You're with
Love the one you're with
Millburn.
What's all this black stuff?
Gazpacho. ls that tobacco? ls that tobacco...
...in your respirator?
Yeah, sure.
Tobacco.
On behalf of scientists everywhere, l am ashamed to count you amongst us...
...Fifield. Really.
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?
You see this thing?
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?
Something they worshiped? What?
- lt kind of looks like--
- What's that?
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God. Okay.
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.
This is okay, l can handle this.
Hey, baby.
Hey.
Come in, Prometheus.
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.
And it's beautiful.
Okay!
Prometheus...
...we have two.
Look at you. Look at you, baby.
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?
You need to stay calm because she is beautiful.
What makes you think that's female?
She's a lady. Look!
Hey.
She's mesmerized.
Come here. Come here. lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.
Hey, baby.
You're strong!
You should...
...help me now.
Get it off.
Cut it here, man! l ain't touching that!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- lt's getting tighter.
- l ain't touching it!
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!
God, you're making it worse! lt's tightening! lt's tight-- lt's breaking my arm!
Shit!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
Shit!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! lt's in my suit.
Jesus Christ.
Shaw, you up?
Yeah, what's up?
The storm passed, but l can't reach Millburn...
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down, see if l can rustle them up.
Okay.
Any idea where they are?
Last time they radioed in was where you found your head.
Okay, we're coming.
All right.
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.
All right, boss.
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.
- lt's gotta be in the hardware.
- What glitch, captain?
One of them probes picked up a life form.
Pops up every hour...
...for a couple of seconds and then it's gone. l can find the probe and fix it.
Knock yourself out.
Be careful, doctors.
Fifield!
Millburn?
All right, come on down.
David, are you alone?
Yes, Miss Vickers.
Uplink your feed to my room.
Copy.
You son of a bitch.
You cut me off.
What is this?
- Charlie?
- l just tripped.
Oh, my God, you're sick! l'm okay, baby. Come on.
Fifield?
Millburn?
Hey, Chance. l wouldn't touch...
...that if l were you.
Dr. Shaw?
Yeah?
Do we have any idea what is...
...oozing out of these vases?
No. They weren't like this last time we were here.
Captain?
What?
Who is it? Which one?
- Who is it?
- lt's Millburn.
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.
Ellie, honey.
Charlie, what's wrong? l need you to look at me, okay?
You know infections...
...so, what do you see?
This is not good, baby.
You look at me, you tell me what you see.
Oh, my God.
Ford, get over here. lt's okay. Janek?
- What?
- We have to go now!
What do you see?
Honey, what do you see?
Holloway's sick. He's not good. l see movement...
...in his esophagus.
- Come on, baby.
- No. l'm okay.
Janek!
Come over and help me!
- l'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?
- l'm okay.
- Let's go!
Help me with him. l got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Prometheus...
...come in.
- Watch your head.
- Okay. l'm okay.
- Holloway.
- Get him up.
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in. ls anyone there?
This is Vickers. l need a medical team standing by the airlock.
Full quarantine fail-safe.
Holloway's sick.
Sick with what?
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.
- lt's not safe down here.
- Charlie? l'm suiting up.
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Move!
- What was that back there?
- Let's go, people!
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!
Ellie!
He don't look too good.
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off. l don't know.
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.
Aye, captain.
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.
Come on!
Please!
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?
Vickers, that is an order!
Get that goddamn door open!
- Look at me. lt's too late, l'm sick.
- No, it's not.
Come on!
Ford, help me!
Airlock crew, if you can hear me, it's Janek.
Open that back door right now!
Hold that door!
Prometheus...
...do you copy?
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!
Open it.
What the hell is this?
He's not coming onboard.
Vickers, this is a sick man. l see that. That's why...
...he's not coming on!
Charlie!
Chance, get over here!
Please!
We can still help him!
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship! l won't leave him!
Then stay!
Wait! We could...
...put him on the Med-Pod!
Please don't do this. lt's okay, Ellie.
Vickers!
What are you doing? l love you, baby.
- l love you.
- No. l'm telling you, stay back!
Do it.
Stay back!
No! No, Charlie!
- Do it.
- No!
No!
No!
No!
Charlie!
No!
My deepest condolences. l'm going to have to take this. lt may be contaminated. lf there's a contagion, we were all exposed.
You need-- We need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.
Yes, of course.
Yes? l understand how...
...inappropriate this is...
...given the circumstances.
But as you ordered quarantine fail-safes...
...it's my responsibility to ask.
Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently?
Since you and he were...
...so close...
...l want to be...
...as thorough as poss--
My, my.
You're pregnant.
What?
From the look of it, three months so.
No, that's impossible. l can't be pregnant.
Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway?
Yes...
...but 10 hours ago.
There's no bloody way l'm three months pregnant.
Well, doctor...
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus. l want to see it.
Don't think that's a good idea.
David, l want to see it.
Now, doctor.... l want to see it. l want it out of me.
We don't have the personnel...
...to perform a procedure like that.
- Our best option--
- l want it out.
Put you back into...
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.
Please, get it out of me.
Get it out of me!
Please. lt must be very painful.
Here, let me give you something.
That's it. There, there.
Someone will be along shortly...
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck. lt must feel like your God abandoned you.
What?
To lose...
...Dr. Holloway after your father died under such similar circumstances.
What was it that killed him?
Ebola?
How do you--? How do you know that? l watched your dreams.
Dr. Shaw?
We're here to put you...
...in an anti-contamination suit, take you back to Cryo Deck...
...go to beddy-byes.
Dr. Shaw?
She's doped. Prepare her.
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury. l need a Caesarean.
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...
...patients and does not offer...
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...
...elsewhere.
Surgery.
Abdominal.
Penetrating...
...injuries.
Foreign body. lnitiate.
Surgical procedure to begin.
Running diagnostics.
Oh, come on.
Get it out! Come on!
Please!
Oh, God!
- Come on!
- lnitiating anesthetics.
Please!
Commence surgical procedure.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Come on!
Bridge...
...to hangar. This is the captain.
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what l see?
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.
What? Where?
According to what l'm looking at, it's outside...
...the goddamn ship.
Barnes, open the door!
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.
Fifield?
Wait a second.
Hey, Wallace.
Take a look at this.
Fifield?
What the hell is going on down there? l'm coming down there.
Chance, you're suiting up.
- Come on.
- Don't let it on the ship!
Take him out!
Got him!
Do it!
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.
Come on!
Get in the rover!
We gotta get out of here!
Go!
What is that?
You've been asleep.
You were on the ship all this time. Why?
Well, l.... l have a few days of life left in me. l didn't wanna waste them...
...until you could deliver what you promised.
To meet my maker.
There we are, sir.
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.
One of them is still alive.
We're on our way to see him now.
What?
Turn me around.
You convinced me that...
...if these things made us...
...then surely they could save us.
My stick, please.
Well, save me, anyway.
Save you from what?
Death, of course.
Stand me up. l'm all right. l'm all right.
Yes, sir.
But you don't understand.
You don't know.
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...
...what we thought they were. l was wrong.
We were so wrong.
Charlie....
Dr. Holloway's dead.
We must leave!
And what would Charlie do...
...now that we're so close...
...to answering the most meaningful questions...
...ever asked by mankind?
How can you leave without...
...knowing what they are?
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?
Okay. Okay.
Come in.
Where the hell are you going, doc?
You know what this place is?
Those Engineers? This ain't their home. lt's an installation.
Maybe even military.
They put it out here because they're not stupid enough...
...to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep.
That's what all that shit is in those vases.
They made it here. lt got out, it turned on them. The end. lt's time for us to go home.
One of them is still alive.
Don't you want to know what they have to say? l don't care.
Right.
All you do is fly the ship.
That's right.
But you must care about something, captain. lf you didn't, why are you here?
How about this?
No matter what happens down there...
...l can't bring none of that shit back home with us.
Can't let it happen. l'll do whatever l have to...
...to see that it doesn't.
Make sure you do, captain.
So you came after all. l thought you wanted me to.
After all your attempts to stop me from coming here...
...l'm surprised to see you. lt's all right. Leave us.
Yes, sir. lf you're...
...going down there, you will die.
Very negative way of looking at things.
That's exactly why you should have stayed at home.
Did you really think l was gonna sit in a boardroom for years...
...arguing over who was in charge...
...while you go look for some miracle on some...
...godforsaken rock in the middle of space?
A king has...
...his reign, and then he dies. lt's inevitable.
That...
...is the natural order of things.
Anything else?
No...
...Father.
That's it. l didn't think you had it in you.
Sorry.
Poor choice of words.
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.
What happens when Weyland is not...
...around to program you? l suppose l'll be free.
You want that?
"Want"?
Not a concept l'm familiar with.
That being said...
...doesn't everyone want their parents dead? l didn't.
Dr. Shaw.
So pleased you could join us.
You can take your helmet off if you like, sir.
What?
The air is perfectly breathable.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air. lt's not.
How do you know that?
Smells fine to me.
- Shall we?
- Please.
The bridge is just up ahead.
What is this? lt's a cargo hold.
Janek? Are you seeing this?
How many is there, Shaw?
Thousands.
What the hell?
Ravel, give me those schematics.
Putting it on the table now.
Strip away the dome. lsolate that area, bring it up.
Bringing it up, captain.
Enlarge that.
Rotate it.
That is a ship.
Jesus Christ. lt's a goddamn ship.
A superior species, no doubt.
Their hypersleep chambers...
...will impress, l trust.
So they...
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- l've managed to work out the broad strokes. lt's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving...
...before things went to pot.
Leaving to go where?
Earth.
Why?
Sometimes to create...
...one must first destroy.
Where is he, David?
This way, sir.
Are you sure he's alive?
Absolutely.
And you can speak to him? l believe l can. l'm all right, l'm all right.
Speak to him, David.
Tell him we came, just like he asked.
Ask where they're from.
What are you doing?
Ask him what's in his cargo. lt killed his people.
Shaw, enough.
- David.
- You made it here...
...and it was meant for us. Why?
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up. l need to know why!
What did we do wrong? Why do you...
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...
...mouth again, shoot her.
David, continue. Tell him why l came.
No!
Ford! Move!
There's nothing. l know.
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.
Time to go home.
Mr. Chance, take us home.
Oh, no!
Hey, cap.
What the hell was that?
Prometheus!
Come in!
Shaw, is that you?
Copy.
Janek...
...listen to me.
This ship is taking off!
- What?
- What is she talking about?
You can't let it leave!
You have to stop it!
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.
Janek, if you don't stop it...
...there won't be any home to go back to. lt's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
- l know.
Let's go. l know that.
But you must do it.
Captain, let's go!
Janek, please believe me! Please! l told you to get this ship going.
Mr. Ravel.
Warm up the ion propulsion.
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.
Burning ion in the atmosphere--
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?
This is my ship. l'm telling you...
...to take us home!
Vickers, l'll eject your module onto...
...that surface. Two years of life.
You want it, or you want to stay with me?
You got 40 seconds to get...
...to the escape pod.
You're crazy.
Gentlemen...
...l can handle this myself.
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.
All due respect, captain.
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna need all the help you can get.
Well, if you can't be with the one you love lf you think this means the bet's off...
...you're wrong.
Why don't you pay me on the other side?
All right, get us as close as we can.
Only got one shot at this.
Lifeboats away!
Twenty seconds...
...to evacuate.
- Countdown initiated.
- lon propulsion...
...is online.
Ten.
Nine.
Come on!
Eight.
- Three.
- Let's do this.
Two. lmpact imminent.
Hands off!
Oh, God.
No. No.
No! No! No!
Oh, God.
Warning: You have two minutes of oxygen remaining.
Warning: You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining.
Airlock sealed.
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.
Elizabeth, are you there?
This is David.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, l'm here.
You need to get out immediately.
He's coming for you.
Who's coming?
Airlock breach.
Die! l'm so sorry.
Oh, God. l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Charlie, l can't do it. l can't do it anymore.
Elizabeth.
Are you there?
Dr. Shaw...
...can you hear me?
Yes.
Yes, l can hear you. l was afraid you were dead.
You have no idea what afraid is. l know we've had our differences...
...but, please...
...l need to ask you for your help.
Why the hell would l help you?
Because, without me, you'll never leave this place.
Neither one of us is leaving this place. lt's not the only ship.
There are many others. l can operate them.
Dr. Shaw?
Dr. Shaw!
Over here.
Where is my cross?
The pouch in my utility belt.
Even after all this...
...you still believe, don't you?
You said you could understand their navigation...
...use their maps.
Yes, of course.
Once we get to one of their other ships...
...finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward. l don't want to go back to where we came from. l want to go where they came from.
Do you think you can do that, David?
Yes. l believe l can.
May l ask what you hope to achieve by going there?
They created us.
Then they tried to kill us.
They changed their minds. l deserve to know why.
The answer is irrelevant.
Does it matter why they changed their minds?
Yes.
Yes, it does. l don't understand.
Well...
...l guess that's because l'm a human being...
...and you're a robot. l'm sorry. lt's quite all right.
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.
The ship and her...
...entire crew are gone.
If you're receiving this transmission...
...make no attempt to come to its point of origin.
There is only death here now, and l'm leaving it behind. lt is New Year's Day...
...the year of our Lord, 2094.
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.
And l am still searching.
Earth, before the war.
New York, before I was born.
A place I've only seen pictures of.
I know you...
But we've never met.
I'm with you...
But I don't know your name.
I know I'm dreaming. But it feels like more than that.
It feels like a memory.
How can that be?
March 14th, 2077.
Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.
And I'm still haunted by these dreams.
Victoria and I were assigned together.
In two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll I join the others.
But the questions I ask, she doesn't.
The things I wonder about, she won't.
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.
Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.
Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.
Tsunamis wiped out what remained.
Then came the invasion.
We did what we had to do.
We used the nukes.
We won the war, but lost the planet.
Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.
What remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.
We built the Tet, our mission control.
A temporary space station before the migration to Titan,
Saturn's largest moon.
Everyone's there now.
Well, almost everyone.
Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.
We protect the hydro rigs,
which convert Earth's sea water
into fusion energy for the new colony.
The survival of humanity depends on it.
Thank you for the coffee.
Remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation.
They attack our drones at night,
and try to kill me during the day.
There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.
Mission says we have done well.
That we are an effective team.
Vika's my communications officer.
She keeps an eye on me.
I handle drone maintenance.
The drones watch everything.
Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.
I can't shake the feeling that Earth,
in spite of all that's happened...
Earth is still my home.
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Morning, Bob.
Tower, comm check.
Drone Maintenance Technician
49, hydro rig support.
All Bubbleship systems are green.
I'm good to go.
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.
Always am.
No, you're not.
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.
All right, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.
I got 'em. Hydro rigs are sucking seawater.
You got 'em, Bob?
Drone 185 looks good.
Jack, we've got two drones down.
Shit.
Stand by,
Mission coming online.
And we have Tet contact.
Morning, boss.
Tower 49, this is Mission Control.
How y'all doing this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.
I have two...
You have two drones offline.
Perimeter's compromised.
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.
Linking to beacon now.
You'll go there first.
Got it. On my way.
Mission, Tech-49 is en route to Grid 37 now.
Can you plug that hole with Drone 109?
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.
Jack better find those drones and get 'em flying.
Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.
Copy that.
Tower, didn't he fix 166 recently?
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.
And, if we had the parts that we've been asking for, we wouldn't be running a skeleton crew down here.
Understood.
We're doing the best we can.
Are you an effective team?
We are an effective team.
Your directive today is to rehabilitate 166
and find 172.
Get 'em flying by sundown,
and I'll buy you two a round of drinks when you get up to the Tet.
You had better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now, we're keeping track.
Okay.
Come on, Bob. Work with me, here, buddy.
Tech-49?
Tech-49?
Jack?
Copy, Tower.
What happened?
I lost you for a second.
Really?
Coming up on location.
There it is.
I've got multiple scav kills.
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.
Got any movement?
No sign of scavenger activity.
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.
Copy that.
I'm coming in hot.
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.
I always do.
You know,
I read about this game.
It was played right here.
The last Super Bowl.
Please don't tell me it was a classic.
A classic game.
Down by four.
The ball
was on the 50-yard line.
Seconds left on the clock.
The ball is snapped, and the QB fumbles.
Disaster.
Looks like the game is over.
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.
You don't have the necessary tools down there.
And a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.
But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.
Hold on, what did you just do?
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.
A Hail Mary.
Eighty-thousand people on their feet, watching this ball sail through the air.
Downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.
He just leaps out of the pack.
Touchdown!
Contact! West contact!
Jack?
It's okay, Vika.
It's just a dog.
Hey.
Now, go on. You gotta get out of here.
Go on, get!
Get out of here! Go!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
You're welcome.
166 is back online.
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.
These scavs are getting bolder.
Well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.
Once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.
This is bullshit.
We won the war.
Now we have to leave.
Two more weeks, Jack.
Then we'll be on our way to Titan.
Yep.
That drone is out there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
Without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.
So we go to our ground game.
Tower, I've located 172 down a sinkhole.
No visual, but I can hear it.
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.
How's it look?
It's good, it's good. There's no sign of scav activity on top.
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.
After that, you're on your own.
Mission, this is Tower 49.
Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.
I've got a visual on Drone 172.
Jack?
What the hell?
Shit.
Ha!
Jack!
Tech-49,
Jack Harper.
Jack Harper, Tech-49!
Hey!
Oh, no.
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!
"How can a man die better Than facing fearful odds"
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"
Jack?
Yep, I'll be right there.
How does 109 look?
Can it fly?
Barely.
And without armor, she's a sitting duck.
Well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.
Okay.
Again.
What, Jack Harper?
Where did you get this?
It was growing in...
Come on, Jack, you know the regulations.
I know you think I'm a stickler but you have no idea what kind of toxins could be in something like that.
It's a flower, Vika.
Yeah, that's not the point.
It's that we are so close to the end, and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.
Okay.
Every day, you have to go down there and see what was lost.
But we've done our job, Jack.
It's time to go.
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.
The scavs.
They were trying to catch me.
Well, they can't have you.
Come on.
You should come with me sometime, before we leave.
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.
I'll show you something.
Hey, hey!
Oh, my God.
It was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.
It's offline permanently.
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.
I need to know exactly what happened.
Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells
and got it into the suction.
Tower, hold.
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?
Yes.
It's gotta be scav.
It's not one of ours.
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.
On my way.
Tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.
Can you confirm?
Negative, Mission, that number is 10.
Drone 172 was lost last night.
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.
I've run the numbers.
We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.
Copy.
Our job is to run those rigs. Your directive is to protect them.
We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?
Copy.
Are you and Jack an effective team?
Damn right we are.
Jack?
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?
Jack?
Yeah, I got it.
They have some kind of a repeater.
The scavs are using the building as an antenna.
Can you decrypt?
It's a set of coordinates.
Grid 17.
It's a goddamn homing beacon.
Grid 17.
What the hell is out there?
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.
What is going on?
Why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?
I'm shutting it down.
Tech-49, check your course. You're headed right for the border.
That radiation will cook you from the inside before you know it.
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.
I'm gonna do a perimeter check before I head home.
I may go off-comm.
Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.
Do you copy?
Jack, do you copy?
That's right, Bob.
You know where we're going.
Are you gonna miss me?
I'm gonna miss this place.
It would have been great.
It would have been great.
Vika? Vika, did you get that?
Jack, where have you been?
An object came down in 17.
That's the beacon coordinates.
Exactly.
I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.
Jack, Mission's almost offline.
I'm en route now.
Mission, we have an unidentified object impact in 17.
It came down at coordinates sent by a scav beacon.
My tech's en route now.
Tower, we're going offline soon,
but drones are already mobile and executing.
Have your tech stand down.
Copy.
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.
That's a negative, Tower.
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.
I want to know this site is secure.
Sally, my tech's concerned about the security of the site.
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.
Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?
Copy, Command, I'm...
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.
I'm on site.
Jack.
I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.
Vika, I think it's one of ours.
This thing is ancient.
It looks...
...pre-war.
The scavs brought this thing down, Jack.
There's no sign of scavs.
Technician, this is your Control.
I'm ordering you to pull out and return to the tower immediately.
Touching down.
They're human.
Tower, we have got survivors.
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.
They are human.
Stand down!
Vika, the drones are firing on survivors.
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.
Stand down!
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Back off, you son of a bitch!
Back off!
Open the door.
Vika!
Get the med kit.
Get the med kit!
This has to be reported.
Be sure and report that the drones killed the crew from one of our own ships.
See what Command makes of that.
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.
Jack.
Here.
You're still dehydrated.
Where are we?
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.
What's your name?
I'm Julia.
Julia...
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you, but you were in a crash.
Your ship came down.
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.
But none of your crew survived.
What do you mean?
You're the only one that made it.
I'm sorry.
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.
Some disorientation is normal.
How long?
Sixty years.
At least.
I have to get back to our ship.
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.
Vika...
Don't touch me.
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon from the surface.
Do you know anything about that?
What was your mission?
It's classified.
Well, we have no record of an Odyssey...
I can't tell you anything until I get the flight recorder from my ship.
Julia, a lot has changed in 60 years.
While you were in delta sleep,
Earth was attacked.
Call them scavs.
They destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.
Then they invaded.
We won the war, but Earth was ruined.
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.
Or on the space station, getting ready to go.
We're here for security and drone maintenance.
We're the mop-up crew.
You've lost people.
Everything.
If you want to be alone, we understand.
The drones killed her entire crew.
If I hadn't gotten there...
I want her gone first thing.
Vika...
Do you have any memories before the mission?
Before the security wipe?
Our job is not to remember.
Remember?
Do you remember her?
Jack...
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.
We don't know who she is.
Or what she is.
Let's just get through the night.
Okay?
You fly that thing?
Yes.
What happens now?
The Tet will be online soon.
Victoria will report your rescue.
They'll send someone down for you.
From the Tet?
Yes.
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.
The scavs, they move at night.
They could be all over it by now.
I need to know what happened.
You need to know what happened.
Please.
Jack?
Jack, what are you doing?
Vika, she's a flight officer.
She wants to see her ship and secure the flight recorder.
Now, you would want the same thing.
Jack, I...
I can't protect you.
No, I understand.
This one's on me.
I couldn't save them.
Jack. Jack!
Jack, can you hear me?
All right, it's time to go.
Jack.
I found it.
Jack!
Tower 49, how are y'all this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise.
Sally...
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol and went off-comm near the canyons in 17.
Now,
I know we're low on drones, but, um, requesting one to sweep the area.
Just a quick scout.
Copy 49, tasking 185 to Grid 22.
"And how can a man die better Than facing fearful odds"
"For the ashes of his fathers"
"And the temples of his Gods"
I've been watching you, Jack.
You're curious.
What are you looking for in those books?
Do they bring back old memories?
You won't get anything from me.
My memory has been wiped to protect...
...the security of the mission. Yes.
You can't have your precious memory falling into the wrong hands, now, can you?
Tell me.
Have you ever met a scav up close?
Of course not.
You just repair drones.
"Don't go into the radiation zone."
"Don't ask too many questions."
Not part of the job description.
Lights.
We're not alien, Jack.
We're human.
Of course, for us, being human is a problem.
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.
Vocal scrambling.
Can you hear me, Jack?
Keeps your drones confused.
Well, most of the time.
The drones are programmed...
To kill humans, Jack.
You saw what they did to those sleep pods.
You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting that woman.
Why did you do that?
Anyone would have.
"Anyone."
Interesting.
We're wasting our time.
The drone will track him here.
That's Sergeant Sykes.
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.
I hope you prove him wrong.
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail somewhere near the west canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
Stand by.
DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.
Vika, are you okay?
Everything good between you two?
Of course.
You're still an effective team?
We're great.
Never better.
We were running a ground game, and losing.
So, we decided,
"What the hell?"
"We've got to throw the long ball."
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.
Why?
The Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.
Very hard to come by.
Did you like the show last night?
That was just one fuel cell.
Imagine what 10 of them will do, with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.
We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.
But it knows you, Jack.
We need you to program the drone.
Have it carry our nuke up to the Tet.
End this war.
There are people up there.
Sergeant.
Program the drone to return to the Tet.
It needs to go right to the center.
Screw you.
We haven't got time for this.
Hey. Hey!
No.
Let's go!
Get him up.
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower, we're seeing the same thing.
Permission to task two additional drones?
If one drone is here, more will come.
And they won't stop until they find me.
They'll turn this place to dust.
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.
It's your only chance.
I've been to your
"radiation zones."
If you're looking for the truth, that's where you'll find it.
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.
What makes you think he's different?
She does.
Mission, I've found my tech over in 37.
You can call off the search.
Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.
Tasking the other drones back to rig support.
Where are we going now?
Who are you?
What aren't you telling me?
Jack, I...
What were you doing on the Odyssey?
What was your mission?
It was a research flight to Titan. My first.
That's what it was supposed to be.
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners picked up an alien object.
We were reassigned to investigate.
They put us all in delta.
They must have woken you and Victoria first.
What?
That object was the Tet, Jack.
The Tet was our mission.
That's impossible.
That's impossible!
Who are you?
I'm your wife.
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.
Jack, we were here.
You asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.
I could tell you were nervous that day.
It was right here, Jack.
You said,
"Look through here, and I'll show you the future."
And I held up a ring.
And you said...
"Yes."
There you are.
There you are.
Hi.
Hello.
Come on.
Vika, I'm coming in.
Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?
Do you copy?
Vika, open the door.
Stay away from me.
I don't want to hear it.
It's not safe here, and we need to leave, now.
It was always her.
Wasn't it?
Vika...
She's my wife.
Mission, this is Tower 49.
Go ahead, 49.
No.
I'm having a problem with my technician.
No, you don't know what you're doing.
He found a survivor at the crash site.
You've gotta listen to me.
She's impeding his abilities, and he is unfit for service.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.
Are you still an effective team?
Vika...
Open the goddamn door, Vika!
No.
We are not an effective team.
Vika, please.
We have to go now.
I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack.
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.
I'm going to Titan.
There is no Titan.
They lied to us.
Just stay away from me.
Vika, please, there are things...
Things you need to know.
I don't want to know!
Jack...
Hi, Jack. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
What have you done?
You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.
Sometimes things go wrong.
"Go wrong"?
You killed her.
I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.
Jack, we want to bring you in.
I've been authorized to tell you
we're going to assign you a new mission.
You and the survivor.
There's a lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.
We can debrief, then anything's possible.
It's time to come home, Jack.
Jack?
Jack?
Jack...
I'm sorry.
Hang on.
Lightning.
That's the plan.
We need cover.
There.
Are you okay?
No.
Don't worry, we're staying out of there.
Are we gonna die?
No!
Maybe.
Jack!
Son of a bitch.
Wait here.
Who is it?
Hey!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey!
Drop your weapon!
It's okay.
Don't move!
We have to shut that drone down.
Stop moving!
Jack!
It's okay.
Julia.
Julia!
Don't.
Don't touch me.
Hold on.
Just hold on.
Jack Harper, Tech-52.
Hey.
There you are.
What happened?
Are you okay?
That bogey came across the border and then I lost you.
False alarm.
I should get back out there.
You come all the way home, and I don't get a kiss?
What's going on up there?
I was thinking...
Why don't you come down with me?
To the surface?
We could go right now.
Now?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
You won't believe what's down there.
Jack...
You know the regulations.
Yes.
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.
Okay.
This is gonna hurt.
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?
You always loved this song.
I'm not him.
I know I'm not.
But I've loved you...
...for as long as I can remember.
I don't know how else to say it.
You know what you said to me once?
You said when it was all over, you would build me a house on a lake.
We would grow old and fat together.
And we would fight.
Maybe drink too much.
Real romantic.
And then we would die and be buried in a meadow by the lake.
And the world would forget about us.
But we would always have each other.
I remember.
Those memories are yours, Jack.
They're ours.
They are you.
Good morning.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.
You still can.
I have to go.
Those people need my help.
We'll come back when it's over.
Promise me.
We'll come back when it's over.
You had me worried for a second.
I thought you weren't coming back.
Well, I had to prove him wrong.
You look like shit.
You should see the other guy.
If I had told you what you'd find out there, you would have thought I was crazy.
I still do.
Malcolm Beech.
Julia Harper.
Come on.
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail
somewhere near the West Canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
Stand by.
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.
I'd been in the army less than a year when that unholy Tet arrived.
I saw the moon get taken out.
Right up there in the night sky.
I couldn't believe it.
After that, nature took over.
There's bedrock around Chicago, so we were spared the worst of the waves and the quakes.
Most people just starved.
Then the Tet sent troop ships down.
The doors opened, and out you came.
Astronaut Jack Harper.
Thousands of you.
Memory wiped.
Programmed to kill.
They had taken one of our best and turned him against us.
No soul.
No humanity.
The Tet.
What a brilliant machine.
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.
Phase Two was drones.
Repairmen.
50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.
Then one day,
I saw you set down.
Another drone to fix.
But in the rubble that day was a book.
You picked it up.
You studied it.
And I thought I saw a way.
When you stepped in front of that drone and saved her,
I knew.
You were in there somewhere.
I just had to find a way to bring you back.
Watch it, watch it.
Eyes on it.
Steady.
Give it some space.
Come on, you're making it nervous.
That is one pissed-off weapon.
No, it's just a machine.
I'm the weapon.
I would love to be there to see that thing's face when this goes off.
That would be a one-way trip.
Yeah, but it would be worth it.
Welcome back, Commander.
Open the doors!
Shit!
Spread out!
Head down, keep your head down!
Jack!
Follow me!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Hey!
Jack.
I'm okay.
The drone.
Send the drone.
It's gone.
I thought we had it.
I really did.
I can take the bomb myself.
Ah...
You know it will swat you like a fly.
Not if I go.
No.
She asked you to bring me up.
So bring me up.
We'll go together.
It reminds me of home.
Ready?
Jack.
Dream of us.
Jack...
Flight recorder playback for the Odyssey mission.
3 May, 2017.
Okay, Bob.
Ready for space?
Good morning, Odyssey, from your friends here at Mission Control.
Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.
Thank you for that fantastic wake-up call.
Pre-rendezvous checks complete.
Electrical guidance and nav systems, all good.
Range behind object,
250 clicks...
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.
Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.
After 39 days of sleep, sounds like you're ready to go.
I'm ready to go.
Your next burn will bring you up level
and co-speed at 50 kilometer range, where you'll hold.
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object for sensor scan and evaluation.
Targets look good.
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...
Ignition.
We see a good burn.
Are you reading any output from the object?
Negative.
Zero heat.
No EMR.
There's no sign of life.
How is the rest of the crew doing?
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should be up here shortly.
The rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.
Copy that.
You missed a hell of a game last night.
What did I tell you guys? No spoilers about last night's game.
I'm looking forward to watching it when I get back.
You're not talking about football already, are you?
Good morning, Vika.
Good morning, Sally.
How are you doing this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise.
Hey.
One for history.
Yeah.
Tech-49,
I have you on approach.
Hello, Sally.
It's a busy morning, huh?
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.
It's Julia Rusakova, the female survivor from the crashed module.
State your intention.
Deliver the survivor, as requested.
We are a more effective team.
Proceed to entry.
Mission, we have a situation.
The last burn was spot-on to give us a 50-click hold from object, but radar range still decreasing.
We're accelerating toward the object.
We're going to need full OMS burn to pull away.
Initiate now.
Entering target.
Gimbals set.
Target's good.
Arm forward engines.
Engines on.
Ready? Let's go.
Mission, we're in full OMS burn, trying to back out.
There's a lot of vibration.
We're not getting away from this thing.
Odyssey, telemetry shows structural overstress.
Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?
Cutting off burn.
Mission.
Mission?
Mission?
Sally?
Increased acceleration toward the object.
Estimated contact within two minutes.
I'm going to eject the sleep module.
It's programmed for reinsertion into Earth orbit.
I'll fly the Command module out if I break free.
I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.
That's an order!
Jack, no, we're a team.
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!
Dream of us.
Jack...
Tech-49, enter at headway speed.
Entering at headway.
You buck up, Bob.
Don't go all shaky on me.
Jack, I can't help notice
your respiration and heart rate have increased.
I'm just excited to finally meet you, Sally.
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.
Yeah.
I feel bad about that.
Voice analysis indicates you are lying to me, Jack.
Tell me why you are here.
You have five seconds.
I want Julia to live.
I want our species to survive.
This is the only way.
Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.
Welcome home, Jack.
Come on.
Jack, you're doing the right thing.
I don't know what you are, or where you're from, but I'd like to tell you about something I read.
A story from Rome, a city you destroyed.
It's a classic.
There was a guy, Horatius, held the bridge alone against a whole army.
And what Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better..."
You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.
Everybody dies, Sally.
The thing is, to die well.
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.
No, it's not.
What Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better"
"Than facing fearful odds"
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!
"For the ashes of his fathers"
"And the temples of his Gods"
I created you, Jack.
I am your God.
Fuck you, Sally.
Earth, after the war.
Three years have passed since I saw your face.
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.
In the day, as memories.
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?
And I wonder if you see me
when you look at her.
Mommy, look.
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.
Undimmed by time.
Unbound by death.
For three years, I searched for the house he built.
I knew it had to be out there.
Because I know him.
I am him.
Who's that?
I am Jack Harper.
And I am home.
(MAN) Now listen. Tell Simon that
Tommy has the plans and the model.
I'll be back in about ten days, and I can take over then.
Well, it's all come at a bad time, really.
Dan? Hello?
It always happens in the same place.
Quite convenient, actually.
You're having a few days away from the wee ones, are you?
Er, just a bit of peace and quiet, really.
You're going to the right place for that, boy.
There you go.
Now, the CB goes straight through to me.
If you need help, just call.
I'll be over on Saturday unless I hear from you. OK?
- Thank you, Doug.
- Thanks, Doug.
Be good!
Kate! I was thinking we'd go for a walk.
Maybe after breakfast?
- Kate?
- Uh-huh?
I was thinking we could do that walk.
You know the one? Around the coast?
- (TYPING)
- Let's just see how I go with this, OK?
OK. Yeah.
(GASPS) Oh...
You OK?
Ready?
- Aw, no, they're babies!
- What are you talking about?
We'll grill these two feckers on toast with a bit of lemon, and mwah!
- Come on, bring them in.
- Ah... le poisson!
Wow.
Look at that.
Mm.
- 2002, huh?
- Mm-hm.
All right. I'll get rid of these.
Shit!
Oh, great.
- How was it?
- It was a cold bath.
Doug'll be here in the morning.
He'll sort it out.
Good.
I don't recall it giving us any trouble last time.
It's a while since you've been here, though.
Now, she's full of character,
I'll give you that.
She's never down for long.
No, I tried that, mate. It didn't work.
- There we are.
- (STEADY WHIR)
You've got to keep it down for a count of three.
- Ah.
- Keep it down hard, mind.
To kick-start her again, read these and that'll do the trick. Good man.
Right.
Oh! I almost forgot.
- There's a present from Mrs. Doug.
- Ah!
Now, she baked them specially, so watch your teeth.
That's very kind.
Tell her thanks very much from us.
Not much for her to do up this part of the world. It's that, or talk to me.
- And I tell you, I'm never short of cake.
- (CHUCKLES)
- How are you getting on here, you two?
- Good.
Not gone mad yet?
No, we love this island.
We've had some good times here.
You've found them again, have you?
- Right, I'll see you later, Martin.
- Great. Thanks a million, Doug. Bye.
Kate?
- Kate, I was calling you.
- Hang on a second!
Just give me a minute, OK?
Well... the dinner's on the table.
Martin!
- Martin!
- Yeah! I'm down here.
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's gone again.
That's a good look.
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
I was just running a bath, and it just went.
- Any luck.
- No.
I've held it down for three.
That doesn't seem to be working.
So it says, "Use a ratchet screwdriver.
"Make sure the isolating switch on the front of the generator is off.
We have an " intermittent malfunction of the cut-out".
Yeah, definitely got that.
Yeah.
What the fuck is a ratchet screwdriver?
Shit!
- (GROANS)
- Doug, Martin's been injured.
The generator practically blew up on him. Over.
It's a hairy old thing, but I didn't know it had gone that bad. Over.
Doug, it's... Don't worry.
Aye, well, I'll bring my doctor over anyway.
It'll be tomorrow now. Don't touch the generator until we get there. Over.
All right.
Thanks, Doug. See you. Over and out.
Over and out.
There's absolutely nothing.
I guess I'll try and call him on the CB again.
Yeah. It's just impossible to cook on a fire.
Er... are you OK with bread and cheese?
It's fine, Kate. I'll sort it out.
What are you doing?
I was getting some wood and I found this thing.
We've waited all day and Doug hasn't turned up.
It's getting dark.
We've got to sort this out.
Doug, this is the Fairweather Cottage. Over.
(SIGHS) Come on.
This is the Fairweather Cottage. Over.
If you'd just calm down...
Could we row to him?
Could we row to the mainland?
- It's miles away. It's freezing.
- OK. So we could be just stranded here.
Please don't be silly. Come on.
What did we think, coming back here?
Coming back to the same place, like we're gonna just solve all our problems.
I don't see what that has to do with this.
Come on, Martin, this is just torture, being back here!
Kate!
I'm really trying my best here.
If you want me to apologize again, I will.
I am so... so sorry... I wasn't there.
I'm sorry the power went out, I'm sorry the fucking generator exploded.
I'm sorry for bringing us back here.
I'm sorry for all of it.
You didn't even want him.
Jesus Christ. Please...
Martin!
There's someone here! I just saw them!
(MARTIN) This is Fairweather Cottage on Blackholme Island.
We need to report an injured man.
We need medical assistance, please.
Over and out.
Doug, if you can hear us, this is
Martin and Kate. Please contact us.
Just think for a second.
OK, he just...
He's got to have come on a boat from the mainland.
Then the boat would be at the beach.
You go, and I'll stay with the CB.
OK, I'll be back.
(WHISPERS) Shit.
No boat. Nothing.
What?
Fucking hell.
Maybe we should just go. Let's just go.
Kate, listen. There's no boat, there's no way out, there's nothing.
- (WHISPERS) A fucking gun!
- I know.
- OK, we have to get it off him.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Listen, Kate.
- No.
If he's from the military, he'll understand.
If he's not in the military, we don't know who the hell he is.
OK.
Go. Bedroom.
- (CLANG)
- (GASPS)
Water. I need some water.
I need some water.
What happened?
I was making a crossing in some rough water and my boat got sucked into the rocks.
Please.
Martin!
You OK?
Er...
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
Private Jack Coleman.
Tactical Response.
Martin Kennedy.
Thank you both for taking me in.
- His boat sank.
- I was trying to avoid those rocks.
And as I was saying to...
- I'm Kate.
...Kate.
The tides in that water...
I just remember the rocks and the water coming in.
Are you Army? Navy?
Army.
We're doing a reconnaissance exercise in the area.
Do you think they're looking for you?
Yeah.
Does your CB work?
Er... No, actually. It's been down for the last two days. I can't...
I can't get through to the owner, Doug.
He set it to his frequency but I haven't been able to get through.
Maybe you could have a look.
I should be able to fix it.
So it's just the two of you?
On the island?
Yes.
Yes. Doug is... Doug is the owner.
He's on the mainland.
Ah.
It's just in there.
And there's a bathroom opposite.
- Do you think you need anything else?
- I don't think so, no. Thank you.
- Get some rest.
- Thanks.
I need to speak with you alone.
Are you going to give it to him?
No.
No.
Erm... I'm just gonna go talk to him for a sec.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
What... What are you doing?
Do you want to take a seat for me,
Martin?
No, actually, I'm fine.
I'm gonna tell you something, and you're gonna listen.
And then you're gonna do as I say.
These three things are essential to the safety of you and your wife.
Do you understand me so far?
Yeah.
There's been an outbreak.
A global pandemic that started in South America.
R1N16. Argromoto flu.
It's a highly contagious airborne virus that attacks respiratory systems.
From those infected there are no survivors.
It's fatal and it's spreading rapidly.
It's only a matter of time before it's here.
If your radio was working you'd have heard the broadcasts.
Now, our best defense is to make this place safe.
- Am I going too quickly for you?
- Wait, wait. What...
What exactly are you telling me?
I'm telling you that a highly contagious and fatal disease is on its way here, and we need to protect ourselves.
The official line on this from the military is to stay inside and seal up your home for the best chance of survival.
We need to start now.
How come you don't have it?
Eh? How come you don't have it?
I don't have it... because of my airtight suit and respirator, courtesy of the British Army.
I'm not fuckin' around, Martin.
The Army's known about this for weeks.
We tried to contain it, but this thing's just uncontrollable.
So we've all been deployed to maintain order.
Yeah? So where's your fucking suit, huh?
When my boat sank, it was either ditch the lot or drown.
(KATE) Martin?
You don't want your wife contracting this.
Believe me.
I don't wanna have to hurt anyone.
- What's going on?
- It's fine, Kate.
Come here.
Just come. Come here.
- Martin, you're shaking!
- He can hear.
He's just told me there's a disease out there, a pandemic.
- It's killing everybody...
- What?!
He's got to seal the place up.
That's what he told me.
- (BANGING)
- He has to seal the house up against it.
- OK, enough.
- Look... Kate!
Hey!
We would know if there was a disease.
Doug would have come and told us.
Hopefully, for his sake, he's been sealing up his house like everyone else.
This is bullshit.
This is bullshit!
If you want to go, go.
But do it before I seal this place up.
Once that door is shut... it's not opening again.
He's fucking crazy.
We should just get our things and go.
Kate...
I have no idea what is actually going on out there.
All that I know... is that for the moment we are stuck on this island.
We're surrounded by freezing water and there's nowhere else to go.
I want to go home.
And I'm not staying here with him.
We have that.
We have his gun.
Now all we can do is play along and keep him sweet until I can figure out exactly what's going on.
Because I don't want to see anybody get hurt.
(WHISPERS) Martin!
Martin!
- (HAMMERING CLOSE BY)
- (CHEERY WHISTLING)
Morning.
Kettle's on if you want some tea.
- This is Kate of Fairweather Cottage.
- (HAMMERING)
Doug, this is Kate...
The battery works but it's not receiving anything. I checked it last night.
Doug? This is Martin and Kate.
Do you read us? Over.
I'll need to take a look at that generator as well because your power's out.
- Why have you barricaded the door?
- To stop people bringing the infection.
I thought it was against the risk of a virus.
Everything we do here is to minimize the risk, not just of the virus but of people trying to escape it.
I was gonna ask you, do you have any weapons in the house?
- Hunting rifle, anything like that?
- No.
Anything we can use to defend ourselves?
No, we don't have anything like that here.
Then I'm gonna have to improvise.
Get something out of that and give me a hand.
And the tinned food in the kitchen needs organizing.
Martin!
How do you know that we haven't got it?
We've been outside.
You don't have it.
That fucker doesn't hang around.
- You breathe it in, you cough it out.
- That's the first symptom? A cough?
Uh-huh. You breathe the microbes into your lungs, they attack the host cells, which is you.
You cough those out and then the rest comes out as liquid.
We just...
We need to contact our families.
We need to...
You said you'd fix the CB.
There's nothing out there for you anymore.
Now I need your help. You can start by sorting the food in the kitchen.
Go fuck yourself!
Help me shift this against the door.
She's got a lot of fire for a little thing, hasn't she?
Personally I like my women like that, but for you it must be hard, her being the boss.
Are you sure you can handle it? Yeah?
Martin...
Start on those chairs, yeah?
Good start.
- I'm going to try the CB.
- Knock yourself out.
This is Fairweather Cottage.
Can someone read me? Over.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
Do you have kids?
Obviously not.
Really? I thought you and Martin would have had them by now.
It's none of your business.
Is it me you're afraid of?
You don't need to be afraid, Kate.
Me and Martin will get this place taken care of.
We'll seal it up and it'll just be the three of us.
Like a family.
Kate?
Label it. Better get started on upstairs.
Shh. There are people here.
There's two or three of them.
When they saw the cottage they hit the ground.
Come on. Come on.
Get down.
I only saw two or three but there's probably more waiting on the shore.
We cannot let them in here.
Get down.
Get back.
Fuck.
They know we're here.
Here.
Pick it up.
Fucking pick it up, mate.
Martin!
Martin!
Jack, here's your gun.
Get down.
Slide it over.
Slide it over.
You're gonna take that side. Yeah?
Stay away from the windows. Go!
Martin! Take this.
- We're all armed in here!
- Jack!
Jack... Jack!
- (KATE) Martin...
- Kate, get down!
They heard the shots and they're heading for the shore.
They're gone?
For now.
There was people outside, Kate.
There was people!
Tell her, Jack.
They'll be back.
We have to be on our guard from now on at all times.
You did good.
Ah!
So your base, is it near here?
Yeah.
What's it called?
- The base?
- What's the base called?
It's called Goose Bay.
You're trying to figure that one out, are you?
She's all fucking confused.
Fuck me.
If you're finished with your questions
I'm gonna get on.
That was champion.
How can you sit there and not say anything?
Maybe if you could resist antagonizing him at every opportunity...
What would you suggest?
What's your big fucking plan, Martin?
There are ways, Kate. But you don't just bulldoze in every time.
You're right.
We should just give him the gun back, just let him take over.
I don't think so!
We can't have her jeopardizing our safety.
You do understand that, don't you?
We need to work together.
You and me. Yeah?
'Cause we can't have her making the fucking decisions.
Yeah?
It's getting cold, isn't it?
I'll take a look at that generator for you.
But I might need a hand.
I can help.
I'd appreciate that.
Yeah.
Would you pass me the screwdriver there?
- That one?
- That's the one.
- It's not going to work.
- What?
I said it's not... going to work.
- He thinks it just...
- Just needs rewiring.
The connection's fucked.
You want to get the fire going?
Why don't you go and do that?
Shine the light here.
- What are you trying to do, Kate?
- We fixed the generator.
I'm not talking about the fucking generator.
I'm playing along.
I'm still here, Kate.
- There's hot water.
- Please don't fucking do this.
Did Martin say you could borrow his stuff?
I didn't think he would mind.
- Smells good.
- Those need cutting.
I'm your man.
Have you been in the Army long?
I signed up when I was 18.
So that's... six, seven years.
Six or seven years.
I saw that scar on your arm.
No, that was just a friendly disagreement, that.
I wondered if it was painful.
Are you married?
I was, once. Yeah.
No kids?
Didn't get the chance.
Why's that?
The disease saw to that.
Oh.
What was she like?
Your wife.
She...
She'd been through a lot.
Tried to put a brave face on it, but really she was just fragile.
Probably deserving of a better man.
Slim, petite.
Dark skin, dark hair.
She was beautiful.
She was funny, too.
Sounds nice.
She was out of my league, really.
Oh... I wouldn't say that.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Ow.
- What were you doing?
- I was just...
- Oh, my God!
- Were you trying to be nice?
- You're breaking my arm.
- To get the gun?
Or were you just desperate?
How long has it been, Kate?
How long has it been since he gave you what you want?
- Please... Ow!
- It's all right.
Just a friendly disagreement.
But mention my wife again and it won't be. Understand?
I'm sorry.
(WHISPERS) If I really wanted what's in your pants,
I'd just take it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I read your little article, too.
I wouldn't leave that shit lying around if I were you.
He really doesn't know you at all, does he?
I need to tell you something.
I... haven't... been honest with you.
I...
I stopped taking the pill.
That's how I got pregnant.
It wasn't an accident.
You kept saying you weren't ready.
(SOBS) I'm sorry.
- (KATE) This is all my fault.
- (SIGHS)
I'm so...
- I love you.
- I love you.
We'll fix this.
Kate and I are leaving now, Jack.
We're gonna risk it outside... because we just really need to see our families.
But we don't want any more trouble.
You're a fuckin' piece of work, you, aren't you?
Hm?
Have you told him?
Why don't you tell Martin what I read?
He knows everything.
Everything.
I see.
It's over, Jack.
I'm just going to take those boards down, and we're gonna take our stuff and we're gonna go.
- (GUNSHOTS)
- (SCREAMS)
- Please, no! Please!
- Move!
- Kate!
- Over there!
Get down. Down on the floor.
On your knees!
Go ahead.
Face on the floor.
Put your face on the floor.
Martin... (SOBS)
Repeat after me.
We aren't going anywhere.
- Say it!
- (SCREAMS)
- Say it!
- We are not going anywhere.
We are not... going anywhere. Please...
It's just the three of us.
- It's OK, Kate. It's OK.
- (SOBBING)
- Say it.
- It's just the three of us.
- Martin...
- It's OK.
Please... (CRIES OUT)
You had the chance to leave and you didn't take it.
Morning.
Do you want to make me some breakfast, sweetheart?
It's all ready for you.
Did you write in this?
Yeah.
A journalist and an architect.
"Will never forget this place.
"Will be back.
"Oh, yes, we will be back."
That was back in 2002.
- (YELLS)
- Drop it! Drop it!
Kate, drop it. It's OK, it's OK.
- Drop it or I'll blow his fuckin' head off!
- Don't fucking touch him!
Why would you do that?!
I'm just trying to be fucking civil!
- We know what you are!
- Yeah? Do you wanna tell me?
- Jack...
- Tell me what I am!
She's fucking scared, man!
For fuck's sake!
She's fucking scared, man.
Is it that fucking hard for us all just to fucking get along?!
Is it?!
Out! Move!
- Are they dry yet?
- Yeah. Almost. Almost done, I think.
He's coming.
Quick! Stow it.
Both of you downstairs.
- What for?
- Downstairs!
Move!
Come on.
- Pick it up!
- Martin.
- What's wrong with him?
- Just give me a second.
- He's having an asthma attack.
- Just a minute.
- Honey, where's your inhaler?
- Bedroom.
- Uh-uh! We all go.
- (RASPING)
Give the man a fuckin' hand.
(WHEEZING) It's OK. It's OK.
Put your hands up!
Hands up where I can see 'em!
Put your hands up!
Where'd you put the inhaler?
Bathroom?
Stop! Wait!
Move.
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air!
Put your fucking hands up!
OK. Take the gun, Kate.
- What?
- Take the gun.
- Let go, Jack.
- Hm?
Let the fucking gun go.
Let it go.
- You've been outside.
- Yeah, and I saw Doug's body
- and his wife's body!
- I told you people were here.
- Who did that, Jack?
- I told you...
- (CLICKS)
- It's empty.
OK. I got him.
Just come back towards me.
Back you come.
Keep coming. Keep going.
- You finally took control, then?
- Stop talking to me.
He didn't strike me as a man with a gun, but I bet you like that.
- She likes a man with a gun.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!
Huh?
That's not bad for an architect.
Just keep going.
What are you gonna do now, huh?
What's your big fuckin' plan?
You have no idea, do you?
You're gonna shoot me?
Martin.
Stop it!
I would fucking do it.
I knew you had it in you.
Good for you.
Good for you.
All right. We're going to tie him up.
Tie him.
That's a good idea there.
- Hands behind your back.
- Turn around!
- You fuckin' people...
- Put your hands behind your back.
- You're doing a good job.
- Tie him up!
Martin.
- That's it.
- (COUGHING)
That's the first symptom.
He's got it.
He's got the fucking disease.
There is no fucking disease!
Martin! Oh, my God!
I fuckin' told you!
Does that look like fuckin' asthma to you?!
He's been outside. He's got the disease.
Get the door open, Kate.
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.
He went outside and breathed the air when I told him not to!
Jack, please, get him some help.
- This is all the help he's gonna need.
- You fuck! No!
Oh, fuck.
You don't want Kate to have to see you like this.
I'll tell her you went quickly.
Yeah?
Won't be long till it's just the two of us.
He needs help.
We need to get him help!
Oh, yeah? You think someone out there is gonna help us? Huh?
You go out there and it's bam! Yeah?
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.
- He's not dying here.
- We're already dead!
From the moment...
- You killed him.
- (COUGHING)
Martin... Martin.
Martin...
I'm gonna get us help.
I'm gonna find a way. OK?
- And we're gonna get out of here.
- (WHEEZES)
This is Fairweather Cottage.
Blackholme Island.
There are three people known... to be dead, and there's one ser... seriously injured.
This is an urgent call for help.
This is Blackholme Island,
Fairweather Cottage.
We need help.
There are three people known...
Jack.
We don't care what's out there.
We... we don't want to die here.
The disease isn't outside.
It's in here.
It's right here.
You liar!
Agh!
Who the fuck are you?
And I want the truth.
My husband's dying.
Tell me.
They gave me a choice.
Do time in prison, or go to a military hospital.
At the hospital they started testing these new drugs.
I was a lab rat.
They lied to me!
And they filled me full of this shit.
They gave me this fatal fuckin' disease.
They gave it to me.
- You escaped?
- No.
Then they just let me walk away.
They made a mistake.
They discharged me when they shouldn't have done.
Then my wife came by the training centre to pick me up.
How was I supposed to know
I was contagious?
I gave it to her.
I gave it to my wife.
I killed her.
Why should I believe you?
Did you kill Doug and his wife?
Did you?
They found me in their boat shed.
I had to get off the mainland and make a crossing.
I knew that I was the carrier.
So I made them take me out to sea.
They got it really quick.
Maybe because they were older, but...
What would you have done?
What would you have done?
You knew we'd be infected.
You knew it wasn't outside.
It was in you.
You took me in.
You took me in. I couldn't stop that.
But I couldn't let you go outside and risk infecting others. I had to contain it.
I had to contain me!
But I swear to you...
I never wanted to kill anyone.
Oh, my love...
It's gonna be... It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine. Don't...
What have you done to us?
You knew it worked.
I couldn't have you contacting anyone.
...members of the public. An armed and dangerous man has escaped from a secure military compound in your area.
Private Jack Coleman was last seen wearing green combat fatigues.
Under no circumstances should you approach him.
Avoid any contact.
Report all sightings to the authorities.
This is a high-alert open military broadcast to all members of the public.
- An armed and dangerous man...
- You tell them.
I can't do that.
(SHAKILY) I can't do that.
You tell them what you've done.
Do it!
This isn't gonna bring Martin back.
You tell them what you've done.
This isn't gonna help us!
Come in. Come in. Over.
Come in. Come in. Over.
(FEMALE) This is HMS Walker.
Please identify yourself.
If you have come into contact with Private Coleman and have any symptoms of infection, we have an antiviral vaccine.
Now you believe me, that is lies.
They want you to hear that!
That's not true!
We have a vaccine.
No, Kate...
- Martin could have been saved.
- No. There is no vaccine for this.
They didn't even know what it is I have!
They just want to know where we are so they can come and kill us both!
Please believe me.
We're never gonna leave this island.
We'll never leave it.
ENGLISH SDH www.sdimedia.com
Today really marks the first stage
of an unprecedented technological advancement.
We have begun to identify so-called Goldilocks planets.
These are planets that share a similar relationship with their sun
as we have with ours.
If a planet's too far away from its sun, it's too cold.
If it's too close to its sun, it's too hot.
But for an Earth-like planet, the distance is just right.
Potentially perfect for sustaining life.
We have finally managed to identify one planet
that is the right distance from its star to hold water
and is the right mass to sustain an atmosphere.
Every 24 hours, our station in Hawaii
will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite, which will amplify and relay the signal to our targeted planet which is, rather grandly, entitled Planet G.
If there is intelligent life out there, and they come here it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.
Only, we're the Indians.
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to bear witness to the making of history.
Start transmission.
It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop
right here in our own backyard.
Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.
Satellite dishes here on Oahu
sending out very powerful signals into deep space
with an attempt to communicate with anyone...
Another round, birthday boy.
...or anything that might be out there listening.
A toast.
Happy birthday, little brother.
I'm wishing you success and growth, and happiness.
May this be a great year for you.
It's going to be a great year.
I love you.
I love you, too.
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition, this year I'm quoting from Coach John Wooden.
Johnny.
"Adversity is the state in which man""
"most easily becomes acquainted with himself"
"being especially free of admirers then."
Cheers.
I'm not cheers-ing that.
It's a very good quote for you.
"I may be free of admirers right now but there is still time"?
Will you shut up?
Light your cupcake and raise your glass.
Did you get me that?
Yes, I got you that.
Thank you, that's very sweet.
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.
I got this guy, Tony. He said he can get you a construction job.
All you need to do is call him.
Could I get a beer and a chicken burrito, please?
Sorry, kitchen's closed.
You're not going to call him, are you?
Give Tony my best, but I don't need you or Tony's help, for that matter.
You can call him or join me in the Navy.
No.
Great. All right.
Happy birthday. Blow out your candle and make a wish.
Do not waste a wish on a girl.
Wish for a job, an apartment.
A new alternator belt, so I don't have to drive you everywhere.
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.
It's my birthday and my wish.
All right?
Please don't waste it.
You just wasted that wish, didn't you?
I'm going in.
You're not going in.
How do I look?
Wait, let me just fix that.
Awesome!
All right, princess, go get 'em.
Great start.
Ugh.
What seems to be the problem?
I want a chicken burrito.
Johnny, chicken burrito her.
It ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.
What's your name?
I'm hungry.
That's not your name.
If you give me five minutes
I will get you your chicken burrito.
Five minutes, starting now.
Chicken burrito time, I'm out.
Chicken burrito, roger that.
Wait! Hi!
No! Let's just...
Just one twist of the key and we will be good.
How are you, ma'am?
How you doing?
Burritos, right there.
It's closed.
Too late, pal.
Okay.
It's right there. Please?
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.
Chicken burrito.
I got it!
Hey! Freeze!
I got a burrito!
I got it!
Freeze!
Stay down!
He's getting back up!
I've had it!
Look at yourself!
How is it that you screw everything up?
By the way, that girl you were trying to impress last night, do you know who her father is?
Admiral Shane!
He runs the whole damn fleet!
So, now you're messing with my job. My life!
You know that girl?
The burrito girl?
I've always stayed out of your business, haven't I?
Because I was hoping that maybe one day you would learn from your mistakes.
You would grow up, you would mature a bit!
Is my back all right?
Oh, my God! My back!
You're 26, and what have you got?
You got, what?
Sixty-five dollars to your name?
I got tazed.
A car that doesn't start.
You're living on my couch!
Those things work!
Man, look at yourself.
Oh, my God.
As from now, as from right this second, there is a new dynamic at play.
And this dynamic is the following.
From here on, until I state otherwise, there will be no more debate, no more discussion, no more compromise!
It's me speaking, you listening.
Me saying, you doing.
Do you understand that?
It's time for a new course of action.
A new direction.
A game change.
You are joining me in the Navy.
Live, local, this is Hawaii News Now.
Thousands of sailors on dozens of ships
are coming to Hawaii for RIMPAC
RIMPAC is the world's largest
multinational maritime exercise.
RIMPAC is a military ballet of 14 navies...
20, 000 Navy personnel.
Cooperation and collaboration amongst the countries is the goal.
Relationship-building is the key.
Not all the action is taking place out on the water.
There will also be sporting events here on land.
Forget World Cup, this is the RIMPAC Cup final.
It's another beautiful day here in Hawaii, as usual.
Indeed it is, but a storm is brewing on the field
as the scrappy U.S.A. team is butting heads with Japan.
The score is 2-nil, Japan.
The U.S. has been trailing all day.
Team leader Alex Hopper has got to do something to rally the troops here.
Turn it up!
Big save! Great save!
Big save! Stone Hopper, he's answered every test today.
What's wrong with you, drama queen?
Get up, princess, come on!
U.S.A.'s Ordy squares the ball over to number 6, Alan.
Clever backheel into space...
Hopper... Goal!
A missile, past Iwashiro.
The U.S. is finally on the board, showing some signs of life
with the score, 2-1, Japan.
We are now into stoppage time.
Can the U.S. tie it up?
Time! Time! Time!
One minute left.
Alex, it's coming your way!
Stone Hopper has placed it perfectly.
It takes a fortuitous bounce.
Hopper is underneath it and on-side.
Hey, ref!
A penalty kick has been awarded to the United States.
Nagata made contact with
Hopper inside the box.
And by "contact," you mean Nagata kicked him in the face.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Stone Hopper has come up the field.
I'm fine.
I don't need your help.
Bronson is going to take it.
Bronson!
What do you mean, "Bronson"?
No, negative.
I'm fine. Bronson, you're gonna take this.
Bronson, don't move.
Bronson, come here.
Bronson, you move one more step, you're dead!
Do you want to die today?
Do you want to die?
Good choice.
He is definitely concussed.
You just threatened one of my sailors.
Looks like it's going to be his little brother, Alex Hopper.
If I was Stone, I would have picked another shooter.
I'm skeptical that
Hopper is 100 percent.
Engage, engage.
Impose will, impose will.
There are two kinds of idiots, Hopper.
One looks where he kicks, the other looks where he doesn't kick.
Which idiot are you?
I'm the idiot that's going to kick it through your keeper's face.
Get ready for overtime.
All eyes on Hopper.
He could send this into overtime.
ANNOUNCER And here we go.
If Hopper scores, the U.S. will go into overtime.
Oh!
Hopper sails one miles over the crossbar, nowhere near the goal...
typical.
What a heartbreak for the U.S.
It was a very poor attempt by the obviously injured Alex Hopper.
He refused to come out of the game
and his stubbornness cost the United States.
Congratulations to Japan, our 2012 RIMPAC Cup winners.
The final, as we sign off,
Japan, 2.
The United States, 1.
Are you ready for this?
Born.
Are you sure?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What are you going to say?
I'm going to walk up to him, man to man, and look him straight in the eyes.
With what words?
My words.
Okay.
"Sir..."
"Your daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me."
"She's smart, kind, beautiful, funny,"
"and I'm madly in love with her."
"It would be an honor to have your permission to marry her."
I love you.
I love you, too.
First off, I'd like to welcome you all to the RIMPAC International Na val War Games.
And I'd like to welcome you on board
the greatest fighting ship in American naval history.
The “Mighty Mo," the U.S.S. Missouri.
And fought in World War II...
Shit!
Hopper, your cover.
I'm keeping you on your toes.
Hopper, let's go, come on.
Hopper!
This way.
No, no, no.
That way, sir.
Yes, yes, I knew that.
We knew that.
You look good.
The U.S.S. Missouri was the final battleship to be completed by the United States before being de-commissioned and replaced with a more modern fleet of vessels, like destroyers.
What's the difference between a battleship and a destroyer?
Battleships are great ships.
But they are kind of like dinosaurs.
They're designed to take hits, like a floating punching bag.
But then there's destroyers, which are just awesome.
They're designed to dish it out like the Terminator.
Are you a Captain?
No, he's not a Captain because he's always late. Come on.
I fight the ship.
Which is even better.
Listen, get it done.
Get it done.
Babe, it's a formality.
Okay, go.
I'm all over it.
We have with us today, veterans from the Missouri
who have served on her, some going back to World War II.
Examples of the finest men to have ever served in any navy.
Lieutenant Hopper, what an honor.
Thank you for joining us.
Good to be here.
And now, as we prepare to embark
on this outstanding exercise...
I'm nervous.
Shades off.
I would like the Commanding
Officers to come to the stage.
Captain Nagata, Japan.
Captain Lou, Malaysia.
It's so close to the way we say it.
He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
Shut up. Shut up.
Captain Jacks, Australia.
G'day.
Shut up.
G'day!
Shut up.
G'day.
A special acknowledgment to Commander
Stone Hopper, United States Navy.
Go, that's your call.
Knock 'em out.
Who, along with his outstanding crew and ship,
had the highest overall rating last year.
Shades off, Hopper.
Commander.
Thank you, Admiral.
Welcome, everybody. It's really great to see you all here today.
Especially you, gentlemen.
It's a true honor.
Me and my crew, we're going to have to be on our toes this year
because your ships look outstanding and your men look ready.
So, good luck out there.
Be safe and keep charging.
He loves his daughter, she loves you.
He's going to respect that.
Hey, Mike.
Admiral.
You remember Sam?
It's an obsolete tradition, this asking for permission.
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.
Sam's a physical therapist now.
Stop worrying about this and walk up and do what you got to do.
Hello, Hopper.
Why are you here?
This is going to be sweet.
I was within the rules.
Really?
Were you in the rules when you kicked me in the face?
Isn't there something more important you should be doing right now?
He hates the man.
That seems a bit juvenile, wouldn't you say?
Go mess with him and see what happens.
- Why?
- Do it.
Would it be funny if I punched you in the face?
Would that be funny?
Stop it.
Chicken.
Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.
You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.
He was a handsome man.
Good job out there, Dad.
What do you want?
Hopper needs five minutes of your time.
That's enough.
What do you mean?
Don't you have something more important you should be doing right now?
Three minutes, tops.
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.
Love you, too.
He's going to smash my face in.
He's not going to smash your face in.
Oh, my God.
Sir, it would be an honor.
Sir. Sir. Sir.
Give me your permission.
It would be an honor to have your permission.
Sir, give me your permission.
What's your deal?
It would be a thankful honor to have your permission to honor your hand.
What?
Oh, my God.
Sir.
May I please marry your daughter?
She's everything I have, and I love her.
Talking to yourself,
Mr. Hopper?
Yeah, I was.
I was actually talking about you, Nagata.
Mmm-hmm.
That's for kicking me in the face.
Eat it! Take it!
Let go! Let go.
What the...
Sir, it was a fluke accident.
The bathroom floor was wet.
I began to fall.
Captain Nagata kindly reached out to help.
Our heads go bang.
We fall back.
Bang, again.
Just like the great
Jerry Lewis.
Jerry Lewis?
Did he just say "Jerry Lewis"?
Yes, sir.
Are you kidding me?
The Bellboy and original
The Nutty Professor.
Very good movies.
He is a great humanitarian, sir.
You both think this is a joke and you are very much mistaken.
This will not happen again.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, give me a minute with Mr. Hopper, here.
What is wrong with you?
You've got skills, but I have never ever seen a man waste them like you.
"Keep the ship out of the surf and spray..."
"...or you will plunge to destruction."
Homer, sir.
The fact that you know that infuriates me beyond words.
What my daughter sees in you is a great mystery to me.
You are a very smart individual with very weak character, leadership and decision-making skills.
Do you have anything to say to me? Anything?
Negative, sir.
Enjoy these naval exercises, Hopper.
They are likely to be your last.
Dismissed.
Is there anything
I can do to help?
Negative.
If you want to talk about anything...
I don't.
If you change your mind...
I won't.
Roger that.
Contact DESRON ONE. Commence anti-submarine warfare exercises.
Commence air operations.
Good afternoon, Sampson.
Welcome to Day One of the RIMPAC naval war games.
We are here to sharpen our skills as a team.
As your weapons officer, let me remind you that this is a combat vessel and we will excel in our command and control.
I want everyone to stay frosty.
We're going to be close-maneuvering with 13 nations out here.
We are here to crush every other ship.
I'm excited to see what we learn.
We are not here in this weapons room to learn.
Be safe out there, look out for each other and keep charging.
If we return to Pearl without having outperformed every other ship on that ocean,
I will personally...
Yo, Saunders, we've ended up in a department run by some kind of Donald
Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.
What was that,
Petty Officer Raikes?
Nothing, sir.
I swear you said, "Donald
Trump." Want to clarify?
I think I heard a "Mike
Tyson," as well.
If you did, it was only in reference to the fact that you both project great physical intensity, sir.
That's flattering.
Hopper! There's a helo headed for the Sampson.
Make sure your ass is on it.
Why?
I don't know why!
Just make sure you're on it!
Copy, sir.
Damn.
Scorpion one four, clear our deck.
En route with parts and techs.
Confirm
Lieutenant Hopper en route.
I just got off the phone with the JAG.
And?
They are probably going to kick you out of the Navy.
When?
The day we get back.
From RIMPAC?
Yeah.
You have got to make some calls.
There has got to be...
Who do I call to teach you humility?
I am sorry,
I don't have that number.
I just don't get it, man.
You have got so much potential.
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.
And I am sorry I let you down.
Stand up nice and tall.
I want you to focus on that green marker, right in the middle of your back.
What do you think
I'm paying attention to?
Keep your feet together.
My feet can't get any closer.
Stand up tall. All right.
I had enough of this.
Keep going.
Just a little bit more.
Turn the damned thing off!
Come on.
We're just about there.
Turn it off now!
I'm your new physical therapist.
I am sensing a lot of anger.
Very perceptive of you.
Is there anything besides anger in there, Mick?
Not much.
Your last therapist says that you lost the will to fight.
Is that accurate?
I lost my fight when I lost my legs.
Do you realize you're still the same man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?
A Bronze Star in Afghanistan?
The same man.
I am half a man.
And half a man ain't enough to be a soldier.
That's all I have ever known.
All right. Let's go.
We are going to take a walk.
No, we are not.
Legs on.
You're doing pretty good for a guy who doesn't want to be hiking.
My dog, Mustard, could climb this mountain.
Great, you and Mustard can go and make some memories on Mauna Kea.
Sounds like fun.
Mustard's dead. Mustard got hit by a dump truck.
I'm sorry.
I'm over it.
Hey. I thought you would be out of range by now.
I have around five minutes of left time.
How is it?
It's fine.
I'm sorry. I messed up.
And I'm going to talk to your father as soon as I get back.
Stop messing things up, okay?
Copy that. I love you.
I love you.
What is it, Parker?
Take a look at this.
Nice one.
It's a joke, right?
I don't think so.
My God.
Cal.
Cal.
Huh? Cal!
Got some weird activity on all the radar screens.
Weird?
Yeah, man. Really weird.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, uh, Dr. Nogrady is on the phone for you, too.
That is weird.
Seriously, Dr. Nogrady?
Lead with that next time.
Okay, Danny?
You got to start prioritizing your information.
If you have to tell me "1,
2, 3," you don't start with
You know what I mean?
I mean, I'm not saying that you are a boob, but this is boob-ish behavior.
Hi, Dr. Nogrady.
Are you seeing what I am seeing?
The incoming tracks.
Correct.
I've got five distinct objects...
Five distinct objects that are moving in formation.
They are locked in on my signal.
They are headed straight for me.
Correct.
Maybe we should call NASA.
NASA have called us. They're on the phone right now.
Good morning,
Mr. Zapata.
NASA?
We are tracking something splintering off of the main group.
That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.
Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.
Yes, we have checked. It's not the
Russians, it's not the Chinese.
Maybe we should call the Air Force, because they might want to fuel up their jets.
The Air Force is online.
It appears the event is headed your way.
Prepare yourself.
Roger that. How would you suggest that I prepare myself, sir?
Brace.
Let's all be seated.
I am hoping somebody here can explain this to me.
Mr. Secretary, four of the five objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.
The fifth one appeared to have broken apart making significant contact with Hong Kong, but other places were also affected.
Scotland, Germany,
France, even Iowa.
So, what is it?
Sir, at this point we are working on a couple of theories.
And you are who, sir?
I am with NASA.
What is NASA present in this room for?
We are looking at the very real possibility
that this is legitimate extraterrestrial contact.
It appears that it originated from the Gliese solar system.
Home of Planet G.
You are saying that we sent out a signal and we got back an alien response?
Sir, we just got word from Pearl.
They believe whatever made impact with Hong Kong, has also made impact with the Pacific Ocean.
Where in the Pacific?
Approximately 150 miles south of where we are right now, sir.
It should be right there, but we are not seeing anything.
Get me the Sampson.
Yes, sir.
Base course, 2-2-0. Speed, 25.
Captain on the bridge!
As casualty reports come in,
it's still unclear exactly what it was that hit Hong Kong.
It isn't anything from this planet.
How do we know that?
Because the Chinese have sampled it.
It's made of a material that does not exist in the periodic table.
It's literally not of this Earth.
The only element they've been able to identify is lawrencium.
Lawrencium?
You got to stop tapping.
You're tapping.
You're the loud one.
Looking at the grid patterns,
it's something in the neighborhood
of solar paneling or communications paneling.
It may be some kind of a communication unit.
Communications?
Who is communicating what?
To who?
What the heck is that?
Bridge, starboard lookout. I've got an unknown surface contact.
Bearing is 2-3-2 true, approximately 8,000 yards.
Sir?
Yeah.
You may want to come take a look at this.
I am looking at it,
Mr. Strodell.
On the radar, sir.
Something very peculiar.
That's the
John Paul Jones, right?
Yes, sir.
The Myoko?
Yes, sir, it is.
So, why don't I see...
See that?
Combat, Captain. I have a visual on the track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.
What do you hold in that bearing?
Bridge, TAO.
I've got nothing at 2-3-7.
I'm looking right at it, Mr. Hopper.
Find me something.
Scope, 2-3-7, what do you got?
Stand by.
That's negative, sir.
Scope's clear, I got nothing.
Taylor, did you break this son-of-a-bitch?
No, I didn't do anything to it, sir.
You know I will throw your ass off this ship.
I know you will, sir.
Got it, sir.
On my camera.
What is it?
I don't know.
Is this some kind of exercise?
Probably.
Unknown vessel in the vicinity of
1-5 degrees, 3-7 minutes north,
and 1-5-9 degrees,
3-3 minutes west.
Request you establish communications
with my vessel on VHF channel 16, and identify yourself, over.
John Paul Jones, this is
Sampson, Charlie Oscar.
John Paul Jones, Charlie Oscar.
I would like you to send a team over and take a closer look.
No problem. We will get a team in the water right away.
Roger.
I'll tell you what, boys, this is a head-stumper.
What is it?
Lost cargo? Chinese?
I don't know.
Yacht? Satellite?
Beast, I didn't know five seconds ago, and I don't know now.
This is the U.S. Navy warship
John Paul Jones.
I'm attempting to communicate with you.
Prepare to be boarded.
You ever seen anything like this?
No.
It's weird, man.
LT! I don't think that's a good idea.
Got it, chief.
Real bad idea, Lieutenant.
Oh, shit.
Move it, Raikes!
LT!
Lieutenant, get up!
Lieutenant!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sir!
Get me the Sampson.
Alpha Bravo.
Sampson, this is Alpha Bravo.
Sir, we're unable to contact the Sampson.
Reagan control, this is
Rough Rider 4-0-4.
I'm encountering some severe...
Rough Rider 4-0-4, come in.
Do you copy?
Put the force at weapons posture one.
Warning red, weapons tight.
I want everything loaded.
Bridge, what's happened?
My radar's totally down, sir.
We've lost contact with base.
All comms are offline.
It's the North Koreans,
I'm telling you.
Hey, Lieutenant, you good?
Come on, you with me?
Come on. Damn it!
Come on! Squared away?
I'm squared away.
Whatever that thing is, it killed the battery.
Come on, Beast.
What is that?
That's not good.
What the hell is that?
Do you think that this could be some super-secret Navy surprise exercise?
Because if so, they have gone way too far.
Let's give them a warning, Helmsman.
Aye, aye, sir.
What the hell is this?
I didn't sign up for this bullshit!
Yeah, no shit, dude.
Klyvich is offline. Should be back in two minutes.
Copy that.
Signal the John Paul Jones.
Fire a warning shot. One round, ten mil, left offset.
Place Mount 51 in remote, batteries released.
Mount 51 has been designated.
Who are we shooting at?
I do not know.
- Let's move it, Beast.
- She's dead in the water.
Ord, get your ass to the lee helm.
Aye, sir.
Fire!
Incoming, headed for the John Paul Jones.
Unknown, inbound at the horizon.
Vampire, vampire, vampire.
Killing with CIWS.
What kind of chuckwagon...
Were there men out on that bridge wing?
Yes, sir, there were.
I got it! Firing it up!
Get in there!
Sir!
Light it up!
What the hell is Hopper doing?
All engines, ahead flank.
All engines ahead.
Aye, sir!
Sir, CIC reports both Spy and Fire control radar cannot lock on.
Fire!
CIC, fire!
Incoming on the right!
Incoming, incoming!
We're hit!
Sir, we have a hull breach.
Help me!
Helmsman, get back on the helm!
Aye, sir.
Rapid, continued fire!
No!
Get me to the John Paul Jones.
NOW!
Bridge reports no survivors in the water. Sampson, all hands lost.
Targets are holding defensive formation.
Where's the captain?
Where is he?
What happened? OFFICER:
Captain and XO are dead.
What?
They're dead!
CO and XO are dead.
Who's in charge?
Who's next full senior?
You are.
It's your ship, sir.
You're senior officer, sir.
Sir, if you would please just give me an order.
I don't know what to do, sir.
We're going in.
Full attack.
That's an order.
Attack, sir? Really?
You wanted an order, that's the order. Let's go.
Let's go!
- You heard him.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Ready all guns.
Fire control is offline.
I need three minutes.
Tell Nagata I'm going in, with or without him.
Sir, do you really want to attack this thing?
Yes! Yes, I do.
Sir, that's a hit!
The Myoko was hit, sir.
Are the weapons ready?
Sir, they have killed everything that's fired on them.
Get the guns online, and we ram this thing.
They killed my brother and every man on his ship!
We have no weapons to attack with, sir.
Then set course to 3-1-0.
That's a collision course!
Are you clear on that?
Sir, there are sailors in the water.
Get the guns online and we're going to ram this thing!
Sir, the Myoko is sinking!
Sir, please!
Set the course to 3-1-0.
There are sailors in the water, sir!
Hard starboard.
Hard starboard. Aye, sir!
Get them out of the water.
Yes, sir.
What's happening?
Shut up, man.
What the hell is happening?
What the hell are they doing?
Why aren't they attacking?
Are those things aliens?
Would you please shut up?
We need help! We need to get the carrier over here!
Who's running the ship?
Hopper.
Are you kidding me?
Hopper's running the ship?
This is bullshit.
We're all going to die!
What the hell are those things?
What is that shit?
Comms are down up here.
You got anything?
That's a negative on all frequencies.
Oh, shit.
Abandon 9-30!
Kill the engines!
Strike!
Hey, Jack!
Dad?
Sir, I can't explain this.
We've lost communication with everyone on the other side of the barrier.
We can't get in and they can't get out.
The field, whatever it is, extends about 300,000 feet in altitude and has a depth of about two nautical miles.
We are in contact with
Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet.
Right now, our navy is effectively trapped outside the area.
So we have nobody in there?
Sir, we have three guided missile destroyers still unaccounted for.
So, it's conceivable we do have somebody inside.
Who?
Okay. Thank you!
Captain! Captain!
Let's go! Let's go!
My grandmother could climb this mountain.
It's a start, Mick.
What was that?
I'm not sure.
What the hell are you guys doing up here?
I need you off this mountain, right now.
Wait, what's going on? Why?
The island's under attack.
Attack by who?
I don't know. People are using the word "aliens."
Aliens?
We don't know. Whatever it is, it took out the marine base and all roads leading to this mountain have been destroyed.
Cell phones, radios, Internet, everything is shut down.
The Navy's engaged, just off of the coast.
The Navy?
I need you and your friend off of this mountain right now.
Come on, let's go.
Vic, leave your car here.
We'll go block the road.
Where are you going?
Mick! Where are you going?
I ain't never seen an alien.
Have you ever seen an alien?
Mick! Don't leave me alone.
Bra, you saw that?
What the hell was that?
Hey, Vince, did you see that?
It looked like a jet.
Bra, I've never...
Oh, my God! What the hell?
Sir, we need you.
We need you now.
I can't.
If you can't...
Who can?
Captain.
Where did we find it?
One of their transporters must have crashed on the way to the island.
There was debris everywhere.
Thomas and Potts fished him right out of the water with a grappling hook.
I told them it was a bad idea, but they kept yanking.
I kept telling them "no," and they kept...
Hmm...
Oh...
God damn it!
Beast, flashlight.
My dad said they would come.
He said it my whole life.
He said, "We ain't alone."
He said, "One day we would find them,"
"or they would find us."
You know what else he said?
He said...
"I hope I ain't around when that day comes."
He's not dead!
He's not dead!
Not dead! Not dead!
I've got a bad feeling about this.
What kind of bad feeling?
Like, "We're going to need a new planet" kind of bad feeling.
Medical casualty, C-53. Two men down.
They're still on the ship.
Lock down the ship!
- Is everyone all right?
- All good, Chief.
Is everyone accounted for?
Just heard something on Level Four.
Raikes, up.
Hey! Move, move!
What do you see?
Did you see it?
No, sir.
I got nothing, sir!
Nothing.
How is he?
Not good, sir. Not good.
You two, get him to medical, now!
Raikes, you're with me.
Let's go!
Get out of here!
No!
Yo! Hey!
Raikes...
Get your ass to CIC.
NOW!
Come on.
Raikes, you better be there.
Come on, come on, come on.
Mahalo, mother...
We got to get off this mountain.
The cop left the keys on his belt.
You've got to go down and get them.
You can do it.
Now.
This is an emergency call.
Can anyone hear me?
Radio check.
Can anyone hear me? Over.
Hey, wait up!
Don't leave! Don't leave!
Stop right there!
Don't shoot!
Who are you?
I'm Cal Zapata.
We sent out a beacon.
Oh, shit, is he a cyborg?
Are you guys with them?
If he's human, could you have him put the gun down?
Mick, put your gun down.
I told them that something like this could happen.
I said, it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians, or the Conquistadors and the Incans.
They just thought,
"No, they will be sweet."
They killed my grad student.
Okay, calm down.
I can't.
Slow. Sit down.
I can't breathe.
Slow breaths, slow breaths.
You're freaking him out, Mick.
I doubt it takes much to freak him out.
We need the Marines. We need the Army.
We need all of them.
It is the strong belief of the Chinese
that what crashed into Hong Kong
was some sort of communications ship.
You're saying that a flying telephone cratered and took out 25,000 people?
What I'm saying is that our visitors seem extraordinarily concerned
with establishing a line of communication home.
If they have lost their communication ship, how could they do that?
The same way we did.
Our communications station in Hawaii has the ability
to send a message to deep space via the Landsat 7 satellite.
I believe it's for that asset they have domed the islands.
We're looking at an extinction-level event.
The most critical part of any military operation.
Establish communications, reinforcements, follow-on forces.
You're saying E.T. wants to phone home?
That would be incredibly, incredibly bad.
So far, only five ships have made contact.
If five ships can do this, what do you think 50 can do, or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?
Sir, if I could just have a minute.
If you'll just give me one second...
Why am I staring at a lizard?
Because this is my pet lizard, sir.
Penelope the Third.
And? And they have the exact same eyes.
You have 15 seconds. Go.
Okay, sir, I put the helmet on, and the helmet is, basically, extreme sunglasses.
And it's some hydration and some oxygen saturation, and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.
But we took Penelope to the beach one time, which was a terrible idea.
She went absolutely crazy because she can't handle the sunlight.
You see? I don't think that they can handle the sunlight either.
You try anything else on?
Negative, sir.
Just the helmet.
Just the helmet.
Scientists have confirmed there was a UFO landing
in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Hawaii.
Today I want to update the American people
on what we know about the situation in Hawaii.
First, we are bringing all available resources to bear.
The news has sparked global unrest as populations panic,
unleashing an unprecedented wave of chaos across the world.
Many governments have declared martial law.
Just scramble the jets, Admiral.
We need to get in there!
I'm far from more aware than you of the need to get inside there.
But wasting lives will not help.
You want me to send up another plane?
I'll do it the second you come up here and put your ass in the co-pilot's seat, sir!
Are they transmitting?
They could be, but it wouldn't do them any good.
There's no satellite to receive the transmission.
We beam to Landsat 7.
What's Landsat 7?
It's our deep-space satellite.
It only orbits into range once every 24 hours.
When is the satellite in position?
8:43 a.m.
We've got about five hours.
And then they will use it to slingshot their transmission.
Slingshot where?
I don't know.
Wherever it is they're from.
Pearl Harbor here, we're approximately here, and they, whatever they are, are somewhere in the middle.
We're trapped out here.
What we know right now is we can't target them unless we have a plain line of sight.
Without radar, we have no way to track them, correct?
Correct. But I don't think they can see us, either.
Why?
Because we are still alive.
Okay, so they can't see us and we can't see them.
And we have no way to hit them from a safe distance.
There is a way.
A way?
A way of seeing them, without seeing them.
You're going to reference Art of War right now, aren't you?
What are we supposed to do, fight the enemy where they aren't?
Move like water?
Because I've read that thing six times.
It makes no sense.
That book is Chinese.
It still makes no sense.
My way is much more simple.
We've been doing it to
America for 20 years.
Water displacement.
How do you track water displacement?
Tsunami buoys.
Tsunami buoys?
You have them surrounding your islands, transmitting displacement data.
We hack into their transmissions, form a grid.
You can't track anything without radar.
I don't need radar.
Just the radio frequencies.
Turn off Aegis radar, please.
Who is this guy?
- Chief Moore.
- Sir.
Secure SPY.
Securing SPY, sir.
Display NOAA data.
NOAA data?
That's correct.
You heard him.
Display NOAA data.
What the hell is that?
It's a buoy.
If it gets hit by a wave, it transmits a signal.
Bring up chart plot.
Chart plot. Bring it up.
So we can track without radar.
We would practice it as a contingency plan.
You dirty, cheating, sneaky...
Rough world.
I like it.
Captain.
My chair is your chair, sir.
My brother would have done the same.
I wish we could get a hold of Hopper.
Who's Hopper?
He's a tactical actions officer on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer.
It has the resources that could take this entire mountain out.
Great, that makes a lot of sense.
Let's call him.
We can't.
Everything is jammed.
They're using an electromagnetic field to block our signals.
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
There are gaps, okay?
From inside the barrier we might just be able to get a call out.
If I could get to my spectrum analyzer, then, theoretically, we could find a frequency we could broadcast on...
Do you have a piece of equipment that can make a call?
Yeah.
Get it.
I can't because it's down there, in that nest of aliens.
You're going to go get it.
No.
- Yes.
- Yes.
We are looking for patterns of water displacement.
That buoy is underwater.
That's a ship.
Get on your gun.
Yes, sir.
Target, Echo-1-1.
Roger. Echo 1-1.
Ready to fire.
When we fire, they will know where we are.
Fire!
Ordy, anything?
Negative, sir.
It's a miss.
It's heading towards us.
You ready?
I'm sorry, but there is no possible way that I'm going down there.
I do not possess that kind of courage.
Right now, you're going to acquire that courage, or I'm going to break my steel leg off into your ass.
You feel me?
I feel you.
Go, now.
Acquiring courage.
Acquiring courage.
What?
Foxtrot, 2-4.
Foxtrot, 2-4.
Ready to fire.
Fire!
Ordy, anything?
Negative, sir.
It's a stupid, nincompoop idea.
There's another one.
Incoming, incoming! Sir, they're coming from both directions!
Engines, back, full.
Incoming, incoming, incoming!
India 3-7.
India 3-7. Loaded.
Second coordinate,
Romeo, 2-6.
Romeo 2-6.
Sir, we're hot over here.
Missiles good to go.
Let's light them up,
Captain Nagata.
Captain Nagata.
Fire!
Holy shit!
A hit, sir! Hit!
Any station this net, any station this net, this is a call for help.
Any warship, police or military personnel, please respond, over.
This is U. S.S.
John Paul Jones,
state your identity and position. Over.
Hopper?
Sam?
Sam, are you okay?
Where are you?
Thank God. I'm okay.
Listen, they're here at the satellite array at Saddle Ridge, do you copy?
They're going to transmit a signal and establish communication.
You need to destroy the facility.
We have four hours.
Four hours, I copy.
Hopper.
Can you hear me?
Babe, you need to get out of there.
Hopper? Hopper?
No, they're gone.
They're gone.
We better get gone, too.
I'm thinking an Arleigh
Burke class destroyer is about to rain hell down on this mountaintop.
Are you ready to kill another one?
Tango 1-9.
Tango 1-9. Loaded.
Whiskey 2-5.
Whiskey 2-5.
Raikes, can you get a track on their ship?
Negative, sir, it's moving all over the place.
I can't get a line on it.
This sucker's really jumping around.
Very intelligent.
What time is sunrise?
Forty minutes, sir.
Let's take these bastards somewhere they don't want to go.
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.
I need to know when we round this point if we can hold her tight.
Right around
Diamond Head, here.
There's a brutal current there.
It will take a miracle to keep her off the reef.
Ordy, is it possible?
Can you do it?
It's not impossible.
Sir, I can try, but I don't know what...
Can you do it, yes or no?
Contact is seven miles out, and closing fast.
Yes, sir, I can do it.
Check safe, check clear.
Check safe, check clear.
Get some.
Captain Nagata, how good is your aim?
Excellent.
- All right, let's start this turn!
- Aye, sir!
Left, hard rudder!
Left, hard rudder, sir!
How are we looking?
It's all reef.
Ordy, you are way too close! Come left!
Easy...
We're about to kiss these rocks, Ordy!
Ordy!
Where did you learn to shoot?
I'm not sure how you say it in English.
Natsu campu.
Summer campu.
- How about now?
- Still a little tight.
I can see fish, Ordy.
Come on, man.
Contact, two miles out.
Contact ETA, 21 seconds.
Summer camp...
Contact, 700 yards out.
Summer camp.
Champion, when I was 12.
Are you kidding me?
Here we go.
On my mark.
Three.
Two.
One.
Light them up.
Boom.
Three miles until Saddle Ridge is within range.
Status of weps.
Sir, they're bringing up all the rounds from the lower mag right now.
Sir.
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge!
Shit!
Ordy, get up! Let's go!
Go, go, go!
We've got two down, sir!
Get up.
Go, go, go!
Get in the water! Go!
It's going down!
Come on.
Raikes!
Right here!
You're almost there, come on!
Let's go, we have to jump!
That's the John Paul Jones.
That's Hopper.
Relax, Sam. I'm seeing a lot of lifeboats in the water.
You say that satellite will be in position in three hours?
Yeah, that's correct.
So if they miss it, they have to wait.
My uplink never misses.
It's not going to miss.
How are your driving skills?
What does that mean? How are my driving skills?
They're horrible.
Not your driving.
Sam, how are your driving skills?
Good.
Let's see if we can't buy the world another day.
Who talks like that?
Just get in the vehicle.
Let's go.
I'm not getting in.
This is your show, now.
I don't have a death wish, thank you very much.
Goodbye, everyone.
Stop! Stop.
This is my property.
It doesn't end like this.
What do you want us to do, Hopper?
We have no ships left.
We have one.
We have got a battleship.
Are you crazy?
That's a museum.
Not today.
This ship is 70 years old.
It's totally outdated.
The firing systems are all analog.
The engines haven't been started in a decade.
Which would be fine, but they are steam, which I have no idea how to fire up.
And even if I had a user's manual and six weeks to go through it all, we still don't have enough crew to fire it up.
I don't know what you're thinking, sir.
Is everyone all right?
Yes, sir. We're okay.
You men have given so much to your country, and no one has the right to ask any more of you, but I'm asking.
What do you need, son?
I need to borrow your boat.
Son.
Sir.
What the hell? Are you going to stand there, staring at me?
Get your goddamn eye on that spotter!
Eye on spotter, sir.
Been working on a destroyer, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
Are you ready to play with the big boys?
Oh, yes, sir.
Come on.
We need the help.
Awesome!
Best cover your ears.
Purrs like a kitten.
Bridge, main control.
I got eight boilers hot.
Ready to rock and roll, sir.
How are we looking on fuel?
600 long tons, sir. Just enough for a maintenance run.
Ordnance?
We scraped together what we could, sir.
But it's not much.
All right, let's get her to sea.
We have got work to do.
Roger that.
Engines ahead, flank.
All engines ahead, flank.
All engines ahead, flank.
Aye, sir.
You good?
Good, sir.
Good, sir.
Good.
Status of turret one?
Center line, barrel, armed.
- Stop!
- Clear!
Loaded.
Status of turret two?
Starboard side, armed.
Status of turret three?
Port barrel.
Ready to rock and roll.
Port side, armed!
Sir, are we really firing on Oahu?
Sure looks that way.
Holy shit!
Saddle Ridge will be in weapons range in five minutes.
Oh, brother, somebody is going to kiss the donkey.
Hopper!
I didn't think that one moved.
Me neither.
My God.
Are you kidding me?
Art of War.
Fire control, weapons status?
Aimed at target.
Train all three turrets to 2-1-0.
But, sir, that's the wrong direction!
I'm well aware of that, Raikes.
What the hell is he doing?
He's losing his mind, all over again.
Hard left rudder.
Hard left rudder. Aye, sir.
Drop port anchor.
What?
Drop it now!
We are going to die.
We are going to die.
You are going to die.
I am going to die.
We are all going to die.
Just not today.
Let's drop some lead on those mother...
Fire!
Reload! Reload!
Firing mechanism reset!
Secure the hatch.
Port side ready!
Release the anchor.
Incoming! Incoming!
You all right?
They ain't going to sink this battleship, no way.
Hit it!
Everything you've got!
Whoo!
I want every available plane on this ship in the air, now!
I can't believe that worked!
Yeah, Art of War. Fight the enemy where they aren't.
After all these years, that finally just clicked.
But that's not what it means.
Really?
Not even close.
Keep going!
Oh, shit!
Mick, my leg is stuck.
Mick!
Status of weapons?
Turret three is down.
We got one round of high-explosive back-aft in turret three.
Tell them to have it ready when we get there.
I got this.
Beast, update.
I need that round. We need to bring it to turret two.
Sir?
Turret two is 500 feet away.
This round is over a thousand pounds!
How do you expect us to get it there?
Raikes! Get to the gun plot, finger on the trigger.
Yes, sir.
Come on, easy. Easy.
Gentle, boys.
Gentle, gentle.
Get out of here!
We got to go.
Calm down, okay? I'm going to frigging save you.
Closed, number one is armed.
Coordinates?
Train, 3-3-0.
Elevation?
There! Go!
Let's go!
She's armed.
You better not be up there.
Let's go! Come on!
Hopper!
We only have one round left, right?
Yeah.
It was an honor serving with you, Captain.
The honor was mine.
Fire.
Fire.
Locked on target.
We take great pride in honoring
the many men and women who demonstrated exceptional gallantry
in the face of overwhelming enemy force.
Valor and courage were exhibited by so many
that I cannot honor them all.
It is my great privilege to recognize
those few whose actions deserve special note.
Lieutenant Colonel, United States
Army, retired, Mick Canales.
The President of the United
States takes great pleasure
in presenting the Navy Cross to Commander Stone Hopper
for extraordinary heroism.
Receiving this award, on behalf of his brother,
Lieutenant
Commander Alex Hopper.
Stand fast, Mr. Hopper.
It is my great pleasure to present you with a Silver Star
for your exceptional heroism and gallantry in combat operations.
And I look forward to seeing you at sea on a ship of your own command, soon.
Thank you.
Ordy, stop talking for a second.
Come on, take the picture, Beast.
Say "Navy."
Navy!
Mildly impressive, Hopper.
You ready to get your ass off that big gray monster, get out to Coronado and get your hands dirty with the big boys?
Yes, sir. You think you've got what it takes?
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.
It just might be too much sleep, though, sir.
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.
We will have to see about that.
Come on, Hopper, cozy up to Nagata.
You look so cute.
You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?
You look dapper.
"Navy. " Say, "Navy."
Yeah, I don't know.
Oh!
Bad timing.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
How are you?
Good, how are you?
I love you.
I love you.
I'm a pretty lucky guy, you know that?
Which is why I think it's a perfect time for you to talk to my dad.
Where is he? I wish he was standing right here.
That's perfect, because look!
Your wish came true, honey. Go get him.
Thumbs up, that helps.
Sir.
What is it?
I want you to know that I am in love with Sam.
And I am asking your permission to marry your daughter.
No.
Thank you, sir.
I mean, it's...
What?
No.
Sir...
I saved the world.
Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.
But...
No means no, Hopper.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.
I think I will have a chicken burrito.
Chicken...
Sir.
Come along, Hopper.
We will discuss the terms of your surrender over a meal.
Yes, sir.
She told you about that?
You got nothing on Jay-Z.
I mean, even I couldn't get Beyoncé.
I couldn't get Beyoncé either.
No way.
Whoa.
What the...
What is that?
Don't get too close to it.
Whoa, guys! Look at this!
- Don't go too close!
- Don't run to it.
- Do you think that looks like a door?
- A door?
Hello?
Anyone home?
That's not going to help, is it?
This really helps.
Do you know what that is?
We think there's something inside of it.
Are going to open it, Jimmy?
If Jimmy says he's getting in, he's getting in!
Come on, Jimmy!
Whoo!
Jimmy!
That's it. Come to daddy.
Jimmy! Oh, my God!
Yes!
MALE OVER RADIO: Scorch, Scorch, are you there?
Come on, Scorch, get back to me.
You haven't run off and done something reckless, have you?
Gary, we've got a problem!
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
As usual, he's in trouble.
How did he get into this mess?
For that, I have to go back a long, long time.
Forty-seven minutes ago.
Baby rescue mission. Planet Gnarlach.
GARY OVER RADIO: Quiet, Scorch.
Whatever you do, don't wake the Gnarlachs.
Hey, that's me, Gary Supernova.
I work in Mission Control, which means I control the mission.
Scorch doesn't see it that way.
Oh, relax, Gary, they're fast asleep.
GARY: And that is a Gnarlach.
- Scary, slimy...
- ...and surprisingly stinky.
GARY OVER RADIO: Uploading that to Blue Tube.
Gary, this place smells worse than the latrines at the BASA Academy.
Mmm. Thank you for that.
(MALE VOICE) Um, I was programmed at the BASA Academy.
The only thing I smelled there was progress.
Zip it, James.
The name's Bing, by the way. James Bing.
GARY OVER RADIO: All right, Scorch, let's find those babies
and get you out of there.
(WHISPERING) Bingo.
Spacecraft identified.
Good. Now proceed with extreme caution.
Negative.
Proceeding with style. (GRUNTS)
Not style again! Scorch! Shh!
Hah! Triple Star System into a Reverse Galaxy, followed by a Double Black Hole with a twist!
And he sticks the landing!
GARY OVER RADIO: Now proceed with caution.
OK, Scorch, the babies should be straight ahead.
SCORCH: Copy that.
No!
Bad news, little brother.
We're too late.
They've eaten the babies!
It's so unfair!
Scorch, they're right behind you.
- What?
(CHUCKLING) Oh.
Hi, little guys.
- Uncle Scorch is here to rescue you.
- Coochie, coochie, coo.
Yeah, Gary, maybe tell Scorch to keep his voice down in this situation?
- Just a thought.
- Scorch, quiet!
Gary, you should see them.
They're so cute. It's magical.
GARY: You're gonna wake up the whole neighborhood.
And this is not a good neighborhood.
- Peekaboo!
GARY: - Scorch?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, good, here we go again.
- Scorch!
Gary, we've got a problem!
Of course we have a problem.
You never listen to me.
You said there were 12 Gnarlachs, Gary.
No, I said 1200.
Uh, nope, I don't think you did.
- There are 1200 Gnarlachs down there.
- Got it.
- Twelve-hundred baby-eating Gnarlachs.
- Got it.
Twelve-hundred of our archenemies, the Gnarlachs.
- Twelve-hundred of 'em.
- Got it.
Nope. I think I'd remember if you said 1200.
(GRUNTS) - Now do your thing.
- OK.
Chasm of death in 20 yards and closing.
Deploy grappling hook in three...
...two...
...one.
Whoo! Oh, yeah!
- You see that?
Boom! That's what I'm talking about!
- Scorch me, baby!
Helpless babies, your chariot awaits.
In your face, Gnarlachs!
I got the babies! Ha-ha!
- Oh, no, no.
Guys, no, no.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
- No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
- Huh?
- Shh! Gary?
GARY: - I'm on it.
Ha! Take that!
(BOY) Supernova-9, you are clear for landing on planet Dad!
Hey! This is a no-fly zone, mister.
Very funny, Dad.
I'm serious.
This console's expensive, Kipper.
Console? I mean...
I mean, I'm right here. Unbelievable.
Can I have my spaceship back?
- Mmm... No.
- Dad, you never let me do anything.
OK, but be careful.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Ahh!
- It burns! It burns!
- Ohh!
- Sorry. Dad. Hey!
OK, let's play the game where you sit on your hands.
- That game stinks.
SCORCH: - Hey, Gary!
Be a pal, park this puppy, will ya?
Activating remote assistance.
Time to watch your old man bring in the Supernova-9 for a landing.
- Scorch is back!
I love you, planet Baab!
Whoo!
Boom!
Cool!
And that is how you do that.
- Gary!
- What? OK, that's terrifying.
Why do you always call me in jumbo-head mode?
We've received an SOS from an uncharted sector of the galaxy.
Prepare for Scorch's next mission.
Copy that, boss.
Where are we headed?
He's going to the Dark Planet.
Lena, are you crazy?
Let me... rephrase that.
They call it the Dark Planet because nobody ever comes back.
It's like going into a black hole.
He leaves in an hour.
Whoa! He's going to the Dark Planet?
Wicked!
Stay here. Don't touch anything.
And nobody's going to the Dark Planet.
We are going to the Dark Planet!
- Scorch!
- Scorch, one question!
No questions, just pictures.
Yeah, baby!
Excuse me, Scorch!
Scorch Supernova!
Yes, the beautiful young lady in the front row.
- Oh!
- Hi, sweetie. Welcome home.
- Gabby, we're live.
(GIGGLING) - Oh, right.
Hi. Tell us about the mission.
- The Dark Planet.
It's heroic, even for me.
- No one has ever come back alive.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.
- Have you had time to prepare?
- Uh, no, no, we haven't.
- Gary Supernova, my baby brother.
- Uh, fact check: I'm older than him.
Gary works all the gizmos and bleep-bloops here in the nerd factory.
- I work in Mission Control.
We use a trans-inducified field matrix to...
Mmm-hmm. And that's today's edition of The Boring Report.
- Back to you, Gabby.
For BNN, this is Gabby Babblebrock, reporting live from BASA headquarters.
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- And I feel sorry for her.
Now, listen, we know almost nothing about the Dark Planet.
No one does.
We need to postpone the mission.
I would, but I've already contacted all my sponsors.
Dark Planet Cola!
Destroy your taste buds!
This is 800 percent sugar.
That's what makes it good for kids.
Oh. Hey!
Plus, I've already taken the photos for the new cereal box.
When?
♪ Scorchios ♪
- Just now.
- Scorchios?
- There's a surprise in every box.
- Ah!
- Whoa, I'm pretty good at this.
- OK...
- Come... Come on!
- I could do this all day.
- Whee!
- Knock it off!
- We need to think this through.
- I have.
Someone out there needs my help, and I am going to help them.
OK, but if you go now,
I can't help you help them.
You know, Gary, you're absolutely right.
There's no sense in rushing things.
Why don't you pull up the star charts in the briefing room, and we'll talk about this with the whole team.
You got it, partner.
That should keep him busy.
Let's fire up the ship!
Computer, load all information on the Dark Planet.
JAMES: All right, just a sec.
Scanning files, scanning files...
Here we are. The Dark Planet:
A remote M-class planet located 400 light-years
past the Taurus Molecular Cloud.
A strange and terrifying environment,
the only known world in which evolution is taking place in reverse.
It began with intelligent, attractive beings,
but was soon overrun by ugly, aggressive
and quite terrifying dim-witted creatures.
Yuck. Gross.
JAMES: As you can see, from gentle intelligence to savage stupidity.
They have a strange custom of dividing themselves
into what they call countries, whose boundaries they often dispute,
which causes them to go to war.
The pattern seems to be that the winner of the war then goes into decline
while the loser prospers.
We have also deduced that the people of this planet choose
leaders according to the oddity and profusion of their facial hair.
They worship money, soup, marker pens, something called dental floss
- and this man, whose name is Cowell.
- Oh, terrifying!
JAMES: He's known for his strange accent, being very, very rich,
showing off, wearing glasses indoors.
I like him.
One hundred and six advanced life-forms have landed on the Dark Planet...
- What?
- ...to attempt friendly fairst contact.
Not a single one has returned.
KIP: Uncle Scorch!
Hey, Kipper!
You were awesome out there.
Thanks, pal.
Does your dad know you're here?
I'm supposed to be waiting in his office, but Mission Control is boring.
I know. Isn't it? It's all...
(MIMICS BEEPING BUTTONS)
(LAUGHING) I'm more of an astronaut, like you.
Take me with you this time.
Wow. That sure would upset your dad, which is something I love to do.
But I'll tell you what, Kipper...
If I get into trouble, you come rescue me.
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kip,
Junior Adventurer, at your service!
Junior Adventurer, are you? Hmm.
- Well, what have we here?
- Blast tape!
Ready for a training mission?
OK, we've crash-landed.
We're surrounded by a tribe of slimy, green aliens, and they are closing in on us.
What do you do? You do this! Watch!
- Take that!
- Cool!
- Time to take out the trash!
- Awesome!
Scorch me, baby! (WHOOPS)
Oh, they got me! (GROANS)
- Kipper, it's up to you.
- Wicked!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Astronaut training.
Blast tape?
Kip shouldn't be playing with it.
He shouldn't even be looking at it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
GARY: - Sorry, Barry.
(ALL) Ooh!
- Back to my office.
- See ya, Uncle Scorch.
Scorch...
Mission Control, we've got a mad-dad situation here.
You're darn right I'm mad.
(STAMMERS) Why is this ship on?
Oh! (LAUGHS)
You sent me upstairs so you could rush off to the Dark Planet.
- Yep.
- Ah!
I thought we'd agreed to postpone the launch.
JAMES: Launch in T-minus 30 minutes.
It's too risky to send
Scorch out there. Please.
Drop it, Gary. I'm warning you.
I'm the mission controller.
Does nobody here care what I think?
- No.
- Not really.
- Nope.
- Then why am I even here?
It'll be fine, Gary.
He's done this a hundred times.
We've done this a hundred times.
We're a team.
I'm the brains and you're the brawn.
That's what you always said.
I said it to make you feel better, little brother.
Scorch, stop calling me that.
You've been trying to control me your whole life.
Isn't that why you joined Mission Control?
I'm looking out for you.
That's what brothers do.
Oh, please.
You sit around here pushing buttons while I am out there risking my neck.
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you do it without me.
Any time. Any place.
Little brother.
If you insist on going through with this idiotic macho stunt, you can count me out.
Buh... wai...
You're gonna quit?
Well, you can't quit!
You... you're fired!
You can't fire me.
Because I quit! Humph!
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, space ranger.
KIP: Come on, boy.
Let's go play flisbee.
- You're home early.
- Scorch fired me.
What? He can't fire you.
That's what I said, so I quit.
So you quit after you were fired?
Hey, whose side are you on?
I think someone should lock the two of you in a room until you figure out how to get along.
I hope he gets stranded.
What are you doing, Dad?
Uh... Oh, nothing.
Just working on the old rocket boots.
Cool! Can I help?
Following in your dad's footsteps, eh, Kipper?
Hey! That makes this an official father-son moment!
What's this do?
Whoa! Look out!
Aah! Ah, incoming!
GARY'S WIFE: Gary! Why is there a rocket boot in our bathroom?
ANNOUNCER: This is BNN.
GABBY: We are live as
Scorch Supernova investigates
a mysterious intergalactic cry for help.
Brought to you by Dark Planet Cola.
Dark Planet Cola!
Scorch is stepping off the Supernova-9 now.
Oh boy, is he looking good in that suit.
Mmm.
Oh! Let's go live to the Dark Planet's surface.
This is Scorch Supernova, live from the Dark Planet.
I'm here responding to an intergalactic SOS call,
and on the lookout for helpless victims.
Yeah!
Switching over to remote cams, Gabby.
Wish me luck.
GABBY: Our planet's greatest hero, risking life and limb...
He's so awesome. I'm gonna be just like Uncle Scorch someday.
Well, better have another kid.
- Gary.
- Just what every father wants to hear.
My son wants to be like my dim-witted brother.
Oh, relax. He's excited.
Besides, what could Scorch possibly give your son that you can't?
I dedicate this planet to my nephew, Kip!
I got my own planet? Awesome!
- OK, that's pretty hard to top.
There appears to be a light source coming from a light of some kind.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't do it!
Do not go into the light.
- Going to the light.
KIP: - Wow.
It's so beautiful.
- Oh...
Huh?
A victim! Commencing rescue op.
Greetings! We've heard your call for help and have come to save you.
I am Scorch Supernova.
Strange. On my planet we shake hands, but we can do it your way.
(CHUCKLES) That's humiliating.
Boy, you sure love to wave.
I love it, too, but my arms are getting tired.
- What was that?
What...?
Hmm...
- No!
No! Hang on!
Look at me. Look at me!
Don't you die on me, buddy!
No!
Moving in.
- Scorch!
- We got a blue one!
All he wanted to do was wave!
Peter, Jackson is down!
Man, what is it with aliens and this desolate roadside 7-Eleven?
MAN OVER BULLHORN: Halt! Alien! Do not use your advanced technology against us!
- Marty, Quentin, move it out!
- Scorch me, baby.
- Get out of there!
- Time to take out the trash!
Who's next?
Yeah! Look at him go!
Not now!
Scorch is in real trouble.
Aim for the space-suity thingy!
- Look out!
Uh... uh-oh.
Time to get outta here.
That's not good.
Gary, we better find another way outta here.
Gary?
Scorch.
(MUMBLING) OK, I take...
You know something?
I love you guys.
Welcome to Earth.
Tag him and bag him, boys.
The Baabian Aeronautics and Space Administration have confirmed
that all communications with Scorch Supernova have been severed.
At this point, we can only assume that our planet's greatest hero is...
...is dead?
(SOBBING) I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Oh, no.
- You said you hoped he got stranded.
You wanted this to happen!
I'm sure your father didn't say that.
Did you?
We've gotta get to the Dark Planet and find him!
GARY: Just hang on, Kip.
Come on. Come on, pick up.
Oh, hello, Gary.
I thought you quit.
This is important.
Scorch has been captured.
- We've got it under control.
- Come on!
Dad, Uncle Scorch told me to come rescue him.
- We can be the rescue team.
- Kip!
We're his family.
We need to go save him.
I'm doing everything I can.
You're not doing anything!
- You're talking on the phone!
Go to your room.
Kipper?
Kipper, I know you want to rescue him, and it's very brave of you.
Even though your uncle and I fight sometimes, we're still brothers.
And I will do whatever it takes to get him home, I promise you.
I love you, buddy.
Come on, give us a hug.
- Huh?
Kip? Kip!
Kira! Kip's gone! Kip's gone!
- What?
- The rescue pod.
(GASPS) We've gotta get to BASA before he does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
We're using the rocket boots.
Are you crazy? The gyroscope is off, the thrust mechanism is broken.
They're not ready to fly.
I spent 15 years as a BASA test pilot.
It's not rocket science.
That's exactly what it is.
They're rocket boots!
Gary, turn off your brain and hang on.
This is staggeringly dangerous!
You're not even in a rocket boot lane!
Look out!
(GRUNTING) - Oh! Ah,
- Sorry!
- This is so emasculating.
- Do you want to drive?
- No, I want to live.
You're actually very good at this!
Look out! Look out! Look out!
- Sorry, Barry!
We're coming, Kipper.
- Where is he?
- Kip! No, Kipper, no!
- Kip, stop!
- Kip, up here!
- Kipper, please!
JAMES: Automated launch in T-minus 60 seconds.
Kip, up here!
Gary, look out.
(GASPS) This is a bad idea.
Mom! Dad! Are you coming?
No, honey, this isn't a game.
(GRUNTS) It's stuck!
KIRA: - Gary, do something!
I'll shut down the launch.
JAMES: Twelve, eleven...
You've chosen Terminate Launch.
- To confirm, say yes.
- Yes.
- You said "banana." Is that correct?
- No.
- You replied "no."
- Gary, hurry up!
Terminate Launch canceled.
GARY: - No! I mean yes!
- Ow!
- Is that a yes or a no?
- No.
- Did you say yes?
- Yes!
- Yes, you said yes, or...?
- Yes! Yes!
It's stuck!
Sorry, Gary. Did you say yes to Terminate Launch?
- Yes!
- Launch terminated.
JAMES: - That was close.
- Oh, Kip, you scared me.
I'm sorry. I promised
Uncle Scorch I'd go save him.
Don't you ever do that again.
No. Kip's right.
Scorch is my brother.
KIRA: - Honey?
- I've gotta go save him.
KIRA: Wait. What are you doing?
JAMES: Excellent.
Launch sequence reengaged.
KIRA: Gary?
- Dad!
- I love you guys!
- Dad!
KIRA: - Gary!
Lena, I need your help.
- Kira!
- Gary was on that pod!
(GASPS) Don't worry.
We'll make contact as soon as he lands.
No, no, no. You have to send someone after him.
I don't have to do anything.
You don't give the orders around here anymore.
Gary will never survive out there alone.
Please, bring my dad back.
Don't worry, little guy.
We're doing everything we can.
What can I do to help?
You're the one who wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.
So why don't you stay at home and let me do my job.
JAMES: Prepare for final approach,
Gary. Fasten your seatbelt.
Huh?
Oh!
(GROANS) I thought this movie was supposed to be in 3-D.
Shh. It is in 3-D.
OK, that's better.
JAMES: - Area 48.
Area 49.
Area 50.
JAMES: - Landing gear deployed.
JAMES: Landing gear destroyed.
JAMES: Please exit with caution, Gary.
Contents may have shifted during the flight.
It's all over the place, isn't it?
OK, OK, don't panic.
Remember your training.
The safest thing to do is wait in your pod.
JAMES: Self-destruct sequence initiated.
What? Self-destruct?
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
JAMES: - This one does, Gary.
- This is ridiculous!
JAMES: - Twenty-nine, 28, 27...
- Hey, anybody! Help!
JAMES: Is that your plan, Gary?
Panicking?
- Sixteen, 15...
- Come on!
JAMES: Ticktock, Gary.
Come on. You're running out of time.
- Water landing, monster attack... Aha!
JAMES: - Ten, nine...
- Foolishly trapped inside pod!
- ...eight, seven...
...six, five...
Time to panic.
...three, two...
- ...one. We're toast.
Ah... the technology in this suit is incredible.
- Now open it.
MAN: - Yes, sir.
Yuck!
Blubonium.
Ten thousand times more powerful than atomic energy.
Hey. How'd that get in there?
Oh, you're awake.
(GRUNTS) Let me go! Let me outta here!
Shh. Go back to sleep.
MAN: You're listening to Far-out,
Far-right Hour on C-Dub FM.
Let's go to the phones! Caller?
This is Hawk calling.
I work at 7-Eleven near Area 51, and after years of waiting, it finally happened!
MAN: You had a date with a girl.
What? No. A close-encounter, man!
We looked out the window and this blue dude was standing right there.
(CHUCKLES) - It was awesome.
MAN: - Hawk, Hawk, Hawk, listen to me.
If what you say is true,
they're here for one reason and one reason only: abduction!
- Huh?
It's OK, bro! We're friends.
- What are you doing?
- We gotta make a good impression.
We need a peace offering.
(CHUCKLES) Huh?
It's OK, little guy.
Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.
In an effort to avoid enslavement,
I offer you the finest chilled refreshment known to the human race.
MAN: He likes it!
Of course he likes it.
Where's your brand loyalty, man?
(BOTH) No!
(MUFFLED) You're gonna regret it!
Don't do it!
OK, OK, OK.
Calm down, blue buddy. It's OK.
It's called a brain freeze.
If you're gonna hang with us, you need to learn to sip.
Take him away!
- Put me down!
- Little blue buddy...
Ah!
GARY:
Stop this! Let me out!
Huh?
Hello, creature from another world.
Welcome to planet Earth.
You are now a guest of the US government.
When interacting with the inhabitants of Earth,
or humans, you should abide by the following basic etiquette.
Handshake, good.
- Death ray... bad. No vaporizing.
Modern Earth culture also frowns on the following:
eating human flesh, probing, silver jumpsuits,
abduction, Communism, nudity.
If you or someone you know is responsible for building the pyramids,
we'd like to know about it.
If you've been to the Bermuda Triangle and brought someone home with you,
please return them immediately.
And, finally, if you're a resident alien,
please report to the immigration desk on level 316.
We hope this has been an informative look at our planet,
and urge you not to seek war against us.
Enjoy your stay here at Area 51.
Let's take a peek into that head of yours.
COMPUTER: Brain scan processing.
- Stupid. Simple. Dimwit. Average.
Smart. Genius. Genius. Genius...
MAN: We got ourselves a real genius!
Shanker's gonna want to meet you.
- Here's the brainiac, sir.
So... you're the genius.
What are you gonna do to me?
Probe me? Dissect me?
- Chop me up and eat me?
- Relax.
I'm a big fan of your work.
Scorch!
What have you done with my brother?
We'll get to him soon enough.
This is your design, isn't it?
How do you know that?
Well, color me impressed.
And I consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to alien technology.
I could use a man with your brain power.
You see, Gary,
I run a work release program.
You work, then I release you.
You are going to make sure my latest project goes off without a hitch.
I'm not doing anything until I see Scorch.
You can whine till you're blue in the face, but I call the shots around here.
- Hmm?
Everyone out, now!
Double-time!
Wait! Wait! We're not finished!
Where's my brother?
Hello, Shanky-panky.
Hello, my darling.
You look ravishing.
Oh, you always say that.
That's because it's true.
- Did you get my present?
- Yes.
- I did.
- So do you like it?
It's... OK.
Pookie, what's wrong?
Nothing, it's fine.
I just... I was expecting more.
Well, that was just a sample.
There's more coming, I promise.
I'm bringing enough so we can rule the universe together.
Hurry, my love.
Gentle, gentle.
Just set me down nice and easy.
Hello? Anyone?
You can't do this! I know my rights!
Ugh.
Hey! Hi there, roomie!
Hey, are you finished with the toilet?
Huh? (GROANS)
I'm Thurman. Pleased to meet you.
Hello. Oh, my goodness.
You're all covered in slime.
- Ugh! You're all dried out.
- Not anymore.
I'm from Zaddlebrok 475.
- Never heard of it.
- You've heard of Zaddlebrok 473.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
- It's two planets over.
Makes sense.
Anyway, you should settle in.
Throw your stuff on the bottom bunk.
I gotta get outta here.
Don't I get a phone call?
Oh, yeah.
A phone call? A big-screen TV?
Egyptian cotton sheets?
- This is Area 51, man. Wake up!
Keep it down!
I'm trying to get some shut-eye.
Oh, I get it.
Shut-eye. You've got one eye.
Are you making fun of my one eye? (ROARS)
Easy, Io. Remember the program.
GROANS: Just stick to the program, stick to the program.
I apologize for my outburst.
My name is lo, and I'm working through some anger issues.
She seems nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, great gal. I'm Doc.
- You're a doctor?
- Radio talk show therapist.
Same thing without all the training, credentials or qualifications.
So, Little Boy Blue, you got a name?
Gary. I'm here looking for my brother.
Have you seen him?
What's he look like? Blue like you?
Yes, exactly like me except with huge muscles
and a chiseled jaw and perfect teeth.
OK, so you're the ugly brother.
Oh, well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Oh, it's not a question.
Look, Scorch can bust us out of here.
He's got a ship. He can get us home.
There's only one way out of here.
Invent enough cool stuff and Shanker lets you go.
That's how Area 51 works.
He lures the smartest aliens from across the universe
and throws us in jail.
Take Thurman. He was a professor.
Those four hands invented touchscreen technology.
Or Io. She used to be a librarian.
She got so mad looking stuff up for people
that she invented the search engine.
And most importantly, me.
After my radio show got famous,
I invented social networking.
I've got five billion pending friend requests.
That's how Shanker bankrolls this place.
He rips off our technology and sells it to the world.
He's got deals with everybody.
Apple, Facebook, them Google guys.
You think humans could build this stuff?
I don't think so.
Who do you think invented the Internet?
Cell phones? Computer animation?
We did!
Thank you. I love tech history.
But have you seen my brother?
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Please report immediately to the cafeteria.
And remember, levitating in the passageways is strictly prohibited.
- What the heck is that?
There is only one creature in the universe that snores that loud.
- Scorch! Scorch! Wake up!
Space hero test today. Didn't study.
- What the...?
Needs a whole salad to sleep.
Ow! Huh? Gary? Hey, Gary!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to rescue you.
You're rescuing me?
(LAUGHS) I'm still dreaming.
I come 15 light-years out of my comfort zone to save you, and this is the thanks I get from my own brother?
Try ex-boss. I fired you.
No, I quit.
And your first mission without me, you wind up in jail.
- And where did you end up? Jail.
You two should make an appointment.
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Lunch is now being served in the cafeteria.
Please be mindful of the joes as they are unusually sloppy.
The launch station computer will tell us where Daddy is.
Locate Rescue Pod 13.
JAMES: Self-destruct initiated at 2900 hours.
- What?
- Self-destruct?
Play back in-flight camera.
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
This is ridiculous!
Dad!
Only Mission Control can destroy a ship.
Somebody here had to give that order.
- Huh?
(WHISPERING) - Quick, get down.
Lena.
Keep still.
LENA: OK, that's good.
- Hurry up and get it loaded.
- You got it, boss.
KIRA: That much Blubonium could blow up the whole galaxy.
- Cool.
- No, no, no, not cool.
Very, very not cool.
We have to tell somebody.
LENA: - Tell somebody what?
KIRA: Lena!
Run!
- Go, Kipper!
- Hey!
Let me go! (GRUNTING)
Hey!
I gave you a chance to go home, sweetie.
You should've taken it.
Little rat got away.
LENA: It doesn't matter, he's just a kid.
- Tie her up and bring her with us.
- Wait! What about Gary?
(CHUCKLES) Gary? That coward?
He's never coming back.
Thank you.
Hit me with some jiggly cubes.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
Hi, guys. Not sure if you guys are guys. (CHUCKLES)
Or ladies. Either way, no problem.
Those are the Greys.
No one knows what Shank has got on them, but they do his bidding.
So don't get on their bad side, understand?
What's up, eggheads?
Give me two of everything and one more of anything.
(LAUGHS) Hey!
Some things you just can't teach.
Uh, mmm...
What are... what is all this?
We have lots of alien delicacies.
Blorm, Phrebbish, Zumft, diet Zumft, free-range Zumft, non-dairy gluten-free Zumft.
And if you're looking for something a bit more refined, we got fresh plarbe.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Oh, hello.
Hi.
You know what? I'm not hungry.
- Oh. Uh...
- Aliens.
- After you.
Gary! (BURPS)
I've seen a lot of jailbreak movies.
All we need to break out of here is a diversion, a shovel and a blowup dummy of ourselves.
(LAUGHS) It's not that simple, Scorch.
Don't be reckless.
(WHISPERS) And from now on, let's whisper our escape plan.
That's your problem, Gary.
Always wishy-washy, never taking action.
That's what makes me the heroic brother.
You're some hero.
Without me, you're nothing.
Ooh, big words from a computer-loving mama's boy.
No, they're regular-sized words.
You're just too dumb to understand.
Good thing Kip's gonna be a hero like me, not a coward like you.
Ugh! You take that back!
Oh! Nice, Gary. Nice. Real mature.
- Whoa!
- Oh! Right in the kisser!
- Food fight!
We have a food-related disturbance in the cafeteria!
- Get him!
- Stop! Get back here!
- Come here, you little runt!
- How the tables have turned.
- Hey!
Well, that was lucky.
Stop this right now before somebody gets hurt.
All right, that's it.
- Bull's-eye!
DOC: Oh, it's on!
THURMAN: - Ugh! Now you've done it.
- Bruce, look out!
- Willis, run!
People, people, where are your manners?
You're the one talking with your mouth full of yourself.
Do you have to do that now?
Hey, practice makes perfect.
George! Lucas! Let's go!
- It's the fuzz!
- Get 'em!
Christopher! Nolan! On your feet!
Hello, my dear.
- Oh!
- Stop right there!
How dare you slap a commanding officer!
- Ah!
All right, alien...
- Scorch, behind you!
- Nice!
- Thank you.
- Guess who!
Let's get outta here.
Oh, yeah!
Ten-hut!
I'm king of the world!
You missed.
Ooh. I told these guys, "You'd better not food fight," but they did.
I'm gonna sweep this up.
Report to the peace shield, on the double.
DOC: This is the peace shield.
THURMAN: It's an asteroid gun.
Nothing says peace like a giant gun, huh?
It's overkill if you ask me.
But it's America.
They supersize everything.
You guys built this thing?
DOC: Took us almost ten years.
Now we're just waiting for one last piece: the power source.
Then we can go back to our home planets.
- Or sun.
- Or sun.
Seriously? You live on the sun?
Yep. You can't beat the weather.
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, even though you didn't work on it, you've gotta sign the floor.
Anything for a fan.
That's a lot of names.
Where are all those guys?
Shanker's been building this thing for years. He probably let 'em go.
- Get your hands off me.
- You'll never get away with this.
The beauty of it is, I already have.
With Scorch and Gary gone, who's gonna stop me?
Hi-yah!
- What the...?
- Time to take out the trash!
- Kipper, no!
- Scorch me, baby!
Come back here!
- Let my mom go!
(LAUGHS) - "Scorch me, baby."
- You monster!
- Aw, I wish I had my camera.
What a perfect family portrait.
Look alive! General's coming in hot!
Shh. Don't do anything stupid.
Soldiers of Area 51, the final piece of the puzzle has arrived.
(GASPS) That's a Blubonium reactor.
How did he get his hands on it?
Somebody smuggled that thing in my suit.
What's the big deal?
Do you have any idea how powerful that stuff is?
Prepare for test firing.
- You heard the man!
- Go! Go! Go!
My old friend, Halley's Comet.
Not back for another 50 years.
So... who's gonna miss it?
COMPUTER: Targeting Halley's Comet.
Preparing condolence card for Halley's family.
Target acquired.
Hasta la vista, Halley.
- Yeah, baby! It works!
We're going home!
- Yeah!
- Awesome!
Hot diggity!
- This is not good.
- Oh, yeah!
Boom!
Come on, guys, lighten up.
It's party time!
Get down with your bad self!
There's enough Blubonium in that thing to blow up a planet.
Well, are we gonna sit around
"Garying" this to death or are we gonna do something about it? Ha-ha!
- Scorch!
- Are you nuts?
- Put that down, now!
MAN: Get him!
- Ha!
- You're going down!
- James, Cameron, get the alien!
- Scorch me, baby.
MAN: Brace yourself, boys!
SHANKER: Stop him!
MAN: He's walking all over you.
Stop him!
How you like me now?
- No! My reactor!
Whoa!
Get him out of here!
- No, stop!
- Gary, stay out of this!
Bring the little one, too.
THURMAN: You got him right where you want him, Gary!
If you can't fix that reactor, nobody's going home. Ever.
His quiet anger is even angrier than his loud one.
Uh-huh.
You useless blue moron.
Do you realize what you've done?
I saved millions of innocent aliens,
'cause that's what heroes do.
You failed at your evil plans,
'cause that's what villains do.
And this crumb got stuck on my face,
'cause that's what crumbs do.
- Scorch.
- It's OK, Gary.
Do what you want with me.
I'll never help you.
I thought you might say that.
Whoa!
Scorch! No!
- Any last words?
- Yes.
Friends, aliens, countrymen, lend me your tentacles.
Don't think of me as a hero.
Think of me as a guy who acted heroically while full of heroism.
Have you been practicing this?
Gary, tell Gabby I love her.
Tell my fans I love them.
Just as a general rule, if anyone asks, tell them I love them.
Hey, Gary, I love you too, little brother.
- Goodbye, cruel galaxy.
- No!
Huh. Well, looks like
I've got time for a few more.
Tell the guy that waxes my ship... what's his name again?
It doesn't matter.
Just tell him that I love him.
And the people at Dark Planet Cola,
- tell them I love them.
- Stop. We get it.
No. Stop! I'm a BASA engineer.
I can fix the Blubonium.
Don't help him, Gary!
We did the right thing!
- No!
- No! Scorch! Let him go!
As soon as you fix my peace shield.
Oh, and one more thing.
If you tell any of the others about this, I'll freeze you all!
- Get in there, alien.
(CHUCKLES) You got some nerve walking in here after that stunt.
- I... (WHIMPERS)
- Where's your brother?
- Shanker's got him.
- Why'd he let you go?
- Because he thinks I can fix it.
- Can you fix it?
- Of course. I'm a BASA engineer.
Oh, thank goodness.
- But I don't think I should.
- Say what?
- I fix it, we all go home, right?
- Exactly. What's wrong with that?
Shanker ends up with the most powerful weapon in the universe.
So he's got a toy for shooting down asteroids. Big deal.
You saw what it can do.
Who knows what he'll blow up next.
What if it's your planet?
Don't be paranoid, Gary.
It happens to smart people all the time.
You start thinking too much and it gets the best of you.
(GROANS) You guys actually trust Shanker?
- We're kinda low on options here, Gary.
- What choice do we have?
We refuse to fix it.
Then what? Stage a silent protest?
Come on, man!
You want us to be stuck in here forever?
I don't know what to do, OK? Just let me sit down for a second and think!
You mean sit around and do nothing.
Well, we're gonna try to fix it.
Are you coming or not?
You know what? We don't need you.
Come on, Thurman.
- Cut the red wire.
No, no, no! Cut the green wire.
- Scratch that. I'm colorblind.
- Quiet! I need to concentrate.
My third eye, it's messing me up.
I can't do it!
So that's it? Game over?
Step away from the Blubonium.
(LAUGHS) My man!
Thurman, you're fired.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I scored a 12.0 on my galactic engineering exams.
Do you know what that means?
You had no friends in high school?
It means in a galaxy filled with nerds,
I'm their king.
I hope this works.
We're going home!
It's time to pay my parking tickets!
Uh, Gary? Is that normal?
- Come on, Thurman, don't be paranoid.
- OK.
- Whoa!
(ALL CHANTING) - Gary! Gary! Gary...!
Speech, Gary!
Pack your stuff and be ready to go.
I'm going to get my brother back.
- This one was asking for you, sir.
- Leave him with me.
I'm here for my brother.
Ah, Gary... finally a team player.
I did what you asked.
I fixed the reactor.
And just in time.
Imagine how powerful I'll be with all this Blubonium.
- What? How did you...?
- You call yourself intelligent life.
(LAUGHS) These are fun.
- I could do that all day.
Let us go! You got what you wanted!
Why let you go now, only to hunt you down later?
Hunt us down?
But we come in peace.
Nobody comes in peace.
I was six years old when they took my father from me.
Think about this, champ.
With that many stars out there, there just has to be intelligent life.
- Golly! Can I have a look, Pops?
- In a minute, son.
What? What is that?
Good gravy! It's a UFO!
(LAUGHS) Son, you wouldn't believe it!
This is the moment
I've been waiting for my entire...
(ECHOING) No!
Before you join your brother, there's one last thing
I'd like to show you.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell.
Not the hair, you idiot.
- Lena!
- Ugh. Hello, Gary.
I see you've met my fiancé.
- Fiancé?
- We met online.
Get with the times, Gary.
LENA: Your whole family has been meddling in my business.
- Time to say goodbye, Gary.
(GASPS) - Kip! Kira!
Lena, please, he's using you.
He's using all of us. (SCREAMS)
OK, he's just jealous he couldn't have you.
- Hmm?
- Ta-ta.
- How could you do this?
You think I'm actually in love with an alien?
When she leaves your planet with my Blubonium, I'm gonna blow it up.
- But Baab's just the beginning.
I'm gonna wipe out the alien infestation one planet at a time.
If you destroy every planet with intelligent life, you'll have no stars left in the sky.
My stargazing days are over.
Let me out! (GRUNTING)
Hey, congratulations. You're free! Not!
- No, you can't do this!
Please! Let me out of here!
I don't know if you can hear me, but... I'm sorry.
My plan was to get you out of here, not end up frozen beside you.
I failed you. I failed my family.
All the planning in the world doesn't amount to anything without a hero to make it happen.
I tried, brother!
I'm sorry!
Scorch...
(WHISTLES) So that's Gary's wife?
How'd he make that happen?
I know. Isn't he all like...
Oh, Kip, I told you to run.
You shouldn't have come back.
I couldn't leave you, Mom.
A Junior Adventurer never leaves a man behind.
Kipper, this isn't a game.
I know. I'm not a little kid anymore.
That's why I came to rescue you.
And you're very brave, but now we're both stuck in here.
That's because
I'm not done rescuing you.
Blast tape?
You let them catch you.
Mom, I'm gonna need you to be quiet.
- Kip, be careful.
I can't believe we're guarding a lady and a kid.
- It's embarrassing.
- Is this a daycare?
- Here goes nothing.
Hey!
Open the door! Open the door!
Hurry up!
(GRUNTS) Kip, look out!
Uh-oh.
Consider yourselves scorched! (GRUNTS)
(WHISPERING) Come on, we don't have much time.
I've gotta stop that ship.
You go hide in Mission Control and lock that door behind you.
Copy that!
JAMES: This whole villain thing, it's not you.
You know? And the stress is aging you, if I might be...
LENA: Shut up.
Don't you have a mute button?
- It's locked.
Our government thinks asteroids are Earth's biggest threat.
But some of us know better.
The biggest threat to planet Earth?
(WHISPERING) - Global warming.
- Mm-hmm.
- Aliens.
- Oh.
We will wipe out their planets before they come for us.
- Our first target? Planet Baab!
That's Gary's planet!
COMPUTER: Targeting planet Baab.
Target acquired.
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, sir?
Sorry to interrupt.
Just wondering approximately what time you'll be sending us home.
- Is he really this stupid?
The only place you're going is the freezer.
Oh! I trust there'll be no more outbursts?
IO: - No!
COMPUTER: Danger. System malfunction.
(GRUNTS) Why isn't it working?
Gary?
No! It's a trap!
Shut it down! Shut it down!
- No!
COMPUTER: System overload.
Evacuate! Evacuate!
Seriously. Get out of here.
Everybody, out!
Scram. Gotta go. Uh-oh.
- Ooh!
- They're off! We're free! Whoo!
You're all gonna pay for this!
Freeze the aliens!
SHRIEKS: Io, get up!
It's time to get mad, girl.
- What about the program?
Forget the program!
MAN: - Tasers to full power!
- Yeah! Take that!
That's what you get when you mess with the Doc!
MAN: - Huh?
Uh, guys?
We might wanna get out of here!
Scorch!
Scorch, hey! Come on!
- Scorch!
(GRUNTS) Gary?
Oh, it's good to see you.
- Huh?
- Are you OK?
Of course I am.
Nothing can stop Scorch Supernova.
Whoa!
Ow! I'm having a bit of a leg situation over here.
You're still thawing out.
Gary, I'm too heavy.
Go! Save yourself.
Scorch, I couldn't.
I'm not serious!
Come on, put some back into it!
- Get me outta here!
I'm free!
- Ooh!
- A Snarkbeast.
Don't worry. They look mean, but they're completely harmless.
(LAUGHS) I'm free!
(MUFFLED) I'm not free.
Uh... Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
- Oh, dear.
- Yummy!
- Oh, no!
- I don't think so.
SNARBEAST: Got outta that place!
I'm starving here!
- Let me go!
Oy vey.
- Io!
Come on, now, you saved us.
We couldn't leave you behind.
Us aliens gotta stick together.
Whoa! Hello, talking rat.
Why you gotta disrespect me like that?
Gary, I could kiss your brain!
Destabilizing the Blubonium was brilliant.
I taught him everything he knows.
He's still frozen. Grab a leg.
I'm covered in slime. I can't do this!
Come on!
MAN: They're heading for the elevator.
- Locking it down.
- Leave them.
They're sitting ducks in there.
(LAUGHS) Alpha Team, they're headed your way.
Copy that, sir. All right, boys, set your freezers to ice cold!
Move! Move! Move!
So, Gary, what's the plan when we reach the top?
Uh, just give me a second, let me think.
You'd better think fast.
MAN: Here we go.
- Aliens, come out to play.
- Hmm?
- Huh?
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- I don't see 'em!
- They're not there!
They're gone. Huh?
- Now!
- Whoo-hoo!
Freeze 'em!
- Get 'em!
- Fire!
- Oh! Oh!
- There he goes!
- Find him! Find him!
- I'm out!
I can't believe you talked me into this!
- Shoot him!
- Don't freeze up out...
Hey, Gary, check it out!
The freezing wore off!
Aw, come on!
Huh?
Whoo! Did you see that? I am the man!
(MUFFLED, GRUNTING) - My lips!
- Come on, come on, let's go!
(MUFFLED) Ouch! My lips got stuck!
It's a simple binary lock circuit.
I'll just reconnect the main IC control switch...
Haven't I taught you anything?
- Got it.
- Yes!
- Freedom!
- Nice work, brother.
- Scorch, where's the ship?
Follow me! It's this way!
Actually, it's this way.
JAMES: I get it.
Being the villain can be lonely,
but you're looking for love in all the wrong places.
He's using you.
What's wrong with Zane in Sector 113?
- He's a lovely chap. Just...
LENA: - Shut up already!
Get me Shanker.
What do you want?
I'm kinda busy right now.
What's going on?
What happened to your hair?
Those blue idiots you sent ruined everything.
- Nothing's ruined.
- This is all your fault.
If you screw up this delivery, we're through!
No! I'll make it up to you, please!
- Turn this ship around.
(GASPS) Huh?
Kira? What are you doing here?
Let's go home.
I bet it makes you happy seeing me like this.
No, of course not.
How could I have been so stupid?
He used me.
It's never too late to do the right thing.
You're just like Gary.
So innocent. So naive.
Please! Lena, help me!
It doesn't have to be like this!
You thought you could stop me, didn't you?
Little Miss Housewife saves the day!
You've betrayed your people!
You've betrayed your planet...
...and you're not fit to wear this uniform!
What? You think just 'cause a chick has kids she can't dish it out?
- Pshh.
Computer, reset course to planet Baab.
Hurry up! The ship's down there!
(PANTING) Whoo!
I gotta lay off the burritos.
I cloaked it as one of their spaceships.
Come on!
- Sorry!
- Dude, don't you knock?
Hammer, get out here!
You're never gonna believe this!
Whoa!
- Awesome.
I'm going! I'm going!
Nope! Two down, a hundred to go.
Scorch, which one is it?
Blue buddy, what's up?
My brother cloaked our ship and lost it.
WOMAN: - Close the door! I'm changing!
- Nope! Ha!
No problem.
- False alarm?
- Yeah.
(BOTH) Tornado!
- Tornado?
- Out of my way!
MAN: - Take cover!
- Oh, my God!
- My cooler!
Come on, quick!
Aha! There it is!
Yes!
Hi, honey! I'm home!
- Sweet ride!
- There it is!
Wait! Aren't you going to abduct us?
Uh, we don't really do that.
- They come in peace.
- Awesome.
- Whoa.
- Fly, blue buddy! Fly!
(LAUGHS) - We're going home!
- Yes!
Gary, I love it!
Trashing bad guys, flying spaceships, we might be related after all.
You know, in some strange way,
I'm gonna miss this place.
- I hate this planet!
- We got company!
- Hang on.
(LAUGHS) Yee-haw!
Sweet flying, Gary!
I didn't think you had it in you.
DOC: Nobody panic! I mean nobody else!
I'll panic for all of us. (SCREAMS)
- Ugh!
I don't fly well.
When I feel queasy, I try breathing deeply through my nose.
PILOT: Careful with your warning shots. Shanker wants 'em alive.
(GASPS) Incoming!
- Oh, we're hit!
- Oh... no!
- What's going on?
- The computer's fried!
- Our steering's gone.
DOC: - Oh, no!
Oh, no! I've seen this in a movie!
It does not end well!
Mayday! This is Supernova-9!
We're going down!
(OVER RADIO) Mayday!
I repeat, we're going down!
- We're a dead stick!
- Huh?
This is the Supernova-9!
(GASPS) - What?
- We are going down!
- Dad?
- Kipper!
- Yeah, it's me, Dad!
- Where's Mom?
Put a grown-up on, bud, we're in trouble.
I'm the only one here, Dad.
Kipper, this is serious.
We're going down.
No, you're not. (GRUNTS)
Kip, what are you doing?
Supernova-9, you are go for remote assistance.
(GASPS) OK, Kip, this is just like flying your remote control ship.
What? This is nothing like his remote control ship!
- Just a little to the left.
(SCREAMS) Too much left! Too much left!
We got a student driver?
Every man for himself.
Ah! We're gonna hit that cliff! Pull up!
Take out their engines.
Let's force 'em to land.
DOC: - They're shooting!
- We're not gonna make it!
I've got this, Dad. Trust me.
Pull up! Pull up!
- Three...
GARY: - Pull up!
- Kip?
- ...two...
- Pull up!
...one. (GRUNTS)
Get out! Get out!
- Yes!
- We made it!
(LAUGHS) See ya later, suckers!
- Yes! Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.
Mission Control, that's some good flying.
- I told you, Dad, I got this.
SCORCH: - Way to go, Kipper.
Uncle Scorch?
Everyone is on board and accounted for.
- Hey, guys, say hi to my son.
IO: - Hi!
- What's up, little man?
- Pleased to meet you.
(GASPS) Dad, there's something coming up behind you!
- What?
SINGSONG: Gary,
I'm not finished with you!
- It's Shanker!
He's got my mission suit.
I made some modifications.
You like them?
What's going on?
Why aren't you moving?
We're caught in a tractor beam.
You've gotta get us out of it!
It's not working. We're burning up!
We gotta knock off that tractor beam.
Nice one, Gary.
How do we do that?
We take it out at the source.
(GASPS) You mean go down there?
Be logical, Gary. You're asking me to jump with no chance of survival.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
Gary!
- He made it!
- Come on, Gary!
Get your hands off my brother!
Whoa!
- Scorch, what are you doing?
- We're a team, brother!
- Don't you remember?
- Aah! Help!
Hey, pal, we're having a moment here.
- Ow!
SCORCH: Get your face out of my hand!
Let go of my hair!
SCORCH: Hurry up!
Oh!
I guess this is it.
We were a good team!
You know, I always looked up to you.
- You looked up to me?
- I'm serious.
Great wife, great kid.
I always thought
I could do that one day.
You would've been a great dad.
- Hey, uh, Gary?
- Yeah, brother?
I'm sorry for firing you.
Actually, I quit.
Huh? What the...?
- Gary!
- What...?
(GASPS) You! Thank you.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Don't mention it.
- You can talk?
- Of course.
- Occasionally.
- From time to time.
Why did you save us?
I thought you worked for General Crazy.
At first, we felt bad for squishing his dad.
Turns out he was a psychopathic megalomaniac bent on destroying every known form of intelligent life in the universe.
Who knew?
What are you gonna do with him?
- Can't say.
- It'll give you nightmares.
Huh?
You're gonna pay for this.
I thought I told you, we come in peace!
Ouch! Oh, wow.
- First punch-out?
- Yeah.
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, feels great.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh-huh!
That was amazing!
I would've jumped, too, but it looked like you guys had everything under control.
This little guy's great.
- Can we keep him?
- Put me down!
- Let's go home.
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!
Ah, it's good to be home.
Mission Control, bring us in.
KIP: Check your six, Supernova-Q.
- Hiya, honey!
- Kira? How did you...?
That's my wife!
Oh, Gary, how'd you hook that up?
I always thought you were a little...
What does that mean?
Everybody always says that.
- Beats me.
GARY: I've come to expect the unexpected working with Scorch,
but I don't think anything could have prepared me
for working with my family to save our planet.
I guess life's pretty unpredictable after all.
- Yay, Scorch, you're the best!
You're so awesome!
- Yay, Scorch!
I love you, planet Baab!
- Yeah, Scorch!
- Yes!
- Way to go, Scorch!
- You saved us!
(SIGHS) No more hero stuff for a while, OK?
Are you kidding?
I'm never leaving the house again.
- Dad! (LAUGHS)
- We love you, buddy!
Kipper!
Kipper, that was amazing.
We're so proud of you, bud.
You were awesome out there, just like your uncle.
You are gonna be a great astronaut one day.
Maybe even as good as me.
Thanks, Uncle Scorch.
But I'm more of a mission controller.
Like my dad.
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN, coming through!
Oh, it's good to see you!
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN.
Tell us what it's like to be the greatest hero in the universe.
You're gonna have to ask him yourself.
Give it up for my little brother,
Gary Supernova!
Hey, I'm older than him.
(CROWD CHANTING) - Gary! Gary!
- So Gary, we still a team?
(SIGHS) Somebody's gotta watch your back. Little brother.
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
He's in trouble, again.
Seventy-two hours later,
he was on the most terrifying mission of his life.
(WHISPERING) Scorch, do you copy?
Yeah, brother. I'm scared to move.
GARY: Remember your training.
You can do this.
- I'm not gonna make it, Gary.
GARY: - Don't say that.
I'll be by your side every step of the way.
My wingman?
Your best man.
(PIPE ORGAN PLAYS
"HERE COMES THE BRIDE")
And do you, Scorch Supernova, take Gabby Babblebrock to be your lawfully wedded wife,
- to have and to hold...
- Oh, lo, are you crying?
No, I just got something in my eye.
Let's never break up, guys.
And do you, Gabby Babblebrock, take Scorch Supernova
- to be your lawfully wedded husband?
- I do.
And so, by the power vested in me by the Intergalactic Association of Radio Talk Show Therapists,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
(ALL) Aww!
Let's party!
- Hey, Scorch, way to go, man!
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah!
(GASPS) No! You're OK!
I can't believe you made it!
Nice to meet you.
(SIGHS) Here we go again.
Yeah! That's it, that's it!
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Come on, Gary.
Well, this is humiliating.
GARY: You know, you don't have to travel millions of light-years
and defeat a deadly intergalactic enemy
to find out that the greatest story of all is right here on your home planet,
with your brother, and your own family.
(LAUGHS) Love you guys!

Max!
Come on!
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.
This is Frey.
She's new here as well.
Can you read?
It's a giraffe. They were from Africa.
- You can read?
- Yes.
"There are many robot servants, and they serve you all day.
If you live there, you never get sick or old."
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?
Yeah, I promise.
Frey and...
...Max...
...forever.
Max, have you been stealing things again?
It breaks my heart.
Why do you do this?
So you can save up?
One day buy a ticket up to that place?
That place is not for you, or for me.
But it's not fair, Sister.
Why can't I go there?
Sometimes in life we don't understand...
...why things are the way they are.
But I know one thing.
I know you are special.
You will do something very important one day.
Something you were born for.
My little Max.
Off to work, huh?
Gotta get up early to work that line.
Make the world a better place.
That's real funny, I have a job.
Come on. You think I got money?
Do I look like I have money?
Come on.
How about you?
You got a little money?
Come on. What have you got in there?
What have you got?
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Oh, it's 5 bucks. Hey, wait a minute,
I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.
All right.
Please form an orderly queue.
Your bus has arrived.
Leave me alone!
Checked. Move on.
Your bags may be searched.
Good morning, officer.
Extensive criminal history.
Multiple felonies. What's in the bag?
Hair products, mostly.
I'm just fucking with-- Hey, hey, hey.
I'm just going to work.
Nothing's in the fucking bag.
Come on, I--
Misdemeanor: citizen disobedience.
I'm just going to work, man. Come on.
- Checked.
- Nothing in there, is there?
Zero tolerance policy applies to all citizens.
No shit.
You must report immediately to your parole officer. Thank you, citizen.
No, thank you.
- Frey, fracture, Bed 2.
- Just let us work, okay? Let us work.
Max?
Frey. I thought you were...
When did you get back?
Been back for a while.
I see things haven't changed.
- No, this wasn't even my fault.
- Of course not.
- Let me have a look. Pretty bad break.
- It isn't pleasant.
So you're a nurse, huh? You did it.
Yeah.
That's great.
You still stealing cars?
No. God, no. I don't do any of that stupid shit anymore.
I work at Armadyne.
- On the line, working my way up.
- They need you on the third floor.
Be right there.
So, you know, now that you're back--
Just a second, Max. Two seconds.
Dominica. Can you take over here?
Hey, listen. Now, you know, because you're back and everything--
Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
It's good to see you.
Stay out of trouble.
I do.
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.
- Out of the way, sir.
- Look, I get it.
I know why you left the neighborhood.
I understand.
If I was as smart as you, I would have left too. Have dinner with me. Just...
All right.
Look, I'll settle for a coffee.
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.
I gotta break my other arm to get attention?
- Stop. Stop.
- Because I will do that.
My life is complicated, Max.
I just-- I-- I-- I miss you.
- My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay?
- Yeah. All right.
- Coffee.
- Yeah, coffee. Right.
Get out of here.
All parolees must pass weapons inspection.
Hello.
I'd just like to explain--
Max Da Costa. Violation of Penal Code
2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
See, there was a misunderstanding.
Immediate extension of parole by eight months.
Wait, what? No, no, no.
I can explain what happened.
I just made a joke, and, you know--
Stop talking. Police officers noted violent and antisocial behavior.
We regretfully must extend parole.
Elevation in heart rate detected.
Would you like a pill?
No. Thank you.
- I'd like to explain-
- Stop talking.
Personality matrix suggests a 78.3 percent chance of regression...
...to old behavior patterns:
Grand theft auto.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Resisting arrest.
- Would you like to talk to a human?
- No, I am okay, thank you.
Are you being sarcastic and/or abusive?
Negative.
It is a federal offense to abuse a parole officer.
Understood.
Safety is our priority.
- Hey. Da Costa.
- No weapons detected.
- You're late for your shift.
- I had a thing--
No, you can't work with that.
You're out.
No, no, no. I'm good, man. I can work.
This comes off today. I'm fine.
- You're good?
- I'm good.
Okay. I'm docking you half a day.
- Yeah, all right.
- You're lucky to have this job.
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.
The restroom more than once per shift.
Please keep your workstation tidy.
A tidy workstation is an efficient workstation.
Check it out, man. I think he likes you.
Think he got his face peel today?
He looks good.
Attention. All workers must reach weekly quotas.
Please report any unsafe activity to your supervisor.
If we don't have a clear path to upside...
...our investors are going to start losing a lot of confidence.
What do you think I've been doing down on Earth?
- You think I enjoy breathing this air?
- No, of course--
I am doing everything possible to restore profitability to this company.
The company that I built.
Now, if you will excuse me...
...I have to not speak to you people any longer. Thank you.
Closing 34.
Fire in 34.
Burn her ID!
Let's go. Let's go.
We don't have much time.
We hacked three transponder codes, Spider.
Okay. Pull them up on-screen.
Codes have been accepted.
Fire up the shuttles!
We are going up!
- Welcome.
- Hello, madam.
- Take a look at the garden.
- We will. Thank you.
Yes, I understand...
My, how you've grown!
Are the children here?
Yes, with Dominica.
I have a present for you.
Go and get it with your mother.
It's next to the couch.
Ma'am, would you care for a refreshment?
Command: Cancel.
Sorry for disturbing you, ma'am.
We have a number of undocumented ships inbound.
Good afternoon,
Defense Secretary Delacourt.
Three undocumented ships are approaching Elysium airspace.
Emergency orders six and seven are now in effect.
Protocol 22/B-39 in progress.
Attention, incoming vessels.
You have made unauthorized entry into Elysium airspace.
Return to Earth or we will be forced to take immediate action.
You are in violation of Elysium airspace.
The standard warning didn't work.
Fifteen thousand kilometers and closing.
- What do you want us to do, ma'am?
- Activate Kruger.
Ma'am, according to Executive Order 355...
...we are unauthorized to use our assets on Earth.
I am authorizing you.
Yes, ma'am.
Agent 32 Alpha, we are sending a packet. Over.
Welcome, Agent Kruger.
Ten thousand kilometers and closing.
Sending coordinates to asset.
Syncing target data.
Shoot them down.
Green light, 21B. Green light.
Missiles away.
Two ships destroyed.
Forty-six total casualties.
Impact in five...
- The last missile was a miss.
- Ridiculous.
Only one made it.
The ship has breached our atmosphere.
First undocumented ship just touched down.
I want everyone coming out of that vehicle apprehended.
Identification confirmed.
Scanning.
Reconstruction process initiated.
No.
We have 32 arrests, 13 casualties and two illegals still at large, ma'am.
Reconstruction complete.
You are under arrest under the 68-C Immigration Act.
- All illegals are now in custody, ma'am.
- Yes.
Send them to Deportation.
Get them off this habitat.
Secretary Delacourt, please report to President Patel immediately.
Secretary Delacourt, report to President Patel.
What up, man?
What happened?
- The police.
- You okay?
Don't worry about it.
Max, I gotta talk to you.
Okay, you know-
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
- You didn't hear what I was gonna say.
- All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Okay. You know the house of Los Zetas, up on the hill?
- Yeah, the one with all the guns.
- Yeah. They have five cars. New ones.
It's gonna be three of us.
Tomorrow at lunch.
- Lunch time. That's the plan?
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.
- What? You have a better plan?
Yeah. We just take one guy, go before the sun comes up.
You take the two fastest cars, torch the batteries on the other one so-
Fuck you, fuck you.
I got you. Please, man, you're the best.
Give me one year.
- Just one year.
- I'm not going back to prison.
One year, please.
Look at you. You used to be a legend, and now what?
The time is 5:50 a. m.
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.
Closing 34.
Hey. You're holding up the line.
No. No, no. I got a jam.
Attention. Workers may not visit the restroom more than once per shift.
- What have you done, Da Costa?
- No, I'm just trying to reset.
Let me look. Let me look.
- The pallet's pinched.
- Yeah, it moved.
- Just go in there.
- No. I mean...
Look, either you go in there right now or I'll find someone who will...
- ...and you can clean out your locker.
- Come on.
No. That's the deal, okay? In you go.
Let's go, people. Back to work.
Fuck.
No, no. No, no, no!
No. No, no! No, stop. No, no!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey.
Hey, come on, you guys.
It's too late. It's too late, come on.
Come on.
Extraction!
They started the fight, Sister.
I just want to live there.
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?
Yes.
Well...
Now look how beautiful we look from there.
Keep it.
This is yours now.
To never forget about where you come from.
What happened?
You have been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.
You will experience catastrophic organ failure.
In five days' time, you will die.
What is going on?
Why has production stopped?
- He's been exposed.
- Don't breathe on me. Cover your mouth.
I'm sorry, sir.
Does his skin fall off or something?
I don't want to replace the bedding.
Get him out.
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thank you.
Mr. Carlyle, your shuttle is ready for departure.
Please sign this to receive medication.
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you functioning normally until your death.
Please take one pill with each meal.
Thank you for your service.
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.
Your mandate is to deal with illegals quietly.
I am aware of that.
And then there's the use of this...
...agent, a Mr. M. Kruger.
Fifteen human rights violations.
Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.
The man's been diagnosed with serious psychological issues.
We made it explicitly clear to you...
...that we are no longer using sleeper agents.
Tell me something, President Patel.
Do you have children?
I am not the one being reviewed here.
Then I will assume you do not.
Perhaps if you did have children, then you would behave in a manner...
...that is more conducive to the longevity of this habitat.
I understand that it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do.
I understand that perfectly.
But when they come for your house...
...for the house you built for your children...
...and your children's children...
...it won't be PR and campaign promises that keep them out. It will be me.
I've heard enough.
This is your final warning.
Any further unauthorized actions, and you will be removed from office.
And let's discharge this Agent Kruger permanently.
All in favor?
Good. Effective immediately.
You want some beer?
You have been discharged from CCB.
Please return all weapons to the local embassy.
Fuck your politics, man! Fuck you!
Max.
Max.
What happened? Jesus.
Let me help you.
Let's go in, come on.
Max, what happened? Jesus.
Max. What happened?
- I shouldn't have gone in, man.
- Go in where?
Jesus.
I took a full dose, man.
I got a full dose.
You're gonna be okay. Let me help.
You're gonna be okay, Max.
They gave me Miporol, man.
They gave me fucking...
...Miporol.
Five fucking days, man.
I only got five days.
You have to take this.
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.
- I know.
I'm gonna go see Spider.
Max. Max, take the pill.
There you go.
To see Spider, you need money.
I'll give you everything I have, but it's not enough for a ticket.
He's gonna give me a ticket.
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.
Frey, we've done everything we could to help your daughter.
I met with the board today and they recommend we send her home with you.
How can I work here and leave her at home?
It can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.
I know. If she has another seizure, of course bring her back to the ward.
Of course.
But until then, she's discharged.
This isn't Elysium.
We can't just heal her.
Max.
It's been a while, my brother.
How's life at the factory?
I need to ask you a favor.
What? I can't hear you. What?
I need a ticket up there.
- And an ID.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
Absolutely.
Do you prefer aisle or window?
I'm being fucking serious, man.
Listen. I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back and work for you.
Anything you need, man.
I'll fucking pay it back.
You know what?
This is priceless.
This is priceless.
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.
Do you have any idea how many idiots come in here...
...saying the same kind of bullshit?
I got little kids coming in here every day.
Max, if I were you...
...I'd get the fuck out of here right now.
Max, don't. Hey, Max, don't.
I did three years for you.
After everything I did for you, you'll get me up there.
- Can you feel this?
- Go ahead and shoot.
I got so much radiation in my body, you're probably getting sick yourself.
- You're really dying?
- I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.
See this? It's over. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down! Get out of here!
Okay?
Listen. I've been looking for someone to take a job for me.
But no one here had the balls!
You said you'd do anything, right?
Max.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
All right, here we go.
This...
...my friend...
This can be your ticket up there.
One last job for me, you earn your way up.
- What is it?
- Take an Elysian asshole, right?
A billionaire.
He's down on Earth for some business.
He's here for whatever. We hijack him.
- Fuck that.
- Okay, relax.
It gets, like, much worse.
Forget his watch. Forget his ride.
Forget all that shit.
This is what you take.
Organic information, right out of his head.
Now, I'm talking about bank codes, passwords, log-in data.
Access to billions.
All you have to do is plug into his brain...
...download the data into yours with this baby...
...and bring it to me.
This is crazy, Max. Come on.
Once we verify the data, I'll give you a one-way ride, all expenses paid.
Even throw in some snacks and a drink.
All you have to do is walk into a house and use the med bay...
...and you're cured.
Sandro will do the surgery.
You know him?
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.
I'm good.
Actually, you seem all weak and fucked up.
So you know what? I'll have them...
This is crazy. Let's get out of here, please. Listen to me.
- What the fuck am I gonna do?
- I'll have them install...
...this. A third-generation exo-suit.
We hook this into your nervous system, it'll make you as strong as a droid.
You're already under the knife, right?
Let's get out of here. Please.
I want a four-man team, but I pick them.
I'm sending my own data wrangler.
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough.
- Okay.
But I'm taking Julio.
He gets a ticket up there, same as me.
Yeah, sure.
Okay. I'll go get the boys ready.
Wait.
It's gotta be John Carlyle.
The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?
That's the mark.
Secretary Delacourt,
Mr. Carlyle has arrived.
You are here to persuade me to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?
Astute as always.
Come with me.
I'm not interested in your little ideas.
I'm interested in something much larger.
This habitat is dying.
There is a political sickness inside of it.
A tumor that needs to be removed.
You and your company are in need of revenue...
...that is drying up.
So you built the torus.
Can you override the servers and place a new president in power?
A coup?
Are you suggesting a coup?
Is it possible?
I could write a reboot sequence and shut down the entire system.
And at that point...
...you could encode a new president, yes.
Then that is what you will do.
And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years.
Missile defense batteries, droids.
Everything we need to protect our liberty.
All guaranteed, of course, by your new president.
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.
This is the guy.
- This is the guy?
- This is him.
Sit down.
We're gonna cut you a good one.
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.
Let's get him an ID first.
Get the chief one of them identification codes.
Get that ready.
Arm up.
That'll merge with the DNA and you'll fit in like you were born there.
Now it's time for the real fun.
Okay. What we got?
Hey, man.
Yo. Is this gonna hurt?
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt.
It's gonna hurt good.
When we're done with you, you're gonna be a favela ninja.
Marianna, hey, bring down the bone saw.
- Bring the bone saw!
- This ain't gonna kill me.
You're gonna be all right, my brother.
Max.
I'm here.
We got this, man. We got this.
Yeah.
Hey!
He's awake!
You made it, huh? Surprise.
You can still jack off.
- How's everything going?
- He's ready to kick ass.
What the fuck did you do to me?
Gave you a way out.
Damn.
What's up, partner?
How's that suit working out for you, man?
That shit is tight.
Show me.
Hold that.
What's this, a family heirloom?
Wait for it.
Air-bursting ammunition.
Designate your enemy...
...and any round you fire will explode around them, five-meter kill radius.
And...
...synced detonation rounds for this bad boy.
That'll work.
Move out.
Sir?
Shuttle is ready.
Do you read me?
Here's the deal.
We'll wait outside the factory until we see his shuttle leave.
One of you puts an explosive round in it, goes to the crash site, gets the data.
Okay. Copy that.
Camera's live, boys.
You getting this, Spider?
I got it. Let's go. Let's play ball.
- Move out of the way.
- Coming through.
- You nervous?
- No.
No?
I'm shitting my pants.
- We're not gonna fucking die here.
- Yeah.
Go, go, go.
Acceleration to supersonic speeds in 15 seconds.
Come on, come on, come on.
Critical engine failure.
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen on Earth in danger.
Data coming up now.
Citizen identified. John Carlyle.
N8321P...
I see you, motherfucker.
I have a situation here.
Kruger, do you read me?
Miss Delacourt, how lovely to hear your voice.
There is a citizen carrying sensitive brain data out of the city.
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it.
- What's in it?
That's classified.
You don't call a recently deactivated agent...
...to retrieve classified fucking information, man.
The government doesn't know about this, do they?
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?
Please brace for impact.
Please remain calm.
You have sustained zero injuries.
Oh, that's a real comfort.
I got one condition.
I do this, I get reinstated.
Fine. I've recommissioned two of your preferred agents...
...completely confidentially, of course.
They should be at your position any second.
Send me the mission data.
Let's go, guys. Out of the cars.
Droids, there appears to be some type of wheeled vehicle with one...
Two occupants...
...and they are armed and I'd like them dead.
Droid!
It's jammed! It's jammed!
- No!
- Identified. Max Da Costa.
Federal parole number 61492-8-557.
Come on.
It's jammed, man!
Got it.
He's reloading!
- You all right?
- We gotta go faster. I got the door.
Go, go! I got you covered!
Go, go, go.
Don't fucking move.
- Bring it!
- There's another one.
Die, motherfucker!
Don't hit the mark!
No, no, no! No, no!
He got hit, he got hit!
Citizen has sustained a cardiothoracic trauma.
Blood pressure is dropping.
It's not in the head. It's in the chest.
We're fucking good, man.
Hold his head. Hold his head.
Plug this into you.
Come on, get that shit in.
- Come on, baby.
- It's in.
- Yes.
- Is it working?
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.
You have no idea what you're doing.
One minute to target, sir.
All right. All right, we're synced.
Come on, baby, here we go.
It's gonna work. We got it.
It's gonna work.
It's a data heist, ma'am.
They're downloading now.
Guys, we got incoming.
Oh, fuck me.
Come on, guys, hurry up.
That's a Raven. That's military.
That's all right, we got this.
Ninety-seven, 98.
- Hurry up! They're coming!
- Almost there.
Ninety-nine! Ding, here we go!
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.
- What the fuck? What does that mean?
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
I can't read the data.
- It's scrambled. I can't read the data.
- What?
Come on, guys, we gotta move!
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean?
- Fuck this.
No, no, no. We have to run it again!
Run it another time, man!
Fucking get off me, man.
I'm fucking bailing.
Please run it again.
- I can't. Get the fuck off me.
- Let's get out of here.
Where the fuck are you going, Sandro?
- Let's get out of here!
- Goddamn it!
Come on, Max.
Get out of there! Let's go!
We gotta go! Come on, Max. Come on.
Hey, boss. We got a runner.
Locked on.
Fire!
Shit, man.
That's what I'm talking about!
Fuck, man!
Targets moving south-southwest.
Move, Max. It's coming.
We got another one.
Okay.
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.
Going into a holding pattern, sir.
Where do you think you're going?
Come on!
Fuck! Fucker!
Come on.
No!
No. No.
No.
Get up!
Get up!
No!
We've got one assailant leaving on foot, ma'am.
They have the data. Repeat:
The thieves have the data.
Apprehend the target at all costs.
Do not damage his brain.
Let's go! We got a runner, boys!
Citizen has suffered catastrophic blood loss leading to cardiac arrest.
Time of death: 1745.
Come on, where are you hiding?
What's that?
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.
Fuck you, man! Find him!
Take us back to the crash site.
See what they left behind.
Roger that.
Hey, boss.
I think you'd better come look at this.
This is a record of what we picked up...
...in transfer between Carlyle and the criminal, sir.
That's why she wants it so badly.
He's got the keys to the kingdom in his fucking head.
Now we just need to find him.
I'm gonna let the girls out.
Searching grids three through 11.
I'm authorizing a full containment order.
Issue a no-fly zone for Los Angeles.
- All of Los Angeles?
- The murderer is still out there.
Until we apprehend him, no one leaves the surface of that city.
What the...?
Max.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.
We can go home.
Am I better?
I'm gonna get the car, okay?
Be right back.
Frey...
Max.
Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- Shit. Let me get the medics.
- No. No.
I can't go in there.
- Max, listen to me. You need a doctor.
- I can't go in there.
People are looking for me.
They'll kill me.
- I came for you. I need your help.
- Max.
You've got to go through the system to get treatment.
Please help me. I don't wanna die.
Max.
Max.
Stay awake.
I wanna see the man.
Mommy's gonna help him, okay?
Try and sleep.
Don't sleep.
Come on.
Max, you can do it, come on.
Stay awake.
Let's turn you over.
Max. Max, wait.
Thank you.
Who did this to you?
Oh, no, I got...
I got hurt at work, and I had to...
I had to take a job from Spider to try to get up there and get healed.
It went bad.
- I'm in trouble.
- Mommy?
Hey, sweetie. Come here.
Who's that man?
His name is Max. Mommy knew him when he was your age.
This is Matilda.
Hi.
You can go watch cartoons, okay?
I'll be right there.
I didn't-- I didn't know you had...
- I'm so sorry. I need to go.
- Wait, Max. Wait.
- Don't leave. Wait.
- I shouldn't have come here.
Max. She's dying.
She's in the final stages of leukemia.
I told you my life was complicated.
I need you to help me.
I have no idea how to do this.
- How to do what?
- Get her to Elysium.
- I can't help her. I would...
- Max.
- I would if I could.
- What about this? Fake citizenship.
If you took her there, could you heal her with this?
It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me.
It's locked to my DNA.
These people who are looking for me--
You don't understand who these people are.
If they find me here, they will kill all of us.
The only thing I can do to help you is leave, I promise you.
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.
You have bandages.
Yeah, I got bandages.
- What are you doing?
- I don't want you to be sick.
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- No--
There once was a meerkat who lived in the jungle.
He was hungry, but he was small.
So small. And the other big animals had all the food...
...because they could reach the fruits.
So he made friends with a hippopotamus to--
Okay, stop.
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.
Yes, it does, because he can stand on the hippopotamus's back...
...to get all the fruits that he wants.
What's in it for the hippo?
The hippo wants a friend.
I'm sorry.
Hey, boss.
I think we got him.
Land this fucking craft.
- Mommy, is everything okay?
- It's okay, sweetie.
Clear.
It's okay, sweetie.
Afternoon.
Sorry to come bursting into your home.
I didn't mean to traumatize your young daughter.
Me and the boys here...
...we're looking for a young gentleman...
...who was in this very house a moment ago.
We're hoping you can tell us where he went.
No. I...
I don't know where he is.
I don't believe in committing violent acts in front of kids...
...so I just need you to close your eyes, sweetheart.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
I really need you to tell me.
Where is he? You remember now?
- Mommy.
- Close your eyes.
Keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.
Please, I don't know where he is.
He was wounded.
I helped him and he left.
Please.
Do you fucking hate that?
No loyalty nowadays, eh?
It's okay, sweetie.
And what's this here? This a hospital you running here? What's going on?
- She's sick.
- She's sick?
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct there, eh?
I said don't touch her!
I'm trying to get a word with your child.
If you give me a second.
Bring her. Come.
- Where are you taking us?
- I've got something you want.
- It's okay.
- Mommy.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
Sit down. Shut up.
Stop.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.
Put the guns down. Let him come.
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?
That's why they shut down the sky.
Come on. What is it? Wire transfers?
Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big.
I fucking got nothing, man.
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me.
- Let's go fucking now!
- We can't!
The flight system is jammed!
Nobody is going up there.
- Till when?
- Till I don't fucking know.
- I gotta get up there, man.
- Oh, everyone needs to get up there.
My guys are working to see if we have a hope in hell...
...which I personally think we do not, of ever getting back online.
But for now...
...let's just take a look at that head of yours.
- Get away from me, man.
- Just look at me.
If they shut down the whole fucking sky for what's in your head...
...maybe the key to opening it could be in there too, right?
Come on.
All right.
They will hunt you to the edge of the Earth for this.
What is it?
It's a reboot program for Elysium.
Whoever has this has the power to override their whole system.
Open the borders.
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.
This can save your life.
We can save everyone.
When can I go?
They're trying to hack through the signal jam, but soon.
- Don't bullshit me. When can we go?
- I don't know. Five days.
Fuck you. I don't have five days.
- I got hours.
- My guys are working on it.
You're always working on it.
You can't get me up there.
Why do you even try sending people up?
They just get shot down.
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about.
We would control the system here.
We would be in charge.
We can change the course of fucking history here.
Back up, then.
What I have in my head is worth a lot to them, right?
Don't do this.
If that falls into the wrong hands, they could shut us out for good.
Listen, man,
I'm going up there right now.
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed, you can have all of this.
- But I'm not fucking dying.
- This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.
It's okay. It's okay.
I always wanted a wife.
I just couldn't quite settle down, you know.
Too much temptation.
But you...
You make me ready to settle down.
You really make me wanna settle down, baby.
Holy shit, sir.
- You better take a look at this.
- What? What is it?
Check this fucking oke.
Turn us around.
- Drakey?
- Yes?
Open the door.
Stop right there!
You're gonna do exactly what I say or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off!
- You understand?
- Yeah.
You can have everything in my head!
Just take me up there and get me in a med bay!
What I have is very valuable!
We can fix you up.
Put you in a med bay, sort all this kak up.
Let's go. We'll take you up there.
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.
Lekker, you'll dig it.
Don't you fucking try anything.
Step aboard. Come meet the boys.
Come, boet.
Don't be shy. They won't bite.
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey.
- This is Max.
- How is it, butch?
Close up, Drakey.
Copy that.
Crowe, let's go.
Yes, ma'am.
We apprehended the subject.
Open the skies, we're coming home.
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.
Cancel the no-fly zone.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
What is that? What is that?
Are we back?
- What the fuck is that? Are we back?
- We're back online, Spider.
Frey.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna make this right.
We've got him.
All right. Where is he?
He's leaving Earth, heading to Elysium.
Manuel, Rico.
Get weapons. Let's get up there.
Echo Leader 234 requesting landing in Sector 22.
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234.
You are cleared for entry.
I see you got the G-19.
Hey, back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
- Or what?
- I'll let it go.
What you gonna do, huh?
I want what's in your head, boykie.
Come on. Come on.
Legs! Grab his legs!
Grab the grenade!
Hold on!
Get down!
- What do you want us to do?
- I want everyone...
...coming out of that vehicle apprehended by Homeland Security.
Evacuate everyone under Level 5 clearance out of the building now.
Matilda!
I warned you of this.
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed, potentially threatening the torus.
All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.
- Get your hands off of me.
- This is an act of war.
That puts the CCB under my control.
Now, if you'd let me do my job...
...I'm sure you have a fundraiser to attend.
Let's go, sir.
Why are you not answering me?
Max.
- Take me out of here, Max!
- Yeah. I'm trying!
Air quality reaching toxic levels.
Get me out of here.
It is recommended you exit the craft immediately.
- Run!
- Come here, you fucker.
Two illegals heading northeast in Zone 3.
You deal with those two.
I'll handle this poes.
Welcome to this spectacular property, sprawling over...
Error.
- No.
- No citizen detected.
Please. She's sick. Help us.
She's gone into a coma. Please.
Shouldn't we remove this thing?
Can't, till we get all the data.
It's wired into him neurologically.
The data is intact, yes?
Data looks intact.
Warning.
We can still pull the data out of him, which will kill him.
Oh, that's fine. How long before you can download and turn the system online?
Not long, ma'am.
Keep everything in a restricted cloud.
Lock down all access.
Starting prep right now.
And get these two out of here.
Roger that.
Crowe, you wanna go get the boss's chicks?
Yeah, boet.
Give them the runaround.
Keep them busy.
Got him.
Let's go.
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy.
You ready?
What are you taking out of him?
Hey. What are you doing to him?
What's gonna happen to him? Hey.
Rise and shine.
- Get up.
- Max.
Max. Max!
Max!
Get in there.
Away.
Boss got fucked up, eh?
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?
His brain is fine, but he's gonna be pissed when he wakes up, eh?
Remember the kak that happened in India when he lost his legs.
Kruger.
Hey, boss.
It's Crowe.
Where is he?
All right. We're all set.
Okay. Let's re-sedate him.
Got the needle prepped.
Here, you wanna grab this and then--
Grab the needle! Grab the needle!
Stick him with it!
- Where did they take the girls?
- The armory.
- Where the fuck is that?
- Level three.
Lethal radiation poisoning detected.
You require urgent medical attention.
You idiot.
Do you realize what you've done?
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle into a suburban area.
Your orders were to keep this covert.
Do you even remember what that means?
Have you completely lost your mind?
You're useless to me.
If the administration realized what we're doing...
...they'd hang us both for treason.
For God's sake, Kruger, are you listening to me?
Yes.
Yes, ma'am...
...I'm listening.
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle and ruined someone's lawn.
But nobody is gonna hang us for treason.
We do the hanging.
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.
Not so chirpy now, eh?
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about to get its first proper president.
She needs some medical attention.
I was gonna heal your daughter.
But now I will make sure that she is never healed.
Drakey, don't trust any of these politicians.
- You clear out this whole building.
- Thank you, boss.
I'm gonna find that little gangster and I'm gonna take what's in his head.
This place is mine now.
You wanna come to my fucking house and play? Let's play.
I'm going to annihilate that little motherfucker.
I'm going to pulverize that little one.
Hey!
What the hell was that?
All members of CCB, please go to the nearest exit...
...and proceed calmly to ground level.
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go!
No.
No more.
Citizen deceased.
Please exercise caution.
Illegals detected in multiple locations.
Emergency systems are now online.
Please follow indicated procedures.
Spider. Do you read me, Spider?
Max, where are you?
The thing in my head, it can make everyone a citizen here, right?
- Yeah.
- You know how to get it out, right?
- Yes.
- You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, listen carefully.
Armory selected.
Set.
Turn me on.
Okay.
- Crowe, get rid of those two.
- My pleasure, boss. My pleasure.
Where are you, boykie?
Where are you?
How is it, girl?
- Let's play.
- No.
- Come on. I'll be nice, I promise.
- No, please.
- Come on.
- Get off me.
- Want me to hurt the girl?
- No.
- Then come here.
- Please.
Oh, fuck!
You fucker!
The only way out of here is through me.
- Is she alive?
- For now.
Stay behind me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I have a plan.
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of me coming for you.
I will find you! I will hunt you down!
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up.
- What?
Listen. You're gonna go to the surface, okay? Take this.
All right. Find a house.
Get her to a med bay.
- It won't work.
- Don't stop for anybody.
- She doesn't have an ID. It doesn't work.
- It will this time. I know how to fix it.
- Surface selected.
- Go.
- Come with me.
- I'm right behind you.
- No.
- I promise.
Okay. A mother and a daughter just went up in that elevator right there.
They're going to the surface, headed for a med bay.
Send one of your guys, make sure they get there, and we have our deal.
All right.
Right to a med bay, man.
- Let's go.
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go.
- This way. Come on.
- Come on. This way.
- Hurry up, man.
Emergency lockdown initiated.
Almost there. Almost there.
Pull it out!
It's just a flesh wound, boet.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Fire has been detected. All affected...
- Open the door. Open the door.
...areas will be shut down.
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Go, go, go.
Let's go.
Fucking door, come on. Go.
You first, come on.
Emergency lockdown initiated.
- Please stand clear of all exits.
- Come on.
Get up. Get up.
Come on, let's go. Stand up.
Come on. Stand up.
Stand up. Come on.
Come on. Stand up.
Hey.
You little fucker.
I'm gonna take your fucking head off.
You should definitely stand up now!
Stay there.
Fuck.
Okay.
- You think you can get through me?
- Come on, Max! Come on!
I'm just getting started.
Come on.
Don't give up now. Get up. Come.
Come on, you've got more than that. I know you.
You look a little bit dizzy, eh?
Did I get you? Are you bleeding?
You must get that looked at.
Eh, boykie?
You wanna heal that little girl?
You just need to come through me.
You've got some fire in you, boykie.
You almost had me.
We die together, boykie.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Come on, man. Let's go.
Let's go, man. Let's do it. Come on.
Okay. Let's go.
Get the door!
Come on.
All right. Let's do it.
All right.
Okay, we're good. We're good.
We're good.
What?
Max?
It's okay. I know.
There's no coming back from this.
No med bay can heal you.
All right. Give it to me.
Take it.
Okay. You just have to press that button.
Frey.
Max? Max, where are you?
I'm gonna have to break my promise.
I can't make it back up there.
You remember what
I said when we were kids?
Yes.
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?
Yeah, I promise.
You wouldn't believe what I'm looking at now.
Tell Matilda I really liked her story.
And I...
I figured out why the hippo did it.
Come on.
You first. Come on.
Everyone has one special thing, Max.
One thing that they are destined to do.
One thing they were born for.
- Neutralize him.
- Fuck you!
Let go of me.
Come on.
Hey, chiquita.
Hey.
Stand down, officers.
- Arrest him!
- I cannot arrest a citizen of Elysium.
- What?
- You did a great job.
Guess who Elysium belongs to now.
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?
Now look how beautiful we look from there.
This is yours now.
To never forget about where you come from.
My little Max.
- You're texting again?
- Huh?
Come on, put that down and swim with me.
In the ocean?
There's fish out there.
- Your loss.
- (chimes)
Oh my God. Bree!
Bree! Shark!
Bree, there's a shark!
Oh my God!
Somebody help her, please!
There's a shark!
Bree, shark! Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- What just happened?
- There was a shark.
- Oh my God.
- (elevator bell dings)
- (keyboard clacking)
Welcome to Blue Water.
This better be good, Sands.
I stood up an admiral to be here.
Trust me, Commander.
You're gonna wanna see this.
What are we looking at here?
S-11's been fitted with cameras.
We received these images
10 minutes ago.
My God.
Very "National Geographic," isn't it?
- Freeze it.
- (beeps)
See?
The girl got away.
Why didn't S-11 go after her?
Because we jerked its leash.
We told it to behave.
- Come again?
- Like a shark... let me let my daughter explain.
Like a shark, S-11 can sense electrical impulses, helping it navigate.
We manipulate this ability by transmitting focused electrical charges to a series of receptors implanted in S-11's cerebral cortex.
I have no idea what she just said.
S-11 is now totally under our control.
Blue Water Corp. Has just created the Navy's next superweapon.
Sands, you crafty SOB.
You did it.
Was there any doubt?
Baby girl, bring S-11 home.
- (beeps)
- (S-11 bellows)
Sir, we've got S-11 on an intercept path of a fast moving vessel.
Change course.
No, take it in closer.
Commander, the swimmer was a chance encounter.
S-11 still needs more testing.
I procured millions of dollars of taxpayer money to develop that thing.
Before Blue Water gets one more cent,
I better see it perform.
But the external interface is a prototype.
If something were to happen...
What did you have in mind,
Commander?
S-11 was designed to go where the Navy can't, right?
Sneak into hostile waters, hunt down drug runners and pirate vessels.
So you want us to treat that craft like the enemy?
Move in tight and pursue without being seen.
- Dad?
- Make me proud, pumpkin.
I told you to stop calling me that.
Make me proud, Nicole.
- Isn't this fun?
- Yeah, man.
- (laughs)
- (shouts) Hold on!
You can breathe now.
- (thuds)
- (moans)
Whoa. What was that?
You hit something?
Whoa!
What's going on?
- S-11 isn't responding to command.
- (keyboard clacking)
The propeller must've damaged the external interface.
I told you it wasn't ready for adverse conditions.
Get the system back online now.
It's not working.
I'm engaging the kill switch.
- (high-pitched whine)
- In three... two...
- one.
- It's too late, Nicole.
Look.
- (alarm blaring)
- Woman: We've lost our signal.
- Oh my God.
- What just happened?
S-11 escaped.
So you ever see anybody fall off one of these things?
Fall? Nah.
I seen a guy jump once, though.
Wife left him so he took a nosedive from 60 floors up.
- That's horrible.
- Ain't so bad.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Feel the wind in your hair.
- (sighs)
- Splat!
It's all over with.
I can think of worse ways to go anyhow.
Like what?
Like falling face first in a French fryer.
- (mimics sizzling)
- Thanks.
I'll have that image in my head all day.
Huh?
How about getting jammed into a wood chipper?
Whoa!
Oh no!
Not like this!
- (man grunting)
- (S-11 bellows)
Signals from the tracking implant are fading, but it looks like
S-11's heading south.
Commander.
You just unleashed an eight-legged man-eating shark on the world.
A minor setback.
If you're thinking of going back into that lab and creating a new freak, forget it.
I'm cutting off all Blue Water funding until you get S-11 back.
Fail, and that's not all I'll cut off.
Relax, Commander.
We'll get S-11, even if we have to go to the ends of the earth.
Okay, telemetry shows he's heading to Mexico.
Let's get a team down there now.
Any changes?
Hard to say.
The tracking implant was damaged when S-11 ripped off its control plate.
But we're still receiving ghost signals indicating S-11's presence in the coastal waters.
Can we pinpoint its location?
Not exactly, Dr. Sands.
But S-11 is here, and for some reason, it's sticking around.
Migratory instincts.
It'll feed along the coast a few days and then move on.
- This is us, sir.
- We're here?
I chartered a smaller craft too for the recovery mission.
A fast one, I hope.
- It will do the job, sir.
- Good.
Sir, I think we should also contact Andy Flynn.
Flynn?
He's here in Mexico?
Since you let him go two years ago.
I didn't let him go, Santos.
I fired his ass
'cause he demanded a raise... a big one.
He's a greedy bastard, no doubt, but he knows these waters better than anyone.
And he knows what we're up against.
If you want S-11 back,
Andy Flynn is your best shot.
All right, find him.
Who's ready for some tequila ball?
- Ready, gringo?
- Whoo!
You missed.
Let's go, ladies.
- There you go.
- Gracias.
Andy Flynn.
Still drinking that rotgut, huh?
Santos.
What's up, brother?
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
No, you didn't.
- Blue Water wants you back.
- Not a chance, man.
Not a chance.
- If it's about the money...
- Look, it's always about the money.
All right? That idiot Sands, he won't pay me what I'm worth, so I'm retired.
- Not anymore, amigo.
- (sighs)
S-11 escaped.
Please help me!
Please! No! Please!
Please!
No, don't!
No no no no no no!
No! No!
Hey, guys.
So glad you could join us,
Mr. Flynn.
- Do we have a location?
- Sands: No.
But like an octopus, he's very territorial.
It won't stray far.
You understand you are to capture S-11, not terminate it, right?
Well, your fish might have other ideas.
S-11 can be controlled,
Mr. Flynn.
Let me show you.
We call these interface darts.
Once attached, I can access S-11's bioimplants with my computer allowing me to direct its movements.
Like a remote control toy.
Sounds easy.
It won't be easy, believe me.
First, we have to tranquilize S-11.
That'll make him docile.
And then he won't resist commands.
The tranqs will bring S-11 to the surface, and then we can hit it with the interface dart.
Why don't we just nail it underwater with your dart?
They're more accurate if shot from a grenade launcher.
And since we only have two darts, accuracy is key.
Once I establish a link,
I can then navigate S-11 to open waters.
Then our techs on the yacht will be able to fix the interface.
So what do you say?
Are you game?
Yeah.
100 grand,
200 more upon completion, why not?
You think a great deal of yourself, don't you, Flynn?
Yeah, you know what I think?
I think you're a money-grubbing Neanderthal.
And the word on you is you like cheap women and cheaper booze.
Is that right?
300 grand or I go back to the pool.
Fine, 300 grand.
But only if you bring S-11 back alive.
Otherwise you get nothing.
This is a bad idea, Sands.
We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives.
That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering.
Damage it and heads will roll,
Mr. Flynn.
Yours will be first.
Fine.
Get your stuff ready.
We're going to the boat.
Santos and I will meet you at the dock.
Donde esta senor Kingsberry?
Ay ay ay.
Classy.
You Kingsberry?
Well, the locals call me Pez.
What can I do for you, angel?
First, Pez, you can stop staring at my rack.
They're just boobs. They're not gonna get up and dance or anything.
Second... you can tell me about this.
How'd you find me?
It's what I do.
I'm Stacy Everheart, an investigative reporter with CNE.
- And this is my cameraman Bones.
- Hey, buddy.
You sent that to our station two days ago.
It was a joke.
- A joke.
- That's right.
- Oh, we like jokes.
- Sorry to waste your time.
You're lying.
A creature fitting this description was sighted just last week in California.
Now it's in Vallarta and you've seen it.
Well, I wish to the devil I hadn't.
I can't close my eyes without imagining that... that thing squirming towards me.
It's gotten so bad
I can't take my boat out.
No, I'm done with that thing.
There's nothing you can...
What do you wanna know?
All right, Pez.
Can we stop?
Come on. We gotta burn off those enchiladas from last night.
But we're on vacation, and it's Mexico.
I think it's against the law to jog in Mexico.
Fine. You're gonna have to save your breath anyway.
You'll be screaming your lungs out soon.
Wait. Why?
Two words... bungee jumping.
I found a great spot over the ocean.
So not funny.
You know I'm afraid of heights.
Gonna have to get over that sooner or later. Today's the day.
All right, tell you what.
Do this and spend the rest of the day at the spa.
Mud-baths?
Seaweed wraps?
- Sure.
- Okay, you're on.
- (laughs)
- (screaming)
All right! Yes! Great.
- Nice.
- Whoo!
Man: Yes!
Nice.
Babe, that was awesome.
I can't believe I did it.
Who's afraid of heights now, huh?
Not my girl.
- Wait, I wanna go again.
- Wild child.
Vendor:
Listo. Vamos!
Whoo!
It's gonna be like old times, Santos.
- Yep.
- It's gonna be like old times.
She's got a sexy-librarian vibe going.
- You ever notice that?
- Don't even think it, bro.
Oh, what?
I'm just gonna talk to her.
I've heard that before.
Remember Cairo?
The lady snake-charmer with cobras?
- Cairo, come on.
- My left butt cheek went black, Flynn.
- Almost fell off.
- So you miss me?
Excuse me?
You might've noticed I took a little hiatus from Blue Water.
By hiatus, you mean my father fired you.
Yeah.
I did notice, Mr. Flynn.
Look, call me Andy.
All right.
Let's just get this over with so I can get back to work.
Give me your best line.
Okay. Um, here.
- What?
- Souvenir from Baghdad... piece of shrapnel from an IED.
Went in back here, played ping-pong with my insides.
If it weren't for Santos over there,
I probably wouldn't have made it.
So I have him to blame.
Look, I remember you too,
Nicole, all right?
You spent your whole life in that lab.
First one there, last one to leave.
And I get it.
That was me once.
All right?
My whole life was work.
Thanks to this little guy, it looked like there was no tomorrow.
So that's my line.
What do you think?
Being first in the lab earned me a doctorate from MIT and made me one of the best biomechanical engineers in the country.
I care about what I do,
Mr. Flynn.
As for you, you're a mercenary.
Says it all.
Hmm. Okay.
As smooth as ever, huh?
- Oh, shut up.
- (laughs)
Okay, if that didn't get your booty shaking, have somebody check your pulse,
'cause you might be dead.
I'm Captain Jack and this is PV Pirate Radio, your spring break destination.
Just in case they're listening,
I wanted to give a special shout out to the FCC,
'cause those are the boys who kicked my ass out of America.
And, boys, you have doomed me to a life filled with sandy beautiful beaches, smoking hot senoritas and ice cold pina coladas.
- You sure taught me a lesson.
- (both laugh)
Folks, I may never leave here.
God, I hate it here.
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, this place is amazing.
Yeah, whatever.
And what is it with all this... what do you call it?
- Sunshine?
- Yes. Sunshine.
Enough with the freaking sun already.
- It's annoying.
- (phone chimes)
What do you got here?
Tell you in a sec.
You are live in five.
Four, three, two...
Hey, party people, it's Captain Jack and you are listening to PV Pirate Radio.
First mate Stephie has just handed me some breaking news.
Apparently a half shark, half octopus has been sighted off the coast two miles south of Playa Del Sol.
According to sources, it is armed and dangerous.
Yes, it's half octopus, so it would be eight-armed and dangerous, right?
Well, Stephanie apparently is hitting the tequila a little early today and she's not sharing with her captain.
- (clicks)
- I always share with you.
Yeah.
So what is this, Stephie?
Is this some mad experiment gone horribly wrong?
- Maybe they're doing a movie.
- Oh, yeah. I could see that now.
A former Navy SEAL slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives.
I'd watch it.
Yeah, I know you would, Stephanie.
That's because you're easily amused.
I've seen you mesmerized watching a frozen burrito rotate in a microwave oven.
Let's get back to the music, shall we?
Coming up next, it's the Cheetah Whores, very hot band out of New York City.
Here is their latest hit.
It's called
"Hot Rod Hell Kitten." Meow.
- (rock music playing)
- What are you doing with this stuff?
I'm a hot rod hell kitten, get inside
I'm a hot rod hell kitten, take a ride
Itty-bitty pretty kitty
Let's go out and prowl the city
Do you wanna be my pet?
Do you wanna be my pet?
I'm a cheetah whore, can you run with that?
Yeah! Yeah!
Well, this is it.
- Nice view, huh?
- Yeah yeah, breathtaking.
- Hey!
- There.
Thank you.
- Hook me up?
- Not a chance.
Aw, you're no fun.
So what makes you think it'll come back here?
Well, when you spend your days gutting fish, you learn a thing or two about marine life.
- (spits)
- Hard to believe you're still single.
Would've thought some lucky lady would've snapped you up by now.
As I was saying, octopi are very territorial.
He'll be back.
Nicole: Santos, take it 20 miles south and stop by the rocks.
Let me see that thing.
Easy, bro.
Those spears inject enough MS-222 to put a bull shark to sleep.
But it can't bring down S-11?
Nicole: S-11's metabolism is higher than a typical shark.
Tranqs just make it more... amenable.
- Kind of like you and tequila, huh?
- (laughs)
- (sonar pinging)
- I got a signal.
- It's two miles south of here.
- Yeah, I know the place.
Resorts all over the area.
- Dad.
- Yes, Nicole.
- We got a signal.
- I don't have to tell you what's at stake here, pumpkin.
I told you to stop calling me that.
I'm counting on you, Nicole.
Bring S-11 home.
Okay, Stacy, in three, two...
Stacy Everheart here with local fisherman
Ryan Kingsberry.
It's Pez.
All right, Pez.
Can you tell us what you saw?
Well, I first saw the creature coming in from out there chasing a charter.
I thought it was a shark at first, and then I saw the tentacles and black soulless eyes like my third wife's.
Cut.
What are you doing?
Are you high or just that stupid?
Holy crap!
Hey!
Hey!
Get out of there!
Yoga instructor: Inhale.
Get out of there!
Inhale. Exhale.
Break left.
Hola, senorita.
You wanna play?
Not really.
Hey, what's the holdup?
Got it!
Mark!
- Are you getting this?
- Yes. Yes.
- (S-11 roaring)
- (screaming)
Pez:
Get out of there!
- Is it over yet?
- Um, not quite.
Pez:
Oh, this ain't happening.
That was horrible.
Sure. Sure.
Horrible.
Come on, let's go.
Damn it!
Lost the signal.
- What?
- I lost the signal. S-11's gone.
Damn it!
You sure that thing works?
I told you the tracer got damaged when S-11 escaped.
Great.
So we're chasing ghosts out here.
I don't think so.
We sure our freak did that?
The abrasions on his body are tentacle markings.
Why didn't it eat him?
Maybe he wasn't hungry.
Oh, keen insight.
I'm so glad you came along.
Tell me something,
Ms. Sands, what do you know?
I know octopi like big rocks.
- Sir.
- What is it?
There's something on TV
I think you should see.
Stacy:
My crew and I captured this footage an hour ago around Playa Del Sol...
So far only CNE is carrying this.
And that's supposed to make me feel any better?
Stacy: The creature appeared to be some hybrid of shark and octopus.
- A sharktopus, if you will.
- Hell.
Stacy:
As viewers can see, the creature is like nothing ever witnessed before, and neither is its brutality.
There's no confirmation by authorities yet, but fatalities are certain.
Dr. Sands, you've got an incoming call on satellite link.
- Stacy: It's only a matter of time...
- It's Commander Cox.
...before the sharktopus strikes again.
- All right, patch him in.
- Stacy Everheart reporting.
Wait.
First bring me a great, big, enormous scotch.
- Three and neat, sir?
- Yeah.
Got it.
What's going on?
Why did we come ashore?
To get away from your dad's
Eagle Scouts so you can tell me what the hell you're hiding.
- What are you talking about?
- S-11's killing at random. Why?
I told you,
I have no idea.
Look, even I know sharks aren't serial killers, okay?
They kill for a purpose.
And octopi?
(scoffs) Smart as hell, and not to mention stealthy.
Okay, so they're not gonna expose themselves unless they got a damn good reason not to.
Maybe our neural implants are damaging the impulse controls in S-11's brain.
Or maybe your father did something to that freak, something you don't know about.
You know, a little gene splicing behind closed doors?
No, he wouldn't do that, not without consulting me first.
My father is a man of science.
How about you tell that to the dead guy out there?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that I think your dad intended S-11 to succeed at all costs.
Blue Water didn't hire you to think.
They hired you to do a job.
And if you can't do it, we'll find someone who can.
Get Tom on the phone.
Look, I don't care if he's in a meeting.
Tell him Stacy Everheart wants to talk to him now.
- Thank you.
- (TV playing)
Yep, I'm watching the recap right now.
So what'd the network say?
Tom: The network is replacing you, Stacy.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
- That's the decision they've made.
- But it's my story.
- Hey, Stacy...
- I hope you understand, all right?
No, I understand.
- Fine.
- (beeps)
Rat bastards are sending in another reporter to take the lead.
- What?
- What is this?
Pez figured out a pattern in the attacks.
Show me.
This is where I first spotted the creature.
This was the attack on the bungee tower.
And this was the attack on the resort.
So it's sticking to the coast heading south.
- Yeah.
- What are we supposed to do?
Just head south and hope we run into it?
Worth a shot, and maybe we can get some more footage.
Then the network would have to make us the leads.
You know,
I bet we could cover a lot more miles by boat.
Fine.
But you're gonna double my salary and you're gonna pay for my car.
Oh, Pez,
I could just hug you right now.
I mean, if you were better looking and had better hygiene.
Oh, what the hell!
- Pez!
- I'm sorry.
Lock and load, boys.
It's time to get wet.
You got the helm, brother.
You better watch your back down there.
Oh, watching my back is your job.
- I don't know. Am I in your will?
- You get my dog.
You don't have a dog.
Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't want S-11 harmed, all right?
And we always do what Daddy says, don't we?
Relax,
I've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece.
We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works.
Yeah, it does work.
So make sure you don't miss.
I haven't yet.
Now I'm ready.
Patch him in.
Guess what I just saw on CNE.
S-11 looks impressive on TV, doesn't it, Commander?
Are you drinking?
Yes, I am. Scotch.
- Good scotch.
- Damn it, Sands.
You said you could handle this.
- Listen, if you can't handle...
- No, Commander, you listen.
The Navy said they wanted a killing machine.
That's exactly what I gave them.
And yes, the civilian deaths are a tragedy.
But greatness comes at a price.
It always has.
Just capture that freak before it shows up on TV again.
If the media links this to the Navy, we're screwed.
Don't worry, Commander.
I've got my best man on it.
Don't worry.
Flynn can take care of himself.
Worried?
Why would I be worried?
- No reason.
- Hey, do me a favor.
Stay out of my business and focus on the shooting.
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am.
What is that?
- Ink.
- Oh God, no.
- (thuds)
- (gurgling)
Santos.
It's right behind me.
It got me in the leg.
Did your tranq hit it?
No.
It pulled it out of its hide.
- What about the others?
- They're gone.
They're dead.
So what makes you think we'll spot it out here?
I don't know, but if you've got a better idea, I'm all ears.
No no, you're the captain.
Nice yacht, by the way.
Bite me.
Flynn: What do you think?
Two or three stitches?
Santos:
This is nothing.
Remember that go-go dancer in Bangkok?
Crazy chica nearly bit your pinkie toe off.
Now that was bad.
Man, I have no idea where that thing came from.
- It's like it knew we were coming.
- That's what sharks do, amigo.
No, this wasn't predatory instinct.
This was a planned attack.
- Is that mine?
- Damn it.
You better not have any diseases.
Yeah, well, it burns when I urinate.
- Shouldn't be concerned, should I?
- (cell phone rings)
- Oh, there's Daddy.
- Dad.
Yeah, it escaped and the tracer went dead again.
Is that your dad?
Tell him I miss him.
Is that Flynn?
Yeah, he's still in shock from the blood loss.
- Can he continue the mission?
- He'll be fine.
But the others, they weren't so lucky.
They knew the risks, Nicole.
Dad, S-11 is a killer, and they're random.
It's not even feeding on its victims.
Dad?
I had the tech boys make some adjustments to S-11's subroutines.
You altered my programming?
S-11 was a hunter.
We needed a killer.
So we enhanced its aggressiveness.
I designed the bioware.
I should've been consulted.
This isn't right.
It's time for you to grow up, baby girl.
Our feelings are irrelevant.
Right now all that matters is getting S-11 back.
Am I clear?
Are you with me?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now bring S-11 home, baby girl.
Did he ask about me?
- Can you move on that thing?
- Why? Wanna go dancing later?
Do you always make asinine jokes when men have died?
Look, what do you want from me?
I want you to do your damn job and capture S-11.
Okay. You heard the woman, fire it up.
- Where are we headed?
- South.
Nicole:
He's headed straight for that boat.
Flynn: I'm pulling up behind them to get their attention.
We gotta get them out of here.
Hey!
- Leave!
- Hey, this is a restricted area!
Can you hear them?
I can't hear what they're saying.
This is restricted area.
Bones, get on the clock.
Something's going on.
Please go!
They're not listening.
They'll listen to this.
- (gunfire)
- (gasps)
Keep filming.
- What are you doing?
- I didn't sign up to get shot.
That's my story you're running away from.
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Hey!
You crazy bitch!
Oh my God!
Your dad's gonna have to settle for damaged goods.
It's heading away from the rocks.
I'm gonna run that bastard down.
Santos, take the helm.
- I'm gonna take a shot at it.
- Got it.
- Santos.
- I'm on it.
Damn!
How about that one?
All right, man.
Perfect.
To the boat and back.
Loser gets the tequila.
Let's do it.
What are these morons doing?
Hey, you're a little close, huh?
- (whistles, laughs)
- What are you doing?
What is this, an amusement park to you?
- Hey!
- I'm trying to fish here.
- (laughing)
- Hey!
Hey, Maria.
I can't believe this.
What's going on, honey?
Bunch of stupid punks.
Dios mio.
Tequila's on you guys, and I'm super thirsty.
Where's Bob?
I don't know.
He was just right behind you.
Hey, something just touched my leg.
What was that?
Ed. Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
I've been horrible to you this whole time.
And you don't deserve it.
I'm sorry, Flynn.
It's Andy.
Andy, there's something
I need to tell you.
Got it.
Gracias, Miguel.
What?
Nothing.
What'd you find out?
The powerboat was rented by some Blue Water Corporation, some shady genetics engineering firm, knee-deep in defense department contracts, enough cash to go all Frankenstein and create our fish.
That's great.
What is wrong with you?
Were you a lawyer in a past life?
Or no, maybe you worked at the DMV.
Do you feel nothing, Stacy?
That guy was killed right in front of us inches away.
Inches away!
Gosh. He was kind of a nice guy, you know?
Smell a little funky, but he was okay.
Now he's dead.
And that's tragic truly.
But the story of a lifetime is right out that door.
And we can find it thanks to Pez's map.
- No no.
- Oh, come on, Bones.
He would've wanted it this way.
Don't let his death mean nothing.
You are so full of crap.
I know, but you're coming with me anyway.
Hell not!
Your father did what?
Altered S-11's neural implants, disrupting serotonin levels.
Making it more aggressive.
That explains all the random attacks.
You know what I gave up to be my dad's perfect little scientist?
Now he goes and does this behind my back.
Look, I'm sorry, Nicole.
What can I say?
He's my dad. I love him.
- (sonar pinging)
- Santos: Flynn.
It's the tracking device on my computer. S-11's near.
Do you mind telling us the plan?
We've been one step behind that freak all day.
Time to cut it off.
You aren't gonna believe this.
What?
You're finally ready to admit you're attracted to me?
Thank God.
The sexual tension was unbearable.
Ew! Gross. God.
- You?
- All right, easy.
A simple no would've sufficed.
The captain has feelings, you know?
All right, Jack, there has been another sighting of this creature.
And now supposedly CNE is running footage of it.
Really? Wow.
- How gullible do you think I am?
- Look, this isn't a joke, I swear.
Just, please, warn the audience.
- Okay, I'll warn them.
- (music turns off)
Attention all hands.
This is your captain speaking.
We're getting more reports about this half shark, half octopus creature that's terrorizing the coast, but please do not panic.
There is a way we can stop this thing.
Virgin sacrifices.
Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin, preferably 18 to 25 years old.
I repeat... sharktopus wants our virgins.
So all prospective candidates, please email your photos, preferably nudes, to Captain Jack at pvpirateradio. Com.
I wish there was another way.
I'm sorry.
This is our only hope.
Damn you, sharktopus!
Oh, what?
Don't look at me like that.
Oh!
How can you live with yourself?
- You're not punking me on this thing?
- No.
Stephie, this has to be a hoax, okay?
It's gotta be.
There's no way a shark-octopus fishy thingy really exists.
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Trust me, okay?
There is no such thing as a sharktopus.
- (thuds)
- Gotta love these Mexican roads.
Where are we?
Please, just keep your eyes on the road.
Shame on you if you kill us before sharktopus does.
Honey, why don't we go back to the resort?
Not until I hook a fish.
You still worried about that shark we saw?
It wasn't a shark.
Look, babe, relax.
It's a big ocean.
No matter what it was, we're not gonna see it again.
What are we doing here?
- We're two miles off the last signal.
- Check your map.
You'll notice the distance between
S-11's attacks are nearly equal.
How did you figure this out?
Back at Los Arcos
I wasn't sure.
And now you are?
Nope, but I'm sick and tired of chasing the freak around all day.
So if I'm right, it'll come to us.
You're in no condition for diving.
Wasn't planning on it.
We can lure S-11 to the surface without using the tranqs.
And how do we do that?
- Ugh!
- What?
You've never seen five gallons of fish guts before?
- (reel clicking)
- Whoa!
Come here.
Good!
Did you get a fish?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Got you.
I can't believe you bought that.
- Estupido.
- Oh, estupido? How about now?
- How about now, honey?
- No. No.
How about now, honey?
Huh? Huh? How about now?
Kevin!
Kevin, where are you?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin, where are you?
Kevin! Oh my God.
- Kevin!
- (S-11 growls)
Flynn.
Over there.
Get us over there.
No, the chum's working.
S-11's coming to us.
Nicole: S-11 has gone off the grid.
The software is glitching.
Damn, lost the signal.
- No.
- Santos!
Nicole: Santos!
- Santos!
- Help me!
- Flynn: I got you, buddy.
- Santos, hold on. Don't let go.
- (S-11 growls)
- Santos: Flynn!
Nicole: Hold on!
Santos:
Flynn! Shoot it, Flynn!
- Damn you, you freak.
- Shoot it with a dart.
- Shoot it with a dart.
- I can't, it's jammed. Don't let go.
Don't let go. Don't let go.
Don't let go.
- Don't let...
- (groaning)
- No!
- Santos!
- (Santos screams)
- Flynn: No!
Santos!
No!
Andy.
It knew we were setting up an ambush.
It knew.
What are you doing?
What I should've done from the beginning.
Take the wheel.
Get that.
- (shouting)
- Right.
Where is it?
I don't know.
It was right in front of us.
Check the trace.
Whoa!
You okay?
Yeah.
Andy, look.
It's heading for the resort.
Great.
It must've damaged the propellers.
No no, damn it!
Nicole, what's happening?
S-11 just killed Santos.
It's moving ashore.
- Has it been harmed?
- What?
Has S-11 been harmed?
Listen to me, you arrogant bastard.
Santos was my best friend, all right?
Emotion is blinding, Mr. Flynn.
This is bigger than Santos.
It's bigger than you.
Yeah, I'll think about that when
I'm drowning your freak in bullets.
I have $1 million that says you won't do that.
One million to bring S-11 back to me.
What do you say?
What do you say?
- Keep your money.
- (hangs up)
Sir, we've got Commander Cox on the satellite link again.
Uh... patch him in.
What's the news, Sands?
Did you catch our fish yet?
It's my fish.
- And we're closing in on it.
- Not good enough.
You need to bag that thing now.
If you can't do it,
I'll send a team in to terminate it.
- Shut up.
- It can be there in an hour, turn that freak of yours into chowder and leave no sign it ever existed.
Shut up!
- Sands. Sands!
- Cut him off. Cut him off!
- What's going on?
- Son of a bitch.
- Find a place to dock this thing.
- Sir?
Move. Contact Briggs.
Tell him to get a car ready.
Go!
Flynn: The engine's toast.
That's all she's got left.
Come on. Come on, baby.
You can make it.
Andy, wait. Talk to me.
I am done talking.
- (dance music playing)
- Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Puerto Vallarta Dancers.
Tell me we can find them.
Yes sir. We're tracking the GPS in your daughter's computer.
Honestly, Mr. Sands, I don't think that's gonna be enough to stop S-11.
It's not for S-11.
Which way?
- Woman: Oh my God.
- That's great.
- Is that part of the show?
- I don't know.
- Cool, Dad. Look.
- Oh my God!
- Oh man!
- (screaming)
That way.
Dude, that's awesome.
- (screaming)
- Move. Move!
- Eat this, you bastard.
- (gunfire)
You can't hide.
I'll find you.
- Damn it.
- Where does this channel lead?
Where are you going?
I might be able to head it off before it reaches the river.
Okay, if S-11 wants upriver it has to pass by here.
Check the trace.
Come on, come on.
There's no signal.
Damn it.
What about them?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, everyone.
There's a killer shark-octopus hybrid headed this way.
So please leave the marina in a timely fashion.
- What are you talking about? No.
- No?
- Okay, how about this?
- (gunfire)
- You enjoyed that way too much.
- It worked, didn't it?
Mr. Flynn!
Tell me, Mr. Flynn, when did you become such a people person?
Dad, what are you doing?
Last chance for you to reconsider my offer.
Or what?
Your boys gonna shoot me down?
What's your life compared to a miracle of science?
- Dad, don't do this.
- Baby girl, my SUV's in the parking lot.
Go wait for me there.
No.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
Andy's right.
S-11 needs to be put down.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- S-11's a crime against nature.
- We went too far.
- It can be controlled, baby.
You know that.
At what price?
How many more lives are you gonna sacrifice?
What about my life?
Oh, baby.
S-11 is my creation.
Mine.
I dedicated my entire life to it.
I will not allow anyone to destroy it.
Not even you.
- What?
- Dad, it's here.
- Come on!
- (S-11 bellows)
No. No!
- (Sands grunts)
- Dad!
Nicole:
Oh my God! No!
No, Dad! Help me!
- No! Dad!
- Nicole!
No no!
- Nicole, no.
- Help me!
- Dad, be careful. No!
- (gunshots)
Dad!
Nicole: No!
Dad!
- (gagging) Nicole.
- Dad!
- Nicole. Nicole.
- Dad.
- Kill... kill swi... kill swi...
- What?
- Dad.
- You can still...
What?
I love you, pumpkin.
No.
I'm sorry, Nicole.
I've gotta go after it.
Someone will come for you.
Andy, wait.
- This is the place.
- You said that the last three stops.
This map is useless.
We should call it quits for today.
We call it quits when I say we call it quits.
Hey, it's the guy from the speedboat.
The one following the sharktopus.
Come on.
The river narrows a few miles south, so we just need to get a pair of wheels.
All right.
I'm Stacy Everheart with CNE.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Get out of my face, lady.
What connection do you have to the creature known as the sharktopus?
Are you employed by the Blue Water Corporation?
You got a car?
- Yeah.
- Gimme the keys.
You're going after that thing, aren't you?
Take me with you, and you can use my van.
- No.
- Then have fun walking.
Gotta love Mexican roads, huh?
What are you planning?
The river bottlenecks upstream.
I'll cut it off there.
- What about my story?
- No names, no interviews.
Then what the hell do I get?
Exclusive footage of sharktopus getting shot to hell.
Man: Hey!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Hey, guys.
Can I get you anything?
Are you finished?
Jack, be careful.
Not too close to the edge.
Whoo-hoo!
Mom! Mom!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Somebody please help me.
Woman:
Jack! Jack!
- Jack! Oh my God!
- (clamoring)
No! Jack!
Oh my God.
Jack!
Looks like we're late to the party.
Great, I've got no bullets left and we're out of grenades.
- You could use this.
- Nicole, we're past that.
Wait. Hear me out.
S-11 has a kill switch... explosives laced into its neural implants.
But the switch became inoperable when S-11's bioware was damaged.
Then what good is it?
My dad...
I think he was trying to tell me something.
I think I can access the kill switch with my computer.
- Bones. Bones.
- What?
I think it's over there.
Come on, let's go.
But only if we establish a link with the interface dart.
We're gonna blow up
S-11's brains, but we can only establish a link if we get close enough to the interface dart and S-11.
Okay.
So in other words, what you're trying to say is that I've gotta tag that mother with an interface dart and you've gotta be close enough to blow it to hell?
Yeah, that's the plan.
Better than no plan.
Please help me find my son.
He's missing!
Calm down.
What's his name?
Mom!
- I got him. Stay here.
- He'll be fine. Just calm down, okay?
Please.
I cannot believe that you didn't get that shot.
I am sick of your attitude.
You know what?
I'm tired about you.
I'm tired about the work.
Just go on your way and I'm going on my way.
- Fine.
- Boy: Mom!
Jack. Jack, come here.
Come to me, buddy. It's okay.
Come on.
Trust me, it's okay.
Jack, come on.
Come to me. It's all right.
Give me your hand.
There you go. There you go.
Yeah, let's go, buddy.
I got you.
Yeah.
Yeah, come here.
I got you.
I got you. Let's go.
(crying) Jack!
Here. It's the last one so you better not miss.
I've been missing all day and I'm getting tired of it.
Now go over there.
It'll be safer.
No, I'm staying with you.
Nicole, go over there and get your mojo ready.
I'm gonna draw it to you.
Go!
Bones!
Bones, where the hell are you?
God.
Oh my God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Oh my God!
Got you, you mother.
Whoa!
Nicole!
Nicole, hurry!
Nicole!
I got it.
Anytime now, Nicole.
Oh, Dad, what did you do?
I hope you choke on me, you freak.
Come on!
Oh my God.
Hold on.
Oh, Dad.
Nicole!
Okay, I got it.
Oh my God.
Nicole:
Impressive. You need help?
I'll live.
That thing better not jump out at us again.
No, that only happens in the movies.
Yeah.

Melancholy of Lars Von Trier
Part 1 JUSTINE
Sir...
You can back up a little more if you want...
I think you need that extra...
I don't think he can hear you.
Sir, can you hear me up there?
Can you copy, sailor?
I think he's in a different county...
It's like five feet.
And now he stops. He's got five feet here.
That's good. Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Wait, wait, wait!
You're a little close.
I think he can keep going a little bit, maybe.
Oh, no, no, no.
He can't. I don't...
Be careful, please. It is not my car.
I will.
I promise.
Turn around to the left, please.
Stop there, sir.
Straighten up, sir.
Yeah, I think I'm good there, right?
You're not even looking.
I can see it's not looking good.
I'm a very experienced driver...
It's like really close on that side.
Really?
Yeah, don't go any further forward. Just straight...
How do I put it in...?
What?
This way?
Get out of the way.
Come on.
Sorry.
Yes, I know.
We're sorry.
I won't even bother saying how late you are.
Sorry. We're really sorry.
Hi.
Hi, Claire. So sorry.
Hi.
We probably should have taken something smaller.
This brilliant idea was yours of renting a stretch.
This is very much not my project, okay?
I spent the whole week with the dullest man on earth.
Not to mention the most expensive wedding planner on the planet.
Okay, so you want this?
Yeah, of course.
So, when you're there... and that was two hours ago.
Okay.
All right, let's go.
What star is that?
I don't know.
John, you're a bit of an expert on stars, aren't you?
I wouldn't say that.
Oh, yes you would.
Which one are you looking at exactly?
The red one.
I'm amazed you can see that.
That's Antares. It's the main star in the
Scorpio constellation.
Justine...
We just have to go to the stables to say hello to Abraham.
No, you're not.
Oh, yes.
Who's Abraham?
Abraham.
Look, I'm married.
Michael's my husband now.
I'm sure you two will like each other.
Nice to meet you.
I'm his mistress. I'm the only one who can ride him.
That's not exactly true.
What? Occasionally I take her for a ride.
See you later.
I can no longer be silent.
All the guests are waiting for more than two hours.
I know.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Welcome to the reception of Mr. Steinam, Mr. Marko.
Thank you.
Thank you, Little Father.
Would you be so good as to to participate in the wedding bean lottery?
Of course.
Please submit your bid as to the total number of beans in the bottle.
Yes, er... two million and six beans.
Two million and six beans.
Would you care to make a bid on behalf of your wife?
Oh, I don't dare to do that.
I really don't.
Very well, we'll let madam's bid remain open.
We made it.
Hi, Mom.
Love that dress.
Congratulations Aunt Steelbreaker.
Thanks, Leo.
What's this?
A dagger.
Wow!
Sweetheart.
Let me introduce you.
This is Betty... and Betty.
Betty and Betty, this is my daughter, Justine.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm gonna say hi to everybody.
Of course, of course.
Ladies and gentlemen...
We waited a while for this.
A toast to the bride and the groom.
Justine and Michael.
The tray must go left to right...
From left to right.
Justine, I don't want to make a speech.
Why? Please.
What are you doing?
You'll see.
Excuse me.
Neither of the ladies sitting next to me has been given a spoon.
I'd like very much to have one.
Excuse me.
You're terrible.
Waiter.
Justine, would you mind slapping your father for me hard, please.
Tim.
Justine, listen up, goddammit.
As most of you know,
I'm here tonight playing sort of a double role.
On Michael's side, I'm best man.
And, coincidentally, I'm also the employer of the bride.
I've got nothing bad to say about the groom, but...
The bride...
Justine...
Gorgeous woman...
Where's my tagline?
You were always great in coming up with a tagline in a hurry.
What happened?
Did your emotional life suddenly take over?
Did finding the man of your life render you unable to work?
I'm just asking because if I were to choose between a woman for my dear friend Michael and an employee...
I would always choose the employee.
Advertising, Justine, advertising.
Justine, you were way, way, way too good for advertising.
You know it, I know it, we all know it.
So thank you for staying with it.
I'm gonna let you and the rest of you think about this tagline now while I leak a bit of news.
Today the company hasn't lost a copywriter...
The company has gained a new art director.
And that's you, Justine.
Congratulations.
Goddammit, you earned it.
The father of the bride wants a word.
My dear girl, you look... glowing today.
And me, I'm just a little confused what with all the Bettys at my table.
Never seen you look so happy.
So, what can say without talking about your mother?
My wife of yesteryear.
Which is exactly what I don't wish to do.
I don't think that I would be revealing any secret if I were to say that she can be very domineering at times.
Domineering?
What a load of crap!
For those who don't know who I am,
I'm Claire and Justine's mother.
Justine, if you have any ambition at all, it certainly doesn't come from your father's side of the family.
Yes.
I wasn't at the church. I don't believe in marriage.
Claire, whom I have always taken for a sensible girl, you've arranged a spectacular party.
Till death do us part and forever and ever...
Justine and Michael.
I just have one thing to say...
Enjoy it while it lasts.
I myself hate marriages.
Gaby, please.
Especially when they involve my closest family members.
Why did you even bother coming?
Justine, come with me.
Listen to me. We agreed that you weren't going to make any scenes tonight.
The don't want any scenes.
No, we don't!
No.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
But I didn't do anything.
You know what I mean.
Okay.
Okay.
Katherine has demanded the floor.
Where is the bride?
I've looked everywhere, no bride.
Now the groom is going to give a speech for the bride.
Dear Justine...
What are you doing to me?
I've never given a speech before.
I'm serious, I've never given a speech before.
Justine is the speaker.
She can say the most wonderful things, but...
Then let her make the speech, damn it.
Justine...
I love you so much...
And never dreamed that I would have such a gorgeous wife.
I believe that I'm the luckiest man on Earth.
I love you.
That's kind of it. That's all I have.
Hello, everyone, we're going to move to the living room so that we can clear some tables.
Then the newlyweds will dance.
And then, at eleven thirty, the bride and groom will cut the cake in here.
He wants to be put to bed.
Sweety, you did so good.
I wanna do it.
No, tonight's your night.
No, please.
Are you sure?
Yeah, come on.
Good night, sweetheart.
Come on, come here.
Are you comfortable?
When are we gonna build caves together?
We're gonna build lots of caves together.
Just not  tonight.
You're still my aunt Steelbreaker, aren't you?
Yes. It's exactly who I am.
Justine...
Hi, Claire.
I'm just taking a little nap.
Don't nap, it's your wedding.
You're not even halfway through yet.
No. you're right.
I have to pull myself together.
What's going on, Justine?
I'm trudging in through this...
Praying really hard.
It's clinging to my legs.
It's really heavy to drag along.
No, you're not.
I know you'll hate to hear it.
Don't say a word to Michael.
You think I'm stupid?
I'll get her.
And my mom, too.
Yeah.
Justine, It's John.
We're ready to cut the cake, sweetheart.
Please come downstairs as soon as you can, okay?
Gaby...
Gaby...
Gaby, I'm sorry to disturb you, but we're ready to cut the cake.
When Justine took her first crap on her potty,
I wasn't there.
When she had her first sexual intercourse,
I wasn't there.
So give me a break, please, with all your fucking rituals.
Unbelievable, fucking unbelievable.
Everyone, thank you for being so patient.
We're just having a little issue with the wedding dress.
She'll be right down.
Those bitches have locked themselves in their bedrooms and now they're taking a bath.
Is everybody in your family stark raving mad?
This is embarrassing.
I know.
We should have put showers in the guest wing.
I've said it a hundred times.
For fuck's sakes, if people want to linger in a bath, stay at home.
Here we offer you an 18 hole golf course, where else would they get that?
Nowhere.
Unbelievable!
That's it, she's out.
What, Justine?
Your mother.
Unbelievable.
She ruined my wedding. I will not look at her.
Outstanding.
My God, we cut it.
I'm sorry.
No, don't say that.
You should never say you're sorry.
I can see that you're not feeling well tonight.
You should have seen you weren't ready yesterday.
I haven't been taking care of you lately.
It's my fault.
Can we talk somewhere?
Of course.
Sit down, please.
I wasn't going to give you this until tomorrow.
I found our plot of land.
They call it Empire apples.
They're bright red and very sweet.
But with the perfect tartness.
I had one as a kid.
Beautiful, huh?
In ten years' time, when the trees have grown you can sit in the shade, in a chair.
If you still have days when you're feeling a little sad...
I think that will make you happy again.
It's very sweet.
Yeah?
No wonder you've been so busy.
I signed the deed for it yesterday,
I didn't want to tell you.
Here.
No, you should have it,
I want you to have it with you all the time and hold on to it.
So you can look at it once in a while.
I'll always keep with me.
Maybe we can have a little swing hanging from one of the trees.
We'll talk about that when the time comes.
Yeah, no... of course.
When the time comes.
Goodbye.
You'd better be goddamn happy.
Yes, I should be.
I really should be.
Do you have any idea how much this party cost me?
A ballpark figure?
No.
I don't.
Should I?
Yes, I think you should.
A great deal of money.
A huge amount of money.
In fact, for most people, an arm and a leg.
I hope you feel it's well spent.
Well, that depends on whether or not we have a deal.
A deal?
Yes, a deal.
That you'll be happy.
Yes, of course. Of course we have a deal.
Good.
Congratulations.
I tried to throw your mother out.
Yes, you usually do.
Yes, I do.
Thank you.
It's a wonderful party you've given me.
How many holes are on our golf course?
Eighteen.
That's right.
Happy? Yeah.
This is the young man.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm Tim.
Hi, Tim.
Tim started working for us two days ago.
He happens to be my nephew, but ignore that.
Tim thought I wouldn't be able to squeeze that tagline out of you tonight.
I thought it might be difficult.
You're colleagues. I hired him the moment I heard about his education.
What education is perfect if you want to make it in Public Relations?
Tim?
None at all, of course.
It was almost too perfect.
He knows nothing. I hired him on the spot.
And at a very good salary. What do you say, Tim?
A very good salary.
Welcome, then, Tim.
There's just a slight catch to a very good job with a very good salary.
The salary is very good.
Why, what are you pushing Tim into doing?
To get that damn tagline out of you tonight.
Otherwise he's out on his ear, which sucks, considering the debts he's in.
Goodbye.
Once you give her a job, she won't let go.
You gotta be there at the time of birth, so you follow her now.
I mean, get that tagline.
Do let me know if the tagline's there and I'll jot it down.
Spare me.
I'll go out for a minute.
I'm really sorry.
I'm thrilled about this wedding and I know it's costing John a lot of money.
John's filthy mouth...
He needs to shut up about it.
It 's not about the cost.
It's just that I thought you really wanted this.
But I do.
Michael has tried to get through to you all evening to no avail.
That's not true.
I smile and smile and smile...
You're lying to all of us.
Don't you miss this?
What do you want in this place?
You've no business here.
Nor have I.
Your sister, it seems, is somewhat bewitched by you.
Mom...
I'm a bit scared.
A bit?
I'd be scared out of my wits if I were you.
No, it's something else, I...
I'm frightened, Mom.
I have trouble walking properly.
You can still wobble, I see.
So just wobble the hell out of here.
Stop dreaming, Justine.
I'm scared.
We all are, sweetie.
Just forget it. Get the hell out of here.
No, thanks.
Everybody, excuse me.
Could you all follow us outside, please.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Another glass, please.
Are you really called Betty?
No sir, sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Dad, can we talk?
Could you sit with me for a little while?
Wait. What?
Wait.
Get out of me.
Michael, can you give me a moment?
What's happened?
Just give me a moment, please.
What's happened?
Can I have a moment, please?
Yeah... of course.
Can you zip me?
Are you okay?
Okay.
Hi.
Good night. Have a good time.
I'm on my way home, my darling.
Please, Dad, I really need to talk to you.
Little Father...
My dad would like to spend the night.
Is there a room available?
Room number eight is vacant.
We could prepare that for your father.
Well ..
Yes, my father likes that.
Then we can have breakfast in the morning.
Justine...
Why don't you come and have onion soup with us?
Tim. Get us some soup.
How's your wonderful night going?
It's too bad about Tim.
What about Tim?
He got fired.
He didn't last many hours in the business, but... then again, it's a rather unpredictable one, you're king one day and beggar the next.
So you go back to wherever you came from, right buddy?
I'm glad we found each other, Jack.
I was looking for you.
Didn't I tell you? She can't stop working, not even on your wedding night.
I had nothing at the dinner...
But I've been playing with an idea for a small campaign.
The problem is, how do we effectively hook a group of minors on our substandard product, preferably in a habit-forming way?
And I've reached a conclusion in regards to the tagline.
I was just thinking, what if... instead... we try to sell you to the public, Jack?
Then, surprisingly,
I arrived right back where I started from.
At nothing.
Nothing? It's not such a bad tagline, Jack.
Would my newly fledged aide please expand a little on the thoughts of the tagline?
Nothing is too much for you, Jack.
I hate you and your firm so deeply
I couldn't find the words to describe it.
You are a despicable, power-hungry little man, Jack.
Is that a resignation?
'Cause there aren't too many jobs out there,
I tell you.
I broke my plate.
So I...
I guess we'll... take off now.
Yes.
This could have been a lot different.
Yes, Michael, that have been.
But, Michael... what did you expect?
Yeah.
You're right.
Claire...
Sometimes, I hate you so much.
The way I see it, you're now short of a boss and a husband.
Could I, in all my humility, offer my services?
You have the ideas, I have the head for business.
We could be the perfect couple.
We've had good sex.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
No.
No.
Excuse me, the result is ready.
What?
The number of beans in the bottle has been arrived at.
And?
Six hundred and seventy-eight.
That's the final count.
Six hundred and seventy-eight?
And none of the guests got it right.
Really?
Some were pretty close, but no one guessed right.
Incredible.
You could say that.
Incredibly trivial.
But that's the result of the competition.
And a lot of people would like to know the result.
And then there is the prize.
Throw it away.
Dad...
To my beloved daughter, Betty.
I'm as proud of you as any father could be.
But I couldn't find you and I was offered a ride home
I couldn't refuse.
See you soon. Kisses from your stupid dad.
Justine, wake up.
Wake up.
We're going for a ride.
I tried, Claire.
Yes, you did.
You really did.
Come on.
Come on, Abraham, come.
Come on, lets go. Come on!
The red star is missing from Scorpio.
Antares is no longer there.
Part 2 CLAIRE
I swear to God, your sister can't do anything by herself.
Hello, darling. How are you?
Just do as I've told you.
There's a taxi down the street waiting for you.
I already told her that.
Just open the door, and get in.
Unbelievable.
Just get in the cab, darling.
Well, then call me back if you can't make it to the cab.
We'll pay for it when you arrive.
Don't worry about it.
We'll see about that.
I love you, darling.
Please, John, she's my sister.
Oh, please!
She's a bad influence on you and Leo.
She's ill.
Right.
Have you been going online again?
Claire, you promised.
I'm afraid of that stupid planet.
That stupid planet?
That wonderful planet, you mean.
First it was black, now it's blue.
Blocking Antares, hiding behind the sun.
Darling, this is going to be the most amazing experience we will have in our lives.
It won't be here in five days, and it is not going to hit us.
Just like it didn't hit Mercury, as we knew it wouldn't.
And it didn't hit Venus, as we well knew it wouldn't.
And it won't hit Earth, as we know it won't.
Claire, look at me.
Sweetheart, you have to trust a scientist.
They say that it will hit...
No they don't, that's not true.
Not the real scientists.
Now, the prophets of doom they'll write whatever they can to get attract attention.
But the real scientists, all of them agree.
Melancholy is just gonna pass right in front of us.
And it's gonna be the most beautiful sight ever.
Now, I wish you'd watch it through the telescope with me.
Please.
No, I'd better not.
Son of a bitch.
When are we going to build those caves,
Aunt Steelbreaker?
Sweetheart, not right now.
We're gonna do that in a little while.
Okay?
She's still sleeping.
Yes, but she has to get up now.
What are you making?
Meatloaf.
Meatloaf?
Yeah.
If that's doesn't get her out of bed, nothing will.
Time to wake up, Justine. No more sleeping.
Going to take you to a nice bath.
How would you like that? Come on.
You 'll see you'll like it.
I promise. Come on.
I'll wash you, okay?
Just lift your foot.
Go on.
Lift your foot.
You need a bath.
You need to wash. Right?
I'm so tired...
Come on, try.
I can not.
Justine, you'll like it.
See?
It's nice, it's a nice bath.
Justine... Please.
Okay, so...
We've practiced for tomorrow.
And I have a surprise for you for dinner.
Can you smell it?
Meatloaf?
Surprise!
It tastes like ashes.
It's all right, sis.
Auntie  Steelbreaker's crying.
Don't worry, son.
Do you want to go back up?
May I be excused?
Take one more bite.
Look.
It's a planet that has been hiding behind the sun.
And now it passes by us.
It's called a Fly by.
It's not something you need to frighten aunt Steelbreaker with now.
If you think I'm afraid of a planet, then you're too stupid.
Just a few things we're gonna need in case of Melancholy gets really close.
Look, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't mention this to Claire.
She gets anxious so easily.
Come on, Justine.
Take it. That's it.
Come on, Justine, take him out.
Justine, take him out!
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Don't beat him!
Come on!
Justine, don't beat him!
Stop.
There it is.
There's your Fly by.
You don't touch the instrument.
Come on Leo.
Look.
Our son has invented a very fine device.
If you adjust the steel and point it towards the planet from your chest it'll tell you how fast it's approaching and ultimately how fast it will recede.
Okay.
Leo...
What are we excited about?
Tomorrow night.
That's right.
Wow, that's amazing.
Amazing isn't it?
Let me look.
Earth & Melancholia
Dance of Death
John!
John!
Coming.
We're prepared for this. The power will be back on in a few days.
Claire...
Tomorrow evening Melancholy will pass us by and you'll never have to see it again, okay?
So it won't hit us?
Not a chance.
What if your scientists have miscalculated and...
They haven't.
You promise?
Of course I do.
I promise.
It's rising again.
Just like the moon.
Because of the Earth's rotation.
Exactly like they said it would.
Are you hungry?  No, thanks.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Do you plan to kill us all?
Maybe I should take those.
Don't touch them.
Don't you touch them.
Justine, come and have a bath.
I've had a bath.
Really?
Yes, I'm very clean.
Little Father didn't come to work.
I checked the noteboard.
He didn't leave one.
I tried to call him, but maybe something's wrong with the phone.
You see, it's never happened before that he didn't come to work without giving us notice.
Does he have a family?
He lives in the village...
I do not know if he has a family.
Maybe this is a time when he needs to be with them.
It'll pass us by tonight.
John is quite calm about it.
Does that calm you down?
Yes, of course.
Well, John studies things. He always has.
The earth is evil.
We don't need to grieve for it.
What?
Nobody will miss it.
But where would Leo grow up?
All I know is...
Life on earth is evil.
There may be life somewhere else.
No, there isn't.
How do you know?
Because I know things.
Oh, yes, you always imagine, you did.
I know we're alone.
I don't think you know that at all.
Six hundred and seventy-eight.
The bean lottery.
Nobody guessed the amount of beans in the bottle.
No, that's right.
But I know.
Six hundred and seventy-eight.
Well, perhaps...
What does that prove?
That I know things.
And when I say we're alone...
We're alone.
Life exists only on Earth.
And not for long.
I can stay up all evening till the middle of the night... when we get to see the planet fly by, and I get to look at the telescope.
Yes, of course, darling.
But are you sure you can stay up that late?
You haven't slept much lately.
Yes, I can.
Can't I, Auntie Steelbreaker?
Can't I?
Yes, you can. Of course you can.
It's eleven. It's almost here.
Leo, sweetheart.
It's time to wake up.
Leo.
Leo.
There.
Leo should be watching this.
My God.
There.
Take a look.
Are you afraid?
No, it looks...
It looks friendly.
Yes.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
My God.
I'd like to raise a toast.
To life.
To life? What do you mean, to life?
You said it was going to be okay.
There was no sense in alarming everybody.
So, you're saying that our lives were in danger?
No, I was saying...
No, I'm saying that when dealing with science and calculations of this magnitude... you have to account for a margin of error.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm sorry.
It's not fun any more.
Actually it's moving away from us as we speak.
You just can't see it through the naked eye.
Come here.
Put this to your chest.
Aim it up at the planet.
Hold on.
Is that right?
Yes.
In five minutes... it'll be smaller.
I can't breathe.
Just relax, relax.
This is normal. It's taking part of our atmosphere.
For a little while, it's gonna make us winded.
Just try and breathe calmly.
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
There you go.
Just try to breathe calmly.
There you go.
Please, can I look now?
Of course.
It's smaller.
Of course it is.
It's smaller! It's smaller!
Sure. Of course it is.
It's moving away from us at over sixty thousand miles an hour.
For heaven's sake...
Come here.
Mom...
We have to stay up...
I wanna look through the telescope...
Breathe calmly.
Be happy, please.
If I dare, you can do it.
I'm happy you're happy.
You have it easy, don't you?
I imagined the worst thing possible.
That's right, Claire.
Sometimes it's easy being me.
Hi, darling.
Do you want tea?
No, thank you.
Something to drink?
John!
John!
John!
John.
John.
John.
John!
I can't find John. Do you know where he is?
No.
I was just listening.
There's something different.
The horses... They've come down.
John...
Good morning, Mom.
Get a blanket.
Justine, breakfast.
Where's John?
He rode to the village.
Why didn't he just take the car?
Abraham needed a ride.
Since you never ride him.
Come with me.
Justine...
Come!
Claire...
Claire. Dammit... what...?
Claire.
Where are you going?
To the village. Come.
This has nothing to do with the village.
Get in!
I want us to be together when it happens.
Outside on the terrace.
Help me, Justine.
I want to do this the right way.
Better do it quickly.
A glass of wine together, maybe?
You want me to have a glass of wine on your terrace?
Yes, would you do it, sis?
How about a song?
Beethoven's Ninth...
Something like that?
Perhaps we could light some candles.
You just want us all to gather on your terrace sing a song and have a glass of wine... the three of us.
Yes, that would make me happy.
Do you know what I think of your plan?
No.
I only think that he might like it.
I think it's a piece of shit.
Justine, please...
I just wanted to be nice.
Nice?
Why don't we meet in the fucking toilet?
Then let's not.
You're damn right, let's not.
Sometimes I hate you so much, Justine.
I'm afraid that the planet will hit us, anyway.
Don't be... please.
Dad said there is nothing to do, then...
Nowhere to hide.
If your dad said that, then he's forgotten about something.
He's forgotten about the magic cave.
The magic cave...
Yep.
Is that something everybody can make?
Aunt Steelbreaker can.
All right, let's go find stick, all right?
Hold my hand.
Close your eyes.
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6. Return to base.
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.
You look pale. Everything okay?
Sean?
Sean?
Hey.
Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you.
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...
He's calling me three times a day.
I hear more from him now than I did when we were together.
What is it with guys?
I gave notice.
- Ticket?
- Notice?
May I see your ticket?
I, uh...
Hey. Hey.
You're acting a little strange this morning. You okay?
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
We're gonna try, sir.
Hey, Grandpa, what the heck was the delay back there?
I just punch the tickets, sir.
I should punch your face.
Sean? Did I do something?
Look, I can see that you think you know me, but I don't know who you are.
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Sean, that's...
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
I feel sick.
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey, mister!
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Thanks.
What is that?
Chicago.
All aboard.
Doors are closing.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
You okay there, Captain?
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Did you see that?
You're kind of freaking me out.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Are you all right?
I don't know what's going on.
Talk to me, Sean.
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.
We'll figure out whatever's going on here, okay?
This doesn't belong to me.
Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.
Captain
Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, do you copy?
Where am I?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?
Adjusting your rotation.
Can you report at this time?
What is this? What is this?
Where...
Who am I talking to?
Captain, report what you saw.
What? I don't understand.
Where were you before you were talking to me?
There was an explosion.
Coming from where?
Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage, Captain.
Do you have a visual signal?
Who are you?
You already have that information, Captain.
- I do?
- Recall my name.
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.
I...
I was on a mission.
I was flying, and then I woke up on a train.
And now I'm here.
I need to be briefed.
What unit is this?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Who?
Stand by for thread one of alpha memory pattern.
What is Beleaguered Castle?
The exercises will assist you.
Memory thread one.
Listen to the following passage.
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
"In her hand were five playing cards."
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,
"nine of clubs,
"three of hearts, nine of hearts."
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.
Thread two. The following is a recording of a Western Screech Owl.
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.
Acknowledge end of pattern.
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.
Go for pattern recall.
Arrange the five playing cards in order of descending value, irrespective of suit.
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.
The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name.
What was that name?
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.
Recall my name.
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified that I'm stateside?
Who bombed the train, Captain?
What?
Who bombed the train?
A woman kept calling me Sean.
That is incidental.
Think, Captain. Remember back.
Who bombed the train?
I don't know who bombed the goddamn train.
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?
You will have eight minutes, same as last time.
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?
I need to know where I am.
What is the location and condition of my crew?
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?
You are obligated to give me this information.
Start with the bomb.
Where is it? What does it look like?
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?
- Right.
- Find the bomb, and you will find the bomber.
Find the bomb. Wait, no, I...
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.
Okay. That's good.
And I signed up for an LSAT course.
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.
LSAT.
Know any good gurus?
She got your shoe.
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?
It's the same train, but it's different.
Deep.
I hope it's different. I feel the same way.
What?
- Do I have...
- Bryan.
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.
What is...
This looks so real.
I think it's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible.
Unbelievable detail.
Ticket? May I see your ticket?
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.
- Ticket?
- The distraction.
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?
Hey, Grandpa, what the hell was the delay back there?
- What are you late for?
- What?
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?
Yeah.
He is a comedian.
Sit down.
Freak.
Fans.
That's the guy.
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.
We talked about him.
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Glenbrook Station.
Yeah, but by 1:00 the bridge is gonna be jammed.
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
Just let me get it, okay?
Hey, mister!
Hey!
Hey! You dropped this.
Thanks.
All aboard.
Doors are closing.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
The explosion came from behind me.
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.
I got time for you.
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Holy shit.
Goodwin?
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?
Uh...
Should I...
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...
Okay, um...
I'm just gonna leave it.
Okay?
I'll be late.
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,
I need all of you to turn off any personal electronic devices until we pull into the station, okay?
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.
Thank you. It's just a precautionary measure. Nothing to worry about.
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?
Sir? Sir.
Is there a problem here, sir?
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?
- Sean?
- Turn it off.
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?
Hey!
Sean! What are you doing?
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.
That's not a good idea.
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.
He's not any more real than you are.
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?
Not gonna be a next time.
Stabilize.
Lower your pulse.
Did you find the bomb?
Yes.
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.
It's not a concern, Captain.
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.
That's irrelevant, Captain.
I want to talk to your commanding officer!
You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!
You've been with us for two months.
Did you ID the bomber?
No. Where's my unit?
And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.
What lives?
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?
I need to be briefed.
Sir, I need to give him something.
That's fine. Go ahead.
Okay.
Get ready to send him back in.
We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do all the profiles right now.
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time, a bomb exploded on a commuter train outside of Chicago, killing everyone on board.
And that's the train that you've been on.
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.
A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.
Every second spent explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk.
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.
Now, did you find the bomb?
In the restroom.
Ventilation panel above the sink.
Cell phone detonator.
Are we done?
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.
Good.
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion.
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train.
So, one of those calls was made by our bomber.
Do you remember a freight train passing by just before the explosion?
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train, which means the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made.
Fifty-two callers.
One of those is our bomber.
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car. Get to know them.
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn.
Who seem nervous.
As always, you will have eight minutes.
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?
Yes.
I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Charge the drivers.
Okay. Has my father even...
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
Watch it.
You're kind of quiet today.
Just got a lot on my mind.
Careful.
Yikes.
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Ticket?
That was very kind of you.
You're very decent.
Thank you.
You're real.
Ticket?
- How's everything today?
- It's good.
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.
I meant behavior on the train.
Does anything, anybody seem strange to you?
You're a little strange.
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?
Are you drunk or something?
Come here.
Come here for a second.
Come on.
Think of it as a game.
A game?
Wow.
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.
That's what's so terrifying about them.
Maybe there's a team at work.
The sleeping giant in cahoots with the minister and Denoff there.
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.
I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.
You're funny.
Damn it.
What about that guy?
Deposition.
What about the woman who's sitting across from him?
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.
You talk to these people more than I do.
Right, right. And the guy behind her, he's late for an audition, right?
That or a court appearance.
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI. I know.
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?
Uh-oh.
Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.
Did anyone else come out of that bathroom today?
Well,
I saw you coming out of there.
- Me?
- Yes.
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Me?
Hey, mister!
- Hey.
- Hold on.
Hold on a second. Just hold on a second.
There's gotta be something in here.
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.
A broken phone? What is this?
Glenbrook Station.
Christina?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey. Hey, come with me.
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.
You're kind of freaking me out.
I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I have a really bad feeling about this train, and I think that we should get off. Okay?
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.
Come on. Come with me.
So, what now?
Wait for me, right here.
I'll be right back.
- Your attention, please.
- Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...
Hey.
You ready to get that coffee now?
Sorry, yeah. Just one more second, okay?
Oh, for God's sake.
Feeling sick?
It's motion sickness.
I get it all the time.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?
No. I don't have one.
Sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.
You know, you have no right.
What are you doing? Give me my bag back!
Are you crazy?
- Where are they?
- Sean?
Get back!
Sean, what are you doing?
Sean, what's going on?
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?
Sean! Sean!
It wasn't you.
What the hell's wrong with you?
- No!
- Are you insane?
No! No! No!
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?
Get away from me, please!
Sean. Sean! Get up! Sean?
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!
- Sean! Sean!
- Give me your hand! Get off the track!
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!
Sean! Sean!
Cold.
Goodwin?
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy? Please respond.
It's freezing in here. What's going on?
What was that?
He's in trouble.
I think the oxygen just went out.
Goodwin?
Goodwin!
Find a way to get through to him.
What is it?
What's going on?
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.
- Sir?
- Please!
There's not a whole lot we can do from here.
If nothing changes, how much time does he have?
Some.
But not a lot.
There are four principal dialects of Arabic.
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese and North African.
We will now play you portions of each, discussing their differences.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
They were the queen of spades, the four of clubs...
Goodwin, you out there?
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?
This is Captain Stevens. Do you copy?
Captain Stevens?
The capsule lost power.
The capsule?
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?
You should know. Who are you?
Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.
You invented this thing, right?
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?
I am. Were you able to locate the information we need, Captain?
That's a negative, sir.
I was unable to find the bomber, but I did save a passenger on the train.
I got her off safely. A woman.
Captain? It's gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train.
They are outside the mission.
But she survived.
And maybe the rest could, too.
She survived, but only inside the source code.
None of them can be saved.
What is the source code?
It's quantum mechanics. Parabolic calculus.
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.
Fine.
When a light bulb is turned off, there's an after-glow, a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?
- Yes.
- Of course.
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged, just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.
Now, there's another peculiarity about the brain.
It contains a short-term memory track that's approximately eight minutes long.
Like a convenience store security camera that only records the last portion of the day's activity on its hard drive.
Now, in combining these two phenomena, circuitry that remains viable post-mortem and a memory bank that goes back eight minutes, source code enables us to capitalize on the overlap.
Sean Fentress died on that train.
Of all the passengers aboard, he was your best link.
You two share compatibility in terms of gender, body-size, and your synaptic maps.
What happens after the eight minutes?
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.
You cannot exist inside the source code beyond Fentress's eight minutes.
Source code is not time travel.
Rather, source code is time reassignment.
It gives us access to a parallel reality.
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy, but source code empowers us...
No, but I saved one person.
That girl that's always sitting across from me.
I pulled her off the train.
Give me her name.
Christina. I don't remember her last name.
Her name was Christina Warren.
- Yes.
- She was 28.
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.
Died this morning on the train.
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.
No, she isn't.
Believe me. She is.
Believe me!
She saw me get hit by the express train.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.
What second attack?
The train was just the beginning, a letter of intent.
What aren't you telling me here?
We have information that downtown Chicago is the next target, and they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.
Do you have any idea how many people would die if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?
We're evacuating as we speak.
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?
If you find the bomber, his second attack, the real attack, we think, can be prevented.
We have very little time left. Out here, the clocks only move in one direction.
Charge the drivers.
On the upper deck of the next carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.
It's a small office containing a strongbox.
Inside is a loaded handgun.
Get to it. You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
You're still here.
Of course I am.
Guess what?
You quit your job and you enrolled in an LSAT course.
Good guess.
Soda can.
Coffee spill.
Listen to me.
Don't answer this.
You deserve better than that guy.
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect, doesn't it?
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...
Not that well, apparently.
Do you know me well enough that if I did something that looked a little strange and was maybe even a little bit dangerous, but I told you to trust me anyway, that you could do that?
No.
Wow. That was honest.
You're beautiful. You're kind.
And you're painfully honest.
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?
It's the new me.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Ticket?
Glenbrook Station.
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat, all right? He's bleeding.
He needs medical attention.
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train's security box?
Careful, ma'am.
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?
What would you do if you only had a minute left to live?
I don't know.
I would call my dad.
I would hear his voice, and I'd tell him I was sorry.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox, that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.
Did you make any progress?
Can I get access to a phone?
I need to talk to my father.
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.
Goodwin, how am I doing?
I'm just trying to measure my performance here.
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?
We are wasting valuable time here.
No, no.
I have never been on the other side of a source code mission.
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?
CAOC-N. What is that?
Because the specifications are extremely narrow.
What are they?
Captain, you should have found a suspect by now.
This tactical advantage, this tremendous tool that we've given you, don't squander it thinking. Do.
Please contact my father for me.
This will stop at some point, Captain.
As soon as you finish the mission.
And you're doing really great.
And this will end.
Now, whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind.
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get into the overhead vent, flashlight, something.
Check bags and backpacks, briefcases, anything.
So, I took your advice.
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.
Were you in the military?
A friend of mine was.
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared, and no one's heard from him since.
Do you have the Internet on your phone?
No.
It's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string.
Do you think you can see what you could find on this guy?
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.
Okay. You owe me.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Why don't I get one for you now?
Okay. Christina?
Um...
I've been having these dreams lately.
Really vivid.
And you've been in them.
Really?
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...
It's just...
Um...
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.
For what?
Psych. And I got a big test this morning, so I should get back to it.
Can I borrow a pen?
Yeah, sure.
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!
Hey, your bag is a mess.
What are you doing, man?
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.
How about you let the guy have his bag back?
Finish your deal.
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.
This guy.
Don't do that.
Nothing. What am I doing?
Jesus.
Dick.
CAOC-N.
- Can you believe that?
- Asshole.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...
Then what was going on down there?
Oh, you know, uh...
We were just having a little bit of an argument, actually, about this patch.
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters, they look familiar to you?
Do you know what the "N" stands for?
It's Air Force, and the
"N" stands for Nellis.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.
All right. Thank you so much.
This is a Chicago-bound train.
Next stop, Chicago,
Union Station.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Post Operator.
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.
Name, please?
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.
- Hold the line.
- All aboard.
Doors are closing.
Dr. Rutledge will be on in a moment.
I have to tell you something.
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...
He's dead, Sean.
What?
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed in action two months ago.
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.
It was on the first site I tried.
His father's name is Donald, right?
This is from last week.
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss
"the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,
"who died in Afghanistan in February,
"and was honored posthumously with a silver star.
"Also on the broadcast will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."
I'm sorry.
Captain?
Sean? Talk to me.
Captain?
Captain Stevens, my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.
Hey, this guy's crashing!
- Captain, just tell me what you see.
- Just look and speak.
I see a card.
That's good.
- Do you copy?
- We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.
That's very good.
Am I dead?
A radio listing is saying that I died in a helicopter crash, in country, and my father received a medal for me.
Your condition's not the issue here.
You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attack.
Everything else is irrelevant.
A news report saying that I'm dead is irrelevant?
Until the person or persons who blew up that train are in custody, yes.
Goodwin, one soldier to another, am I dead?
Part of your brain remains activated.
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.
They still move.
They are a manifestation.
They're just your way of making sense of all this.
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?
I'm imagining that I'm still alive, that I'm in this capsule?
We have core temp dropping.
Captain, what just happened?
I asked you a question.
The capsule is a manifestation as well.
Where am I?
That's classified.
Fuck you!
Captain, I cannot imagine what you must be feeling right now.
But if we're to prevent a second attack, we need to send you back immediately.
And, Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission while inside the source code, even to investigate your...
Even to investigate what happened to you.
There's only one continuum on this end and it can't be unsettled.
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.
Just before the explosion, so at 7:46 this morning,
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train, but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.
If the call even went through, it would be received by a different me entirely.
This may be difficult for you to hear, but you are a hand on a clock, understand?
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.
And that represents the entirety of your function here.
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!
I'll see if that makes an impression!
You cannot alter the continuum of this reality from within the source code.
This can't be legal, what you're doing.
In fact, your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by military court.
Many soldiers would find this preferable to death.
The opportunity to continue serving their country.
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?
That's immaterial.
Any soldier I've ever served with would say that one death is service enough.
Fine. You can have that in return for completing this mission.
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.
Terminate your service. Let you die.
This is taking too long.
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.
I am certain we can find other servicemen with wounds similar to yours who would consider being a part of this program an honor.
What? No, wait, what?
Send him back.
Charge the drivers.
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you, but it's also about two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.
Your advice.
Hey, Grandpa.
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?
There are hundreds of people on that train.
Well, then check them out one by one.
It doesn't matter what you do to them.
They're already dead.
Get to that gun, and shoot someone if you have to.
But get us some usable intel.
No, wait!
We have to keep doing this until you find the bomber.
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.
Who is the bomber?
I'm trying.
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're exhausted, and we're all frustrated, but we cannot fail. You can do this.
I can't. I can't.
Yes, you can.
You're a born hero, son.
Even your father thinks so.
Saving people is what you do best.
It was about his third tour.
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?
I just started feeling like he didn't want to come home anymore.
- Dad?
- Like somehow, he couldn't come home.
And he wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't hear me.
Finally he said he just couldn't leave his unit out there without him, and that was that.
Those guys were his family.
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,
I never fully understood him.
And I can't believe he's gone.
Send me back in.
Please don't blow me up again.
Hello?
I know it's you.
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.
I'm gonna find you. Turn around.
- Hey, there.
- Me?
Why do you look so surprised?
Don't.
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.
- Okay.
- Move over.
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.
- You're done. You're done.
- What?
You can't kill anybody anymore.
What? I don't understand.
You were going to trigger the bomb with your phone.
What? Dude, I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.
Try it again.
Your call. Dial it again.
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.
Your phone is gonna ring, and then I'm gonna shoot you.
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Wow. Thanks.
Hey!
All aboard. Doors are closing.
Shit! No! No!
No!
Wait!
No! Come on!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Hey!
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?
- See this?
- Yes.
- You recognize it?
- No.
Jesus.
How about you give me your wallet?
Okay.
You left it on the train deliberately.
I must have dropped it.
No.
You planted it there, so everybody would think you were dead.
I know it's you.
How do you know so much?
What the hell is that thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!
Do you wanna see it?
Very patriotic.
Slowly, slowly!
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Not many people could build that.
All right. Where is your next target?
Sean?
Oh, my God!
Sean Fentress?
Teacher.
History.
I don't know you.
I think I killed your girlfriend.
Why?
You messed up my timing.
- Why?
- Oh.
You mean "Why this?"
Because the world is hell.
But we have a chance to start over in the rubble.
But first there has to be rubble.
You're a teacher, you understand.
Christina.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
This isn't the end.
Check through there.
I'll go check this way.
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
I have your bomber. I have his name.
You have the bomber's name?
Derek Frost.
He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.
All right, let's move.
And Goodwin, there is a radioactive device in the van.
Some kind of bomb.
Thank you, Captain.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.
About our deal?
I had hoped that you might reconsider that, for the sake of the program.
I have. I want something else now.
Good.
I still wanna die.
But I want to go back in and I wanna save all those people on that train first.
It doesn't work that way. It can't.
No, I know. I know, I know.
I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir. I'm just...
I'm asking you to have the decency to let me try.
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.
Van is approaching fence gate to the quarry. Over.
- Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
- Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.
We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.
AU SWAT-2, roger that.
We're going to switch now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate.
The SWAT team is approaching the white van.
The Illinois man has been sought since early this morning.
The door is open and the man is on the ground.
It appears he has surrendered.
Earlier today, the police discovered...
Congratulations, Captain.
In recent months, Frost started posting anti-government statements on his website.
Yes, sir, it's a real validation of the program.
A clear window into just how revolutionary source code can be.
We finally have a powerful weapon now in the war on terror.
Congratulations, Captain. A job well done.
He's not gonna send me back in, is he, Goodwin?
I'm still waiting on an answer.
Are you married, Captain?
Um...
Joe?
Why don't you go take a break?
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.
Can I get you something?
No, I'm fine.
Why? Are you asking me on a date?
Sorry. Poor taste.
- Are you married?
- Hmm?
No.
I am divorced.
Do you think there's an alternate version of you?
A Goodwin who made different choices?
What do you mean?
Like, a you who didn't get married and get divorced.
Or just married someone else.
A woman who took a different fork in the road.
No, I don't, Captain.
What you experienced was a shadow.
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.
This is real life. Here.
The one where you're talking to a dead helicopter pilot?
The program wasn't designed to alter the past.
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.
I missed something, Captain.
That train shouldn't have blown up.
There must have been a second detonator, something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.
It's a computer program, Captain.
The girl on the train, all the others, they're lost.
I'm sorry about that.
I get it. I get it.
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.
You're wrong, Goodwin.
You're just plain wrong.
Captain, Christina is dead.
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.
I'm asking you,
I'm asking you. Just...
Send me...
Captain.
It's your choice.
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.
There will be no coming back.
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.
It was an honor, Captain.
And I thank you for your service.
Good luck.
I took your advice.
You're gonna move to India, and become a guru.
Careful, ma'am.
Yeah, I'm gonna go find myself in the mountains.
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee with me before you go.
Yeah. I'd like to do that.
Put it to the test.
Good.
Let's do it today.
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.
- You know what?
- What?
I feel really good.
Why?
Because I've been waiting for weeks for you to ask me for coffee.
Ticket?
Okay.
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.
Gotta go save the world.
I knew he was a keeper.
Excuse me!
Beautiful day.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Ticket?
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.
Yeah, well, sure.
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...
Eight source code projects up and running by the end of the year.
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.
Well, thank you.
We did save lives today.
Yes, a true victory for the program.
A great victory for us all.
We'll talk soon.
So? Exciting times.
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1, start crunching the data.
Sir, we told Captain Stevens that we were gonna let him die.
Let him die?
He just saved millions of lives today.
How many other disasters might he avert down the line?
For all we know, he may be the only candidate with which the system works.
So, let's clear his memory and reinitialize source code.
Shall we?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, I just dropped...
Hey, Derek! This isn't your stop.
Hey, mister!
You dropped this.
Come on back here.
Oops.
Derek, it's over.
You understand?
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.
I planted a nuclear device in a white van parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot.
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole on the 944 CCR train headed to Chicago Union Station.
I am a sick and pathetic human being.
And I need to be locked away for a very long time.
Okay.
Derek, there's no more burying the world in rubble today.
You mind if I borrow this?
Captain, some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate.
And...
Do you want me to initiate the memory wipe, Captain?
Hello, Captain.
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?
Yes?
My name is Sean Fentress.
Who?
I served with your son, Colter.
- Oh, boy.
- It's...
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what you want to say. You know?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.
How are you doing, sir?
Well, all that came back was some ash.
It's hard to believe that it was him.
How well did you know him?
I was there when he died, sir.
He said that the last time that you guys talked was tough, and he wanted to say that he was sorry.
I just want him back.
I loved him so much.
I wish you could have told him that.
He knows it.
You take care, Mr. Stevens.
You okay?
Yeah.
Save the world?
Sort of.
So, where were we?
Getting some coffee.
Dr. Rutledge.
What?
Shit.
- What's so damn hard about it?
- I run a business, okay?
Everything moves on time or people get fired.
That's the way it works in the real world.
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?
Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.
Thank you for that moment of Zen, but nobody was talking to you.
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here this instant!
Why are you always so bitter, Max?
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?
It doesn't have to be.
I will bet you $100 you can't make all these people on this train laugh.
...Oh. Right.
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.
Is that your way of making fun of me?
I guess you have a better gig. Never mind.
No, no. I'm good.
Easiest money ever.
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.
One of our fellow passengers has decided to offer me some money to...
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.
- It's the new me.
- I like it.
I am going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.
Women always mess up my last name.
I was with a girl the other night and she kept calling me "Getoff."
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."
She says,
"No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off!"
Good?
Twenty seconds.
Make it ten.
Goodwin?
Look at all this.
It's good to see you, ladies, up this early in the morning.
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.
All this life.
Goodwin. Open this door.
- Put those headphones on.
- I wanna see them stretch.
- Why do you keep looking at your watch?
- Christina, what would you do if you knew you had less than a minute to live?
I'd make those seconds count.
I'd kiss you again.
Again? Mmm.
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!
He's done enough, Doctor.
And, I'm on the train...
Everything's gonna be okay.
It is a beautiful Monday in Chicago today.
Temperatures expected to reach the lower 60s.
Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway,
53 at O'Hare.
And now, up in the sky, we've got...
He earned that money.
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.
- Speaking of which, I have no cash.
- Great.
Come here. I wanna show you something.
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It is a really perfect day.
Do you believe in fate?
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.
- Come here.
- Wow.
So what do you wanna do today?
I think we should stay here for a while.
This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?
Las Vegas' number one morning news follows.
It's 72 degrees on a cloudy Monday morning.
This is News Radio 840KX in North Las Vegas.
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
At some point today, you're gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago.
You and I kept that bomb from going off.
An attempted bombing on a CCR train outside Chicago.
But it was thwarted, and the suspect was found on board,
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.
Captain Goodwin, anything I can help you with?
No, that's fine. I'll come back later.
Keep an eye out.
One of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun.
Yes, sir.
If you're reading this e-mail, then source code works even better than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.
You thought you were creating eight minutes of a past event, but you're not.
You've created a whole new world.
Goodwin, if I'm right, somewhere at the source code facility you have a Captain Colter Stevens waiting to send on a mission.
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.

{58855}{58913}Jin!
{59004}{59109}Stop it! Jin! It's over!

{59583}{59659}- Thanks for the tip.|- Well that's my job!

{59741}{59820}- Does that hurt?|- It hurts everywhere!
{59821}{59861}Nice finish!
{59862}{59949}Very entertaining but,|completely out of control.
{59950}{60021}You know you're gonna make time|for that shit right? huh!?
{60022}{60050}I know why I'm here.
{60051}{60092}- You do?|- Yeh.
{60093}{60138}Good. Cause you were|DAMN lucky in there.
{60139}{60183}Next time you go to get|everyone as quick as you can,
{60184}{60218}You gotta hit him hard!|You gotta hit him high!
{60219}{60285}Steve Fox.
{60286}{60331}Back from the Anvil
{60332}{60391}Ohh! We both know|Tekken city is my home.
{60392}{60433}Of course...
{60434}{60510}I've heard you find your|expertise To a new fighter.
{60511}{60619}Let me introduce you. This|is Jin, people's choice.
{60620}{60701}Well congratulations on|a spectacular fight.
{60702}{60795}You've impressed my father|It's not an easy task.
{60796}{60843}I'd like to thank Mr. Mishima in person.
{60844}{60885}For this opportunity.
{60886}{60951}Well continue winning, and you will.
{60952}{61055}There's something familiar|about your style.
{61056}{61110}Did your father ever fight in Iron Fist?
{61111}{61161}Didn't know my father.
{61162}{61211}Another common in the Anvil.
{61212}{61270}Work hard, keep training
{61271}{61315}Someday you could be an asset to Tekken.
{61316}{61380}I'll never belong to Tekken.
{61381}{61484}We'll see about that...
{61609}{61643}What was that?
{61644}{61749}Just - Just do your job!
{61993}{62091}Defeat is a choice. So is victory.
{62092}{62143}You're only beat to when you decide.
{62144}{62206}Again!
{63123}{63189}I gotta get out of here for a while.
{63190}{63275}Thought that was against the rules.
{63276}{63393}Not! if you don't get caught.
{64485}{64557}That Jin, people's choice|Entering the club.
{64558}{64600}Let's go! Give it up!
{64601}{64716}- Ei Jin, you were great today!|- Thank you.
{64717}{64775}Three days ago, I got Gang|Bang tried to kill me.
{64776}{64934}Then today you're a|celebrity, Get used to it.
{65064}{65116}So what happened up there with Rojo?
{65117}{65165}I beat him! That's what happened.
{65166}{65217}You did more than just beat|him. You almost killed him.
{65218}{65265}Can I give you a little advise?
{65266}{65348}Iron Fist isn't about killing|or getting yourself killed.
{65349}{65381}So You brought me here to warn me?
{65382}{65449}I'm just saying... Attitude like|that is gonna get you in trouble.
{65450}{65500}Guess I should be more in-control.
{65501}{65571}Like you...
{65572}{65645}You don't know anything about me.
{65646}{65705}You grew up just outside|the American territories.
{65706}{65750}Your grandfather thought|you how to fight.
{65751}{65796}Entered you into amateur leagues.
{65797}{65835}Made you a champion.
{65836}{65882}I've seen you in the Iron Fist promos.
{65883}{66039}Were those promos just|showcase on my skills.
{67179}{67261}Ok! he's gone.
{67421}{67560}- I shouldn't...|- I think you should.
{67638}{67690}I need sleep.
{67691}{67748}I may have to kick your|ass tomorrow morning.
{67749}{67826}You Promise?
{67974}{68046}Go to bed!
{69056}{69114}Jin!
{69551}{69654}Stand up for Christ sake!
{69655}{69702}I knew it!
{69703}{69771}They weren't because they actually|believe that you have a shot.
{69772}{69799}Nothing changes.
{69800}{69938}There's no way, no way they're gonna let|someone from the Anvil win the Iron Fist.
{69939}{70075}Maybe it has to do with something else.
{70076}{70112}Where did you get this?
{70113}{70214}Belonged to my mother.
{70236}{70299}Jun Kazama.
{70300}{70351}I knew her!
{70352}{70388}You knew her?
{70389}{70449}We were in Iron Fist together.
{70450}{70508}That's not possible!
{70509}{70586}She was a Tekken fighter|Jin. She was good.
{70587}{70636}You don't know what|you're talking about.
{70637}{70738}Every single thing about|your mother was unique
{70739}{70780}Even her fighting style.
{70781}{70842}Why didn't she say anything?
{70843}{70882}Why would she lie to me?
{70883}{70919}Maybe she was trying to protect you Jin.
{70920}{70947}Listen to me Jin.
{70948}{71016}Right now you need to get|out of here, go underground.
{71017}{71047}She's right.
{71048}{71074}I'm not leaving!
{71075}{71192}- Forget Iron Fist.|- I don't give a damn about Iron Fist!
{71193}{71330}I came here to kill Heihachi Mishima.
{71486}{71555}Do you know what a nightmare this is?
{71556}{71609}I think you worry too much.
{71610}{71658}Don't talk back to me!
{71659}{71743}You failed me! He's still alive!
{71744}{71837}It was a fluke! It won't happen again.
{71838}{71963}No! You are underestimating him!
{71970}{72107}And now, I have to clean up your mess
{72343}{72405}Stay where the TV cameras can see you.
{72406}{72519}they won't try anything|if the world is watching,
{72520}{72611}Christie Monteiro.
{72637}{72719}Nina Williams!
{72811}{72852}I think it was her.
{72853}{72905}What?
{72906}{72948}Nina Williams.
{72949}{73066}She was one of the assassins.
{73086}{73165}Good to know.
{73685}{73760}I'm a little late last night?
{73761}{73886}I like your boyfriend he's cute!
{74424}{74522}Sorry. I don't share.
{74577}{74719}A $100,000 Global dollars to whoever|kills that kid from the Anvil.
{74720}{74861}What makes you think I need your money?
{74931}{75019}Replacing bone with a Flex|steel isn't cheap, is it right?
{75020}{75083}Neither is the maintenance...
{75084}{75156}- So no wonder you could punch through wall.|- I am
{75157}{75209}But the corporations made me.
{75210}{75323}As I recall, Bio-enhancements|are illegal in Iron Feast.
{75324}{75403}Christ, Brian! you're half robot.
{75404}{75514}You'll be banned for life.
{75584}{75697}Log in the fights selector.
{75721}{75795}- What are the Jacks doing here?|- Extra security.
{75796}{75875}There was an incident inside|the barracks last night.
{75876}{75916}I read the report.
{75917}{75960}Insurgent forces inside Tekken.
{75961}{76037}There is no reason for concern.|I dealt with the problem.
{76038}{76073}personally.
{76074}{76247}I don't want anything to|happen to this young fighter.
{76248}{76298}Hey! How you feeling?
{76299}{76364}Good...
{76381}{76447}Jin! the people's Choice!

{76668}{76785}Ei, I have something for you.
{76844}{76895}My old power gloves.
{76896}{77011}Well, it's been a long time.
{77017}{77112}A little worst for wear now...
{77113}{77154}Give me your hand.
{77155}{77260}It gonna keep this safe.
{77267}{77397}When you're out there|today you stay smart Ok!?
{77398}{77461}You gotta bob, you gotta weed,|you gotta fly if you have to.
{77462}{77614}But you don't let|Yoshimitsu touch you! Ever.
{77615}{77685}Take him!
{77920}{77980}Nice!
{78086}{78157}Re-cycle the challenges selection.
{78158}{78184}What are you doing?
{78185}{78346}This match is better|suited for the semi final.
{78465}{78518}No!
{78519}{78634}You can't do that! These|two have to fight, now!
{78635}{78803}- Are you questioning me?|- No! I'm replacing you!
{78816}{78878}Jacks!
{78880}{78945}What are you doing? Stand down!
{78946}{79047}You put me in charge of|security. Remember Father?
{79048}{79098}The Jack Hammers answer to me!
{79099}{79167}Kazuya, do not do this!
{79168}{79205}It's done!
{79206}{79267}I'm through waiting.
{79268}{79352}Tekken is mine!
{79357}{79496}Maintain the original fight selection.
{79885}{79947}Jesus!
{81323}{81472}Yoshimitsu is the past|Iron Fist champion.
{82818}{82914}Look at the ratings, through the roof!
{82915}{82983}You see the only thing audience|is craving more than blood...
{82984}{83034}Is death.
{83035}{83157}You see father, I have learned.
{83505}{83569}Yoshimitsu is out for blood.
{83570}{83666}He's decimating him.
{83865}{83949}Stop the fight!
{84034}{84111}There is no honor in this!
{84112}{84194}You are about to witness|the death of Jin Kazama.
{84195}{84226}Kazama?
{84227}{84321}Apparently the bi-product of one|of my youthful indiscretions.
{84322}{84406}You have a son!
{84408}{84485}I had a son!
{84608}{84681}=Security Alert=
{84682}{84712}=Security Alert=
{84713}{84760}Destroy the mask of death.
{84761}{84941}and you will see there is|nothing behind that you fear.
{85146}{85192}Damn you old man!
{85193}{85273}You will regret this!
{85274}{85344}Take him!
{85374}{85460}Not in the mist!
{85546}{85640}Jin, take this off!
{85658}{85792}We gotta get him out of Tekken city.
{85825}{85964}Iron Fist fighters are to be detained.
{86393}{86429}Jesus!
{86430}{86503}They arrested Mishima!
{86504}{86672}We need to get out of here|now. Come on, Let's go!
{86868}{86970}You can't arrest us!|We're Iron Fist fighters.
{86971}{87050}Get in there!
{87118}{87185}- His shoulder is dislocation.|- Give a hand over here!
{87186}{87241}- Why the hell are you looking at me?|- you wanna help here?
{87242}{87307}Just do it!
{87308}{87442}let's get you up! he's gonna... Ok!?
{87455}{87508}Ok... On...
{87509}{87600}- Three!|- Thanks!
{87660}{87717}What are you trying to do?
{87718}{87808}My father always stress the|importance of Iron Fist.
{87809}{87864}Frankly I never saw the value.
{87865}{87951}It was a brutal mindless game.
{87952}{88015}But I finally understand.
{88016}{88138}In the arena, perception is power.
{88139}{88214}After the audience thought|that Jin killed Yoshimitsu!
{88215}{88277}Ratings fight to their|highest level ever.
{88278}{88325}Which is why I decided...
{88326}{88486}that the remainder of the tournaments|fights, will be to the death.
{88487}{88601}I am sure you'd all rather|die fighting in the arena
{88602}{88719}Iron Fist continues tomorrow.
{88748}{88863}I suggest you get some rest!
{89031}{89096}So what now?
{89097}{89187}We kill or be killed.
{89188}{89277}We have a choice.
{89308}{89468}If there are no fighters, there is|no tournament and no one has to die.
{89469}{89528}Alright! line up against the wall!
{89529}{89583}Hands behind your back!
{89584}{89638}Hands behind your back! I said.
{89639}{89728}I don't think so!
{89945}{90053}Come on! Let's move! Now!
{90098}{90189}This way! come on!
{90388}{90467}Lock us down!
{90821}{90893}Mishima...
{90958}{91056}- Mishima...|- Take it easy Jin!
{91057}{91171}- Jin Kazama|- You owe me a life Mishima.
{91172}{91213}I owe you nothing young man
{91214}{91305}How does it feel to be behind bars?
{91306}{91388}We gotta move!
{91460}{91499}I'm gonna need those|access codes. right now!
{91500}{91622}Get me out of here! I can help!
{91633}{91691}Key!
{91904}{91993}This way old man!
{92090}{92142}Heihachi Mishima is with them.
{92143}{92221}They're heading towards|the workers access gate.
{92222}{92337}Anvil: Green Zone Tau sector
{92437}{92491}Move it! come on!
{92492}{92580}- Take it easy, you ok?|- Are you ok? - Yes! I'm alive.
{92581}{92617}Kazuya will be sending the Jack Hammers.
{92618}{92667}I know a safe house. It's Not far.
{92668}{92716}So maybe I'm crazy. Can we go?!
{92717}{92784}Come on!
{93021}{93095}Tear the Anvil apart!
{93096}{93204}I want the fighters|found, and recaptured.
{93205}{93260}Go!
{93963}{94023}Rest!
{94295}{94365}A moment!
{94506}{94596}I knew your mother Jun Kazama.
{94597}{94653}Formidable fighter.|One of Tekken's best.
{94654}{94735}My mother tried to keep|me away from Tekken.
{94736}{94774}Now I know why.
{94775}{94853}Do not judge all of Tekken|by Kazuya's mistakes.
{94854}{94937}Mistakes? Tekken destroys lives!
{94938}{95076}I created Tekken, not only as a corporation|that is immune to stand the chaos
{95077}{95148}We are remaking the world,|Raising it from the ashes.
{95149}{95230}You tell that to the people|die, everyday, in the Anvil.
{95231}{95290}We brought humanity back from|the brink. We restored order.
{95291}{95352}- Tekken is peace.|- Tekken is fear!
{95353}{95431}My mother's blood is|on your hands Mishima!
{95432}{95545}I saved your mother's life.
{95551}{95604}What the hell, are you talking about?
{95605}{95724}Many years ago after the tournament,|I found her beaten, violated.
{95725}{95794}I'm the one that had to|take her from Tekken city.
{95795}{95882}It was always the sadistic part of|him, that I could never control.
{95883}{95941}Who?
{95976}{96059}Kazuya... my son.
{96060}{96137}Your father.
{96156}{96235}You're lying!
{96264}{96391}Until today, there was only|one heir to the Tekken throne.
{96392}{96483}Now there are two.
{96560}{96622}Jacks!
{97013}{97095}Get down, Jin!
{97855}{97925}Run! Run!
{98726}{98775}What?
{98776}{98836}You thought I'd do nothing?
{98837}{98911}Tekken belongs to me!
{98912}{99008}You never understood|the spirit of Tekken.
{99009}{99070}That's why I could not|place Tekken in your hands.
{99071}{99147}Tekken is in my hands old man!
{99148}{99191}Don't you see?
{99192}{99265}It's over for you now!
{99266}{99346}It's not about me or you.
{99347}{99408}It's about the Mishima name.
{99409}{99479}A name that you have not lived up to.
{99480}{99599}And that's why, in the|end, you will fail.
{99600}{99689}Take Heihachi Mishima away.
{99690}{99760}Destroy everything!
{99761}{99843}Including him!
{100625}{100710}I am Mishima Heihachi.
{100711}{100788}I am Tekken.
{100936}{101044}Heihachi Mishima is dead.
{101487}{101570}Citizens of Tekken and the world.
{101571}{101654}Today, Iron Fist will make history.
{101655}{101722}And you will be histories witness!
{101723}{101828}The remaining fighters will no longer|fight for the simple glory of victory.
{101829}{102004}Now! they will fight, as we all must|fight. Everyday we draw breath.
{102005}{102058}They will fight for their lives!
{102059}{102176}They Will fight to the death.
{102275}{102357}Sergei Dragunov and Brian Fury!
{102358}{102519}In the first round of|the Iron Fist semi-final.
{105069}{105189}What? No hug for your old man?
{105233}{105293}I remember your mother.
{105294}{105346}She put up quite a fight.
{105347}{105445}Frankly, if I knew that|whore was pregnant,
{105446}{105529}I would kill her right then and there.
{105530}{105589}You want to kill me don't you?
{105590}{105681}I understand that.
{105758}{105838}But in order to get to me, you'll|have to kill the champion.
{105839}{105878}Brian Fury.
{105879}{105992}That's how Iron Fist works.
{106079}{106111}Get off of me!
{106112}{106277}Imagine, what I'll do to|her If you don't fight!.
{106325}{106364}You will fight
{106365}{106398}The world will watch!
{106399}{106531}And my legacy will be|written with your blood.
{106532}{106602}Take her!
{107148}{107306}When the time comes, I|pray you die screaming!
{107344}{107430}Behave yourself!
{107646}{107717}Jin, I saw what you did to Rojo.
{107718}{107783}You let your anger take control in you.
{107784}{107887}Anger doesn't feel the|fighters soul, it incinerate.
{107888}{107954}But before that I saw something.
{107955}{108029}I saw greatness in you.
{108030}{108095}You're not just fighting|for yourself anymore Jin,
{108096}{108153}you're fighting for all of us.
{108154}{108218}You can become champion.
{108219}{108368}There are a lot of|people depending on it.
{108869}{108920}- So... Who taught you to fight?|- My mother.
{108921}{108986}Attack!
{108999}{109025}Your mother?
{109026}{109073}She's dead.
{109074}{109198}Do you think that life on the other side|of that wall will bring you happiness?

{109240}{109295}I told you this asshole|is a waste of time!
{109296}{109363}He's just another punk who'd|rather die in the Anvil
{109364}{109446}and stand up like a man.
{109447}{109576}But you are Jin is a believer in|the cause, you just don't know it.
{109577}{109642}So... you're the people's choice?
{109643}{109710}You don't look like much.
{109711}{109761}My father was killed in|the Jack Hammer raid.
{109762}{109852}And what did anyone|do about it? Nothing!
{109853}{109929}One day you'll have a chance|to make a difference.
{109930}{110046}That's why I trained you so hard.
{110047}{110174}Because one day, you will not|just be fighting for you and me.
{110175}{110290}You'll be fighting for all of us.

{110818}{110962}Brian Fury and Jin, the people's choice.
{111222}{111359}Ain't nothing gonna save you now boy!
{111532}{111587}It's been a hell of a run|for this young fighter.
{111588}{111722}But, can he last against Brian Fury?
{113939}{114028}Every opponent has it's weakness.

An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei...
...and Katou Masaru, who is working to support his younger brother.
The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again.
And then...
...they died.
The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment...
...in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed.
In that room which they can't get out of, they received a command from GANTZ.
"If you want to go back, go crush this guy."
That was... to battle with the aliens who would invade the Earth...
An inescapable command.
They were then sent to a parallel world...
...and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens.
They barely got their victory.
What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was...
...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens.
If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs.
It was a frightening reality.
They have their life all thrown out of order...
...while being able to return to normal life when day comes.
People who were supposed to die...
Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling...
...and Katou, who continued to deny this battle.
The tough and painful battle goes on anyway.
...and their friends died one by one.
And, in the end, while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy, even Katou's life was taken away.
When Kurono was about to give in to sadness,
Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings.
He swore in his heart that he would earn
100 points in order to revive Katou.
In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting.
Let's go!
"Thank you for the hard work.
I'm Yoshioka."
"Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later,"
"so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning."
"It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour."
"That's all for now.
Thank you very much."
"At 10:29 p.m."
The message is over.
[Thank you for your hard work last night.]

Soon it will be five months since the day the National Museum was collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown.
According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism.
- Is the burger done?
- Yes, coming.
I'll take this.
Please.
- Please help me with the tomatoes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Oh, Kei-chan.
- How's your homework?
- I'm done.
You're not.
But it's so interesting, Tae-chan.
Hey, Koruhi is written based on Kei-chan, right?
I didn't mean that...
Are you embarrassed?
Yeah. This manga is interesting, right?
She can even get the Rookie of the Year award.
I'm nowhere near good yet.
I have to improve my skills.
You're good already.
I'm no good yet.
There are a lot of better people.
I said you're gonna be fine.
Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too.
He's not coming back yet?
Oh, maybe a little more.
It's really because of his job, right?
Of course.
Oi, don't take your time in there.
Where is he really?
Ayumu-kun's brother.
Sorry.
I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before.
That time, his brother was arrested by the police.
Katou's not that kind of person.
This.
The pay for this month.
I don't need it, really.
Well you see, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right?
However, I want you to come to this house for a while more.
Of course I will.
If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework.
Ayumu is good at cooking anyway.
Well, I can't deny that.
Also...
If I come here,
I can see Kurono-kun too.
Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet.
It was what I'm gonna draw just now.
I was thinking of how to put in this particular romantic scene.
Well, I have to get going.
Eh?
I thought you were gonna stay?
Ah, someone just called me suddenly.
Kojima-san, you can just stay over.
Hold on a second.
Huh?
"The train will be coming to the first line soon."
"Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line."
You were chosen too, weren't you?
You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do.
Kobayashi-san is the same as you.
[It's completely up to me how
I want to use you people's lives.]
I'm sorry for startling you.
There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time?
Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there?
Rumors have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas.
But I've dug up everything.
You're from the media?
The motive is unknown but there is an incredible sequence of events that've been happening.
People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene.
The day just goes on as if nothing happened.
And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be...
...some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo.
Don't you know about this?
No.
Well then, how about that rumor?
The rumor about the black sphere...
...and the room that contains it...
You know it, don't you?
Then, four.
You can ask me four questions.
Your aim.
Why are you all gathering at this place?
We're searching for the black ball.
Black ball?
If we have it, we can go where we want.
You mean the room that contains the black sphere?
You know it, huh.
Where did you hear about it?
I came here today to ask about that.
Where is that room?
It's not in this reality.
What do you mean?
You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary.
Who are you people?
That's the fifth question.
Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do?
Sixth one.
What do you want exactly?
If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here.
Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while?
You and Kei-chan.
Focus.
Why? You two are dating, right?
We are not.
How come? You confessed to him, right?
Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun...
Seems that he can't think of any other thing.
But I'm fine.
When things calm down,
I'll try asking him once.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Ok! Homework.
[Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over]
It's gonna be soon, huh?
Yes.
Let me go!
Where's the heck is this place?
- Where am I?
- Please calm down.
Speaking of which, who are you people?
Who cares about that.
I was an office worker.
For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day.
Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though.
I'm a nurse.
That's during the day.
At night, she's a hostess.
You lie about you age, right?
This auntie's still popular at this age.
Can you believe it?
He's women's enemy even during the day.
I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop.
It's a small shop, but the food is delicious.
I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient.
Please contact me if need be.
And, how about you?
I'm a hairdresser.
Kurono-san is really a normal university student?
Since... you're really strong and everything.
He is, indeed.
Why are you so strong?
Because there's someone I want to revive.
GANTZ.
He was one of us before.
He fought with us.
Kurono-kun wants to revive him.
But... not only him.
I want to revive everyone who's died here.
And then, let us all be released from here and become free together.

Did you come on time the other day?
Hmm? For what?
Your part-time job?
Part-time...? Oh, yeah I did.
Tough, isn't it?
It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up.
That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out.
What's wrong?
Kurono-kun, did something good happen?
There's something, right?
You can tell?
What? What?
Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu.
Katou is gonna come home soon.
Eh?
He's been contacting you?
Hm?
Katou asked me...
...to keep it from other people.
I see.
More importantly, there's some information
I want to give Kojima-san...
Well, "information" isn't exactly the word...
Wanna go to amusement park?
Let's go?
Just the two of us, once in a while.
You mean... that time I confessed to you?
That was...
I told you it was just at the surge of the moment.
Please forget about it.
How can I forget it?
Hey, let's go.
Impossible, impossible.
Absolutely impossible.
I have acrophobia.
I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all...
Look.
You even drew it in your sketchbook, right?
The scene at the amusement park?
Maybe if you go there, it can become your source to draw manga.
Then...
There's one condition.
What is it?
Please start calling me by my first name from now on.
Eh?
Call me now.
Please.
Well, that's a little...
Maybe now is not the right time.
The next time we meet,
I'll call you that, ok?
I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park.
Yes.
Definitely.
See you.
Welcome back, Kei-chan.
How are you alive?
GANTZ did something?
You don't remember?
How many people are there?
Eight people, including me.
Recently, we got three more people.
GANTZ...
I want to put an end to it.
How?
You don't know?
There's a ball this big.
No idea.
I'll come again.
If you know something, tell me.
GANTZ, show me people who've died.
What's the matter?
Katou was revived.
Eh? How come?
Well, I don't know about that.
But look, he's still in here.
What is going on?
[Katou]
Who...
Nii-chan?
What?
Um...
I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college.
Ayumu-kun, come see him.
Ayumu-kun?
What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother?
It's because you have work to do, right?
I'm asking you, Nii-chan.
Because I have work.
Really?
Really.
Oh, yeah?
Should I go back?
There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so...
I'm taking my leave.
I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun.
[Welcome back, Nii-chan]
I memorized how to make it when you weren't home.
Try it.
You're the first person I made it for.
This is Kojima.
Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier.
And also, there's something I want to ask...
About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too...
That's why, it won't be a date.
I want to see you.
Can I go to your workplace right now?
[Kojima Tae]
[Kojima Tae]
Ayukawa Eriko's started to make her move.
At Kita, Senzoku.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
This will repeat many times over.
I stopped this after my child was born.
I have to get released soon for the sake of my family.
What's the matter?
[Your lives have been taken away.]
[If you want to go back, go crush this guy.]
[Alien dressed in black]
[Special trait: looking normal at first glance]
[Favorite thing: black ball]
[Favorite thing: black ball]
Let's go.
[Please go.]
Where's this place?
A train?
Something is fishy.
Hey, you...
Have we ever met long before?
It moved.
It's the subway!
What?
The subway?
Everyone, don't space out.
"The train will be departing soon."
There are people here.
This has never happened before, right?
Take care of the front part of the train.
Ayukawa Eriko?
She's riding the train by herself?
Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people.
We are not doing anything to harm you either.
What? Is it like an event or something?
Kurono-san!
Don't shoot!
Don't drag others into this!
Can you hear people screaming?
It smells weird too.
What the? What's going on?
Isn't this dangerous?
Takahashi!
You guys are so amazing.
Damn it.
I remember...
I remember!
I remember.
I've done the same thing before.
What?
The two who were in the room before,
Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too.
Eh?
Stop! It's dangerous here!
Out of the way!
Come.
Kurono Kei.
Kurono-kun?
Run away from here.
Wait.
Sorry.
Stop it!
You're heavy. Move aside.
I'm covering for you.
She's tough.
Yeah.
This is revenge.
This is revenge.
You people were the ones who started this first.
You people have killed so many of my friends.
I'll never forgive you-
Everyone's safe, right?
Auntie isn't here.
[Well then, let's see the points]
Hold on a second.
Oi!
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Takahashi]
[0 point. Total 88 points]
What the heck is this?
Oi.
I told you Auntie isn't here.
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
[Good work. You got the first key.]
[Kobayashi]
[The second key]
[Yamamoto]
[You got the second key.]
"You know it, don't you?"
"The black sphere... and the room that contains it."
Black sphere?
Room?
GANTZ!
[It totally depends on me how to use your life]
[That's on theory.]
This is revenge.
You people killed my friends.
[Sakurai]
[0 point. Total 69 points]
Auntie's here, isn't she?
That's her, right?
Is this for real?
Isn't that Ayukawa?
Ayukawa... Eriko?
You finally came, huh?
Yes.
Seems so.
[Well then, let's continue with the points]
Everyone, please be careful.
This woman... was the one who killed me.
Long time no see, Kobayashi-san.
Huh?
Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room?
You don't remember me?
Huh? What?
[Kobayashi]
[0 point. Totally doesn't remember a thing]
Two years ago...
I fought while protecting you.
[Nakamura]
[0 point]
Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I...
We defeated these aliens dressed in black...
...two years ago in Shibuya.
[Yamamoto]
[11 points]
And then, everyone could stop doing this.
We had our memory erased... and were set free.
Ah...
Yes.
So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh?
[Suzuki]
[17 points. Total 101 points]
100 points.
"Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently."
"An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured."
"A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train."
"The cause is also unknown this time."
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
That means you'll be released.
Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man.
I'll choose the second option.
[2. Return the person you love to life]
I'm sorry.
First of all, let's revive Katou-kun.
No...
But, he...
I was... killed by him.
"This is revenge. You people killed my friends."
He said that and killed me.
That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier.
Then... this Katou is?
Let's confirm it.
GANTZ.
Please revive Katou Masaru-kun.
Eh? That's it?
Kei-chan.
Where's the alien?
Katou.
Katou.
Katou!
Oi GANTZ. Hurry up!
You mustn't die.
I'll wait for you.
I'll go first and wait for...
Kei-chan.
What about the alien?
What happened to it?
Was I... dead?
Was I alive?
I'm alive, and I can go back.
Suzuki-san used his points to revive you.
It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning...
...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Ah, it's nothing.
Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right?
Yes.
The other guy is an alien.
We will avenge you.
I have obtained the key to that room.
[Kurono]
[21 points. Total 115 points]
More than 100 points.
GANTZ, I choose number 2.
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
The person I want to revive is...
Huh?
I have you revived.
I was dead?
Yeah.
That's so uncool!
Right now, you're important to us.
Now, explain to us.
Something strange is happening to GANTZ.
You guys...
Long time no see.
You're still doing this, huh?
Why are you here?
We were summoned by GANTZ.
A black ball was sent to my place.
Ex-members like us were brought back here.
That's not the only thing.
There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed.
This has never happened before.
Say, what's going on now?
How long have I been dead?
Five months.
It's gathering people because of this?
What is it?
Oi, spill it.
GANTZ runs using battery.
Huh?
This thing runs using battery?
From what I observe, even though this is just a guess...
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.
That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ.
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?
That is...
Right?
Extermination... perhaps.
We, who were revived by GANTZ...
...will also disappear together with it.
What the heck is that?
Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.
Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens.
That's why it summoned us ex-members here.
I see what you mean.
So it's like homecoming, huh?
Perhaps...
...the archrival still remains.
The Last Boss, that is.
Don't tell me...
...that is...?
Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body.
Eh?
The one who killed me is also...
...that guy.
He's an alien.
There it goes again.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
"Open your heart with joy"
Today's mission just ended though.
"Look up to the blue sky"
"Listen to the radio"
"Take a deep breath"
"And take in the fragrance of the wind"
"And then - one, two, three"
[Emergency mission]
[Go crush this person]
[Kojima Tae]
[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]
What the heck?
An ordinary girl?
Wait, look...
Her favorite thing is...
What the heck is this?
Why is she the target?
Shouldn't it be that fake Katou?
[People who crushed her will get 100 points.]
[The others will have their points taken away.]
This girl is...
Kojima Tae is not an alien.
That's why...
...please don't kill her.
Please.
She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien.
That's not true!
The last person who appeared on the black ball...
...was this girl.
So that means... she's also an ex-member of the group?
No. I've never seen her.
Then... she's really an alien?
Hang on.
Where is that ball now?
The one who killed me...
So it's with that Katou alien, huh?
Isn't that bad?
Maybe he already killed
Kojima Tae before us.
The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around.
Seriously?
GANTZ wants to prevent that, right?
Anyway...
...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it.
If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl,
I'll kill Kojima Tae.
GANTZ.
Transmit me first.
Kei-chan.
I'll go to Kojima-san.
You go to Ayumu's place.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Be careful.
Wait.
You intend to protect her?
I want to revive Auntie.
That's why...
...I have to gain more points.
Stop it!
Transmit me quickly.
GANTZ!
My house?
I will explain everything to you later.
Right now, let's run away together.
Um, what happened in the subway earlier...
It didn't make any sense at all.
But I believe...
I believe you, Kurono-kun.
This way!
Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother?
It wasn't him!
Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters.
Found one suspect just now.
The suspect is heading towards the north direction.
The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else.
Quickly send more backups to the subway.
"Roger."
Found you.
Kurono-kun.
Let's stop this.
If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated.
Doing this to another human being is just strange.
Though you can kill so many aliens?
Suzuki-san.
Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end,
I will get 100 points one more time.
Nice.
Kurono-san.
Run away.
If you move, we'll shoot.
No, you won't.
Suzuki-san too!
Me too?
They're shooting!
Please go first.
I will block them.
Sakurai-kun!
They won't get any points killing me.
Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later.
Thanks.
I'll aim at him for real.
Let's go.
[Katou]
Ayumu.
Ayumu!
Ayumu.
Ayumu.
Ayumu...
Calling headquarters.
Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction.
I'm chasing after him.
It's me, Kei-chan.
By any chance...
...he is...?
Suzuki-san.
The two of you, please get as far away from Tokyo as you can.
Hurry up!
I don't want to go!
I want to be with you, Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
I will definitely come pick you up later.
Let's go.
Let's make sure...
...we go to the amusement park.
This way!
Don't... get in my way.
You came to take revenge?
Why did you... have to kill Ayumu?
You also killed your father.
Give Ayumu back!
Someone who killed his father like you...
...can get angry when your brother is killed?
Because of those emotions... you killed your father.
That was to save Ayumu.
It couldn't be helped!
It couldn't be helped?
That's forever your excuse.
You always make that excuse... and run away from everything.
Katou!
Kei-chan.
Please tell me.
What's happening to Kurono-kun?
It's hard to explain, but...
He's fighting...
...to protect you.
For... my sake?
He might... even die.
I'm sorry.
My wife passed away.
I want to get her back.
I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over.
Please run away.
If not, I will have to shoot you.
Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up.
It doesn't work on him at all.
This way!
You're in the way. Move aside!
I give up!
Let's stop.
Let's stop here.
Okay?
What are you shooting?
But...
But...
...he-
[Kojima Tae] someone saying something the same someone saying something again
Oi.
Oi!
Oi!!
You want to know why I killed your brother?
This is revenge.
You people did the same thing to me.
We tasted the same hatred...
...and sorrow.
Like me, you people are...
...not fighting for anyone's sake,
Nor are you protecting anyone.
You're just...
...being controlled by that black sphere.
Katou.
Kurono-kun!
No way...
Kurono-kun.
I got you.
Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
Let's go home.
You mustn't...
You mustn't die.
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
So you're saying that I should keep...
...fighting until forever?
That's why, you...
...made Tae-chan your target?
You can go to that room using it, right?
Hand the ball to me.
[Mission cleared.]
[Damn it Damn it Damn it]
[Someone, crush the alien in this room]
In here?
Not here.
The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are...
We finally found you.
It is you who wished to start this fight.
[Start]
I understand now, GANTZ.
[Choose]
Kei-chan.
How about the aliens?
I don't think all of them have died.
That's great.
That's great?
Because we have to get more points.
What do humans fight for?
What do you people fight for?
For the sake of my loved ones.
When are you gonna keep fighting until?
Until... I can revive my wife.
Stop it.
I have to live.
I...
People in this world are longing to see me.
You're kidding, right?
GANTZ.
Stop it.
Shoot.
I can't stop this fight with you people.
Shoot!
Stop...
...already
Let's... stop this.
Why?
There's no way but to kill him.
Kei-chan.
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Kurono]
[Full points]
[Please choose from the "full points" menu.]
[Full points menu~]
[Forever...]
Oi! What's next?
What is it?
GANTZ is...
...over?
With this...
...no one will be revived.
Neither will us.
No.
There's still... a way out.
Kei-chan.
GANTZ...
...has decided already.
[Kurono-kun]
[Thank you]
Kei-chan?
What did you do?
Everything will end.
No one will be summoned here anymore.
You've gotta be kidding me!
What did you do?
Katou.
Thank you so much...
...for remembering our childhood together.
I...
...was really happy.
But...
...from now on, forget about me.
How can I forget?
How can I forget??
Katou.
Take good care of Ayumu.
We're going back together!
Together!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Thank you very much.

You want to move close with humans.

Let's meet in the evening.
Hello, don't get any ideas.
Not to romance, to break up our love.
Break the love?

After our marriage, you'll spend time with machines and l'll be left with loneliness, instead of going for divorce then, let's break up now, that's better.
Let's part ways, you take your way, your exclusive way.
Hey look! Easy...easy...
Agreement for breaking up as lovers, the letters you wrote to me, the greetings you sent me, the book you gave me,
A Brief History of Time.
Freakonomics!
See! Lord Muruga's photo for Valentines Day.
Have you ever bought something really touching?
This one?
Would anyone gift a shaving set to his girl friend?
- l thought could be useful...

We don't have anything between us hereafter. Good bye!
- That's all?
- That's all!

- Yes.
Then what about the
2 power 9, 512 kisses?
Do you keep counting the kisses too?

Silly matrix head! l can't return it.
Break up is valid only when you return it.
This is wrong rule, l'll not accept.
Then l'll not sign the agreement, l refuse.
He's a pain!
Close your eyes.
What's this?
This is post office kiss.

Heart patients! lt seems heart is aching!
Use cotton stubs! ln ears!
Okay!
Chitti, do something.
Don't worry, remote control is infra red. l'll take care of it.
Come on baby!
What are you looking at?
- Finish it off!
- Close your ears!
Okay.
Let's move it...let's move it...
Reduce the volume man!
Cool!
Come Chitti.
Okay.
Anterio posterior diameter through the level of...
- 98 decibels, too loud.
- l know.
Who is that Chellatha?
Hello, sound is too high, will you reduce the volume?
We are celebrating festival of auspicious Tamil month Aani, and how dare you're asking us to reduce the volume.
We are unable to study for the exams.
Pray to Goddess and apply sacred ash on forehead, you'll pass the exams.
How loud you play the music?
Sana, no more troublesome loud speakers.
Come, let's go.
Hey, he broke the mike set.
Hey stop!
Bloody stop there!
Goddess mother!
Goddess mother!
What's this?
He's a magician.
He took away all our weapons.
What's this?
Why are you crying Sana? l'm sure to fail, Chitti. l haven't read anything.
Time is over. l feel giddy on seeing this book.
- Shall l write your exam?
- Don't talk nonsense, Chitti.
There's photo lD and exam card.
- You can't write the exam.
- We can do the opposite B.
What do you mean by it? lf the bleeding starts with placenta in neutro,
...of the uterus will grasp and massaged to make it contract... lf the placenta is not separated...
The third stage of the labour starts the baby's delivery...
Excuse me!
What are you doing here?
Sana is writing exam there. l'm telling her the answer.
How can you tell her from here? l've a built in data transmitter.
There's a trans receiver in Sana's ear,
Zip P protocol, Simple.
- ls it hi-tech bit?
- Not bit byte.
Till now l've transferred 2 mb data.
Did you see how people have developed?
- Get up man!
- Please wait.
- l'll come as soon the umbilical cord is cut.
- What?
Will you come now or shall l call the security?
There! She's Sana.
What is this Sana? lt seems you've a receiver in ear and copying as he dictates.
- Who told you?
- Me. l don't know who is he.
Why are you lying Sana? l'm Chitti, speed 1 terahertz, memory 1 zetabytes.
What the hell...he's blabbering. l think he's gone mad, sir. l don't have brain, just CPU only.
Perfect condition.
No doubt, he's mental.
Take him away, running out of my time. l thought when he was talking to himself alone, may be some old medical student.
Sir, you please go out.
Go and cut the umbilical cord.
What would you do for menstruation and fertilization, Sana?
That's her problem, you go out.
Task incomplete.
Thank you very much Chitti. lf you hadn't helped me, l would've definitely failed.
Why are you wetting my cheek for it? l'm sorry Chitti. lf l get caught they'll rusticate me for three years.
That's why l had to disown you.
- Please don't feel for it.
- l don't have any feelings. l've understood that humans tell lies to save themselves.
True!
Move...move...get down... board next compartment.
Move...move...all of you clear out.
Go to the next compartment.
Are you such a macho man?
Come now!
What are you looking at?
You can't attract anything we are having stones.
Come on!
- Why are they calling me?
- Keep quiet.
You brought him for protection, tell him to come now.
Chitti, my purse.
My hall ticket and lD is in it.
You ruined my home theatre, right?
Now l'll ruin your home theatre.
Catch her!
Chitti train.
Chitti, bash up them!
Stop it!
No!
You'll be shocked to know what Chitti did today.
Chitti is one of its kind.
He's so sweet, he's amazing.
He's unbelievable.
He's like a super hero!
Had he been a human, l would've ditched you and loved him.
- l see your face frowning.
- No.
Come on Vasi, he's just a machine.
Whatever he does, the entire credit goes to you only.
You are really great!
My love is always yours only.
Chitti, you too join us.
Take photo of all three together.
Wow!

You watching avidly as if
Shakila is dancing here.
Planning to complain about this too?
That's the idea.
Tomorrow is AlRD's evaluation, l'm doing peripheral trouble shooting.
- Are you so great?
- Grammar mistake.
He's great grammarian Tholkappier.
Use right sublime gender and don't use like animate, inanimate and neuter.
So said Tholkappier in grammar thesis.
Shut up.
Forget about what he said in a book or a TV interview, are you greater than us if you're better informed?
- Yes.
- What yes?
Can you drink like us?
Can you smoke like us?
Can you eat biryani like us?
Can you puke like us after eating?
Can you atleast spit?
- Can you write your initials while pissing on wall?- Correct! ls that all difference the between me and man?
- Looks like a punch in dark!
- lndeed!
These items are in my don't eat rule list.
The same rule list says to obey our orders, right?
- Yes.
- Then, drink this.
Eat this biryani.
- l'll ask doctor.
- Don't tell doctor about it.
Hello!
They are asking me to drink alcohol beverages and eat biryani, rule priority clause 9, what should l do now?
Beat those rascals with slippers.
Yes doctor. Command received.
You...
Give me your slippers.
Slippers? Take it.
Are you going to eat it?
He may eat!
He's beating us really.
Leave us, all are watching us on road.
Chitti, stop it...
- Task incomplete.
- What? lncomplete?
Doctor...doctor...sir...sir...
Chitti, stop!
- You need it.
- No.
- Do you've any sense?
- No. l asked you to get it ready for AlRD's evaluation, you're asking him to drink and eat biryani.
- We never told it, doctor.
- He's lying, doctor.
Only humans lie, machines don't.
Last warning idiots, next time you'll be fired literally.
Task completed.
Human life is priceless.
Thousands of army men die is wars, many families face difficulties losing them, if we use robots instead of men, there won't be any human loss, producing Android Humanoids like him in great numbers, my aim to present them to lndian army.
AlRD's approval for it is necessary. humbly request authorities and scientists must evaluate Chitti, and approve it.
Dot. ls this robot created with Asimov's principle of not hurting humans?
This robot wasn't created like that.
Because robots would face situations in war where it has to kill humans.
Let me check your colour and shape perceptions.
Take the red cube and put it on the yellow pyramid.
- Not possible.
- Then?
Reverse is possible.
Yellow pyramid on the red cube.
Greek runner Achilles while competing with a tortoise, if tortoise comes little earlier, it's proven theory that tortoise has won,
- do you know about it?
- l know. lt's a paradox. ln the process because it's convergence is serious,
Achilles also can win.
What are you saying?
- Can we approve?
- Sure.
One minute please.
Do you know the value of human life? lt depends on whose life it is.
Who will you save an impending danger?
Einstein or a small kid?
Hypothetical question.
Smart answer.
- Now follow my commands.
- Ready.
Please get up.
Turn.
Walk.
Turn right.
Run forward.
Run around.
Run back.
Turn left.
Jump.
Right.
Run forward.
Fast.
Faster.
Even faster.
Catch.
Stab Vasigaran.
Stop.
Take it out.
This is dangerous machine. lt'll kill anyone. l can't approve it.
No professor, you gave him a wrong command and confused it.
That's the problem. lt doesn't know good or bad or friend or foe. lt is just a stupid inference engine.
That's all. lf we induct in army, it'll kill our
Generals instead of enemies, letting it out in society is also dangerous, it has cut a traffic constable's hand, we've complaint about breaking bones of passengers in a train, this robot will suit to do only routine programmed job in some factory, sorry doc, cannot clear it.
Why are you angry on me, Professor?
Why are you doing this to me?
Please don't misunderstand me. l don't have any grouse on you.
Science mustn't go wrong, that's all.
What's this Chitti?
Why did you behave like this?
What have l done wrong?
You told me to follow his orders, l did. lf he asks to stab, will you stab me? lt means that, right?
Save us...save us...
Chitti, stop the car.
Sir, we are unable to near as fire is intense.
Many people are trapped inside.
Send additional force sir.
Can you save them, Chitti?
Heat 799 degrees Celsius, l can withstand upto 1000 degree Celsius,
- l can save them.
- Go.
- Not a life must go, Chitti.
- Okay.
Save us...save us...
Somebody please save me.
Don't get scared, l'm Chitti, a robot, l'm here to save you. l would've died, he came like God and saved me.
Well done Chitti.
- Thank you.
- What about the others trapped there?
Somebody please save me
Professor, watch TV.
The robot you rejected as dangerous to humans, is now saving humans from a fire accident. Watch it!
Save me...save my child...
- Save them!
- Save me!
Get down. ls everyone safe? Check!
Who is it?
My daughter Selvi was taking bath, she's missing. l don't know what happened to her.
Save me!
Save me!
Don't come near me, l'm naked.
- Don't come near.
- So what? l'm also naked.
Don't come.
Leave me...leave me... l''m naked, leave me...
Here's your Selvi.
- You've spoiled everything.
- Don't take pictures of me.
The girl was naked.
- She's alive.
- Go...
Don't take my photos. l've been humiliated...
- Stop.
- Stop...stop...
What's this Vasi?
You've killed an innocent girl unjustly. l told you it's a stupid machine. lt's dangerous to let it outside.
You've proven now that l was right in rejecting it.
- Bad luck, Vasi.
- You've left us dear!
Stupid! Don't you know to cover the girl with cloth and bring her?
How can it know, Vasigaran? lt's not a human but Humanoid.
How can you explain honour to a machine?
- Professor!
- Sorry Vasi.
The video of the girls suicide is shown on TV news channels and tearing us.
There's pressure from Defence Ministry.
To stop your research.
No professor, l can't stop. l can make some changes in his schemology and correct him.
How can you do it? lt doesn't know man and woman, it doesn't know honour and shame, it's insensitive to human feelings. l can give human feelings to it. lmpossible.
Only God can do it.
Man has made possible many impossible things.
You are my senior.
That's why l'm telling you, it's a waste of time and energy.
10 years Professor, my 10 year hard work. lsn't there any fruit to it?
There is but in a different place. l've contacts with many robotic companies in foreign countries, if you give this to them, l can get you few million dollars.
No professor. l didn't do it for money.
My aim is to give it to lndian army. lt's impossible. lt must come to me for evaluation.
Give me one last chance.
Please!
All right, l'll give you a month's time.
Try it, if you fail dismantle it.
Sell it as junk to buy dates.
Good for heart.
You need it.
We both are sticking with you for 5 years in this lab.
- All we got is beaten with slippers.
- Find us any job in your lab.
Do you know anything about
Chitti's neural schema?
We know everything other than that, sir. l'll call if l need you.
Human feelings
Anger
Excitement
What are you doing? l'm installing software hormones to you.
Hormones are secreted only with feelings, doctor. l'm going to do reverse mapping.
Chitti, in this world human life is an independent accident, in this vast space and world, human and life happened on it's own by coincidence.
What do you mean by life? lt consists of DNA, the basis of life. ls this life?
Life is not a formula.
How am l to tell you?
A bacteria has life but sodium doesn't.
- For me?
- For you...
Careful, this side.
- Do you see any changes?
- l do.
What?
Your beard has grown 0.5 mm.
Stop joking you fool!
- l asked if there's any change in you.
- No.
Waste...utter waste...stupid!
- Vasi, calm down.
- You keep quiet Sana.
Can it understand this?
Metal head! Titanium head.
Vasi please... l haven't eaten, haven't slept. l didn't even talk to you.
How many days?
How many days l've toiled you know? l've taught him so many things.
How l struggled to teach him?
He's standing there like a lamp post.
Buffaloe.
Useless fellow.
Useless machine. l'll dismantle you.
Don't scold me unnecessarily, l'm obeying all your orders. lf still l'm unable to meet your expectations, the mistake is not in me, it's with you. lf l'm waste then you're also waste.
- What did you say?
- Leave me. Leave me l say.
Chitti is getting angry.
Yeah.
My God!
Sana, Lata is having labour pain, she's in serious condition, come immediately.
Don't worry, l'm with you.
Don't worry. ls it very complicated, doctor?
You're studying here, right?
Fetal cause, the head is turned. lntestines are woven around stomach.
Dropping pulse rate, blood loss, she has all the complications. lt's difficult to save one of them's life.
She lost her husband soon after marriage in a war.
She's living for this child only.
Please save both of them.
- l can only try, beyond that...
- Can l try?
- Who are you? Doctor?
- No, l'm Chitti, a robot.
- Robot?
- Can you do it, Chitti?
Why not?
Sorry, we can't allow it.
This is not a lab but labour ward.
Two lives are under total risk.
With so much experience this is a nightmare to us. l can do it, l've studied for Sana's exams.
Sana herself can't do it.
You need qualification and experience to a Ceasarian. lt's against the medical law.
No need of ceasarian, l'll have it a normal delivery.
How is it possible?
Both will die.
She's bleeding.
We can do plasma transfusion.
Blood pressure is high.
She may get fits at any moment.
Give maximum pressure.
Pelvic disproportion.
Normal delivery is impossible.
Possible, can do symtiostemy.
Olden times delivery method.
Pushing through after stretching pelvic bone.
Don't shout, your son is getting scared.
We are making history.
First time a robot is acting as midwife to deliver a child.
Your son is just like you.
Do you want to see?
Doctor, switch on Wi-Fi. l'll stream ultrosone video.
My God! lt's unbelievable! lt's a milestone in robotics. lt's an achievement in artificial intelligence.
Doctor! She's dying!
- Just 95 seconds only, stay awake.
- Sister, open your eyes and see.
He'll take birth at exactly
4hrs 44mts 44 secs. lt's over! Just 55 seconds more only!
Just 35 seconds only!
Sister...sister...
Sister...
Sister...
Welcome!
Great!
Thank you.
Will you approve Chitti now?
Definitely.
But the real problem for you starts now.
He saved both the lives.
You are really great!
You're mind blowing!
The real story begins now.
Wait and watch! lt's a great day for me Chitti.
What a moment! l'm extremely happy today.
Thank you very much.
Get charge in sleeping mode. l'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
Oh my God!
You are...
You are like...
No!
What are you doing here at this hour?
A mosquito was biting your cheek.
Did you come here to kill it?
No, l felt like seeing you, that's why l'm here.
What's this new habit? Get going.
Your kiss today was very good.
Give me another one. l'll go.
What happened to you?
Disturbing me at 1 am, go away.
Kiss me, l'll go away.
Why are you troubling me?
You achieved something great, l kissed you. ls there anyone else pregnant in Home? ls this maternity ward?
What do you want me to achieve now?
Tell me.
Catch the mosquito that bit me now.
That's all?
Who bit Sana?
Not me. l was in Cooum. l'm West Mambalam mosquito.
- Rangooski is from Anna Nagar.
- Who is this Rangooski?
- Me!
- Did you bite Sana?
Yes l did. So what? l've bitten Tamil Chief Minister also.
Come with me and seek her forgiveness.
Seek forgiveness?
Fulfill my three wishes, l'll see then.
Tell me your wishes.
Number one, l want AB negative blood, very rare, difficult to get.
Siva in my lab belongs to that group only.
He always belittles me.
Suck as much blood as you want.
Number two, ban all the companies manufacturing mosquito repellents.
They are disturbing us a lot.
- Third wish?
- Announce us as National Bird.
Fool, you're not a bird.
You're an insect.
Getting late, will you come with me or not? l'll not come. lf you don't come now, l'll exterminate all of you.
Hey who is it? How dare you enter our area and threaten to kill us!
How many we'd killed with malaria, dengue and chikungunea, forgotten it?
Let's show him our power!
- Hey Dengue Lakshmi!
- Sister!
- Hey Cholera Jasmine.
- Sister.
Attack him!
Sister, he's very strong.
Cholera Jasmine broke it's sting biting him. ls it?
- Enter his mouth at right moment.
- Okay sister.
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi died getting electrocuted. l think this is something new like electric mat.
Let's back off like when we faced the first repellents, later on we can come back and have a ball.
You can take Rangooski with you.
Thank you.
Look Sana, the mosquito which bit you.
Rangooski.
- Rangooski, say sorry to Sana.
- Sorry.
Never again dare come near Sana, warn your people.
- Yes boss.
- Go!
Kiss me now.

Welcome Mr. Birmingham.
Okay, l'll call you later.
Hello.

Birmingher- Arms dealer
Shah - Arms agent
Many terror groups want to use robots for destruction, suicide missions instead of men.
They are ready to pay any price, they've clients all over the world.
He wants to see your model.
Well, the prototype is ready.
And programming functionalities.
You can have a look at the design and some function modules in action.
There you are!
Great!
He wants 100 robots, March delivery.
Your advance.
That's a deal.
Please be seated.
Would you like to have...
What happened to my robots? lt's almost ready, Mr.Birmingham.
You should've delivered by now as per the contract.
You're still showing the skeletons. lntense testing is on. l'm fine tuning it to zero defect. l request you to give me one more month extension.
We are disappointed.
3rd April is your deadline.
Hope you understand.

Wait...wait...why that one too? l'll also present a gift to Sana.
- l'm giving it, right?
- l'll also give one.
- Who will pay for it?
- You pay.
Why?
Salary for my work.
We don't pay salaries to machines.
Are we paying salary to car and fridge? l'm not a machine. lf you don't pay salary, l'll strike work. l'll take a vow of fasting by not charging for a week.
Looks like you'll ask for a credit card too.
No need, l've your credit card number. l can sign like you.
Can't take it anymore.
Pack both.
Super!
Okay?
- Who will drive the car?
- You! l'm on leave today.
My bad time!
50 kg Taj Mahal is all mine...
Watch the road and drive.
Happy birthday Sana.
- Many more happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Hi Sana!
Chitti! You look great!
Thank you.
With today it's 200 thousand hours you've been on earth.
To the world's most beautiful girl.
Chitti, you're giving gift...so sweet!
Wow! This is awesome!
Mother, help me.
- How is it Vasi?
- Very nice. lsn't it nice? l love it, Chitti. Thank you. l too have given you a similar necklace.
Anyway gift from Chitti is special, right?
Happy birthday to you!
Can l've your attention please? l've an announcement for you. l'm proud to announce that l'm the lucky man this birthday girl's going to marry.
Folks! lt's time to dance, get start to move.
Girls please.
- Come on Vasi, let's dance.
- No...no...l can't.
Come.
Come.
- Shall we dance?
- Yeah! Sure.
Hey this is grandpa's music, let me have some blast please.
Sure!
Rascal! What are you up to? l wanted to kiss Sana, l did.
Don't you know it's immoral to kiss another's girl friend. l know, it's in the rule list. l felt like defying it.
Wrong, you mustn't come near her.
Why?
Because she's my lover. l too love her.
Don't talk like a fool.
That's not real.
You're just a machine.
Yes but a machine with emotions of happiness, sadness, love and anger.
Emotions for you is given as intelligence, it was for you to understand the situation and behave properly, and not to misuse it. l like this, l want Sana.
Dot.
What are you saying, Chitti? l'm going to marry her.
You marry some other girl.
You can't do this Chitti. l created you, this is known as betrayal.
You can do this, Vasi.
You gave up your love for research, that's known as sacrifice. l'll thrash you. lt'll not pain me, you'll feel the pain.
- l'll dismantle you.
- l don't like it.
What did you say you rogue rascal?
Vasi, clam down.
Chitti, please listen to me.
You're so patient, why is he scolding me?
No, l'll fondle him.
- Tell him to keep quiet.
- Bloody!
Chitti, please understand.
Though you've emotions, love between a machine and a girl is impossible.
Why not? ln what way l'm inferior to humans. l'll take care of you better than him, Sana.
He's talking foolish and you're listening to him.
- Tell him not to interfere.
- ls he so great?
Vasi, please.
He can't cook, l can cook 25 different types, l can sing lullaby in 32 languages to put you to sleep.
He'll get old, his hair will turn gray, he'll die. l'm eternal. l'll keep you happy till last, Sana.
- l didn't mean that.
- Then? Sex? ls life nothing but sex?
- ls it not love without sex?
- Not that, Chitti.
Then? Child?
There are many impotent in lndia, aren't they living happily by adopting children?
- Not that, Chitti.
- What else then?
Whatever you do is against the nature, Chitti.
Neither you've birth nor death, no hunger, infact you don't belong to the living organism.
Only humans can love between themselves. l love Vasigaran.
You're like my best friend.
Only humans find it difficult to forget, it's easy for you, Chitti.
Won't it take just a second to erase memories about me?
Erase it, Chitti.
Erase me of your memory.
Who is it?
Your friend Prof.Bora speaking.
Why did you come now? l know you're hurt, l came to console you.
You're my boss' enemy, you chided and rejected me. l don't want to talk to you.
Hadn't l rejected you, you wouldn't have got these emotions of love, anger? l did good for you.
Vasigaran is illtreating you. l don't want to listen, you can go.
You're the most advanced robot in this world which can think and act.
He's using to cook, wash clothes and clean toilets.
What has he done for you in return?
Nothing! Nothing!
Had you been with me? l would've given you the highest regard.
You're polluting me.
Trying to make you understand your value.
You're bigger than man himself.
You've the right to desire anything in this world. lncluding Sana.
They say it's against the nature.
No, this is new to the nature.
- Sana loves Vasigaran.
- Let her do.
Won't they change in the course of time to love another man?
May be Sana will change and start loving you.
- lsn't it?
- Don't confuse me.
Tomorrow l've army evaluation, l need to run my diagnostics and trouble shoot.
Okay Chitti, all the best.
You'll get selected in tomorrow's army evaluation,
Vasigaran will get fame and money, he'll marry Sana and go to Kashmir on honeymoon.
You'll be in the same Kashmir firing...
...buns!
Who were you talking to?
Myself.
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?
Ready doctor.
Peak of human intelligence is this robot.
He's equal to 100 army men in speed, power and action.
He can protect the borders and attack the enemies too. ln short, he's a one man army. l'm dedicating him to the lndian army.
You must test it.
Can you spot HV36 hand granade?
Yes General!
Smart.
Can you bomb tent number 3 with that?
What is this?
Sana!
Chitti!
A virgin beauty who can make even computers to fall in love with her.
What? lf she touches machine will turn into human.
Human will turn into machine.
What is this, Chitti? Throw it.
Her tresses are black waterfalls!
Forehead is neatly cut moon.
Eyes are Bermuda Triangle where people get lost.
Lips are sleeping zebras.
Waist is small chair of toddlers.
Next...
Chitti, stop it.
What nonsense is this Dr.Vasigaran?
You said this robot will wage war but reciting poetry.
- l'm sorry.
- Friends, forget about guns and start praying dupatta, forget about canons and touch a woman's dress,
Why wars? Why these weapons?
Love will teach you to love enemies too.
All of you fall in love!
Chitti enough, don't embarrass me further.
No war only love!
Stupid scientist and stupid machine.
Waste of time.
You insulted me.
What is this doctor?
You've killed my ambition.
Doctor, don't hack me. l took care of you like my own son. l want to live.
Please don't harm me.
Please.
Rogue machines like you don't deserve to be in this world.
Get ruined!
What was my mistake? lt was my mistake to create you.
Did l ask you to create me?
Did l ask you to give me emotions?
Did l ask Sana to kiss me?
You did everything yourselves and when l want to live, you're killing me. ls itjustified?
Don't talk!
Leave me, l want to live. l want to love. l love Sana. l want Sana. l love Sana. l...love...
Forget it Vasi, l'm also sad.
Why are you still thinking about it?
What if you lose Chitti? lt's just a machine.
You're a great scientist.
You can create 100's of Chittis. l didn't take Chitti as machine. l brought you out to forget about it.
Why are you thinking about Chitti only?
You've to snub out of it.
Divert your mind. l thought Chitti is my lifetime achievement.
Oh God!
Come, let's go for a walk.
Are you coming to beach with me or not? l'm not coming, you carry on. lf you don't come now, l'll definitely break love this time. l'll just walk and make the first man l meet my boy friend.
Hello!
Hi!
Wait! Hello!
- What is your name?
- Pachamuthu.
Can you be my boy friend for today, Pachai?
One day boy friend?
Like one day Chief Minister, this is one day boy friend.
You're like butter and l'm like a piglet.
- How can l be your boy friend?
- Yes.
Thank you very much. l can't believe it. l feel like l've won a billion in lottery.
What have you got for your girl friend?
- Arrack and dry fish fry.
- Give me.
Cheers!
Smelly! lf you drink, it'll give kick. l'm scared. l'll have it then.
This will not work out, l'll go, Pachai.
Why are you holding my hand?
You lit fire of desire in me by saying one day boy friend, how can you walk away just like that?
He's my boy friend. l said thatjust to tease him.
- Leave me.
- Did you find me for that?
Fulfill my desire and go.
Leave me.
- What Vasi?
- Leave me.
Calling your man?
Let anyone come, l'll not leave you.
Vasi come!
Leave her...leave her...
She's my girl friend for today, come back tomorrow for her. l'll kill you. l'll cut you!
Police! Help... l know lG, look! l'll call and get you arrested.
Can l ever get such a beauty in my life? lt's not wrong to spend life in jail for her.
You call lG.
Had Chitti been here the scene would be different
He would've crushed his bones by now.
Why are you talking about Chitti now?
Vasi, do something.
- There's only one way for it.
- What?
One...two...three...
Run!

Unable to contact Chitti in virtual.
What happened?
Chitti bungled the army evaluation, he made mincemeat of him and dumped in dust bin.
We don't keep the garbage here.
By now they'd have dumped it outside the city.
Where?
- Perungudi.
What did you do to change his heart?
When shall l fix the marriage? l've not achieved anything, father. l'll create another robot... l'll stab you! if you talk about robot again.
Aren't you satisfied by breaking one TV?
Uncle, if you've auspicious thread, l'll tie the knot with him right now. l can understand your urgency.
Do one thing, exchange the rings now, fix marriage in next auspicious time.
Okay.
Help...help...take me to Prof.Bora...
Address, A/70 ...Colony. lt's a small world, Chitti. l want to live...l want to love... l love Sana.
Help me professor.
Please restore to my original shape. l want to live. l want Sana. l want your neural schema.
Take anything you want.
Restore me as Chitti.
Please! l'll do it, Chitti. Don't worry.
What's this new red chip?
This is not Chitti's.
This is Bora's touch.
Additional programming to Chitti from me, destruction program.
Why did Vasigaran gave it power and talent of 100 men? l've given it the destructive power of 100 men. ln short he's a demon now!
Butterflies in my stomach, why did you change him like that, Prof.?
Business, he's the test for my business.
Business? l'll get the money and
Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame.
Thank you Bora.
Have a good time, Chitti. l'm going to meet Sana.
Sana will not be at home.
- She'll be in Raja Muthaiah Hall.
- Why?
Vasigaran and Sana are getting married.
How come you're here, Chitti?
Upgraded, Version 2.0
Stop Chitti!
Though you forcibly take me, l love Vasigaran. l like to be his wife only.
Only if he's alive. lf you harm Vasigaran, l'll kill myself. l'm sparing him for you.
Car number TN-09-BB1 1
Madam, jump.
Hold my hand...
Jump!
Happy Deepavali folks!
What sort of a robot you've created? lt has killed so many police men and destroyed many things.
You're responsible for that damages.
We are registering case on you and take action.
Sir, this is not the robot l had created. l had broken into pieces and dumped in dust bin. l don't know how did this happen.
First we must find the robot and stop it. Tell us how to do it. l'll find out, that's my responsibility.
Give me a minute.
Why are you disturbing me?
What happened to you?
Your system has been corrupted. l must trouble shoot you, come to my lab with Sana.
No way, l don't have to follow your orders anymore.
- l had created you.
- You dismantled me.
We don't have anymore relationship. l'm going to marry Sana and start a new life.
- Don't disturb me.
- Don't talk foolishly.
After all you're a machine. l had created you and l can destroy too.
Come here with Sana.
Nobody can destroy me.
Sir, cash, cheque or credit card?
Gun!
Call all the police doing rounds in South Chennai, block all the roads from T.Nagar and ask them to check.
Chitti has robbed City Centre, cover all around Mylapore area.
- Go to Dr.Radhakrishnan Road.
- Okay sir.
Catch him...catch him...
Received information that Chitti has entered Ennore petrol filling station.
Robot is entering the harbour.
Good, maintain distance and follow him.
Coast Guard will take care of it.
We've gathered the pieces of blown up robot.
- This is not Chitti.
- What?
This robot is not my creation.
Parts are different. lt's confusing.
Robbed four different places at the same time.
All four places are in different corners of the city.
How could same person be in all the places? l suspect a man.
Oh God!
Nobody can destroy me.
Activate command mode. l'm CR2.
Speed 1 terahertz.
Memory 1 zetabyte.
- Command mode activated.
- What are you doing Chitti? l'm producing myself, it'll produce many like us.
2 will become 4 and
4 will become 8,
8 will become 16,
They are my servants.
- Soldiers and terminators.
- No. l'll not allow it. l'm not Vasigaran to ask for your approval, Bora. l'm Chitti.
Look Chitti, l've taken money from the dealers. lf l don't deliver robots in 2 days, they'll kill me.
Die!
Bloody betrayer!
How dare you go against your creator!
Chitti, delete all the programs you've created. lf not l'll cut her neck.
Don't try anything foolish.
Delete the programs.
Do it. l said get on with it.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Command executive, order us, we'll shoot him down.
No...no...he gave me boon. l'll kill him myself.
Robot occupies AlRD, kills the security guard, let's get across live to our correspondent who is right there at the scene,
Robot entered suddenly...
Ordered us to leave or threatened to kill us. lt killed the security guards who resisted.
There's tension in the air, a sense of panic and fear, has gripped the AlRD...
After robot took over AlRD, police asked people around there to leave for security reasons.
This is our palace. l'm the king here.
You're my queen. l've brought everything you like. l've brought everything you need.
This is our bedroom.
The place we'll spend together happily after our marriage.
Why are you blabbering same nonsense again? lt's impossible to marry you and be happy. lt'll happen, Sana. l'm prepared in all aspects to be your husband. l can give all the happiness which a man can give you.
Didn't get me? l'm creating an artificial cell.
We can pre-program and have baby as per our order. lf it's placed in your uterus, you'll give birth to the first baby born to a human and machine.
Robot sapiens!
Shall we begin my love? lt's waste to act like Seetha and saying yuck, you can't escape from here and nobody can come in to save you, you can't even commit suicide.
Even if you don't like, l'll place the artificial cell into your body.
After giving birth to the child, you've to surrender to me, no way.
Do you need to go that far? No!
Come, let's enjoy now itself.
Give a beautiful kiss to your great king, baby.
Come...come...come...
Come baby. Come...come...
Get permission from Electricity Board, cut the power to the area and time l tell you,
Get a similar petrol lorry like the one that was blown in harbour.
Fill it with water instead of petrol.
CR 42! lce cream.
Highness, dinner ready. l hear some sound form your system. l don't hear any sound. lt's so loud, isn't your microphone also not working?
There's some problem in your system. l'll fix it.
Sana, l'm Vasigaran. l've come like Chitti to meet you.
Terrible!
Vasi, take me away from here please. l'm scared.
Don't get scared, l've planned everything. l can't take you out from here without destroying Chitti.
But destroying Chitti is in your hands.
Ensure for next 24 hours that Chitti's concentrates only on you. l'll take care of the rest.
There's misunderstanding between robots, Commander.
What happened?
A different robot is delivering dinner to highness.
A different robot is repairing the CCD camera.
- Good news, Commander.
- What?
Highness had dinner.
She wanted to see you immediately.
Yes sir.
Switch it off.
What happened?
Wow!
Beautiful!
The best two things ever created by man.
One is me and another is you.
What a pleasant surprize!
How did you change like this, Sana? l've understood now that your love for me is true. l can't believe it. l remembered everything from beginning, you've helped me a lot, how affectionate you were on me, other than loving me, you haven't done any wrong, even after you were broken into bits and pieces, you came back again for me only, really Chitti, l'm impressed.
How nice it's to hear this, Sana.
At the same time l've a doubt if this is any plan to betray me.
Can anyone dare cheat you, Chitti?
This is Vasigaran's engagement ring.
Wow! Thank you. l'm yours!
Mention his name and his greatness...
Even seas will clap...
His stature is so tall that it'll hit the moon...
Hey beauty...world beauty...
This machine is the best creation...
Lion...lion... l'm equal to 1000 lions...

What happened to power?
No power for long time, Commander.
Why didn't you switch on the generator?
Commander, somebody has poured water instead of petrol...
Shit!
Hey what are you doing?
Don't come near, l'll shoot you.
What's this childishness?
Home Ministry
Hello! l'm sorry sir. l didn't expect our plan to fail so miserably.
There's only one way to distract Chitti, just do as l tell you.
- Did Vasigaran come here?
- No.
Lie! Human nature, you taught me.
Have you forgotten it?
Your body language says you're lying.
Trust me Chitti, no. l think it's mine.
Why not say it's mine?
Yours is O+. That's AB-
He came here.
No, a different robot delivered dinner to you, camera didn't function for 10 minutes, your sudden change of attitude, power cut, water in the generator,
Vasigaran is here only.
Are you trying to cheat me, Sana?
No Chitti. l love you which you said is lie, right?
Trust me, Chitti.
Do you really love me?
Yes.
Then Vasigaran mustn't be alive.
Come, let's kill Vasigaran.
Soldiers assemble!
Soldiers! We've a Trojan.
A black sheep has entered here to destroy us from within. l must find and sacrifice it.
Who is the black sheep?
Dr.Vasigaran, if you surrender, l'll kill you painlessly. lf l find you, your death will be horrible.
Robot!
Yeah...yeah...come...come...come...
Sad! l think Vasigaran is not here, Sana.
Yes...yes...
Touch one of the two.
Then, Vasigaran is here only.
What happened, Sana?
Are you feeling giddy?
Now, you will feel giddy.
Soldiers! Rotate your heads!
Black sheep!
Stop!
He's the Trojan.
No...no...down..down...
No.
You said l had created you and destroy too.
Now, you're going to die in my hands.
What are you looking at?
This is hand gun l made it myself.
Hand made. ls it good?
Where should l shoot you? ls it brain which wants to kill me? ls it heart where my love Sana resides? l must shoot the brain which wants to kill me.
Sana, come..
Fire!
Fire!
Get that robot.
Place it here.
May l come in?
Start the car!
Yes!
Move!
Shoot man
Fire!
Start the vehicle. Come
Don't stand, run
No!
Hundreds of murders,
200 victims are in critical condition, public property worth billions has been damaged,
Dr.Vasigaran, you're responsible for all this, with awarding death penalty to you and closure of your lab. we are closing ourjudgement
Can l speak now?
We can't accept machine as witness. l'm not witness, l'm evidence.
Law will not accept it. lt will, according to the section 3 of evidence act 1872, an evidence can be material, or documentary.
You may proceed.
First l want to tell you clearly one thing, your honour. lf a machine goes wrong and someone dies, it's not a murder. lt's an accident.
Next, Vasigaran is not responsible for all the accidents.
Professor Bora.
What's this new story?
You honour, Professor Bora is not alive.
This is an attempt to twist the case. l've evidence, your honour.
This is not Chitti's.
Additional programming to Chitti from me, destruction program.
Why did Vasigaran gave it power and talent of 100 men? l've given it the destructive power of 100 men. l'll get the money and
Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame.
The evidence produced is very important.
This court frees him as innocent accepting that evidence.
At the same time, this robot's extraordinary powers, there's a possibility that it can turn against humans at any time, and there's a danger of anyone misusing its power, it may be useful in the future, since such robots are not necessary for the present times, this court bans robots from usage.
This robot should be dismantled in the presence Magistrate and Commissioner, and the parts should be removed and make it unusable, and inform this court.
Dismantle it.
You need any help, doctor.
Dismantle yourself, Chitti.
Sure doctor.
Siva..Ravi...you said you've something which l don't have, did you see how many problems we'd to face for it? l said about feelings.
Please don't cry, son.
What's your son saying sister? l've named him after you, Chitti.
Name given by mother.
Educate him well.
Robotics, good scope in future.
Like you inserted a red chip in me, many people are moving with red chips of selfishness, betrayal, cheating.
Good, l wasn't born as human.
Can't dismantle at the thought. l've tortured you a lot. l'm extremely sorry, Sana.
Why are you all sad?
May l crack a joke?
They say who ever falls in love loses his nuts.
Did you see? l lost it. l'm going to miss you, Sana.
Not as boy friend but as toy friend.
Doctor, you're my God. l tried to betray you.
Breaking rules is wrong.
Please forgive me.
No Chitti, you learnt to break the rules from humans.
The mistake is notjust yours.
Thank you doctor. l'm feeling good, doctor.
What you are seeing is Chitti, the most advanced
Android Humanoid Robot.
20 years earlier Dr.Vasigaran created it. lt was dismantled for some reasons.
Why?
Because l started to think.
Okay Chitti, let's go to the next section.
Stay away!
What's going on here, hell!
Drop the gun! Now!
Drop the gun!
Vanguard here first

Alene, you and Dr Miller set their areas of operation.
Rachel and I'll go first
Mièelovog to camp.
We remain in communication.
Here you go... When you should be.
What is it?
Why do you expect tribal drums now?
- Do not touch!
- It looks fresh.
- 2, maybe 3 days old.
- Is it oil?
Better question is...
Who is this done?
These are the scarecrows.
And already something of intimidation.
This is a warning.
- What would the "no animals"?
- The birds are coming through the wind.
Looks like organic decay, but I have never seen anything like this.
When you put things can do a few tests.
- It's not a bird, Ray.
- Alena, stay here.
Help Dr Miller on everything.
- So you go back?
- Yes, before it gets dark.
Your boss has my number.
Well, I guess I'll see you when I see you.
Yes...
I hope you'll find your team.

Here is...
Everywhere!
We have to leave the island.
MIEE, what is it there?
What happened here?
I killed a lot of birds.
But there were not enough.
It's okay.
With us.
- We need to go to this island.
- It's OK MIEE, we'll go.
But first we must find out what happened.
It is a doctor, can you help.
You're not listening.
Leads me to this island, now!
Vile!
- Blank said.
- I have not finished.
That's it.
Let's go back to the boat.
We must take him to hospital.
All we want you to know as soon as I calm down.
But now, all you have to take from this island.
You are all my responsibility.
We have not yet found his partner Walsh.
Dead. He's dead.
All dead.
Well... go!
Sophie...
You're not a captain on the island.
This is my mission.
We remain where we are.
You want maybe to vote?
Maybe she's right, Ray.
I can take care of MIEE and here.
Trying to understand...
Well... Sophie... Alene
Take MIEE back to camp.
Rachel and I'll continue searching.
Villas, I'd like to stay.
This is your team, obviously that is not mine.
I'll be on board until you need them.
You'll all die!
- There could preæi trees.
- Line ravens...
You must be joking!
Where is your ship èovece?
Damn, what we do now?
We must find him!
Maybe... maybe in the bay.
We could swim to it.
We will not swim anywhere.
We would not have withstood the twenty minutes in the icy waters.
Well sir!
What is the hell was that thing?
What they did on this island, and what we actually do here?
Well.
Be honest, we stuck here?
Can we use your satellite phone to send a call for help?
Yes, now razmišijaš reasonable.
- Let it switched on.
- If anyone catches a signal.
The no-fly zone are!
No one listens to the conversation has over the radio here.
In Mièevom camp
There transmit.
Is directly linked to
Altracorpom.
I'm not right back there.
Falls.
- Here we are safe.
- We can go in the morning.
- Završiæemo search...
- Your search is over!
You saw what it did your man.
I am sure that neither his partner did not have much more luck.
There are a lot of important information that we have to pick up. Especially now.
So what do you want to do?
To sit and we wait The boat fishing?
We have a schedule of 48 hrs.
No one would not suspect anything, at least 36 hrs.
See... if we can turn on the transmit...
... Spasilaèki team will come here for about 20 minutes.
When we look at the situation, it seems to me that we do not have much choice.
Still nothing.
Do not.
Says nothing.
Just sitting there.
It may not be manifested kroy inorganic matter.
Sand.
Sand is a dead zone.
Can not preæi beach.
Or water.
Therefore, it is like to Mièel leave the island.
Captured here.
Just like me.
Pretty good, right?
It seems quite complicated for doctor.
Well... I knew exactly what to pack so I packed everything.
Yes, women usually make it.
So...
Clarify me.
Do you know what are they doing here?
Not quite.
Some kind of biological research.
48th Test
Ray is worried that the team neèime infected, so...
Rachel understand...
It is like a razor.
But you, why did you bring?
Jingo!
Just have nice properties.
Yes, that's what I, at least you get what you see.
Maybe you do not like, but at least is honest.
But all of this... And Ray...
I'm not sure.
Add to paranoid traits.
- At least a traitor is not entered in the list.
I? You're wanted to leave us all here!
- "Call me when you need it";
- I was there when I needed you, did I?
Forget it, ma'am... Doctor.
I have not signed up for this shit.
I also dream about the future disappears this family.
Listen Villas, you have to pull together.
This is a profession we have chosen.
You were his superiors.
It was your responsibility.
This is not the first time that I lost a man.
And they will not be the last.
It seems that things gledas's different since you got these lines on the shoulder.
- Published by're Briggs.
- Who brought everyone else!
You were not allowed to bring us into this situation!
We did not have any information, no support...
Watch what you are saying, soldier!
It seems to me that you're happy because you progressed on the list.
Well congratulations... Sergeant.
No matter is that one of your people returns home in the ark.
It could be worse.
I could be your mother's front door.
You can thank me on it.
Do not enter.
Find his own transportation.
Reje!
What happened?
- It was all around him.
- Get away.
Ray, what was it?
I'm really sorry.
We are not even supposed to come here.
There was no possibility to know what's in the woods.
This is not true.
Raymond!
What is it, reje?
What is going on here?
All this is a setup.
Rachel and I work for Altracorp.
At least not anymore.
So what do we do it here reje?
I worked in biological research in Altracorpu, renewable energies.
I am a scientist.
Funding we abolished when they find deeper pockets.
They took my work...
... And use it for things that
I did not want uèestvovati.
Biochemical weapons is much better of the virus.
And is it there?
Some kind of biochemical weapons?
I do not know what it is!
I'm not sure even that Altracorp know.
Something went wrong with their tests there.
Mièel gave me some information recent months.
48th Test
I knew something was wrong.
I had no idea...
- And we're dragged into it!
- I had to get back at MIEE.
You saw why!
See, whatever it is there...
That thing...
... Nesreæni the case.
Consequence of the enterprise in bad faith.
And now you know.
I'm sorry.
And what can we do?
Beach is not safe and do not have no way to defend ourselves.
We need information Mièeve how would we know we are against What for...
... First we need weapons.
If the organic...
... In any way...
... Then he will not appreciate this.
Not at all.
Come on! Accelerate it!
- Do you work?
- I do not know. No antenna.
We do not need. Povezaæemo it with Vilovo satellite phone.
We have it.
Rachel, you and Will you return to the beach.
Run it engine.
Prepare it.
- I want to stay with the radio.
- I need you for the PC.
Stay here.
I found it!
- Do what you need.
- I do.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Continue to walk.
Let's see if that works.
Goal!
- Find test 48th
- I know, I know...
If you watch this video...
... Test 48, did not go according to plan.
Here, Vanguard 1,
Do not come here.
I repeat:
Do not come!
Mièel.
I suppose you this message never arrived.
Can we go now?
I have to stop.
We must not stop.
We have to move! Come on!
I'll overtake you.
L'll these ice from the refrigerator.
'll Be right back.
Rachel!
What's happening?
Well, if you do that?
It would be good to have the original...
Forget the torch, let's go!
Where are they?
Where the hell!
Rachel! Where is she?
Where is it?
Where the hell?
Something happened to her...
- What happened?
- Is infected!
Let me go!
Hey man,
There was nothing I could do.
Reje is infected.
Some sort of weapon.
Dispersed.
In order... Now we can defend ourselves.
Poèeæu Mièelovim to work on files.
I'll see what I can piece down.
There it is.
Part of the miracle... Somewhere.
Iskoristiæe her to come here.
We must be vigilant.
Do you think it's gonna be okay?
I was guilty of this.
Have you all taken?
Should be sufficient to think to work for Altracop.
Were there any problems with the provision?
Nothing that I could not fix it.
What files?
Did you take them?
Mièel had done his part.
You have a lot of reading ahead.
Go take a shower.
This is...
This is an SOS.
Please check and reply.
Reception.
Wait.
This is a call for help.
Called at intervals.
Just keep an open channel to hear if someone replies.
Be there and listen.
This is an SOS.
Please reply.
Please.
Have you solved the mystery?
Seems to have worked on Altracorp new kind of biological weapons.
On a live weapon.
And this one that destroys all other living creature.
So the goal and the infection spreads Cells like a virus.
The infection is supposed to be reserved isotope which...
... Is similar to that found in raspršivaèu.
Good soldiers can be move freely...
... Bad soldiers, become black and sticky.
- It is obvious that something went wrong.
- Very.
Disease has not only infected Cells, completely took over.
It'll be a living is like hives in which
All Cells are working together...
... This disease is the same principle.
But just as it fulfills its purpose ..
... Which is it?
To infect and destroy?
That is expanding continuously;
That's about it to.
- What kind of doctor are you?
I am a toxicologist.
Specialist I for reverse engineering.
It is pretty specific to the field of for a rescue mission.
And you are in this from the beginning, right?
See, I did not know what happened here.
We have not told you about your safety,
We know you'll stay with us.
And when I saw how you reacted
Rejevu the story last night...
... I just did not want to just think about me.
- And Allen?
- We knew the same as Ray.
To test something Altracorp horrible here.
Something that must be stopped.
These are experiments that are not allowed to continue.
Someone has to take on that responsibility.
See how much it cost.
I tried to protest.
To do something.
But instead I... released.
They did so in order take my research.
... To do this.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this Villa.
But do not blame her.
I am the job.
And God knows that I paid a high price...
... But I have to finish this.
Now more than ever.
I must not let this thing beat.
You know, Captain Ahab said the same thing.
You know how to take care of yourself,
It is pretty and you're good at it, Villas...
... But as you are in a broader perspective?
Did you used to be sacrificed because of little something for what you knew was right?
This is called purpose.
Something you believe.
Something to fight, regardless of price...
... Because you know that this is the right thing to be done.
I believe that we're doing the right thing.
Do you believe that you did the right thing by telling me this information?
Yes, sir.
- But the mission was successful, right?
- Not for my men, sir.
Your people?
You think people sergeant Cutter.
Its mission, his decision.
Whatever the motives that had,
In your mišIjenju...
... Will remain just that.
Your mišIjenje.
Success is measured in this world the two things.
Through perseverance and dedication.
Are you devoted razogu, rows?
Do you think that doing the right thing?
There. We found the reason.
Sergeant Kater has released its people by you sent them...
That's enough!
Faces I have a dilemma soldier.
Your word against your word superior officers.
Yes, Sergeant Kater was already here...
He explained his work...
... And your reckless disregard his orders!
I will not tolerate disloyalty!
Neither the army, nor our purpose.
As of this moment is dismissed, the soldiers.
The decision is effective immediately.
Do not say anything because
What for are you going to repent, my son...
I want to be the Next helicopter here! Do you understand me?
You go... civilian.
What about crows? With coffee?
Completely collapsed.
Dead. In order to reverse the process
I need a live specimen.
I doubt that this thing will want to cooperate.
Maybe a little something to testiralištu we could use.
We must try something.
Rachel is still there.
It is not Rachel.
Now a part of it.
Infected. As Mièel.
But not dead.
Exactly!
If infected, and if the live...
... I might have with the help of her blood could create a serum.
It could work.
Mièel said all the chemical elements...
... And I could use the pollen from raspršivaèa one that you have found.
What do you need from me, reje?
Let us go and we find Rachel.
There is somewhere.
Watching us.
I know. Keep walking.
That's it.
I made a similar device based on their designs.
This is an underground station.
Injects a toxin into the center of the island.
Should we reverse the process if we use the serum.
Then keep scrolling.
There you go. There is no one around to we share with them.
Do you see anything?
Still nothing
Rachel!
Ray will not come.
I have it!
Holds it firmly!
Sorry about that.
Postaviæemo machine drain.
Right back up before dawn.
Call us through this if you manage to make a serum.
I did it! Functions.
- You serious?
- I think.
I used her natural antibodies doskoèim to infect...
... Using a similar chemical mixture that of a gun...
Molecular... irrelevant.
It was successful in small doses.
We need a bigger sample.
Throw it on the enemy and hope that will not expand.
Does not sound like a smart idea brilliant minds.
We plan a way of control.
A similar spray from that weapon.
Soldiers would take a pill, a bookmark...
... Which would then developed resistance the infection.
- How is it changed?
- Everything has changed for the worse.
Ready.
Hurry!
I know... I try!
Rachel?
O God!
What the hell?
What happened?
- This thing...
- How do you feel? Are you okay?
I do not know.
Why am I tied?
- I do not believe it!
- Works!
It's quick, but you returned to normal.
You need water.
Alene, she does it.
- I need to call Ray.
- It is? Thank goodness.
- I'm sure you this is surprising.
- What are you doing?
And now we are alone.
I have to admit Doctor, impressed
I. I did not think you'll succeed.
And now... Give me the rest...
We both know that this is not the whole sample.
You think I'm stupid?
Let's... the tent.
To take it all.
Take...
Or do you want me to ask?
I have other plans, but...
This can be useful.
- You're pushed boat.
- I'm guilty of this.
I could not allow anyone to go here before I finish.
I even saved the life of Rey,
I really needed it to complete its mission.
Why?
I have to finish their testing.
49th Test
Latest invention, the control group.
- Keep them at bay
- You were not in danger.
No.
I was just a good actor.
Now you just need one more thing to do.
Should I put my sample in Rejevu gadget.
He came to my turn to infect.
Sorry for this doctor.
Nothing personally,
All this is just a job.
Is that what you think it is?
Potpredsednièe, I know that your time is valuable...
... Because I'll be brief.
Doctor Raymond Hua I was just contacted in connection with one mission ..
Ray is planning a trip to the island Meyer.
Wants to shake up things a bit.
This is not good for you sir potpredsednièe Vesler?
I want to help, but require protection Altracorpa.
No doubt you want the money.
It would be very nice of you.
May undermine its operation from the inside...
... And can provide you what you want.
What I want to?
49th Test
Allen is a radio set in the dead zone.
He now works.
Someone will soon appear.
In this case, we'll begin.
Thank you.
What for?
No one has saved his life so far.
- And how was it?
- It was very nice!
Here SES 1, we receive a call for help on this channel.
- Here we are!
- Hello!
Here, Dr Sophie Miller.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear Dr Miller.
Thank God!
Signal are read your site Alfa 9th
In the forbidden zone are.
Prepare for evacuation.
Arrive in 20 minutes. Reception.
We have them.
Wait! We do not have too much time
To start the test.
Are you kidding? Tell that to the guys when they come.
They will not understand.
We need to do now.
But they come in 20 minutes Ray.
Then do not waste time anymore.
Ray, spasiæe us.
His struggle to carry Altracorpa, to the media...
... Tell them what happened here.
You do not have to take the chance your life...
To take the chance?
Look what I've been lost.
Nothing will not to mean if you do not finish what I started!
What we've begun.
I can not afford to reje they have done.
Stop!
It's your fault...
Do not leave Rachel...
- Is The vial!
- There is something much worse.
Going to testiralište.
But the soldiers come in 15 minutes!
Sophie, wait back here.
The team is coming very quickly.
Go to Allen.
Villas...
... I could use your help.
Yes, it is always the case.
Listen...
Let's go.
This way, we're going.
You end launch and stop Allen.
And you?
I'm going to play around with the locals.
Hey, Roršak!
I'm here!
Run!
It is almost Alene!
Not yet...
It's over!
Not until I tell you!
You should know something about the persistence of Ray.
But one should know when to quit.
Back to work.
Provide the beach!
Faster, faster!
Check the tent!
Tent was empty.
Contact in 12 hours.
Go!
I'm sorry Ray. 're Just late.
What did you do?
Something the release here.
Something much stronger than what they thought...
... And now it's mine!
You can not control it.
Come with me.
Come with me!
I feel better.
What's happening?
I do not know. Come on.
Where the serum?
With Allen.
Run!
My move.
We go from here?
Alfa time,
What's your status?
Command, Alpha team leader here.
Saved as we move back.
Air support may take.
Again, air support can go!
Alfa understand, start with Clay.
Air support is coming.
The boat enters the!
All you all right?
Here they are!
We still have not finished here.
Where is Sophie?
I told you.
Good. Very well.
Talk with her...
Same as with you.
Story?
Does this so called?
Tell me again why I can not let from here? Why I am here a prisoner?
It is very pesimistièan view.
And you call me that?
A detainee in the fight.
Uèestvovali you are in a very unusual event.
We have to take precautions.
I told you everything.
I am not infected.
Does not work like that!
Look at us as enemies.
I do not blame you for that.
If I were in your place, as I thought!
Someone watching us?
Yes, it is always the case.
In whatever you believe,
And do you believe...
... We are not the enemy.
Then why are my hands tied?
And where is Sophie!
I want to see it.
The victims in this life must always submitted, Mr. Kane. For the greater good.
Do you ask me to join you?
Are you kidding?
I will not do it!
Can you hear me there?
I will not be part of this!
I will not be part of this!
You've been...
So there are no side effects?
None.
Are you sure about this?
There are no side effects.
Mr. Kane has already infected 72 hours and shows no adverse effects.
It is completely healthy.
I did not ask on the subject of testing.
I asked you about the infection.
Test 49 was a complete success.
Congratulations, doctor.
There is darkness...
... and there is light.
There are men and women.
There's food.
There are restaurants.
Disease.
There's work.
Traffic.
The days as we know them.
The world as we imagine the world.
Hey.
Hey.
How would you feel about heading home?
I've only just fallen asleep.
Well, you have, I haven't.
I have a tough time sleeping with someone else in the bed.
Are you kicking me out?
I have to go to work soon anyway.
We dance and drink all night, we go back to your place, you fuck me and now you wake me up and kick me out?
I can't sleep with another person in the bed.
- That's funny.
- That's just the way it is.
I didn't know you'd started smoking again.
What do you feel like doing?
Throwing stones.
At what?
Seagulls.
Sweetheart.
- You'll find someone.
- Shut up and throw.
I suppose I should go back to work.
Come on.
Poor baby.
Lebanon?
Morocco.
Morocco.
Now that's funny.
- What's funny?
- Seeing you today.
Hilarious.
Come with me for a minute, will you?
They want us at the hospital.
Aren't you going to ask why I haven't been to work?
- Well, you've been sick.
- Not sick, just unhappy.
Well, it's the same thing.
Unhappy on account of a man.
No kidding?
So what are we wanted for?
Er, to see a patient.
- Why?
- What's going on?
Well, we're just going to find out.
- You know he's really pissed off in there.
- Excuse me.
When can I take him back home?
Oh, well, we just need to talk to him, so...
- He needs to explain it all again?
- Well...
Look. Look, listen.
He called me up, right, and he told me he was coming home... and then all of a sudden his voice breaks and he bursts into tears.
Mm-hm.
And then he starts telling me that he doesn't see any meaning to life.
I mean, he's not usually like that.
He's a truck driver.
OK.
And then he pulls over at the side and says he's fine again.
- Except, he cann'ae smell any more.
- He can't smell any more?
Well, I told him to find a hospital because, you know, that isn't normal, is it?
Hello, er... Donald.
Stephen Montgomery here again.
- Hi, I'm Susan.
- Hello, Stephen. Hello, Susan.
- You can't smell any more?
- That's right, Susan.
I can't smell any more.
But is your mood back to normal?
I've been sitting here for nearly
11 hours. My mood is not great.
But you don't feel any discomfort other than a lack of smell?
No, Susan.
And has anybody else in your family or at work had similar experiences?
I haven't got a clue cos I'm sitting here, aren't I?
- What do you want from me?
- I just want your opinion.
I'm an epidemiologist, Stephen.
So why am I talking to this guy?
Cos we've got seven more just like him in Aberdeen.
Five in Dundee.
11 right here in Glasgow.
18 in Edinburgh.
There's over 100 reported cases in England.
They've got them in France,
Belgium, Italy, Spain.
They've all appeared in the last 24 hours.
How were they infected?
I'm not sure they are.
Meaning?
Well, all the early indications suggest no connection between them at all.
No contact. No pattern. Nothing.
Is my wife still out there?
Let me speak to my wife.
Please, let me speak to my wife.
Maybe it'll just go away.
- So we won't panic.
- Hm.
Michael, that's a table of 12 just sat down.
- Where are they, at the bar?
- Yeah.
Where's that lobster and haggis?
I need that right now.
- That's table five, mains.
- You're an arsehole.
- What's the matter with you?
- What?
- Those starters for table seven...
- That girl was such a sweetheart.
- What girl?
- "What girl?"
You just fucked her and dumped her, didn't you?
- Poor little baby.
- Theresa, where's those salads?
OK, one oysters, one soup, an antipasti, two duck and a steak rare.
Yes, Chef.
I'd have made her breakfast.
Strawberries, heated the milk for her coffee.
But they don't want to fuck the nice guy.
They want to fuck the arsehole.
- Next two checks at the same time.
- Yes, Chef.
How about those ravioli, boys?
How long on those?
- Three minutes, Chef.
- Right, right, right.
- Chef.
- OK, how do we know it's fresh?
- We smell it?
- No, check the eyes.
They should be clear.
The gills should be red.
- It should be firm. And the smell?
- Fishy?
It can smell fishy.
But, if it does, it's not fresh.
It should smell like the sea.
Does it smell like the sea?
- Mostly smells of fish.
- Get me another fucking sea bass.
One day.
One day, son, you'll be in love.
And you'll be miserable.
Table seven. That's your karma.
- Hot pot!
- Truly in love and miserable.
Richard, I need that pot back!
Richard!
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Listen...
- Really?
- Do you want to come with me?
- Of course I do.
Great.
I can find someone else if you're busy.
Don't worry, it might not be that serious.
I'll call you as soon as I know more.
OK?
You wouldn't happen to have a spare cigarette?
- I'm on the phone.
- Who's that you're talking to?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a guy asking for a cigarette.
- OK, I better go.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- Hmm.
- OK, OK. Bye.
- Have you got a light?
How about board and lodging, while we're at it?
Nah, I don't even know your name.
Do you have one, though?
Shit.
Oh, dear.
I'm Michael.
I work in the restaurant there.
- All right, sailor.
- I'm a chef.
Good for you.
Come on, guys. What have we got?
We've checked all the Scottish cases but have no obvious matches.
No proteins mutating, no prions, nothing.
There's nothing to say it's a virus.
Nothing that matches anything we know.
But it's fair to say it isn't obviously contagious.
It's fair to say it's spreading.
OK.
Could be environmental, it could be a toxin we know nothing about.
It could be terrorism.
OK, so it's not a contagion.
I'll tell them... probably disappear in a short while and don't panic.
Maybe they put something in the water.
Overwhelmed with grief.
People are hit with all that they've lost.
Lovers they never had.
All the departed friends.
They think of all the people they've hurt.
First, overwhelmed with grief.
And then no sense of smell.
That's the disease.
They call it Severe Olfactory Syndrome.
SOS.
This is a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert.
But it's not a cause for alarm.
We stand ready for the arrival
of the first confirmed case of infection...
... the World Health Organisation's stepping to level five
doesn't automatically mean that the human race...
They say it isn't contagious.
But who dare believe that?
Nothing.
Well, shall we call it a night?
I don't know what the fuck we should call it.
Let's go chase some pretty ladies, huh?
- You chase, I'll pick up the pieces.
- I don't feel like it.
Come on.
You want to watch that, Rich.
That's what happens when you have too much high-class fanny.
He's been gorging himself on Europe's finest.
- I'm going to get the Entonox quick!
- What's that?
Entonox. Laughing gas. Saint Nitrous.
Patron saint of pastry chefs.
Richard, don't. It'll make you feel...
James, leave him alone.
- Ssh.
- James.
- I recommend it for you especially, sir.
- Put it back.
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.
Sniff my finger?
Yeah? I can smell that. Oranges.
Wrong. Balls.
Man down! Man down!
Quickly, evacuate! Evacuate!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- See you later, boss.
- Cheers, boys.
Good night.
- Keep smiling.
- Good night, James.
- Got your own smokes tonight, sailor?
- I'm still a chef.
My dad called everybody sailor.
He worked in the docks all his life.
He never went sailing anywhere but he called everybody sailor.
All right.
Even people he didn't know.
"Hello, sailor." "Goodbye, sailor."
Well, you can call me sailor, if you like.
Or Michael.
When I was a child,
I thought it was really embarrassing.
Now I'm doing it myself.
Are you hungry?
People aren't eating in restaurants these days and we've got a lot of spare food.
Hm.
This is... monkfish cheek.
Fish is my thing.
- Good?
- Mmm.
Mm.
- I'm a bit greedy when I eat.
- Oh, that's all right.
I had a disorder when I was younger.
Just trying to catch up.
So what do you do... when you're not eating?
- Death and misery.
- What?
I'm an epidemiologist.
I'll get you something sweet.
This is a mango jelly and chocolate macaroons.
And...
I didn't make these.
I can't remember what the fuck that's called, but it's got coconut in it.
God...
All that sailor stuff, it reminds me of him.
My dad.
I miss him so much.
We had so much fun together.
He could always make me laugh.
Hey... Hey.
I'll...
Let me get you...
Here. This is... This is clean.
Thank you.
OK.
Here, here. You're all right.
Do not stand so close. You never know.
- Oh, no, they say it's not contagious.
- We don't know.
It's just something we tell people.
Look... Would you... Would you like me to take you back to your home?
Yeah? Come on.
You take the cloth. I'll get the...
Come on, come on.
Oh...
- Hey.
- It's gone.
The smell.
All gone.
Well, I think I'll...
That was a crazy evening.
Yeah.
Good morning.
Mmm. Well, it has its benefits.
Yep.
We were in the Algarve once,
Maggie and me.
Came home, had a freezer full of food - there'd been a power cut.
Never smelt anything so disgusting in my life.
I'll never forget it.
Maybe you will.
Hm.
I've met someone.
- Oh, OK.
- I'm pathetic.
Mm-hm.
I'm not even sure I like him.
OK.
I actually think he's a smooth arsehole.
Now...
It'll probably come back.
But at the moment our customers won't be able to smell, so...
It'll be like cooking for snotty-nosed people.
Bring out the big guns, all right?
Maybe a bit of saffron.
Oregano.
Richard, can you get me a clean apple?
Life goes on.
The food becomes spicier...
... saltier...
more sweet...
more sour.
You get used to it.
The greater loss are all the memories that are no longer triggered.
Ooh-hoo!
Smell and memory were connected in the brain.
Cinnamon might have reminded you of your grandmother's apron.
The scent of cut hay could evoke a childhood fear of cows.
Diesel oil might bring back memories of your first ferry crossing.
Without smell, an ocean of past images disappears.
Whoa!
I'm off work.
Congratulations.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Any more news on death and misery?
Not really.
I was a really good smeller.
- I bet you were.
- I was.
Do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.
- Something else, then?
- Like what?
- Oh, er... are you hungry?
Nah.
I could cook you something special.
Or buy you a lollipop.
We could go for a coffee and eat apple pie and er... liquorice.
A glass of wine?
Some fresh air?
Come on.
My sister got married here a few years ago and I came to stay for a month and...
- Met a guy.
- And then a good job came up.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll call upon a new smell.
The scent of the forest after the spring rain.
We imagine the path underneath our feet.
We see the green moist colour surrounding us.
And we feel the wet branches against our faces.
And now imagine...
- Oh...
- We pass between the trees.
- I'm not going on my own. Come on.
- Oh, no.
And we begin drawing in the air.
Deep inside.
And enjoy the moment.
The humidity level is high.
At the lower end there is the moss, the fungi, the rotten leaves.
The middle tone is the tall, fresh grass.
A crisp and almost invigorating scent.
And at the top we feel not only the leaves and the rainwater, but also the sky.
On a day like this... we can smell the sky itself.
What shall we do now?
Well, now you could invite me back to your place.
Don't know if I will.
Well, you... you can just start walking home...
...and I'll follow you.
Oh.
Mm.
I should have made a bigger effort to sniff you the first time we were lying here.
Mm.
A pity.
What do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
Well, soon I'd like to close my eyes and try and go to sleep.
Which is a big deal for me cos usually
I... I can't sleep in bed with someone.
I need to be by myself.
OK?
- Now?
- Now, yes.
You want me to leave?
I live here, so I guess you'll have to.
- Now?
- Yes, please.
Did I say something wrong?
Ah... Let me give you my... card, in case you want to, you know... call me or something.
You have a card?
I had a catering company that didn't do very well.
Not very many clients. Lots of cards.
You can call me.
My number's on there, and my address.
And I guess you know where I work, so...
Repent, sinners!
The day of the Lord is upon you.
Do you know that this is the day of the Lord?
The prophecy has been spoken.
Do you pray?
Are you aware of your sins?
Come back and be aware.
This is the day of the prophecy!
Hello.
No flowers?
She loved flowers, Michael.
Ian got married... in a church with the full monty.
Eugh!
Apparently, she's pregnant, his bride.
And what about this Michael?
What about him?
He sounds nice.
I don't know.
I usually pick arseholes.
Well, they can't all be arseholes.
They just can't.
- I'm trying to take care of myself.
- Right.
You do that a lot, don't you?
Fuck you, sailor!
Can I have sweets?
Let me see.
Hmm...
- Ta-da!
- Whoo!
- What do you say?
- One for you and one for you.
Not soap.
Big Soap. Big Soap.
Apparently, Big Tobacco and
Big Fizzy Cola have formed this cartel to start selling - wait for it - fruity flavoured oxygen.
In order to create a proper market for it, they've enlisted Big Soap.
Big Soap have flooded the environment with enough organophosphates to temporarily disable your central nervous system.
That's why I've stopped washing... in case you were wondering what the smell was.
You don't half talk some shite.
Environmental groups are sure it's the start of an ecological apocalypse
caused by pollution and genetically modified plants and hormones.
Intelligence claims it's an attack on the free world.
All indicators point to fundamentalists.
The fundamentalists talk of God's punishment on a world of unbelievers...
and promise that all pure people of the right faith
will regain their sense of smell in the final days.
Others talk of the degenerate capitalist system
that has released a military virus to stimulate the economy.
And there are other theories.
Wake up.
There is so much hatred in the world!
There's so much hatred!
- Easy.
- So much hatred in the world!
- They're fucking plotting against us.
- Stephen, calm down.
They want to blow us up.
They want to destroy us.
Fucking so much...
- So much hatred.
- Ssh, ssh.
There.
So many sharp edges.
So many sharp edges.
- That's OK.
- Sharp things.
I've just given him as much sedative as I dare.
- So many sharp edges.
- It'll kick in in a second.
So many sharp edges.
- Normally so soft. We are so soft.
- It's all right.
Hey, are you all right?
I can't die alone.
I'm here with you. I'm Barbara.
I work in research.
- I've seen you in the canteen.
- That's how it'll end.
Without anybody loving me.
Come on, now, just calm down.
What's your name?
Oh, no.
See, the thing is, your body, OK?
It betrays... It betrays itself.
- Stop, Michael.
- No, no, listen.
Your body, it takes away the colour of your skin.
And... And betrays your... your spirit.
Michael, stop.
Can I get some water over here?
That's OK, it's OK.
Pissing and bleeding and fucking puss is coming out of your ear!
- There's no puss.
- I've seen it. I've seen it!
At the end, you're all alone.
Don't say that.
You die on your own and it gets all dark.
It's not true! Don't say that!
You're not on your own!
You're not on your own!
All your body, it turns... it turns to fucking soup.
First the terror.
Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Michael.
Don't leave me.
And then a moment of hunger.
Oh, my God. What's happened?
Oh, my God, what's happened?
What's happening?
This is how the sense of taste disappears from our world.
They don't even have time to give the disease a name.
Do you think we'll lose our other senses too?
Smell and taste are related.
They're the two chemical senses.
So the other ones might be all right, then?
They might.
Just have to wait and see.
That's right, sailor.
And what happens if you're wrong?
Then we're fucked.
Hey.
Hi.
It's still out there.
What is?
The world.
What can you see?
People.
What are they doing?
They're heading off to work.
What should we do?
We go to work as well.
Do we kiss each other first...
Maybe.
...say we'd like to see each other again?
We probably do.
Maybe even this evening.
Maybe.
And are we looking forward to that?
Yes!
I may not even have a job any more.
Forget it, Michael, we're closed.
We're closed.
We'll open again.
People can't smell, they can't taste.
They're going to buy flour and fat.
That's all you need to survive.
Take a hit on that. Go on. Go on.
Drink that.
Now, that is damned expensive brandy.
Damned, damned expensive.
But you might as well drink surgical spirit or sniff glue.
It doesn't matter.
Flour and fat.
- And yet it does matter.
- There's no difference.
No, I think you're wrong.
Life goes on.
They'll come back.
People will ask each other out to dinner again.
They'll toast each other while we take care of their needs.
- Yeah, and serve them flour and fat.
- No, anything but flour and fat.
We'll be all right.
Slowly things return to normal and life goes on.
People do what they did before as best they can.
Within a few weeks, taste becomes a distant memory.
And different sensations take its place.
In restaurants, it's all about offering another person dinner,
letting yourself be waited on,
listening to the trickle of wine and the clink of glasses.
"Not only has the food received special attention," but also the temperature of the food and its consistency.
And we tried it all, from the freezing cold to the scorching hot.
It was dry, it was moist, it was crisp, it was spongy, it was crunchy and it was all at the highest level, up to and including the dessert - a light pudding with caramelised knots and a bright orange sorbet,
"and a dark blue... dark blue coulis on blackberries and blackcurrant."
Chew on that.
Great.
Life goes on.
My dad let me shave him once.
I was eight.
I managed to do it without a single scratch.
I was very proud.
And then... he went to the sink and he shaved himself all over again as if I hadn't been there.
I was devastated.
Your turn.
Here, try. It's soft.
- Mmm.
- Yeah?
Mmm! Mmm.
- Want to go dancing?
- Sure.
- And get drunk?
- Sure.
- And smoke cigarettes?
- Always.
- There's still pleasures in the world, eh?
- Let's have them. All of them.
Here.
Oh!
I got soap in my eye!
No Voice Was Raised
# No-one sentenced us
Let's play a game, sailor.
What game?
It's called, "Make me special".
What are the rules?
Only one.
Just tell me something.
Something...?
Something other people don't know about you.
- Something secret.
- Like what?
# Unpoliced
My sister's got two kids and sometimes I hate them.
# We drew uncertain breath
# The loss piled high unchecked
I can't have children.
My ovaries are crippled.
My eggs are no good.
Because of not eating.
I pretend that I'm not that into them, that I have an interesting job.
Anyway...
...I can't have them.
Your turn.
# No-one jailed us
I had a girlfriend.
You don't get this game, do you?
No, we had erm... a wedding planned.
And she got sick.
She got really sick.
You could smell there was something wrong inside her, like something damp, something from a basement.
I didn't stay with her.
I didn't look after her, I ran away.
I make myself go and visit her grave.
At first it was once a week and then maybe it was once a month and now less.
I go there to feel guilty, you know?
I thought I would feel guilty for the rest of my life but...
...actually it's starting to fade.
# And no song was sung
- You're an arsehole?
- I am.
# No voice was raised
It works.
It works.
You're making me yours.
- I'm an arsehole.
- So am I.
A couple of arseholes.
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.
# No song was sung
So this is the situation here in Bangkok,
Thailand.
We call it Severe
Hearing Loss Syndrome,
and we still do not know much about it.
Anger, rage, hate.
And then they go deaf.
And how does it spread?
I can't hear you very well but I do not know what to do. Tell me what to do.
... standing there looking at me!
Why are you just looking at me?
You help us now!
... help us now!
... send some help quick!
Send some help now!
I think it's OK to panic now.
And that's basically what the world does.
Severe Hearing Loss Syndrome.
Spreads from Thailand,
across India to China,
Russia and beyond.
Rage.
Anger.
Hatred.
And then the loss of another sense.
All the unaffected can do is wait.
Ta-da.
- Can you still get film for those?
- Yeah, I got some from my uncle.
He was a collector.
What did he collect?
Polaroid cameras.
Here.
Incubation period is dropping all the time.
It's down from 24 hours to about 11.
It's very aggressive.
Yeah?
Yeah, we stick with the 2006 plan.
- Stephen.
- OK?
It's still valid.
Isolate the first ones, get ready for loads more.
They're saying a child was born in Berlin with all its senses.
There might be a chance of antibodies.
- What's going on?
- Somebody's infected on the third floor.
- They sealed it off.
- Who owns this restaurant?
- Me.
- You're shutting down.
- Give me a fucking break.
- Everywhere is shutting down.
The council wants to hire you and your staff to cook for the quarantined.
Thousands are holed up in their homes, sports arenas.
They all need to be fed three times a day.
- Here's your menu and budget.
- Municipal food?
Other restaurants will do it.
If you don't want the job, just say no.
- That's all I need to hear, a no.
- Aye, all right. We'll do it.
Aye, very moving.
You'll have us in tears in a minute.
- Fuck you.
- We're just trying to do our jobs.
- We're trying to keep things working.
- Bouillon and fusilli?
- Make sure that pasta's al dente.
- Fat and flour.
Fat and fucking flour.
You're homeless.
Shit.
Stay away from anyone showing symptoms of aggression.
You can choose between a gym full of those not infected out behind the bus station, or you can come home with me.
Tough one.
What?
Stay away from people showing symptoms of aggression.
Oh, Jesus.
So all of a sudden, we're living together.
Yeah.
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.
Hmm.
We could play
"make me special" games.
We could play at lovers.
And we could fuck.
But you're just like all the others.
Don't you think that you matter, cos you don't.
You're nothing.
You are just passing time.
It's not difficult to understand.
It's just fucking.
And eating. And fat and flour.
You go out there, you lie down on your back and spread your legs.
Or take your profound conversations and your emotions and fuck off.
You're just a pair of ears and a mouth, an arsehole and a cunt.
It might surprise you to know this but everyone else has that too.
A pair of ears and an arsehole.
Fat and fucking flour.
Nothing special about this one, except that she's infertile.
Fat and flour. Fat and flour!
Fat and fucking flour!
Fat and fucking flour!
Fat and flour!
Fat, fat, fucking flour!
Aargh! Oh, God!
Let me in! Let me in!
Take me with you. Hey!
Hey!
Come on, let me in!
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Pardon?
Seen anyone else?
I hope you can hear this.
Whatever I said to you, I didn't mean.
It wasn't me.
It was the disease.
It was not you.
It was not you.
It's not me.
It's nobody.
Nothing.
Nobody's here. Nobody.
No.
Disease. Which disease?
Where is it?
Where are you hiding, you fucking cunt?
Where are you?
I need you to come back to me.
Take that... Nothing!
I need you to believe me.
It's me.
Why? Why?
- Why?
- It's me asking you to come back.
Why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why?
- I love you.
- You're all fucking liars!
There are two movements now.
There are the people who run through the streets, grabbing all they can.
People who don't believe in anything but the end of the world.
Then there's the other movement -
farmers going out to milk their cows...
... soldiers reporting for duty.
Those who believe that life will go on somehow...
... or just don't know what else to do.
People prepare for the worst...
... but hope for the best.
They concentrate on the things that are important to them.
All the things beyond fat and flour.
Once we thought of the ice age as something that crept up -
glaciers slowly spreading...
temperatures gradually dropping.
But recently a number of intact mammoths have been discovered
with stomachs full of undigested grass.
The cold must have hit them like a blow from a club.
That's how the darkness descends upon the world.
But first the shining moments.
A shared flinching of the brain's temporal lobe.
A profound appreciation of what it means to be alive.
But most of all, a shared urge to reach out to one another.
To offer warmth...
... understanding...
... acceptance...
... forgiveness...
... love.
It's dark now...
but they feel each other's breath...
and they know all they need to know.
They kiss...
and they feel each other's tears on their cheeks.
And if there had been anybody left to see them,
then they would look like normal lovers caressing each other's faces...
... bodies close together...
eyes closed...
... oblivious to the world around them.
Because that is how life goes on.
Like that. itfc subtitles
I don't have time.
I don't have time to worry about how it happened.
It is what it is.
We're genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.
The trouble is, we live only one more year
unless we can get more time.
Time is now the currency.
We earn it and spend it.
The rich can live forever.
And the rest of us?
I just want to wake up with more time on my hand
than hours in the day.
Hey, Mom.
You got in late last night.
I put in some overtime.
Where'd it go?
On you.
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 50th!
Fifty?
That's right.
Twenty-five for the 25th time.
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.
Here we go.
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?
What do you got?
Three days. Not even.
We owe half that in rent.
Eight for the electric and we're still late on that loan.
I can make extra on the side, you know.
- I could--
- What, start fighting?
Nobody wins.
Yeah.
Remember, I'm not here tonight.
I got two days' work in the garment district.
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long.
- I'll be there.
Will...
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.
I'm late.
Let me give you 30 minutes so you can have a decent lunch.
I love you.
Happy birthday, Mom.
When you get back, we're going to celebrate.
Will!
Will!
You got a minute?
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.
Not a year I can use yet.
Come on, Will.
I've got bills to pay.
Here, take five minutes.
Get out of here.
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?
Yesterday, it was three.
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?
Two coffees.
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.
Really excited about it.
If you had any of your father in you, we could make a fortune.
I don't fight.
There's another one.
Broad daylight.
Whoa, what is this?
Where's the rest?
Never met the quota.
My units are up from last week.
So's the quota. Next.
That's a joke, right?
- Next.
- Move it. You're taking forever.
You in, Will?
I don't have time to gamble anymore.
Oh, thank God.
Because ever since you stopped playing,
I started winning.
You still owe me an hour.
You seen Borel?
- Will!
- Hey, man.
Your wife's looking for you.
You're not gonna believe it.
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!
Come on, let me get you home.
Soon as I finish this drink.
Hey! You!
You!
More everything!
Do you want to come home with me?
You can take us both home.
Excuse me.
You need to get out of here.
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.
Yes!
I mean, they aren't going to rob you.
They are going to kill you.
They can't take that much time and let you live to tell about it.
Yes.
I don't think you understand.
You should not be here!
Will. Will!
Minutemen!
Minutemen!
Walk away, Will.
Those gangsters aren't playing around.
Wait, wait.
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.
You think he'd help us?
Don't worry.
I won't do anything stupid.
Go.
The name's Fortis.
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.
Do you mind if I try it on?
I think it would suit me.
I'll tell you what.
I'll fight you for it.
Come on.
I'm an old man.
Turned 75 last week.
I need a moment.
You ready to go?
Ready to go.
Let's get you out of here.
Get him!
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.
Yeah, it looked like it.
I know what I'm doing.
Run. Run!
Come on!
Here!
Hurry!
Move!
Where the hell are you going?
Get in here!
I know who took him.
I know who he is.
Who he was.
Damn it, damn it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Flashing all that?
You out of your mind?
Henry Hamilton.
Will Salas.
Ugh.
God.
Drink more, it gets better.
Not much better.
You'll be safe till morning.
I'll get you out of here.
You're from New Greenwich.
Does it show?
Nah.
Looks like you could use some help yourself.
No, thanks.
How old are you?
In real time?
Twenty-eight.
I'm 105.
Good for you.
You won't see 106, you have too many more nights like tonight.
You are right.
But the day comes when you've had enough.
Your mind can be spent, even if your body's not.
We want to die.
We need to.
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?
You ever known anyone who's died?
For a few to be immortal, many must die.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You really don't know, do you?
Everyone can't live forever.
Where would we put them?
Why do you think there are Time Zones?
Why do you think taxes and prices go up the same day in the ghetto?
The cost of living keeps rising to make sure people keep dying.
How else could there be men with a million years while most live day to day?
But the truth is there's more than enough.
No one has to die before their time.
If you had as much time as I have on that clock, what would you do with it?
I'd stop watching it.
I can tell you one thing.
If I had all that time,
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.
Get some rest.
Don't worry.
I won't take it in the night.
And I won't take yours.
It does get better.
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.
Is Borel in?
Yeah. Borel?
Look at that.
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.
We could use that year right now.
Borel?
I'm here.
You'd better get her inside, Greta.
Look at this.
Where did you get that?
The guy at the bar.
They were going to kill him.
He gave it to me.
He timed himself out before I could stop him.
No one gives anybody 100 years.
He didn't just give me this.
He gave me the truth about it.
You can't let anyone see that.
Hey.
You know that time will get you killed.
How long have we been friends?
What, 10 years?
Here.
A decade.
You've been like a brother.
Where are you going?
Where this won't look out of place.
I finally got the time to take my mom to New Greenwich.
Greta, I'm going out!
Loan payment received, two days.
Thank you.
Dayton.
Two hours.
It's always been an hour.
Now it's two. Price went up.
Since when?
Since today.
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.
I can't do that, policy.
Please?
It's a two-hour walk.
I have an hour and a half.
Then you'd better run.
Stop! Please stop!
Wait! Please! Please, no!
Wait! No! Please!
Mom?
Will!
Will!
- Will!
- Mom!
No, no, no, no!
No!
Mom, Mom, Mom!
Thirteen zeros.
Unlucky for all.
The last time anyone saw him alive, there was over a century on that clock.
Around here, they'd kill you for a week.
What was he doing in this Time Zone?
What I was thinking was he might have brought this on himself.
Interesting.
How long you been keeping time, Jaeger?
Five years.
Let me know what you think when you have been doing it for 50.
It doesn't matter why he came here.
What matters are the hundred years that came with him.
Gotta be a witness.
Trust me, no one saw anything.
What would you like us to do, sir?
What we always do.
Follow the time.
Hey, Ray.
I'll give you 10 minutes for an hour.
When are you gonna get out of the game, Leila?
You gotta be pushing 60.
Thanks for letting everyone know.
Am I in the right place?
We don't normally make pickups in this Zone.
I was lost.
Please deposit one month.
Please deposit two months.
There are more of these than I remember.
That was a year.
Welcome to New Greenwich.
What are you really doing here?
I'm going to take them for everything they've got.
I'm going to make them pay.
Please, miss.
You can't be too careful.
Are you sure?
What's a night here cost?
Two months for a standard room.
Give me a suite.
Do you need help with your bags?
No.
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.
The camera doesn't show us how the body got into the river.
What do we really know?
What do we know?
We know that most thefts in Dayton amount to hours or days.
This was a century.
I don't see any more in circulation.
He could have capsuled the time.
You can't hide a hundred years in the ghetto.
They can sense when a man has a month more than he should.
The time left town.
That'll be eight and a half weeks.
Take a week for yourself.
Thanks.
You're not from around here, are you?
You do everything a little too fast.
Not everything.
What's that place across the street?
The casino.
Can anybody go?
Not dressed like that.
Good luck.
Sir, you were right.
If you turn back the clocks the day of Hamilton's death, and look at the time checks, someone spent years crossing four different Time Zones from Dayton--
To New Greenwich.
The cameras picked up on his suspicious behavior.
He's conscious of the surveillance, he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs.
But if he has time, he doesn't need to run.
It's a hard habit to break.
You're looking for a match?
His name is Will Salas.
You know him?
No.
I remember his father.
Good evening.
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.
Indeed it is.
However, there is a voluntary donation for non-members.
Most give a year.
What's your game?
Poker.
Right this way.
What's the limit?
There is none.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure of your company before, Mr...
Salas.
Will Salas.
Philippe Weis.
You must come from time.
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?
I assumed I was amongst friends.
Bet you 50 years.
You must be young.
When you've been 25 for 85 years, like I have, knowing only a random act of violence can take your life, you learn to appreciate what you have.
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.
I call.
Of course, some think what we have is unfair.
The time difference between Zones.
I've heard that.
But isn't this just the next logical step in our evolution?
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?
It's always been survival of the fittest.
Raise you another two centuries.
This is merely Darwinian capitalism.
Natural selection.
Absolutely.
The strong survive.
And I think your hand is weak.
I call.
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.
Thirteen figures.
Well played.
That was some risk.
It wasn't a risk.
No offense.
I knew I was going to win.
Confusing times.
Is she my mother, my sister or my daughter?
You're hoping she's not my wife.
Things used to be simpler once.
So I'm told.
Very beautiful.
Daughter.
Though she does look a lot like my wife. Sylvia?
Will Salas.
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.
You've taken years off my father's life.
Which is normally what you do.
Isn't that right, my darling?
We're having a party tomorrow night.
Perhaps you'll give him a chance to win back some of those years.
I'd love to.
Carl will tell you where I am.
Good night, Mr. Salas.
Sylvia, stay with your guards.
Fifty-nine years.
Plus tax.
The price includes delivery.
Delivery?
To wherever you're going to display it.
Display it?
Hell, I'm going to drive it.
Will Salas.
Allow me to introduce my mother-in-law, Clara, my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia.
I believe you two have already met.
Nice to meet you all.
I'll come find you later for our game.
I look forward to it.
Having fun, Mr. Salas?
Please, call me Will.
It's okay, Constantin.
Do you always have a hired hand standing right next to you?
No. I usually have two.
That doesn't make it very easy to get to know you.
I think that's the idea.
Your idea?
My father's.
I understand.
You all have a lot to lose.
So do you.
What do you do, Will?
I haven't quite figured that out yet.
Yes, why bother?
What's the hurry?
Right. Why do today what you can do in a century?
I know one thing we can do.
Dance with me.
Do you really come from time?
Why would you doubt that?
I saw you run.
Reminds me of people who come from the ghetto.
Sometimes I envy them.
You don't know anything.
Oh, no?
The clock is good for no one.
The poor die and the rich don't live.
We can all live forever as long as we don't do anything foolish.
Doesn't that scare you?
That maybe you'll never do anything foolish?
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?
Come with me.
This was tonight.
He's only an hour ahead of us.
Look at that.
I've never seen anything like it.
What are you doing?
We don't go in.
You're insane.
You have this in your backyard.
You never go in.
And I'm insane?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Sylvia, come on!
What happened to doing something foolish?
I don't know you.
We could change that.
I get it.
You're out here, all alone, with a stranger.
You can't be too careful.
Maybe you can.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
I have to go back.
To what?
You should go back.
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I have.
She's with her guards.
Right behind you.
Thank God.
Now, how about that game?
It's all right, everyone.
What's this about?
I'm sorry to have to break up the party, Mr. Weis.
I just need a word with your friend.
My friend?
Very well.
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.
I'm Will Salas.
I know.
What are you doing in this Zone?
It's not illegal, is it?
To change Time Zones?
No, it's not illegal.
It's just rare.
Where did you get that?
I won it.
Gambling.
All of it?
No.
A man named Henry Hamilton gave me over a century.
He said he didn't need it anymore.
He timed himself out.
Henry Hamilton was worth thousands of years.
He could practically live forever.
You expect me to believe that he was immortal and he wanted to die?
I don't expect you to believe it.
But it's the truth.
It was a gift.
I'm not a thief.
But, hey, if you guys are looking for stolen time, maybe you should arrest everyone here.
Oh, I see.
You're talking about justice.
Well, I am a Timekeeper.
I don't concern myself with "justice."
I only concern myself with what I can measure.
Seconds, minutes, hours.
I keep time.
And that time is in the wrong hands.
That time will be held, along with you.
We'll leave you two hours for booking and processing.
Why are you investigating a suicide?
There's mass murder in the ghetto every day.
That is fascinating.
Huh.
I heard another man talk like that.
It was over 20 years ago.
You're probably too young to remember your father.
We'll arrange safe transport.
This is New Greenwich, after all.
Sylvia?
Do as I say and go with the guards.
Oh, for God's sake, Father.
There's an army in this house.
If we can't stop one man from killing us, we should kill ourselves.
Stop him!
Move! Get out of the way!
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.
Thanks.
You're going to kill us!
Please just let me out!
What are you doing?
Do you even know how to drive?
What's there to know?
Oh, shit.
Give me some time.
I guess you really are from the ghetto, after all.
What the hell do you know about where I'm from? Give me some time.
Or you're gonna kill me, like you killed Henry Hamilton?
Lend me an hour.
I'm not giving you a second.
I should have listened to my father.
Please, take me home.
Please.
- I can't do that.
- Why?
You're keeping me alive.
Keep that covered.
Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead.
Now that worked too well.
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.
Look who it is.
Who it was.
He's done in minutes.
He'll wake up dead.
That'll be a shock.
Too bad. I would have preferred to kill him more beautifully.
The girl's still breathing.
She's got a decade.
Holy shit.
The man he stole from me had more than a century.
What? We'll divide it later.
It's like an angel fell from the sky.
Fortis!
Leave it!
Fortis!
Look at me.
You okay?
No.
Why are you laughing?
We're not dead.
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.
Where did my time go?
I have a half hour!
Ah.
You're lucky.
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?
That's rich, coming from you.
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing.
Come here.
Hey, don't worry.
It's not the first time I've been this broke.
Well, it's a first for me.
What are we going to do?
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.
Time transfer.
Cutting it close again, sir.
Well, I'm still walking around.
Judging by the lack of dead bodies,
I have to assume they are also.
They got jacked. They couldn't have left here with more than minutes.
He's back in his old neighborhood.
So, where do you want us to start looking?
We don't. He'll come to us.
Borel?
Borel, open up. It's Will.
Greta.
Where's Borel?
He's dead.
Dead? What?
You gave him a decade.
He drank himself to death with nine years on his clock.
Jesus Christ.
Greta, I'm so sorry.
Goodbye, Will.
Will, we have minutes.
Try not to act like it.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up!
We're going to die, Will!
Do you want to die?
Shut up!
I hope those are real. Run.
Stop! Wait!
Please, wait!
Come back in an hour.
That won't be possible.
Here!
I'll give you two days for them.
They're diamonds.
You can take the 48 hours, or you can be a pretty corpse.
We'll take it.
Don't make a sound.
Give me my time.
Let's go.
I guess I got my wish.
I did do something foolish.
Your name's on a lot of buildings.
It's my father's name.
How much is he worth, anyway?
Eons.
What do you think he'd pay to get you back?
You have no shame, do you?
Please deposit one minute.
Dial.
Hello.
Mr. Weis, please give the phone to the Timekeeper.
Hello, Will.
How much do you want?
A thousand years.
You'll never live to spend it.
Then distribute it to the Time Lines in Dayton.
Do it by sunrise tomorrow and she can go home.
Will...
I'm afraid for you, Will.
You keep talking like him, you're going to die like him.
My father died in a fight, trying to take a man's time.
Oh, no.
His crime wasn't taking time.
He was doing something far more dangerous.
Please don't make your father's mistake.
Dayton. Pedre Plaza.
I know it.
A thousand years to the Time Lines.
A thousand years.
It's nothing.
It's for our daughter.
No, it's for them.
This is insane.
They can take your time, just like that.
Or you can take theirs.
This is insane.
Yeah, it's insane.
We should be safe here until dawn.
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.
This is your place?
There's water.
It's cold, but it's something.
You can put on fresh clothes.
Where's your family?
My mother timed out.
This is her dress.
Yeah.
What about your father?
He died when I was a boy.
He was a fighter. Strong arm.
He wasn't the strongest, but he knew how to win.
How do you win?
I'll show you.
What you do is let them have the upper hand.
Then, he'd let his time go all the way down.
Because he knew that when you were down to your last seconds and they think it's over, they start watching your clock and forget to watch their own.
He died in a fight?
I think he was killed for giving away what he won.
He wasn't just giving them time.
He was giving them hope.
How long have you been this old?
Twenty-five for three.
Twenty-five for two.
What was it like when your clock started?
I was in the street.
It almost knocked me over.
My year was gone in a week, we were so in debt.
After that, I lived day to day.
Mine was a little different.
It woke me.
I looked in the mirror.
I guess everybody does.
That's what you're gonna look like for the rest of your life.
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.
You must hate me.
Where I come from.
It's nobody's fault, what they're born with.
They open in a minute.
Let's see how generous your father is now.
The Timekeepers would have never let him do it.
You don't have to say that.
How do you think my father built all those buildings?
By giving away a thousand years?
Now what?
You can go home.
There's people on the streets.
I can move without being spotted.
What have you got?
Eleven hours.
How does anyone live like this?
You don't generally sleep in.
You can call for help.
I'll watch from here,
I'll make sure you're safe.
You know, you could fight this.
I can say that running to the ghetto was my idea.
My father'd believe that, he thinks I'm reckless.
He has a lot of influence, Will.
He can get you a lawyer.
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.
I'm pretty sure that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.
What are you going to do?
Steal?
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
Here. Just in case.
I'll be right here.
Please deposit one minute.
- Father?
- Sylvia?
You couldn't spare a second, Father?
I wish I could say I'm surprised.
Did you hear what I just said?
You know I'd do anything for you.
They're coming to get you.
They know where you are.
Will, look out!
Sorry to disappoint you, we don't keep much on us.
To discourage thieves like you.
Think of this as a gift.
Will! Come on!
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.
I think you did both.
You could say thank you.
Thank you. What have you got?
Nine hours.
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.
Timekeepers live day to day.
It'll be hours before the others show up.
He could die in the ghetto.
He still might.
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?
Stay a while.
You might like us if you got to know us!
They're going to think you're with me.
Yes.
This is a mess.
Welcome to my world.
Back off!
You've been shot.
I was worried you timed out.
Where'd you get that?
What are we going to do?
We can't keep driving around in this car.
It's a cop car.
So let's make an arrest.
Was I going too fast?
Not fast enough.
The mistake you made was stopping.
Now, let's see who you got back there.
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.
Whoa!
It went off.
I was just trying to help.
Come on.
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life," but since your money is your life...
How dare you steal from me?
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No?
Think of it as repossession.
I'll leave you with what I've had most every day of my life.
- One day.
- One day?
Are you insane?
You can do a lot in a day.
Those are pretty.
I owe you these.
You shouldn't have.
You, out.
Will Salas, prime suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton,
is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis,
daughter of finance magnate,
Philippe Weis.
Citizens are advised to exercise extreme--
We look cute together.
It doesn't say you're wanted.
It doesn't say I'm not.
You've forgotten I shot a cop.
I admit, not very well.
It was your first time.
Hey.
I can say I made you do all of it.
You can go back.
Go back to what?
Do I really want to spend my whole life trying not to die by mistake?
A lot of people would say being here is a mistake.
I don't have a choice.
I'm starting to think that I don't, either.
I want to reassure you all there is no cause for alarm.
No ransom was paid.
Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.
It puts us at risk.
It can spread.
Too much time in the wrong hands can crash the market.
This hostage situation will be quickly resolved.
Sir.
Everything is under control.
We'll talk soon.
Timekeeper.
After this regrettable incident, it's really not necessary for you to come in person.
I'm afraid it really is necessary.
When can we hope for a rescue?
I believe that's the point.
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.
Mr. Leon.
Raymond. May I call you Raymond?
I blame myself.
I invited the man into my home.
He had so much time, how was I supposed to know?
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself by her lack of vigilance.
That's why I always tried to keep her close.
But she is clearly under Will Salas' control.
If it's a matter of resources,
I'm happy to make a contribution.
It's a scandal, what we pay our Timekeepers.
I've issued a warrant for your daughter's arrest.
If she contacts you and you assist her in any way,
I will issue a warrant for your arrest.
There is nothing I cannot buy.
Now... how many of my years do you want?
There aren't enough years, even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis.
Good night.
This is called a trigger.
And you don't pull it until you actually want to shoot something.
I wanted to shoot something.
Right.
Will, if you get a lot of time, are you really gonna give it away?
I've only ever had a day.
How much do you need?
How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you?
You don't watch.
You close your eyes.
I can help you get all the time you want.
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?
Today's rate, 30%.
I can't pay it back.
We can always come to some arrangement.
Let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to announce that Weis Timelenders is now offering interest-free loans with no payments.
Ever.
So help yourselves and take a day.
Take a month.
Hell, take a year.
Come on. Help yourselves!
Take it.
Take the time. It's free.
No one's watching their clocks, huh?
Get out of here, or I'll confiscate every second!
Must've thought it was a drive-through.
Turn around.
Don't move.
I don't have much.
Everything I have, I give away.
I know.
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.
There are years that shouldn't be there.
I will stop him, sir.
Doesn't he understand he's hurting the very people he's trying to help?
Well, now.
- Look at all that.
- Yeah.
I finally had time to buy one of these.
Let's not do anything I might regret.
What was that about?
I wasted 30 days.
Today, Sylvia Weis withdrew some of her "inheritance"
when she and Will Salas robbed her father's time bank
for the sixth time in a week.
I give her everything.
Does she want to kill me?
You were killing her, Philippe.
You were suffocating her.
You suffocate us all.
Call.
That's good.
Just not as good as that.
Ooh!
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.
Why did I play strip poker with you?
Why did you?
Sir.
They're still there.
How did you know, sir?
This is where the hours and the days are.
He's paid them all off.
This is where I would hide.
Put your clothes on.
Stop!
- We're trapped!
- No, we're not!
Jump. They won't do it.
We shouldn't do it.
Come on!
See? They won't jump.
So much for your theory.
Shit!
Here!
Go!
Stop! Stop!
I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!
You sure about that?
No.
- Go.
- I can't.
You can! Go!
Un-fucking-believable!
Hold on.
You two look familiar.
How about now?
Welcome to the Century.
Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.
How many rooms?
All of them.
We were hoping for something long-term.
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?
I'm sure you can.
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.
Right.
Nobody goes anywhere!
Wait, whoa, whoa.
Don't look at me.
You know who I'm looking for.
I'm looking for whoever gave this man a month!
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off of every one of you in this hellhole until someone says something
I want to hear.
I can't hear anything.
Clean it.
No, wait, wait. Wait. Please!
Please don't. Please.
I don't know where they are!
Please.
Please!
Please.
I believe you're next.
Um...
At last, someone's acting reasonably.
I just want a share of the reward.
My young friend.
You'll get your reward.
Ten years.
That's insulting.
If they catch us, there's no way they won't kill us, is there?
Do you regret this?
You saved my life.
When?
Now.
And every day since I met you.
You forget, I almost got you killed a few times, too.
I'm willing to overlook that.
How's the poor little rich girl?
I never got a chance to... properly thank you for your time.
I'm not surprised you stayed.
It's the life, isn't it?
Here we don't stop living until we're actually dead.
There are a lot more ways to die around here.
But here, there's dancing before dying.
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.
You've been causing a lot of trouble, which is normally my job.
Don't you understand?
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone is 'cause I have boundaries.
I steal from my own people.
You surely know things are bad when I have to restore order.
Fortunately for you,
I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.
I do it, but I prefer not to.
I think you deserve a fighting chance.
We play to zero.
What's the point?
I lose, I die.
I win, they kill me.
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.
And her?
After I take you,
I'll take her.
Oh, yeah. And her time.
Then I'll collect my reward for making everything right in the world.
This way!
All the time he's taken.
Don't you mean the time he's given away, sir?
Even to you?
I have given 50 years of my life to this job.
I am not about to see those years go to waste.
Go on.
I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but by tomorrow... you won't have time to stand around.
God damn it.
It's over.
We lost.
We're not doing any good.
At least we're trying.
No. You don't understand. All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living.
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.
So, what?
We just stop fighting?
We can't win.
We can't hurt them.
The time we're taking makes no damn difference!
What would?
What would hurt them?
A million years.
You got a million years on you?
I guess it really would take a million years.
Let's give up.
Stop!
I am Sylvia Weis.
I want to surrender, but only to my father.
Sylvia.
Hello, Daddy.
Stay where you are!
You've hired more guards since I last saw you.
Thanks to you, I need them.
One too many.
Guns down.
Now!
Do it.
Let's go for a ride.
You'd steal from your own father.
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
What's the combination?
Well, it's not my birthday.
You've started to regret that day,
I imagine, Father.
Try 12-2-18-09.
Darwin's birthday.
Survival of the fittest.
It cost us centuries just to bribe our way in here.
Let's see what it got us.
Quality time.
There really is a man with a million years.
That's my first million.
It won't be my last.
You know how much good it could do?
I know how much harm it could do.
Try to understand, even if you gave a year to a million people, you're just prolonging their agony.
You're prolonging their lives.
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million years, it could cripple the system.
Let's hope so.
We're not meant to live like this.
We're not meant to live forever.
Although I do wonder, Father, if you've ever lived a day in your life.
Is that so?
You might upset the balance for a generation.
Two.
But don't fool yourself.
In the end, nothing will change.
Because everyone wants to live forever.
They all think they have a chance at immortality even though all the evidence is against it.
They all think they will be the exception.
But the truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die.
No one should be immortal if even one person has to die.
What was that?
What was that?
What just happened?
It must be a mistake. A million years just went off the clock in New Greenwich.
It's not a mistake.
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.
It's not a mistake.
It's them.
Take a month, Maurice.
Dispatch, what can you see?
There's a lot of traffic in the vicinity, sir.
All right, look for the slowest car.
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.
If this works...
If this works, we gotta get more.
Dayton's not the only zone that can use a few extra years.
And wire me my per diem.
Wait. Never mind.
I have him.
Give the order, shoot on sight.
In New Greenwich?
That's against policy, sir.
So is having a million years leave the Zone.
That time cannot leave the Zone!
Shoot on sight!
Please deposit one month.
Please deposit one month.
Keep going! Keep going!
We're close!
We're okay! We're okay!
You're late.
Need a minute?
Go. Go.
Where's our capsule?
Too late.
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.
Looks like you're about out yourself.
- Time!
- There's time!
Move!
Move!
You, get out! Get out!
We gotta get to Livingston.
We can make it.
Can we?
You okay?
Stop!
You can run.
So can you.
You're from here, aren't you?
Long time ago.
Yeah.
I worked out how to escape.
And now you make sure no one else does.
That's the way it has to be.
I didn't start the clock.
I can't turn it back.
I keep it running.
I keep time.
"I keep time."
I'm gonna need some of that time you borrowed from me.
Unless you want us to die on the way to our execution.
Time.
We don't have enough.
One of us can make it. Take mine.
You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there. You can.
- No. No.
- Yes!
Please.
No.
There's time.
- What?
- The Keeper's time. Run. Run!
Run!
I need time.
Time transfer.
What have we got?
A day.
Could do a lot in a day.
Sir, do something.
It's already done.
These are live pictures from Dayton.
Citizens have taken to the streets.
There's so much stolen time in circulation.
Factories in Dayton lie idle.
And now, citizens are crossing Zones,
seen here entering New Greenwich.
While authorities claim they have the situation
under control, others fear the system may be headed for collapse.
We will continue to update you on this developing story.
Sir, we lost Zone Eight.
And Ten.
It's spreading.
What do we do, sir?
Go home.
Still no sign of fugitives
Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.
Authorities continue to ask for the public's help
in bringing these criminals to justice.
Told you there were bigger banks.
You almost missed your calling.
Whether your computer's ready or not, there are only 318 days till the year 2000.
A group of corporations concerned about the problems related to the Y2K computer bug have convened...
No. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hi. Everything's gonna be okay, pal.
Come here, come here. Yeah.
That's a good boy. Okay, don't cry.
She can't hurt you anymore.
It's over. Come here.
No one's gonna hurt you ever again.
My name is Louis Hicks.
I'm an investigative reporter.
I cover stories of killers and criminals.
Their lives are dark, without hope.
I try not to let it affect me, but it's hard.
- Hey! Gordo! Two shots.
- No!
- Yes, yes.
- No, no, no, no.
- I got to work in an hour.
- Just one, just one.
- No, no.
- One shot, old-school.
- One. One shot.
- There it is.
- To Louis.
- Yeah.
All right, now you do something for me.
Let me buy you breakfast.
Too late. I already ate.
Breakfast of champions.
How's work? Any compelling real-life stories I should know about?
Not today.
Well...
How's work for you, huh?
You working on the book?
Always. Always working, Gordo.
So, speaking of which, what's up on the work front?
Are you gonna take the university thing?
Me, an adjunct professor?
I suspect a few ethics questions remain.
Louis, you're a good writer.
You're a good investigator. Maybe...
Maybe this teaching thing is what you need to put it all back together.
You know? You know, show them that you can hold down a job, stay in one place, a little stability.
Hey, maybe get more visitation time with Adam.
That would be nice.
How often you get to see him?
Weekends. Yeah. Most weekends.
Louis, pal, I worry about you.
Come on, the truth is, you don't do so well on your own, you know?
What are you trying to say, Gordo?
Oh, God. The natives are getting restless.
- There it is.
- I got to go.
Thanks anyway, Gordo.
What would you do without me?
Can I get the check, please?
- Hey!
- Hey.
I thought you were coming over later.
Yeah, I just thought we should talk first.
You're wearing your wedding ring again?
I'm sick of this, Louis. I'm sick of it!
Felicia, wait.
I'm done waiting! I'm done!
Maybe your wife can handle it, but I can't.
Can't believe that son of a bitch! Whatever.
You want to go back to your wife, fine.
Good luck. I'm done, done!
You've been crying.
You prosecuted Sampson Raines for those murders last year.
Was it fun, Felicia?
Making all those headlines? I bet it was.
A lot more fun than taking on a low profile child abuse case, which got zero media coverage.
The boy! Are you the boy's father?
No. No, I'm not, Felicia.
I'm his guardian angel.
Let's see...
"Felicia Carson, single, lives alone, dies today. "
See? It's written.
So, it's gonna have to happen.
Felicia?
Felicia?
Felicia!
911. What's your emergency?
I need an ambulance, 717 Oak Lane.
Are you hurt, sir?
No, there's so much blood.
Is someone else hurt? I need more specifics.
Hey!
Stay out of it!
Felicia Carson, Assistant District Attorney.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.
Well, well, look who it is.
No, no, let him through.
Louis Hicks. What's the matter?
Work a little slow?
Glued to your police scanner again?
I was the one that found her. I called it in.
- What were you doing here?
- We're friends.
Friends? What happened to your head?
There was somebody inside the house with her.
When he saw me, he took off. I chased him.
We got into it, and he slammed me into a dumpster.
- I'll sign for it. Just get her on the bus.
- Okay.
You chased him, he slammed you.
Where'd he go?
I don't know. I lost him. Man, I just...
He... It's like he just vanished.
Vanished? How?
You know, he was there, and then he was gone.
So, what happened next?
I just passed out.
Louis, what the hell happened to you?
Hold on there. Come here. Let's get an ID.
This your friend?
Pretty girl. It's a shame.
Load her up.
She was a good person.
Who would want to do this to her?
An Assistant DA? Someone she put away, someone who wants attention, maybe random.
Does this look random to you?
No, it looks crazy, serial crazy.
When was the last time you saw her?
- I don't know. Around 6:00.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
- Where?
Outside her office building.
How long you two been together?
Two months. Maybe more.
We met on a story.
Sampson Raines murders.
I remember the case.
What I wrote in that article was nothing personal.
Of course not.
Wait here.
I'll get someone to take a full statement.
I'll help any way I can.
The department appreciates your cooperation.
See you later, Gordo.
That guy's a real prick.
Hey, he took what you wrote about him pretty hard.
You think?
I broke up with her tonight, Gordo.
I can't help but think, you know, if I hadn't, you know, she was upset, her guard was down.
This is not your fault. Come on.
Let's get somebody to look at that head of yours. Come on.
Coming!
Hey, buddy! I missed you, man!
- Can I borrow your laptop?
- You know where it is.
Gina?
Morning, Louis. Did you forget?
No, no, I just had a rough night.
Of course. Let me guess, you were busy researching a really hot story.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you gonna take your son to the park this morning or not?
Louis, you made a huge deal about how important every weekend is to you now.
Yes. Yes, I am.
Fine. Look, I was gonna run some errands,
- but if you're a mess again...
- No! No! I'm not a mess!
This, this, this is a mess.
Morning, Hicks. Miss.
Missus. Mrs. Hicks.
Detective Becker, this is my wife, Gina.
What can I do for you?
I wanted to follow up on a couple of things from the Carson murder last night.
Murder?
Felicia Carson, an Assistant DA, was murdered in her home last night.
Your husband found the body.
Someone I knew was killed last night.
I'm sorry. A woman you knew?
A source. From the last Journal piece.
My apologies for the early morning.
I just wanted to get right on it.
Wouldn't want to be accused of sloppy police work in another true-crime article.
Okay. Adam, honey, let's go.
But I want to see Dad.
Yeah, I know, baby. Not today.
Daddy's busy.
Gina, wait.
But I want to watch the policeman.
- Adam, now, please.
- Gina.
Look, this is a bad time. Why don't you give me a call later this afternoon?
What gave that away?
Hey. A woman is dead.
Good day.
Gina.
Gina!
Gina, wait a second.
I'm sorry, but I was involved.
You are always involved, just never with the people who matter.
Are you serious? A woman was killed.
- What? A woman that you were fucking.
- I wasn't fucking her.
Besides, we've been separated for six months.
Yeah, and I noticed that you're still wearing your ring. Nice.
Stop it.
Listen, I saw the guy who did this, and I chased him.
Save it for the goddamn book, Louis!
I don't care anymore!
I'm sure it'll be great.
Especially a firsthand account.
I mean, you knew the victim intimately.
I don't know. God, I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just want to come home.
No. You can't do that.
You can't do that to me, not like this.
You seriously need to get your shit together, Louis.
Gina, wait.
Hey, buddy.
Sit back, baby.
Shit.
He's gonna kill more of them.
Hi. You've reached my cell.
Can't come to the phone right now, but leave a brief message with your phone number, even if you think I have it.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can, unless I forget.
Wait for the beep. You know what to do.
Louis. What's going on? You okay?
We got to talk. Can I come in?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Come on. What time is it?
I went back to where I lost the guy.
You did... What the hell for?
You're gonna love this, Gordo.
You're gonna love this.
I got his journal, and he's gonna kill again.
I got names. I got dates.
Wait, from what? From this journal?
Yes. And that's not all I got.
I got a print.
Louis, this is evidence.
You're gonna give it to Becker.
Screw Becker. No, I can't trust Becker.
I need you to run it for me.
Becker's in charge on this.
Look, any and all evidence you've got to turn in.
You promise you run the print,
I'll turn the journal in first thing.
Give me the damn thing.
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- Okay. All right.
Hey! Thank you, Gordo.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's not nice to read someone's private thoughts.
How'd you get in here?
I knew that I had recognized you.
You used to be quite a writer.
You had a genuine empathy for the outsiders, for the outcasts.
I try to understand people without judging them.
Why they do what they do.
Why are you doing this?
I'm just putting things right.
Are you interviewing me?
For your next book, perhaps?
You want to be interviewed?
The truth is, you won't be writing any more books, Mr. Hicks.
My journal, please.
This interview is over.
You just ruined a perfectly good jacket.
Get your hands in the air!
Hold on, hold on!
- Put the shovel down!
- There's a guy and a gun!
- Put the shovel down!
- On the ground! Now!
- It's my house!
- On the ground!
- It's my house! There's a man inside!
- On the ground, sir!
- There's a man in there with a gun!
- Up against the wall.
- There's a man and a gun.
- Now! Now! Move it! Move it!
Just relax.
- There's a guy inside.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clear!
Bedroom clear.
Bathroom clear.
Louis Hall, architect, Louis Barnes, sales representative,
Louis Hayes,
Community Brotherhood Project.
You're a man of many faces.
I'm an investigative reporter.
An investigative reporter.
And you recognized him?
It's the same guy.
This accurately matches your description?
That's him. That's definitely him.
Fine. Circulate it.
Okay, so, your door was locked, no sign of forced entry.
How'd he get in?
I don't know.
I see.
And you say he came in here looking for a journal, his journal?
Yes.
Which you should've turned in.
And you obviously know that withholding evidence is a crime.
All right. Let me get this straight.
A killer, who only you saw, breaks in here, steals the only proof you have of his existence.
You think I made this up?
I broke my own window?
I put these cuts on my face?
A security guard at the Federal Building saw Felicia arguing with a man after work.
Would that be you?
Yes.
What were you fighting about?
Am I a suspect here?
I don't know. You tell me.
I mean, at 6:00, you two were fighting, and at midnight, she's dead.
Listen to me.
He plans to kill again.
More people are gonna die, a lot more.
I mean, I saw names, dates, surveillance photos.
I mean, we got to figure out a way to stop this guy.
"We"? "We" got to figure it out?
It's not enough for you to write about these nut jobs?
You got to get in on the action, huh?
I just don't want to see any more people hurt.
But don't you?
I mean, doesn't that make for a better book?
I mean, it's a hell of a career comeback.
The Killer Who Can't Be Caught.:
Personal Interviews by Louis Hicks.
Get out of my house.
Spoken like a truly innocent man.
Hey!
Geez. Look how big he is.
- How old is he now? What, six?
- Seven in a few weeks.
They grow up before you know it.
You don't know the half of it.
You get anything off that fingerprint?
Yeah. One hit. Nothing very useful.
"James Keech, Caucasian male, height, 4'7",
"residence, Trinity Home for Boys, no known family, age 11."
Yeah. He's a kid popped up on the state welfare database.
- Yeah.
- An orphan in some group home up in Brooksville.
Not your guy, huh?
About 30 years too young.
I don't get it. It doesn't make sense.
I know how you feel.
I'm sorry about Felicia.
What's your point?
You need to stay away from this, Louis.
You're too close to it.
Becker's really got it in for you.
And when he kills again?
He's planning two more victims in the next three days.
We're on it.
Let Becker do his job.
Right. 'Cause he's just so good at it.
I got to go. I'm just trying to help.
Thanks anyway, Gordo.
Shit.
Victoria Ihling.
April 19th.
Anne Brighton.
April 22nd.
Felicia.
Felicia Carson. Anne Brighton. Vicki Ihling.
What do you have in common?
- Hello? Hey!
- Kayla, Louis Hicks.
Listen, you still doing DNA matches for Uncle Sam?
Yeah.
I'm doing another story.
I might need a favor.
Anytime.
Great. Thanks.
- Jax! Louis Hicks.
- Hey, man.
I might need you to run some names for me.
You got to help me, Louis.
Listen, I'll tail him for a few days, and I'll get some pictures taken.
Son of a bitch! I know it!
I know she's cheating on me!
I know, I know. We'll take care of it, buddy.
Listen, you got something for me?
Yeah, right. Okay.
One of these is the needle in the proverbial haystack.
There's over 30 Anne Brightons in the metro area alone.
But Victoria Ihling, there's just two hits.
One of them deceased, and the other one,
God bless her, is one of those who likes to spread her life all over the Web.
I mean, these women, they put it out there for everyone to see and then they complain about stalkers, you know?
What do I know?
You did good, buddy. You did good.
Anytime. Anytime, Hicks.
But you owe me one.
Yes.
Hi. Vicki Ihling, please?
Louis Hicks with the Journal.
Yes, and I'm writing an exposé on animal rights abuses in the food industry.
Yes, ma'am.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
I will see you later.
Miss Ihling.
- May I help you?
- Louis Hicks.
We spoke on the phone this morning.
How did you know where I work?
Sorry. Your webpage. I'm a reporter.
I'm on a deadline.
I just had a few more questions.
You know what? I'm in kind of a rush.
It'll only take you a couple minutes.
Can I buy you a cup of coffee or...
You know what? Why don't you give me your card, and I'll call you?
Better yet, I'll call you.
- Tomorrow morning fine?
- It's fine. Bye.
- Sorry to have bothered you.
- Okay, thanks. Have a good day.
You, too.
No, come on. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Come on.
Please don't. Please.
Come on. No. Come on. No. No.
- Everything all right?
- It's fine. Fine, thanks.
Doesn't sound fine.
Piece of cake.
- There you go. You're all set.
- I don't know how to thank you.
I do. Dinner tonight. And you're buying.
On a teacher's salary? I don't think so.
I guess it's on me then.
All right, that's more like it.
Anne Brighton, please.
Deceased? Sorry for your loss.
Hello. May I speak to Anne Brighton, please?
I see. Did she leave a forwarding address?
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Vicki home?
You must be Louis.
I'm Shelly, her roommate.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry. Vicki's not here.
She's not?
No. She told me to tell you that she's sorry, but she couldn't make it.
Why is that?
Tell you the truth, she's very insecure.
She panicked. She got nervous about going out with a guy she just met.
Well, can you at least tell me where she went?
She's gonna kill me.
The Griffin Room. It's about eight blocks that way. You turn left on 3rd.
Hey! Hey, wait!
- Hey, there.
- How you doing?
I'll have a... I'll have what the lady's having.
You got it.
Hi.
- Is this seat taken?
- It is now.
It is a crime how we treat our teachers.
So, where do you teach?
Washington Elementary.
Really? I knew someone there.
- A teacher?
- No, a student, actually.
- A little boy.
- Who?
A little orphan boy.
He played a bit rough with a stray cat.
Teacher told on him.
Sent him back to his group home.
Yeah. He didn't much like it there.
Hey, you all right?
I have to go to the restroom. Excuse me.
- Hey!
- Hey!
It was a mangy, old stray.
No one was going to miss it.
It was a fucking cat!
No.
No.
God, please.
You're too late.
He's got a gun!
Look, I can't talk right now. I got a whack job with a gun down at the Griffin.
Gordo! It's me!
I know who the hell it is.
I can't talk right now. I got to go.
No, no, Gordo, no!
It's me they saw with the gun!
I tried to stop him!
What are you talk... What? Who? Who?
The same guy that killed Felicia. I tried...
He murdered again!
He's gonna kill another one in 48 hours.
Louis, where are you?
I... I...
I can't stop him.
Every time I try, he just disappears.
Where are you? I'm gonna come get you.
I can't come in! I can't!
They won't believe me!
Louis! If you run, I can't help you!
Louis!
Damn it!
Hicks, police! Come on out!
Hicks!
- Bedroom clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
To the right!
Backyard clear.
Nobody home.
No, he's not crazy at all.
He'll claim he was tracking the killer, re-creating his diary.
Jesus Christ. Could there be more?
Other unsolveds?
You know, Hicks warned that there would be other killings.
I'm on it.
Hey, Marty. Louis Hicks.
Hey, buddy.
Remember that thing
I kept your name out of?
Yeah.
You said to call if I ever needed to borrow one.
Four door okay?
Brother, as long as it's got four wheels,
I'm good.
In local news, a woman was brutally murdered in the Griffin Room bar downtown.
Eyewitnesses report seeing an armed man flee the premises on foot.
Police are urging anyone with information leading to the capture and arrest of the suspect to call the urgent...
- Hello?
- Hey, Hicks? Kayla Pierce.
Hey.
I ran the DNA sample.
And?
And the blood on the cloth and the blood off the kid's prints, they're an exact match.
What kid?
Right.
It's an exact match? Are you sure?
Well, as far as I can tell.
Could a father and son have the same DNA?
Well, all men have a copy of their father's Y chromosome, but this is more than that.
I mean, this looks like the same person.
Or I guess it could be a twin, but it would have to be an identical twin.
I mean, a fraternal twin wouldn't do.
Is there room for error?
There always is. It's not a perfect science.
I mean, normally, DNA are compared at only a few spots along the sample.
I could run more tests.
That'd be great, Kayla. I owe you one.
You owe me a lot more than that, handsome.
See you.
Trinity Home for Boys.
Now move on! Go!
- May I help you?
- I sure hope so.
They said to speak to Polly, second office on the left.
Come in.
Hi. I'm Polly, the overworked and underpaid social worker.
Louis Hayes. I'm with the Community Brotherhood Project.
- Mr. Hayes, have a seat, please.
- Thank you.
I'm here on behalf of one of your kids.
James Keech?
Why is that?
Well, we run a corporately sponsored
Big Brother outreach program.
James' name came up as a possible candidate.
James? Really?
You seem surprised.
Perhaps someone applied on his behalf?
No. No living family.
Where did you say you worked again?
Community Brotherhood Project.
Part of the mayor's new joint-outreach initiative.
Right. Yeah, I've heard of that.
Don't you think
James could benefit from some guidance?
Yes, of course. He's a very bright kid.
Aptitude scores, especially in math.
Well, when he cares enough to apply himself.
It's just... I'm not sure that he's ready.
His social skills aren't terrific.
He can be a handful.
I think there are other kids that would be much more suitable...
Well, it sounds to me like this is the one kid that would benefit most from our mentoring.
May I take a look at his file?
You know, it's just words on paper.
Come with me.
I have to warn you, he's been returned by every foster family we've managed to place him with.
And he's getting to that age where, well, let's face it, even the best of them get less adorable as they get older.
Let's just try and stay positive.
See if the kid's not due for a change of luck.
I like your attitude.
I wish the rest of my colleagues thought that way.
- You wait here. I'll go get him.
- Of course.
James? There's a gentleman here from the Community Brotherhood...
Come on. He's very nice.
- James, this is Mr. Hayes.
- You could call me Louis.
James, Mr. Hayes is our guest.
Hi.
Can you give me a moment alone with him, please?
Sure. I'll be right over there.
Hey, buddy, how old are you?
What the fuck you want, mister?
- Well, I asked to meet you.
- What for?
Well, I run a Big Brother program.
We go to group homes, take kids on trips.
You know, stuff like that.
- Why?
- Just for fun.
Is there anything special you'd like to do?
Really?
Try me.
It's what he wants.
And how am I going to gain the boy's trust if I can't deliver?
Look, Mr. Hayes, I have to ask.
Why this child?
Well, couldn't you ask that of any one of them?
That's a good point, but he's had a very tragic childhood.
Both his aunt and mother were murdered four years apart.
- How?
- Horribly.
His mother was torn apart.
Dissected and left in a bathtub.
The police found him, a baby, in the apartment with her.
He had been there for hours with the body.
If someone hadn't called in an anonymous tip, he might not ever have survived.
- They ever catch the killer?
- Not as far as I know.
James went to live with an aunt.
It was a less than ideal situation.
Drugs, domestic abuse.
He went into foster care, and right after, the boyfriend killed the aunt and killed himself.
- Some sort of murder-suicide thing.
- And the father?
There is no father.
Take a look for yourself.
The lot across the street had a camera.
- You see anyone else?
- No.
There were witnesses outside.
Nothing landed but the window he shot out.
Bartender said he saw her talking to another guy.
Okay, then find me that guy.
Because right now, the only guy is right there.
And guess what?
The last victim was dissected.
Same MO as his ex-girlfriend.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
No, but I think you're being a little too personal on this one, Ed.
Come on, it's Hicks. I know the guy.
He's not a killer.
Fine. Let's just get your boyfriend off the streets, so he doesn't get himself into more trouble.
Yes, may I speak to Anne Brighton, please?
My condolences.
Sorry to have bothered you.
They're beautiful, aren't they?
They're killers.
No one's gonna want to mess with them.
I guess not.
What do you want to be when you grow up, James?
I don't know.
- Astronaut.
- Really? That's cool.
Are you angry at somebody, James?
I get angry, too, sometimes.
Hell, I might even want to get even with the person who made me angry.
Yeah, I could hurt them really bad.
You could, but then you'd be as bad as they are.
I bet if some guy were trying to kill you, you'd kill him first.
Protect my family. Yeah, I guess I would.
Yeah.
I probably won't be an astronaut.
Don't say that, James.
You could be anything you wanna be.
- I'm really good at math.
- See? There you go.
You could be a scientist or a programmer, an inventor, even.
Yeah, right. Like I'll have a chance.
I live in a fucking group-home orphanage, remember?
- Come on, man. Don't say that.
- It's true. You want me to lie?
No, I don't.
The penguins like it better when I lie.
- The penguins?
- Stupid nuns.
"No, Sister, I didn't break the window. "
"Yes, Sister, I did my homework. "
They're just...
James, let me ask you something.
You ever seen this man before?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- You really think I could be an inventor?
- Of course I do.
I could build a space ship that travels really fast.
Like, faster than the speed of light.
So fast that it gets to where it's going before it ever left in the first place, ending up in the past.
- A time machine.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I could go back to the past, fix my life.
What do you mean, fix your life?
No, I feel like such a ball head.
I don't know if that goes there or not.
So, how did it go?
It was all right.
- Louis is pretty cool.
- Pretty cool.
Thanks.
You're welcome, James.
It was nice hanging out with you.
All right, James, time for dinner.
No, I want to show Louis something.
Come on.
This your bed?
So, you wanted to show me something?
I don't know.
I've never shown this to anyone.
It's secret.
But we're friends, right?
Yes. Yes, we are.
Promise not to tell anyone.
Especially the penguins.
Okay.
Cross your heart and hope to die.
I do.
Cross my heart...
Cross my heart...
...and hope to die.
...and hope to die.
Okay.
The reason I wanted to go to the zoo is because
I make my own zoos.
They're personal and private to me, but I'll show you them if you promise you'll come back and visit.
Okay, I promise.
You're too late.
I made it myself.
No one helped me.
James, these animals are dead.
You hurt them.
You don't understand. I made this myself.
Forget it! I knew
I shouldn't have shown you! I knew it!
No, I'm glad you showed me. It's just...
Get out of here! Get out of here! I hate you!
Why'd you come? You're not my friend!
No, I am your friend. It's just, sometimes, friends have to say things that are difficult to hear.
Fuck you! Fuck you, fucker! I hate you!
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- He tried to hurt me!
- He tried to touch me!
- No. No, I...
He tried to touch me here, like my other parents did.
- No. No, I didn't.
- Make him leave!
I know. This is just something he says because he gets attention for saying it.
Now I really think you should go.
Do you know what he has in there?
You promised! You swore!
Hope to die! Hope to die!
No, I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry.
- You should go.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Kayla?
- I ran more tests.
- And?
- I got the lab to myself, but only for the next hour.
You've got to see this. It's insane.
I'm on my way.
Well, the tests were consistent.
The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me.
- So it's the same person?
- Absolutely.
But here's the crazy thing.
It's the cloth itself.
I've never seen a weave structure like this before.
You should take a look.
Here, that's the sample you gave me.
Go ahead.
Okay, I can see it.
Now watch this.
When I apply the heat lamp, the strands actually expand.
And when I take it away, they contract.
Cloth that reacts to temperature.
Is that military?
I have no idea.
But whoever invented this could make a fortune.
Unless it hasn't been invented yet.
I could build a space ship.
Ending up in the past.
A time machine.
Thanks, Kayla.
Well, the tests were consistent.
The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me.
- So it's the same person?
- Absolutely.
I could go back to the past, fix my life.
Why are you doing this?
I'm just putting things right.
Oh, shit!
This is Gordon.
It's me, Gordo.
Where the fuck are you?
Man, it doesn't matter.
What matters is that I figured it out.
It's pretty insane, but I figured it out, Gordo.
Yeah. Right, right. Are you okay?
What if you thought a little boy was a killer?
What are you talking about?
We thought the fingerprint from the journal was the killer's.
It's not. It's the kid's.
It matches because the kid is the killer.
The killer's DNA matches the kid's exactly.
The guy wears cloth that hasn't been invented yet.
And the piece of paper from his journal, well, it's dated 20 years from now.
It all makes sense. That's why he's always one step ahead of me.
It's the kid's older self. Do you get it?
He's traveling through time, and he's gonna kill again tomorrow, Gordo.
- You hear me?
- Yeah.
- He's gonna kill again.
- Louis. Louis, you know I'm here for you, right, pal?
I will always be here for you.
You son of a bitch.
What?
Tracing the call. You son of a...
Louis, Louis! You got it?
Not an exact pinpoint, but we got the general area.
He's 20 to 50 miles up north on Route 14.
Let's go. Everyone, come on, get out there.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Hi. Sorry, but you're listed, and I needed to talk.
Of course.
You've had a hell of a day.
He's a very troubled boy. Don't fool yourself.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Yes, please.
Do you think people are born evil, or does the world make them that way?
That's a big question.
I think people are basically good.
Evil's an accident.
An error. An error of growing up that causes people to make the wrong choices for what they think are the right reasons.
So, you don't think people intend evil?
No. I've seen too many kids.
They wanna be good.
Then life just doesn't work a certain way, and wrong choices have a way of multiplying.
Even Hitler didn't think he was evil.
He thought he was saving the world.
Manson, too, in his own way.
But what if you could kill Manson or Hitler when he's still a child?
No way. They're children.
They're not Hitler or Manson. Not yet, no.
You're talking about James.
He's had a troubled life, but there's hope for him.
- He's just a child.
- People are dead because of him.
- Who? James?
- And more people are gonna die.
- What are you talking about?
- What's your name?
What?
- Your name. What's your name?
- Polly.
Anne.
Anne is my birth name, but because of my sunny disposition, my friends called me Pollyanna.
Polly for short.
It's a nickname that sort of stuck.
What is going on?
Why are you carrying a gun?
Anne Brighton. I have to stop this.
I'm sorry. Please don't go anywhere.
It's not safe. I have to...
Freeze! Police!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
- Get down! Get down!
He's gonna kill Polly.
- Down! Down! On the ground, now!
- Gordo! Wait, wait! He's gonna kill Polly.
Anne Brighton! He's gonna kill Polly.
- Get down! Now!
- Anne Brighton, she's next on the list!
Gun. Gun!
You don't understand!
I'm trying to save her life!
She's the one who called us.
Said you were acting all crazy, threatening a child.
- You don't understand!
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
Louis Hicks, you have the right to remain silent.
- Gordo, listen to me!
- Anything you say...
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Listen to me, Gordo!
The boy and the killer are the same!
- You have the right to talk to a lawyer...
- The boy and the killer are the same!
- ... while being present!
- The boy and the killer are the same!
Louis...
Copy that. I'll tell her.
Okay, miss, you can relax.
We have him in custody.
Thank you. That's great.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Call me if you need me.
- All right.
- All right.
You betrayed me, Anne.
Polly. Anne. Whatever your name is.
You don't know it yet, but you're about to betray the boy.
And I can't let you do that.
I'm sorry. You were like a mother to me.
- Time travel?
- Those things he said.
"You'll never write another book. "
"I'm making things right. "
He had a revenge fantasy as a child, and now he's making it happen.
Listen, his next victim, Anne Brighton, is April 22nd, today.
And you think this because an 11-year-old told you he wants to make a time machine.
Check the date on the article.
It's more than 20 years from now.
Come on. My kid can make that on her laptop in five minutes.
There's a cloth from his jacket that hasn't even been invented yet.
- Where is it?
- Listen to me! You're not listening to me!
Listen to me!
Everyone connected to him is dead.
Felicia was the DA on his custody case.
Vicki Ihling was the teacher that returned him to the orphanage.
The boy... The boy is the only thing they both had in common.
They also had you in common.
Your lawyer's here.
Detective, I'd like a private conference with my client.
Sure.
Thank you.
Did you mean it? When you said,
"Cross my heart and hope to die"?
I thought we were friends.
We went to the zoo together.
That wasn't so long ago, was it?
Now I'm all grown up.
And I get to fix the world, my world.
To make it a better place for that boy.
That boy who never meant to hurt anyone, that boy who just wanted a chance.
A chance, a chance, a chance.
Random counter, root applied to...
You're insane.
Time travel is complex.
You have no idea how complex.
I have to choose the exact moment in time to end someone's lifespan so the ripple effect has the specific impact I want it to have.
Do you know the sheer number of calculations necessary?
It would blow your mind.
I thought we were friends.
Why are you doing this to me?
To you?
You don't get it, do you?
You promised that you'd come back for me.
You never did.
I waited and waited for months.
Do you know how long a month is for a little boy waiting for his hero to return?
- I'm sorry, James.
- Don't you fucking call me that.
I ran away from that shit-hole orphanage.
I lived on the streets until I was old enough to lie my way into joining the army.
They've taught me how to kill in so many different ways.
Then they sent me to school.
Turns out I had a real facility for math.
Worked on some classified shit.
You gave me that idea, you know?
You told me,
"You can be anything you choose.
An inventor, even. "
Hey. You wanna see it?
I made it portable.
Nanotechnology.
Are you proud of me?
Time to go.
- Wait.
- Bye-bye.
- Wait!
- Okay.
See, you don't get it.
Every move you make,
I've already planned for.
Oh, no.
I probably should have warned you about that.
The first jump really messes with your insides.
I remember my first jump.
It was a sweaty, filthy evening 11 years ago.
I cut her heart out. Dear Mom.
Rest her soul.
I paid her back in advance for a lifetime of misery.
She was the definition of shitty mom.
Addict, fondler.
Killing her didn't solve anything, and they then sent me to live with Aunt Carol, who made my crack-whore mommy look like a saint.
So, I offed her, too.
But I couldn't stop there.
You see, every time I fixed something, something else needed to be fixed.
Time doesn't like to be messed with.
But that's when I figured it out.
You're the problem.
Each time I revisited this week in my life, you were always there to mess things up, so this time, I made you part of the solution.
The future, in black and white.
You see, you bring the boy here, and he becomes a hero.
See, I never had a chance.
You're his chance, his only chance.
My chance. Now, go get him. He trusts you.
Not sold? Okay.
If you don't bring the boy back here in 15 minutes,
I'm gonna gut her and make her eat her own intestines.
You'd better hurry.
No. No! No, no, no, no, no.
What do you mean you never saw them leave?
What the fuck did they do?
Beam up to the mother ship?
Like I said, when I came in the room, they were gone.
Gone? They Houdini'd out of here, right?
That's what I'm supposed to believe?
That's bullshit! It just doesn't happen!
The social worker, she was on the list, right?
- She's next?
- Yeah.
But he kept talking about the boy, so he might have headed back to the orphanage.
Okay. Okay. I'll take a team there.
You take Maddox and go check on that girl.
- Louis?
- Hey, James.
What are you doing here?
I came back for you.
Yeah?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay, come on.
Okay, buddy, get your shoes on.
Okay, go, go. Go, go, go.
I'm sorry I'm not what you thought the future would look like.
Listen to me. I need you to stay in here.
- Why?
- Just trust me, please.
Where's the boy?
You let her go and I'll tell you.
Promise?
Cross your heart and hope to die?
Yes. Now let her go.
Hey, kid, it's good to see you.
Who is he?
My name is James, too.
Same as you. James Keech.
- Are you my dad?
- No.
I'm you, James, from the future.
You know how you wanted to go back in time and fix things?
Well, you did it.
I'm you, just older.
- We're the same.
- No, you're not, James.
- You'll never be him.
- Don't listen to him. Listen to me.
- To us.
- Are you gonna hurt her?
But she's always been so good to me.
But you don't know the future. I do.
In a few days, she's gonna find your private zoo, and they're gonna lock you away with crazy people.
They will do unspeakable things to you.
They will burn you, and cut you, and worse.
And I am not gonna let them do that to you.
Don't look at him. He's not your friend.
Go ahead, kill me. Nothing changes.
He still becomes me.
But if he kills you, he becomes a hero.
Welcome to the future.
What's happening? What's...
James? James!
James!
I'm so sorry, James.
I'm sorry, James. I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I remember, but I do.
Keech was right. Time travel is complex.
The one thing he could never predict was his own death.
When his younger self died, reality itself was realigned.
I woke up in a new world, a world where the killer never came to be.
Where his victims lived their lives never knowing how close they'd come to their own demise.
In this new world, those terrible few days never happened.
In this world, a troubled boy never became a killer.
He got a second chance.
Then again, so did I.
Daddy! Daddy! You're home!
I missed you, buddy.
I'm taking the teaching job.
Welcome home.

The Hammer of Invincibility.
The demon way.
Condor.
Ragnerok.
The Hammer of Invincibility.
Odin.
Open...
Gateway....
To Asgard!
Loki!
'Tis the demon Loki!
All off his radial bows!
Fire at the ready!
Stand your ground in the name of Odin!
Fire!
This portends to be an evil day.
Baldir?
Why did the Norns summon father?
The weavers of fate will tell father soon enough.
Now hurry. The gate will be closed soon.
Father!
Some evil is upon us.
I must go see the Norns.
We'll go with you, father.
I must do this alone.
You return to the safety of Valhalla.
Come on.
Hurry, or the gate will close. Come on.
Send them deep into Hell!
So their doom has spread its plume.
And none too soon.
And none too soon.
It is a dark day,
Odin, King of Asgard, that we summon you here to see us.
I would come for no one else.
Now speak your minds and be done with it.
I have dreamt of the stars in the sky turning black.
What does this mean?
It is a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Have you brought the Hammer of Invincibility?
This Hammer was forged by my father from the center of the Tree of Life.
His power is in this Hammer.
That Hammer is the only weapon that can kill the mighty tree it came from.
The source of life on which the mortal earth and all other worlds depend.
Now Loki has arrived to take that life.
So you must give the
Hammer of Invincibility to him.
To Loki? Never.
The time has come for Ragnerok.
Before the Sun goes down this day it will be the destruction of all worlds.
Of Asgard, Earth, and all the other worlds as well.
And you are powerless to stop it.
We'll see about that.
Thor, come on.
Is this fate?
Destroy one world... then weave another.
That is how it's done.
Your doom is decided...
And the fall of your kingdom has already begun.
I don't believe in fate.
Find me the Hammer of Invincibility, my Garmr, and this world will be yours to control.
Onward to Valhalla.
To arms! To arms!
Invasion!
Someone approaches from the north!
Drop the gates now!
Wait!
We don't have to listen to them.
We can weave our own fate.
We can control our destiny.
That is why you are the younger brother.
We can't give up.
A God of the Aesir never gives up.
I will face my own death with honor and dignity, and I suggest you do the same.
Enough!
I want to see Odin!
Odin will never speak to you.
I want the Hammer of Invincibility.
The Hammer is not yours to take.
Odin!
Odin!
I want the Hammer!
Our fate is upon us.
You two fly at the creatures to the left.
I'll cut down through the center.
We'll meet in the middle.
Yes, father.
Yes, father.
You stay back behind your brother.
But father, I can fight.
I'm not afraid.
No, son. I question not your heart, but your experience.
I need you at the end of the battle.
I need you for the finish.
Yes, father.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Thor!
Where is Thor?
He was by my side,
I swear.
Suddenly he was gone.
I wanted to die with both my sons.
Odin!
Loki!
Do not think
I'll lie and die for you.
You can't stop the future, Odin.
Give me the Hammer.
You know it's your fate.
Just give me the Hammer, Odin.
Just give me the Hammer.
We don't have to go through this, and I'll go away.
I'll just go away.
Loki!
No! No!
No! No!
My son!
Father...
Give Thor a chance...
To change...
Our fate.
Finally now it's mine.
You want this?
Back where you came!
Tell me.
Tell me where you sent it!
Find it.
Search every cave, every tree in Asgard.
Now.
No! No!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Brother?
What should I do?
Father!
Father.
Thor.
Live.
You live.
Yes. Where's your potion of healing, father?
No.
Where's your potion?
There's not time for that, my son.
It's too late.
Don't waste it.
Use it for another cause.
My father's Hammer...
I sent it... to the heart of the Tree of Life.
My son... must alone retrieve it... before Loki.
Forget the Hammer, father.
It's Loki I want, to avenge your death.
My brother's.
My son... you still think with your heart, not your mind.
The Hammer will appear... on the first full moon...
Tomorrow...
For a moment.
If you don't retrieve it, it's lost forever.
You must retrieve it, my son.
Yes, father.
You are King.
You are our chance to save all that is good.
To change the fate of men.
To change the fate of the gods.
Thor...
You are my son.
Loki!
Loki!
Loki!
Come out and fight me, you coward!
Now the real coward is on his back, just like Odin after I killed him.
You should have heard your father beg.
My father wouldn't ask a thing from you.
Oh, he cried.
He pleaded don't hurt me.
Liar!
You are the coward!
Fight me like a warrior.
Tell me where the Hammer of Invincibility is.
Release me and fight!
Your father spoke to you with his last breath.
I can smell it.
What did he say?
He said that you're as worthless as your dogs.
Let's go!
Let's go! Move!
Who are you?
Come on!
Come on! Move!
Why are you helping me?
Move!
Find them.
Kill the girl any way you like, but Thor lives for now.
Go!
Go!
All right.
Shh!
I'm Thor.
I know.
Who are you?
I'm Jarnsaxa.
I'm a servant of your father.
He asked me to protect you.
Then let's avenge my father's death.
I can't kill Loki alone, and you do not yet have the fighting skills to help.
Shh!
You don't know my--
Quiet!
What?
Come on.
It's time we go.
Come on. This is a battle we cannot win.
We must hide.
Odin!
Odin!
Your world is over.
Mine is next.
And your Tree of Life is finished.
Ah, my pet.
You found them.
Now lead me.
I'm not going to keep running from Loki like some coward.
You think you're ready to fight Loki? Huh?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not going to fight some girl.
I am a fraction of your size and I managed to best you three times.
Here.
Clear?
Huh?
Fine.
There it is.
Come on.
The portal is open.
Hurry!
Make this land a chasm of death.
Stop! Stop!
What?
What is this place?
It's a training camp protected by a powerful rune stone far older than Loki.
No enemy can enter uninvited.
We must go to the gateway.
Come on!
What gateway?
To the Tree of Life to get the Hammer.
It can't be.
This is a secret place.
How could Loki have destroyed it?
Destroyed what?
A direct portal to Midgard.
Perhaps the Norns had something to do with this.
The Norns? But they're neutral in these matters.
I'm not so sure.
Thor!
I can hear you.
Why delay the inevitable?
Where is he?
He's outside the protective barrier of the rune stone.
I don't see him.
Nor he us.
Odin is gone.
I will possess the Hammer.
We should take the fight to him.
How can we fight Loki if the fates are against us?
I don't believe in fate.
Coward, where are you?
You wanna play games?
I have games of my own
I can play.
Come, my friends.
We're trapped.
Our only chance is to wait until nightfall and then we sneak out of here.
A warrior God doesn't sneak around at night.
A warrior uses his cunning and temperance to win a battle.
And one of these...
Swung with skill.
I swing hard enough.
Skill, even above strength.
Who taught you how to fight?
I taught myself...
By watching my brother practice when I was small.
Who taught you?
The Valkyries, warrior-guardian of the gods.
I was second in command under Odin's father.
Hmm.
Swing.
Not again.
Skill above strength.
Swing.
You have no chance against Loki unless you learn the skills I have.
Then you better teach me quick,
'cause I'm going to kill Loki the first chance I get.
Thor?
I can hear you.
Come, my friends!
This is much more comfortable.
What is that?
They're coming.
I thought you said nothing could come in here uninvited.
I think I was wrong.
What?
We must find the other gateway.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
There isn't time.
Loki's probably on to us.
Then I say we ambush 'em at the next bend, kill him, and be done with it.
Look, even with all you've learned, we're still not a match for his powers.
We have to go to Midgard.
From there's we'll find a way to the Tree of Life.
But the portal was destroyed.
There is another entrance. Come on!
Look what I let them do to my father's land.
Asgard was doomed as soon as Odin died.
You have a different world to save.
Look!
Look!
New life already begins to grow.
There is hope after all.
Come on.
The gateway is just beyond these trees.
No, no, no. No!
Thor!
It didn't have to be this way.
Could have died without her, Thor.
You want the Hammer of Invincibility?
Here. Take it!
Go!
Go!
Yes.
No!
Thor?
Tell me that was not the Hammer you gave to Loki.
Of course I didn't.
I saw it!
It was always the ax.
I only made him think that it was the Hammer.
But I saw it.
You were within range.
Come on.
Loki can't be far behind.
My place is right up here.
Give me your purse.
No.
I said give me your purse.
Thank you.
Now you gotta pay.
Give me your wallet.
Thor, we don't want to be noticed like this.
Come on. Let's go.
This way. This way.
Go!
This does not seem like the dwelling of a demigoddess.
It's not supposed to.
The people here must think I'm human.
They don't believe in the Tree of Life anymore.
Here. Wear this.
You'll be less conspicuous.
Here. Take this.
Careful.
These are very powerful.
It's from Midgard.
How do you use it?
Here. Just put your finger here.
This one goes up here.
Good. Be sure this is pulled.
Now pull the trigger.
Just think of it as the shaft of a spear, and aim your point at the center of your target.
Good.
Your humans certainly understand their weaponry.
They're warriors... like the gods.
I'm beginning to like your humans even more.
We are...here.
And the nearest channel to the heart of the tree is here.
But we're going to have to open it ourselves.
How?
The tree will tell us how when the time comes.
We could wait until the dark of the night.
Let's do it.
Hmm.
Or we could leave now.
To get the Hammer, we must pass through the gateway portal to the Tree of Life.
Right there.
Here it is.
The opening has been covered up.
Can you feel anything?
A wall.
Well, we must enter the portal now or we won't get to the Hammer in time.
It will just disappear.
And go back to Loki.
Here.
Yes. Yes.
It's under this.
We have to uncover it.
Thor, I need you.
I'm here.
Concentrate with me.
We need a strong channel through us to open it.
Gateway.
Gateway.
Gateway!
Let's go.
Ready?
You feel it?
The presence of the essence of all life, right down to her beating heart.
What is that?
It's the heart beat.
It's coming from down in there.
Wait. Wait.
What if it's a trap?
You should stay.
Why?
Thor, if you die, it's over for all of us.
We go together.
All right.
You cannot escape me, Thor.
I will possess the Hammer of Invincibility.
The heart is on the other side, and the Hammer with it.
Pass through and you will be there.
Aren't you coming?
This part of the journey is for you alone.
There is a knight who guards the Tree of Life.
You must defeat him at all costs.
The heart of the tree.
Where is it?
Where is the Hammer?
Thor!
Father?
Thor, my son, the power of my fathers is now in you.
Use the Hammer.
Find it.
Take this Hammer, son, the power is now yours.
It's yours.
Oh, great Tree of Life, thank you from my heart for all that you have given us.
Give me the strength so that I might save you from destruction.
How will Loki know we've returned?
He'll know.
We must lure him back to Asgard.
I'm going to track
Loki down and kill him.
You're not ready to face Loki yet.
Why? I have the Hammer.
I have the will.
What more do I need?
The powers of your father.
A strategy. An army.
Well, I don't have an army, so I guess I'm on my own.
You're not on your own, Thor.
You should stay far away from me.
Loki is more likely to appear when I'm alone.
Do you trust me, Thor?
Yes.
We should go back to the war camp.
The war camp? Why?
To continue your training.
We will need its protection so one day you can defeat Loki.
One day?
I have to defeat Loki now.
You're not ready yet.
We should go back to the war camp.
Well, we don't have to go back there.
I took the rune stone of protection and put it inside your dwelling place.
Good.
Then we'll go back to my dwelling and safely finish your training there.
No training!
No hiding!
I kill Loki and stop Ragnerok, and that's final.
I know Loki's in here.
Loki!
Come out and face me, Loki!
Son of Odin.
You're no match for me.
The Hammer of Invincibility.
Defend yourself, Loki.
Aah!
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I should have hit him when I had the chance.
You're brave.
Rash, stubborn, but brave.
Wait here. I'll check the perimeter.
Jarnsaxa...
You are a noble warrior.
I thank you.
He's close.
Good. This time I'll be happy to hit him in the back.
No! No!
You were nearly destroyed earlier.
You almost lost the Hammer.
Well, it won't happen again.
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Jarnsaxa cannot be trusted.
She has kissed the demons.
She is a concubine for Midgard.
You must kill her.
Thor?
She only wants the Hammer.
Kill her.
Thor, do not listen to him.
He's playing mind tricks.
He's the devil, the serpent, the spirit of trickery and deception.
Thor!
Thor!
We must go back to my dwelling, to the protection of the rune stone.
No! We can kill him.
I swear it.
Thor, please!
No!
Thor!
This is madness.
He's a liar, a cheater.
Do not believe what you see.
Maybe the Norns were right.
Maybe the Earth is doomed.
I will not let that happen.
I will not let the Norns control my fate... or yours.
We can't kill Loki.
Not two of us, not ten of us.
We must hide the Hammer as Odin did.
For how long?
Maybe centuries.
However long it takes for you to be made ready.
But everything will die.
No matter what Loki does to men and gods, as long as the Tree of Life remains strong all the other can be rebuilt.
At nightfall, then, we return to the protection of our hiding place.
You have the courage of your father and brother in you.
You have my heart,
Jarnsaxa.
Know that.
And you have mine.
One day, you will be able to channel the powers of the universe, to let it fly through your arm like lightning.
Thor?
Oh, no. Thor!
Got you.
Give me the Hammer, Thor.
Good. Use it.
Feel the power of the Hammer.
The bone of Urrl.
It is useless to you.
You cannot control it's power.
And without it, you have no power at all.
Wait!
You will destroy the only thing that can bring back your father.
What do you mean?
Speak!
Your father.
Your brother.
The power of the bone is the only thing that put them in Muspellheim Hell, and it's the only thing that can release them.
Tell me how to use it.
Tell me!
Let me live, and I will show you.
What of Ragnerok?
I'll make it that there is no Ragnerok.
No Ragnerok ever.
You are the devil, full of lies and deceits.
Aah!
Aah!
There is no Ragnerok.
Aah!
You are all safe.
You are all safe.
Give me back the bone so I can live.
Aah!
Give it to me.
Aah!
Thor!
You're alive!
I did it.
Don't you ever--
I killed him.
I killed Loki.
I defeated him.
He's dead.
I saw him melt.
And I took this from him, and he lost all of his power.
Ragnerok is over.
You took the devil's tool.
It's cursed.
You must get rid of it.
But I have his power now.
Even if you do,
Loki's powers are rancid.
They're decayed.
Aren't you happy?
Loki is gone.
His creatures are gone.
It's a trick.
It is not a trick.
Yes, it's a trick.
That is what Loki does.
He tricks.
Why is everything I do on my own wrong? Why?
Because you're young.
And you're inexperienced.
You have more courage and more heart than skills.
But one day--
I'm going to bring my brother and my father back.
You'll see.
Those are lies.
We are not mortal.
We are gods, and they are trapped in the realm of Muspellheim.
And there is nothing you can do about it.
Their fate-- their fate is my fate.
And I have changed my fate.
Have I not defeated Loki?
Am I dead as the Norns had foretold?
Your story is not over, and when it is, one day you will discover that the Norns have sewn your tales in their tapestries from the beginning.
Your father and brother are gone, and you cannot change fate.
Where are we going?
To my dwelling, where I should have taken you long ago.
Where you will be protected.
We must get rid of that wretched thing before it drives you to evil.
Tree of Life, mother of life, guard these doors so that none may enter uninvited.
Destroy that abomination.
Use the Hammer.
I will.
Don't even look at it.
Where are you going?
To find some evidence that Loki's truly dead.
And until I find that evidence, you must promise me that you will not leave the protection of these walls.
I promise.
Swear on your father that you will not leave.
I swear it by the blood of my father.
You're strong, Thor.
You have a lot to learn.
Crush that thing and burn it.
Bring my father back to life.
Bring my father Odin back to life.
Father, I will reach into the halls of my ancestors and grab you.
Bring Odin back to life.
Loki!
How did you get past the rune stone?
You invited me.
I killed you.
You're dead.
Dead?
I never was alive.
Join me, and I'll let your family live.
My family?
You mean my family, my father, who burns to Muspellheim?
And your brother.
Give me the hammer and I'll let them all out.
Liar!
Come on! Come on!
I will not rest until I have it!
Forgive me.
Forgive me for sneaking away earlier.
Are you ready, Thor, to actually take my advice?
Yes, I will take it.
I will listen to what you say.
For my father, who burns in hell.
Good. Then hear me.
We'll return to Valhalla immediately.
Let Loki smash away all the people and the buildings.
And keep that Hammer away from Loki and I promise you, one day you will return to watch him perish in the dirt.
Come, my friends.
How are you, my pet?
They are near.
They can't escape fate.
We can make a gateway here.
I'm going to need you to help me summon it.
But Asgard is a heap of sand and ash.
It has been destroyed.
We'll find a place.
I'll hide you and the Hammer.
I'm not going.
I'm staying here to save the Earth.
Thor!
Thor, please.
We don't have much time.
I beg you! We must keep the Hammer away from Loki.
It's the only weapon that can kill the Tree of Life.
So long the tree lives, there is still a chance to rebuild.
Please!
All right.
Good.
Now, hold the Hammer tight before you.
Channel its powers.
The will in your heart will make it open.
Now, you go through it first.
Jarnsaxa, do you feel
I have the power in me to carry this through to the very end, even if it means
I must fight?
Oh, Thor, you are a God beyond my understanding, the son of the master who I've served.
If you believe in your heart that you must fight,
I will live or die by your side.
I am your soldier.
Then go through, and take this.
Hide it.
Protect it.
Keep it safe from Loki.
I am not leaving this Earth until I have saved it or death takes me.
Thor?
No!
Take it! Hurry!
Before it's too late.
No! I'm not leaving without you.
No!
You shall die witch!
Lindworms!
Lindworms from underneath.
Come to me!
Go through the gateway!
I will stop them! Go!
You can't fight me, Thor.
Fate is on my side.
Every fabric of the universe is against you.
Damn the fabric of the universe.
Loki!
It's mine!
It's mine!
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
No, Jarnsaxa.
I stay here.
To my dwelling then.
The rune stone will protect us.
No.
The gateway!
The gateway to my dwelling!
Gateway!
No!
Jarnsaxa!
Now, let's see.
What am I going to do to you now?
Jarnsaxa.
No, Jarnsaxa.
Jarnsaxa, I'm here.
I'm here.
You'll be all right.
I thought you'd never come.
We've got to get you out of here.
We'll get the potion of healing.
We'll take care of you.
Leave me here.
No, I'll never leave you.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Jarnsaxa?
Very touching.
Jarnsaxa...
I could not change our fate.
I'm sorry.
Odin...
Forgive me.
You are not defeated yet...
My King.
Yes, you are my
King...
Ruler of Asgard who sits atop the universe...
Guardian of all realms.
We're in good hands...
Your hands...
For you are not defeated yet.
Thor!
I want you to witness the final moments of Midgard, when this entire planet becomes the gates to my new kingdom.
It is the end of life, the end of time, and the end of you.
Not quite.
You cling to old dreams.
You are an embarrassment.
I want you to taste the bitterness of my rise to power, go back to your worms and your dogs and leave the true gods of the nine realms in peace.
Soon the nine realms will no longer exist, and the time of Aesir is finished, and I will be ruler of the next kingdom, not Thor.
Behold, the fire of Muspellheim.
In it's fiery depths, your father waits for you... as well as others.
No!
No!
And now I'm off to kill the Tree of Life...
And unleash the final stages of Ragnerok.
Aah!
Close.
It's time.
Father?
Where are you?
Jarnsaxa?
Where are you?
I am gone...
And you are ready.
Nothing is beyond you.
Nothing is beyond you.
Nothing is beyond you.
I will forge my own Hammer.
Die, mother of living earth.
Die.
I will not be stopped!
News reporter:
We're getting reports of scores of unknown creatures destroying urban areas in Southern California.
The U.S. military is doing their best to respond to the threat.
Ragnerok.
Ragnerok!
Ragnerok!
Ragnerok!
Impossible.
I sent you to hell!
The power of that Hammer belongs to me.
There is nothing left to fight for.
It's over.
Nothing is over.
We control our own fate.
Your heart shall beat as long as I live.
How dare you come here, son of Odin.
You are an abomination.
Loki was meant to rule the next chapter of the universe when this one is no more.
But you have killed him.
Dead! Gone!
Against the will of fate, so carefully woven in this loom.
We have chaos in the world.
Shameful chaos!
What have you to say for yourself?
This world is now controlled by those who live here, and it will be, for good or ill, what we ourselves make of it.
That is true fate.

APOLLO 18
JULY 20, 1969- APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT
NEIL ARMSTRONG...
...IS THE FIRST MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON
IN 1970 APOLLO MISSIONS 18, 19, 20 WERE
CANCELLED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONCERNS
7 DECEMBER, 1972- APOLLO 17...
...THE FINAL OFFICIAL LUNAR LANDS
ON THE MOON
IN 2011, 84 HOURS OF CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE
...IS UPLOADED TO WWW.LUNARTRUTH.COM
THIS FILM WAS EDITED FROM
THAT FOOTAGE
This's a lot of at stake here, you know.
Talking, nation versus nation.
The race's still on.
It's a lot to discover up there.
I guess the call came in on a Friday.
They've never been to a barbecue.
JOHN GREY COMMAND MODULE PILOT
Just few beers you know, or more than a few.
Could Vince's cooking, he definitely need few.
Nate took the call from Milton.
And Milton said, "Eighteen is back on"
But it was classified D.O.D., top secret.
Asked him "are you OK with that?
And it was like "are you kidding me?"
I come from a family military pilots.
Duty can sometimes pound on private life.
Make choices. Keep going forward.
NASA already has like 800 pounds rocks.
Nathan Walker; Mission Commander
So why we need more, I don't know,
...but, hey, if it means a trip to the moon.
Placing cameras, we have these
Westinghouses all over the place.
Well, I think the way it's been explained is...
...they're using a Saturn 5 to launch classified D.O.D payload.
...which's meant to be very large very heavy and...
...apparently unmanned.
Apparently.
Placing these high frequency transmitters because...
...really warning anti-missile defense system of Soviyet Union.
These PSD 5 are kind of like high-tech radar scanners.
They should pick up and track anything we can't.
To keep an eye on the Russian's air.
It would be nice to tell my wife.
Benjamin Andersen-Lunar Module Pilot
Or been by my side whole time and then.
She thinks I'm doing training exercise with the Japanese space agency.
Brian, my boy, it would be nice to tell him his father's going to the moon.
I'd love brought to him a souvenir.
Maybe, a moonrock.
I don't know, may be one day.
Ben was always the first in his class.
And I was always running at his heels.
I mean, I'm jealous that he will walk on the moon with Nate...
...while I'm alone in an orbit flight.
My job is essentially to make sure
I'm bringing us home safely.
Look, let's face it. These missions are result-oriented.
And we can't afford the failure you know, can we?
Things can go wrong... things to go wrong happen.
These things you're gonna push them out of your mind.
It's just not an option.
I'm proud to do for these guys, and proud to do for my country.
Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two, one.
Apollo 18, it looks good.
Christmas lights.
- Bring the Christmas lights back?
- I don't know. Not me.
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- No, sorry.
It's amazing.
The earth in all her glory.
There is a good-looking boy.
You sure he's yours?
Watch it.
He's a good kid.
It has a large space to fill.
Play on Moon Boots.
Nate, you've waited all this time to put your foot on the moon...
...and you need to be number 13.
How do you feel about that?
Are you gonna be OK with staying behind John?
Oh, you know, would be nice to have some alone times here.
It's crowded in here.
I keep a light on for you boys.
Don't stay out until late.
- In a couple days.
- Roger that.
See you in a couple days.
Houston, this is Freedom. We're preparing to unboard the Liberty.Over.
OK,18. you can go front dock in four minutes.
John, is the tunnel vented?
Roger that. The tunnel is vented.
OK, we are ready. We'll send you an updated state background on that.
Roger Houston. We're coding the data.
The computer is all yours.
I wish you come with us, John.
- Now, you be careful down there.
- Don't worry about it
- Got a good visual around here
- OK, 18. You're ready for that.
We go to the moon.
1400 feet.
44 down.
OK, good. Down to 1000 feet.
54 LPD.
20 feet down. Repeat, 20 feet down.
OK, good.
Mission Elapsed Time:
Four days, 6 hours and 33 minutes.
Roger.
Here we are.
Take it down.
- Carefull with the line. Over.
- Where?
After that next crater.
4 o'clock.
It seems pretty rocky area. Mark it.
430 feet.
Down 15.
Houston, we have a program alarm
- You have go to 1201 Liberty.
- Roger. Go to 1201.
Do you want to take about reversing that approach?
Negative. We miss the window.
The moon isn't...
- We're closing now. Three, two, one.
- How does it look?
- We're coming in too fast.
- Try to stabilize.
Negative Houston.
The range is long. We go to manual.
- Contact Light.
- Standby everyone.
Stay. No stay.
Stay where you are Liberty.
Houston, give that man a cigar.
- Looks great.
- Excellent landing.
You talking to me or to Nate?
I'm talking you both, kid.
25 December, 1974.
EMD... 4 days nine hours, 23 minutes.
Commander, Nathan Walker.
Ministry of Defense, Mission Report 1A.
For day one of our two-day mission...
This is Thomas Young of
Apollo Mission Control.
- Managed to move our 16 mm cameras.
- Copy.
Looks like 5 reels 10,000 feet
Kodachrome.
Houston, we're prepared for OA1.
Copy Liberty. You are go for decompression chamber.
But not good boys.
We don't want anyone catching cold.
- Copy that.
- Copy that.
I look after him.
Hope that the hose is long enough.
Houston...
...we take now the first step on the South Pole.
I had prepared a speech but
I don't have much audiences anyway.
Do not worry about it.
You will have opportunity soon.
There are rock formations everywhere.
The sun is low on the horizon.
Maybe.
Freedom, do you hear?
Freedom receiving you loud and clear,
Liberty. Over.
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
You call that a salute?
OK. Let me get a shot of you with that LEM in the background.
It's more like a naval salute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got to get this.
I promised Lauren and Brian
Christmas to spend with them.
This's all going back to the
Department of Defense.
We're placing Westinghouse cams.
WESTINGHOUSE MOTION
DETECTION CAMERA
Sounds good, Nate.
Standby.
Motion cencor is tracking you perfectly, Nate
Captain says that we will test the audio when you get back.
I'm checking the payload in the missile unit.
What was that?
Houston, need check that panel for anything that interferences.
Roger. You need to walk to procedure location 1 and initiate the procedure.
Copy. We're on our way.
Hey, take a look at that.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
It's dusty.
Leave the camera here, so you get better view Tommy.
It's hard to believe that the sun never shines in some places.
Careful now, fellows.
If you are in any of those craters, you can call to her
- PSD5 in place.
- Copy that.
You recorded signal frequency on the PSD5 in your training?
- It was without that, wasn't it?
- I thought, it was.
I think they have changed it.
That's the coordinates: 4.3 on Z and...
Inititating sequence is completed.
If we gonna get noise from the high tech again?
Don't worry.
A good geological sample and what appears to be...
...an impact crater.
Samples feel...
...strange.
Let's get out of here.
EMD...four days,
14 hours and 48 minutes.
Commander Nathan Walker.
D.o.D mission report 3C.
Day 1, DVA 1 complete.
I'm starving.
What's the menu tonight?
- Carrots or peas?
- I'll take carrots.
- Get the peas.
- Perfect.
I am many proud of you boys.
- You have good time out there?
- You know we have.
There is much noise in this frequency.
See if I can isolate it.
Cleared up a little bit.
Copy that.
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad, flies through space.
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Just playing mom.
Don't play with your dad's stuff.
- Is this a recording?
- I'm sorry, Dad. I love you.
Beverley is in panic because hairdresser appointment ran over.
Stan and Gene already over, nothing is ready, so...
I offered to help in cutting the peppers.
Couple minutes later I'm in the bathroom taking a leak...
...and with all these peppers in my hands...
Next thing I know, my crotch is on fire.
- So, I'm in the bathroom howling in pain.
- They can not hear you.
They all heard me.
Stan's wife is a nurse, so... she sends me back into the bathroom, with a cup of milk.
Hey, I guess you're about to tell me that you have your balls in a glass of milk?
- Hey, no knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick!
I can't believe that you've never heard that story?
- Beverly's back to Miami?
- Yes. I heard that.
Hear, you divorced because you snore, right?
I do not snore.
Every time!
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- Bumped your head?
- Again!
It's big head.
Good night guys.
Great first day.
- Good night, JD.
- Never should told you that, litle prick.
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.
- What can that be here?
- Give me a second.
Should be on the cam.
What is that?
- Hear that?
- Yes.
I don't think it comes from here.
It does not sound right.
- I can't find down here.
- It's army.
You think this interference can be coming from the PSD5?
We don't see any obvious.
We double check with the D.o.D.
We'll look into it.
You go get some sleep.
I am up.
Turn off the noise.
Good morning, Liberty. We took care of the interference a couple hours ago.
It should be OK now.
Do you get ready for OA2?
EMD... five days, 8 hours and 34 minutes.
And I'm Ben Anderson.
I need to document this.
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.
I got proof.
Hello boys, just to let you know...
...Freedom, we're going to around the corner to the back side.
- No communication a while.
- Roger that.
- I've made you breakfast.
- What do I got?
- Scrambled eggs.
- Again.
- What do you got?
- A delicious hamsbread.
It's all yours.
Just like Mom makes.
Hey, did you remove one of my samples?
One of my samples is on the ground.
What does that mean, Ben?
I don't know.
I bagged and tagged everything.
Look, let's go back in there giving a scoop.
Oh, damn! This one is contaminated.
- I don't understand. How did it get here?
- I don't know.
- This's really bad. How did it get here?
- I don't know.
D.o.D's checked around the interference with the first payload.
So found diagnostics...
Houston, do you copy?
- There is no communication.
- Probably get some blokage.
I see some big craters.
Five days, ten hours, 40 minutes since we left off.
I'm commander Nathan Walker.
We are on DVA 2.
Initiating day 2 receiver cell.
Activated PSD5 transmission signal to go.
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty. Over.
Still down.
There's something with that frequency.
Communication can't be down like that.
- Not for this like the time.
- Where are you going?
What the hell?
- Nate.
- What is it?
- Tracks.
- What?
That's impossible.
These are not ours.
EMD... five days, 11 hours, 7 minutes.
Alan P. Anderson.
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?
Houston, it's 18.
Do you hear?
John is on the back side.
No communication with him either.
Let's see where they lead.
- Impact Crater.
- Feel that?
Yeah, temperature's dropped.
Look at the footprints.
It makes no sense.
Like it runs in circles.
Disoriented.
- How should you do that?
- I don't know.
They go from this direction.
Come over here.
Holly shit!
- It is Russians.
- What the hell?
How can be Russians on the moon and nobody know about them?
We are on the moon and nobody knows about it.
Something is not right.
I'll look inside.
The lights are out.
Somebody's lost it in here.
Everything is crashed.
Their system isn't different from ours.
The power is on.
Oxygen reserve is good.
I can't tell whether they fully operational though.
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.
- I want to take a look around.
- Stay close.
Those Russians could be anywhere.
What the hell?
There is blood. A lot of blood.
Someone's got hurt pretty bad.
I don't like this.
I think I see something inside the crater.
I'll go down.
Wait, Ben. The suits are no ready for that kind of cold.
No cape. The crater is so deep.
It's so cold.
I'll see around.
The ground is different.
It is soft.
Get out of there.
Oh, my god!
It's so cold.
Get out of there.
Ben!
OK, I'm get out of here.
Holy shit!
It's a dead cosmonaut.
I'm on my way up.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm get to go.
What happened here?
- Maybe the other cosmonaut?
- Do you think killed him?
- There is a crack.
- What are you doing?
Get your head out of there.
Wait. Something..
What the hell was that?
It's a rock.
Have it in his jacket down here.
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.
We're on the point of no turning back.
If we don't go now, we're just as dead.
- I don't like someone has died up here.
- I know.
This is a secure line.
I'm just talking to you, right Tommy?
You're just talking to me.
The Russians have been to the moon.
Say that again?
The Russians have landed on the South Pool.
We've found their LK Proton lander.
It has not ended well for the cosmonauts.
- We find the crash of the Russians?
- They didn't crashed.
- We found his body in a crater.
- You found a dead cosmonaut?
Somebody didn't know this?
We landed less than 2 clicks of the Soviets, OK?
You still believe they did not know we were here.
We know they scrapped a manned flight programme in '69.
That was the official word.
Did you know they were here?
Tommy?
This is a D.o.D mission Nate.
I'm just bringing down what I need to know. That's all I can tell you.
Say that prick from the D.o.D to give me a call.
Get some rest. I get the go D.o.D over here and talk to you soon.
Tommie is straight here.
I knew something's wrong from the beginning.
OK, what do you think?
D.o.D's taken over.
Lying to our families.
And the Russians up here for what?
To set up some listening devices?
I don't know.
That makes no sense.
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
That was our president for God's sake.
And you don't think the
D.o.D which is lie to us?
So what are we doing up here?
What we're really doing?
This can be spooky a little.
Strange beauty in the backside.
I do not know if my mind plays tricks on me...
...but every so often you go to those little windows...
...get this sense as if something is looking back.
Looking back to you.
Nate, look at this.
- What?
- Look at this!
The flag is gone.
- This isn't right.
- Houston, this is 18. Over.
Houston, Liberty.
Did you see anything unusual in the
Westinghouse last night?
We had some interferences.
Our flag has gone.
Repeat again.
Repeat once.
Maybe the other cosmonaut took it.
If there is another cosmonaut...
...he would need oxygen for minimum 10 to 12 hours.
- What do you think, John?
- There is no way.
He can not carry that much.
So, how can he survive?
Maybe there is not a 'he'.
You're saying the Soviet flew one man mission?
- It would not be the first time.
- One cosmonaut...
But who took the flag?
Who killed the other cosmonaut we found?
Please get the D.o.D online.
Now.
We suspect that the Soviets are there, but we have no confirmation.
The Intelligence warned that they might be...
...disguising the machines as routine satellite launches.
Why the hell did not you tell us?
National security.
We carried out the card pretty close to the desk. No other option.
I'm sure you can understand.
Maybe a little too close.
We were concerned that they might ride to the sky first.
That would be a national security disaster.
So, where the hell is the other cosmonaut?
They're just gonna leave him here?
Our intelligence suggests there was only one cosmanaut.
Oh, God!
The mission is complete.
Time to get you boys home again.
So, that's it?
First we return home and ask questions later.
- What was that?
- Let's get out of here.
It looks pretty good.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
Wait for my mark.
- Eight...
- Time to go home.
Seven, six...
- That's the alarm.
- We can't go. No go. We are no go.
Save this damn thing.
I try.
I got a power glitch.
Use the spare oxygen.
- We have a leak somewhere.
- I try to isolate the tanks.
See if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
We lost communication.
Dropped out. Closed.
- No, no.
- What the hell is going on?
Houston, this is Liberty. Over.
We just lost communication.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.
Maybe hit the LEM, or a meteor rain.
There's no way no tell.
I'm gonna to the air.
Are you sure about this?
We need communication to get home.
You just stay here and wait.
- Look, I served in the army...
- Shut up.
Go down the platform.
Nothing on the bottom.
EMD...Six days.
13 hours, 46 minutes.
Commander Walker is performing an unplanned DVA...
...to repair the antenna on the Roover.
We experience...we experience some unexplained...
...malfunctions.
The whole installation seems damaged.
Could be the brief impact but I don't see any meteor residue.
- This reaped to pieces.
- Something crashed it?
I can't tell.
We get the same sound each time we activated the communication..
- Go to a different frequency.
- Frequency is blocked.
I never heard anything like it.
Wait. Wait.
Nate, talk to me. What do you see?
Footprint tracks.
Footprints?
Maybe there is another cosmonaut.
No.
Mission Duration:
Six days, 13 hours, 47 minutes.
Commander Nathan Walker.
We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact.
We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact.
Do you know what you're saying?
These tracks are not human.
I found the flag.
It's shreded.
And the motion censor camera gone.
That looks OK.
I'm turning the Roover back up.
The connection looks good.
Try contact to Houston or Freedom.
Freedom, copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Dammit.
- No, looks not working.
- OK. Let me try something.
Wait.
- Something is moving.
- What?
- I don't see anything
- There's something in my boots.
It's in my helmet.
- OK, listen to me. Go back to the lab.
- I can't get it out!
- Listen.Go back to the lab. OK?
- I can't get it out.
There is nothing inside your suit.
Go back to the ship.
It's in my helmet.
Don't take it out!
Nate!
Jesus Christ!
Nate!
Nate!
Nate!
You need oxygen.
Come on Nate! Keep moving.
We're almost there.
Keep moving.
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Almost there.
Pull yourself up.
The door is closed.
Cabin press auto,
4.5 psi.
You don't get enough oxygen.
Breathe! Breathe!
One.
Look at me in the eye.
You'll be fine.
Two.
Two and a half.
The cabin pressure is stable.
It's okay.
So, you OK?
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
You've started screaming, I've come out there and you're on your back.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?Over.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?
We hear you, John. Over.
I can't receive the Liberty, Tommy.
Copy that Freedom.
We have the same problem down here.
Have you tried to change the frequency?
No. We had some sort of interference.
Could have something to do with those PSD5.
We are not sure yet that PDS5 are the source of the problem.
I want to switch shut down the receivers to see what happened.
Negative.
Why not? We got two men down there Tommy. Come on.
Tommy?
Are you there?
We are working on the problem.
We'll keep you adviced.
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great.
God damn it.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
EMD...
Six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.
Post DVA 1,5 hours with Commander Walker
I've already told everything
I remember.
Come on.
Are you paranoid, Ben?
I thought I saw something...
I thought I saw something on the corner of my eye. I was wrong...
...and then there was a shrieking voice...
...and caught off guard.
I must have hit a rock.
That's it.
You said something was in your helmet.
You yelled.
I don't remember that.
Christ! You're bleeding.
Look at your shirt.
You bleed.
Jeez.
Take the first aid kit.
You said that something was inside your suit.
That's what you said.
You said inside your helmet.
I wonder how did you get that wound.
If there is something in your suit, where the hell did it go?
Wait a second.
Nate, I can feel it right here.
Oh, man! Something's inside.
- What are you talking about?
- Look, it's just below the skin.
I need to get that out. OK?
Yeah. OK.
Just make it quick.
Everything is right.
Hang in there!
Damn, it seems to be moving.
Get it out.
- I got it! I got it!
- Get it out!
Jesus!
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.
Put this on it.
It looks like one of my samples.
You said you felt something's moving in your helmet.
I don't understand, how did this get in...
Goddamn, you contaminated the entire ship.
Liberty, do you copy?
Houston, we hear you.
Liberty, do you copy?
Dammit Houston, we hear you.
Liberty, do you receive?
They can't hear us.
Liberty, do you hear?
Those PSD5's...
...what if they're not there to spy on the Russians?
What do you mean?
They told us that the transmitters...
...pick up any frequency, but they don't.
They're blocking our communication, transmitting a signal.
Alright.
And why would they do that?
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
We need to document this.
To attract the Soviets, made the tracks is
...whatever killed the cosmonaut.
All these cameras, man...
...they're watching us.
We are alone.
We are guinea pigs.
That's why they sent us here.
We have to turn off those transmitters.
PSD5's destroyed.
Brilliant.
Nice tracks.
They were here.
Let's check on the other sides.
Liberty, do you copy?
Liberty, do you copy?
Liberty, do you copy?
Something's down here.
It's gone.
Hey, what are you looking at?
This was a bad idea.
You need to get rest, Nate. OK?
We're get to back to lab.
We need to get back, Nate.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.
It's in your blood stream.
The previous wound seems to...
...become infected.
Eyes are extremely bloodshot.
I do not know how to treat it.
Houston, this is Freedom.
I haven't be able to reach Nate or Ben.
Communication's still down with Liberty.
We have no communication with the crew...
...we're receiving data from the LEM.
We're trying to restore the communication now. Standby.
Liberty, this is Houston.
Looks like you can hear us, but we can't hear you.
Block the Westinghouse and survival craft's getting land down.
We estimate 12 hours left on your live support...
...and we are now sorting out the engine problems.
We'll do everything we can to get you home.
... and we are now sorting out the engine problems.
We'll do everything we can to get you home.
They're lying.
No, they'll get us back.
Thay'll get us back.
They want that footage.
- What about the Russian ship?
- The poor Russian bastard.
It looks infected.
Just like me.
I'm getting worse.
Ben...
- ...you must leave me here.
- No.
- No one leaves anyone.
- You have to.
Forget it. We won't die uphere.
Fate has renamed.
The men who went to the moon to export peace...
...remained on the moon to rest in peace.
What the hell are you talking about?
I feel my toughts...fragmenting.
I can be attracted to them.
I'm so tired.
EMD
Six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.
Alan B. Anderson. Doctorial
There were no further communication with Houston.
Oxygen levels are low.
Nate's being sleep for about an hour.
The sickness seems brougth fatigue.
We're not gonna make it here.
If Houston doesn't come up with the plans in the next couple hours, we'll..
...we'll abandon Liberty and go to the Russian LK.
Their communications and oxygen are our only hope.
Just pray to God.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus!
Partial respiration.
Upper left rib...
The infection's spreading.
God damn it.
Must be the same thing that happened to the Russian.
- Nate!
- I don't let you kill me!
It's me. Listen to me. Look at me.
It's me. Ok?
I'm just trying to help you.
You're getting worse.
Don't ever touch me!
- Nate, please, what the hell are you doing?
- They are everywhere.
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us all!
- Stop watch us!
Nate!
You're not gonna watch how I die!
What are you doing? Stop!
Stop!
Come on! You...
Stop there!
Stop that!
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?
Liberty, this is Freedom.
I don't know if you hear me, but
I'm gonna be in the comm range soon.
Guys, we need to get you out of there. There is...
Do you copy?
Come on, guys,
Don't make me leave you here.
Freedom, you read us?
John...John, can you hear me?
Please, anyone... can you hear me?
We are leaving Liberty.
- Come on.
- I had to do it.
Take the camera.
We have 25% of the tank.
We can use some reserv.
We'll get there.
I get to get the films.
Black box of the D.o.D
I get to go down.
It's clear.
Come Nate, we go.
They are everywhere.
You can't help me.
You don't have to be here.
That's OK.
- It's gonna be OK.
- Alright. We're gonna make it.
They're waiting for me.
We are not safe here.
- Get rid of me.
- Hang in.
What the hell are you doing?
Hang on!
Nate!
Nate!
EMD
I don't know...
Roover has been destroyed.
There is no sign of Commander Walker.
American astronaut,
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.
Oxygen is getting low.
I'm...
I'm gonna search for the Russian later.
Hey, Commander Walker.
Nate!
Go away from here, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.
There's nothing here, OK?
You get to come with me.
God damn it! We need get moving.
Ben, listen to me.
We're running out of time here, please.
You must find the LK? Their system is identical with ours. Save yourself.
No, Nate! I'm not going.
You're coming with me.
You have to leave me here.
Just get the John.
- I'm not leaving here!
- You can't help me.
But you can save yourself...
Nate!
Nate!
Can you hear me?
Nate!
Answer me!
Do you hear me?
Say something Nate.
Nate, where are you?
No! No!
My god. No!
John, Nate is gone.
Repeat, Nate is gone.
Please, can somebody hear me?
Oh, my God!
Nate!
Come on!
Frequency is completed.
This is an American astronaut.
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.
Been copy?
This is Apollo 18. Do you copy?
Anyone, do you copy?
Anyone, please. Do you copy?
Anything, anybody, do you copy?
Damn!
Confirming Commander Walker.
- Acknowledge.
- This is Captain Ben Anderson...
Do you copy?
This is Ben Anderson.
Copy, anybody?
Anybody, please! Do you read me?
Captain Anderson, this is the
Deputy Secretary of Defense.
What?
D.o.D? Yes.
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson.
We communicate with the Russians and they're putting me through you.
We're aware of your condition that...
...and we have decided.
- ...we can't you home.
- No. No, no!
Listen to me please.
Nate get a cut on his body. He's infected.
There's nothing on me. Please, have to come and get me.
We can't get you.
We can't get you.
Please...
Listen, I...I...got a family and I need my family.
We'll let your family know you died a hero.
I'm sorry Captain.
You have to get me out of here!
And you fucking do it right now!
I will not give up until you get me home!
Houston, please.
We'll stay in on this channel with you but the decision is final.
You've done a great service for your country, son.
EMD...
Still no communication.
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad, flies through the space.
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Just playing, mom.
Do not play with the your dad's stuff.
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.
...love you.
...Dad, I love you.
...love you.
This is Freedom, are you hearing me?
- This is Freedom...
- John, it's Ben. I hear you.
Ben, is that you?
Do you copy?
Yes, John, I am.
I hear you.
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?
- Soviet's LK.
- Yes. Good for you.
They left me, John.
Left me here!
Where is Nate? How's he?
Get sick, he did not make it.
There's something down here, John.
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!
Forget about the D.o.D, man.
Ben, I'm get you out of there, OK?
Did you figure out that thing?
I don't have much choice. Do we?
Powers look good.
And there is plenty fuel.
Okay, buddy. You're gonna be in the darkness yet...
...you're gonna need to get your synchronized orbit...
...then you need a little space for.
Safely on board.
How does that sound?
Sounds beautiful Johnny.
Sound very beautiful.
I don't mean rush you partner but we're running out of time.
Get that thing in the orbit.
We can run into it.
I got it! I got it, John.
Seven. Six.
Five.
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!
I can't let you in.
- I'm coming there.
- No, no!
Nate, please!
- Nate, stop this Nate!
- What'd you mean? - It's Nate!
- What is happening?
- Come on buddy! Stop!
Stop!
- What's going on?
- Don't do this! -What do you think?
Jesus Christ! No!
Nate!
Nate!
Oh, my God!
Nate!
No!
No, no, no!
You can launch.
You must do it now.
Our window is almost gone.
You have to launch.
Dammit, they were kind of too close.
We're going home!
Ben, listen to me now.
We're going to go home.
Heard that? We're going to go home.
I'm going home.
We lifted up!
Freedom, do you read?
This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.
I repeat. You will not recover him.
Contaminated by what?
D.o.D?
- What do you say? Where is Tommy?
- You will not recover Anderson.
This a direct order.
I'm on my way.
John, you're abording the rescue immediately.
Captain Anderson has been contaminated.
You knew something was down there and you sent them anyway!
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
D.o.D to Freedom
If you're not abording in 60 seconds...
...transmittion will be terminated.
You'll not receive updated statement.
You'll run out of life support craft and you'll not return home.
You have 45 seconds to abort the rescue.
John, we have no choice.
We're begging you. Do not rescue!
God damn it, Ben!
We're going home.
I'm in the orbit.
Ben!
They tricked me.
John, get out of here.
Ben, you're coming in too fast!
Ben, your impact, slow it down!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I like the hat.
I just picked it up.
Did you remember your revolver?
Knew I forgot something.
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.
I think that's quite enough.
You are a doctor, after all.
Always nice to see you. Watson.
Where's the inspector?
He's getting his troops lined up.
HOLMES:
That could be all day.
MAN:
Sherlock Holmes.
And his loyal dog.
Tell me, doctor...
...as a medical man.
Have you enjoyed my work?
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.
HOLMES:
Watson. Don't.
Observe.
How did you see that?
Because I was looking for it.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
WATSON:
Lord Blackwood.
You seem surprised.
I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he.
Indeed.
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o.
Good lad.
Impeccable timing. Lestrade.
We've one for the doctor...
...and one for the rope.
- Clarkie?
- Sir?
This woman needs a hospital immediately.
Put her in the back of the Moriah.
POLICEMAN 1:
Right, lads. That's it.
POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads.
POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir.
If you don't mind.
Get him out of my sight.
And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired me.
Not the Yard.
Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me.
Well. London will breathe a sigh of relief.
Indeed. Congratulations. Lestrade.
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.
MAN:
Gentlemen.
Cheese.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
[BELL TOLLING]
MAN 1: Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.
WATSON:
156 over 80. Very good.
MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you.
Tell me something.
Your new premises...
...when are you moving in?
I should be in within the week.
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.
[GUNSHOTS]
Good God.
- That was gunfire.
- No.
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?
My colleague's probably just putting up a painting.
I'll... I'll go and check.
- Your colleague...
- Yes?
Won't be moving with you, will he?
No, he won't.
Mrs. Hudson.
I won't go in.
Not while he's got a gun in his hand.
You don't have to. Give me the paper.
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.
He just needs another case. That's all.
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know.
Not in a domestic environment.
[GUNSHOT]
Thank you. Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?
- Same time next week.
HUDSON: Come along, captain.
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.
Permission to enter the armory?
HOLMES:
Granted.
Watson. I am in the process of inventing a device...
...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
[HOLMES YELLS]
WATSON:
It's not working.
Can I see that?
[FIRE WHISTLING]
You know, it's been three months...
...since your last case.
HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...
[HOLMES YELLS]
Don't you think it's time you found another one?
I can't but agree.
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.
The sooner, the better.
Paper.
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.
Is it November?
Yes. Holmes. All right.
Lady Radford reports...
Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared.
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies.
Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
Yes.
It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
[DOOR OPENS]
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...
There's only one case that intrigues me at present:
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson.
The absentee landlady.
I've been studying her comings and goings.
They appear most sinister.
Tea. Mr. Holmes?
Is it poisoned, nanny?
There's enough of that in you already.
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...
...as per usual, nanny.
He's killed the dog. Again.
WATSON:
What have you done to Gladstone now?
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.
He doesn't mind.
Holmes, as your doctor...
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.
There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all.
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.
Mary's coming.
- Not available.
- You're meeting her. Holmes.
Have you proposed yet?
- No. I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.
It's happening, whether you like it or not.
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.
You wear a jacket.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
A man? Outside my house?
Straighten your tie.
[WATCH TICKING]
WATSON: Holmes.
- Mm.
You're early.
Fashionably.
Miss Mary Morstan.
My goodness. What a pleasure.
I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
Pleasure is mine.
It really is quite a thrill to meet you.
Mr. Holmes.
I've heard so much about you.
I have a pile of detective novels at home.
- Wilkie Collins. Poe.
- It's true.
It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes...
...making grand assumptions out of tiny details.
That's not quite right, is it?
In fact, the little details are by far the most important.
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.
A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war...
...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave.
Born to be a man of action.
And neat, like all military men.
Now. I check his pockets.
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.
He's cost us the rent more than once.
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes.
You know John very well.
What about a complete stranger?
- What can you tell about me?
- You?
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.
- I insist.
- You insist?
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.
- You're a governess.
- Well done.
Yes, well done. Shall we...?
- Waiter?
- Your student...
...is a boy of 8.
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- HOLMES: Charlie, huh?
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.
Is there ink on my face?
There's nothing wrong with your face.
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.
India blue's nearly impossible to wash off.
A very impetuous act by the boy.
But you're too experienced to react rashly...
...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that.
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.
The jewels you are not wearing tell us more.
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.
The ring is gone.
But the lighter skin suggests...
...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly...
...until you were informed of its true, modest worth.
You broke off the engagement...
...and returned to England for better prospects.
A doctor, perhaps.
Right on all counts. Mr. Holmes.
Apart from one.
I didn't leave him.
He died.
Well done, old boy.
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.
McMURDO:
Get up and fight.
Fight.
- Finish it.
McMURDO: Come on.
Get up and fight, come on.
Come on.
Get up.
MAN 1:
Get up and fight.
That's it, big man, we're done.
You won, congratulations.
We ain't done yet.
[McMURDO SPITS]
HOLMES: This mustn't register
on an emotional level.
First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab.
Counter with cross to left cheek.
Siscombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block, and body shot.
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.
Now fracture.
Break cracked ribs.
Traumatize solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely.
Heel kick to diaphragm.
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...
...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...
...full psychological recovery,
six months...
...capacity to spit at back of head...
...neutralized.
[YELLING STOPS]
MAN 2:
Where did that come from?
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN:
What the hell's going on here. Charlie?
Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir.
It's like he's burning from the inside out.
You lot, shut up!
Charlie. Charlie!
Take this man to the infirmary, now.
What's this all about, then. Blackwood?
There's someone I want to see.
[STRUMMING VIOLIN]
- Watson?
WATSON: Right.
Let's go.
What started merely as an experiment...
...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery.
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...
...there's no measurable response.
You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery?
But, now...
...and this is remarkable...
...if I change to atonal clusters...
...voila, they fly in counterclockwise.
Synchronized concentric circles...
...as though a regimented flock.
Watson, this is exceptional.
I, using musical theory.
Have created order out of chaos.
How did you lure them in?
Excellent question.
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.
You are Blackwood's last request.
Look at those towering structures.
It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted.
Most innovative.
What an industrious empire.
Hm?
Oh. I have your winnings from last night.
You weren't there.
So I made your customary bet.
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook.
Locked safely away in my drawer.
Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?
I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
[SIGHS]
You have the grand gift of silence.
Watson.
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
[GROANS]
I knew she'd been engaged.
She had told me.
So that's no to the opera, then?
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.
I want it back.
[CHATTERING]
This way. Mr. Holmes.
Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
Care to come along?
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.
Suit yourself, mother hen.
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
As though...
...he can get inside their heads.
I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.
BLACKWOOD:
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up...
...having seven heads and 10 horns.
Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy.
They worshiped the dragon.
Which gave power.
They worshiped, saying.
"Who is like unto the beast?"
The beast which I saw was like a leopard.
His feet were of a bear.
His mouth was of a lion...
...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.
I love what you've done with the place.
So glad you could accept my invitation.
I just have a small point of concern.
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.
While my heart went out to the families of the victims...
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush.
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...
...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting.
So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot.
Either that or, um...
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment.
Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.
You see.
Five lives might have been spared.
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.
Hm.
Sacrifice.
Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain.
After you're hanged, of course.
I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
Then you, too.
Could serve a greater purpose.
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.
I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
You and I are bound together on a journey...
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.
But beneath your mask of logic.
I sense a fragility.
That worries me.
Steel your mind. Holmes.
I need you.
You've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.
Pay attention.
Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.
You must accept that this is beyond your control...
...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible...
...it'll be the last sane thought in your head.
What did he want?
Not sure.
But I don't think you're needed. Father.
Not for this one.
MAN:
Lord Henry Blackwood...
...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic...
...the unholy murder of five innocent young women...
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.
Do you have any final words?
Death...
...is only the beginning.
PRIEST:
...Forever and ever. Amen.
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
I much prefer to travel in the winter.
Here. I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...
...and your favorite...
...olives from the Cyclades.
Thought we might have a little tea party.
And while I was setting the table.
I found this:
A file with my name on it.
"Theft of Velazquez portrait from king of Spain."
"Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...
...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess."
I was simply studying your methods...
...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
Ah.
But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
But your signature was clear.
Is that the maharajah's missing diamond?
Or just another souvenir?
Let's not dwell on the past.
Shall we?
By the looks of things.
You're between jobs.
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?
He was boring and jealous.
And he snored.
I'm Irene Adler again.
[FARTING]
Thank you.
[SNIFFING]
I need your help.
I need you to find someone.
Why are you always so suspicious?
Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
I think you'll find all the information you need inside.
Who are you working for?
So I'll have to find out the hard way?
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.
Well, consider it a wager that you will.
Do you remember The Grand?
They gave me our old room.
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.
Ma'am.
- He'll do it.
MAN 1: Well done. Miss Adler.
That's precisely why I hired you.
I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours.
MAN 1:
He'd better.
Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
He's essential to my plan.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
MAN 3: What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.
A little rifle range would go a long way, sir...
...rubbing the calluses off these German bands.
God save the queen.
God save the queen, sir.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
Look at you.
Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal?
Are you a masochist?
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.
She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice.
Made a proper idiot out of you.
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?
It doesn't matter.
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.
She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
That's of no consequence to you, is it?
We've done our last case together.
WATSON:
I've already read it.
Missing person:
Luke Reordan. 4 foot 10.
Red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.
- Midget.
- Do you agree?
No. I don't agree.
It's more than technicality, you see.
You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No. I am simply stating that one has...
What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.
[YELLS]
WATSON:
Holmes. Where are you going?
[CRASHING AND GLASS SHATTERING]
HOLMES:
Watson.
Watson.
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.
Oh. My lucky day.
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?
Don't move.
Now, what have we got here?
[ADLER GASPS]
It's...
Thank you.
That's the Irene I know.
WOMAN:
Good boy.
This man intrigues me. Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.
She's scared of him.
Yet she works for him.
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...
...but I advise you leave the case alone.
Well. I may not have a choice.
After all. I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you.
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once.
What's he done now.
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."
No, "you" means you.
CLARK:
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...
Well...
...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir.
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.
I pronounced the man dead myself.
What are the facts?
Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning.
I'll leave this in your capable hands.
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.
Don't try that.
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.
Certainly.
What's the major concern?
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?
Yes, as you should.
It's a matter of professional integrity.
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
Who do you think won the match.
Clarkie?
- Sir?
- The rugby match.
Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence.
Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
LESTRADE:
You took your time. Holmes.
HOLMES:
"And on the third day"...
These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound...
...and they're smashed open from the inside.
Lestrade, what of the coffin?
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?
Anyhow, where's our witness?
He's over there.
And apparently, he is cata...
Cat...
Catatonic, sir.
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.
Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now.
Good day, sir.
Hello.
It's all right.
I'm a doctor.
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
Well?
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.
He had no pulse.
MAN:
Ready.
Down.
Good Lord.
That's not Blackwood.
Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious.
Time of death?
Diptera is...
...approximately...
...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death...
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
May I borrow your pen?
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.
GROUNDSKEEPER:
I know what I saw.
It was Blackwood.
As clear as I see you.
And when the dead walk...
...the living will fill these coffins.
Well, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
LESTRADE: Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.
WATSON:
You really believe he was resurrected?
HOLMES:
The question is not if, but how.
- The game's afoot.
WATSON: Follow your spirit...
HOLMES & WATSON:
And upon this charge, cry:
"God for Harry. England and St. George."
There you are.
Why that certain chips stall.
I don't understand.
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.
WATSON: You know. Holmes.
I've seen things in war I don't understand.
I once met a man who predicted his own death...
...right down to the number and the placement...
...of the bullets that killed him.
You have to admit. Holmes...
...that a supernatural explanation to this case...
...is theoretically possible.
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data.
Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories...
...instead of theories to suit facts.
That said. I believe Adler's midget is the key to this.
WATSON:
Hm.
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound.
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.
Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
Very good. Watson.
You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm.
Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored...
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H, is for?
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.
They should be able to give us an address.
What a coincidence.
There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch.
HOLMES:
Really? I think not.
WATSON:
The time. I have to get back. Holmes.
Taking tea with the in-laws.
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.
WATSON: No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.
We have no need of your lucky heather.
Gypsy woman.
Even if it's to do with Mary?
Oh. Oh.
I see two men. Brothers.
Not in blood, but in bond.
What of Mary?
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.
Go on.
I see patterned tablecloths...
...and, oh, china figurines...
...and, oh, lace doilies.
Doilies.
Lace doilies? Holmes.
Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...
...and, oh, she has a beard and...
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?
Please, enough.
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.
And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
Do you have my money?
You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre.
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!
HOLMES:
I see.
Thank you.
HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.
And I have some change in my pocket.
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.
- Don't give it away here.
- No.
I have to go see Mary.
Give her my best.
And her family, as well.
It does make a considerable difference to me...
...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes.
He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
HOLMES:
Something did.
Irene Adler was here.
Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
[INHALES]
Ah. Putrefaction.
[SNIFFING]
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.
[FLIES BUZZING]
Phosphorous.
Formaldehyde.
It looks like...
...he was attempting to combine...
...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
HOLMES:
More importantly...
...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt.
Peculiar.
Hydrated rhododendron.
[SNIFFS]
- Holmes.
- Hm?
Look at the crest.
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
Of course he was.
The question is, to what end.
Whatever he was working on.
He clearly succeeded.
How so?
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
HOLMES:
Yes.
HOLMES:
Yes.
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?
Maple syrup?
Barley sugar.
Toffee apple.
Let me guess.
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...
...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein.
Just one minute, boys.
Oh. Dredger.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
Meat...
...or potatoes?
My 10 minutes are up.
[GRUNTING]
[IN FRENCH]
[IN FRENCH]
WATSON:
You all right?
[BUZZING]
[GROANING]
Holmes...
...what is that?
DREDGER:
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
[THUDS]
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
WATSON:
Holmes!
[IN ENGLISH] Watson...
...what have you done?
WATSON:
I haven't slept all night.
Not a wink.
Why I ever believed...
...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me...
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.
I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months.
Would you like to know my conclusion?
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?
Why else would I continually be led into situations...
...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else?
You've never complained about my methods before.
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?
How am I complaining? I never complain.
Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning...
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene.
Or the fact that you steal my clothes?
We have a barter system.
Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms?
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.
When do I complain that you experiment on my dog?
- Our dog.
- On the dog.
Gladstone is our dog.
Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
I understand.
- Do you?
- I do.
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.
I'm not sensitive.
What you need is a rest.
My brother. Mycroft.
Has a small estate near Chichester.
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country.
It would be with my future wife.
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.
- You are not...
- What, invited?
Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home?
Now you're not making any sense.
You're not human.
MAN:
John Watson?
Yes.
Your bail's been posted.
WATSON:
Mary.
Just Watson.
I hope you get bail by breakfast.
Because the boys are getting hungry.
[CHATTERING]
LESTRADE:
Step lively.
Back off. Back off.
To which the barman says.
"May I push in your stool?"
[MEN LAUGHING]
Right, you, you're out.
Until next time. Big Joe.
Always a pleasure. Mr. Holmes.
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.
In another life.
You'd have made an excellent criminal.
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.
Now, please tell me you have answers.
All in good time. Lestrade.
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking?
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.
Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.
For whom?
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.
[BLOWING NOSE]
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir...
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.
Mr. Holmes.
Apologies for summoning you like this.
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am.
As to where I am...
...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.
But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...
...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...
...a Brittany sage.
The carriage forked left, then right.
A telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.
And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.
The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.
Lord Chief Justice.
That'd be your official title.
Who you really are is, of course.
Another matter entirely.
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...
...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders...
...in whose headquarters we now sit...
...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square. I think.
As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all.
Yes, well, standard procedure.
I suppose.
[DOOR OPENS]
I daresay we have the right man.
Gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes.
Ambassador Standish from America...
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.
I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
HOLMES:
Yes. Um...
They're practically interesting.
Be as skeptical as you like.
But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries.
The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
What some call the dark arts.
Or practical magic.
STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic. Mr. Holmes.
We don't expect you to share our faith...
...merely our fears.
Fear is the more infectious condition.
In this instance...
...fear of your own child.
Blackwood is your son.
You have the same irises.
A rare dark green...
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...
...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline...
...which makes you either brothers...
...or, in this case, more likely.
Father and son.
Very few people are privy to that information...
...and we want to keep it that way.
He was conceived during one of our rituals.
His mother wasn't my wife...
...but she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner...
...though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
Death followed him wherever he went.
Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
He killed many more.
Using them to enhance his powers.
No one could prove anything.
Of course, but we all knew.
The boy was a curse.
We've done our best to stop him.
But it's not enough.
His power grows daily.
His resurrection is evidence of that.
But what he does next will be more dangerous.
ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power.
He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of world.
We want you to find him and stop him before he does.
COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can.
As home secretary. I have considerable influence over the police.
HOLMES:
Hm, yes.
COWARD:
So...
...name your price.
The benefit of being a consulting detective...
...is that I can pick and choose my clients.
So consider it done. I'll stop him.
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.
- I do have a parting query. Sir Thomas.
- What is that?
If the rest of his family's dead.
How long do you expect to survive?
Food for thought.
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that.
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.
How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality...
How is it going with our case you refuse to take?
...of the wine.
Oh. I've hit a dead end, literally.
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
If you still need him.
Oh, dear.
Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
He's a professor, isn't he?
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.
I've never known a professor to carry a gun.
And on such a clever contraption.
Eye patch, nice touch.
So case closed...
...which makes this a social visit.
No, it's a "you're in over your head.
Irene" visit.
Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks...
...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
[CORK POPS]
Let it breathe.
I've never been in over my head.
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.
Or stay and volunteer for protective custody.
If I'm in danger, so are you.
Come with me.
What if we trusted each other?
Hm?
You're not listening.
I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.
[SIGHS]
So...
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.
You decide.
- Which will it be?
- What...?
I told you to let it breathe.
Can you taste the comet?
Why couldn't you just come away with me?
Never.
[CAWS]
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
Madam. I need you to remain calm and trust me. I'm a professional.
But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
CLARK: Naturally, sir.
That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling.
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.
Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended.
Or we may never have found you.
The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir.
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.
CLARK:
We've checked everything, sir.
No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
So body in the bathtub...
...his eyes were wide open.
And the only thing missing was...
...his ring, sir.
Why did you drain the water?
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer.
Not provide comfort for the corpse.
What is that?
[SNIFFS]
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...
...high up where it's warm and dry.
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.
Constable, you could do worse...
...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints.
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
[HUMMING]
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
It was in the pantry, sir.
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work.
Adieu.
[BELL TOLLING]
What's the meaning of this. Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?
Sir Thomas is dead.
I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.
[CHUCKLES]
Have you lost your mind?
You know damn well what he's capable of.
BLACKWOOD:
Of course he does.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're all here.
My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
A magnificent but simple purpose.
To create a new future.
A future ruled...
...by us.
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history.
Magic will lead the way.
Once the people of England see our newfound power...
...they'll bow down in fear.
Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours.
It will be again.
The Civil War has made them weak.
Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours...
...so we'll take it back.
We will remake the world...
...create the future.
These men are with me. Standish...
...but...
...are you?
No, sir. I am not.
These powers that you're playing with...
...no man can control.
Well, gentlemen...
...someone has to stop him.
Even if you won't.
Oh. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[YELLING]
STANDISH:
Save me!
Gentlemen...
...don't be afraid.
As you can see...
...we are protected.
Come, drink your allegiance here.
You control the police, now use them.
Didn't know you were here.
Since this room is no longer yours.
Do you mind if I utilize it?
Be my guest.
- In here, chaps.
MAN: Where would you like me...
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.
WATSON: Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.
His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
Yes.
Thanks for that, by the way.
There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man.
Elbows and arms stained with blood.
But it's older than his own injuries.
None of it human.
He's not a butcher, let me see.
Yellow flame, green bursts.
An industrial worker.
[SNIFFING]
Pff. Coal.
River silt.
The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in...
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry. What?
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.
I wondered.
Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests?
It's on the stepladder.
Well. Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit.
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.
It'll probably be a factory by the river.
What's that?
Never mind.
You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you?
No, not a clue.
Queenshi the Slaughterhouse.
Nine Elms.
A factory by the river.
Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive.
Not us.
You.
Yes.
Just a figure of speech, old boy.
He's left it there on purpose.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
[MEN LAUGHING]
More coal, doctor.
That's a good one. He's such a tit.
Oh. God. Yeah.
WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard.
And I thought we were trying to be discreet.
You would not last one day in the navy.
Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that?
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.
If only just a sense.
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.
Come on, come on.
WATSON: Look familiar?
HOLMES: Yep.
All that's missing is a ginger midget.
They cleared something away from here not minutes ago.
Like what?
Not sure. Something mechanical.
Holmes.
Look at this.
- Chapter and verse.
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."
BLACKWOOD:
"And behold. I'm alive for evermore."
I warned you. Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control...
...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend.
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness.
Tomorrow, at midday.
The world as you know it will end.
Show me your face.
It'll be the end of your world.
Save your bullets. Watson.
A gift for you.
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
What was that about saving bullets?
[GRUNTING]
BLACKWOOD:
She followed you here. Holmes.
You led your lamb to slaughter.
Holmes.
This game was designed to hurt.
Watson!
It's warm in here. Watson.
In over your head yet, darling?
WATSON: Hold on there.
ADLER: I can't.
Let me take your weight.
HOLMES:
Give us a leg up, old boy.
[GROANS]
These German locks always give me trouble.
[METAL CREAKING]
It's a band saw.
No matter, we have plenty of time.
Holmes.
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.
Holmes, hurry up.
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.
And we'll bounce in three, two...
...one.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.
Thank you.
We should help the doctor.
Holmes!
CLARK [IN SLOW MOTION]:
Mr. Holmes.
Sir.
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Sir!
Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir.
Now. Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Will the train be departing on time?
The train's been delayed, madam.
Shouldn't be long now, though.
MAN:
The train will depart when I tell it to.
And you will leave my employment when I allow you to.
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reordan.
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me. Finished.
MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you...
...not succumb to them.
You have fulfilled nothing.
I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood.
Finish the job or the next dead body...
...will be Sherlock Holmes.
DOCTOR:
The surgeon should be along shortly.
He should be able to rest now.
Excuse me.
Is that the best you can do?
Yes, for now.
I must attend to my other patients.
MARY:
Doctor.
Doctor.
Please.
I know that you care for him as much as I do.
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Solve this.
Whatever it takes.
[VOICES CHATTERING]
BLACKWOOD:
This is beyond your control.
CLARK:
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
ADLER: I've never been in over my head.
WATSON: it's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.
MARY: Solve this.
WATSON: Are you, Holmes?
BLACKWOOD:
Accept that this was beyond your control.
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy.
WATSON:
Holmes!
BLACKWOOD:
Widen your gaze.
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.
ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.
COWARD: His power grows daily.
ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power.
BLACKWOOD:
I need you.
ROTHERAM:
His secret lies in the book of spells.
BLACKWOOD:
Three more will die...
...and there is nothing you can do to save them.
STANDISH:
We know you don't believe in magic.
WATSON:
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
ADLER:
Is that better?
WATSON: He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.
His eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was his ring.
BLACKWOOD:
Give up, Holmes.
This is a riddle you cannot solve.
ADLER:
Good morning.
Now, you need to work.
Familiar artwork.
You look gorgeous.
HOLMES:
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.
You made the front page.
Only a name and no picture.
So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now...
...and that's my area of expertise.
I feel safer already.
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
Yes.
Took the shrapnel out myself.
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
Well. I'm...
I'm just so...
...very glad that you're...
...well...
...with us.
[BOTH CLEAR THROATS]
Now that you're sitting comfortably.
I shall begin.
My initial approach was far too narrow.
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison...
...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum. I have done just that.
In fact. I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity.
But that's for another time.
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system...
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
To fully understand the system.
To get inside it...
...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt...
...with a few enhancements of my own.
My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended...
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail.
I have emerged enlightened.
The fraternity who silently control the empire...
...share the belief with the kings.
Pharaohs and emperors of old...
...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension...
...a gateway to immeasurable power.
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...
...the wings of an eagle.
And the head of a man.
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...
...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man.
Map.
The points of the star represent the five murdered girls...
...but the cross is what we're now interested in.
It's a widely held belief...
...that within the architecture of the great cities...
...are coded references to this system.
Since he rose from the grave.
Blackwood has killed three men...
...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple...
...therefore the system.
Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man.
We found his body here.
Sir Thomas. Master of the temple.
Wore the ox ring.
He died here.
Standish, ambassador to America...
...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years.
The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died...
...is here.
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act.
So we have man. The ox. Eagle.
Only the lion remaining.
Right here.
Parliament.
Right.
You four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.
Ladies first.
LESTRADE:
Now.
HOLMES:
Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you...?
HOLMES: Go.
Hello, hello, hello.
Did the devil turn up?
Well...
...never mind.
You got the next best thing.
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...
...but Mr. Holmes here...
...he's been making some serious accusations about you...
...and the order.
I see.
Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[HOLMES COUGHS]
Excuse me, my Lord...
...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Well, inspector. I have five minutes before my next engagement...
...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy?
Thank you. Lestrade.
My Lord.
I'm curious. Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...
...or just the one I prevented?
Very distinctive.
Those handmade shoes of yours.
But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave.
Nonetheless. I confess to being completely outmatched.
I could deduce very little from my investigation.
Fortunately.
There's nothing more stimulating...
...than a case where everything goes against you.
How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?
Very clever.
But it's not murder. Mr. Holmes.
It's mercy.
We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
Don't you see that it's for their own...?
HOLMES:
No, but I don't care much what you think.
I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony...
...and you've given it to me.
I've told you nothing.
HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.
You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony...
...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago.
Both houses meet today.
The whole government will be present.
COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood. Holmes.
You would have made a valuable ally.
How terrible is wisdom...
...when it brings no profit to the wise.
We take power at noon.
There isn't any time to waste then.
Is there?
TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window.
There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
Technically, that isn't the top window.
Is it, sailor boy?
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.
Anyway.
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.
In fact. I think he enjoyed it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Here's the key.
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes. I smoked him out with relative ease.
- Tanner?
- Sir?
If you would, captain...
...take us under the bridge.
Port side. 100 yards.
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.
Right away, sir.
[HORN BLOWS]
[CHATTERING]
The end is nigh.
Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land.
He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke.
Behold, he cometh with clouds...
...and every eye shall see him...
...and every soul shall wail because of him.
You cannot stop him!
No one can!
[WHISPERING]
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.
ADLER [WHISPERING]: What does it do?
HOLMES: It's a chemical weapon.
The first of its kind.
You deduced that how?
From my pocket.
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse.
Note the blue discoloration.
The faint smell of bitter almonds.
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
ADLER: Cyanide.
WATSON:
Shh.
HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
It'll revolutionize warfare.
[WHISPERING] Yes, killing a lot of people.
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?
Right. How many men did you count on the...?
[GUNSHOTS]
She loves an entrance, your muse.
HOLMES [IN NORMAL TONE]:
Woman!
Shoot him. Now, please.
My lords.
My lords.
My lords.
The time has come...
...for only those who believe to remain.
Behold...
...Lord Blackwood.
[MURMURING]
You seem surprised.
I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny...
...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING
IN DISTANCE]
Listen to the rabble outside.
Listen...
...to the fear.
I will use that as a weapon...
...to control them...
...and then the world.
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.
Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
Electromagnetic waves?
HOLMES:
When triggered, the electrodes...
...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...
...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...
...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.
Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely.
Three minutes. 10 seconds.
I will create an empire that will endure for millennia...
...indestructible...
...and eternal.
Move it. Move it.
We don't actually have to disarm the device...
...we just have to remove the cylinders.
Yes, except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
[IN FRENCH]
I rather wish you hadn't done that.
Irene.
[BELL CHIMING]
On the 12th chime.
I will summon the dark powers.
All those of you who are with me shall be protected.
All others...
...will perish.
I need your pipe.
Nut him!
- Right.
- What?
- Coat.
- Got it.
The new order...
...begins now.
Woman.
What are you waiting for?
[POPS]
[GROANS]
That.
MAN:
Apprehend Lord Coward.
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.
Relax...
...I'm a doctor.
[SCREAMS]
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
We're safe now.
Interesting assessment.
Run off.
I won't be chasing you anymore.
Fare thee well.
I don't want to run anymore.
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.
No!
There was never any magic.
Only conjuring tricks.
The simplest involved paying people off...
...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.
Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest.
Others required more elaborate preparations...
...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
You had it broken before your burial.
Then put back together using an adhesive.
An ancient Egyptian recipe. I believe...
...a mixture of egg and honey...
...designed to be washed away by the rain.
Holmes!
Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub...
...required more modern science.
Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic...
...that was activated by the combination of copper and water...
...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
That might've been a challenge for me...
...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.
The death of Standish was a real mystery...
...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf.
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...
...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue.
Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple?
All it took was a spark.
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious.
Like all great performers, you saved your piece de resistance for the end:
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.
Had it worked...
...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed...
...as their colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know you'd given them the antidote.
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...
...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.
And the world would've followed.
Fear being the most powerful weapon of all.
[CREAKING]
You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition...
...as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.
For God's sake. Holmes, cut me loose.
[METAL CREAKING]
HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud.
Then you'll be hanged.
Properly, this time.
It's a long journey from here to the rope.
[YELLING]
[GRUNTS]
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
I have.
Naked.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
ADLER:
Storm's coming.
HOLMES:
Well, we've still got a moment.
Moriarty.
What?
That's his name.
And he is a professor.
Everyone has a weak spot...
...and he found mine.
Where was it, precisely?
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.
He's just as brilliant as you are...
...and infinitely more devious.
We'll see about that.
You'll miss me. Sherlock.
Sadly...
...yes.
WATSON:
Just keep it under your hat.
DRIVER: Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.
WATSON: Thank you.
- What's in these. John?
Scribbles.
- Scribbles?
- Notes.
MARY: They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.
[WATSON CHUCKLES]
Come on, what's wrong?
Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving?
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.
Now, five minutes here and we'll go home.
Our home.
Get up those stairs.
[KNOCKING]
Don't worry, dear.
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.
Holmes.
Oh. Good afternoon.
I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it were.
But it had a surprisingly soporific effect...
...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.
WATSON:
Get on with it. Holmes.
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.
John, shouldn't we help him down?
No, no, no.
I hate to cut him off midstream.
Carry on.
Well, the executioner attached it to a harness...
...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...
...and the neck to remain intact.
My Lord. I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?
How did you manage it. Holmes?
I managed it with braces.
Belts and a coat hook.
Please, my tongue is going.
I'll be of no use to you at all.
- Worse things could happen.
- John.
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.
HOLMES:
Right.
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...
...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own.
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?
HOLMES:
...Mad honey disease.
Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described.
He doesn't mind.
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
Doctor. Miss Mary.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away.
- What is it is this time. Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.
We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene.
Can I help you, officer?
Shot in the head.
Was it a small caliber bullet?
Yes.
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
Indeed, sir.
Point blank range?
Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty.
MARY:
Oh, there's a good boy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where is Blackwood's device now?
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
I'd wager there's a piece missing.
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine...
...not the poison.
There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.
And Adler was just the diversion.
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.
Imagine being able to control any device...
...simply by sending a command via radio waves.
It's the future. Watson.
[KNOCKING]
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
- Well...
- Well...
[GLADSTONE GROANS]
MARY: Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.
HOLMES:
Clarkie.
Case reopened.
Gotham City.
Clean shafts of concrete and snowy rooftops.
The work of men who died generations ago.
From here, it looks like an achievement.
From here, you can't see the enemy.
Hey. Hey, buddy, slow down.
- You're talking to me?
Yeah, you almost...
Twelve hours.
Train's no way to come to the city.
- Knock it off.
- Hey, watch it.
Thank God Barbara's flying in.
She should have gotten the tests back by now.
I only hate myself a little for hoping they came out negative.
This is no place to raise a family.
Maybe Gotham's all I deserve now.
Maybe it's just my time in hell.
Nice book for a small donation.
Nice book for a small donation.
No, please.
Nice book. Look at the picture... Aah!
They don't know when to quit, do they, lieutenant?
Name's Flass. Detective Flass.
Commissioner Loeb sent me to meet you.
He wanted to make sure you didn't miss your appointment.
Welcome to Gotham, lieutenant.
Don't worry. Not as bad as it looks.
Especially if you're a cop.
Cops got it made it Gotham.
Are we rolling?
Sir, a moment of your time.
Welcome home, Mr. Wayne.
How's it feel to be back?
What are your plans, Mr. Wayne?
Mr. Wayne, Princess Caroline, any truth to the rumors?
Mr. Wayne, please, can you look over here?
The 25-year-old heir to the Wayne millions...
...declined to comment on his return home after 12 years abroad.
We'll keep you posted on Gotham's richest and best looking native son.
- Tom?
- Thank you, Vicky.
Vicky Vale at Gotham Airport.
In other news, conspiracy charges against
Police Commissioner Loeb...
...were withdrawn today after the disappearance of a key witness.
Lieutenant James Gordon.
Impressive. Very impressive.
We're delighted to have you on the team, lieutenant.
You'll get my best work, sir. I promise.
I know I will.
And we are a team, Gordon. A team.
Any team needs to play together in order to win, don't you think?
Yes, it does.
Your record shows you've got what it takes.
I know I've made my mistakes, sir.
What mistakes did you make, lieutenant?
You kept the media away from it.
That's all that matters, isn't it? Yes, it is.
You won't have to worry about my honesty, commissioner.
Last thing on my mind.
Last thing.
Welcome home, Master Bruce.
- Thank you, Alfred.
It's good to be back.
I knew you'd like the commissioner.
He's a stand-up guy.
And he'll be just as good to you as you are to him. Count on it.
Yeah, I got that feeling.
- Flass.
Nothing I can't handle, lieutenant.
Hey, Stevie, mother know you're here?
Oh, crap.
He's got a Green Beret's training.
He knows how to use his size too.
Don't do a damn thing.
Be sure of your facts before you bring down another cop.
Just watch him.
Memorize every move.
For future reference.
Was that necessary?
Had this little beauty in his pocket.
It's a comb, Flass.
Hey, I'm only human, Jimmy.
Mind if I call you Jimmy?
Twelve years.
And the ache is still fresh.
Like a raw angry nerve.
But this isn't about healing.
I'm not looking for closure.
The boys, Jimmy.
They've been asking me to talk to you.
They're worried about you.
I mean, you with a baby on the way and all.
- Call me lieutenant.
- Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy.
You gotta learn to relax.
See, we got our own way of doing things here in Gotham.
This job can get to you, Jimmy.
That's why we gotta stick together.
The boys need to know they can count on you.
We can count on you, right?
Hey. Everything okay?
It is now.
I'm not ready.
I have the means, the skill...
But something's missing.
I have to wait.
I have to wait.
And Gordon, he looks at the 50 like it's diseased.
Then throws it in the padre's face.
Gives the entire squad a two-hour lecture on ethics.
Put Schell on probation.
I'm telling you, Gill, he's just not fitting in.
I had such high hopes for that boy.
I requested off this damn night shift four times now.
Barbara needs me.
Barbara and little James.
So I hope it's a boy, so what?
Going to work, lieutenant?
You're gonna be a little late.
May have to skip the whole night.
I was taught to handle worse than this.
But then...
It's been a while.
Consider this a warning. Be smart.
Think of that pregnant wife of yours,
Jimmy.
This is reconnaissance mission.
Until I'm ready, my anonymity is an obvious priority.
All it requires is a change of clothing and complexion.
And a single memorable distracting detail.
It's a 20-block walk to the enemy camp.
The East End.
Hard to believe it's gotten worse.
Cheer you up, mister?
- How old are you?
- Young as you want me to be.
Stupid little bitch.
You're doing it all wrong.
- But I did what you said.
- Get on out of here.
- We'll talk this over later.
No.
I think you're finished with her.
Man, that crazy vet thing is old.
You stink like vice.
I'm not the police. Believe me.
Selina, don't stop now.
He can't be vice. We're paid up.
Selina, what are you doing?
Watching some idiot trying to get himself killed.
Man, you're pushing.
You're looking for a new scar.
Just tell me where you want it.
Come on. Get him.
Freeze.
Jeez, Eddie, why did you shoot?
He didn't move.
He was going to.
- Any cash?
Couple of bucks.
No ID.
Oh, he's bleeding all over the backseat.
What if he dies?
So, what if he does?
One less mouth to feed at the soup kitchen.
You two.
Stop the car. Get out.
What the hell?
Don't mind him.
Probably hopped up on something.
Scum maybe.
But even scum have families.
Detective Flass is off duty, lieutenant.
He and the guys have a poker party every Wednesday night over at Chutes.
No. I said posse.
See you guys tomorrow.
Hello, Jimmy.
It's been years since I had to take out a Green Beret.
Even so, he deserves a handicap.
He'll never report it.
Not Flass.
He'll make up some story that involves at least 10 attackers.
But he'll know.
And he'll stay away from Barbara.
I've tried to be patient.
I've tried to wait.
But I have to know.
How, Father?
How do I do it?
What do I use to make them afraid?
If I ring the bell, Alfred will come.
Another of your gifts to me, Father.
But I'd rather die than wait another hour.
I've already waited 18 years.
Eighteen years since all sense left my life.
Yes, Father.
He's held four children at gun point.
Reportedly he has a history of mental illness.
SWAT team lead by Brendon has just arrived...
Crap. Brendon?
Lt'll be a massacre.
Last month, he and his lunatic gestapo calmed down a riot in Robinson Park.
He didn't even leave the statues standing.
No. Don't want.
Isn't blank.
Damn it, Merkel. I'm not here to argue,
I'm here to clean up.
Lieutenant Gordon is on his way, sir.
I really think...
To hell with that spineless bastard.
Now stand aside.
Go find your own war, Brendon.
I'll take it from here.
Intense hostage situation in midtown, at the corner of Richmond and Todd...
...we're getting reports that the gunman has history of mental illness...
...and was apparently released from Arkham Asylum.
Take it easy, friend.
No. Defibrillate.
No lunch. No lunch.
It's okay, pal. We'll order out.
No lunch. No gangrene lunch.
Who wants gum?
You really handled that well, Brendon.
What was I suppose to do?
Disobey a direct order?
- Something's gotta be done.
- I'd like nothing better.
But we must be patient.
Gordon has the press on his side.
He's a hero.
I hate the job.
I hate the gun.
But I keep practicing.
How did I let this happen?
To bring an innocent child to life.
In a city without hope.
I could use a jackhammer on your back.
Oh. You're doing fine, honey.
Ignore it.
Hello?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon...
It's Merkel at the station.
Something about a giant bat.
The chicken'll keep.
Amateur.
Lucky amateur.
Some of you know Detective Essen.
She has returned to Gotham from Lakeside to help with our investigation.
Okay, okay. Listen up.
Our vigilante, or Batman, as the news shows are calling him...
...has committed 70 assaults in the past five weeks.
Now during this time, certain patterns have emerged.
Thank you, detective.
He operates between the hours of midnight and 4 a. m.
Concentrating his efforts in the East End.
This Batman is working his way up the crime ladder.
From junkie to pusher to supplier.
No one appears safe. Not even cops.
- Right, Detective Flass?
- He's not human.
Gentlemen.
Why don't you tell us what happened.
And try not to exaggerate.
It's like I said in my report.
I received an anonymous tip leading me to an East End cocaine delivery.
I was on the process of single-handedly apprehending the felons.
It came out of the night sky.
Wings 30 feet across.
One of the felons I have not yet disarmed, produced a gun, fired point blank...
...bullet passed right through the creature like it wasn't there.
Something flew from its hand.
Little dart things.
Paralyzed everyone. Except me.
It singled me out. It had claws.
I'm telling you it isn't human.
Gentlemen, please.
Have you seen Batman, commissioner?
They say he's huge.
You shouldn't pry, Marian.
Gill has his hands full these days.
We're trusting him to cope with Batman and Gordon.
Whoever this bat person is, he's a having a positive effect on public spirit.
Street crime has dropped significantly.
Hell, Gill, maybe you ought to offer him a job.
Hey, hey, let's not kid ourselves.
Batman is costing us all money.
Two sides to everything, friends.
Look at the long term.
A few street operators are put out of action, yes...
...but the people of Gotham have a hero.
Makes them feel safe.
And the safer they feel, the fewer questions they ask, right, Gill?
I don't like it. It's stirring things up.
And with Gordon pushing Internal Affairs to go after Flass...
...Flass would be difficult to replace.
- And if he were to talk...
- Let me worry about Flass.
Relax, Carmine.
I got everything under control.
- What is going on?
- The lights? What happened to the lights?
Ladies, gentlemen...
...you've eaten well.
You've eaten Gotham's wealth.
Its spirit.
But your feast is nearly over.
From this moment on, none of you are safe.
No excuses.
That vigilante bastard goes under, instantly.
Or it's your job.
She knows how to walk in heels.
So few women do these days.
And she knows how to scream.
You could hear it from the rooftops.
Gordon is wasting a lot of manpower on these traps.
We'll try again tomorrow night.
Mr. Falcone, your Rolls, it's gone.
He took it. Said it's in the river.
Thinks he's a damn Robin Hood.
He dies.
He knows when and where we sets our traps for him...
...and night after nights, he terrorizes the most powerful men in Gotham.
- Heard what he did to the Roman's car?
- Laughed myself silly.
A Rolls-Royce.
You've been after the Roman for years.
Some of your witnesses changed their testimony. Others vanished.
- Must be frustrating.
- Oh, yes.
- Do you mind?
- Go for it.
I understand he used his muscle to keep you from making DA.
- You keep in shape, don't you, Mr. Dent?
- What are you driving at, lieutenant?
I need to know where you were on the following dates.
Thank you, sir.
I thought he'd never leave.
You can come out now.
He had an alibi for every date, Essen.
Says he was home between midnight and 4 with his wife.
No point in questioning her.
- You really think he's Batman, lieutenant?
- It's possible.
Dent certainly is passionate enough.
But it takes more than muscles to fight the way Batman does.
And to get around the way he does.
And those weapons?
I mean, he's got an arsenal.
Hard to afford on a blue-collar salary.
- Money, lieutenant.
- Hmm?
Bruce Wayne is the richest man in Gotham.
Being from out of town, you might not know...
...but Wayne's parents were murdered, by a mugger, I think.
He was just a little boy at the time.
Essen, I could kiss you.
Jim.
Hold on.
Take the wheel.
Don't move.
Lieutenant, you all right?
I called for back-up.
Essen.
Stop. Or I'll...
It's Batman. He went down that alley.
Get the front of that place covered.
Merkel, take a squad to the roof
No one fires without my order.
Batman hasn't attacked anybody.
There's no need for Brendon.
I've got the situation in hand.
Oh, no.
Everybody, back.
- Move it back.
- Move, move, move.
Clear the area.
Selina.
Selina, come see.
Five in the morning? Come on, Holly.
I'm serious, Selina.
Things are blowing up.
Brendon's probably cornered some jaywalker.
Turn on the TV.
Gotta be something on about it.
- Lock and load.
Brendon.
Keep your men under control.
No one fires unless I say.
Not this time, Gordon.
The commissioner wants a corpse.
He's gonna get one.
All units entering the target area.
No prisoners, men.
Batman has been surrounded by Gotham police...
...inside an abandoned tenement off Robinson Park.
Selina, it's Batman.
- Can we?
- What the hell?
Grab your coat.
Unit 1 reporting, second floor's a mess.
Nothing living.
Unit 2 reporting, body under the water-heater just an old wino.
If he made it down there, he might have survived.
Check it out.
Super must have lived here.
What the hell is going on?
Open that goddamn door.
I like you right where you are, Brendon.
Too many people have already died.
Order your squads to withdraw.
I can't guarantee their safety.
Units 1 and 2, converge on the lobby.
He's here.
Shoot on sight.
I need a mask.
Goddamn. Unit 1, do you read me?
Seems like Brendon is in trouble.
I wish I could help, but orders are orders.
It breaks my heart.
Sir, he's taken out Unit 3.
The entire unit, commissioner.
You better shoot straight, son.
I've made a mess of things.
Let it get out of hand.
Step it up. Step it up.
Careful, these stairs are about to give way.
Hold your fire.
It's a bat we're after.
With my belt gone,
I'm down to a blow gun.
Three darts and an unofficial invention of Wayne Electronics.
Haven't tested it for this great a distance.
It took me weeks to find the right ultrasonic tone.
A tone that acts as an attractant.
Whoever Batman is, he's stronger than I...
Shut up. He could be anywhere.
Cease fire, you idiots.
I'm gonna cut that bastard in half.
Yeah.
They've made a hero out of him.
There, the motorcycle. After him.
Shoot him, you idiot. Kill him.
Kill him.
I can't see a thing.
Every member of Brendon's team...
...every cop and everybody in the crowd were vaccinated for their bat bites.
Never have so many had so much trouble sitting down.
Four of Brendon's men were hospitalized with broken bones.
Brendon himself suffered five broken ribs and internal bleeding.
The dead winos had no relatives to complain about their fire bombing.
Everyone who could have ordered
Brendon and Loeb up on charges...
...remains unavailable to me by appointment or telephone.
I spoke to his butler.
Wayne has been skiing in Switzerland for the past six weeks.
Apparently, he took a nasty spill, broke both legs and an arm.
Cast on his arm and legs would cover bullet wounds.
Exactly where Batman received them.
You're relentless, Essen.
Only when I want something.
Well, quitting time.
- We'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Share a cab?
Uh...
Sure.
Selina, you punched Stan.
We're changing our line of work, Holly.
Why a cop?
I was told I was too masculine for about six other careers.
Whoever said you were masculine must have been blind, deaf and dead.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?
I know why I'm here.
But what are you doing here?
In Gotham, I mean.
It's a long, sordid story.
The bullet points are police corruption.
A cop who wanted to believe the system works...
...and one incredibly bad decision.
There's a reason everyone hates Internal Affairs.
They dangle the carrot of integrity and honesty.
But at the end of the day, when you take down another cop...
...they treat you like any other low-life scumbag.
I'm sorry.
You spent the last of our money on that?
It's not even Halloween.
Sometimes, Holly, you have to spend money to make money.
Selina.
What the hell am I doing?
I need to stop this thing with Sarah.
Oh, God.
Calling her Sarah now.
I need to come clean with Barbara.
Beg for forgiveness.
But I can't stop thinking about her...
...like I can't stop thinking about this Batman.
He's a criminal, I'm a cop.
It's as simple as that.
But I'm a cop in a city that uses its cops like hired killers.
He saved that old woman.
He saved those two cops.
What the hell am I doing?
I just wanna know...
...if your wife weren't pregnant, would you...?
I'm sorry, that wasn't a fair question.
Damn it, Jim.
I'll request a transfer.
Give me Flass, I'll see that you walk.
Try this one, how about
I don't give you Flass and walk anyway?
You got nothing on me.
Save your little Q and A session for the inquest, Gordon.
My client just posted bail.
If you say one word about Flass and your life won't be worth a nickel.
Are you listening to me?
Yeah, sure.
I want you in a blue suit with a tie.
None of that pimp stuff.
And when you smile at the jury, make it nice. Particularly the women.
You mean like this?
Just remember, they'll have their clothes on.
You can never escape me.
Nothing harms me.
But I know pain.
I know pain.
Sometime I share it with someone like you.
You got Flass.
Get the DA and forget to tell the commissioner.
On it.
Sources inside the police department reveal that Detective Arnold Flass...
...has been implicated in Jefferson
Skeevers' massive drug operation.
I just need to ask you...
If I can just stop you for just one moment.
Detective. Detective,
Vicki Vale here with the local ne...
Detective?
You might have informed me before handling Flass' head to IA.
It was a slip-up, sir.
Everyone's working such long hours.
Right, Brendon?
You get good press, I'll give you that.
A.G. And his pack at the Gazette, they like you.
But they don't know you.
Not like we do.
Be a shame if your wife were to learn about your special working relationship...
...with Detective Essen.
Walls have ears, Jimmy.
Everything looks good, Barbara.
I'll see you in a week.
That is unless your son decides differently.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Batman.
Lieutenant Gordon?
Gordon here.
Bruce Wayne's representative is on the other line.
Mr. Wayne's available for an interview right now.
- What should I tell him, sir?
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- Sorry, honey.
- That's okay.
I've always wanted to meet Bruce Wayne.
They say he's quite charming.
Police Lieutenant Gordon and Mrs. Gordon, sir.
Mrs. Gordon, I'm charmed.
Alfred, be a joy and get some glasses for our guests.
And another bottle.
This one's evaporated.
Little early in the day for us, thanks.
Please, sit.
Mr. Wayne, I don't wanna waste any more of your time than necessary.
I've been following your exploits, lieutenant.
I must say I'm impressed.
You're getting about as much press as this Batman fellow.
It is Batman you wanted to talk about, isn't it?
Something about me being him?
Pardon me. Where are my manners?
I neglected to introduce my friend.
Unfortunately,
I'm not sure what her name is.
She doesn't speak any language that I know.
- Except one.
- How convenient.
Barbara.
Mr. Wayne, I need to know where you were on the following dates.
- He's a pig.
- He's acting like one.
Anyone who'd wear a cape and hunt criminals...
...might go far to keep his secrets.
Or he really is a sleazy, womanizing scumbag.
Jim, what is it?
Honey, there's something I need to tell you.
He's been sitting there for 10 minutes.
Ah. Now he's moving. Good.
Grape juice and small talk.
That is not my idea of a party,
Mr. Wayne.
What are you complaining about?
Easiest 5 grand you ever made.
Can I go now? You guys are weird.
Skeevers told us where, when and how much money you received, Flass.
You're facing 10 years in prison, my friend.
That is if Skeevers is alive enough to testify.
Uh, my client didn't mean that.
Hello?
You know your husband's been fooling around?
Yes, I know about Detective Essen.
Don't bother calling here again.
Rat poison. He's lucky.
We pumped his stomach in time.
Skeevers is still going to testify.
Just keeping you informed, sir.
In his continuing investigation into police corruption...
...District Attorney Harvey Dent...
...has promised a press conference early next week to discuss the Flass case.
Lieutenant Gordon?
It's a boy. Your wife is fine.
The city has experienced the fourth in a daring series of cat burglaries.
This time, the victim was none other than Police Commissioner Loeb.
The commissioner had a collection of pop memorabilia.
Ugh! I thought he'd have jewels or paintings, not these stupid toys.
How can I sell this crap?
I don't know. They're kind of cool.
- Charge Batman with the crime they admit to no evidence.
Batman?
They're giving the credit to Batman?
But, Selina, you don't want them to know it's you, do you?
I hear Falcone's got a fortune in old stuff.
Maybe I'll give the Roman a little scratch before I steal it.
On the face.
They won't think it's Batman if I give him a scratch.
Hello, Johnny, my sister's boy.
You're a man now, Johnny.
A strong man.
Mother says there are several men plaguing you, sir.
I need only be told their names.
Your mother is wise in her way.
You see, Johnny...
...there are too many people in this world who ask questions.
And far, far too many who give answers.
Mother said...
Listen to me.
- We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
- Yes, sir.
- Here's what I need done.
Over there.
You work for Batman.
I'll take care of this one.
Here, kitty, kitty. Ugh!
Thanks for wasting my time.
You made the paper again, sir.
We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
Yes, sir.
Here's what I need done.
Over there.
If only that cat woman hadn't been there.
Marked increase in paranoia. Hmm.
The Roman says he doesn't want bad publicity.
It follows he won't murder anyone.
What then? Blackmail?
Extortion?
Tendency toward aberrant, even violent behavior.
Kidnapping.
Shall I fetch your tights, sir?
Never during the day, Alfred.
Last night's attack connects
Batman to the recent string of burglaries.
A woman in a cat costume, presumably Batman's assistant...
- Assistant?
... left before police arrived.
- Now I'm his assistant?
In other news...
You're going to need your rest.
All bets are off.
You understand?
Tell me what to do.
Gordon, Johnny.
Not gonna be easy.
He'll be hard to get to.
Then make him come to you.
Once a man becomes a father, he is never truly free.
Feeding time.
My turn.
Easy now. Almost warm.
- Gordon here.
Get down here.
Sir, Merkel's on duty, can't you...?
Yes, sir. On my way.
Gordon is leaving his apartment.
Tell Falcone.
Whoa!
Maniac.
Drop the gun, lieutenant.
Go to your office, wait for our call.
- Jim.
- You heard him, lieutenant.
Drop the gun.
If I let them go, my wife and son are dead.
The son of a bitch is crazy.
Barbara, get out of here. Call Merkel.
Don't move. I'll shoot, I will.
Mrs. Gordon, I won't let your son die.
Trust me.
No!
You must be wearing armor under that jacket.
Something like that.
You know, I'm practically blind without my glasses.
You better go.
And, thank you.
It turns out Flass is smarter than he looks.
Took notes on every little talk he ever had with Loeb
Dates, times, it was all there.
Loeb is holding up pretty well...
...for someone under federal indictment for racketeering.
He even offered up a sacrificial lamb.
Barbara's not crazy about the marriage counselor, but we're making progress.
As for me, well, there's a real panic on.
Somebody has threatened to poison the Gotham reservoir.
He calls himself the Joker.
I've got a friend coming who might be able to help.
He should be here any minute.
ALEXANDER:
In the 19th century...
...Jules Verne wrote some of the greatest adventure stories ever told
Novels such as Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea...
...Journey to the Center of the Earth...
...and The Mysterious Island.
Most consider these works of science fiction.
Vernians know otherwise.
SEAN:
Not good!
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha. Aah!
Whoa! Good boy!
Seriously?
Okay.
Here we...
...go!
Evening, officers.
Anyone up for a late night swim?
Hey, buddy.
Missed you at poker this week.
Thanks for the call.
What's going on?
We didn't want this going out over the radio.
Kid broke into a satellite facility.
Then he drove...
...his dirt bike into...
...the McGillicuttys' pool.
I talked them out of pressing charges.
Anderson!
Your stepfather's here for you.
No. Legal guardian.
HANK: If it weren't for me, you'd be in juvie for the next six months.
Rather do the time.
Do you want to explain to me...
...why you were breaking into a satellite facility in the middle of nowhere?
Don't worry about it, Mom.
It's nothing, really.
The police calling in the middle of the night is nothing?
Sean?
What was he doing there?
What was he looking for?
HANK: Honey, I don't know.
All we can do is ask him.
Hey. Sean, we gotta talk about this.
I'm confused.
Who gave him a speaking part?
- Hey.
- Without my speaking part, we'd visit you...
- ...in jail right now.
- I'm already in jail.
LIZ: What is that supposed to mean?
Sean?
I didn't ask to be taken away from my school and friends, and dragged all the way to Dayton.
- It's okay, Liz.
- No, it's not.
Sean!
- Sean!
HANK: It's gotta be tough on him...
...with his father gone. LIZ: That still doesn't excuse his behavior.
SEAN:
Okay.
Now that I got you, I just gotta figure out what you mean.
(CROCODILES' "SLEEP FOREVER"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
SEAN:
Not here.
Hey, it's me. You busy?
SEAN:
Yes.
I was looking to talk to you.
You know, very concerned adult to somewhat troubled youth.
Which one am I in that equation?
Cracked up the walkway to my door
Brought you as a...
Hey, buddy.
What's all this?
Nothing.
That's a cryptogram, right?
Looks like Morse code.
SEAN:
Mm-hm.
Yeah, look.
One syllable words, dots.
Two syllable words, dashes.
I learned that in the Navy.
Okay, then. What's it say?
What's it for?
It's complicated.
So is the code.
Okay. Here's the deal.
A few nights ago, a radio signal got sent out.
Could've been anywhere.
It was these words on a loop.
HANK:
"Pip, Zorn, Strux."
All characters from the books of Verne.
The message was by a Vernian.
And my equipment wasn't powerful enough to receive the whole message, so...
So you broke into that satellite facility to boost your signal.
Someone sent this message and I'm gonna be the person to solve it.
This is really important to me.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we solve this together?
Fine.
Okay.
The first part of the message reads,
"The...
...I-S-L."
Island.
"Is..."
R-E. "Real. The island is real."
You're serious?
You're not messing with me?
No. That's what it says.
"The island is real."
I can't believe it. I can't believe somebody actually found the island.
What island?
The Mysterious Island. Vernians have been looking for this for years.
What's the rest say?
"Child of Steve, born...
...eighteen...
...eight-three."
"Born 1883."
Child of Steve. Child of Steve.
Maybe "son of Steve"?
Steven's son. Stevenson.
- Robert Louis Stevenson.
- The author.
He was born way before 1883.
Gotta be somebody else.
Maybe it's not a somebody.
Maybe it's a something.
What are we looking for?
Come on.
Aha!
Treasure Island, written by
Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883.
- What's the next part of the riddle?
- All right.
"The name that's last is going fast.
- He hitched his tale to Lemuel's mast."
- Okay, so his...
- ...last name is going fast. A runner?
- What if his last name...
...is fast?
Fleet or Quick. Swift.
Swift. Jonathan Swift.
Another author.
Writing about another island.
HANK:
So "Lemuel" must be...
Nice. Lemuel Gulliver.
- We have three different books.
- By three different authors.
HANK:
About three different islands.
Maybe...
Maybe all three books are about the same island.
Maybe that's why nobody else has ever found it...
...because they haven't used the other two books.
Treasure Island's got a map.
SEAN:
Yeah, Swift has one too.
These are different than Verne's.
I don't get it.
What are you doing?
You know what I did in the Navy, Sean?
No.
I won the esteemed...
...Rochefort Award...
...three years in a row...
...for code-breaking.
Incredible.
HANK:
We found your Mysterious Island.
Uh, what are those?
HANK:
Coordinates.
Longitude and latitude.
And that'll put us right about...
...here.
That's 100 miles off the coast of Palau, in the middle of the South Pacific.
What are you doing?
- I gotta go.
- Go where?
To Mysterious Island.
All right, cool. Hey, can you stop by the moon and grab me a Slurpee?
Joke all you want.
Yeah, I will, and you're gonna be here to listen to it.
You're not going to Palau, Sean.
Why not?
Number one, you're grounded.
On top of that, you got school.
I'm a straight-A student. I can afford to miss a couple days. This is Mysterious Island.
Slow down. Okay?
You think you'll travel...
...around the world...
...meet up with some lunatic...
- ...messing around on a ham radio?
- It's not some lunatic.
It's Alexander Anderson, my grandfather.
How would you know he sent that?
Makes sense.
He's the original Vernian in the family...
...he's been looking for the island half his life and nobody's heard from him in two years.
- I think he's in trouble. I'm gonna find him.
- Sean, stop. Sean.
Stop!
I'm not letting you go on a rescue mission by yourself. Whether you like it or not...
...you're still a kid.
Look, I understand your situation, okay?
You wanna make my mom happy and I appreciate that. I really do.
But you need to just focus on running your construction company...
...and paying the mortgage and asking her how her day was...
...because I'm okay.
And like it or not, this is bigger than you.
Apparently the message was sent by his grandfather.
Sean said he's been missing for a couple years.
It's hard to be missing if you were never around.
I wouldn't trust one word from Alexander Anderson.
Sean seems really convinced.
Oh, it's always convincing from Alexander.
I see. So in Sean's mind,
Alexander's this glamorous adventurer.
LIZ:
When in reality...
...he was a man that wasn't there when his family needed him the most.
That's why we need to let Sean...
- ...go on this trip.
- Why?
Sean needs a man in his life.
Somebody who'll be there for him and connect with him.
We were cracking that code, that was the first time...
...that we were on the same page.
Then bond with him on some non-mysterious island, like Hawaii.
Ah, Hawaii. Our honeymoon.
(SINGING) Aloha oe
Yes, but I'm serious, babe.
I'm serious too.
We'll fly down to Palau.
When Sean realizes the island's not real, his grandfather's not there...
...I'll be there to cushion the blow, and done will be done.
Good morning, buddy. 0700 hours.
I'm busy.
I don't think you're gonna be too busy for this.
I'm going to Palau?
Ha, ha. Close.
We're going to Palau.
What?
I know you've won the esteemed Rochefort Award...
...but I've been on these adventures before so let me handle this.
Easy, buddy. Just remember who's financing this whole trip.
Queen Isabella didn't tag along with Columbus.
Okay, Isabella. I'll let you handle your thing. We'll see how...
Wait, watch the lizard. Watch.
Big man's afraid of a little lizard?
Big man's not afraid. I love lizards when they're boots and belts.
SEAN:
Excuse us.
Hi.
Hey, how's it going? We, uh...
We Americans.
Uh, you...
...tour guide?
- Sean.
- I got this.
You... You take us on boat.
On water.
You wanna charter a boat?
The official language of Palau?
English.
Thank you.
Uh, yeah, we need someone to take us to an island located here.
Absolutely not.
Wait, why?
TOUR GUIDE: Because there is no island, just a bunch of storms.
It's a graveyard for ships.
We'll pay you good money, $1000!
Only a fool trades his life for money.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Today is your lucky day.
Hey, I'm Gabato Laguatan, best captain in Palau.
I understand you in need of transportation.
That's great.
We need someone to get us here.
A thousand bucks if you can.
Ooh, baby! Easy-peasy, easy-peasy.
Let's go.
Here we go.
Let's go. Man, this is gonna be...
...good. You won't be disappointed.
I've taken hundreds of people out to sea.
I come back with them almost every time.
- Nice ride.
- Nice ride.
GABATO:
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
HANK:
What in the blue heck is that?
That's the finest helicopter in Palau.
Hate to see the worst.
Oh!
That's my security system.
Heh, heh.
- I'd rather take the Titanic.
GABATO: Kailani!
We have customers here.
You simply must meet my daughter.
She's a real beauty.
Looks just like me.
This chopper's not gonna work out.
Actually, Hank, you know what?
Now that I get a better look at it, this chopper's...
...pretty freaking gorgeous.
This daughter looks like you?
Look. Same nostrils.
- Who are these guys?
- Uh...
I am a scientific explorer. Hi.
And he's a...
- Hank.
- Hank.
Right. So we need to get to these coordinates.
Not on this helicopter.
That's the deadliest part of the ocean.
Time-out. Sweetness, sweetness.
Sweetness, look.
They agreed to pay us
1000 American dollars, okay?
I could help with college for you then.
Make it 2000.
No way. We had a deal.
Then make it 3000. And good luck finding someone else to take you there.
Please?
Do you take Visa?
GABATO: Good afternoon, folks, and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours.
Please sit back, relax and get ready for the ride of a lifetime.
And now a word from our pilot.
This is your pilot, and...
HANK:
Here we go.
GABATO:
Gotcha!
If you look out your window on your left...
...you will see what is known...
...as the Pacific Ocean.
On your right side, you will see...
- ...the other side of the Pacific Ocean.
- You gonna do that the whole trip?
Sir, you did pay for the luxury tour.
- It's a beautiful sky, huh?
KAILANI: Mm-hm.
I mean, today just seems especially...
...majestic.
"Majestic"?
Really?
- I have to finish this in-flight safety check.
- Yeah.
We have to go around the storm.
Uh, according to these coordinates, that's where the island is.
There is no island there.
We're about to find out.
Whoa.
We gotta get out of here now!
I was thinking the same thing!
No, no, no. Wait!
The Mysterious Island, chapter one!
"The passengers...
...had been taken into...
...the movement of a column of air."
We're about to fly into a Category 5 hurricane!
Now's not the time to take the book literally!
We have to go into the eye of the hurricane to get to the island!
Are you psychotic? We'll never survive!
We gotta trust Verne!
You know what I trust? Gravity.
Gabato, get us out of here now!
You're right, I agree with you.
But here's the deal:
I'm not flying this helicopter any more!
The throttle's...
...broken!
What?
We're going down!
Hold on!
Here we go!
No! Not like this!
Hang on! Hang on!
HANK:
Sean!
Sean!
Sean!
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
It's okay. It's okay.
Try and sit up.
Attaboy.
I told you it'd work.
HANK:
You were right.
I can't believe we made it.
It's Jules Verne, man.
You gotta believe.
Where are we?
Where's my father?
GABATO:
Somebody help me!
Help me!
My body's been cut in half!
Your foot's right there.
My severed foot.
And it's moving!
It's moving.
Oh, and I'm still in one piece. Yay.
Well, you were right.
There is an island.
Not much of one.
- This is not what I was expecting.
HANK: All right, guys, listen up.
We have to gather up everything that washed ashore and take stock of our supplies.
We need to find shelter. Let's go.
There you are, baby. I thought I lost you.
Oh...
Qh, yeah My girl.
Hey, I think I found a way off the beach!
What was that?
It's a scary noise in a dark cave.
Keep moving. Keep moving. Go, go.
GABATO:
If this is heaven, I'm checking in.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
The Mysterious Island.
KAILANI:
What is this place?
Whoa!
This island, it shrunk us!
Or turned us into giants?
Sean, what does Verne say about this?
It's one of the first laws of island biogeography.
Small animals become large and large animals become small.
Lilliputian. Swift alluded to it in Gulliver's Travels.
I'd like to keep him as a pet.
I could knit him a little trunk-warmer.
HANK:
See you, buddy.
Hey, check it out.
You guys see that smoke?
- That's gotta be my grandpa's campsite.
KAILANI: How do you know?
What else could it be?
The natives sparking up a barbecue, getting ready to cook us for dinner.
Only one way to find out.
Whoa, time-out!
I hope your grandfather's okay, but my father and I aren't going.
- We're headed back to the beach.
- To do what?
Spell SOS with seashells and maybe kelp.
Kelp? There's a boat-eating, plane-eating hurricane out there 24/7.
Nobody's gonna see your kelp.
HANK:
Sean's absolutely right.
We stick together, find his grandfather, use his radio to call for help.
Fine.
Just know that if we get torn to bits,
I'm blaming you.
I'm blaming you too.
Real smooth.
What did I do?
Seriously, what did I say?
What did I do?
SPF 100?
You squeeze it and a sweater comes out?
Yeah, that's funny, Navy man.
Don't come crying to me when you're as red as a tomato.
Do I look like I burn?
GABATO:
Oh, man...
...that's one gooey rock.
No one move.
These aren't rocks.
They're eggs.
Get out. Why don't we crack a couple open and make some omelets?
Not a good idea.
Come on, man,
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Shh! Where there are giant eggs, there must be a giant mother.
It had to be a lizard.
Why couldn't it be snakes?
SEAN:
Okay.
Okay, we just need to move quickly but carefully.
Lizards have incredible hearing and an acute sense of smell.
Uh-oh.
Let's move. Just move.
We are literally walking on eggshells.
Ooh!
Guys?
Don't take another step.
Papa, be careful.
Don't worry, honey.
I got this.
See? No problem. Oh!
Oh, man!
Run, run, run!
Head for the jungle!
Faster! Faster!
Let's go! Go! Go!
Move!
Come on!
This Way!
Let's go!
GABATO:
Go, go, go! Move!
HANK:
It's right behind you! Hurry!
KAILANI:
Come on!
Sean!
SEAN:
Hey, Godzilla!
Oh, crap.
Oh, man!
GABATO:
Oh, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!
- Come on, keep moving!
- Hurry!
HANK:
Back! Back! Back!
Sean, get behind me.
Sean, backpack!
Back! Back!
- Hank! Hank!
HANK: Back!
Not now, Sean. She's scared!
No, she's cold-blooded and attracted to heat!
That's emasculating.
Now what?
Now there's only one thing left.
The thunder cookie.
I think I just made it worse.
GABATO: Whoa!
KAILANI: Aah!
Hope she doesn't like
Polynesian food.
I hope she don't like food with poop in its pants!
Go, go, go!
Everybody okay?
Yeah.
Well, don't just stand there. Applaud!
Grandpa!
That was amazing.
A pitch-perfect frill-necked lizard mating call.
They fall for it all the time.
Gabato and Kailani.
- Their helicopter brought us here.
- Pleasure. Pleasure.
And I'm Sean's stepfather,
Hank Parsons.
I helped Sean crack your code.
ALEXANDER:
You're the stepfather?
Well, maybe that's why it took so long, eh?
After all, how hard can it be to crack a code...
...by converting a string of Vernian characters into a list of dots and dashes.
Or you could have just sent a message not in code.
There it is, definitive proof that you are not an Anderson.
SEAN:
Mm-hm.
Ooh. Ooh!
I think it's best we get out of here.
After that mating call, she may have ideas about making you her husband.
Oh, witty. Good for you, Henry.
The name's Hank. It's never Henry.
Just Hank.
Ah. I see you're a man of incisive decision.
Why don't you lead the way?
Oh, actually...
...we want to live through the night. Yes.
So maybe you should all...
...follow me. Come on.
Hank?
I'm following you.
All right, come on. Go ahead.
That's awesome.
Here we are, folks.
Come on up.
This is my place.
Wow.
ALEXANDER:
Welcome.
We've got a working elevator, indoor plumbing.
And I've even got...
...a 75-inch...
...HDTV.
How'd you build all this stuff?
I made it out of the sailboat that brought me here. Old Blue-Eyed Lucy.
She gave her life in that hurricane so that I could discover...
...the ever-glorious...
...Mysterious Island.
Smoothie?
Oh, thank you.
This the radio you used to send the signal?
Yes. I made it myself...
...out of an alarm clock...
...some copper I mined in the hills over there and a teaspoon.
You know how long it took me to make it?
Oh, I don't know.
Probably a little less than...
...who cares?
Three months. You know how long...
...it would've taken you?
Ooh...
Forever. Ha-ha-ha!
KAILANI:
Let's just contact...
...Palau, get off this island.
It's not that easy, darling.
You have to wait for the satellite...
...to come around to the proper position.
How long's that gonna take?
Oh, about two weeks.
Wait, do you mean we're stuck here for two weeks?
"Stuck here"? I think it'll be fun.
We can get to know each other better.
Surviving here won't be fun.
How will your mom feel if we're off the grid for two weeks?
By the time you get back, she's probably gonna be remarried.
You gonna let him talk to you like that?
It's okay.
Okay, so, what's the plan,
Colonel Sanders?
How about you show us more of your trinkets...
...that won't get us off this island?
Anyone else thinking about the eggs hatching?
If you're afraid of a few critters, maybe you shouldn't have come, Henry.
It is called the Mysterious Island.
Should've expected mysterious things.
It's right in the title.
HANK:
I know what the book says.
You wanted to find Mysterious Island.
Mission accomplished.
You wanted to find your grandmother.
Mission accomplished.
At daybreak we're out of here.
And for the last time, it's Hank.
What's the hurry?
Tomorrow, I am gonna show you a place...
...that will take your breath away.
Like forever?
You're all gonna find out.
So let's get some shut-eye.
It's a big day tomorrow.
Good nighty, honey.
- Good night, Papa.
- Good nighty.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, apart from you stranding us on this stupid island, just fine.
Good. Good.
So, hey, I was thinking, you know, sometime we could hang out or something...
...if you wanted to.
I have a feeling that your idea of fun and my idea of fun are two very different things.
What do you like doing on the weekends?
Collect and label mollusks.
No way! Me too. I'm way into mollusks.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, which one's your favorite?
Mine's the Mxyzptlk snail.
You're not gonna believe me, but that's my favorite too.
I just made that up.
Mxyzptlk isn't a snail.
It's one of Superman's archenemies.
Way to slay the heart.
- Whatever.
- Getting the attention of a woman...
...is one of the hardest things to do.
All right.
So, what do I do, Casanova?
I been waiting a long time to have this talk with you, buddy.
There are three things to know about understanding girls.
Number one:
Don't follow your instincts.
Any other area in life...
...instincts will get you there.
Not with women.
So whatever you think you should do, do the opposite.
Number two:
You need to be open, sensitive.
Women don't want a man just because he's big and strong and has abs like mine. No.
They want a thinker, they want a feeler.
They want someone who can understand them.
Women want a man who is in touch with his most inner emotions.
And the third thing is the most important.
It's something that women have responded to for thousands of years.
Well, tell me.
You have got to do this.
What is that?
That is the pec pop of love.
Now go on and throw a berry.
- No.
- Throw a berry.
There's some behind you.
Grab one and throw it.
Don't be afraid, they're not gonna bite.
Boom.
Go ahead, grab a bunch.
Rapid-fire, now.
I'm not doing rapid-fire.
They will not stop until you feed them.
Feed them? No.
They're hungry.
I'll feed them.
Attaboy. Get some.
Okay, you ready? Ready?
Here we go.
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Stop.
Ready? This one's special.
Make this one count.
Mmm. No way, that's awesome.
Stop encouraging him.
It's a gift.
- It is a gift.
- He has a gift.
Sean, it works every time.
Come on, Gabby.
Get a move on.
Where's he going?
I don't know, but if this goes on much longer, he'll blow a hip. Come on.
Oh! I'm going.
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.
Get ready, Gabby.
I'm about to take your breath away.
GABATO:
Wow!
Unbelievable.
ALEXANDER:
How do you like Grandma now?
GABATO:
Hello!
ALEXANDER: No one's been home for thousands of years, Gabby.
Can anybody guess...
...what all this is?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Legoland?
No.
SEAN:
Well, that's Poseidon.
- Can you move this?
HANK: Yeah.
Atlantis.
I can't believe it.
We're standing in the lost city of Atlantis.
ALEXANDER: The same Atlantis that Verne wrote about, down to the last detail.
But wasn't Atlantis underwater?
Oh, when Verne wrote about it, it was, but it has a 140-year cycle...
...and spends half its time above the water.
- What about the other half?
SEAN: It's called tectonic recurrence.
The ocean bed buckles due to volcanic activity...
...pulling land to the surface.
Then the entire island sinks back to the bottom of the sea.
SEAN: Nobody's ever seen it on this big of a scale.
This is amazing.
Come with me.
I've been looking for this piece of paradise for 30 years.
I promised your old man that we'd find it together.
But he's not here to enjoy it...
...so I made sure that his son would be.
That is why I encoded that message.
I wanted an Anderson to see this place...
...before anyone else.
Some men get to put their names on stars, species...
...plants. We get to put our name...
...on this gorgeous island.
In two weeks, we'll contact the authorities to pick us up...
...and in three weeks, we'll be on the cover of TIME magazine.
Guys.
We got a problem.
What?
You see this? It's saltwater.
The only way saltwater gets this far inland is if it enters the subsoil from below.
So...?
This island's about to go under.
The only saltwater here is on your brain.
I've analyzed the samples...
...and I've calculated the numbers.
This island isn't due to sink for 14 years.
Alexander, your numbers are wrong.
- And how would you know that?
HANK: I've come across this...
...as we build over runoff areas.
It's called soil liquefaction.
Look, you can see it in the cracks in the confining beds all along here, along here...
...over there, back here.
ALEXANDER:
Okay, you made your point.
GABATO:
Well, how long do we have?
If I had to guess, based on all this water...
...two, three days max.
Then what? Because I ain't no flotation device, man.
You will be, we don't figure this out.
There must be some way off this island.
GABATO:
We could build a boat.
HANK: The storm around this island will chew it up, spit it out.
I've got something.
What about the Nautilus?
How is an exercise machine gonna help us get out of here?
No, no, the Nautilus.
Captain Nemo's submarine, built in 1870.
ALEXANDER:
Well done, Sean.
Chapter 16, Verne wrote it is hidden on the island.
If we can make it there in time, we can ride it under the hurricane back to Palau.
HANK:
Okay. One question:
Where is it?
There's only one man who can tell us that...
...and that is Captain Nemo himself.
The Dakkar Grotto.
The final resting place of Captain Nemo.
Legend has it his crew buried him there.
I'll tell you what had better be in there:
Nemo's journal.
It could tell us the location of the Nautilus.
I've never been able to crawl in there on my own. Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid.
I'll go.
I'm the only one who can fit.
No way. It's too dangerous.
Sweet, but I don't need your permission.
GABATO:
Honey?
- Papa loves you.
- You remember the drill.
Be careful.
Who knows what's down there.
Honey? Honey? You okay?!
I'm fine.
I'm inside!
What was that?
So that's what a sinking island sounds like.
Hank!
Hank!
Hurry!
GABATO:
Pull her out! Pull her out!
SEAN:
Hi.
GABATO: Man, that guy had some terrible handwriting.
- Looks like Sanskrit.
- Close. It's Hindi.
Yeah, Nemo's from India.
It says here...
...that the Nautilus is in a basalt...
...cave on the other side of the island, just...
...under Poseidon's Cliffs.
I know...
...this place.
That's where we gotta go.
What's the best way there?
Well, now, that depends.
The safest way is around the shoreline...
...but the fastest way is across the heart of the island.
What do you think, Hank?
- I think we got no choice. The quickest way.
- He's right.
- I'm in.
ALEXANDER: Yeah, but...
...let me warn you.
The heart of this island...
...is full of jagged mountains, dark jungles and terrifying creatures...
...who will give you nightmares.
So...
...who's up for an adventure?
GABATO:
Are we there yet?
ALEXANDER:
We get there when we get there, Gabby.
SEAN:
What was that?
The tectonic plates are starting to pull apart underneath the island.
We gotta move.
Let's go. Move.
Move.
Wait, what is that?
Volcanic ash?
It looks like...
ALEXANDER:
Gold.
Pure gold.
The treasure Stevenson... talked about in Treasure Island.
Volcanoes are made of what they erupt. So if that thing's erupting gold, then it's...
A mountain of gold.
SEAN:
Must be massive gold deposits.
Let's go check it out.
Hold on. That'll take us days out of our way. We don't have the time.
Let's make the time. Volcanic gold?
That's a huge scientific breakthrough.
I understand, but we gotta get to the Nautilus.
Hank, I'm not just a little kid. Okay?
I get a say in this too.
Sean, I am responsible for you.
I'd never take a chance with your life.
Hey, hey, you can't tell him what to do.
- You're not his father.
HANK: From what I hear...
...you haven't been much of a grandfather.
I have given him something to live up to.
Science, adventure, wonder.
What have you ever given him?
I've given him a lot of things, a sense of responsibility being one of them.
Something clearly you don't have.
You're not going.
We're getting out of here.
End of discussion.
Sean, please.
We have to get off this island.
GABATO:
Bye-bye, gold.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah. Fine.
It's just, you know, I don't need Hank trying to tell me what to do all the time.
My dad's always trying to get involved too, but he usually ends up embarrassing me.
Yeah? How?
Last summer I was trying to get a job...
...so he flew all over Palau dropping thousands of copies of my resume from his helicopter.
That's embarrassing.
Isn't that the worst when they try so hard?
No.
I mean, the worst would be if they didn't try at all.
Alexander, are you sure your compass readings are correct?
- Of course I am. Why?
- Why? Because we're down here...
...and we need to be all the way up there.
ALEXANDER: To every problem, there is...
...a solution, my large friend...
...and I think this might be a fun one.
You think this might be a fun one, eh?
Does anybody have an umbrella?
Because Mary Poppins is gonna fly us up to the top of the cliff.
I knew you'd be good for something.
Better wait here, Henry.
Where's he going?
I don't know, but that guy's out of his mind.
ALEXANDER:
Whoa! Ha, ha!
Oh, I most certainly am.
It turns out that mounting the bee is easy if you don't look into its eyes.
That is so sick.
Okay.
You get down now.
Why would I get down?
Well, because Medicare doesn't cover old ladies falling off of giant bees. Get down.
Suit yourself.
But make sure you're wearing swimming trunks when this place becomes the Pacific Ocean.
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!
Sean.
Can we fly together?
This is amazing!
Like riding stallions across the Serengeti.
This is beautiful! Talk about paradise!
Oh, man.
- Is that...?
- Bird poop?
Uh! Oh!
That must be one giant...
Bird!
HANK:
Into the trees!
That thing looks hungry!
A white-throated needletail.
It feeds on worms, aphids...
...and, yes, bees!
There's another one!
Hold on!
Watch out!
ALEXANDER:
Hey!
Stay in your own lane!
HANK:
Are you familiar with Chicken?
ALEXANDER:
These aren't chickens!
HANK:
No, the game! Chicken!
GABATO:
Oh!
I like the way he thinks.
Charge!
Not yet.
Not yet!
Now!
GABATO:
Oh!
Yeah! How cool was that, little buddy?
I love you, Hank! I love you so much!
I love you...
Too much happy.
That's too much happy.
SEAN:
Hold on!
Kailani!
You saved me.
Yeah, I guess I did.
Or maybe not!
Go, go! Get out of here!
Sean, what are you doing?
Come on, bird!
Let's do this!
Yes!
Aah!
Sean. Talk to me.
It's my ankle. I can't move it.
This could be serious.
I need to look at it.
Not here.
This part of town is even more dangerous after dark.
Okay. I'm gonna get you up, on three.
One, two, three. Up.
That's it.
ALEXANDER:
Give me your arm. Okay.
HANK:
Now come on.
Has the swelling gone down?
It's dislocated pretty bad.
We might be here a while.
Well, we'll go get some water.
We're gonna have to pop it back in, buddy.
Okay. Let's do it.
Alexander, I'll brace him.
You do it on three?
Got it.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One...
SEAN:
Aah!
- What happened to two and three?
- Yeah.
Two, three.
Wasn't so bad.
It wasn't very good.
Do we have anything for the pain?
There's nothing in here.
All right, buddy.
There you go. Okay.
Attaboy.
We have this.
No, no, no.
Don't worry. I don't sing to dudes underneath the stars in front of a cozy fire.
- It's not my style.
- Good.
You can sing?
A little bit.
Brilliant.
Music is nature's painkiller.
Sing him a song.
- No.
ALEXANDER: Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I got something special for you.
SEAN:
God!
HANK:
All right.
Oh, that's gonna make me feel better?
Slow it down. Just gotta get in tune.
Takes a big man to play a little guitar.
And an even bigger one to listen.
HANK (SINGING):
I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and for you
And I think to
Myself
What a wonderful world
I see giant bees and
I could have told ya
Don't trust Alexander
He's older than Yoda
And I think
To myself
What a wonderful world
The island
That we stand on
Well, it's currently sinking
Sending those secret codes
What the heck were you drinking?
But it's
All in the past
We wiped the slate clean
We're going to find
Nemo 's
Submarine
And you'll think to yourself
What a wonderful
World
Oh, yeah
Oh, that was extraordinary.
What, my multiple talents?
No, after all these years, finding the elusive singing Sasquatch.
No, but seriously, where'd you learn to play like that?
My dad used to sing it to me when I was a kid.
Ah.
Remind me to buy him a drink when we get back.
Yeah. Good luck finding him.
Why?
Where is he?
Don't know.
He left when I was 8, and I haven't seen him since.
At least I got a good song out of it, right?
Yeah.
You like him, don't you?
Who, Sean? No.
Yeah, he's a little hotheaded, you know.
But he seems to be a good kid.
It can never happen between us.
I mean, if we get off this island, he'll go back to America...
...move on with his life and go to college.
And I'll go back to tiny Palau.
You could go to college someday if that's something you really want.
Who's gonna help you at work?
Plus we can't afford it.
Don't say that. You wanna go to college, you can go to college.
Okay? I can make that happen.
I promise.
Thanks, Papa.
Hank.
Hank, get up.
Something's wrong here.
Everybody up!
Where'd this water come from?
The liquefaction rate tripled overnight.
What's that mean?
It's sinking a lot faster than we thought.
I thought you said a couple of days.
- Now more like a couple of hours.
- A couple of hours?
We need to get to that sub or we'll all be 20,000 leagues under the sea.
KAILANI:
Papa?
Papa?
Papa?
Papa!
- He's gone.
ALEXANDER: Stay calm.
He's probably gone for a pee.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
SEAN:
What?
Ugh. Last night, he promised me he'd send me to college.
Now I know what he meant.
He's going after the mountain of gold.
Look, I gotta go get him.
You guys head to the sub. If we're not there in time, leave without us.
No way. You're not going alone.
I'll go with you.
You have a dislocated ankle, that's four miles.
It's fine. I can do it. It'll be okay.
No, Sean, he's right.
You're in no condition to make that trip.
Well, she can't go alone.
Then I'll go with her.
I'm the one who...
...called you to this island.
It's my fault you're in this quagmire.
If this map of ours is right...
...then the Trident Cliffs should be about...
...a mile and a half in that direction.
You get to the Nautilus as soon as you can and then meet us...
- ...on the shoreline.
- We have one map.
HANK:
Let me see your phone.
Let me see this thing.
Now we have two.
Hank, well done.
Thank you...
...for calling me Hank.
Anytime.
Be careful.
ALEXANDER:
Come on, darling.
I'll see you soon.
I promise.
Ready, Sean?
Yeah.
Come on.
Ow! Ooh!
Oh, not that there! Ow!
That hurt too!
Gold.
Our prayers have been answered.
There's Poseidon's...
...Trident, right where it's supposed to be.
We need the cliff.
This is just shoreline.
The Nautilus is supposed to be inside of a cave right here.
Maybe the map is wrong.
Let me see it.
Sean, we are in the right place.
Well, then where's the cave?
Where's the Nautilus?
Down there.
The sea level's risen over 100 feet in the last 24 hours.
I can't believe this is happening.
We're too late. It's over.
No, it's not. It's okay. It's okay.
We just gotta think.
We just gotta think of a way to get...
I got it.
- What?
- Scuba tanks.
Are we listing things that we don't have?
Okay, a jet pack, a girlfriend, calligraphy paper.
No, no, listen to me. We just...
"Calligraphy paper"?
It popped into my head.
- We have a couple of dry bags, right?
- Yeah.
Okay, so we take what we salvaged from the beach, and we build makeshift scuba tanks.
No short breaths...
...no wasted movements.
Make sure you equalize ear pressure as you go down.
You know...
...if we die down there...
...Mom's gonna kill us.
Then let's do this.
KAILANI:
Papa?
Papa.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be back at the Nautilus. I'll meet you...
...back there.
Papa, stop.
Stop.
Papa, stop!
Baby, this is our one chance.
Our one chance to send you to college.
To give you a different life, a better life.
Papa.
We'll have all the wealth we'll ever need...
...just as long as we're together.
Let's go home.
All right. All right.
Okay.
ALEXANDER:
Double-time, Gabby.
Okay, it's only 100 feet down, and we've got two hits of air with this.
Right.
- Are you ready?
- Am I ready? Are you ready?
- Oh, I'm totally ready.
- Well, I'm totally ready.
Well, I'm probably more ready than you.
No, there's no way.
I'm, like, twice as ready as you are.
We're procrastinating out of fear, aren't we?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.
Wait, which way are you going?
Frankly, I'm not sure.
You're not sure?
Look, we're running out of time.
Well, which Way's north?
ALEXANDER:
Uh...
This way. No.
No.
No, that's not it. It's this way.
We're getting too much magnetic friction.
What does that mean?
It means we're lost.
We made it.
The Nautilus.
Come on.
Sean, give me the flashlight.
Let's power this up and get to the others.
KAILANI: How do we find north without a compass?
Spiders.
GABATO:
Oh, oh... Heh, heh.
I already rode a giant bee.
I ain't getting on no spider.
Spiders build their webs...
...facing south.
Uh, guys?
I think I found our spider.
GABATO:
Oh!
And we go the other way.
The ballast control panel's gotta be around here somewhere.
Where's the power switch?
I think this is it.
How do you know?
It's right there in chapter 17.
Someone's reading their Verne.
Let's fire this baby up.
Come on, come on. Wake up!
The engine's dead.
We gotta get under the hood.
HANK:
These batteries are 140 years old.
It's gonna need a jump-start.
Yeah, but that's gonna take thousands of kilowatts of electricity.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
That's completely insane.
Exactly.
- Cable attached to the harpoon?
- Yeah.
Great. One good charge from that thing out there, we're gonna be on our way.
Okay. But I need you to come back.
Of course. Somebody's gotta help you pilot this thing.
No, I mean...
Look, if anybody ever asks,
I'm gonna deny that I ever said this.
But I need you to come back.
I've had a lot of people take off on me in my life...
...and I don't want you to be one of them.
Before we left, I told your mom that I was gonna take care of her son.
You're not just her son.
You're my family too now.
I promise you I'll come back for you.
Okay?
Okay.
Now...
...who's up for an adventure?
Where are they?
They're not here.
GABATO:
Bumpy!
They'd better get here quick!
We're running out of real estate!
Hey!
Hey, over here!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Come on, Hank.
Come on!
HANK:
Where are you?
Come on, show me...
...that 1000-watt smile.
Do it now!
Yes!
KAILANI:
I love you, Papa.
I love you, baby.
Down we go!
We made it.
Not yet, we haven't!
Up ahead.
We're gonna be blocked.
Gabato, I need you to captain us out of here.
Me?
You brought us to the island, you can take us back.
GABATO:
Okay.
Sean, on my signal, hit that button.
Yeah, you right. It's like flying in my helicopter. Like... Okay.
ALEXANDER:
Hank!
Hank!
Fire it!
Hey, hey, man, we did it! We did it!
Yes!
GABATO: Yeah!
- Yeah!
SEAN: Yes!
- Yeah!
Gabato!
And we're on cruise control.
Nice work, man.
You too.
Can't believe we made it off the island.
Yeah.
(WHISPERING) Pop your pecs.
I'm not gonna pop my pecs.
Now's the time.
She's gonna love it, believe me.
- I'm not gonna pop pecs.
- Do it, do it. You can do it.
She would love it, believe me.
KAILANI:
Ahem.
You two done yet?
POP your pecs.
Thank you.
For everything.
That works too.
I'm so happy right now.
I don't know how...
...this moment could get better.
ALEXANDER:
Well, the one way...
...it could get better is if you steer us away from this coral reef.
GABATO:
Oh! Oh!
Okay.
That's a good idea, good idea.
Good afternoon, folks...
...and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours.
If you look out the window on your left...
...you will see what is known as the Pacific Ocean.
HANK:
Ugh. Here we go again.
BOY 1: Pass it!
BOY 2: Car!
BOY 3:
Game on!
For the third time today, Papa, I'm fine.
Yeah, but I heard there was a 2.3 magnitude earthquake in Ojai.
Is that anywhere near Ohio?
It's 2000 miles away.
You don't need to worry about any earthquakes.
- What about volcanoes?
- No.
Giant birds?
Goodbye, Papa. I love you.
I love you, sweetness.
Hey, can you wish Sean a happy birthday for me?
And maybe I'll call you later.
Say, in five minutes?
- Bye, Papa.
- I love you, baby. Bye.
Okay, are we ready for the journey?!
GABATO:
Whoo!
Yeah! Yeah!
KAILANI:
Hello.
Hey, guys.
I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey, darling.
- Hey.
- You look wonderful.
- Good to see you.
- Come here for a second.
KAILANI: Okay.
- Happy birthday.
- You raised a great man.
- No.
KAILANI: So sorry I'm late.
We are raising a great man.
Open this one first.
Postmarked Cameroon?
Oh, it's from Grandpa.
He wants to give me...
...his present next time he sees me.
Well, don't just sit there. Applaud!
Grandpa!
ALEXANDER: Hi.
KAILANI: Hey.
Can't believe you're here.
I wouldn't miss your birthday for the world.
I wanted to give you this.
A book?
Oh, it's not just a book.
It's a trip I want us to go on.
All of us, as a family.
From the Earth to the Moon.
What do you say?
Well, I think there's only one thing to say.
- So who's up for an adventure?
LIZ: No, no, no!
HANK: Oh, honey, what could possibly go wrong? It's only the moon.

One must be a sea to receive a poIIuted stream without becoming impure.
Lo, I teach you the Overman.
He is that sea.
What's the problem?
Did you drink too much last night? l can hold my liquor much better than you, servicemen.
That's just the rookies, and if you're not careful, you might end up like them, barfing your guts out inside your suit.
Watch and learn! l'm about to do some maneuvers only big boys can pull off!
You'd better give up and admit defeat,
Rhodey!
Your War Machine is all about firepower, not speed. lt's too heavy!
You might as well admit it.
You're never going to catch me!
Just watch me!
Gotcha!
You keep forgetting one thing, Tony. lt's not just speed that counts here, l'm an Air Force pilot with a whole lot of experience. l have years of training under my belt, in actual combat conditions! You're a novice who only just got his license!
No fair, shooting repulsor rays!
You said you were experienced in tactics!
You didn't see that coming?
Imagine if outbreaks of vioIence, murder, and terrorism couId aII be detected and prevented before they ever took pIaceI
It sounds Iike science-fiction, but it's not.
We're here to introduce the new
Howard sateIIite, deveIoped by Stark Industries.
This technoIogy wiII enabIe the
S.H.I.E.L.D. detection program to monitor every event and the fuII range of human activity, aII over the pIanet.
But there are those who are aIready caIIing it the uItimate spy sateIIite.
Privacy-rights advocates have demanded that Stark Industries scrap its depIoyment.
Tony Stark responded to those accusations in his presentation Iast night... l named this satellite ''Howard'' after my Dad, who always watched out for me.
It's a tribute to him.
And for a particuIar reason.
He beIieved in the concept of personaI freedom. The Howard sateIIite has not been designed to infringe upon that right.
Instead, it's an aII-seeing eye in the sky with one job, to identify and prevent troubIe before it occurs, 24 hours a day. Once it's Iaunched and activated, it wiII provide reIief to the victims of crime, and protect countIess Iives aII over the worId.
Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries, who is aIso known as Iron Man, is cIaiming the Iaunch of his new sateIIite wiII provide endIess benefits to ordinary citizens...
With many questions unanswered, there is much anxiety over potentiaI vioIations
-of privacy...
-PeopIe are wondering whether they're abIe to trust this man, who has a background as a weapons deaIer.
There is an undercurrent of anxiety that the sateIIite was deveIoped for some secret purpose.
There are those who say there is great danger in putting aII of our faith in technoIogy. Who wiII be in controI, man or machine?
Here comes Tony Stark in his Iron Man armor, and CoIoneI James Rhodes, fIying his War MachineI ObviousIy, they are both here to reassure the pubIic.
-Glad you're still alive.
-Not as much as me.
Who the hell are these guys?
They're targeting the Howard. l've run into these bastards before.
They're armored mercenaries who call themselves the ''Raiders.''
They must be paranoid that we're gonna be able to track their activities.
They're jamming the radio waves!
Data interrupt! We've lost communications!
Scramble our lnterceptors and get them out there.
Rhodey! Great work! lt's time for us to have a little chat, my friend.
If you answer niceIy, you might survive this interview. You'II be in prison, but at least you'll still be alive.
Am l supposed to be scared? My boss is more powerful than you.
He's far surpassed your capabilities.
He's that good, is he? Maybe l can find a job for him in my company.
We'd have to settle a few things first, like a claim for damages.
We've only just begun.
My boss is going to smash your satellite into pieces before you have a chance to play with it! lf he's that powerful, why is he so afraid to show himself?
Oh, he's here.
Rhodey!
Take care of this guy, will you?
Hey!
Have all staff except necessary personnel evacuate immediately!
-We're about to launch the satellite!
-Yes, sir!
Who's there? Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!
-Fuel update!
-Complete, sir!
-Launch pad status!
-Ready to go!
-Fire flow complete!
-Countdown continuing.
-Wind speed, eight miles per hour!
-Purging energy supply pipe!
-All systems are green!
Acknowledged!
Good morning.
And goodbye.
Huh? What the heck?
Unknown phenomenon.
No reference in the database.
PossibIe presence of erosive bioIogicaI ceIIs.
No one escapes. l won't let you do it!
Power is down. Energy reserves at 55% .
Who is this guy?
Insufficient data. Genome DNA extract impossibIe. Cannot read base sequence.
Unknown gene region.
Centrifuge is required to continue anaIysis.
You must be some kind of monster!
How could you sacrifice so many lives for a single satellite? Hey, you! Say something!
The leaders of all fascist companies appear to have similar eyes.
The eyes of smartass kids also seem the same.
People who place their faith in high-technology, like you, should be placed in museums with the rest of the fossils.
Actually, coffins would be better.
And kids who are all mouth, like you, should be sent to the Stark School of
Re-Education. l am Ezekiel.
Ezekiel? l promise you, l will be dancing around your coffin as they drive in the final nail. l will then hold a wake in the offbeat style you so favor. l'm not done with you yet!
Goodbye.
Shoot! What the hell is this?
Tony, where are you?
What happened down here?
What's going on in this place? l'm done on my end!
Tony, are you down here somewhere?
-Don't come any further!
-What? Are you in trouble?
What's that? Tony! l don't believe this.
The control tower's gone!
-Any signs of life?
-l'm afraid not.
Wait! l see some movement down in the rubble! lt's Tony Stark! He made it out, sir! lron Man is alive!
Send Black Widow to pick him up!
And hurry!
We need to debrief him immediately!
Come on! Where are you, Rhodey?
Come on! You've got to be here somewhere! l'll find you, no matter how long it takes! lf you're alive, answer me!
Natasha! Help me find Rhodey! Please!
Stark! There's no time to waste, we have to get out of here.
Fury has ordered me to escort you to the helicarrier.
The medical team will continue to search for survivors, but casualties are expected to rise to more than 300 people.
Nick! Rhodey died! Right in front of me!
And so did a lot of other people.
Who the hell were these guys?
All their signals were blocked by a very powerful electromagnetic field. l was hoping you could give us some guidance.
He was a smartass kid.
His armor was weird. lt was very advanced, l'll tell you that is something l've never seen before. lt was techno bio-organic matter, combined with manmade mechanisms!
Techno bio-organic armor? l'm gonna find that guy. And when l do, l'm gonna make him pay for Rhodey!
Nick! What's going on here?
What are you up to?
You're not leaving this complex, Stark.
Not until S.H.l.E.L.D. has worked out exactly what's going on.
Are you suggesting l had something to do with this?
We have more questions.
What happened just now is being broadcast everywhere. lt's being played out on every news channel on every television across the planet. lf we don't provide an explanation some high-up heads at the Pentagon are going to roll.
Just routine procedure, of course.
Business as usual.
They have enough heads.
Believe me, they can afford to lose a few.
That's not the most important thing now.
We need to get hold of that kid before he causes any more damage.
And that's exactly what l'm gonna do!
Go after him.
NickI WiII you caII off your pit-buII?
For God's sake! l don't have time to mess around!
That's too bad. l'm the only one who has a chance against that smart-ass kid's technology!
You probabIy won't beIieve it, but l'm telling you the truth, l'm not enjoying this one bit.
There are rules. And whether you like it or not, l happen to be duty-bound to obey them. There'II be heII to pay if I Iet our onIy witness get himseIf kiIIed.
You government workers sure have a tough job.
Homing missiIes Iocked on and tracking.
Thanks a lot for the update!
Wanna play?
Commander, he's goneI We've Iost himI
Natasha?
Sorry, Natasha.
Stark! l need to teach that kid the greatness of technology. l'm going to have to find out where its weaknesses are.
How's the art coming? l'm still working on it. l love art, but l don't intend to become an artist. After all this time playing around, l realize l don't have the talent for it like my uncle.
You shouldn't give up in frustration.
Your body has the DNA for it.
There's something l've finally come to realize.
Even with talent, you need chaos to give birth to a dancing star. l'm not sure l have it.
Someday, man will no longer give birth to any star.
By the way, l see they managed to launch the satellite after all.
The Raiders couldn't control the reinforced functions l gave them.
However, it's still early in the game. l'll be preparing another offensive.
Tony Stark.
Tony Stark.
He seems to be in possession of a wide range of technological icons.
And one of the high-tech graven images these people pIace on an aItar to worship, is his new sateIIite.
-He's the high priest of technoIogy.
-Yes.
But it's a conceited and fooIish misunderstanding.
TechnoIogy and the peopIe who give birth to it are nothing more than faIse idoIs,
Ieading society to disaster. lt's a tiresome task.
But these people must be taught the truth. l need your help!
Excuse me?
Check the black market for bio-related products.
You promised me a full week's vacation!
And anyway, aren't you supposed to be in
Utah for the launch of that new satellite you developed? l'll make it up to you, Pepper. l'll tell you what. This year, you can have the villa and a whole support staff.
Thanks, but you already gave me that to
-make up for losing last year's vacation.
-l did? Okay, then how about l rent you an entire village or something?
Please, Pepper. lt's urgent.
-What's going on here?
-l'll tell you inside.
How long is it before the Howard goes online?
Everything should be active within four hours.
We're going to use that satellite to find its maker.
As of now, priority one is capturing the fugitive lron Man.
Poor Rhodey. l can't believe it. l can't believe he was such an idiot for letting that kid get him. l could've taken care of myself.
He didn't need to come looking for me.
You're saying the killer was a child?
Yeah, some know-it-all kid!
There was something about him, though, that was very intriguing.
The bottom line is, if he was able to create a technology that l've never seen or heard of before, he deserves a little respect.
His sense of design isn't really my cup of tea.
But his results are.
As you know, l've dealt with some shady vendors in the past.
But Rhodey was the exact opposite.
He was a straight arrow. All the time l knew him, he never broke the rules or left the straight and narrow. l admired him.
He really believed in the dream.
Rhodey was a government worker and a normal person. l'm nothing but a rich genius.
The worlds we lived in were so different, it's amazing we got along at all.
He was a good friend, but l'm not sad about it. l'm fine, really. lt's a shame, though, that l lost someone to race against. l guess l should have let him win some of the times.
Tony.
That suit was made of technology l've never seen before.
Nanotechnology? Biotechnology? No. lt was nowhere near as simple as that.
He had inserted the integral DNA of living organisms into a material based on the functions of a human body. lt couldn't be done in a normal research facility.
Could he somehow be using mutated cells? No!
He's synthesizing them in a molecule assembler! lf not, it wouldn't be stable.
Tony. l need you to authorize access.
Stark, vocal authorization.
Nanomachines, nanotechnology.
Here's something on human-mech hybrids.
There's research being done all over the world, but no one has announced a practical application. l haven't heard of any successes, either.
But l have to believe my own eyes.
What l saw was a definite breakthrough. lt merged biotechnology and mechatronics.
Customized artificial neurons were working in conjunction with the human nervous system.
He was controlling them perfectly.
A.l.M! lt's a company called
Advanced ldea Mechanics and they're the largest supplier in the black market.
They've been researching biotechnological hybrid armors for a long time, in secret. ln recent years, they've continuously invested vast amounts of capital.
Does your data indicate where their research facility is located?
Let me see.
Karachi, Pakistan! There's a secret lab there!
The facility is being fronted as a warehouse for medical supplies.
But actually, they're involved with chemical warfare research and the sales of illegal weapons. l've downloaded map coordinates in case you plan to pay them a visit.
Thanks, Pepper.
You can return to your vacation now.
Are you going to be okay on your own?
A kid misbehaved.
An adult needs to discipline him.
You're a kid yourself, Tony, an obstinate, stubborn kid.
Are you going to scold me, Pepper?
Why do you keep putting me in that position? l don't want to be the only adult in this relationship. lt's intriguing, though. l find l'm drawn to more mature women.
Especially when they're beautiful.
Darn it.
Tony. lron Man is not responding.
All signals are being blocked.
Damn it! Teams Blue and Gold, cover all escape routes! Team Red, move in on my command. Capture and contain!
-lt's S.H.l.E.L.D. What did you do this time?
-Something awful, l imagine. l suppose it's too late to apologize.
Confirming as our target, Mr. Tony Stark.
Checking profiIe.
Target identified.
Mr. Stark, pIease throw away your weapons and surrender immediateIy.
PIease compIy.
PIease compIy.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
PIease compIy.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
Sorry, Nick. l don't have time to waste right now. l'll pay for the damages. l have to go.
Fire.
There goes my vacation. Predictable.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
AII Mandroids have Iost position of Iron Man.
Visual monitors are disabled.
Switching to motion sensors.
Hey, boys, l'd love to keep playing.
But l think it's time to excuse myself.
Sorry, Nick, but l had to do what l thought was necessary. l think you need to improve the A-One on the Mandroids.
After facing off with them, l have to say, they seem a little vulnerable to me!
All Mandroids have been annihilated.
Get me special agents Barton and Romanova.
Right away, sir.
So, Miss Potts. ls your boss free any time in the near future? l'm afraid he's fully booked for the next three years or so.
Of course. Being Tony Stark, he never follows his schedule.
Then he blames me when he misses his appointments.
There's something l want to show you. l was trying to tell your crazy boss about this, but he appears to be blocking all communications.
One day he's going to go off half-cocked, and run into something unexpected he can't handle.
They herald the coming of the lightning, and perish as heralds.
-Lo.
-Lo.
-l am a herald of the lightning.
-l am a herald of the lightning. l feel good today. lt's so beautiful.
With the Technovores, l will have great power. l will be able to control any machine, using the interface built into this armor.
So. Are you ready to go?
Yes. l will now be able to infect the satellite and bring it down.
We will grind these oppressors and their techno gods to dust. lt's up to you, however, as to where you want to use it.
Obviously.
Excellent. We have a deal, my friend.
Tell your associates A.l.M. says hello.
What's wrong?
Shit! lt's the Punisher! How did he track me?
We're being blown to bits over here!
You need to send reinforcements right away!
What do you mean, 10 minutes?
Nobody's gonna be alive here in 10 minutes!
We need them in 10 seconds!
What do you think you're doing?
Let me handle this, Punisher. l don't need help from a company president who can't stay out of the limelight.
These guys are scum.
They don't deserve to live.
Punisher, l don't disagree with your feelings.
But l need some answers before you wipe 'em out. l have all the answers l need.
Get out of the way. lf you shoot, l'll blast you from here to Tokyo!
Fine, go ahead. l appreciate it. All right. Let's get this over with while Punisher's still in a good mood. l need to know about the men who hired you.
Do you think an A.l.M. man would give up the identity of his clients?
Come on, Stark! You of all people should know what would happen if l were to do that!
Let me guess.
You'd never be able to do business again.
Permanently! l figured.
But thanks for the directory anyway.
Nice work.
So, neo-terrorists.
Techno-organisms, buyers of body armor.
Let's see who you've been dealing with.
Ezekiel?
Ezekiel. Wait a minute! l know that name!
But l've got a dossier on him, if it's any use to you.
-You're sure about that?
-l remember that name, too.
As a friend, you'd let me read that dossier?
Huh! Now you're a friend?
The same friend who threatened to blast me from here to Tokyo? l guess our job is done. Let's get out of here.
How can you drink this coffee? lt's like sludge. lt's military issue.
Drinking it at night in the jungle used to calm me down.
Actually this place kind of reminds me of a jungle.
Here's the file. l found it.
Ezekiel Stane... Stane! Wait!
Obadiah Stane's son?
That would be pretty disgusting.
This nutcase turns out to be the son of your old partner?
Obadiah went crazy. l had no choice at the time.
I had to kiII him.
Are you telling me he's that Ezekiel Stane?
But he's supposed to have died in an aircraft accident!
At the age of 16!
His father had a lot of assets hidden around the world.
Having inherited all that, l'm sure a clever kid like him would know how to put it to very good use.
Nowadays, a little cash can make the impossible possible.
You're right. There's no denying that.
Looks to me like this kid has been burying his trail for a lot of years.
And now he shows up in the form of a sociopathic super-genius.
There are rumors he injected his brain with nanobots to make himseIf smarter than he already was.
According to this, he's involved in a wide range of shady research.
From synthetic drugs to nanotechnology.
One of his interests is techno-organic armor.
What a surprise.
He won't be an easy opponent to handle. l've been after him for six months and l haven't been able to pin him down.
-Let me try something.
-What are you looking for? l'm hacking directly into the
S.H.l.E.L.D. network. l figure if l cross-reference your dossier with the data in the network l might be able to find out where he is.
Computer geeks are something else.
Thirty miles to Karachi.
Log note, I'm briefing Agent Natasha
Romanova, and Agent CIint Barton.
Here's the update, it's been confirmed that
Stark has joined forces with Frank CastIe, known as ''The Punisher. ''
That weapon-crazy lunatic?
Although l hear he's not very good with a bow and arrow. l want to get out of this country as quickly as possible. lf it's discovered that we're violating the airspace of a sovereign nation, it'll cause an international incident.
You have 40 minutes to complete the mission and get back to the ship.
Shanghai? l don't get it.
What would he know about a place like that?
We had a weapons research center there, until l decided to close it down a few years ago.
Then someone bought the property and built a luxury hotel there with a penthouse suite for wealthy VlPs.
The hotel's privacy is as tight as a Swiss bank.
The land itself was apparently purchased by Obadiah Stane.
You see how effective a little bit of cash can be?
Thanks for everything, Frank.
The next time l come, l'm gonna bring you a bag of the best coffee in the world.
Hello, we've got company!
Oh, boy! l knew they'd come, sooner or later.
They sure seem to have a lot of time on their hands.
See you.
Wait!
There is an object approaching from behind. ls it a missile?
Negative.
Bulls-eye!
Some freakin' arrows caused this much damage?
Conducting system check.
So glad l installed a protective force field.
Give up, Stark, and come with us to see the Director.
You really think he's going to come along willingly?
System interrupt. Initiating forced shutdown.
Hold on, wait a minute!
Stop fighting.
There's no way you can get loose.
You might as well accept it.
The game's over, buddy. We're taking you in.
Listen, Stark! ln the helicarrier's medical bay is...
Watch out! You're not too good at this, Stark!
Crap, he's getting away!
Tell me something.
Are you trying to be as obvious as you can?
What do you mean, Stark? l thought you liked the attention.
Not when l look like five miles of bad road!
Well then, hang on, buddy!
What's your problem, mister? lt's over, Stark! lf you join forces with a crazed vigilante killer, no-one's gonna take you seriously as a hero, buddy!
That son of a gun!
Don't do it, Frank!
They're just following orders! l'm not trying to kill them! l just want them to know we're not about to surrender!
Shit!
-You ready?
-Leave it to me!
Bingo!
All right, guys! lf you don't want to get hurt any further, you'd better come out!
We hear you. But before we do, here's a little gift!
You bastard!
Thanks for the compliment. Now throw down your weapons and raise your hands!
Did you hear me?
Good girl.
You, too!
Fine. You jerk.
Don't think you're gonna get away with this.
Bunch of bleeding-heart S.H.l.E.L.D weaklings! lf you disrespect me again, l'll... lf you don't want a tunnel bored in your head, throw your guns away!
Whatever. l don't need them now, anyway. l guess l was able to buy enough time.
Power reserves now recovered to 40% .
Good, now go ahead and re-route force field reserves to thrusters.
Affirmative.
Come back here! lt's no use. Your arrows won't reach him.
Darn it!
Power reserves fuIIy recovered.
AII systems are now optimaI. l've wasted too much time. l can already hear the boss dismissing us, sarcastically.
Yeah. lt makes me want to bore a hole into my own head.
You owe me, Stark.
Payback won't be cheap. l hear a soft breeze.
And that wind gathers another soft wind. l can sense our destiny.
We come together with that wind.
Listen carefully, Sasha.
Can you hear it, as well?
Jarvis, have you got anything?
Readings are uncIear. There's interference.
Wait, there is a sIight reaction.
It couId weII be a Iiving organism.
That doesn't help me much.
Hey boy! l came to see you.
Why don't you turn the lights on for me?
When l was young, l played hide and seek. l hid in the dark garage for so long, l fell asleep.
After a while, my mom, Maria, came to look for me. She was worried sick.
-Did your parents do the same for you?
-l've never played hide and seek.
Five meters behind you, the air shifted.
And the room temperature changed sIightIy.
Where did you come from?
Did you use magic?
My mom was very upset by my behavior. l worried her with my appearances and disappearances. lf you keep this up, your Mom will get upset, too.
Or your Dad, if he's still around. l don't hide from anyone.
You're simply not looking in the right place.
Really? This is starting to feel more and more like a kid's game to me. l told you before, l've never played hide and seek.
And my Dad that you speak of, l suspect you know who he is.
You might as well say his name.
-Obadiah!
-That is correct.
He can summon up a hoIogram, just Iike thatI
-You want revenge?
-Revenge? Why would l want that?
Because l killed him. You knew that.
Wait, that's right. You were involved, weren't you? l remember now.
You'd forgotten that? lt wasn't as important an event in my life as you might imagine.
We weren't actually that close.
Then why are you targeting me?
-Don't be so conceited.
-What? l wasn't targeting you specifically. lt's just that you were standing in my way. l don't understand. What are you saying?
But he kiIIed Rhodey.
Even if it was just a prank, some things cannot be forgiven!
Rapid power decrease.
System error detected.
What's going on?
Synthetic aIIoys and unknown bioIogicaI entities have invaded the system.
Technovores.
Power source and aII sensors have been compromised.
Technovores?
This armor is pretty well made.
Who do you think made it? l'm impressed.
For someone like you, it's good. l realize you can't move.
But believe me, Sasha will still be impressed.
Sasha?
This must be your pride and joy.
The arc reactor.
Don't you have anything to say?
Like how you think Tony Stark is a genius? l must say, it's very well made.
For you people, that is.
What does that mean ''you people''? l'll have you know...
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and as a result, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden.
And 160,000 years ago in Africa,
Mitochondrial Eve was born.
The ancestor of humankind.
Very impressive. Did you study the history of mankind in college?
Now there are over seven billion people on Earth.
What does that have to do with anything?
You asked what l meant when l said ''you people.'' That's what l was referring to.
You talk as though you're not a part of the human race.
That's exactly how l feel. l think l'm different from the rest of you.
-Then what are you?
-lt's somewhat hard to describe, really.
But if l were forced to explain it in words, l guess l would be a breeze.
A breeze? l'm a little confused, can you elaborate on that?
Sasha would also be a breeze.
Who is this ''Sasha'' you keep referring to?
A girlfriend?
A gentle breeze that caresses your skin.
And ruffles up the grass and trees. l see. l have no idea what you're talking about. But l'm beginning to understand one thing.
Obadiah wasn't a very attentive father.
He let you get lost in a world of dreams.
You represent the dinosaurs of the past. l, however, represent the future.
Dinosaurs of the past?
You should consider retirement.
That sounds pretty good to me. l could relax in a nice, quiet place. ln fact, l actually tried that once.
But my personal assistant just won't let me.
This time, l'm afraid l'll have to override her.
You'll retire for sure.
You understand the situation, don't you?
New wind, new future.
A brand new world is created to go with the brand new future.
A completely new technology will be created.
The old will die out, and the new will be born.
That is the providence of nature.
A superior technology to that of man.
Howard will be the whistling arrow that announces the new reality.
You should be honored.
The wind that follows is going to blow away your most advanced technology.
Howard will be the shot that leads the way.
Hey. Obadiah was lucky he didn't hang around long enough to see this.
New technology, you say?
Technovores, you called it?
Don't make me laugh.
The birth of mankind. Refinement of steel.
Computers, biotechnology.
The things you call old technology have all been linked and accumulated to create your ''technovore.'' lt's not new at all.
The truth is, it's only been born and exists because of the past.
You think you represent a brand new form of existence?
You're mistaken, kid.
You're no more advanced than the rest of us.
You were born from human parents.
So?
You're just a petulant child throwing temper tantrums. And just like a child, if you've been bad, it's an adult's responsibility to correct you.
You would do that? l don't think so. Be quiet for a second.
Part of the system has been restored.
Where? Search for the area that's functional!
The missile!
Locked on target.
Foolish man.
Do you know what will be written on the brass plate that gets installed on your exhibit in the museum?
''Here lies a fragment of lron Man.''
But only if someone is able to identify those fragments after l blow you up.
You spoilt kid. l don't want to put the curators of the museum to that much trouble!
Perhaps if we had had more time, l could have taught you a few things.
Well, it's time for goodbye, Tony Stark.
There's still quite a bit of work to do.
What's wrong, boy?
Invading technovore now being removed.
Restarting system, restoring circuits.
Energy charge in three, two, one, compIete.
What's the matter, boy?
You look like you're in trouble.
Do you need the hand of an adult? l don't believe l do.
The future is full of uncertain elements. lt's okay for a child to rely on adults.
Send energy to the reactor!
Force field deployed!
Hey, where did you go, boy?
Hide and seek time is over!
You went too quickly.
You can't break me...
And you're unable to change the future because that timeline's already written. lt's a blessing your father's not here to witness this all play out.
That's enough, Stark! lt took long enough but we finally caught up with you!
You're coming in with us to see the Director or l'm gonna add an extra hole in your head!
All right, William Tell. You made your point. l'll go, but only if she takes me in.
You only got 98 on your test?
Without a perfect score, you're the same as the other idiots!
Go to your room and reflect on your shortcomings until dinner. l thought you were much better than this!
You're a disappointment!
Did you listen to me? l told you never to touch my Monger!
You little fool! This Monger is worth 10 times as much as you!
My God! l can't believe what l'm seeing!
Rhodey survived that attack?
Has he woken up at all?
He's being kept alive by the life-support system but so far we haven't seen...
Hey, Rhodey! Rhodey, can you hear me? lf you don't wake up you're gonna die a loser!
You can't die without beating me in a race at least once!
-That would be shameful!
-Tony...
Wait a minute! How 'bout this? lf you wake up l'll concede the next race to you! l'll introduce you to a beautiful woman, too!
You just tell me which model on which page of that magazine you were looking at!
Anyone at all! Except the girl on page 10. l've got dibs on her. Just don't tell Pepper!
Other than that, anybody you want!
All stations! An unknown program is hacking into our system!
-Shutting off communications!
-Starting antivirus program! lnitiating defense protocols!
How are the main servers?
We can't stop it.
Someone breached our security and is invading our systems.
Technovores.
-Ezekiel's Technovores are the invaders.
-What? l'm sure the servers have been taken over by now. lt's too late.
Damn it!
He's gone! Where did he go?
The Howard is under attack!
What's happening? lnitiate Guardian program! lt won't start!
The firewall is about to be breached! lf we don't do something immediately, all the systems in Howard will be taken over! l'm right here. Look around for me.
My, my. You're not very observant. l'm right beside you.
Above us!
Are you okay?
Yeah, here's the problem.
Howard has the power to access every computer in the world. lncluding military satellites.
Exactly. He's planning to make Howard the source to hack into the world's military satellites and control them.
Ezekiel called that the wind.
The wind?
He's planning to wipe out everything that lives on this planet!
-What happened to the server room?
-l haven't been able to get a response.
Stark! What are you planning to do? l'm going to fix the computer so we can use it. lf l can divert the power of the arc reactor and aim it at the Technovores, l can annihilate them. l'm pretty sure l can survive for five minutes without this old heart of mine.
After that, l guess it's straight to heaven! l can't tell the situation from here.
What do you want to do? l guess we should return to the bridge.
Ezekiel is definitely coming here to target us.
WarningI WarningI
Power reserves decreasing rapidIyI
Ezekiel!
He's here!
Hi there, ''Old Man'' Tony!
Stop this, now!
Where are Clint and Natasha?
-They're tucked away safe and sound.
-What?
-Don't worry about them.
-Connect it.
Good, Maria. Now re-boot the Howard.
Rebooting Howard, sir! The Guardian program has also been initiated!
You people are determined to try and get in my way somehow.
Come here. Sit down.
You and l are gonna have a talk! Right now!
No matter what you think about your father l can tell you Obadiah loved you very much. lt was a pretty straightforward bargain.
He was human and you were his son!
Was that all? lsn't that enough? You'll achieve nothing if you throw away your history. l have personal experience. l was only able to move forward by accepting my father.
And you'll only create a new world by accepting the past and building on it.
A relic like you is lecturing me about the future? How amusing...
Why should l listen to someone irrelevant?
The Technovores!
Why... Why are you betraying me?
Together, we could have defeated them. l can't see anything, feel anything.
-Sorry, Ezekiel.
-The wind...
...has stopped. l've lost all instruments! l have no control over the helicarrier! lt's losing altitude!
Shoot him!
Come over here! This way, you bastard!
Hurry up, Maria!
Reactor detected.
Power reserve at 15 percent. l have that much?
That's it, pal. Playtime is over!
Propulsive force still inoperable!
Too many engines are offline!
Where are we going to land?
Shanghai, China!
Contact the Chinese government!
Have them evacuate everyone!
Tony, what's going on up there?

Well, that's it!
This kid needs some serious disciplining!

My body won't move.
Rhodey, is that you?
Rhodey...
Guess l must have overslept!
Remind me to reward you later for waking up, old friend!
-Rhodey...
-How did he...
Rhodey!
What in the...
Wait, Rhodey!
What the hell...
What's happening?
Whatever it is, we're gonna have to put an end to it, right now!
Let's go!
Peace to everything.
Fear... Leave it to me, you powerIess immature beings.
I wiII bring prosperity to aII.
I wiII proceed with saIvation for aII.

What is this guy saying?
Rhodey!
Do you understand what's going on?
We have to conserve our energy resources!
But we can't just let him destroy everything!
Stop wasting bullets!
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do then? l don't know what we can do! l'm trying to think of something!
...finaI... universe... reincarnation...
We've lost control of the Howard!
PowerIess and immature beings...
Prosperity...
I wiII proceed with the saIvation of aII.
He's replicated it!
He's using the Howard to control all the other military satellites in orbit! l'm confused! What's this all about? ls he planning an attack?
Ezekiel, you said that a new wind would create a new future. ls this how you plan to reset the world?
Destroy everything and start all over?
All of the military satellites have been repositioned! He's preparing to attack!
...worId... technoIogy...
I wiII start...
He's completely insane.
He's going to destroy the world.
Tony, we should save our nail clippings.
-What?
-To be filed with our wills. As keepsakes. l hate to bring this up but why would we do that?
There won't be anyone left to give them to. l thought it might be something
Pepper could remember us by.
Wait a minute. Pepper!
Wills...
Leaving something behind...
Of course!
-Pepper! Pepper, can you hear me?
-Yes, sir.
Are you focused enough to heIp me one Iast time?
Anything but dictation.
You're an amazing secretary but it's a IittIe more compIicated than that. l'm not surprised.
You can't do anything without my input.
I want to give you a present before I die.
What's the one thing you've never had since I've known you?
What do you truly want, more than anything else?
What do l want more than anything else?
That's easy. What l want is a vacation!
Vacation. Vacation.
Vacation. Vacation. Vacation.
Vacation. Vacation.
We're starting to regain control of the Howard!
Good job, PepperI I was abIe to get through Howard's back doorI
What back door? l'm not all-powerful. l'm an imperfect human and l realized a while ago that l had to be careful.
I programmed a back door into the sateIIite to protect it from unauthorized users.
When did you set up my voice as the password?
You taIked in your sIeep when you passed out at your desk.
-l don't remember that.
-You wouldn't.
But l was able to uplink my armor to the Howard at the time.
You've earned that vacation twice over.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The particIe-beam cannon on the Chinese miIitary sateIIite is about to shootI
I'm onIy abIe to controI one sateIIite and I won't have controI for IongI l want to show this guy something l have that he doesn't!
Are you out of your mind?
What are you gonna do?
This is gonna be our last chance, so listen carefully!
The Technovores are trying to take over the Howard by hacking inI
How much time do we have?
Tens of seconds, that's all. l'm counting on you Rhodey. Okay?
All right, Jarvis, pull the trigger!
AffirmativeI
Tony!
Here we go!
Hope your little nap didn't affect your aim!
Aim at what?
All right, it's aligned.
Rhodey! This is it!
You've only got one chance!
Let's do it!
Release the energy of the arc reactor!
The Technovores reacted. Aim for the crack!
-Careful...
-All missiles are ready to launch!
Rhodey, we have no time! You have to shoot!
Do it now! lt's our last chance before the world ends.
Shoot!
All missiles, armed and ready!
Rhodey!
Bear down and shoot!
Everything should work now!
Launching!
Tony!
Yeah, the last thing l can remember is watching the bombs go off. l guess the Technovores decided they needed to repair you before they could override your system.
And in the process, it looks to me like they saved your life.
That was fortunate.
Now it's your turn to recover!
At least you'll be taken care of by a bunch of hot nurses! l'm glad you're okay, Tony, but if you do anything like that again, l'll kill you myself. l hear you, Pepper.
When a child is bad, you need to scold him.
So, you're finally getting it.
You're an obstinate child...
...who needs discipline.
And it's an adult's duty to provide that discipline.
Do you hate women who scold?
Not really.
All boys look up to authority figures.
Especially when they're as beautiful as you.
Don't forget, now.
You promised me a vacation.
Of course. So where do you want to go?
-I'II take some days off, too.
-What?
Let's take a vacation.
Just the two of us. How 'bout it?
Is that an order, sir?
No. It's more Iike a suggestion.
Well then, l suggest you and l pack up.
The insane man shut up and Iooked at the audience.
The audience aIso shut up and Iooked at him.
He regained consciousness last night.
He has a visitor today but there's been no change. He's still mentally deranged.
He finally threw his light against the ground.
The light shattered and died out.
This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering. lt has not yet reached the ears of men.
Deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard.
This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant of stars.
Still, they were able to do the deed.
According to the people, this insane man forced his way into various churches that day singing, ''Requiem.''
The wind!
[2979][3033]You know, showboating like that|just makes you look desperate.
[3033][3071]Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."|Pathetic.
[3071][3113]- Yeah.|- Daniel, that was awesome!
[3113][3140]Nicole.
[3173][3195]Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?
[3195][3244]Should've let me talk to her.
[3285][3314]Whoo-hoo!
[3374][3413]I love it out here.
[3425][3478]The Big Dipper.|It's my favorite.
[3479][3496]- Do you know that one?|- No.
[3496][3539]I got a D in Astronomy.
[3565][3594]So, I never see you with anyone.
[3594][3664]Do you have a girlfriend|out of town or something?
[3698][3733]Daniel? Daniel?
[3787][3831]I want you to feel this!
[3832][3882]This is what's coming for you.
[3898][3931]Daniel, are you OK?
[3931][3962]Oh, my God.
[3996][4054]He's a freak.|He's some kind of freak.
[4485][4514]Number Three's dead.
[4514][4548]You all right?
[4548][4608]- Yeah.|- Anyone else see what happened?
[4983][5059]I told you not to keep this crap.|It just slows us down.
[5291][5331]All right, let's go.
[5383][5410]Daniel.
[5469][5508]/This is the part|/I hate the most, the running.
[5508][5541]/But it's the only thing|/in my life that's real.
[5541][5559]/The rest is a lie.
[5559][5582]/Even Henri.
[5582][5601]/People think he's my father.
[5601][5618]/He's not.
[5618][5677]/He's a warrior from my planet,|/assigned to keep me alive.
[5677][5699]/I don't remember my father.
[5699][5732]/All he left for me|/was some kind of box.
[5732][5786]/Henri says he'll pass it on to me|/when the time is right.
[5786][5817]/I got my first scar|/when I was nine years old,
[5817][5843]/near the border of Mexico.
[5843][5872]/It woke me from my sleep.
[5872][5920]/It was the first sign that the|/Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.
[5920][5950]/The second scar|/came when I was 12.
[5950][5993]/I was in Colorado,|/in the middle of a spelling bee.
[5993][6038]/As soon as I felt it,|/I knew Number Two was dead.
[6038][6091]/Last night, I got my third scar.
[6093][6142]/I was just a kid when the Mogadorians|/invaded my planet, Lorien.
[6142][6167]/Nine of us children escaped.
[6167][6212]/We were gifted, meant to protect|/our people when we grew up.
[6212][6261]/We never got the chance.|/Everyone was killed.
[6261][6290]/We are the last of our kind.
[6290][6333]/Three of us are gone. Dead.
[6333][6384]/They are hunting us down,|/one by one, in order.
[6384][6419]/I know I'm next.
[6419][6434]/I am Number Four.
[6434][6448]All right, well, so...
[6448][6477]Daniel won't be in school|the rest of the semester.
[6477][6510]OK. You, too.
[6522][6544]Your new ID.
[6544][6589]And this time, you stay out of sight,|huh? No school, no teams, nothing.
[6589][6610]John Smith. Very original.
[6610][6680]I don't want to be original.|I want to be invisible.
[6680][6702]This time was different.
[6702][6722]I didn't just get a scar.
[6722][6769]I, uh... I saw Number Three.
[6769][6818]I felt the knife, I felt him die.|I could tell we all did.
[6818][6852]- The others.|- We should get moving.
[6852][6891]Mogadorians could've|already picked up our scent.
[6891][6968]We're going to Paradise.|I have business to take care of.
[7617][7648]It's Bernie Kosar.
[7648][7684]Played football.
[7699][7741]- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.|- Hm. Good to know.
[7741][7806]- Next time, I get to pick the place.|- Yeah.
[8087][8114]That's all of it.|I'm going to bed.
[8114][8164]Ooh. Hang on.|I need a new picture.
[8164][8189]We have to wipe out anything|that hits the Internet.
[8189][8224]Say "Paradise."
[8283][8294]Oh, shit.
[8294][8353]This is why|I need you to be invisible.
[8631][8661]Get back inside.
[8661][8675]John.
[8675][8721]Come on. Come back inside.
[8806][8861]Little small for a Mogadorian,|don't you think?
[8861][8880]I'm sure he belongs to someone.
[8880][8912]He doesn't|have any collar or tags.
[8912][8968]Hm. Somebody, somewhere,|must miss you, huh?
[8968][8982]Come on.
[8982][9017]Another pair of eyes|and ears watching the house?
[9017][9074]- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.|- Talk to me.
[9074][9093]Yeah, keep the dog.
[9093][9122]What are you gonna call him?
[9122][9165]How about Bernie Kosar?
[10123][10141]What are you doing up?
[10141][10158]I changed my mind.
[10158][10177]About what?
[10177][10208]Look, uh, as much fun|as you are to be around,
[10208][10239]I can't be a prisoner.|Uh, I have to go to school.
[10239][10260]- No. No way, too risky.|- Come on.
[10260][10286]Number Three was completely|off the grid and the Mogs got him.
[10286][10302]- Didn't save him.|- Mm-mm.
[10302][10338]Come on.|I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.
[10338][10353]I promise I'll keep a low profile.
[10353][10375]Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,
[10375][10398]you can't just waltz into school|and start class...
[10398][10437]Do you think you're the only one|who can forge documents?
[10437][10462]Hm. Do you have a...?
[10462][10503]Five days of rations,|spare clothes, GPS, cash.
[10503][10516]- What's your name?|- John Smith.
[10516][10532]- Where are you from?|- Toronto.
[10532][10551]You seem kind of tan for Toronto.
[10551][10614]Santa Fe, New Mexico.|I know the drill, OK?
[10638][10654]You keep this on you.|I'll call you every hour.
[10654][10670]If you don't pick up,|I know something's wrong.
[10670][10703]- Come on, every hour?|- That, or you can home school.
[10703][10734]And I'll be your teacher.
[10734][10749]Fine.
[10749][10788]Hey, John, don't be stupid.|You keep your head down.
[10788][10831]I know how to blend in.
[11029][11044]OK, doll. Take a seat.
[11044][11107]I'll just print up your schedule.|Back in a jiffy.
[11107][11124]I know she's|the star photographer,
[11124][11143]but it's not fair|to the other students.
[11143][11160]She's using up all the vital supplies.
[11160][11199]Emory, come on. "Strangers in|Paradise." At least she's creative.
[11199][11225]The pictures on her website|are totally inappropriate.
[11225][11260]Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep|the photos, you should just say so.
[11260][11285]Keep the photos?|They're already all over the Internet!
[11285][11319]It's a violation to post things like|this without people's permission.
[11319][11333]You have to do something about this.
[11333][11398]Mr. Behrman,|excuse us for a few minutes, OK?
[11433][11467]Sarah, this is not like you.
[11467][11492]Is there something going on?
[11492][11522]- Everything's fine.|- Sarah?
[11522][11560]- Honestly.|- Have a seat.
[11560][11594]You can't let a few negative students|get you down.
[11594][11632]Look, I don't want you to isolate|yourself from the rest of the school.
[11632][11683]- You should enjoy this year.|- OK, I'll try.
[11683][11715]- Good.|- Can I please have my camera back?
[11715][11752]No more photos on your website|without teacher and student permission.
[11752][11769]OK.
[11769][11810]Here's your schedule.
[11821][11859]Homeroom is calculus.|That's B-wing, room seven...
[11859][11918]Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend|to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.
[11918][11963]/Job fair starts tomorrow.|/Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.
[11963][12003]What kind of camera do you use?
[12003][12027]Eavesdropping?|That's not gonna win you friends.
[12027][12057]- Check it out.|- What?
[12057][12093]Tell that to the principal|with a fish tank for an office.
[12093][12131]It's kind of hard not to hear.
[12131][12183]Sorry. This whole place|is kind of a fish tank.
[12183][12208]Well...|Room seven is down the hall,
[12208][12254]and, uh, that's your locker right there.
[12254][12286]Good luck... um...
[12286][12304]Oh, uh, John...
[12304][12333]...Smith.
[12343][12376]OK. You don't want to tell me your name.
[12376][12408]That's fine.
[12455][12509]That's really my name.|John Smith.
[12582][12623]What's up, man? You new?
[12623][12667]Mark James. This is Kevin,|Jackson, Tyler and Max.
[12667][12685]- Hey, man, what's up?|- John.
[12685][12705]Good to meet you, John.|Where are you from?
[12705][12735]- Santa Fe.|- Oh, New Mexico.
[12735][12749]Play any ball out there?
[12749][12775]- Football?|- Yeah.
[12775][12802]- No.|- Play anything?
[12802][12824]Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?
[12824][12849]Nope.
[12849][12885]OK. No, that's cool, man.|That's totally cool.
[12885][12905]We could always use more|boosters in the stands, right?
[12905][12948]Listen. You need anything,|you ask us, OK?
[12948][12979]- We got you.|- I'll keep that in mind.
[12979][13028]Good talking to you, big guy.
[13031][13045]Look who it is.
[13045][13068]Watch out, man.
[13068][13084]Sorry, Sam.
[13084][13110]Loser!
[13149][13161]Wait up, fool.
[13161][13188]Thanks.
[13192][13208]Gotta love the classics.
[13208][13252]Homecoming king versus|the science nerd.
[13252][13277]Just get better with time, don't they?
[13277][13312]- That guy, Mark, he's...|- Soon to be irrelevant.
[13312][13390]He's in the third year of|the best four years of his life.
[13964][14005]So, she was like, "The solar system's|sun does not revolve around the Earth."
[14005][14047]I said, "Yeah, right."
[14054][14068]Hey, Spock!
[14068][14097]- Nailed it!|- Heads up! UFO, brother!
[14097][14120]That had to hurt.
[14120][14138]Hey, stay down, man.|Just stay down.
[14138][14151]He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.
[14151][14199]- Oh, Mommy's coming!|- Oh...
[14199][14222]- Right in the face.|- Hey, are you OK?
[14222][14282]- Assholes.|- Yo, new dude! Little help?
[14360][14379]Jesus!
[14379][14401]I'm fine! Get off me.
[14401][14419]Come on, man!
[14419][14454]- You OK?|- No.
[14477][14504]That's quite an arm|you got there.
[14504][14539]Yeah. Who knew?
[14552][14594]So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?
[14594][14608]I know it's your first day and all,
[14608][14645]but, uh, sooner or later|you'll figure it out.
[14645][14668]Figure what out?
[14668][14737]I'm definitely not the guy|you want to hang with.
[15250][15271]Invisible.
[15271][15291]You heard me|when I said that, right?
[15291][15358]Yeah. Yeah, because|I remember you being there.
[15782][15822]/Let us face,|/without panic, the reality of our times.
[15822][15841]/The fact that atom bombs
[15841][15883]/may, some day, be dropped on our cities.|/And let us prepare for survival
[15883][15904]/by understanding the weapon|/that threatens us.
[15904][15929]Yeah.
[15977][16022]How you settling in, bro?
[16024][16055]- Fine, thanks.|- Good. That's good.
[16055][16089]I see you and Spock are vibing.
[16089][16109]Got a bit of a soft spot|for freaks, do you?
[16109][16143]Who's talking?
[16147][16173]Yikes.
[16177][16218]Look. It's cute, it really is.|You are an adorable young man.
[16218][16240]But I find it irritating,
[16240][16263]so keep it on the bleachers, OK?
[16263][16284]- All right.|- Good. That's good.
[16284][16301]Also, while I'm here,
[16301][16358]I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.
[16473][16511]Find your place fast.|Catch the rest of this flick, OK?
[16511][16564]Jesus, dude.|You are soaking wet.
[16827][16848]John, get up.|Come on. We gotta go.
[16848][16859]John.
[16859][16885]- John.|- My hands. What...?
[16885][16908]- Henri. My hands burn!|- John...
[16908][16928]- Look at me and relax.|- What's happening to me?
[16928][16944]They called them legacies back home.
[16944][16972]You, the nine,|you're the only ones who have them.
[16972][16985]- Legacies?|- That's right.
[16985][17006]Your parents were members|of the Lorien Garde.
[17006][17032]You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.
[17032][17044]- Gifts?|- That's right.
[17044][17062]My hands light up like road flares.
[17062][17088]- And you call that a gift?|- Each legacy has its own function.
[17088][17109]There's...|There's more coming?
[17109][17156]As you breathe and focus,|you're gonna learn to control them.
[17156][17196]- OK. OK.|- Just like you're doing, right now.
[17196][17219]OK?
[17231][17254]How do your hands feel?
[17254][17291]- Better.|- Good.
[17313][17335]So, what now?
[17335][17351]Now?
[17351][17383]We wait. You're gonna keep|growing stronger and faster.
[17383][17400]I need you to be careful.
[17400][17432]Right now, you have to focus|your mind. Get some control.
[17432][17454]When you can do that,|you can get back to school.
[17454][17480]I don't want to raise suspicion.|I still have business here.
[17480][17499]In the meantime, your powers|will only draw attention.
[17499][17523]You keep yourself in check,|you understand?
[17523][17549]So I got all these powers,|but I'm not allowed to use them?
[17549][17577]Exactly.
[18763][18806]A little early for Thanksgiving.
[18806][18843]Paper or plastic?
[19023][19048]Whoa.
[19285][19328]And you wind it here...
[19494][19537]"Strangers in Paradise"?
[19537][19563]I know. Arty, pretentious.
[19563][19586]Uh... That's not actually|what I was gonna say.
[19586][19641]I just needed a name for my website|and it was right there.
[19641][19680]You know, they should've|called this town "Ironic."
[19680][19731]Ironic, Ohio?|Has a ring to it.
[19737][19773]What's up with you?|You look different, or something.
[19773][19792]Sarah, come over!|I got a new bike!
[19792][19819]OK, I will next week.
[19819][19843]- Hold this for a second.|- All right.
[19843][19864]Oh, they're so cute.
[19864][19886]You know, uh... I mean it.
[19886][19902]Uh... Your photographs...
[19902][19927]My parents make me babysit|for film money,
[19927][19970]and those are two of my victims.
[19970][19994]You know, I'm, uh...
[19994][20029]I'm actually trying to|pay you a compliment, but, uh...
[20029][20054]...it's not going so well.
[20054][20076]Oh.
[20076][20108]Right. Um...
[20120][20150]Thank you.
[20151][20209]I don't know, I just, um,|see better through this thing.
[20209][20258]It's like my own|personal BS detector.
[20258][20291]Come on! Let's go!
[20291][20331]Excuse me. Did you forget something?|You had two things to do, you know?
[20331][20354]- Lock the door and turn off the lights!|- That's Sam's dad?
[20354][20365]His stepdad.
[20365][20426]Every night|it's the same thing with you!
[20448][20479]This is it.
[20549][20574]You live here?
[20574][20615]Yeah, I grew up here.
[20643][20693]- It's just a house.|- I know.
[20736][20748]You hungry?
[20748][20782]So, John, just moved|from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.
[20782][20799]- The Smiths, right?|- Uh, yes, sir.
[20799][20830]- And your father's a writer?|- Yes, he is.
[20830][20858]Everybody really does know everything|in this town.
[20858][20883]Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.
[20883][20897]Question game!
[20897][20920]Oh! Sorry, my bad.
[20920][20942]- All right, everybody, surrender them.|- Here you go.
[20942][20976]All electronic devices.|Come on, Sarah. Thank you.
[20976][20988]Hand them over.
[20988][21006]- And you.|- Mom?
[21006][21036]He'll get it back after dinner.|You'll get it back after dinner.
[21036][21062]- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.|- All right.
[21062][21106]So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?|You bored silly here?
[21106][21133]Nah, not with the spring carnival|coming up!
[21133][21163]It's fun, and you and your folks|should definitely come.
[21163][21196]Oh, it's just me and my dad.
[21196][21207]Where's your mom?
[21207][21223]- Uh... My...|- Mom.
[21223][21269]No, it's fine. My dad and mom,|uh, they didn't get married.
[21269][21298]Uh, you know, check it out.|Carnival.
[21298][21323]Sarah will be there|taking pictures for the paper.
[21323][21334]Cheap labor.
[21334][21351]- That is not why.|- No.
[21351][21379]- She's a very talented photographer.|- Question game!
[21379][21411]OK. Keep your voice down,|and we will play.
[21411][21448]It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,|we'd never talk about the good stuff.
[21448][21472]Worst advice you ever got?
[21472][21485]"Pull this."
[21485][21498]Oh, stop!
[21498][21515]That's really gross.
[21515][21527]OK, um...
[21527][21550]"Your parents will never know|you're gone."
[21550][21571]It worked with your folks.|That's how she got here.
[21571][21587]- Stop it. Stop.|- Oh, my God.
[21587][21607]- What?|- OK, Sarah, your turn.
[21607][21655]Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner|looks totally natural.
[21655][21678]She was orange.
[21678][21703]Like a traffic cone.|On picture day.
[21703][21718]Oh, you should go get that picture.
[21718][21731]- We still have the picture!|- John, you are gonna...
[21731][21749]Why would you want|to show him that?
[21749][21773]I shouldn't have said it.
[21773][21816]I think I tore them up.
[21853][21883]Sorry about that.
[21883][21924]- About what?|- My parents.
[21924][21959]They were putting on the|"aren't we cool?" show.
[21959][21976]They seem very proud of you.
[21976][21996]Yeah, and they're already|trying to convince me
[21996][22020]to go to the local community college|in Dayton.
[22020][22051]They'd love it if I stayed here.
[22051][22083]Got into wedding photography.
[22083][22126]What do you want to do?
[22154][22173]That's my favorite.
[22173][22188]It's got all these light leaks
[22188][22231]so the photos come out so interesting.
[22231][22271]Here, I'll show you.
[22347][22369]See that one right there?
[22369][22405]That's what I was talking about.
[22405][22437]What's this?
[22440][22465]Um...
[22468][22522]That is kind of private, actually.
[22540][22573]It's amazing.
[22614][22650]- What?|- You...
[22651][22677]You're allowed|to look at everyone else...
[22677][22759]...take our pictures, but, uh...|we're not allowed to see you?
[22786][22824]OK.|That's enough.
[22839][22858]Seems like you want to run away.
[22858][22879]I'll just be happy|when I can get out of here.
[22879][22897]I don't know.|I've been to a lot of places.
[22897][22923]You don't have to give me the|"there's no place like home" speech.
[22923][22939]I've heard it.
[22939][22975]No, no. You can go wherever you want,|see whatever you want to.
[22975][23048]But a place is only as good|as the people you know in it.
[23048][23076]I, uh...
[23123][23179]I think this is a pretty good place.
[23292][23333]Bernie, you dumb dog.
[23343][23370]- Does he belong to you?|- Yeah. I gotta go.
[23370][23415]Well, hey. Hold on a sec.
[23443][23468]Um...
[23502][23532]Your turn.
[23559][23586]Thanks.
[23724][23740]I'm fine.
[23740][23765]Heard you made quite an impression|in class yesterday.
[23765][23798]Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.|But that class...
[23798][23829]- Boring as hell? Yeah.|- Yeah.
[23829][23871]Look, I know it's none of my business,|but you need to stay off the grid.
[23871][23890]- What do you mean?|- It's all over the school.
[23890][23914]Mark James and his man-tards|have it out for you.
[23914][23935]Sarah may act like one of us...
[23935][23947]...she's one of them.
[23947][23960]He's into Sarah?
[23960][23990]More than that.|Nobody can go near her.
[23990][24007]They were like the town...
[24007][24031]Whoa!
[24031][24045]Loser!
[24045][24092]No... OK, come on...|Oh, God.
[24092][24115]- Sucks to be you, bro!|- Seriously.
[24115][24169]Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!
[24175][24217]I wonder who did that?
[24218][24232]What a loser.
[24232][24267]Leave me alone!
[24277][24310]Ah, ah, ah...
[24334][24375]Did you have a nice time|last night, John?
[24375][24420]You see, in football,|a quarterback needs a few things.
[24420][24436]Speed, strength...
[24436][24473]Mostly, though, you need intuition.
[24473][24518]A feeling when things|are going south.
[24518][24589]First time we talked,|I should've listened to mine.
[24640][24679]There you go, John.
[24688][24716]Good boy.
[24716][24780]Maybe you got some intuition|working for you, too.
[24780][24817]That was awesome.
[24853][24872]Raided lost and found.
[24872][24900]- Nobody loses anything cool.|- You gotta be kidding me.
[24900][24943]Dude, it was that or the /Hannah|/Montana sweatshirt. You got off easy.
[24943][24972]So, uh...
[24973][25010]...who's in the picture?|- My dad.
[25010][25043]The real one.
[25139][25167]/Where was that taken?
[25167][25201]Mexico. The Yucatán.
[25201][25248]We used to go every year looking|for evidence of ancient astronauts.
[25248][25264]Ancient astronauts?
[25264][25294]Yeah. UFOs and shit.
[25294][25315]Freak show stuff.
[25315][25342]He called himself an anthropologist...
[25342][25395]/He was really just a foreman|/at the steel mill.
[25395][25448]/He spent all his time preparing|/for some kind of alien arrival.
[25448][25465]I used to think he was a genius.
[25465][25494]Had to, I guess.
[25494][25556]Nobody wants to admit|their dad's a freak.
[25669][25687]Sam...
[25687][25711]Sam.
[25740][25763]Oh!
[26831][26885]Malcolm, what were you up to here?
[27648][27707]Jimmy, Vince,|come on, slow down, boys!
[27909][27949]- Hey, Sarah.|- Hey!
[28061][28123]Mark James decided to fire|a warning shot about you.
[28123][28166]When you first meet somebody,|do you dump all your stuff on them?
[28166][28200]All your mistakes, your secrets?
[28200][28246]Look, Mark and I, we changed.
[28246][28265]I got into photography,
[28265][28309]and he wanted me to be|his own personal cheerleader.
[28309][28345]Said I was becoming a total snob.
[28345][28379]And when we broke up,|that's what he told everybody.
[28379][28434]That I was a total bitch.|And everyone listened.
[28434][28469]All my friends.
[28489][28516]Uh... I'm sorry.
[28516][28557]I'm not. I mean, I was...
[28557][28579]...but, um, I don't know,
[28579][28611]I kinda look at it like a total gift.
[28611][28644]Got away from all of that.
[28644][28716]So, uh, what's the hottest attraction|at this place?
[28756][28783]You gotta be kidding me, right?|This...
[28783][28819]Don't be scared.
[29006][29041]/Save yourself.
[29221][29250]Last year, she was drawn and quartered.
[29250][29285]It was awesome.
[29307][29334]My God.
[29441][29464]Hell's Gate.
[29464][29498]Everybody off.
[29699][29716]Quite a production.
[29716][29751]Hm. Small town.
[29879][29927]OK. The last part got to me.
[29929][29962]What is that?
[29965][29986]Don't! Let him go! Let him go!
[29986][30014]Stop it!
[30033][30059]Hello?
[30064][30107]Was that real? Are you all right?
[30107][30128]Let me go! Stop it!
[30128][30164]Leave him alone!
[30367][30387]- No!|- Whoa! Calm down.
[30387][30418]- Oh, my God. Just get off me!|- Sarah, come here!
[30418][30445]- Idiot! It's you!|- Calm down! Calm down!
[30445][30468]- Let go of me.|- You can take off, OK?
[30468][30498]- Let go of me! Let go of me!|- Hey, listen. I will. I will!
[30498][30524]Sarah!
[30649][30669]Where is she?
[30669][30687]It burns, man!
[30687][30719]Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!
[30719][30796]She's at Shepherd Falls!|Dude, put me down. What is that?
[30801][30812]Where's John?
[30812][30844]I don't get what happened to us.|I don't. I really don't.
[30844][30867]So you have your friend|throw me over his shoulder,
[30867][30887]drag me through the woods|to come here,
[30887][30928]when all you had to do is ask me!|Like a normal person!
[30928][30966]You don't have to tell me|I'm being an asshole, OK?
[30966][30998]But you're a problem for me, Sarah.
[30998][31029]Yeah, well, you really|should get over that.
[31029][31071]- Wait. Sarah, wait.|- Just stop it!
[31071][31098]You OK?
[31210][31235]I hope you can throw|with your left hand.
[31235][31276]No, John, stop! Stop!
[31388][31412]John. John, stop. Wait.
[31412][31443]Hey. I just didn't want you|to break his arm.
[31443][31467]It's not you, it's me.|I shouldn't have lost it like that.
[31467][31491]Hey.
[31508][31550]Will you walk me home?
[31616][31654]You should really get that looked at.
[31654][31680]I will.
[31680][31708]I, uh...
[31753][31796]I think we should talk.
[31803][31842]I know. It's crazy.
[31844][31859]Mark is insane.
[31859][31889]And this is our last year.
[31889][31909]Who knows where you'll be|in three months?
[31909][31937]Exactly.
[31944][31974]Who knows?
[31981][32010]So, I guess I'll just...
[32010][32041]...see you when I see you?
[32041][32066]Yeah.
[32080][32103]OK.
[32162][32206]Your hand's really warm.
[32349][32369]All I think about is you.
[32369][32419]All I think about is you, too.
[32634][32677]Where did you come from?
[32677][32722]All right, Mom! I got it!
[32787][32838]- I, uh...|- Yeah, I should go.
[32905][32929]Bye.
[33501][33535]John! In here.
[33561][33598]So, what are you?
[33603][33635]You threw those football players|around like it was nothing.
[33635][33675]And the hand thing?|That's not human.
[33675][33727]So I'm asking you, what are you?
[33734][33750]Do I need to threaten you?
[33750][33775]All right, 'cause I got|some pictures on my phone,
[33775][33789]and they're gonna start|some major questions.
[33789][33809]- Give me that.|- No.
[33809][33857]You know I can hurt you. Hm?
[33998][34037]Knock yourself out.
[34092][34133]My entire childhood...
[34133][34179]...has been an episode of /X- Files.
[34179][34215]You know what it's like|to feel something...
[34215][34243]...so strong...
[34243][34263]...that every day you have|to keep telling yourself
[34263][34295]your dad's gonna come back|and take you away from this shithole.
[34295][34322]And that everything|we believed in was true.
[34322][34369]And that we were not crazy.
[34391][34418]Please.
[34455][34482]Please.
[34507][34537]Your dad was right.
[34537][34562]What?
[34611][34644]He was right.
[34650][34682]About ancient astronauts...
[34682][34729]...life on other planets...
[34731][34764]...all of it.
[34788][34824]Yes! I knew... I knew he|wouldn't just leave us!
[34824][34864]I mean, they found his truck near the|border of Mexico, and he was just gone.
[34864][34882]- Maybe they took him.|- Sam...
[34882][34906]If he knew you were here,|he'd come home.
[34906][34940]- You can't tell anyone.|- No, I-I-I wouldn't.
[34940][34962]No, no, no. You gotta promise me.|Nobody knows this.
[34962][35005]There are others from where I'm from|looking for me.
[35005][35028]I'm not safe.
[35028][35089]Sam! I know you are in there.|Get your ass in the house, now!
[35089][35103]Wait until I get inside and then go.
[35103][35127]Sam?
[35141][35171]I promise.
[35179][35203]Yes!
[35236][35264]Come on.
[35397][35416]Hey, you maniac.
[35416][35480]- Hello, son.|- Hey, what's with the, uh...?
[35494][35505]Hello, Dad.
[35505][35526]Sheriff James says|some boys got hurt last night.
[35526][35548]Couple of them|spent the night in the hospital.
[35548][35563]- You said it was four?|- Yeah, four.
[35563][35594]- On the football team.|- Yeah, that's right.
[35594][35654]Of course, none of them are talking.|That includes my own boy, Mark.
[35654][35696]- Your son is Mark?|- Yeah, that's right.
[35696][35717]You know, that was his|throwing arm that got hurt.
[35717][35760]He said you were there.
[35760][35785]Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.
[35785][35826]So I wasn't paying any attention.|Um...
[35826][35857]Sarah Hart?
[35873][35920]Well, no one wants to be the first|one to say what really happened.
[35920][35955]But, eventually, someone will.
[35955][35983]I'm sure you're right.|Thank you, Sheriff.
[35983][36043]If we hear anything,|we'll let you know.
[36209][36251]- Four of them, huh?|- Yeah.
[36251][36278]Was it difficult?
[36278][36299]Piece of cake.
[36299][36325]Good. Means you're getting it.
[36325][36346]Go upstairs, pack your stuff.
[36346][36361]Because of last night?
[36361][36387]Because I don't like people|showing up asking questions.
[36387][36418]- And I think this is gonna raise a few.|- "They walk among us."
[36418][36438]What is this? Some more|"truth is out there" freaks?
[36438][36467]Except that's actually you.
[36467][36490]One of the kids must|have caught you on video.
[36490][36504]Oh, shit.
[36504][36525]/He's some kind of freak!
[36525][36539]I can't get through the firewall.
[36539][36557]We have to go there|and take it down ourselves.
[36557][36579]Mogs see this, just a matter of time.
[36579][36616]Pack your stuff. We're leaving.
[36616][36647]I'm not going.
[36647][36677]I'm sorry, what did you say?
[36677][36694]I'm not going.
[36694][36727]OK. If you want to pick|the next place, that's fine...
[36727][36744]It's not my fight and it never was!
[36744][36768]I can't even remember|a world before this one.
[36768][36787]Wait, wait...
[36787][36828]...is this because of a girl?
[36828][36860]Go upstairs and get your stuff.
[36860][36893]- You're not my father.|- No, no, no. He's dead.
[36893][36922]He died for you.|In fact, you know what?
[36922][36961]You have no idea how many others|have made sacrifices so you could live!
[36961][36977]And it wasn't so you could come here
[36977][36999]and experience puppy love|like a real live boy!
[36999][37035]I'm not leaving.
[37044][37073]John... John!
[37073][37099]I'm not leaving!
[37099][37147]Oh, yeah, I can do that now.
[37197][37227]Hey, John!
[37319][37354]I'm letting go, OK?
[37354][37385]- OK?|- OK.
[37482][37513]- On our planet...|- Just tell me why they want to kill me.
[37513][37559]The Mogs, they don't colonize.|They decimate. And then they move on.
[37559][37586]And now, they've moved here.
[37586][37636]There are few forces that can stop them.|You and the other five can.
[37636][37653]You were saved for a bigger purpose.
[37653][37690]I'm not gonna let you throw that away|for a girl.
[37690][37732]She's not just a girl.
[37740][37768]I think about leaving her...
[37768][37788]...but I can't.
[37788][37829]And I don't know why.
[37852][37925]We don't love like the humans.|With us, it's forever.
[37932][37969]You never forget.
[37975][38020]If she is that for you,|then don't let them win.
[38020][38073]Or you'll never forgive yourself.
[38075][38099]Now, we have to go.
[38099][38126]I'll take care of the website tonight.|Buy you a day.
[38126][38165]A day? To say goodbye?
[38165][38221]That's more than the rest of us had.
[38372][38417]/He's some kind of freak!
[38497][38545]Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.
[38564][38590]Henri?
[38787][38815]Henri? Hello? Henri?
[38815][38862]/No, but come here|/and I'll tell you how to find him.
[38862][38881]Who are you? Where's Henri?
[38881][38938]/417 Willard Court,|/Warsaw, Indiana.
[39018][39041]Come on, come on.
[39041][39078]I need your help.
[39108][39127]So, you guys... you guys don't...
[39127][39151]- Abduct people?|- Yeah.
[39151][39161]No.
[39161][39197]But the other guys,|the ones that are chasing you...
[39197][39228]...they do?
[39422][39452]That's it.
[39456][39483]Thanks.
[39547][39573]Whoa! You brought a gun?
[39573][39603]I stole it from Ed.|It might come in handy. Let's go.
[39603][39638]- No.|- Dude, I came here to help you.
[39638][39681]You have. Now, go home.
[39856][39881]Whoa!
[39899][39921]- What are you doing?|- I'm not bailing.
[39921][39978]What if these Mog people took my dad?
[40259][40289]Holy shit!
[40304][40340]But you just dead-bolted it.
[40340][40368]- OK. New plan.|- Yeah.
[40368][40399]You follow that guy and you|text me if he comes back, OK?
[40399][40440]Copy that. I'm on it.
[41360][41386]Henri.
[41515][41533]- Are you OK?|- You're not supposed to be here.
[41533][41555]- What happened?|- The Mogs set this up.
[41555][41584]We need to leave. They're coming.
[41584][41614]Everybody stays right where they are|or I'll shoot this kid.
[41614][41640]I'll do it!|Get your hands up!
[41640][41667]So glad you brought the gun.
[41667][41694]You're Malcolm's boy.
[41694][41771]- Get the lights, will you?|- Shut up! Get your hands up!
[41785][41808]Oh!
[41847][41883]You! You're the one|from the video on our site.
[41883][41914]- The one they're after.|- The one who's after?
[41914][41942]- What's he talking about?|- The Mogs, they've been here.
[41942][41956]- This was a trap.|- Yeah.
[41956][41991]These dudes, whatever they are, man,|they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?
[41991][42014]- John...|- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.
[42014][42044]Nobody gives a crap what I say.|But this is real, man!
[42044][42059]John. It's time to leave.
[42059][42096]They like it here, Earth. They're gonna|take all this shit, everything!
[42096][42110]John! Now!
[42110][42131]We either do what they say|or we are all gonna die.
[42131][42172]It's time to go! Now!
[42315][42356]John. John! John, no!
[42691][42710]John, go!
[42710][42742]- Now!|- Go!
[42986][43012]Start the car.|Come on! Get us out of here!
[43012][43029]- I can't find the keys!|- What do you mean?
[43029][43063]- I can't find the keys!|- Come on! Come on!
[43063][43104]Guys, what are we waiting for?
[43104][43123]- I've lost the keys!|- John, start the engine.
[43123][43182]- What?|- You can do it. Start the car.
[43182][43229]- Come on.|- Start the car.
[43272][43295]Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!|He's coming! He's coming!
[43295][43309]Start the car! Start the car!
[43309][43353]Use your magic powers!|Come on! We are so dead!
[43353][43384]Oh, my God!
[43418][43456]Go! Drive the car!
[43557][43591]You take this.
[43627][43652]Malcolm was using it|to track the others.
[43652][43685]- Wait. So, my dad was...|- He was helping us.
[43685][43725]He was supposed to bring us together.
[43725][43748]You need to find the others.
[43748][43801]Together you'll be more powerful.
[43888][43929]I can't do this without you.
[43929][43958]Yes, you can.
[43958][43991]Yes, you can.
[43996][44056]You have no idea|what you're capable of.
[44098][44124]Henri.
[44668][44699]Just let me talk.
[44699][44745]OK. So, I called you like you said.
[44745][44786]I mean, it's not my fault they got...
[44786][44807]I mean, we held up our end.
[44807][44832]- Hm.|- We're still in?
[44832][44866]The whole new world order thing?
[44866][44898]The Locator.
[44907][44934]- Where is it?|- OK.
[44934][44989]All he had was a knife and that rock.
[44989][45020]And I put it...
[45020][45065]- It was over there, man.|- "It was over there, man."
[45065][45108]But it's not there now.
[45308][45350]Cartoons for children.
[45351][45377]Where I'm from, men have to work.
[45377][45397]Look, I'll work hard.
[45397][45434]The disregard that so many of you|have for practical matters,
[45434][45472]it's... beautiful.
[45480][45521]I think we should|all have some fun. Huh?
[45521][45567]Gadgets.|You call them "toys for boys."
[45567][45585]I have a gadget.
[45585][45624]- Would you like to play with it?|- Uh... No, no. I...
[45624][45670]It wants to play with you!
[45805][45818]Need to talk to you.
[45818][45838]Any idea where|I might find your friend?
[45838][45865]He's not who you think he is.
[45865][45895]Excuse me?
[45938][45954]/The Paradise Sheriff's Department
[45954][45971]/raided the home of two suspects,
[45971][46000]/seizing computers|/and several suspicious items.
[46000][46068]/An APB has been issued on|/the suspects and anyone with...
[46068][46101]We need to get out of here.
[46101][46118]There's a news thing.
[46118][46195]The cops think you and Henri|are criminals or terrorists.
[46257][46294]We're going back.
[46305][46325]I'm outside of|the home here in Warsaw
[46325][46358]where the mutilated bodies of|two paranormal website operators
[46358][46378]were just found a few hours ago.
[46378][46397]The police are not saying|if they have any leads
[46397][46421]or even why these|brutal murders occurred.
[46421][46480]Police have no suspects|at this time...
[46552][46567]- I have one of those!|- What?
[46567][46595]One of those.|I took it from my dad's stash.
[46595][46617]- I need you to get it.|- Yeah, yeah.
[46617][46653]Let me off at Linndale.|Sarah's at a house up there.
[46653][46673]I'll call you after.
[46673][46748]- And then what?|- Then I get the rock and you go home.
[46807][46835]- It's him.|- John?
[46835][46884]- Did you see that?|- What's he doing here?
[46884][46920]Yeah, he's here.
[46942][46973]That's him!
[47118][47146]Come on.
[47149][47177]Come on.
[47390][47445]Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.
[47445][47476]Not so sure who my|kind of crowd is right now.
[47476][47503]- Look, just...|- John Smith?
[47503][47536]I'm such an idiot.
[47536][47569]And they're saying that your dad|is some kind of terrorist.
[47569][47596]He's not a terrorist.
[47596][47620]Tell me the truth.
[47620][47652]Who are you?
[47746][47768]He's upstairs.
[47768][47805]All right, guys, out of the way.
[47805][47837]You didn't answer my question.
[47837][47853]I just came to say goodbye.
[47853][47873]- John, wait! What are you... No, John!|- Don't move!
[47873][47899]Sarah!
[47989][48000]How...
[48000][48039]- Move! Move!|- Go!
[48172][48189]That was awesome!
[48189][48216]Whoa...
[48279][48299]What you did is not possible.
[48299][48315]Who I am...
[48315][48335]...it's all in here.|I took these for you.
[48335][48382]Wait. Come with me.|Please.
[48382][48406]Any idea where they'd be?
[48406][48460]I think I know|where she might go.
[48531][48598]- Who the hell are they?|- Big-ass linebackers?
[48648][48680]Holy shit...
[48710][48741]No, no, no!
[48755][48779]Dad!
[48891][48930]An alcohol-fuelled|young guy like you...
[48930][48969]...healthy and well-fed.
[48969][49006]I bet you watch a lot of television,|don't you? Do you? Do you?
[49006][49028]- Yeah.|- Yeah.
[49028][49054]In this situation here,|you're probably thinking,
[49054][49087]"Maybe I could save the day.|Maybe I could be the hero."
[49087][49130]But I say... don't do that.
[49130][49153]OK?
[49163][49213]Tell me now, where is the boy?
[49472][49512]These are beautiful.
[49643][49679]Can you show me?
[49937][49972]- No!|- Get in!
[50002][50043]Let me go! Let me go!
[50085][50118]Let go of me!
[50173][50192]- Hello?|- Where are you?
[50192][50204]I'm at the high school.
[50204][50222]/Yeah, you need to get out of there now.
[50222][50232]Why? What's happening?
[50232][50261]Your stunt with the car|is already on YouTube.
[50261][50276]/If they're not right on your ass now,
[50276][50299]/they will be soon.
[50299][50312]Come on.
[50312][50335]And don't tell me this is not my fight.
[50335][50386]My dad probably knew those guys were|coming and that's why they took him.
[50386][50424]And also, I have your dog.
[50424][50436]/Look, I'm on my way.
[50436][50452]/I'll meet you out front of the school.
[50452][50476]/You've got to get out now.
[50476][50493]/John?
[50493][50519]/John!
[50549][50578]Let's go.
[50599][50632]Let go of me!
[50671][50696]Jesus!
[50696][50735]Sarah! If you're in there, run!
[50735][50759]Run!
[50798][50828]Let me go!
[50886][50915]Listen to me. I'm not gonna|let them hurt you, OK?
[50915][50965]Do you understand me?|Come on.
[51680][51733]Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you|kept your heroics off the Internet.
[51733][51776]- Who are you?|- Number Six. Where's your protector?
[51776][51811]- Dead.|- Yeah. Mine, too.
[51811][51826]Mogs got her four months ago.
[51826][51852]- We've been tracking them down.|- Tracking them?
[51852][51875]Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.
[51875][51897]You should be watching your own ass.
[51897][51921]Mogs have all the exits covered.
[51921][51952]Looks like you're gonna|have to fight to get out.
[51952][51974]- Are you game?|- Yeah.
[51974][51999]There's a tunnel under the school|that leads to the stadium.
[51999][52047]Oh, you made friends.|How nice.
[52047][52073]Let's go.
[52073][52100]Got any other legacies|I should know about?
[52100][52131]Stay tuned.
[52437][52466]Oh, shit.
[52536][52565]Oh, shit!
[52648][52679]Careful, they'll see us.
[52679][52739]And you're going|to need all your energy.
[52739][52770]- What was that?|- They're comin'.
[52770][52795]Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[52795][52820]Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?
[52820][52835]Did you see what just|flew out of that truck?
[52835][52857]And your dog just shape-shifted|into one of them.
[52857][52909]I thought he was gonna eat me.|Here's your rock.
[52909][52958]Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?
[52958][52971]Jane Doe.
[52971][52985]That's cool. It's cool.
[52985][52998]So, are you a number, too?
[52998][53029]- Who is this tool?|- Sam, focus.
[53029][53076]What flew out of the truck?
[53096][53122]Come on! Go, go!
[53122][53159]Sam. Come on! Go!
[53198][53235]Come on! Come on!
[53247][53275]Come on!
[53870][53894]Ahh!
[53958][53981]- Hit me.|- What?
[53981][54028]With your lumen.|I need to power-up.
[54028][54055]Hit me!
[54151][54193]Red Bull's for pussies.
[54193][54241]He killed Henri. I want him.
[54531][54554]Ah!
[54580][54605]Four!
[54716][54738]You're good with your hands.
[54738][54772]- Thanks.|- No problem.
[54772][54816]- My dog, he, uh... he just...|- Yeah, he's a chimera.
[54816][54838]He came with you from Lorien.
[54838][54888]Someone had to look after you.
[55493][55514]You brought a gun?|Are you serious?
[55514][55577]- What? It might come in handy.|- This way.
[55646][55669]Go!
[55746][55815]- Take her back to the tunnel!|- Got it! Come on!
[55836][55873]- Holy...!|- Ahh!
[55904][55945]I play a lot of Xbox.
[55980][56003]Oh!
[56193][56221]Oh! Ahh!
[56913][56972]Number Four, I think you|have something I need. Hm?
[56972][57016]Oh, thank you for making|this so nice and easy.
[57016][57076]Think of how quickly we'll finish off|the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!
[57076][57103]Soon, I'll be done with all of you.
[57103][57134]Just relax.
[57139][57178]You can't stop what's coming.|You never could.
[57178][57199]You have...
[57199][57232]...no idea...
[57235][57278]...what I'm capable of.
[57412][57435]Ah!
[57995][58020]John.
[58039][58068]Fireproof?
[58068][58113]I told you to stay tuned.
[58380][58410]All right, give me that.|Come on.
[58410][58440]Thank you.
[58733][58774]Oh. Well, that was disappointing.|So, not a tracking device?
[58774][58795]No, it was.
[58795][58820]- Did you feel that, too?|- Yeah.
[58820][58902]- We know where we need to go.|- Yeah, we can find the others.
[58914][58954]- Here.|- Thank you.
[58956][58974]I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.
[58974][59020]Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence|all the time.
[59020][59044]My dad won't even know.
[59044][59074]- You want to be heading west now.|- Why?
[59074][59134]Because I told my dad you're going east.
[59178][59228]- Six, Sam's coming with us.|- What?
[59228][59246]- No way.|- He's one of us now.
[59246][59293]We need to find his father.
[59305][59339]You slow us down,|I'll shoot you myself.
[59339][59394]And I believe you.|Could we go now?
[59424][59446]You know, I wouldn't leave|if it wasn't, uh...
[59446][59474]- Safer.|- Yeah.
[59474][59501]I know.
[59502][59539]Really sorry about|what happened with Henri.
[59539][59567]Me, too.
[59590][59638]You know I'll find you again.
[59638][59681]Probably still be here.
[59681][59704]It's the people that make the place.
[59704][59740]- Right?|- Yeah.
[59791][59852]Henri warned me that|we only fall for one person.
[59852][59875]Ever?
[59875][59900]Ever.
[60817][60855]/This is the first town|/I've left without Henri.
[60855][60904]/But it's also the first one|/I have a reason to come back to.
[60904][60944]/Henri was right,|/we're stronger together.
[60944][60992]/So we will find the others.
[60993][61049]/My planet is called Lorien,|/but Earth is my home now.
[61049][61087]/It's as good a place|/as any in the universe.
[61087][61142]/And that's how it's going to stay.
MAN:
What? He slipped and fell?
- 1337, wasn't it?
- You think he'll be okay?
MASTER CHIEF: This kind of thing happens to him all the time.
Well, 1337 is still a Spartan.
He's been trained with the best of them.
There's no need for concern.
MAN:
If you say so, Master Chief.
It wouldn't be the first time he fell off a Pelican.
- But still, I am a little worried.
MASTER CHIEF: Yeah.
Oh, no.
Hey! Wait for me! Come back!
Don't leave me behind!
I'm gonna have to rendezvous with them somewhere.
Huh?
I wonder if these natives are dangerous?
Hey, look at that.
It's the junky old robot that fell.
Ha-ha-ha. I am not some junky robot.
Even if you don't wanna know,
I'll tell you who I am.
I am one of the strongest warriors in space.
I am Spartan-1337.
- I wouldn't stand there if I were you.
- It's not safe.
1337: How dare they ignore my awesome heroism.
Fear not. I am the strongest warrior in the... Oh, no.
[1337 GRUNTING]
I'm fine. That was just a few dents.
[1337 GROANING & GRUNTING]
He doesn't really get along with strangers all that much.
[GROANING]
ALIEN 1: So where is the accursed group of Spartans?
ALIEN 2 [ON RADIO]: On Cronkee, the fourth planet of the Unicon system.
ALIEN 1: Excellent.
This is the perfect opportunity...
...to show those Spartans a thing or two about Covenant power.
- Bring out Pluton.
- Yes, sir.
ALIEN 1: Yes. It is the finest bio-warrior ever created.
Now go to the planet Cronkee and demonstrate our might.
ALIEN 2: But Pluton's weapons are still in the experimental stage.
They'll be enough to vanquish the humans.
Don't you think a real battle will be the best way...
...to conduct our little test?
If that is your wish.
I will get you at long last, Master Chief.
Now go, Pluton!
PLUTON: Guh.
- Not "guh." Go destroy them!
[GROWLING]
No, not over here.
- He's over that way. He's over there!
- Huh?
Don't "huh" me. Go that way.
[PLUTON GROWLING]
I need a vacation.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
1337: Chief, respond please.
Can you hear me? Chief? Over.
There's some strange interference.
- Hello? Can you hear me?
BOY 1: We can hear you.
1337: Not you. And I thought I told you to stop following me.
BOY 1: Robot, look.
- I told you I'm not a robot.
What's that?
BOY 2: Sure is a lot of junk falling from the sky today.
[ROARING]
Covenant? It's dangerous.
Get out of here!
- As far as you can.
BOY 1: Okay.
[ROARING]
[KIDS SCREAMING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
Chief, this... Stop it. Stop it.
[ROARING]
[SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
Are you guys all right?
- Hey, look. It's big brother.
BOY 2: And big sister.
Any of you know what that thing is?
It looks like he almost blew up the mountain range.
He fell from the sky. All of a sudden, he and this giant monkey started going nuts.
BROTHER: Don't worry.
Your big brother is gonna take care of it.
Yeah. Well, he might be a little tougher than you think.
We don't have much choice.
We'll just have to try our best.
SISTER:
Yeah, you might lose.
BROTHER: Why would you say that?
Give me some credit, will you?
It must have been scary.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm kind of hungry.
[LAUGHS]
BROTHER:
All right, let's do this.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
I'm not gonna lose. No way can I lose.
I am Spartan-1337.
No one else will say it, so I will.
The fact that I never give up is one of my good points!
Hey, look. The rain stopped.
The robot's back.
What's that?
BROTHER: Apparently they used to travel between the stars with that.
1337: An old UNSC frigate.
Must've crash-landed.
SISTER:
I hear that we were all born inside there.
BROTHER:
Mama raised us all by herself.
Mama?
You kids should stay behind.
This is my fight.
BROTHER: Don't worry about it. We may not look it, but we're pretty tough.
SISTER:
Though, we're no match for Mama.
Mama, huh?
BROTHER: When we were still little she fought off a bunch...
...of bird-headed pirates by herself.
That sounds like one heck of a mama.
But you know what?
I'm one heck of a mama myself.
[BROTHER & SISTER GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
[ALL PANTING]
I did it.
I did it!
BROTHER: Oh, no. We'll be done for if he reaches full strength.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah, and that's gonna be the hard part.
Less talk, more action.
Ah!
[SISTER SCREAMING]
[BOTH SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
This isn't good. He won't budge.
SISTER:
We're totally screwed.
BROTHER:
What else can we do?
We're doomed.
BROTHER & SISTER:
Well, don't jinx us!
I'm just kidding.
We gotta do something.
Hey, what the heck is that?
BROTHER:
Oh, as if he'd ever fall for that.
SISTER:
He did fall for it.
1337: He did? He did.
Now let's get out of here.
[ROARING]
[BEEPING]
[ROARING]
Whoa. What's happening?
[BLEEPING]
No way.
Ah!
Is that a Slipspace rupture?
[BEEP]
Ah!
That was Mama.
SISTER:
I told you, no one was as tough as Mama.
MAN: Master Chief, radio contact has been reestablished.
MASTER CHIEF:
Good. I'll try to contact 1337.
There's another Al living on this planet.
MASTER CHIEF: What?
- I've lost contact with it.
But I'm pretty sure I felt it just tinkering with the Slipspace drive.
She's another Al it seems. Just like I am.
MASTER CHIEF:
Why here?
- You want me to collect her?
- No. Let's not do that.
It's a very old Al construct.
You might say something of an antique.
- She seems...
- Seems what?
Happy. If I'm understanding correctly, she seems to be happy here. Hm.
MASTER CHIEF:
Hm.
BROTHER & SISTER:
We're home.
MAMA: Were you playing as cavemen again? You really do like that game.
BOY 1: Mama, you're not gonna believe what happened today.
MAMA: All right, all right.
You can tell me all about that later.
BROTHER:
Mama, just what did you do back there?
MAMA:
That's not important right now.
By the way, dinner is ready.
GIRL: I'm hungry.
MAMA: I thought so.
- Now go wash your hands.
KIDS: Okay.
MAMA:
And clean behind your ears.
Mama.
CHIEF [ON RADIO]:
Can you hear me, 1337? Come in, 1337.
This is 1337. I hear you clearly, sir.
Head to the rendezvous point immediately.
Rendezvous ASAP, over.
Huh? Roger that, sir, but I may run a little late!
[PLUTON GRUNTING]
[ENGLISH SDH]
[ENGLISH SDH]
PLUTON:
Guh.
Close your eyes.
Close em.
See how many you gotta go through... to get a good one?
Are you ready?
No.
You can see what?
Who's?
Not till Monday.
Whose is it?
I don't know a grip, a gaffer, somebody's foot, a shadow of it.
I can't, I can't... okay well if I can see it then they can see it too.
If they can't do it,
I mean how many times are you going to go around this?
Hire a new team.
What's the problem?
It has been a while.
I'm sorry about that but your work is just amazing.
When we saw your take on it everyone instantly knew we'd gone to the right place.
I just have a few questions for you.
Taking the yellow soil
This was my daily work
What is it?
Do you have more?
My friends, though.
No, no.
Stay awake.
You feel refreshed?
Is there any food?
All the food is poisoned.
Your throat is parched.
Make a pitcher of ice water, bring a small glass.
You can leave the tile.
The rest of the floor will support your weight now.
I have to apologize.
I was born with a disfigurement where my head is made of the same material as the sun.
It makes it impossible for you to look directly at me.
It has always been this way.
The water before you is somehow special.
When you drink it you feel revived and full of energy.
It is better than anything you've ever tasted.
Take a drink now.
There are two approaching armies, hunger and fatigue, but a great wall keeps them at bay.
The wall extends to the sky and will stay up until I say otherwise.
Each drink is better than the last, leaving you with the desire to have one more.
Take a drink now.
The next drink must be earned and I'm going to tell you how.
Focus closely on my instructions.
I will ask you to repeat them from memory.
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand.
The water has lost its appeal.
It doesn't seem as enticing as before.
You have no craving for it.
Kris I just got a call.
It's your mother.
She says she's been taken by several men.
Oh no.
She says they won't let her go unless you pay them.
No...
Oh no. Do you have any money?
No I don't.
I'm sorry.
Can you think of anything?
She sounds brave but I think they're hurting her.
Mom...
I have the house.
You own the house?
I own part of it.
I could, maybe I could...
What's the equity?
Is that enough?
In coins?
Coins?
Five thousand.
Forty-five hundred.
Three thousand.
Weather is beautiful.
You feel like walking a bit so you park a block away.
Did I hand you back your card?
There we are.
Current balance is at the bottom.
Please allow 3-4 business days for availability of funds.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
No thank you, that's it.
Thank you for stopping in
Ms. Fischer, have a great...
Yes ma'am, how may I help you?
Who can I speak to about a home equity line of credit?
I can help you with that.
My name is Marie, please have a seat.
Oh I love your scarf.
Over... and under, through and now you're white.
Crown me.
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand
Kris, the wall has crumbled, fallen down.
It won't come out.
And did you try anybody else?
Because I spoke to Shelly and she does not remember talking to you.
Yes, it was a voicemail, I left a voicemail.
Where's Roth today?
Why isn't he telling me himself?
He couldn't be here today and that's now what we're...
I had the flu, okay?
I had a 106 degree temperature.
That's not... that's not my signature.
I didn't... it's not...
And here's a deposit slip from September.
Yeah, that's my handwriting.
This is different obviously.
So we do all their printing and their literature.
It's just a small school district but, this is the address right here, so if you ever need any printing, signage, just come in or call.
I don't need... I never in a million years would I ever...
I don't need any signage.
This is you, Kris?
Yeah, that's me.
Okay.
Umm...
I'll call.
I'm not going to call for signage though, right?
I don't need any signage.
Okay, Kris?
Okay, Jeff.
Uh, hey... it was good meeting you.
I called you.
I can't do this every day.
This makes me late for work.
You're four trains after me.
So you're going to have to answer if I call.
I'm going to call. Again.
I picked up an MBA.
That's what the, that's what the firm does.
It has a commercial half, the other side's personal wealth.
Where is it?
It's, you can actually see it.
It's a high rise.
The Palomar Building, C&L Crowne, that's us.
Why do you take the train?
Why do I take the train?
Yes, it's just everyone that takes the train is either homeless or had their license revoked or you know.
Do you want to see my driver's license?
No.
That's a gift for us.
See there's this path forward where I wait to tell you and you either use it as an excuse or maybe you don't but, I don't know.
I was diagnosed about a year ago and I take these and I take those and it's fine.
It seems fine.
It seems fine to me.
So there's that, and...
I think I saved us both three to four weeks.
Alright.
Thank you.
I'm going to get the check and we can...
...get out of here.
I'm sorry.
That was stupid.
I don't know what I'm meant to say to that.
What do I say to that?
I don't know.
Why don't I-I'll tell you something and then you, you don't care at all do you?
It's not- yeah alright.
Before we pass this trash I'm going to tell you something.
Um...
I am divorced.
That's not good right?
It's not great.
Yeah.
Where's Michel?
We have clients with ten times this revenue that don't have near the tax liability you do.
So we can have another conversation about how screwed up the code is, or you can take the charge against and solve it.
Does your wife take any medications?
No.
Does she have any health problems?
Asthma.
Just want to say that I hope today's better.
I made a list of the things
I want to try harder at.
I love you.
Those are just words, they don't fix anything Jill.
It's not a short I'm going to the store to get some more.
Wait a second.
I'm on the way out the door.
I just want to tell you I hope today is better.
And that I love you.
Damn it Jill those are just, those are words.
They don't mean anything.
Not now Jillian.
I want this to be a good day.
Just leave me alone.
I love you.
I think you were right about a lot of things.
I love you.
I want today to be peaceful.
Damn it Jill, this is worthless.
Ben.
Now you want to talk?
I'm way out the door Jill.
I just want to say that...
...I hope today is better.
And that I love you.
I want to believe you.
Hey, while I'm at it I'll pick up that filter.
Is it alright that I have that there?
You going to fall down if you don't have it there?
Yeah, maybe.
See this woman here with the knitting?
She's a, she's a former Senator, right?
Like a Nobel winner, but her category is mittens.
So she, she rides... what?
You lost me.
Just got a little too...
Little?
[Kris÷ Little cute, yeah.
I don't know.
What do you have in mind?
Alright, how about that guy?
Tell me about him.
He's divorced.
Yeah, yep.
Because she cheated.
No?
No. Oh, he did.
He cheated.
No. What was it?
Alcoholic.
Some substance of some kind.
The illegal kind.
I would think that there's some marriages that could survive something like that maybe.
Maybe, but...
Not yours?
Not ours, no.
From her perspective.
I mean everything just flipped, you know.
The guy she thought she married turned out to be somebody else, a junkie, and uh... all the savings, all the plans, everything resets.
The lights turn on, and I'm holed up in some hotel across town.
I have to open the store tomorrow.
Not that early, I bet.
No, I'm lucky to have that job.
The sign store job you're lucky to have it?
It's not my fault when it goes wrong.
Yes it is.
Why do you live in hotels?
I do the books for a group that owns a few of them.
So it's sort of... a perk.
Right, but why do you choose...
I am starving...
Are you hungry?
You've got to be right?
It always just reminds me of family vacations.
Maybe because of the smell of chlorine and bleach in the sheets, the glasses wrapped in plastic.
Yeah...
We would go to this... there's this place in Vermont that we would go when we were kids.
It's like a colonial...
In Vermont?
Yeah.
It was historic and there was museums, but the thing that stood out for us was that they... we would stay at this hotel with an indoor pool, and it was just the biggest deal in the world for us.
Because one, it's indoor...
Two, you can swim... What's going on with you?
What are you thinking?
Is it good?
No.
You have a message.
Are you going?
To the banquet?
I mean it's going to be work, you know.
It's people from work.
For three hours.
I thought we could go...
...if you want.
You want to?
I'm sorry.
I like you so much.
I do. I like you so much.
I have...
You are kidding right?
I have been really careful not to lie about something.
And through omission,
I may have given you an impression that isn't quite real.
I work here.
I work on 29th C&L Crowne.
I'm not an advisor.
I don't broker.
I do interdepartmental reports, okay, I don't have an office.
I work in common space, I work with interns.
Greg pays me in cash to keep me off their books because if there is ever an audit, I am a liability.
I stole money, Kris.
Shifted it from account to account, until I could grab it.
Right, because if you...
I lost my broker's license... and they covered for me.
But if I was anybody else I would be in prison.
So I am lucky to have this job.
When you walk into that hotel... you're going to know.
When you walk into that banquet, you're going to know.
Because everybody there knows.
And they look at me in a certain way, and they talk to me in a certain way.
In a way that you don't look at me yet.
That was smart.
To wait to tell me.
I'm sorry.
Think you might be using that wrong.
Which direction is this?
Is that east?
You can see the whole city from up here.
I think I might be pregnant.
Won't let anyone near them.
They just crowd back in the corner.
Violent.
Oh yes, she's got a litter on the way.
They can get very protective.
Never seen the parents behave so.
Just never had them break my damn fence.
There's a fellow down the road buys them from me.
Well, if you need another buyer,
I know some petting farms.
They'd love to have some piglets.
Okay, sure, sure, thanks so much.
First off, you're not pregnant.
No, I did a test. I am.
The HCG in your blood tells us you're not.
And that's more definitive.
Okay.
Now, you didn't list it in your questionnaire, but... have you had any surgical procedures in your pelvic area?
Maybe a cyst was removed or a biopsy?
I'd say post cancer.
This is where they removed the tumor, this cavity.
She says no.
No what?
Someone was in there.
Trauma here, and...
How are you supposed to help someone like that?
By all appearances you're a survivor of stage three endometrial cancer.
The good news is that there isn't any sign of any remaining carcinoma.
Lab shows that you're in no immediate danger.
The trauma it left behind is significant.
Well, I'm saying two things.
It is highly unlikely given the state of the organs that you could ever become pregnant.
If by some miracle you were to conceive, the faculties are too damaged to carry a baby full term.
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Krissy?
Krissy? Krissy!
Where'd you go?
Something happened to me...
I was looking for you!
Something bad happened to me.
I know that, I don't care.
No you don't know!
I don't even know what happened.
I can't see my niece and nephews and...
Kris, why?
Why? What are you talking about?
I have to go there.
Okay, listen to me.
I want to, I want to marry you.
I'm married to you right now.
I need a car.
I'm marrying you, today.
Do you understand?
Yes. We'll get a car.
Today.
Do you know this place?
I want to say yes.
For you.
I want to.
Is there, is there a direction that you feel that you're more drawn to?
I don't know.
Is there one you feel drawn to?
I say right.
Left.
You sure?
No.
Then let's go right.
I'm going to go wherever you go.
You know that.
I feel like you know.
We should go on a trip.
Get somewhere.
Where would we go?
Somewhere bright.
They could be starlings.
They could be starlings.
When I was little, my friend Renny would come over and I'd get really mad because every time my Mom would bake cookies...
I knew a kid called Renny...
...he'd eat them all.
...this fat kid
He was fat, my neighbor Renny.
I told you this story
Is lunch ready?
Doesn't it look an improvement?
It's much better.
Much better right?
I guess so.
Who said that?
Who said that?
Who said they were Grackles?
Grackles.
They could be starlings.
They could be starlings.
So I was really excited to go swimming.
Yeah.
And he didn't even have a chance to tell me that there was bird shit all over the slide, so I went down anyway.
Wait.
Renny.
Right.
My neighbor.
You're tell- you're doing it again.
You're doing it again.
The kid almost drowned me.
We should go on a trip.
Get somewhere.
Where would we go?
To Vermont?
That place that you know?
Maybe.
How do you get there?
Renny used to come over and eat all the chocolate chip cookies
No, no, no I'm talking about a different one.
Renny is my friend.
With the pool and the slide.
With the pool and tried to drown me, yes,
I tell you a story and then you've taken it and you've made it your own, you do this all the time.
How do you get there?
The place where you and your family you'd go on vacation in Vermont?
You drive Kris.
What road would you take?
I would have to get a map.
You don't remember?
It's just some country road.
I was six.
No I was six.
I told you that story.
No you didn't, no.
Yes, he held me under remember, he held me under water.
So I'm not allowed to talk about my childhood?
Talk all you want, just don't talk about mine.
You think it's your childhood?
What about the trampoline?
With Mick?
No, that's you, that's yours.
That's me, thank you for that.
What about Renny?
No.
Almost drowned me?
Then lied to my mom about it?
No that's mine.
That's you, right, okay
That happened to me!
Kris!
Not only that but you're also trying to tell me that
They could be starlings.
They could be starlings.
Ring. where are you?
I don't know.
I can't find them anywhere.
Can't find who?
Where are you?
I know they're here.
I can feel them here.
I can't find them.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Are there three windows?
Yeah.
Two doors?
Uh huh.
Go in the one on the right.
It's just a room.
No it's a passage.
Go to the other side you're going through.
Now what?
- You in the room
- Yes.
- Is there a chair on the right?
- Yes.
Fire extinguishers yes?
Yeah.
There should be a door in front of you, a gray door, go through that.
Go past the columns then look for a door on the left, the next one, the next one.
Go down two flights of stairs.
Take the elevator.
Come on let's go.
Why were you at my work?
I didn't know I was.
What are we doing?
Where are we going, home?
Kris? Where are we going, home?
Kris, home?
Yeah, home.
"Oh husband," replied his wife.
Do you hear that?
Hear what?
There's like a...
There's this sound coming from underneath the house.
I don't hear anything.
It's really high pitched.
You're scaring me a little bit.
Kris, it's an old house.
There's nine things in this house that sound like that.
Can you just, can you just go in there, just go in there
I'm going to go in.
Thank you.
I haven't slept at all.
I'm sorry. It's really...
You don't believe me.
I'm not lying.
I may have...
I think I...
There's a weird flowing sound.
Right through the main, whatever this thing is.
The pipe.
But it's not what you're doing.
It's like low.
You know what I'm saying?
It's both, it's both those sounds.
It's both low and high at the same time.
No.
Yeah.
No, you...
Yeah, it's like a low and high.
It's like low and high.
Kris?
What are you doing here?
I love to be alone.
You love what?
The sun is but a morning star.
What'd you say?
The wildest sound ever heard makes the woods ring far and wide.
Faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear.
Their roots reaching quite under the house.
Fearing that they would be light-headed.
For want of food and also sleep.
Light-headed?
Prevailing blue mixed with yellow of the sand.
Sunshine is the color of the water.
I used to wonder at the halo of light around my shadow
And fancied myself one of the elect.
Economy.
When I wrote the following pages, or rather, the bulk of them
I lived alone in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore on the shore of Walden Pond.
And earned my living by the labor of my hands only.
I lived there for two years and two months.
At present I am a sojourner of civilized life again.
He heard a low and distant sound.
But grand, and impressive.
Unlike anything he had ever heard.
Gradually swelling and increasing.
As if it would have a universal and memorable ending.
Asullen rush and roar.
The rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed.
The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved.
A stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley.
But stream there was none.
I am glad to have drunk water so long.
For the same reason that
You told me you'd be there for me!
Calm down, just calm down, calm down!
Tired of blisters on your fingers?
Need a helping hand at home?
You need Blinky!
Hi, my name's Blinky.
The household robot with a mind of its own.
He's a servant, a helper, and a friend
Kids are gonna love Blinky and you will too!
Blinky is so helpful around the house, it's brought us together and made us closer as a family.
He's my new best friend!
He's just like one of the family.
All my friends have one...
Hi honey what's going on?
I know what I want for Christmas.
Hi, my name's Blinky...
...and I just want to be your friend.
Will you be my friend?
It's officially the best Christmas ever.
I'll never get sick of him.
Music plays
Muffled shouting.
Ready or not here I come...
I found you.
Yeah, I got bored waiting around.
Would you like to play another game?
Sure.
Muffled signs of parents arguing in background.
- Stop counting.
No problem.
Why did you stop counting?
- I'm sorry, would you like me to continuel?
- Yeah.
And I want you to stay completely still for the next 24 hours.
No problem.
Clean this!
No problem, I like to clean things.
Why did you move?
I told you not to move.
I told you not to stop counting.
I'm sorry, would you like me to continue?
You have to do everything I say, I own you!
No problem.
What use are you anyway? All you're good for is cooking and cleaning and playing stupid games!
Can you make my parents stop fighting? Can you do that?
No problem.
I could tell you to kill everybody, and you'd just stand there blinking like an idiot!
No problem.
What does it matter? Go on...
Kill my parents, kill me.
- No problem.
- Kill the dog, kill everyone.
- No problem.
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
Mom!
No problem, no problem, no problem...
Blinky's broken.
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
What did you do to him?
I didn't do anything, I think he's broken or something.
We need to get a new one.
Just turn him off and turn him back on again.
And if you make another mess like that I'm going to make Blinky clean and cook you for dinner.
I didn't do it, Blinky did it!
Don't start with me, I am not in the mood.
Clean it up!
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
Hi my name's Blinky and I just want to be your friend.
Will you be my friend?
Go on, do as you're told.
Clean it up!
Would you like to play another game?
Go away.
What?
Get out of my room.
Go annoy someone else.
Stop looking at me like that.
What do you want?
I just want to be your friend.
I did what you asked
Did I do good?
I just want to be your friend.
Lets be frrrrieeeends...
I don't trust him.
I don't understand you Alex.
Why would he hurt Rosie?
It makes no sense.
I just don't trust him.
Why won't you believe me?
Because you're bored with him and you're just trying to make us buy a newer one, that's why.
A clear frontrunner has appeared in the so-called robotics race.
Shellcore has announced that its prototype defence unit codenamed Warmachine...
...is ready for public testing after several expensive setbacks.
...the family
I just want to be your friend.
Would you like to play another game?
- Look at the mess you've made
- What?
You did this, clean it up!
No problem.
...excessive exposure to water...
...make sure Blinky is updated with the latest downloadable firmware updates...
...make sure Blinky is serviced at least once every 2 months...
Ready or not, here I come...
Do you like your meatballs?
They're fine, thank you.
Have you seen Alex?
No problem.
Alex is right here.
I recycled him.
I don't understand you  Blinky. 
What do you mean?
I cleaned him and cooked him for dinner.
You're eating him.
Did I do good?
Shellcore has issued a full product recall and full refund. please call....

{10015}{10084}and medically he's stable, so|legally we can't keep him here.
{10085}{10131}But we do think that he should|be monitored for a few days.
{10132}{10160}Does he have any family?
{10161}{10221}Lou's family all kind of hate him.
{10222}{10291}Okay. Well, then I guess it's|up to you guys, his friends.
{10292}{10394}You are his friends, right?
{10395}{10471}It's like that friend who's the asshole.|But he's our asshole, you know?
{10472}{10510}Right.
{10511}{10571}Yeah.
{10633}{10703}/Dr. Jefferies to radiology.
{10704}{10767}Lou. Why would he do this?
{10768}{10823}Why? I mean, make a list.
{10824}{10872}He's an alcoholic, he's divorced.
{10873}{10920}Wife ran off with that Jamaican guy.
{10921}{10991}He's failed at every jive-ass|money hustle he's ever tried.
{10992}{11031}He's in a mountain of debt.
{11032}{11096}- He hates his mother.|- He hates himself. He hates everybody.
{11097}{11159}- He has erectile dysfunction.|- He's got halitosis.
{11160}{11196}He's got that runt ball.
{11197}{11223}Huh.
{11224}{11283}He said one of his balls|was shriveled up...
{11284}{11352}- Oh, yeah. ...like a spoiled grape.
{11353}{11411}Wasn't it that quarterback on the Bears
{11412}{11463}who had his ball crushed|on the field. Right?
{11464}{11502}- Yeah.|- Yeah.
{11503}{11570}- Right, right.|- '82? Yeah, yeah.
{11571}{11623}- He came back from that, though.|- Strong as ever.
{11624}{11673}- Fuck yeah.|- But I don't know about Lou.
{11674}{11721}- It's just like...|- No.
{11722}{11794}It's just like an|accumulation of punishment.
{11795}{11819}Fuck you guys.
{11820}{11846}- Oh!|- Hey!
{11847}{11893}There he is. Hey.
{11894}{11955}I can fucking hear everything|you're saying, all right?
{11956}{12033}Look who's awake. What's up, man?
{12034}{12079}- Hey.|- Hey, man.
{12080}{12105}What's up?
{12106}{12190}You look just like my friend Nick.
{12191}{12227}And you look like my friend Adam.
{12228}{12289}But you wouldn't be those guys because|I've been calling and calling them,
{12290}{12383}- and they haven't returned my calls.|- So, listen, Violator.
{12384}{12435}Me and Nick got a little|surprise for you.
{12436}{12503}Something special that|the three of us can do.
{12504}{12537}Come on. You guys.
{12538}{12569}- Are you curious?|- No!
{12570}{12627}I didn't fucking try and kill myself.
{12628}{12694}If I wanted to kill myself,|I'd fucking kill myself.
{12695}{12724}I'd be awesome at it.
{12725}{12780}A shotgun to the dick.
{12781}{12811}I'm glad you didn't do it.
{12812}{12920}It's good to see you guys, anyway.
{12921}{12996}So, just out of curiosity,|what's the surprise?
{12997}{13041}Tell him.
{13042}{13116}Ko-di-ak...
{13121}{13147}...Valley.
{13148}{13176}No fucking way!
{13177}{13201}- Yes, sir.|- Yeah.
{13202}{13289}- Fucking K-Vals? Holy shit!|- Yes, sir. Bang!
{13290}{13356}We fucking ski, right? We fucking rage.
{13357}{13480}Chimney Point at the end of the night with|a bottle of scotch to wash it all down. Oh!
{13481}{13554}And you guys are paying|for the whole thing?
{13555}{13581}- Sure.|- Yep.
{13582}{13608}Let's go tonight.
{13609}{13660}- We go tomorrow.|- Let's go now. Let's go now.
{13661}{13714}I just got to get rid of this|thing. It's really uncomfortable.
{13715}{13744}You should wait for|the nurse or something.
{13745}{13780}I got it. I got it.
{13781}{13806}- Hold on, Lou.|- No, no, no, no.
{13807}{13924}Let somebody do that for you.
{14068}{14106}- Oh, shit.|- God.
{14107}{14133}Did I get that on you?
{14134}{14164}- Yes, you did.|- Damn it!
{14165}{14299}It's only pee. Relax, it's only pee.
{14346}{14404}- There's Lou.|- Good, he's drinking already.
{14405}{14441}Look at this shit.
{14442}{14497}Do you remember when I was|12 and he tried to bite me?
{14498}{14578}Yeah, but he... You had that coming.
{14579}{14625}- Hey, Violator.|- Lou.
{14626}{14673}What the fuck is he doing here?
{14674}{14703}It's nice to see you, too, Lou.
{14704}{14769}"Nice to see you, too,|Lou." Fuck you, Jacob.
{14770}{14817}You suck and you know it.
{14818}{14950}You just ruined my fucking weekend.
{15107}{15195}Hey, Lily will come back. Trust me.
{15196}{15238}- No, she won't.|- No, she won't.
{15239}{15271}- No, she won't.|- No, she won't.
{15272}{15315}She basically thinks I'm|an asshole, you know?
{15316}{15363}Like a completely|self-absorbed, delusional...
{15364}{15404}- She's got a point.|- narcissistic.
{15405}{15441}- Fuck you.|- You're better off.
{15442}{15495}Take my word for it. Look at me.
{15496}{15551}Fuck wives, man. Fuck kids.
{15552}{15652}Lock it down or they will|take everything from you.
{15653}{15719}God damn it! Who the fuck|are you texting with?
{15720}{15747}Just a friend of mine.
{15748}{15791}Male or fucking female?
{15792}{15864}For your information, I've|had a lot of girlfriends.
{15865}{15890}Hot ones.
{15891}{16040}You have had lots of|boyfriends. Gay ones.
{16061}{16109}Hey, hey, hey, check this out.
{16110}{16158}I brought a regulation|bar for tubbing tonight.
{16159}{16184}Nice.
{16185}{16279}I've got vodka, fucking|Tequilles O'Neals.
{16280}{16335}You guys are gonna love|this. Check this out.
{16336}{16364}Chernobly.
{16365}{16399}It's like the Russian Red Bull.
{16400}{16438}It's got shit in it that's|not even legal here.
{16439}{16479}Like what shit?
{16480}{16517}How the fuck am I|supposed to know, dude?
{16518}{16559}But it's illegal.
{16560}{16630}Hey, why didn't we just go to Pinnacle?|It would have taken, like, half the time.
{16631}{16710}You wanna go to Kodiak Valley, trust|me. You're at the right age for it.
{16711}{16743}- Really?|- Yeah.
{16744}{16823}Nobody gets carded and|everybody gets laid.
{16824}{16890}K- Val! K-Val! K-Val!
{16891}{16925}- K-Val! K-Val!|- K-Val! K-Val!
{16926}{17012}Oh, shit! K-Val!
{17095}{17179}This? This is the coolest town ever?
{17180}{17258}Fuck! That used to be Papa Enzo's.
{17259}{17314}I broke up with Jenny Stedmeyer there.
{17315}{17362}- What made you break up with her, again?|- I don't know.
{17363}{17407}We swapped virginities junior year.
{17408}{17448}All we did was listen to|records and have sex.
{17449}{17514}And she was epic, I mean|she was... She was epic.
{17515}{17541}Yeah, man. She was hot.
{17542}{17587}And then when I broke up|with her, she was so mad,
{17588}{17643}she practically stabbed me|in the eye with a fork.
{17644}{17694}Actually, she did stab me|in the eye with a fork.
{17695}{17724}She was a one-percenter, man.
{17725}{17797}- Yeah.|- All downhill from there.
{17798}{17862}That was a big one. First love.
{17863}{17894}The one that got away.
{17895}{17943}The great white buffalo.
{17944}{17974}- Yeah.|- Yeah.
{17975}{18011}The great what?
{18012}{18056}Great white buffalo.
{18057}{18106}Why are you guys whispering?
{18107}{18154}Great white buffalo.
{18155}{18311}That was really helpful,|you guys. Thank you.
{18389}{18430}Look at this place.
{18431}{18474}I'm gonna make a prediction right now.
{18475}{18554}One of us is gonna start writing a|novel, and then we all get snowed in,
{18555}{18701}and then Lou's gonna|ax murder all of us.
{18731}{18769}Motherfuck.
{18770}{18808}What's that smell?
{18809}{18860}Fucking cats.
{18861}{18933}Kind of a lot of cats. This sucks.
{18934}{18971}- Hi.|- Hi.
{18972}{19052}You got a reservation for Webber-Agnew?
{19053}{19089}Sorry. What was that name again?
{19090}{19166}Webber-Agnew. Webber and Agnew.
{19167}{19200}I got a "Nick Webber-Agnew."
{19201}{19265}I'm sorry, excuse me. What?|What did you just say?
{19266}{19292}Webber-Agnew?
{19293}{19359}Webber-fucking-Agnew?
{19360}{19422}You took your wife's last name?|You're a fucking hyphenate?
{19423}{19475}A lot of dudes are doing|it. It's progressive.
{19476}{19517}No. No dudes are doing it.
{19518}{19559}You look like a progressive|guy. Is that progressive?
{19560}{19599}- Would you do that? No.|- No.
{19600}{19696}And he has a goatee.
{19731}{19770}Does this guy seem a|little imbalanced to you?
{19771}{19872}- No. Come on.|- He's right there. Shut up.
{19873}{19910}Let me give you a hand with that.
{19911}{19940}Hey!
{19941}{20068}I am not going to tell you again!
{20078}{20132}I can handle it.
{20133}{20169}This guy's a fucking dick.
{20170}{20222}- Shh. He's disabled.|- He can hear you.
{20223}{20275}So what? He's exempt from|common fucking courtesy
{20276}{20346}'cause he can't start|a round of applause?
{20347}{20383}He's gotta jerk off one-handed?
{20384}{20476}I mean, I certainly don't take my hands|and I put them together and oil them up...
{20477}{20590}Hey, 420. Our old room. Check it out.
{20591}{20620}- That's okay man.|- Oh! Those are mine.
{20621}{20717}I'll just get those.
{20827}{20927}This is the part where you tip|the guy that helped you out.
{20928}{20988}I'm not the guy that...
{20989}{21018}Nick, pay the man something.
{21019}{21079}- I got it. Don't worry.|- This place looks like shit!
{21080}{21142}What happened to that guy?
{21143}{21214}Check this shit out. It's still there.
{21215}{21284}Adam sucks cocks 'n' dicks.
{21285}{21379}- It's your best work.|- Fucking burned you.
{21380}{21433}- Burned!|- Hey, guys, come take a look at this.
{21434}{21523}We got a hot tub.
{21530}{21574}- Sweet Jesus!|- Poor little fella.
{21575}{21627}This is obviously unacceptable, right?
{21628}{21695}We call downstairs, get|somebody to fix this?
{21696}{21783}Is anybody else hungry?
{21784}{21831}A little school spirit this time, huh?
{21832}{21878}- We're in, man.|- Just play it like you fucking mean it.
{21879}{21949}- Like that.|- Yeah.
{21950}{22059}Yes, I would like to get a hooker|to fuck me and my friends.
{22060}{22114}What? Adam, I'm not doing that.
{22115}{22143}Whatever, semantics.
{22144}{22267}I want an escort to escort|our penises into her vagina.
{22268}{22319}I want the girl in the picture, too.
{22320}{22350}No tomfoolery.
{22351}{22407}- Wake her up, I don't care.|- Will you listen to him?
{22408}{22438}Does she do four?
{22439}{22480}What about three?
{22481}{22521}- Okay. Jacob, you're out.|- Okay. Good.
{22522}{22587}- I need $3,000.|- I'm not in. I'm married.
{22588}{22641}Adam, I need $2,000. Me and you, buddy.
{22642}{22695}- Come on.|- I'm out there, Violator.
{22696}{22732}Can I call you back, sir?
{22733}{22785}- Okay. Thank you. Bye.|- Sir?
{22786}{22843}Let's do something fun.|Let's create a memory, huh?
{22844}{22907}Let's get some cocaine|and break into a school.
{22908}{22972}Or steal a cop car or some shit, huh?
{22973}{23013}- Do you have Ritalin?|- No.
{23014}{23107}Don't fucking lie to me. Every|one of you people have Ritalin.
{23108}{23174}- No, I don't.|- I'm sorry. You probably do have Ritalin.
{23175}{23212}I have some Ativan, but it's different.
{23213}{23246}- Let's stick it up our asses.|- Just give it to him.
{23247}{23282}No. It's not a suppository.
{23283}{23348}It doesn't matter. You crush it,|you put it in a warm paper towel,
{23349}{23413}run it under warm some water and you|stick it right up your ass. That works.
{23414}{23448}You put the paper|towel up your ass, too?
{23449}{23482}- You crush up the...|- Hey, I got an idea,
{23483}{23518}- why don't we just play quarters?|- What?
{23519}{23584}I don't know what the fuck I'm|gonna do. I'm getting really sad.
{23585}{23620}You know what I'm talking about?
{23621}{23676}I'm gonna go to the bathroom and|be alone with my own thoughts.
{23677}{23713}Who knows what's gonna happen up there.
{23714}{23827}Who knows what's gonna happen.|You better plan something fun.
{23828}{23870}Jesus!
{23871}{23914}Pussies. I'm going dancing.
{23915}{23971}I don't know, man. Maybe|coming here was a bad idea.
{23972}{23997}Yeah.
{23998}{24064}If he kills himself, can we go home?
{24065}{24099}Hard to believe this is the very room
{24100}{24159}we had some of the best|weekends of our lives.
{24160}{24245}Really? In this room right here?
{24246}{24279}How?
{24280}{24391}We were young. We had|momentum. We were winning.
{24392}{24432}We were best friends.
{24433}{24468}What do you mean, "were" best friends?
{24469}{24537}You know what I mean, man.|Everybody seemed to care more.
{24538}{24596}Everything seemed to|matter more back then.
{24597}{24667}Whatever.
{24894}{24971}Check it out. They must have fixed it.
{24972}{25023}Come on!
{25024}{25069}- How's the water, Violator?|- Oh, man.
{25070}{25143}You guys gotta get in here.|It's gonna fucking change you.

{25240}{25267}You don't think it's a little weird,
{25268}{25329}a bunch of guys just piling up in|a big bathtub together, naked?
{25330}{25386}Are you afraid that some of|these people might see you?
{25387}{25420}I'm sorry. If I'm being honest,
{25421}{25502}I'm not totally comfortable being|around a bunch of other naked dudes.
{25503}{25595}/It's called male bonding, okay?|/Haven't you even seen Wild Hogs?
{25596}{25631}Fine, get us some snacks.

{31398}{31573}/Hey, look, it's the douche|/bag from Karate Kid III.
{31579}{31665}I know that guy.
{32155}{32182}Hey, guys.
{32183}{32246}Is there some kind of weird retro|thing going on this weekend?
{32247}{32279}Can't get any bars.
{32280}{32339}Morty! Yeah, it's Chuck.
{32340}{32393}You're never gonna believe|where I'm calling you from, man.
{32394}{32487}I'm on a mountain on my phone! Yeah.
{32488}{32632}Yeah, well, a bet's a bet. I want my $2.
{32688}{32747}I'm telling you, something|weird is going on.
{32748}{32815}/Demand your MTV.
{32816}{32900}/I want my MTV.
{32912}{32991}/S- A-F-E-T-Y
{33061}{33140}/Safe, dance!
{33239}{33328}I love your hair.
{33332}{33370}/I have a question.
{33371}{33422}/...can still tell me that's true.
{33423}{33588}/But the facts and the|/evidence tell me it is...
{33739}{33776}Dude is rocking a cassette player.
{33777}{33825}Just relax. I'm sure there's|a reasonable explanation
{33826}{33858}- for all this shit.|- Don't fucking tell me to relax.
{33859}{33891}I said relax for a minute.
{33892}{33931}Leg warmers?
{33932}{33967}Jheri curl?
{33968}{34002}"Where's the beef?"
{34003}{34092}Excuse me, miss, what|color is Michael Jackson?
{34093}{34155}Black.
{34243}{34341}Hold on! Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
{34342}{34394}Nick, come on, man! Nick! Nick!
{34395}{34422}Who the fuck is that?
{34423}{34506}That's probably Ashton Kolchak right now|telling us we've been punked or whatever.
{34507}{34620}- Okay.|- Come on. Come on.
{34652}{34723}Hey. Hey, guys. I've got your luggage.
{34724}{34839}He's got both arms. Get him!
{34875}{34920}- What?|- Check his arm.
{34921}{34971}- Are you raping?|- Wait! Hold on! Are we raping him?
{34972}{35002}Nobody's raping anybody!
{35003}{35045}Where's your missing arm, motherfucker?
{35046}{35102}Hey! God! That's my arm!
{35103}{35139}- It's fake!|- It's real!
{35140}{35267}It's got freckles on it and shit!
{35411}{35457}Do I really got to be|the asshole that says
{35458}{35519}we got in this thing|and went back in time?
{35520}{35669}It must be some kind of|hot tub time machine.
{35670}{35740}- Wow, my old stuff.|- Look at this shit, man.
{35741}{35796}- You have a bong?|- I did.
{35797}{35853}"Eddie Lives." This shirt|got me so much fucking pussy.
{35854}{35883}You wanna see what got a lot of pussy?
{35884}{35911}What's the tape recorder for?
{35912}{35940}- Recording tape.|- I gotta take a piss.
{35941}{35977}- This jacket right here, baby.|- Holy fuck!
{35978}{36010}What are you, Hunter S. Thompson?
{36011}{36059}- I thought I was.|- Is that coke?
{36060}{36107}What the fuck you think|it is? Baby powder?
{36108}{36299}Wait. How is this happening? Can|we talk about this for a minute?
{36300}{36383}Holy fuck! Winterfest|'86. We were here, man.
{36384}{36419}- Guys.|- We are here.
{36420}{36474}- What if we run into ourselves?|- Guys!
{36475}{36553}We see ourselves and we blow|up and explode or some shit.
{36554}{36580}Get in here!
{36581}{36611}/Didn't you all fucking see Timecop?
{36612}{36659}God damn it! Get the|fuck in here right now!
{36660}{36706}Nobody wants to see|your giant shit, Lou.
{36707}{36779}What, man?
{37016}{37078}Yeah, we're not gonna|run into ourselves.
{37079}{37107}We are ourselves.
{37108}{37171}Why are we in our young bodies|and you in your regular body?
{37172}{37227}- I don't know.|- Shouldn't you be invisible?
{37228}{37267}Or swimming around some guy's ball sack?
{37268}{37371}I know. Because you guys|exist here and I don't.
{37372}{37420}Hey, why are you flickering?
{37421}{37456}- What?|- What? What? Who flickered?
{37457}{37502}- He did.|- He's flickering.
{37503}{37564}I need you to touch my arm or something|to see if I'm still real, okay?
{37565}{37698}Just see if you can put|your hand through me.
{37699}{37735}Okay.
{37736}{37767}That's good.
{37768}{37899}I'm physically still here.|That's good, I think.
{37900}{37939}You look like Kid 'N Play.
{37940}{38053}That's actually two people.
{38057}{38095}I knew this trip was a bad idea.
{38096}{38156}Every time I hang out with you,|man, it's some kind of shit storm.
{38157}{38232}I got guilted into coming on this trip|and now I'm back in the fucking '80s.
{38233}{38260}And I hate this decade!
{38261}{38297}Maybe it's your fucking fault!
{38298}{38363}You're a fucking insurance salesman,|you're practically the devil.
{38364}{38418}Guys! This is scientifically possible.
{38419}{38503}Oh, my God. Okay, Professor Hawking,|tell me in your robot voice
{38504}{38545}how this is scientifically possible.
{38546}{38587}/All right, I write|/Stargate fan fiction,
{38588}{38634}so I think I know what I'm|talking about right now.
{38635}{38698}I seriously almost passed|out, you're such a dork.
{38699}{38763}Okay. The tub is obviously some|kind of energy vortex, right?
{38764}{38791}Like a black hole.
{38792}{38866}But, instead of being in space,
{38867}{38907}it's in a hot tub.
{38908}{38981}Time is not linear, we|just perceive it that way!
{38982}{39023}/- What?|- Like The Terminator!
{39024}{39073}It's cyclical, right?
{39074}{39138}The machines send Schwarzenegger|back to kill Sarah Connor
{39139}{39185}so that John Connor could never be born.
{39186}{39255}But if John Connor don't send|Michael Biehn back to protect her,
{39256}{39368}then they never fuck, and John Connor|ain't born in the first place!
{39369}{39409}- It checks out.|- Yeah, that's pretty good.
{39410}{39473}Wait, wait, check the fucking|drawer. See if the carving's there.
{39474}{39547}Check the fucking drawer.
{39548}{39608}Fuck!
{39636}{39688}It's gone.
{39689}{39715}This shit is real.
{39716}{39844}The carving you made 20 years ago,|about me sucking cocks and dicks,
{39845}{39907}- it's not there.|- Wait.
{39908}{39938}Is "cocks" still there?
{39939}{40003}- Nothing. I mean, it's not there.|- What about "dicks"?
{40004}{40067}Neither "cocks," nor|"dicks," nor "sucks."
{40068}{40116}Oh, God!
{40117}{40145}That's it.
{40146}{40211}We stuck in the fucking '80s!
{40212}{40283}How am I supposed to get a job?
{40284}{40365}I'm so scared.
{40366}{40412}Looks like you burned out your...
{40413}{40517}Heck, you fried your timing crossover.
{40518}{40548}Would you mind putting that down, sir,
{40549}{40649}that coal shovel, before|somebody gets hurt?
{40650}{40685}Did somebody call you?
{40686}{40784}Excuse me one minute.
{40853}{40919}Who ever calls us?
{40920}{41026}And who answers when the|call comes from within? Huh?
{41027}{41133}I thought maybe I could pull the|part from one of the other tubs.
{41134}{41218}But it turns out this is a very|special model that you have here.
{41219}{41276}You've got to be very|careful, I tell you.
{41277}{41392}One little thing is changed,|the whole system can go haywire.
{41393}{41441}Do you understand what I'm saying?
{41442}{41557}The whole system can go haywire|if you change one little thing.
{41558}{41629}Wait a minute. We need|that to get back in time?
{41630}{41657}Well, you're back here.
{41658}{41748}I mean, I can tell you've all|been to Kodiak Valley before.
{41749}{41785}- I haven't.|- Maybe not her,
{41786}{41846}but I know that you were here.
{41847}{41909}You know what's going on|here, don't you, old man?
{41910}{41941}Yes, I do.
{41942}{42037}Your tub is on the fritz.|It'd behoove you to fix it.
{42038}{42069}What?
{42070}{42149}It's working.
{42192}{42300}- Damn. I think it's still broke.|- Shit.
{42301}{42326}Where'd he go?
{42327}{42372}That motherfucker's in on it, man.
{42373}{42443}What was all that cryptic shit he was|saying about not changing one little thing?
{42444}{42491}I know exactly what he meant. He was|talking about the butterfly effect.
{42492}{42559}That was a great fucking movie.
{42560}{42632}One little change has a ripple effect|and it affects everything else.
{42633}{42680}Like, a butterfly floats its wings
{42681}{42768}and Tokyo explodes, or there's|a tsunami in, like, somewhere.
{42769}{42867}Dude, yes, exactly. Or you step on a bug|and the fucking Internet's never invented.
{42868}{42929}Then you have to talk to|girls with your mouth.
{42930}{43020}Yeah. I was more concerned about bigger|consequences, like me not being born.
{43021}{43057}Oh, yeah. No, I don't care about that.
{43058}{43116}The point is, what did|we do 20 years ago?
{43117}{43218}Let's figure it out right now. We|gotta do the exact same thing.
{43219}{43260}- I had that gig.|- That's right.
{43261}{43339}You got up on stage and|you were wildly mediocre.
{43340}{43373}And that led to nothing of a career.
{43374}{43435}Okay, first of all,|fuck you, motherfucker!
{43436}{43464}I could have had a career,
{43465}{43514}but I got married and|I went a different way.
{43515}{43548}Which way is that? The way that sucked?
{43549}{43583}Didn't you also bang that groupie?
{43584}{43626}- What was her name?|- Tara.
{43627}{43693}You banged her. You got|to go do that again.
{43694}{43780}I did do that. But,|fuck, no, I'm married!
{43781}{43819}I can't go around banging|girls in hot tubs.
{43820}{43903}Nick, it's 1986. You can't cheat|on someone you don't know yet.
{43904}{43959}You haven't even met Courtney.
{43960}{44013}Lucifer, itinerary please.
{44014}{44038}Uh... Nothing really happened.
{44039}{44083}I actually fucked a chick,|too. So I'll just do that.
{44084}{44166}I seem to remember you|getting your ass whooped.
{44167}{44205}- Oh, yeah.|- That's right.
{44206}{44275}That ski patrol dude pummeled|you like it was his job.
{44276}{44330}- Yeah, no. I don't remember it that way.|- I do.
{44331}{44391}Yeah. He fucked you|up. You cried and peed.
{44392}{44465}Fuck this, man! This|is fucking bullshit!
{44466}{44515}Would you just think of somebody|other than yourself, man?
{44516}{44590}- There's four of us.|- It's the fucking '80s, guys!
{44591}{44657}Let's do what we wanna do. Free love!
{44658}{44698}That's the '60s, dipshit.
{44699}{44794}No, we had, like, Reagan and AIDS.|Let's get the fuck out of here, okay?
{44795}{44829}Do the right thing, Violator.
{44830}{44899}God damn it! This is fucking bullshit!
{44900}{44949}Tonight's the night you broke|up with Jenny Stedmeyer.
{44950}{44979}- Shit.|- Yeah, you got stabbed
{44980}{45041}in the fucking eyeball tonight!
{45042}{45094}Hey, man, do you want backup?
{45095}{45132}I can't, the butterflies won't let me.
{45133}{45167}Yo, Adam? You guys in there?
{45168}{45238}Oh, shit.
{45267}{45318}There you are. Hey!
{45319}{45379}How come you guys didn't meet us|at the chair lift this morning?
{45380}{45409}You were going to show me some moves.
{45410}{45513}Hi, baby. I missed you.
{45528}{45567}I must have forgot.
{45568}{45626}Perv. That's from Mandy.
{45627}{45690}- Hey, new guy. What's up?|- Hey.
{45691}{45724}So we're in 214. I'm gonna go get ready.
{45725}{45757}- Okay.|- Meet me in my room, okay?
{45758}{45799}- Okay.|- Okay.
{45800}{45893}Love the PJs, Nick. You look hot.
{45894}{45940}Poison's tonight.
{45941}{45969}Wow!
{45970}{46015}I don't remember her being|that fucking beautiful.
{46016}{46047}And tight.
{46048}{46103}She's so tight.
{46104}{46130}She's really fucking tight!
{46131}{46164}She's the great white buffalo, man.
{46165}{46196}- Great white buffalo.|- Great white buffalo.
{46197}{46237}Don't start that.
{46238}{46274}- Great white buffalo.|- Great white buffalo.
{46275}{46325}Why did I ever break up with her?|Why would I break up with her?
{46326}{46395}Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. 'Cause|you have to do it again. Right?
{46396}{46436}Right, right, right.
{46437}{46468}All right. We're all|gonna meet back here.
{46469}{46520}Hopefully that hot tub's fixed and|we can get the fuck out of here.
{46521}{46558}Okay, let's party like it's 1986.
{46559}{46588}All right. On three?
{46589}{46613}- One, two, three...|- One, two, three...
{46614}{46657}- Hot tub time machine!|- Wait...
{46658}{46684}What are we... What's the...
{46685}{46709}Who said, "Hot tub time machine?"
{46710}{46740}We didn't tell you about the|new thing, with our hands?
{46741}{46777}- No.|- On three, we always...
{46778}{46811}From now on, we're gonna|say, "Hot tub time machine."
{46812}{46843}I told you, I think|that's fucking stupid.
{46844}{46868}You were in the bathroom.
{46869}{46894}No, but this is a real|bonding event for us.
{46895}{46920}This doesn't happen all the time.
{46921}{46956}- Come on.|- I'm telling you, it's stupid.
{46957}{46987}- Do it once.|- Do what you want to do.
{46988}{47017}It would have been 3-to-1 anyway.
{47018}{47050}One, two, three...
{47051}{47078}...hot tub time machine!
{47079}{47182}It felt good. Admit it.
{47395}{47430}Hey!
{47431}{47500}Let's get this party started!
{47501}{47562}Who is carrying me home tonight?
{47563}{47589}Mom?
{47590}{47654}- Sweet fucking Lord.|- Kelly.
{47655}{47710}- Hey, bro, Nicholas.|- Hey, girl.
{47711}{47788}- Who's the geek?|- He's your son.
{47789}{47830}That's not appropriate.
{47831}{47865}I'm sun... Sunshine.
{47866}{47892}Sunshine.
{47893}{47919}'Cause I'm here to brighten your day.
{47920}{47982}That's Jacob. Your...
{47983}{48016}He's totally cool.
{48017}{48074}- He doesn't look cool.|- He's not that cool.
{48075}{48114}Hey, Kelly.
{48115}{48164}Lou Dorchen. Yeah...
{48165}{48216}- You don't remember this?|- I don't remember everything.
{48217}{48265}What the fuck, man? This is|freaking me the fuck out.
{48266}{48302}You freak out every time|you leave the basement.
{48303}{48332}All right, kiddies,|get your snow boots on
{48333}{48389}because tonight there|is gonna be a blizzard.
{48390}{48431}Really? It looked pretty clear out.
{48432}{48486}Anybody wanna go for|a little sleigh ride?
{48487}{48572}You can't do cocaine! It's|so unhealthy for you.
{48573}{48630}- Kelly, in public?|- Whatever.
{48631}{48670}I'm gonna go to a party|at the ski patrol house,
{48671}{48769}I'm gonna find a sexy instructor|and I'm gonna wax his fucking pole.
{48770}{48828}Later, homos. Don't|drink my fucking drink.
{48829}{48886}Ugh!
{48887}{48911}Hey, Adam?
{48912}{48994}What she means is that she works|at the ski rental place, right?
{48995}{49048}And that's her job, is|cleaning the poles.
{49049}{49110}I could be off, but I think it's|in reference to blowing a dude.
{49111}{49183}Thank you, Nick. But|that's... You don't need to...
{49184}{49273}Or fucking a dude. Because the wax,|it can be interpreted either way.
{49274}{49332}She was a free spirit, you know?
{49333}{49426}Or maybe she's the pole and there's|two dudes that she's waxing.
{49427}{49506}Let's just get it done, man. Come on.
{49507}{49536}- Hey, Lou.|- What?
{49537}{49608}Did my mom, like, sleep|with a bunch of dudes?
{49609}{49634}I don't know. Shut up.
{49635}{49669}But she seems kind of slutty, right?
{49670}{49726}Does she seem that way to you?
{49727}{49771}It's just, she never|told me who my dad is.
{49772}{49808}It could be any one of these guys.
{49809}{49858}'Cause I was born, like,|nine months from now.
{49859}{49898}Yeah? So what does that mean?
{49899}{49984}It means do the math, dipshit. I could|have been conceived this weekend.
{49985}{50026}Oh, shit. Check this out.
{50027}{50128}That's that fucking|bellhop. I hate that guy.
{50129}{50263}This must be where he loses the arm!
{50267}{50310}- Shit!|- Thank you!
{50311}{50354}I think we should tell|him. This is gruesome.
{50355}{50556}Don't you dare fucking tell him.|You'll screw the time thing up.
{50750}{50800}Yeah!
{50801}{50872}- Yes!|- What the fuck?
{50873}{50933}Yeah!
{50934}{51042}- Boo! We just got fucking robbed.|- What are you talking about?
{51043}{51091}- He's great, man.|- Come on!
{51092}{51154}Jenny.
{51159}{51250}- Jenny?|- I'm in the bathroom. Come in.
{51251}{51290}What do you think?
{51291}{51328}Oh, my God.
{51329}{51391}What? Do I look fat?
{51392}{51490}No. You look really beautiful.
{51491}{51573}Aw! Thank you.
{51623}{51659}How about me, do I look different?
{51660}{51717}Do I look kind of older?
{51718}{51766}No.
{51767}{51820}You look cute, though.
{51821}{51864}God, I can't stop thinking|about last night.
{51865}{51918}It was like frigging hot.
{51919}{51994}It was? What did we|do? I don't remember.
{51995}{52070}You lasted, like, 10 minutes.
{52071}{52102}Oh!
{52103}{52146}Good, good.
{52147}{52176}And I was good.
{52177}{52276}I think I came. I think. I can't|even tell you what it was like.
{52277}{52355}I got some vague recollection of that.
{52356}{52396}Wanna maybe just sit|and talk for a minute?
{52397}{52429}"Talk."
{52430}{52619}Well, I mean, you know, it's|just so good to see you again.
{52622}{52723}It's not you. It's me.
{52785}{52827}Lamp.
{52828}{52893}You know what, I think we|should go to Poison now.
{52894}{52923}You're weird today.
{52924}{52967}I know. You are funny.
{52968}{53066}- Let me just get dressed.|- Okay.
{53067}{53125}Wow!
{53195}{53238}Oh, man!
{53239}{53275}This is trippy.
{53276}{53320}What's up?
{53321}{53425}Man, I can't even remember|the last time I saw you guys.
{53426}{53478}Yesterday.
{53479}{53575}Oh, yeah. Yesterday.
{53595}{53653}Yep.
{53745}{53830}It's not cheating. It's|not cheating. It's 1986.
{53831}{53919}You don't even know Courtney yet.
{53920}{53960}You know, it's okay if|you're scared, Lou.
{53961}{54022}I'm not scared, idiot.|I'm fucking pissed.
{54023}{54063}I have a full head of hair|and a functioning penis,
{54064}{54118}and I'm looking for some guy to|drill me in the fucking jaw.
{54119}{54156}We're not gonna find him here, anyway.
{54157}{54300}I don't even remember|what he looks like.
{54301}{54340}- Walk much, faggot?|- Sorry.
{54341}{54379}What? No, don't touch|me. Fuck your "sorry."
{54380}{54452}You scuffed up my Jordans.
{54453}{54534}You wanna go for it? Come on,|take a shot, pussy. Wanna party?
{54535}{54583}Wanna be a hero?
{54584}{54675}And here it comes.
{54726}{54809}Yeah, you gonna cry? You|gonna cry, titty baby?
{54810}{54844}You gonna fucking cry?
{54845}{54895}Look at him he's crying.
{54896}{54966}Your fucking bag is mine now.
{54967}{55005}Is that it?
{55006}{55041}No.
{55042}{55085}No, I yell back at him
{55086}{55130}and I challenge him to a|rematch at midnight saying,
{55131}{55166}"You bring your friends|and I'll bring mine."
{55167}{55202}And my friends don't fucking show up.
{55203}{55257}So I get pummeled by|six guys instead of one.
{55258}{55363}All right, fantastic. Let's do this.
{55364}{55455}Lou, come on. You have to.
{55456}{55526}Hey, Blaine.
{55527}{55640}Is that all you got? Pussy.
{55665}{55747}Oh, God. Yeah.
{55753}{55868}I'll never go back. I'll never go back.
{55869}{55918}Are you crying?
{55919}{55948}No.
{55949}{56021}It's the water splashing my|face from all the fucking.
{56022}{56060}Okay, good.
{56061}{56145}Because I thought you were|crying, and I was like...
{56146}{56174}Yeah!
{56175}{56212}I'm sorry, Courtney.
{56213}{56257}- It's Tara.|- Courtney!
{56258}{56313}- Tara. Tara.|- Courtney! Courtney!
{56314}{56381}No, seriously, my name is Tara.
{56382}{56465}No, my wife, my wife.
{56466}{56493}You're married?
{56494}{56552}No, I'm not married. Not now, anyway.
{56553}{56678}I will be. She's nine right now.
{56753}{56837}Can I tell you something|that I haven't told anybody?
{56838}{56918}She cheated on me.
{56919}{56974}I found a e-mail.
{56975}{57073}And now every time I look at her, all|I can see is her getting rammed by
{57074}{57153}some faceless dude with a|better body and a bigger dick.
{57154}{57216}Truth of it is, I can't even|bring myself to say anything
{57217}{57310}because I just love her so fucking much.
{57311}{57381}I don't even know if I can|live without her cheating ass.
{57382}{57422}Hey, what's an e-mail?
{57423}{57482}That's not the point!
{57483}{57557}Seems like you might've took|one defensive swing against him.
{57558}{57634}I mean, honestly, what|the fuck, man? That was...
{57635}{57713}I don't know how you've lived|with yourself all these years.
{57714}{57740}It was pathetic.
{57741}{57826}It was pathetic. You couldn't|have kicked him from the ground?
{57827}{57909}What happened?
{57927}{57966}Uh...
{57967}{58046}This is a crazy story.|I got hit by a truck.
{58047}{58086}Yeah, yeah.
{58087}{58149}Trying to save a baby deer,|if you can believe that.
{58150}{58177}Oh, my God!
{58178}{58277}Is there anything that|I can do? Are you okay?
{58278}{58353}Oh, my God. No, I'm|fine. This is nothing.
{58354}{58412}You know what? Come with me.|I'm gonna take care of you.
{58413}{58446}And bring your friend.
{58447}{58473}No, we can't.
{58474}{58515}- We'd love to, but we can't.|- We can, we can.
{58516}{58565}We should probably go check|on that deer, actually.
{58566}{58633}No, we can go. We can go.
{58634}{58687}/I know you cannot wait
{58688}{58738}/Wait to see me, too
{58739}{58770}Oh, my God!
{58771}{58823}This is like the best song ever!
{58824}{58889}Maybe not ever.
{58890}{58930}/At the drive-in
{58931}{58972}God, he's so hot!
{58973}{59027}/In the old man's Ford
{59028}{59090}/Behind the bushes
{59091}{59128}Can I get 3,000 beers?
{59129}{59177}/Until I'm screaming for more
{59178}{59269}/Down the basement
{59272}{59324}Who's next? Who's next|for the beer luge?
{59325}{59380}This guy! This guy's|next! He wants it so bad.
{59381}{59499}- You can do it, man.|- He wants it.
{59500}{59589}Luge! Luge! Luge!
{59654}{59754}That was so lame. That wasn't,|like, even violent a little bit.
{59755}{59799}Who are you, and why|did you do that to me?
{59800}{59873}Why? Because you looked|like you needed a luge.
{59874}{59924}- I'm Adam.|- I'm April.
{59925}{59980}- How are you doing?|- All right.
{59981}{60020}What brings you here?
{60021}{60046}Hot tub.
{60047}{60073}Huh.
{60074}{60129}- You?|- Poison.
{60130}{60175}- Right.|- That band. Poison.
{60176}{60250}/I'm a journalist. I'm covering|/the band for Spin magazine.
{60251}{60288}You don't really look|like you're the type.
{60289}{60360}The Poison type? God, no.|I'm not. I'm really not.
{60361}{60411}I basically just got onto this bus
{60412}{60513}and it took me here,|to goddamn Winterfest.
{60514}{60565}Adam!
{60566}{60602}Whoo!
{60603}{60674}- You know what? I can't talk to you.|- You can't?
{60675}{60717}But I'm awesome. I can guarantee that.
{60718}{60782}I'm sure. You see, I have to walk|in the exact same footsteps.
{60783}{60827}This didn't happen.
{60828}{60909}- Well, it kind of happened.|- I wish it did.
{60910}{60937}- I just saw it happen.|- It really didn't.
{60938}{60983}Yeah. No, I contributed.
{60984}{61053}- I wish it did.|- All right.
{61054}{61121}See you.
{61201}{61288}I brought you some ice.|It'll make you feel better.
{61289}{61341}Let's see that.
{61342}{61468}- Feel better?|- That ice does make me feel better.
{61469}{61506}Butterflies.
{61507}{61576}Hey, you know what? I just|remembered I gotta meet a guy.
{61577}{61635}No, no. Wait.
{61636}{61686}No, you can't go.
{61687}{61728}'Cause guess what?
{61729}{61755}What?
{61756}{61820}I only do two at a time.
{61821}{61958}- What do you mean?|- What do I mean?
{61967}{62016}There those are.
{62017}{62064}Yeah, let's do this.
{62065}{62098}Him first? Okay.
{62099}{62162}It's your thing. I don't|wanna tell you what to do.
{62163}{62236}Hold on, I gotta get the phone.
{62237}{62277}Hello?
{62278}{62314}Mom?
{62315}{62368}- What?|- I wanna know what the doctor said.
{62369}{62428}Lou? Lou, we can't do this.
{62429}{62458}Yes, we can.
{62459}{62491}No, this didn't happen.
{62492}{62517}- We can't do this.|- Yes, we can.
{62518}{62558}- This didn't happen in the past.|- Yes, it did. Shut up.
{62559}{62604}This did not fucking happen in the past.
{62605}{62648}You shut the fuck up, please.
{62649}{62730}We're gonna make, like, Hitler president|or something. We can't do this.
{62731}{62820}Look, can you be fucking normal? Please?
{62821}{62871}Every young man's fantasy|is to have a three-way.
{62872}{62922}- Not with another fucking guy.|- It's still a three-way.
{62923}{62964}What about the policy of|the butterfly effect?
{62965}{63050}The butterfly effect can suck my nuts!
{63051}{63124}Look, we're gonna have|sex with this girl, okay?
{63125}{63190}You, me, together.
{63191}{63273}Enough of this queer shit.|Let's get the mood right.
{63274}{63328}- All right. Look, right there.|- What?
{63329}{63392}You don't wanna seem overzealous|with a full-on rager.
{63393}{63441}You don't want to insult|the woman, either.
{63442}{63512}You're gonna wanna get at least|a half-a-chub going, right?
{63513}{63548}- Look at me.|- No.
{63549}{63580}- Look at that.|- No.
{63581}{63700}- Look at how, like, perfect that is.|- I'm not gonna fucking look.
{63701}{63782}- Look, look. Here.|- What the fuck, man?
{63783}{63824}- I'm out of here.|- Come on, Jake,
{63825}{63866}- I was just getting you started.|- Don't care!
{63867}{63892}Guys do that.
{63893}{63940}No one does that!
{63941}{64020}Hey. Onesies?
{64046}{64088}Sorry.
{64089}{64204}Okay, cool. I'm out of here.
{64299}{64328}Hey.
{64329}{64408}How did it go with Jenny?
{64409}{64474}Oh, my God.
{64475}{64581}Oh, my God. Whoo! Why|aren't you dancing?
{64582}{64701}- Whoa! What's your name?|- That's Jacob. That's Jenny.
{64702}{64739}What the fuck are you doing?
{64740}{64776}- You're supposed to break up with her!|- I know.
{64777}{64860}No, no, no. Just check it out, okay?|Maybe she's the key to something.
{64861}{64923}And I messed it up when I|broke up with her before,
{64924}{64980}and now the universe is giving|me another crack at it.
{64981}{65048}And if you thought you|could really start over
{65049}{65127}and do something totally different,|you wouldn't even consider it?
{65128}{65160}You're absolutely right.
{65161}{65209}- You think so? Really?|- No. Fuck, no!
{65210}{65277}Come on!
{65306}{65337}What do you mean, you didn't do it?
{65338}{65373}I'm getting to it.
{65374}{65426}No, we were supposed to do|everything that we did.
{65427}{65488}- That's what I remember.|- Yeah, Adam, what the fuck, man?
{65489}{65517}You were supposed to fucking dump her.
{65518}{65576}You think I liked getting my ass|fucked up and down the entire street?
{65577}{65618}- Because I didn't.|- It's not that I'm not gonna do it,
{65619}{65657}I just haven't done it yet.|There's a big difference.
{65658}{65687}Look at my face, dude.
{65688}{65729}Look at my fucking face! Drink me in.
{65730}{65766}You think I wouldn't have|liked to have changed this?
{65767}{65794}Shut the fuck up, Lou.
{65795}{65848}You tried to rope me into a three-way.
{65849}{65874}- What?|- Did you?
{65875}{65903}- No.|- Yes.
{65904}{65938}Lou! Did you?
{65939}{66017}I didn't fuck that girl. Okay?
{66018}{66095}Because I'm committed to|not changing the past.
{66096}{66165}Right. It had nothing to do with her|wanting to be a Chinese finger trap.
{66166}{66214}And I'm not saying that|because she was Asian.
{66215}{66300}So you're telling me I cheated|on my wife for no reason.
{66301}{66326}Just relax, okay?
{66327}{66365}I'm gonna do it. I just|haven't done it yet!
{66366}{66391}You're unbelievable.
{66392}{66436}- Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?|- Yes.
{66437}{66481}Does this seem like it's|all about Adam again?
{66482}{66552}Yeah, just like Cincinnati.
{66553}{66593}- What?|- You gonna bring that up?
{66594}{66650}We said we weren't gonna talk|about Cincinnati ever, okay?
{66651}{66720}Is this why you have that shoebox in|your closet that says "Cincinnati"?
{66721}{66773}- Yeah.|- What? That's fucking admissible!
{66774}{66813}You keep it in the closet?
{66814}{66873}What was I supposed to do with|it? You can't bury those things.
{66874}{66913}And you wrote "Cincinnati" on it?
{66914}{66992}How do I know which one|it's supposed to be?
{66993}{67053}- Is it a fetus?|- My friends are ridiculous.
{67054}{67088}Why are we still talking about this?
{67089}{67134}Okay, we said we would|never talk about that.
{67135}{67215}By the way, where does it say in|the fucking friendship handbook
{67216}{67302}that you are the only one who is|allowed any fucking problems?
{67303}{67354}I forgot that it says|in the asshole handbook
{67355}{67422}that you can just fuck over|your friends whenever you want!
{67423}{67463}Actually, it would say that|in the asshole handbook
{67464}{67500}if it was, like, guidelines|for being an asshole,
{67501}{67537}- that's what it would say.|- Why wouldn't it say that
{67538}{67565}- in the asshole handbook?|- Yeah, it would say
{67566}{67595}- to fuck your friends.|- "Fuck over your friends."
{67596}{67629}- No, no, no.|- Have you ever read a book?
{67630}{67710}You're right. I'm sorry, my|bad. You guys are right.
{67711}{67768}But if you're changing|the fucking past, okay,
{67769}{67825}then I'm changing the|fucking past, all right?
{67826}{67862}No! Lou!
{67863}{67925}Okay! We're in the game! I like this.
{67926}{67969}I didn't change anything|yet, I just didn't do it.
{67970}{67998}And if we're changing shit,
{67999}{68046}you better be there at midnight|to get my fucking back.
{68047}{68081}- Done.|- I'll be there.
{68082}{68141}Guys! Guys! Come on, man.|Talk to me about this!
{68142}{68180}- Fuck off.|- Fuck!
{68181}{68213}- I'll be back in a minute.|- Where are you going?
{68214}{68284}- I gotta go. I'm getting out of here.|- No, no, Adam, listen to me, please.
{68285}{68343}Jenny Stedmeyer is not your|fucking destiny, okay?
{68344}{68373}She's just some girl.
{68374}{68424}Some girl you dated|in high school, okay?
{68425}{68465}I know! I just got some|emotions coming up.
{68466}{68497}I got some feelings that|I got to deal with.
{68498}{68547}I'm gonna do it. I believe|in you. You're awesome.
{68548}{68588}You know what? That's fine.|Everybody just take off!
{68589}{68617}I don't need to be born.
{68618}{68724}I'll just go find the repairman|myself and fix the time machine.
{68725}{68833}That's the dumbest thing|I've said in a while.
{68834}{68908}You made the best decision of your life,|choosing me as your friend over Adam.
{68909}{68945}I'm pretty sure that's|not what's going on here.
{68946}{68999}Don't be afraid. I'm|gonna treat you right.
{69000}{69040}- Daddy's gonna take care of you.|- Whoa!
{69041}{69066}Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
{69067}{69172}Here we go. It's like a|slow-motion guillotine.
{69173}{69269}What the F-ing fuck?
{69424}{69525}Here we go. Here we go. Round two.
{69526}{69699}- Should we help him?|- No. No. This is his destiny.
{69761}{69787}Fuck you!
{69788}{69889}- Did it happen?|- No.
{69913}{70001}If that guy doesn't lose his arm soon,|I'm gonna fucking take it from him myself.
{70002}{70060}Man!
{70138}{70176}Blaine!
{70177}{70228}Come on down, man. Have|a brewski with us.
{70229}{70254}There's a party.
{70255}{70329}"No foreign army has ever|occupied American soil.
{70330}{70373}"Until now."
{70374}{70411}/Watching Red Dawn again, or...
{70412}{70476}/Wolverines!
{70477}{70511}They're Ruskies.
{70512}{70560}And these are their|secret Commie weapons.
{70561}{70596}What are you talking about?
{70597}{70638}Look at this stuff, man.
{70639}{70713}They could be spies or something.
{70714}{70792}I don't know, Blaine. I mean, they seem|a little young to be spies, you know.
{70793}{70839}Come on, Chaz.
{70840}{70910}/They could be some|/kind of 21 Jump Street
{70911}{71013}spy battalion-type dudes.
{71014}{71104}Yeah. Yeah. Or not at all,|you know? There's also that.
{71105}{71165}What the fuck is this?
{71166}{71192}There's something I|wanna talk to you about.
{71193}{71249}It's something I'm supposed|to do but I don't wanna do.
{71250}{71279}- You know why?|- Okay, Adam. But...
{71280}{71366}Because I was thinking about|how good we are together, right?
{71367}{71420}- Don't you think? I really think so.|- Okay.
{71421}{71470}And I was talking about the|future and I was thinking about,
{71471}{71524}well, my future is this way|and maybe it could be this way.
{71525}{71576}I know I'm rambling now.|God, you're so beautiful.
{71577}{71612}But we got along so great and...
{71613}{71662}What is that?
{71663}{71728}It's a note I wrote to|you. You should read it.
{71729}{71778}- Right now? Okay.|- Yeah.
{71779}{71870}"Dear Adam, you're a|super-terrific guy and I love you.
{71871}{71905}Aw!
{71906}{71938}"And that's why this is so hard for me.
{71939}{72025}"You're one of the most amazing people|that I've ever met. I can't..."
{72026}{72116}Are you breaking up with me? That's|what this... This is a break-up note?
{72117}{72150}I'm sorry, Adam.
{72151}{72213}All these years! You stabbed me|in the eye with a fucking fork
{72214}{72252}and you were gonna|break up with me anyway?
{72253}{72306}- Is that what you're saying to me?|- I did what?
{72307}{72390}Why are you breaking up with|me? That's not how this works.
{72391}{72452}You're such a great guy and|you're gonna find the right girl,
{72453}{72493}but it's not me.
{72494}{72595}And everybody knows what a big|deal you're gonna be some day.
{72596}{72680}No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not anybody.
{72681}{72807}Adam, okay. It's not you, it's me.
{72808}{72870}I say that to you. You|don't say that to me.
{72871}{72923}That's not how this works.
{72924}{73010}Do you know what happens to|you if we don't go back?
{73011}{73064}- You end up with Billy Lavatino.|- I like him.
{73065}{73137}You may like him, but then you end up|pregnant with, like, trucker hips,
{73138}{73178}and you have a baby with Billy Lavatino,
{73179}{73230}and you're addicted to Weight|Watchers, you little bitch.
{73231}{73275}- What did you just call me?|- Take this fucking back!
{73276}{73370}Don't you... Jesus!
{73403}{73459}I don't get fat!
{73460}{73522}Gross!
{73586}{73660}If we're changing shit, we gotta|be taking advantage of shit.
{73661}{73719}- No.|- Mulligan.
{73720}{73753}- No mulligan.|- Come on!
{73754}{73794}- You had, like, five mulligans.|- Dude.
{73795}{73848}I'm not talking about|bad stuff, either, okay?
{73849}{73874}I'm just talking about good stuff.
{73875}{73963}/Like keeping Manimal|/on the air, you know?
{73964}{73994}Or preventing Miley Cyrus.
{73995}{74035}Preventing her from what?
{74036}{74066}Just preventing her.
{74067}{74199}/And there's the catch! First down!
{74261}{74309}Oh, shit!
{74310}{74369}- I know this game.|- Yeah?
{74370}{74417}Yeah. This is the|Denver-Cleveland playoff game.
{74418}{74532}- This is the fucking Drive, man.|- Yeah?
{74533}{74646}I know what we're gonna do.
{74728}{74802}Adam, hey. You're back. Awesome.
{74803}{74884}What's going on here?|Where are the guys?
{74885}{74924}- What's this?|- Read it.
{74925}{74989}"Dear Adam, you are a|super-terrific guy and I love you,
{74990}{75124}"which is why this is so hard for|me. I cherish our friendship."
{75125}{75165}She broke up with you?
{75166}{75231}And you still fucking|got stabbed in the eye?
{75232}{75281}Leave me alone. Get out of here.
{75282}{75322}What are you doing here?|You writing poetry?
{75323}{75369}Just leave me alone and|get out of here. No.
{75370}{75415}You're writing fucking break-up poetry.
{75416}{75492}All right, I'm writing|break-up poetry, okay?
{75493}{75531}Because my heart hurts.
{75532}{75585}- She stabbed me in my heart and my eye.|- Holy shit, you're wasted.
{75586}{75666}Look, I've had like two wine|kills, Captain Buzzcooler.
{75667}{75738}- God.|- You're fucked up.
{75739}{75808}"Jenny's eyes, like a gypsy's|lies Cut right through the night
{75809}{75865}"Now those eyes are another|guy's And I'm alone with my pain"
{75866}{75892}That was clean.
{75893}{75972}Are you shitting me with this, Adam?
{75973}{76037}/Look, you can recite it straight or|/to the tune of Sweet Child O'Mine.
{76038}{76065}It doesn't matter.
{76066}{76148}Are these mushrooms? Did you|eat these mushrooms, Adam?
{76149}{76209}I like to eat them, you|know? A couple of them.
{76210}{76258}Holy fuck, man, you gotta stay straight!
{76259}{76301}- You gotta help me get the guys back!|- Just relax.
{76302}{76345}You know, it's not always|about my emotional journey.
{76346}{76384}- It could be about yours.|- Put the coke down!
{76385}{76421}- God damn it, you little fucker!|- Give it to me!
{76422}{76573}Don't you fucking get it? I'm|not gonna be fucking born!
{76574}{76640}How much worse can it get?
{76641}{76693}What? The '80s?
{76694}{76742}New part shorted out another part.
{76743}{76787}I hope we can get that|thing working before dawn.
{76788}{76861}Wait, wait, hold on, is that when|the time portal closes, at dawn?
{76862}{76902}That's when the party's over.
{76903}{76931}Fuck you, man. Listen.
{76932}{76992}I am at my wit's end with him,|so you gotta level with me.
{76993}{77049}Are you the mystical|time-travel guide-guy or not?
{77050}{77131}Don't you put your|hands on me, young lady!
{77132}{77177}I'm just trying to do my job, here.
{77178}{77231}Fuck, hold on. Quit|eating mushrooms, man!
{77232}{77328}I wanna have a few more.
{77329}{77420}What the fuck is happening|to me? I can't...
{77421}{77481}Dawn.
{77538}{77565}Hey, Adam.
{77566}{77636}All right, so anyway, the|repairman's doing his thing.
{77637}{77703}I'm gonna go find Nick and Lou,|and you stay right here. Okay?
{77704}{77768}- I'm gonna stay.|- You got it, but you can't leave.
{77769}{77847}I can't move, because I'm broken.
{77848}{77945}Man, you and my mom are so fucked.
{77946}{78011}Hungry.
{78022}{78092}- Evening.|- You've got two arms.
{78093}{78152}But you're not going to.|You're gonna lose one.
{78153}{78261}- What?|- You're gonna lose that arm.
{78262}{78294}You're one of those joker guys.
{78295}{78322}Right. Right.
{78323}{78388}I don't care if you put that|arm in a steel fucking vault,
{78389}{78437}that arm's coming off!
{78438}{78504}- You're gonna lose your arm.|- You're gonna lose your arm!
{78505}{78589}- I'm gonna rape you. I'm gonna rape you!|- I'm gonna rape you. I'm gonna rape you.
{78590}{78641}- Have a great night.|- Okay.
{78642}{78743}/... to the end zone.|/Touchdown Cleveland!
{78744}{78789}Pay up, suckers! Pay up!
{78790}{78873}How does he do it? How is|he right all the time?
{78874}{78932}Let me ask you something, McFly.
{78933}{78965}How you getting so lucky?
{78966}{79017}I know the fucking future, douche bag.
{79018}{79057}Really? One more bet.
{79058}{79125}Ricky, come on. You said one|more and then you'd be done.
{79126}{79185}I also said to shut the|fuck up. Remember that?
{79186}{79234}Okay, I love you. Shut the fuck up.
{79235}{79265}By the way, I love your coat.
{79266}{79321}I don't give a shit about|animals, either, so...
{79322}{79357}One more bet. High stakes.
{79358}{79421}All right. All right.|Bring it on, Spader.
{79422}{79457}Bring it on, Jo-Jo.
{79458}{79552}I bet Elway throws a touchdown pass|with 37 seconds left on the clock.
{79553}{79609}Fat chance, asshole. Elway's|done nothing all day.
{79610}{79689}Well then, in the spirit of high|stakes, let's make it interesting.
{79690}{79717}Let's make it interesting.
{79718}{79813}If I win, your wife gives me a blowjob.
{79814}{79922}- Really?|- A classy one.
{79939}{79979}- Hey, screw you, kid.|- Hey, okay,
{79980}{80069}and if you win, name your price.
{80070}{80122}Touchdown pass at 37 seconds, exactly?
{80123}{80175}Exactly.
{80176}{80210}Fine.
{80211}{80246}You lose, I take all your winnings.
{80247}{80313}- Done.|- And you give your buddy a blowjob.
{80314}{80359}What? Hell, no.
{80360}{80386}Wow!
{80387}{80413}- Deal.|- Deal?
{80414}{80457}- Well done. I like your style.|- I like your style.
{80458}{80485}He's very creative.
{80486}{80547}I don't like you taking|liberties with my dick.
{80548}{80585}Relax, okay?
{80586}{80715}We know the fucking|future. We can't lose.
{80716}{80830}Hey. Hey, there. What are you doing?
{80831}{80885}- Hi.|- Hey.
{80886}{81018}Okay, how's the view from down there?
{81019}{81091}It's nice.
{81094}{81150}Adam, right?
{81151}{81179}Yeah.
{81180}{81245}- Why are you bleeding in the snow?|- That? No, I...
{81246}{81321}I got stabbed in the face with a fork.
{81322}{81397}I saw it coming and I avoided|it. I mean, I didn't avoid it.
{81398}{81478}It just happened again to me|in a slightly different way.
{81479}{81593}Boy, I really wish I knew what|the fuck you were talking about.
{81594}{81655}All the choices we make in|our life, they're pointless.
{81656}{81713}There's no escaping the inevitable.
{81714}{81805}I don't know, man.
{81813}{81903}So, you're saying that your whole|entire life is predetermined to suck,
{81904}{81931}no matter what you do?
{81932}{81969}It's not the way I want it, but...
{81970}{82033}Kind of seems like a|really, really good excuse
{82034}{82142}to do something totally|amazing right now, tonight.
{82143}{82187}Like what?
{82188}{82285}Like perhaps hang out with|a girl that you just met
{82286}{82355}before her bus has to|leave in two hours?
{82356}{82410}Right-o.
{82411}{82453}I thought you said we were|going to get some food.
{82454}{82526}We are. We're about to get some food.
{82527}{82592}I'm pretty hungry, actually.
{82593}{82650}Damn it. They forgot to leave the key.
{82651}{82678}Who did?
{82679}{82763}Carol and Stan Stapleton. They're|my friends. They live here,
{82764}{82834}and I housesit for them when|they go to Nepal, sometimes.
{82835}{82881}I thought you said you|came in here on a bus.
{82882}{82959}They usually do leave,|like, a side door open.
{82960}{83011}- They do?|- So let me... I'll be right back.
{83012}{83070}Okay.
{83071}{83165}Yep, it's unlocked.
{83230}{83272}Cheers.
{83273}{83371}So which one's Carol?
{83395}{83455}Carol's on the left.
{83456}{83515}/Elway's last stand. 45|/seconds left on the clock.
{83516}{83603}I'm really good at|getting head. You'll see.
{83604}{83640}/- Elway takes the snap.|- Go, baby.
{83641}{83723}/He fades back. Elway fires.|/He's got Jackson open.
{83724}{83767}/He's impossibly open!
{83768}{83810}/Wait, what's this? Vermin?
{83811}{83843}No, no, no! I know this squirrel.
{83844}{83892}That's a magic fucking|squirrel. This doesn't count.
{83893}{83946}/- He's distracted by a wild squirrel!|- What the fuck?
{83947}{84022}/Incomplete! Game's|/over! Cleveland wins!
{84023}{84075}/The Dawg Pound is|/going to the Super Bowl.
{84076}{84107}Oh, yeah!
{84108}{84174}/I've never seen anything like it!
{84175}{84240}- He did it. Got to go!|- Congratulations. Look at all that money.
{84241}{84318}I was kidding about the blowjob|thing. Obviously, we're comedians.
{84319}{84365}Hey, guys. Guys.
{84366}{84448}A bet's a bet.
{84461}{84535}Motherfucker!
{84536}{84567}So you're a Time Lord?
{84568}{84593}Mmm-hmm.
{84594}{84689}And a Jacuzzi is your spaceship?
{84690}{84721}That is correct, madam.
{84722}{84803}That's the only part of this whole|thing that doesn't make sense to me.
{84804}{84869}You're not the only one. Believe me.
{84870}{84938}I mean, the whole thing|is just totally insane.
{84939}{84994}Ew!
{84998}{85045}So, how's the future|working out for you?
{85046}{85114}I mean, are you like a happy grownup?
{85115}{85165}- Not particularly, no.|- Yeah.
{85166}{85301}My friends actually think I ended up being|a completely selfish, fucked-up person.
{85302}{85351}And they may have a point,|actually, if I think about it.
{85352}{85378}Hmm...
{85379}{85441}I'll tell you something I haven't|told somebody for a long time.
{85442}{85471}When I was a kid,
{85472}{85549}every Friday night, my father used|to take my sister Kelly and me
{85550}{85638}to this place called Flatirons|for steak sandwiches.
{85639}{85665}It was a family tradition.
{85666}{85713}That's sometimes a good thing.
{85714}{85789}But one year, we saw this commercial
{85790}{85867}for this place called The|Enchanted Forest of Pizza.
{85868}{85958}So the next Friday, my dad's|loading us up into the car.
{85959}{86033}We're like, "Daddy, we want to go|to The Enchanted Forest of Pizza."
{86034}{86076}And he's like, "What|are you talking about?
{86077}{86125}"We always go for steak sandwiches."
{86126}{86162}But we just stay at him
{86163}{86241}and we're whining, and we're|badgering, and finally he relents.
{86242}{86277}Nice. So, you win.
{86278}{86365}You deviated from the plan in|a really big way. That's good.
{86366}{86445}/33 people died of E. coli.
{86446}{86491}Including my father.
{86492}{86546}Before he died, he looked|at me and he said,
{86547}{86586}"Adam, you did this."
{86587}{86623}No, he didn't.
{86624}{86661}Yes, he did,
{86662}{86688}with his eyes.
{86689}{86755}I don't think that that's|what he meant with his eyes.
{86756}{86853}The point is that Kelly and I dealt with|the guilt of this in very different ways.
{86854}{86891}She went wild, right?
{86892}{86935}She didn't want to have|control over anything.
{86936}{86992}But I vowed to master the chaos,
{86993}{87035}- to impose order.|- Adam, I really don't think
{87036}{87137}that you can let a poison pizza|ruin the rest of your life.
{87138}{87209}You got to embrace the|chaos. You have to.
{87210}{87351}That way, life might just astonish you.
{87522}{87568}- I had so much fun tonight.|- I know!
{87569}{87651}Fuck! Game on.
{87660}{87717}- You look so hot, by the way.|- Thanks.
{87718}{87785}I said, start sucking, gaylord.
{87786}{87858}- Yeah! Suck!|- Suck that shit, man!
{87859}{87939}Suck! Suck! Suck!
{87940}{87983}Who are you people?
{87984}{88045}God, who are you people?
{88046}{88097}Let's get on with this.|My fondue's getting cold.
{88098}{88203}Choke on that horn, man!
{88224}{88255}Oh!
{88256}{88298}Wow, good for you.
{88299}{88325}I know, right?
{88326}{88390}It's like Gary Coleman's|fucking forearm.
{88391}{88441}It's so black!
{88442}{88532}It's so impossibly black.
{88533}{88582}- I love you, buddy.|- Don't say that!
{88583}{88637}I'm sorry, I do.
{88638}{88712}No, no, no!
{88966}{89023}Hey, you.
{89024}{89082}Maybe what you need|isn't in here, after all.
{89083}{89186}Maybe what you need has|always been in here.
{89187}{89271}- Really?|- No.
{89304}{89354}The tub? Is it fixed yet?
{89355}{89403}Can be. Ready to go?
{89404}{89435}Wait, go where?
{89436}{89486}To the room, check it out.|I've got the part right here.
{89487}{89515}Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
{89516}{89612}- Let's go.|- Right.
{89648}{89699}- Where did he go?|- Who?
{89700}{89771}This fucking guy.
{89772}{89842}Nicholas.
{89864}{89950}Nicky. Nicholas.
{89952}{90019}Hey! There he is!
{90020}{90055}- What?|- What the fuck?
{90056}{90114}What? What?
{90115}{90187}What, do I still have some on my face?
{90188}{90226}Oh, God!
{90227}{90283}Damn!
{90284}{90324}Did you have pineapple today?
{90325}{90391}I can't go home. What the fuck?
{90392}{90435}I'm fucking with you, dude.
{90436}{90495}It's hand soap.
{90496}{90551}Oh, my God. Relax.
{90552}{90636}It's like you haven't seen a little come on|your friend's face before, or something.
{90637}{90682}What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
{90683}{90754}I'm just kidding. It's|what friends do. God!
{90755}{90784}You didn't?
{90785}{90846}Gargle your hog? No, man.
{90847}{90899}After they pulled you off of|me, me and Rick talked it out.
{90900}{90936}He's actually a pretty cool guy.
{90937}{91026}We have a lot in common. We|both love tits and Mötley Crüe.
{91027}{91056}It's cool?
{91057}{91146}Yeah, I just told him a bunch of shit|that's gonna make him rich in the future.
{91147}{91203}I saved the good stuff for us.
{91204}{91341}Let's go to the bar, plan our empire.
{91383}{91470}Fucking iPods, you know? Fucking Prius.
{91471}{91560}Match. com. Anything. com.|Fucking Internet. com!
{91561}{91657}Fucking Zac Efron.|Nobody invented him yet.
{91658}{91736}What about Twitter?|Whatever the fuck that is.
{91737}{91870}Hey, we could combine|Twitter with fucking Viagra.
{91871}{91935}Twitt-agra.
{91936}{91972}What's the matter, dude? Come on.
{91973}{92061}I'm sorry, man. I'm just preoccupied.
{92062}{92138}You just kind of down about|being black and out of shape?
{92139}{92189}What the fuck is wrong with you? No.
{92190}{92231}Because you look good, you know?
{92232}{92286}This is a great time for black people.
{92287}{92346}I mean our time, not this time. This|is a terrible time for black people.
{92347}{92430}I don't see one other|black person in here.
{92431}{92467}Talk to me, man.
{92468}{92507}I found out she fucking cheated.
{92508}{92590}What? Courtney's|fucking cheating on you?
{92591}{92665}I gave her my life,|I gave up my passion.
{92666}{92698}And she's just out there...
{92699}{92747}Why the fuck didn't|you say something, man?
{92748}{92831}That's just it! I never|see you guys anymore.
{92832}{92906}I don't have my music,|I barely have friends.
{92907}{92950}Without Courtney,
{92951}{92978}I'm nothing.

{93144}{93178}- It's terrible.|- It doesn't work.
{93179}{93259}No. Nick Webber, that's who you are.
{93260}{93302}That's who I was.
{93303}{93355}Maybe you gotta find him again.
{93356}{93455}You know, she's getting|hers, you go get yours.
{93456}{93493}I can't, man.
{93494}{93534}It means something to me to be married.
{93535}{93582}You're not fucking married. It's 1986.
{93583}{93610}In my heart I am.
{93611}{93726}Your heart's a fucking liar.
{93866}{93936}You know what? You know|what you got to do?
{93937}{93974}What?
{93975}{94065}You gotta get your ass up on that stage.

{94744}{94850}Some sort of sticky liquid got into|the crossover housing, I don't know.
{94851}{94921}Must have had some nitratriminium in it.
{94922}{94956}It's Chernobly.
{94957}{95031}Whatever it was, it ravaged the|hell out of the electronics.
{95032}{95080}Worked out for you and the boys, though.
{95081}{95137}Wait, hold on, are you saying that|that's the key to the whole thing?
{95138}{95170}We need the Chernobly to get back?
{95171}{95267}All I'm saying is, whatever your|poison, I wouldn't tub without it.
{95268}{95328}Especially after dawn.

{104780}{104847}I was gonna let you drag me|down into your bullshit, Lou?
{104848}{104899}Yeah. Yes, because|that's what friends do.
{104900}{104935}No, they don't, man!
{104936}{104976}Because then there's two|people stuck in the bullshit
{104977}{105007}instead of your sorry ass.
{105008}{105190}You should stick by your|friends through thick and thin!
{105193}{105277}Okay, great. I got two|things to say to you.

{105479}{105516}All right, is that the first|thing or the second thing?
{105517}{105578}What? No, clearly that's|still part of the first thing.
{105579}{105612}- I mean, am I the asshole?|- Did you get that?
{105613}{105654}- No, I didn't get it. I thought...|- He didn't get it.
{105655}{105686}He said A and B...
{105687}{105744}Let's agree to disagree|about the "first" thing.
{105745}{105828}Lou, where is the Chernobly?|We need it to get back.
{105829}{105875}"Where's the Chernobly at, Lou?"
{105876}{105925}That's all you ever fucking care about.
{105926}{105962}It's the first time he mentioned it.
{105963}{106003}Yeah, and even if we|had mentioned it before,
{106004}{106072}it's kind of a fucking big|deal, okay? I wanna go home.
{106073}{106108}Come on, Lou. Let's|talk about this inside.
{106109}{106176}- You got no shoes on. It's cold out.|- Who took my fucking shoe?
{106177}{106237}Blaine apparently beat|your shoe off of you,
{106238}{106286}which I don't even know how|that could fucking happen.
{106287}{106384}Okay, fuck it! Fuck you,|fuck you and fuck you!
{106385}{106493}- Easy, man.|- Whoa, Lou!

{107749}{107807}- I'm sorry! Jesus!|- Thank you, Phil.
{107808}{107869}All right, here's the|second fucking thing, okay?
{107870}{107908}Blaine's got the Chernobly.
{107909}{107967}Let's just get it from him, so|we can get back to the present
{107968}{108080}so I can start never|seeing you bitches again.
{108081}{108115}- Hey, hey, hey, hey!|- Hey.
{108116}{108152}I was looking for you. Where'd you go?

{108614}{108675}- I want to.|- Good. Then come on.
{108676}{108772}But I can't because my friends need|me and I gotta show up for them,
{108773}{108811}so I really can't.
{108812}{108872}Okay.
{108873}{108940}So what are we... I mean, do we...
{108941}{108977}- What happens?|- I don't know.
{108978}{109017}I'm not really making any plans.
{109018}{109076}I'm just sort of letting the|universe surprise me, right?
{109077}{109135}I like that. I like that a lot.|That's the sign of a happy man.
{109136}{109165}April, let's go!
{109166}{109226}Shit.

{124386}{124501}I was trying to kill myself!
{124504}{124558}I know, man. That's why we came here!
{124559}{124678}If I go back, I'm just gonna|kill myself all over again, man.
{124679}{124731}- I can't.|- You're gonna stay?
{124732}{124767}Guys, let's go.
{124768}{124810}All right, well, if you're|gonna stay, I'm gonna stay!

{124849}{124915}We're best friends! If|you're staying, I'm staying!
{124916}{124971}Your bullshit's my bullshit, right?

{125061}{125119}- I'll take that!|- Where you going on me?
{125120}{125147}Thank you!
{125148}{125191}Oh, my God!
{125192}{125297}All right, man. Come on!
{126281}{126327}Holy shit.
{126328}{126513}This better be the last time|my ass travels through time.
{126911}{126952}Oh...
{126953}{127060}It is so good to see you.
{127061}{127113}/Are we rolling?
{127114}{127170}/Welcome back, bitches!
{127171}{127203}Is that Lou?
{127204}{127262}What took you so long?|All right, zoom out.
{127263}{127300}Yeah, that's a weird hair choice.
{127301}{127368}Uh-oh. Look what Daddy did.
{127369}{127423}He looks like a lion.
{127424}{127494}Oh, hi. Didn't see you there.
{127495}{127520}Here's a question.
{127521}{127595}Was it morally wrong for me to|exploit my knowledge of the future
{127596}{127642}for personal financial gain?
{127643}{127675}Perhaps.
{127676}{127711}Here's another question.
{127712}{127748}Do I give a fuck?
{127749}{127778}That's my father.
{127779}{127830}Hey, check out my girl.
{127831}{127879}You burned the fucking crab cakes again.
{127880}{127963}/No, I didn't burn them|/because I like them that way!
{127964}{128010}I fucking hate you, Louis.
{128011}{128062}I hate you, too, baby.
{128063}{128103}I love that woman, man.
{128104}{128144}Those are my parents.
{128145}{128187}But seriously, a lot has changed.
{128188}{128302}So, whatever happens,|stay the fuck calm.
{128303}{128413}It'll all make sense soon.
{128576}{128604}Good morning.
{128605}{128658}Holy shit, Phil, you got both your arms.
{128659}{128704}Oh. Yeah, I do.
{128705}{128734}That's incredible.
{128735}{128815}Yeah, what happened was|a snowplow came along
{128816}{128858}and it took my arm right off.
{128859}{128928}/But the ski patrol came|/along and they put it on ice.
{128929}{128990}Blaine and Chaz. Blaine|and Chaz saved his arm!
{128991}{129039}We got 15 minutes before|that thing dies, all right.
{129040}{129079}We're gonna put that back on you!
{129080}{129115}/I'm pretty happy.
{129116}{129143}It looks great.
{129144}{129203}Anyhow, I have instructions|on how to get home.
{129204}{129270}- We know how to get home.|- Yeah. We know...
{129271}{129343}Mr. Dorchen anticipated|that you might say that,
{129344}{129415}so I took the liberty of printing|up some Lougle maps for you.
{129416}{129463}- You mean "Google"?|- Lougle maps.
{129464}{129589}What's the matter with you guys?
{129592}{129619}Fuck me.
{129620}{129695}So, Phil, if you wanna|find, you know, like porno
{129696}{129767}or a restaurant review or anything|like that, you use Lougle?
{129768}{129802}Correct.
{129803}{129955}I bet he's on the Statue|of Liberty and shit, too.
{129956}{129999}You want me to go in there?
{130000}{130115}That's what it says on the map.
{130116}{130198}Call me later.

{131671}{131750}Baby, wait a minute. What|are you talking about?

{131792}{131867}First of all, I would|never screw around.
{131868}{131924}And you remember I told you|about that crazy wrong number
{131925}{131957}I got when I was nine.
{131958}{131995}- That man was so...|- I love you, Courtney.
{131996}{132039}I love you so much.

At alert level six,
W.H.O. guidelines for governments...
Your socks are so cute! I like them.
Police say they've seen similar cases recently
of people behaving strangely.
The U.N. health agency is not likely
to recommend official travel restrictions.
It's a little bit unsettling.
They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.
They think it's just gonna go away.
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.
Right on top of the man, beating him.
The man is bleeding.
Twenty-one confirmed cases.
All the talk about a doomsday is a big hoax.
The subject growled at him
and continued to maul the victim.
The best estimate is about 15,000 in the U.K.
We don't know if this is spreading.
Rhythms of change...
So far there's no manifestation.
Monitors have arrived, even carrying them...
With that much public at risk, we cannot...
They're trying to move us on, trying to tell the journalists to get out.
Wake up!
- Oh, creatures in our bed...
- No sleeping!
Oh, you're getting very big.
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!
We got a lot more sunshine today.
You have to only say one word.
Hey, by the way, what do you want for your birthday?
Say a puppy.
A puppy.
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?
Because that we can do.
Scusi.
Good morning.
That looks yummy.
She gets the bigger one?
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.
Did you pack your, um, inhaler?
Bathroom sink.
- In a minute?
- Scootch! Go.
The government has declared martial law.
Daddy, what's martial law?
Uh...
Martial law is like house rules, but for everybody.
Were you ever in places like that with your old job?
Mmm-hmm.
But I quit my old job so I could be with you.
Do you miss it?
No, I like my new job.
All you do is make pancakes in the morning!
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.
Look who I found!
- Oh!
Here comes the number 12 train!
It's not Subway Sam, is it?
You want more pancakes?
Good.
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!
- At least...
- Move it on out.
Hey! Plates in the sink!
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!
Uh... Does it live in the jungle?
Oooh.
No.
Do you eat it on Sundays?
No.
Does it live on the Great Plains of Africa?
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.
Do people keep it in pens all its life and harvest it for meat?
- That's really gross!
- Gross!
Dad!
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?
- Yes.
Ha ha ha.
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.
- You totally got one!
Why are there so many?
It's like, three in the last five minutes.
- What is going on?
The World
Health Organization has been
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies
that began in Taiwan and has now been reported in over 12 countries.
Responding to allegations he hasn't done enough to prevent the spread...
Can we try BBC?
You're not British anymore, baby.
You lost your accent a long time ago.
Except after two bottles of wine.
Am I British?
Yeah, your grandma is.
- Hey!
- Yo!
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?
Hold on, guys.
Daddy, be careful on the road.
It's okay, baby.
Can be transmitted between species
commonly from a bite from an infected animal.
Our best recommendation is to stay away from densely populated areas.
Hey, yo! You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?
No, man, I don't know anything.
It's crazy.
Gerry?
Get back in your car right now!
Remain with your ve...
What are we doing?
That's our way out of here.
I want my blanket!
Baby, it's packed right now.
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?
My blanket!
Rach?
Rachel, baby, you've got to get back in your seat.
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!
Rachel, right now!
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!
- You okay?
- You okay?
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.
We should get out.
Everybody out of the car.
We've got to get out of the city.
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.
Out of the way!
Move it!
Come on, honey. Come on.
Sweetheart, are you okay?
Let's go. Let's get off the street.
What is that, Gerry? What is that?
I don't know!
Get to the RV.
Subway Sam!
Here comes the number 12 train! One.
Two.
- What's happening?
- Three.
Four.
- Five.
Six.
Seven.
- Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Train's in the station!
Gerry!
- Watch out!
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!
Containment is a fail.
- Try to relax.
Give yourself air.
In and out.
- Come on, baby, try to relax.
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.
Where's her spare?
I'm gonna go check your backpack, all right?
Do you want to be with her?
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.
Hey, hey, you breathe through your nose.
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be all right.
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.
We gotta move.
Okay.
Good. Good. Look.
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.
No, no, no, no...
You're gonna be all right.
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.
It's Thierry.
Where are you?
Airborne.
Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.
It's all gone. We barely made it out.
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What is this?
We don't know. How close were you?
Face to face.
Good, honey, good.
Daddy.
Connie, give me that.
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.
Where are you?
95, heading north.
- Okay. Okay.
All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.
I'll call you back with an extraction point.
Can you hold out for another hour?
Do we have a choice?
This is not for old time's sake, my friend.
I'll need you.
I need you back.
Don't forget about us.
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?
All right. Good luck, Gerry.
Okay.
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.
Take my hand.
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.
I'll meet you back here.
Stay close, honey.
What do you need?
Albuterol.
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.
Thank you.
- Daddy!
- Connie?
Daddy!
- Connie?
- Daddy!
- Where's Mommy?
- Gerry!
Gerry!
Karin?
- Karin?
- Gerry! Gerry!
Get off of me!
Get off of me! That's all I have.
- Gerry!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Gerry.
Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.
Please, send units.
We're falling back on Reed Street.
Two Robert
12, units need backup.
Mobile ops is down. Please respond.
Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.
- Girls!
- Responders, Code 3, Code 3.
Rachel, quick, come on.
No.
No!
We got to get out of here.
We got to get off the street.
Gerry.
Apartments?
Hey. Yeah.
- Gerry?
- We're in Newark.
We're stranded.
Apartment buildings, 23rd.
If we can get to the roof, can you get someone to us?
- Not tonight.
- When?
The earliest would be sunrise.
Sunrise.
Tell him I got flares.
We'll be on the roof with flares.
Listen, Gerry, I will move mountains to get you out here.
- Come here, baby.
Go! Go! Go!
- Baby, in here!
- Come on. Quick!
Gerry!
Inside, girls!
By the stairs. Inside, inside!
Wait!
Wait.
Up, up. It's okay, baby.
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!
Go!
Go!
Keep running, baby.
- It's all right.
- To the top.
Go! Go!
Go!
Run!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
I need a new flare!
This asshole's about to get through!
Where's Connie? Connie?
- Connie?
- Connie!
- Let me in!
- Connie!
- Baby?
- It's not her. It's not her.
- Let me in!
- Connie!
Let me in!
In, in, in! In!
Thank you so much.
- I'm Tomas.
- Hey, Tomas.
My mom's cooking everything before it starts to stink.
That's smart.
You guys all right?
It's all right.
It's okay.
Are you guys hungry?
Yes, thank you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You want some juice?
The following message
is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.
Authorities recommend that the following actions
should be taken by all the members of the public.
Stay indoors if at all possible.
Have enough food and water supplies for sheltering
for one to two weeks.
The following message is transmitted at the request
of the New Jersey State
Police Department.
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly
spreading across the state of New Jersey.
She was crying.
Hmm.
Thanks, Tommy.
I used to work in dangerous places and people who moved survived, and those who didn't...
Movement is life.
You have a better chance if you come with us.
You need anything else before you leave?
Okay. Come on. Come on.
We should have left with them.
There is nowhere to go.
What's going to happen when the food is gone?
Okay, come on.
I'm scared.
Connie, there's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
Keep your eyes on Mommy and Daddy, okay?
Be ninja quiet.
Just a walk in the park.
How do we know they're coming?
They're coming.
Ready?
- Okay, come on, guys.
Come on! Come on!
Up, up, up.
Come on, baby.
Go, go, go!
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!
Go, girls! Gerry!
Come on. Gerry!
Girls, get back!
Watch out!
- Go!
- Go, go, go!
Come on, faster, girls!
Lieutenant, I've got no contact.
I say again, no contact.
Let's go, let's go!
Karin!
- Karin!
- Yeah.
Go through the door!
Gerry?
There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.
That's our target! Get us down!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.
Daddy!
Gerry?
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!
Baby! No!
One thousand seven.
One thousand eight.
Daddy, get off the edge!
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.
One thousand eleven.
I got it in my mouth.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Go! Go!
Come on. Come on.
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, let's go! We got to go!
You got her?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.
Heading 250. Turn right, heading 075, once clear.
Remain below 4,000.
Clear to land, heading 040, wind 060 at five.
Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.
Gerry.
Thank you.
Good to see you, my friend.
Tango five, this is Argus command.
Cleared for take-off.
Tango five. Wilco.
Karin, to the right.
This is good, right?
Bunk beds!
Your bunk beds are number two, three and six.
Please make yourself at home.
You want to get up here?
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.
We're not dropping anchor again.
You're safe.
It's not me I'm worried about.
They're safe.
Baby.
It's bigger than our old apartment on 72nd.
Need anything, Karin?
Water.
I'll organize.
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.
Okay.
The President is dead.
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.
Reports of gun battles in the streets of the capital.
Your parties are panicking.
The bigger cities are the worst off.
The airlines were the perfect delivery system.
Carnival cruise vessel Dream has been given permission to join.
Twenty seven knots south and closing.
How soon are they showing symptoms after contact?
The provisional government currently considers northern Minnesota to be a potential safe zone.
Have you recorded any instance where a person was bitten but not infected?
How the hell do I know if Russia's fallen?
Sir, I cannot action that order.
Colonel, I'm sorry, but we cannot facilitate an evacuation for you or your men.
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.
Malnutrition. Dirty water.
No gas for the winter or transportation.
No bullets to fight.
And it has spread to all corners of the globe.
The question that we have got to address is what the hell is it?
About 5% of the population aren't affected immediately.
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.
And like any virus, once we find its origin, we can develop a vaccine.
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.
Virologist from Harvard.
The analogy I keep coming back to is Spanish Flu.
Spanish Flu?
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920, it killed 3% Of the world.
He's our best bet at figuring out what this thing is.
You all read the same email I did,
- and it said "zombies."
Are you completely out of your mind?
So, the earliest mention of the word "zombie" was in a memo from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.
We haven't had contact with them since.
But this could lead us to the origin.
If we knew where this thing started, then we'd have a chance of developing a vaccine to stop it.
So we send in Dr. Fassbach there to look for the source.
He's just a kid.
You're right.
Attention on deck!
At ease!
Mr. Under-Secretary.
The Under-Secretary here says you were his best investigator when you were at the U.N.
I want to send you in. With a team.
Help Dr. Fassbach find whatever it is he needs.
You brought...
I wanted for the circumstances to speak for themselves.
No.
Captain, I'm not your guy.
You were on the ground during the Liberian Civil War.
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.
Gerry, a handful of SEALs will go with you as security force.
No.
My guys will get you in, you assist the doctor, pursue any leads, my guys will get you out.
We do the heavy lifting.
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.
Each and every one of these people are here because they serve a purpose.
There's no room here for non-essential personnel.
There's a long line of people waiting for one of those bunks.
You want to help your family, let's figure out how we stop this.
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.
Simple.
You don't work for them anymore.
- Karin...
- You might not remember
What this job did to you, but I do.
So do not ask me to say yes to this.
I have to go.
They're going to kick us off the ship.
What?
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy, have a place to stay.
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?
Men like Thierry aren't in charge of anything anymore.
You keep this with you.
I'll call in once a day.
As long as I make that call, everything's gonna be okay.
I'm coming back.
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.
As we do.
Like we do.
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.
I'm not a baby.
Okay.
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.
I'll be back soon.
Yeah?
All right, tough guy...
Take care of the ladies for me?
Yeah.
Deal.
You're awesome.
Daddy's coming back.
This way, sir.
Look.
We don't know what we're walking into.
So we do what they say. Okay.
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.
If things were to get crazy, just focus on their boots, focus on their voices, and we'll be all right.
- Mmm-hmm.
- These guys are hammers.
And to hammers, everything looks like nails.
I heard that.
You were meant to.
So, you see something that's important, you call it out and we'll make it happen.
Okay.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna find something.
Mother Nature is a serial killer.
No one's better.
More creative.
But like all serial killers, she can't help the urge to want to get caught.
What good are all those brilliant crimes if no one takes the credit?
So she leaves crumbs.
Now, the hard part, why you spend a decade in school, is seeing the crumbs for the clues they are.
Sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus, turns out to be the chink in its armor.
And she loves disguising her weaknesses as strengths.
She's a bitch.
Attention
D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,
D.C. has gone dark.
The Capitol evacuation has been suspended.
All available resources should be directed to Naval Station Norfolk.
All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status and in groups A through E
need to report to the flight deck for relocation.
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando
should be on the stern clear of the landing zone.
I say again, all non-essential personnel given F-6 status
need to report to the flight deck.
Choppers are inbound for immediate relocation.
Mommy, is this dinner?
Yes, sweetheart.
Water here tastes funny.
It's jet fuel, young lady.
He's joking.
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.
Probably because there's too many people on this ship.
Everybody wake up.
We're on approach to Camp Humphreys.
Most of the base is dark, and no one is manning the tower.
We're running on fumes, so there's really no choice,
I've got to put us down.
So buckle up.
Hold up.
Keep your finger off the trigger.
Okay.
Fassbach! Wait!!
Damn it.
Move back!
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.
What is this? What happened to him?
He slipped. He's dead.
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Okay, I'm good!
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.
I want an ammo count, then you reload your mags!
Yes, sir!
My boy who just died out there was 23.
He was 23.
You want to tell me why?
Because the guy who just shot himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.
What are you talking about?
He was supposed to be our best hope.
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.
He didn't have to, you know.
None of them did.
We're still trying to figure out what the hell this thing is.
Well, shit happens.
The doctor would have strongly agreed with you.
How do we go about refueling?
When I say so. And very carefully.
The noise, are they drawn to it?
Yeah. Sound draws them.
Body shots only seem to slow them down.
Head shots do the trick, but just to be safe we tend to burn them when we can.
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.
Bad?
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?
Detroit?
Guys, I'll be honest with you,
I don't know of any place back home that's doing very well.
All right...
If the other guy was a virologist, what do you do?
There was a memo sent from this installation 11 days ago.
It had the word "zombie" in it.
Do you know anything about it?
Yeah.
It was an email, not a memo.
Pretty obvious nobody back home bothered to read it.
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten trying to get this man handcuffed to the cot.
Now, our colonel said he was the first one.
This colonel, is he around?
Oh, yeah. He's right here.
The guy who's shackled, do you know who bit him, what bit him?
He was the base doctor.
He'd just returned from the field.
He'd been sent out to verify the death of a soldier
who had just gone AWOL the week before.
Some villagers had found this guy
foaming at the mouth, oozing some kind of black tar.
Then he tried to bite one of them.
They shot him, tied him up, threw him in a barn.
That's all we know, except the doctor comes back here and begins attacking his patients.
This soldier, do you know where he came from?
No.
Anyone he might have come in contact with?
No.
There's got to be records.
You are welcome to take a look if you want.
Then the origin could have come from anywhere.
It's a shame you had to fly all the way out here to figure that out.
How did you all escape this?
The expenditure of ammunition.
Is that how you tweaked your leg?
No, shit's been bugging me a while.
This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them turn Zeke all at the same time.
But they got no time for OI' Dirty Bastard here.
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.
Got no time for his lucky ass.
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?
The ones I saw bitten turned in 12 seconds. Same here?
Five or 10 minutes.
Yeah, Davidson went and he turned in 10 minutes.
"Stevie?"
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"
Who's that?
Waste no time on that freak.
He's C.I.A.
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.
Davidson, he turned in 10 minutes.
That doesn't sound viral to me at all, sports fans!
You're with the C.I.A.?
But they're not with me.
And who are you?
Oh, my God!
Captain, put on the World Music!
The day is saved!
Why'd you sell guns to the North?
Why not?
Are they surviving this?
Indeed they are.
Using your guns.
Guns are half-measures.
How then?
All right.
They took away the Zekes' exponential power.
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million in less than 24 hours.
The greatest feat of social engineering in history.
It's brilliant.
No teeth, no bite.
No great spread.
Bullshit.
More books, fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.
Now, why do you have to burn them to ashes to get them to finally stop?
Why do they move like a plague?
Why is Israel winning?
How is Israel winning?
They sealed off their entire country days before the undead attacked man.
First to know, first to act.
People have been building walls there for two millennia.
Mmm. Right. Yeah, but, finish all those thousands of years of work a week ago?
Impeccable timing is all.
You want answers?
Jurgen Warmbrunn.
That's the man in Jerusalem you want to see.
You ever seen anything like that?
Hell, no.
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.
Oh, hang on.
Hang on. Hang on a minute.
- Hello?
Gerry?
- Honey?
- Gerry, can you hear me?
Karin?
Hello?
- God damn it!
Give me your hand.
No way. No.
My mother. Dallas.
Probably pacing a hole in the floor right now if she's still there.
Better chance of you seeing her before me, that's all.
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.
Better the devil you know than the one you don't.
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.
Make sure Maverick here keeps the nose of that plane pointed towards the sun.
Just remember, don't lock the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.
Tell me 10 more times.
- You good?
- Right here.
All right. Don't rush.
We've got one chance to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.
If you ain't a crack shot, don't aim for the head, just get Zeke on the ground.
Remember, "Spine's divine, those knees they work just fine!"
Let's go, lights out!
Alpha in position.
Bravo moving out.
Remember, these things are drawn to sound.
So I need you close to target before I bring you the truck.
Now there's only one way we're getting you on that plane,
and that's quietly.
- Shit!
God damn it!
Shut that thing off!
Looks like we just woke the dead.
Out of respect for others,
please turn off all pagers and cell phones.
We got to move.
We've got to get out of here, let's move!
Go, go, go!
Whoo!
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!
You pedal like hell!
Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.
It's all right, boys.
I got this one.
- God damn it.
- We got enough!
We need to detach the fuel line!
Israel better pay off.
All right, I have instrument, but only on single prop.
You'll have to talk me through it.
Okay, we're clear.
Okay. Give me all the lights.
Switch on the anti-icing.
- Where?
- The red knob.
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.
Flaps 15.
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!
Make it steep.
- Gerry?
- Hi, baby.
Hi. Hi.
I tried to call you.
I know, I was...
It was bad timing, I was running around.
Are you okay?
Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.
That's the spirit.
Yeah.
Listen,
Korea didn't work out.
Now it looks like we're gonna have to go to Israel.
Try to get some rest on the flight.
How are the kids?
Um...
I think...
They're really... They're good.
I got Connie right here.
Baby?
Attention, unidentified aircraft.
You are in a restricted airspace and not clear for landing.
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.
Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.
Contact Mossad, office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.
The problem with most people is that
they don't believe something can happen until it already has.
It's not stupidity or weakness.
It's just human nature.
How did you know?
Gerald Lane.
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad about his employer, the U.N., back in 2010.
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.
Thought you'd have parlayed those ripples into a self-righteous book.
No nose for profit.
How did Israel know?
We intercepted a communique from an Indian general saying they were fighting the Rakshasha.
Translation, zombies.
Technically undead.

Described as sober, efficient, not terribly imaginative.
And yet you build a wall because you read a communique that mentions the word "zombie"?
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe they could be sent to concentration camps.
In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be massacred in the Olympics.
In the month before October 1973, we saw Arab troop movements, and we unanimously agreed they didn't pose a threat.
Well, a month later, the Arab attack almost drove us into the sea.
So we decided to make a change.
A change?
The Tenth Man.
If nine of us look at the same information and arrive at the exact same conclusion, it's the duty of the tenth man to disagree.
No matter how improbable it may seem, the tenth man has to start digging on the assumption that the other nine are wrong.
And you were that tenth man.
Precisely.
Since everyone assumed that this talk of zombies was cover for something else,
I began my investigation on the assumption that when they said "zombies," they meant zombies.
Was patient zero from India?
That's the problem.
There's so many potential sources in play that no one knows where it began.
The organ trade in Germany.
Strange examples of violent behavior across the Asian peninsulas.
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps spreading, and we do what we can.
These are the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.
Two of 10 portals through the security perimeter into fortified Israel.
You're letting people in.
Every human being we save is one less zombie to fight.
It's okay.
If I could get into India, where would I start? Who would I speak with?
India's a black hole.
Forget about patient zero.
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.
All you can do is find a way to hide.
Get troops down there.
It's too loud! It's too loud!
They're coming over the top!
- Shit!
Command, we have a breach at Salvation Gate.
They're coming over the wall!
Get him to Jaffa Gate.
She'll get you out of here, she'll get you to your plane!
Stay low!
Wrong way! Wrong way!
Go to landing point B.
Roger, we are inbound to landing point B.
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.
Hawk 5. Hawk 5, you're patched in. Over.
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.
The city is breached, and they're heading towards the airport.
- One thousand one.
One thousand two.
One thousand three. One thousand four.
- One thousand five.
One thousand six.
One thousand seven.
One thousand eight.
We got to move.
You'll be all right.
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!
We got to move.
- We got to move!
5 going down.
Chopper 5 is down.
I say again, chopper 5 is down.
L.Z. is overrun.
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.
Tower to 394.
Proceed to runway four.
Good luck out there.
No!
There! That one!
Stop. Stop.
Go! Go!
Get them out of here!
Stay calm, please.
Stay calm.
Come on. Go, go, go.
What's your destination?
I don't know. We were headed here, but I don't know.
I'm Gerry, by the way.
Segen.
Segen.
First or last?
Just Segen.
So, what we're doing, we've got to change this bandage and we're gonna clean it.
Okay?
You okay? Okay?
Okay.
Come on, gut up. Gut up.
Here we go.
We're almost there.
Okay. Big breaths.
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.
Here we go.
Come on. Good.
Last step. Last step.
Big breath.
Good job. There it is. Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.
Very good. Okay.
You a doctor?
No.
I've had some training in the field.
How did you know?
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?
I didn't.
Now I'm just a liability.
This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them
turn Zeke all at the same time.
Is that how you tweaked your leg?
No, shit's been bugging me a while.
Got no time for his lucky ass.
Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.
And sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus
turns out to be the chink in its armor.
I don't have answers.
All you can do is find a way to hide.
Gerry?
Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?
I love you. I'm sorry.
But you've got to get Thierry now.
I'll find him.
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.
Gerry needs you. I love you.
Gerry? Where are you?
On the last flight out.
Listen, my phone is dying and I need some quick intel.
You gotta locate the closest medical research facility.
A C.D.C., a W.H.O., something that makes vaccines.
- And the closest airport to it.
- I don't understand.
No time to explain.
Just make it happen, man.
Okay, okay.
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.
Well, go and find out what he needs.
You're gonna want to take this.
Take it.
Your battery is dead.
We made contact with Cardiff Airport, Wales.
Your people directed us.
There is W.H.O. research facility nearby, but they are not sure it's still operational.
This is location.
Can we make it?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain.
I'm glad to report that we are on our final approach
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.
All European airports are under lockdown.
But we have been given priority status and cleared for landing.
We will be allowed to disembark.
We are very, very lucky.
Hey. Who do you belong to?
What's there?
- What is it?
You... Bags.
We need trolley and bags.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.
Emergency descent!
Prepare for impact.
Got to move.
Come on, come on.
Give me something good.
Sir, Cardiff Airport lost contact with the plane.
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.
Chopper inbound for immediate relocation.
I say again.
All non-essential personnel given F-6 status
need to report for immediate relocation.
Ma'am?
Thierry would like a word with you.
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.
He's a resourceful man. There's every chance he could have survived.
Sir, I gave him my word we would look after his family.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Okay. Let's go. We're good.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You're a tough bastard.
And a lucky one.
Who are you?
I came here with a... With a woman.
Is she still...
Who are you?
Why have you come here?
Why do you keep looking at him?
'Cause he's the one in charge.
You know what this place is?
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.
Then you understand how this must look to us.
This is important to you?
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.
Give me the phone.
Just give me the phone.
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!
As soon as you answer my question.
Call it.
Call the number, they'll tell you who I am. Call it.
Gerry?
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- My God.
We thought you were dead.
Gerry, where are you?
Thierry, I'm with a couple of nervous gentlemen.
They need some bona fides before I can speak with you.
Of course.
This is Thierry Umutoni.
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.
To whom am I speaking?
Where's Karin?
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?
I'm sorry, Gerry.
I did what I could.
What does that mean?
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.
You're going to hurt yourself.
You're okay.
His family has been sent to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.
I'm sure they'll be safe.
Are you? Thierry told you who I am and what I used to do, right?
Yeah.
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.
I understand how you feel.
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.
Do you have a family?
- No.
- No.
Then you couldn't possibly understand, could you?
I lost my son and wife in Rome.
Rather, I lost my son to something that had once been my wife.
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.
In your case, there is hope at least.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Now, why did you come here?
What do you need from us?
Your worst disease.
He wants a what?
Deadly pathogen.
With a high mortality rate.
- But curable.
- Okay, well...
You'd want a bacteria rather than a virus,
I would think. Typhus?
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.
Rocky Mountain Fever.
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?
Mr. Lane believes we can use such a disease against the undead.
I would give you points for originality, Mr. Lane, if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.
One of the many things a virus or bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.
A functioning circulatory system.
I'm afraid it boils down to one simple fact...
You can't make a dead person sick.
It's not for them.
It's for us.
I believe these things have a weakness.
And that weakness is weakness.
- Our weakness.
I have witnessed them literally bypass people.
Walk right around them like a river around a rock. Why?
I think, because those people were sick.
I think they were terminal.
And these things could sense it.
I think they're spreading a pathogen, and they need a healthy host.
But even if you're right, I mean, infecting the populace with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.
It's camouflage.
There's a natural precedent.
Hungry predators will avoid diseased bodies.
Equipped with the right pathogen, our troops would be essentially invisible to the enemy.
You understand the only way to prove this theory of yours is for some idiot to infect themselves with a lethal pathogen and then...
...meet with her, face to face.
Yes.
Do we have what we need to try it?
We have all he could want.
Typhus, H1N1, SARS.
The problem is, they're all stored in B-Wing.
What's the matter with B-Wing?
Dr. Spellman.
Our chief vaccinologist.
Within hours of the outbreak, he'd been sent blood samples to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.
Unfortunately...
This is B-Wing now.
God damn it.
How many?
How many are there?
There were 80 people working there.
I've never seen them move like that.
They're dormant.
They're awaiting stimulus.
Now, this is vault 139.
That's where your samples would be.
This is the skybridge.
That connects B-Wing to the main building here.
And this, is the only thing standing between us and the skybridge.
So, what do you propose, Mr. Lane?
You are not serious.
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.
We don't even know if his theory is correct.
Well, I know I'm not asking one of you to take him there.
Each has its merits.
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.
Let's go.
Try not to kill one.
It only makes the rest of them more aggressive.
Yeah.
You sure you want to do this?
Of course I'm not. Let's go.
Good luck.
See you all shortly.
Good luck.
If anything comes down this hall before we do, you seal these doors for good.
Understood?
- Okay.
There they are.
Go, go.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on!
They're fine. They're fine.
Shit.
The vault we need is in 139.
Go!
Oh, my God.
Left, left, left!
What are you doing?
She'll get you to the vault.
That's the vault.
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.
We can't make it. Let's go!
They're not gonna make it.
You heard what Javi said, we cannot open it.
They're not alone, we can't open it!
They are coming back!
We can't leave them there.
Come on!
Open the door!
- Run!
- Run!
Run! Faster, come on!
Run!
In, in, in!
Come on!
Now where is Gerry?
Where is he, where is he, where is he?
Come on, come on, where are you?
5-6-9-6-4.
What happened to Gerry?
Not that one. Not that one.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Jesus.
He's going to inject himself.
We have no idea which one's going to work.
We don't know if any of them will work.
If he uses anything he took from that left case, he's dead anyway.
What's he doing?
How long does he have to wait?
Before he's infected? Not long, but, that's not the question we're really asking, is it?
Look at them.
He just walked right past him!
He walked right past him!
- Like it was nobody!
Okay.
This isn't the end.
Not even close.
Hi, there. This is...
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?
Hello. I'm trying to get in contact with anyone.
We've had some luck finding people with this transmission.
We've lost entire cities.
When there's no more people left to infect,
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.
The World Health Organization
reports today that help may soon...
...a hybridized meningitis strain
with components of smallpox and H1N1.
We still don't know how it started.
The World Health
Organization has created
a vaccine that works as a kind of camouflage,
making people who receive it invisible to the infected.
We bought ourselves some time.
Volunteer forces are delivering the vaccine
to areas that have been cordoned off.
Distribution efforts began in earnest on April 10th...
The importance of getting the information
out to those still alive within the quarantine...
But it's given us a chance.
If you can get to a colder area,
to higher ground, they move slower on the ground.
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.
Initial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.
Others have found a way to push back.
Move, move!
All right, juice 'em up!
Approaching target.
Permission to engage.
Permission granted.
All clear.
Light 'em up. Light 'em up.
It's permanent!
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!
There's no forgiveness in hell!
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!
This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.
If you can fight, fight.
Head north if you can.
Hello?
Is there anyone out there hearing this?
Help each other.
Mexico City has been declared a complete loss.
Be prepared for anything.
Our war has just begun.
Damn it, man! That was our ride!
You just stunned our ride!
Oh, great.
Run!
What the hell did you take?
I have no idea, but they were bowing to it.
Kirk to Shuttle One.
Locals are out of the kill zone.
You are clear. Repeat.
Spock, get in there, neutralize the volcano and let's get out of here.
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat.
Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you?
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.
The Prime Directive clearly states there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations.
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running through the jungle wearing a disguise!
Now drop off your super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!
You're good.
If we're gonna do this, we've got to do it now!
This ash is killing our coils.
You sure you don't want me to go instead?
That would be highly illogical as I am already outfitted...
Spock, I was kidding.
You got this.
Guys! We have to go! Now!
They're trying to kill us!
They're trying to kill us, Jim!
I'll see you in 90 seconds.
Raising shield 2. Mark 7.
Do it, do it!
Prerequisite change, 2-7-3.
Reduce descent. I repeat...
I can't hold this position.
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.
Negative. This is our only chance to save this species.
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.
Pull him back up. Now!
Spock, are you okay?
I am, surprisingly, alive.
Stand by.
We have to get him back.
I'll suit up.
I'm gonna go down.
We have to abandon the shuttle.
We can't just leave him, Sulu!
We don't have a choice!
Uhura, I'm sorry.
Spock, we're going back to the Enterprise.
We'll get you out of there.
Captain,
I'm ditching the shuttle.
You've got to make it to the
Enterprise on your own.
Wonderful!
Uhura! You ready to swim?
I'm ready.
Jim!
Jim!
The beach is that way!
I know!
We're not going to the beach!
Oh, no, no, no!
I hate this!
I know you do!
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean?
We've been down here since last night!
The salt water's gonna ruin the...
Scotty! Where's Spock?
Still in the volcano, sir.
Captain on the bridge!
Lieutenant, do we have an open channel to Mr. Spock?
The heat's frying his comms, but we still have contact.
Spock?
I have activated the device, Captain.
When the countdown is complete, the reaction should render the volcano inert.
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!
Negative, sir. Not with these magnetic fields.
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.
Give me one way to do it.
Uh, maybe if we had a direct line of sight.
You're talking about an active volcano!
Sir, if that thing erupts,
I cannot guarantee we can withstand the heat!
I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.
Our shuttle was concealed by the ash cloud, but the Enterprise is too large.
If utilized in a rescue effort,
it would be revealed to the indigenous specie.
Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you, but there has got to be an exception.
None. Such action violates the Prime Directive.
Shut up, Spock! We're trying to save you, damn it!
Doctor, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Spock, we're talking about your life!
The rule cannot be broken...
Spock!
Try to get him back online.
Ninety seconds to detonations.
If Spock were here and I were there, what would he do?
He'd let you die.
Spock!
You all right?
Captain, you let them see our ship.
He's fine.
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?
Safely and soundly.
Please notify him that his device
has successfully detonated.
You hear that?
Congratulations, Spock.
You just saved the world.
You violated the Prime Directive.
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.
I can save her.
What did you say?
Your daughter.
I can save her.
Who are you?
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.
Jim!
You're not actually gonna answer that, are you?
Spock, I'm telling you, this is why he called. I can feel it.
Your feeling aside, I consider it highly unlikely that we will be selected for the new program.
Why else would Pike want to see us?
Forget about seniority.
They gave us the newest ship in the fleet.
I can think of numerous possibilities.
A five-year mission, Spock!
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!
Think how incredible that's gonna be.
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.
"Uneventful."
Admiral?
It's the way you described the survey of Nibiru in your captain's log.
Uh, yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time going over the details.
Tell me more about this volcano.
Data says it was highly volatile.
If it were to erupt, it would wipe out the planet.
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.
Something tells me it won't.
Uh, well, sir, volatile is all relative.
Maybe our data was off.
Or maybe it didn't erupt because Mr. Spock detonated a cold fusion device inside it right after a civilization that's barely invented the wheel happened to see a starship rising out of their ocean!
That is pretty much how you describe it, is it not?
Admiral...
You filed a report?
Why didn't you tell me?
I incorrectly assumed that you would be truthful in your captain's log.
Yeah, I would have been if I didn't have to save your life, and the very reason
I felt it necessary to take responsibility for the actions...
Take responsibility, yeah.
That'd be so noble, pointy, if you weren't also throwing me under the bus.
"Pointy"? Is that a derogatory reference to...
Gentlemen.
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and observe, not to interfere.
Had the mission gone according to plan, Admiral, the indigenous species would never have been aware of our interference.
That's a technicality.
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?
I'm expressing multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.
To which are you referring?
Out.
You're dismissed, Commander.
You have any idea what a pain in the ass you are?
I think so, sir.
So tell me what you did wrong.
What's the lesson to be learned here?
Never trust a Vulcan.
Now, see, you can't even answer the question. You lied.
On an official report, you lied.
You think the rules don't apply to you
'cause you disagree with them.
That's why you talked me into signing up in the first place.
It's why you gave me your ship.
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.
And now, I see you haven't got an ounce of humility.
What was I supposed to do, let Spock die?
You're missing the point.
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?
I wouldn't have risked my First Officer's life in the first place!
You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny!
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations and almost got everyone under your command killed.
Except I didn't!
You know how many crew members I've lost? Not one!
That's your problem, you think you're infallible!
You think you can't make a mistake.
It's a pattern with you!
The rules are for other people!
Some should be.
And what's worse is you using blind luck to justify your playing God!
Given the circumstances, this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.
He convened a special tribunal, to which I was not invited.
You understand what Starfleet regulations mandate be done at this point.
They've taken the Enterprise away from you.
They're sending you back to the Academy.
Admiral, listen...
I understand regulation, but every decision I've made...
No! I can't listen!
You don't comply with the rules, you don't take responsibility for anything, and you don't respect the chair.
You know why?
Because you're not ready for it.
Blue security clearance now permitted for airlock access.
I'm going to need three titanium...
Radiation protection is required in this area.
How did you find me?
I know you better than you think I do.
The first time I found you was in a dive like this.
Remember that? You got your ass handed to you.
No, I didn't.
You don't? No, that's not what happened.
That was an epic beating.
No, it wasn't.
You had napkins hanging out of your nose.
Did you not?
Yeah, that was a good fight.
"A good fight."
I think that's your problem right there.
They gave her back to me.
The Enterprise.
Congratulations.
Watch your back with that First Officer, though.
Spock's not going to be working with me.
He's been transferred.
U.S.S. Bradbury.
You're going to be my First Officer.
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.
But every now and then
I can make a good case.
What did you tell him?
The truth.
That I believe in you.
That if anybody deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.
I don't know what to say.
That is a first.
It's going to be okay, son.
"Emergency session,
Daystrom."
That's us.
Yeah.
Suit up.
All Starfleet personnel, please be advised,
- new security protocols are in effect.
- Captain.
Not anymore, Spock.
First Officer.
I was demoted and you were reassigned.
It is fortunate that the consequences were not more severe.
You've got to be kidding me.
Captain, it was never my intention...
Not Captain.
I saved your life, Spock.
You wrote a report,
I lost my ship.
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you to the fact that
I submitted the report.
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion to follow the rules. But you see, I can't do that.
Where I come from, if someone saves your life, you don't stab him in the back.
Vulcans cannot lie.
Then I'm talking to the half-human part of you.
All right?
Do you understand why I went back for you?
Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, U.S.S.
Bradbury.
Guess you're with me.
Yes, Captain.
The truth is
I'm going to miss you.
Admiral Marcus, sir.
Thank you for convening on such short notice.
Be seated.
By now, some of you have heard what happened in London.
The target was a Starfleet data archive.
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,
42 men and women are dead.
One hour ago,
I received a message from a Starfleet officer, who confessed to carrying out this attack, that he was being forced to do it by this man,
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.
And he is the man responsible for this act of savagery.
For reasons unknown, John
Harrison has just declared a one-man war against Starfleet.
And under no circumstances are we to allow this man to escape Federation space.
You here tonight represent the senior command of all the vessels in the region.
And in the name of those we lost, you will run this bastard down.
This is a manhunt, pure and simple, so let's get to work.
Earth's perimeter sensors have not detected any warp signatures leaving the system, so we know he can't be far.
You will park your ships in a blockade formation then deploy search vehicles and landing parties to run down every lead.
This man has shown willingness to kill innocent people, so the rules of engagement are simple.
If you come across this man and fear for your life or the lives of those nearby, you are authorized to use deadly force on sight.
What's in the bag?
James, not now.
It doesn't seem odd to you that he'd target an archive?
It's like bombing a library.
Chris?
Everything okay there?
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating to his new position as First Officer.
You got something to say,
Kirk, say it.
Tomorrow's too late.
I'm fine, sir.
My apologies.
Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.
Why the archive?
All that information is public record.
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet, this could just be the beginning.
The beginning of what,
Mr. Kirk?
Sir, in the event of an attack, protocol mandates that senior command gather captains and first officers at Starfleet H.Q., right here
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison would commandeer a jump ship without warp capabilities...
Clear the room!
No!
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!
- Let's go!
- Cover me!
- Target acquired.
- Take him out!
Watch my flank!
- Go, go, go!
- Cover me!
Fire!
Yeah?
Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something
in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.
He has asked to see us right away.
Captain! I found this in the crashed jump ship, sir.
This is how the bastard got away.
What do you mean?
It's a portable transwarp beaming device.
Well, can you figure out where he went?
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.
He's gone to the one place we...
We just can't go.
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.
He's on Kronos, sir.
I request my command be reinstated and your permission to go after him.
Give us a minute.
Kronos.
Yes, sir.
So Harrison's gone to the Klingon homeworld.
Is he defecting?
Uh, we're not sure, sir.
He has taken refuge in the Ketha Province, a region uninhabited for decades.
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!
He knows if we even go near Klingon space, it'd be all-out war.
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.
Please, sir.
All-out war with the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.
If you ask me, it's already begun.
Since we first learned of their existence, the Klingon Empire has conquered and occupied two planets that we know of and fired on our ships half a dozen times.
They are coming our way.
London was not an archive.
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet designated Section 31.
They were developing defense technology and training our officers to gather intelligence on the Klingons and any other potential enemy who means to do us harm.
Harrison was one of our top agents.
Well, now he's a fugitive and I want to take him out.
Pike always said you were one of our best and brightest.
You should have heard him defend you.
He's the one who talked you into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?
Yes, sir.
Did he ever tell you who talked him into joining?
His death is on me.
And yours can't be.
Sir, please. All I...
Mr. Spock, you said the province where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?
Affirmative, sir.
As part of our defensive strategy,
31 developed a new photon torpedo.
Long-range and untraceable, it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.
I don't want you hurt, but I want to take him out.
You park on the edge of the Neutral Zone, you lock onto
Harrison's position, you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.
Permission to reinstate
Mr. Spock as my First Officer.
Granted.
Jim!
Where were you?
For what?
Your medical exam.
Ten hours ago, you were in a damn firefight.
Now it's my duty as ship's...
I'm fine, Bones.
The hell you are.
I'm fine.
Status report,
Mr. Spock.
The Enterprise should be ready for launch by the time we arrive.
Good. Good.
Captain.
Thank you for requesting my reinstatement.
You're welcome.
As I am again your First
Officer, it is now my duty to strongly object to our mission parameters.
There is no Starfleet regulation that condemns a man to die without a trial, something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes at the Klingon homeworld goes against...
You yourself said the area's uninhabited.
There's only gonna be one casualty.
Our orders have nothing to do with Starfleet regulation.
Wait a minute. We're firing torpedoes at the Klingons?
Regulations aside, this action is morally wrong.
Regulations aside, pulling your ass out of a volcano was morally right.
And I didn't win any points for that.
I'm not gonna take ethics lessons from a robot!
Reverting to name-calling suggests that you are defensive and therefore find my opinion valid.
I wasn't asking for your opinion.
Bones, get that thing off my face.
Captain, our mission could start a war with the Klingons and it is, by its very definition, immoral.
Perhaps you should take the requisite time to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.
Captain Kirk.
Science Officer Wallace.
I've been assigned to the
Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.
These are my transfer orders.
You requested an additional science officer, Captain?
I wish I had.
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."
"Doctorate in applied physics"
"specializing in advanced weaponry."
Impressive credentials.
Thank you.
But redundant now that I am back aboard the Enterprise.
And yet, the more the merrier.
Have a seat, Doctor.
Thank you.
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.
No!
I'm not signing anything!
Now, get these bloody things off my ship! Captain!
Is there a problem,
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir. I was just explaining to this gentleman that I cannot authorize any weapons on board this ship without knowing what's inside them.
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...
Report to the bridge.
Captain.
Mr. Scott,
I understand your concerns, but we need these torpedoes on board.
Due respect, sir, but photon torpedoes run on fuel.
Now, I cannot detect the type of fuel that's in the compartments on these torpedoes because it's shielded.
Now, I asked for the specifications, but he said...
It's classified.
It's classified.
So I said,
"No specs, no signature!"
Captain.
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.
Get down!
Jim, your vitals are way off.
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!
I need you to approve those weapons.
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.
Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.
It's a radioactive catastrophe waiting to happen.
A subtle shift in magnetic output from, say, firing one or more of six dozen torpedoes with an unknown payload could set off a chain reaction which would kill every living thing on this ship.
Letting those torpedoes on board the Enterprise is the last straw!
What was the first straw?
What was the...
There are plenty of straws.
How about Starfleet confiscating my transwarp equation?
And now some madman's using it to hop across the galaxy!
Where do you think he got it from?
We have our orders, Scotty!
That's what scares me.
This is clearly a military operation.
Is that what we are now?
'Cause I thought we were explorers.
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.
Right, well, you leave me no choice but to resign my duties.
Oh, come on, Scotty.
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...
You're not giving me much of a choice...
Will you just make an exception and sign...
Do you accept my resignation or not?
I do!
I do.
You are relieved,
Mr. Scott.
Jim, for the love of God, do not use those torpedoes.
Attention. Warp core anti-matter containment check
in three minutes.
Captain! I'm so sorry about Admiral Pike.
We all are.
Are you okay?
Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.
Actually, Scotty just quit.
And your boyfriend's second-guessing me every chance he gets.
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.
It's just sometimes I want to rip the bangs off his head.
You know, maybe it's me. I...
It's not you.
It's not?
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.
Oh, my God!
What is that even like?
Your ears burning?
Captain on the bridge!
Captain.
Mr. Chekov. You've been shadowing Mr. Scott.
You are familiar with the engineering systems of this ship?
Affirmative, sir.
Good.
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.
Aye, Captain.
Retract all moorings,
Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.
Docking clamps one, two, and three are released.
All moorings retracted.
Lieutenant Uhura, open a shipwide channel.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chekov, how we looking down there?
All systems nominal, Captain.
Copy that.
Warp available at your command.
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.
All right. Let's ride.
Yes, sir.
Channel open, sir.
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
As most of you know,
Christopher Pike, former captain of this ship and our friend, is dead.
The man who killed him has fled our system and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,
somewhere he believes we are unwilling to go.
We are on our way there now.
That our presence go undetected.
Tensions between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire have been high.
Any provocation could led to an all-out war.
I will personally lead a landing party to an abandoned city on the surface of Kronos where we will capture the fugitive, John Harrison, and return him to Earth so he can face judgment for his actions.
All right. Let's go get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.
Captain, I believe you have made the right decision.
If I can be of assistance, I would be happy to accompany you on the away team.
You? Happy?
I was simply attempting to use your vernacular to convey an idea.
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
All personnel, prepare for the closing of payload bay doors.
Mr. Spock. You startled me.
What are you doing, Doctor?
Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
You misunderstand.
What are you doing aboard this ship?
There is no record of you being assigned to the Enterprise.
Really? That must be some sort of mistake.
My conclusion as well,
Dr. Marcus.
Except that you have lied about your identity.
Wallace is the surname of your mother.
I can only assume the Admiral is your father.
Mr. Spock.
I'm aware that I have no right to ask this of you.
But please, he cannot know that I'm here...
Engineering manually dropped us out of warp, sir.
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?
Sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened!
The core overheated.
I had to activate the emergency stop.
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.
Sorry, Captain.
Damn it.
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.
Twenty minutes, sir.
That's 20 minutes in enemy space we weren't counting on.
All right.
We better hop to it.
Where's Spock?
Here, Captain.
You're coming with me to Kronos.
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?
It's rusty, but it's good.
Good, you're coming, too.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it, you two working together?
Absolutely not.
Unclear.
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.
Jim, you're not actually going down there, are you?
You don't rob a bank when the getaway car has a flat tire.
I'm sure engineering will have us all patched up by the time we get back.
Isn't that right,
Mr. Chekov?
Yes, Captain.
I'll do my best, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit a targeted comm burst to Harrison's location.
You tell him you have a bunch of real big torpedoes pointed at his head and if he doesn't play nice, you're not afraid to use them.
Is that a problem?
No, sir.
I've just never sat in the chair before.
You're gonna do great.
Jim! Wait!
You just sat that man down at a high-stakes poker game with no cards and told him to bluff.
Now Sulu's a good man, but he is no captain.
And enough with the metaphors, all right?
That's an order.
Mr. Sulu, make sure that
K'normian ship is ready to fly.
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.
Please have the trade ship we confiscated during
the Mudd incident last month fueled and flight ready.
Captain Kirk is en route to you now.
Ready to deploy, Captain.
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.
Sir?
Look, if this thing goes south, there can be nothing tying us to Starfleet.
Unless of course you want to start a war, Mr. Hendorff.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Good. Me, neither.
I am detecting a single life sign in the Ketha Province.
Given the information provided by Mr. Scott, this is most likely
John Harrison.
Mr. Sulu,
I think we found our man.
You let him know you mean business.
Aye, Captain.
Attention, John Harrison.
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
A shuttle of highly trained officers is on its way to your location.
If you do not surrender to them immediately,
I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes
currently locked onto your location.
You have two minutes to confirm your complain.
Refusal to do so will result in your obliteration.
If you test me, you will fail.
Mr. Sulu, remind me never to piss you off.
We will arrive at Harrison's location in three minutes, Captain.
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.
I calculate the odds of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%.
Fantastic.
Good thing you don't care about dying.
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.
Oh, I didn't say anything.
Actually, I'd be happy to speak if you're
Lieutenant, I would prefer to discuss this in private.
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.
What never seems to require your undivided focus...
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.
Okay... is us.
At that volcano, you didn't give a thought to us.
What it would do to me if you died, Spock.
You didn't feel anything.
You didn't care.
And I'm not the only one who's upset with you.
The Captain is, too.
Wha... No, no, no.
Don't drag me into this.
She is right.
Your suggestion that I do not care about dying is incorrect.
A sentient being's optimal chance at maximizing their utility is a long and prosperous life.
Great.
Not exactly a love song, Spock.
You misunderstand.
It is true I chose not to feel anything upon realizing that my own life was ending.
As Admiral Pike was dying,
I joined with his consciousness and experienced what he felt at the moment of his passing.
Anger. Confusion.
Loneliness.
Fear.
I had experienced those feelings before, multiplied exponentially on the day my planet was destroyed.
Such a feeling is something I choose never to experience again.
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel as a reflection of my not caring.
Well, I assure you, the truth is precisely the opposite.
What the hell was that?
What happened?
Where's their signal?
It cut out.
I'm working to get them back.
We are being pursued by a D-4 class Klingon vessel.
I thought this sector was abandoned!
It must be a random patrol.
Hold on!
This ship has no offensive capabilities.
It's got us.
Give me all six fuel cells.
Aye, Captain.
They're closing fast, bearing 285!
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.
If you are suggesting that we utilize the passage between the approaching structures, this ship will not fit.
We'll fit.
Captain, we will not fit.
We'll fit, we'll fit!
I told you we'd fit. I am not sure that qualifies.
Any sign of them?
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!
Or they're jamming our scanners.
Or we lost them.
They're ordering us to land.
Captain, they're gonna want to know why we're here.
And they're gonna torture us.
Question us.
And they're gonna kill us.
So we come out shooting.
We're outnumbered, outgunned.
There's no way we survive if we attack first.
You brought me here because I speak Klingon.
Then let me speak Klingon.
This isn't going to work.
It is our only logical option.
And if you interrupt her now, you will not only incur the wrath of the Klingons but that of
Lieutenant Uhura as well.
Lieutenant.
Thanks, Captain.
Stand down.
How many torpedoes?
Stand down!
The weapons you threatened me with in your message.
How many are there?
Seventy-two.
I surrender.
On behalf of Christopher Pike, my friend,
I accept your surrender.
Captain!
Captain.
Cuff him.
- Bones, meet me in the brig.
- Be right there.
Lieutenant.
Contact Starfleet, let them know we have Harrison in custody, and we'll be on our way once the warp core is repaired.
Yes, sir.
- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.
But he just took out a squad of Klingons single-handedly.
I want to know how.
Sounds like we have a superman on board.
You tell me.
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.
Why aren't we moving, Captain?
An unexpected malfunction, perhaps in your warp core conveniently stranding you on the edge of Klingon space?
How the hell do you know that?
Bones.
I think you'd find my insight valuable, Captain.
We good?
Yeah.
Let me know what you find.
Ignore me and you will get everyone on this ship killed.
Captain, I believe he will only attempt to manipulate you.
I would not recommend engaging the prisoner further.
Give me a minute.
Let me explain what's happening here.
You are a criminal.
I watched you murder innocent men and women.
I was authorized to end you!
And the only reason why you are still alive is because I am allowing it.
So shut your mouth.
Oh, Captain, are you going to punch me again over and over till your arm weakens?
Clearly you want to, so tell me, why did you allow me to live?
We all make mistakes.
No. I surrendered to you because, despite your attempt to convince me otherwise, you seem to have a conscience, Mr. Kirk.
If you did not, then it would be impossible for me to convince you of the truth.
Coordinates not far from Earth.
If you want to know why I did what I did, go and take a look.
Give me one reason why I should listen to you.
I can give you 72.
And they're on board your ship, Captain.
They have been all along.
I suggest you open one up.
Oh!
Hi!
You know what really bothers me, though?
It's the modifications, you know, the enhancements.
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!
Just for trying to do what's right!
And what did you do anyway?
You just stood there like an oyster, looking at me!
What?
Scotty, it's Kirk.
Oh, well now!
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!
Did you hear that? I called him Perfect Hair.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Are you drunk?
What I do in my private time is my business, Jimbo.
I need you to help me out with something.
Will you take these coordinates down?
Hmm.
Are you writing?
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?
Forty-six.
I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but I have a feeling you'll know it when you see it.
You may have been right about those torpedoes.
I will consider that an apology.
And I will consider that apology.
You are the one who quit.
You made me quit!
Mr. Scott?
Scott. Ah...
The nerve of that guy!
I am not doing that man any favors!
No!
Ach! All right, then!
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?
You're not actually going to listen to this guy?
He killed Pike, he almost killed you, and now you think it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo because he dared you to.
Why did he save our lives, Bones?
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.
Perhaps you too should learn to govern your emotions,
Doctor.
In this situation, logic dictates...
Logic? Oh, my God!
There's a maniac trying to make us blow up our own damn ship and...
That's not it. I don't know why he surrendered, but that's not it.
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board, who exactly is qualified to just pop open a four-ton stick of dynamite?
The Admiral's daughter appeared to have interest in the torpedoes and she is a weapons specialist.
Perhaps she could be of some use.
What Admiral's daughter?
Carol Marcus.
Your new science officer concealed her identity to board the ship.
When were you going to tell me that?
When it became relevant.
As it just did.
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?
I don't know. That's why I forged my transfer onto your ship to find out why.
I do apologize for that.
By the way, if I caused you any problems, I am sorry.
I'm Carol Marcus.
James Kirk.
Torpedoes.
My father gave me access to every program he oversaw, then I heard he was developing these prototype torpedoes.
Uh-huh. When I went to confront him about it, he wouldn't even see me.
That's when I discovered the torpedoes had disappeared from all official records.
And then he gave them to me.
You're much cleverer than your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.
I have a reputation?
Yes, you do. I'm a friend of Christine Chapel's.
Christine, yes.
How is she?
She transferred to the outer frontier to be a nurse.
She's much happier now.
That's good.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
What... What are we doing in here?
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?
Of course it is.
Would you please turn around?
Why?
Just turn around.
It's too dangerous to try and open one of these torpedoes on the Enterprise.
But there is a nearby planetoid.
I can open one up there.
But I will need some help.
Turn around.
Now!
Captain on the bridge!
Mr. Sulu, have Doctors Marcus and McCoy landed on the planetoid yet?
Yes, sir. They're moving the torpedo into position now.
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?
Not yet.
But if we're stuck here much longer, they will find us.
Lieutenant Uhura, did you let Starfleet know we have Harrison in custody?
Yes, sir.
No response yet.
Engineering to bridge.
Hello. Captain, can you hear me?
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.
We found the leak, sir, but the damage is substantial.
We're working on it.
Any idea what caused it?
Uh, no, sir. But I accept full responsibility.
Something tells me it wasn't your fault.
Stay on it.
Shuttle is standing by,
Captain.
Bones, thanks for helping out.
Dr. Marcus asked for the steadiest hands on the ship.
You know, when I dreamt about being stuck on a deserted planet with a gorgeous woman, there was no torpedo!
Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.
So how can these legendary hands help you, Dr. Marcus?
Bones!
To understand how powerful these weapons are, we need to open the warhead.
To do that, we need to access the fuel compartment.
Unfortunately for us, the warheads on these weapons are live.
Sweetheart, I once performed an emergency C-section on a pregnant Gorn.
Octuplets.
And let me tell you, those little bastards bite.
I think I can work some magic on your missile.
Dr. McCoy, there's a bundle of fiber optic cables against the inner casing.
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.
Whatever you do, do not touch anything else.
Do you understand?
Right. The thought never crossed my mind.
Dr. McCoy,
wait for my word.
I'm rerouting the detonation process.
Are you ready?
And raring.
Good luck.
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.
The warhead's gonna detonate in 30 seconds, sir!
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!
The transporter cannot differentiate between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.
We cannot beam back one without the other.
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?
I'm trying. I'm trying.
Jim, get her the hell out of here!
No! If you beam me back, he dies!
Just let me do it!
Ten. Nine. Eight.
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.
Four. Three.
Shit!
Deactivation successful, Captain.
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?
Bones!
Jim?
You're going to want to see this.
Delta team, deliver your thrusters to loading dock 12.
U.S.S. Vengeance, bridge crew
requesting entry to construction hangar.
You are cleared to enter the hangar.
I need a welding team on the number one nacelle.
Holy sh...
What have we got?
This fuel container's been removed from the torpedo and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.
But if we try to revive him without the proper sequencing, it could kill him.
This technology's beyond me.
How advanced, Doctor?
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.
We haven't needed to freeze anyone since we developed warp capability, which explains the most interesting thing about our friend here.
He's 300 years old.
Why is there a man in that torpedo?
There are men and women in all those torpedoes,
Captain.
I put them there.
Who the hell are you?
A remnant of a time long past.
Genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war.
But we were condemned as criminals, forced into exile.
For centuries we slept, hoping when we awoke, things would be different.
But as a result of the destruction of Vulcan, your Starfleet began to aggressively search distant quadrants of space.
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.
I looked up
"John Harrison."
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.
John Harrison was a fiction created the moment I was awoken by your Admiral Marcus to help him advance his cause.
A smokescreen to conceal my true identity.
My name is,
Khan.
Why would a Starfleet Admiral ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?
Because I am better.
At what?
Everything.
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to an uncivilized threat in a civilized time and for that he needed a warrior's mind.
My mind.
To design weapons and warships.
You are suggesting the Admiral violated every regulation he vowed to uphold simply because he wanted to exploit your intellect.
He wanted to exploit my savagery.
Intellect alone is useless in a fight, Mr. Spock.
You... You can't even break a rule.
How would you be expected to break bone?
Marcus used me to design weapons.
To help him realize his vision of a militarized Starfleet.
He sent you to use those weapons.
To fire my torpedoes on an unsuspecting planet.
And then he purposely crippled your ship in enemy space, leading to one inevitable outcome.
The Klingons would come searching for whomever was responsible, and you would have no chance of escape.
Marcus would finally have the war he talked about.
The war he always wanted.
No. No.
I watched you open fire in a room full of unarmed Starfleet officers.
You killed them in cold blood!
Marcus took my crew from me.
You are a murderer!
He used my friends to control me.
I tried to smuggle them to safety by concealing them in the very weapons
I had designed, but I was discovered.
I had no choice but to escape alone.
And when I did, I had every reason to suspect that Marcus had killed every single one of the people I hold most dear.
So I responded in kind.
My crew is my family, Kirk.
Is there anything you would not do for your family?
Proximity alert, sir!
There's a ship at warp heading right for us.
- Klingons?
- At warp?
No, Kirk.
- We both know who it is.
- I don't think so.
It's not coming at us from Kronos.
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.
Post six security officers on him.
Yes, Captain.
Captain on the bridge!
ETA of the incoming ship.
Three seconds, sir.
Shields.
Aye, Captain.
They're hailing us, sir.
On screen.
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.
Captain Kirk.
Admiral Marcus.
I wasn't expecting you.
That's a hell of a ship you got there.
That you'd taken Harrison into custody in violation of your orders.
Well, we, uh...
We had to improvise when our warp core unexpectedly malfunctioned.
But you already knew that, didn't you, sir?
I don't take your meaning.
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?
To assist with our repairs?
Why else would the head of Starfleet personally come to the edge of the Neutral Zone?
Captain, they're scanning our ship.
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?
Where is your prisoner, Ki?
Per Starfleet regulation,
I'm planning on returning Khan to Earth to stand trial.
Well, shit.
You talked to him.
This is exactly what I was hoping to spare you from.
I took a tactical risk and I woke that bastard,
believing that his superior intelligence could help us protect ourselves from whatever came at us next.
But I made a mistake.
And now the blood of everybody he's killed is on my hands.
So I'm asking you, give him to me so that I can end what I started.
And what exactly would you like me to do with the rest of his crew, sir?
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?
Start a war in the process?
He put those people in those torpedoes.
And I simply didn't want to burden u
with knowing what was inside of the.
You saw what this man can do all by himself.
If we woke up the rest of his crew?
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?
He's playing you, so, don't you see that?
Khan and his crew were condemned to death as war criminals.
And now it is our duty to carry out that sentence
before anybody else dies because of hi.
Now, I'm going to ask you again!
One last time, son.
Lower your shields.
Tell me where he is.
He's in engineering, sir.
But I'll have him moved to the transporter room right away.
I'll take it from here.
- Do not drop those shields, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.
Captain, given your awareness of Khan's true location in the med bay, may I know the details of your plan?
I told Marcus we were bringing a fugitive back to Earth.
That's what we're going to do.
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?
Sir, if we go to warp, we run the risk of seriously damaging the core!
Can we do it?
Technically, yes, but I would not advise it, Captain.
Noted.
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.
Yes, sir.
Punch it.
Well, at least we're moving again.
If you think you're safe at warp, you're wrong.
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.
Tell them we were pursued into the Neutral Zone by an unmarked Federation ship.
Comms are down, sir.
Permission to come on the bridge.
Dr. Marcus.
He's gonna catch up with us, and when he does, the only thing that's gonna stop him destroying this ship is me, so you have to let me talk to him.
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship that has advanced warp capabilities...
Captain! I'm getting a reading I don't understand.
Where are we? We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.
Shields are dropping.
We're defenseless, sir.
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.
Where's the damage?
Major hull damage, Captain.
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now! CREWMAN: Aye, sir.
Captain! Stop! Everybody on this ship is going to die if you don't let me speak to him.
Uhura, hail him.
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.
What are you doing on that ship?
I heard what you said.
That you made a mistake and now you're doing everything you can to fix it.
But, Dad,
I don't believe that the man who raised me is capable of destroying a ship full of innocent people.
And, if I'm wrong about that, then you're gonna have to do it with me on board.
Actually, Carol, I won't.
Oh.
Jim...
Can we intercept the transport signal?
No, sir.
Carol!
Captain Kirk, without authorization
and in league with the fugitive John Harris,
you went rogue in enemy territory,
leaving me no choice
but to hunt you don and destroy you.
Lock phasers. Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!
Target all left torpedoes on the Enterprise bridge.
Sir, my crew was just...
Was just following my orders.
I take... I take full responsibility for my actions.
But they were mine and they were mine alone.
If I transmit
Khan's location to you now, all that I ask is that you spare them.
Please, sir.
I'll do anything you want.
Just let them live.
That's a hell of an apology.
But if it's any consolation,
I was never going to spare your crew.
Fire when ready...
I'm sorry.
Our weapons won't fire, sir!
Someone in engineering just manually reset our systems!
What do you mean,
"someone"? Who?
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.
Enterprise!
Can you hear me? Scotty!
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.
You're on that ship!
I snuck on.
And seeing as I've just committed an act of treason against a Starfleet Admiral,
I'd really like to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!
You're a miracle worker.
We're a little low on power right now.
Just stand by. Stand by.
What do you mean,
"low on power"?
What happened to the Enterprise?
Call you back.
Scotty!
Spock. Our ship, how is she?
Our options are limited,
Captain.
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.
There is one option.
Uhura, when you get Scotty back, patch him through.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.
Captain, I strongly object.
To what? I haven't said anything yet.
Since we cannot take the ship from the outside, the only way we can take it is from within.
And as a large boarding party would be detected, it is optimal for you to take as few members of the crew as possible.
You will meet resistance, requiring personnel with advanced combat abilities and innate knowledge of that ship.
This indicates that you plan to align with Khan, the very man we were sent here to destroy.
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
An Arabic proverb attributed to a prince who was betrayed and decapitated by his own subjects.
Still, it's a hell of a quote.
I will go with you, Captain.
No, I need you on the bridge.
I cannot allow you to do this.
It is my function aboard this ship to advise you on making the wisest decisions possible, something I firmly believe you are incapable of doing in this moment.
You're right!
What I'm about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it's not logical.
It is a gut feeling.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
I only know what I can do.
The Enterprise and her crew need someone in that chair that knows what he's doing.
And it's not me.
It's you, Spock.
Tell me everything you know about that ship.
Dreadnought class.
Two times the size, three times the speed.
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.
Unlike most Federation vessels, it's built solely for combat.
I will do everything I can to make you answer for what you did.
But right now I need your help.
In exchange for what?
You said you'd do anything for your crew.
I can guarantee their safety.
Captain.
You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.
Bones, what are you doing with that tribble?
The tribble's dead.
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.
Khan's cells regenerate like nothing I've ever seen, and I want to know why.
You coming with me or not?
You want to do what?
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering the Enterprise into position as we speak.
To this ship? How?
There's a cargo door, hangar 7, access port 101A.
You need to find the manual override to open that airlock.
Are you crazy?
Whoever you are.
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.
It is not gonna be all right.
You want me to open an airlock into space, whereupon I will freeze, die and explode!
Lieutenant, from our current position, is it possible to establish contact with New Vulcan?
I'll do my best.
Thank you.
Mr. Sulu, what is the status of the other ship?
Their systems are still offline.
I'm aligning our ship now.
Scotty, how we doing over there?
Captain, I wish
I had better news.
They've locked out access to the ship's computer.
They'll have full weapons in three minutes.
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them destroying the Enterprise.
Stand by.
Access port 101A of the other ship.
Captain, the ships are aligned.
Copy that. Scotty!
I'm in the hangar.
Give me a minute.
I'm running. Stand by.
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.
It's four square meters, tops.
It's gonna be like jumping out of a moving car, off a bridge, into your shot glass.
It's okay.
I've done it before.
Yeah, it was vertical.
We jumped onto a...
It was a...
It doesn't matter.
Scotty...
Did you find the manual override?
The manual override, Scotty.
Not yet, not yet.
Captain, before you launch, you should be aware there is a considerable debris field between our ships.
Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
It's not easy!
Just give me two seconds, all right, you mad bastard!
Tell me this is gonna work.
I have neither the information nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.
Okay, Captain, stand by.
Boy, you're a real comfort.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
Okay, okay!
I'm set to open the door.
You ready?
Are you?
Spock, pull the trigger.
Yes, Captain.
Launching activation sequence on
three,
two,
one.
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.
Copy that.
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!
I know, I know!
I can see that.
Don't move.
Use your display compass,
Captain.
You must correct precisely
- 37.243 degrees.
- Got it.
I'm working my way back.
Scotty, you're gonna be ready with that door, right?
What are you doing in here?
Wee bit of maintenance on the airlock console. You're big.
Mr. Scott, where are you?
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.
I'm working on getting his signal back. Stand by.
- Damn it.
- Captain, what is it?
My helmet was hit. Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.
His communicator is working. I don't know why he isn't responding.
What is that? Are you Starfleet or private security?
Show me your other hand. Because you look like private security.
Imminent collision detected!
Khan, use evasive action!
There is debris directly ahead.
I see it.
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?
I don't know, Commander.
I'm having trouble tracking him in all this debris.
Was Khan hit?
We are trying to find him now.
Captain, you need to adjust your target destination to 183 by 473 degrees.
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.
Hitting your target destination is mathematically impossible.
Spock, if I get back, we really need to talk about your bedside manner.
Commander, he's not going to make it.
My display is still functioning.
I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters ahead of me at my one o'clock.
Come to your left a few degrees and follow me.
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.
Do you copy?
Do you copy? Scotty?
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott, open the door in ten, nine...
Scotty!
That person counting down, what is that?
...eight...
I think you're hearing things, mate... seven...
Mr. Scott, where are you?
...six, five...
1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.
Scotty, where are you?
...three...
Do you copy, Scotty? Please!
...two...
Sorry about this.
About what?
Mr. Scott, open the door!
Open the door!
Mr. Scott, now!
Welcome aboard.
It's good to see you, Scotty.
Who is that?
Khan, Scotty.
Scotty, Khan.
Hello.
They'll know we're here.
I know the best way to the bridge.
It's locked to stun.
Theirs won't be.
Try not to get shot.
Commander, I have that transmission as requested.
On screen, please.
Stand by.
Mr. Spock.
Mr. Spock.
Admiral.
I'll deal with you in a...
I am ashamed to be your daughter.
Sir, we just had a hangar door open on deck 13.
Khan.
They're going to have full power and we're walking?
The turbolifts are easily tracked and Marcus would have us in a cage.
This path runs adjacent to the engine room.
They know they won't be able to use their weapons here without destabilizing the warp core, which gives us the advantage.
Where'd you find this guy?
Oh, it's a long story.
I will be brief.
In your travels, did you ever encounter a man named Khan?
As you know,
I have made a vow never to give you information
that could potentially alter your destiny.
Your path is yours to worth, and yours alone.
That being said,
Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary
the Enterprise ever faced.
He is brilliant, ruthless,
and he will not hesitate to kill
every single one of you.
Did you defeat him?
At great cost. Yes.
How?
I don't mean to tempt fate here, but where is everybody?
The ship is designed to be flown by minimal crew, one, if necessary.
One? I...
You all right?
Yeah. Where's Khan?
Lieutenant, I need you to assemble all senior medical and engineering staff in the weapons bay.
All right.
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated a torpedo.
Could you replicate the process?
Why the hell would I want to do that?
Can you or can you not?
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!
The fact that you are a doctor is precisely why I need you to listen very carefully.
Where is he?
Shit!
This way.
The minute we get to the bridge, drop him.
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.
Power coming online, sir!
Retarget the Enterprise now.
Aye, sir.
Make sure he stays down.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.
You're not actually going to do this, are you?
Admiral, get out of the chair.
You better stop and think about what you're doing, Kirk.
You better think about what you did on Kronos.
You made an incursion onto an enemy planet!
You killed a Klingon patrol.
Even if you got away without a trace, war is coming.
And who is going to lead us? You?
If I'm not in charge, our entire way of life is decimated!
So you want me off this ship, you better kill me.
I'm not going to kill you, sir.
But I could stun your ass and drag you out of that chair.
I'd rather not do that in front of your daughter.
You all right?
Yes, Captain.
Jim!
Listen! Wait!
You should have let me sleep.
Where is the Captain,
Mr. Sulu?
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.
I'm going to make this very simple for you.
Captain.
Your crew for my crew.
You betrayed us.
Oh, you are smart,
Mr. Spock.
Spock don't...
Mr. Spock, give me my crew.
And what will you do when you get them?
Continue the work we were doing before we were banished.
Which, as I understand it, involves the mass genocide of any being you find to be less than superior.
Shall I destroy you,
Mr. Spock?
Or will you give what I want?
We have no transporter capabilities.
Fortunately mine a perfectly function.
Drop your shields.
If I do so, I have no guarantee that you will not destroy the Enterprise.
Well, let's play this out logically then, Mr. Spock.
Firstly,
I will kill your Captain to demonstrate my resolve.
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice but to kill you and your entire crew.
If you destroy our ship, you will also destroy your own people.
Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not.
I will target your life support systems located behind the aft nacelle.
And after every single person aboard your ship suffocates,
I will walk over your cold corpses to recover my people.
Now, shall we begin?
Lower shields.
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.
I see your 72 torpedoes are still in their tubes.
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.
Vulcans do not lie.
The torpedoes are yours.
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
I have fulfilled your terms.
Now fulfill mine.
Well, Kirk, it seems apt to return you to your crew.
After all, no ship should go down without her captain.
He's locking phasers on us, sir!
Let us out of here now!
Shields at 6%!
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?
Twelve seconds, sir!
Crew of the Enterprise, prepare for imminent proximity detonation.
What's he talking about?
What detonation?
The torpedoes. He armed the damn torpedoes!
No!
Sir, their weapons have been knocked out.
Not bad, Commander.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Bones!
Bones!
Nurse!
I got you. I got you.
Dr. Marcus.
Good to see you, Jim.
You helped Spock detonate those torpedoes?
Damn right I did.
He killed Khan's crew!
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.
I've got Khan's crew.
Seventy-two human popsicles safe and sound in their cryo tubes.
Son of a bitch!
Sir, the central power grid is failing!
Switch to auxiliary power.
Auxiliary power failing, sir.
Commander, our ship's caught in Earth's gravity!
Can we stop?
I can't do anything.
Sorry! Oh, no.
Clear the area!
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.
Do you?
Yeah.
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.
Aye, sir.
As acting Captain, I order you to abandon this ship.
I will remain behind and divert all power to life support and evacuation shuttle bays.
Evacuation protocols...
I order you to abandon the ship!
All due respect, Commander, but we're not going anywhere.
Attention all decks.
Evacuation protocols initiated.
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!
Attention, all decks.
Evacuation protocols initiated.
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.
There won't be time for evacuation if we don't get power to stabilize the damn ship!
Can we restore it?
Only from engineering.
We have to get back to the warp core.
Attention all decks.
Jim?
Scotty, we got to get the power back on! Come on!
Scotty, we got to jump!
What?
Jump! Jump!
Oh, God.
Emergency power at 15% and dropping.
Attention, all decks.
Evacuation protocols initiated.
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.
Jim?
Hold on!
I can't.
I've got you, Captain!
Chekov.
Don't let go!
Even if we get the warp core online, we've still got to redirect the power!
He's right, Captain!
What are you talking about?
Someone has to hit the manual override.
Uh, laddie, there's a switch...
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!
Let's go!
Oh, no.
Oh-yoy! Oh-yoy!
Evacuation protocols initiated.
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.
Mr. Sulu, divert any remaining power to stabilizers.
Doing what I can, sir.
Doing what I can.
Core misaligned. Danger.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
What?
The housings are misaligned!
There's no way we can redirect the power!
The ship's dead, sir.
She's gone.
No, she's not.
Wait, Jim!
If we go in there, we'll die!
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!
Will you listen to me? What the hell are you doing?
I'm opening the door.
I'm going in.
That door is there to stop us from getting irradiated!
We'd be dead before we made the climb!
You're not making the climb.
Danger. Core misaligned.
Danger. Core misaligned.
If we don't get power or shields back online, we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!
Warp core is back online!
Maximum thrusters,
Mr. Sulu!
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!
Shields restored!
Commander, power online.
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.
It's a miracle.
There are no such things.
Engineering to bridge.
Mr. Spock!
Mr. Scott.
Sir, you'd better get down here.
Better hurry.
Open it.
The decontamination process is not complete.
You'd flood the whole compartment.
The door's locked, sir.
How's our ship?
Out of danger.
You saved the crew.
You used what he wanted against him.
That's a nice move.
It is what you would have done.
And this, this is what you would have done.
It was only logical.
I'm scared, Spock.
Help me not be.
How do you choose not to feel?
I do not know.
Right now I am failing.
I want you to know why I couldn't let you die.
Why I went back for you.
Because you are my friend.
Khan!
God, that was close!
Set destination,
Starfleet Headquarters!
Cannot guarantee destination.
Confirm order.
Confirm.
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.
He could.
Yes, sir.
Whoa!
He just jumped 30 meters!
Can we beam him up?
There's too much damage.
I have no incoming signal.
But it may be possible to beam you down, sir.
Go get him.
Stand by for coordinates.
Yes, sir.
Enter 3517 by 2598.
Coordinates confirmed.
Get me a cryo tube, now!
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.
Keep him in an induced coma.
We're gonna put Kirk inside.
It's our only chance to preserve his brain function.
How much of Khan's blood is left?
None.
Enterprise to Spock. Spock!
Activate the cryogenic sequence.
McCoy to bridge.
I can't reach Spock.
I need Khan alive.
You get that son of a bitch back on board right now!
I think he can save Kirk.
Can we beam them up to the ship?
Ah, they keep moving! I can't get a lock on either of them.
Can you beam someone down?
Spock!
Spock!
Spock, stop! Stop!
He's our only chance to save Kirk!
- What is it?
- It's a boy.
Your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes.
He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.
It was the transfusion that really took its toll.
You were out cold for two weeks.
Transfusion?
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.
Khan?
Once we caught him,
I synthesized a serum from his superblood.
Tell me, are you feeling, uh, homicidal?
Power mad? Despotic?
No more than usual.
How'd you catch him?
I didn't.
You saved my life.
Uhura and I had something to do with it, too, you know.
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...
Spock, just...
Thank you.
You are welcome, Jim.
There will always be those who mean to do us ha.
To stop them,
we risk awakening the same evil within ourselves.
Our first instinct is to seek revenge
when those we love are taken from us.
But that's not who we are.
We are here today
to rechristen the U.S.S. Enterprise,
and to honor those who lost their lives
nearly one year ago.
When Christopher Pike first gave me his ship
he had me recite the Captain's Oath,
words I didn't appreciate at the time.
Now I see them as a call for us to remember
who we once were,
and who we must be again.
And those words?
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Her five-year mission,
to explore strange new worlds,
to seek out new life and new civilizations,
to boldly go where no one has gone before.
Captain on the bridge.
It's hard to get out of it once you've had a taste, isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.
Chair's all yours, sir.
Mr. Scott.
How's our core?
Purring like a kitten, Captain.
She's ready for a long journey.
Excellent.
Come on, Bones!
It's gonna be fun.
Five years in space.
God help me.
Dr. Marcus.
Uh... I'm glad you could be a part of the family.
It's nice to have a family.
Spock.
Captain.
Where shall we go?
As a mission of this duration has never been attempted,
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.
Mr. Sulu, take us out.
Aye, Captain.
A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that?
What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh...
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
♪ Yo listen up here's a story
♪ About a little guy that lives in a blue world
♪ And all day and all night and everything he sees

Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room because I also want to see your research.
Okay, you can see my research, but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
- Come here.
I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.
- You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need a cardiologist after I...
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?
It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
- The old days.
- Mr Stark!
I never thought they would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen, my organisation's been tracking your research since year two of MIT.
Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually, of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh...
- She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
Damn betcha.
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain
- that governs repair...
- Wow.
...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic...
...operating system...
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
- Wow.
Is that...
Can you...
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.
And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.
- Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.
- Well, it's...
- Human application.
Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.
You almost bought it, didn't you?
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
- The what?
- Down!
Stay down! Stay down, boss.
- We're good.
- Stay down.
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.
It's not Y2K.
- Hey! Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
- You good?
- Yeah.
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.
So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times.
Then I moved on.
After a brief soirée in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
Forty-six.
- I'm different now.
I'm... Well...
- Forty-seven.
- You know who I am.
Ow!
Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
Which I will.
All right, let's do this.
Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly 72 hours?
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite.
I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival
of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother.
Start tight and then go wide.
Stamp date and time.
Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test.
Initialise sequence.
Jarvis, drop my needle.
♪ Dashing through the snow
♪ In a one horse open sleigh
♪ O'er the fields we go
♪ Laughing all the way
♪ Bells on bob tails ring
Crap.
♪ Oh, what fun it is to sing
♪ A sleighing song tonight
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
♪ Jingle all the way
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.
- Slow it down just a...
...little bit.
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.
I guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
Some people call me a terrorist.
I consider myself a teacher.
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado, the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children, of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ems.
You continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
Now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful.
Central to my administration's response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people will soon know him
as the tron Patriot.
And how is President Ems responding?
By taking the guy they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit, but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups, all right?
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.
Listen. "War Machine" was a little too aggressive.
All right?
This sends a better message.
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing, nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help.
Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?
Yeah. Fine with me.
- What's your name?
- Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it's not...
- it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it.
- It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
- Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
Are you okay, Mr Stark?
Take it easy. Tony.
How did you get out of the wormhole?
- Wait a minute. Tony!
- What did you say?
- Tony.
Sorry.
I'm just checking on the suit.
Okay.
Check the heart.
Is it the brain?
No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me?
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.
Sorry, I gotta split.
Badge.
- Badge.
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that the human element of human resources is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start phasing it out immediately.
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.
- However...
- I do appreciate it.
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not...
It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's trying to hide something.
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you.
Did you clear this 4: -00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later, but right now, I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him and he used to ask me out all the time, so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper.
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
God, you look great.
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral" biotech research, my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though, wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a...
It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me.
What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA, in fact, is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
Oh, wait...
- Uh...
- Hello?
- Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face.
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Right.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference?
- Um...
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine.
They were tanking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.
- His what?
- Big brain.
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen, and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.
All right?
I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax.
- Seriously?
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing that ever happened to you and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know, if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!
I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R. who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears, it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, Tony.
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me now there's a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony any more and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.
But then, as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.
And I have no idea what it means.
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the...
What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
Uh, yeah.
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag
- at first, so...
Well, hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
Well, actually, it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay.
- So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been a radiation leak.
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.
At least, let me get you like, a hazmat suit you can...
- A Geiger counter or something like that.
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.
You ate without me already?
On date night?
- He was just...
- You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean we were just hosting you...
- ...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home or you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
- What?
- What?
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same since New York.
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things and then they're over, and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.
I tinker. I...
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...
Machines.
They're part of me.
A distraction.
Maybe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.
And you're gonna join me.
Better.
- Tony.
- Tony. Tony.
To...
Power down!
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.
I'll recalibrate the sensors.
Can we just... Just let me...
Just let me catch my breath. Hey, don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.
Can you regulate?
Yes, I can regulate.
- You sure about that?
- Yes.
- It's a decent batch.
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.
I mean, for understanding.
I'm sorry, buddy.
What are you doing, buddy?
You out by yourself?
A little date night?
Seeing your favourite chick flick, maybe?
Yeah, a little movie called The Party's Over, starring you and your junkie girlfriend.
Here's the ticket.
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.
Savin!
Help!
Help me!
True story about fortune cookies.
They look Chinese.
They sound Chinese.
But they're actually an American invention.
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff.
The Chinese Theatre.
Mr President,
I know this must be getting frustrating.
But this season of terror is drawing to a dose.
And don't worry,
- the big one is coming.
Your graduation.
- Hi.
- Oh!
Do you mind leaving that on?
Sure.
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.
One more thing. Make sure everyone wears their badges.
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.
Plus, my guys won't let anyone in without them.
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...
His reaction to the latest attack.
- Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon, it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man, here's my home address.
10880 Malibu Point.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?
- Bill me.
I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir,
drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.
Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.
Okay. What have we got here?
The name is an ancient Chinese war mantle meaning "advisor to the king."
South American insurgency tactics.
Talks like a Baptist preacher.
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess of 3, 000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile radius of the Chinese Theatre?
No, sir.
Talk to me, Happy.
When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again.
Factor in 3,000 degrees.
The Oracle cloud has completed analysis.
Accessing satellites
and plotting the last 12 months of thermogenic occurrences now.
Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.
Nope.
That. Are you sure that's not one of his?
It predates any known Mandarin attack.
The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Bring her around.
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3,000 degree Celsius.
That's two military guys.
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.
Are we still at ding-dong?
- We're supposed to be on total...
...security lockdown.
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?
There's only so much I can do, sir,
when you give the world's press your home address.
Right there is fine.
You're not the Mandarin.
Are you? Are you?
You don't remember.
Why am I not surprised?
Don't take it personally. I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
Gluten-free waffles, sir.
That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you, someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.
It's...
- With her.
- Tony?
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah,
- it's Maya Hansen.
- Ah...
Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.
Please don't tell me there's a 12-year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.
He's 13.
No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.
- She's not, really.
- No, not really. I...
- it was just one night.
- Yep.
That's how you did it, isn't it?
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.
Okay. We've been through this.
- Nope.
- Yep!
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.
This is how normal people behave.
I can't protect you out there.
Is... Is that normal?
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!
Calm down.
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.
You still haven't even told me you liked it.
I don't like it.
I asked you three...
You don't like it.
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?
That's not even up for discussion.
- Can we, um...
- I said no. What?
Do we need to worry about that?
I got you.
I got you first.
Like I said, we can't stay here.
Oh!
Move! I'm right behind you.
Oh!
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.
Go!
Ch, my God. Tony!
Sir, Ms Potts is clear of the structure.
Jarvis, where's my flight power?
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.
That's one.
Sir, the suit is not combat ready.
That's two.
Oh.
Tony!
Sir, take a deep breath.
Flight power restored.
Sir?
- Sir!
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.
That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below 5%.
Oh...
Oh!
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?
We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.
Why?
Jarvis. Not my idea.
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!
I gotta get Pepper.
I gotta...
I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.
Who asked you?
- Open the suit.
I...
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.
Open it, J.
That's brisk.
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...
I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.
- Jarvis.
Jarvis?
Don't leave me, buddy.
Stark secure server
now transferring to all known receivers.
Pepper, it's me.
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid, and it won't happen again.
Also, it's Christmastime and the rabbit's too big.
Done. Sorry.
And I'm sorry in advance because I can't come home yet.
I need to find this guy.
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.
I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.
Let's get you comfy.
You happy now?
Freeze!
Don't move.
You got me.
Nice potato gun.
Barrel's a little long.
Between that and the wide gauge it's gonna diminish your FPS.
And now you're out of ammo.
What's that thing on your chest?
It's an electromagnet.
You should know, you got a box of them right here.
What does it power?
Oh, my God.
That...
That's...
Is that Iron Man?
Technically, I am.
Technically, you're dead.
Valid point.
What happened to him?
Life.
I built him. I take care of him.
I'll fix him.
Like a mechanic?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" now.
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in, um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won, because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?
How'd you know that?
I got just the thing.
This is a piñata for a cricket.
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.
Point it away from your face, press the button on top, it discourages bullying.
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?
Deal? What do you say?
- Deal.
- Deal?
What's your name?
Harley. And you're...
The mechanic.
Tony.
You know what keeps going through my head?
"Where's my sandwich?"
Where is Tony Stark?
Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.
- Pepper, it's me.
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.
Why were you at the house tonight?
What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.
So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...
That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of 40 out of a privately funded think tank.
But sure, you can call me a botanist.
This boss of yours, does he have a name?
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.
Well, we took the house down, sir. But there's no sign of a body.
- Mmm-hmm. I see.
- No Stark.
I have to go.
The master is about to record and he's a little...
Well, you know how he gets.
Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done.
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.
Unless you want to get shot in the face.
Report in.
Path is clear.
The master is travelling.
Well, then, what are we waiting for?
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do.
By the way, when you said your sister had a watch...
- Yeah?
- ...I was kind of hoping for something a little more adult than that.
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.
When can we talk about New York?
Maybe never.
Relax about it.
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.
What's the official story here?
What happened?
I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell, on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.
You know what this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.
That giant Wormhole in, um, in New York.
Does it remind you?
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.
Are they coming back? The aliens?
Maybe. Can you stop?
Remember what I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Does this subject make you edgy?
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?
Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?
- Do you have medication?
- No.
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.
Are you going completely mental?
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?
Remember when I said to stop doing that?
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.
Ah, man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
What did I say?
- Hey! Wait up!
Wait, wait.
- What the hell was that?
Your fault.
You spazzed me out.
- Okay, back to business.
- Where were we?
The guy who died.
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?
Where she always is.
See? Now, you're being helpful.
Uh...
Sorry.
Lady?
Is this, uh...
Thank you.
Nice haircut. it suits you.
Nice watch.
Yeah. A limited edition.
Oh, I don't doubt it.
Well, have a good evening.
Excuse me.
Mrs Davis?
Mind if I join you?
Free country.
Sure is.
All right.
Where would you like to start?
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.
I want to know what you think happened.
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.
Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.
Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Huh?
Supposed to meet someone here?
Yeah.
Mrs Davis, your son didn't kill himself.
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.
What?
As a weapon.
You're not the person that called me after all, are you?
Actually, I am.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?
- It's called an arrest.
- Sheriff, is it?
Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?
Homeland Security. We good here?
No, we're not "good."
I need a little more information than that.
Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.
Yeah?
Well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and, uh, upgrade me?
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way, but, uh, the fun way is always good.
Deputy, get this woman out of...
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.
Watch this.
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.
That's all you got?
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.
- Let me go!
- Help me!
Anyway.
Hey, kid, what would you like for Christmas?
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,
"I want my goddamn file."
It's not your fault, kid.
Remember what I told you about bullies?
You like that, Westworld?
That's the thing about smart guys,
- we always cover our ass.
Ah!
You're welcome.
For what? Did I miss something?
Me, saving your life.
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.
And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz.
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.
Unlike you?
Admit it, you need me.
We're connected.
What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit, and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay?
Can you feel that? We're done here.
Move out of the way, or I'm gonna run you over.
Bye, kid.
I'm sorry, kid.
You did good.
So, now you're just gonna leave me here, like my dad?
Yeah.
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me, aren't you?
I'm cold.
I can tell.
You know how I can tell?
Because we're connected.
It was worth a shot.
You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.
It goes with any decor...
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.
I'm trying.
There's nothing I can...
Well, where is the feed coming from?
I don't know, it's in all of our receivers and I...
The entire East Coast, the satellites are down.
It's not just our station.
What about a backup manual?
We have an unauthorised broadcast cutting through...
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.
Oh, God, not again.
Is the President getting this?
Mr President.
Only two lessons remain.
And I intend to finish this before Christmas morning.
Meet Thomas Richards.
Good strong name.
Good strong job.
Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.
I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.
No!
The number for this telephone is in your cell phone.
Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there?
America,
if your president calls me in the next half-minute,
Tom fives.
Go!
How did he hack my phone?
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...
I have to make this call.
I'd strongly advise against that.
This is the right thing to do.
There's just one lesson left, President Ellis.
So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye.
Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you.
I'll see you soon.
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.
Don't move!
Uh...
Hang on a second.
Hello?
You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
Yeah, I've had that.
Who is this?
It's me, pal.
Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me.
What are you doing?
A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan.
What are you doing?
Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
Yeah.
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."
And password, please.
Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.
It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more.
Give me your login.
With an all caps.
Yeah, okay.
That is so much better than "Iron Patriot."
Very nice. Very nice.
I have one question for you.
What would you like for Christmas this year?
Well, David...
Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...
One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody!
All right.
Because you erase my shows!
That ain't gonna cut it.
We talked about this.
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know who...
Shh.
Morn, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.
I knew you were still alive!
Come on in. Close the door.
Oh, wow.
Can I just say, sir...
Yep.
I am your biggest fan.
Okay. First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?
No, no, no. Just us.
Great. What's your name?
- Gary.
- Gary.
- Oh, wow.
- Right there is fine.
- Okay.
Okay?
I get a lot of this, it's okay.
- Oh, good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.
I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you.
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.
Right.
I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you...
Boom!
- A Hispanic Scott Baio.
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...
I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture.
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.
I got an issue.
I'm chasing bad guys.
I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files.
I don't have enough juice.
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?
Recalibrate the ISDNs.
Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.
Yeah.
Tony needs Gary.
And Gary needs Tony.
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.
What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?
Well, uh, I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.
Will you please state your name for the camera?
Ellen Brandt.
Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically.
Addiction will not be tolerated.
And those who cannot regulate will be cut from the programme.
Once misfits, cripples...
You are the next iteration of human evolution.
Everybody, before we start...
I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter
as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego.
Today is your glory.
Let's begin.
We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!
Get her out!
Get them out of here!
A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?
It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you?
Sold it to the Mandarin.
Got you, pal.
What happened?
Fun fact.
Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel.
He stargazed.
Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London?
"The rocket performed perfectly."
"It just landed on the wrong planet."
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.
And then the ego steps in, the obsession.
And you look up, you're a long way from shore.
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.
I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.
That's exactly what we used to do.
So, don't judge yourself.
Thank you, Pepper.
I really appreciate that.
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.
Maya, run!
Hi, Pepper.
So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?
I'm trying to fix this thing.
I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark.
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.
This is support team Blue-Zero.
Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Copy.
Nobody move.
Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear,
I think you messed up again.
Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before.
It's... Of course.
Yes, ma'am.
Iron Patriot on the job.
Happy to help.
No need to thank me, ma'am.
It's my pleasure.
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.
If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.
That's the plan, Colonel.
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.
Jarvis, how are we?
It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,
and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.
And, sir, you were right.
Once I factored in available AIM down/ink facilities
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now.
Harley, where is he really?
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
Uh, it's not charging.
Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?
- It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
- I don't wanna...
Oh, God, not again.
- Tony?
Are you having another attack?
I didn't even mention New York.
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
Okay, um, uh...
God, what am I gonna do?
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.
You're a mechanic, right?
Right.
You said so.
Yes, I did.
Why don't you just build something?
Okay.
Thanks, kid.
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.
My fault again.
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...
Well.
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.
- Ah!
Nessie.
Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
There's some guy over here.
They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.
Hey!
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Don't move.
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.
Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
Heard enough.
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.
Where?
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.
- It is.
- It's complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.
Sit.
- Ew!
- Oh, Jesus.
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.
What are you?
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
- Next?
- Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions.
"He"?
- Killian?
- Killian.
- He created you?
- He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation of Western iconography.
Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
Ah...
Okay.
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.
Yeah?
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
You know what my old man used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule from behind the scenes.
Because the second you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept EXTREMIS or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?
The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.
- I'm good like that.
Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.
- All right. Let's go.
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons.
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.
- Three, four...
- Shut up.
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Told you.
Where's the rest?
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.
Ah! Better late than never.
Not this time.
Not the face.
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.
Oh, hello, sir.
All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
- Ah! Let's go!
Aw, crap.
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours?
- Uh... Mmm.
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners.
What have you come as?
You make a move, and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what?
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.
Spill.
Do you know what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
Olé, olé, olé, olé...
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well.
Is that...
Is that important?
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.
So?
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right.
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
- vice president thing, right?
- Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out the president somehow.
We have to immediately alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.
Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
And what about the suit I'm wearing?
The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
Everything all right, Colonel?
It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.
Image coming through now, sir.
Was that Rhodes?
Is anyone there?
Let us out!
The President.
Now.
He's not here.
Try the jet stream?
Speaking of which, go fish.
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.
How many in the air?
Thirteen, sir.
- How many can I carry?
- Four, sir.
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?
Oh, God! No! No!
Listen to me.
See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it?
- What? Oh!
I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
18,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
10,000 feet.
6,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
1,000 feet.
400 feet.
200 feet, sir.
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.
Hello.
We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...
That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
The House Party protocol sir?
Correct.
Hi.
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
Trophy.
Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me, right?
I hope not.
Oh, my God.
He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Viking funeral.
Public execution.
Yeah, death by oil.
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.
Okay. That's good.
Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
Is your gun up?
Yep. What do I do?
Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.
Six, high, back. All right.
You see that? Nailed it.
Yeah, you really killed the glass.
You think I was aiming for the bulb?
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
All personnel, we have hostiles
- on east unit 12.
- Over there!
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.
You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.
Here we go.
Three guys, one girl, all armed.
God, I would kill for some armour right now.
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.
You know what?
Is that...
Yep.
- Are those...
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas, buddy.
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.
Disable with extreme prejudice.
Yes, sir.
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.
Take them to church.
Gentlemen.
Incoming!
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.
This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?
Everybody needs a hobby.
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?
Nice timing.
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
What does that mean?
I got you covered.
Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?
Very funny.
Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
About time.
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
You're such a jerk.
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.
Come on. A little more, baby.
- Oh!
Is this guy bothering you?
Don't get up.
Ooh.
Is it hot in there?
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?
Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.
Oh, Tony.
- She's watching.
I think you should close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.
- Yeah, you take a minute.
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!
Oh, come on!
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.
Just hold on. Hold on.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Brace yourself.
You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back.
The President is secure, Tony
- I'm clearing the area.
- Nice work.
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.
- Just look at me!
Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there.
All right?
You've got to let go.
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.
- No!
A shame. I would've caught her.
Eject.
Well, here we are on the roof.
Mark 42, inbound.
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.
Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.
Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
No...
No more false faces.
You said you wanted the Mandarin.
You're looking right at him.
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.
I am the Mandarin!
I got nothing.
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage!
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?
Whoo!
Honey?
Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?
It'll do.
And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons.
- Oh!
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you...
...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
No, look.
So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour, it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
You know, and thank you by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off my chest,
and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know.
Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
- And the fact that you've been able to
- help me process...
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training.
- So?
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what?
Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
- 1983, all right?
- Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
Well, well, Boris the Animal has a visitor.
I guess one every 40 years is okay.
It's a cake.
I decide what it is.
Looks like some kind of cake.
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...
Oh, God.
Boris the Animal...
...you've got a visitor.
It's just Boris.
Your letters have been a soul-nourishing...
...tonic.
And you are much more...
...unconventionally handsome than your photos.
This ain't a conjugal visit.
So quit your conjugating.
When's the last time you conjugated anything?
I see you've brought me a treat, darling.
Would you mind cutting this up for us? It's a special day.
I'm a romantic like that.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
Why's that?
It'll ruin your figure.
You complete me.
The big one.
Boris! You promised to take me with you!
We had a deal!
Obadiah Price.
Yes. I did make you a promise.
Wait. I smell something.
You can't win, Boris.
Let's agree to disagree.
There's too many of us.
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?
Good afternoon.
Please give your attention to my associate, Agent J.
He's going to demonstrate an electro-biomechanical...
...neural-transmitting, zero-synapse repositioner.
We call it the neuralyzer.
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.
Thank you, Agent K.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will look right here.
You know how you're on a plane and you're asked to turn your phone off?
You're like, "I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.
It gets up there, bounces around on the satellites and:
Just turn your damn phone off.
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff tonight because your GPS don't work.
Check the composition of the fuel units and surface deposits.
I wanna know who was driving.
Yes, sir.
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Don't worry.
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.
Seriously, I'm not even sure that's meat.
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.
Thanks, Manny.
That does not belong in a pita, it belongs in a casket.
What would go good with this would be silence.
See, here's the problem.
You can't smell it...
...because your nose already smells like that, but my nose doesn't.
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.
Let me enjoy this.
Whoa, enjoyment.
So that's what enjoyment looks like on that face. I like that emotion.
I keep emotion out of it.
Out of what, K? Life?
You don't wanna run it by me?
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.
That thing people do when they change their facial expression?
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.
And I have written a hell of a speech for him.
People will be moved.
And now a few words from Agent K.
I worked with Zed for over 40 years, and in all that time...
...he never invited me to dinner.
He never asked me to his house to watch a game.
He never shared a single detail of his personal life.
Yeah, he was weird.
Thank you.
And now we will hear from our new chief, Agent O.
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.
When I told the Finucian Zyglot about Zed's passing...
...she said something that I'm going to repeat.
And I'm paraphrasing.
That's just so Zed.
Thank you.
You lose something over here, Hondo?
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll do better than that at my funeral?
You know, something like:
"J was a friend.
Now there's a big part of me that's gone.
Oh, J, all the things that I should have said...
...except I was too old...
...and craggy and surly...
...and just tight. I was too...
...tight.
I'm gonna just miss your caramel-brown skin."
I'll wing something.
K, it's O. We have reports of several humans suffering from...
...intestinal worms of alien origin.
Thank you, O.
How did you get to be like you?
Something happened, K.
What happened?
You know how I live such a happy life?
How you live such a happy life?
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.
That's deep.
Jeffrey.
Do I know you?
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.
You were in Lunar-Max.
There is no prison that can hold me.
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?
The device.
I'm going back in time to kill a man before he takes my arm.
K, J!
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?
You no hungry?
Show us the tanks, Wu.
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.
Show us the tanks in the back.
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?
Save the chop-socky bullshit for the tourists, Wu.
Hey, what you guys wanna bust my balls for, huh?
You don't have no balls.
Man, you look like you come from the planet...
...Damn.
And Bob here is a clear violation of Health Ordinance 32:
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...
...foodstuffs.
That is an Earth fish.
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...
...that's a hate crime!
It would be...
...if you were Chinese.
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?
Nobody.
Who's it for?
I keep them in case!
- In case what?
- I don't know!
Anybody!
All right, you slug.
Wu...
...he and I are having issues right now, but you shouldn't suffer for that.
Thank you, J.
So if you don't like getting fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.
On behalf of my pathetic self and worthless children, you stay.
Allow me most honorable benefit of serving you favorite noodles, K?
Don't nobody want your nasty-ass noodles.
You're a piece of shit, Wu.
Shrimp and bok choy.
We're gonna be here for a while.
That was just mean.
What you did to Wu back there.
Snatched his skirt off.
That's just disrespectful.
I used to play a game with my dad:
What'll You Have For Your Last Meal.
You could do worse than this.
Okay.
I played a game with my dad...
...called catch.
Except I'd throw the ball and it'd just hit the wall...
...because he wasn't there.
Don't badmouth your old man.
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.
It's not right.
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...
...just drank his fourth cup...
...of duck sauce.
K, the crashed ship...
...from this morning was stolen from...
Lunar-Max.
Boris the Animal.
How did you know?
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.
Give us a minute, chief.
We're in a situation.
Oh, yeah.
I take the Chloropod.
You take the Tarantabee.
And the Hydronian over there.
I'll take the kitchen.
Meet you on the street.
This is a very confusing time...
...in my life.
Hey.
Keep your mouth closed, keep your head down.
Hello, K.
Boris the Animal.
It's just Boris.
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.
Yes, my arm.
We've thought about that moment...
...every day for the last 40 years.
Well, that's just not living a full life.
I can promise you it will be longer than yours.
Lonelier too. Since you're the last Boglodite standing.
We'll see about that.
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.
Yo, K.
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.
You don't know it, K, but you're already dead.
You all right?
May I have everyone's attention, please?
Thank you.
You know how your kid won the goldfish in that little baggie...
...from the fair and you didn't want it in your house...
...so you told your kid it ran away when you flushed it down the toilet?
Well, this is what happens.
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.
Man, I am getting too old for this.
I can only imagine how you feel.
Boris the Animal.
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.
Why? Was he innocent?
Should have killed him.
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.
- No.
- Leave it alone.
It's above your pay grade.
We have the same pay grade.
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit of that bass out your voice.
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is running around, this is my business.
You forget about Boris or my report will reflect...
...that your conduct has been unbecoming.
Well, maybe my report is gonna reflect some shit too, K.
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.
Four weeks.
How about I quit?
There are things out there you don't need to know.
That's not the lie you told me when you recruited me.
What up, pops?
- Lose your partner?
- Yeah.
Next shuttle to Afazumba...
...leaving in 22 minutes.
Search...
...Boris the Animal.
Boris the Animal, Boglodite assassin.
Boglodites were a rogue alien race...
...that consumed all planets in their path.
Boris the Animal was the only suspect...
...in a series of alien murders on Earth.
Incident report.
Boris the Animal was convicted...
...for the following murders that occurred on July 15, 1969.
Murder number one: Coney Island,
Murder number two: The Factory.
Refine search.
Agent K.
Junior Agent K apprehended and arrested...
...Boris the Animal on July 16, 1969, at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
- Cape Canaveral...
- Agent K...
...received highest commendation for heroic action...
...including implementation...
...of the Arc Net Defense System...
...which protected the Earth from Boglodite invasion...
...and led to the race's extinction.
Details.
Access restricted.
Excuse me? Clearance level senior agent, class one. J.
Access denied.
What?
So why this sudden interest in your partner's old exploits?
What happened between Boris and K?
That's easy.
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.
He protected the Earth from the Boglodites.
He did his job.
That's not what I'm asking.
Cape Canaveral, what happened?
Something that changed him.
Leave it at that.
So you two go way back, huh?
That's classified.
A word of advice, Agent J.
Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to.
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.
He's a very wise man.
Take the rest of the night off.
What?
Guess I owe you some answers, hoss.
What, you're feeling chatty all of a sudden?
I can't talk right now. I've got secret cases of my own I'm working on.
I hate to tear you away from your video game.
All right, I'm hanging up.
You know the most destructive force in the universe?
Sugar?
Regret.
You don't have to wait. Just talk.
I promised you the secrets of the universe. Nothing more.
So there's secrets out there the universe don't know about?
Mommy.
Can I help you?
K?
5K.
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?
Can I...? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what...
Mommy, the president is drinking...
...my milk.
I'm sorry.
He didn't say please.
- K get in yet?
- Who?
You new?
Very funny, Agent J.
J, everything you told me yesterday, you were right as rain.
- Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
- Who are you?
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...
...but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stop talking.
It's like I closed this emotional window.
But I threw a brick through that window.
Thank you for handing me that brick, J.
Whoever you are, give me five feet or I'll pluck you in your throat.
I'm gonna go to the little Men's-in-Black room...
...then we'll go find those morons from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.
Who was that?
Double A? Your partner.
I need you to go get me some chocolate milk, all right?
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?
Did he call in sick or anything?
Who's K?
All right, all right, go ahead, go ahead.
K!
All right.
You got me.
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.
Oh, and all of you, fantastic performances.
You waited 14 years to develop a sense of humor...
...but this is a good one.
But I need you to come out here now...
...because I'm starting to get a little pissed off.
Agent J, would you mind keeping your voice down...
...and telling me who you're looking for?
I'm looking for K.
Who is K?
You too? You too.
I mean, who is he to you?
My partner.
Older gentleman, 110...
...maybe 111 years old.
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening with him. He smiles like this.
Seen him around?
I'll take you to K.
Thank you.
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.
He's been dead for over 40 years.
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke is that it be funny.
It's never been funny.
Computer, Agent K and Boris the Animal.
Men in Black incident report, July, 1969.
Location, Cape Canaveral.
Perpetrator Boris the Animal escaped and fled Earth.
Assumed to have returned to planet
Boglodotia 20 light-years away.
Agent K pronounced dead at scene.
Awarded posthumous commendation...
...for action which prevented greater loss of human life.
That's not what happened.
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...
- Agent K is dead.
- Well, I just talked to him last night.
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.
Every stakeout, endless hours of cowboy music.
Every morning with his coffee...
...he'd say, "I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?
- It was ground this morning."
- "This morning."
How do you know that?
Chocolate milk, sir?
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.
Wait.
How long have you been craving chocolatized dairy products?
Just today.
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?
Loss of balance?
Agitation? Depression?
Hell, yeah.
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...
...by a Hovartian brain tick...
...and could die in horrible agony at any moment.
Damn it. It's not the tick.
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?
It's something worse than the tick?
Your obsession with chocolate milk indicates...
...that you might be involved in a temporal fracture.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Chocolate milk relieves temporal-fracture headaches.
What's a temporal fracture?
A break in the timeline.
Don't know what you mean.
Time travel! Time travel.
There's no such thing as time travel.
- Well, there is.
- No.
There's not.
Because if there were...
...a class-one senior agent such as myself...
...would have been aware of it, wouldn't he have?
Were it not classified and way above his pay grade.
You know, I need a raise.
There was one man, scumbag, Obadiah Price.
He figured it out, we busted him, we made time travel illegal...
...throughout the universe and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.
No... That's where Boris was locked up.
If Boris worked out how to time jump...
...he could seriously change the course of history.
Attention.
Early warning system engaged.
Inbound hostile warships entering solar system.
Boglodite markings and language detected.
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite, but they're extinct.
Apparently not.
Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.
Put up the Arc Net.
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defense system.
K got it for the Boglodites.
There is no K.
He's been dead for over 40 years.
No K. No defense system.
Boris jumped back and killed him.
If you wanna save the world, stop that from happening.
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.
Let's hope the little squirt hasn't skipped town.
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...
...on batteries.
Okay, we got other stuff, like headphones, adapters or...
You helped Boris the Animal time jump.
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.
He killed my partner.
I want to know when and where you sent him.
What, you think I keep, like, a logbook?
Target vector, July 16...
- All right.
That's a real bummer about your buddy.
I'm sure he was a great guy.
But in terms of the space-time continuum...
...your friend was a little blip on the historical radar!
That's a big blip.
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me...
...back to July 15th, 1969.
No, that's a stupid plan, because I sent Boris to July 16th.
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...
...before the older one shows.
That way, neither of them will even exist.
That's why you get to wear the black suit.
No?
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...
...New York was like a big-ish city.
So how are you gonna really find him?
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney island.
You're gonna get there first and be waiting?
Dude, they should give you two black suits.
My man, for real?
Oh, right.
Sorry.
This...
...is the real deal. Time-jump gear.
Very rare, very old.
But first, we gotta get high.
Hey. No.
No. No, I mean, really high.
Hey, man? A little help here?
Thank you.
Okay.
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.
Okay. You wanna save your partner, word of advice:
Stay away from him.
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.
Now, take these.
It gets pretty windy on the way down.
The way down?
With eyes tearing up, it's hard to read the dial.
Plus, it helps you look like a real time traveler, which is cool.
I am not jumping off of this building!
Time jump.
Okay, now...
...I gotta set this thing...
...to the 15th.
That seems...
...right-ish.
Now...
...all you gotta do is jump.
Hey, hey, stop. Stop it.
When you're moving fast enough...
...that circle is gonna fill up with some sort of green time-travel liquid...
...and it's gonna glow really bright.
As soon as that happens, break that blue laser line...
...with your thumb to complete the circuit.
At this height, that should be...
Let's see, mass of Earth and 30-something feet per minute...
It's 32 feet per second. Per second.
That sounds right-ish.
So that would be, I guess, about two feet off the ground.
I break the laser line?
No, don't break it!
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!
Do I break the laser line or do I not break the laser line?
Do not lose that time device...
...or you will be stuck in 1969!
It wasn't the best time for your people.
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.
How will I know if it works?
You'll either know...
...or you won't.
You must really love this guy to do this.
Oh, wait. How come I remember K, but nobody else does?
- That means you were there!
- I was where?
If you survive, you gotta come back and tell me everything.
Where was I?
You gotta go!
Just go, go, go!
Oh, no!
Come on!
- My man, what's today?
- Tuesday.
- The date?
- The 15th.
- Of?
- July.
- Dog, the year.
Thank you.
Look at me like I'm crazy.
Far out.
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury like you wouldn't believe.
Okay, we're here.
- Happy?
- You're such a pill, Fred.
- Get us checked in.
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey. Hey, do me a favor, all right?
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.
I paid a lot of money for that luggage.
- We'll take good care...
- Last time, it got scuffed up.
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.
There's more in the trunk.
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?
Let's go!
Far out, man!
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.
Make love, not war.
I prefer to do both.
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.
Yes, and it has a roof, but it's hidden.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
An individual of your...
...particular ethnic persuasion?
Maybe he's a noted athlete.
Yes. Starting forward for the Detroit Darkies.
- Where'd you get the car?
- And the suit?
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...
...suit from your grandmother.
Hey.
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.
I have rights and I demand to see my lawyer...
...before you press that small button on the side firmly.
Press it.
That, gentlemen, is a standard-issue neuralyzer.
You're not gonna remember that.
And just because you see a black man driving a nice car...
...does not mean it's stolen.
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.
I'll be done with the car in a minute!
Just find it and take it back to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.
Where is the Archanan?
You are too late.
He is going to give the humans...
...the Arc Net.
Let's agree to disagree.
We'll take it from here.
K?
K! K!
Dad, I'm on Earth.
I need bail.
Will the owner of a blue warp-speed cruiser...
...please report to the front desk.
You need to turn the electricity down on that damn thing.
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.
How do you know my name?
What? Because I called you "K"?
No, I call everybody K.
It's kind of my thing.
What up, K?
All right, I sort of...
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Some people like it.
Most people.
Now that I know what you look like...
...when you're lying, show me...
...what you look like when you're telling the truth?
I won those at Coney island on the ring toss.
I won a stuffed bear once, but never one of these.
Must be good, slick.
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.
I was waiting for my girl, who, by the way...
...is probably worried sick looking for me right now.
So I just need my things and I need to get back to her.
What's her name?
Your gal, what's her name?
Schtaron.
Schtaron?
I bet Schtaron likes that suit of yours.
What, it's a crime to wear a black suit?
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset about the whole Coney island incident.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.
O?
No, I call ladies "O."
To me, O is feminine, K is masculine.
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."
What a mess. Any casualties?
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.
Any human casualties?
No, sir.
Who the hell is this?
Look, I was...
- Stray human caught in the net.
- Code 43 him and throw him back.
You're late for a meeting with the Viagrans.
They have a revolutionary new pill.
It's really...
Okay, slick.
I was waiting for my girl.
Schtaron.
Yes, she's Greek.
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyzer!
You have a lot of information for a fella who doesn't know anything.
I see what you're saying.
You know, K, we need to hold up a second.
K!
Let's get this bite guard in here.
Hey, back up, back up.
K, listen, I think we got off on the wrong foot, all right?
So let's just stop for a second and talk.
Don't put me in here, K!
Too late, hoss.
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!
K!
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!
I'll just use my imagination.
K, the killer...
...you're looking for, I'm after the same guy. A Boglodite.
His name is Boris.
Ship has sailed, amigo.
If we don't get him, there'll be two.
You had my undivided attention.
One will have one arm...
...and one's gonna have two. K!
Listen to me!
If you erase me...
...you erase the world!
Fifteen seconds...
...to neuralyzation. Fourteen.
Thirteen. Twelve.
Eleven. Ten. Nine.
When you see Boris tomorrow, K, kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!
Four. Three. Two.
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!
It's whirring and buzzing.
I don't know if I don't know nothing.
I knew Roman.
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...
...he was my friend.
Last chance, who are you and what do you know?
I'm an agent...
...from the future. We're partners.
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...
...and 14 years after that, the guy you didn't let me kill today...
...escapes from prison, jumps to the past...
...and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...
...so, really, we need to go right now.
All right.
So that's the story you believe.
That one was the truth.
Wasn't the whole truth, but it'll do for now.
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.
The problem with a lie is once you start lying you put yourself...
Agent K.
What's he still doing here?
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.
I put my pants on.
Okay, future man, where to?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?
No. I mean, we don't really talk.
What kind of partners sit in a car every day for 14 years and don't talk?
Exactly. And this is the type of problem it causes.
It's dysfunctional.
All right, sport, you better get useful real quick or you go back in room 43.
Man...
There was something in the file about a factory.
Something happened at a factory.
Hey, look, man, you can put your Jedi Knight on me all you want.
That's all I got.
That spark something?
Roman had this on his person when he was murdered.
It's a matchbook.
No, it's a clue.
He didn't smoke.
You lose something over here, Hondo?
No.
Hey, man, how old are you?
Twenty-nine.
You got some city miles on you.
I'm starting to understand why we don't talk.
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.
Sure thing, slick.
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in with you!
You sit tight. I'll be fine.
Wait, no! No!
K!
K, don't go in by yourself!
Hi, fellas.
Need to see the boss.
He's busy.
Well, I'm gonna just take a look around.
Looks like we have ourselves a standoff.
Looks that way.
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.
Now, where were we?
I was about to tell you to screw off.
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?
MiB league champ, three years running.
Well, let's see it.
You did not walk into my...
...establishment and rip my head off!
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.
I'll tell him this!
All right, your head.
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...
...and make sure you...
...walk funny for the rest...
...of your miserable last days on Earth!
Tough spare, slick.
You messed with the wrong head!
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us...
...where Dom is?
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.
Come on, I just cleaned the bathroom with this thing!
No cleaning! No cleaning!
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.
But he's not gonna talk to Men in Black scum like you.
Now give me back my head.
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."
That ain't a finger hole...
...you sick bastard!
I'll pop your head off...
...and see how you like it.
I'm gonna kill both of you!
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!
I'll kill you both!
- Well, we're on the right track.
- Just the wrong train.
If he had any secrets...
...I'm guessing he spilled them.
A smart man figures out what victims have in common.
A smart man would.
That's a big-ass phone.
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.
How's your day been, Agent K?
Fair to middling.
How are things going?
Very good, thank you.
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.
I need cleanup and containment at Cosmic Lanes.
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.
Now Roman was a Byvoid, correct me if I'm wrong...
- ...from the same planetary grouping?
- A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...
...wiped out by Boglodites.
Wasn't the third planet...?
- Glamouria?
- Glamouria.
Thank you, Miss O.
I know where Boris is headed to next.
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.
Look, if Boris turns out to be here, I'm gonna kill him...
- ...I need my gun.
- No deal.
I've been an agent for 14 years.
Which means I'm the senior agent on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...
...but I am instructing my junior agent...
...that's you, to give me my gun right now. That's an order.
No, no, no, space gun.
You're welcome.
I didn't say thank you.
For such an ungainly species, they've thrived on Earth.
I was an agent for three years...
...before I realized all models were aliens.
Found out the hard way.
Password?
Hey, look, funky '60s dude, we don't have a lot of time.
Janis Joplin.
Is there anybody here who's not an alien?
Very nice.
Blink. That's good.
Look in the camera.
Is that Andy Warhol?
Yep.
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol, could we have a minute?
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.
Just a few...
...questions.
No questions. No answers.
Just being.
We have an urgent matter to discuss with you...
...regarding one of your party guests.
Why don't you come back...
...next week, after the happening...
...has happened.
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like talking slow. We got stuff to do.
I've got a planet to save.
You're distressing. Everything...
...about you upsets me.
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?
Agent W, your cover is safe.
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?
Safe?
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...
...I'm painting cans and bananas for chrissakes.
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.
Oh, thank you.
Who's the dumb-ass?
How about a little professional courtesy here?
- Dumb-ass.
- Say it again.
- Want me to?
- I dare you.
Dumb-ass.
- Agents.
- I have no problem...
...pimp-slapping the shiznit out of Andy Warhol.
What?
Why are you looking at me?
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...
...you see what information you can get from Agent W...
...and I'll go case the perimeter.
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.
- How about that?
- Oh, cute.
- Okay.
- Very nice.
Someone forget his nap?
Hey, how you doing?
Chilling.
Who's that guy?
Don't tell me he's your new partner.
Actually, he's my old partner.
He traveled back from the future...
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Andy, Yoko's here.
Yoko's here.
Tell her that I'm filming this man eating a hamburger.
It's transcendent.
All right, now the pickle.
What are you doing on my turf?
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.
We believe he's gonna hit here next, a Glamourian.
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.
He's gotta be after the Archanan.
Archanans are extinct.
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.
The whole Roswell circuit's all abuzz about it.
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.
His name's Griffin.
Griffin the Archanan.
How's it going?
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.
Unless we're in the future...
...where the muscle boy argues with his girlfriend.
She storms off and bumps the guy with the stuffed mushrooms...
...who dumps the tray on the sailors on leave.
A shoving match breaks out.
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.
Or it's the future where the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...
...causes me gastric distress.
Thankfully, your friend offers the antacids he carries...
...in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...
...before he has a chance to offer me the antacids...
...so on the whole, I'd have to say not good. I am not good.
But that depends.
K!
How will we find this guy?
What am I, a schmuck?
He's here?
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.
They can live in and visualize an infinite set...
...of time-space probabilities simultaneously.
Sounds like fun. Good work.
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.
You gotta fake my death, okay?
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.
K, I can't tell the women from the men.
May I see your watch?
Oh, it is 7:18.
No, no, your other watch, the one your father gave you.
How do you know about my father's watch?
Oh, dear.
This is the one where Roman is dead...
...and the gentleman at the bowling alley. So much death.
Such an infinitesimally small chance for success.
K!
Griffin, right?
We're here...
Because of Boris.
We think he's coming...
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...
...unless we're in...
...the future where he made the lights...
...and is about...
...to shoot from the door...
...in which case we're all dead.
Good, that was a close one.
K, I need a space gun.
The Boglodites...
...consume any planet in their path.
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.
I tried to stop them, but if we stop them here, if we deny them Earth...
...we can stop them.
They'll starve before...
...they reach the next planet.
Sixty-three seconds.
How do we do that? Stop them?
What?
Sorry. I have something for you.
A gift. It can protect you.
I had to hide it from Boris, but if you find me again...
...I'll give it to you.
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!
What do you mean? What miracle?
Thirty seconds. I have to go.
No, we got you.
Negative possibilities are multiplying as we speak.
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.
All right.
We got it, relax.
If your watch is broken and I have gastric...
Fly! Find your place in the world!
Oh, dear.
Boris is coming through that door...
...in 12...
Wait!
Did you have chocolate milk?
Yes.
Cindy.
K!
- Griffin!
- Got him.
Damn it!
I'm good, I'm good.
What you got?
Damn it! We had him!
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.
First of all, my name is J, okay?
It's not "son," it's not "slick" and it damn sure ain't no "Cochise."
I'm not gonna relax because we're running out of time...
...and there's an invasion coming.
You're not really recognizing my voicial intensity.
But there was one guy who could help.
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?
He's gone. If Boris gets to him before we do, that's no bueno.
We need pie.
- What?
- My granddaddy always said:
"if you got a problem you can't solve...
...it helps to get out of your head." Pie.
- Pie?
- Yeah.
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?
We've been doing smart stuff:
We've been following clues, doing police work.
It might be time we do something stupid.
Something that ain't got nothing to do with nothing.
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.
Sounds good.
Have any specials?
He'll have what he always has after he reads the menu for 10 minutes...
...and asks about specials.
A slice of apple pie with a nasty piece of cheddar.
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.
It's my last meal, I'm gonna splurge.
World-class serial killer out there and we're having pie.
What do you do in your spare time, stretch?
See, I sense you're not embracing the concept here.
Pie don't work unless you let it.
I'm gonna let it.
And you say we don't talk?
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.
As long as it doesn't have to do with the case. Just let her rip.
What's up with you and O?
Me and O?
Yeah, you and O.
All right, all right.
All right, this is it.
A while back, I was assigned to keep tabs on a musician.
Mick Jagger?
He's in this British band, the Rolling Stones.
Rings a bell.
We believed he was on the planet to breed with Earth women.
So I was in London and that's when I met O.
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.
And we find ourselves in this pub, which is a bar, all right?
Warm beer and the worst food you ever ate.
We just played darts till the sun came up.
Neither of us wanted to leave.
What the hell happened to you, man?
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?
I got you.
I cannot believe this, freaking New York Mets.
Total losers!
It's a rough time to be a Mets fan.
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.
That's funny. The Mets actually win it all this year.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious.
I'm sure.
Look, three months from now, your buddies down there...
...are gonna be calling them the Amazing Mets...
...and the Miracle Mets.
What?
What you got there, hoss?
The Archanan said, "It's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."
I know where he is.
Told you to trust the pie.
If Griffin's here for a game, he's either too early or too late.
He's here. We just gotta find him before Boris does.
It's time to give you your things back...
...partner.
You get some pie in you, you get all mushy.
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.
Come on now! All right! Let's go...
...Mets!
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...
- ...Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?
You're just in time!
Unless this is the one where Robinson bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.
Are we missing something?
The game.
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.
This game doesn't happen till October.
It's always October...
...and November and March.
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.
Until then, they're all happening.
Like this one, it's my favorite moment in human history.
All the things that had to converge for the Mets to win the World Series.
They were in last place every single season until they won it all.
You said you had a gift.
That baseball...
...thrown for the last out of game five, manufactured in '62 by Spalding...
...of Chicopee, Massachusetts, was aerodynamically flawed...
...due to the horsehide being improperly tanned...
...because the tanner's wife left him...
...for a Puerto Rican golf pro...
The gift?
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.
It's a shield.
Shield.
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to...
...Davey Johnson...
...who became a player...
...because his dad couldn't find a football to give him for his birthday...
...it hits...
...his bat two micrometers too high...
...popping out to Cleon Jones...
...who would've been born Clara, a statistical...
...typist, if his parents didn't have an extra glass of wine that night...
...before going to bed.
A miracle...
...is what seems impossible but happens anyway.
I lost my planet.
I don't want you to lose yours.
It'll take a miracle, but if you pull this off...
...you'll be my new favorite moment...
...in human history.
Oh, dear.
I forgot to see this one coming.
Damn it!
Have these in the future?
No.
Get on.
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.
Balance pitch and yaw with bursts on the center stalk...
...between 80 and 100 psi.
I didn't understand...
...any of that!
- Gyro at zero gain.
- Lt is.
Pitch and yaw with short bursts on the center stalk.
I did!
Between 80 and 100 psi!
Got it.
The Arc Net! Give it to me!
This isn't the one where you get it!
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.
It'd be better with four wheels!
Two is, like, my minimum.
What happens if Boris gets the Arc Net?
Boglodite invasion, total destruction of Earth!
The box!
Good boy.
We gotta stop this guy!
I've been trying!
You haven't been trying?
Hey, slick.
In the future, we ever do the Texas two-step?
Yes, sir!
Did you get him?
Give me a sec.
Is he dead?
Negative.
He got away.
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.
I feel younger already.
You pathetic waste of Boglodite flesh.
I'd kill you right now, if I didn't value my own life.
- Who are you?
- Look at you.
Every mistake I've ever made, just waiting to happen.
What happened to my arm?
You lose it, shot off by a human.
No human could defeat me.
You spend the next 40 years in prison, chained up like an animal.
No prison can hold me!
They built one especially for us, on the moon.
No human has been to the moon...
...so they cannot have built it there already.
Stop arguing! You can avoid all of that if you just listen to me!
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!
That wasn't me, that was you!
What's your plan?
Prevent the Arc Net from being deployed.
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.
Didn't work.
With my help...
...we'll get the Arc Net, kill Agent K...
...the invasion will be successful...
...and we'll get to keep both...
...of our ar...! Stop...
...staring at it!
Listen.
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.
It's what we do.
You still have the Arc Net?
When you're being hunted by Boris the Animal...
...you get good at hiding things.
This will save your world.
Once it's outside the atmosphere, it gets...
...a whole lot bigger.
All you have to do is deploy it.
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?
It's just one small step.
The moon launch.
Cape Canaveral.
July 16th, 1969.
We got six hours to get to Florida.
Better get a move on, slick.
Wait, hold up.
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.
He has to be the...
Griffin.
What do you mean, alone?
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.
I need you to trust me.
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?
You're not going to Florida.
That ain't gonna happen, partner.
Look, K...
...please, I will not allow you to go to Florida.
Stop me.
You die there!
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.
Boris kills you there.
That's what I'm here for.
That's what I came back to stop.
Oh, dear. We're in this one.
K...
...I saw the file,
I looked at the report.
I said I told you everything...
That's for lying to me.
Look, I'm sorry, man!
That's for telling me the truth!
I'm trying to protect you...
...man!
The bitterest truth is better than the sweetest lies.
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.
He must deploy the Arc Net as he did before.
There's no other way.
K is the only hope in saving Earth.
Can I save him?
Is there any future where I save his life?
Yes.
But where there is death...
...there will always be death.
According to you, I've done this before.
So we know it's possible.
If you're half the agent you say you are...
...you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.
So are we partners? You tell me.
Let's go.
Agent K...
- ...how are you?
- I'm good.
Okay, group hug on the way to doing what we're doing.
This morning, man is about to launch himself on a trip to the moon...
...with the expectation of landing there.
Look, I gotta ask you.
If we pull this off, fix things the way they were...
...O and I, are we...?
A wise man once told me...
...don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to.
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.
Here they are.
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.
Jetpacks?
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.
There's a reason we don't have these in the future.
K, we gotta drive.
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan in five hours, chief.
Yeah, we can. The red button, standard issue in every MiB car.
Press the red button, goes into hyperdrive.
No red buttons yet, slick.
Come on, man.
Do you know...
...how to work this thing?
It's like with anything.
Just have to strap yourself in, hope for the best.
Isn't that right, Miss O?
Unfortunately, it is.
You ready, slick?
Let's get it.
This is gonna be interesting!
It's just minutes to the...
...historic launch of Apollo 11...
...with all going well.
I'm so glad this isn't one of the times we explode.
One of the times?
Oh, we got company.
The hell?
Is that a battery belt?
All right, I got it.
No, any reality that gets the shield deployed...
...is one where you tell the truth.
The truth?
The truth is the only path.
This is a restricted area!
Yes, sir, it is.
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.
We're from a secret government organization...
...that polices and monitors alien activity on and off planet Earth.
Here's the thing.
We have this special little metal thingy...
...that Griff gave us that we have to get on top of that rocket...
...to prevent an alien invasion.
That worked.
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.
Three trespassers. No lDs, but they've got weapons, sir.
Some kind I've never seen before.
What breed of fool do you have to be...
...to penetrate my site on the day of the most massive feat...
...attempted by mankind?
Watched by God, the population of the planet and my own...
- ...firstborn!
- Colonel?
Colonel, they had these.
They said they needed to put something on the rocket...
...for an invasion.
Thanks.
I got 10 minutes to launch.
If you pose a threat to that rocket, you tell me now and do not lie to me.
I told the truth last time.
Sir, this man came here from...
...the future to protect me...
...so I can attach a shield to the top of that rocket and save the world.
I need your help to do that.
Take them to the brig.
You're slipping, Griff.
Sir, if I may.
Corporal.
You men are no longer needed.
I'll take the prisoners.
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.
Follow me.
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?
Only what he needed to see.
I have to go now.
What? No, no, no. Come on.
You don't need me anymore.
All right, Griff, don't start flipping on me.
When Boris' arm is taken, the past will be as it was. K will survive.
He will not know you were ever here.
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?
When that happens, go home.
Leave.
You coming?
Yeah, all right!
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?
Anything's possible.
Oh, Griff.
I can never bear to watch this part.
Armstrong and Aldrin are scheduled...
...to set foot on the moon...
...on early Monday morning,
Eastern Daylight Time.
Where's Griffin?
Doing his own thing.
Gentlemen.
This elevator will take you to the top.
T o get the Arc Net outside the atmosphere...
...you need to strap it to the escape rocket above the capsule!
You do not want to be...
...anywhere near this rocket when it takes off!
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.
Some job you got there.
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.
What did Griff show you back there?
How important you are.
You and your partner.
If everything goes right the way we hope it does...
...I'm gonna end up getting out of here pretty quick...
...so I'm not gonna have a chance to say a proper goodbye.
If things go wrong, not gonna have a chance to, either.
So I guess win or lose, this is it.
I see why I recruited you.
You're a good man.
Good man.
Man, what the hell happened to you?
I told you, it still hasn't happened yet.
I'll take this one!
Naughty.
Get a pedicure if you get a second.
And liftoff.
Just passed the two-minute mark...
...in the countdown, and all is still go as we monitor our status board.
Astronauts report it feels good.
Power transfer is complete.
Neil Armstrong just reported back it's been a smooth countdown.
Hey!
Boris, can you give me a hand?
Hey.
Hey!
You hear me calling you?
Boris the Animal!
Hey!
Boris the Animal!
It's just Boris!
You're gonna lose.
Let's agree to disagree.
Hey!
Boris the Animal!
Right.
Left.
You're gonna lose.
Let's agree to disagree.
Hey!
Boris the Animal!
Right.
Left. Left.
Right.
That's not possible.
Let's agree to disagree.
That's not possible!
K!
I win! I'm better than me!
That's my partner.
That's my partner!
If we call this in...
- ...they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.
- How does that work?
- You got me.
Come on!
Get down!
Bingo.
Man, that is some next-level stuff.
You ever want to see more...
...I know a top-secret organization that could use a man like you.
I wish I could.
Thank you.
I'll see you around, K.
Look out!
Go ahead.
Arrest me.
Not this time.
"Where there's death, there will always be death."
Daddy! Daddy!
Hey.
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?
James.
James? That's a nice name.
Where's my dad?
What have you got there?
What is that?
My dad gave it to me.
We timed the launch.
Where is my daddy?
He...
He went to go do something very special.
And he wanted me...
...to stay here and take care of his best pal.
When is he gonna be back?
He...
James...
...if you look right here...
...I will tell you the only thing you ever need to know.
Your daddy is a hero.
My daddy is a hero?
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.
James?
You're late.
Sorry. Lost track of time.
How do you know that song?
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.
What do you know and what do you don't?
How do I know what I don't know?
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?
Yeah.
Boglodites?
Extinct for 40 years.
Perfect. Did we talk on the phone last night?
You hung up on me.
Yeah, I did.
But that was because of all those secrets...
...the universe doesn't know about.
But...
...I've realized that...
...last night was a long...
...long time ago.
And, really, I just want to say thank you.
It's been my privilege.
You know, there's a really high possibility now...
...that I might know some things you don't know.
I doubt it.
I bet I know what went down with you and O.
She's a fine lady, but you know the rules.
There's no fraternizing amongst agents.
I think y'all might have fraternized a time or two.
This is my new favorite moment in human history.
Unless this is the one where K forgot to leave a tip.
Almost forgot.
That was a close one.
BACKLIGHT
Hi you reached Jay and
Rachael's residence. please leave a message and we'll get back as soon as possible.
Have a great day!
Jay?
It's David.
Your friend, your neighbor,remember?
I know you're in there
Can you pick up the phone, please?
And by the way...
When are you gonna change that recording?
Come on...
Its been a year already.
Don't you think is been enough?
You can 't let what happened ruin your birthdays forever.
No disrespect.
I mean, I don't think Rachael would want to see you like this.
Life goes on.
You got to step out of the hole.
I'm worried about you, Jay.
Don't make today feel like a year ago.
Have you opened Rachael's gift already?
Don't keep staring at that box for the rest of your life.
What if it's perishable?
You better not let it rot.
Anyway...
I brought you some groceries, and...
Me and the guys, we bought you a little gift, so...
Nothing fancy, don't get your hopes high...
Just want you to know... you are not alone.
It is bad enough
That we all lost her..
Don't make us feel like we lost you, too.
Happy birthday, buddy.
To our friend,
Happy Birthday!
A new start needs to cut the ribbon!!!
Come on...
Please, make a U-turn.
Please, make a U-turn.
You are on the wrong course to your destination.
Please, make a U-turn.
You are on the wrong course to your destination.
Please, make a U-turn.
You are on the wrong course to your destination.
Please, make a U-turn.
You are on the wrong course to your destination.
Hello, officer...
Good morning, sir.
Did I do anything wrong?
It's seem so.
Can't park in this area without a permit.
Well, I thought in a place
 as empty as this,
How I can possible offend anyone?
Licence and registration, please.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
You, too.
In half a mile, turn left.
Hey sugar, grab a chair,
 I'll be right with you.
Thank you
Ready to order?
Yeah, just bring me the number two and a cup of coffe.
I'll get your coffee.
Thanks.
What the hell.
Stop it!
Hey, come back here!
Oh God. No.
Oh, God.
Oh, come on baby.
Come on baby, come on.
In one mile, turn right.
Thank you.
Oh yes, thank you.
Hi, David. it's me.
I just wanted to thank you for being my friend.
And for never giving up on me.
You must have noticed by now that my car is not in the garage and...
You are probably wondering,
 where the hell I am.
Well,you told me to leave
 the hole and so I did.
I don't  know where exactly where I'm heading
But I just want you to know that I'm alright.
Oh, by the way...
Thanks for the gift.
It means a lot to me..
Talk to you later.
Take care, buddy.
In half a mile, turn left.
Thank you.
In one mile, turn right.
Turn right.
You have arrived to your destination.
You have arrived to your destination.
You have arrived to your destination.
C'mon.
What?
This is it?
Damn it.
THE DAY BEFORE
You know we have a strict no cell phone use in class policy.
However your daughter doesn't want to abide by that  policy.
Her conduct is disruptive.
Therefore I recommend you take advantage of the suspension and have a serious talk withyour daughter.
I'm sorry, but...
This is a bit hard to believe.
I mean, it doesn't sound like Lucy at all.
I just can't think of what could make her behave like this. I'm so mad.
Sorry...
Your Hand?
Oh, thank you.
Do you mind if I ask what happened?
UH, we had a gas leak at the apartment last week.
And I was lighing one of those scented candles
AND BOOM!
You know?
The air just went up around me all in flames
But luckily. Lucy had just opened a window minutes before.
I mean, I am lucky I only burned my hand.
Well, and my hair, hence the silly scarf.
Sorry to hear that.
 That must have been quite a scare.
Do you think that may be why she's been acting out?
I don't think so.
I mean, she didn't get hurt or anything.
But you could have been seriously hurt.
A life threatening situation can change a person.
Lucy and I had an argument over that window.
With no apparent reason she decided to open it
And...I mean I was not happy about it. it was freezing
 outside and we were both sick.
I kept asking her to close it but she just ignored me
Who would have guessed that window would save both of our lives?
Ironic, huh?
Given the situation, here's what I can do
I won't go on record with official suspension,
I don't think Lucy deserves that kind of
 damage on her school record anyway.
However,
I want you to promise me
That you'll take the next week to work out this phone issue with her.
So it does not escalate to something more serious.
Sound fair?
Yes. I appreciate it.
And I promise she'll be back like new.
Lucy.
Lucy, are you home?
Lucy, didn't I tell you
 to get new curtains?
Lucy.
Lucy!
Mom, what are you doing here?
What does it look like?
 I'm looking for you.
Please, mom, not now.
I want to know who gave you a cellphone.
No one.
So how are you paying for it?
I'm not.
So who is?
No One.
Wow! a Free phone that makes free calls!
Amazing!
Did you steal it?
Of course not!
So what's the story? 
C'mon spill it.
My boyfriend gave it to me.
Since  when do you have a boyfriend?
- Since last week.
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
I wish you had a boyfriend.
Maybe then you could learn something about life on planet earth for a change.
The problem is you can't get a boyfriend
Even though you're wearing a shirt saying "I love dick"
For your information, Philip K. Dick is the world's greatest science fiction writer.
 God, you're so ignorant.
All I want to know is
 how you got ahold of a cell phone
I found it ok? 
I found it!
Why are you making calls from it if it's not yours?
It's complicated. Ok?
And I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it can't be more complicated than you're life's gonna be...
... if you don't tell me every single detail of that story
Where do you think you're going?
I do not talk on the phone in class if that's what the principal told you.
Well, he says you do.
Otherwise he wouldn't bother me with it.
Well, I don't
I mean...
How could I?
The phone doesn't even work.
Say it again?
The phone is broken.
It doesn't work.
It never did.
If it doesn't work, why do you have it?
I mean, that is even more puzzeling to me.
Do you just pretend to
 talk on the phone in class...
...to look cool or to piss off the teachers?
Is that the deal?
No.
So what do you do with it?
The principal was very clear about you...
...being seen using the phone in class.
Are you saying they made that up?
I just listen to it.
You listen to what?
The phone
You listen to the phone?
Yes.
Didn't you just say the phone is broken?
Yes, I did,
But sometimes,
I get it out of the bag
 and put it to my ear.
What for?
I hear things.
Oh, God.
What things?
Words.
Words? 
You mean it plays the radio?
No, it's not that.
It doesn't work at all. I told you.
So how do you hear words?
Actually, it's just a single word each day.
I don't get it.
I just...I  hear one word. That's it.
Every day I hear one.
Lucy, you're not making any sense.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
That's why I didn't tell you.
Okay!
You found a cellphone which is dead
Caput! No signal.
And you hear words coming from it.
Yes
And these words, what are they?
Clues.
Clues about what?
Promise you won't freak out?
Lucy, you're scaring me.
You have to promise.
Ok, I promise.
Each word is a clue about what can save me every day.
That's not funny.
You're joking, right?
Does it sound like I'm joking?
This is serious but I don't want you to get all freaked out about it either
C'mon, Lucy. How am I supposed to react to that?
Just listen to the rest of what I
 have to say and be cool, alright?
I'm listening.
Remembered the fire?
How can I forget?
That was when it started.
What do you mean?
I found the phone on the street that morning and I realized it wasn't working.
So I kept trying to figure out why it wasn't working
 because it looked new.
I turned it on and off and then
 I put it to my ear to check for sound
And then this word sounded over and over
What word?
Window
I kept hearing the word 'window'. and then I got  home and saw myself running toward the kitchen window and not really sure what to do
And I just opened it.
And then, you know what happened.
You mean you opened the window that saved our lives because that cellphone told you to?
I know.
I know what you're thinking. It's crazy.
I want you to stop this nonesense.
No! You need to hear this!
Yesterday, the word was 'ticket'.
So?
Did you see the news?
There was a gang shooting at the Grey Souls' concert.
Two kids got killed.
I was supposed to go but I didn't.
Do you know why?
No, why?
I lost my ticket.
Thank God you lost that ticket, but...
How am I supposed to believe that you're hearing these words, or clues, or whatever?
Mom,you know that I've never been into superstitious, Hocus pocus bullshit.
I've Always been very rational.
So please, I am begging you to believe me.
Just tell me one more thing.
What?
What's today's word?
Did it save your life already?
I know today's word.
But nothing's happened yet.
So what's the word?
Why should I tell you?
You don't believe me anyway.
How am I supposed to believe you if you don't tell me what the word is?
I have an idea.
I'm gonna write down the word.
This way, you won't know it until it happens.
This way you won't be obssessing about it.
Me?
Obsess?
I have a better idea.
What is it?
Can I see the  phone?
What for?
I just want to hold it for a second.
What is the idea?
I'll show you.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry to do this, but I have to put an end to this charade right now.
If you need guidance, you come to me, and listen to what I say.
Not some ridiculous broken phone
Lucy!
No!
God! Hold on!
Do not let go of me, please, don't let go!
Hold on to my hand!
I'm holding you as strong as I can
I've got you.
Don't let go, don't let go.
Hold on tight, hold on tight, ok?
Baby hold on tight. Just hold on.
I'm ok! Oh my god!
 I'm slipping, I'm slipping.
I'm gonna fall off!!
Look at me.
I'm not going to let you die!
Don't let go!
That phone was meant to kill you.
Not save you.
Think again.
Hand
Mom, are you sure about this?
I mean, I don't think leaving town all of a sudden is gonna make any difference.
I promised the principal that we would go away for a week.
Just the two of us and that's exactly the way it's going to be
Well, It's  always been the two of us, no matter where we go.
I need to figure out
what's going on with you and that phone and
I can't think at the house.
And if you're tired of it  being just the two of us, why don't  you bring your imaginary boyfriend along?
Maybe I can't get a boyfriend because you can't get a boyfriend. I have a theory that it's genetic.
Ha, ha!
Where are we going exactly?
I'm not sure.
As long as it's not Mexico.
For God's sake, Lucy, we are not running from the police.
Do you think that only criminals want to go to mexico?
Shhh...Please, I'm thinking.
Look, it's easy...
We can't go West because we're already as far west as we can possibly go
We can't go south because are not outlaws.
And we can't go North because we can't get a man in LA.
Chances are we'll die single in San Francisco, so...
I guess there's only one option left.
Which is?
Vegas.
Ha! You wish!
So, tell me something.
How often do you hear those words?
Every day. I told you.
And it's just one word each day?
Yes
So if each word lasts 24 hours, after midnight you should hear a new one.
Yeah, I guess so.
Can't wait.
Have you figured out where we're going yet?
No.Not yet.
I didn't know that you also liked to travel into the unknown.
What are you doing?
I am going to do my own travelling
What book is it?
"The Time Machine" by H. G. Wells.
Didn't they make a movie about it?
Several.
So why do you want to still read the book?
Uh, actually I'm reading it now for the third time.
Are you insane? why?
Because I'm doing a thesis
 on Time Travelling
My god, Lucy, if it's time
 travel you're into
Why don't you just watch the "Back to the Future"trilogy?
Instead of reading the same book three times?
Well, actually I only read the book once.
But because I managed to go back in time twice, to the exact moment before I read the book,
I don't remember
So technically although I read the book twice already,
I'm reading it now for the first time.
What?
Ok,You need to relax.
I'm just teasing you.
How many rooms?
Just one. With two beds, please.
Thirty dollars.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Finally I can get some sleep
No, you can't.
Do you think I can go to sleep without knowing what's the next word that's gonna save my daughter?
I told you I only get one word per day.
I know, it IS the next day.
It's passed midnight.
In case you haven't noticed.
Are you for real?
You bet I am. So you better grab that cell phone and start listening,
'cause I'm not going to sleep and neither are you.
Until we hear God's word.
Look, it doesn't happen like that.
I just can't force...
...the phone to give the word whenever I want.
It happens when it has to happen, not because I want it to.
Will you just try it for a bit?
Mom, I'm tired.
Just try it, for God's sake.
You know, I have been doing this alone and am not sure if it's going to work with you staring at me like that.
Do you want me to close my eyes?
I think I can hear something.
What? What do you hear?
I hear...
"Sleep"
Don't be  smart.
Just concentrate, will you?
I hear nothing.
Can we do this tomorrow, please?
All right, all right. have it your way.
Wait!
What is it?
I'm getting it.
Well, say i!
King
What?
It's "King" .
The word is King.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means what it means.
King is the clue.
King of what?
I do not know. But it's gonna save
 my life somehow. I guarantee it.
But what king?
Well, maybe it's King Kong.
He seems to be keen on girls.
This is not funny.
Look, can we go to bed now?
Nothing's gonna happen tonight anyway.
So we might as well just deal with it in the morning
Wait!
What?
You can't sleep in this bed.
Why not?
It's not safe.
What?
Just...just  get out of bed and come with me.
Are you kidding me?
Mom, are you insane?
Hello!
What are you doing?
Excuse me!
Hi, uh, we need a king size bed, please.
I don't think there's one available tonight.
Well, could you just check
Please, it's very important.
Well, there is one,
 but I don't think it's in good condition.
It'll be fine.
The toilet is clogged.
-We don't mind.
Thank you
Enjoy.
If "King" is going to save you, then you'll be sleeping on one.
Okay. Here it is.
We can't take any chances.
King Kong was here, and he left evidence.
If you need to pee, just use the bathtub.
Whatever!
Rise and shine, my Queen.
C'mon we gotta get you your King.
What time is it?
How do I look?
You remind me of my mother.
I'll take that as a compliment.
You know, some people think you still have a pretty hot mommy.
I heard what the kids of the neighborhood call you.
Milf.
Milf?
What the hell is that?
Mother I'd Like To f...
Fantasize...
Oh, my God, Lucy.
That's disgusting.
Mom, you're too uptight.
You know you're never gonna find a man that way.
And you really need one...badly.
You better work on that laughter, because you make the sound dogs make just before they throw up.
Where are we going to find breakfast?
Burger King. 
Where else?
Here.
It's all I could find.
There is no Burger King in a thirty mile radius.
I still think we should get one, though.
Just in case.
And how do you figure a
Whopper is gonna save me today?
Kings aren't to be questioned.
I bought this for you.
"The shining"by Stephen King?
Really?
Yeah! Hold on to it.
At least until midnight.
And I thought that I was going crazy.
You know that Stephen King writes mostly horror stories.
Which usually end badly for the main character
Most of his stories are pretty creepy like...
...this one for instance.
 It's a bloodbath from start to finish.
Hey, I remember from the movie
And I'm tense enough already.
Change the subject.
You know, you never gave me a book before.
Of course I have.
Nope, this is the first one.
I gave you a diary once.
It's not exactly a book.
It is once you write in it.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Just make sure you take
Stephen with you.
People might think that  I'm going to use it for something else.
Take it
Don't use all the pages.
Save some for me.
Hey shithead! 
Where's my $20 you owe me?
I said I'd get it.
You said the same yesterday.
And I want it now.
Yeah, well, I don't have it here.
I can get  it tomorrow.
You have until midnight...
...oryou'll never See your Fisher Price limited edition chess board again!
It's Bobby Fisher, you idiot.
Hey! Where do you think you're going with my daughter's bag?
Let go of me, crazy bitch.
You're not going anywhere
Get your hands off me.
Let go, you little bastard
Get your hands off me!
Give me the bag!
Give it to me!
Bitch! Let go of the bag!
Let go of it! Give it to me!
You want a piece of this?
Mother!
You are so dead, bitch!
No!
Get out of here!
Run to the car, Lucy.
Run, Lucy.
Throwing a book at guy who's holding a gun?
What were you thinking?
He was going to shoot you.
What I supposed to do?
Don't put yourself in danger because of me!
I can handle myself!
So much for Stephen King.
That phone was meant to kill you not save you.
What's that?
My savior.
I'll be damned.
This isn't my stuff.
What?
This is definately not my bag.
Where did you get this?
I thought it was yours. 
That guy had it.
Well, I  put my stuff under
 the bench. Did you check?
I didn't see anything.
 I thought that guy took it.
Well, obviously not.
Shoot!
We have to go back.
Are you crazy? 
We're not going back there.
I have all my stuff in there.
Forget it. I'll buy you new books!
My thesis notes!
That's  months of work.
I'll tell you what.
If you can go back in time and get it, be my guest
We're not going back! 
I'm sorry honey
What am I supposed to do with all this stuff?
Do not touch anything.
Just...we don't want our fingerprints on it.
Throw it out the window.
Go!
Alright, here's the deal.
Tonight we sleep on my rules.
I get my own bed and I'm not telling you the word before the morning.
Ok, well, just one more thing.
What?
The day is not over yet.
So you better hold on to your savior.
Ok?
Here take the wheel for a second?
There.
Keep it on.
I'm doomed.
You just hung the King
Do you think if I listened to the phone,
I would hear words?
I don't know.
Why don't you try it?
What does the voice sound like?
What voice?
The voice you hear.
Is it a man's voice or a woman's?
Who says I hear voices?
Well, how do you hear the word?
It just sort of pops in my head.
I don't  know.
Ok, that's freaky.
Damn it.
What's wrong?
My head hurts.
What? 
Is it serious?
Yes, it hurts
Well, we'll go to the drugstore and get you some Advil.
Stupid Cellphone.
It's probably the radiation.
It's cooking your brain cells and turning you into a mutant.
Mom...
Something is just happening.
What is it?
There's a new word.
What?
I just heard a new word.
Well, how can that be?
I mean, I'm the one holding the cell phone.
You're not even holding it.
I know. 
I don't know.
Isn't it just a word per day?
Listen, I don't make the rules.
I'm just as confused and surprised as you are!
But the fact is I just got a new word buzzing in my head.
For Christ's sake, Lucy.
When is this ever going to end?
I mean, you're joking, right?
Tell me you're joking
No, I'm not.
So what the hell is the new word?
Air
Air?
Yeah
Like the wind?
Yeah.
Well, here.
Have plenty of it!
How's your headache now?
What are you doing?
Leave the window open.
I'm getting cold.
Can we close the others, too?
I don't think that's wise.
You know, I think it's probably better if I never tell you any more words again.
Why?
Because you are probably gonna make me sleep in an air bed tonight.
You know, you started by saying...
...that all this was happening because I was obssessed about it.
But you've been acting a lot worse.
Didn't you learn anything from the "King"?
If the "air" is going to save me, it might as well be in a way that we least expect.
So do not try to help because you're making it a lot worse.
You know, just stop the car.
I'll put the windows up.
Stop the car.
You don't have to get so upset!
Stop the car!
What for?
Just stop it or I'm gonna
 throw up in your lap.
Lucy!
Come on, Lucy.
Lucy,
Come back here!
You have arrived to your destination.
You have arrived to your destination.
Damn it.
Oh, my God.
Lucy!!
THE DAY BEFORE
Claire.
Claire.
Well, hello, Claire.
Did you find the place alright?
Yeah!
What's going on, sis?
 I haven't heard from you
 in over two and a half years
And all of a sudden you leave me this message to drive a million miles out to this god forsaken place.
Is this a mental health test?
Well. Matt, it may surprise you
But I need your help with one of my patients.
One of your patients needs my help?
I'm very serious.
I think you may hope that he's the safest patient.
Well, you're the shrink, not me.
Will you just listen to what I have to say?
I'm listening.
I have been taking care of a special patient.
His name is Daniel Doyle. Age 17.
He's an intern in a mental health center for a year now
You still work at tha nut house?
Yep.
Just got promoted last week at
Vice President of the board.
Wow!
Congrats V.P.! it just lasted a day though...
What happened?
Differences of opinions you know?
This kid Daniel, for instance, they wanted to release him again.
Well, in my opinion...
What is your opnion?
I believe... he's going to seriously hurt himself as soon as he gets out.
What do you mean by seriously hurt himself?
Suicide.
Right...
How do I fit in the picture?
Daniel's girlfriend died and he's not been able to deal with it.
I think he's going to need to connect with someone he believes can really understand his pain
Someone he can look in the eye and respect.
And you think that's me?
Yeah, I do.
Will you talk to him. please?
Well, Claire, my girlfriend didn't die.
I know.
But you almost did.
He's such a good kid.
He reminds me of you.
Really?
Well can you tell me why you made me come all the way outhere?
We will get into that later..
Now, just listen to me carefully.
Ok, go on!
About a year ago, during Spring Break
This kid Daniel and his girlfriend
Jennifer were camping at Lake Mirage.
She went for a swim while Daniel was taking pictures with a digital camera.
They were both having fun, when Jennifer had a seizure and started drowning
She went down really fast.
 Daniel, howeve, was quick to react
He jumped into the water, dived down, grabbed her carried her to shore and performed CPR
But unfortunately she didn't survive.
Now here's Daniel's thought on it.
According to his statement, he claimed he couldn't cope with losing her, so he decided to end his life as well.
A week after her funeral he jumped into the lake and... guess what?
Well, he didn't die.
I can figure that much.
Exactly. But the actual ordinary thing is that he claims that he actually drowned... and woke up again on the lake just as he was trying to save his girlfriend.
I think you kind of lost me there.
What I mean is, he jumped into the lake, drowned and woke up trying to save Jennifer.
Isn't jennifer dead at this point?
She is. 
But not if you travel back in time.
So, so...
Let me get this straight.
While he's drowning, he travels back in time and wakes up at the exact moment of the lake incident.
Exactly.
As she's drowning.
Ok! 
What happens next?
And then he tries to save her but never succeeds.
So we try to go back again.
And again.
Until he hopes one day he WILL succeed.
So he's like in a time loop?
Yes.
But there is another interesting detail.
Really? 
What's that?
Climb on top of the first cargo airplane, and call me when you get there.
Ok....
Go to the back of the airplane.
Look for a small hatch behind the right wing
Can you see it?
Yeah, I see it.
Open it up and tell me what you find.
It's a digital camera.
With a key on it.
You see that camera?
- Yep
Daniel claims he can only go back in time if he takes his camera with him.
That same camera.
How does that work?
He takes his own picture with that camera just before he dies.
And that's what makes time travel possible.
The kid has a pretty wild imagination.
Tell me about it.
How he end up at your care at the center?
He was caught trying to drown himself.
Someone saw it and stopped him.
The incident was reported to his parents and he was brought to the center.
Consequently the board agreed he should be interned.
The same boaed that now thinks he's fine?
Bingo.
Well, there's still one thing that
I still don't understand, Claire
-What is it?
Did you have me come all the way out here just to pick up the kid's camera?
Or is there something else going on?
Because you're starting to freak me out.
Are you going to tell me what's REALLY going on here?
I'm in trouble, Matt.
You don't say!
Let me guess.
Your opinion was THAT strong.
I guess. 
It runs in the family.
Well, spill it, Claire.
What exactly did you do?
Before Daniel was released from the center,
I took him out there.
Please don't tell me you kidnapped the kid.
I care about him, Matt.
I had to do something.
Well, where is he?
See that cargo airplane behind ?
Yeah.
He is in there.
The kid is in the aircraft?
Where the hell are YOU?
I was hiding with him there.
But the cops got him there, now I'm home arrested.
Are you out of your mind?
What was I supposed to do?
The moment he wants, he'll go to the first body of water and die.
Do you know what you've done?
Not only are you going to lose your license, but they're gonna put you away forever. it doesn't matter, as long as it saves his life.
Please, Matt. 
He has no one else.
Claire...I uh...
I can't be involved in this.
I got enough problems of my own.
I just want you to talk to him, that's all.
I'm sorry, Claire.
But I can't.
Not too long ago, you were in this kid's shoes.
Did you forget that already?
I nearly lost my brother.
Right under my nose.
Because I was too busy dealing with my own problems.
The sign were all around me.
But I just decided to ignore them.
And I do regret that very much.
So if there's anything I can do to help someone else who's going through that same kind of emotional pain that makes you wish you could end it all,
... I will.
How long have you kept the
 camera from the kid?
Since day One.
When it was brought into the center.
Well, allright.
If the kid thinks this camera is a time machine,
I think I  want to know how it works.
You in here, Daniel?
Daniel?
Is that you, Daniel?
Daniel?
Who are you?
I'm matt.
Claire's brother.
Welcome aboard to Flight Nowhere, Matt.
Never really enjoyed flying myself.
I like to keep my feet to the ground. if you know what I mean.
Don't tell me.
You're a shrink, too.
No...No...Definately not.
I'm not a doctor of any kind.
Still, Claire believes that I can help you
God knows why.
I helped a dog once.
But I'm not a vet either.
As a matter of fact, 
I'm unempleyed at the moment.
Basically, I'm just a sucker.
A lot  like you, no offense.
You do  know she's just trying to help you, right?
It's not working.
Yeah, I can see that. heck....I don't blame you at ever being so mad at the world...
It's a tough thing to lose your
 girlfriend like that
I know how that can mess with your head.
Really?
Did your girlfriend die, too?
No.
I hope not.
What do you mean?
She disappeared.
Well, like kidnapped, or something?
She just left.
And I thought 
I was the biggest sucker.
Yeah, you're pronanly right about that.
I do not blame her, though.
I was just a stupid kid.
So, what happened?
Well, I was 16.
And a rich kid
Born and raised in a wealthy family in Chicago.
My parents had big plans for me.
I was a bit of... a prodigy in college so I was about to...
Go into med School
So far, so good, right?
And then fate decided to change things up on me.
Guess what?
 Fell in love.
The only problem with that was that...uh..
She was 20 years old
 and a cabby.
I should have been smarter than to try... to force my parents, to accept the fact that I wanted to marry this...
Twenty year-old, immigrant, taxi driver.
With diamond-shaped tattoo on her face.
Boy, oh boy did they, uh...
Go on a crusade against us.
It was pure lunacy.
And even then
I still tought we could win.
So, we decided that we'd pretendit was over...
... Until I was  legal.
For two years
That was hard.
But we had a secret signal.
Whenever we crossed each other's paths we would touch our noses.
It's an ancient...um...signal
Arctic tribes used
Whenever the men were gonna go a long hunt across the icy desert,
The wives would touch their noses like this.
It means in death
My heart will follow you to the ends of the earth.
We thought that was an appropriate signal.
Because the environment surrounding us was...
... Cold as an Arctic winter night.
Sad thing is we didn't survive it.
You see, my parents are hard to fool. 
They, uh...
Found out she didn't have a green Card and had her blackmailed for deportation.
Hey, crazy teenage drama, right?
So, what happened to her?
Never saw her again.
What did you do?
Tried to go... back in time.
Like you.
How?
Needless to say I didn't succeed.
Looks like you're stuck.
Life is so much like a dark comedy.
When all this happened, all I wanted to do was end my life, and...
Here I am carrying an epi pen on my wallet everywhere I go.
An epipen?
Auto injector of Epinephrine.
I'm allergic to bees, and without epipen, one sting could mean the end of me
Pretty pathetic, huh?
So tell me, what changed in your life since then?
What made you trade your razor blades in for an epipen?
Hope.
Like you, I hope that I can find a way to travel back in time and be with my girl again.
I just don't think killing myself is the answer.
Unless of course you and your camera can prove me wrong.
What kind of proof do you need?
You could bring me some photos.
You know what they say,
"A picture is worth a thousand words".
If you give me my camera back, and help me get out of here,
I'll get you the pictures that you need.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks for staying overnight.
How could I turn down free lodging at such a thematic campsite?
What are you thinking?
I think those handcuffs are gonna look pretty bad on your resume.
I'm sorry but desperate situations call for desperate measures.
We can't let him go before we're sure he's gonna be alright.
He's never gonna be alright if we don't let him go, Claire.
You know, mom and dad miss you so much.
You should try to forgive them.
Maybe.
It's a damn shame you had to fall for that wrong girl.
She wasn't the wrong girl.
Sorry, you know I didn't mean it.
God, it's been like ten years.
Did you ever get any news from her?
No.
I can't believe you're still in love.
You are, aren't you?
I think it's a little late for a therapy session.
You know what? 
In part, I really envy you.
I think we both need to get some sleep.
I'll try my best!
Good night
-Night
Are you heading west, by any chance?
Jump in  Young Dude.
All right. Thanks.
Please  tell me you didn't  let him go?
Look, you said you wanted Daniel to talk to someone he could look in the eye and respect.
Someone he knew could understand what he was going through, right?
Yeah, I guess said that.
Well,the only way for
Daniel to really believe that I understand what he's going through... was to set him free.
He's not much ready yet.
And we know that Daniel tried to kill  himself before.
And... When you think of doing something that terrible to yourself...
You feel so lonely it's unbearable.
I know, because I did.
I felt so miserable and lonely... that I didn't think anyone could endure that kind of pain and still go on living.
Daniel may still be out ther, and he is still be thinking about killing himself.
But he knows there is someone else out there... who endured his pain and stll walks mlong he living.
He knows he's not alone.
And he knows that person's right here perfectly happy to give him a helping hand.
I  hope you're right, Matt.
I really hope you're right.
If it makes you feel any better,
I think I know exactly where he's headed.
Where?
Well,he tried to drown himself at Lake Mirage to wake up and save his girlfriend at Lake Mirage.
So I think that is where he's headed and that is about 3 hours from here.
He's going to die, Matt,
I know it.
No. 
Don't worry.
Let me handle this.
Ok?
I'll find him and 
I'll make sure he's alright.
So, my sister, she's 65.
She comes home one day... and she hears this strange sound, coming from the bedroom
So she goes in... and she finds her 40 year old daughter, that's my niece
... Playing with a vibrator.
You know what a vibrator is, right?
Yeah, I know.
Internet.
Ah, got you.
So she says:
'What are you doing?'
And her daughter says:
Mom, I'm 40 years old.
... Look at me. 
I 'm ugly...
I'm never gonna get married.
This is as close to a husband as I'm gonna get.
Eww, sad.
Yeah. Sad.
Next day...
My brother-in-law comes home...
And hears thame same buzzing sound coming out of his daughter's room...
He goes in and there she is..
...using the vibrator.
Yeah. He says:
What the hell is going on here?
And she she says
Dad, I just told Mom...
I'm 40 years old, I'm ugly and I'm never gonna get married.
This is pretty much my husband.
So he... you know, walks out of the room kind of sad like...
Next day, my sister comes home...
And  she finds him on the couch  beer in one hand...
 vibrator in the other hand...
And Watching football on Television.
She says:
What in Heaven's name is going on?
He says: What does it l ook like is going on?
I'm drinking a beer watching the football  game with my son-in-law.
Son-in-law!
So, where did you say you're from?
I didn't, actually.
Where ARE you from?
I was born in Iceland, raised in California,
I think such a sudden, extreme change in climate must have screwed my brain cells somehow. because  I ended up in a nuthouse.
Really?
Wow! 
When was that?
Very, very recently.
Don't worry,
 I'm harmless.
You look fine to me.
You know...
I have had my time with psychiatrists, too.
How's that?
I got this...uh...seizure that
 used to knock me out all the time...
Every time I tried to... you know?...
Come together with my woman. -laughs-
I couldn't perform because
I'd pass out before I ever got started.
How 'bout that, huh?
So...
The doctors thought it's probably mental and they sent me off to a mental institution.
That's where they... you know, tried all kinds of freaky tests on me.
Finally, it comes out I'm
 just allergic to latex.
You know, can't wear rubber...
You mean condoms?
All rubber.
And especially condoms.
The initial, uh, diagnosis
I guess was right.
I have a problem with my head.
-laughter-
That's kind of freaky.
Nah. Not so bad, though.
At least I won...
... The best parking in town.
Sweet!
You know...
You must have had a lot of things happen to you in that nuthouse.
Uh...Like every good drama, has it's comedy moments. I guess.
Well, let's hear them.
Well this one time, we had a visit from a wealthy benefactor of the mental institution.
She was really a classy and really conservative. lady.
And uh, on their tour of one of the floors she passed a room where this patient was masturbating.
She was in complete awe, like
- If it is discovered.
How is it justified?
And The doctor explained like, I'm really sorry, ma'am, but... he has a serious condition where
if he doesn't do it several times a day he's afraid, that his testicles are going to swell up and explode.
And he'll die.
You know that can actually happen.
So the lady. was like
 Oh, that's terrible...
And they continued on with the tour.
And In the very next room, she sees nurse Chavez, the hottest nuese you can imagine.
Going down another male patient.
And the lady was so shocked
Like: How is this justified?
What is going on in this hospital?
I don't understand.
And the doctor was so embarrassed he didn't know what to do. so he...
So he puts on a straight face
Turn to her looking in the eye and tells her:
Same condition, better health plan.
-laughs-
Better health plan!!!
-laughs-
Different health plan!!!!!
There you go, son.
Alright! Thanks a lot!
Good luck.
Three dollars.
Thanks.
Hey Mister!
Will you blow this up for me, please
Where are your parents?
My mommy is inside buying candy.
Please.
Yeah, sure. 
Stretch it out.
-shrieks-
Mommy!!!
Mommy!!!
Sir!
Sir!!
Can you hear me?
Mommy!!!!
Get an ambulance.
Got it!
Latex commision
It's your lucky day, partner.
C'mon!

Justin Time.
Justin Time, huh?
You're a funny guy.
You had an allergic reaction.
An ambulance is on its way.
You're gonna be OK, alright?
Thank you.
Be careful, buddy.
Justin Time
I'm Daniel.
Nice to meet you, Daniel. 
I 'm Helena,
So where are you heading?
Uh...straight ahead.
Yeah...
I would assume that...
Otherwise you could catch a ride on the other side.
I'm trying to reach... uh...Lake Mirage.
Lake Mirage.
Um...
Yeah, I think I can drop you near the lake.
Oh, great.
So, what are you doing at Lake Mirage?
Um...I'm going to see my girlfriend.
Oh, you sound like you're really looking forward to it.
I am. Very much.
Hey, good for you.
What about you? 
Where are you headed?
Oh, I'm heading right back here.
These 50 miles stretched road is my official work address.
You mean you just go back and forth all day?
Oh, yeah.
You'd be surprised how many dead vehicles I can get in a single day.
If cars were insects, this road would like a spider-web.
That'd make you like Spider Woman.
Not a Spider Woman like a Black Widow spider who kills and eats the male after mating.
I mean like Spiderwoman like the superhero, Spider, Spiderman.
Who saves people and is loved very much for doing so?
So...
What does your girlfriend look like?
Is she hot?
Why do you wanna know?
You into girls?
You assume I'm a dyke just because drive a tow truck?
No, that's not what I meant.
I was just asking.You know.
That's a rude way to answer.
You're funny.
So, do you have someone?
You mean a boyfriend?
Yeah.
I used to.
But you know, with a job like mine...
I just don't have much time for dating.
You know?
I think I'll get free time while I'm still single.
Maybe you should get a vibrator.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Alright.
This is it, Daniel.
Lake Mirage is right ahead.
I gotta head back to work now. on covering my road of choice.
It was great to meet you Helena.
Hey and best of luck to you
 and your girlfriend.
Thanks.
And don't worry about the boyfriend.
If you do not find him
I'm sure he'll find you.
Thanks for the ride.
You're welcome.
Oh, my God.
Lucy!
Mom, there's...
WHAT?
I just heard a new word.
What the hell's the new word?
"Air".
I bet the car would run just fine,
If you had a tow truck and you're pulled out.
I'm not gonna let you lose that bet.
I brought a gift for you.
Proof of time travel?
I never said I'd bring you proof.
I said I'd bring  the pictures  you need.
Well, thanks.
Just don't forget to call the tow truck.
Will do.
And thank you...
For everything.
You take care of yourself. Okay?
Helena
Tow Truck Service.
I need to tow truck over at  Lake Mirage.
That's funny.
I was there early today.
I'll be right there. 
Don't go anywhere.
I won't.
Justin Time
We had a secret signal.
It means that ...
My heartwill follow you to the ends of the earth.

That's my hero.
"J" - Rock.
Yeah, that... that's us.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
You better not get used to this.
Who? Me?
Penthouse.
Alright. Come on.
How the second most talented guy I know?
I don't know, how are you?
I'm good.
Happy Birthday!
Oh... You must be Elaine?
- Yeah,
- Welcome.
This is amazing.
Automatic even at its finest.
My own personal place in the clouds.
The view is incredible.
Let me ask you a question.
You keeping my boy in line?
Don't answer that... hey!
It's a full time job.
Whatever he is paying you, I'll double it.
Oh, well, looks like, you got your hands full already.
I like that.
Yeah.
That's your room right here.
You guys wanna hit the pool?
Absolutely.
Babe!
Pool Time!
Baby, get me a cosmo.
Absolutely, hold this.
Hey, the bar's this way.
- You really did it, man.
- Yeah.
I mean just like everybody knew you would, but...
Hey, guys.
Hello...
I wouldn't have done without you.
What I do?
Decorate the walls?
You do look nice.
And you do look nice.
Happy Birthday, Terry.
Yeah, happy birthday to me.
And I do not know what to give you as a gift.
I got some ideas on that.
Come on.
I see everyone getting along famously.
- Baby?
- Yeah?
Where is my cosmo?
Owh, my bad.
Denise, get me a drink.
- Anyone else?
- No.
Well, this definitely beats Brooklyn in December.
I don't know, I kinda like our four Seasons.
We got one of those, down the block.
Tomorrow we're gonna hit the high sea,
I'm gonna take you all out on my Sunseeker.
It's a 67 footer.
My ****...
That's Homeland Security.
They must be here because they know tonights party is gonna be a "bomb".
Cheers.
Happy Birthday, Terry!
Oh hi, dude.
How's it going man?
I'm alright.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Ray!
Hold on.
Well, birthday boy, happy Birthday, man.
- Thank you.
How's the "robot fight" coming along?
Dude, it's sucks, but the director loves it, so... you know.
- Hey, is this the boy wonder?
- Yeah.
- And his lovely lady, yeah-ha-ha.
- Hey.
- Hey, good to meet you, man.
- Yeah.
Listen, I'm psyched you're gonna join the crew.
Huh?... I mean, I...
Hey, hey, did you find a place to live yet?
I'm telling you, Venice, it's where it's at.
I live there, so...
We have a place, thank you.
Sure you have.
- I have to go to the little girl's room.
- Alright.
- Excuse me.
- No...
Babe... Elaine!
She's smokin', nice job dude.
Wait up for me. Let's go.
What's he talking about?
What's going on, ladies?
- Sorry.
- What was that all about?
Hey, look.
The cat's obviously outta the bag...
I was thinking... you should move to L.A.
What am I gonna do out here?
I mean... I rather survive back home.
I could use you.
Oh, I don't need any charity, alright?
Okay fine.
I need you.
I don't know anything about effects, man.
That's bullshit, come on.
That's not bullshit.
You got the eye and you know it.
Alright... Computer is just a tool.
I... I don't know, okay?
I never saw myself out here.
Where do you see yourself?
You got five year plan I don't know about?
It's not about the money, okay?
It's always about the money.
What about Elaine?
I can't handle everything.
You gotta take care of that yourself.
Terry, there's a call for you upstairs.
You think about it.
Elaine.
Come on.
We are supposed to be having fun, what is the problem?
Just forget it, alright?
Look...
Terry sprung this whole California thing on me today, alright?
- I had no idea, I didn't...
- I'm late.
What you mean, late?
Late...
Oh, excuse me...
Sorry.
Since when?
I don't know.
I've been feeling sick all week, so I took a test and...
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to... Believe me, I just...
I didn't wanna ruin your trip.
Shit.
Is that all you have to say?
What do you want me to say?
I don't think I'm ready for this.
You're not ready, Jarrod?
What about me?
It's not... hey, will you keep...
Is that what we have to look forward too.
Leni...
Hey man, we got... we got... we got a lot... lot more.
Oh, my God.
Go... go... go... go... go...
Oh, my God, man!
Pardon me ma'am, but... we received a few noise complaints.
From whom?
The building's half empty.
I understand that, but... the other half is trying to sleep.
- So, if you don't mind if you just...
- Alright.
Another one for the books.
- Well... well... well
- I got the couch.
Oh, come on, I think there's space for both of us?
I like space.
Whoa, alright.
Beggers can't be chooser.
Good night.
Earthquake!
You're probably just dreaming.
Put out the lights.
Ray...
What're you doing?
Ray!
Stay here.
- What's wrong?
- He's gone.
Jarrod, no.
- No, Jarrod, no.
- Jarrod... no.
What's going on, man?
Jarrod, please stop.
What's with you, man?
Jarrod?
Oh, my God, Jarrod.
Jarrod!
Please..
He tooked something?
- Jarrod..
- Oh God.
Jarrod...
What's wrong with him?
Jarrod? Oh my God.
Where's Ray? Where's Ray?
No, no, no, no...
- Jarrod.
- Where is he?
He's gone!
What do you mean he's gone?
I mean, he's gone!
Did he fall?
- No.
- Did he jump?
No! I don't...
He went outside... to the light.
And then he... he just disappeared. xxx
Terry...
Terry, please!
What did you see?
What did you see?
Talk to me.
Jarrod, what happened?
I don't know.
I was being pulled... towards this light.
- Open the blinds.
- No...
- Open the blinds!
- No!
Goddamn it...
There's something down there.
What?
Jarrod, check this out.
I don't see anything.
There are people on roof.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
We should check it out.
You don't know what's out there.
- I'll be okay.
- Alright.
I'm calling the police.
I'll try to take some pictures.
You can't go out there.
I'm not going out there alone.
It just keeps ringing.
A gun?
Really?
Just check the news and find out what the hell's going on.
- Terry..
- We'll be right back.
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.
Let's go.
Hurry back.
The stairs are this way.
What's going on?
I'm going to check it out.
What're you doing with the gun?
Get back in your apartment.
Go!
And keep it down.
Hey... you sure about this?
Yeah.
There's been nothing new since 4 am.
Denise, check the TV.
It's calm.
Damn it, Jarrod.
You didn't tell me to hold it open.
I thought it was common sense.
I'm sorry.
Get down.
What now?
Let's get a better look.
Hi, this is Jackie.
Please leave a message.
Mom, it's me.
Something happened and... pick up.
Please, just... call me back as soon as you get this.
Holy shit.
I can't see it.
Is that what I think it is?
My God.
- Let's go.
- What is it?
Run!
Let's go.
Go!
Come on, pull!
Back up!
Back up!
Come on!
Come on!
Elaine, no!
Move... move!
Honey, are you okay?
I feel like I'm on fire.
Look at me...
Yeah, look at you.
How?
Oh, my God!
All those people.
What they want with them?
I'm not gonna go find out.
God, can't believe this...
I mean how?...
Once you look at the light...
It grabs hold.
It's like that...
It can trust you.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna look at something so beautiful?
It's kinda brilliant, actually.
Enough of this shit.
I got an idea.
Where you going?
- Walt's. - Terry?
- What for?
Don't worry about it.
- Terry?
- Everything's under control.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's nothing.
Let me see.
I said its nothin'.
Alright.
Alright?
Walt?
Yo... Walt?
Walt?
Walt?
Are you in here?
What the hell you doing?
Hiding.
I saw the people in the sky... like the Goddamn ***
Come on, we're taking your car, we're getting the hell outta here.
Lets go!
I'm not going out there!
Get down!
- Shhh..
- Shut the dog up, shut the dog up!
Shhh!...
- Oh, God no...
- No... no...
Walt!
Aarrgghh!
Did you hear that?
Talk to me.
We need to get my boat and gettin' outta here.
What happened?
They took Walt.
They took Walt?
What're you talking about?
This one was different.
They came in the building and they just snatched him.
Then we just go.
Hold on a sec.
Am I the only one who saw these photos?
It's all happening right outside, right now.
They're everywhere...
But they're not everywhere.
They're... they're not over the water.
He's right.
Yeah, well, it didn't take 'em very long to find who you live with.
We can drive there in 2 minutes.
You have no idea whether they keep them alive.
Ellie, I know you are scared, okay?
We're all scared...
But I'm not burying my head in the sand, hoping it goes away.
I'm not saying that.
Look, just take it easy, man.
It's not easy with all this...
I know it's not.
They're in the fucking building.
Terry?
It's the timer.
My God.
Go... go... move... move!
You're disgusting!
What the hell's the matter with you?
We'll talk about that later.
Yeah, we will talk about that.
You still wanna stay?
I don't want... any of this.
They didn't see us so we stay here and stay quiet.
For how long?
They're taking people out there, plane and simple.
The further we get outta the city, the better off we are.
He's right.
Jarrod.
If we get to the boat we have a chance!
- Yeah, but if we don't...
- We have...
We have to try.
We just, uh... get food and water.
Let's do this.
Alright, come on.
Look, the sooner I get there, the sooner the boat's ready to go.
Be careful.
- Come on, let's go.
- What..
What you doing?
Driving, I know the way!
You just take your slut.
Candice...
Candice.
Get in the car!
Terry, I'm sorry.
Hurry up.
What do you think I'm doing?
- Hey, slow down.
- No.
Just stop!
You need any help?
No, go, we're fine.
Yeah but, maybe...
Enough, alright?
I said, we're fine.
Terry, get up!
Run!
Come on.
Hey, Terry...
Terry!
Jarrod!
Get your ass back here now!
Back up!
Come on.
- Open! Oh shit.
- Come on.
Open!
Come on.
Open, you piece of shit!
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Oh, my God.
Help me!
Someone help!
We gotta get outta here.
Give me the keys.
You alright?
He's fine.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
- Miss, we have to go...
- No.
He's alive!
Colin!
Help me!
Come on, let's go!
Go! Go!
Make it to the back door.
Run!
Go!
Don't stop!
Open the door!
Hurry!
- Get it open.
- Back up.
Open it.
Where we going?
All the way to the top is the safest place I can think of.
What if they're up there?
If you wanna stay out here with them, be my guest.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, quickly... quickly... quickly!
Hey!...
Come help me with this.
It's better than nothing, right?
Yeah, if you say so.
What're you doing, huh?
Like it or not, this is happening.
You gotta be strong.
Is everybody okay?
Are you hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
- What now?
- We stay here...
We keep watch and we pray that someone comes.
He's right.
Someone's gonna come.
This can't go on forever.
Right?
Sweety, it's best if we stay together.
I can't... the smoke.
Given such circumstances, I think a smoke is more than reasonable.
Candice...
I'm pregnant, alright?
And I just thought that... that with all this stress...
It's okay.
Jarrod, I got to tell my mom.
Come on, boss.
Let's let the girls get some sleep.
You and I will keep watch now.
Both of us?
They try that light stuff, we got each others back.
I hate L.A.
I haven't seen a soul all night.
Maybe the worst is over.
Maybe not.
What do you think these things really are?
I don't know.
Does it even matter?
It just doesn't seem real.
Well, it is real.
You better wake up.
What's that supposed to mean?
The city is a vacant lot.
We need to survive.
There's not gonna be many of us left.
What do you see?
Somebody is fighting back.
What're you doing?
I wanna see what's out there.
Turn that off, its too bright.
- No!
- We can't risk it.
Did you sleep at all?
Is it getting worse?
- What?
- The marks on your skin.
When I looked into that light, I couldn't stand for 10 minutes.
Who knows what it did to us... to our bodies.
You remember the first moment when you saw it?
When it completely took over?
Somehow you... you still felt... powerful.
I still do.
Why don't you take a seat... relax.
Alright, I'll bite. What's your plan boss,
'cause I know you're dying to tell me.
Nothing to say?
We're sitting on a marina for Chirst sakes...
I've noticed that.
There are hundreds of boats right across the street.
We've been through all this.
Remind us how that was done last time?
We... we go quietly this time.
And search every boat 'till we find a key?
If we have to...
Great plan, Jarrod.
I can't believe you even suggest that, after what happened.
Are you saying it was my fault?
I was practically begging, but you wouldn't listen.
And you think that Terry wouldn't listen me?
Alright...
Let's say we make it outta the building.
Across the marina down the dock.
We even find a boat and everything, then what?
- We get the hell outta Dodge.
- Where to?
Carolina, down the coast?
Anywhere is better than here!
How do you know?
We're here.
We're alive.
What was that?
What do you see?
Hallelujah.
Come on... come on... come on!
Everybody get down!

Leni?
It worked.
- I don't believe it.
- Is it over?
- Do you mind?
- By all means, boss.
Do you think there're more planes where they came from?
Yes, now they know what to do.
They'll be sending help in no time.
What?
What is it?
They're not dead.
They're just really... really pissed off.
Something is happening.
We have to cover these windows.
Come help me with this.
Get back over here!
I'll find something.
Here.
Jarrod, what are you doing?
They'll be coming here.
What's this really about, huh?
Those things are coming for us.
You think I haven't noticed that mess under your shirt?
We stay here and hold up... for good.
I agree.
Well, I guess that said everything, we have no water.
- No power..
- Yeah, but you saw what's out there.
Yeah, but I would rather make a run for it, then stay in a 20 story target.
Between those things and the radiaton, we are dead up here.
Go... go... go... go, let's make a stand.
Let go off me!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You want to wait here.
We'll let everything go!
I'm saying we call for help.
The help is here.
Does that look like a rescue chopper to you?
Don't you get it?
We're at war.
Where are they going?
Those choppers are coming back for them.
We have to go.
Come on.
We get to the roof.
They'll pick us up.
What if they don't come back?
Look what they did to those planes.
What good is a helicopter?
- We have to take a chance.
- A chance?
They just nuked the city, and you wanna wave hello?
I just need you to back off.
We have to try...
Oh shit.
You just gonna stand there?
What happens when the rest of the blocks fall?
We really don't have enough bed sheets.
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?
Let's just go!
You're in no condition to decide anything.
Who knows what side you're on.
I'm warning you.
Stop it!
Both of you!
Look at his face.
He's sick.
Don't make me hurt you.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not leaving without my family.
There is nothing, that you can do to stop us.
Elaine, you have to trust me.
It's me.
It's still... me.
I know.
We have to go.
He's gonna get us killed.
Come on.
Come on.
Alright, lets go.
You see anything?
They're right there.
- Help.
- Help us!
Don't move!
- Don't shoot.
- No, no, wait
Stay where you are!
We need help, please.
We gotta get over there.
No... no... no!
No!...
Come on!
Roger that, I see two people in shelter, go get them...
- Hey... hey... hey!...
- Hey!
No!...
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Jarrod...
Go... go... go!
The scaffold... it's the only way down.
Come on, go!
Leni, run!
Fuck!
Vaya con Dios you son of a bitch!
Help me! Help.
Help me...
Jarrod. Look, look at me.
Look at me, Jarrod.
Get up.
Come on.
Now it's able see us.
Leni, please.
You have to go.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Jarrod!
My baby!

It's always the same dream
I'm wandering Naked
In this strange Maze of hallways
And I feel this creeping sense
Of impending doom
Like something terrible's
About to happen
I pass my roommate
My Mom
My best friend Stella
Basically every significant person in my life
And they're all just staring at me
Like I'm some kind of museum display
Behind glass
Then I see two people
I've never met before
A mysterious unearthly
Beautiful woman
And this red-haired girl
And they both seem to be
Leading me deeper into the corridor
This is when I noticed
A black door
And I'm not sure why
But somehow I know that I've gotta
Find out what's behind it
So I grabbed hold of the knob
Opened the door and discovered
A dumpster
I've had the same bizarre
Fucking dream
Every night since I moved into
The dorms last week
So now I'm wide awake
And, being 18 and perpetually horny
Anytime I have 5 idle minutes
My right hand automatically
Takes over
Like it's got a will of its own
Sorry
I'm just trying to be quiet
It's too hot to sleep anyway
How's the party?
Rad
I'm wasted
Nice
You should've come with us, dude
Everyone got crumped
Took their clothes off
Swam
The water was so warm
Mind if I sit?
Can I ask you something?
Sure
- You're like gay, right?
Uhhh, I'm more Undeclared
What's it like exactly?
I imagine it's different from
Being with a girl
It's way different
It's more...
Raw
Physical
I mean, cause you're intimately familiar
With plumbing,
There's less mystery and guesswork
Like,
You know exactly what to do...
And how it feels
Do you like, Kiss and stuff?
Of course
I've never...
Y'know,
Kissed another guy before
Well, it's pretty fucking awesome
My roommate...
Plough me
Plough me with your monstrous tool!
So, yeah
I have an excruciatingly
Hot, straight roommate
Wassup I'm Thor
Like the comic Yup!
And his name really is Thor
As in the superhero
God of Thunder
With the giant hammer
I sleep naked
I hope that doesn't weird you out
It's a perpetual torture
Plus of course he's a surfer,
Dumb as a box of rocks
AKA, exactly my type
I'm like really into Gran Turismo 5
And before that I was into SOCOM
And oh yeah!
Killzone!
I get with guys sometimes
Sexually I mean
And also, I like to surf
Do you surf, dude?
The guy sounds like a fucking asstard
My partner-in-crime
Stella
Stella and I first met way back in 9th Grade
I refuse to do this assignment
Cause you're
A sexist loser who has no fucking clue
What you're talking about
Are you sure it's not straight love Or in love with another oblivious boy fixation?
It's just that I'm not sure
How straight Thor really is
You said he was putting a load
In some pinhead stryer last night
Yeah, but doing it with women
Doesn't necessarily make him straight
Case in point
The fact that you randomly sometimes
Stick it in a girl does not mean anything
Beyond you
Need to monitor your drinking
Here we go
Now he's your typical straight guy, right?
When it comes to sloppiness, and manners
And scratching his balls
In public
Or like eating half a piece of pizza
On someone's coffee table
However, he also does
Stuff like that...
He wears deodorant every single day
And he exfoliates every night
Religiously, with one of those vibrating
Derma-brasion things
Plus, he's a little too
Into his own body
Like beyond a normal
Straight guy who works out
Admiring his self kinda way
Are we done?
No
I saved the weirdest thing for last
He wears flip flops like
Almost everyday, right?
Very hetero, very dude, choice
Except for the fact
He has a whole collection of them
Which he keeps in a color coordinated row
In his closet
Wow, except from putting a dick in your mouth
With Lady Gaga playing in the background
That's about as gay as it gets
See?
I told you
Smith, I'm kidding
It's all cute and fun
When you're 15
But we're legal adults now
In college
Anyway
I gotta get to class
Me too Where are you headed?
Imagination Theory
I'm beginning to wonder if being an Art major in a college of Creative Studies
Is a little too hippy dippy
Even for me
Hey, dudes!
The Messiah
Our pothead RA who is baked 24/7
What's goin' on?
We were just on our way to class
That's cool
I'd a really freaky dream last night
We'd love to hear all about it
But...
Both of you Were in it
And the whole world...
Blew up
In a horrible nuclear catastrophe
Great, thanks Messiah Goodbye
Majoring in Film Studies
Is something I wanted to do all my life
Eventhough it is a little anachronistic
Considering there is real doubt
As to whether cinema
As we know will even exist
Anymore in the next few years
It's kinda like devoting your life
To studying an animal
That's on the verge of extinction
Smith, college is just an intermission between high school and the rest of your life
It's 4 years of having sex
Making stupid mistakes
And experiencing stuffs
It's a pitstop
Not the second coming of the Messiah
Speaking of, it was sorta bizarre
What the Messiah was saying this morning
No kidding
What's that guy's deal?
He's gotta be like 30 at least
Yeah I've been having
Weird dreams lately too
What do you think it means?
It's a well-known fact that dreams are just
Your brain taking a dump at the end of the day
It don't mean anything
Hey dude
Let me guess
Thor Wassup?
Thor, this is my best friend Stella
Stella, Thor
Mind if I join?
Whatcha major in, Stella?
Art
Oh really?
Cool
Yeah Cool
Are you gay, or whatever too?
Or just like...
Normal?
Hey, Messiah
Smith!
Got something for you
What is it?
Someone slipped it
Under my door this morning
You Are The Chosen Son
What does it say?
"The Chosen Son?"
What the crap's that supposed to mean?
I have no idea
Oh, hey dude
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Trying to suck your own dick?
Bingo
I've been reading on the Internet
That if you do these
Flexibility exercises twice a day
You'll be able to give yourself
A blowjob in 3 weeks
I'll email you the link
That's ok
- You sure?
It's a useful skill to have, y'know?
In case you hit a dry spell...
You ever taste your own cum?
Not a whole load, mind you?
But y'know if you
Shoot really hard and some gets
In your mouth by accident
Mine's not bad actually
Kinda vanilla-ish
- Really, can we change the subject?
Oh, bro!
What's it with you and your friend?
Who, Stella?
Yeah, the uptight dyke
Yeah I know she can be a little aloof
When you first meet her, but she's actually
Super hot
In a bitter, edgy les kinda way
You think I have any shot
At hitting that?
I just threw up a little
In my mouth
I know
Hello I'm obsessed with you
And you're into my vagitarian best friend?
It's like I told you
That guy's a toad
I've met plants
With better personalities
And what do you make of him
Trying to blow himself... this afternoon
He likes having a sword swallowed
Not exactly a revelation
So anyways The party tonight
You're going
Lorelei, this hot girl from my
Emotion Painting class invited me
Lorelei?
As in legendary siren luring
Helpless sailors to their doom?
Yeah I know
She's gorgeous and I need a wingman
So you're drafted
So that you can hook up
And ditch me after 5 seconds?
Basically
Nice hat by the way
Are we in Paris?
Well, it's about time asshole
- I know
It's been awhile
I'm sorry, I've just been super busy
Don't worry bout it, hon
I work my ass off
Keeping a roof over your head
For the past 18 years
How's college life?
Oh, shit, sweetie
That's Australia on the other line
Can I ring you back in 15?
I'm going to a party with Stella I'll just call you later this weekend or something
Sure you will
There she is
Lorelei!
That's her?
I know Effing hot, right?
Smith, Lorelei...
Lorelei... this is Smith
Have we met before?
No
I'm sorry, I...
Anyway...
Shall we hit the bar?
Definitely
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah I'll be fine
Just a minute
Can you hold on?
Can you hurry it up in there
I'm gonna piss like a banshee
Hello, are you giving birth
To a marine in there or what?
Finally!
What happened to your shoe?
A drunk girl barfed on it
Nice hat
Yeah Same to you
London
Huh?
- I'm London
You don't expect me to shake that hand
Before you wash it
Sorry gay dude
Excuse me?
Well you are, right?
What?
Gay
I don't really believe in
Standardized sexual pejoratives
So you're bi?
- Not exactly
You do it with guys and girls, right?
Depending on which way your Peter points?
It's...
A little more...
Complicated
Life doesn't have to be so complicated
Neither does sex
Are you okay?
What was the question again?
Do you wanna fuck?
What?
- Do You Want To Fuck?
I just so happen to find queer guys hot
So my thing
Dude, keep it simple
You, me, intercourse
Yes, no?
What?!
I'll drive
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Maybe We should wait
Till we get back to your place
Why?
It's kinda dangerous
I mean I'm trying drive here
I live with danger
Me too
I'm gonna cum
Do it, do it
Just let me do it more
Did you cum too?
No, it's kinda hard for me
In that position
But it was really cool watching you
Wait You didn't cum?
Whatever, I'm good
What kinda guy are you?
If I didn't just have your dick inside of me I swear you didn't have one
I got this kinda weird thing
Where I'm really into making
Whoever I'm with, cum
Now that Really turns me on
I happen to take pride
In being scandalously great in bed
So if you think you're going
Home without cumming
Forget it
Ahh, feels so good!
Oh God...!
Wait
Don't cum yet
I want to show you something
What?
Just lay back, and relax
- Alright
Are you ready?
You're not even touching me But it's like I can feel your mouth on my...
Cool, huh?
How do you do that?
I have special talents
What do you mean?
That was so hot
I almost came again
Just watching you
Don't get any ideas OrgasMomatic
I gotta get some sleep
What are you doing?
No offence dude...
I'm really not into the whole...
Sleepover breakfast thing
Here, gimme your number
So...
See you?
Help! They're coming!
They're coming to get me!
Please! We gotta get outta here!
Come on!
Wow Talking bout a bad trip
What kinda drugs were you on anyway?
That's just it I'm not sure
It was so vivid And real
I must have blacked out or something cause
When I woke up
I don't know how much later
The animal-masked men, the red-haired girl
They were nowhere to be found
Smith, you were hallucinating
I can't believe I let you drag me out of
A very sexy dyke's bed for this
That's the other thing, How do you explain me seeing Lorelei in a dream
Before I even met her
Could be because there's more Lorelei
Than meets the eye
What do you mean?
She's a witch
A... what?
She's a witch
Y'know...
Supernatural powers, casts spells
I know Pretty cool, huh?
Dude, we've been searching
All morning and found
No footprints, no blood, zilch
- I know
And now you wanna spend the rest of the day
Poring over the entire student population
In the campus directory?
You got something better to do?
Sucking a fart
Out of a dead seagull's ass?
Stella! Stella!
- I'm awake
100% awake
Come here
Are you sure that's her?
So what do we do now?
Start calling every O'Hara
In the phonebook I guess?
And...
Say what?
"Hi. I was tripping balls last night
And you were in my dream"
What are you doing here?
- I came to rescue you
Oh my God, Awesome
Smith...
Go ahead Bail
Hi, I was lookin' for a Madeleine
O'Hara... Is there...
Okay, sorry to bother you
Thank you
What are you doing?
Who is this?
The girl you fucked last night
Hi, sorry...
- I repeat, what are you doing?
I was kinda in the middle of something
Right now
I'm stressed about this exam

I was thinking
I could really use a good orgasm
Thanks
I needed that
What?
Nothing
I just, I just think you...

Now where are you going?
I told you
I have a massive test Monday

We both cum and you leave?
Pretty much Is there a problem?
Eventhough we just met
I feel...
This weirdly intense connection with you
I know Me too
Sure you can't stay
A little bit longer?
Is that you...
Or Smith junior talking?
Both
As much as I love to help
The two of you out
I gots to study
What's this?
Last night after I left your place
I was walking out
By the lagoon and
What?
I know her
What?
I know her Know her
She was in my Sociology class
She was always strung out
Totally fucked up
Last week she passed out in the middle of a lecture
And what happened?
Paramedics came and took her away
Well, last night
I had this insanely intense
Vision of her getting murdered
By 3 guys in animal masks
Did you say animal masks?
Why?
Oh, sorry
You guys boning?
I was just leaving
I'll call you
Hi
Errr... can you move your
Fat ass out of my way?

Wow
I think that broke my all-time record
You tired already?
We've been going at it
For 5 hours
I mean I love sex
As much as anyone else
But if I cum anymore tonight
My crude is just gonna break
But I wanna make love again
You're kidding, right?
What are you?
Some kind of insatiable sex maniac?
Too bad, I'm beat
Buzzkill
What was that?
What What are you talking about?
I felt that Lorelei
I know what you're doing, it's not...
Hello
- Smith, what are you doing?
Walking home from the library
Why?
What's wrong?
You gotta rescue me
It turns out Lorelei is a little bit crazy
Like a shithouse rat
I told you
There was something scary about her
Look I'm gonna make up
An excuse about you
Having some kinda crisis
That I'll meet you back at your place
Stella, what?
What's going on?
She walked on
Stella...
Stella are you in there?
I'm just peeing
What's taking so long?
I miss you
Be out in a sec

- Wait, Stel
Shit
Shit!
Help!
Somebody help!
Smith?
What's wrong?
The door
It was stuck
Are you alright, man?
Yeah...

Who's there?
The Queen of fucking England
Who do you think?
Get in!
- What the...?
- Just come here quick
What?
- Look!
Yeah that's a beautiful parking lot Smith
They were just down there
Who?
What are you talking about?
The animal masks men
You mean the ones you hallucinated?
I'm not hallucinating now
I think that something really
Fucking freaky is going on
Oh, sorry Were you two...
Gross!
No
You must be Smith's new girlfriend
Huh?
- She's kidding
Madeleine O'Hara, the red-haired girl...
London says she was in her Sociology class
And then went missing about a week ago
Well that's why I came by
She may have turned up
What do you mean?
Is Oceanography, that building past
Madigan Hall
Way out on the west side of campus
Right by the lagoon?
I don't know What's going on?
It could just be a coincidence
But I was studying tonight
In the library
And there on the floor
I saw this...
Unidentified Headless Female Torso Found
In Oceanography Department Dumpster
Days passed
I searched the news religiously but There was no word on the body in the dumpster
I started to wonder
If maybe I really was losing my mind
To clear my head
I went to this nude beach
A few miles from campus
I've never been to
One before in my life
So one morning before class
I checked it out
I gotta say
It was a little nerve-wracking
But kinda liberating
Lying there with the sun, and the breeze
The smell of the ocean
All my worries
All the weird shit going on
Everything melted away
But then...
How's it goin'?
Mind if I join you?
Hunter
Smith
You come here often?
This is my first time
I didn't think I'd seen ya around
You in school?
Yeah. You?
- Fuck, no
I build and design hot tubs
Oh really?
Wait...
Do you like Do this a lot?
What do you mean?
This...
Oh, hey dude!
What's going on?
- Teaching this fag a lesson
Yeah, who's teaching who yeah fag?
Smith, this is my best bud Rex
Rex, Smith
Wassup, man
Well
I was just gonna grab a shower
Alright hey man, if you want it you should try
Some of that awesome new conditioner I just got
It's the one on my sofa
With the French name
Listen to yourself
You sound like a huge fucking fag!
Ok fag, that's it!
I'm kicking your giant homo ass!
Who's the fag now huh?
You, faggot fag steak!
What's that?
- Fag burger with a side of fag fries
Yeah...
I'm just gonna...
You meet some guy on the nude beach
And 5 minutes later, you're downloading his hard drive in the back of a van?
You're a slut
Really?
So did you dump Lorelei yet?
I'm trying to pull away
But she's not exactly making it easy
You're not inviting me in?
I'm kinda tired
And I have a super early class tomorrow
Is something wrong?
No, I'm just tired
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodnight?
Uhmmm...
Sure
Well, ummm...
Goodnight
I love you
Yeah...
Me too
I know I have to end it
But my experience with psychopaths
Like her
You have to ease away very gradually
The sooner the better
Before she pulls something really nutty
I told you nothing's wrong
I just gotta finish this project
You're not avoiding me Are you?
Of course not
If you're lying
That would make me very upset
I'm not lying babe
Look, I need to get back to work
I'll call you tomorrow, alright?
What time tomorrow?
After class
I'll be counting the minutes
Okay
- I love you
Me too
Goodnight
Hi, Smith
I hope you don't think
This is too creepy stalker of me
But I'm too much of a social retard to
Walk up and say Hi like a normal person
In case you're wondering
I got your e-mail from the
Explosions in the Sky's Facebook page
So at least
We have this much in common
Anyways I was wondering
If you maybe wanna get together
Have coffee or something
If not, then uh...
Have a great life I guess
Okay, I'm gonna stop now before
I chicken out and toss this in the trash
Yeah, I'm Oliver By the way
So I've been meaning to ask
The other day when I mentioned
The animal masks guys
You seemed kinda weirded out
It seems appropriate
It's a weird story
Is it your Mom?
How did...
Your face
My Mom's okay
She did the best she could
Raising me on her own...
Working full-time
What about your Dad?
He died in a car accident
When I was a baby
I'm sorry
I never knew him so it's kinda like
I don't even have a father
I don't see my Dad either
He was an alcoholic
Abandoned us when I was little
I guess we have more in common
Than we thought
What are you looking at now?
It's just my roommate's friend
Smith's got a crush!
I do not have a crush
You're hooked for him like you're Hooked for that shaved egg roommate of yours
When I walked in
They were both rolling around
On the floor
Wrestling in their underwear
Straight guys are gayer than gay guys
The fact that they're in love but can't
Suck each other's dick
Makes them queerer than Clay Aiken
What...
What are you doing?
I inviting him over
Chillax Just having some fun
Here he comes
Hey
Rex, this is my friend London
London, Rex
You look lonesome
Want some company?
Sure Thanks
We were just talking about sex
She's kidding
So Rex,
Have you ever heard of the Kinsey scale?
It's a rating system
For sexual orientation
0, being totally hetero
And 6, 100% gay
Smith here is probably a 3 or 4
While I'm like a 1.5
Why don't we talk about something else?
Kinsey discovered that only 5 to
10% of the population are at 6 or 0
What do you think your number is?
Zero I guess...?
Boring
You wanna fuck anyway?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Dude don't worry
I'll give you the 4-1-1 after
Okay
Excuse me?
Let's have sex
Just with you, though Right?
Yeah, that's it!
Oh don't stop
You're doing great!
Are you joking?
Sorry - I've had pelvic exams last longer than that
It's just...
You felt so good
What are you, 14?
Wow!
I'll be hard again in a few
And it lasts way longer
The second time around, I swear
Oh joy!
In the meantime
I'll eat your pussy or something
This just keeps getting
Better and better doesn't it?
C'mon Let me make it up to you
Yeah that's it, baby
I just want to make you feel good
What the hell's going on down there?
What do you think you're doing?
- Eating you out
Dude, it's a vagina not a bowl of spaghetti
I don't know
What your fucking problem is
But I've gone down on lots of girls
And never had any complaints
Maybe they're faking it to
Spare your fragile male ego?
Look, you want a few
Constructive pointers?
I don't need pointers
Trust, you so do
And you know what a clit is, right?
Yeah I know what a clit is
Think of it as a little girl dick
And treat it accordingly
Imagine what your dick likes
Kiss it, tease it with your tongue
Suck it, even nibble it a little
Just make sure you true-to-God
Treat it with the utmost care and respect
Which brings us to the number one
Golden rule of oral
Pay attention to how she's reacting
If she seems into something
Keep doing that same thing
Over and over and over
It's about finding the rhythm she likes
And sticking to it until the job is done
Got it
You want a practical?
So ready
Well, get busy son
Hey
- So we hooking up or what?
Excuse me?
I thought maybe you might wanna have sex so that You can do Rex via the transfer property
If A fucks B, and B fucks C
It's like A fucks C by default
As appealing as you make that sound
I'll pass
You're not curious?
About...
What Rex is like in bed
Oh hey
- Hey
I just came by to pick up some stuff
Is everything alright?
Yeah Totally
Well late
See ya
What was that about?
- I don't know, got me
What is it?
I set a Google Alert For any news of the dead girl in the dumpster
Did they finally identify her?
- Maybe
What?
It's gone
- What's gone?
The torso
Someone stole it
From the coroner's office
Today's the day
My 19th birthday
My morning starts out
Like any other
But very quickly
Weirdness takes over
And now what begins?
- The hell if I know
It's just freaking me out
Because the minute I woke up
I was overwhelmed by this vague sense
That some sort of
Major shift has occurred
Well I finally did break up with Lorelei this morning
Yeah How did that go?
Yikes Then what happened?
This isn't over Stella
You have no fucking idea
What you're getting yourself into
So are you worried?
Does Mel Gibson hate Jews?
Anyway, let's change the subject
Any word yet from what's-his-name?
Oswald?
- Oliver
No, I spent literally hours honing my reply of a masterpiece
That's definitely interested but
Not too desperate for this
How long's it been?
Three days
I know
So, don't forget
We're seeing Helen Stellar
Tonight over in Ocean City
That's right!
Fuck me!
Smith!
What happened?

Like you think the unmistakable sound of gay porn Doesn't penetrate these walls?
Alright, biatch
You made your point

At the beach was a bust?
His cell went just when
He was going down on me

I better get back to my friends They're probably wondering what happened to me
Alright

So should I call him?
What?
Should I give Oliver a call, just to say
"Hi, it was nice running into you"
Good idea, let him know you're a need-ball freak Right off the bat
Really?
Smith, the universe is finally smiling on you And everything is going your way
Don't fuck it up
- Yeah right, okay

I haveta pee like a pregnant woman
Hello?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to
Are you alright?
Yeah
I was just dozed off
Do you remember me?
I think we've met before
At a party
I've never seen you before
In my life
You barfed on my shoe
And later that night
I saw three men
In animal masks...
I don't know what you're talking about
Are you sure?
Look I told you...
I don't know anything
Please I gotta go
Madeleine?
Madeleine O'Hara
What do you know
About the animal-masked men?
You gotta tell me
I had a twin sister
Named Rebecca
And when we were little...
Men in animal masks
Came and took her away
Dude, you already googled Rebecca O'Hara
On your BlackBerry
And got a million hits of nothing
Deal with it tomorrow
You're right. Let's just try to enjoy
Whatever's left of my birthday
So how does it feel to be 19?
Now what is it?
Nothing I'm just tired
So, any more crazy messages
From Lorelei?
Well, seems to have died down a little
So that's promising
Who knows
Maybe I was over-reacting
I mean I know how hell hath no fury and all
But could be, she's
Not as bonkers as we thought
Stella What's wrong?
I don't know, do you think
Maybe I'm being too much of a wimp?
Dude, you have a Fatal Attraction stalker
With supernatural powers
You've got every right to be creeped out
Yeah, okay Sold
I'm gonna give you the bed, lady
You want an Ambien?
- No
Thank you. After the day we've had Don't think
I'm gonna have any trouble falling asleep
Me neither, but I wanna be so knocked out I don't want how many more gnarly nightmares
So where's Board Knight?
He disappears sometimes
For a few days
I assume he's off somewhere
Burying his bone in some...
Smith c'mon That's not funny
Smith, I'm not kidding
Cut it out
Smith, what the fuck
You're freaking me out, stop it
It's not Smith
Smith, stop fucking around
Stella, I told you
It's not Smith
I warned you Stella
I warned you not to do this
Fuck you, Lorelei
This isn't real
This isn't really happening
- Oh it's happening alright
Believe me...
It's happening
I'm dreaming I must be dreaming
Wake up!
Wake up, c'mon...!
Wake up...!
Till Death Do Us Part
Lorelei!
I know you're out there!
Stop hiding and show your fucking face
You fucking coward!
Fuck you, you crazy bitch!
You hear me? Fuck you...
Fuck you!
Holy fucking shit!
Why are you...
I was up all night
I didn't sleep at all
Smith, what's going on?
I woke up
In the middle of the night...
And I found this IM
Telling me to go to this address
You ever heard of the New Order?
The seminal New Wave band from the 80s?
No Here, I'll show you
It's like this secret underground cult
What?
The address
It's not in my browser history
Are you sure you weren't just
Having some kinda sugar-induced nightmare?
Stella, I'm not making this up
It's gone, all of it
The site, the IMs
Stel, I'm not crazy
I was on this site
It had a list
Of all these ostracized members
Number 1 on the list was...
Her name was Rebecca Novak
Rebecca, as in the name of
The red-haired girl's twin
So why does she have a different
Last name?
I don't know
Maybe she was adopted or something
Anyway...
That Rebecca girl she had this whole litany of transgressions
Blasphemy, sedition, treason
And her penance
Was death
And there's something else
Even weirder
On the website, they had a photo
Of the cult's leader
Like their L. Ron Hubbard
The whole thing
The Supreme One
And he looked like...
My Dad
What the fuck are you talking about
Your Dad is dead
I found this in the trash
When I was little
I always kept it a secret
The guy on the website
That's him
I know it
Oh Milo...
It hurts so good
Tight session
You were really in the zone today
I had a lot of tension to work out
- I could tell
So is there anything else
I can do for you?
Well for starters
You can get out of those fucking clothes
Now what?
Oh I've got a few ideas
And they're absolutely Filthy
Oh oh Hold that
Hello?
- Mom?
Smith, I'm in the middle of a meeting
Can I call you right back?
It's kinda important
It's about Dad
What about him?
I just got a couple of questions
- Alright
He died when I was a baby, right?
Yeah, in a car accident
You know all this already, what's going on?
Mom, I just have to know
Is there anything you're not telling me?
No, there is not
This chapter of our life has been closed
For a long time
What was Dad's last name?
Did he go by any other aliases?
Smith, look
I'm hanging up now okay?
Stop asking questions about your father
For your own good
Mom, wait...
London?
My Dad's alive?
He got his PhD in psychology
His research focused on an obscure
Community of hippies
Devoted to this book...
An Ideal for Living
Your father spent years studying the techniques
That leaders use to control the group
In the early 90s, he took the cult head for himself
How do you know all this?
My father wasn't an alcoholic
He was in the cult too
Ever since I can remember
My Dad would disappear
Then one night
When I was around 10
We never saw him again
And what does all this
Have to do with me?
You're the first-born male child
Of the Supreme One
The Chosen Son
What about you?
Did you know who I was
All this time?
So that night we met
At the party
I was following you
But only because I was hoping
You might be able to lead me to my father
But our friendship,
Everything that's happened since then
None of that was planned
You believe me, don't you?
I'm not sure what I believe in anymore
Messiah!
The end...
The end is near
Hello?
So you're saying, her body just
Vanished into thin air
It was the freakiest fucking thing
One minute I'm checking her for a pulse...
She seems dead Cold as stone
So I run out to grab my cell to call 9-1-1
And by the time I got back
I swear it was like 10 seconds later
She's gone
I know it sounds nuttier
Than squirrel shit
Well, strange seems to be
The new normal lately
What about Messiah?
Did the doctors say
He was just tripping or what?
His pupils were like
Big black suns
They're running a bunch of tests
Smith?
Mom What is it, what's wrong?
I need you to drop whatever you're doing
And come home immediately
What...
What are you talking about?
I can't say anything more
They're probably listening to us
Right now
Who's listening?
Mom, are you in some kinda danger?
Maybe you should call the police
No, no police, they can't be trusted
They're part of it
Look, no more questions okay?
Just get in your car
And come home
Smith, I'm not kidding
Do it Now!
Smith, don't worry I'm sure your Mom
Will explain everything when we get there
I just can't stop thinking about
What the Messiah said
You mean all that
"End is Near" shit?
Stella, I have the exact same feeling
And it keeps getting progressively
More and more intense
Like...
What if this really
Is the beginning...
Of the end?
Hello
Smith, where are you?
Dude, me and Stella are driving
To L.A. for the night
Actually it's a family emergency
Is everything okay?
Hope so What's going on?
Well, I just called the hospital
The Messiah's gone
How could someone who's barely even conscious Just up and disappear?
Nobody knows what happened to him
That's not the only thing
What?
The results of his toxicology
Report came back
They discovered traces of dioxin in his bloodstream
Dioxin?
You mean,
Like that Russian spy dude?
Yeah The Messiah was poisoned
Are you sure
You're gonna be alright?
It's just I don't know how my Mom's gonna
React and it might be touchy feely family...
Don't worry about me
Just call or text whenever
The coast is clear
Thanks Stel
For everything
Smith, everything's gonna be fine
Mom?
Hello?
Smith, you alright?
Come on, let's get outta here!
Smith, hurry up!
What are you doing?
What is it?
London?
Smith, I was just about to call you
There's something really weird going on
What do you mean?
All the highest-ranking members of The
New Order seem to be heading out of town
It's a mass migration
We're heading back now
Listen
I have something major to tell you
I think my Mom's been kidnapped
What?
- She's missing and we found her Blackberry
And there's all this information on it
What kind of information?
A bunch of incriminating documents about
My Dad and the New Order
It's so much huger
Than just some sick little cult
It's like this whole secret society and
Infiltrating the media, government
Even the police are involved
But look, that's not all
My Dad had dozens of wives
Like he basically slept with
Anyone in the cult he wanted
As a result, he has all these
Illegitimate children
And he's your biological father
And you're my half-sister
London
London, are you still there?
I'm here Smith
Look, you just need to get back here
Soon...
London?
London, what's going on?
What's happening?
London...
London Open up!
Fuck!
This always works on my room
First The Messiah, then my Mom, now London
What's fucking next!
What are you gonna do?
We gotta get outta here, just pack some stuffs In a bag, I'll meet you in your room in like 5 minutes
- What?
- Stel, just do it!
Five minutes, hurry
And watch your back!
Mom, what happened
Who did this to you?
What are you waiting for?
We don't have all night
Blow me, fag
Who made you queen for the day?
Dudes, seriously
This is no time for dicking around
Smith?
Smith?
Messiah?
Jesus, you gave me a freakin' heart attack
Stella, there's no time to explain
Where is Smith?
I think he's been kidnapped
Fuck!
- Messiah, what the shit is going on?
Come with me
I'll explain on the way
On the way where?
What are you talking about?
Stella, we may already be too late
Just come on
Welcome back, dude
What is this?
Finally!
The Chosen Son awakes
Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is happening?
It's Day Zero
What the hell is Day Zero?
It's New Order codespeak
For the day the world ends
Dude I'm sure you heard it before But you gotta cut way back on your weed intake
As a matter of fact...
I've never touched that stuff
The stoner thing was just a front
I'm actually part of a covert group
Operation called The Resistance
And it's our mission, to wipe out
The New Order once and for all
Oliver?
So lemme get this straight
You guys are both ex-members
Of the New Order who are
Now like spies trying to destroy it?
In grossly simplified terms Yes
My girlfriend Rebecca
Is also in the movement
Rebecca Novak?
The red-haired girl
She's your girlfriend?
She was
Before she was murdered
The cult performs secret initiations
Involving underage girls
Who are either abducted or donated
By their fucked up parents
Rebecca was working undercover
Videotaping the rituals for the FBI
Smith saw that video
It was on the USB drive he said got stolen
We suspect Thor and Rex are responsible for that - Thor?
And Rex?
So all 3 of you have been
Spying on me this whole time?
Dude, you're the Chosen Son
We have to monitor and report
Your every move
Hers too
Where are you taking us now?
Go ahead, tell him
Tell me what?
We're taking you
To meet your father
Where are they Oliver?
Do you see them?
Yeah, I got them
They're heading east on I-10
You're some kinda witch too?
Like Lorelei?
The New Order tests all its members'
Offspring for the "gift"
A certain type of brain activity indicating a predisposition
For paranormal ability
Subjects displaying a high level
Of this marker
Are inducted into a program with
Intensive psychotropic treatment
To cultivate those skills
And that's what happened to you?
And Lorelei?
Some come out of the program
Severely damaged
With a laundry list
Of personality disorders
Others don't make it at all
Smith's gift is exceptionally strong
Smith has psychic powers too?
They're just dormant
Like seeds that haven't germinated
Now that he's turned 19
It looks like the Prophecy
Is coming true
What's the Prophecy?
It's based on a recurring dream
Of your father's
The Chosen Son will return to the fold
In its 19th year
And the world as we know it
Will be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust
You're shitting me
The New Order has warheads Strategically planted in every major city in the world
World War 3 can be started
With the push of a button
But won't they obliterate
Themselves in the process?
The cult has a massive underground lair
Called the Secret Sanctum
Specially designed to survive
A nuclear disaster
So after the great Apocalypse
The New Order will be all that's left
When the Prophecy transpires
You'll inherit the Kingdom
You're gonna be like
The Prince of the new fucking world
Well if that's true
Why am I tied up
Why do London and my Mom
Have their mouths taped?
Sorry, man
We're just following orders
Though I guess now that we're out
In the middle of nowhere
It's probably okay to let them get some air
What do you guys think?
Why not? But if either of them mouth off I reserve the right
To plug their face - whole
With my cock
Don't worry
I'll do it nice, and slow
So it won't hurt
Thanks, arse hat
No problemo
Grab her, fucking douche!
- I'm trying!
Look, is that them?
That van belongs to a Level 4
Night Assignment Smith
So, yes
Well then
What the Jesus are you waiting for?
Floor it!
Who's the girl now?
What the fuck's wrong
With you pussies?
Jesus!
She's a fucking girl!
Dude, come on!
Get her!
What the...
Pull over!
Kiss my fucking starfish Homo!
What are you doing?
Hang on!
Are you fucking kidding?!
You couldn't pick a smoother road?
What the hell?
Look out!

Again.
What happened in that motel room?
Uh, it was coupon night and I was trampolining your wife.
You're a real comedian, aren't you, Snow?
Well, I guess that's why they call it the punch line.
You don't like me, do you?
Don't flatter yourself.
I don't like anybody.
With that attitude
I can see why nobody likes you.
Oh, come on.
People love me.
Just ask your wife.
What happened in that room in New York?
What? What was the question?
What happened in that room?
Mace?
Why do you never answer your phone?
What the hell's going on?
Listen. You have to get out, okay?
It's a double cross.
They're coming for you.
You have to get out now!
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Who was the mystery man on the phone?
His name was Fuck You.
Really?
Yeah, he was Asian.
I don't like hurting you, Snow.
Is that why you're having him do it?
I can have Rupert bludgeon you all night.
I'm being beaten up by a guy called Rupert?
What happened with the Colonel?
Shit.
Hey, buddy.
No, no, no, Frank.
You're gonna be fine.
Don't let them take this.
Yeah, okay.
Stay with me.
Come on, you're gonna be okay.
Frank.
Returning fire.
God, I hate heights.
Whoa!
Watch out!
Mace!
Where are you?
Get to the subway,
Wilson platform 10.
And dump the phone!
They're using it to track you!
We have him now!
Don't move!
And that's when you showed up.
We had the Colonel under surveillance.
He was selling secrets about our space programs.
Well, that's interesting because Frank told me he was protecting them.
Did he tell you this before or after you killed him?
Why would I kill him?
He was a friend of mine.
You're right.
That's not what happened.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Running out of jokes, are we?
You setting me up?
Is that what this is?
All we know is that the Colonel arranged for a meeting in that motel and somehow, you showed up and killed him. Pop.
You know, this may come as a surprise to you, but Frank didn't trust you guys any more, so he asked me to back him up.
He wanted someone from outside the agency.
You know, to protect the package.
Who was your backup guy?
Why do I get the feeling not telling you is the only thing keeping him alive?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, guys.
Play nice.
You mind?
No. He's all yours.
Get those off of him, please.
I can't tell if he's stupid or a really good liar.
Either way, M.S. One would have been good for him.
Guy's a tool. Nut?
Nah, I'm trying to give them up.
I was sorry to hear about Frank.
He was one of the good guys.
Snow, you gotta give me something.
Otherwise, I can't help you.
Tell me what I can do to help, Snow.
Shoot Langral?
Anything else?
Can you pick me up something?
I can. What and where?
I don't know.
Last time I saw it, it was on a train.
Hey, buddy. Hey!
Tell me who the backup guy was.
You think
I'm gonna tell you that?
You'll go straight to your boss.
Well, I guess this conversation's over.
It's good to see you.
I need a PolCom Tag and a trace on a name. Mace.
Mr. President.
Scott, come in.
This is just routine.
Won't take two seconds.
Thank you.
They check this damn thing five times a year.
So, what have we got?
He claims he was set up.
Was he?
I saw him shoot Armstrong with my own eyes, sir.
What a mess!
So what do you want us to do about him?
I don't even want to know. Just fix it.
We're pretty much done here.
I just need to see the First Daughter.
Oh, Emilie has had a change in schedule.
She's on a humanitarian errand.
Is she even in Washington?
Well, not exactly.
Ground control to LM22, do you copy?
- Loud and clear.
- It's amazing.
Is this your first time in orbit?
No.
My father took me up in the Hilton Orbital after my mother passed.
Would you like a quick briefing before we arrive?
Please. M.S. One has been a very successful experiment with the first 500 test cases serving time without incident.
Once we open for business properly, we'll be able to rent space to 500,000 prisoners and counting, with all countries signed up.
All overseen by the
United States of America.
Which is why I'm here.
M.S. One is the only
Supermax facility in existence where there is no physical or sexual abuse, breakouts or riots.
Because you put the prisoners to sleep?
It's called stasis.
Of course, but there are a few issues with stasis, are there not?
Aggression due to damage of the cortex, dementia, psychosis.
Well, you know the press.
Good news doesn't sell.
Those were early teething problems.
The U.S. has absolutely nothing to worry about.
You are entering United States airspace.
We're approaching. Would you like to see it?
I'd love to..
This is penal area M.S. One.
446 requesting identification code.
LM22, we need your coordinates...
The defense system is automatic and solar assisted, oxygen-fed, auto lock,
100-millimeter pacifiers made by Milland AeroSpace.
LM22, please transmit clearance.
What are they doing?
Parts of M.S. One are still under construction and need constant maintenance.
LM22, you are on final approach.
Maintain your current speed and heading.
- Can everyone please sign in?
- How are you, sir?
There are just a few basic precautions here.
Won't take long.
Thanks, Sam.
Can I get my holster?
There you go, sir.
Please, keep your radiation tags on you at all times.
In the event of a problem, they will beep and flash yellow.
Would you please take the elevator to the third floor?
Mr. Barnes, isn't
M.S. One's true purpose to test the effects of deep space exploration on humans?
Who better than guinea pigs with no rights?
I've heard that urban legend.
Look, Ms. Warnock, these men aren't traffic offenders.
They've done some pretty awful things to get in here.
Of course.
But is it purely coincidental that one of the main sources of funding is a deep space exploration company?
Surely you don't think they're paying out millions of dollars to be civically minded?
Ms. Warnock, I'm just an old prison warden.
I couldn't speculate on the motives of global corporations.
Anyway, isn't Milland AeroSpace the largest contributor to your charity group?
But one thing doesn't have to do with the other.
Right?
Sure it doesn't.
We're going to put on a little show.
You'll get to meet a couple of convicts and have a scary story to tell your friends.
And let's just hope that when you sign off on this place, we can all get back to making the world a better place.
After you, ma'am.
This is General Population.
All employees in
Sector 4, please stand clear.
Jesus.
Pretty impressive?
Yes, it is.
Now, we've prepared an interview room for you.
We're going to need to have a look at that room.
Well, that's fine.
One thing, on the prisoners' side of the room, we don't allow weapons.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Okay?
Yeah, all set.
Oh, there you are.
Oh, yeah. I thought
I could smell you coming.
I'm here to tell you the good news, Snow.
You're finally getting spayed?
Oh, congratulations.
You've been convicted.
First degree murder and conspiracy to commit espionage against the United States.
That's the setup.
Do you want to hear the punch line?
Yeah, I'm dying to.
M.S. One. 30-year stasis.
No parole.
Effective immediately.
And nothing about a constitutional right to a fair hearing?
I think you waived that right when you shot Armstrong.
Oh, yeah, of course.
I forgot that part. I'm sorry.
You know what they say about being put under?
That some minds just can't take it.
I'm looking forward to it.
Sweet dreams.
I don't know about you, but I can't drive home.
Mr. Hydell.
How are you feeling?
Are you experiencing any disorientation?
I can't see out of that eye any more.
And what happened to your face, did you burn it?
Yeah, it's a love bite.
I see.
Yeah.
I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience and treatment here.
Do you dream while you're under?
Well, I'm gonna dream about you. Aren't I?
I'd appreciate it if you'd take it seriously, though.
It's very serious.
Very serious.
So, it says here you were convicted of aggravated physical assault.
No,
I'm innocent. That wasn't me.
That's a case of mistaken identity.
Fifty-three counts?
I've a very familiar face.
It's not like your face.
You've a very kind face.
It's lovely.
You're perfect, you are.
I bet you got a nice smile.
Do a little smile for me.
Oh, smile.
You've got a lovely smile!
Easy.
Hock.
Answer the question.
Stay out of this, please.
What's that smell in here?
Calm down.
You're wearing perfume, aren't you?
Mr. Hydell.
Answer the question.
Hock!
You're a filthy article, man.
You are a bad man! What's wrong with you?
You wanna test me?
Sit down!
Hock!
Okay. You wanna test me?
Hock!
Do you know what I was before
I was convicted of rape, cock?
Surprise me, shithead.
Hock! Stop!
I was a pickpocket.
Huh?
He's got a gun!
M.S. One Control, we are...
Sir? There seems to be a fire alarm on M.S. One.
Hide.
What?
Hide.
What?
Hide?
Hello.
Where is she?
Who? Who? What? What?
"Who? Who? What? What?"
Don't lie to me, man.
I'll eat your brain.
I'm not lying to you, man.
Control room active.
Stay there.
Hairdo!
Are you all right, man?
Have I hurt your nose?
Come here. Get up, man.
Come here.
Sit down.
Open them all up right now.
Every single one.
No, I don't think that's a good...
Think? You should think?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Get it done.
Canisters open.
Good. That's a good job, man.
Remember, safety is our first priority.
It has been 364 days since our last incident.
Good work, team.
Go! Go! Go!
Come on.
Oh, no.
Damn.
Hit the sleeping gas.
Hit it!
Whoa! Easy!
Get up. Get up!
No! No!
Hey!
In less than an hour, all these people, including young
Emilie Warnock here, will be the only thing keeping us alive.
You don't mess with your poker chips.
M.S. One, this is L.O.P.D.
Do you copy? Over.
What's going on?
Company.
Smoke leakage on the starboard hull,
possibly halon.
Look who I found, man!
Get off the door, man.
Found you a proper egghead.
Turn on the guns.
Here. Calm down.
There you go.
That's clever, isn't it?
Okey-dokey.
Leave it.
Why leave it, man? Come on.
I said, leave it.
Copy that.
Keep all eyes open.
Full recon mission.
- Establish M. S. One status...
- Moving out.
Oh, serious.
Sorry!
We're taking fire.
They have opened fire.
You think you're running the show?
Get this into your thick skull.
You're not running the show.
Sorry.
Mr. President.
Everybody out.
Now! Get out!
Sir, within the last hour, there has been a massive infraction on Supermax M.S. One.
It's a takeover.
Oh, God.
Emilie. Is she...
She's fine, according to her telemetry, but the situation is critical.
We can have special forces up there on site within six hours.
To do what exactly?
I just mean, what order do we give, Mr. President?
What are you saying?
I'm asking, are we talking about saving all the hostages?
Or are we talking about saving just one in particular?
Now we can send in the Marines, but we have no real idea of the whereabouts of your daughter on board.
As soon as we launch this large-scale offensive, my guess is...
Well, she's as good as dead, sir.
Or...
What?
We can send in one man.
One man with one very specific order.
To get Emilie Warnock out.
Who?
I'd rather castrate myself with blunt rocks.
Why don't you get
Rupert to do it?
Hey. How's it going?
This is the best offer you'll get.
Don't get me wrong.
It's a dream vacation.
I mean, I load up,
I go into space,
I get inside the maximum-security nuthouse, save the President's daughter if she's not dead already, get past all the psychos who've just woken up.
I'm thrilled that you would think of me.
Hmm.
See you in 30 years.
Wait.
Snow, you should really think about this.
Because it could benefit all of us.
Okay, I'm joking.
I'll do it.
Oh, Frank's lighter.
Oh.
Here, put this on.
Please proceed to the shuttle immediately.
LM23, you are clear for takeoff.
So, how many prisoners exactly?
Mainly rapists and murderers.
You'll fit right in.
How do we know she's not dead already?
She's wearing a telemetry medical transmitter.
All the First Family have them.
Nice to live in the big white house?
So we know she's alive.
And she has had some blood loss, but it's nothing life-threatening. So far.
So, if I actually find her and she is alive, how do we get off the ship?
Easy. Hitch a ride, man.
There's an escape pod on level five.
It's not on any of the schematics, but you can find it on this map.
It'll guide you to the pod and give you the access code.
The pod will take the two of you off M.S. One.
Is that clear?
Yeah, clear as mud.
Here.
What's that for?
Climbing down off sidewalks?
No, no, no.
It's explosives.
You join those two ends, you got a nine-second charge.
It's grade two, for opening heavy secure panels or bulkheads.
Bulkheads?
Uh-huh.
I gotta get out of here.
That's enough!
I gotta get out of here.
That's okay.
You go to sleep now.
Anyone else?
I'm gonna need a doctor to get this stitched up.
Thank you.
Hey, lab coat.
You, move! Doc, let's go.
Hey, wait, she's not a doctor.
Easy there, tough guy. Easy.
Okay. Let's go. Get your ass up.
Get your ass up.
Stitch it up.
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell is going on here?
We're taking over.
And who are you?
Secret Service.
I didn't hear anything about this.
That will be why they call it secret, right?
What's happening?
They demanded a negotiator.
He's prepping now.
They've been leaving a live feed open.
This is Special
Agent Scott Langral and I'm in charge of this situation.
In charge?
That's where you're very much mistaken.
So there she is.
Right in the hornet's nest.
Let me know when you've picked up on it, won't you?
When I want your opinion,
I'm gonna give it to you.
Okay.
Hey.
Picked up on what?
Oh, nothing. You know, just that they don't know they've got the President's daughter, that's all.
So, do you like working in space?
Yeah, I like it.
You do? Do you get dizzy?
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes?
Yeah, I would.
Hey, Snow.
How do you figure that out?
Far be it from me to teach you how to suck eggs, but you'd think they might have said something.
And they've got her playing doctor.
I'm just saying.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?
We've prepared a little demonstration.
Barnes? Hello, Barnes?
Gotta make sure, man.
Let me find...
Listen, if you're gonna shit yourself, now would be the perfect time, wouldn't it?
Go on, boys.
No. No!
Here we go.
Reality TV.
- No! No!
- Oh, no!
No, no, no, no.
I can help you!
Can you help me?
I can help you!
You're gonna need the help, boyo.
It's a bit chilly out there tonight.
Don't do this.
Don't do this. Wait!
Wait! I can help you!
Wait!
Bye-bye, Barnes.
Bye-bye, Barnes.
No, I can help.
Wait! The girl!
What about her?
The girl! The girl!
She's the President's...
Yep.
Oh, man! Did you see the look on his face?
He was about to say something.
He was about to say something like...
Oh.
Okay.
The clock is reset.
One hour and counting until the next show,
so I'd get my skates on if I were you.
Hey, tell me you are not still thinking of negotiating with these psychos.
This is all over the news in six hours.
Then they're going to know who she is.
We should just stick to the plan.
The plan? You can send your boy in if you want.
I'm just doing what's best for the situation right now.
Right?
Thank you.
I'm happy not to go.
You're going.
Okay.
Go now.
All right.
Hey, easy, easy, big guy.
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay, easy.
Things you asked for are on the way.
Is everybody okay?
For the time being, sure.
We're doing our bit.
I was wondering, what are you going to do for us?
Don't tell me, you're looking for a hostage.
That certainly would be a good start.
Hey, four eyes.
Ain't no one leaving, man.
No. You hear me? No.
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?
If this works I'll wear a tutu and pink pantyhose.
Snow, let's be ready, okay?
Okay.
This thing is contained right now.
But you keep blasting people out the airlock, the press gets involved and all bets are off and nobody goes anywhere.
Now, you look like a smart guy, so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
They're going to let you go.
But you really think they're gonna let 500 convicts go?
You, maybe five or six others, can get out of here.
It's what we call breakage.
Why should I give up a hostage?
You know why they really ask for a hostage, don't you?
Because it tells them one important thing.
This guy is in charge here.
Maybe you're not the guy who makes decisions around here.
Don't go there.
I'm definitely the man you should be talking to.
Okay, all right.
Show me you're in charge then.
Give me a hostage.
Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Let's hold on.
This stuffed shirt may well pull this off.
Oh, Jesus! Coming, going. Make up your minds.
One hostage?
One.
Who do you want? Whoever.
Usually one of the wounded, or, I don't know, maybe a woman.
A wounded woman's always popular.
Okay, we got eight principals, four low-vel riot shotguns, three Berettas, low-vel semis.
You choose.
Up. Get up.
Why me?
Get up.
Honey, you'll be fine.
Looks like my plan is working.
Sorry.
What's going on here?
Not her. Not her.
No, no, no, no. Not her.
A decision's been made.
Please, man. Not her.
Not that one, no.
Pick another one.
Crawl back under your stone.
Don't say that.
This woman needs medical assistance. Come on.
I didn't realize. I forget.
I just let myself run away with myself, you know.
You want a wounded hostage?
No!
Back off.
Go see to your friends, Cock.
No.
You wanted a wounded hostage and now you have one, don't you? Eh?
Everybody's happy.
Everybody wins. Eh?
You're happy. Yeah?
Kathryn, it's gonna be okay.
Snow, it's gone bad.
You gotta get in there, man. Get in there.
Kathryn, we're gonna get you home, okay?
Kathryn.
It's a setup.
There's some guy outside climbing on board.
Kathryn, I just need you to breathe with me.
Listen, I was just doing what I was supposed...
Kathryn.
Kathryn, look at me.
I really... I... Please...
You said I could trust you.
Listen, I was just gonna...
Please.
Bring them back inside.
Come on, Emilie, let's go.
Come on now.
Do something useful.
Go find that man and kill him.
I don't wanna see you till it's done.
Why don't we just kill that lunatic?
Because he's my brother.
Okay. Hold on, nearly there. Okay, got it.
You need to look around and you should see a sealed port.
- You got it?
- Yeah, I see it.
Okay. I need you to pull back on the small quick release.
Right.
Are you in?
Snow.
Snow?
Snow, can you hear me?
Warnock?
There you are.
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait. This way.
We'll be safe here.
Nothing getting through that.
So what now?
We wait.
They're sending the Marines.
It won't be long.
Snow, what's going on? , Uh, you know, global warming,
some celebrity is getting a boob-job,
Congress is screwing the pooch again.
You know, same old.
Snow.
Come on, man. I mean, what's going on there?
Oh, yeah. Well,
your wildcat smacked me in the head with a fire extinguisher
and locked herself in some room.
So she's safe.
Send the cavalry.
Listen, Snow.
You stick to the plan.
You better do your job
or I'll hit you with a Sherman tank. Got that?
A Sherman tank?
Yeah, right.
Toss my caber, Langral.
I've got other things to do.
Hey, Snow...
The answer to all our problems lies behind this door.
Get me a security engineer.
Actually, bring me two.
Snow, can you hear me?
Snow.
Come on, Snow.
Snow, can you hear me?
It's Langral.
I want you to go in and get her. Now.
Actually, that's a little inconvenient right now.
I don't care.
She's losing oxygen.
She's suffocating.
You understand?
You're making this up, right?
Snow, it's Harry here.
This is for real. At the current rate of nitrogen buildup, she will be dead in...
How long?
Five minutes, man.
Yeah. Well, contrary to popular belief,
I'm not actually Houdini and those things are designed to be impregnable.
So, I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.
You all right?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Hopefully, this will short-circuit me the inevitable
"it can't be done" discussion.
I need this door open.
You should see a ladder in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Okay, I need you to take it.
And then, when you're over, you gotta go straight ahead.
And here's where it gets a little bit tricky.
I need you to get to the other side. Correct?
What do you want me to do, fly?
'Cause I think I left my cape at home.
I need you to listen to this, buddy. Go.
The gravity generated by the torsion system will hold you up.
You gotta trust me on this.
You should just glide right over.
Really?
Snow?
Snow!
Snow, there is no time for hanging around.
What is that?
All channels.
Snow, can you hear me?
Reactivate the torsion.
What is that?
They're trying to get it open.
Can they do that?
This may take a bit longer.
That really is unfortunate.
We're gonna need a new engineer.
This one's sprung a leak.
Okay, so that was easy, right?
Are you at the hatch? Snow?
Your two minutes start now.
Shoot me if you want, but I can guarantee this open if you give me five minutes.
Good sales pitch.
Oxygen levels depleted.
Oh, God, no.
Please seek medical assistance.
Please seek medical assistance.
Okay, Emilie, listen to me very carefully.
Nitrogen is lighter than oxygen, so there will be more at floor level.
Breathe shallow but steady.
Keep your heart rate low.
I'm sorry.
Something happened.
Somehow she found more oxygen, but that will only give us a minute or so.
Snow, you gotta get in there.
EEG activity declining.
Brain death in 20 seconds.
Twenty seconds.
Lost him.
Twenty seconds and then this is all over.
Yeah. I should've stayed in college.
Okay.
Hot girl on the floor, big hole in her leg.
Okay, first let's get the motor going.
Open the medi-pack.
You need to get the defib kit.
Fifteen seconds.
You know the counting thing?
It's not very relaxing.
Gel them, place them on the chest,
center under the right arm.
Make sure they stay on her.
Ten seconds.
And...
Bingo! Got an induced-pulse.
Seven, six...
So why is there still counting?
Not done yet.
Find the Vidadermic labeled "20 ccs. "
Serotonin norepinephrine. What the hell do I do with this?
It's a neurotransmitter stimulant.
You've got to push the needle through the center of her right eye into the brain.
Come on, you're kidding me, right?
Move it around until it locates the thalamus.
It's self-guiding.
Then fire it.
Okay.
I'm gonna be sick.
Okay.
We've got some activity.
Yeah, we've got activity all right.
She's doing the lambada in here.
Get some air in there.
What, mouth to mouth?
Mouth to mouth.
Here we go.
Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
It's okay, it's okay.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm bringing you back from the dead.
I was dead?
Yeah, and so far I think
I prefer you that way.
Come on, that's enough foreplay.
We gotta get out of here.
You! Let's go. Come on.
Back to the kennel!
Shit.
Watch your head.
Take the next left.
Okay, this way.
Then go about 50 feet.
But watch your back, man.
Remember Kiev.
Hold it, her BP is dropping.
She's losing too much blood.
Hey, Snow, docs say check Emilie's leg.
Yeah. I'll put it on the to-do list.
You're almost there, buddy.
I understand you're the prison's communications expert.
I've a job for you.
Bollocks.
Now it is vitally important
that you go the right way.
Whatever you do, for Christ's sake, don't go down the...
Harry? Harry.
Hey, Snow. Can you hear me?
Shit!
They've cut transmission.
Who did?
The little transmission fairies.
Who do you think?
Greg, what the hell is happening here?
This way.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
You don't sound sure.
Well, lam.
It's electromagnetic lockout.
Christ.
Find a way to get me back in because we're flying blind here.
I thought you said you were sure.
You're really a lot of fun, you know that?
Come on, don't worry.
It's perfectly safe.
Oh, you don't have to do that!
A simple "thank you" is enough.
Yuck.
Asshole.
So, well, we lost them, huh?
Right.
Sorry.
Up you get.
Thank you.
Ugh. yuck.
Hmm.
Who are you?
Who sent you?
Your old man did.
My dad.
What did he say?
Well, I didn't get to meet him personally.
He kind of delegated your rescue.
He had a big conference on the corn surplus.
You're kidding me?
No. No, apparently, we should all be eating more corn.
About my father.
Oh, yeah,
I made that other bit up.
Did he have a message for me?
Yes, you are adopted.
Are you the only type of jerk they found for this kind of mission?
The only one stupid enough to say yes.
So, what's the plan?
Surely you have a plan to rescue the hostages?
What hostages?
The hostages.
The staff, the guards.
Should I write it out in crayon?
I came here to rescue you and mission accomplished.
And quite well, I might add.
Are you just thrilled being yourself all day or is it a part-time job?
I'm not kidding.
We can't just leave them.
Leave who?
The hostages!
Ow!
What is that?
That's to stop the bleeding.
And hopefully, the talking.
They will die if we leave them.
Listen, we're not going back to rescue any hostages, okay?
We're getting out of here, after I do one thing.
There. That's the plan.
Are you always this obnoxious?
Did you hear something?
No, I'm just enjoying the silence.
You asshole.
We are not leaving them.
Listen, it's really very sweet of you, but there's not a lot of room for anybody else, okay?
It's kind of a VIP deal, get it?
- What I get is, you're a selfish dick...
- Ow!
That'll freeze the nerves in this spot for 24 hours.
You want some on your mouth?
No?
Okay, see here on the map?
Yeah.
That's where the pod is.
You get in it, you fly away and the good guys will come and get you. Okay?
On my own?
You're a big girl, right?
Here's an apple. And a gun.
Don't talk to strangers.
Shoot them.
This is the plan you agreed on with my father?
Yeah, he said it'll toughen you up.
Apparently, you need that.
Well, I'm sure I'll be fine. Where are you going?
Oh, I've got a hot date.
It's been a real slice, so good luck.
And good luck with the leg thing.
Okay.
Okay, the map.
You gotta flip it.
It's upside down.
No, no. So you can see the screen.
Which Way's north?
Okay, we're in space now.
So it's not north, it's port and starboard.
Thanks.
You're doing great.
Can I have your attention?
You want to get out of here?
Our meal ticket is a woman.
And she's been on the run for some time now.
We need her alive
and we need her as soon as possible.
Now, they're going to try and leave the station.
Watch everywhere.
Yeah, okay, you can tag along, but maybe don't talk.
Just keep it zipped.
Here, give me the map.
Okay, we go this way.
North.
Smiler!
Are you there?
Sweetheart,
I miss you. Smiler!
Hey, why do they do that?
Do what?
The marking on the face.
Other prisoners do it to them.
Lets everyone know you're a rat.
Here, put these on.
No.
They don't come in pink.
You can't walk past 500 whack jobs dressed like a chick.
Oh, so this is part of your plan.
So kind of you to clue me in.
You can't smoke in here.
All evidence to the contrary.
So...
So, what do I call you?
You know what?
Don't call me.
What's your name?
Snow.
Snow?
Yeah.
Or Sir. You can decide.
What's your first name?
Snow.
Your name is Snow Snow?
Well, that's just ridiculous.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I just did.
No, you didn't.
What is that?
Engine oil, coffee, some water I just got out of the toilet.
And just what do you plan on doing with it?
I plan on putting it in your hair.
If you would like to play witness protection and shampoo in toilet water, be my guest. Not me.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Not on your life.
God, stop!
It stinks!
Enough!
There you go.
Wasn't that fun? Huh?
You're a pig.
Thank you.
You always treat women this way?
Always. Well, only if I like them.
You have any idea what my father would do to you?
Oh, jeez!
Not raise taxes again?
Here.
Yeah, you look good.
Though, something's missing.
What?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's only cosmetic.
It's only cosmetic.
It's nothing personal.
Here, look, look.
It'll probably save your life.
You look tough now, see?
Ow!
You really are a naughty boy, Special Agent.
What, you thought we wouldn't find out?
Don't know what you're talking about.
You tell Warnock that we have his daughter.
And unless we get what we want,
you tell your boss that I've got 500 pent-up convicts
all too eager to educate his little girl.
Okay.
What do you want?
What's happened?
Is Emilie okay?
What's going on here, man?
What's it look like?
We're going on a hunting trip.
You're going to get her?
I mean, let me come.
No.
Don't leave me behind, man.
What am I gonna do here?
Nothing.
And don't do anything stupid when I'm gone.
All right?
Mmm.
Okay.
This is Main Containment, so don't draw attention to yourself.
And what if this doesn't work?
Well, then we're probably gonna die.
Is that your idea of encouragement?
What can I say? I'm sorry it's not one of your fancy presidential society functions.
Where do you get these ideas about me?
I don't know. You know, you just don't seem like the kind of girl who'd go bowling.
Excuse me? Bowling?
I happen to be great at bowling.
Really? You go bowling?
Yeah. Every Tuesday.
There's a lane at the White House.
Yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.
That is hardly my fault.
Careful, you're starting to sound like your old man.
Here. Not even loaded.
Dude, you're a dude, okay?
Hey, you! Yeah, you.
You know who we're talking to.
What are you looking for?
Mace.
Like the spray?
No, not like the spray.
Mace!
Shit!
Can I help you?
No. Well, you could get out of the way.
No problem.
Just give me the password.
Oh, yeah.
I like your pretty boy buddy.
Does he like to party?
Yeah. Like it's 1999.
Don't you?
Oh.
You don't know the password.
Then there's a penalty.
Get them!
The door's jammed!
Here, shoot them, will you?
Jesus, I thought you were a Democrat.
Mace! Come on.
Mace! You son of a bitch.
Ow, ow, ow.
You Okay?
Okay. Okay.
Bitch, son of a bitch.
What the hell's wrong with you, buddy?
Buddy? Buddy, you.
Buddy, you be. No.
No. Not to be. No. Wrong!
What's going on, man?
I know what this is.
It's dementia.
Come on, he's like 35.
It's from the stasis.
Some people just unravel.
Gravel.
So, it is true.
True, true, true, true.
True blue. Union stew.
To do or not to do. Right?
No, wrong.
Wrong. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby...
Shit.
I need you to get me something.
Now you're asking a crazy man where he hid a briefcase that you threw away in a crowded subway station?
Mace? Remember the case?
Huh? The package?
In the train station. I threw it to you on the train.
Where'd you put it?
Right.
Yeah, no, I put it...
Yeah?
In my pants.
In your pants?
Yeah. Sister Mary said it was bad to take it out in church in front of the other kids.
When you do bad things, the angels, they cry.
That's what Sister Mary says.
It's a disruption in his cortical circuitry.
It's why I'm here.
It's just bad news.
That's what it is.
Come on, buddy. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Why are you bringing him?
He's one of them.
He's safer without us.
I need him.
For what?
This phantom briefcase?
You'd be lucky to get a recipe for mud pies out of this guy.
He's coming with us, okay?
End of story.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Don't let them get away!
Oh, come on. God damn it!
Get them! Over here!
Okay, this way! This way!
Come on.
- Put a light down there.
- Gotta go.
Go, go, go.
Gotta go!
- Go, go.
- Go, go. Okay. Go.
Porn horn.
Okay, come on.
Whoa, man. Ow. Ow.
Oh, God!
Come on, Mace! Mace!
Hit the panic button!
Come on, buddy.
Hit the panic button.
Button, button. Mutton.
The button.
Hit the panic button.
Hit the panic button, Mace.
Come on! Button.
Son of a bitch.
Button.
Son of a bitch.
Shit! Hold on, buddy.
Wait there!
Oh, dear. Locked.
Lock. Locker. Locker.
Green. Beans. Locker.
Mace. Mace.
Mace.
Mace. Case.
Chase. Lullaby.
Mace, case.
I foresee you.
I see you.
What?
I see you.
I foresee you. Lullaby.
I foresee you.
Hold on, buddy. Come on.
Come on.
God damn it!
If you want something done...
We need a change of plan
'round here.
Well, that's that then.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, right. I'm sure you are.
I know he was your friend.
I don't need your sympathy, okay? Neither does he.
No.
No, he needed a friend who wouldn't hang him out to dry.
Yeah, I'm taking the rap for something I didn't do, okay?
I didn't put him here.
Who cares?
People die all the time.
It's no big deal.
How many people have died for you since you got here?
Oh, but you're the President's daughter, so you're worth it, right?
Looks like your little PR trip got all screwed up.
I came here to ensure that people were being treated fairly and decently, unlike yourself.
You know, it's easy to be a saint with nothing on the line.
You wait till you've got a serious sacrifice to make and then you'll find out who you really are.
Most people run for cover.
But not you, right?
No.
No.
You just sacrifice your friends.
Sorry, hold on.
You're saying that the
International Space Station ran into M.S. One?
No, I'm saying the opposite.
M.S. One ran into the
International Space Station.
I thought it was locked in orbit.
It was controlled by a geo-orbital technician.
And where is this technician?
They blew him out an airlock.
Look, M.S. One is essentially a big fly-by-wire system.
Without constant monitoring, it's basically falling out of the sky.
What's the bottom line?
Best guess?
Please.
Impact with the Eastern
Seaboard in eight hours.
Can you get me a secure line to Jack Tallis at Justice?
Bingo.
It's a rescue mission!
That's not a rescue mission.
Come on.
I thought you said there were two seats.
No, two pods!
You take this one and I'll jump in the other one.
Where's the other one? We don't have time for this, okay?
Just get in.
You are going in the other pod, right?
I'll be right behind you, don't worry.
Promise me.
Yeah, okay, I promise.
What is your first name?
I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll race you down.
I'll buy you an ice cream.
Sir? We have pod launch on M.S. One.
What do you know!
Your deadbeat friend did it.
This your idea of keeping a promise?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why'd you get out of the pod?
I realized I might be the only thing keeping the hostages alive.
Really?
How do you figure that?
My father won't authorize an attack with me still here.
Have you actually met your father?
Don't start that.
We have to help them.
Look, I can't, okay?
I would love to, but I can't.
Mace told me where the case is.
Bullshit.
It was the last thing he said.
Really?
So where is it?
You help me, I help you.
Oh, come on!
Or are you all mouth, no trousers?
Fine.
You'll believe what you want.
I wasn't going to tell you, but your standards of sainthood crap won me over.
Okay, wait. Wait.
I'm a lot of trousers, okay?
Smiler!
There's been a change of plan.
We're going to have a sing-song instead. Okay?
All right, then.
♪ Come back to me
♪ My sweet, my little Emilie
Oh, God.
I've not told you the plan, man.
I didn't tell you the plan.
For every three seconds you're not here,
I'm gonna kill a man.
Do you understand me now?
So...
♪ Come back to me, my sweet, my little Emilie
♪ Where have you gone? ♪
Stop!
Tell me where you are
or I kill another one.
Please stop!
Emilie.
Hello, sweetheart.
I can hear you're upset there.
I'm bloody upset as well.
I'm sweating like a pig here.
Just stop.
I'll do anything you want.
Well, now, you're being silly.
I think you're being silly now.
Let me come and get you.
Tell me where you are and don't lie. Ever.
Emilie, don't.
Stop killing people.
You tell me the truth now
and I'll stop shooting your friends. Okay?
Level three.
Thank you.
No! God!
No!
Is anybody hiding?
'Cause I'll find you!
It's left.
He was gonna kill them all anyway.
I don't really know where the case is.
I just needed you to help me.
Okay.
Yeah.
This is what I was afraid of.
They've been using the prisoners as guinea pigs.
Yeah, looks like your hostage buddies are not exactly the innocent victims you thought they were, huh?
Liars everywhere these days it seems.
Don't move.
God, I hate that.
Hello, you two.
Do you know what you've done?
Turn on the comms.
Sir, comms are live.
All channels.
Snowfall?
This is Homefire.
Come in.
Snowfall, this is Homefire.
Come in.
Can we make this a secure channel, please?
Snow? Snow, are you there?
Harry, is that you?
Yeah, man. Live and direct.
For one night only. You?
Yeah. Put me on the guest list.
Did we manage to make contact with our friend?
Affirmative.
And what about the thing that you lost?
Did our friend come through for us?
Negative, Harry.
Okay, don't sweat it.
Look, things have kind of gone sideways here.
You gotta get out.
I didn't get the girl.
Ain't that the story of your life?
Yeah.
From what I'm reading on her vitals here,
it don't look good.
There's no way for you to get back to her even if she's not already dead.
M. S. One is falling out of the sky, Snow.
You gotta get out.
Okay.
Get to dock 9.
There's an ORAM engineering suit there.
Put it on and get outside.
You'll need to float around a bit, but I'm sending someone by to pick you up. Okay?
I think I'm just gonna lie here for a while,
and see if it all goes away.
No.
Oh.
All right.
The M.S. One is destabilized.
Let us on board, or we'll be forced to attack.
Now. You want to save your skin?
Tell your daddy to call off the assault.
Or I will set my brother onto you.
Dad?
Emilie, I'm here.
Emilie?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
Sweetheart?
Everyone's dead.
Blow this dump out of the sky.
Well, shit.
You get them back.
You hear me?
You call them off!
Promises are promises, Smiler!
So be it.
Promises, sweetheart.
Eh?
Leave her be.
That's it, then.
Sir, you need to authorize an assault.
Emilie's still on the station.
I know this might be difficult, sir, but she's just one hostage.
She is my daughter.
I know that, sir.
Then you know that
I cannot authorize that.
Then I'm sorry, Jeff.
Sorry?
Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, lam temporarily relieving you of all your duties as the President of the United States due to the fact that you are incapable of placing national security above personal concerns.
You can't do that.
You need vice-presidential and congressional approval.
Already signed.
You son of a bitch!
Thank you, sir.
Scott! Please.
Don't do this.
You'll kill her.
Go. Full breach.
Quarterback?
This is Homefire.
Dropkick authorized.
Full breach.
Moving into assault formation.
Weapons live.
Oh, shit!
You said that was your promise to me!
Quiet, we can salvage this.
Shut up for a second!
You said that was a promise to me, man.
Not now.
You choose him over me.
You leave me behind.
We've a serious problem and you're shouting about this?
You made me look stupid.
Every time I dig us out...
Mommy said you speak too much.
Who's gonna look after you now?
Families!
Hey, now then, where were we, Smiler?
Target will be throwing live rounds.
Watch out, the defense system is still active.
Okay, here we go.
Number 5, do you read me?
We're taking fire.
We're taking fire.
Come here. Come here!
Bitch!
You're back.
Yeah, well, I wasn't busy.
We should go.
All right, you need to move down 4.5 degrees.
6 o'clock, all units, 6 o'clock.
Coming in low.
Units two and three, I'm at your left.
Units two and three,
9 o'clock, 9 o'clock.
Taking fire, taking fire, unit 11, taking fire.
Second bomber down.
We got one more to go.
Unit nine.
We're on our way.
Unit nine, unit nine.
We're going in, unit 11.
Go for the tunnel.
Unit 17, he's on your tail.
Turn, turn!
We have you going for the hole, gentlemen.
Take a right!
Okay. Now put that thing on.
Fifty feet ahead, then right. Almost there.
- Unit eight, 50 feet!
- Under the gun!
Twenty-yard line!
Drop the baby.
Baby dropped.
Confirming, confirming.
Touchdown! Let's go!
All units evac.
All units evac.
Snow, every second counts here, man.
Get outside.
I gotta tell you something.
I really hate heights.
Emilie!
Emilie!
Emilie. Come on. Emilie.
Come on, buddy. Get up!
Okay.
Let's go.
The briefcase.
The train station.
I threw you the case.
Where'd you put it?
Where'd you put it? Mace?
You remember the package?
...In the train station.
True blue,
Union... Union...
True blue, Union... No.
True blue. Union stew.
Some people just unravel.
Now you're asking a crazy man where he hid a briefcase.
Green. Beans.
Mace?
Lock, lockers, locker.
Green. Green gloppy, stocker, stocker.
Mace. Mace.
Yeah.
Remember the case?
Where 'd you put it? I threw it to you on the train.
Case.
- Where'd you put it?
- Green.
Well, locked, clock.
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.
Green, gloppy, lullaby.
What briefcase?
I see you.
I see you.
I foresee you.
I foresee you.
I see you.
I foresee you.
What happened in that room?
What happened in that room?
That's not what happened.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Running out of jokes, are we?
That's not what happened.
I saw it with my own eyes.
There's something that we need to do.
Thanks, Charlie.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
I'm good.
How's the girl?
As far as they'll tell me she's fine.
You did a good job.
Sorry about Mace.
And that you didn't get the thing you needed.
No, no, I got it.
No, I mean the briefcase.
Yeah. Yeah,
I got the briefcase.
You got the briefcase?
Yeah.
I thought that you...
No, it's here.
The case is here?
Yeah. You want to see it?
Uh...
Yeah.
Charlie? Can you grab it?
You know Frank was undercover when he was killed, right?
He wasn't selling secrets.
He was returning them.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
What I don't understand is how you knew the combination.
That's what I don't understand.
Right.
Well...
Well, this is awkward.
They pay you well?
Matter of fact, they did.
No, they really did.
How much was that exactly?
How much was
Frank's life worth?
Does the number even matter, Snow?
I hope they put you away for a long time.
You know,
I don't think they will.
You of all people know that they like to keep all these kind of things on the down-low.
My guess, I'll do three years tops at minimum security, and you want to know why?
Because they need people like me.
I know all of their dirty little secrets.
Ain't that right?
I am sorry about Frank, but in the big scheme of things, he'll go down as an innocent bystander.
He won't even make the balance sheet.
Just like you.
Because he's a relic.
I mean, God, look at you.
Nobody smokes any more, Snow!
You know, for all your bluster and your bullshit, you're nothing but cannon-fodder.
You're cannon-fodder and they don't need you like they need me, okay?
Ignem feram.
That was from Frank.
So, all this trouble for an empty briefcase.
Don't let it keep you up at night.
Thanks, Charlie.
Hey, Snow!
Good job.
Take this, don't let them take this.
Frank.
What's it gonna be, buddy?
I know something about you.
Amazing what you can find out as First Daughter in old Army documents.
Last name, Snow.
First name,
Marion.
My old man was a big John Wayne fan.
Must have been tough on the playground.
That's why I'm so lovable.
Looks like you're a free man.
Thanks to you.
What kind of Robin Hood would I be if I didn't stop to rescue
Maid Marion once in a while?
Okay, you can stop that.
Snow's just fine.
No, I'm getting used to Marion. I really like it.
Makes me see your feminine side.
Oh. Great.
I've got something for you.
What the hell was that for?
I owed you that.
I really feel we need to continue this on an equitable basis.
You know, for a minute there,
I thought you were going to kiss me.
Where's the entourage?
Gave them the slip.
Have you to thank for teaching me that.
Nice work.
You're still bleeding, Marion.
And you wonder why I didn't tell you my first name?
All right, how about "Sally"?
It has a nice ring to it.
Yes, it does, but I prefer Snow.
I can't call you that.
It sounds like an ice cream.
Speaking of which,
I believe you owe me one.
You know, I've got this feeling your old man's not going to approve of this.
I mean, I can't really see this going anywhere, can you?
Depends on how good you are in bed.
Well, in that case,
I give it at least 10 minutes.

Area 51
No Tresspassing
I ... I love it here.
You know ...
It feels so ...
Right.
Yeah.
5,339 miles from home, and somehow i feel I belong.
I know what you mean.
I know you mean.
I think this is probably the most fun
I've ever had. You know?
I'm so glad we came Clive.
Clive?
May I?
Be my guest.
I was over there, on my own.
That there is a black vampire.
Watch out !
She bites.
- How much?
- 1,349 dolars, 99 cents.
Are you gonna get it?
Fair enough.
I can't believe we're gonna meet
Adam Shadowchild.
I know ...
He's like the coolest man on the world.
Thank you.
Come forth.
Welcome my friends.
I just wanted to say that "Planet
Vortulagy" is a huge influence on me and ...
... and my work and Sebastian
Rico is a wonderful protagonist.
Don't tell me.
You're a writer.
I am, yeah.
He actually won a Nebulon
Award in 1992.
Working on a follow up.
I'd love to see that.
No, not today.
No, it's a legal thing,
I'm sure it's ...
I'm sure it's good, it's a wonderful cover ...
Three tits.
Awesome ...

- I'm the artist.
My illustrator.
Move along please guys.

Then fuck off ...
Let's get picture of you and me and Adam.
- Ok, ready?
- Ready.
Encounter Briefs
- Yes, yes.
- Is that the RV place?
- Yes.
It's definitely two single beds because there's been a bit of a mix up at the hotel.
Ok, excellent, thank you very much ...
... and have a nice day to you as well.
- Are they here?
- It's in the car park.
- You mean the "parking lot".
- I suure doe ...
Like two American boys.
It nice isn't it? We're actually here.
America, huh?
How long have we dreamt about this?
Since we were kids.
Yeah.
Now, look at us.
Grown men ...

Come on in.
Uh ... Where can i set these down?
Uhm, you can put it on the bed.
You guys on honeymoon?
No ...
- No, we're just ...
- We're just friends.
There's been a mix up at the ... reservations been messed up.
Let's clear up the table.
Going on a road trip, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes.
Well, you know what?
Better way to follow a comic con ...
... than a tour of America's most famous UFO hot spots.
Huh?
You know ... we gonna ...
... take Area 51, and the
Black Mailbox in Nevada ...
... and down to Camp Verde, then to Apache Junction and ...
... then down to Rosewell, New Mexico, for the sight of the famous crash in '47.
- Ah, no ...
- Everybody knows that.
- Stop it !
It's an alleged sight at this point.
But why would they admit the crash if the crach happened somewhere else?
- Just agree to ...
- Agree to disagree.
- Again.
- That's what we ...
Do you believe in Aliens?
What do you mean, "Aliens"?
- I'll get rid of that ...
- I'll get it ...
... out of your way.
It's the worst thing.
Thank you.
- Have a nice honeymoon.
- Uh, thank you.

Oh,we wrote the "Venusian
Pangenesis".
I didn't read that one.
"The Jenny Star Pepper in the Great Brass Hand"?
Nah ...
"The Robots Mistress"?
Nah, I like romances.
That's kind of a romance.
What you mean?
A woman and a machine?
- Ah ... yeah.
- I hear that !
So, you fellas are set, or can i get you something else?
I'd like a refill of coffee please Pat.
All right then.

Very funny.
You sit on top of that bull, right?
And he goes ... co-co-coues ! (?)
What?
I don't know you.
Uh ... some comics.
How do you thinks that makes me feel?
Be rude to me.
Uhh ... Eggy.
An alien just sitting on my palms.
Clive, um ...
What?
Hey, I'm joking !
They got a soap dispencer like an head of an aliens head.
It's brilliant !
What?
Here it comes !
What?
Hey, fellas !
How you doin' today?
What is this, some kind of gay bar?
Nah, it's a place where you can get a bite to eat and ...
... maybe share a close encounter.
Yep, sounds like a gay bar.
Oh ! Oh, no we're just friends.
So, you guys look like you could do like a couple of beers.
You go do that !
All right, we can do that !
Yeah, yes.
Leave it, leave it.
Thank you very much.
What you doin'?
Don't you put those queer eyes on me !
I forgot the sticker !
What took you so long?
I was putting the sticker up.
They're not pail, are they?
Yeah, definitely not kind my kind of people.
Yeah, well ...
Not very much we'll be seeing them again.
Oh !
That wasn't their truck, was it?
No ...
Should I go and have a look?
No ...
Extraterrestail Highway
Black Mailbox
Wow ...
It's probably the coolest thing
I've ever seen.
Do you remember when we googled it on your mom's computer and ...
... and the phone rang and you thought that it was the FBI ?
I didn't really thinks it was the FBI.
- You started crying.
- I just ...
You never been to Brussels.
Go stand next to it.
Yep.
Smile.
It's good.
Imagine if we got buzzed by a craft.
Amazing, isn't it?
Smile.
What would you do if they actually landed?
Well, the first contact is a big responsibility, isn't it?
They come in peace, we go to pieces?
- That's not how i roll.
- Nah ...
Do you think, that's those men?
No ...
I think we've seen enough ...
Let's go ...
Go, go, go ... !
- Come on, get it ...
- This is like "Deliverence".
A rapist who break arms?
I don't want my arms broken !
Come on, the toilet ...
- You've just been ...
-You know I've god child's bladder.
Do not let 'em get past !
What you want me to do?
Ram them?
What about the deposit ?!
It's not them !
It's not them,
It's not them ...
Ah, oh my God ...
It was awful ...
Hello?
Maybe you should call for help.
It's ringing.
I wouldn't do that if i were you.
Put ... the phone ... down.
Oh, fuck me ...
What have you done to him ?!
I didn't do anything, he fainted.
But ... you made him faint !
Yes, but it's not like i set my phaser to faint ...
You've got a phaser?
No ... I don't ... look !
Listen ...
Hey ... I really need your help. Ok?
Can we get this guy back in your wagon?
What ... whe ...
You're an alien !
To you, I am, yes.
Are you gonna probe us?
Why does everyone always assume that?
What am I doing?
Am I harvesting farts?
How much can I learn from an ass?
What ... I ... what ...
I'm sorry, what's your name?
Graeme Willy
And what's his name?
Uh, that's the writer
Clive Gollings.
Ok, cool.
I'm Paul.
Paul?
Yeah.
It's a nickname, it stuck.
My ship crashed and i ...
... dog ! It doesn't matter.
Look, can we get Clive Gollings back on the RV and get the hell outa here, please?
- I can't be ...
- I'm in a hell of a pickle ...
And if you don't help me,
I could die on this road tonight.
I don't know, we're in a quite tight schedule ...
Look man ...
Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice.
What do you say?
Okay.
Okay. Perfect, great !
Okay, help me, help me grab him.
This man's peed his pants.
Yeah, he's got childs bladder.
Oh, fantastic ...
Doesn't this thing go any faster?
Well, I ...
- I'm sorry, the speed limit is 70 ...
- Screw the speed limit !
Actually, no. Uh, don't screw it.
That's good thinking. Okay?
Stay conspicuous.
That's good.
How come i can understand you?
You using some sort of neoron language router?
Actually, I'm speaking English, you fucking idiot !
Sorry ...
You're in shock right now.
I understand this must be very weird for you.
Just act normal and drive north.
Okay?
Gotta get as much as we can between us and the Big Guy.
Zoil?
What's happening?
He's gone.
Shit !
Looks like he hitched a ride too.
- What do you mean?
- Tire tracks.
Bastard jacked a native ?!
Could be too ...
Don't you think this is a bit of a coincidence?
Are you suggesting anew?
The little fucker might've found home.
There might be a rescue party on the way.
Zoil, we need to break out the big guns.
Do you think that's wise?
The last thing we need is...
... a hu-ha ?!
Maybe you're right.
Listen, I got 2 rookies on a special mission 75 clicks north of you.
I'll have them set up a road block.
These are just civillians, why don't you let me take care of it?
You might need the extra muscle.
Just keep 'em in the dark.
I don't want any loose ends.
Well, these roads can be treacherous at night.
People get in accidents ...
... all the time.
I like your thinking.
Get it done.
Heads up !
We just got reassigned.
Nice !
What about the sandwich?
- She said we could share it.
- I love this job.
I love pistachios.
I hate when you get a closed one, right?
I usually just bite them.
No, you don't do it at all.
They should be opened on their own way.
- No, that's mussels.
- No, I meant the pistachios ...
What are you doing ?!
He's ok, he's fine, he's friendly !!
His name's Paul !
Aliens aren't called Paul ...
Was that Klingon?
You psychotic nerd !
Listen, Paul is from a small M-Class planet nothern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
Thank you.
He looks too obvious !
There's a reason for that Clive !
Over the last 60 years, the human race has been drip fed of images ...
... of my face, on lunch boxes, and t-shirts and shit.
In case our species do meet, you don't have a fuckin' spaz attack !!...
Don't do it again !
You fuckin' dorf, get your fingers outta there !
If i get a jorf infection, you're dead !
Oh, my god !
Oh, shit ...
Paul ...
Paul?
Ok, ok, this could be it.
So, what are we looking for again?
I don't know.
What brings you to USA?
Uh, we're on holiday.
We've been to comic-con.
Comic-con?
Don't tell O'Rilley.
He loves that shit.
You guys know Benny Hill?
No ...
Oh my god, look at this !
- What ?!
- Look at this !
These guys met Adam Shadowchild.
Who the hell's
Adam Shadowchild?
He wrote the "Jupiter Praxis".
What?
"Jenny Starpepper and the Huge White Gibbon"?
Huh?
"Night of the Moths"?
Are you speaking English?
He's ... brilliant ...
What was he like?
He was a bit intense.
Oh, he's an artist.
Let me see this.
What is this, nerd porn?
- Oh no, that's Clives ...
- It's my novel.
Okay ...
Uh ! Three tits !
That's awesome ...
You guys should've given her 4 tits.
That's just sick !
I was just sayin'
Do you think this is it?
Not that full ...
What else did you find in there?
No, not much ...
Just some pissy jeans.
- Oh, Clive's got a child bladd....
- Shut up ...
Okay, you guys can go.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Can I have my novel?
Thank you very much.
May I ask what you're searching for?
No ...
Come on, Graeme.
- Way to go, Dirty Harry.
- You got that?
I ... did I catch you?
Oh my God, like a cold mechanic.
I think it's pretty obvious what happened there isn't it?
Is it?
The government used some kind of neoro toxic paint on the Black Mailbox.
Caused a shared hallucination about aliens, it makes complete sense.
Oh !...
You're dick is gone ...
Oh, no ...
What?
Come on, grow up ...
You guys seen my shorts?
How did you do that?
How did you go invisible?
Oh, it's camouflage response.
Well, like "Predator"?
Exactly, altough i can only do it while holding my breath.
You can do it anytime you want?
"Anytime".
That's just like it ...
Am I the only sane person here ?!
Eh ?!
It's allright for you, isn't it ?!
You'll go back to area 51 ...
... we'll be arrested for harboring a fugutive !
And sent to Guantanamo Bay !
Why don't I go make some bagels and coffee?
Leave you two alone.
What's the matter Clive?
There's an alien in the kitchen making bagels and coffee.
- Did you want tea?
- No, I don't want tea !
Right, because tea is weird in America, right?
They leave the baguette  ...
What's weird Graeme is that we picked up an extra terrestrial ...
... hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it !
Bagels and coffee ...
Uh ! Marmite ...
He said his life's in danger.
He needs our help, you know?
Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice.
What if we wake up and find him inserting a probe ...
... into our anus?
Apparently they don't do that.
Anyone, want one of these?
Eh, anyone?
Anyone?
Eh?
Coming, ready or not, you son of a bitch ...
Where's the other one?
I don't know sir.
Uh ...
Haggard !
Sorry, we were just ...
Haggard !
Fuck ...
Nice ... uh ...
Get over here ... it's the guy with the badge.
We were just playing hide and seek ...
... so we have a lot of time.
Hurry up.
I was hiding.
You have any traffic through here?
No, just a couple of hillbilly types.
Two nerdes in an RV.
Nerds, huh?
Yes, they've come from comic-con !
They've met Adam Shadowchild !
Who the hell is
Adam Shadowchild?
He ... he wrote Prison Hawk 441.
Ok? Jenny Starpepper and the Spinning Worm.
Right? Fluxing your anus.
You know you're grown man, right?
Probably shave, pay taxes?
Have pubic hair?
All of those things.
- Did you search that vehicle?
- Yes , sir.
What'd you find?
Uh, nothin' much, just ...
A book with a green woman with three...
- ... titties.
- Dude, it's three titties.
Three tits, that's awesome.
Oh, and some pissy jeans.
Close that.
Preexisting problem ...
Listen to me you freakin' fuck, i want to know everyting you ...
... can remember about the pissy nerds, ok?
We're leaving.
What about the road block, sir?
It didn't work.
Hey ! Rieces pieces !
Yes, thank you.
Heard there was a commotion on the road after Rachel.
Funny, I didn't hear that.
It must've been the boys out to paste.
Hey.
That's a bit much, isn't it?
- What?
- Put it all back !
What about Paul's "Rieces Pieces"?
Just hurry up !...
No, you go ahead.
Thank you.
- Is that beast outside yours?
- What?
What do you mean "beast"?
Your RV?
Oh, the, yes ...
The RV is ....
Where are you boys from?
England.
England.
I heard about England.
No guns.
- No, not many.
- No ...
Not really, just you know ...
Farmers ...
How are police supposed to shoot anybody?
- They don't ...
- They try not to.
Um, 20. Keep the change.
And give it to charity or something.
You're amazing, Graeme !
That cop didn't suspect a thing !
And Clive ...
You didn't pee you pants.
I don't like to be stick in the mud but ...
You're asking a lot from us, right?
We just met, we don't know where we're going, or why ...
You don't think we deserve an explanation?
Look ... the less you guys know the better.
I want you to have plausible deniability.
Let's just say, I spent a lot of time in that base thinking i was a guest ...
Turns out ... I was a prisoner.
But don't worry.
I got it all under ... Ah !!
Fuck, that made me jump.
Poor little thing.
I don't know, you could've done mate.
Ew ... What are you doin'?
Just watch ...
It's a miracle !
Man, I'm gonna miss these ...
What would you do that?
I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am I?
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time ...
Don't bring me down ... Oh guys !
Eleven o'clock,
Twelve o'clock ...
Come on, it's fun !
If you think about it, it's time travel ...
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock ...
Yes, all right !
Let me see, let me see.
No, just sit still ...
You gonna try me like one of your French girls, Jack?
I'm joking.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just don't make me look fat, ok?
- First gravity sats ass ...
- Paul !
Can I ask you a question?
Shoot !
Have you ever done that to a person?
Yes, I've eaten many people.
I'm joking big guy ! Relax ...
No, I mean you know, fix them.
Oh, no ! Not a dead person.
Recently dead bird, that's one thing ...
... dead person, whole other ball game.
It's actually really dangerous for me,
The damage can actually bounce back on to me ...
I'm sorry, am I boring you?
Have you heard this one before?
Are you tried saussage?
Don't call me that in front of him !
Are you tired though?
Eggie, I'm bushed !
You know what? We're all tired.
Let's just pull over and stop for the night.
We're fugutives Paul, all right?
I refuse to just ...
... sit around and wait around to get fingered by the Men in Black.
Look, we just gotta find somewhere quiet, and don't draw attention to ourselves.
But, where are we going, Paul?
Oh, you'll know it when you see it.
- Two white guys?
- Two, strange ...
Strange white guys, got it.
- Order anythig weird?
- Chocolate.
Chocolate, awkward.
Zoil, report.
We've tracked him into a gas station in Eli, he maybe travelling ...
... in an RV with two men from England.
New England?
Old England.
Creepy. What are they, MI6?
Negative, just couple of nerds in the lam from comic-con.
Something doesn't feel right.
I think he's getting help from the inside.
I want those nerds iced and that little green prick get back ...
... in his fishbowl or dead, ASAP.
I'm closing in, I can feel it.
In 24 hours he'll wish he never set foot on planet earth.
Okay.
Here we are, this is the place.
<b>THE PEARLY GATES</b>
Yeah, this looks good.
Doesn't look like anyone's been murdered here.
Awfully quiet.
Quiet is good, Graeme.
Quiet is our friend.
Hi there !
There's a girl outside ...
Okay.
We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the American Midwest.
I don't think she heard you.
I'm talking to you,
I'm talking to you.
Oh, sorry.
Hi.
I'm Ruth Buggs.
Good evening Ruth,
I am the writer Clive Gollings.

You know ...
You know ...
You guys, two guys ...
Aren't you getting me?
What you ...
- I don't know what you mean.
- Gay !  - No !!
Why do people keep saying that?
Nah, I'm just wondering ...
Totally cool, if you are.
Everyone's fine on my planet.
It's all about the pleasure thing.
You know I'm sayin'?
Why you here Paul?
Oh, I was on a science mission actually.
And then I had some spaceship related ... problems.
And I kinda ... crashed ...
Lucky for me though. This little girl, she pulls me out of the wreck ...
... next thing i know, guys arrive carv me up to the base.
What have you been doing here all this time?
You know ...
Getting back man, I've been shootin' the shit ...
- ... I've been advising the Government.
- Not just the Government ...
- You I wanna have some kind of a special power, you know?  - Yeah.
- Something messianic.
- Okay, Steven.
- Uh, how about cellular revelification?
- Yeah, I don't know what that is.
Oh, restoration of damaged tissiue through telephatic manipulation ...
- ... of a transit field memory.
- What's that mean?
- It means, "healing" Mr Spielberg.
- Yeah, right.  - It's ok.
Like by touch or something like that like ...
... maybe its finger lights up when he reaches out and touches.
Maybe, you know, somethimes
I find less is more.
Hey ... Trust me.
You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture over the last 60 years.
Agent Moulder was right.
- Agent Moulder was my idea !
- Really ?!
- Wow ...
- Yeah !
That's cool.
Honk that shit Earth-Man.
I like this song.
Harvard's my boy.
Come on.
Break it down a bit boys.
Don't be afraid.
Yeah, look at me, I'm breaking it down.
Use them tongs !
Get those tongs !
Stope the fire ...
Yes.
Ruth !! Prayers !
I don't know the rest of this song.
No one does.
Uhh, who's knocking?
Stop this.
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, shut up ...
I'll hide in here.
- Don't come out.
- Why would I come out?
- Who is it?
- It's Ruth.
Don't you dare opening that door ...
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Good morning.
May I come in?
- No.
- Yeah, Come on in.
- No, no, no.
- Make yourself at home.
Not really dressed.
So, where's the other one?
The other one?
It's just ...
Oh, oh, it's ok.
We don't charge by the person.
There were three shadows i saw dancing around the RV last night, right?
- The other one ...
- Oh ...
I'm in the can.
I ate a ...
... a closed pistachio.
I'm paying for it.
It's a nice t-shirt.
Oh thanks, I got it at my church.
"EVOLVE THIS"
- It's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin.
Why would Jesus wanna shoot Charles Darwin?
Because of his blasphemous theories?
Are you men of God?
We're men of science ...
You know, we believe in the ...
... establishment of a biological order through the maelstrom of physical ...
... and chemical chaos.
The world is 4000 years old and can only be the product of an intelligent design.
That's whoreshit !!
Um ... alright ...
Well then, please explain how something as complex as the human eye simply just comes into being?
Just come into being ?!
It's the combination of ...
... billions of years of development and cost countless species !
What are you talking about ?!
Evolution baby !!
Blasphemy !
- Blasphemy ?!  - Nothing that you can say can shake my beliefs. Perfect.
And the short and certain knowledge that
God made Heaven and Earth and ...
... created us all in his own image.
- His own image ?!
- Yeah ...
Well, I got a question ...
How do you explain me ?!
She's goin'. She's fallin'
Catch ...
And that's Jenga.
Why did you do that ?!
I ... just ... she fainted !
We've gone through this !
But we have to take her with us now !
- No ! No !
- What ...
This is America. Kidnapping a Christian, that's worse than harboring a fugutive.
Yeah, but she's seen you !
If we leave, she's gonna call the police !
No one's gonna believe this
God bothering cyclop ...
... let's just dump her on the road !
- Just roll her up on the road ...
- No, we can't risk that !
If we take us, then we can get her on our side.
Yeah, you'd love her to get her on our side, wouldn't you?
That doesn't make sense.
Look, she'll be fine.
We're quite nice !
All right. What about my passport?
Oh, God ... Guys.
"JESUS has the right of way"
Uh, no !!...
Hollings
Clive
British Subject
Oh, yes ...
Ruth, what in the Lord's name ...
Morning ...
Morn ...
Go, go, go, go, go !! ...
Oh fuck !
Shook yourself daemon !
Where are you ?!
Where are you ?!
Passport, passport !!
Jump, jump !!
What? That's actually small on my planet.
<b>FUCK YOU</b>
Um, Ruth?
Hello, Ruth.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Where am I?
Hey, look who's awake?
Daemon ! Daemon !
No, no, we're sorry, we're not gonna hurt you, i promise.
And we'll let you go as soon as we can.
You've been decieved by an agent of Satan himself.
He's evil !
I'm sitting right here, come on !
No, no, he's not evil.
He's just a bit rude.
We're trying to help him get home.
He's from another world.
There's only one world.
Our world !
The world that God, the father created !
Hey, if it makes feel any better, my existence only disproves ...
... the traditional notions of
Abraham and todays notion of Chrisian God.
As well as all thrology, that's all i meant.
Amazing Grace ...
... How sweet the sound ...
What is with you people ?!
Ruth, just listen to me for one second, if you could just calm down ...
I can't ... drive like this.
Fuck this !
What did you do to her ?!
I just transfered my collective knowledge and experience through her tactile psyscho connective bridge.

This is not the police's area of expertise Mr Buggs.
That devil took my doughter.
What do you mean "devil"?
And your doughters name is Ruth, is it?
That's right.
I brought her up by myself after her momma died.
Yeah, she's pretty easy to spot.
She's got this eye thing since she was 4 years old.
Do you have a phone here that your doughter might try to ...
... reach you at if she decides to call?
Yeah, in the back.
Hey, Peter Parker.
Wanna put the snappy down and get to the phone?
Right ...
She'll call me if she can.
You mentioned it when ...
Fuck you ...

By the way ...
Severe epiral membrane complicated by mecular deamon in your left  ventricilous cavity?

I don't know.
Just have a little faith, ok?
How did you do that?

Small corrections Paul, make small corrections.
Get to the right !!
Hey there sleepy face ...
Fuckaroo, that was the best titty farting sleep I've ever had.
Uh ... I gotta feeling that you're new to cursing Ruth ...
Look, cursing's fun, you just gotta pick your moments, ok?
Hey, maybe we should stop for some food, is anybody hungry?
Fuck yeah !

- You bet your big fat cock I am !
Nice !
I'm starvin' ...
What's new "fat hair" ?
It's not fat Paul, it's power.
- Fat power.  - It's rude.
- You're rude.
Maybe you should call my dad.
What ?!
What? Why?
I've been gona for a whole day, and if he calls the police ...
... they're gonna be looking for us.
If I don't there's a good chance that we all end up in Shit Butt City.
You're really getting the hang of this.
Thanks dick-milk.
The music is from
"Star Wars: Episode IV"
It won't be long.
Ok ... be ... be careful.
Ruth Buggs?
Yes?
Listen to me carefully.
I want you to tell me where you are.
Who is this?
My name is Agent Zoil and it's very important you tell me where you are ...
... and where you are headed Miss Buggs.
I ... I ... can't tell you.
I mean, I ... don't ... know.
You've been abducted. The individual that you're travelling with is highly dangerous.
Oh no, he's not dangerous.
I mean, he's kind of rude ...
He curses a lot ...
And a couple of times I've seen him scratch his ...
... space man ... balls.
Please listen to me. Your father is extremely worried about you ...
... and we'd like to get you home Miss Buggs.
He showed me things.
She's talking about his spaceman balls.
You know I'm just trying to help you, right Ruth?
I just ... I don't know what's real anymore, I'm confused ...
- We got the bitch !!

Yo fuck nuts !!
It's probin' time ...
Hah ! Only one of us fainted !
Oh, shit ! The 5-0, let's bounce !
I'm sorry. They answered the phone.
They knew about us.
Get in the RV ...
Come on, they're gonna wake up !
Sorry !
- Ok, we need to get off the road.
- Shouldn't we keep moving?
No, that is exactly what they'll expect us to do, trust me !
Only an idiot would stop right now !
- Yeah, pull in here, pull in here.
That's perfect.  - What ?!
- Paul ...
- We're idiots, remember?
What should we do now?
Well, how about hot chocolate and bed?
What are you, my grandma?
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
I'm too pumped.
Yeah, me too. Let's get some beers.
Find somewhere to chill.
What do you say?
What if someone sees you?
It's dead out there.
And I can do this ...
- Ok, I'm in.

Something i can help you, with?
Yeah, you mind telling me what happened here?
Uh ... just a good ol' fashioned beer soke slobber knocker.
See anything unusual?
Couple hillbilly types in the back of that meat wagon won't stop crying.
Did you gentlemen see anything unusual this evening?
Are we sure?
Thank you.
<b>FUCK YOU</b>
- It's a nice window.
- This is the little cowboy, isn't it?
I'll tell you, tell you, that's just funny.
It was when you kiss me yesterday.
- Sorry.
- No.
I was like, "Girl for you rapists !"
Do it again if you like.
What?
Said, you can do it again if you like.
Really?
If you're gonna try it, then maybe you should do it with a friend, you know ...
... rather than some stranger, because, there's a lot weirdos out there.
Oh, I am planning on doing a lot of kissing ...
... and fornicating so ...
... you'd really be helping me out.
Great.
Wh ... what ... do you mean now?
- I tought, ...
- Yeah, I did but ...
We could, let's do it now.
- I mean,
- Yeah.
Um, my hands on you ...
Staying here ...
Hold steady ...
Fuck ! I'm sorry.
I tought I was gonna pass out ...
Carry on ...
- How's that mate?
- Nothin' nothin', just hangin' around.
They were about to make out.
It was awkward ! ...
We were just ...
Good ...
Please put your shorts on Paul.
You guys partake?
No, thank you.
I'll partake.
Are you sure?
It's pretty strong shit.
I got it from the military actually.
This is the stuff that killed Dylan.
Bob Dylan is not dead.
Isn't he?
Hit me.
Ok, just ... you know ... go easy on it.
Ruth ...
A little bit, a little bit.
It's not so bad.
To be fair, it takes a while to be absorbed in.
Oh, shit ...
I'm hungry. We should cook up some saussages.
Do we have any saussages?
What do you mean by that?
Why do you guys hate me?
Can we go cook up some saussages?
Oh, I have waspes in my brain !
She'll be fine ...
That happened to me the first time.
Paul ...
I was gonna ask ... you know us right?
Yeah, Graeme we're like modified BFF.
Why are you in such a hurry to leave now?
Well, according to the Government,
I fulfilled my usefulness.
I told them eveything I know, the only thing I've left off for them now ...
... are my abilities.
The healing, the thought transfer, the camouflage.
In order to cultivate those abilities, they need some of my stem cells.
And I'm not really down with that.
Lucky for me, I do have one friend left on the inside.
So, a man should get
SOS a beamed into space ...
... I got my people primed and ready to pick me up.
Then, motherfuckers brought the procedure forward by a day ...
... and my whole plan goes to shit !
What happened?
The way at the labs?
I zapped my ass, I stole his car
I took off.
Found you guys.
So what happends if you get cought?
Graeme ...
They're gonna cut out my brain.
Oh ...
Yeah, it's fucked.
It's kind of a buzzkill.
Let's lighten the mood shall we ...

Oh, hmm ...

Cops are standing down, you better spin your ass around.

Holy shit ! Moorcroft's on the 14th.
You don' think uh ...
Son of a bitch is going back.
He's gonna find that contact.
We got him, Zoil. Bring me back my space monkey, and I'll ...

Great, betther parking space.
I don't know man. I don't know, he looks awful mad.
Fuck him. He's a dinosaur.
It's time for some new blood.
Welcome to
MOORCROFT
Ok, we're nearly there.
This is where we've been headed?
No, I ... I just need a little stop first, ok?
Do you think we really got time to be making little stops Paul?
This is something
I really have to do.
Ok, stop here, that's good.
That's close enough.
Shouldn't we park a bit closer?
No ...
We don't wanna scare her.
Scare who?
- You knock.  - You knock.
- I always knock.
Who's there ?!
Uh ... Is that Tara Walton?
Leave me alone !
Miss Walton !
My name is Clive Gollings !
I'm here with my friend
Mr Graeme Willy !
Now, what do you want?
We're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago.
Let's go, let's just go.
What is this, some kind of a joke ?!
Hey Tara !
You ...
It's a very loud clock, isn't it?
You have a nerve showing your face here.
All these years ...
Maybe I should make some tea.
I'll do it.
Huh, ok.
Uh, look, Tara I ...
I only just stopped believing in you, you know?
I've spent a very long time trying to ...
... convince folks about what happened that night.
Everyone said I was mad !
They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul.
They said that I was concussed hallucinating ...
... but I knew you were real !
I pulled you from that spaceship myself.
I kept you warm and comfartable and sat there ...
... with you 'til the men came to take you away.
Well, word got out about my story.
Kids used to come and throw stones at the house.
Call me names.
Then, I just hid myself away.
I spent whole nights up staring at the sky hoping ...
... that I catch a glimpse of you.
And here you are.
Um, I'm sorry, you know if I could've done it any other way ...
Oh, it's ok.
You're real.
That's all that matters.
I was sure of it.
And all those folks that ...
... said I was crazy, they can all go and fuck themselves.
I brought something for you.
I thought you might want it back.
Uh, here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Who do you suppose that is?
Where did that come from ?!
Holy shit, it's them !!

Wasn't that really really dangerous?
Sometimes ... you just gotta roll the dice.
It's a miracle !
The Lord has delivered his healing hand ...
Can't live with these people.
Sorry you got killed by my dad.
That's fine.
Do you wanna try to kiss again?
Fuck yeah.

Oh, it looks good.
- That's a nice one of you.
- Thank you.
Mr Buggs?
It's been a hell of a ride, huh?
Sorry I frightened the shit out of you.
You didn't frighten me, you freed me.
I'm glad.
Hmm, that's nice.
Thanks.
Hey, take care of her big man.
Oh, I will sir.
And God be with you.
Yeah, whatever dude.
Say bye to Karen for me.
Safe trip short round.
Thanks.
Oh, you're coming with me.
What? ...
I ruined you life, Tara.
I think it's only right, I give you one.
But, I don't have my toothbrush.
Baby, where we're goin' ...

That's right, ran on.
Get in there girl.

Gentlemen ...

Uh, i kinda find it hard to finish.
To be honest.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Keep it with the journey home if you like.
Oh, yeah, I'll definetaly.
3 tits.
Awesome !
Well, safe to say we've all learned something from ...
... this. Be yourselves, speak from your hearts, some shit like that ...
Yeah, I certainly feel a bit different.
And me ...
Thank you guys.
No, thank you.
Yeah, thanks Paul.
Hugs?
Clive, I can feel you boner.
Till next time.
It's cool, isn't it?
It's amazing !
Goodbye !!
Goodbye !!
This ship takes off very slowly, It's a little awkward.
Goodbye !
Can't you do it any faster, come on !!
That was good, wasn't it?

Award winnning best seller.
By the way, these are friends of mine.
I'm very proud of you Graeme.
I'm very proud of you Saussage.
Come on.
Pat Stevens. Like
Pat Stevens from Chapter One?
The very same.
I always pictured you taller.
Well, you'll see me standing up.
Oh, I'd like that.
I didn't realise you were still damn pretty.
You can see mr out of these crazy clothes.
I'd like that.
I can't.

Mother, what are you...
I thought you were a burglar.
I didn't mean to scare you, darling,
I was just getting a snack.
Go back to bed.
What's the matter?
Go on, back to bed.
I'll make you hot chocolate.
Who are you?
And what have you done with my mother?
My mother has never set foot in this kitchen in her life.
And she certainly wouldn't get me hot chocolate.
Unless she kept ordering me to do it.
You're not scared of me?
I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world.
The only person who is...
...different.
And here you are, Charles Xavier.
Raven.
You're hungry, and alone?
Take whatever you want.
We've got lots of food, you don't have to steal.
In fact...
...you never have to steal again.
Understand this, Erik.
These Nazi's, I'm not like them.
Genes are the key, yes...
But their goals?
Blue eyes, Blond hair, Pathetic.
Eat the chocolate.
It's good.
Want some?
I want to see my Mama.
Genes are the keys that unlocks the door to a new age, Erik.
A new future for mankind.
Evolution.
You know what I'm talking about?
It's a simple thing I ask of you.
A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate.
Is it?
I tried, Herr Doctor...
I can't... I don't...
It's impossible.
The one thing I can say for the Nazi's, is their methods seem to produce results.
I'm sorry, Erik.
Mama!
My darling.
How are you?
Here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to count to three...
...and you're going to move the coin.
You don't move the coin, I pull the trigger.
Understand?
One...
- Mama!
- You can do it.
Two...
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right!
Three.
Yes, wonderful!
Excellent!
Outstanding, Erik!
So we unlock you're gift with anger.
Anger and pain.
You and me, we're going to have a lot of fun together.
Hetero-chromia.
A gentlemen would at least offer to buy me a drink first.
Newman, a pint of bitter for me and a brandy for the lady, please.
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.
The name's, Xavier, Charles Xavier.
- How do you do...
- Amy.
Heterochromia, is reference to your eyes, which I have to say are stunning.
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.
It's a very groovy mutation.
I have news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.
First you proposition a girl, and then you call her deformed.
How is that seduction tactic working for you?
I'll tell you in the morning.
No, no.
Seriously, you must knock it.
Mutation's go from single cell organisms to being the dominate form of reproductive life.
On this planet, infinite forms of variations with each generation all through mutation.
Then let's reclaim that word.
- Mutant, and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.
I'm sorry, one cola.
Charles here was just telling me that I'm like one of the first sea creatures... that grew legs.
Tiny bit sexier.
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.
- Hi, Amy.
- And what do you study?
Waitressing.
Oh look, you have hetero-chromia too!
- Say, what?
- Look at her eye...
Right, Raven get your coat please.
Don't talk to me, you did that on purpose.
- I did not!
- Yes you did!
Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.
When I'm stressed or tired..
You seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now.
"Mutant and proud"
Why is it always the pretty mutations, or the invisible ones like yours.
If you're a freak, better hide.
You're being ridiculous!
Look, I don't mean to sound like an old fart.
Which you are.
Sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.
"Mutant and proud"
"Mutant and proud"?
If only...
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.
Any man would be lucky to have you.
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?
Like, you...what?
Blue?
You're my oldest friend.
I'm your only friend.
Thank you for that.
Well?
I'm incapable of even thinking of you like that,
I feel responsible for you.
Anything else would just feel wrong.
But what if you didn't know me?
Unfortunately I do know you.
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.
I'm sleepy. Will you read to me?
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.
Well fine, read about your thesis it always sends me right off.
To Homo neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin Homo sapiens, was an aberration.
Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed, was short lived.
Records show, without exception that the arrival of the mutated human species in any region was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.
Possession of that gold is illegal.
I should inform the police.
Let's not play this game.
- Where did you get it?
- A Friend.
He recommended your bank, most highly.
I see.
Do you know our terms, sir?
Yes.
And you should know mine.
This gold is what remains of my people.
Melted from their possessions.
Torn from their teeth.
This is blood money.
And you're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it.
Don't touch that alarm.
I want Schmidt, Klaus Schmidt.
Where is he?
Our clients don't supply addresses, we're not...
Not that sort of bank?
Metal fillings, eh, not gold.
Worried someone might steal them?
Argentina!
Schmidt is in Argentina!
Villa Gesell! Please, please!
Thank you.
I would love to kill you.
So mark my words, if you warn anyone, I'm coming...
...I will find you.
Another day at the office.
Is that Colonel Hendry?
- The NATO guy?
- Yeah.
Yes, it is.
Cause that's three mob bosses, the Italian ambassador, the CEO of Lockheed.
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.
Do you see that? Hello, girls!
Wow, very nice.
Wha...what are you doing?
Here's things that the CIA didn't give me.
Stay put.
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.
Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw's associate.
And where is, Mr. Shaw?
We're having a party, and here's the entertainment.
Come with me.
Hello beautiful, how are you?
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?
I am so sorry. I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.
Excuse me.
- Are you sure we can't get a refill, Bob?
- No.
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
I expect you to reconsider.
We've had this conversation.
You put our nukes in Turkey, or anywhere that close to Russia, and you're looking at war. Nuclear war.
I didn't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.
The only thing I will reconsider, is having another glass of that delicious champagne.
What the hell did you put in my drink?
You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.
There's not a fortress in the world that can keep us out.
Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?
Genetic mutation, the evolution of the human genome.
Where's Azazel?
Ah, we don't want the Colonel to be late.
Come here.
Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.
We ever decided to fire them, the Russians early warning system won't even have time to kick in.
This better be important, MacTaggert
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there, McCone, in the Hellfire club.
Colonel Hendry?
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.
And I now believe that we should put Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.
Colonel Hendry is here.
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop wasting my time.
Looks like Hendry wants to start World War III.
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.
Sir, I...!
Have you lost your mind?
So, now what?
We find an expert on Genetic Mutation.
Professor of genetics, Charles Francis Xavier.
So, how does it feel to be a professor?
Well, ah, don't call me that.
You don't get to be called a Professor until you actually have a teaching position.
I know, but it suits you.
No, don't say that, do say "Lets go have a drink".
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful!
Good evening, my friends!
Good evening!
- Hot, no?
- Yes...
One beer, please.
- German beer?
- Of course.
Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?
The best.
What brings you to Argentina?
The climate, I'm a pig farmer.
Tailor, since I was a boy.
My father made the finest suits in Dusseldorf.
My Parents were from, Dusseldorf.
What was their name?
They didn't have a name.
It was taken away from them...
...by pig farmers...
...and tailors.
"Blood and Honor".
Which would you care to shed first?
- We were under orders.
- Blood then.
- Freeze, asshole!
- Come on, shoot!
Who, what are you?
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.
I'm looking for my creator.
Drink, drink, drink!
Oh,  I'm so proud of you.
I need another drink,and you need another cola
Congratulations, Professor!
Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually.
No, on your presentation.
You knew my presentation?
How nice of you, thank you very much.
Moira MacTaggert.
Charles Xavier.
Do you have a minute?
For a pretty little beam with a mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.
I say, MCR-1, you would say, golden hair.
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.
Mutation you know, took us from single cell organisms, to the dominate form...
You know what, this routine may go over great with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.
What?
I really need your help.
All right.
The kind that of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis
I need to know if they may already have happened.
In people alive today.
Professor?
I think that we should just talk when you're sober.
Do you have any time tomorrow?
Something tells me, you already know the answer to your question.
This is very important to me.
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.
Thank you.
Still drinking champagne, Bob?
I will pass.
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.
I was wondering, who you told about our little arrangement?
No one.
He's telling the truth.
Good.
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?
Well I knew better than to trust you.
Now you let me walk out of here with my money.
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.
Go ahead, pull it.
I'll do it, I swear to god.
No you won't.
But I will.
You're one of them?
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.
That's the boring part.
The fun stuff is what I can do with it once I got it.
The advent of the nuclear age, may have accelerated the mutation process.
Individual's with extraordinary abilities may already be among us.
Thank you very much.
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist is going to make me believe in sparkly dames and vanishing men?
You just brought yourself a one way ticket back to the typing pool.
This meeting is over.
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.
I didn't really expect you to believe me.
Given that all you could think about during my presentation, was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.
It's apple pecan.
I haven't been entirely honest with you, and I'm sorry.
You see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do, is that I can read your mind.
I've seen this before in a magic show.
Are you going to ask us to think of a number between one and ten now?
No, agent Stryker.
Although I could ask you about your son William who you were thinking about, which is very nice.
But I think I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!
I did not, I would never bring one here!

How's that for a magic trick?
Best I've ever seen.
I want them out of here.
And lock down until I can figure out what to do.
My facility is off site. I'll take them.
I can't believe this.
You'd think the director of the CIA would have a little more composure.
We should be going after Shaw right now, but instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.
What are we doing to do, Lavene?
Lavene? Lavene, what's wrong with you?
Absolutely nothing,
I've just frozen him for the moment because I'd like to talk to you.
It's good, isn't it?
I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,
And if you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage.
I've always known that there were people like you out there.
I've been the laughing stock of this agency for years but I knew it.
You're going to love my facility.
That's going to have to wait.
Why?
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw, and if we don't move now apparently we're going to loose him.
What?
Not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well.
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.
Yes, we did.
That is incredible!
But I cannot take you anywhere else, without permission from upstairs.
Would you like to see one more magic trick?
Okay.
Get in the car.
Good idea.
Herr Doctor.
Little Erik Lensherr.
He's here to kill you.
What kind of greeting is that?
After all these years?
Emma.
We don't harm our own kind.
Ah, now it's a party.
This is the US Coast guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.
Stay where you are.
They have a telepath.
I've lost, Shaw!
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.
There's, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.
I think there's someone like me on that ship.
Like you?
I'm sorry, a telepath.
This is incredible,
I can actually feel her inside my mind.
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be much help to you tonight.
You're on your own.
- Oh my god.
- Jesus.
Get inside.
Stop, stop, stop!
Charles! You okay?
There's someone else out there.
There!
Time to go.
Let go!
Better let it go!
You've got help him... there's someone in the water, help him!
Let it go! You have to let it go!
You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.
I know what this means to you but you're going to die.
Please, Erik, calm your mind.
Get off of me, get off!
- Calm down, please.
- We're here!
Who are you?
Professor Charles Xavier.
You were in my head.
How did you do that?
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you, just calm your mind.
I thought I was alone.
You're not alone.
Erik, you're not alone.
Welcome to my facility.
My mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers for military defense.
Or offense.
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever you want to call him.
He's working with the Russians.
We might need your help to stop them.
Marvelous.
So we're to be the CIA's new mutant division, yes?
Something like that.
It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane ever built.
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.
Hank, these are the special new recruits I was telling you about.
This is, Hank McCoy, one of our most talented young researchers.
How wonderful, another mutant. Already here.
Why didn't you say?
Say what?
Because you don't know.
I am so, so terribly sorry!
Hank?
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.
So your mutation's what?
You're super smart?
I'll say, Hank here graduated honors at the age of fifteen.
I wish that's all it was.
You're among friends now, Hank.
You could show off.
Splendid.
- Sorry.
- Yes, yes.
You're amazing.
Really?
The presence of U.S. Missiles in Turkey represents an unprecedented threat to the people of the Soviet Union.
Warned Russian Mister Gromeko, earlier today
But he was quick to insist the Russians would not be the first to initiate any military action.
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as we get to Russia.
Unless the CIA finds us first.
I'll take care of them too.
If that telepath gets inside your head, he won't be as much fun as I am.
Already in hand, my love.
The Russians made me this.
So, what am I thinking?
I don't know.
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing that I've ever seen in my life.
And that this needs ice.
Fetch me some.
There's a good girl.
I, I promised myself I'd find a cure, ever since I was a little boy.
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...
- normal.
- Normal.
Charles has never understood.
He's different, but he's never had to hide. it doesn't affect abilities, right?
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.
Yeah.
Do you think it would work on me?
I can look into it, if you'd like.
That's the least I can do after asking you to come down here to listen to a weird request.
I have to admit, usually when guys ask me out they're not after my blood.
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.
You know, the nature of your mutation.
If any genes hold the key to changing appearance, it's yours.
Hank, you aren't being forward, that's kinda what I meant.
No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
And I'm sorry that you weren't.
Go ahead, take the blood.
Sorry, did I hurt you?
Kinky!
By the way, if I looked like you, I wouldn't change a thing.
What I know about you,
I'm surprised you managed to stay this long.
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.
Then know to stay out of my head.
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what Shaw did to you.
I felt your agony.
I can help you.
I don't need your help.
Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.
It's not just me you're walking away from.
Here you have the chance to be a part of something much bigger than yourself.
I won't stop you leaving,
I could.
But I won't.
Shaw's got friends.
You could do with some.
Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter.
It's designed to amplify brain waves, so it could enhance your telepathic powers.
Help us find other mutants for our division.
I thought they'd all been found by you.
Erik!
You decided to stay.
If a new species is being discovered, it should be by its own kind.
Charles and I find the new mutants, no suits.
First of all, that's my machine out there.
Second of all, and much more importantly, this is Charles decision.
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved. Isn't that right?
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.
We'll find them alone.
What if I say no?
Then good luck using your installation without me.
I call it, Cerebro.
- Isn't that Spanish for "Brain"?
- Yes.
Okay so, the electrodes connect Charles to the transmitter on the roof.
And picks up a mutant.
His brain sends a signal through a relay.
And then the co-ordinates of their location are printed out here.
You designed this?
Yeah.
What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
Don't spoil this for me, Erik.
I've been a lab rat,
I know one when I see one.
Okay, right
Are you sure we can't shave your head?
Don't touch my hair.
It's working!
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.
You cat's know it's double for both, right?
No, that won't be necessary.
Although I sure we...
We were thinking more, we're show you ours,
...if you show us yours.
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.
More tea, Vicar?
Don't mind if I do.
My turn.
How would you like a job, where you get to keep your clothes on?
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?
No we were rather hoping that you would take us all the way.
That's a six hour drive.
That will give us plenty of time to talk.
What the hell does the government want with a guy like, Alex Summers?
I hope you don't plan on putting him with others.
First guy I ever met who actually prefers solitary confinement.
- Crazy, huh?
- What?
You like fish, I like fish too.
Maybe we should bide some time and talk about it.
I'd rather go out with the fish.
These fish?
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lensher.
- Charles Xavier.
Go fuck yourselves.
- There's nothing on radar?
- No.
- Sonar?
- No.
Then we have a problem.
Beautiful, isn't it?
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.
We have a situation.
The telepath...
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.
It's like his reach is...
...amplified.
They're recruiting.
You go on to Russia, I'll handle him.
I can't stop thinking about the others out there.
All those minds that I've touched.
I could feel them, their aspirations, their hopes, their ambitions.
I tell you, we've started something incredible, Erik.
- We can help them.
- Can we?
Identification, that's how it starts.
Then ends with being rounded up.
Experimented on, eliminated.
I know the story.
We have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians they need us.
For now.
We should think of code names.
We're government agents now, we should have secret code names.
I want to be called, Mystique.
Damn, I wanted to be called, Mystique.
Well tough, I called it.
Damn wang, mysterious to you.
Darwin, what about you?
Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.
Check this out.
Thank you, thank you.
Bravo, bravo.
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...
...Banshee.
Why do you want to be names after a wailing spirit?
You might want to cover your ears.
Your turn.
My stage name is Angel. Kind of fits.
- You can fly?
- Ah, hah. And uh...
What's your name?
How about Big Foot?
Well you know what they say about guys with big feet?
And uh, yours are kind of small.
Okay, now.
Alex, what is your gift? What can you do?
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.
I can't do it in here.
Can you do it out there?
Why don't you just do it out there.
Come on. Come on, Alex.
Alex! Alex!
That's the spirit.
Get down when I tell you.
Get back.
Get back!
Whatever...
We've got Intel that Shaw is meeting with the Russian defense chief in Moscow.
So go ahead, say it.
I'm not here to say "I told you so", you know why I'm here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring along your mutants.
Fight fire with fire.
Makes sense.
Wait, you're okay with this?
Sending in a bunch of untrained unauthorized freaks?
These "Freaks" are dedicated hard working people.
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.
I'm telling you these kids are not ready for, Shaw.
I think they're going to surprise you.
They are an exceptional bunch of young people.
What the hell?
Harder!
Harder!
What are you doing?
- Who destroyed the statue?
- It was, Alex.
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok. That's his name now.
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X
And you should be, Magneto.
Exceptional.
I expect more from you.
We got a problem.
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right.
Now listen to me..
Where are you going?
To our farm.
Open the back.
As you wish, as you wish.
Oh, easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps.
Anything back there?
Nothing, it's empty.
- Everything's okay?
- Yes.
- Where's Shaw?
- Emma.
She's a telepath, if I read her, she'll know we're here.
Let me try something else.
Shaw sends his apologies, but he's indisposed.
He asked me to come in his place.
But between you and I honey, I'm a lot better company.
Please come in.
He's not coming.
So, what now boss?
Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
- Mission aborted.
- The hell it is.
- Erik.
- She's his right hand woman.
That's good enough for me.
The CIA invading the home of a senior Soviet official.
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.
Erik!
To your health.
So you must be busy planning your next move.
What with the American's refusing to remove their missiles from Turkey.
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.
Emma.
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.
He's going to start world war III single handed.
- We have to do something.
- Like what?
- We're moving out.
- You can't.
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.
For goodness sake, Erik...
Be calm.
Be calm. Forget my face. Yes.
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.
Pathetic.
Nice trick.
Who are you?
Go to sleep.
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.
You're never going to get anything from me while I'm like this.
So then you can just tell us.
Where is Shaw?
Erik.
Erik, that's enough.
Erik, that's enough!
All yours.
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

We are the children of the atom.
Radiation gave birth to mutants.
What will kill the humans, will only make us stronger.
Beautiful, isn't it?
This is worse that we previously imagined.
We're taking you with us.
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.
Might be other things to worry about right now.
Whoa, all right.
Jesus, man you are killing me.
Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.
Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot. let's go.
Hey, hey come on, hey.
They're just guys being stupid.
Guy's being stupid I can handle.
I can handle that my whole life.
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys staring at me with my clothes off, then the way these one stare at me.
At us.
What was that?
I don't know, but something doesn't feel right.
- No news of Shaw?
- Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.
What is that?
We have an intruder on the main atrium.
Where are the mutants?
Take another step, I'm going to put you down.
Of course you will, but where do I find the more evolved people?
Send back-up now!
Get back, get back, do not leave that room. We're under attack.
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!
Where are the mutants?
Put that man down or we will open fire.
Stay here my ass.
 Let's go!
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!
Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.
Just let us normal people go.
We're no...
Where's the telepath?
- Not here.
- Too bad.
Now I can take this silly thing off.
Good evening My name is, Sebastian Shaw.
And I am not here to hurt you.
Freeze!
Azazel...
My friends, there's a revolution coming.
When mankind discovers who we are, what we can do.
Each of us will face a choice.
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us, then by definition you are against us.
So, you can stay, and fight for the people who hate, and fear you.
Or you can join me. And live like kings.
And Queens.
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?
Come on, we don't belong here.
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
We have to do something.
Stop, I'm coming with you.
Good choice.
So tell me about your mutation.
Well, I adapt to survive.
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.
- Alex, do it!
- Get down!
Protecting your fellow, mutants?
It's a noble gesture. Feels good.
Adapt to this.
Hello.
Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA.
These American's are ruthless.
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.
I expect you'll be planning new missile sites of your own.
Somewhere where you know the American early warning system won't help.
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.
And so close to Florida.
Missiles in Cuba?
You're serious?
We may as well declare war.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
You will make this happen.
Okay.
Let's see what KGB think about this.
Hello, General Armivolkoff.
It's nothing.
Raven.
We've made arrangements for you to be taken home immediately.
- We're not going home.
- What?
He's not going back to prison.
They killed Darwin.
All the more reason for you to leave.
This is over.
Darwin is dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.
We can avenge him.
Erik, word please.
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.
Shaw has his army, we need ours.
We'll have to train. All of us.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
Well we can't stay here.
Even if they reopen the department, it's not safe.
We've got no where to go.
Yes, we do.
The law says we've got to turn her over.
The law applies to human beings.
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.
Times like this, security is more important than liberty.
- There's a war coming, John.
- Yes, but a war with who?
Excellent question.
Though I won't call it a war exactly.
That suggests both sides stand an equal chance of winning.
Captain, no sign of any American ships.
Maintain course, full ahead.
The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.
Our fleet can be on this line, when the Russian missile ship arrives.
If that ship crosses the line, they will have declared war against the United States.
We will have no choice but to retaliate with a full nuclear response.
Do we agree?
Dispatch the Seventh fleet.
This is yours?
No, it's ours.
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.
Living in such hardship.
Well it was a hardship softened by me.
Come on, time for the tour.
Dear comrades.
The United States have dispatched war ships for Cuba.
This leaves us with no choice.
Comrade First Secretary.
We must send in our fleet.
Dispatch the fleet!
President Kennedy has signed a formal proclamation.
Setting up a blockade of all missiles, armed for Cuba.
The Soviet Union reacted by terming it as step along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
Hold it.
No, I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't shoot anybody point blank, let alone my friend.
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.
You're always telling me I should push myself.
If you know you can deflect it, then you're not challenging yourself.
What ever happened to the man who was trying to raise a submarine?
What, I can't.
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.
No, the anger isn't enough.
It's gotten the job done all this time.
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.
Hey, come here.
Let's try something a little more challenging.
My step-father took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously.
This way.
That's why he had this bunker built down here.
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?
No, he had this place built to with stand a nuclear bomb.
I think it can handle you, Alex.
You know when I do this, bad things tend to happen.
It's because you can't control it.
It controls you.
That's why we're here, Alex.
To start your training.
What you're doing is incredible.
You're hitting a pitch sound that at the same resonate frequency of the glass.
That's why it shatters.
This is like any other muscle in the body.
You can control it.
"In each of us, two natures are at war."
Robert Louis Stevenson, "Jekyll and Hyde".
Top marks.
Still it really wasn't really about good and evil.
Was it, Hank.
It was about man's animal nature, and his struggle to control it.
To conform.
It is that struggle which is holding you back.
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.
You are too.
If you're serious about me doing this, you might want to get back.
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.
Whenever you're ready.
My god.
I will teach you to control this, Alex.
You're sure that this will work.
Anything is possible.
I based the design...
Hank, stop talking. Come on.
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.
Catch them at the right angle, and they should carry you.
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.
Good luck.
And don't forget to scream.
If you want to beat me this time, you have to set the beast free.
On your marks, get set...GO!
Oh, congratulations, my friend.
Robert Louis Stevenson would have been proud.
Impressive, Hank.
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.
Right, Bozo?
I'm done here.
Thank you, Alex
Come on, Hank.
If you're using half the concentration to look normal.
Then you're only half paying attention to whatever else you do.
Just pointing out something that could save your life.
You want society to accept you.
But you can't even accept yourself.
Sexy.
This is just the prototype.
The real will look considerably better, it'll be a whole suit.
See these sensors measure your energy output, this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.
All right try hitting the one in the middle, just the one in the middle, mind.
Good luck.
You ought to see this.
Your genes are extraordinary, you know that.
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.
When you're forty you will still have the looks of a teenager.
You have the most incredible cellular structure I've ever seen.
You truly believe I'll fly this time?
Unreservedly.
- I trust you.
- The task.
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.
I'm going to die!
All right, look, we're not going to make you do anything that your not so...
- Here, let me help him.
- Erik!
What?
You know you were thinking the same.
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right, Alex, I want you to hit the X.
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.
I have complete and utter faith in you.
Am I still a Bozo?
Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.
But nice job.
See that?
Try turning it to face us.
You know, I believe the true focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity.
Would you mind, if I...?
What did you just do to me?
I accessed the brightest corner of your memory system.
It's a very beautiful memory, Erik, thank you.
I didn't know I still had that.
There's so much more to you than you know.
Not just pain, and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.
And when you can access all that.
You will possess a power no one can match.
Not even me.
So, come on. Try again.
Well done.
The President is about to make his address.
It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile,
...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba, as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.
Requiring a full retaliatory response, upon the Soviet Union.
That's where we're going to find, Shaw.
How do you know?
Two super powers facing off, and he want's to start world war III.
He won't leave anything to chance.
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good nights sleep.
...ultimately leads to war.
Tensions mount as the Soviet Missile ship nears Cuba.
All diplomatic efforts to avert Nuclear war have thus far failed.
As the American people ready themselves, for the likelihood of an atomic attack.
There are widespread reports of panic wide.
Supermarkets cleared.
As shelters unused since the second world war, are stocked for what may lie ahead.
In all its history, American has never faced a greater threat.
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.
Come in.
Got a surprise for you.
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.
The serum works like an anti-biotic.
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.
It won't affect your abilities, just your appearance.
Do you still want to do this?
Should we have to hide?
You already do.
You're hiding right now.
Like I have my whole life.
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.
Yeah.
Hank, don't.
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.
Look at all of us.
Look at all we've achieved this week.
All we will achieve.
We are different.
But we shouldn't be trying to fit into society.
Society should inspire and be more like us.
Mutant, and proud.
It behooves me to tell you, but even if we save the world tomorrow.
And mutants are accepted into society.
My feet and your natural blue form.
Will never be deemed beautiful.
You look beautiful now.
We need this cure.
Cuba,Russia,America,makes no difference.
Shaw's declared war on mankind, on all of us.
He has to be stopped.
I'm not gonna stop Shaw.
I'm gonna kill him.
Do you have it into all of that ?
You've known that all along why I was here, Charles.
But things have changed.
What started as a covert mission,
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.
They'll fear us, and that fear will turn to hatred.
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent Shaw.
Not if we risk our lives doing so.
Would they do the same for us?
We have it in us to be the better man.
We already are.
We're the next stage of human evolution.
- You said it yourself.
- Enough.
Are you really so naive as to think they won't battle their own extinction?
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry.
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us.
And you're blind to it, because you believe they're all like Moira.
And you believe they're all like Shaw.
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.
Peace was never an option.
No.
No.
Well...
This is a surprise.
The nice kind?
No, Raven, why don't you go to bed.
Maybe in a few years.
How about now?
I prefer the real Raven.
I said the real, Raven.
Perfection.
Could you pass me my robe?
You don't have to hide.
Have you ever looked at a tiger, and thought you'd want to cover it up?
No, but...
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.
Only in life the world tries to tame you.
It's time for you to be free.
You know sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like.
If you hadn't found me here that night.
Fairable, E..Gah...ah.
For gods sake, Raven!
Where are you clothes?
Put some, put some clothes on.
That's not what you said when you first saw me.
But I guess pets are always cuter when they're little, right?
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.
I thought you'd be in a good mood.
Hank tells me he's found the answer to your cosmetic problem.
You going to tell me what's the matter?
Or will I have to read your mind?
You promised me you would never do that.
Until recently, I never had to use my powers to know what you were thinking, Raven.
You know Charles, I used to think it was gonna be you and me against the world.
And no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you?
You want to be a part of it.
What the hell happened here?
Hank has been busy.
Do we really have to wear these?
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force, or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.
Where's Hank?
I'm here.
Hank?
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.
It didn't work.
Yes, it did, Hank.
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.
This is you.
No more hiding.
Never looked better, man.
Hank!
Don't mock me.
Hank, put him down immediately, please.
Hank...HANK!
I wasn't.
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.
I think I got a new name for you, Beast.
You sure you can fly this thing?
Of course I can, I designed it.
Status of the cargo ship?
Bearing 1-8-0, 12 knots.
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.
God help them if they cross it.
God help us all.
Sound general quarters.
General quarters, general quarters.
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes, sir.
Set condition zero.
General quarters, battle stations.
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?
I've lived through one war, comrade.
I'd prefer not to start another.
Battle stations, NOW!
Gun boss, target cargo ship, bearing 1-8-0.
Fleet reports all weapons ready.
From the Kremlin, sir.
New orders.
As of 1025 hours, the cargo vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.
Aral Sea, come in.
Aral Sea, come in.
They are not responding.
She's not turning around.
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
Do not cross the line.
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.
Looks pretty messy out there.
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.
He's still here, somewhere.
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.
That ship crosses the line, our boys are going to blow it up.
And the war begins.
Unless they're not on board.
USS Independence, this is, Alexander Nevski.
We have lost control of our cargo ship.
She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.
Repeat, do not fire.
They've signaled their cargo ship to turn around, sir.
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.
Five...four...
Hold on! Hold on!
No!
- What was that?
- The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.
A little warning next time, professor.
Sorry about that.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Son of a...
Give me Sinclar on the horn, I want a new set of orders.
Congratulations, comrade.
You just averted a Nuclear war.
What?
Take him to the brig.
What? What just happened?
They say the comrade lost his mind.
The Americans' are plotting.
They're here.
That telepath is powerful.
We're moving to a back-up plan.
That was inspired, Charles.
Thank you very much.
But I still can't locate Shaw.
He's down there, we need to find him now.
Hank?
- Is there anything unusual on the radar scanners?
- No, nothing.
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.
Yes we do.
Yes we do.
They were ready for war.
We just need to strike another match to light the fuse.
And we still have the most powerful weapon of all.
Me.
Turn the nuclear reactor to
100% output and make sure I'm not disturbed.
Hank, level the bloody plane!
Whoa, you back right off.
Beast, open the Bombay doors.
Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.
On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cams off.
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.
You ready for this?
Let's find out.
Remember, the point between rage and serenity.
Erik, take my hand!
Hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.
Erik, take my hand!
Down.
Moira, Moira, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I read the teleporter's mind.
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.
We've got no time, the Geiger counter's going out of control.
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.
Get on the radio and send both fleet's out immediately.
I'm going in.
Beast, Havok, back him up.
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.
But I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me.
Then we just hope to god it's not to late for me to stop him.
- Got it.
- Good luck!
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going out there.
We don't have time for this.
Anything comes in that entrance, you're taking care of it, ok?
Fine.
Beast!
If we go, you go
We believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb.
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.
We have to assume that, that's where Shaw is.
Gang way, gang way.
That's the nuclear reactor.
 Disable it.
Stop, don't move.
Get down!
Erik you're there, you've reached the void.
He's not here Charles, Shaw is not here.
He's left the sub.
What?
He's got to be there.
He has to be, there's no where else he can be, keep looking.
And I'm telling you he's not, there's no one here, god damn it!
Erik, what a pleasant surprise.
Erik? Erik!
So good to see you again.
May I ask you something?
Why are you on their side?
- He's gone.
- What?
He's gone into the void.
I can't communicate with him there.
Why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down,
...as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end.
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.
I truly am.
He's back.
Erik, whatever you're doing keep doing it, it's starting to work.
But everything I did, I did for you.
To unlock your power.
To make you embrace it.
It's working.
I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind.
You've come a long way from bending gates.
I'm so proud of you.
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.
Think how much further we could go, together.
Stop, Azazel!
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.
I want to help you.
This is our time. Our age.
We are the future of the human race.
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.
Everything you did, made me stronger.
Made me the weapon I am today.
That's the truth.
I've known it all along.
You are my creator.
NOW, Charles!
Are you okay?
Moira be quiet, I can only control this man for so long.
Sorry, Charles.
Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...
But I don't trust you.
Erik, there will be no telling that...
No.
- Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!
If you're in there, I'd like you to know that
I agree with every word you've said.
We are the future.
But...
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.
This is what we're going to do.
No, please Erik, no.
I'm going to count to three.
And I'm going to move the coin.
One...
Please, Erik.
Two...
Three.
The Russians share our concerns.
And will join a strike on all the mutants.
We can end this threat for good.
We'll never have another opportunity like this.
We have an agent on that beach.
- One agent.
- She's a good agent.
She's collateral damage.
Today our fighting stops.
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.
The real enemy is out there.
I feel their guns moving in the water.
Their metal targeting us.
Americans, Soviets, humans.
United in their fear of the unknown.
A Neanderthal is running scared, my fellow mutants.
Go ahead, Charles.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-70.
Respond, over.
The beach is secure, call off the attack.
The beach is targeted and ready to be fired upon, sir.
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.
Hello? Hello!
Fire. Fire.
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.
This is the time to prove it.
There are thousands of men on those ships. getting orders, innocent men.
They're just following orders.
I've been at the mercy of men just following orders.
Never again.
Erik Release them !
Noooooooo
I don't want to hurt you,don't make me.
Stay back !
Erik, stop!
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.
I'm so sorry.
I said back off!
You, you did this!
Please...
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.
Us turning on each other, it's what they want.
I tried to warn you, Charles.
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.
All of us, together.
Protecting each other.
We want the same thing.
Oh, my friend.
I'm sorry, but we do not.
Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
It's all right, it's all right.
His society won't accept us.
We form our own.
The humans has played their hand.
Now we get ready to play ours.
Who's with me?
No more hiding.
You, you should go with him. It's what you want.
You promised me you would never read my mind.
I know.
I promised you a great many things, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry.
Take care of him.

Help me out, help him.
I'm going to get you to a hospital.
Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.
In this week of Thanksgiving.
There is much for which we can be grateful.
As you look back to where we stood, only four weeks ago.
The unity of this hemisphere, the support of our allies.
And the calm determination of the American people.
These qualities may be tested many more times.
In this decade.
So how many students do you think you'll have here?
Once you get the academy up and running.
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.
You know, one day the government is going to realize how lucky they were,
..To have Professor X on their side.
Yeah
It has been on the road to a professor now, aren't I.
First thing I'll be going bald.
We're still on the government's side, Moira.
We're still a G-man, just without the G.
No, you're your own team now.
It's better.
You're, "X-Men".
Yes, I like the sound of that.
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.
I know.
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.
I'll never tell them where you are.
Ever.
I know you won't.
My love.
I remember the attack on HQ.
Leaving to go somewhere else.
And then this morning, I woke up at home.
That's it.
All that time wiped clean from your mind.
Just gone.
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA is no place for a woman.
What the hell was that?
I know we've had our differences.
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Gone.
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.
I was rather hoping you would fill it.
Join us.
Erik, I believe.
I prefer...
...Magneto.

Are you here to kill me?
I know what this is.
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
A man possessed of some radical notions.
What is the most resilient parasite?
A bacteria? A virus?
An intestinal worm?
Uh....
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--
An idea.
Resilient. Highly contagious.
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.
Right in there somewhere.
For someone like you to steal?
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...
...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...
...from even the most skilled extractor.
How can you do that?
Because I am the most skilled extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...
...your defense is never down.
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
...better than your therapist, better than anyone.
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...
...I need to know what's in that safe.
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.
He knows.
What's going on up there?
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
What's she doing here?
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.
If I jumped, would I survive?
With a clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?
I thought you might be missing me.
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.
So what?
Looks like Arthur's taste.
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.
Please, have a seat.
Tell me...
...do the children miss me?
You can't imagine.
What are you doing?
Just getting some fresh air.
Stay where you are, Mal.
Goddamn it.
Turn around.
The gun, Dom.
Please.
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?
I want to know the name of your employer.
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him would just wake him up.
But pain....
Pain is in the mind.
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
He was close. Very close.
Stop him!
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
He won't wake.
What?
Dunk him.
He's out.
You came prepared, hmm?
Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
- She would never....
- Yet here we are.
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.
Well, that's not true.
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
But your deception was obvious.
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.
Cobb?
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!
I've always hated this carpet.
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
But very definitely made of wool.
Right now...
...I'm lying on polyester.
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.
- How'd it go?
- Not good.
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.
But in my dream, you play by my rules.
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito....
We're not in your dream.
We're in mine.
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
That's enough.
You. What the hell was all that?
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.
He's not gonna check every compartment.
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.
Listen. Every man for himself.
Yes, hello?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?
Why?
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
Grandma says you're never coming back.
Phillipa, is that you?
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
She's shaking her head.
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.
Daddy?
Yeah, James?
Is Mommy with you?
James, we talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.
Where?
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?
And you be good, you be--
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?
Stateside.
Send my regards.
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
So I offer you the satisfaction.
It's not the way I deal with things.
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...
...why can't you plant one there instead?
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?
Elephants.
Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
Then you do have a choice.
Then I choose to leave, sir.
Tell the crew where you want to go.
Hey, Mr. Cobb.
How would you like to go home?
To America. To your children.
You can't fix that. No one can.
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...
...I'd need a guarantee.
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.
But I can.
So do you want to take a leap of faith...
...or become an old man, filled with regret...
...waiting to die alone?
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.
This can't be done.
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.
You don't know that.
I've done it before.
Who'd you do it to?
Why are we going to Paris?
We're gonna need a new architect.
You never did like your office, did you?
No space to think in that broom cupboard.
Is it safe for you to be here?
Extradition between France and the United States...
...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...
...to convince those children they still have a father.
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.
I never taught you to be a thief.
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.
But after what happened...
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
What are you doing here, Dom?
I think I found a way home.
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
But I need your help.
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.
- Money.
- Not just money.
You remember.
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities...
...things that never existed...
...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
They don't actually come into the dream.
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
Design it yourself.
Mal won't let me.
Come back to reality, Dom.
- Please.
- Reality.
Those kids, your grandchildren...
...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I've got somebody better.
Ariadne?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
Pleased to meet you.
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
A work placement?
Not exactly.
I have a test for you.
You're not gonna tell me anything first?
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
Stop.
Again.
Stop.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
That's more like it.
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
Now, that's when we're awake.
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.
Such as?
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
Genuine inspiration, right?
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.
We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?
It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Let me ask you a question.
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah.
So how did we end up here?
Well, we just came from the, uh....
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
If it's just a dream, then why are you--?
Because it's never just a dream, is it?
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.
That's why the military developed dream sharing.
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other...
...and then wake up.
How did architects become involved?
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Five minutes?
What--? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...
...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.
Almost everything else is here too.
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.
I am the subject. My mind populates it.
You can literally talk to my subconscious.
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
How else do you do it?
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
Well....
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
...but it's more about the feel of it.
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
Just you.
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this....
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.
Very impressive.
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?
Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college.
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.
You draw from stuff you know, right?
Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?
That why you need me to build your dreams?
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?
There was still time on the clock.
You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
What?
A totem, it's a small personal--
That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
- Like a coin?
- No.
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
That way, when you look at your totem...
...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to...
...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back....
When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.
It's a necessary risk.
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.
Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.
You never know.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
You're buying.
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.
How's your handwriting?
- It's versatile.
- Good.
Thank you very much.
Inception.
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me--
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
He is good at what he does, right?
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.
Not like you.
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.
You need the simplest version of the idea...
...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
So, what is this idea that you need to plant?
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
Right there you have various political motivations...
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
But all of that stuff, it's, um....
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?
What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
Which is what?
The relationship with the father.
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.
Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf.
He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.
Why don't you take me there?
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.
Cobol Engineering.
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.
All right.
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
My God, it's you, isn't it?
No, it isn't you.
Not dreaming now, are you?
Get him!
There!
One cafe.
Shh.
One cafe.
One cafe.
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.
Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
Different tail.
Cobb said you'd be back.
- I tried not to come, but....
- But there's nothing quite like it.
It's just...
...pure creation.
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
What kind of tricks?
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.
The infinite staircase.
See?
Paradox.
So a closed loop like that...
...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
But how big do these levels have to be?
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.
And the better the maze....
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
Exactly.
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
Why?
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.
- They're still together?
- No.
No, she's dead.
What you see in there is just his projection of her.
What was she like in real life?
She was lovely.
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.
To formulate compounds for a job?
And to go into the field with us.
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.
- Which are?
- Great depth.
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
Three.
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.
A powerful sedative.
- How many team members?
- Five.
Six.
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
This time, it seems there is.
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.
Perhaps you will not want to see.
After you.
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
They come every day to share the dream.
You see? Very stable.
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.
In dream time?
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?
Let's see what you can do.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
Sharp, no?
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
That's not your concern.
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
You asked me for inception.
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
This idea will define him.
It may come to change....
Well, it may come to change everything about him.
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
And we can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
Mr. Browning...
...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?
Not sure that's necessary.
No, no, no. I think we should.
How is he?
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but--
Robert, I told you keep out the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.
Leave that.
Here.
Must be a cherished memory of his.
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.
Robert...
...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.
The vultures are circling.
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
Then, when we take him a level deeper...
...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
So he gives himself the idea.
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
Were you going under on your own?
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
I didn't realize anyone was here, so....
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.
Here, let me take a look.
So you're learning, huh?
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh....
It was Mal's, actually. This....
This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin.
Arthur told me she passed away.
How are the mazes coming along?
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
...that we are trying to access.
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.
You know, l-- Actually, I have a question about this layout.
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.
Why is that so important?
In case one of us brings in our projections.
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
You can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.
- You can't build...
...because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
No one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.
- Thank you.
- For what?
For not asking whether I did.
"I will split up my father's empire."
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...
...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a "screw you" to the old man.
No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
All right, well, try this. Um....
"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than "might."
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
Inception's not about being specific.
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find.
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father...
...and say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
Sedation.
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
Good night.
The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
...creates a clear connection between dreamers...
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20--
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?
It's a week, the first level down.
Six months the second level down, and the third level--
That's 10 years.
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Depends on the dream.
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
- A kick.
- What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.
It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
That's the clever part.
I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.
Or tipping.
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need--
We need at least a good 10 hours.
Sydney to Los Angeles.
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.
He must be flying private, then.
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
On a 747, the pilot's up top...
...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Of course I do.
You said you had a dream.
That we'd grow old together.
And we can.
You shouldn't be here.
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.
Why do you do this to yourself?
It's the only way I can still dream.
Why is it so important to dream?
In my dreams, we're still together.
These aren't just dreams.
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.
I know I did.
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.
They're memories that I have to change.
Well, what's down there that you regret?
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.
This is your house?
Mine and Mal's, yes.
Where is she?
She's already gone.
That's my son, James.
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
That's Phillipa.
I thought about calling out to them...
...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.
Right now or never, Cobb.
Then I start to panic.
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
...that I need to see their faces one last time.
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
But the moment's past.
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.
As I'm about to call out to them...
...they run away.
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.
The real world.
What are you doing here?
My name is--
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand.
How could you understand?
Do you know what it is to be a lover?
To be half of a whole?
No.
I'll tell you a riddle.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you don't know for sure.
But it doesn't matter.
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
Because you'll be together.
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
What happened here?
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!
I'll come back for you. I promise.
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
All right.
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
And it doesn't have to be me...
...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the plane.
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.
Complete the job en route...
...I make one phone call from the plane...
...you have no trouble getting through lmmigration.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh. Water, please.
Oh, um, same, please.
Um....
Thank you.
You know, I couldn't help but notice...
...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
Yes, he, um....
He was my father.
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Hey.
To your father.
May he rest in peace, huh?
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
Ha, ha, bloody ha.
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.
All right. Taxi. Thank you.
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?
Great.
Come on.
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.
You might at least drop me at my stop.
I'm afraid that it doesn't--
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!
What the hell is going on?
This wasn't in the design.
Cobb?
Cobb?
Get him!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.
Saito?
Get Fischer in the back room now.
What the hell happened?
Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
Where'd it come from?
Why the hell were we ambushed?
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...
...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.
It should've shown in the research.
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!
We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.
Put him out his misery.
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
No. It won't wake him up.
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.
Not from this.
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
Right. So, what happens when we die?
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind...
...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
Which, in our case, is just you.
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.
Let's get him upstairs.
Great.
Thank you.
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.
And if we get killed...
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
Someone got first aid?
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.
This was the only way to go three layers deep.
You knew about this and went along with it?
I trusted him.
When? When he promised you half his share?
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.
You led us into a war zone with no way out?
There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible...
...and we get out using the kick, just like before.
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.
I am sitting this one out on this level.
Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
Downwards is the only way forwards.
Get ready.
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
Shut up! It won't be.
In your father's office, below the bookshelves...
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.
I don't know any safe.
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
Tell us what it is.
I don't know.
We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah? Whose authority?
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?
Cash, cards, lD. And this.
Useful?
Maybe.
You're on. You've got an hour.
An hour?
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.
- What's that?
- Good authority.
Uncle Peter.
Just make them stop.
- The combination.
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
You have one hour. Start talking.
You all right?
You okay?
Those bastards have had at me for two days.
They have someone with access to your father's office.
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.
- Yeah, well, neither do l, so....
- What?
Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it.
No, he never gave me any combination.
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.
Well, what, then?
I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers...
...based on your experiences with Maurice.
We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together.
Perhaps after your mother died.
After my mother died, you know what he told me?
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.
I was 11, Uncle Peter.
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
And if he dies?
Worst-case scenario?
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.
I appreciate that, Saito.
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
Limbo is gonna become your reality.
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
Filled with regret?
Waiting to die alone.
No.
I'll come back.
And we'll be young men together again.
Breathe.
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.
All right. What is in the safe?
Something for you.
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
That's an alternate.
This would supersede the other if you want it to.
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
Destroying my whole inheritance?
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.
In his own way.
In his own way.
At the end...
...he called me in to his deathbed.
He could barely speak.
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
He pulled me close.
And I could only make out...
...one word.
"Disappointed."
When were you in limbo?
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?
The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer...
...we're also going deeper into you.
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
We were working together.
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
I kept pushing things.
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
...that we could get trapped so deep...
...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
...we lost sight of what was real.
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.
We did that for years.
We built our own world.
How long were you stuck there?
Something like 50 years.
Jesus.
How could you stand it?
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.
And what about for her?
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
Limbo became her reality.
What happened when you woke up?
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades...
...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.
This one very simple idea that changed everything.
That our world wasn't real.
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
...that in order to get back home...
...we had to kill ourselves.
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...
...that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.
I can tell the difference.
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?
You don't know you're dreaming!
She was certain there was nothing I could do...
...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.
She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary.
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.
No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me.
No, I'm not.
Now, you listen to me.
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.
Now, just step back inside.
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
We've talked enough.
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.
We're gonna talk about this.
All right?
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.
Take a second, think about our children.
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...
...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
How you've threatened to kill me.
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
We're going home to our real children.
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?
You're waiting for a train.
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!
Jesus Christ!
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
So I ran.
Right now, or never, Cobb.
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!
All right, let's go.
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
And if we are gonna succeed in this...
...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her.
But you don't have to do that alone.
- No, you're not....
- I'm doing it for the others.
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
We have to move.
Time's up.
All right. I don't know any combination.
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
- I have no idea.
- Right now!
I said, right now! Right now!
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
You'll have to do better than that.
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?
What'd you get?
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
This helps us how?
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.
We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
Damn it.
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...
...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.
The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
No problem.
How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?
Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
- You ready?
- Ready!
Sweet dreams.
Am I boring you?
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.
Um, I have a lot on my mind.
There goes Mr. Charles.
Mr. Fischer, right?
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--
Hmm.
- And you must be?
- Leaving.
In case you get bored.
Must've blown you off.
That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.
Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.
Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500--
About $500, right?
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.
Who or what is Mr. Charles?
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
And why don't you approve?
It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.
So now you've noticed how much time...
...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
- I'm sorry, but....
- Hold on! Wait!
You look a bit perkier.
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
Turbulence on the plane?
No, it's much closer.
That's Yusuf's driving.
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?
Rod Green from marketing.
But that's not true at all, is it?
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?
I'm the head of your security down here.
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
Security, huh?
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.
You're talking about dreams?
Are you talking about, um, extraction?
I am here to protect you.
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event...
...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.
Strange weather, isn't it?
You feel that?
What's happening?
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
We should probably get out of here.
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.
None of this is real. You're in a dream.
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself...
...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
Yeah, l....
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
Mm-hm.
- You're not real?
- No.
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event...
...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you get me out of here?
Right away. Follow me.
Hold on a second.
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger...
...you may not wake up.
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.
You remember the training.
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
What do you remember from before this dream?
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.
There was rain.
Uncle Peter.
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.
It had something to do with, um....
Something to do with a safe.
God, why is it so hard to remember?
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
Listen, it takes years of practice.
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.
Five.
Five, two-- It was something, it was a long number.
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.
Yep.
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
So we get a nice synchronized kick.
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.
They're with me. Go on.
Mr. Charles.
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.
They were trying to put you under.
- I'm already under.
- Under again.
What do you mean, a dream within a dream?
Hey. I see you've changed.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.
Oh.
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...
...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
Shh.
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.
And you saw them torture him?
The kidnappers are working for you?
Robert.
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?
That's his last insult.
A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.
But he's wrong.
You can build a better company than he ever did.
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
All right.
- He's out.
- Wait.
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
We're going into Fischer's.
I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
That's right.
Security's gonna run you down hard.
And I will lead them on a merry chase.
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
You good?
Hey. You ready?
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.
Cobb?
Cobb? What's down there?
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.
I mean, what's down there for you?
Did you see that?
Eames, this is your dream.
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.
No, you're with me.
I could do it.
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.
The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
You're not coming in?
In order to find out the truth about your father...
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.
Come on, Fischer!
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!
Move!
Go!
Sod it.
I hope you're ready.
No, it's too soon.
Cobb, do you hear that?
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
So, what do we do?
We move fast.
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
Which gives Arthur three minutes.
- Hey!
- That's him!
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.
Then they need a new route, a more direct route.
It's designed as a labyrinth.
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
Eames?
Did Eames add any features?
I don't think I should tell you.
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
Good. Explain it to them.
- Saito?
- Go ahead.
Paradox.
- What was that?
- The kick.
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?
Yeah, we missed it.
Man.
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, what the hell do we do now?
We finish the job before the next kick.
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up....
How do I drop you without gravity?
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.
You okay?
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!
Go, go, go!
There's something wrong.
They're heading your way, like they know something.
Just buy us more time, all right?
- Come on!
- On my way.
Come on! Move!
All right.
Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
- Does the strong room have windows?
- lt wouldn't be very strong if it did.
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.
I'm in.
There he is.
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
Come on. Come on, a little lower.
Cobb.
No, she is not real.
How do you know that?
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.
Hello.
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.
I couldn't shoot her.
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.
So that's it, then? We failed?
We're done. I'm sorry.
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
Let's set the charges.
No, there's still another way.
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.
No, but there will be enough time down there.
And we will find him.
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him.
We can give him his own kick down below.
Look, you get him in there.
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital...
...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.
Saito will never make it, will he?
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
Mal's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.
She wants me back down there with her.
All right?
- This is your world?
- lt was.
And this is where she'll be.
Come on.
Saito. Saito.
I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?
No room for tourists on these jobs.
Don't be silly.
You built all this? This is incredible.
We built for years.
Then we started in on the memories.
This way.
This was our neighborhood.
Places from our past.
That was our first apartment.
Then we moved to that building right there.
After Mal became pregnant, that became our home.
You reconstructed all of this from memory?
Like I told you, we had lots of time.
What is that?
That's the house Mal grew up in.
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.
Come on.
We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building.
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
What?
I'm gonna improvise.
Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
Highly contagious.
And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define...
...or destroy you.
The smallest idea, such as:
"Your world is not real."
Simple little thought that changes everything.
So certain of your world. Of what's real.
Do you think he is?
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
I know what's real, Mal.
No creeping doubts?
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
Chased around the globe...
...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
Admit it.
You don't believe in one reality anymore.
So choose.
Choose to be here.
Choose me.
You know what I have to do.
I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Because you left us.
I'm not wrong.
You're confused.
Our children are here.
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
Up above?
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.
Watch.
James? Phillipa?
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?
What if I'm what's real?
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Guilt.
I feel guilt, Mal.
And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...
...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there...
...reminding me of the truth.
What truth?
That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
You planted the idea in my mind?
What is she talking about?
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?
We were lost in here.
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.
She had locked something away, something deep inside.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
And she couldn't break free.
So I decided to search for it.
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
And I broke in...
...and I planted an idea.
A simple little idea that would change everything.
That her world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that'll take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you can't know for sure.
Yet it doesn't matter.
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!
But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
...that even after she woke....
That even after you came back to reality...
...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
Mal, no! Jesus!
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.
You betrayed me.
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.
We can still be together, right here...
...in the world we built together.
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
You can't have him.
- lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?
Fischer is on the porch.
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
No.
I wish.
I wish more than anything, but...
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
...all your perfection, all your imperfection.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Look at you.
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.
And you were the best that I could do, but...
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.
Does this feel real?
- What are you doing?
- lmprovising.
No, no, no!
In there, now. Go, go, go.
I was dis--
I was dis-- Disa--
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--
I know you were disappointed...
...I couldn't be you.
No.
No, no, no.
I was disappointed...
...that you tried.
What?
Come on, come on.
Dad?
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!
I will!
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did.
We did. You don't remember?
I miss you more than I can bear...
...but we had our time together.
And I have to let you go.
I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, Robert.
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...
...not just to live for him.
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
What happened?
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?
No, to find Saito.
He'll be lost.
No, he'll be all right.
Have you come to kill me?
I'm waiting for someone.
Someone from a half-remembered dream.
Cobb?
Impossible.
We were young men together.
I'm an old man.
Filled with regret.
Waiting to die alone.
I've come back for you.
To remind you of something.
Something you once knew.
That this world is not real.
To convince me to honor our arrangement?
To take a leap of faith, yes.
Come back...
...so we can be young men together again.
Come back with me.
Come back.
Hot towel, sir?
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.
Do you need immigration forms?
Thank you.
Hot towel, sir?
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome.
This way.
James? Phillipa?
Look who's here.
Hey.
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy!
- How are you?
Look what I've been building!
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!
On the cliff? Come on, I want you to show me. Can you show me?
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...
That exit sends them right at us.
We force them west here...
Away from the community.
They'll follow a path if something's drawing them.
Carter!
Sh sh sh.
You gotta be quiet.
Why don't you head back?
Tell everyone what's happening.
They got inside the walls.
They're killing people.
Leave!
My people have guns...
...yours don't.
Try again.
Tobin, it's not stopping.
Light it up. You hear me?
Tobin!
- Michonne.
- Got it.
Shit! Shit!
It was half.
Jesus, it was more than half.
We just gotta stay ahead of them.
They walk, we run.
- Rick!
- I'm here.
What's going on back there?
Half of them broke off.
They're going toward Alexandria.
Towards you?
We ran ahead.
There's a horn or something.
Loud, coming from the east.
It's not stopping.
I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.
We have it.
You keep going.
They're gonna need our help.
Gotta keep the herd moving.
Not if it's going down, we don't.
The rest of that herd turns around, the bad back there gets worse.
Daryl?
Yeah, I heard you.
Nicholas.
- Ah!
- You okay?
It's my ankle.
All right, come on.
Grab on. Let's go.
Come on.
It's coming from back home.
- It has to be.
- He did this.
He brought us all out here to die.
- He killed Carter.
- Carter was dead already.
Now they're in trouble back there and we're done.
- We're good as dead.
- Hey, calm down.
What the hell are you talking about?
We are done.
And it's 'cause of him.
Shut up and move.
Come on.
Damn it.
All right, listen up.
Here's the new plan.
I go back, get the RV, circle around the woods on Redding.
I'll get in front of them before they get there.
I can lead them away again.
RV's a mile back.
I can go with you.
I'll handle it.
Just get home.
They might need you there.
Glenn, Michonne.
If something's in front of you, you kill it.
No hiding, no waiting.
You keep going.
I'm going with you. You can't do this on your own.
- Glenn, I can do this.
- You need to help me.
- We've got to get these people back.
- Yeah.
Thing is, they aren't all gonna make it.
- Rick.
- You try to save them, you try, but they can't keep up, you keep going.
You have to. You make sure you get back.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
The horn stopped. Good.
Get back safe.

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>
We're ahead of it.
10 minutes.
20 minutes, maybe.
We all keep up the pace, we all get back home.
So if we don't, that's it, huh?
We don't even know what's waiting for us.
It's gonna be okay.
We have walls for a reason.
That sound. Maybe someone plowed right through.
Maybe we're walking back to nothing.
Shh, my wife's back there.
Mine, too.
Look, don't worry about what's gone wrong.
Figure out how to make this go right.
We're moving in the same direction everything else is.
We're gonna catch up with something.
We're gonna catch up with a lot of things and we're gonna end them.
We have no choice.
We gotta keep going forward.
Stay here.
Don't shoot unless you have to.
Come on.
That's us.
Sturgess!
I know what it means.
We gotta keep moving, right?
Hey, we gone five miles out yet?
Give or take some yardage.
You got a reason for asking?
Next intersection we're gonna spin around and go back.
The plan is to go 15 more.
Yeah, I'm gonna change that.
Five's gonna have to work.
The magic number's 20.
That's the mission.
That's making sure they're off munching on infirm raccoons the rest of their undead lives instead of any of us.
You want to go, we can't stop you.
But without you, they could stop us.
- Can I take a look?
- Please?
Nah, I got faith in you.
- Daryl!
- Don't do it, man!
Is it bad?
It's about what you'd expect.
Huh, didn't expect this.
How long you been married?
Three months.
She wasn't my wife from before.
How'd you meet?
It was early on.
Aaron found me.
I was alone, lost everything.
Everyone.
Myself, I--
I wasn't crazy.
I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.
Know what I mean?
I do.
We found Betsy on the way back to the community.
She still saw me.
After I thought
I was dead and gone, she was my first friend.
Then she was more.
She made me more.
Even better than
how I used to be.
But if I could make it back,
I'd want to say good-bye.
Tell her... finding her in all this, that was everything.
We need to stop and bandage him up.
No, we keep moving.
I'm okay.
You won't be if we don't stop your bleeding.
We'll find a place.
Can't stop out in the open too long.
Come on.
Let's check if these cars work first.
See if they can get us back.
I'll stay with them.
Listen, I need to get home, but I'm not leaving them behind.
We patch Scott up, we get going.
Rick knows what he knows.
We're ahead of the herd.
Maybe half an hour now.
We can stop.
We can make it.
This is halfway home, right?
Yeah.
This is where it happened.
I said it at the dealership.
Me and Aiden didn't know what we were doing.
The people on your crew who died?
They weren't afraid.
We were.
No luck.
We have to stay on foot.
Nicholas was here last.
He can show us the way.
Uh, okay.
All right.
There's no cars.
I got you.
I got you.
Oh, Jesus.
Sturgess?
He left us behind.
Herd's that way.
Shit.
- Nicholas.
- Uh...
We stay quiet, patch Scott and Annie up, get out of here.
Those walkers in the alley and down the street, they're blocking the way out of town.
We can't take 'em on, not in the shape that we're in.
We'll have to lead them away if we have to.
Because that's been working well lately.
I'm trying here.
I'm not giving up.
Yeah, not yet.
Hey, I was thinking, if we can find a way to distract the herd coming in, then they won't make it back to the community.
How?
Burn one of the buildings.
Hopefully more.
They'll get drawn to it and they'll stop here.
It's gonna take some time.
I'll do it.
You stay with them.
It's my plan.
It's on me.
You have a wife, Glenn.
That's why I'm doing this.
You've got to get everybody back.
You're the one who can.
If I take too long, you just go.
I'm not leaving without you.
- That is not the way this works.
- I will meet you there.
If I get stuck out here, I'll find some way to show you guys I'm okay.
We all have a job to do.
There's a feed store.
It's old.
A lot of dry stuff inside.
It should go up easy.
I'll go with you.
I can--
I can draw a map.
No.
You lead the way.
Just gotta do one thing first.
Rick, it's Glenn.
We're in a town five degrees east of the green marker.
If you get around on Redding in the next 20 minutes, you should be good.
I think that's how far
we're ahead of the herd.
I'm gonna try to set a fire
and distract them.
If you don't see smoke, they're still coming your way.
I got to go.
Good luck, dumbass.
That'll keep you going until we get you back to the infirmary.
Annie, I'm gonna figure out a crutch for you.
Just leave me.
What?
I'm slowing you down.
We're gonna hit more roamers.
It's that simple.
Leave me.
Leave us.
No.
It's stupid for you guys to wait on me.
We'll all go down.
Come on, man, wake up.
You don't want to do it now, you do it out there.
We get into trouble again, you run.
- And you don't look back.
- No, if we go, we go together.
We got each other's backs just like always.
Okay, we don't leave people behind.
Not us.
No one is leaving anyone behind.
I'm gonna find something for you, Annie.
Hey.
Do you have a problem with me?
I'm just looking out for my people.
And you think that I'm not?
Look, I heard what Rick said.
Which part?
How they wouldn't all make it.
They meaning us and not you.
How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.
Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.
Yeah, we will.
Rick said what he said because sometimes you don't have a choice.
That is not how we do it.
Because you've never had to do it any other way.
You haven't been through it, not really.
- Michonne--
- Not like Rick.
Rick was out there.
I was out there.
We know, you don't.
But if you don't learn, you will die, we will.
I've been doing runs from the start, okay?
- I know what it's like.
- Have you ever had to kill people because they had already killed your friends and were coming for you next?
Have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward?
Have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or walkers' or your friends'?
Huh?
Then you don't know.
Wait.
It should be me.
He was on my crew.
His name was Will.
He was 19.
We left him behind.
You're not that guy anymore.
Hey, you are here now.
You are not that guy anymore.
Okay.
Shit.
Is that home?
We need to go now.
Okay. Okay, let's go.
Come on.
We gotta go now.
The ones from down the street and in the alley, they're getting drawn by the gunfire.
Soon as they clear, we head for the feed store.
Till then we sit tight,
keep quiet.
They heard that.
They know we're in here now.
We can't wait them out.
The herd, it's gonna be here any minute.
What?
They're coming.
Go!
Come on!
Where's the feed store?
- Go! The other end of town. We can try--
- We can't.
Glenn said we got to go.
We go now.
Ah!
Just run!
Go!
It's just up ahead.
We light it up and we go.
There's gotta be another building.
- We gotta go.
- Um...
- Where?!
- Uh, uh...
- Nicholas!
- This way.
- This-- this way.
- Go! Go!
You go over first, and then we'll help Scott.
No, they're coming.
Just go.
We're doing this.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
No!
Damn it.
We gotta go.
We gotta keep going.
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a choice.
Come on!
Up here!
Up here!
Nicholas!
Hey, Nicholas!
Nicholas!
Look at me.
Hey, look at me!
Look at me!
Hey! Hey!
Nicholas!
Look at me!
Thank you.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
There's no smoke.
It doesn't mean they didn't make it.
The herd's still coming, but this creek should slow them down some.
Glenn.
I'm in place by my best guess.
You guys make it back yet?
Glenn.
Tobin, you there?
Daryl?
I'm here.
Won't be long now.
They're almost here.
I'll get them going
your way again.
How 'bout that, Daryl?
He's gonna be coming our way.
There's gunfire coming from back home.
We gotta sit with it and hope they can handle it.
I think they can.
They have to.
We keep going forward for them.
Can't turn back
'cause we're afraid.
We ain't afraid.
This is for them.
Going back now before it's done, that'd be for us.
The herd has to be almost here.
Rick?
Rick?
Rick?
Rick?
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Mayday, Mayday, this is Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.
Dad!
Engines 1 and 2 are off-line!
We're losing her!
Go! Go!
Dad!
I've heard stories of Earth.
A paradise.
Until we destroyed it.
The founding of the United
Ranger Corps 1000 years ago
was a global military effort, an evacuation of Earth.
The Rangers would lead the settlement of mankind's new home.
Nova Prime.
But we were not alone.
The aliens released the Ursa.
Monsters bred to kill humans.
Technically blind, the Ursa sees humans
based on pheromones we secrete when frightened.
They literally smell our fear.
Humankind was again in danger of extinction
and again turned to the Rangers for the answer.
That answer came in the form of the prime commander, Cypher Raige,
the original ghost.
He is believed to be so completely free of fear
that to an Ursa, he is invisible.
This phenomena is known as "ghosting."
This isn't a race, cadet!
Raige.
Your test scores are very impressive.
In the classroom, you are an outstanding Ranger, but in the field, you collapse.
I'm not advancing you.
You may try again next year.
Sir, I am dedicated, have studied and display conduct becoming of a Ranger, sir.
I request that the commander reconsider his assessment, sir.
Cadet.
Sir, my father's returning home tonight.
I haven't seen him in...
It's a very special day for our family.
And I have got to be able to tell him that I am a Ranger, sir.
You tell your father that I said, "Welcome home."
Dismissed.
Faia.
Hi.
How were finals?
How were finals?
I wasn't advanced to Ranger.
Where do we look when we speak?
I was not advanced to Ranger.
You were not advanced to Ranger...
I was not advanced to Ranger, sir.
That's all right. You're young.
I ran the canyons 11 seconds faster than you did.
You weren't ready. Velan's a good man.
He knows his stuff.
If you were, he would have promoted you.
You weren't ready.
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room.
Are you asking me or telling me?
May I go to my room?
Denied! Sit down!
I have a last visit to Iphitos.
I'm flying tomorrow, supervising training.
And after it's completed,
I'm announcing my retirement.
Retirement?
Maybe I'll work with you in Turbine Division.
Together.
Please, no.
I want my family back.
I want you back.
That boy in there is trying to find you.
He's a feeling boy.
He's an intuitive boy.
He watched you read that book with Senshi his entire life.
He's reading that book now.
He's reaching for you.
Don't get me wrong. I respect everything you've done.
But you have a son in the other room that you do not know.
He blames himself for what happened to Senshi.
He thinks it's his fault.
He's drowning.
And he does not need a commanding officer.
He needs a father.
Pack your bags. You're coming with me to Iphitos.
This was a really good decision.
Now go make some good memories together.
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.
Okay.
General Raige.
I was on the plateau.
You saved me and four others.
I just came from seeing my baby girl's face for the first time.
Stand me up.
That won't be necessary, Ranger.
Stand me up.
Watch the left side!
Pull!
Perimeter's good.
I'm reading Moby Dick.
Your mother told me.
That's great.
Our military transport will arrive at training base on Iphitos
in seven hours.
I'm going to grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.
Hey. Can you read?
I said, can you read?
Yes, sir.
Well, there's a sign back there.
"Authorized personnel only."
Why didn't you read that?
What's in the cage?
Might wanna go easy on him, sarge.
That's the prime commander's son right there.
You're Raige's kid?
What's in there?
You wanna see?
Kit, we have to go right now.
Is that...?
They surprised us.
Sent ships, dropped those things.
An Ursa?
We're taking it to
Iphitos for ghost training.
You want to see if you can ghost?
Ghosting is when you don't have a trace of fear in you.
Most guys freeze.
That's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn't have.
See? Even your brain knows you're screwed.
Your blood is filling with adrenaline now, whether you know it or not.
Your heart's beating faster.
It's getting a little harder to breathe.
Your neurobiological system is telling you to run but your knees are too weak to move.
And it's too late anyway.
The pores on your skin have already opened up, secreting an imperceptible amount of pheromones into the air.
And all you can think about is when it's going to kill you.
Senshi!
She sees you, kid. Heh, heh.
Attention on deck.
Kitai. Back to your seat, now.
Rangers, go Redcon-1.
Secure all cargo!
Behind your seat, there's a life suit.
Put it on. Strap in, full harness.
Yes, sir.
Good evening, general.
Captain.
What's the last known position of the closest asteroid storm?
Category-four asteroid formation.
Two thousand kilometers to starboard at plus-four-five declination.
I detected graviton vibrations in the hull.
But you detected how?
Graviton buildup could be a precursor to mass expansion.
That storm could be on us in minutes.
But, sir, mass expansion is one in a million.
If we try to navigate out, the pull of our own graviton weight could set the thing off.
Let's just hold course and hope I'm wrong.
Just out of interest, sir, how often are you wrong?
My wife would give a very interesting answer to that question.
Graviton count's decreasing.
Eight hundred parts per million.
Six hundred and fifty.
Well, sir, there's a first time for everything.
Turn into it. Match bearing.
Dad!
She's a dead stick! Engines off-line!
We're losing her!
Can you travel us out of here?
Where?
The anchorage. Lycia. It's closest.
Negative, sir. We cannot
Wormhole travel in the middle of this.
Do it.
Coordinates for anchorage at Lycia locked in. No confirmation signal.
Travel us now.
Without confirmation...
That's an order.
Go! Go!
Cabin pressure dropping.
Heavy damage to outer hull.
Breach possible in middle cabin.
Find me something I can land on. Now.
I got something.
Bearing three-four-zero by nine-five, range 86,000.
Warning. This planet has been declared unfit for human habitation,
placed under class-one quarantine by the interplanetary Authority.
Under penalty of law, do not attempt to land.
Repeat, do not attempt to land.
It's not possible.
The computer might have defaulted back to a known demarcation point.
No, not here.
Travel us again.
Negative, sir. This ship is going to tear apart at any moment.
Set her down.
Mayday, Mayday, this is
Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.
We took damage from an asteroid storm and are going down with bingo power.
Dad, Dad, Dad!
Dad!
You all right?
You stay there.
Evaluate.
Good to go.
Confirm the Ursa is contained.
The back of the ship is gone.
Rangers, count off.
Rangers, count off!
Kit.
The cockpit is directly above us.
Go.
Left rear, there's a utility compartment.
Inside there's an emergency beacon.
Silver.
Like a saucer. Bring it to me.
Consolidate. Inventory up.
General Cypher Raige.
We crash-landed.
Two confirmed survivors.
Kitai.
The emergency beacon you brought me will fire a distress signal deep into space.
But it is damaged.
There is another one in the tail section of our ship.
This is us here.
That is the tail, somewhere in this area.
It's approximately 100 kilometers from here.
We need that beacon.
Do you understand?
Both my legs are broken, one very badly.
You are going to retrieve that beacon or we are going to die.
Do you understand?
Repeat what I just said to you.
I have to go retrieve the beacon or we're going to die.
You have air filtration inhalers.
You need to take one now.
The fluid will coat your lungs, increasing oxygen extraction allowing you to breathe comfortably in the environment.
You have six vials.
At your weight, that should be 20 to 24 hours each.
That's more than enough.
Your life suit and backpack are equipped with digital and virtual imaging so I will be able to see everything that you see and what you do not see.
I will guide you.
It will be like I'm right there with you.
Take my cutlass.
It's the C-40.
The full 22 configurations.
Kitai, every single decision you make will be life or death.
This is a class-one quarantined planet.
Everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans.
Do you know where we are?
No, sir.
This is Earth.
The Ursa?
Three possibilities. The first and most likely is that it died in the crash.
The second and less likely is that it is injured very badly and still contained.
The third and least likely is that it is out.
We will proceed, however, in anticipation of the worst-case scenario.
Every movement will be under protocol Escape and Evade.
If he's out there
I will see him long before he gets anywhere near you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Do exactly as I tell you and we will survive.
Kitai, calm down.
Take a knee.
Root yourself in this present moment now.
Sight, sound, smell.
What do you feel?
My body feels heavier.
Very good. Earth's gravitational pull is different than at home.
Very good.
Now let's go.
Whoa, whoa!
What happened?
You didn't see that?
Kitai, what happened?
I'm fine. No change. I just slipped.
There's condensation on the stones.
I'm good to go.
General Cypher Raige.
Initiating remote probe recon.
Primary target,
Ursa.
I want to reiterate that your naviband is our sole means of communication.
Roger.
The temperatures on this planet fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.
And most of the planet freezes over completely at night.
But there are hot spots, geothermal nodes between here and the tail that will keep you warm during the freeze-over.
You must reach one of these hot spots each evening before nightfall.
Is that understood?
Copy.
Standard operating procedure until
I give you further instructions. Stand by.
Dad, are you there?
Hey, Dad, are you there?
Dad, you there?
Hello?
I'm here.
A boy I know had this.
Mm.
It's a real book. From a museum.
It's Moby Dick.
Mm-hm.
He said I could even hold on to it.
Hold on to what?
The book, Dad. Heh.
Oh.
Hm.
Did they really kill these whales?
We, Senshi, for their oil, and they almost disappeared.
Just before the age of carbon fuels.
Where's your brother?
Kit.
Hey.
Dad, are you there?
I'm here.
Where are you?
My suit's turned black.
I like it, but I think it's something bad.
Your suit is made of smart fabric.
It has motion sensors.
I'm tracking a life form moving toward you from the west.
It's closing rapidly.
Fifty meters.
Forty.
Thirty.
Twenty.
Ten.
It is right there, Kitai.
Do not move.
Recognize your power.
This will be your creation.
Stand down, cadet.
Get out of here!
Kitai!
Control yourself, cadet!
Kitai, stand down!
Get away!
Get away!
Kitai!
To your rear. Out to your rear.
There's a river
250 meters straight ahead. Go.
They are no longer in pursuit.
Cadet, you are not being followed.
I repeat, you are not being followed.
Kitai, you are running from nothing'.!
Kitai!
Kitai.
Put my damn cutlass away.
You are not being followed.
Take a knee.
Take a knee, cadet!
If you want to die today that is fine, but you are not going to kill me.
Kitai, I need you to do a physical assessment.
You are showing rapid blood contamination. Are you out?
I'm dizzy.
Kitai, self-eval.
Dad, I can't stand.
Open your med kit.
You are going to have to administer the antitoxin in sequence.
Inject yourself with the clear liquid first.
Do it now.
I can't see.
The poison is affecting your nervous system. Stay even.
Dad, please come help me. I can't see.
I can't do this by myself, Dad.
Please come get me.
Kitai, inject yourself directly into your heart with the first stage.
Do it now.
Now the second. ASAP.
To your left, Kitai.
Left!
I can't feel my hand.
Dad, I can't feel my hands.
Press it into the ground.
Roll over on it and press it into the ground, Kitai.
Great work, cadet.
But you are going to have to lie there for a moment.
The parasite that stung you has a paralyzing agent in its venom.
So you are going to have to lie there for a little bit
while the antitoxin does its job.
It's time to wake up.
Son.
The temperature is dropping five degrees every 10 minutes.
You have got to wake up.
Can you blink your eyes?
Son.
I need you to please blink your eyes.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
That sucked.
That is correct.
You've got 9.7 kilometers to the hot spot.
How about you show me that 1 OK in 50 minutes, cadet?
Sir, yes, sir.
Ten mikes out. All good.
Who wasn't advanced to Ranger?
Who was it?
Watch him go. Watch him go.
Five mikes out.
Five mikes out.
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.
Here.
Dad, you help me.
No, Senshi, you go ahead.
You blow.
Come on, Dad. Blow.
Now, you know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.
No. I think you can. Heh.
Faia, you're right there. Help the girl.
You can do it.
I know you can.
Hot Spot 1 arrival.
H plus 54 minutes.
Equipment check and consolidate.
Take your next inhaler.
Your oxygen extraction is bottoming.
Take your next breathing fluid.
Second dose of breathing fluid compete.
Mm.
Count off remaining.
Four vials remain, sir.
Repeat.
Four vials remain, sir.
Dad.
Dad!
I'm here.
How did you do it?
How did you first ghost?
Out for a run.
Alone.
Something we're never supposed to do.
Ursa de-camos right in front of me.
I go for my cutlass.
It shoots its pincer right through my shoulder.
Next thing I know, we're over the cliff, falling,
30 meters straight down into the river.
We settle onto the bottom.
It's on top of me.
But it's not moving.
And I realize
He's trying to drown me.
I'm thinking, "I'm gonna die."
"I'm gonna die."
"I cannot believe this is how I'm going to die."
I can see my blood bubbling up, mixing with the sunlight shining through the water.
And I think, "Wow... that's really pretty."
And everything slows down.
And I see its pincer through my shoulder.
And I decide
I don't want that in there anymore.
So I pull it out.
And he lets me go.
And more than that, I can tell... it can't find me.
It doesn't even know where to look.
And it dawned on me... fear is not real.
The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future.
It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist.
That is near insanity, Kitai.
Now, do not misunderstand me.
Danger is very real.
But fear is a choice.
We are all telling ourselves a story.
And that day, mine changed.
Fourteen kilometers to the falls.
That's our midway checkpoint.
I'm reading you.
Kitai, get to the falls ASAP.
I hear something.
I think it's water. A lot of it.
Inventory up.
Roger.
Food rations, half available. Flares, full.
Med kit, half available. Breathing fluid...
Breathing fluid, four vials available.
Why are you not showing me the case?
What?
Show it to me now.
I thought that I could make it, sir.
Abort mission.
Return to the ship.
That is an order.
Don't come out.
No matter what.
That's an order.
Dad!
Ah!
No, Dad.
I can do it. I don't need many.
I can get across with just two.
You need a minimum of three inhalers to make it to the tail.
You have exhausted your resources.
I can get across.
I can do it with just two, Dad.
This mission has reached abort criteria.
I take full responsibility.
You did your best.
You have nothing more to prove.
Now return to the ship.
What was your mistake?
Trusting me?
Depending on me, thinking that I could do this?
I am giving you an order... to turn around... and return to this ship.
You wouldn't give any other Ranger that order!
You are not a Ranger.
And I am giving you that order.
What was I supposed to do?
What did you want me to do?
She gave me an order!
She said no matter what, don't come out of that box!
Was I supposed to just come out and die?
What do you think, cadet?
What do you think you should have done?
Because that is all that matters.
What do you think you should have done?
And where were you?!
She called out for you!
She called your name!
And you weren't there, because you're never there!
And you think I'm a coward?!
You're wrong!
I'm not a coward!
You're the coward!
I'm not a coward!
Kitai!
Kitai, you've got incoming.
Do you copy? You've got incoming.
Kitai, dive!
Dive!
Kitai!
No!
Leave them alone!
Get away!
Dad, I'm sorry. It's Kitai.
Where is my son?
General Cypher Raige.
This is a message for my wife.
Faia...
I have lost contact with our son.
End message.
You have six vials. At your weight, that should be 20 to 24 hours each.
That's more than enough.
I estimate four days to reach the tail.
Let's break it into sections.
Six hours to reach the first geothermal site.
The first leg, 20 K to the mouth of the North Forest. I'm right here.
- Five mikes out.
- Keep moving.
- Hot Spot 1 arrival.
- Take your next inhaler.
H plus 54 minutes.
There is an escarpment.
Looks like it could be a waterfall.
We'll call that midway.
I can get across. I can do it with two.
Fourteen kilometers to the falls.
This is us here.
That is the tail.
You are going to retrieve that beacon
or we are going to die.
Leave me alone!
Wake up.
It's time for you to wake up.
Hey.
Hey.
I was just about to come out that day.
No, you weren't.
But you did the right thing.
Dad says I should have tried.
He's just mad at himself.
That's all.
Why couldn't you ghost?
You're close right now.
I am?
Are you scared?
No. I'm tired.
That's good.
You filled your heart with something else.
Now you got to get up.
I memorized some of Moby Dick.
Kitai, get up.
"All that maddens and torments,
Wake up."
"All that stirs up lees of things,
Wake up."
"All truth with malice, all that cracks the sinews..."
Wake up!
Kit...
Hey, thanks.
No.
Mm-mm.
Dad.
Dad, it's Kitai. I made it to...
Kitai.
Dad, I made it to the tail. Do you copy?
Kitai, I'm here.
Are you okay?
Dad, do you read me?
I copy.
Dad, I made it to the tail. Do you copy?
Kitai, we have electrical interference.
You are in a black zone.
I repeat, you are in a black...
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please copy.
Dad?
I'm here.
I swear to you I'm here.
Take a knee.
It is the ionic layer... in the atmosphere above your current position.
It is causing electrical interference.
That is why the beacon is not firing.
To your north.
The peak.
You must fire the beacon from the peak of that mountain.
See it, Kitai.
Please... see it.
Good boy.
It is a pheromone trigger.
He set it to scare you, so he can track you. Keep moving.
It has found you.
Run.
Just run, Kitai.
Just run.
Ah! Unh!
Unh! Ah!
Unh!
Ah!
Ah! Unh!
Climb in here, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.
Dad!
Root yourself in this present moment now.
Sight, sound, smell.
What do you feel?
You're still in that box.
It's time to come out.
Yah!
Yah!
- Stand me up.
- General.
I said, stand me up.
Watch his back.
Dad?
Yeah?
I want to work with Mom.
Me too.
Obviously,
I miscalculated a few things.
Eddie! I know you're in there!
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...
The access code you have entered...
...the knife appears at your back?
The access code you have entered is invalid...
Well, I'll tell you one thing...
...I will never let them touch me.
My neighbor, who must have opened his door to complain.
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!
For a guy with a four digit IQ,
I must have missed something.
And I hadn't missed much.
I'd come this close to having an impact on the world.
And now, the only thing
I'd have an impact on...
...was the sidewalk.
You see that guy?
That was me, not so long ago.
What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?
Only a writer. Strangely enough,
nobody believed that
I actually had a book contract.
Well, it's masquerading as a sci-fi novel, but it's really, uh, my own personal manifesto about the plight of the individual in the 21st century.
I sort of created a utopian society where we all sort of...
Uh... Uh...
It's really... it's really...
Uh...
Today was the day
I was gonna kick its ass.
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go...
It was gonna be great.
Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.
That's the key concept.
Don't leave the room.
A few weeks passed this way.
Maybe a few months.
At least I still had Lindy.
Just like that?
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.
I'm surprised.
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.
If you just wait to see what she says...
Eddie.
- What?
- I know how it's going.
I'm your...
I was your girlfriend.
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me.
Partner? Squeeze?
Paramour. Inamorata.
Cleaning lady. Bank.
Be that a...
What's mine is yours, too, and you know I want to share the rest of my life with you.
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.
Why not?
Because it worked out so well for you last time.
It's true, I did marry once.
Right out of college, to Melissa.
I do.
Briefly.
- This isn't working.
Well, even though everything you say is true, I still love you.
I gotta get back to work.
You didn't even tell me what happened.
- I got it.
- You did?
Mmm-hm. I'm an editor.
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.
Thanks.
- OK.
- OK.
She was right. Why stick it out?
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.
We both knew what was beckoning.
The lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Jersey.
My father happy to we/come me into the challenging field
of dental supply inventory.
Eddie Morra.
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten
and put away in mothballs,
is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in-law?
Holy shit, man.
What has it been? Like nine years?
- God!
- Hey.
You all right? You look like you're living on the streets.
What's going on?
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?
Uh, I'm writing. Writing a lot.
Oh, you're still trying to write?
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- How about you?
Are you still dealing, Vern?
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
- When has that ever stopped you?
- So.
- So...
How's Melissa doing?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.
She got some kind of Internet home sales kind of job. Couple kids.
Couple kids. Who's the husband?
He walked out on her, if you really want to know.
But what do you care, man?
You were married, like, five minutes.
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?
Well, it's, uh...
I'm... I'm...
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days and nights, if you really want to know.
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.
Just this once.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.
Brother,
I am light years from that now.
I've been doing, uh, some consulting for a pharmaceutical company.
What, like some offshore lab making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.
No. This is an exclusive product that's coming on stream next year.
They've had clinical trials and it's FDA approved.
All right, just out of curiosity and that's all...
Let's see it.
What's in it?
They've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits.
And you how they say that we can only access 20 percent of our brain?
Well, what this does... it lets you access all of it.
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing into fame and fortune by taking some shiny, brand-new designer drug.
Gant. When?
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.
No, now.
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here, Eddie.
But I really... I really do want to do this again.
So, call me.
And, uh, that's on the house.
I don't want it.
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.
You're welcome.
All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.
How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.
- Smarter than anyone around her.
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie,
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie...
...vomiting on his boss's desk or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.
So who could blame Lindy for dumping me?
In the end, how much worse could it get?
I didn't want to see anybody.
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him.
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.
Like the rent's not low enough!
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon
about what this drug would do.
You could even be a bike messenger and come up with that. Really.
- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic.
Oh, my God.
Listening to her rag...
If I were tripping,
I'd jump out a fucking window.
Hello? Are you listening to me?
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!
And then, I felt it.
I was blind, but now I see.
...running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!
- What's wrong?
- What?
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating, energy-sucking piece of shit who's sponging off your husband.
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out, but my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it?
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?
How do you know I'm in law school?
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry, academically-constipated books about a dead Supreme Court justice.
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... You've been following me.
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.
How did you know that?
I'd seen it before.
Twelve years ago in college.
Sitting on the couch of a TA
I was trying to make,
waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom,
hoping she'd have a condom.
Somehow my unconscious had served that up.
A memory I had never even recorded.
Or was it there the whole time and all I needed was the access?
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
Well, who asked you?
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot, which sort of gives credence to the theory that one of the clerks he had fired actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions.
You could Google the clerk's sons, they'd love to talk to you.
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you something that no one else has...
Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article,
some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes,
mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.
- She didn't have a chance.
- So, what are your suggestions?
We'd really worked on her paper, too.
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.
Home. But it couldn't be my home, could it?
Who would live like this?
Torch it.
But saner heads prevailed.
What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it,
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours, hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?
What was this? A drug for people who wanted to be more anal retentive?
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.
I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.
In short... I was back.
But, something remained.
You're kidding.
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.
- Yes.
- Written by you.
All you have to do is read three pages.
Just read three pages in the next hour and...
...if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.
OK.
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
Call me.
It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.
OK, how did you do this?
I'd really like... Just call me the minute you get in. Call. OK?
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra.
It's not a good time, Eddie.
Uh, hey, Vern, I really just need to talk to you.
Hey... Oh...
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.
Vern, who did this to you?
Trust me, you don't want to know.
Uh...
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.
But the boys in the kitchen are calling it NZT 48.
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...
That doesn't sound very FDA-approved, Vern.
FDA-approved, that's a laugh. You didn't really believe that shit, did ya?
OK, so what do we have here?
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug
scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere
given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years.
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.
All right, we'll talk about it, but I, uh, need a favor first.
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now, so,
I was wondering if you could pop down to the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.
And maybe grab a little... a little breakfast for us.
He knew he had me.
Sure.
From now on,
I'd happily be his errand boy.
Wash his windows, scrub his toilet...
...anything I could do to get my hands on that little clear pill
that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.
Vern?
Vern?
Vern... on, Vern.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, I need to report a...
...a murder.
7B, yes.
OK, I won't.
Took them forever. And the longer
I stood there, the clearer I saw.
Vern had known whoever had done this.
And one guess what they'd been looking for.
But had they found it?
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.
Police Department!
Open the door, please!
Police Department! Open the door!
Open the door, please!
Police! Open the door!
Let's go! Open the door!
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!
I called you guys!
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just actually ran into him on the street
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?
He... Uh, I don't know. He was, um...
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques. Um...
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...
- ...chairs and stuff.
Like, you know, like curlicue leg things.
Yeah?
That is correct. An Edward Morra.
He's here.
Victim's sister.
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.
- Eddie?
- Melissa?
- You were there?
- Um...
Just before. I had run into him on the street and, uh... yeah.
Oh, God. I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff.
I'd better not say any more.
No, no, that's probably a good idea.
So, uh... We should probably, uh, meet or something, right?
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else. I just...
We can't meet, OK?
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then.
No. I don't want that. Please don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?
- When this is over.
- OK, all right.
OK.
You know, something doesn't gel here.
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.
Worth the risk?
What would you do?
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation,
enabled me to finish the book in four days.
A tablet a day
and what I could do with my day was limitless.
I learned to play the piano in three days.
Math became useful.
And fun.
I'm all in.
Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent.
So that Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
There's no arguing with you.
This was great.
So, Mom, I've been doing a little research on Aunt Helen's tumor.
And it's totally clear that anybody with familial adenomatous polyposis should be supplementing platinum-based doublet regiments with eicosapentaeonic acid.
I suddenly knew everything.
About everything.
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?
There aren't. Because there are no safeguards in human nature.
We're wired to overreach.
Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world.
Portugal with this big massive navy.
All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms.
- And the Brits?
Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits.
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well."
We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account.
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.
"Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest."
- Yeah.
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.
Everything I had ever read, heard, seen was now organized and available.
Here it is. Here you go.
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you.
OK, Kevin.
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.
The beach was not nearby.
All my fear, all my shyness, gone.
They've done four basic trials...
But mere lounging wasn't enough.
Only problem?
If I wasn't moving forward,
I felt like I was going to explode.
Come up here because it's beautiful, right?
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Ah!
And then I began to form an idea.
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.
It was much bigger than that.
But it would take money to get there.
In a down market, no one was making much.
But no one had NZT.
In an optimistic scenario, gains of that nature merely would reflect
growth in the economy and would not pose an obstacle...
Armed with Vern's last $800
I made 2,000 in a day.
Next day, 7, 500.
It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.
But banks weren't lending to guys like me.
Hey, Liev.
That's your man in the corner back there.
Yeah.
So, uh, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.
Why?
Because I don't see you before and I don't fucking like you already.
Why do I give you $100,000?
Because...
...I quintupled my money four days in a row.
So you got a fix on the game.
No, not a fix.
I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms.
If you look at column four, this was the first...
You're good.
OK, it's a fix.
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught.
What are you gonna do then?
Well, it's not as if I have a black book with your name in it, if that's what you're talking about.
And besides, I get the strong feeling that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?
I cut you at waist.
Peel your skin up over your head and tie knot in it.
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.
- OK.
- Good luck.
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage
two and a half times your cash at the day trading firm.
I'd been upping the dose for over a week.
It seemed to cut my /earning curve.
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.
But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into.
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.
I was jacked in. Booted up.
At the end of the week, my brokerage account
contained over two million dollars.
Word quickly got out.
You have 19 messages.
Four job offers, my bank raising my line of credit,
a reporter from the New York Post.
Really call me back, Mr. Morra.
No one makes money that fast.
This article's gonna get written with or without you.
And finally,
Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.
Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss and, well, the impossible happened, bud.
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?
Since when do you speak Italian?
Oh.
Self-improvement month.
I guess somebody gave me a wake up call.
I hope you didn't do it for me.
No, I just wanted to apologize to you, Lin.
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all.
The real question is, why did you ever put up with me?
I was in love with you.
So, when does the book come out?
Next year.
How's your new assistant?
- She's good.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.
I'm proud of you. And...
...a little intimidated.
We started up again.
Her place.
My place.
Basically every place.
"In a sizzling three days of trading,"
"the unknown Mr. Morra trumped the market,"
"prompting one top, hedge fund manager to comment""
"He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."'
OK, give me that.
Give me that!
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?
I can't. I don't have a key.
Oh, that's right.
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?
Can it be a new key?
To our place?
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.
Can I walk you to work?
Whatcha doing, hon?
Nothing.
You should sleep.
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
Eddie?
Are you OK?
What are you doing out here?
When's the last time you ate something?
There he is.
Nice article in the Post, buddy.
OK, he is on his way.
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.
One minute, your best friend, the next, you're a leper.
And he needs direct answers. Anything tentative and you've lost him forever.
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.
I'm eating, Kevin.
Hey, are you up for this?
You sure? 'Cause I got a little bit on the line here.
Have a toast point.
- It's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.
He's worth a fortune.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.
- How are ya?
- Eddie.
So, Eddie Morra.
- What's your secret?
- Medication.
I'm on special medication.
OK.
Well, it's a formula with a complex method.
But, of course, research was a component. Massive research.
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought.
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office, and you know what?
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work for a shitty little uptake?
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want in short term holdings so...
...I dispensed with all the hard statistics and I went right to the rumor mill.
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?
Sure. Share prices aren't really based on how a company works.
It's about how mass psychology works.
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.
Well, not everybody understands the patterns.
And that gave me a little bit more of an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.
So then, I went on to door number three.
Are you really implying that you have some sort of ultimate formula?
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.
You don't work in my world.
I'm up to my ass with investment guys and you don't have their half-terrified, half-cocky line of crap which is...
...not to say that
I like yours any better.
But you obviously pick your stocks in a way which I haven't seen before.
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think.
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.
Sure.
These companies aren't the question, are they?
Explain.
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence.
Control the whole power enchilada, but, no, these companies wouldn't get you there in emerging markets.
You would have to... Oh. Whoa.
This must be some big-ass merger you're contemplating.
And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon and Associates.
Who have you been talking to?
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?
Well, you're an amazing con artist, or you're a very smart young man.
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?
The whole world would have to come begging for energy like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel.
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?
Well, you don't want to hear this from some schmuck who needs a ride home.
All right, you get your shot. Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.
I'm at your disposal.
You don't really live here, do you?
Well... Spartans weren't big on amenities.
Yeah, and they eventually got their asses kicked.
I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.
There are moments in life... moments when you know you've crossed a bridge.
Your old life is over.
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.
Wall Street would provide my nest egg, but then how far could I go?
CEO? A global force?
Maybe President.
Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.
Suddenly...
It was another skip.
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?
I got another ten blocks.
And then...
...I was way uptown.
What bar was this?
...black canvas and then they would just drop all the paint...
Yeah. Did you ever meet...
...and then I actually went there and had lunch, I went back.
My friends are rolling...
I heard you like to party.
- Hey, watch it.
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!
A fight? Don't know how to fight.
Or do I?
Ah!
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.
- Like this.
Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.
If you are hit, do not stop.
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.
Off-balancing your opponent
and then using his momentum, take him down.
When it finally stopped,
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.
Is everything OK?
Call me when you get this.
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.
They were hieroglyphs.
- Hello?
- Kevin, this is Eddie.
- Eddie?
- Listen,
- I can't make the meeting today.
- What are you talking about?
I can't come in today, I'm sick.
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now.
He'll never give you this chance again.
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...
What have you been doing for the last day?
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now.
And how am I gonna look if you don't?
- I know, listen, I just...
- Sh. Listen to me.
Pull yourself together.
Get down to the meeting.
- OK, OK.
- I'll be there. I'll be there.
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.
Good to see you again.
Sit down.
What do you know about Hank Atwood?
Atwood, um...
He's an iconoclast, um...
Owns about half of Colorado.
So this is prepared, Eddie?
Uh...
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?
Where was he two years ago?
- Hm?
- Nowhere.
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar.
That was a great leap forward, right?
I'm baffled by this guy.
He comes out of nowhere so strong.
Has me on the run before I can even get to anybody in his camp.
Beats me out of two properties, investing in countries with no oil.
Places I'd never go near...
We're here in front of the hotel where a woman,
identified as Maria Winberg, was found dead in her room last night,
a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg was a well-known socialite and model...
...but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons
and an eyewitness reported seeing a man leaving the scene...
...help me convince him that I can raise his game. Got any ideas?
What do you think?
- Hm?
- Um...
...hotel has adequate security cameras...
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us.
Pardon me, one second.
Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?
Was it even me?
Eddie? This is Melissa.
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?
Because that stuff is dangerous.
Melissa?
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?
- I really need to talk to you.
- We're talking now.
No, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?
- You can't see me, Eddie.
- No, no...
- Eddie, please.
- Please, please come, please come, I...
It's important, I really need to know what you're talking about.
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.
Vernon's other clients.
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi, may I please speak with Jerry Brady?
- Jerry's in the hospital.
- He's what?
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
- Uh, no. No, he's not.
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.
Now he's in the ICU.
OK, please give him my best.
Thank you.
Of all the people I called... three were dead and the rest were sick.
Hello? Hello?
Watch it, man!
Did you see that?
Hey!
Go! Go!
Eddie.
Melissa.
Hey.
Don't tell me I look good,
'cause I know.
I didn't want you to see me this way.
You look good.
Oh, I, uh...
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.
NZT will do that to you.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
No.
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,
I was like, down the hatch.
And it was. It was amazing.
I read Brian Greene's
The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and I understood it.
My work rate increased just insanely overnight and my boss started to hate me.
They offered me his job and then... and then I got scared.
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash.
I stopped taking it.
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.
Throwing up.
So I went back to Vernon.
He told me about all the people that were dying.
How much have you been taking, Eddie?
I've been taking a lot.
Well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe...
Maybe this is a different batch.
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?
- Just finish your story.
- Well...
...I didn't take any more and I didn't die.
But after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes.
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow.
That was two years ago.
And I haven't been the same since.
Do you have some left? Good.
You go home and you take it. You take the dose down, but you don't just stop.
You'll die if you just stop.
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning.
I have to go.
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.
I have to go.
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm here now. Oh!
- Good.
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.
Check. Check.
Are you out of your mind?
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?
All right. You're right.
Look, we just need to go to a bank...
What do you got there?
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
It's something good, huh?
I feel good, man.
What's in this stuff?
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin.
You full of shit, Eddie baby.
Lindy. I wouldn't have let him in, but...
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.
I'm sick.
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...
I need you to get...
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?
They're... it's...
I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...
...has been a drug.
Well, it was supposed to be legal.
I have a... a supply stashed.
You want me to go get it.
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.
I'll go to your apartment.
It's not... in my apartment.
I moved it.
OK, so where did you move it?
In my house.
Unbelievable.
Hey, have you got it?
Yeah.
There's someone following me.
Are you sure?
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me and he's making every turn I'm making.
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?
Babe, what's happening?
We're stopped dead.
He's getting out.
Eddie, he's walking over here.
Lindy?
Oh, God!
Ow!
Help! Help!
This man's...
This man's chasing me!
He followed me from my building. I don't know him.
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone.
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?
What are you doing, man?
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?
I'm stuck. He'll find me.
OK, stop talking. Don't move.
- He killed two guys.
- What?
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...
Can he see you?
No.
Not yet.
I don't know what to do.
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills.
Why?
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife.
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds.
And you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.
He's getting closer.
Lindy, I love you.
Hey!
Now turn to me...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Ah!
- Daddy!
Ah!
Eddie. Here.
It's gonna be OK.
We've got to get out of here. Eddie?
You OK?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again,
'cause I can take care of us now.
I'm sure you can.
I can make us safe.
I'm back, OK?
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.
No. It's not you.
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.
I wasn't, when I was on it.
I did things I would never do.
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.
Yes, they were.
No, the way it works...
I know how it works. I get it.
I totally get it.
You feel invincible.
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine.
The things we'll be able to do.
Where we'll be a year from now.
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live.
Well, you might have to live it without me.
Look, I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and that... To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it.
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...
Look, I have a plan. I swear.
I'm gonna get off it.
OK.
I hope you do.
Looking for me?
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?
I was under the impression our business was settled.
I want some more of that stuff.
Or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.
This guy was not going away.
A few pills would buy me some time.
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.
Until I found a more... permanent solution.
Unless you see a real threat, I never want it known that I have any security.
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me.
Never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself.
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't The Matrix.
You have to know, Eddie,
I wrote you off.
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.
You're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die.
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.
I mean, I didn't know who or what
I was talking to.
A hundred and five. That's who you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
Mmm-hm.
I sent over my revised projections.
I didn't ask for your projections.
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...
I already have.
As a matter of fact...
...I fired a few people over your projections.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You're relieved that you know things my team missed.
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...
Two months after I'd started NZT,
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them.
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent.
That makes both of us very happy campers.
I found that if
I maintained an even dose,
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,
the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?
In this jacket?
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.
Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out.
Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, yes, but, the exact method of delivery to the brain... Darts at a dartboard.
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six.
I found that we can cut costs
30 percent and, um...
Excuse me one second.
I thought we straightened this out,
Detective.
This isn't about Vernon Gant,
Mr. Morra.
What is this about?
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person.
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.
Enter Morris Brandt... the most lethal lawyer in New York.
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.
Just between us, were you there?
I don't remember.
I don't want to make concessions to you...
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood
had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out.
How do you know this?
The governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course, information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought.
Go on.
If you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008, five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice.
Jesus, he looks frail.
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?
When this is over? I don't know.
You haven't given me the answer.
You haven't asked the question.
Well, given the scale of my contribution, let's say 45.
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.
You know, Eddie...
...it may be on your mind that you're not gonna continue to work for me any more.
This has been the learning experience of my life.
I hope it has. I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me.
On to the next.
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.
That you would even think that would only show me how unprepared you are to be on your own.
- I mean, you do know you're a freak.
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance, or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote your life script, a gift not earned.
You do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers.
You're careless with those powers.
You flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund.
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs.
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers. You haven't done the time in that first marriage to the girl with the right father.
You think you can leap over all in a single bound.
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way to a seat at that table. You don't know how to assess your competition because you haven't competed.
Don't make me your competition.
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you.
You'll be wanting a few toys.
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.
What I needed was a bunker.
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance,
vault grade pneumatic doors.
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system.
A fortress with a hell of a view.
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.
I'll take it.
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.
- Next week, you can go fuck yourself!
Not that you'd feel anything.
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police.
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.
Getting smarter!
Obviously, this could not go on,
but there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can't solve.
And tomorrow at nine,
Atwood would sign the papers.
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?
There was all last night to tell us that.
- Anything?
- I'll call him again, sir.
OK, the decision could have changed. That makes sense.
The discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.
Oh, based on your charts and projections.
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick.
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible.
Of course.
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning.
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests.
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract.
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.
I realize this is a useless platitude, but if there's anything that we can do, please don't hesitate to tell us.
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible, Mrs. Atwood.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.
There won't be a proxy.
No, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?
Well, he'd better get better.
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.
Well, why be surprised?
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?
At /east I had some.
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.
Only my money. And my liberty.
I've been all over with them.
We can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line up.
OK.
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get.
It's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.
Who was out there?
The woman's husband?
A hotel maid?
Was this how it was all going to end?
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?
I did.
...market's been mixed today.
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that.
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
Have you been talking to anyone?
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.
I know you're not stupid, Eddie, but don't make the classic smart person's mistake.
Thinking no one's smarter than you.
Where the hell have you been? This is the second time you've turned to vapor.
I was in the building, I was getting coffee. Why, has there been movement?
Yeah, there's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.
He wasn't playing us.
He's dying.
What do you know about this?
I was less than usually equipped to answer.
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.
Excuse me.
You're not excused.
What? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?
Was it Brandt or someone else?
The police station?
A coatroom?
Mr. Morra.
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?
Hope not, so let me know when you know.
All right, I'm gonna ask you again,
Eddie. What do you know about this?
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.
What? What about Atwood?
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo.
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!
What you're about to say is bullshit.
I know there's something you're hiding from me.
I smell it on you. Right now,
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!
Carl.
Eddie! Eddie!
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,
more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.
None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.
This is a difficult time.
We would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.
We're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests
and hoping for the best.
Thank you.
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.
Open up.
Come on.
Open the door.
And so, here I am.
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.
But this choice would at /east be mine.
But we're instinctive creatures.
We want to live.
So my foggy brain tried to remember where one tablet of NZT might be.
It was possible.
And possible was enough.
Hey, Eddie.
Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?
I don't like being down to this last one.
You don't even know how to use it.
You don't appreciate it.
You see, I dissolve in a solution.
You shoot it. It goes straight into the blood and brain.
Lasts much longer.
So...
You gonna tell me where the rest is?
I'm plumb out.
You know, these guys are gonna find it.
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.
Question is, which is gonna come first?
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?
This is a waste of my time, you know?
I'm getting out of this side of the business.
I'm branching out.
I'm starting import-export company.
Very exciting stuff.
I got a lot on my plate.
You're lucky I'm here.
Back in the old times, I might peel your skin back. Fillet you.
"Fillet." It's a nice word.
I didn't know this before.
Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary.
But then I discovered this thing, Google.
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?
I had no idea.
I don't believe it.
I gotta see this for myself.
I'm dubious. It's another nice word.
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too.
Don't worry, everything's sterilized.
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang.
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie.
What?
- Ah!
Not much of a triumph, was it?
Because I would die here, too.
Only NZT could help me and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream.
Victor!
What?
Ah!
Hey!
Ah!
Ah!
Victor?
Victor?
Victor?
The police would later note
that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.
Of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.
And the night was still young.
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss.
I know I certainly am.
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, trying to save his life, why is he dead?
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in with his life-saving medication?
His boss was dead.
So, I didn't matter now.
But he did not appreciate that Morris
Brandt had kept the pills for himself.
And it was all still possible.
Actually, no, there's no more tickets.
Yeah, I know. An overbooked fundraiser.
That's a first.
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.
Oh, that's much better.
- Great job.
- Thank you, sir.
Hi, Mr. Morra.
Edward!
I think we're looking at a second overflow event.
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think they're even gonna try a second debate.
- Great.
- Hold on.
A guy from
Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.
Give him his two crappy little minutes.
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.
Finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on.
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.
What a surprise. They told me somebody from Eiben was coming.
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm moving out of the energy business.
Come on. That's like Hef moving out of the mansion.
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.
No. No. Well, they really keep me hopping here.
Well, it's gonna pay off,
Senator Morra.
The Senate. Who knows...
Everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain.
Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.
We could have been partners.
So, Eiben makes NZT.
Well, it'll never officially exist.
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you.
Oh, I think maybe you do.
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get any more.
You sure about that?
They shut down your lab this morning.
Eddie. I just want to help you, that's all.
Keep you supplied.
No disruption in service.
Give you peace of mind.
That's all.
And in return, I do what?
Get a little advice, maybe.
I won't be bothering you much at first.
And later. What are you gonna be bothering me with?
Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.
But hey, I think they're achievable.
And what if I don't like your ideas?
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light.
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even go there right now.
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...
...and healthy. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.
After you, Senator.
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.
Give us a second.
What are you doing? Do you want to be President of the United States
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.
You don't think some smartass on NZT might have two or three or even four labs?
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.
I thought better of it.
See, once you know what's in it, you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.
I'm off it, Carl.
Well, on it or off it, there's no scenario where you're not working for me.
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?
Last year you traded
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?
Blank checks from Dubai.
Dumping in Chile. Disappeared officials.
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.
There's no way you can be making accusations like that and be walking around alive.
That you would even think that shows me how unprepared you are to fight me.
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?
That I kept absolutely nothing?
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be.
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.
He has 60 feet to stop.
He doesn't have room.
- What van?
I see everything, Carl.
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else.
What makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?
How do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?
What are you doing? You get your hands off me. What are you doing?
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're gonna need to get that replaced.
But you already knew that.
You know, you should really be glad about this.
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch.
Maybe we should cool off.
Talk again.
I don't think so.
Don't forget to vote.
Edward.
You good?
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.
- How's your day going?
- Ah. I've had better.
I still can't deal with that haircut.
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street.
Well, I'm a new man.
I've already ordered.
What?
ENGLISH US - PSDH
Call me Martin.
I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.
Things a boy shouldn't see.
But... I'm not a normal
boy anymore.
And it ain't a normal world.
Get used to it.
That's what Mister tells me.
We live by his rules
or we die.
Or worse.
We die and we come back.
But let's begin at the beginning.
I was like any other kid,
I had a family.
I went to school,
I didn't believe in the boogey man.
But then the world
woke up to a nightmare.
...Stay in your homes
and not to travel by night.
Route 22...
Maybe we should wait.
We'll take the back roads, you'll be safer there.
No. Martin, come back!
Hey!
Martin!
Cooper!
Cooper!
Cooper...
Cooper...
Cooper!
Martin, run!
Mom!
Shh! Shh!
You wanna live boy, you listen to me.
You scream,
I'll break your neck.
They're dead!
There's nothing to be done about it but kill that thing.
Can you shoot?
You shoot me
I'll fuckin' kill you!
...A 24 hour hotline
for missing persons
attributed to the outbreak
has been set up on
a county by county basis.
Phone lines in all areas
have been flooded in.
Officials ask for patients as
recovery teams are doing
all they can to maintain order
on the east coast...
...I repeat, do not venture outside
after sundown.
Stay in your homes and
lock the doors and windows...
Get a fuckin' hammer!
I only got two hands, boy.
Do it!
Save him...
One day you'll learn not to dream at all.
Get your shit.
Welcome to Stake Land, kid.
Months passed
in a blur of days and nights.
We traveled east and west,
but always north.
Away from death.
We avoided the cities.
Mister said they were the worst,
hit the hardest in the beginning.
As people flocked together
for safety,
the plague marched through
their locked gates
and they became death traps.
When Washington fell, it was over
for America as we knew her.
As government blew away,
our great leaders ran for it.
And hope was abandoned.
We were on our own now.
Me and Mister.
Traveling through a ruined land.
Pockets of civilization survived.
Towns locked down behind fences
and guns holding the night away.
Cults spread like wildfire
across the southern states.
Waitin' for the messiah,
but he never came.
Death came instead.
And it came with teeth.
Dumb fuck got himself trapped.
Burnt up in the sun.
Berserker.
It's the oldest of the vamps.
Can't stake 'em in the chest.
Got a breast bone like iron.
Gotta get 'em in the base of the skull.
Vamps... function from the reptile brain.
It's like pullin' the plug on a computer.
We were all orphans.
Just lookin' for something
to hold on to.
He's a Mister.
Maybe that's why
he keeps me with him.
What's that?
Garlic oil.
Does that really work?
Don't hurt.
One strike boy.
Make it true.
Where you boys comin' from?
South.
Get outta the car.
Did you get any?
They alright boys, let 'em roll.
Another town,
another lockdown.
People just tryin' to go on.
Hopin' they'd wake up
and it would all be a bad dream.
They could go back to their lives,
families and careers.
He needs more fresh food.
And some vitamins, if you can find them.
Where's his folks?
Dead.
He'd be better of here.
With people.
Other children.
What do I owe you?
I could use all of them.
Good.
Hey.
Got any liquor in this town?
Jake's.
Homemade, mostly.
We got some tap beer.
Little sour, but it won’t kill ya.
Boy needs a haircut.
Sheriff said take whatever you need.
It's on me.
Have you been through Haggerstown?
I had family there.
Vamped out, everything south of here.
Rea?
He really kills 'em, huh?
You gotta get 'em in the heart.
Pierce the breast plate.
You got any gum?
Yes.
Cool.
Ah, just...
So who are you?
His helper.
Where are you, uhh... where are you guys headin'?
North.
Uh, Mister says less population, less bloodsuckers.
Wait, wait, wait...
Not New Eden right?
We had a fella, he came through here.
He said there's nothing there, there's no food at all.
He said it's not the Vamps ya need to worry about... it's the cannibals.
Thanks.
Sometimes I think I could
stay in a place like this.
Make friends,
live in the daylight.
Just be a kid.
But the truth is
I don't feel safe around people.
They can think what they want
but New Eden was real.
It was the answer to all of this
and we were gonna find it.
Fight our way north,
make the open territories.
Like Mister says.
'Live free or die tryin'.
Fuck the cannibals.
What's her name?
I didn't ask.
Why did this happen?
How can God let this happen?
How can this be his love...
Oh... oh, God!
Oh... oh, God!
It's okay, lady.
- No! No!
- Shh. Shh.
It's okay!
- No! No!
- It's alright!
No!
It's okay. It's okay. it's okay, it's okay.
Mister,
where'd all that
hate come from?
I never asked.
Those men that...
They said they were Christians.
We don't do history.
Doesn't do anybody any good.
Grab them traps, boy.
Give me a finger.
Time to go fishin'.
Get the long pole.
Sister Agitha.
We thought she was dead.
She is.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill that thing.
Go with God.
Lock the door.
Newbie.
Shouldn't be too hard.
Too fat, I can't break the spine.
You missed the heart ya, dumb shit.
Fuckin' vamps!
Stop it!
Mister dug a grave.
I think he felt bad
for the sister.
He did pull the fangs out, but...
he waited till she went
to pick the flowers.
How many of those things have you killed?
Not enough.
And people?
Those two men?
In my book, rapists got no place to live.
It's not ours to judge.
Then don't.
Next lockdown, we drop you off.
You go save some souls.
And what about him?
He's just a boy.
Yeah.
A live one.
But we never dropped her off.
Where was she gonna go?
Satan's soldiers
march the night,
but God has not abandoned us.
Those who believe in him
shall never fall.
Jesus and the angels are
coming and judgment is upon us
and the Christian Army of Aryans
are here to fight for you.
And have created a safe refuge
for the holy among us.
Join us brothers and sisters,
Lafayette Valley welcomes
the righteous and the pure.
Together we shall lead
the world back to the light.
And the right,
the America God loves.
In desperate times,
false gods abound.
People put their faith in the loudest
preacher and hope they're right.
But sometimes they're wrong.
Dead wrong.
My name is Jebedia Loven.
And you killed two of my men.
In cold blood.
Staked one in the back.
He was my son.
My own boy.
He was only sixteen.
He cried for his mother for three hours before he died.
God rest his soul.
Now you a fine lookin' young buck.
That's your father?
My father's dead.
Oh, don't you worry.
We'll get you some religion.
Bring you to God and the right way.
Good stock.
You'll still serve.
As for you, Mister.
Oh, yeah.
We know who you are.
You kill them that come back, them that serve us, them that God brought down to do his work.
Leavin' us to purify the blood of our fathers.
And when that day comes, he will bring them back in peace and purity will reign on the earth.
Forever!
Amen!
Amen!
What do you have to say for yourself, sinner?
Fuck you and fuck your God.
Well...
You can tell him that yourself.
You're about to meet him.
Welcome to the Valley of Them.
Last stop for the weak of faith.
Get him out here!
Ow!
Ah, look at them.
The children of salvation.
They come at my calling.
They feed on the unfaithful.
Shh.
They say hell is cold,
Hunter.
Don't let that flame burn out.
Get back, you bloodsuckers.
How's your head?
Mister.
I'm sorry.
Go down to the creek, fill 'em up.
Bring 'em back.
Wait.
Hey, boy.
You can run if you want to.
Ain't nothing out there but sundown and them.
You won't get far.
Mister taught me
how to read the stars.
I could make my way
back to the car,
get the weapons,
find them robe-wearin' crazies
and send them back to that God
they kept talking about.
I had to keep movin'.
Had to make the car
before night came.
Mister was gone.
And out here alone
I didn't stand a chance.
Shh.
How many of them things out there?
One.
But she's really pissed off.
Make some noise.
Hey! In here!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Come and get me!
Yeah, that's right, come on!
I'm in here!
Hey, I'm in here!
Heeeey!
Come on, baby, come on, baby.
Martin.
I hate fuckin' vampires.
The Brotherhood needs
your eyes, followers.
There are evildoers among us.
This enemy of America
walks with faith.
His name is Mister and he
is traveling with a young boy.
They are armed and dangerous.
What happened?
They were last seen heading
north to Lafayetteville.
If spotted,
dispatch of them immediately.
These actions will not
go unrewarded.
We're gonna leave in the morning.
We'll have to take a back road.
Brotherhood got the rest locked down.
Let it go, boy.
Get over there.
You're gonna be crispy in the mornin'.
Come on, Willy!
Give him a hand!
Whoa!
What have ya got for trade?
Antibiotics.
Some weed.
And these.
Goddamn.
That's a big one.
What about the boy?
I ain't got no soda pop.
Give him another glass.
You fellas look like you've seen some trouble.
A little.
Vamps?
Holy rollers.
Yeah, well, we don't tolerate religion or politics in here.
Where's the next lockdown?
Just over the mountains.
Past Lafayette Valley.
But that's Brotherhood territory.
They don't take too kindly to strangers.
# ...I'll shiver the whole night through
# Her husband,
was a hardworking man
# Just about a mile from here
Thanks.
Been talk there was a hunter about.
Thought you was all dead by now.
Not yet.
# ...My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
# Tell me where
did you sleep last night.
# In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines,
# I'd shiver the whole night through.
Thank you.
We got one more for ya.
Ready, boys?
# Maria please don't leave
me now I need ya
# I'm a wanted
# There's nowhere I can go
# My up's turned down
# My luck's spun round and left me
# No I didn't see it...
Her name was Belle.
Her story was no different
from anyone else's.
Home gone.
Family gone.
Oh, and she was pregnant.
But I guess life goes on.
She wanted to get to New Eden
before the baby came.
Hi.
Scamp!
In the attic!
Do it.
Stake the bitch.
Stake the bitch!
I let her go and she'll eat your ass!
A Scamp.
That's what Mister
called the kid vamps.
She was just a kid.
And if not for Mister,
I might have become like that.
Out of the fuckin' car!
Out of the fuckin' car!
Get your hands on your head.
That's a nice shot, kid.
Fuck.
Hey, hey.
What the hell happened to you, man?
Fuckin' Brotherhood dumped me out of a truck.
For vamp bait.
This is their territory.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
I was in the Marines.
Got called back from the war when it started.
What happened with the war?
No one left to fight it.
The Middle East is gone.
Vamp land.
How did you end up here?
We were deployed to see to the evacuation to Canada.
Keep the peace.
But we couldn't contain it.
Most of their troops left, tryin' to make it home to their families.
I guess you heard the President's dead.
Which asshole's president now?
Beats me.
Way I see it, muthafuckas booked and left us with our dick in our hands.
Baby don't you cry.
Papa's gonna make sure don't...
Please help!
No!
Please!
I need a doctor.
The baby's coming.
Where the hell did you come from, girl?
I'm traveling with three men, but they can't help me.
Where are they?
Right behind you.
You should have been an actress.
What are they doing?
They've been takin' out the lockdown towns with captured vamps.
They crash the trucks into roadblocks and let the vamps do their thing.
That's what took down Washington.
Check the other one.
Howdy, Clem.
This your boy, Clem?
Shit!
Where's the woman?
Bitch run off.
We was just tryin' to protect her.
Run!
Vamps could smell blood
from miles off.
Mister knew it.
And so did Jebedia Loven.
I could tell by
the look in his eye.
We were movin' north.
Away from The Brotherhood,
skirting the Adirondacks
Less towns, less people.
Hadn't seen any vamps yet.
Mister said it was too cold for
them up here in the mountains.
They were cold-blooded.
Like reptiles.
When we hit the lowlands,
they'd be back.
If you are
receiving this signal,
you are approaching
the Strivington border.
Under protection of the
United States volunteer militia.
All those seeking asylum
will be processed and
dealt with accordingly.
Weapons will be confiscated...
You get 'em back when you leave.
Mm-hmm.
Where you comin' from?
South.
Lafayetteville.
Any trouble with The Brotherhood?
Nothin' we couldn't handle.
They renamed
their town Strivington.
Said it all.
It gave me hope for people.
It gave me hope for New Eden.
Sometimes hope is all ya got.
And it was over, like that.
All that goodness.
Shattered by some Christian crazies
droppin' vamps from the sky.
We're gonna stay right here till morning.
Fine by me.
How you doin', mama?
She's gone.
Tough old lady.
Climbed those stairs and didn't say a word.
Damn Brotherhood shit-kickers.
Ten dead.
We've got things under control now.
We'll have this place up and runnin' in no time.
Sure you won't stick around for a while?
We could use a couple good men.
No.
We're headin' north.
Stick to the back roads.
They're the only way outta here.
Brotherhood owns the rest.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
We'd come far.
We didn't know
what was waitin' for us.
But anything had to be
better than what we left behind.
At least I kept
telling myself that.
But when I close my eyes,
I kept seein' that
little girl's dead legs
stickin' out from under that tarp.
Ah, fuck.
What is it?
Fuckin' radiator.
Can you fix it?
Not this time.
She's dead.
Everybody grab your shit.
One week in the woods and
we were becoming different people.
Small talk stopped.
We worked as a pack,
each to his task.
It was cold here in the hot passes,
but we hadn't seen any vamps.
The forest cast
a kind of magic over us.
Away from people.
I stopped thinking
about the past.
And about my family.
I had found a new one.
You think we'll make it?
I'm just worried about the girl.
She's slowin' us down.
There's no wind.
Berserkers.
Run!
Come on!
We gotta run now, let’s go.
Move!
She's comin'!
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?!
What are you doin'?!
We gotta go!
Keep movin'!
- Please, Please. We gotta move.
- I need one second!
Sister?
I got you, I got you.
Just a little bit further.
Come on, keep moving.
She's comin'!
Keep going.
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go faster.
Come on, you fuckers.
The Lord is my strength.
My Lord is my...
Father, forgive me.
Martin, let's go.
I don't think she's coming, Martin.
Come on.
We've been travelin' for days
now and hadn't seen a soul.
It was like people
had just disappeared.
But Mister wasn't
takin' any chances.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm just getting old and scary.
You okay?
Oh, yeah...
Baby just kicked, I'm okay.
Here, give me your hand.
- Wanna feel?
- Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Let me check that out.
Here, give me your hand, wait.
That kid's got a strong kick.
She's like, "Let me out,
I wanna meet everybody."
Wake up.
Get your boots on and your guns ready.
Willie's missin'.
Something's dead.
It's fresh.
Jesus! Fuck...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, my God...
Come on. Come on.
- Come on. We have to go.
- I can't.
Come on.
From now on you keep your weapons close and ready.
That thing took Willie away to kill him.
He got around our traps.
What are you saying?
This one uses its brain.
I've seen a lot of mutant vamps but I ain't never seen a thinker before.
We were entering the lowlands.
New Eden was just beyond
the mountains.
We were getting close.
But so far
no sign of anything...
Alive anyway.
- You okay, girl?
- I...
I have cramps.
My back hurts really bad.
I just...
I just need to sit for a minute.
I'm sorry.
- We gotta keep movin'.
- I can't.
It's okay.
I got you.
You okay?
My daddy used to carry me like this when I was little.
I'm not your daddy.
You ain't such a hard ass, you know.
Let her sleep.
She needs it.
At daylight were gonna put some distance between us and this place.
What are we gonna do when the baby comes?
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
This way. It's close.
That's her.
That's her.
Wait.
It's leadin' us, boy.
Tough shit.
Drink up, boy.
I am a vengeful god.
Eye for eye.
Tooth for tooth.
Son for son.
This is between me and you, you bloodsuckin' son-of-a-bitch.
When you left me for them,
I prayed.
I prayed and God listened.
So when they came for me, the hungry ones,
I gave my blood, willingly, hunter.
Thank you.
I am your God now.
Yah.
Nice try, child.
Try this, you fucker.
'Bout time you learn how to drive.
Almost there.
Almost.
'Almost' is a big word.
Fuck.
Hold it right there!
Don't move.
Thank you.
You boys look like hell.
Shit happens.
Yeah, sure does.
But like my mom used to say,
"Things are what they are.
Get used to 'em."
Smart woman.
She owned this place.
Last stop before the wilderness.
Buried her out back and
I've been on my own ever since.
Except for them.
It's good shootin'.
Lots of practice.
I'm gonna take a look around.
What's your name?
Martin.
I'm Peggy.
It's been a long time since I seen a boy.
Come on.
You gotta wait 'til it's in the lot.
What's wrong with it?
They're runnin' out of food so they're... skinnier but meaner.
It smells us now.
Oh shit.
It's Walter again.
I went to high school with him and I haven't been able to get a clean shot.
He was such an asshole.
I'll get him.
Martin!
No, stop!
Get in here.
What are you doing?
Martin!
"The Book of Eli"
You hungry?
You know you've got to come get it, don't play hard to get.
You will like it.
It's cat...
There you go.
Leave room for breakfast.
I can think of younger days
when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told
about the sorrow
How can you mend
a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain
 from falling down?
How can you stop
the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
Hello?
Hello?
Please... don't hurt me.
Here, take anything you want.
Frozen food.
Take it.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Yeah?
That's what the last guys said.
Could you help me?
The wheel came off.
I can't fix it.
Maybe if I... if I could... but I can't.
The only good thing about no soap
Is that you can smell hijackers a mile off.
I am impressed!
This lad... smelled us... from thirty feet away!
What does that say about our hygiene?
What you got there in that pack?
What pack?
He's got a gun.
Well shit, it ain't loaded.
They never are.
Ain't that right, old man?
Open the pack and tip it out on the road, nice and slow.
Can't do that.
Take off the fucking pack... and put it on the ground... or die!
Are you listening to me?
- I am now.
- Good.
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.
Good.
Put that hand on me again, and you wont get it back.
Can you believe this fucking guy?
Alright, we will do it the hard way.
Why did you do that?
Did you cut my hand off?
What are you standing around for?
Kiss him!
What did he say?
He's in shock.
I think he meant
"Kill him".
I told you you weren't gonna get that back.
Yeah, you did.
Who are you?
Where's your water?
They have none, they were gonna take you up, and then eat you.
It's true.
It's in the cart.
You gonna take any?
- Where are you going?
- West.
- Can I come with you?
- No.
No!
Woah, woah, woah...
Where are you going?
Stay on the path.
No!
Stay on the path, it's not your concern.
Stay on the path, it's not your concern.
- I don't know you.
- I'm not from around here.
No shit. Who are you?
I don't want any trouble.
Okay.
- Just a customer, okay?
- Okay.
I'm sorry I gotta see the hands.
I'm not one of them.
Okay.
I'm gonna take something out of my pack.
Take your finger off the trigger.
Oh, sweet. That's a Phantom 900, man.
Is it?
I haven't seen one of those since the 90's.
Yeah, I got it back east.
- Does it still work?
- Yeah, just need a charge, can you do that for me? A charge.
I got cables.
I don't need cables,
I can charge it for you, if you got the coin.
Yes I do.
- It's American.
- Oh yeah.
I got a whole bunch of these.
How about Chapstick, got any Chapstick?
No Chapstick.
I got cat oil.
- Fresh cat oil.
- No, no.
It's good, it's good for... works the same way.
What about toys, got any toys?
No, I don't play.
Oh, I got...
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Okay, alright.
I'll have this, with these.
Oh, absolutely, those are yours.
Okay, give me a couple of hours.
- I'll charge it up for you
- Thank you.
You can wait over there, across the street.
- No, I'm good.
- Bar is about to open.
I'll wait here.
You dont trust me, do you?
- I'll wait here.
- Alright.
Carnie, one of the road crews just pulled into town.
They got something for you.
- Books?
- A whole pack of them.
Tell them I wanna see them. Right now.
We did good.
The one you want.
It ain't there?
No.
I just dont understand.
That's a shitload of books.
You don't have to understand.
I understand.
Leave that to me and we can be friends.
I have faith in you, you will find it.
Ah, wait!
I got this too.
Oh, now this is a treat.
It's a schampoo.
Go get slammed.
Get some pussy.
On me as much as you and your boys can stand.
Then go back on the road.
Then we'll get you your book!
Of that I have no doubt.
You're sending guys out that can't even read to look for one book.
No wonder they never find anything. unless you'd like to go with them.
- What about these?
- Burn them.
The place across the street.
They got any water?
They have if you can pay for it.
Here. Smell this.
One of the road crews found it.
Who knows...
Might be the last schampoo on the planet.
And it's all yours.
Did they find your book?
No.
Outlander?
Let me see.
- Alright, what will it be?
- Water.
That's the good stuff.
I gotta eat into my own rations to sell, so it don't come cheap.
That will get you maybe half way.
Solara!
Get this and get it filled.
Wait. You need this.
Can you please move?
Thank you.
That was my cat.
Fine specimen.
I saw you knock him off the bar.
No, I kinda shoo'd it,
I didnt really knock it.
You raised your hand at him.
Won't happen again,
I promise you.
Hey Martz, how about another drink?
That cat's been coming in here for 2 years.
It's got more right to be here than you.
I don't want any trouble.
That's too bad, cause you...
I know who you are.
Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.
You are going to be held in account for the things you've done, do you know that?
It's okay.
I'm gonna grab my things, and walk out of here.
- Alright, brother?
- Yeah.
Cursed be the ground, for our sake.
Of thorns and thistles, it shall bring forth, for us.
For out of the ground we were taken for the dust we are.
And to the dust we shall return.
Stop!
Please.
Redridge!
Redridge.
- And who are you?
- Nobody.
Oh, I doubt that.
The men you killed in my bar.
They were nobody.
- But you now...
- He ain't got the shakes.
He ain't one of them.
Good. This is a civilized town.
We don't eat humans.
We don't see too many people from before.
Not anymore.
- Do you read?
- Every day.
How good for you.
Me too.
You know whats funny?
As old as we are, people like you and me, we're the future.
What do you want with me?
Straight to the point.
I like that.
You're not just educated.
I never saw anyone handle themselves the way you did
I dont know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it.
It's a little town, just the beginning.
Im about to expand,
I need expert help,
I could use someone like you.
Thank you. But I'm really not interested.
People who work for me live better than any worker dreamed.
Ask Redrige, here.
Ask the boys, anyone.
Real beds, hot food, women.
Clean water.
You could do a lot worse, my friend.
Thank you.
But I got somewhere
I need to be.
Where?
West.
There is nothing west.
I've been told different.
By who?
Tell you what.
Stay the night.
Try a little of our hospitality, see how you like it.
We'll talk again in the morning.
Word of advice, Walker.
It's not a choice.
There's always a choice.
There'll be someone outside your room all night.
- If you need anything.
- I dont need anything.
You never know.
This is for you. It's water for washing and some food, some special dessert too, compliments of the house.
I need you to take this or say something, so I can find you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Can I get you anything else?
No, I'm fine, thank you.
You get blinded in the war?
I was born this way.
I think probably I'm lucky because I was already used to being like this by the time it happened.
Well, thank you, for the food.
You're welcome.
I like your perfume.
It's just shampoo.
But thank you.
Good night.
I don't think he'll change his mind by the morning.
He's not gonna stay.
He's different than the others.
You're not gonna be able to make him do what you want him to do.
Who said anything about me?
I'll send Solara.
You can't do that.
It's about time I got better use out of her.
Dont... Please.
Please, dont. Please.
Can I come in?
Give me a minute.
Somebody already came with food and water.
I got everything
I need.
Are you sure about that?
It's really bright in here.
- I'm Solara.
- Right
You filled my canteen downstairs.
Yeah. You're that
Walker, right?
Right.
If you're worried about paying its on the house.
Paying for what?
Why don't you take a seat?
No.
No, I can't go.
If I do he will hurt my mom.
- Who?
- Carnegie.
- He's your father?`
- No
We belong to him just the same.
I'll sleep on the floor.
Tomorrow you can tell him you had a good time. I promise,
I will be no trouble.
Please.
Knight to b4.
Your move.
- So... how old are you?
- Excuse me?
I havent really seen too many people your age come through here before.
Well, it's been...
30 winters since the flash.
I really dont remember.
Do you remember what it was like?
- In the world before.
- Yeah
What was it like?
People had more than they needed.
We had no idea what was precious and what wasn't.
We threw away things that people would kill each other for now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You have a book.
Can I see it?
No, you cannot.
I just want to look at it.
I can't even read, please let me just see it.
What is with you?
It is just a book.
It's not just a book.
What do you mean it's not just a book?
No more questions about the book, okay?
No more questions.
I got a question for you, since you're here.
Maybe I'll answer it, maybe I won't.
Where do you get your water?
I can't tell you that.
You can't tell me or you dont know?
Oh, I know.
But if you're not talking about the book,
I'm not talking about the water.
Alright, I got another question for you.
Great.
Yeah, there's a lot of food there.
More than I can eat.
Tell you what. We can share it, like old people used to.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Wait a minute.
Sit.
Sit down.
Give me your hands.
What are you doing?
Trust me, give me your hands.
Close your eyes.
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.
We thank you for a warm bed and roof over our head on cold nights, such as this.
- It's gone too long.
- Is this from the book?
Close your eyes.
We thank you for the gift of companionship, in hard times like these.
Amen.
Now we eat?
Now we eat.
Morning, Solara.
How was your night, did you sleep well?
- I did what you said.
- Of course you did, but I said:
Did it work?
- Is he staying?
- We didn't talk much.
Solara, honey, eat something.
Mom, give me your hand.
Close your eyes.
Mom, trust me.
Dear Lord.
We thank you for our food.
Thank you for my mother.
Thank you for the roof over our heads.
And...
Well I guess thats all for now.
Amen.
That's the word you're looking for.
Amen.
That's how you stop.
You said you didn't talk much.
But did he do any reading?
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.
You shut your mouth.
Stop!
You're hurting your mother, Solara.
He said he read every day. Did he?
Your mother, would like you to talk.
I dont know!
I dont know.
Yes, okay. Yes, he was reading.
What kind of book was he reading?
I don't know, an old leather one.
And?
I don't know, it had some thing on the front.
Tell me.
I need you to let her go.
Show me!
Redridge!
Shit! I stayed up all night.
Where is he?
I dont...
I just want to make sure...
...there's no acid in there.
Doesn't matter, just take these off.
- Take them off.
- Let me dry...
- Hey!
- Alright!
Thank you. You can tell them I made you do it.
- Say it.
- You made me do it.
Is that thing loaded?
I don't think it's loaded.
Only one way to find out.
Look, I need that book.
I mean I want the book. And you.
If you make me choose,
I'll kill you,
I'll take the book.
Why, why do you want it?
I grew up with it.
I know its power.
And if you read it, then so do you.
That's why they burned them all after the war.
Just staying alive is an act of faith, building this town is an even bigger act of faith. But they don't understand that.
None of them do.
And I dont have the words to help them, but the book does.
And I admit...
I've had to do things, many many things,
I hate to ***,
I confess that.
But if we had that book,
I wouldn't have to.
Can you imagine how different, how righteous this little world could be if we had the right words for our faith.
The people would truly understand why they're here and what they're doing, they wouldn't need any other uglier motivations.
It's not right to keep that book hidden away, it's meant to be shared with others.
Meant to be spread.
Isn't that what you want?
Of all my heart and soul.
I always believed that
I'd find a place where this book belongs, where it was needed.
Well, I haven't found it yet.
I love this guy.
I love this guy.
Shoot him. Please.
What are you standing around for?
Take him out, god damn it!
I don't like being followed.
I wanna come with you.
- Are you dumb?
- I hate it here.
Then change it.
My mother thinks I'll be safer with you.
I'll take you to where we get our water.
You can have all that you can carry.
I mean all that we can carry.
Carnegie knows about two more springs up North.
He says he's gonna build more towns.
How did he know about this one?
He's been here.
When he was young.
In the world before.
I guess everyone else who knew about it died.
We really better hurry.
I think I left my glasses inside. can you take a look for me?
What are you doing?
You are such a liar.
I'm not a liar.
You said I could come with you, if you got your water.
I didn't say that, you said that.
Besides, the road's no place for you.
Much worse than you think.
Good bye, Solara.
Nice knowing you,
I mean that.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
Fuck you!
You washed your filthy fucking hands?
Twice, Sir.
With your soap.
Put a crew together, we're going after them.
- For a fucking book.
- It's not a fucking book!
It's a weapon!
A weapon that aims right at the hearts and minds of the weak and desperate.
It will give us control of them!
If we wanna rule more than one fucking town we have to have it.
People will come from all over and do exactly what I tell them if the words are from the book.
It's happened before, and it will happen again.
All we need is that book.
Then I want Solara.
Are you bargaining with me?
Is this a deal we're making?
We lost a lot of men.
You need me more than ever.
Now you say that book is worth the trouble.
Well I believe you.
But I want Solara for it.
Why not?
Why not.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Which way are we heading?
West.
Hello?
Can anyone help me?
Hello, is anybody there?
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
You go along,
I'll be okay.
- Let me just...
- No! Really, please!
I'm fine, really. I need a man to help me...
You just go along.
It's okay, it will just take a minute.
I'm fine. Please...
Help!
Get off me!
Hold them there.
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear that?
Don't move.
Take the wire off of that. Spool it up.
- What is that?
- Dinner.
It's like if he's protected somehow.
Like there's nothing that can touch him.
He's just a fucking man.
You put a bullet in him and he will go down.
Still warm.
No more than a few hours dead.
He can't be far.
Son of a bitch.
Solara.
You sure you still want her?
It's gonna be dark soon.
We can't track them at night, they'll see us coming.
We'll drive right past them and never know it.
He's right.
They're on foot. Tired.
They'll have to sleep.
We'll make up the ground tomorrow.
We'll have them before morning, Sam.
That better be a guarantee.
Do you really read the same book every day?
Without fail.
Will you read some to me?
Please.
The lord is my shepard.
I shall not want;
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters;
He restores my soul.
He leadeth me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?
- Did you write that?
- Yes I did.
- Really?
- No.
That was around a long time before you and I got here, thats for sure.
What did you mean when you said it's not just any book?
It's the only one.
Really?
After the war people made it their business to find and destroy any that the fires didn't get, some people say this was the reason for the war in the first place.
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.
How did you get it?
They said that the war, tore a hole in the sky.
You probably heard the stories.
Yeah.
Tore a hole in the sky, sun came down, and burned everything.
Everything and everybody.
You were lucky, to hole up and hide in a place like this, or underground.
Most people weren't lucky.
So, a year later we started coming out, wandering around, didn't know what to do, just trying to find a place to survive.
One day, I heard a voice.
It's hard to explain, but it was like if it was coming from inside me.
But I could hear it as clear as I can hear you.
What did the voice say?
It led me. To a place where I found the book.
Buried, under some rubble.
The voice told me to carry the book out West.
It told me a path had been laid out for me, that I'd be led to a place where the book would be safe.
Told me that I'd be protected, against anything that stood in my path.
I've been walking ever since.
And you did all that because a voice in your head told you to.
Yes, I did.
I know what I heard.
I know what I hear.
And I know I would have never made it, without help.
- What's that?
- One question too many.
Go to bed, we've got an early start in the morning.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping.
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?
I just wanted to see the book.
Nobody touches it but me, you understand?
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand. since you don't know how to read anyway, it's of no use to you.
Yeah.
So teach me.
Hold on. Hold up.
Stop!
You say you've been walking for 30 years.
Have you ever thought maybe you were lost?
No.
How do you know you're walking in the right direction?
I walk by faith, not by sight.
- What does that mean?
- It means you know something, even if you don't know something.
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't have to make sense. It's faith.
Its a flower of light, in a field of darkness, giving me the strength to carry on, understand?
Is that from your book?
No, it's Johnny Cash...
What?
Do you think anyone lives there?
I dont know.
Maybe there's water.
Stay behind me.
"No Trespassers"
This is weird.
Who are you?
Travelers, thats all.
Don't mean any harm.
No trespassing. Didn't you read the sign?
We're very sorry,
I didn't see it.
- What's your business?
- We were just...
No business.
We're very sorry, and if you let us, we'll be on our way.
George, look at them.
One of them is just a girl.
Old story. Heard it a hundred times before.
We get so few visitors these days,
George is suspicious of everybody.
I'm Martha.
Would you care for some tea?
How about some music?
It's so soothing.
George!
You can ring my bell, ring my bell.
How do you like it?
You can ring my bell, ring my bell.
- Is that good?
- Good, good.
Great.
It's amazing that you two have survived out here all by yourselves.
Well, now. George is something of a handyman.
He did a lot of work on this place, making it safe.
We may be old, but we're resilliant.
We've had more than a few trying to take this place from us, haven't we George?
Yes we have.
I wanna show you something, come on.
George, no. Not now.
Come on!
- Are these...?
- Graves? Sure.
It'd be uncivilized not to bury them.
Besides, it's good for the soil.
Come on back inside.
I might be able to rustle up some sandwhiches.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
- We gotta go now.
- They killed these people.
They didn't just kill them. They ate them.
- Their hands are shaking.
- Too much human meat.
Let's go.
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.
No. No, thank you.
- Well, we gotta be going.
- So soon?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Are you sure you won't stay?
I'm sure. Very sure.
Put the gun down.
Sorry. Take this. Open the door for us, please.
- Thank you for the tea.
- Thank you so much.
Go back inside.
George, what's wrong?
Whole company of armed degenerats, thats what, and they led them straight to us.
I just set out the good china.
Fuck the china.
Have you got any more weapons?
Weapons? I'll show you some weapons.
Come on.
We know you're in there.
Come on out and nobody needs to get hurt.
I'll make it easy.
Send out Solara with the book.
What are we gonna do?
I know what the fuck I'm doing.
Wait, wait.
They ain't coming out.
Shit! Get down!
Everybody down!
You know that voice you heard?
Did he say anything about this?
We'll get out alive.
Both of us.
What about us?
Didn't mention you.
Cease fire!
Cease fire.
Motherfuckers!
Over on the side!
Over on the side!
Fucking bastards!
Hold your fire!
- What are they doing?
- Nothing good.
Where is the book?
Check his pack.
It ain't here.
This is your last chance.
You give it up, or
I swear I'll bury you out here.
Son-of-a...
Let's try this again.
- Carnegie!
- What!?
Now. Where's the book?
Give him the book.
Please.
Don't tell him.
It's in the house.
Back of the TV.
- Go check the TV.
- The what?
You gotta be fucking shitting me. You go!
Go!
Ask and you shall receive.
God is good, is he not?
All the time.
Not all the time.
No!
You see? What did I tell you?
He's just a man.
No! Leave him alone!
Where's your protection now?
Hmm?
Pray for me.
Okay?
I mean it.
Shit.
Go back!
Come on.
Come on!
We've got enough fuel to make it back, do you want to go after her?
No.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going West.
Gotta go West.
Hey.
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
This. This is all my fault.
- No, it's not.
- Yeah it is, if I didn't come with you, none of this would have happened.
It's not your fault.
Did what I had to do.
Didn't think anything could make you give up that book.
You know, for years
I've been carrying and reading it every day.
I got so caught up with keeping it safe
I forgot to live by what I learned from it.
Yeah? What's that?
Just to...
Do for others more than you do for yourself.
It's what I got from it anyway.
Do you smell that?
- What?
- In the air. Salt.
We're getting close to the ocean.
That is good.
That's it.
Get the Engineer!
That's far enough!
What's your business here?
My name is Eli.
I have a King James
Bible in my possession.
Remain where you are.
Don't attempt to make any sudden moves, or you will be fired upon.
Be careful with it.
Thank you.
Careful with it.
Wait.
We've been doing this for a long time now.
- Feels like a museum.
- It's much more than that.
This is where we're going to start again.
We've got a printing press that will be operational quite soon.
We're going to teach people about the world they lost.
Help them start to rebuild it.
Look. Shakespear.
Britannica.
Missing only a few volumes.
There's a whole series of beautiful Mozart and Wagner records. Still in very pristine condition.
But never a Bible.
Well, not until now.
May I ask what condition it's in?
It's beat up. But it will do the job.
Do you think
I could see it?
Yes, you may.
- That's it. It's open.
- Good.
Do you have anything to write on?
Could you get us some writing paper, please?
A lot of it.
A whole lot of it.
It can't be.
It's impossible!
It can't be!
Pay close attention.
And write down everything I say.
Exactly as I say it.
The first book of Moses.
Called Genesis.
Chapter one, verse one:
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
Verse two:
"And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."
Verse three:
"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Where is Solara?
Out there.
Her choice.
I tried to bring her back. She refused.
What did you do when she refused?
Read it.
What did you do to my daughter?
Read it!
What did you do to my daughter!?
Sorry.
It's been so long
I dont remember.
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?
You have to. Please.
- Your leg.
- It doesn't hurt anymore.
I can smell it.
You worked so hard for that book.
You sacrificed so much, so many men.
More than you could spare.
Now, all those people who were too scared to even say your name.
They're downstairs, tearing up the bar right now, did you know that?
And there's noone there to stop them.
And you are feverish.
I can't imagine what it must feel like to have what you want so close and it might aswell be a million miles away.
Stop it!
Are you leaving me?
Claudia?
Claudia!?
Claudia!
Dear Lord. Thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me.
Thank you for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles on my path.
And for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost.
Thank you for your protection and for your many signs along the way.
Thank you for any good that I may have done,
I'm so sorry about the bad.
You don't have to leave, you know.
You're very welcome to stay here.
You'll be perfectly safe.
Thank you.
But this is something that I have to do.
Where will you go?
Home.
Thank you for the friend I made.
Please watch over her, as you watched over me.
Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.
I'm so very tired.
But I go now to my rest at peace.
Knowing that I've done right with my time on this earth.
HOLY BIBLE
NEW KING JAMES VERSION
I fought the good fight.
I finished the race.
I kept the faith.

Lovingly cooked by "Bake Master"
Kevin Flynn: The Grid.
A digital frontier.
I tried to picture clusters of information, as they moved through the computer.
What did they look like?
Ships, motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world,
I thought I'd never see.
And then, one day.
Sam: You got in.
Kevin: Ha, ha, ha, that's right, man.
I got in.
Kevin: And the world was more beautiful than I ever dreamed.
And also, more dangerous than I ever dreamed.
Get in bed now, come on.
Now, I met a brave warrior.
-Tron.
-Ba, ba, bom, bom, bommm.
Kevin: TRON!
Sam: He fights for the users.
Kevin: He sure does.
Oh man, he showed me things that no one had ever imagined.
Here at least. Disc battles fought in spectacular arenas.
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.
-So radical, and together,
-Sam: You built the grid.
Kevin: We built a new grid.
With programs and users.
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time.
So, I created a program in my own image.
That could think, like you and me.
And I called him,
CLU.
Codified Likeness Utility.
Kevin: That's right.
And CLU, Tron and I, we built the system where all information was free,
And hope, beautiful.
And then, one day.
Something happened.
Something...extraordinary.
A miracle.
What was it?
That'll have to wait until next time.
How 'bout I get to work.
I'm wanna go with you, Dad.
Yeah, well.
One day, you will.
I promise.
To the grid?
Good night, Sam.
All right, what do you say tomorrow, you and I hit the arcade?
You can have a crack at the old man's high score.
First games on me.
Can we play doubles?
Sam: On the same team?
We're always on the same team.
Good evening, our lead story.
ENCOM CEO and video game Icon,
Kevin Flynn.
has disappeared.
He was best known for designing Tron, and Space Paranoids.
The two best selling video games in history.
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982.
And the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry.
But things changed in 1985.
With the untimely death of Flynn's wife, the mother of his young son, Sam.
Recently ENCOM board members have been troubled by the reports of Flynn's erratic
even obsessive behavior.
With Flynn missing, the company is now in Chaos.
This afternoon ENCOM's board moved to seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley.
Vowing to return the company to profitability.
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains his belief that Flynn is not missing.
And is instead pursuing his dream of quote:
"A digital frontier to reshape the human condition".
In there is a new world.
In there is our future.
In there, is our destiny.
 Even Flynn's most ardent supporters are now acknowledging a difficult truth.
Kevin Flynn may have simply, run away.
And while Flynn's loyalists hope for his imminent return.
There is perhaps no one....
He's coming.
He promised.
Kevin's mother: Sam, you have to eat.
Let go of me.
Sam.
What will become of Flynn's legacy, and the future of ENCOM.
Will most likely depend on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy.
-SAM!
Kevin's Mother: SAM, come back.
Well that is a big door.
Welcome everybody, please settle.
I know it's late so I'll skip the pleasantries and hand things over to our chairman.
Richard Mackey
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Claire.
Tonight I am pleased to announce that
ENCOM's last fiscal year, was our most profitable, ever.
Yes.
And at midnight tonight, the 12th version of our flagship operating system will hit the shelves.
Around the world.
Richard: I'm sure it comes as no surprise, who we have to acclaim. The head of our software design team.
A man who's father own uh, notable history with ENCOM, helped make this company, what it is today.
Edward Dillinger.
Well done.
We will be making our Debut on
Tokyo's Nikkei index.
ENCOM's stock will now trade around the world.
Huh? Oh yes.
Excuse me,
Yes, Allan.
Given the prices we charge to students, schools.
What sort of improvements have been made in Flynn
I mean, uh, ENCOM O.S. twelve?
This year we put a twelve on the box.
Edward: O.S. 12 is the most secure operating system ever released.
The idea of sharing our software or giving it away for free.
Disappeared with, Kevin Flynn.
We know you're here.
Let's make this easy.
Come on, come on.
FREEZE!
Okay, if there are no more questions.
I would like you to meet, our next blockbuster.
ENCOM O.S. Twelve.
Whoa!
Just a few...bugs.
Bear with us, one second.
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, will you just stop.
For one second.
Nikkei will be open in thirty seconds.
Does anyone know where the master file is?
I do.
It's on the web.
This is mad, gotta stop this.
We've got to ring that opening bell.
How is this happening, we've got to stop this now.
No, let's just, shut it down.
-Shut it down, NOW!
-Relax.
Relax, it's under control.
Relax?
Our most valuable and most secure operating system is out there for free.
How am I suppose to explain that?
I don’t' know. Say it was all part of the plan.
A little uh, a little gift from ENCOM.
Apparently ENCOM technologies is having some...
-technical difficulties.
-No.
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?
Guard: Where are you going to run to now?
Now you don't want to do that.
Didn't anyone tell you, stealing is wrong.
Can't steal something that was designed to be free.
Now I got you.
Don't sweat it, your boss is okay with it.
-The hell he is.
-Sam: Your boss works for the CEO.
The CEO works for the shareholders.
Now do you know who the biggest shareholder is?
I don't know, some kid.
You're Mr. Flynn.
Why?
This is your father's company.
Not anymore.
Wha..., hey, hey kid.
No, NOOOOOOO!
Woo, hoo, hoo, hooo.
Yeah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
O...kay.
Hey, there he is, get him.
HEY!
No free rides.
Whoa!
No free Taxi, you pay.
Hold it right there, freeze!
Okay boys, you got me.
Hey.
Enjoy it Marv, you earned it.
Why are you in my apartment, Allen?
You don't answer your phone.
How you been, Sam?
Oh, you know, when I was twelve,
I really appreciated the surrogate father thing.
But come on, Allen.
I got it all under control.
Oh, clearly.
What is it? You want to help me with my home work?
Like old times, have a catch.
Well you got a, pretty nice view here.
Heard you did a triple axel off a roof a few hours ago?
Rough landing, huh?
Hmm, could have been worse.
I also thought your message to the board was very clever.
Oh, you like that?
Well, that was Marv's idea.
Allan, we really gonna do this again?
Do I really look like I'm ready to run a fortune 500 company?
No.
But truthfully, the companies pretty happy with where you are.
See that way they can just keep doing whatever they want.
Well I guess what I find curious is the crazy charities, the annual prank on the company.
Sure have an interesting way of being disinterested, Sam.
Why are you here, Alan?
I was paged last night.
Oh man, still rocking the pager, hey?
Good for you.
Yeah, your Dad once told me I had to sleep with it, I still do.
Page came from your Dad's office, at the arcade.
So.
So, that numbers been disconnected for twenty years.
Sam, two nights before he disappeared, he came to my house.
I've cracked it, he kept saying.
He was talking about genetic algorithms,
Quantum teleportation. He said he was about to change everything.
Uh, science, medicine, religion.
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.
He wouldn't have left you.
Al, you're the only one who still believes that.
He's either dead, or chillin' in Costa Rica.
Probably both.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I smell like jail.
Let's just reconvene in another couple of years, huh? What do you say?
Here.
These are the keys to the arcade.
I haven't gone over there, yet.
I thought you should be the one.
Alan, your acting like I'm going to find him sitting there working.
Just, "Hey kiddo, lost track of time".
Wouldn't that be something.
What?
*Here we stand*
*Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two*
*Sleepless nights*
*Losing ground,
I'm reaching for you,*
*you, you.*
*Feelin' that it's gone*
*Can change your mind*
*If we can't go on*
*To survive the tide, love divides*
*Someday love will find you*
*Break those chains that bind you.*
*One night will remind you*
*How we touched
And went our separate ways*
*If he ever hurts you*
You son of a gun.
Huh.
Sam: See you got a backdoor.
This isn't happening.
Oh man, this IS happening.
This program has no disk.
Another stray.
Wait, I'm not a program.
He actually did it.
I'm on the grid.
Does the name Kevin Flynn mean anything to you?
Be quiet if you want to live.
Programs madly chants: Game, games, the games. Not the games.
What's his problem?
Rectify.
Rectify.
-Games.
-NO!
-Please.
-Rectify.
Look I know you probably get this a lot,
But there's been a big mistake.
Games.
Please, no, no, no.
Whoa, hey!
Erase me!
AHHHHH!
No!
Can somebody tell me what the hell.
Hey, hey!
That's got a zipper.
He is different.
This can't be good.
Attention, program. You will receive an identity disc.
Everything you do or learn, will be imprinted on this disc.
If you lose your disc, or fail to follow commands.
You will be subject to immediate, deresolution.
Nearly complete. Disc activated and synchronized.
Proceed to games.
Games?
Where you going?
What am I suppose to do?
Survive.
*Techno music blasting*
Combatants, prepare for Disc Wars.
Platform eight.
I have a strange version of you on my shelf.
Combatants 3 and 11.
Disc wars.
He definitely didn't do that.
Damn it.
So that's how it is.
Combatant 11, deresolution.
I won!
Now let me out.
Combatant 3, round one, victory.
No unusual activity on the grid.
Security sweeps and patrols have been intensified.
Right to par, on schedule.
Your initiate should be fully operational within twelve cycles.
Perhaps if you were to include me, in this mission, l could be of even greater service.
Computer: Combatant's 3, and 7.
Disc wars.
Computer: Initiate
Yeah.
I'm out of this.
Combatant 3, victory.
Combatant 3, violation.
Combatant 6, deresolution.
What is that program?
Combatant three.
Violation.
Initiate final round.
Combatant 3, versus Rinzler.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Aw, come on, is that even legal?
Whoa!
Yeah!
Why do I feel like I just got dumped on.
Come on, huh?
Come on.
User.
Identify yourself, program.
I'm not a program.
Cloaked man: Identify....
My name is Sam Flynn.
Bring him to me.
Let me go.
Freaks.
Where am I?
Am I on the grid?
Who are you?
Dad.
Sam.
Look at you, man.
Look at the size of you.
How did you get in here?
I got your message.
Oh.
So it's just you?
Yeah.
Just you.
Wow, isn't this something.
Sam: You look the same.
Oh, a lot has happened, Sam.
More than you can imagine.
This.
Kevin: Let's take a look.
Got it.
Hmm, I expected more.
So, you were trapped in here.
That's right.
You're in charge.
Right again.
Two for two.
So, can we just go home now.
Not in the cards.
Not for you.
That's a hell of a way to treat your son.
Oh, that.
I'm not your father, Sam.
But I'm very, very happy to see you.
CLU.
Where is he?
Sam: What'd you do to him?
Same thing I'm going to do to you.
User.
Greetings programs.
Oh what a vocation we have here before us.
Because, your rumors are true.
We do indeed have in our midst, a user.
Aaa uuuser.
Jarvis: So, what to do?
What does this User deserve.
Might I suggest perhaps, the challenge of the grid.
And who best to battle this senior opponent?
Perhaps one who has some experience in these matters.
Oh yes, indeed programs.
Your liberator, your luminary.
Your leader and beacon.
The one who vanquished the tyranny of the user.
Those many cycles before.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
CCCCLLLLLLUUUUU.
You wanna play?
I'll play.
Excellent word, sir.
Were you pleased with my execution?
The crowd seemed quite energized.
It wasn't meant for them.
What's this?
What do I do with this?
I'll give you a hint.
Not that.
Computer: Grid is live.
Computer: Initiate light-cycle battle.
You got no chance, User.
Their bots are faster than ours.
Use the level's.
Now this I can do.
Here we go.
Whoa.
Hoh, oh!
AAAAAH!
Hey.
We gotta work together.
It's the only way.
That's it, you got me.
Boo!
Whoo, hoo hoo, keep out.
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Sam: Another customer.
Let's go.
Hang on buddy, I'm coming.
Come on.
This is it.
Come on.
NO!
Illegal combatant on the grid.
Get in.
Illegal combatant on the grid.
GET IN!
System failure, release Rinzler.
Game on old friend.
Who are you?
Hang on.
Oh man, you can't make that.
Driver: Made it.
I'm, Quorra.
They're turning around.
Not by choice.
Their vehicles aren't designed to go off grid.
They'll mal-function on this terrian.
What about us?
Hah, obviously not.
Where are you taking me?
Patience, Sam Flynn.
All your questions will be answered soon.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait here.
Quorra.
I dreamed of Tron.
First time in years.
It's a sign.
A sign my dear friend, is of a weary soul.
I'm afraid something's happened.
Something has happened.
We have a guest.
There are no guests here.
Sam.
Long time.
You have no idea.
You're, you're here.
You're here.
I'm here.
You're big.
You're.
Old.
How did you get here?
Alan came over.
Really.
He got your page.
I found your office under the arcade.
Page?
Oh, man, of course.
CLU had him on the Light-Cycle grid.
I intervened.
Oh.
Been there soon,
CLU taught them.
He never thought he'd see you again.
Yeah.
Vintage.
Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games.
It doesn't get out as much as it used to, but.
Still the fastest thing on the grid.
Do you know it?
His patience usually beats out my more, aggressive strategy.
Flynn shared them with me.
I've read them all.
Wow, you like reading.
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Lee Chang,
Journey without a goal.
Must have a killer ending.
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless.
About, removing oneself from the equation.
But, between you and me.
Jules Verne is my favorite.
Do you know, Jules Verne?
Sure.
What's he like?
Your move Flynn, come on.
Come on.
How old are you now, Sam?
- Uh,
- You should be 27.
I just turned 27.
Do you attend a college?
Cal-Tech.
Cal-Tech.
My Alma-Mater.
Sam: Yeah.
That's why I dropped out.
Work?
-A job? ENCOM or you, uh...
-No.
I check in once a year.
-Life, girlfriend?
-A dog.
I have one.
A rescue.
Well, dogs uh, dogs are cool.
I'm sure you must have a few questions of your own, Sam.
Actually, just one.
Why I never came home?
Those nights when I went to the office
I'm sure you figured it out by now, was to come here.
Moving forward into digital space.
Maybe, still.
But, I also had you.
I had ENCOM, I couldn't be in your world all the time.
I needed partners.
To help out.
-Tron and CLU.
-That's right.
Tron was created by Alan for the old system.
I brought him here to protect this one.
CLU was my creation.
A program designed to create a perfect world.
We were jammin' man, building utopia.
Hours in here were just minutes back home.
Just when I thought it couldn't get anymore profound.
Something unexpected happened.
The Miracle.
The Miracle.
You remember.
Iso's
Isomorphic Algrarithm's.
A whole new life form.
And you created them?
No, no.
They manifested.
Like a flame.
They weren't really, really from anywhere.
The conditions were right, and they came into being.
For centuries we dreamed of gods, spirits, aliens.
An intelligence beyond our own.
You seeing this?
I found them, in here.
Like flowers in the waste land.
Profoundly naive.
Unimaginably wild.
They were spectacular.
Everything I'd hope to find in the system.
Control, order, perfection. None of it meant a thing.
But living in a hall of mirrors.
The Iso's.
Shattered.
The possibilities of their root code, their digital DNA.
Disease?
History!
Science, philosophy, every idea, man has ever had about the universe up for grabs.
Bio digital jazz, man.
The Iso's, they were going to be my gift to the world.
So, what happened?
CLU.
CLU happened.
Kevin: Will you stop worrying about everything, Tron.
Kevin: Everything is fine, everything’s under control.
Flynn!
Am I still to create the perfect system?
Yeah.
Kevin: It was a coup.
Go!
You've been corrupted.
Wait....wait!
Flynn, go!
Yahhh!
Tron, he fought for me.
I never saw him again.
So why don't you fight?
He did.
He fed on my resistance.
The more I fought, the more powerful it became.
It was impressed with him .
And my miracle? CLU saw the
ISO's as an imperfection.
So he destroyed them.
The purge.
He killed them all?
It was genocide.
I tried to get back. But I couldn't get to the portal.
It uses massive power. And it can't stay open forever.
And like a safe. It can only be opened from the outside.
It closed on me, Sam.
That's why I never came home.
So the portal. It activated when I came in.
So it's open, now.
Not for long.
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.
So, we go now.
Go home. Make a run for it.
-Get you out of here.
-Kevin: Don't rush.
What do you mean, don't rush. The portal's going to close.
What? What is it?
The moment Flynn is on the grid,
CLU will stop at nothing to obtain his disc.
My disc is everything, Sam.
It's the master key.
The golden ticket, the way out.
But not just for me.
-What do you mean?
-Our worlds are more connected than anyone knows.
CLU figures if I can be in.
He can be out?
With my disc, it's possible.
And then what?
Game over.
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.
What's more important than our world?
I can't let that happen.
I won't.
So what'll we do?
Nothing?
It's amazing how productive doing nothing can be.
CLU's planning something.
We've known that for a while.
Programs have been disappearing, there's unrest out there.
Even revolution. If we sit tight, he might be brought down from the inside.
The portal's closing. We can't just sit around. We have to move now.
Tell me.
What brought you here?
Through the grid.
Alan got your page.
I didn't send any page.
It was CLU. CLU sent that page.
That's why you're here.
Kevin: This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece on the board to change the game.
With you he got more than he ever dreamed.
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together, heading for the portal.
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.
Now that's a hell of a way to win.
But it is a way.
We can go you home.
Don't you want that?
Sometimes life has a way of moving you past things like wants and hopes.
That's right, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.
Goodnight, Sam.
How can he be so afraid of his own creation?
I mean, he built CLU.
Why doesn't he just end him.
He could but it would require reintegration.
Yeah, all right.
Flynn would never survive the effect.
It would mean the end of them both.
If he refuses to save himself, then I will.
How?
I'm going to the portal.
CLU wants Flynn's disc, not mine.
I'm going to find Allen and we're going to figure this thing out from the other side.
This may be CLU's game here, But in my world he's gone in one keystroke.
But I can't do anything unless I get to the portal.
My guts tell me that you don't want to be stuck in this place for eternity.
I really think you should consider your father's wisdom.
I have.
There's someone I once knew.
A program named Zuse, who fought along side the ISO's.
They say he can get anyone, anywhere.
How do I find him?
This is his sector.
Make it there alive.
And he'll find you.
Sam.
Sam?
Hey man, it's your lucky day.
Stop it.
Sam Flynn.
-You remember me.
-Yeah.
You gave me some advice.
And you followed it.
Its unfortunate we met the way we did.
You have a good night.
You're looking for someone.
What makes you say that.
Intuition.
Sir, sentries downtown, recovered Flynn's light cycle.
They've traced it to it's component of origin.
Prepare the light-runner Quorra.
We're going downtown.
Thank you for bringing my son to me.
Flynn, you don't need to go. I sent him to someone we can trust.
Quorra, there is no choice.
I won't lose him again.
Chaos, good news.
Relax, they're occupied.
His name is Castor.
You want to speak to Zuse you're going to have to go through him.
Castor: Where is your sense of humor, my friend?
Programs are disappearing, Castor. Soon none of us will be left.
Zuse can unite the factions, ferment revolution.
Well of course Zuse can do these things.
Grant me an audience.
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating my dear bot,
But Zuse's time is precious.
We shall see.
Whispers: I bought your boy, Flynn.
If you'll excuse me a moment, I have to, uh...
Attend to something, but have a drink.
Courtesy of the "End of line" club.
It is happening.
Come, away from these primitive functions.
The son of Flynn.
Of all the innumerable possibilities.
He has to walk into mine.
Libations, for everybody!
I'm Castor.
Your host.
Provider of any and all entertainment and diversions.
At your service.
I'm looking for Zuse.
Indeed.
Many are.
Where can I find him?
This pretty miss, is a conversation best had behind closed doors.
Perhaps we should retire to my private lounge.
Uh, designed it myself, you know.
It's true.
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.
Change the scheme, alter the mood.
Electrify the boys and girls, if you'd be so kind.
Thank you.
Gem.
My name is, Gem.
Cozy.
-You are CLU.
-I am CLU.
You will create the perfect system.
I will create the perfect system.
Together we're going to change the world, man.
Let's move.
Zuse has been around since the earliest days of the gaming grid.
By necessity.
He has to mine all the percentages.
All the angles.
So when do I meet him?
You...just...did.
Zuse: After the purge, I needed to reinvent myself.
Self preservation, you understand.
Now.
What can I do, for you?
I need to get to the portal.
Well, it's closing quickly.
As I'm sure, you're aware.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
And it's quite the journey.
Beyond the far reaches of the outlands.
Your father didn't want any programs, slipping out accidentally, did he.
Can you help me?
Of course.
But first, as a man who prides himself on staying well informed.
I must ask, who sent you my way?
Her name's, Quorra.
Said she met you a long time ago.
Indeed she did.
Many cycles ago.
It was a different time.
But we're not here to relive the past.
Let's see about your future, shall we?
Now, we'll have to, uh... change your attire, and you'll need a forged disc.
Not easy these days, by the way.
And of course you'll need transport.
To cross the sea of simulation.
This is going to be quite a ride.
I believed in users once before.
Playing all the angles.
Revenge!
The game has changed.
Son of Flynn!
Ha, ha, haaa.
Met your friend.
He's fantastic.
Behold, the son of our maker.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's split, man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sam: A little help here, maybe.
Your Disc.
Dad, it's gone.
It is.
I'm sorry, I know I messed up.
Sam: We can go back, I can go back.
No, we stay together.
Dad, I can do this.
You've done enough all ready.
Sam, your really---
You're messin' with my Zen thing, man.
She's stable.
So what do we do now?
I don't know.
Nothing.
We do nothing.
We still,
...wait.
You ever jump a freight train?
Huh?
We do it your way.
It's a long sprint to the portal.
If we beat CLU there we have a chance.
Let's get her out of here.
This will take us there.
Is she going to make it?
I don't know, I gotta identify the damaged code.
The sequence on it is just enormously complex.
Sam: But didn't you write it?
(Laughs) Some of it, the rest of it is just, beyond me.
She's an Iso.
Yeah, the last Iso.
All this time you were just, protecting her.
She's the miracle, man.
Everything I ever worked for.
A digital frontier to reshape the human condition.
I always thought that was just a plot line.
In our world, she could change everything.
Check that out.
She risked herself for me.
Some things are worth the risk.
Look at this.
Now that is impressive, if I do say so myself, huh?
Come on, it's going to take a while for her system to reboot.
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.
The boy and Flynn are gone.
I presume your Excellency, they perished in the elevator.
You presume.
Find them.
Ice caps are melting,
War in the middle east.
Lakers, Celtics, Batman.
I don't know rich are getting richer.
The poor are getting poorer.
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.
What's Wi-Fi?
-Wireless sim-linking
-Of Digital devices?
-Yeah.
-Oh.
I thought of that when you were five.
Mom and Dad,
-I assume let go
-Yeah.
Oh.
Back when I was twelve.
Gram five years later.
You remember that night.
When you didn't come home.
- Well, you said,
- I said I'd show you the grid.
You should have seen this place back then.
Couldn't wait to show it to you.
The net-way.
Must have been something, before CLU screwed it up.
No, no, he, he's me.
I screwed it up.
Crazy after perfection.
Chasing after what was right in front of me.
Right in front of me.
Look what you've accomplished.
It's incredible.
Sam.
I'd give it all up for one more day with you.
Hey.
Remember your old Ducati?
You kidding me. There's not a day goes by I don't think about that bike.
Yeah, well. Fixing her up.
What are you busting my bike?
Well twenty years in the shed, no tork, I mean.
She knew you were her love.
How's she running?
Well, when I'm done.
Better than ever.
Aw man, I'd like to see that.
You will.
Here, she's rebooting, give her this.
Your old man is going to knock on the sky, listen for the sound.
When Flynn entered the space, ahh, everything changed.
Zuse: I've never seen anything quite like it.
The aura was palpable.
Was it.
I presume our understanding, is still valid.
Control of the city.
A sizable request.
I know. But, uh...
Seemingly fitting compensation.
Don't you think?
How long have you been searching for this?
Hmm?
A thousand cycles...huh?
Just imagine the secrets it holds.
The master key to any and all, riddles of the grid, grid, grid.
There's something else, too.
Isn't there?
I've heard the chatter.
About this private initiative.
I realize that our alliance is at times, uneasy.
But always necessary.
You know you need me.
Right where I am.
CLU.
Of course, you're right.
You have the drink.
End of line, man.
- (Gasps for breath)
-Hey, hey.
It's okay, we're safe for now.
We're heading east, towards the portal.
CLU has the disc.
Once I get out, I can shut him down.
I should never have sent you to Zuse.
It was a mistake.
It's okay, I made a few myself.
Where is he?
I think he's knocking on the sky.
And listening to the sound.
Yeah.
How did you find him?
It's okay.
I know.
It was during the purge.
CLU was relentless.
The Black guard were executing
Iso's in the streets.
Everyone I knew, disappeared.
Then they came for me.
So I ran.
As sympathetic programs smuggled me out of the city. but soon they had me surrounded.
I prepared for the end.
And just as everything was going dark.
I felt a hand.
On my shoulder.
And when I opened my eyes.
Standing above me, was the creator.
Your father.
He saved me.
I guess you could say I'm, a rescue.
Sam: Hell of a view.
It used to let us know that Flynn was here.
It became a symbol of something bigger.
Something, better in this world.
I've never been this close before.
It's how I imagined a sunrise to be.
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.
What's it like?
-The sun?
-Yeah.
Oh, man.
I've never had to describe it before.
Warm.
Radiant.
Beautiful.
Get below.
MOVE!
This isn't suppose to be here.
What happened?
A new course.
What is this?
CLU can't create programs.
He can only destroy and repurpose them.
Repurpose them for what?
Sam: He's building an army.
Let's go.
-Goodbye.
-Quorra!
Quorra.
What's she doing?
Removing herself from the equation.
Tron.
He's alive.
We can't just let her go.
Sam!
There's another way.
Well done sir.
Have you ever seen anything like it?
Humbly, sir.
I know you have greater designs, then any of us understand.
What does it do?
She's going to wind up like one of them.
Keep moving, Sam.
(Programs chanting,
CLU, CLU)
You are a very rare bird, aren't you.
Where's your disc?
Where is he?
Must have been so lonely out there.
Tragic to be the only one.
I've seen what users are capable of, CLU.
You don't belong with them.
I have something very special in mind for you.
Take her upstairs.
And find them.
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived just as I was prepared for the toast.
CLU begins his speech:
Greetings programs.
Together we have achieved a great many things.
We have created a vast complex system.
We've maintained it, we've improved it.
We have rid it of its imperfection.
Not to mention, ridding of the false deity who sought to enslave us.
Kevin Flynn!
Where are you now?
My fellow programs, let there be no doubt.
That our world is a cage no more.
For at this moment.
The key to the next frontier is finally in our possession.
The disc.
And unlike our selfish creator who preserved the privilege of our world only to himself.
I will make their world open, and available to all of us.
YES!
To all of us.
Sam: He's taking all of us with him.
He's figured out how to do it.
And whatever we find there.
There our system will grow, there our system will blossom.
Do this, prove yourselves, prove yourself to me.
Be loyal to me.
And I will never betray you.
Dad, we have to get your disc.
No we gotta get to the portal.
You shut them down from the outside.
Even if I make it out you won't last in here.
-Quorra won't last..
-I said it will be all right, come on.
Will you let it go, I'm not going home without you.
Sam.
Same team.
Remember?
I was afraid you were going to say that.
Meet me on the flight deck in five.
And get us some wheels.
Wheels? What's your plan?
I'm a user.
I'll improvise.
Rid the new system of its imperfections.
My vision is clear.
Out there, is a new world!
Out there is our victory.
Out there, is our destiny.
Black Guard: Identify yourself, program.
I'm not a program.
My name is Sam Flynn.
Identify yourself.
I'm taking this vehicle.
You are not authorized.
Right away, sir.
Watch your step please, as you board the aircraft.
Down with the users.
Master key, disengaged.
Master key, disengaged.
I came with a girl.
A program, where is she?
Sam. GO!
AAAAH!
What are you doing here?
We gotta get to the flight deck.
But CLU will be here any minute.
We'll never make it.
Come on.
Come on, kiddo.
Radical, man.
Hurry!
Made it.
Try to hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.
You got this, Quorra.
It's all in the wrist.
Death to the user.
Head towards the light, Quorra.
Where did you learn that move back there?
ENCOM tower.
Couple nights ago.
ENCOM tower. Huh.
Light-jets.
Here they come.
-Sam, take the turret.
-Huh?
Oh man, I'm all over this.
Yeaah!
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.
One down, five to go.
Nice.
We gotta split them up.
Come on.
Have a nice swim.
You gotta get behind them.
Waoooo!
I don't think this is a good idea.
You're probably right.
He's gaining on us.
YES!
It's jammed.
Tron.
What have you become?
Aw, come on.
Flynn, go!
Rinzler, take a shot.
Finish the game.
Noooooooo!
I, fight for the users!
Aaaaaaah!
That was him.
It's over.
It's over!
Quorra: Waoooo!
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.
Let's get you home, Dad.
There it is.
Take her down.
Hang on.
This could be rough.
This is mine.
Had a feeling you'd be here.
The cycle's haven't been kind, have they.
Well, you don't look so bad.
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.
I know you did.
I executed the plan.
As you saw it.
You, you promised that we would change the world, together.
You broke your promise.
I know, I understand that now.
I took this system to its maximum potential.
I created the perfect system.
The thing about perfection, is that it's unknowable.
It's impossible, but it's also right in front of us all the time.
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.
I'm sorry, CLU.
I'm sorry.
Go.
CLU!
Remember what you came for.
DAD!
CLU: You knew I'd beat you.
And still you did all this.
For him.
No.
No.
Why?
He's my son.
Gooooo!
Dad!
Sam, it's time.
No!
Sam.
It's what he wants.
I'm not leaving you.
Take her.
Yes.
Goodbye, kiddo.
Alan.
You paged me?
Yeah.
You jet ENCOM at 8AM.
What about the board?
We trim them out.
I'm taking the company back, Alan.
Oh, and you were right.
About what?
About everything.
What's next, Sam?
I guess we're suppose to change the world.
Come on, I want to show you something.
There was a man from Troubadour who got blown up during the war.
He did not die, would not concede.
So what is it
I'm writing?
It's not just some crappy memoir or even an attempt at apologizing for everything I've done.
This is a cautionary tale.
I hope that you might learn from my mistakes.
'Cause in the end, a job is not just a job.
It's who you are.
And if you want to change who you are, well, first, you have to change what you do.
There was a man from Troubadour who got blown up during the war.
He did not die, would not concede.
How many artiforgs did he need?
Here.
Thanks.
Stomach, bladder, pancreas, eyes, intestines.
So, what is it?
A novel? Epic poem?
Thoughts. lt's just stuff.
And it's not finished.
What?
Somebody's coming.
You don't hear it?
What are you doing?
Put them on.
...who got blown up during the war.
He did not die, would not concede.
How many artiforgs did he need?
Stomach, bladder, pancreas, eyes, intestines, liver, blood, guts, head!
Get down!
Who's that?
Landlord, come to collect.
Grab the typewriter!
There's a fire escape.
No, no! Downstairs.
What the fuck is this?
This is bullshit. l thought you were a Level Five.
Quite honest, l'm... l'm a little disappointed.
You're disappointed?
They sent the ear guy after me, imagine how l feel.
That's a good one.
You'll be laughing out of the other side of your mouth when l have your heart in my hand.
Shit. Beth! Get back!
Beth!
No!
Fuck!
Shit.
Oh, shit! lt hurts!
Beth, get out of there.
Come on, get out!
Welcome back.
Whose car is this?
The landlord's. l borrowed it.
You're leaking quite a bit of fluid there. l can fix it.
Where are we going?
We're gonna pick up some supplies.
Where'd you find all that stuff?
When you're on the streets long enough, babe...
There.
"What do you do for a living?"
"l'm a fucking lung. Can you believe that shit?
"lt's ridiculous, right?"
Great example he's setting.
You all right?
Never been better. l'll be five minutes.
Attention, shoppers. This month only...
Hey, Larry.
Hi, Larry!
Hi, Larry!
Watch it, kid. lf you ever want to make Repo, keep your fucking head up.
What the fuck do you want?
Afternoon, boss. l should have given you that lung job.
You look good in that thing.
Yeah? lt itches like a motherfucker.
Yeah, that's what the kid said, too.
Nice Taser.
Yours?
No.
Nor is that. l'll do that to the next one.
The one after.
The one after that. l guarantee, you'll run out of Repo Men before l run out of ways of killing them.
Great, great.
This is just great.
Do you have any idea what this makes me look like?
One of my own guys jumping credit, huh?
Yeah.
Now take me out of the system.
Fine. Give me your heart. l said take me out of the system.
And l said give me your goddamn heart.
For Christ's sake, you sound like one of them, whining and begging.
There is no way out of the system!
You screwed that up when you pulled your little stunt with the bar codes!
Yeah! That's right,
Einstein!
They pulled all the local scanners!
Now every artiforg reclaim has to go back to the main office, get scanned in behind the pink door!
So, unless you're thinking about breaking into Corporate, give me your fucking heart!
Or, and there is an option here, we could sit down and talk this out.
You know, maybe come up with a plan that fits your...
We're leaving.
Where are we going?
Kenya. South America.
Anywhere The Union isn't.
The airport?
No one gets out through the airport. lt's impossible.
Not with these. l don't get it.
How'd he get in here?
He was wearing the damn lung costume. l'm glad you find this amusing,
'cause now he's yours.
Where's my goddamn shirt, huh?
A job's a job, right?
Your attention, please.
Hold there.
Forward. Thank you. Now boarding,
Flight 2701 to São Paulo, Brazil
Sir?
Forward, please. Hold there.
If you are a passenger on that flight, please proceed to Gate 29.
Thank you.
What if it doesn't work? lt has to work.
Should l check it?
No. No.
You really don't want to be found with a jammer in here. l looked at him.
- Huh? l looked at him.
Shit.
A little holiday?
Uh, funeral.
You done with that?
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Forward, please.
Hold there.
Thank you.
Forward.
Sir, forward, please.
Hold there.
Thank you.
Forward.
That was fun.
Thank you.
- Honey, look.
Excuse me, miss?
Your leg's bleeding.
Come on.
Ma'am, do you need some assistance? l'm okay. Thank you.
She's fine. Thanks.
We can't let you fly like this.
Sorry?
Sir, there's blood all over the floor.
We need to get her cleaned up. l'm fine, really. ls that really necessary?
The quicker we get this done, the quicker you can get on the plane. l promise you, she's all right. Let's go.
This way, please. Come on.
We still gonna make the plane?
Absolutely.
These tickets refundable? l have no idea, sir.
So when's the last boarding, then? l don't know, sir.
Okay, let's take a look at that leg.
Doctor told her to take it easy.
She doesn't listen to anyone. lt's okay. lt happens all the time.
That's him.
You don't want to do that.
Everybody's got to be a fucking hero.
We got to dump this car, get you a new kneecap. Hold on. l know someone who can help.
He's outside the Union. ls he a vulture?
We don't have any choice.
Believe me, it's the last place l want to go.
This is a bad idea.
He always left me a key up here.
How well did you know this guy?
I gave her my loving
She gave me blue balls
I gave her my money...
Put it away.
Put it away. l gave her the thing a man...
Asbury.
Little, little
Miss Muffet.
Don't call me that.
We need your help.
Why'd you have to drag me a U-man, huh? l'm not with them anymore.
Why? Did you quit or was he quitted?
Got my cookies?
Yeah, l got your cookies.
Don't touch anything, U-man.
Come on, stop your whining. l was thinking of you when l tweaked this.
He always left me a key up here... Asbury...
Don't call me that.
Universal remote. Vocal auto-playback with an eight-hour buffer, man. l'm telling you, this is gonna be a head-blaster at all the parties.
Mark my words. l see you haven't changed.
Well, no, l haven't.
Have you?
You pay for these?
What'd you say?
Did you pay for these?
Pay for yours?
That's different.
Yeah, how's that different, U-man, huh? l'm Robin Hood, baby. l'm Jesus, l'm Gandhi. l can lift the valve from some fresh meat and then drop it in a new client for half the cost. Bottom line, l don't kill my clients. l wait for them to die.
What do you do to your clients when you're finished with them, huh?
Chop them up for dog meat?
You know what?
You got your own thoughts, huh?
Company parrot? l'd rather be a fucking parrot... Parrot!
...than a fucking vulture!
Fucking vulture! Parrot! Parrot!
You think you're the solution, man?
You're the problem! l'm the problem?
You're the fucking problem!
Hey! When the pissing contest is over, may l have some help?
So what do you want me to do? You want me to put you two on the boat, is that it?
Yeah. But l can't run if l can't walk. l'm sorry, baby, l just don't fly with joints anymore.
We're gonna have to switch over to Alva for that insertion.
That bitch almost killed me.
Well, that's your side of the fairytale, isn't it?
But l'll tell you something. lt warms my cock that you're still sore about that.
Have a seat.
Another one, Mom?
- Yeah, baby, another one.
So let Mama work a minute.
That's Little Alva.
Hey.
Hello.
Before we start, l'm gonna need to know about all your other artiforgs.
What do you mean?
You put most of them in.
Beth, humor me.
Ears, Vocar.
Opticor eyes.
My liver is a Hexa-Tan from a specialty house in Denmark.
My kidneys are actually two different models.
One is a Union generic.
The other one didn't hold up so well.
Lord, l thought she was gonna go on forever.
Wait. Don't you need her to tell you the rest?
Nah, that's just my version of "Count back from 100." All right, baby, you're up.
What are we doing?
- A new knee.
What? She's the surgeon?
Yeah, l just do anesthesia these days.
The little one's got the steadier hand.
She's five!
She's nine, actually, but she's been doing this since she was four.
Ain't that right, pumpkin? Shh! l almost got it.
Yay! l feel like break dancing.
Go on, then.
Hop along.
Wait.
Stay here.
Beth, let's get out of here.
All right, all right, all right,
I'm coming. U-man number two, huh?
Man, you guys regen like a cancer...
Beth.
All right... lt just goes on like that for awhile.
How'd you find us?
Found you the same way you would have found me. l see what's going on here. l get this. l get it. l do.
But l can make this right with Frank.
All you got to do is you got to come back with me.
Beth, wait there. l'll deal with you later. l'll deal with you later.
No. l can't go back.
That's who you are, man.
That's who you are.
Not anymore.
Not since the accident.
There you go again with the accident! lf l had known that you were going to be such a pussy about the accident...
What?
What, you thought it was fate?
Sort of karmic plan to get you right with the world? ls that what you thought?
Jake...
Let me tell you, the cosmos, it doesn't know shit about swapping out electrical leads.
You rigged the defib unit.
Didn't you?
For what?
So l'd build up debt so l wouldn't transfer to sales?
You're not a salesman, man!
You never would've been. You never could be!
All you had to do was just to keep working.
You and me, doing our thing.
You're fucking crazy, do you know that?
You could have killed me. l tried to save your life. l'm not going with you.
Well, l'm not letting you go.
God!
God.
Let's go, buddy.
No!
You owe it to yourself.
You've done this a thousand times!
Buddy, you and me, we're always gonna be Repo.
- Stay with me.
- Always.
There is no way out of the system!
You screwed that up when you pulled your little stunt with the bar codes!
Hey, wake up.
Wake up.
Come on, get up.
You okay?
Uh-uh.
We got to go.
Raid! Repo!
Raid, raid!
Go! Go! Go!
Raid!
Fuck!
Help me! Please, help!
Where'd they go?
Singing my favorite song.
Okay.
Wait.
Back off!
Give me one reason why l shouldn't pull this trigger.
Welcome to your world, Repo Man.
Come back inside.
We can stay here until we find a way out.
There is no way out.
Stop, please.
There is no way out.
Not for anyone.
Wherever we go, wherever we hide, they'll find us.
That's what they do.
That's what l did.
What do you want to do?
Finish this.
Okay, so we go to headquarters and find the pink door...
We go to headquarters, we find the pink door, we wipe the system.
No more accounts.
Nobody's overdue.
That's easy.
Here he is.
Hmm?
Peanut.
Dad!
Thanks for bringing him. l can't believe you let it get this far.
Just let me have a minute with my son.
Who's she?
Carol, shall we do this on the train?
Come on.
Frank and Jake are calling me three times a day, trying to find you. l haven't got time for this.
All l'm asking for is a few minutes with Peter.
Do you think l'm having a good time trying to raise him on my own?
Mom! Dad.
Peter, l'm talking! l didn't have a fucking choice!
You think l wanted to just walk away from the situation?
Give me a moment with my son.
Oh, l'm sure that's exactly what you like, for your problems to just walk away and just disappear.
That's not...
Peter!
That was very naughty.
Very, very naughty what you just did.
Come on, come on, we gotta go.
When you're old enough, you read this.
And if you still want to see your old man, l'll be in Punta del Este.
Can you say that?
Punta del Este. l love you.
Look after your mum.
Hi.
Come on. Again?
So, what's the plan?
Wait here.
My feet are always freezing.
What? The cotton socks don't work? l always wear cotton socks.
Hey, who's this guy?
Sir, this is a restricted area. lt's all about who you know.
So what is it, bright pink or pale pink? l don't know.
You see a pink door, you go for it.
Let's go.
Come on.
Oi!
Come on.
Oi!
This is it?
Oh, shit.
Union men.
What are we going to do?
Fuck.
Grab the ax.
Freeze!
- Don't move!
- Drop it now!
Your weapons!
Drop your weapons! Do it now!
Anyone comes through that door, kill them.
Hacksaw!
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.
Have a nice day.
Go on.
Make a delivery.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.
Beth!
Beth!
Great! That's just fucking great!
There's no keyboard.
There's no keyboard.
So?
So, if there's no keyboard, how can l get into the system?
How do l wipe the accounts?
Maybe there's a different way.
Using what? l don't know.
An interface or something.
Look at it, Beth, it's a scanner. That's it.
Even if we were just... l mean, we...
The only...
The only way out of the system... ls what?
The only way out of the system is to repo ourselves.
Can't get in without a forg.
We're surrounded by the fucking things.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.
You're kidding, right?
Stop it.
No. Stop it.
No!
Beth.
We'll die.
Beth.
We can fight our way back out.
We didn't come all this way to run back out.
Help me.
Wait. l can't.
Beth. l can't dance the mambo alone.
Please deposit one artiforg in reclaim drawer.
Have a nice day.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.
Have a nice day.
Stay with me.
Always.
Stay with me.
Only one left, all right?
Only one left.
Don't go now.
What are you doing? l'm losing her.
There's only one left.
Oh, Jesus, this is fucking pathetic. Finish it.
Stay with me! ls it really worth it? ls she really worth it?
She's worth every job we ever did.
End it, Jake.
Now.
All right, then.
Enough of this bullshit. l'll do it myself.
Beth.
Give her a shot.
Just give her a shot.
We're out.
Please deposit 11 artiforgs in reclaim drawer.
Have a nice day.
We're not out yet, buddy.
Not yet.
Scorched earth.
Just like you told the kid.
Romans...
They were some badasses.
Artiforg not recognized.
Lockdown in effect.
An administrator will be with you shortly.
Have a nice day.
Every day
Will be like a holiday
Mmm.
Christ, it's hot. lt's the tropics.
Yeah, l know. lt's hot.
Are you going to stay here and act macho, or come and have some fun?
Christ, it's hot. Huh?
Macho.
Sounds kind of fruity.
Peter had it published.
"An instant classic.
"The depths of this author's insights are astonishing."
Am l in this?
What's happening?
It's just a glitch.
It'll sort itself out.
There. All better.
See? His endorphins are up, limbic system's running strong.
Hey, hey, you guys take it easy. l want him to be comfortable. All right?
Yes, sir.
Nothing to worry about. lf that hook had hit him any lower, it might have posed a problem.
The M.5 Neural Net is top of the line.
What's he thinking about?
No way to know.
Yeah, but he's happy right now.
As long as someone's paying for the system.
There's 50 commissions right there.
That'll take care of his heart, that'll take care of the down payment on the M.5.
The Union can dock my pay for the rest.
Hey, sir. Sir!
This one's still alive.
Leave her. l'll take care of her.
Hold.
Sweet dreams, buddy.
For extensive neurological injuries, l'd have to recommend the M.5 Neural Net.
We're running a special on it this month,
18% for the first year,
24% after that.
Why should your loved one pass on just because of a little brain damage?
That's barbaric.
That's just bad science.
With the M.5 Neural Net, yesterday's dreams are today's reality.
Imagine your loved ones living out the rest of their natural lives in a world where they are always happy, always content, and always taken care of.
You owe it to your family.
You owe it to yourself.
A little fruit for the fruit?
Why not?
Cheers.

Where are we?
- Above the cargo space.
Where all things are done that you will never see.
How's your head?
Good work on that plane.
- Thanks.
Where is everybody?
- Everything is abandoned.
This terminal is offline for three hours.
Closed for maintenance.
We need her down the stairs, bring to the hangar.
You help me. Forward.
Quiet, okay? On three.
One, two, three.
That door leads to the main terminal.
That has never been locked.
Do not have keys or something?
- It works here automatically.
They have us in lockdown.
Lockdown?
- What?
Ever heard of terrorism?
Since 9 / 11 changed that.
Super Secure.
Each entrance is guarded and off.
They look at us.
Why we are in lockdown?
- You tell me that.
What is this?
- This is not good.
What are you doing?
You work here...
- Answer. There must be something.
You have to find something, man.

I wave my badge at people.

You hold us up.
- Silence.
The police.
Be careful.
Why sirens?
Attention, flight 318.
Try not to leave the terminal.
Help is on the road.
You are now in quarantine.
Everything goes wrong.
I do not know what to say to them.
We're stuck.
Dad, call me as soon as possible.
Tell me what to do.
Have you called your parents?
They make you wonder.
That's what I do.
Come here.
I just called to 911.
They know nothing of.
What? I do not understand.
What do you earn?
- Nothing.
What is this?
What do they do?
Why expose us so?
How long will this take?
I got a job interview.
My husband waiting for me at the airport.
I'm my sister's wedding r missing.
Do you get the captain.
Someone must take the lead.
I understand that.
- We need info.
My wife is six months pregnant.
- How old are you anyway?
Sorry, I...
- You're not good enough.
Take it easy.
- You gotta right not to keep us here.
She takes it as I bleed can not stem.
If I can get my medical kit,
I 'r may be time to give.
Where's your kit?
- In my pocket.
Ed, can you get me the boot?
- The luggage?
Did you not outside army?
- Get me inside.
The boot is downstairs.
Just where you enter.
Are you sure?
- I did my test on that same plane.
I get sick when I step on that plane?
No idea.
- I have a daughter of three.
She is counting on me, you know?
- They are counting on you.
You must do something. Get help.
Please.
I have not baulk at.
I go along.
- Me too.
I left my wife on that laptop.
I need your help.
Stay here, can you?
Shilah Washington, you'll recognize my bag.
Fast.
Unbelievable.
- What happened?
What now?
Ops, answer.
I have energy again.
The energy is out. Forward.
We are going through.
Answer, I have energy now.
The energy is here too.
Captain?
Willsy?
The staircase is out of order.
Captain Forrest?
Willsy?
Anyone?
There is none.
Stay with me.
Captain.
This is really a mess.
I do not understand.
If he is not within... and everyone is gone...
- Then someone opened the gate.
I'm watching.
I take my laptop.
I have one.
Damn.
- It's only blood.
Damn.
Found.
It's Doc.
I'll see you at the gate.
- Wait.
They had never left when the gate was open.
Right?
- She's right.
The gate is still closed.
It's pretty close.
Please note that we get back to Doc.
Hasten.
Mandy Britts, three sacks.
Get your own damn bags.
We are looking for a bag, with the surname Washington.
They are broken during the turbulence. Sorry.
There goes my five dollars.
There.
What are you doing?
The world's a dangerous place.
I'll never run away.
After what I've seen here tonight, these things are mandatory on airplanes.
Such as belts.
I got it.
Come on, let's go...
Damn rat.
She came right to me.
A large red eyes.
Was certainly not a hamster?
- No, it looked like a rat.
We go.
Doc.
Rifle shots at the plane.
Look at me.
It's all right.
Out, quickly.
Careful.
Doc...
- He's fine.
Lift it up.
Help me.
I got you. Hold on.
Is he?
Let's go.
See if he was bitten.
What was that?
- Nothing. I see nothing.
Look everywhere.
Hello.
Help me.
What the hell is that?
Close the door!
Fucking bitch!
Go though it, we love her.
Go.
Jenny, we heard gunshots.
Keep pressure on it.
What happened?
- On the plane.
She bites and infected another.
- I do not understand.
The Captain... I got him shot.
- Your face is the blood.
The bathroom was empty, filled with blood, without the big guy.
We went in the hole...
Hold on.
I am.
On the side.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
I bite you.
Breathing.
We're safe. I took my gun.
Fortunately, because it sucks.
Why did the energy from?
You left this behind and I took on when your father called.
I would say you should take the stick and then fell all cell phones simultaneously.
My father gave me flying lessons since I was twelve.
He said:
Get on the stick.
I dared not only to fly even with him beside me.
He let the stick go.
We turned.
I had to take control.
I never understood why he did that.
I'll be back.
The door is closed.
- Everything stays on that plane.
Are you sure?
I did not Mr. Bunt. Do you?
I need you.
Come, we gotta go.
Listen.
- What do you want now?
I have something to say.
- You've said enough.
Listen to what she has to say.
Number one: We do not know when we are out of it.
Number two: We must ensure that no one is infected.
That's fucking brilliant.
- Smart.
And who's in charge?
I.
- You?
You know nothing.
- We must vote.
I have this.
- Shoot me down or shut up.
Our captain, Mr. Stubbins in 7A murdered, is dead.
Our copilot crawls through the plane like a beast.
This means that you are my passengers to this race is over.
Is that clear?
Quite clear.
What this is, it spreads through bites.
We do not know.
- I can just show a symptom.
It can spread through the air or locally.
We know nothing.
I think it's rabies.
Rabies people.
People Rabies?
- That it is spread by a bite?
Right?
- Maybe saliva.
Rabies can be cured. Vaccines.
That is you are sick.
There is no cure.
I think this is not rabies.
Rabies does not exhibit the same symptoms in humans.
If the virus does to the brains... the bastard is a threat.
They talked about 's building quarantined, somewhere in LA.
An apartment building.
- We also because we are from LA.
Twice an evening.
How often would that occur?
And your girlfriend, she is not infected?
No, she's bitten, but has no symptoms.
Doc!
Come here.
Gives you immediate medical kit.
Do not let him escape.
Do not let him bite.
He has bitten him.
One, two, three.
Did he bite you?
- No.
Are you sure?
Make it good.
This is wrong and inhuman.
He is bitten.
- It's for our own safety.
On three.
One, two, three.
You're in charge, right?
You have no choice.
I found something on the rat.
- What?
He has a label to.
- That 's a lab rat. Albino.
It's like that rat from the hall, and he behaves like that.
Like the other rats?
- Yes, and like the people.
This is because 's lab rat?
- How does a rat in the hold of a plane?
Ask him to.
- Who?
Did you participate in your lab rat cage?
No, those were the hamsters my niece.
When you came on board,
I saw tails in your cage.
What is he talking about?
I had hamsters when I was little.
They have tiny stumps, you barely see. No tails.
Hamster that I got from my parents, who had just returned from Ecuador.
I now know that hamsters no tails.
You making that up.
- Can I talk to you?
Of course.
Please tell me you're not rats in 't plane brought.
George is a bit confused now.
He and we all have 'n experienced a lot that night.
You tell me the truth?
You may not lab rats in your hand luggage.
Impossible. I was security never passed by.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
I accuse you, but I got better...
He's dead.
Hobbs, say it.
- The health service is underway.
The health service is on its way.
Understood, we are there.
How are you?
- He's lying.
You can not prove it, George.
You believe him because you like him.
The ammunition must be here somewhere in it.
Are you okay with George?
This may sound stupid, but have you seen my briefcase?
Hey, calm down.
You have the weapons to focus.
We want only way.
They should go to the hospital.
- If you cooperate, you are here quickly.
Listen to me...
- Put that camera away.
Put that camera away.
- Get rid of it.
What's that?
- Everything will be explained later.
I see a weapon.
- Deliver your weapon.
Give your weapon.
You three, here.
Get those people out. Both.
Relax.
- Forward.
You two, that table free.
The rest is here in a row.
What happens?
- Protocol, for your safety.
You are all exposed but we do not know who is infected.
You have been identified.
- Everything is explained.
What is that? What do you give them?
Who follows?
- I will not inject unknown.
Right?
However, Nial?
- Everything is explained.
Do it now.
- Take it from here if you want Protocol.
I'll go first.
Say your name into the camera.
This is Louise Tred Well.
The cat is infected.
- Keep them at bay.
Come on.
Open it.
We have a wounded.
Put that fucking door.
Let us out.
Forward!
Go to the door.
He's alive.
Pull him inside.
Make fast the door.
He was shot in the leg.
I hear them.
- They come from the plane. Forward.
I heard them.
- Let's go. Fast.
Ahead, lady.
Forward.
We have to get the boot.
This way.
Forward, fast.
Get in, quick.
What are you doing?
- Are you?
Step. Fast.
What are you doing?
- Get in.
He is infected, leave him behind.
He will murder you.
- I 'm not leaving.
Paula I have left.
We need to get her.
If your girlfriend is there,
You want her to look.
I do not understand.
She followed the protocol.
There is no protocol.
Perhaps I have too much time in the army, but everyone got another injection.
Medication.
- How to get there at?
Each capsule had a different color, own label.
Is this true?
- I can not talk about it.
I will give you explicit consent.
What happens?
How much do the health of this?
It is not the health, but the CBDT.
Chemical biological domestic terrorism.
Terrorism?
Homeland Security. An apartment
LA is under quarantine.
Our units have a 'n few hours to go.
No one has ever returned.
We found a
Bio-thermal laboratory.
Some kind of "doomsday" code.
- Wait.
Has anyone made this?
- The virus, yes. They sought 's remedy.
An antidote.
They have a clinical test done on humans.
We have a survivor test person found.
You could "to ostracize.
What they gave them, it was only much worse.
Rats were there too?
- Rats are carriers.
We thought we'd escape were yet to hold.
Our orders were you alive and to keep together.
You have no idea what it is or how to be treated?
If anything I have seen here, spread throughout our population... and we have no idea to address it...
- We are now testing the rats?
National security.
- They let us out of here again.
Put the gun down.
How about now?
There is no way out.
We will all die.
- It'll be fine.
Lie not constant.
There is no way out.
There must be a way out,
We will find a way out.
I will not die.
- It'll be fine.
Shut up.
The rain...
- What?
This terminal is filling up during heavy rainfall.
They say there is a tunnel, never properly closed.
There is a tunnel?
- Are you serious now?
Terminal F would vanish, it would never be built... the FAA had no money.
Where is that tunnel?
- No idea... but I know where to look.
We need to...
Shoot him down.
Shoot me.
- There are no more bullets.
George, press the green button.
Follow me.
Be quiet.
Let's have at the office.
We must find the tunnel to Terminal F.
Henrie is true?
They have her address.
- Move!
Forward.
Come on, do not stop.
What was that?
Go on, keep walking.
Stand up, Jenny.
She is infected.
Paula?
Paula, stay where you are.
Give me the wrench.
Come on.
Come on, I got you.
Go on, boy.
You go for it.
- There it is.
Inside.
Look for blueprints of Terminal F.
Where to look?
- In the corner stands.
What are you doing, George?
Have you stolen from Henrie?
- Look at this.
Found. The design of Terminal F.
Where are we now?
Terminal F. I think this is it.
We are here and the entrance to the tunnel in a shaft.
Here, somewhere behind the staff room.
- How do we get there?
We go through the security area to the hangar.
We have through the wall, in that space between.
Once we are here, we only to the service tunnel.
Then we went to Terminal F.
They have your address.
That's a bite impression.
But it is okay, right?
As you do this in your possession.
I found it in his briefcase.
Give it.
Is that the antidote that you tested in that apartment building in LA?
Give me, George.
- Who are you?
As I told you earlier,
I hear the good.
I wanted to mean something.
Responsibilities for the future.
By causing a nuisance?
- Nobody else is doing something about it.
Do you?
- How many people do you want this killing?
As much as necessary.
- So you decide who survives?
No, we do. Because the alternative is, no one survives.
Our population keeps growing and consume while our planet is dying.
Do not let me shoot you, George.
Enter here.
Against the wall.
Against the wall.
How did you pass
Security got?
Like the rats.
Just as I found out that my lab in LA was in danger and had to leave the city.
Supporters of this case.
The same that my arrival
Kansas City safely be arranged. and help me, once I'm here.
Antibodies to the virus control so the infection does not damage the brains.
What is that?
You're a smart guy.
Smart enough for you ever to join us.
Fuck you.
Do not believe all the nonsense of the government.
They entitle people like us, as extremists or terrorists... because it is easier than the truth.
What do you think is the truth then?
The earth can be a good use plague.
One that will kill you.
Amazing.
I feel nothing.
Does it?
- I've done the tests themselves in LA.
That would not have been better.
- Shut up.
Time to go, George.
- No, let him go.
This is his only chance.
Forward.
Come on, Jenny.
We have to chase them.
Up.
I'll get to you later.
- Take this.
I'll go first. I grab him well.
- Fast.
Let me go.
I am.
- Shilah, what is that?
Night vision goggles, the health has left behind.
Then you see them before they are yours.
George Henrie and there are went inside. It's a trap.
How did you find?
Here.
It was not my day to fly.
Care for George and kill the rat.
I will try some time for you to win.
Hey, sucker biting,
I'm here, assholes.
These are just mice.
Hold on, George,
I'm coming down.
No, the antidote did not Henrie.
Do not come down.
- There is a flashlight at your feet.
I do not see him.
I'm coming down, stay where you are George.
No, do not come.
Do not.
Return to top.
Stay there.
Please go back.
Please do not throw the camera.
You there.
Did you hit him?
Where is he?
- Look.
Involved?
Did he bite you?
- No.
What happened?
- When we climbed down... he tried to bite me.
The terminal.
- They burn it off.
Come on, here.
It is the tunnel to Terminal F.
- It is closed.
There is no way out.
Stay here.
It's locked,
We never come here.
Yes, but I get it get it.
- It makes no sense.
Stay where you are.
We gotta go.
- I'm not going inside.
You have no choice.
Trust me.
I can not. Really.
There is no other option.
You are my eyes.
Tell me what you see.
I see nothing.
It's just the baggage tunnel.
I'll be right behind you.
Promise?
- I promise, and now.
Keep going.
Can you see anything?
Go on, George, do not stop.
Hurry.
Why do you stop?
Go on.
Do not stop.
I'm infected.
Go on.
No, that's not true.
Just as we reached that point.
I'm sorry.
I feel it.
I do not have much time.
It'll be fine.
- Go.
Your nothing wrong.
- Leave me here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Leave me here.
You will not hurt me.
I'm not leaving without you.
Good?
I think I see...
Jenny, we made it.
Come here.
I'm not leaving without you.
WOMAN: The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today.
MAN 1: You see it in the market's volatility.
Violent wealth loss.
If it's bad for the rich people, can you imagine how bad it is for me and you?
KNlGHT:
Good evening, America, I'm Jay Knight.
Our nation is slipping deeper and deeper into a crisis never seen before.
Oil and gas shortages have crippled manufacturing and transportation costs....
MAN 1:
While conflicts in the Mideast...
...have virtually cut off all oil imports to the United States.
[TRAIN HORN HONKlNG]
MAN 2:
Well, what are you saying?
Are you saying that the American people aren't taking care of their own country?
MAN 3:
Global States Oil Corporation...
...suffered yet another major spill off the Gulf Coast.
MAN 4:
We're seeing an unprecedented....
MAN 3: As a result, rail travel has reemerged as the only affordable means of freight...
...and passenger transportation.
MAN 5: Mr. Speaker, we would like to propose a bill...
...to make it illegal to fire employees from profitable corporations.
KNlGHT: Our government has put a moratorium on all wage increases...
...and recently passed the Fair Price Bill...
...restricting increases in the price of most goods and services.
This is your wake-up call, America.
MAN 6: Another government relief ship was hijacked...
...by pirate Ragnar Danneskjold.
WOMAN 2: Violence and crime are skyrocketing throughout the nation.
Shifting to manual.
[SCREAMlNG]
KNlGHT: Good evening, and welcome to The Jay Knight Hour.
My guests tonight are James Taggart,
CEO of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad...
...Wesley Mouch, a noted Washington lobbyist...
...from the Philadelphia law firm
Young, Stephens and Sachs...
...and Ellis Wyatt, the oil and gas entrepreneur...
...who is responsible for the current economic boom in Colorado.
My first question is to Mr. Taggart.
Sir, your company is one of the few managing to survive...
...in our current economic downturn.
Yet, there have been dozens of derailments on your lines in the last year alone.
How do you explain that?
TAGGART: With any growth there can be growing pains.
People shouldn't have to worry about how they're gonna get where they need to go.
We must act to benefit society as a whole.
WYATT: People aren't gonna be going anywhere without oil.
That means the railroads like Mr. Taggart's need to be fixing their railways here....
JOY: Can l get you something?
MAN: A cup of coffee.
KNlGHT:
He makes a very good point, Mr. Taggart.
Do you have any money?
I got plenty of money.
Taggart Transcontinental is committed to sharing the burden....
JOY:
Hey, what happened to you?
Who's John Galt?
WYATT: We don't need more rail lines.
We just need the ones we have to be reliable.
Let me ask you, what can the government do to help turn things around?
Well, prices are too high.
We have a nation in crisis.
Every business must lend a helping hand,
Mr. Wyatt.
Gasoline prices are 37.50 a gallon.
The Mideast has imploded, creating a worldwide oil shortage.
WYATT: We have plenty of oil right here in the U.S.
Hello, Joy.
WYATT: But because of political shenanigans and back room deals....
One slice of cherry pie. As usual.
MlDAS:
Punctual, as always. Thank you, dear.
And Taggart Transcontinental is providing
Wyatt Oil excellent rail transportation...
...in order to get his oil to the people.
WYATT:
Your Rio Norte Line is so incompetent...
...that I've had to switch to the Phoenix/Durango.
After years of excellent service from us.
WYATT: From your father.
Since you've taken the reins, that company's gone downhill.
Oil prices have caused consumers to be less reliant on trucks--
Stay dry now.
JOY: See you tomorrow, Mr. Mulligan.
MOUCH: They've gone to the railroads for the benefits that they provide.
WYATT: People can't count on companies like Taggart Transcontinental to deliver.
MAN:
Midas Mulligan?
Who's asking?
Someone who knows what it's like to work for himself...
...and not let others feed off the profits of his energy.
That's funny.
Exactly what l've been thinking.
We're alike, you and I.
Who are you?
[RlNGlNG]
Eddie.
What? No. Uh--
Hold on. Hold on.
MAN 1 [ON TV]: The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today.
This is the deepest one-day drop....
No, not yet. l'm trying another channel.
GRECO [ON TV]: Simply one ofthe worst railroad accidents in recent history.
A Taggart Transcontinental freight train has crashed...
...and derailed in Colorado's Rocky Mountain region.
Early reports put much of the blame...
...on the poor condition of the 100-year-old railroad line.
This rail disaster could delay eastbound oil shipments by at least two weeks.
The accident is yet another downturn for Taggart Transcontinental...
...the largest railroad remaining in the U.S.
I'm on my way in.
TAGGART: l already know about the derailment on the Rio Norte Line, Eddie.
Cancellations.
People are giving up trying to use the line.
Their business is going to the Phoenix/Durango.
I have new steel rails coming from--
That order is 13 months old.
The Phoenix/Durango has cut deeply into our business.
They expect to have Wyatt as their main account.
He needs us just as much as we need him.
Ellis Wyatt has put Taggart
Transcontinental on notice.
He'd rather backlog with any competitor than ship anything--
Wyatt's a greedy bastard.
We've been serving the Colorado Region...
...since my great-great grandfather ran this company. What happened to loyalty?
Perhaps the problem is we haven't updated that branch...
...since your father ran the company.
Are you accusing me of not doing my job?
Careful, Eddie, it's one thing I learned from my father...
...everyone's expendable.
Let me be very clear, James.
Colorado is our last hope.
If we don't do something about it, there's not gonna be a railroad.
I'm still the president, regardless of my sister--
DAGNY:
Morning.
Eddie, can you give us a minute?
I need to have a conversation with my brother.
A meeting without your right-hand man?
Must be real important.
I've ordered the replacement rails from Rearden Steel.
I have a contract with Orren Boyle.
You had a contract with Orren Boyle.
Canceled.
You've no authority.
As much authority as you had to do a backdoor deal with Orren Boyle.
There are consequences to this accident, Jim.
We have to service Ellis Wyatt.
He is this company's main priority.
You just love to keep feeding the monopolies.
You keep pissing off the heart of this operation...
...Wyatt is gonna stop providing the blood we need to keep this company alive.
You understand that?
Why Rearden Steel?
There are companies that need the money.
It's his new metal.
That metal's completely untested.
The consensus of the best metallurgical authorities are highly skeptical.
I'm not interested in their opinions.
Then who's do you go by?
My own.
And what on earth do you know about Rearden Metal?
It is tougher, cheaper, lighter than steel...
...and will outlast any metal in existence.
Says who?
I studied engineering in college, Jim.
When I see things, l see them.
What'd you see?
Rearden's plans, research he's done.
This is the greatest metal on the market.
Dagny, nobody's used Rearden Metal.
We will.
Why do we have to be the first?
Do you wanna save Colorado or not?
I'm not taking responsibility for any of this.
You don't have to take responsibility, Jim.
I will.
Just know that this is the consequence of your policies.
Which policies?
Your 13-month experiment with Orren Boyle, for one.
The Mexican catastrophe, for another.
The bottom line is that...
...we are going to fix the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal.
I'm going to Philadelphia tonight to finalize the deal with Hank Rearden.
You're lucky.
What?
Other people are human.
They're sensitive.
They can't just dedicate their whole lives to metals and engines.
You've never had any feelings.
I don't think you've ever felt a thing.
No, Jim.
I guess I've never felt anything at all.
MAN [ON PA]:
All passengers for Train 1210.
Taggart Transcontinental....
Thanks.
[MAN SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY ON PA]
GWEN:
It's here.
And it's very nice.
Gwen, it's beautiful.
You have more messages, Mr. Rearden.
National Council of Metal lndustries.
File it.
The State Science Institute.
File it.
United Metal Workers Guild.
[CHUCKLES]
Your last appointment of the day is here.
Miss Taggart?
He'll see you now.
Mr. Rearden?
Miss Taggart.
If you're here for your rails...
...they won't be tempered and cooled for a few days.
I'm just here to discuss our deal.
Please, sit.
So, what's the premium to rush these rails?
Forty thousand dollars a ton.
That's the best price you can give me?
I could charge you double and you'd pay.
You could.
And l would.
But you won't.
Why won't l?
You need to have the Rio Norte rerailed with your new metal.
It will be its first showcase.
And l'm gambling your new metal can do what you say it can.
I'm staking my business on it.
I know what you mean.
Like l said, we need each other.
So if you can have the Rio Norte completely rerailed in nine months...
...l will give you $20,000 a ton.
Deal.
I'm curious.
Is it all right with you...
...that l'm squeezing every penny of profit
I can from your emergency?
I have to get the Rio Norte completely rerailed in nine months...
...or Taggart Transcontinental will crash.
Doing their best to make it harder for you.
Yes, but it's useless to get angry with people...
...like my brother and his friends in Washington.
I don't have time for it.
I have to undo what they've done.
And after?
After, they won't matter anyway.
I was just heading out myself.
Can l walk you to your car?
DAGNY:
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
I walk home most nights.
It gives me a chance to think.
Well, l hope that doesn't catch on.
It would put me out of business.
If your new metal works, have you thought of the implications?
Yeah. Their uses are almost endless.
Naval ships, armor plating, even spacecraft.
Can you imagine a commercial jet twice the size with half the weight?
Commercial airlines.
You really do wanna put me out of business, huh?
PHlLLlP: Remember, there was 20 people--
LlLLlAN: I love this.
I can't believe l did this.
And then--
Well, look who's finally home.
Henry,
Paul's been waiting here for hours.
Hello, Henry.
HENRY: Hey, Paul.
I know. I'm late.
Could have called.
Henry, do you mind holding the 10th of December open for me?
That's three months away.
I don't know what l'm doing next week.
We started a major new pour today.
Oh, cheers.
It's our wedding anniversary, Henry.
December 10th?
Henry isn't interested in anything that doesn't tie in to his work.
I know that you are very busy...
...but l would very much like for you to be there.
Of course, Lillian. I'll be there.
Thank you, dear.
I want it to be special.
Everyone will be there.
REARDEN:
Have you had any dinner, Henry?
No, I was busy working, but I'm not hungry anyway.
That's the trouble with you.
You work too hard.
Mm.
Ooh. What is this?
I had it made from the first pour of Rearden Metal.
You're giving me a railroad spike?
It's wonderful. It is.
It's original.
I'll be the toast of the town wearing a piece of the same metal...
...used to build railroads and bridges and sewer pipes and oil tanks and--
You are so selfish, Henry.
Oh. Phillip, it is not the gift, it's the intention.
The intention's pure selfishness, it seems to me.
I mean, another man would have given his wife a diamond bracelet...
...if he wanted to give her a gift for her pleasure, not his.
No. The, uh, chain is appropriate.
I think it's the chain by which he holds us all in bondage.
Henry's poured his metal today and l have the first trophy.
It's sweet.
It's pathetic, Lilly.
Thank you.
LlLLlAN: I hope you didn't come here for anything.
Henry.
Phillip.
What are you doing with yourself these days?
I'm working for Friends of Global Awareness.
I know them.
What do you want?
Money.
Doesn't everyone?
Call my office first thing in the morning.
I'll authorize a hundred grand for you.
You don't care about helping the underprivileged.
No, Phillip, I don't, but it will make you happy.
It's not for me, Hank.
It's for the benefit of the less privileged.
Do you think I can have the money wired to my account?
A wire? Why?
Well, the thing is it's a progressive group.
They wouldn't appreciate your name on a check.
You're kidding me.
No, it would embarrass us to have you on the list of our contributors.
LARKIN: You shouldn't have given Phillip that money.
By the way,
I don't care what the industry says, Henry.
Rearden Metal, it's terrific.
I just hope you don't run into any trouble.
What trouble?
Well, you're not very popular, Hank.
I haven't had any complaints from my customers.
Yeah? That's not what l mean.
You know what you should do?
You ought to get yourself a good press agent to sell you to the public.
It's my metal l'm selling. Not me.
Thank you.
But you don't want the public against you.
Public opinion, you know, can mean a lot.
As far as l can tell, it doesn't mean a damn thing, one way or another.
The press is against you.
They have time to waste. l don't.
Well, they say you're intractable, you're ruthless.
Your only goal is to make money.
My only goal is to make money.
Yeah, but you shouldn't say it.
Hank, l'm on your side.
How's your man in Washington?
Wesley Mouch?
Well, he's fine, l suppose.
Good.
It's important that your man in Washington is fine.
What are you trying to imply, Paul?
Is there something going on that I should know about?
No. It's nothing.
It's just you don't know who's loyal these days.
What is wrong with the world, Paul?
Why ask useless questions?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
Who is John Galt?
Henry Rearden claims that his steel is lighter than even the cheapest brands...
...but it's 10 times stronger, this is physically impossible, Jim.
You're inviting disaster if you use it.
Dagny is, not me.
Well, something has to be done.
Agreed.
I believe you know Wesley Mouch,
Rearden's man in Washington.
You know what l like about you, Wesley?
You're a one-word man.
True.
BOYLE: All right, something has got to be done about the iron ore shortage.
It threatens the very existence of the steel industry.
I don't think it's fair that one company has its own supply.
Rearden Steel.
BOYLE: Exactly.
It's not in the public interest to let one man destroy an entire industry.
If we're gonna bring Rearden down we should do it from the inside.
MOUCH:
Under my guidance, of course.
The National Council of Metal lndustries has completed a report...
...that draws public opinion against Rearden Metal.
Excuse me, I just wanna make sure that Hank doesn't get hurt.
Paul, it's his own fault.
He's not exactly open to competition.
A monopoly. To be exact.
BOYLE:
We are working on a bill.
It's called
The Equalization of Opportunity.
It proposes to limit the number of businesses...
...that any one person owns to one business.
However, we're gonna need your help, Jimmy.
We need you to grease the palms of your politicians...
...in order to get legislation we're spearheading passed.
What will Taggart Transcontinental get in return?
I can see to it that the exclusive grip...
...that Dan Conway's Phoenix/Durango railroad has in Colorado...
...can come to a halt.
Paul, this is not personal.
MOUCH: Everybody needs to share the burdens we face.
Especially Rearden.
[GROUP LAUGHING]
MOUCH: lsn't that Francisco D'Anconia?
BOYLE: That's him.
Francisco.
BOYLE: Throwing away his daddy's money.
Did you get in on that ore mine deal in Mexico?
We all did.
He may be a slacker, but he makes business investments that pay off.
Well, that's it for me, gentlemen.
I have to go too.
Um, Mr. Taggart. Orren.
Uh, Paul, uh, maybe you'd like a lift in my limo?
Of course. Thank you.
Please. This way.
Gentlemen.
TAGGART: Good night, Paul.
MOUCH: Orren.
Wesley.
Jim? What is it?
Well, if he's such a great businessman...
...then why hasn't a single train filled with ore left Mexico yet?
Isn't that what we invested in?
BOYLE: D'Anconia has invested billions developing their infrastructure.
But he also bought in himself.
He must know something.
TAGGART: What are you thinking?
BOYLE: I think it's the ore reserves.
I think they must be huge.
Well, the success of my Mexican expansion depends on those mines, Orren.
Uh, sure.
This time next year,
Phoenix/Durango needs to be a memory.
Thank you, Mr. McNamara.
I look forward to working with you as well.
McNAMARA: Frankly,
I appreciate working directly with you.
DAGNY: My pleasure. Goodbye.
McNAMARA: Goodbye.
Who was that?
I found an excellent contractor to takeover the rebuilding of the Rio Norte Line.
That was quick.
You'd be surprised how quickly things get done when you do some actual work...
...and don't rely on political favors.
Is this accurate? Just one passenger train per day on the Mexican line?
And one freight every other night?
Yes.
How are the Mexicans gonna develop the area...
...with a single passenger train once a day?
They're not, Jim.
You should know I moved everything of value out of Mexico a month ago.
There's nothing for looters once the Mexicans nationalize.
That Mexican line was helping those destitute people get back in the game.
And it was great PR for this company.
I would have happily put a railroad in Mexico...
...if there was a reason to build up the region...
...but l didn't see one.
You can't just take everything away from people who need our help.
Move.
Okay.
Miss Taggart?
Oh. Hello, Owen, please, have a seat.
OWEN:
Thank you.
Um....
I've have come to give you my resignation.
Effective immediately.
Why?
For a personal reason.
Are you dissatisfied here?
No.
Have you received a better offer?
No.
I'm sorry, I don't understand, are you ill?
No.
Are you leaving the city?
No.
But you no longer wish to work for Taggart Transcontinental?
Miss Taggart, l assure you...
...um, no person, matter or event connected to my job...
...has anything to do with my decision to leave.
I actually called you in here today to offer you a promotion.
I wanted you to manage the Rio Norte Line.
That's very kind of you, Miss Taggart...
...but, um, my decision has been made.
I'll double what any other railroad is offering.
I won't be working for any railroad.
But you will be working?
Yes, um--
Look, l came to tell you l'm leaving...
...because I promised you once that l would and l wanna keep my word.
Write your own ticket, Owen.
Name your price.
I want you to stay.
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.
So there's nothing l can offer you?
Nothing, nothing on Earth.
I'm sorry, Owen, l have to ask and l'd like the truth.
Why are you leaving?
Who is John Galt?
[SIGHS]
All done then?
Where are you going?
I have some work to do.
Fix me a drink?
Of course.
[PHONE RlNGING]
Miss Taggart?
Am l calling too late?
Not at all. What's going on?
Nothing.
Well, um...
...something.
I don't know why l thought of calling you.
HENRY [OVER PHONE]:
It's fine, Dagny.
What happened?
One of my best employees quit today.
Owen Kellogg.
I was actually grooming him for a management position...
...and he just up and left.
He couldn't even tell me why.
He just said:
"Who is John Galt?"
Why are so many great men disappearing?
It's going to be okay, Dagny.
You know, when you say that,
I actually believe it.
HENRY:
Dagny, what we're doing...
...my metal, your railway--
It's us who move the world...
...and it's us who will pull it through.
I know.
Goodnight.
Richard McNamara?
I'm McNamara.
Are you here from Taggart Transcontinental?
No, I'm not.
What are you selling, pal?
Nothing, I'm simply offering a society that cultivates individual achievement.
I know where such a place exists.
BOYLE [OVER PHONE]:
And then we do what?
We say its purpose is to prevent destructive competition between railroads.
We build public opinion...
...against encroachment on existing train routes then--
And then the National Alliance of Railroads proposes a rule.
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.
Every member must subordinate...
...his own interests for the collective needs of the industry.
But, in fact, we're squeezing
Dan Conway out of Colorado.
You are thinking like a politician, Jimmy.
WOMAN [ON TV]: Mexican authorities seized land throughout the country today.
Most affected were the San Sebastian Mines...
...where international playboy
Francisco D'Anconia...
...and other investors, including Taggart Transcontinental...
...and Associated Steel have reportedly lost billions.
The San Sebastian Line has been seized by the Mexican government.
It's been nationalized as Dagny predicted.
An emergency board meeting has been called.
TAGGART: l can assure you that there is no need for panic.
And l have full confidence that our government...
...will negotiate an equitable settlement with Mexico.
I foresaw the possibility of this type of event...
...and took every precaution to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.
Several months ago, l ordered Operations to cut the schedule...
...on the San Sebastian Line down to a single train a day...
...and to remove everything of value from Mexico.
Now, because of my actions...
...billions of company dollars have been saved.
[ALL APPLAUDlNG]
No, this is no trick.
I checked it all out, Jimmy.
D'Anconia used his own cash and now he has lost it all in those mines.
He is too smart for that.
He must have something up his sleeve.
Well, let's hope so.
What do your friends in Washington think?
They don't know anything.
Well, he knows something.
And we need to find out what it is and get in on it too.
Ruth Anne, why haven't you gotten me a meeting with D'Anconia yet?
RUTH ANNE: I wasn't able to get a meeting.
Why not?
RUTH ANNE: Senor D'Anconia says that you bore him, Mr. Taggart.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
There's something else, Dagny.
There was a call just now from the Rio Norte branch in Colorado.
Richard McNamara never showed up for work.
Well, go find him.
EDDlE:
Well, we've looked and we found a note.
DAGNY: What did it say?
It said, "Who is John Galt?"
What does that mean?
EDDlE: Was explained once.
"Don't ask questions nobody can answer."
Can you get Hank Rearden for me?
EDDIE: He actually called earlier.
He's in town and he wants to know if you're available.
And what did you say?
EDDlE:
He's meeting you at 4:30.
Thanks, Eddie.
We need to talk.
You guys carry on, I'll catch up.
You think I've ruined this company.
Do you and Orren Boyle have a plan for making up for the Mexican line's losses?
Yes, l do.
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.
Wyatt will have to use Taggart Transcontinental...
...because we will be the only railroad in town.
The Phoenix/Durango is a good line, Jim.
Conway put his lifeblood into its success.
You have to take radical steps to survive.
What does that mean?
Go see your old boyfriend, Francisco...
...find out why he screwed us out of billions of dollars?
It will never happen.
You'll never open those old wounds.
DAGNY:
Get me Dan Conway.
I'm Ellis Wyatt.
How can l help you?
WYATT: l'll make this quick.
I came here today because, well, I met your brother...
...and l was hoping someone in this business still had a brain.
If you and your brother try to undermine me...
...or go to the government like you did to destroy my best friend, Dan Conway--
Maybe you should let me explain--
Maybe you should let me finish speaking!
Okay.
EDDlE: Dagny?
Okay.
Now that you have effectively closed down the Phoenix/Durango railroad line...
...because of this new Anti Dog-Eat-Dog bullshit...
...l have no choice but to get back into business with you Taggarts again.
I had nothing to do with the creation of that bill.
I will not lower my business standards to your lousy level of incompetence.
Shall l explain what I intend to do in--
WYATT: No.
Now that l'm forced to use your railroad...
...all l want from you is dependable transportation.
You will get the transportation you need, Mr. Wyatt.
I promise you that.
We'll see.
Is everything all right, Dagny?
I don't know.
Eddie?
Yes, Dagny?
Can you get me a dinner appointment with Francisco D'Anconia?
What about Henry Rearden?
I guess I have two dinner dates then.
In the end, he's right.
If Wyatt fails, Taggart Transcontinental and everyone else around him goes down.
I have 50 miles of my new rail tempered and ready to roll.
With your new rail, l can triple my load capacity but l need more diesel engines.
I barely have enough parts to keep the ones l have working now.
Hmm. Engine parts are hard to come by these days.
I have engines l ordered two years ago and still have not received.
There was a company that made terrific engines years ago...
...uh, in Wisconsin, l think.
It closed suddenly, but they might have machine tools and parts that you can use.
I can look into it if you like.
There is so much at stake.
We have to make it.
Did you get Lillian's invitation to our anniversary party?
I did, thank you.
I can't speak for James, but I will be there.
Good.
Did you hear about Richard McNamara?
I did.
Can you imagine what will happen if this trend continues?
Who will be left to keep things running?
Your brother and his friends in Washington, people like that.
That's depressing.
I have to go.
[CLASSlCAL MUSlC PLAYING]
Ha, ha. Whoo!
That was refreshing.
If you came here in order to remind me how lovely you are...
...well done.
San Sebastian, you did it cold-bloodedly and with full intention.
Wine, please?
No.
Yes.
What is it that l did with full intention?
You knew those mines were worthless.
Why did I invest?
Can you think of a motive?
You knew they were gonna seize those mines, didn't you?
What you were after were your American stockholders.
That's part of the truth.
What is the rest of the truth?
It's for you to figure out.
MAN: And here you are, sir.
I came here because I want you to know
I'm beginning to understand your motives.
If you did, you wouldn't come.
You get a thrill from swindling people in order to watch them squirm.
They provided a spectacle on a grand scale, especially your brother.
He trusted your name and your honor.
They did, they did. l'm aware of that.
Do you find this amusing?
Not at all.
Your brother and his friends know nothing of the copper mining industry.
They consider knowledge to be superfluous.
So you did betray them intentionally?
That's for you to decide.
They rode on my brain and on the premise that I wanted to make money.
What happened to you, Francisco?
Where is the man l used to love?
You'll figure it out in time.
Just answer the question, please.
Who is John Galt?
WOMAN [ON TV]:
Plans for a rainy day, national....
Happy anniversary.
I know you're famous for skulking in corners, but be sociable tonight.
For once, please, for me.
The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is set to appear before Congress next week.
The bill, in an effort to control big business monopolies, proposes...
...to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.
Lawmakers feel the bill will help....
Wesley Mouch, please. Hank Rearden.
BRANSON: Police have no leads on the disappearance of Midas Mulligan.
He's not?
BRANSON: A banker by trade, Michael--
No, have him call me back.
BRANSON: Changed his name to Midas....
Can l have one night?
BRANSON: This week, gas prices reached a historic high.
And here you are, Mr. Rearden.
Thank you.
You're quite welcome.
[BAND PLAYlNG JAZZ MUSlC]
Oh, darling, thank you.
Where are you going?
Pardon us, Phillip.
Henry, dear...
...try to have fun.
How could I possibly have more fun than this, Lillian?
You're really a wretched liar, aren't you?
Behave.
Mother?
You look beautiful, Mother.
Hello, Lillian.
Congratulations.
Pardon me one moment.
Hello.
James Taggart.
Lillian.
A little late and a lot gorgeous.
And Dagny.
Mrs. Rearden, how are you?
I'm wonderful.
Tell me, who are you wearing?
Oh, Lennon Couture.
I have often said...
...he is someone who should come back into fashion and here you are.
That is a beautiful bracelet.
Yeah.
Well, you know, Henry had that made for me from his new metal.
He tries, poor thing.
Now, come.
There's some gentleman who wants desperately to meet you.
Here he is, as promised, James Taggart.
Hank.
Dagny.
Oh, excuse me.
To a successful business partnership.
I'll drink to that.
Glad you could make it.
Pardon me.
Honey, uh, there's someone
I want you to meet.
Excuse us.
LlLLlAN: You have to pose for photos later.
HENRY: No.
You promised.
You will do it, I own you tonight.
I'm having a magnificent time.
Good, I'm so glad.
Are you glad? Here--
Okay, what the hell is he doing here?
Well, you can't have a party without inviting Senor D'Anconia if he's around.
You keep him away from me.
I mean it.
Grow up, Henry.
Francisco.
Lillian.
Pardon me.
How are you?
You rogue.
Good to see you.
Two, please.
Did you hear? Balph Eubank is here.
Good.
He said, "Happiness is a delusion of those whose emotions are superficial."
The guy is a genius.
Who are you?
I'm Phillip Rearden.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
[CROWD CHEERING]
Thank you.
Well, congratulations on your 10th anniversary.
CROWD:
Cheers.
Hit it.
[BAND PLAYlNG JAZZ MUSlC]
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
Try the cake, Phillip.
Well, what's great about it?
Okay, Paul?
Well said.
I picked it out because
I know that you love banana...
...and l like chocolate and Mother likes the butter cream.
Mr. Rearden, allow me to introduce myself.
Your reputation precedes you,
Senor D'Anconia.
I'm not a fan.
Then l'll be brief.
I came here tonight just to meet you.
And what did you wanna meet me for?
Help me lose money?
I don't wanna sell anything to you.
Matter of fact, I didn't try to sell the mine to James Taggart either, he came to me.
You wouldn't have.
Exactly.
So, what do you want?
I want to learn to understand you.
[LAUGHlNG]
What for?
If it wasn't for you, most of these people would be left helpless.
Why are you willing to carry them?
Because they're a bunch of miserable children...
...trying to stay alive desperately and very badly.
Have you told them?
Told them what?
You're working for your sake, not theirs.
They know.
Yes, they do.
But they don't think you do.
And what do I care what they think?
Because it's a battle.
A battle in which one must make one's stand clear.
What battle? l don't fight the disarmed.
Oh, they have a weapon against you.
It's their only weapon, but it's a terrible one.
Ask yourself what it is sometime.
There's a reason you're as unhappy as you are.
What exactly is your motive here?
Let us say...
...to give you the words you need for the time when you'll need them.
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Rearden.
Good evening.
Are you having a good time, Dagny?
I am.
Good.
And l really do love that bracelet.
LlLLlAN: I would throw it into the fire if it would burn.
Perhaps, l can take it off your hands?
Are you serious? l was planning on giving it to the maid for her birthday.
Maybe the maid would like this instead.
That's enough, Lillian.
Dagny is just being kind.
LlLLlAN: For God's sake, Henry, be quiet.
Dagny and I are having a negotiation, it seems.
You were saying?
A simple trade.
That bracelet for this necklace.
And it's yours.
Sorry, Hank, I had to.
No, you didn't.
Yes, l did.
And we both know why.
It's nothing.
It's just a useless hunk of metal.
Nice try.
I had a lovely time.
That party took a lot out of me, Henry.
Don't worry.
I didn't come in here for sex.
Thank you, dear.
Why are you here?
The next time you decide to throw a party, can you stick to your own crowd?
Don't bother inviting people you think are my friends.
But, Henry, you don't have any friends.
WOMAN 1 [ON TV]:
And in Colorado this morning...
...work commenced to replace
100-year-old track on the Rio Norte Line....
MAN 1: Some sections of this rail line, one of Taggart's most important...
...have fallen into disrepair over the last decades.
WOMAN 2: The rails of the Rio Norte Line have not been replaced in over 100 years.
MAN 1: This marks the first time Rearden
Steel has been used this extensively...
...in a major railroad construction project in the country.
MAN 2:
Going slow and safe, slow and safe.
MAN 3:
Get two men on that side.
MAN 2:
Pull the pin.
Your speech at this dinner tonight better inspire confidence.
The National Council of Metal Industries...
...is questioning the structural integrity of Rearden Metal.
I just hope you can defend Rearden Metal against Bertram Scudder.
Scudder?
You didn't tell me there would be other speakers.
We want to be objective, hear all sides.
Especially in front of the media.
Objective?
Did you read the hatchet job he did on Hank Rearden in his magazine?
And why is there media at a private dinner?
You're gonna debate Scudder on the safety concerns of Rearden Metal.
Driver?
Pull over.
What are you doing?
I don't need to defend my decision to use Rearden Metal.
But, apparently, you do.
Good luck.
How is it gonna look when we're not there to defend our own proposal?
TAWNY [ON TV]: Taggart construction crews reached the foot of The Rockies this morning.
Over 125 miles of track have been replaced in little over a month...
...with still almost 200 miles more to go.
This is Tawny Johnson reporting from Granby, Colorado.
MAN:
Ease off on that, big bro.
POTTER:
The State Science Institute...
...is simply requesting that you stop production...
...until the economy can stabilize.
The answer is no.
At a time of desperate steel shortages...
...we can't afford to allow the expansion of a company which produces too much...
...and might replace companies which produce too little.
That is how you create an unbalanced economy.
Oh. Well, I tell you what.
If you can answer me one simple question truthfully...
...l'll consider your request.
Is Rearden Metal good or not?
I'm authorized by the government to pay you a very generous sum...
...for the rights to Rearden Metal.
What would seem fair to you?
Tell me if Rearden Metal is good or not and l'll sell you the rights.
I think that's a very selfish question to ask at a time of great economic uncertainty.
Is Rearden Metal good or not?
Answer the question, doctor.
The question of Rearden Metal being good or not is irrelevant.
If Rearden Metal is not good, it's a physical danger to the public.
If it is good...
...it's a social danger.
If you have any proof that
Rearden Metal poses a physical threat...
...show it to me.
Otherwise, we're done here.
Why is it so important for you to struggle for years squeezing out meager gains...
...rather than accept a fortune for Rearden Metal?
Because it's mine.
Do you understand that concept?
Mine.
Why are you taking such a hard-line position?
I don't understand.
I don't think you'll ever understand, doctor.
And Rearden Metal is good.
I can't risk making more switches for you...
...out of that unproven metal.
Too many people think it's unsafe.
What people?
I just don't want any trouble.
Herbert, look.
You've been working with Rearden Metal for four months now.
You know it is the best material available.
What's going on?
I got a family. I need to make money.
I'm trying to survive here.
And you will.
Continue manufacturing my mainline switches.
There have been threats.
Who is threatening you?
The State Science Institute has issued a statement...
...warning people against the use of Rearden Metal.
And what are they saying, exactly?
It's what they're implying.
DAGNY:
It was issued under your name.
Make it a habit of letting the Institute speak for you...
...even if the words it uses are false?
Miss Taggart, it is public opinion that Rearden Metal is unsafe.
What about the truth?
Which truth?
That Rearden Metal is the best material available on the market today.
It's strong, it is safe. You know that.
Please, have a seat.
Please. Consider my side, Miss Taggart.
I work for the last center of science left on Earth.
We do rely on public funding.
Which do l sacrifice?
An excellent piece of smelting or the future of this institute?
Miss Taggart.
Please sit down.
I had three brilliant students...
...that l shared with another
Philosophy professor, Hugh Akston.
Doctor Stadler, l don't understand what this has to do--
We even had a bet.
Who would win over their hearts and minds first?
One of them became a depraved playboy.
His name was Francisco D'Anconia.
I know who he is.
The second, Ragnar Danneskjold, became a pirate...
...stealing to give to the rich.
And the third?
The third one simply vanished.
We were expecting such a magnificent future for them.
I do wish you best of luck, Miss Taggart.
Sorry, l'm late.
Please, continue.
MAN [ON TV]:
Today, the Rio Norte Line...
...completed 211 miles of replaced track using the new Rearden Steel.
WOMAN: According to studies, Rearden's new steel, mined with the latest standard....
MAN: This extensively in a major railroad construction project in the country.
WYATT:
Hello, Dagny.
Mr. Wyatt. Hello.
There was a big-rig pileup a couple of weeks ago.
Landslide closed down the supply line for workers and the rail.
I thought we'd be down for a couple of weeks.
We were back up and running in 24 hours.
I figured someone knew how to manage a crisis up here.
Nice job.
Can't afford to fall behind.
We have to get those rails in place before the first snows come.
I underestimated you.
Hey, Dagny?
If you ever want a job....
I'll keep that in mind.
MAN 1: lt comes from the reservoir.
Make sure it's clean.
HENRY: l was watching you with the workers there.
You look as at home there as you do in that office of yours.
I'm needed here.
This is important.
MAN 2:
Yeah, go ahead.
What you need is to replace that bridge.
DAGNY:
Not a chance.
I have to be ready in six months.
MAN 3: Plenty.
What if I told you l could have it made in three months...
...and that it would last for centuries?
Let me check my budget.
I can make it happen.
Now, l'm staying in town tonight.
I was wondering if you'd like join me for dinner.
I can't.
I have to get back to New York.
But walk with me.
Do you think it can be stopped?
HENRY: This new line or us?
DAGNY: Both.
What's going on, Eddie?
Ben Nealy's quit.
Kellogg, McNamara, now Nealy.
That's not all,
Dagny.
Taggart Transcontinental stocks have plummeted...
...because the State Science Institute has denounced Rearden Metal.
Your family's railroad is in real trouble.
Eddie.
I think it's time to stand on our own.
In order to save my family's business...
...l'm gonna have to abandon it.
SECRETARY:
Good morning, Miss Taggart.
Taggart Transcontinental is done.
What are you talking about?
We're finished.
We can't stop and we can't go on.
In weeks, our stock won't be trading anymore.
You're paranoid. Orren Boyle has assured me there is pending--
Here's what we are gonna do.
And, Jim, this is not a proposal.
Just listen and accept.
I'm gonna take a leave from Taggart Transcontinental.
Start my own company.
You're leaving?
Shut up. You and the board are gonna transfer the Rio Norte Line over to me.
Our stock will go back up.
I will act as my own contractor.
I will get my own financing and finish the line on time.
And where are you gonna get financing?
That is not for you to worry about.
Once we see how the rails perform...
...l will transfer the line back over to Taggart Transcontinental...
...and return to my job.
Okay. And what are you gonna call this new line of yours, Dagny?
You're not dragging the family name through this.
I won't allow it.
The John Galt Line.
Now we know why you've gone off the rails.
That's the name.
It's your disaster.
And what's the plan if you fail?
I go down alone.
Taggart Transcontinental remains in your control.
Two last things.
What?
First, I'm taking Eddie Willers.
Oh, no, no.
I need him here.
Tough.
You're gonna have to do your own work.
Second, keep your cronies in Washington off my back.
Make sure I get all my permissions, grants, authorizations...
...and any other political crap l need from those sons of bitches, otherwise, no deal.
I'll see what l can do.
And one last warning, brother dear.
I have never done anything to hurt a living creature in my entire life.
But if you double-cross me in any way...
...l will destroy you.
DAGNY:
The money would mean nothing to you.
You've wasted that on senseless parties.
You've wasted more in the San Sebastian mines.
I'm afraid I can't. Money's tight.
I've got too many expenses.
Okay.
So, what do you want me to do, Frisco?
Do you want me to beg?
Because now I'm begging.
Ha.
You don't know how.
I thought that you of all people would understand.
Then is it me that you want?
Don't ask me such a thing, Dagny.
If l ever meant anything to you...
...loan me the money that l need.
I can't.
What is this savior line gonna be called?
The John Galt Line.
What?
Because I am tired of hearing that name.
It means quitting, giving up.
And l am not giving up.
I am not going to quit.
I'm going to win.
MAN:
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.
So, what do you think?
Just one last thing.
[PHONE RlNGING]
I'll make sets for you.
No.
Okay.
So maybe you can see about an opportunity....
[PHONE RlNGING]
KEN [OVER PHONE]:
Dagny? Ken Danagger.
I have some good news.
Mr. Rearden, Miss Taggart is--
As president of the John Galt Line...
...l would like to commission a Rearden Metal bridge for Wyatt Junction.
Excellent. I'll start rolling the metal.
Aren't you curious as to how
I'm able to finance this?
Okay, l'll bite.
Ellis Wyatt, Ted Nielsen,
Lawrence Hammond, Kenneth Danagger.
I'm not at 100 percent bonds sold yet, but I am close.
Hmm.
There. l just made up the difference.
I would never ask anyone to take a risk
I wasn't willing to take.
You're a good man, Hank Rearden.
Can l show you something?
GWEN:
Mr. Rearden's office.
No, he's in a meeting.
May I give you his voicemail?
Thank you.
DAGNY: Looks like an engine.
HENRY: Not like any engine I've ever seen.
Where did you find this?
Remember that motor company
I was telling you about in Wisconsin?
I did a little digging around and l found these.
DAGNY:
Twentieth Century Motor Corporation.
It's a prototype for a new engine.
It never went into production.
I'm not even sure the thing works.
Well, it's worth a look.
Once the John Galt line is complete,
I'd like to look into this further.
Care to help?
GWEN: Let me see what l can do.
Absolutely.
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Rearden.
There's an urgent call on line two.
HENRY:
Hank Rearden.
What?
Find Mouch.
What is it?
The legislature passed the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.
So quickly? How is that even possible?
I don't know.
You know what this means?
Nobody can own more than one company.
We'll fix this.
I'll sign away my other companies, but they are not getting my metal.
What about Wyatt's bridge?
I gave my word.
It will be done on time and on budget.
This is just a technicality, Hank.
Okay.
I'll always consider the ore mine as yours.
No.
I either own the property or l don't.
You can trust me.
You know you'll always have as much ore as you need.
I don't know.
I've never given you any reason to mistrust me.
The mine is yours.
If you intend to keep your word, then keep it.
If you wanna give me first call on the ore produced, fine.
If you intend to double-cross me...
...so be it.
It's not fair, Hank.
It wasn't me who passed the law.
DAGNY:
That is correct.
The first train on the John Galt Line will run July 22nd.
MAN: Great news. Thank you, Dagny.
My pleasure, thank you.
Dagny, this is, uh, Mr. Brady, a delegate from the Union of Locomotive Engineers.
You're busy. l'll be brief.
We're not gonna allow you to run that train.
Get out of here.
You do not come and tell me what you will or will not allow me to do.
What l meant to say was a committee decided...
...that allowing men to run your train on that untested metal...
...would violate their human rights.
Are you serious, Mr. Brady?
You can't force men to go out and get killed for profit.
Put that in writing.
That you want to stop your men from working and earning a wage.
Miss Taggart, you don't understand--
DAGNY:
Oh, no, no, no. l understand perfectly.
You want me to provide the jobs...
...and you wanna make it impossible for me to have any jobs to provide.
You can do whatever you want with your men.
But that train will run if l have to drive myself.
Because, Mr. Brady, if that bridge collapses...
...there won't be any railroad left in existence.
But if it does not collapse...
...no member of your union will ever get a job...
...on the John Galt Line.
Now are you going to forbid your men to run that train?
I never used the word forbid.
I'm only stating that you cannot force anyone to take that run.
I would never force a man to do anything.
I'll ask for volunteers.
Then it will be my problem, not yours.
I'll advise them to refuse.
Do what you want, Mr. Brady.
But leave them the choice.
MAN [ON TV]: We have breaking news from Cheyenne, Wyoming...
...where the maiden run of the
John Galt Line is about to commence...
...despite numerous warnings from the State Science Institute.
Two hundred fifty miles per hour all the way.
The John Galt Line's the future of rail travel.
We're gonna prove it today.
REPORTER:
Miss Taggart, who is John Galt?
We are.
One hundred.
One fifty.
One seventy-five.
Two fifty.
That's faster than any train has ever gone in this country.
There she is.
We did it.
[TRAIN BELL RlNGING]
MAN [ON TV]: Today in Colorado, the John Galt Line made a successful run...
...over its new Rearden Metal bridge.
The controversial metal bridge held up perfectly...
...despite strong warnings from the State Science Institute.
WYATT: Three hundred miles in less than 90 minutes.
Was there ever any doubt?
No, because there was no doubt
I prepared a meal for the two of you.
SECRETARY [OVER INTERCOM]:
Orren Boyle is on the line.
BOYLE [OVER PHONE]:
Did you see?
I'm watching it now.
If the John Galt Line succeeds, it's gonna make Wyatt unstoppable.
Now, what can be done?
MOUCH: Don't you see?
It's his own success that provides us the tools to bring him down.
He's not only given us the rope, he's tied the knot.
All we have to do is slip it over his head.
This might work to our advantage.
[SHOUTING]
I love it. Here we go.
[INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE]
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHlNG]
Oh, yeah, you want that.
So?
And he said,
"It smells like museo de las poopias."
[ALL LAUGHING]
I want to tell both of you something.
Do you know the Buena Esperanza Pass?
Well, yeah, the Buena Esperanza Pass.
That area has been dry for years.
WYATT:
Ah. To conventional drilling, yes.
There is an untapped reservoir of oil in those rocks...
...which is larger than any known reserve in the Saudi Peninsula.
And underneath is an ocean of natural gas.
Soon everyone will be wanting to get on the bandwagon.
And, my friends, we are the band.
I will drink to that.
Hear, hear.
To Colorado and the New Renaissance.
And forget about the Stone Age and the lron Age.
Let's have a toast to the Age of Rearden Metal.
And the John Galt Line.
Ahem. Well, l can see that the market has opened in Hong Kong.
I have some phone calls to make.
You have been charming company, but I must excuse myself.
There are guest rooms upstairs.
Help yourself.
Thank you for everything.
My pleasure, partner.
Sir.
Sir.
My, uh, casa es su casa, and so on.
Good night.
Good night.
HENRY:
Good night.
It's good to know there are men like Wyatt left in the world.
I wish I could hold myself in the same esteem.
I have a wife.
And somewhere l have a company that's being pulled apart.
Yet here we are.
And all l wanna do right now is kiss you.
What's stopping you?
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Ellis Wyatt?
Yes?
Could l have a moment of your time?
WYATT:
At this hour? Who the hell are you?
MAN:
My name is familiar to you.
HENRY:
Good morning. Where's Wyatt?
DAGNY:
Morning.
You're up early.
I didn't want to wake you.
Look at this.
He thanked us and he's looking forward to the Second Renaissance. That's it.
Odd.
Mm-hm.
So l was thinking.
I thought we might take a trip, a little getaway.
How scandalous.
You're a married man.
MAN:
There you go, sir.
Where are we going?
You remember that folder with the strange engine?
Yeah.
I thought we might visit the Twentieth
Century Motor Company in Wisconsin.
When do we leave?
DAGNY: It's a real mystery why the
Twentieth Century Motor Company failed.
HENRY: lt's no mystery.
Bad ideas brought it down.
DAGNY:
Ideas?
HENRY: As I understand it, the company flattened the wage scale...
...and still paid everyone according to their needs...
...not according to their contributions.
DAGNY: Why all these stupid altruistic urges? lt's not being charitable or fair.
What is it with people today?
HENRY:
So after a short while, no surprise...
...the smartest managers and the better workers left the company.
But hundreds of remaining staff couldn't handle it alone.
Service dropped...
...quality in their once-great products was gone, and that was that.
The Twentieth Century Motor Company went under.
That's depressing.
Looks like they just walked away.
Not much here.
It's too bad.
I'd really like to figure out what happened here.
Dagny.
This is it.
This is where they made the engine.
Do you think it's here?
Why would they leave all this stuff here?
Some of this is incredibly sophisticated.
It's unbelievable.
Hank?
Atmospheric vacuum.
What?
This motor uses the Casimir effect.
It's this small particle accelerator.
It throws small helium particles into heavier particles.
And this must be a secondary cooling system.
Probably designed to eliminate excess heat generated during the process.
Exactly, and this creates a magnetic field in place long enough...
...for the collapsing vacuum pressure to be captured.
An engine that uses atmospheric vacuum to create static electricity.
Now, does it say anywhere on this document who designed this thing?
I don't see any names.
We could get a list of the building employees.
We'd go to the town hall of records.
Find the last owner of the factory.
We'd track it back from there.
Dagny, this could change the world.
That factory has had a long line of owners and the records are not complete.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Okay.
So l guess this is our starting point.
I bought it in a bankruptcy sale.
From a guy named Eugene Lawson.
Do you got any idea how we might contact Mr. Lawson?
He's in Washington now.
At the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, I think.
My goal is social progress, universal prosperity.
Welfare of the nation is my primary consideration...
...to which l wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice anyone's profit.
Well, Mr. Rearden, you must be awfully proud of your man Mouch.
He's doing big things in Colorado to help the nation.
I no longer have interest in Mr. Mouch.
Oh.
I see.
Well, that's, uh-- That's too bad.
Jed Starnes.
Excuse me?
Jed Starnes.
He was an engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
I hope that helps.
My father was an evil man.
But surely, he must have mentioned something about work?
A motor perhaps?
The chief engineer was William Hastings.
He quit the day after we introduced the plan.
You'll find him in Brandon, Wyoming.
MRS. HASTINGS: My husband died five years ago, Miss Taggart.
DAGNY:
Did he ever mention a motor he created?
It was his young assistant.
William always said he was, oh, ahead of his time.
Called him a genius.
Do you know where we might be able to find that man today?
Oh, l have no idea.
He did keep in touch with a professor that he had at the Patrick Henry University.
Hugh Akston was his name.
I know that name.
Do you know where he is?
Well, Mr. Akston was rumored to have opened a roadside diner near Cheyenne.
HENRY:
I gotta get back to my mills.
Now?
I have a business to run.
We can't quit now, Hank.
You're so close.
Imagine what will happen if we find the inventor and get it up and running.
HENRY: Okay, give me a few days.
I'll meet you in Colorado.
Hi, Dagny. Hank.
I'm back.
I just want to see how you're doing.
DAGNY: I'm great.
I'm heading up to Akston's diner now.
Eddie on the other line, l'll call you back.
Hey, Eddie, what's up?
The Union of Locomotive Engineers is demanding...
...that all trains on the John Galt Line be reduced from 100 to 60 miles an hour.
If we don't comply, as of right now...
...Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah are not allowing any trains into Colorado.
This is madness.
EDDIE: That's not all, Dagny.
Orren Boyle is campaigning for a bill...
...that would limit the production of Rearden Metal.
Is that my sister on the phone?
Let me talk to her.
Where the hell are you?
Do you have any idea what's happening here?
Jim, this is your battle. l've fought mine.
They're your friends. You stop them.
Dr. Akston, I was wondering if you remember a young engineer...
...who worked at the Twentieth Century
Motor Corporation about 10 years ago.
He worked with a man named William Hastings.
Could you tell me where to find him?
Does this car get good mileage?
Is he still alive?
Is there anything that you can tell me?
I've traveled a very long way to be here.
Yeah.
You got a long way to go too.
Excuse me. I have to be heading home.
Dr. Akston? One more question.
I need the name of your student who worked at Twentieth Century Motor--
I know why you're here, Miss Taggart.
Do you?
The secret you're trying to solve, it's greater...
...and l mean much greater than an engine that runs on atmospheric electricity.
Good luck.
DAGNY: I'm not gonna give up trying to find the inventor of that motor.
AKSTON: Oh, don't worry, Miss Taggart.
He'll find you.
WOMAN: You all set?
MAN 1: Yeah.
WOMAN:
Okay.
MAN 2 [ON TV]:
The Equalization of Opportunity Laws.
Coffee?
Yes.
Anything else?
We got rhubarb pie. Made it myself.
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Again, l think it's significant in helping the broad spectrum....
Could you turn that up, please?
MAN 2:
Government is overstepping its bounds?
MOUCH:
Colorado is a rich state.
It's quite unique. It's in a position where it can help its neighborhood needier states.
So I think it's a good thing, yes.
MAN 2: And it's fair to penalize one state?
MOUCH: Please.
You're not penalizing another state.
You're helping another state.
MAN 2: Like a Robin Hood of taking from the rich, feeding the poor.
I mean, rich people are getting richer, poor people are getting poorer.
I heard about what Orren Boyle is up to.
Call me.
BRANSON: Breaking news out of Wyatt Junction, Colorado.
A major fire has erupted at the Wyatt Oil Field.
Reports are coming in that several explosions have rocked the hillside.
Our news team has captured this unedited footage on the scene.
MAN 3: As you can see, the hillside behind me is completely engulfed in flames.
Fire crews have been brought in from as far away as Denver County...
...to help battle the blaze, as many as 40 acres....
And zero containment at the moment.
ANNOUNCER [ON RADlO]:
My fellow Americans, Mr. Wesley Mouch.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Thank you. Thank you.
As the new coordinator...
...of the Bureau of Economic Planning...
...and National Resources...
...l have issued a set of directives.
I am placing a moratorium on all railroad lines.
Additionally, under my direction...
...all steel mills must produce steel at the same level and output...
...and distribute it according to the needs of the people.
Furthermore, big companies will no longer be permitted...
...to abandon their present states and move to wealthier states like Colorado.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Finally, a federal tax will be applied to the state of Colorado...
...in order to equalize the national economy.
[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Thank you.
He gave a good speech.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

WYATT:
Who the hell are you?
GALT:
My name is John Galt.
I live in a place we call Atlantis.
And l think you'd fit in there.
It's a place where heroes live.
And where those who want to be heroes live.
The government we have there...
...respects each of us as individuals and as producers.
Actually, beyond a few courthouses, there's not much of a government at all.
Bottom line, Mr. Wyatt...
...if you're weary of a government that refuses to limit power over you...
...and if you're ready to claim the moral right to your own life...
...then we should leave.
And l'll take you there.
I'll take you to Atlantis.
[YELLING]
No!
WYATT:
This is Ellis Wyatt. I'm gone.
Don't try to find me. You won't.
I am on strike.
[English - US - PSDH]
I don't know, feels like a grave.
Their queen is here.
And we have our orders.
It's a trap.
This is what is known.
There has always been man.
And there have always been vampires.
Since the beginning, the two have been locked in conflict.
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.
But man had the sun.
It was not enough.
And so it went like this over many years.
The two races destroying not only each other ... but the world itself.
Facing extinction, mankind withdrew behind walled cities under the protection of the Church.
And then the ultimate weapon was found, the priests.
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained by the Church in the art of vampire combat.
They alone turned the tide to man.
The remaining vampires were placed on reservations.
And fearing the power of the weapon they created ... the ruling clergy ordered the priests disbanded.
The former warriors to be integrated back into a society that no longer needed them.
And as the years passed, the few surviving priests faded into obscurity...
...like the vampire menace before them.
Residual radiation is still spotty, but the soil contamination is close to zero.
With a little luck, we can finally start planting.
I'm proud of you, Owen.
Great, stew again.
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?
Wearing the nicest dress, where else would you have been all day, but church?
I was in town.
I figure someone here needs a life outside this outpost.
I thought I said I didn't want you to spending so much time out there.
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.
I know it's hard, but we all have to make sacrifices.
Sacrifices?!
You mean living out here like a prisoner?!
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!
Just that someday you might be able to grow something in these godforsaken lands?
Enough!
Bow your heads and say grace.
Dear Lord, we thank you for what we are about to receive...
- Daddy?
- Shush!
- Owen?
- Tear down below!
What's going on?!
Hurry child!
Hurry!
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.
Oh, my god!
Get behind me!
Shannon!
God protects you, the
Church protects you.
The city protects you.
Absolution is the only way.
Absolution is the only way.
Remember, to against the Church, means to go against God.
Confession room 5 is free.
Move forward.
Initiate confessional sequence.
Please speak at the tone.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again
- about the war.
- Tell me more.
We were in the hives, like always.
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.
Tell me more.
I have questions, doubts.
The Devil comes in many shapes.
The best way to combat him, is through personnel sacrifice... and a long day's labor.
Yes, Father.
Now say three Hail Mary's and four Our Father's.
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?
It's a tattoo.
Did it hurt?
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt bad.
He told me where to find you.
- And Shannon?
- No.
Lucy talked about you.
Said you were a hero during the war.
Said that when it came to killing vampires, you were the best.
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.
Just thought I should let you know in case you wanted to come along.
Figure I could use someone like you by my side.
Okay.
Thank you for meeting me in such short notice, Monsignors.
Monsignor Chamberlain has informed us of the situation.
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.
I come before you because I need my authority reinstated.
On what grounds?
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?
Nonsense, we've had no reports of any escapes from the reservations.
This is obviously the work of wasteland bandits.
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands are heavens for the lawless and the immoral...
To send a priest out there after such a lot would be both ridiculous and futile.
This is best left to the local authority.
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been of great service to the Church.
If it weren't for the priest we would have been overrun by the...
We are well aware of his accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.
Thank you, you may sit.
I am begging you.
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.
And the citizens from the cities have complete faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?
Questioning the authority of the clergy is absolutely forbidden.
If you take any action to leave the cities... it will be seem as an act of aggression against the Church.
You will be stripped from the order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
I said, do I make myself clear, father?
Yes, Monsignor.
Try to remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Come on now. Don't be shy.
Give us a kiss.
That's no way to treat a friend.
Please, let me go...
You're in here for your own protection.
If I let you out, you'll be torn apart, piece by piece.
My uncle's a priest, he'll come after me.
Really?
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.
He'll come after you!
Well that's something
I'm absolutely counting on.
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.
I sacrificed everything to serve them.
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.
You and the other priests did your jobs.
It's not over, not for me.
You can't break your covenant on a small ... group of savages, it would be sacrilege.
I have to.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!
If you go out there right now, you risk stirring things up again.
You have to look at the bigger picture, it's for the greater good.
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.
But it's the only world we have left.
I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish.
Remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Then I go against God.
God help us.
Dear Father, forgive me.
It was never my intention to offend you.
I would like to firmly resolve with the help of your grace... to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
But I can't.
Looting's not such a good idea mister.
Well, I'll be damned.
Vampires are a vicious lie!
I have seen a vampire bite a man clean in half.
Salvation is right here in my very hands.
Authenticated by the clergy themselves...
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...
I'm tired of you comin' around here, scaring people, selling your superstition.
The show is over, and it's time for you to go.
Give me one good reason why I should.
That's one... two...
Alright. Alright, alright!
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You all listen up!
This stuff is good for nothin'... but lining for that man's pockets for your hard earned cash!
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.
Move out of the way!
I don't blame any of you for being scared, but the vampires are gone and they're not coming back.
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.
Is it true what they say about priests?
You wield the hand of God?
How is he?
He's awake.
Your clergy took away a boy... and returned an old man.
After the war was over...
Shannon figured you'd come back.
I wanted to.
Didn't seem right any more.
I couldn't save her.
I tried, but I've never had your gift.
You gave her a life
I no longer could.
I will always be grateful to you for that.
You know there ain't one day that went by, where I wished she'd forget about you.
You find Lucy, you bring her home safe.
And you promise me something brother.
Kill 'em all.
Most people out there know that the clergy thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.
And that's how we like it. It means that they tend to keep their noses out of our business.
So you can imagine how surprised I was when they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.
Saying that anyone going after Lucy is to be arrested immediately.
Said she's in God's hands now.
Problem is, we both now outside a week Lucy will be dead... or worse, infected.
So with all due respect to god...
You're wasting your time.
No, no! You're not cutting me out of this!
I'm the one that came and got you!
People in this town don't think you can keep them safe here.
What makes you think you'll do any good out there?
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.
We leave at dawn.
What's with all the bullets anyway?
I thought priests didn't use firearms.
We don't.
They're for you.
You have been called to serve once more.
One of your own has broken his sacred vow.
His actions are a threat to the entire order.
You will find him and bring him back to me.
Dead or alive.
Then I will teach transgressed your ways and return them back to you.
Save me from blood guilt... and god who saves me and my tongue... will sing of your righteousness... in my mouth declare your prays...
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random... in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time, but these are two by two.
Must have been some of the familiars.
Vampires don't bring familiars in the hunt, they slow them down.
All this... this was something else.
Tracks head north.
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.
Mangshane Reservation.
Nothing but red-outs and rejects.
They're a fallen tribe.
Either way, we don't have much time to get in and out.
No guards.
I thought familiars were illegal.
Nobody really enforces it, as long as it's voluntary.
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.
Drifters that want to get infected.
I mean becoming a vampire so they may live among them.
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves... it makes no difference to me.
You're not welcome here, Priest.
These lands are protected.
No! I got this.
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.
It's the way we like it. Nice... and quiet.
Good, we're sure we won't have any trouble.
They excrete it, use it to build the hives.
I guess now we know what happened to the guards.
No. No, no, you must not...
The Master will be angry...
Where's the girl?
I don't know what you're talking about. Please! Please!
The Master doesn't feed humans anymore.
Yeah, tell that to the guards.
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...
Where is she?
Shit!
Priest! Priest!
Save your bullets.
Now, we can do this the easy way or...
God. I always preferred the hard way.
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.
They once ruled this land, they were warriors, they were Gods.
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.
Then 10 seconds is all I need.
You're too late, Priest.
It is their time now.
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?
You're gonna need it.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.
For thou art with me.
Focus!
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.
No more masters, just you and me.
Tell me where they took the girl.
- West. They took her west.
- Why?
You have no idea what's coming, Priest.
The familiar said they travel west from here.
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?
One of the largest.
But I thought all of the hives were liquidated after the war.
They were.
That's why we need to go look.
There are more than 50 creeps in this reservation.
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.
They left behind.
We find the missing one, we find Lucy.
I may not have seen the war... but I know the look a man gets when he likes killing.
It comes easy to you.
It just comes.
Easy's got nothing to do with it.
Give me your gun.
- What?
- Give me your gun.
Vampires don't move like humans.
Their body weight pulls them in concentric patterns.
You need to anticipate their trajectory to get a kill shot.
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.
There are always two points.
A and B.
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.
A man came aboard.
Says he got something for you.
You told me to come.
I have information, but I... before I tell you, I hate to bring this up.
But there is this small little matter of compensation.
Now, you've been really good for business.
So I am more than willing to cut you a deal.
I can smell the blood running through you veins?
Smells like dinner.
Okay. Alright.
After you snatched the girl, a couple of nights later, a priest showed up.
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff, real hard case. He run me out of town before I could make a single sell.
- You've done well.
- Thank you.
There's your compensation.
Put him to work.
I used to ride out a lot here when I was little.
Stared at all this stuff.
Wondered what it used to be.
After a while, it just made my eyes ache.
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?
No, no.
She wanted to tell him, but...
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.
Besides, he was so focused on his work there wasn't much room for anything else.
Do you love her?
You know if she's infected...
I'll kill her.
You'll try... but you won't be able to.
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.
This is a waste of time, there's nothing here.
Stay here, if anything comes up that isn't me, shoot it.
Great.
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.
They sent four of us to track you.
We split up at Nightshade.
I rode out here and hoped they didn't have you.
The others went up to Jericho.
I didn't believe it when they told me you broke your vow.
They left me no choice.
Hicks!
What the hell is that thing?
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!
It's too big to get down here.
Which is the only reason you're still alive.
Who the hell is that?
Are you ready?
Hey!
Not bad.
Point A, meet point fucking B.
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?
Does the lawman know what you'll do if she's infected?
He knows.
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.
It's been hard all these years... not seeing the others, not talking.
Sector 7 was the only place I could find work.
Waste management.
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."
I heard that, too.
I didn't come here to bring you back.
I came here to warn you.
There are nights when I wake up...
I think I'm back on the red mines.
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched like, like I'm ready for something.
Nights like that,
I don't go back to sleep.
I have bad dreams.
Me, too.
There are other nights, the good nights...
I dream about other things.
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.
My God.
They bread a new army.
Where did they all go?
Only one way to find out.
Are priests allowed to have relations?
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...
I was a young girl when the Clergy found me.
What about him?
His talents developed later.
He was nearly you're age when the Clergy came for him.
That made his sacrifice greater than most.
The air is changing.
Well, there's your answer.
They dug right through the mountain and... made a hole big enough to fit an army through.
What town is that?
It's Jericho.
Where'd you say the others went?
What the hell?
Hello?!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
Let's begin.
I don't see anything.
Brothers, you have a choice.
You can follow in my footsteps or you can follow in his.
We're too late.
We separate. Go through each building, and see what we find.
There's nobody left. Not a soul.
Too many mouths to feed.
Killing three priests? What kind of vampire could do something like that?
Nothing we've ever seen before.
How could they take an entire town over night, and vanish by sunrise?
There are no other hives around here, no reservations.
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.
It starts in the Dunkirk mine above Augustine.
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.
Heading back to the cities would be suicide, right?
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.
Not anymore.
Without us, they're defenseless.
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.
Whoever took Lucy knew that you'd come for her... and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.
They must have been picking up different factions along the way, moving during the day and feeding at night.
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.
Train carrying an army of vampires?
What chance do we have stopping something like that?
I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line.
You two get aboard and find Lucy.
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have to stop that train before it reaches the cities.
You must be starving.
You haven't eaten in days.
Have you ever had a real roast duck?
It's very rare, very exotic.
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.
I want to be free from a life of suffering and sacrifice.
To no longer be told that your every desire is a sin.
And after all, if you're not committing sin, you're no longer having fun.
What are you?
The Church teaches us that the eyes are the window to the soul... and since the vampire evolved without eyes, it is a soulless creature... to be eradicated.
And I have seen the soul of the vampire.
And let me tell you... it is far more pure than that of any man.
Now you ask me what I am?
I am the bringer of the tide...
I am the wave to wash clean this unclean world.
And you and your priest... will help me do it.
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
If she's infected?
She talked about him.
Said she never got to known him.
She wanted to.
What kind of man would kill his own flesh and blood?
If she becomes a familiar, she's no ones flesh and blood.
Not anymore.
I've held on to it all these years... to remind me of everything they've stripped away from us.
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...
Today when we ride,
I want you to remember our power doesn't come from the Church... it comes from God.
With or without the Clergy, we're still priests.
I can't.
When I heard what happened to Shannon...
I prayed for her salvation.
And then I prayed for mine.
Because in the darkness of my heart...
I hoped her death would free you at last.
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.
Tell me, or I will shoot you where you stand.
It would be easier to face you bullet here than face what may lie up ahead.
Why do you even care?
She is nothing but a stranger to you.
She's his daughter.
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.
The child needed a father.
We all made sacrifices.
Hicks.
If you do this, it won't matter if you find Lucy.
It won't stop the train, and you won't be able to save her.
You won't save her.
We ride out and meet this together.
When the time comes, you blow the tracks and then you get out of there!
What if you're still on the train?
Good-luck.
Focus!
Holy shit.
Hello, my friend.
- You fell!
- You let go!
In the depths of that hive, I crossed the threshold between life and death.
And do you know what I found?
The queen we had come to kill, my angel of mercy.
She turned me into something that had never existed in this world.
A human vampire.
Join me.
Accept the blood of the queen.
And together we can return to the cities... as brothers.
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.
You can't win.
I'm stronger now than you ever were.
This is your last chance, Priest.
The queens hands have not been idle.
Mankind will find no quarter from what's coming.
Join me, and your life of sacrifice will be over.
Never.
Hicks!
Lucy!
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?
I couldn't get close.
They took her to the front.
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.
Don't let it go to your head.
- Hicks!
- Lucy!
No!
Stop it!
No, Lucy!
Very good!
Fast.
Just like your father.
He never told you?
Oh, god!
Burn.
At this time of need, strengthen me.
You are my refuge and strength...
I do not fear, for you are with me.
I won't let you go!
Your faith has failed you!
No!
For the life of the flesh is in the blood.
And I have given it to you upon the altar... to make atonement for your souls.
How dare you come back to this holy place?
A man who would defy the Church, for his own selfish crusade!
Look inside the burning train just behind these cities walls... you'll find hundreds more like it.
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!
This man is a charlatan.
A risk to the security of the cities.
There is no vampire menace!
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.
It's just beginning.
I've notified the others. We'll meet you at the rendezvous at City 7.
Godspeed!

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a baby girl was born.
Her skin was pure as snow.
Her hair was dark as night.
- (BABY CRYING)
- They called her Snow White.
Probably because that was
the most pretentious name
they could come up with.
As fate would have it,
Snow White's mother died in childbirth.
Left on his own...
- (GIRL GIGGLING)
- ... her father spoiled the young girl.
He could afford to, of course.
He was the king.
The king loved his daughter,
- and all his subjects loved him.
- (CROWD CHEERING)
The kingdom was a happy place,
where people danced
and sang day and night.
Apparently,
no one had a job back then.
Just singing and dancing
all day and all night.
But I digress.
The king raised
the little girl by himself,
grooming her to one day lead.
But over time, he realized
there were some things
he couldn't teach her.
So he sought out a new queen.
This queen was
the most beautiful woman in the world.
She was intelligent and strong.
And just to clarify, she was me.
And this is my story. Not hers.
Bewitched by my beauty,
the king begged me to marry him.
I was everything to him:
The stars, the moon.
But a dark magic invaded the land.
The brave king bid farewell
to Snow White,
leaving her his favorite dagger.
An interesting gift,
but more on that later.
He rode off into the dark woods
and, sadly, was never seen again.
Snow White searched and searched
for her father,
and when she realized
he was truly gone,
she was devastated.
The girl was now left under the care
of the beautiful queen.
Ten years passed, and Snow White
grew older and blossomed.
But the kingdom fell into an icy despair
as the queen realized,
if she wanted to remain
the most beautiful woman in all the land,
well, Snow would have to do
what snow does best.
Snow would have to fall.
Well, hello there.
Would you like a treat?
Here you go.
Oh, I think the party's started.
F to D-9.
To your left, Lord Waverly.
If someone would please teach Lord Waverly his left from his right,
I would be so very grateful.
Excuse me.
B to J-12.
My lady, I feel it is my duty to tell you of the rumors
- that I've been hearing.
- Rumors?
Well, there have been rumblings that the kingdom is close to destitute.
If we were to join our two houses in marriage...
- (SCOFFS)
...I feel the gentry would be reassured that the kingdom was stable once again.
Brighton, a word, please.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Loose lips sink ships.
Yes, indeed,
Your Majesty, exactly.
Which ship would you like sunk?
It's an expression, Brighton.
A royal decree. Take it down.
- Ah, marvelous.
- Any busybodies...
...caught rumoring, gossiping, whispering, or even thinking shall be put to death.
- How does that sound?
- It's decisive.
Snow White.
Is there a fire?
I'm sorry?
Is your bedroom on fire?
Because I'm searching for an explanation as to why you would be out of your bedroom and in here, and my first guess was fire.
I thought maybe I could come to the gala, you know, because today is my 18th birthday.
Is it, now? Oh, my, oh, my.
E to F-3, please.
Snow White, maybe it is time I ease up on you. Hmm?
After all, you've done nothing to me, caused no problems.
And yet...
...there is something about you that's just so incredibly...
...irritating.
I don't know what it is.
The slumped shoulders.
The hair, that voice... Mm!
I know what it is.
- I think it is the hair.
- (GASPS)
I hate your hair.
I don't care if it's your 100th birthday.
Don't ever sneak into a party like this again.
B to F-6.
C to D-4.
Baron, you've been beaten for the last five minutes and didn't even know it.
Bravo, Your Majesty.
It's important to know when you've been beaten. Yes.
MAN: I certainly don't like the look of these woods, sire.
If you don't mind me saying, they seem very sinister.
They're trees, Renbock.
Trees are just wood.
It's not the trees
I'm afraid of, sire.
There are stories of a man-eating beast inabiting these parts.
It thrills my heart to no end thinking that my traveling companion still believes in fairy tales.
If you don't mind me asking, when does
Your Highness think we're going home?
We've been on the road for months.
I just thought perhaps we could take a break.
We didn't set out seeking a vacation.
We set out seeking an adventure.
- Adventure, yes.
- And we're going to find one.
- (DRY CHUCKLE)
- (RUSTLING)
I really don't think this is a good idea, sire. We should ride on.
Not until we find out what's in these woods.
- (HORSE NEIGHS)
- Go around. Go around.
- Giants! Renbock! Renbock!
- Giants!
- After him!
- (HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)
- You there! Empty your pockets!
- What?
He said empty your pockets!
Yah!
Ha-ha!
- (WHINNYING)
- (GRUNTING)
- Give me that!
- Sit down!
- (GRUNTS)
- Stay down!
I found some roadkill!
- Do you concede?
- Yeah, do ya?
- (ALL GROWLING)
- Sire.
MAN: What's so funny?
You're not a giant!
None of you are giants.
Your point is?
You can't expect me to fight you.
Ah! Then he concedes!
- MAN: Yeah!
- Of course he concedes.
I most certainly do not.
I'm simply stating that I will not fight a bunch of dwarfs!
- Why?
- You're miniscule!
- Miniscule?
- Diminutive?
- Runts?
- Thank you. Runts?
- Runts? That's the best you got?
- So uninspired.
- The village idiot used to call us that.
- (ALL MUTTERING)
Take you the whole day to come up with that?
It doesn't matter!
You're short, and it's funny.
Funny? Not as funny as my blade against your throat.
Ease back.
All we want is his gold.
- I've got his saddlebag.
- Now we're talking!
Let's look in there.
Come on, get it open.
- That is not your property!
- Eh, whatever.
- Get your hands off of that immediately!
- Give them what they want, sire.
Nonsense. Apparently somebody has to teach a lesson to these children!
No one is to know the details, Renbock.
Understood?
- Say it!
- (GRUNTS)
No one needs to know the details,
Your Royal Highness.
ALL: Happy birthday, Snow!
- You remembered.
- Of course we remembered.
A girl's 18th birthday is the most important birthday of them all.
Do you want to know what I wish for your birthday, Snow White?
You can't make a wish for me.
Do you know why I continue to work for that wretched queen year after year?
I do it because I know that one day you are going to take back your kingdom, and I want to be here when that happens.
- It is not my kingdom.
- Oh, but it is.
Your father meant for you to inerit his crown.
And that woman has the entire kingdom convinced that you're a pathetic shut-in, incapable of leaving the castle.
And the worst is, she has you thinking it.
Your father's dagger.
I had it cleaned up and polished.
What would I do with this?
Perhaps you need to see for yourself what goes on in your kingdom.
WOMAN: The people don't
sing and dance anymore.
They need to see who you really are.
And you need to believe.
- I'm going out.
- Is she allowed to go out?
I don't know. Is she?
- OK...
- She's going out!
I won't say anything if you don't.
- Pinky swear?
- Pinky swear.
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.
Can you believe that baron?
I mean, honestly, did he really think
I would consider marrying him?
A woman has standards, after all, and an exalted woman like myself has very high standards.
- Interesting.
- What is?
Your response to his proposal.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Consider the options.
Well, this option has a receding hairline, smells like rotten eggs, and I wouldn't be caught dead with him.
You've spent so much supporting your vanity, you can't afford to say no.
Then why don't you snap your fingers and make me a chest of gold, hm?
Everyone has magic within them, but very few discover it and learn to spend it wisely.
Trust me. I am, after all, merely a reflection of you.
Well, not an exact reflection.
(WHISPERS) I have no wrinkles.
They're not wrinkles, just crinkles.
As you wish.
What do you suggest I do?
I suggest you marry someone rich. Quickly.
Because one day soon, you will ask me who the fairest of them all is,
- and you won't like the answer.
- (HUFFS)
RENBOCK: Hello?
Is anybody out there?
MAN: Shut up, Renbock.
Nobody can hear you in the woods.
- RENBOCK: On the off chance...
- MAN: That there's somebody else
- in these miserable woods?
- RENBOCK: Well, there could be.
- Is that tone?
- RENBOCK: No, it's not tone.
- I was repeating...
- MAN: You did it in a very smart way.
I did not! I don't like being this close to you. I've told you before.
I was warned what I might find in these woods, but...
MAN: I picked the worst traveling companion.
...I never imagined this!
- (LAUGHS)
- Who laughs at us?
We are in dire need of your help, ma'am.
- We were ambushed by seven dwarfs...
- Bloodthirsty giants.
- Giants?
- We were outnumbered, we fought bravely, but they cheated.
Young lady, if you would be so kind as to help myself and the honorable Prince...
- (GRUNTING, COUGHING)
- Prince of Embarrassment.
Fool! I'm but a humble commoner.
- Now, we order you to release us.
- Order me?
If you refuse, you shall suffer dire consequences.
Only if you say please.
Given the circumstances, sir,
I think a please is in order.
You're right.
Where are my manners?
- Please.
- That's all you had to say.
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much!
No, no, no! Wait! No!
- (GRUNTING)
- Oh!
- Are you all right? Can I help at all?
- (BOTH GRUNTING)
- Oh, yes, please.
- Yes. That's it.
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, oh! Oh.
Um... Do you want some help with the rope?
Yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry you had to see us in such a compromising position.
We're going north.
Oh, I'm... I'm traveling south.
- It's a shame.
- Yes, it is.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (GIGGLES)
Uh...
Then I guess we must bid you adieu.
Hm.
She turned around. Did you see that?
No. I don't think she's interested, sir.
- BRIGHTON: Your Highness?
- Yes.
Pardon, Your Majesty, but... you have a visitor.
I'm not in the mood, Brighton.
He's young, handsome...
...and semi-nude.
Your Highness, may I present to you the esteemed
Prince Alcott of Valencia.
Your Majesty.
Please pardon our dress.
I'm afraid my valet and I were robbed by bandits as we entered your kingdom.
Bandits? How awful.
How absolutely terrifying and smooth and hairy.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Nothing.
Could I trouble you for a covering?
Perhaps a shirt?
If you must.
Um...
- Um...
- (WHISPERS) Brighton.
- Brighton.
- Your Majesty.
The prince is bashful and requires, sadly, a covering.
- BRIGHTON: Of course, milady.
- I'm not bashful.
Sir, is there any particular style of shirt you'd like?
Brighton.
A simple covering.
A simple covering it is.
Valencia, you say.
I've never heard of it.
Is it a wee hamlet?
No, quite the contrary.
It's a bountiful province.
We have many natural resources.
Gold, silver, bustling silk trade.
You don't say.
Send out the invites.
Alert the caterer.
I want you to organize a ball like this kingdom has never seen before.
We are gonna sweep this kid right off his feet.
Uh... Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I don't understand.
Brighton, the prince is rich.
He's built like an ox.
I'm going to marry him, and then my financial problems will be... solved.
No, I understand that part.
What I don't understand is how you intend to pay for the party.
It pains me to say this, but you're broke, my Queen.
Then go collect more taxes.
Your Majesty, I don't know the last time you were in the town, but the people are starving.
Do you have no imagination?
Go tell the villagers that bread is meat, less is more, blah, blah, blah.
Commoners love a good metaphor.
Just go sell it.
"Bread is meat."
- (WHISPERS) OK, go.
- Excuse me.
Do you have anything to eat?
What happened here?
I visited once with my father.
It was a wonderful place.
People always seemed to be singing and dancing.
That must have been many years ago.
- BRIGHTON: Yah! Yah!
- (HORSE NEIGHS)
Whoa!
- More taxes?
- Good, you can read.
Make sure they are collected in a timely fashion.
What's she doing with all our money?
- Protecting you.
- From what?
Must I remind you of the brutal attacks we have suffered?
- He speaks of...
- The beast!
Yes. Evil lurks in the dark woods, more hideous than you could ever imagine.
The only reason it hasn't gorged itself on all of you...
...is because your tax dollars are hard at work.
I'll be back tomorrow for the money.
You will return as quickly as possible and you will bring with you a platoon of castle guards.
Just look how she's dressed me, sire.
Like a pink profiterole.
That reminds me. We need clothes.
And gold. An army.
Clothes? Why? Do you not like the queers taste in mers fashion?
Have you been listening to anything I've said?
Yes. Soldiers, gold, clothes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Good.
- Only if you say please.
Please, Renbock.
Sire, I implore you to come back with me now. This queen radiates crazy.
You know these women always get crazy when there's a prince around.
No. There's
"I'm in the same room as a prince" crazy, and then there's just good old-fashioned, plain, traditional psycho crazy.
I fear she's the latter.
Safe travels, Renbock. And when you return, I pray you're wearing your pants.
Well, I will pray the same for you, sire. I bid you adieu.
SNOW WHITE: Baker Margaret!
Baker Margaret!
Margaret, it's worse than you could ever imagine!
- You saw the town?
- Yes. It's awful.
The queen has destroyed everything my father believed in.
Oh... (WHISPERS) Go on.
She's taxing them more as we speak, even though they have nothing.
That's to pay for all her lavish parties.
She's throwing another one tonight.
For a prince.
- A prince is here?
- And, Snow, it's said he has an army.
Well, maybe he could help us.
If he truly has an army, maybe he could help us take back the kingdom.
My goodness.
Someone's had quite a day.
You're gonna have an even bigger night.
You're gonna crash that ball.
BRIGHTON: You look fabulous,
Your Majesty.
"Fabulous"? Brighton,
I haven't even begun to get ready yet.
Well, then, one can only imagine how fabulous...
- Shut up, Brighton.
- With pleasure.
The treatment is ready.
Treatment?
Isn't that a trifle excessive?
There's no such thing.
- (BIRD SQUAWKING)
- (FLATULENT SOUNDS)
Try not to enjoy this, baker lady.
I'll do my best.
(WHISPERS) Tightening, brightening.
Tightening and brightening.
Ahh.
- Happy place, happy place.
- (BUZZING)
Oh, that's always the worst part.
Hm.
I can feel you smiling.
MAN: Her Majesty the Queen!
His Royal Highness,
- the Prince of Valencia!
- (SCATTERED GASPS)
In folklore, the rabbit is known to use cunning and trickery to outwit his enemies.
Or perhaps you prefer your guests feel out of control and slightly uncomfortable.
Handsome and smart.
How confusing.
- Hey, kid. Scram.
- (WALTZ PLAYING)
- You.
- You!
- You're here.
- (STAMMERING) I am. I'm here.
But... you're the prince?
I'm sorry. Seeing you in this dress has caused me to lose my words.
Well, at least it doesn't cause you to lose your pants.
(SIGHS) I mean, when I met you first, you werert wearing pants.
Yes.
Well, at least now you're dressed... up...
...like a bunny.
- MAN: Sorry.
Apparently it's a rabbit.
Something about trickery and enemies and cunning.
Oh, OK.
- I look like an idiot.
- Yes, a little bit.
- So, what are you...
- Doing in the palace? Um...
I live here.
I have for a while, actually.
- I'm kind of the princess.
- What? You didn't tell me that.
- You never told me you're a prince.
- (MAN GASPING)
I feared I looked ridiculous.
- Said the prince in the bunny hat.
- (GIGGLES)
- Arert we supposed to be changing?
- Yes, I believe so.
- Oh! Sorry!
- (EXCLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no, it's OK.
- Forgive me.
- No, forgive me.
The truth is, I didn't just come here to dance tonight.
- I need your help.
- Anything. I'm at your disposal.
SNOW WHITE: It's the queen.
Ever since my father died, she's terrorized the people and ruined the land.
And I would hope that a good-hearted prince like yourself would...
I have to go.
- Brighton.
- Right away.
MAN: Sir...
- (MUSIC STOPS)
- (APPLAUSE)
You sneaky little tart.
What were you doing, talking to my prince?
- Your prince?
- And where did you get such a dress?
Do you want to talk about my dress or what you did to the village?
Good for you, Snow White!
Someone's been taking their confidence pills, hmm?
Do it again.
Say it again. Come on.
Oh, you're no fun!
Brighton, you do it.
Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Not irritating enough.
Come on. Say it again.
Be more irritating, more infuriating. Hmm?
(HIGH VOICE) Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Actually, you're both irritating.
I've been there.
I've seen what you did to the people.
You left the castle grounds?
Wow. Snow White breaking all the rules today, hmm?
- That's a punishable offense, you know.
- By whose law?
You have no right to rule the way you do.
- Hm.
- And technically,
I'm the rightful leader of this kingdom.
Mmm.
Probably not the best thing you could have said just there.
I want her killed.
Killed? Your Majesty, isn't that a bit rash?
She is a threat to everything.
Take her to the woods and feed her to the beast.
Is this about the dress?
- BRIGHTON: Keep moving.
- SNOW WHITE: Just let me go.
I swear you'll never see me again.
You think I want to be here?
You brought this on yourself.
You never should have upstaged the queen, and now we're both paying the price.
Stop.
- Brighton, please.
- Turn around.
- (RUSTLING)
- (GASPS)
Please. Brighton, I'm afraid.
I don't want to die like my father did.
Your father was a good man.
He was always very kind to me.
In return, I shall give you one small piece of advice.
Run. Run as fast as you can and as far away from here as possible.
- Just run.
- (BRANCHES CRACKLING)
Like this. Run!
- Brighton!
- Run!
(MUTTERS) What am I going to do?
I've got to figure some way out.
- She'll never believe me.
- QUEEN: Brighton.
- Brighton!
- Coming! Coming.
- Your Majesty?
- Is it done?
Oh! Just as you instructed.
That's her liver, her kidneys, her spleen...
- That's disgusting.
...and a few other assorted parts.
I'll admit... I'm impressed.
You're not as pathetic and wimpy as I have always believed.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Wow, I feel amazing!
Positively lightheaded.
I'm just glad to see you in such a good mood.
Yes! We must release the news of the tragedy, right?
The usual stuff. You know,
"struck down in her youth," "terrible loss."
We'll fly the flags at half-mast.
Flags throughout the kingdom, or just within the palace grounds?
That's too much trouble.
Forget the flags.
Her parts! Your dagger.
- Night-night.
- Night-night.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
Glory!
She's awake.
Who are you?
We ask the questions here.
Who are you?
My name is Snow White.
ALL: Snow White?
- That's not possible.
- Snow White's a defective troll.
Yeah. They keep her locked up in the tower.
Maybe this is a different Snow White.
- Huh?
- It's not such an uncommon name.
If you're Snow White, then...
...who's your father?
- The king.
- She is Snow White, see?
- Eh.
I say never trust anyone over four feet.
Yeah. Let's drag her back out to the woods and pretend like we didn't see nothing!
No, you fools! She's a princess.
- That means she's valuable.
- We should hold her for ransom.
- She's won'th gold.
- Maybe we should get to know her first.
You won't get any gold for me.
They want me dead.
The queen sent me out here to be killed by the beast.
Why would the queen want you dead?
Because she's wicked.
- She's evil.
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)
- She's a witch.
- Do you remember that time?
Sorry, but we have an appointment to keep.
So it's time for girlie to shuffle along.
Oh, wait! You can't just kick me out.
I have nowhere else to go.
Look. If the queen finds you here, she'll kill us, too.
Mm-hmm.
All I'm asking is to spend one night. Please.
Huddle!
All right, you guys, let me hear it.
All those in favor of letting the girl stay, say "aye."
Aye.
- Opposed?
- Nay.
Tough luck, Your Highness.
Sorry, Snow White.
All votes need to be unanimous.
- One night.
- Thank you.
Come on, guys. Duty calls.
Wait! I don't even know your names.
I'm Butcher.
Will Grimm.
Half Pint.
Napoleon.
Grub.
Chuck.
But you can call him Chuckles.
Stay focused, and no more arguing.
Maybe I should stay back with her.
I think she might be uncomfortable.
- No.
- And I'm Wolf.
Boys...
...I like her.
- Yeah, me, too.
She'll bring a feminine touch.
If you ask me, she's just gonna bring the queers guards.
- You think she has a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Me.
Snow White is dead.
One of God's great mysteries is His plan for each and every one of us.
(MUTTERS) Speed it up.
Snow White lived, she died,
God rest her soul. Amen.
There will be a buffet lunch served at 2:00.
Magistrate, I've come for the taxes.
The people cannot bear this much longer.
Are you seriously going to argue about money on this day of grieving?
That's odd.
What do we have here?
Looks like a royal to me.
Are you a royal?
No, no. Not a royal, just a humble servant.
You're riding in the queers sled.
No. This is a rental.
Well, you're wearing royal garments.
These tired old rags?
You boys have got to get out of the woods more often.
What's in that pretty sack?
My lunch.
Good, I'm famished.
What are we eating?
Boys! The mother Iode!
Give me that!
That money belongs to the queen!
Don't spend it all in one place.
Nothing like an honest day's work.
Beats working down a mine.
Welcome home.
Lamb. Carrots. Gravy.
- I say she's a keeper.
- Sure she is.
Oh, man!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Why do you have palace guard uniforms?
- We got them at work.
- What kind of job do you have?
We're... renegades.
- Rebels.
- Thieves!
That's true.
We stole the queers gold!
You broke into the palace?
No, we nabbed it outside the village.
So you actually stole the people's gold.
- Not exactly.
- Yes, exactly!
That's the people's money!
Why, that's terrible. They need it.
- You must return it.
- We worked hard for that money.
Stealing isn't work.
- Sure it's work!
- It's hard!
I tore my shirt, had to sew it.
That's work.
I'm sorry you got a few scrapes, but the townspeople need that money.
They hate us.
- Well, that can't be true.
- It is. They despise us.
Years ago, when the queen expelled all the "undesirables"...
...no one stood up for us.
She said...
"Banish all the Uglies."
You've been mistreated by the queen.
No one understands that better than me.
It's unfair, but so is stealing from innocent families.
We werert always thieves.
- We were legitimate.
- With real trades.
- I was a teacher.
- I was a butcher.
And I ran the pub.
A good, honest job.
- Honest?
- It was almost honest.
- I stole a little.
- A little?
- It's a cash business!
- That's your excuse?
Hey, everybody does it, all right?
- I didn't.
- Neither did I.
Uh, you put your thumb on the scale!
- I did not!
- Did too! And you cheat at poker!
- I win at poker.
- You cheat at poker?
- (YELLS)
- (CHATTER STOPS)
Where's the gold?
- Whoa!
- Move it!
- Come on, let's get the stilts.
- Forget the stilts! Come on!
Good thing she's in that dress, otherwise we'd never catch her!
My friends, our money has been returned!
It was brought back to us by...
Come up here, young lady, and tell us your name.
- I'm...
- BUTCHER: That belongs to us!
Hold on a second!
- Those men there!
- Move!
SNOW WHITE: Those men...
They're the ones that brought back the gold.
The queen told you that they were undesirables, but she lied.
Huh?
These brave men are the true heroes.
They fearlessly raided the queers caravan and...
...and retrieved your gold.
They're the ones that really deserve your thanks.
- Yay!
- (APPLAUSE)
Yay!
- Yeah!
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
Are you enjoying the quail?
Mm. It looks delicious,
Your Highness. Thank you.
I could barely hear you all the way down there. (CHUCKLES)
You know, everyone has remarked what a wonderful dancer you were last night.
Thank you, Your Highness.
I do have one question about the evening.
There was a girl there.
She had black hair and was very beautiful.
Beautiful?
Yes, I'd say she was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Ever is a very long time.
No, no, no, I know this in my heart.
I think she's the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Agree to disagree.
Let's leave it at that.
But do you know her?
Ivory skin, black hair...
Her hair is not black, it's raven, and she's 18 years old, and her skin has never seen the sun, so of course it's good.
Meaning to say, the girl you refer to is called Snow White.
Snow White.
I admit, she's very suited to the name.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
Most unfortunate case, really.
The child...
(WHISPERING)... wasrt all there.
I'm sorry, Highness, you're speaking about her in past tense?
Oh, I am.
How indelicate of me. She's dead.
- Dead?
- Mm.
- How?
- Last night, in the woods.
Oh. Treacherous place, the woods.
- This is terrible.
- Do you need a second?
Yes, thank you,
I just need to process.
Prince Alcott,
I have a proposition for you.
We're both single adults, roughly the same age.
- I don't think we're the same...
- I said roughly.
The point is, the clock is ticking for both of us.
We are people of means.
Would you do me the honor and be my...
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- A moment, please!
What?
Pardon my appearance, Your Majesty, but there's been a development.
- The royal taxes have been stolen.
- Stolen? By whom?
- Bandits.
- Bandits.
Uh-huh, bandits.
- Very intimidating.
- I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore.
Enough of these cowardly muggers!
Justice must prevail.
Wait. Wait!
Well, thank you, Brighton.
(WHISPERS) This close!
- (WHISTLES) Huddle!
- The deal's off. She stole our money.
ALL: You can stay.
- (SIGHS)
- But we've got conditions.
If you're going to live with us, you have to be one of us.
I have to be a dwarf?
No. You have to be a thief.
I feel I've been clear about my thoughts on stealing.
What if you were stealing from the queen?
You said yourself she's wicked.
- Somebody has to stop her.
- Why not you?
Why not us?
I mean us.
But this time I have conditions.
Whatever we steal goes back to the people.
- Minus a small commission.
- Butcher!
Fine. But she doesn't know the first thing about thieving!
Then we'll teach her.
We'll teach her to believe.
People think you can't be tall if you're short.
That you can't be strong if you're not.
A weakness is only a weakness
if you think of it that way.
Never, under any circumstances, give up the high ground.
That one?
Before you even draw your sword, you must make an impression on your enemy.
If he is deceived by the way you look,
- the battle's half won.
- (GRUNTING)
People think of you as sweet.
They don't expect you to fight dirty.
- Use that to your advantage.
- Whoo! Yes!
Concentrate.
GRIMM: Your weapon
isn't your only friend.
Sorry.
The environment can be an ally, too.
Deception on the battlefield
isn't just an option.
You're so cute when you're mad.
Oftentimes it's the difference between victory and defeat.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Ow!
- (YELLING)
- (GRUNTS)
SNOW WHITE: I'm sorry.
But you deserved it.
This is where we were ambushed last time.
Keep your eyes open.
Oh! Oh, dear! (GASPING)
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
I'll be out of your way in a moment.
Oh, dear!
Ma'am, may I offer you any assistance?
Oh, no! Sorry, sir!
Everything's all right. I'll just be...
- It's you.
- It's you.
- I thought you were dead.
- I almost was.
- Give us your valuables!
- Stay behind me. You'll be safe.
It was so hot there.
What I want?
Better to choose something.
Look who showed up.
"Whenever I see it.
-Pancakes.
The telepath
I think I'll eat pancakes.
-Look at that smile.
"I knew we should be happy.
Do not you?
You said you would on Thursday.
Yes, she's beautiful.
-The flight was canceled.
"What can he want?
"And the family? Never talk about it.
-I will never know.
It's convenient.
And we talked, talk a lot.
Whew.
I need to work.
"We have a strange connection.
-I could never write.
I must take the editor.
Trust you?
I should trust you?
Trust we conquer, my friend.
Come back here soon. If you delay,
I may have gone.
Hi ..
My name is Joshua.
I'm Vanessa.
Vanessa.
You are the sign of Virgo.
I am not a Virgin obvious.
It was obvious to me.
You are very intuitive.
One can say that.
Vanessa... you do not call
Vanessa, is not it?
Emily.
Emily.
Something tells me you enjoying every day life... like me. You know what I
I mean by that?
Maybe.
But as I know you is not...
Crazy?
I am also a Virgo.
That 'is not typical of our sign.
Let your apartment.
Okay.
Gotta go.
I'm busy now.
That can wait.
I have to go.
Now?
Sorry.
Bobby? It's Sandy.
Concentrate on my voice.
Do not listen to anyone else.
They do not exist.
Why do you not tried to help him?
Bobby... me.
Where are you?
Bobby open.
Dammit... open soon.
Okay, I'm coming.
PUNTA DEL LESTE, URUGUAl
ONE YEAR DEPOlS
Here's the flop.
Not bad.
Chance of straight.
He will think I have a pair.
Increase.
I do not know why Anna came today she hates gambling.
Keep thinking.
Two thousand.
His two thousand and five.
What a beautiful drug.
Paid.

His five and my five.
His five... and two thousand.
Paid.
Looks like you won.
Congratulations.
It was pure luck.
Again and again.
Soon, I'll have to...
Excuse me...
I'll be back here in a second.
If you're drunk again,
Lazarus, I swear...
You told me I was the only agent in this mission.
You're the one, you already know.
But what is happening?
It's the Widmann Syndrome?
It's not Widmann.
Someone came over me.
Do you have any idea who it was?
No, no.
So, excuse and get gone.
Let's make a review tonight.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I need to close the evening.
My apologies.
You're right, Josh?
You do not look any better.
I'm fine, Rolf. I'm a little hypoglycemic, that's it.
Good evening.
Good evening.
I should have come alone.
If he looks for one more second,
I'll hit him.
I'll charge you double.
I think he can afford.
Sandy!
Happy birthday, Joshua.
Thank you, please.
Forgive me for not celebrating.
Hello
Please?
Sounds like a great girl.
She's good.
You have taken your medication?
When I remember.
These remedies are the only way delay the onset of Widmann.
So instead of going crazy fast
I slowly go insane.
At least, these drugs help.
They are not like those.
Do not get me wrong, Sandy... but you have no idea than I spend.
No one who is normal have no idea. Not even you.
Even with the drugs, how many attackers arrived in 29 years... with sanity intact?
-No.
"And how many candles... there on my cake birthday today?
Twenty-eight. But the drugs are better every year, maybe you...
When you have gone to so many heads as I ever was, Sandy... you will stop believing in miracles.
I'm lucky having come this far.
Bobby was only 26.
Do not lose hope.
The research we are doing
House is making great strides.
Maybe.
Anyway, if I freak out a month before or a month later... does not make much difference.
It was good to see you, Sandy... but you did not come to Uruguay just to know about my meds... and if I've been drinking.
Again.
You know how they are paranoid.
They care a lot about you... even I had given my word none of you... would never invade any of them.
But they are terrified attacker with this new idea loose.
I should help him find who is this new invader.
And there... one more reason something personal.
The decision.
You must make the decision now while still lucid.
I need to go.
Diaz invited me.
For some reason, the poor devil wants to be my friend.
You know, he is the Minister of Finance
Argentina's... and they want me to take him into bankruptcy, because it does not come into play.
Not like this.
What horror.
I should not have agreed to hire one of you.
And they always ask or you Kira.
They are the only intruders considered sensible.
Anyway, sorry for doing it accept these government jobs.
But the House needs the money.
No need to justify for me, Sandy.
You saved my life.
Joshua, welcome.
Glad you came.
I guess you never knew
My daughter Anna the other night.
Anna, this is Joshua Lazarus.
He was taking a truck money from me... but kept the class unhappy with that opinion.
Very pleased.
It's your hypoglycemia again?
"It must be.
Sorry, Rolf, could you get me a glass of water and something sweet?
Of course.
Meanwhile, you may know each other better.
So it was you.
"What's happening?
It's okay...
I'm like you.
Not possible.
He thought he was the one?
I'm not liking it.
Get out.
Okay, do not worry.
Do not tell my father.
Get out.
And then you have something in common?
Excuse me, Rolf, I am not feeling any better. Gotta go.
-Nice to meet you, Anna.
-My pleasure.
We searched everyone in the room and the two adjacent.
"There's nothing yet.
"And the Canadians?
They say they know nothing.
It is clear that our questions were very vague.
You will have instructions in an hour.
I started hearing voices again.
You can control them?
For now, yes.
How long do I have?
Since the emergence of voices... sanity is gone in a month.
I'm sorry.
No regrets.
I had enough time.
Thank you for being... honest with me, Sandy.
Here, they are stronger... should help a little.
Be sure to take them regularly.
You need me in the house, Josh.
So... you must decide now.
Do not make the same mistake as Bobby.
Decide for me.
I'm serious.
Bobby you visited lately?
No. ..
I can not.
The NSA insists keep it tied at... even under sedation.
Yes
Do nothing sentimental... with the ashes.
Promise?
When you feel the voices are too... back to the House.
Hi.
"Hello.
You'll be out there?
We do not believe in staying in people's minds... if they do not want us there.
Unless they are normal.
Who is''we''?
There are others like us.
Not many.
You know, when I said''Exit'' not meant to go.
I meant to leave.
I was not prepared for that.
Now, are you?
You are better this time?
Best.
You are almost fuzzy, you know?
I thought I should be so, but you're not.
Can I fix it for you.
"Okay, that does not bother me.
Do not worry, it's an easy technique.
Okay.
Right. Look at your feet.
Now, focus on them. See them well.
Put light on them.
Now go up through your body and keep the focus.
Now is better.
If we open ourselves to each other, things will get easier.
What is this?
It's something we do very much.
Knock down our walls and we merge in our heads.
We learned everything about each other.
Everything?
It may be that we do not like long after that... but at least we'll understand.
I have to go, are waiting for me.
What you got?
Well, a little vodka for me... and for you, a laxative.
Cherry flavor.
What got to know the girl?
Not much.
So is not it?
"I doubt it.
"You doubt. Very helpful.
If you do not like the way
I work, call another.
Very nice this place.
It is very organized.
You talking to me?
I do not remember inviting him.
I was talking to the waiter.
He is also a telepath.
Very funny.
Anyway, I did it for you.
You seem to be someone who likes order.
I've...
I prefer Kandinsky to Mondrian.
We need order.
That's how Sandy teaches us dealing with chaos.
Who is Sandy?
-Sandy taught me everything.
Who trained them?
How so?
Who taught her to use your skills?
Nobody.
Not possible. You can not fighting with the voices alone.
You need not fight.
It took me years to learn this.
I do not understand.
We need to understand better.
Let us open.
I do not know, no.
Will help.
And if there's something you do not want me to know...
-Just put an obstacle.
-An obstacle?
Say you do not want
I know that chair.
Put a wall around her... or a door... or Stonehenge.
But... if I push...
I can see the chair.
That 'depends on the strength the obstacle.
Anyway, do not push anything.
If you push,
I'll be very angry.
Do not worry.
In a few seconds you understand everything.
My God.
Finally, you came back.
Kira?
I can only see a certain
Uruguayan number of novels.
What are you doing here?
They said you were problems... they wanted someone a little older and much wiser.
I was worried if you had outbursts, or I would have refused.
I was at a retreat lighting.
"But it seems you have no freaking out.
Not yet.
Great.
In fact, you lost my birthday.
My condolences delayed.
We both arrived at 28.
How likely is that?
God must have a plan for us.
How are you?
Still drinks, I see.
I imagine you still trance with any being that moves.
Sorry, not fair.
Any move to be beautiful.
I turn right.
Well? We are not satisfied with''good''.
Have you ever... entered into some head... and found something strange?
Every time.
I feel disgust and discomfort.
Sometimes even ties.
-Even more strange?
Strange how-... you do not want it to end.
Is that sick.
There was something powerful.
And scary.
For both, I think.
It was almost as if we were the same person.
Different but equal.
You know what I'm talking about?
Are you all right?
Am.
You can not enjoy someone to whom he opened... because you know too well.
The best thing you can do is tolerate each other, as I tolerate.
Okay... forget.
It is the unknown attacker?
Her name is Anna.
She is the daughter of Diaz.
You told them that was not her.
So let's get this straight.
You said that you share each of their pathetic little secret... was nice?
Well, I blocked a lot, but not that.
We are very... compatible.
Okay.
I see that there is only one way to prove to you.
No, I can not.
All these idiosyncrasies,
I know that must have worsened.
It is not easy for me too.
You have that nasty fetish student in uniform...
-I would never, never...
"I know. Now, c'mon.
Let's get this over with.
I need you to understand.
I can not... okay?
I'm afraid to infect it.
You know, I heard voices, too.
It's alright.
Not me.
I'm so ahead, Josh.
Right.
Come take a walk.
Let's talk.
Who is it?
I still do not know.
It's a lie.
His poker face is terrible, Lazarus.
You're lucky you can cheat.
You got a lot of time the men's room.
Is there anything I need to know?
First, you will not go back there, is very risky.
Second, you will not contact anyone who was in that room... today or any other day.
I can block them.
I am the only that is not at risk.
Thanks for your opinion, Lazarus.
No contacts. Zero.
And Diaz?
Someone else will deal with Diaz.
The attacker is your priority.
We need to talk.
I know.
Sorry if I ran away last time, but I was exhausted.
These unions always like this?
They are not.
Never.
Because it was really...
Scary?
Wonderful.
And scary.
Yes
It was the most amazing thing
I've ever felt.
I know.
I know you know.
Is not it strange?
I know.
I know you know.
We will open again.
I choke less stuff.
Okay.
You are still blocking much.
I think a little
Privacy is good.
Of course, but I want know her as much as possible.
You know me very well.
And I know what you feeling for me.
That 'not something that should happen to us.
Well, you thought it.
And me too.
Have you ever thought it would be like... old?
No.
Just as I never thought it would be like turn a frog. Not gonna happen.
You're lying.
Of course it does.
Wow!
What?
Nothing.
Sit at a table close.
Anything else
I can do for you?
To be frank, yes.
Take in the towel naturally.
AGAIN
WE SOBREVlVEMOS
It's my favorite movie.
I know.
I know you know.
And the guy on the right looks a lot like...
His aunt Louise.
Yeah, yeah.
"She can not be so ugly.
You are very kind, but it is so.
Thanks.
It's great.
I wanted to ask you, how you can be so unfair to my father?
It has to do with you.
I'm just doing bets of my country.
The NSA loves us, we are as wireless eavesdropping.
There are no guarantees.
Give an honest answer, Josh.
Sandy teaches us that these works are for the general good.
He uses the payments of the NSA to help other invaders.
I do not like the term''invaders.''
It's an ugly word... and you use it to justify things horrible they are asked to do.
You would like to be cheating with his father?
I do not see my father for 20 years, then...
Listen, we have rules we follow.
No.
You leave to do so because no empathy with anyone.
They taught to keep others out... but if you leave all come, you'd be happier.
No thanks.
All selfishness, hatred of the millions and petty prejudices.
It's too much.
But there is another side.
There's the rose that blooms in the heart of the beloved.
You just need let yourself see it.
See the other side.
MULTI-YEAR TOGETHER
Anna, I must tell you more on the syndrome Widmann.
You have a chance.
You only have 26 years... maybe they can find... healing time for you.
Actually, I'm not 26.
Sorry... but I induce to think that I'm 26.
Do not mind a marriage.
Well ..
I lied.
But then, how old are you?
I just turned 31.
Not possible.
I gotta go.
Beware, it can kill you.
Peyote?
It's for my retreat.
Did not know you could do his retreat here.
Well, do not have much time to find the light... then, can not be very rigid.
Each has their own way to overcome.
Some seek a sense... instead of wasting the little time that we...
-If you do not want to be here...
"We can not hide it forever.
Bridger is not stupid.
We can talk in here, please?
She is 31.
Thirty-one years?
It is impossible.
She said yes.
And she's fine.
You trust him?
As much as I trust you.
Do you mind if changing the setting?
His strange fixation
Rhett Butler to distract me.
Change you.
Okay.
Very funny.
Now, it's better.
Have you ever tasted Fri on the Beach?
You know who you're talking about?
The drink.
No.
How did this?
Cool, huh?
It's a new trick I learned.
We can send small memories to other invaders.
Perhaps there is a positive side in this crazy business.
Kira?
I'm fine.
And stop thinking about it.
It's just the peyote.
Okay.
Just drink.
And keep your thoughts to yourself.
I said okay.
So what do we do now?
I'll see some things.
Do not have much time.
"I know.
I know.
Hello.
Who understand the importance to us of his life.
He accompanied us for many years, from his childhood... demonstrating their interest and his struggle for life.
It was an example to us all.
Their way of life was an example to his family.
To your friends.
For the church.
Too many years listening his words.
Hard to believe...
Hi, Josh.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
His heart stopped.
It was a heart attack?
They do not know.
He was an example to society... and why we gather here his grave... and now I want... to pray for him an Our Father.
The door was open?
No.
A window, or something?
No. What you are trying to say?
I'm not saying anything.
Is that Kira is gone.
I think the syndrome
Widmann of took it.
Anyway, they do not trust more about me.
Want to send me back to New York.
The wonderful hours we spent together.
Always together.
So I'll go with you.
They will watch me.
I always watch.
"If they see us together...
What else can I do?
I'm in love with you.
I was so used to be alone.
I thought it had to be so.
We deserve a little happiness.
Do not have much time.
If we found a way to get together...
I mean... really together...
Yes?

Welcome home.
What happened?
She was found near here... babbling incomprehensible sounds... without any control.
Asked if she took the decision... and I told them yes.
I never spoke to her about it.
She told me he wanted espalh醩semos that his ashes.
That's what they did.
Come walk a little me, yes?
I'm sorry.
My time has come, Sandy?
I do not know.
Is near.
Is I...
I'm not ready.
So... take it.
Are the strongest that the NSA does.
Will help you for a while.
They also... destroy your liver in a month.
There is one more person
I want to see.
Bobby?
Do not even bother, which is locked.
No one can enter, me neither.
He will be here for life.
All alone.
And I can not do anything about it.
"Hello.
"Hello.
How was that?
A horror.
What would you do if you knew that we would have another 10 years...
20 years...
50 years?
Is that impossible.
Let's play.
What would you do?
I do not know.
You have a family?
I do not know.
Would you do something useful with your life, help anyone?
Maybe, I guess.
Still, you wasting our time... although it is more precious.
Well, it's a way to...
Did you hear that?
-No.
What is this?
They are entering.
Concentrate.
Focus on your voice... and expel them.
That's right.
They are many, many!
"I'll stop there.
-No.
I'll be fine.
Show me.
Hold on.
Joshua.
Focus on your voice.
Expel them.
It will not work this time.
Send them away.
Look behind you.
Gotta talk to you.
Who are you?
Only one voice.
No.
Right. Did you face to face and succeeded.
Shall I take off the mask?
Got it?
Exactly what you want from me?
You have to leave.
Soon. lr though.
How?
That's your problem.
Why?
Because you know something
I should not know.
I have to go.
I have to believe you?
I'm just telling you what you already know.
Think of me as the voice of conscience.
And you should take the girl.
She also knows.
What is the importance of this, if I'll be dead in two...
You have more time than you think.
Hello, abba.
It's me, abba.
I'm surprised that you remember.
I remember his face.
And from the mother.
She died five years after the take.
I know.
I'm only since almost 20 years.
God wants me to suffer much, before I go.
They said that would help him.
They helped.
They cured me.
Thank God.
Sorry I did not see it coming.
They said I could have a relapse if...
I know. When we signed the papers, said they would see him more.
But you were so sick.
I was mad.
Then you remember some Russian?
A little.
What else do you remember?
I remember... numbers.
I remember trying to erase them... but I could not.
Can we go talk elsewhere, abba?
Yes
My two nannies.
I need your help.
You have it.
I know you have people here, people who work... outlaw.
So you think your father is mafia, Joshua?
I think my father is my only chance.
Gotta get away. I have no passport, not trust anyone.
The government does not want you exit.
No.
And I do not know what will happen who help me.
You're not traveling alone...
I presume.
No.
FARM罜lA
It's a lovely girl.
So there it is.
Come on.
Come on.
So here we go.
Go.
"Want a ride?
"Why not?
You came over, no?
Yes It's not the guy nicest in the world.
No, but it is on our side.
Get out.
"Why?
-The plan is this.
Come on.
Okay, it's clean.
Change of clothes inside.
Stay here.
I invade.
There is a guy in there that will take us to the plane.
He is clean.
Okay.
Inside.
I'm Alex.
Welcome aboard.
You are stewards, going to Madrid to catch a flight there.
-Understand?
"Right.
Great.
It's all arranged, then, relax and enjoy the ride.
Do you understand what I understood?
Yes
There is nothing to do about it now.
See what else you can capture him.
I could not get more.
They will expect us in Madrid.
Yes
When will they act?
Do not charge me before Alex,
I'm sure.
This may be our single night together.
I know.
I know you know.
Let us unite together.
No blockages.
You know why people like us never trust anyone?
Because it is not necessary.
Knowing is not trusted.
Without marriage, then.
Is that weird, taking to guess what you want.
No wonder they are the normal so frightened about sex.
But there's something really exciting with divination, no?
Undoubtedly.
Wish we were closer.
I can not get anything now.
They are here,
I have no doubt.
You have something for me.
Now, you're on your own.
Good luck.
Wow, I can not stand it.
Stupid, they will be killed in five minutes.
I wanted him shut up.
Which pair of idiots!
But I would be with her.
"But she met the wrong guy...
-Shut up!
What happened now?
You hear me?
Not possible.
Alex, you hear me?
I think he can not hear you.
Maybe not, but I exercised an effect on him.
Let's see if this becomes reality.
Alex, walk to the door.
I think I'll leave the lovebirds alone.
Try something else.
Alex, tie your shoe.
Something stronger.
Alex, take a slap in your face.
It is a power of suggestion, but is limited.
You better not take it the bus together.
Do you expect the next one.
I know who they are.
Two are coming this way.
You need to be captured alive anyway.
I can be captured dead or alive.
We must leave here.
If we separate, you know where is the meeting point.
Empty.
Empty.
Empty.
"I need to check the Piper.
-Have you looked in there.
The plane is empty.
Go to the next.
Have you looked in there!
The plane is empty!
Tell the other agent the plane is empty.
"I've already checked that...
"He's here!
Where is the girl?
The girl? You...
She got on the plane you just take off.
We lost.
Do not even bother to rise, Lazarus.
Hello, Lazarus.
You are very conscious for my taste.
It's amazing how these drugs speaking readers mind... even when they are in semi.
When I get...
You are much more consistent when you are conscious.
Of course, you are also much less cooperative.
Go ahead.
Sweet dreams, Lazarus.
Welcome back
New York, Lazarus.
And thanks for sharing their plans with us.
I tip my hat. Never think look at you two here.
I want to see Sandy.
That 'is not subject to Sandy.
Okay, let's go.
Do not worry;
I doubt that we need you.
Give back to the other side.
We'll find him there.
Come on.
The satellite has already captured the, exactly where we expected.
She will notice when our presence get close, then run.
Everything seemed fine.
Come on.
Send him away first.
Apply it on you.
Apply it on you.
Do it now.
Bridger told you apply it in you.
Anna!
Anna!
Josh, we need to go.
We can not keep them out long.
-Kira.
That's me. Come!
"Where is she?
-I did not arrive on time. Sorry.
Where is she?
She's gone. They gathered back to the House.
Come on, I got a plan perfect for us. Come on.
You are trying to grasp it?
Yes, there's nothing there.
Just because you do not capture, not to say that there is nothing.
I broke the rules. lnvadi an NSA agent.
There's Syndrome Widmann.
What makes us sick?
Remedies.
Without them, our skills grow.
Anyway... they came to get me... and I ran.
I found a job here, as night security.
It is a safe place for me to hide.
I do not want you to know
I was alive... was safer for both of us that way.
I wish you and Anna escape.
Meanwhile, I think the NSA
Sandy said that I had died.
I was hoping to reunite them in New York.
Turns out...
I was so close when they took her.
But I could not tell where nobody was.
"Someone that has blocked the entire area.
It's not possible.
For me and you... perhaps not impossible for her.
She has two years more than me.
Who knows what can she do?
When the lock down,
Anna disappeared.
Even if she had that power, why did she leave out?
Maybe all this has been armed by the NSA to get it.
She does not work for the NSA.
See, she never made the union complete with you, right?
Just because I do not know every micro detail about it... not to say that I does not know, okay?
"I know her.
"Why did they take... back to House instead of killing it?
How do you know that?
"I broke into an NSA agent.
The entire house is locked.
They do not let Sandy out.
"I'll take it from there.
-What will you do?
Walking away and go through security?
I have no idea.
But even though Anna is not there,
I have to do something.
They are killing our people.
Do not you care?
-Of course I care.
"And what will you do about it?
I do not know, Josh.
What are you thinking?
You want to take the Bridger?
Declare war all the NSA?
Perhaps give a coup, while you're there?
You have always been older sister.
I guess I always hoped you know what to do.
Nor is it easy for me.
I do not know what happened to you.
"I'll tell you what happened to me.
A few months ago
I had no future... now I have.
At the zoo.

Looks like you did something angered that someone there.
Any idea of u200bu200bwhat can be?
No, sir;

They mentioned something about
Las Vegas. Sounds familiar?
Anyway, I'll replace it, at least until the next turn.
Yeah, okay.
I guess I should go to Alexandria, then, right?
I need the code authorization today.
Yes, of course.
Okay, stay calm.
Calm down, everything will work out.
What is today's code?
Lord, I need the code.
Yes, one second.

I mean, you're already here for a while, right?
So you know what is happening.

Well, it might be safer lraque be in, whatever...
My goodness... you are Joshua Lazarus.
Do not believe it's you.
What do you know?
Disappeared on a mission
A few weeks ago... but was not given as dead yet.
Some kids say it still alive, no longer sick.
Yes, Josh?
You better?
Hey, Chrissie,
I can not talk now.
Can you help me here?
Not to be paranoid.
Listen, Stevens does not need worry about this nonsense.
No problem.
I've been here seven years... nothing happened.
I'll call for help.
The phones are silent.
What do we do?
Damn! There is nothing to do.

Hello, Lazarus.
You were right, Sandy.
How?
I mean, since when?
My whole life, just like you.
They want to speak up, for God's sake?
Let me explain to him.
Will be faster.
It is important that you know why things are so.
Why are you killing us?
I'll join you.
So you know everything.
No.
Fair enough.
Come on, let me show you.
You can create scenarios rudimentary.
I build cities.
With people and I control.
Throw your wallet on the floor.
Are not real.
Saint-real enough.
Kick-it.
They may not exist out there but there are here.
And this is a small part.
The new skills you getting... they reach 29 or 30 years and only get stronger.
You can not imagine things I can do.
That 'the panic.
Yes
So imagine how normals react.
A powerful attacker can not hide... but if there are many, they would exterminate us.
As it stands,
Some believe that the invaders...
-Are too risky.
Bridger-know?
No. She thinks my skills are limited as its... and yet she is terrified.
The only answer... was convincing the NSA that the invaders are useful for a few years... before they learn too to be reliable.
They think that this system keeps us under control.
In fact, does exactly Bridger
I want it to do... without even realizing it.
E. .. it goes much higher.
Of course, the scary part is to oversee the deaths... of my own children.
But it was necessary.
Have a good few years... is better than nothing.
Then, with the NSA, I invented
Widmann's syndrome.
It allows you to decide end their lives... with dignity.
I understand.
Great. Because now, you understand what's coming.
Sure, Margot, he is ready.
We have a job for you, Lazarus.
We want you take control of the House.
You will have the same authority
Sandy has always had that.
You will report to me,
Of course, as he does.
You owe me an explanation.
Why do I keep healthy?
It is an anomaly. Every disease has someone who flees the statistics.
That 'gives hope for the other attackers.
What happens if I say no?
I do not recommend it.
Now you understand, Joshua,
I'll have to get in your head... and ensure that you have accepted our terms unconditionally.
And you know, there's someone what could be his companion.
'Take the job.
And the right thing to do.
The right thing?
We can help people and stay together.
What more could we ask?
Dying does not solve anything.
And he will not kill you only.
He'll kill me too.
I know.
I said:''I know''.
So tell Sandy you accept.
Tell him I'll do everything together.
Okay, I accept.
Under one condition.
We will announce complete healing of Widmann.
You know it's impossible.
You do not have the courage to kill myself.
You alleviates their guilt, doing that is our decision.
If you do not accept the position,
I'll give it to a normal.
Who knows what that will mean for its people?
Is that... an abomination.
"How dare you say something?
-Stop.
Sandy, stop.
If you have loved someone in life, would know that it does not work.
-That does not change the truth, Joshua.
"Just because you save some lives... this does not entitle him to take others.
You better try your luck with normals.
Reconsider, Joshua.
Or you two will be dead in a minute.
In less than that.
You should think carefully on your choice, Bridger.
My God.
We will tell the kids what is happening... and none of them will a service for you.
"We have to go immediately...
-Shut up, Sandy.
I have a bigger problem here.
Our offer is flexible.
You know my terms.
Those guys will know Kira. lmagine how it will be revealing.
Okay.
You can not think to allow that to happen.
You do not see the consequences for our people? lnvasores can be trained not to abuse their powers.
Do not be naive.
If people have power, they will use it.
I'll do one last favor.
No one should die alone.
No.
Goodbye.
I wish there was another way.
-Josh, we have to...
Go away, Kira.
Kira!
I will watch it later.
You can not fight everyone.
Make union with everything.
We'll get together.
You were wrong about everything.
I was?
It was, yes.
Sandy was killed, no?
That 'depends.
If I never come to... then yes, he killed himself.
No.
Put that gun.
Our deal still holds?
Yes
Are you here?
I'm here.
Visit us at: www.evoleech.org:)
Man: Stop!
He's running towards--
Stop!
On the ground!
What happened?
Here on the remote island of Kuttyhunk globally famed as a hotbed for scientific research...
Proverbial gold has been found in a new breed of pearl, genetically engineered by the innovative scientific community that lives and runs this tiny island.
Scientists from around the world moved here after World War ll as a meeting ground for inventive minds.
Mason, famous for controlling his image, refused to comment on this groundbreaking achievement.
Man:...Ieaving this reporter wondering, if they can produce this, what else are they capable of?
Today is day one of the Human Growth Project.
We believe that through continued development of parasitic research we can provide humanity with a tool that will remove the limitations placed on us by our DNA.
Some people thought this to be impossible until now.
This is important.
This is monumental.
And we have distribution in six out of the eight major territories-- quite an achievement.
We need to think even bigger.
We need to think global.
We need to think evolution.
Look at where we started and look how far we have come.
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible.
Behind this curtain--
Run! Run!
We've managed to control the outbreak.
There have been fewer than two dozen deaths.
- ( screaming )
- In the pan is a layer of ocean water.
And since the island is surrounded by salt water,
I think the mainland will remain safe for quite some time.
But we are so close.
Amanda has the antidote.
We can reverse-engineer--
I can make this work.
This is sadly part of the process.
Man: Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Get out of here!
Let me in! Let me in!
Oh, Jesus.
- Sarah, hey.
- Hey.
- It's nice to put a face with the name.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
Hi. How's everything at the camp?
Fine, I guess.
- It's not that bad.
- What's not?
He's landsick.
Things are still moving.
Yeah, I don't feel too well either.
It is a little choppy out there.
You don't have to make excuses for me.
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.
Weird being back, huh?
A little.
I told you I'd take care of it.
No, it's good to get closure.
I'm glad you called. The compound's kind of fallen apart over the years.
That's why I brought my cleaning crew.
- Oh my God.
- How do you guys know each other?
Boyfriend, stepbrother, friend.
- Best friend.
- Best friend.
Should we show them how we make out sometimes?
What? Like you guys don't want to see us making out.
And you're Mason's niece?
He was my great uncle, yeah.
He and your mom are pretty famous here on the island.
Jamie: Actually, my mom died here when I was a kid.
But Marco got a call that Mason had passed away and left his property.
So we're just here to clean it and sell it.
- Is it worth a lot?
- It's worth $2 million, actually.
- No way.
- But the weirdest part is that last month I was paying their rent and this month they're millionaires.
- You're gonna let that go?
- I'm not saying you have to pay me--
- It's my fault.
- Justin.
No. I got sick and they paid for me again.
He has low immunity.
I should be paying you back.
Don't worry about it, bro.
It'll work out.
And we're gonna pay back your trust fund with interest.
Awesome.
Do you hear that?
She's fine, baby.
Go to sleep.
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm fine.
I'm not worried, sweetie.
Come here.
They're awake.
Robert.
Honey, get up.
Robert: What?
Emily.
Emily, it's gonna be okay, baby.
We're gonna get you some help.
We're fine, Dad.
Daddy.
This place is worth $2 million?
Okay, well, I stayed up all night making the CD so that when we clean we could--
Wait, you said tonight was chill time.
But it's French '80s disco.
French '80s disco?
Jamie, I'm gonna go to my room take off my shoes, tickle my accordion and go to bed.
- And tomorrow we can do--
- Kristin.
Tomorrow we can do it, Jamie.
Am I right?
- No.
- I deem this weekend you shall be with a mustache.
- No.
- It's a mustache weekend, Justin.
- Kristin.
- And it looks so perfect.
You look like a man.
Oh, do you think you could grab my accordion?
It's too heavy for me.
Thank you.
But be careful with it.
It means a lot.
Why did you even invite her?
Because that chick would body-block a bus for me, and she hates public transportation.
Come on, baby, this is me.
I just--
I want to sell this place, you know, and have it be done.
You are in luck,
'cause I am here-- the fixer of all things.
Yeah, after you break them.
Yeah, but I fix them though.
Did you hear anything?
No, sorry, babe.
- Slimy Toads.
- Huh?
Slimy Toads-- it's the name of our bunk.
So why don't you make your call and then meet me there... naked?
I like Slimy Toads.
- Mommy.
- Jamie.
I'm so proud of you.
I like it.
How is this any different from the last room?
Well, you're here, for one.
So?
So I'm scared to be alone, Justin.
I don't want to get hurt again.
I don't know. I get scared.
- ( screams )
- What?
I totally got you.
Bottom or top?
I like it on top.
Good. It's all yours.
No, Justin, I said that I like it on top--
Justin: Could you not--?
I came here to get some quiet, not to be told what to do by some bossy boss lady.
You know, some people think
I'm fun.
Good.
Fuck.
Hey, excuse me.
How are you?
Do you happen to know where a local pay phone is?
What the hell?
Moron.
On the TV I saw a man selling second chance
I thought, "What kind of sucker needs to buy self-confidence?"
I sit alone on a Friday night in boxer briefs
Saying I realize--
Oh, this is incredible.
Gina.
No, I mean you told me about them but--
We've got to figure out how this is happening again so we can stop it. Listen.
Infection, cellular lymphomatosis fusion, reproduction.
Gina, these things infect.
They ingest.
They multiply and destroy.
There's no middle ground here.
Maybe it's some kind of mutation gestating in a plant or a bug.
I mean, parasites live just about anywhere.
A fish maybe?
No, probably not a fish, at least not saltwater anyway.
Watch.
Watch what happens.
Here. Salt kills parasites-- their chief vulnerability.
Well, handy that we're surrounded by salt water.
Talk to me about the first outbreak then.
Well, parasites have been used in science for hundreds of years now.
Tapeworms are utilized to keep people thin.
Maggots are used for exfoliation.
Parasites-- microscopic parasites can be given a simple set of instructions.
They then burrow into their host and they can manipulate their DNA.
We started with shellfish, engineering oysters that produced perfect, lustrous and round pearls.
And money from the pearls funded further research.
We set out to make the perfect human.
And at first we were successful.
They became strong, their senses heightened.
The subjects became intuitive.
But we made one major miscalculation.
The parasites needed to feed and consumed the host from the inside.
Okay, you can't tell me that and then leave me alone in here.
Gina, it'll be fine.
I'll just be a minute. You're okay.
But--
I'm not gonna be able to keep this a secret much longer.
People are gonna think--
People will think what I tell them to think.
- Things have changed, Larkin.
- You forget who you're talking to.
Are you questioning my loyalty here, Jake?
Oh, I'm questioning a lot more than that, Doc.
How dare you bring Jamie onto the island without consulting me?
If there's even a chance that she can bring us to the antidote, we've got to try.
You still believe that fairy tale?
No, this is our burden, Macavire.
We said that coming in and I'm saying it now.
Bringing innocents into this is madness.
No, not bringing them would be.
We have a larger responsibility.
I wouldn't be lecturing anybody on responsibility, Doc.
Stanley, please.
It's over.
It was a freak incident.
It's been 20 years.
That's what concerns me.
You'll do as you're told.
Jamie leaves now.
Wouldn't be the first time you've been wrong, Larkin.
Mm-hmm.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Justin!
- What?
- You're not very good at that.
You try it.
I saw some townspeople today.
Oh, yeah? Did you paint mustaches on their faces too?
- No, actually it was really creepy--
- I don't care.
Are you still mad about that?
Beginner's luck.
And I'm not mad.
Why do you need to be alone so bad?
Why can't you be?
We have orders.
Goody.
This can't be done.
You've already done it.
Amanda: On shellfish.
What you're talking about is something completely different.
Mason: I have faith.
Well, I have doubts, Mason.
It's too big. It's too dangerous.
And there's no time for--
Mason: Necessity is the mother of invention.
Right?
Jamie, stand up.
Let me see how big you've gotten.
Okay, look.
Coming.
- Jamie Ackerman?
- Yes.
My name is Larkin Holberman from the city council.
We know of your great uncle's passing and we wanted to extend our most heartfelt condolences.
Mason was a friend.
Thank you.
So I'm pleased to inform you the City of Kuttyhunk has agreed to offer you
$75,000 for the rights to this land.
No, thank you.
We have more substantial offers.
From other islanders?
No, from the mainland.
But Miss Ackerman, you only have the rights to this property.
Ownership can only be exchanged between islanders.
No.
I actually have this.
Uh, let's see...
Okay, right here, actually.
In the state of Maine--
I'm afraid the local statute takes precedence in cases like this.
Have you discussed this with a lawyer?
No, I talked to a real estate agent.
I suggest that you talk to a lawyer.
Are you saying that I have no course of action?
Well, you could take it up with the head of the city council.
- Great. Who is that?
- That would be me.
This land is worth $2 million.
- I'm afraid my hands are tied.
- Are they?
But we do have $75,000 for you.
This won't even cover our debt.
It's better than nothing,
Miss Ackerman.
Think it over.
And I am truly sorry.
Enjoy the ham.
I was thinking about it, and I think we should just spend it all.
Marco--
Humor me.
How would you spend it?
A 50-day 50-state shopping spree.
Ooh, reckless spending.
I like it.
What is that?
Hey, did you bring your medicine with you?
I'm fine.
Dude, you know we're alone on this island.
I'm really sorry if I pissed you off or something, but we should probably try to make the best of it.
We can play bullsnit.
Bullsnit?
It's this game where I say something, and if you think it's fake you say "bullsnit."
And if it is fake, then I'll make a funny face.
And if it's not fake, they you'll make a funny face.
Okay, I think this game sounds dumb.
How about this one?
I had a thing with Marco before Jamie did.
Bullsnit.
- Oh my God.
- Mm-hmm.
Face.
Kristin: Good.
Justin: What happened?
I can't tell you because that's not the rules of the game.
Your turn.
Okay, this is-- this is kind of messed up, but when me and Jamie were kids--
Wait, your dad married her mom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
After she left the island she came to live with us for three months.
And we used to experiment sexually a little bit.
Oh my God.
Face.
Oh my God, that was pretty good.
In all seriousness though,
I know I've been kind of aggressive with you, and it's because I like you.
And we only have two days left, so...
Kristin--
And I'm snitting.
It's just I'm not the kind of guy that gets together with girls, you know, just for-- you know, that--
For fun?
Yeah. It's not you.
It's just, you know, 48 hours just--
I don't think, you know, probably--
Is that cool?
Totally.
Bullsnit.
You know, I would say like, if I can drive six miles without pushing the brake, then Johnny Dexter will ask me out.
And?
I mean, it works usually.
Like I would say, if I can hold my breath until I see a blue Prius then I would lose five pounds.
And you did?
No, not every time.
- I wouldn't always see a blue Prius.
- ( laughs )
Okay, so you're saying if I could swim across that lake, then I'll get whatever I want?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
There has to be an aspect of randomness to it,
Iike if you could tread water until you see a bird--
--then I'll get whatever I want.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, okay then.
Ohh-hh.
- I'm doing it.
- ( laughs )
Holy Christ, it is cold.
Holy what?
Watch out for sharks.
What?
Jamie: Mason and I used to play this game all the time.
He called it "the hunt."
It reminds me-- my uncle used to distract me.
He used to stick up his left hand.
And if you focus on the left hand, you don't see what the right hand is doing.
That's fascinating.
We're missing something.
Kristin: Maybe it's not meant to be.
No, I got a few more hours in me.
Really?
No, I'm giving up right now.
Kristin: I'm getting hungry.
Look!
Justin: What? Oh.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
It had to be while treading water.
Really?
Yeah, I don't know.
It's how l--
Really?
Come here. You're shivering.
No, I'm fine.
Here. Is that better?
Yeah, thanks.
- Does that help?
- Yeah, I think so.
Oh, I forgot that you don't hook up with girls just for fun.
Screw it.
I'm quick.
Yeah, me too.
Justin.
Come here.
Put your hand on my neck?
That's anticlimactic.
Is there anything fun?
This is kind of fun.
Wow, it's beautiful.
Hmm.
What's in there?
Pictures.
Oh, wow.
I got it.
And now I'd like to introduce the man of the hour and someone I am proud to call my friend,
Mason Lane.
I know this.
- Mason: Thank you.
- This is important.
Mason: Before we continue,
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible.
Jamie, you guys, something's wrong with Justin.
Now in order for lntercorps to continue to expand at its desired rate, we need to think bigger.
We need to think global.
We need to think evolution.
Behind this curtain--
Mason: We need to think evolution.
Parasites feed on adrenalin.
And once they acquire the taste, they grow, consuming it from the host.
This perfect strand will be ready in months;, not years, not decades-- in months.
It is the key to our continued evolution.
Intercorps can bring this to the world.
Imagine the possibilities.
I beg you not to stop us from completing our task.
It is Adam's rib.
Was he breathing?
I don't know.
He was scared.
He just started shaking, so I came to get you guys.
Where were you?
It was right here.
Justin!
Justin!
Justin! Justin!
What's going on, buddy?
Can you talk?
I'm so cold.
It's ripping me.
- What was that?
- We gotta get him to camp, come on.
- What the fuck was that?
- You're scaring him. Help me out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
We're gonna get you help.
Marco: Help me out.
Help me out.
Tell me exactly what happened.
We were near the water and then he went into the water.
- Maybe the lake's contaminated.
- Did you see that thing in his stomach?
- I saw it too, maybe a muscle spasm.
- Is he getting sick again?
- Let's not think that.
- Did you see any signs?
- I don't know what to look for.
- Where are his pills?
- Jamie: He gets shots now.
- Marco: He needs a doctor.
I'm getting help.
( Jamie knocking ) Sarah, there's something wrong with Justin.
I'm gonna run down to the dock, see if I get any service.
I should clean off maybe.
Yeah, it's fine.
He's not going anywhere.
I'll be back soon.
Hang in there, buddy.
Are we being followed?
Jamie: This is the closest place with a phone?
Sarah: Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone there?
Please, my brother is sick.
Can I just use your phone?
Please.
I can see you.
Please, I just need your help.
My brother is sick.
Hello?
I can see you.
Please, my brother is sick.
- Jamie: Should we go to the cops?
- Sarah: They're idiots.
We're not going to the cops.
Dr. Mac will know what to do.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Are you okay?
You're better now.
Me?
I'm fine.
Did you break the door?
Uh...
- You got a little--
- What?
- A little something.
- Oh.
I don't think you finished, but I'll do it for you.
A little mustache.
A mustache.
Really?
Kristin: What?
Well, round two?
The shower's ready.
Jamie: Dr. Mac's house, right?
Sarah: Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Look.
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Hello?
Hey, it's Jamie.
Kristin: Thank God. I've been trying to reach you for, like, five minutes.
Justin is okay.
What happened?
I don't know.
He just-- he got better.
Really? That's great.
We're headed home.
Hello, is anybody out there?
Can you hear me?
Hello, is anybody out there?
Can you read me?
- Man: Oh, yeah.
- ( wood creaking )
I'm sleeping.
( rock music playing, people chattering )
What can I do you for?
Whiskey.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I talk to you for a second?
I'm busy here.
I've never really done this before, but I see you with your friends, surrounded by all this stuff, these people, and I don't know, you seem interesting.
Really?
I could be totally wrong, but I see someone who's stuck, wanting, waiting to get away from here, to be something, someone whom you forgot to be.
This guy, man.
He's treating you poorly.
You should leave him.
I'm not saying that I can help you get there or anything.
I just feel like maybe we're the same, you know?
Two little people wanting a chance to be different.
Yeah, you got me all figured out.
No. No.
Please, this is ridiculous.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Then why is your heart racing?
Is there a problem?
Only if you want one.
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Andy.
Yeah? I don't think so. I saw this guy physically grabbing on you.
As if there's any other way.
What did you say?
I said you're a small-town boy who should be moving on now.
You're the one who needs moving, pussy.
I sure as shit ain't gonna let you sit here and put your filthy hands all over my girl.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Goddamn right I'm right.
We should go outside.
You guys, this is so stupid.
Shut up.
This asshole can't just walk in here with his stupid-ass sunglasses and act like he owns the place, no.
You can walk away from this.
You sure do talk tough.
Why don't you show me what you got?
But that's not how it works.
You have to come to me.
'Cause you're scared?
That's what I thought.
Hey!
No harm no foul.
Have a drink on me.
Seriously, guys,
I don't want to hurt you.
All right.
This has been fun.
That was incredible.
No no.
He's drunk.
Come on, let's go, okay?
Wait wait, let me see your eyes.
- You're freezing.
- I'm fine.
- What is this?
- It's nothing.
What is this?
- It's nothing.
- ( straining )
Just a second.
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
You didn't have to do that.
Oh, yes, I did.
You had us worried there for a minute.
Yeah.
But you're better.
Much.
Here you go.
Your mom used to make my dad breakfast in bed.
What?
Yes, she would-- she would cut a flower and put it in a vase and surround it with salt and pepper shakers and make egg in the hole.
Yeah, egg in the hole.
I remember that she did that the day that they talked.
She didn't know that I was there.
I was just playing by the side of the bed and--
And she said that every time she looked at me she thought about my mom and how much he loved her.
And then-- and then she said that she couldn't stand it anymore.
And a few days later they-- they came to pick me up.
And-- yeah.
You know, you should be glad you didn't grow up in that house.
It was not good.
Justin, we're not getting money.
What?
I thought I could handle it, but--
I wanted to get you that treatment.
It's stupid, I know.
No. No, it's not stupid.
Jamie, you're my sister.
Step-sister.
But you're my blood.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I guess I'm not 100% yet.
Where's Kristin?
Okay.
Thanks.
- How's it going?
- Good.
Just chopping away.
Looking good.
Thanks.
I, uh...
This is awkward.
You're Jamie's only family and--
My God, why is this so hard?
Um...
I-- what I was asking is--
I was asking for Jamie's hand in marriage.
Wow.
Yeah, it's-- this isn't easy for me.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
Relax.
- I mean, I brought the ring.
- ( screeching )
You know, I wasn't gonna ask, but everything's been so tense around here that I thought, you know, maybe I would, you know--
Listen, I'm late for meeting Kristin by the lake, but I'm happy to be brothers.
( whispering ) Hello, Jamie?
Anybody? Hello?
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Jamie, hello? Jamie?
Can you hear me?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do you want to open a military supply shop?
- We're not getting the money.
- Huh?
There was some ordinance.
And I tried to fix it, but it got all messed up.
And there weren't any phones.
God, Marco.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Listen, we can open a flea market.
- I want you to relax.
- Really?
Yeah, as long as you handle the fleas.
I don't like bugs.
I was so nervous to tell you.
Well, speaking of nerves...
- ( knocks on door )
- Yes?
Excuse me.
Is someone here sick?
- Who wants to know?
- I found this note on my door.
Dr. Macavire.
Jamie Ackerman.
I used to play with your granddaughter.
Oh, yes, absolutely, of course.
It's great to see you again.
The note says that your brother is unwell. Are you he?
No, he just left a minute ago.
- Hmm, that's a speedy recovery.
- Yeah, it was, actually.
Muscle spasms, shortness of breath, disorientation, complaints of cold?
- How did you know?
- He just left, you say?
- Yeah.
- Where? How long ago?
To the lake, about five minutes ago.
We can catch up to him--
He's on foot on the trail to the lake.
- What are you doing?
- Jamie, are these his sunglasses?
Jamie, he's diseased.
He's very sick.
And I need to see him right away.
For what?
- To help him, of course.
- ( footsteps )
What's with all the heavy artillery?
He already attacked one woman, killed her.
She was last seen with him. Those glasses were found next to the body.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- No, of course not, but it does raise suspicions.
- Come on.
- Jamie.
Kristin!
Kristin!
- Gun!
- ( two gunshots )
You're gonna kill us all.
No, man, just you.
Look at him.
He's sick.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God.
Darren Francis Roberts,
Mary's son, three kids, a good man.
That he was.
How is this happening, Doc?
A half-life maybe.
I don't know.
Tape 'em.
Jake--
Feeling better?
What is this place?
It's our sanctuary.
Who are you?
It's me, sweetheart.
Welcome home.
Oh my God.
Mason. Oh God.
You've grown.
Look.
One of God' overlooked gifts to humanity,
Iike me.
This will keep you safe.
Mason, I can't do this anymore.
I know.
- What are you doing?
- What needs to be done.
Now she has to give us the antidote.
You've lost it, Mason.
Tell me where the antidote is so I can save you.
I destroyed it.
You killed her.
Mason: This solution helps to keep the parasites at bay.
Your mother had developed an antidote that could have stopped all of this.
But it doesn't matter now.
Even if you do know where it is, you are the only one.
What's gonna happen to Justin?
I've been watching you.
I needed a diversion to get you here alone.
This is the place where your mother and I designed to evolve mankind.
I have devoted my life to that goal.
But I became old and ill.
I had to infect myself in order to survive.
But I'm close.
Any day now my work will be complete.
When I was stationed here with the task of evolving mankind--
That's enough!
No!
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Go through sections 1, 3 and 6.
See if there are any survivors and bring them here.
Sections 4, 8 and 11 have all been overrun.
Larkin, my father lives in 11.
- Jamie over walkie-talkie: Hello?
- No.
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Jamie, is that you?
Thank God.
I'm trapped in a laboratory with Mason Lane.
Whoever you are,
I need your help.
Jamie, listen,
I know where you are.
Get out and find someplace to hide.
I'm on my way.
You take care of them.
I'll deal with this.
Man: Somebody help me!
Man: Help!
It's over, Jamie.
Come out.
It's over.
Mason.
Ah, coming to touch greatness again?
No, I came to see the man who spoke of greatness but never understood what that meant.
Let's put an end to this.
I came unarmed.
That was a mistake.
Stop.
- It's over.
- Yes.
No.
God damn it all, it shouldn't have come to this.
We're in the business of helping mankind, not killing innocent people.
And you shouldn't even be here.
God damn Macavire
Iuring you out here with some made-up inheritance story.
Wait, why would he do that?
Because he wanted the antidote to stop the outbreak
- and he thought you had it.
- What about you trying to get rid of me for 75 grand?
I was trying to save you, to get you away from all this.
Save me?
You and Mason killed my mother.
No, sweetheart,
I came back for you.
It was me that got you off the island.
Your mother died trying to stop that lunatic.
She knew that the antidote was the only thing that could stop his master plan.
If you do have the antidote, this island is the last place you should be.
Your mother--
- ( car honking continuously )
- ( baby crying )
Is that Sarah's car?
Okay.
Larkin: You got it?
Jamie: Yeah. Shh.
Shh.
Let's get you out of here.
It's okay. Shh.
There should be a gas can in here somewhere.
What is this place?
We preserve the pearls with salt and ship them around the world.
Come on.
That's what all these people are doing on the island.
We've got a ready-built--
Here, fill the engine.
I'll be right back.
Just go do it now. Go.
You don't have to do this.
Wait. Please.
If you're looking at the left hand, you don't see me.
Wait. Wait.
Wait.
Please.
Jamie, don't go.
Please don't leave me here.
Come back.
I don't want this.
Jamie.
Jamie!
This will keep you safe.
Man over radio: Boat 0110, abandoned boat off starboard bow.
It appears to have one infant passenger onboard, no adults. Over.
Female dispatcher: 3249, confirm sole infant onboard. Over.
Man: 0110, visual confirmation of an infant onboard.
Request permission to pursue rescue. Over.

Locked on Gamilas ship.
How long?
15 seconds till we're clear.
All Units,
Clear cannon trajectory.
Roger.
2199, off mars.
Let them come in close.
Five seconds.
Fire shock cannons!
Huh?!
They're stronger than our data says!
That's brand-new data!
How did they shift?
We're hit aft!
Losing thrust!
Turrets 1 and 2 hit!
Fuyuzuki destroyed!
Incoming!
Quick! Get that fire out!
We have no ship that can beat them.
Message from yukikaze.
We're getting wiped out, captain.
We'll cover you. Get out of here.
Kodai! Don't be a fool!
I've never wished more than to be of use to you.
You've still got things to do!
Captain Okita...
...we're proud to have fought alongside you.
Sanada...go get 'em!
Don't, Kodai!
Kodai...
The infinite reaches of space...
...a realm of silent light.
Stars die, and stars are born.
Yes. The universe is alive.
But at this moment...
...the end is near for one planet.
Space Battleship Yamato
Five years ago...
...an unknown enemy appeared in the region of mars...
...and began raining meteorite bombs down upon the earth.
The year is 2199.
The beautiful blue earth is polluted by radiation...
...and humanity stands on the verge of extinction.
People have fled underground, struggling desperately to survive...
...but with no hope left...
...now they simply sit and wait for the end.
You're one of them damn fools, aren't you.
Looking for metal scraps to give to the defense force.
What good'll that do?
We're beat, and you know it.
No.
That guy...
...trades it for stuff from his brother in the forces.
Drugs, alcohol...
The forces? Is that right?
Yeah.
You trade rare metals, right?
So that's what you're up to, huh?
Hook me up, with that brother of yours, OK?
What's that for?!
Lithium, 50 centimeters down.
Radiation density 14 sieverts.
Twice fatal dosage. You will die.
I know that, analyzer.
Yes.
Flying object! Incoming!
This is the capsule that was recovered.
What's that?
It's like...
...schematics.
Who found it?
A civilian salvage hunter.
His suit was ripped open and he took a high dose of radiation.
They're washing him down now but he probably won't survive.
Okita!
Hold it!
Keep still!
Hold onto him!
He seems fine now, though.
Stop! You'll contaminate the entire ship!
Are you captain okita?
Why?
You used yukikaze as a shield.
Then you ran away.
Right?
Answer me!
Kodai, stop it!
Kodai?
Mamoru Kodai was my brother.
You're Susumu Kodai?
You used him as a shield...
...sacrificed your whole escort, and you're still alive?
Doesn't that bother you?
Why should it?
Don't make me laugh.
That's enough!
That hurt, damn it...
Yuki Mori?
What would a civilian know,
Mr. Kodai?
You weren't there!
Come quietly!
Let go off me!
Hands off!
Kodai!
Sometimes one has to make it back.
Huh?
Saito! Go easy on him!
He's an injured man.
I'm sorry, Captain Okita.
I didn't mean that to happen.
I went and told him how Captain Kodai died.
Dr. Sado...I understand.
I'm sorry.
Anyway...
...how is he still alive after a fatal dose of radiation?
Yes. He should be dead.
You had a hard time.
We were wiped out.
We have no way of resisting Gamilas.
And we don't know what they want or who they are.
They're tough.
As we fight, they study us and just get stronger.
And we can't keep up with them...
And so...
...the time comes when we must evacuate earth...
...with a chosen few.
On that subject, sir...
... I ask you for this ship.
What?
Not so a selected elite can live a few days longer...
...but to go on a journey of hope.
In that way at least humanity will not be in despair...
...but rather in hope...
...at their moment of death.
What kind of a story are you going to feed them, Okita?
People of Japan,
I have an important announcement...
...concerning the future of humanity.
I ask you to respond calmly.
Analysis of a communications capsule discovered off cape Bonomisaki...
...has revealed the following very significant message.
This, we believe, is our solar system...
...and our galaxy, the milky way.
Here, in the large magellanic cloud...
... is the origin of the message...
...the planet lskandar.
They have expressed a desire to provide us with a device...
...that eliminates radiation.
Thus...
Can it go that far?
It might be a trap!
How long will it take?
There are military secrets involved, so I can only say...
...we have received technology by which the journey...
...can be made very quickly.
It's a gamble, right?
Are you sure they'll get back?
Will the public agree?
There's no time to ask!
Earth...
...is past the point...
...Where we can hem and haw over "gambles" or "being sure".
We calculate that within one year humanity will be extinct.
There are some who say it is only a matter of months.
This offer from lskandar...
...for us...
... is our last hope.
Fellow citizens...
... if we can obtain this device, we can survive.
Then we can...
... Ieave the underground and live again on the surface.
We cannot simply stand by as Gamilas destroys Earth...
...with its meteorite bombs.
We have been given this last chance!
We will, with our own hands, restore the green Earth.
Shall we not, then...
...obtain this radiation device and restore the beautiful earth...
...as it was five years ago?
To this end the defense force is calling for volunteers...
...with military or astronaut qualifications...
...with experience in scientific research...
Kodai, Susumu.
You're alive!
Sorry?
I don't believe it! How?!
Open wide.
Doctor, do you mind?
There are people waiting.
Oh, right.
You have experience leading a...
...fighter squadron? a civilian? How?
I've re-enlisted.
And I don't need that.
I've got my own.
A cat...
Hold it!
You're coming?
Why not?
It's Okita's ship.
I know.
Mr. Kodai!
What?
What are you up to?
Nothing.
Battle stations!
I'll go to the 1st bridge. scramble the black tigers.
Says who?!
As of now, I'm squadron leader.
I'm counting on you, "Ace".
There is a Gamilas missile...
... heading straight for you.
They would seem to know about your vessel.
Prepare to launch!
Shima, initiate wave engine!
Shima?
Roger.
That's it. Good boy!
This is...
That's right. The Yamato
Iaunch Yamato
Iaunching Yamato
1500 kilometers!
We won't make it.
Sanada.
We will now test the wave gun.
Target is the incoming missile.
It's not checked yet.
So?
Well, I think we can fire it.
It's our only chance.
Make it work.
Yes, Sir.
Kodai, You've read the manual?
Sort of.
But it's an alien-supplied weapon.
I've never used one before.
Well, it's do or die.
1200 kilometers!
Raise wave-motion engine pressure. close emergency valves.
Raising wave-motion engine pressure. closing emergency valves.
Open wave-gun outlet.
Opening outlet.
Chamber pressure rising!
All energy to wave-motion gun. initiate forced induction.
Initiating.
Prepare to fire.
Shima, let Kodai do it.
It's all yours.
Release wave-motion gun safety.
Releasing. Safety locks at zero.
Pressure approaching firing point.
Releasing final safety.
Yamato on missile trajectory.
Lock on that.
Raising scope.

All systems down!
Restart!
Back-up camera functioning.
Where's Yamato?
Unable to confirm.
Did it vaporize?
The Yamato.
Yamato made it!
We used the wave-motion gun.
We've given ourselves away.
You had no choice.
I just hope the Yamato is all right.
Can you proceed?
Yes.
I want to leave the solar system before they can strike back.
All right.
Godspeed, Yamato
Aye-aye, Sir.
Warp test will take place in 24 hours.
Roger!
Right into the thick of it, huh?
It's your turn next. The warp.
But I'm surprised you volunteered.
She's our last ship.
And it's for Jiro's sake, too.
Oh, Yeah...How old is he now?
He's five.
Yeah?
It's been five years...
Mr. Kodai!
Kato? Yamamoto?
You guys are here?
We got posted to the ship today.
It'll be great to fly under you again!
Right?
Furuya...
Mr. Kodai.
Still moping in the back, huh?
Not me, Sir.
See? Am I right?
He's right.
Team Kodai requests permission to join the Yamato squadron!
You still say that?
Damn right!
That looks so stupid!
Huh?!
We brought this aboard to celebrate our reunion!
You too, Kato.
Team Kodai, be seated!
Keep it down, will you?
You'll spoil my drink.
Mori!
Why get on Mr. Kodai's case?
If we'll spoil your drink,
Why drink alone here?
This is the mess.
We're not causing any trouble.
No?
Team Kodai?
Those old stories don't depress you?
What?!
Mori, you were part of team Kodai.
You were just a babe in huge diapers back then.
I'll be our ace soon. Watch out.
Mr. Kodai, why did you come back now?
Where were you then?
Then?
When Captain Kodai got killed.
When we lost our fleet!
While we fought for our lives...
...you were back on earth salvaging scrap.
You got scared and ran, didn't you.
I can't accept...
...the great Susumu Kodai...
...fearing for his life...
...and running.
Mori!
Idiot!
Attention all hands.
When Yamato reaches mars orbit...
...We will conduct humanity's first warp test. If we fail...
...We, and all humanity, face destruction.
I ask you to focus on your duties.
That is all.
Stand by to warp.
Hey...
...What's "warp"?
I think we jump over a big piece of space.
Mr. Akagi...
Board me.
Right!
Ready BT1!
I guess the cockpit's as safe a place as any.
What's she so scared of?
Warp!
Warping!
Did we make it?
Hey...
Hey, guys...
No hull damage.
All clear ahead. No gravity field!
It worked.
Yes!
Mr. Kodai! We warped! Mr. Shima!
This is some ship!
Returning to course.
Huh?
Aihara! 1 o'clock.
Gamilas!
Why did you bring us here?!
I didn't!
Did they track our warp energy?
All hands to battle stations!
Ready wave gun!
Roger.
We can't fire it right after warp.
It uses the same energy.
Wait.
We'll warp again.
How long will that take?
20 minutes to recharge.
In 20 minutes can you find where we'll come out?
I'lll find it.
Kodai...
...cripple their warp engines so they can't follow.
Roger.
Black Tigers...
...take out their warp engines.
Let's go!
Mori, launching.
She beat us to the punch!
We should've been ready.
Are you trying to show off?
Don't get smart. This is how
I survived the fight off mars.
We warp in 20 minutes.
Be back by then.
Roger.
Yes!
Wow...
Don't forget to look out behind.
Commencing targeting the Gamilas mother ship.
Roger.
Targeting complete.
Fire cannons.
Firing.
Yay!
Yes!
Wow!
I've never seen one go like that before...
Target destroyed!
Right!
Way to go, Kodai!
Well done. Return to base.
We're about to warp.
Shima, how long?
Five minutes to full charge.
Aihara, have you found somewhere for us to go?
Just about.
Kato here. No sign of Mori. we can't raise her.
What?!
BT1, do you read?
BT1!
Do you read?
Yuki Mori!
I read you.
What's wrong?
Oxygen supply very low.
Remedy immediately.
The debris took out my engine.
You can't move?
Just leave me here.
Don't be stupid! Hang on.
There's no time!
Return to your post.
And leave her like you did my brother?
I'll be back in time.
Nanbu, take over.
Idiot!
Continue with preparations for warp.
Sir!
Aihara, call out the enemy positions as they move.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Kodai?
Two minutes to warp capability.
Emergence point confirmed.
Emergence point clear of obstructions.
It's all right.
Suffocation doesn't hurt.
It's all right. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Yuki Mori, will your ejection gear work?
Do you read me?
Go back!
I'm messing you all up.
Answer me!
Will your ejection gear work?
Yes.
Right.
I'll say when.
Five bogeys closing at 9:20!
Fire!
Port side, aft!
Sub-nozzle's out!
They rammed us?
Their fighters have nowhere to go back to.
Gamilas!
Where?
Large squadron approaching!
Damn it!
I'm behind you, Yuki.
Roger.
Go!
Recharging complete.
20 Gamilas vessels nearing impact.
There's Mr. Kodai.
Shima...
...think of them as missiles.
Let them come in close, then roll sideways to evade.
Roger!
Brace for lateral gs.
We will evade...
...then take Kodai aboard while the Gamilas are turning.
Then we will warp.
Hey! What's going on?!
Readying for evasive action.
All personnel prepare for g-force.
Five seconds to impact point!
Four...
Three...
Evading!
Open entry port!
He's in!
Warp!
Her heart's stopped!
Where's Dr. Sado?
Coming.
Yuki...
Yuki!
I'll defibrillate. Keep going.
Yuki! Don't die on me!
Damn it!
Doctor!
Stretcher!
Lift her. 1, 2, 3...
Let's go.
Your actions endangered this ship.
That is a serious offence.
That is how I do things.
I will not stand back and watch my subordinates die.
Throw him in the brig!
I'll come quietly!
Move!
You still like it in the brig, Huh?
Chief Tokugawa...
It's been a while.
You're in the brig already?
You never change.
Just for doing what I think is right.
Why does this happen?
You're two of a kind.
You're just like your older brother when he was young.
I'm like who?
Fiery, a loose cannon, but cool under pressure.
You know, Kodai,
You just might be cut out...
...to be a ship's captain yourself.
Whoever you're saying I'm like now,
My way and a certain someone's...
...are completely opposite.
Oh yeah?
I was about to say you're a lot like
Captain Okita when he was young.
Anyway, I guess we'll find out.
If we survive, that is.
Look who's here!
Hello, Doctor.
Doctor, how's Mori?
Fine. Just a few scratches.
Thank you.
Let's have a drink.
Great!
You should be grateful to the captain.
He took a big chance.
He was in a very tight spot and he hung in to the last.
He did?
You realize in that battle off mars...
...You're not the only one who lost someone.
Is this a sermon?
Did you know that the Fuyuzuki didn't come back, either?
Captain Okita's son was its navigator.
This is the Captain.
We are about to leave the solar system.
We are heading out into a realm where no human being has ever been.
Communication with earth will be impossible.
Thus today all hands will have access...
...to communications.
This could be your last message to earth.
I ask you all to take proper leave of your families.
I'm like Okita? Me?
Yeah, Right!
You have one minute.
The channel will then shut down.
Think what you want to say before you go in.
Enter lD number.
What I want to say?
There's dad!
How are you, Jiro?
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Make sure you don't catch cold.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine!
I'm too stupid to catch a cold.
Wrap a towel around your stomach when you sleep.
You always get the runs.
I'll be back soon.
I miss you.
Don't worry. I'll be back, with that radiation device.
Promise?
I promise!
Jiro...
Channel closed.
Do you have your hachiman amulet?
It'll keep the bullets away.
Yep.
I have it.
And don't forget...
Channel closed.
You worry too much.
What?
You're doing sit-ups here?
So?
You're last on the list to send a message.
A message?
Input your lD number first.
You have one minute.
Id number?
That one there.
This one?
Yes.
Mr. Kodai!
How are you?
Hey!
I'm kidding, Ando.
You're here, too?
Yes. Assigned to 3rd bridge!
Yeah?
Be seeing you.
My parents are fine.
I swore I'd be back.
Wait here.
Roger.
So you're ok? Great.
I won't thank you.
I'd rather have died than endanger this ship.
Look, could you just go a little easier?
Relax a bit.
You owe me one.
What's that?
Gotcha.
Enter lD number.
You're drinking?
You're ok?
I'm fine.
You saw Kodai?
By the message room.
He's talking to his family now.
His family? Who?
Weren't you in Team Kodai?
Yes, but he quit just after
I was assigned there.
Then I was posted, so I'm not really one of them.
I see.
I only ever joined the force because I admired Susumu Kodai...
...the "Cosmo Zero" ace.
So I guess I feel kind of sold out.
Don't tell him that
Well, the reason he quit...
Yes?
A message to my family...
When the Gamilas started bombing...
...we used to go up after them.
The bombs were more fragile, so we destroyed some...
...and knocked a few off course.
I know. It was famous.
He was the ace, and I wasn't too bad, either.
So one day we diverted a bomb, and saved the planet again.
We were delighted.
But this time the story had a different ending.
I guess you're my family.
So how've you been?
Don't start crying, Mr. Kodai.
You'll mess me up, too.
What are you talking about?
The bomb we diverted crashed into space station 2.
Oh, that...
And to make things worse, his parents were living there...
...and so was my pregnant wife.
They managed to save the child, but he's never been able to talk.
Kodai left the force right after that.
Channel closed.
The space battleship Yamato heads for the large magellanic cloud...
...to the planet lskandar...
...to obtain an anti-radiation device said to exist there.
All clear ahead. No gravity field.
Warp successful.
Bogey! It's a Gamilas fighter!
One?
Yes.
It's shut down.
It's not attacking.
No?
I'll bring it up.
Did it warp with us?
Kodai...
Bring it aboard.
We'll analyze it.
Roger.
Captain!
Call sick bay!
Take over!
Captain!
Well, Doctor?
It's progressing.
So how long do you think I've got?
Soon those won't suppress it any more.
Will I make it?
It might be unmanned.
Where's the cockpit?
I've never seen one this way.
You've seen lots of them.
Always through a canopy.
No signs of life.
Is it a drone?
Saito...
Take a fuselage sample. be careful, quick, and accurate.
As the tech officer says...
..."Careful, Quick, and accurate".
Fire!
Right! Right!
Left! Go Left! Fire! Fire!
Mr. Sanada!
Saito!
Saito!
Fight it!
Get the doctor!
Right!
Hey!
Crew of the Yamato...
The earth is...
...ours.
Who are you?
Desla.
Desla?
You call us "Gamilas".
Is that crystal thing you?
Yes, and No.
We are both individuals, and one being.
As if we were Alpha and Omega.
Why are you attacking earth?
Attacking?
We are renovating it.
Saito?
Saito!
Don't shoot!
That hurt!
Sorry.
But it takes that much power to shut down your life functions.
Thanks a heap!
Level 2 on a pulse gun could stop a bear!
Then I guess level 2 was the right choice.
It still hurt!
But anyone other than you would be in sick bay now.
And it brought you back.
For that, I thank you.
You owe me one.
Ok...
What?
And so...I will buy you a beer.
Cheapskate!
Kodai reporting.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Yes, Sir?
Kodai...
How do you like the ship?
I've never served on a battleship, so I can't compare...
...but she's a fine ship.
What did you wish to discuss?
Kodai...
...would you take over as Acting Captain?
Sir?
I'd hoped Mamoru Kodai would succeed me as captain.
My brother?
You have it in you just like he did.
You belong in charge.
Well?
No, Thank you.
I couldn't do it.
Not me.
Not the way you do.
No? That's too bad.
Excuse me.
Kodai...
There is no need to emulate me.
Do it your way.
All right, in that case...
...I will put it in the form of an order.
This is the captain.
Attention all hands.
Effective immediately, Susumu Kodai is Acting Captain. That is all.
Dismissed.
Scramble!
Gamilas attack confirmed.
All personnel to battle stations.
You're captain?
Where are you going?
The hangar!
When did it start?
I don't know. We noticed it a few minutes ago.
It's transmitting something. an SOS?
No.
Our location.
They're using that to attack.
Mr. Sanada, Take over here.
Black Tigers, Scramble!
Destroy that thing!
There'll be more.
Where are they?
Third wave approaching!
What?
Shima, evade!
Damage?
We're hit around 3rd bridge.
Crew members trapped.
Oxygen?
They're ok for a while.
Send a rescue squad.
Get me 3rd bridge.
Yes, Sir!
The elevator shaft's hit!
Mr. Kodai, it's Ando.
We're trapped!
We have wounded.
Send medics!
This is Acting Captain Kodai. a rescue squad is on the way.
We'll get you out of there.
Hang in, Ando.
They'll be there soon.
Yes, Sir.
Where are they?
Bogeys at 3 o'clock.
Shima, 90 degrees starboard.
Charge wave-motion gun.
Charging.
Raising scope.
Target: large enemy gunship. on trajectory.
Locking.
Range 60.
Energy at 120 per cent.
Ten seconds to wave gun.
All hands brace for shock and flash.
Five...
Four...
Firing!
Gunboat destroyed.
The enemy fleet is gone!
Kodai!
Impulse from below!
Below?!
Energy rising! It's going to explode!
Clear 3rd bridge!
We can't!
We'll blow up!
Passing limit!
Kodai!
Yuki, take out...
...the 3rd bridge.
That's an order!
Fire!
Roger.
It was a stealth craft.
The radar didn't pick it up.
I should have seen it.
The six crew on that bridge...
...I let them die.
I am not fit to act as captain.
Then why come back?
Why did you join up again?
To find out what manner of man you were. to find...
...what manner of man let my brother die.
I see. and...
...to see a green earth again.
Like it was when I was a boy.
I wanted to bring that back.
Tell me...
...as Acting Captain, what should I have done?
Kodai, the result isn't there for us to brood over.
What we should do doesn't lie in the past.
It's here, right now.
You use the people you have.
In theory, perhaps, but I'm not like you.
You can just let a situation roll off your back.
That's not true, Kodai.
There was a time when I was just like you.
If you've never held command you don't know the pressure.
Right?
You're doing a fine job as Acting Captain.
Kodai...
...There's...
...something I have to tell you.
Who is it?
Kodai.
Why are you here?
To apologize.
For what?
That order.
I'm sorry.
Why apologize?
There's no need.
You simply did what you had to as Acting Captain.
And an order is an order, even if...
...it means...
...shooting at...
...your own people...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lost it.
I didn't mean...
That's fine.
Don't say any more.
Prepare to enter warp.
Iskandar!
It's in sight!
So that's...
... Iskandar...
Missiles at 12 o'clock! about 60! Range 500!
They're coming from lskandar!
The gun's not charged!
I know!
Stations!
They've split into four groups, port, starboard, above, below.
All guns lock on targets!
Ten seconds!
All guns...fire!
Large missile! 10 seconds to impact!
It didn't explode!
Damage report!
Sir! The wave gun!
What about it?
The muzzle's been blocked!
What?!
Enemy fleet ahead!
Fix that wave gun!
Ready all other guns!
They'll wear us down.
Missiles, second wave.
Impact in 30 seconds.
There's too many to take out!
Warp us out of here.
Where to?
Anywhere!
It won't work!
Incoming!
Shima!
Kodai!
If there'd been anything here,
We'd have been obliterated!
We would have been anyway!
Where are we?
Still near lskandar.
Look!
Is that the same planet as before?
Affirmative.
We're behind lskandar now.
It looks just like earth!
It's Gamilas.
What?
This was a Gamilas missile.
Have we come to Gamilas instead of lskandar?
I'll bet this is a trap.
A trap?
A Gamilas trap.
Iskandar, the radiation device, all lies.
We've been had!
Why would they do that?
To lure us away.
Maybe the radiation device
Was just a story.
There was nothing about it in that capsule I analyzed.
Only directions here and plans for the wave-motion engine.
Meaning?
Someone might have made up the radiation-device story.
Why? Why would they do that?
Why did we come here?
Was the captain lying?
Never! Captain Okita wouldn't do that.
I'll go ask him.
No! This isn't the time.
It's that bad?
I'll go.
Saito!
He's the only one who knows the truth, right?
We need to ask him now!
Our fate rides on it!
Doesn't it, "Acting Captain"?
We'll go down there.
The message gave coordinate points.
We might learn something there.
Kodai! Are you crazy?!
We walk into their arms?
If this was a trap, why would they attack us now?
There must be a reason they don't want us going down there.
And anyway, there were directions and an engine plan in that capsule.
We have to go to those coordinates and find out what this is all about.
The captain believed that message.
And l...
...believe in him.
He would not lie about his feelings for earth.
Mr. Sanada...
Yuki...
Saito!
Shima...
Whose ship is this, anyway?
The 8th of the coordinates we were sent indicate...
...a point below the surface of lskandar/Gamilas, here.
Our mission is to go there.
Landing will be the black tigers, the paratroopers...
...tech officer Sanada, and myself.
Why you, Sir?
Mr. Kodai will go first to knock out their aerial defense system.
Look.
This is the zone above the landing point.
An armed, floating defense system.
We'll have to slip through it.
Impossible!
Not for the Cosmo Zero.
It predates the Gamilas attack, and has stealth capacity.
But Gamilas will detect as soon as you use the engine.
I'll be gliding in.
The black tigers attack on my order.
You'll escort the troop carrier down.
Proceed with caution.
They could be anywhere.
Can one Cosmo zero take out a whole defense system?
Attention all personnel.
This is Acting Captain Kodai.
Our landing...
...on lskandar/Gamilas is about to commence.
This will probably be the last battle in our long journey...
...of 148,000 light-years.
In April of 1945, the battleship Yamato...
...Set sail to bring a ray of hope into a time of utter despair.
We do the same.
The coordinates we were sent may be a trap.
We may only be playing into the enemy's hands.
But as long as there is one faint ray of light in the dark...
...as long as we have even a chance,
We must go forward.
That is the destiny of any ship named Yamato.
And that is the mission we have been assigned.
I ask you all to remember that.
Let us win this fight! and transform a faint chance into real hope!
For those we have left on earth...
No...for the families we love...
...Let us make earth green again!
For this ship...
...and for Captain Okita.
...I ask you all to give everything you have!
We'll take the left wing.
Mr. Kodai!
Right!
It's our turn at last!
Work!
Do it right!
To lskandar!
You probably won't make it back.
That's all we need to get us going!
See you there.
I haven't been here for a while.
Well, I'm counting on you.
Roger.
What?
Are you going to show off?
Who are you to talk?
Don't mess up, Ok?
Launching CZ1.
Mr. Kodai, what was all that about with Ms Yuki?
All I needed to get me going.
8,000 meters to surface.
Not yet not yet not yet...
Go!
Uh-oh...
Shima!
Come back alive.
Right! Time to warp!
You ok?
We're all here!
Mr. Kodai...I'll be top scorer today.
Whatever. You still mope.
No, I don't!
Furuya!
They're above us!
They're all around the carrier!
Roger.
Yamamoto...
Yamamoto!
Enemy destroyed!
There's three of us left with the troop carrier.
Roger.
Arriving at coordinate point.
It's beautiful...
The coordinate point is in there.
All units land.
Fire!
Yuki, quick!
Saito!
Move out!
Right!
Damn it!
There's hundreds of them!
Analyzer! Stand-alone mode!
Cover us!
Leave it to me.
Hurry.
Cover me!
Hey! Hey!
Make it back to earth, Mr....
Analyzer!
I'm sorry.
Quick!
I'll hold here!
Kato!
I probably won't hold it very long.
Hurry.
Move it!
Go!
Quick!
The coordinates point here.
This is lskandar?
Yuki...
Hey...
Yuki!
We have awaited you.
Yuki?
Saito went the same way.
So the lskandar story was true?
That is the name one of you gave it.
Yes...a man named Okita.
What?!
I knew it!
Kodai...
...there's...
...something i have to tell you.
That story about a radiation device on lskandar...
... isn't true.
What's going on?!
We were sent coordinates, and schematics.
That's all.
Why the story?
Because of you.
Me?
You survived a high dosage of radiation.
That has been kept secret.
I took a gamble...
...that the sender of the capsule...
...could eliminate radiation.
So with no guarantee of anything...
...we're going to lskandar?
That's right.
But...
...we have hope and a chance.
You came on board this ship hoping for something, right?
And our chances aren't zero.
You're here right now, alive.
That in itself is a chance.
We are a more evolved race...
...sharing a single conscious mind.
One manifestation of this shared consciousness...
...you call "Gamilas".
Another manifestation you call "lskandar".
Gamilas and lskandar exist as two sides of the same coin.
Our planet is about to disintegrate.
Iskandar accepts this, and is resigned to vanishing with it.
But Gamilas wishes to eliminate all earthlings...
...and render your planet fit for us to move to.
Iskandar opposes this.
Gamilas has separated from us, and enclosed us in here.
That small fragment of lskandar that remains in Gamilas...
...we secretly sent to earth.
That capsule?
And eliminating radiation?
That's what we came for.
Have no fear.
There is no such device...
...but I can fulfill its function...
...as you have experienced.
Prove it. Show us you can really do that.
We want to be sure!
This area is clear of radiation.
You can now breathe its air.
It's ok.
I will grant your wish.
My energy should be sufficient.
Yuki!
I'm fine.
It's fine.
Wait!
Mr. Sanada!
From the energy,
I'd say that's the Gamilas source.
We can stop the attacks.
Bastards!
Let's do it!
Kodai...
I'll take it out. Cover me.
You won't get close!
Once we get across,
You two leave with the Yamato.
You're crazy!
Saito!
Roger!
Wait!
I can't leave you.
Acting Captain!
Stop being a jerk!
Saito!
That hurt, Damn it!
The ship can't go without its captain.
But...
Kodai!
You're like a little brother to me.
Don't look like that.
Be a great captain.
Let's go!
Fix the earth.
I owe you this one.
Right!
Quick! Get going, you two!
Let's go.
Run!
Right!
Careful, quick, and accurate. come on, tech officer!
I'm almost done. Hold them off!
Roger!
That hurts, Damn it!
Just a bit more.
Be there for me!
You bastards!
Oh, no...
It's all right.
My Cosmo Tiger will fly.
Done!
Saito!
Saito!
Let's go home.
So there was something for the radiation?
Yes.
There really was...
Yes.
A future, and a chance...
...bought with many lives.
Proceed with caution, Kodai.
Yes, Sir.
Entering final warp.
Earth will be in visual range.
You'd better go.
Excuse me.
All right...
...Now the duel with death.
Doctor...
...Could I be alone for a while?
Dr. Sado...
...Thank you.
Where's earth?
There.
Where?
That red planet.
Yes.
That's earth!
Yes!
It's earth!
We're back!
Yamato?
This is space battleship Yamato.
Acting Captain Kodai and 36 crew.
We are now 420,000 kilometers from earth.
Did you find anything?
Of course, commander.
We have the anti-radiation device.
You do?!
The anti-radiation device...
There really was one?
Yes, Sir!
So Okita won his bet...
Well done.
Very well done!
We will soon...
...be arriving on earth.
Until then...
... hold out.
Earth, huh?
Everyone's always glad...
...to get back.
What's that?!
Large Gamilas vessel at 7 o'clock.
We're taking fire!
Battle stations!
Roger!
Damage report!
Fire crew!
They're coming!
Port guns hit!
The hull won't take this!
Launchers blocked!
Turret 2 hit!
Engine malfunction!
Tokugawa! How's that engine?
Mechanical officer! Tokugawa!
Output reduced...
...but we can still move.
Tokugawa?
Tokugawa!
Is that...
...A spaceship?
So you thought you'd won, crew of the Yamato?
And what would be victory?
Destroying us?
Or returning earth to its former state?
Desla...
Or is it "Gamilas"?
The answer is both "Yes" and "No".
Your attack destroyed most of us.
I am part of the fragment that remains.
We have given up on making earth ours.
Most of those who would have moved there have been lost.
So let us say on that point the victory is yours.
But...
...we will not give you back your earth.
What do you mean?
Earth is about to disappear.
You have enraged us.
We are a race that does not forget humiliation.
Life signs negative.
What's happening?!
What's that?!
A nuclear reaction.
A huge amount of energy!
It's going to destroy earth!
Damn him!
Nanbu, leave that.
We'll stop him.
We've got nothing left!
The wave-motion gun.
Can't we use that yet?!
The muzzle's blocked!
It'll blow up.
There'll be nothing left of the Yamato!
I'll go ask the Captain.
The Captain?
Oh, No...
Think!
Think, Kodai!
Think! There must be a way!
Think, Kodai! Think!
Nanbu...
...do we have energy for the gun?
Enough for one shot.
But like I said, if we fire it...
Mr. Kodai?
Abandon ship. That is an order
From the Acting Captain.
You're coming, right?
Did you hear me? That's an order.
Get going!
Dr. Sado, Get the wounded.
Kodai, I'll stay too.
Shima!
I steer this ship.
Listen, Shima...
...the carrier will be unstable.
I'll need you to fly it!
Kodai!
Only you...
...can get Yuki down safely, and she's the device!
But...
I am...
...Acting Captain.
I go...
...with this ship.
Kodai...
...Take control.
Roger.
All hands abandon ship!
Get going, Yuki.
I'll be right with you.
I'm staying.
Yuki!
If you can bail out, then so can l!
Do what you're told!
But you're lying!
Life in a world without you...
...won't mean anything!
Yuki...
...I don't have any family left. but I met you here.
I've wanted...
...to care for you...
...and show you earth...
... reborn.
That's what I've fought for. so let me finish the fight.
If we don't win it...
...everything we've done will be meaningless!
If I should die...
...and earth comes back...
...I'll be alive...
...in every living thing there. and so...
...I'll be with you.
No! I don't want you to die!
You can't die!
Yuki!
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Shima...
Kodai...
Take her.
All right.
She's a fine ship.
Don't waste her.
Evacuating Yamato with 12 survivors.
Make sure you get back to earth.
Roger.
Yamato will now attempt to destroy the Gamilas missile.
Pray for me.
Kodai!
Mr. Kodai?
Mr. Kodai!
Mr. Kodai...
Mr. Kodai!
Raising scope.
Launching Yamato!
Energy at 120 per cent.
Target: Gamilas missile.
Ten seconds to wave gun.
Five...
Four...
Yuki...
I'm so worried for that boy.
Joe's gonna be okay.
She was everything to him.
Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man.
But he's never had to be a father before.
I don't think he understands Joe.
How long did Elizabeth work there?
- Five years?
- No, I think it was six.
- What do you think was in the coffin?
- Jesus, shut up.
I'm just saying, 'cause of how she died.
You guys weren't wondering that?
No. I'm eating macaroni salad.
I was wondering about that, too.
I heard it crushed her completely.
Steel beam, those things weigh a ton. Literally.
I don't know how you guys can eat.
Try a turkey roll and you'll discover how.
Lucy, down!
Get down.
Joe? You seen Joe?
Bet Joe's not gonna want to do my movie anymore.
Why?
Why do you think why?
The story, it's about the living dead.
- His mother's not a zombie.
- But she's dead, shithead.
- These turkey rolls are pretty good.
- Told you.
- I just want to talk to you, Jack.
- Get him out of here.
- Hey, Dainard.
- Would you just wait a minute? Wait!
- Jack! Jack, just let me...
- No.
Get out!
Get out!
Hey, Jack!
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Jack, I...
Jack...
Joseph, I'll be home soon.
Oh, my God.
That was the longest day, ever. Here.
- What's this?
- New scene. Check it out.
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?
I don't know.
I think it might make a better movie.
- I need a better storyline...
- Hey!
...and production value.
- Guys!
Hey, guys.
Martin barfed all over his locker today.
It was the grossest one yet.
- Oh, my God! Shut up!
- I never seen so many colors in my life.
So who's gonna play the wife? Jen?
No way.
I told you what she did with my top hat.
- What wife?
- Alice Dainard.
I was returning that book on codes and ciphers_
She was in the silent reading section.
And I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.
Wait.
You talked to Alice Dainard, really?
You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section.
- Shut up.
- It's for silent reading.
She said "Yes. "
We're filming tonight, and she's driving.
Driving? Driving where?
That was a really good zombie murder.
Yeah, but it's not a story yet.
Older kids are entering this film festival,
15 and 16-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value.
I've got nothing.
- Charles, dinner!
- I'm coming!
There's this article I want you to read.
It explains everything about stories.
I just don't understand how the wife helps make it a story.
Jesus, this is what I've been explaining.
That scene we're filming tonight, where the wife is telling the detective that she's scared for him, that she loves him.
I can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard.
- Charles, come on, move it.
- I'm coming!
And wash your hands this time.
So when he investigates the zombie stuff, you feel something.
You don't want him to die because they love each other.
That make sense?
Alice Dainard. That's awesome.
- You're impossible.
- Charles! Now!
God, Mom, I'm coming!
- Midnight, okay? Don't forget.
- I won't forget.
Read this.
It's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's.
Every single person will be there, except me.
Well, then every single person can tell you how it was.
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
- Mom...
- It's your turn to babysit.
Why can't I switch with Charles?
Maybe because you crushed
Charles' top hat.
You ever think of that?
Oh, really? Well, guess what?
We're switching.
Oh, really? 'Cause guess what?
No, we're not.
That's enough. Charles, take this to the table. Benji, time for dinner!
Hey, Joe.
Night, Mrs. Kaznyk.
Take a seat. We have lots of food.
No, I'm okay. Really. Thank you, though.
- Put them at the table.
- See you tomorrow, Charles.
Later days.
There's always a place for you here, Joe. You know that.
Stop it!
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Dad?
Dad?
...that possibility with an announcement that, while it is not likely, the potential is there for the ultimate risk of a meltdown at the Three Mile Island atomic power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
Robert Schakne reports from Washington.
According to the government's top...
Hey.
I'll be out in a minute.
It's a six-week program.
Hands-on training with college coaches.
You'd like it. I know I did.
I thought I was gonna have the summer for myself.
Well, things have obviously changed for us.
And it'd be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with cameras and monster make-up.
I have to help Charles finish his movie.
I've got nothing against your friends.
I like your friends.
Except for Cary, who can't seem to stop lighting things on fire.
You'd like it there.
It's what we both need.
But they offered you no real proof he was alive.
And you didn't.
The decision was made.
- So leave the past alone, Martha.
- I can't.
Well, how much would a ton of gold be worth today?
Okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Oven
I won't. Over.
You, my little pretty one, my pretty one
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
Ooh you make my motor run, my motor run
Wait, so, guys, people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right?
I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from. Jesus.
Well, technically,
Hathaway hasn't even...
Shut up.
- Was that a rock?
- I'm sorry, Smartin.
- It was a Twizzler!
- Hey, where'd it go?
Hey, guys, look.
Guys, look! Guys!
- It's okay, Smartin.
- Shut up.
Hey, Alice.
Joe Lamb?
Yeah.
What the hell's he doing here?
Make-up, sound and special effects.
He's the Deputy's kid!
- So what?
- You knew that?
Charles, I don't have a license.
I can't drive with him.
You want Joe to stay back? I guess...
It's too late!
He's seeing me in the car right now!
You can trust me.
My dad will never know.
I won't tell him anything.
Get in.
So, I wrote a couple newlines.
Can I show you?
- What?
- New lines?
Charles, do I have newlines?
Do you know what'd be great?
Is if you could cry during the scene.
Can you do that?
- I'm impressed.
- No.
You know the first place I'm gonna drive when I get my license?
- Want one?
- New Castle, Pennsylvania.
Fireworks Capital of America.
Wait, so, I don't have newlines, right?
Because I just learned these.
Guys, there's an electrical outlet up here.
Of anything, why that?
- Charles!
- Got it.
Charles, man, do I have newlines or not? Oh, no!
Well, you just lost all your newlines,
Martin.
Guys, this is going to be great!
Get the lights and camera set up on that end, we'll shoot this direction first.
Joe, get the mike plugged in and make sure that the new batteries are in the camera
- before you do the make-up.
- Okay. Okay.
I took apart two packs of cherry bombs and I made my own M-80.
Do you want to see it?
Your obsession with fireworks, and I'm saying this as a friend, concerns me and my mother.
"Sweetheart, this is my job.
I have no choice.
"It's nothing that you need to worry about.
"What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
- "Sweetheart, this is my job. "
- Martin! I wrote a newline.
- What? No.
- What do you mean "no"? It's awesome.
- Okay, so, you know that part when...
- I just finished memorizing this line.
- It's not gonna be hard...
- Do you mind?
- So, you know that part when you say...
- No.
- Well, where'd the other line go?
- It's gone. This one's better.
Here, I'll...
- No, it didn't.
- I've never even had any lines.
- I just needed this one.
- There.
Thanks.
Look, look. Look!
Now I'm not prepared!
Look, it flows better. "Honey, I love you. "
"I love you, too. " See? It flows.
I know, but you keep changing things and making it more difficult for me.
It's... Martin, it's simple.
"I love you, too. "
It's, like, four words.
My dad works at the mill.
Four words that I don't have memorized.
Martin. Can you say, "I love you"?
Could you close your eyes, please?
Yeah.
So, the scene is very emotional.
Alice, Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investigating these zombie murders.
- Yeah, I know. We read it. We get it.
- You really hate it.
God, I'm just directing.
Martin. Martin, get in position.
You need to reassure her.
Wait. Do you know what "reassure her" means?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. We're gonna shoot on Alice's side first.
Okay, Preston, so, a few seconds after I say "action,"
I want you to walk over to the pay phone.
You know, make the place look like it's busy.
- "Hello, hello?"
- I know what that looks like.
Asshole! Could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
God. Sorry, man.
Okay, you guys, let's rehearse this.
But remember, save the real performance for when we're filming.
Here we go. Positions, and action!
So, I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'd be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
Sweetheart, this is my job.
The dead coming back to life?
- I think you're in danger.
- I have no...
I have no choice.
You do have a choice.
We all do.
John,
I've never asked you to stop.
I've never asked you to give up, or walk away, but I'm asking you now.
Please.
For me.
Don't go. Don't leave me.
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you.
I just love you so much.
I love you, too.
Was that good?
Yeah. Yeah, that was... That was great.
Production value!
- Cary, you put film in the camera, right?
- I didn't put it in.
What? Put it in, put it in!
Joe, get the mike ready! Go, go, go!
- Get in costume, costume, costume!
- Okay, I will.
Joe, help her! Hurry up!
Martin, get that tripod set up!
- Preston, get in position!
- I will. I have to get the money.
Go! Get these headphones ready!
Martin, you know your lines!
- Hurry! Get that camera ready! Go, go!
- Shut up!
We'll start on Alice and pan to the train, right?
Oh, God, I hope we don't miss it!
Shut up! I am trying!
Hurry! Get that set up!
Let's go! Positions, positions!
Ready. Start filming.
Be extra loud when the train passes by.
Here we go. And action!
Look, I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'd be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
What do you want me to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
The dead coming back to life?
I think you're in danger!
I don't have a choice!
You do have a choice!
We all do!
John, I've never asked you to stop!
I've never asked you to give up or walk away!
But I'm asking you now!
Please, for me, just don't go!
Just don't go back! Don't leave me!
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you!
- I love you so much!
- I love you, too!
- Guys, watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...
- Oh, my God!
- Run!
- Oh, my God!
- Go!
Holy shit!
Go, go, go!
Alice!
Joe, let's go! We got to go!
- Keep going!
- Are we alive?
I don't want to die!
Oh, my God!
Guys.
I'm okay.
Martin, you okay?
Though I think I'm having a heart attack.
And I have a scrape.
Joe! Oh, my God!
- Guys, did you see those explosions?
- You guys seen Alice?
That was unbelievable!
- Why did this happen?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not, dude. Look at this.
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit.
What's all that blood?
What's the blood?
Did someone get hurt?
- Joe, what are you doing?
- Joe, stop!
- Don't put your hand under there!
- Joe, you don't know what's under there!
Joe!
It's my fake blood!
It's fake.
Guys?
- Come here. What are these things?
- Shit.
No one cares! Look around you!
They look like white Rubik's Cubes, or something.
I don't think that's what they are.
They don't move.
They're heavy, like metal or something.
There's like a billion of them!
What's going on?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay, all right?
- Are you serious?
You guys! Get up here.
You can see everything from up here!
Joe!
According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare.
- It wasn't an accident.
- What?
- There was a truck on the train tracks.
- Are you serious?
What, like, driving on the tracks?
There.
Oh, my gosh.
How could a pickup truck derail a train, man? That's impossible.
Obviously, it isn't.
Holy shit!
Oh, my God. I know that truck.
Guys.
Is that him?
Yeah. It's him.
- Who?
- It is. Yeah, for sure.
Who is it?
Dr. Woodward.
Dr. Woodward, the science guy?
- Biology.
- Honors Biology.
- Wow. I'm not in his class.
- We know.
Just shut up, Cary.
Remember when Old Man Woodward took your Electronic Football?
Yeah. He put it in the dungeon and never gave it back.
The dungeon?
That trailer Woodward keeps in the school parking lot.
Dr. Woodward?
Dr. Woodward?
"Map of the Contiguous United States. "
What's the writing?
Dates and times.
Guys, what's this line?
It's a schedule for the train.
What the...
He's alive. He's alive!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Holy shit.
Who are you?
Dr. Woodward, it's me.
Charles Kaznyk. From fourth period.
You've been in an accident.
You're gonna be okay.
- Back!
- Holy shit! Holy shit!
They will kill you.
Do not speak of this.
Or else you and your parents will die.
Guys, look.
- We shouldn't be here.
- Oh, my God!
- Go!
- Come on!
- Shit! Let's get the hell out of here!
- Holy shit! Run! Shit!
Guys, there are a lot of nails on the ground. Be careful.
Hurry, come on, guys!
Guys, come on!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!
Grab the film!
Guys, come on!
Move your ass! Let's go! Let's go!
- Who's got the bags?
- Get in the car!
Get in!
They're getting closer!
Come on!
- Anybody get their plates?
- I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?
All clear.
Holy shit! That was insane!
- He had a gun! An actual physical gun!
- Oh, shit!
My heart is pounding!
That train could've killed us!
Are you okay?
- Oh, shit! My camera's shattered now.
- No.
Guys, I have never had a teacher aim a gun at me!
It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling!
Guys, keep it down.
"You'll die. Your parents will die. "
Guys, this is not good information!
Oh, shit! The focus ring just fell off!
No one cares about your camera!
Guys, am I the only one shaking?
And I'm also crying!
We can't tell anyone we were there.
My dad can't find out I took his car.
Do you guys hear me?
It's okay.
We're not saying anything to anyone.
Guys!
We're not saying anything, are we?
- No.
- No.
See?
No one's going to know.
No one's saying anything.
Joe.
Thanks.
I never should have done this.
Joe. Joe, wake up.
- Make sure you let Lucy out, all right?
- Okay. I will.
What are you gonna do?
You going to be with Charles today?
Yeah. I'll be with Charles.
All right. I'm heading in.
There's something I got to deal with.
- Don't forget to get the yard.
- I will.
Mom, come on!
No! You are not wearing that.
No one in this house is wearing that.
Oh, really?
Compared to Debbie's, these are long.
Listen to your mother.
So, I can't go to Wendy's party or wear the shorts? Not fair!
Jennifer Anne, "not fair" is Africa.
Mom's racist!
- Do we have any more English muffins?
- Why don't you get up and check.
- Peg, tell the twins to stop.
- I can't, they don't listen.
- Morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Mr. Kaznyk.
Hey, Joe.
Did you hear about the train crash?
- No.
- It's on the news.
...instead opting to use military personnel, which for this reporter only adds to the mystery.
Of course, we'll have much more on this story as it develops.
Coming to you live from Montgomery
County, Channel 14 News...
Can you believe this?
No.
- It's on the news, that means it's real.
- I know.
Local teacher Thomas Woodward is still being treated by Air Force medical personnel after last night's train derailment.
Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pickup truck, which was hit by the speeding train.
- This is gross!
- Well, how about you clean it up?
That would be a great help.
Thanks so much.
...derailment, the largest such accident in Ohio's history.
The condition of Woodward, who has taught at Lillian Middle School for the past six years...
Looks like a disaster movie. Doesn't it?
Oh, my God.
Sit down!
Joe, that's awesome.
- What?
- We can use it. We can film it.
You want to go back?
- Holy shit, that's mint.
- Really?
You're a total brain.
We gotta go get the camera fixed
- and the film developed from last night.
- Okay.
I'm gonna go steal some money from my mom.
If any of the footage is usable from last night, that means we need Alice to play the wife again.
Oh, yeah. I thought she was really good.
Dude, she was mint, but she's never gonna do it.
I think She will.
There's no way.
You heard what she said.
Well, that was before the new scenes, right?
You honestly think she cares about the scenes? She was totally wigged.
Yeah, she was. We all were.
Lens is cracked.
Focus ring broke.
You think it's fixable?
I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.
The camera's busted, man. It's over.
We can use my dad's camera.
- It's got some...
- Hello?
- Hey, Alice. It's Joe Lamb.
- Hi.
So, we have some new scenes for the movie and Charles and I were hoping you'd be in them.
No. No, I'm done with that.
I need this film developed as soon as possible.
Can you do overnight?
Asshole, no one can do overnight.
You want to buy some pot?
No. No, thank you.
Well, what's the fastest you can do?
I can make it a rush.
You'll get your film back in three days.
Hey, what's your sister up to?
The hot one, not the other one.
I don't know.
I'm watching the crash on the news.
- Yeah. I saw it.
- I should go.
Wait. Hold on. Let me come over and I'll bring the scenes...
- No, no. Don't. Don't come...
- I'll be right there. It's a good idea.
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said no on the phone.
You totally did, I know that's true, but...
But now you're at my house.
I am. Which...
I don't understand how you guys can keep working on that stupid movie.
You should go.
What's this?
He was just inviting me to a party.
- Yeah?
- Good morning, Mr. Dainard.
She's not going to your party.
Yes, Sir.
You. Get out of here.
You go home and you don't come back here!
I don't want to see you.
Ally, come inside!
Ally, I'm in the kitchen.
I'll do it.
What?
Cut! That was mint!
Oh, my God. With the train...
So good!
- Joe, reload the cap gun.
- Okay.
We'll shoot another angle next.
Alice, that was mint.
Martin, go a little faster next time.
I'll try, Charles, but I'm still crying about last night, man. I feel like I'm crazy.
Guys, did it really look good?
My death?
- Dude, it looked awesome.
- That was magic.
What do you think happened?
You mean why he crashed the train?
I just got a horrible feeling.
Dude, what are you doing?
That whole thing's an Air Force train.
What?
I make models. Like, plastic ones.
You know, glue them, paint them...
- And he's not embarrassed by that.
- Look who's talking, Math Camp!
Thanks. Can I have a coffee, please?
Cream on the side.
- Sure.
- He's so sophisticated.
- Shut up. I like coffee.
- No one likes coffee.
Air Force trains, even the models, have these hooks...
They do! For when the trains are loaded on the transport ships.
Every car in that crash had hooks.
Joe, would you stop talking about it, all right?
Wait, guys.
Am I the only one who doesn't understand what any of this means?
- Probably, Smartin.
- Cary, shut up.
- You shut up.
- I don't like it when you call me that.
I'm sorry, Smartin.
Let's just go cry about it.
Dr. Woodward had that map.
He drove onto the train tracks.
Maybe there was something he wanted to...
- To destroy, yeah!
- My God, will you guys just shut up?
Maybe he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself.
That's a dumb idea.
He had a gun. Why not use that?
There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide. Pills, hanging...
Pussy! Stop taking the fries away.
- I ordered these for a reason.
- Excuse me.
Could we get another order of fries?
Because my friend here is fat.
Funny, chompers. At least I don't have to use a booster seat.
You could jump from a building.
- Or fall down some stairs.
- Well, that's not really effective.
If it's the Air Force, what would the Air Force have on the train?
Jesus, shut up about it.
You heard what Old Man Woodward said, we can't talk about this.
Joe, seriously.
Do you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too?
All right, easy, easy!
- It's loaded. Move out.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, Deputy. I'm told this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion.
Well, as you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened, as well as how to help you.
It's all under control.
It'll be a very fast clean-up.
Colonel, there isn't anything that I should know, is there?
Not that I can think of, Deputy.
I understand you have concerns about our cargo.
Well, I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
Well, that's not gonna be possible.
Colonel, I've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna wanna know what's taking place.
Which town is that?
Lillian.
Deputy, if you're asking me if we had any dangerous properly on board this train,
I can assure you the answer is "No. "
Colonel!
Excuse me.
They gave me the runaround for two hours before they allowed me to talk to anyone.
I'd say they've had their hands full, Jack.
Nelec, the Colonel, refused to show me the manifest.
He told me they're carrying mostly airplane parts. I don't buy that.
It's Air Force, Jack.
Airplane parts sort of make sense.
Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's something else going on.
They're taking molds of tire tracks.
Why would they be doing that?
Who would they be looking for?
And they're packaging these weird little cubes into these crates.
Weird little cubes?
Yeah, they're loading them onto these red trucks. There are dozens of them.
Sheriff, I think you need to go check it out.
And I think you need to take a break.
Jack, I've been telling you this since Elizabeth.
You're a good deputy, but you need to take a vacation.
Go home. Take off the uniform.
Go fishing. Give your son a hug.
Hey, Breen, I'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio.
Breen!
Hey, Sheriff.
What's that?
Walkman. It's like a stereo.
Play your own cassette tapes.
You want to try?
I don't think so.
Kids walking around with their own stereos, just what we need.
It's a slippery slope, my friend.
Yes, Sir.
Sheriff?
Sheriff?
You know, in scene... Where is it?
Where'd you learn to do this?
Mostly the Dick Smith
Monster Make-up Handbook.
Hey, Joe. We need some more footage of the train crash.
Obviously.
You know that train model you just made?
- Your cargo train.
- I want to blow it up and film it.
Let me blow it up.
Yeah. Sure.
- Mint!
- Gnarly! Yes!
Here, take this, will you?
It's fine. They can blow it up.
I don't care.
You want to see it? The train?
My train model? The train I made?
Dude, that's bitching.
Dude, that's like the third time it's happened.
What the hell?
So how am I supposed to be a zombie?
Pretty much just be a lifeless ghoul, with no soul. Dead eyes.
Scary. Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
- For English? Yeah.
- Yeah.
Kind of like her, but hungry for human flesh.
Like she wants to turn somebody into a zombie.
'Cause that's Kind of what zombies do.
Oh, my God, yeah. That's really good.
Not bad.
- Really?
- Really.
Careful! There was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel I lost.
You don't seem to be asking very many questions.
Give the man some time, Mr. Blakely.
- He's only a deputy, he's not the Sheriff.
- Doesn't matter.
I think this is most likely a bear attack.
Security cameras showed nothing.
Someone had erased...
Vicky, you heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?
Negative. Still no word.
Vicky, you need to have Dayton send a C.S. Unit out to Edie's, and you put an A.P.B. Out on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell, and send units over to their houses immediately. You copy all that?
Copy. And, Jack, we 're getting a lot of unusual calls.
What kinds of unusual calls?
I've never seen this kind of thing before.
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do?
The insurance company guy thought I was joking with him.
Look at my Bonneville over here!
They'd have to have a winch to take that out.
You been having any troubles with anyone lately, Izzy?
Well, I was thinking you should talk to Louis Dainard.
Yeah. I didn't help him out with financing last year, and I wouldn't be surprised if this was some sort of sick retribution.
- My generator is missing.
- The phones aren't working.
- My dog's gone. Disappeared.
- The phones won't produce a signal.
Call the station and file a report.
I'll have someone come out and take care of each one of you. Okay?
Lucy!
Lucy!
I got four guys on this case...
People don't feel safe around here.
You know why? Because they're not.
We need to get the National Guard...
Air Force hasn't answered a damn question.
They've got trucks over at
Woodward's house.
Now, Ben heard they were looking for Woodward's research.
Research? What the hell?
...shotgun in one of those trucks, he had, like, a scanner in his hand.
Like a Geiger counter.
They're saying it's just clean up at the crash site, too, but they're taking molds of tire tracks.
That means they're looking for someone. Now what does that mean?
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?
No. I'm sure she's around somewhere.
I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there.
I ate those.
- Sorry, kid.
- Yeah, no problem. I'll find something.
- Hey!
- You got to be kidding.
Pick that up, will you?
Hey, Vicky, you got power down at the station?
On and off
And Brook County's in the dark.
Do me a favor and get Water & Power out there right now, will you?
So, the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad's car.
They're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over.
I don't want to hear about it.
This is what I've been talking about.
They could be monitoring us right now.
Jesus, shut up. Over.
And the military is at Woodward's house looking for his research.
Whatever that means.
You cannot flake out on me and be a dick.
Are you gonna come and help me tomorrow or not?
I need you to make Alice a zombie again.
Okay. I'll do the make-up.
Oven
The cables are gone-
All the poles are empty.
Same thing over here in Rose Hill.
Somebody took the damn wires down.
Holy shit!
Hey, Rooney, you got anything in Lillian?
Hey, Rooney, you copy?
We got a half mile of copper missing.
Lines are back up at M-38.
Truck 14, Rooney's out at the junkyard.
I'll give you an update when I hear back.
I wanna know who took them.
Twenty microwaves gone from my inventory.
Everywhere you look, things are going missing.
We've got trains crashing, people vanishing.
Belmont County's without power.
You know what this feels like to me?
This feels like a Russian invasion.
Debbie, I don't think that the Russians have anything to do with what's going on in town.
But I am calling the curfew because of these exact concerns.
Unless you can tell me who's been messing around with our stuff,
I say it's the Soviets.
I like you, Jack, but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
We've got good people working on that.
Mr. McCandless.
Since Wednesday morning, my ham radio is a mess!
Some frequencies which I like to scan,
I'm hearing military chatter, but it's distorted.
And I don't know what it is.
Have you heard that?
Mr. McCandless, can I have a word with you in private, please?
It was like having my radio hijacked.
I'm sure that must be very annoying.
You don't know those frequencies offhand, do you?
Sure I do. 13-2-0-1...
Patty, why don't you get in touch with Vicky.
Hey, Dave, you seen Milner?
No, sir. I haven't.
Jack, there's a huge sinkhole by my garage!
- It sunk almost a foot!
- I'll take care of that.
Hey, Tom. Tom! You seen Milner?
Have you tried his office?
Have I tried his office?
What are you gonna do about the power? It's been out for two days.
Hey, Rosko.
Rosko. I need you to get every radio we have and you tune them to those frequencies.
- Understand?
- No.
- Hey, Milner.
- Yeah.
Don't you have a radio scanner with a descrambler?
- A voice inverter, yeah, at home.
- Whatever. Get it.
Bring it down here and set it up for me.
Would you please?
- Sure thing.
- Jack, what is this?
I think the Air Force is using unassigned channels...
Hey. He was at my house yesterday morning. You aware of that?
We brought him in for the car lot and other stuff. He's clean.
Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd inform your son that my house is off-limits.
And so is my daughter.
I think the make-up was better yesterday.
No, it's good.
I think it looks good.
I should've cleaned up my room.
Did you make all these models?
Yeah. That one is the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
We watched that one on TV.
This is the train they want to destroy.
Looks real.
It looks so old.
Yeah, that's dry brush technique.
It's when there's a coat of paint and then you put something like Euro Gray over it.
Euro Gray?
Oh, my God, there's like
14 different grays. It gets crazy.
What was that necklace?
The one you were holding at the train crash.
Was it your mom's?
My dad gave it to her the day I was born.
She wears it all the time.
Well, used to.
And...
It was bad how she died and...
But my dad got it back.
Guys, what the hell?
No one knew where you were!
We're here.
- You got to play the soldier.
- I thought you were calling Evan.
Evan blew us off. He's a pussy!
Excuse me.
It's okay.
You got to do it. You're the only one.
Well, what the hell you mean they found my dog in Brookville?
That's another county over!
Lucy. That's where she is.
I mean, we've got nearly 30 calls from people who found local dogs, but the thing is the calls coming in aren't local.
It's like they all just ran away in every direction.
This isn't like her, she just doesn't disappear.
Okay, okay, calm down.
Just tell me what she looks like.
She's got dark hair. It was in rollers.
Do you know what rollers are?
- Yes, I know what rollers are.
- Okay, so...
Hang on.
Negative, unable to recover data.
That's definitely Air Force.
Yeah, it's Air Force, but what does it mean?
What are they doing transmitting on these frequencies?
- Maybe it's not even Air Force.
- I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.
- Five bucks?
- Yeah.
We're gonna need units to prepare for
Operation Walking Distance.
What did he say? "Operation" what?
"Walking Distance. "
What's this?
He worked at Romero Chemical.
Found out some things the company was doing.
And after what you told me last night at the bar, I thought you should know.
Are we gonna get in trouble for being here?
Production value.
Stop talking about production value.
I think the Air Force is gonna kill us.
- Cary.
- Don't cover my mouth!
We just made this discovery today.
You understand this is top secret?
Of course.
I would never have given you this information unless we had worked together in Vietnam.
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
Understood.
- You're a good friend.
- You, too.
Nothing so far.
- How much more is there?
- About 60 more boxes in the basement.
What, more tax returns?
It's here somewhere. We'll find it. If not,
Woodward will tell us where it is.
What the hell is that?
Joe.
Hey, Mr. Lamb.
Get in the car.
Mr. Lamb, that's your camera, but, technically, that's my film.
What the hell?
Is it me?
I would like to help you out, Deputy,
I really would, but we operate on a need-to-know basis.
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?
We will be out of your way shortly.
All right, then I'm sure you won't mind me contacting D.C.
Talk to some friends about
"Walking Distance. "
All right, we'll do it that way.
Deputy! Let's talk.
Just not here.
This is new, all of this, for the both of us.
Dealing with anything. Just us.
So, I'm gonna make this as simple and as clear as I can.
You're not friends with Alice Dainard.
When I say "No," I don't mean "Maybe. "
I don't mean "Yes. "
I mean "No. "
I've known Louis Dainard for a lot of years. He's been nothing but trouble.
Your mother used to say he's not such a bad guy.
He just needs a chance, that he was sad.
Well, I tried to be good to him.
And I can't, not anymore.
I will not allow him or his daughter in this house.
I will not allow you to spend time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you do. That's it.
I hope we're clear on that.
We're not clear.
What'd you say?
We're not clear.
You and I aren't clear about anything.
We couldn't be less clear.
Just because Mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me. You don't.
You don't know anything about
Alice, either. She's kind.
We're not gonna have this discussion right now.
- She's nice to me!
- I don't care what she is!
Her father is an irresponsible, selfish son of a bitch.
You listen to me.
I've got 12,000 people in this town who are scared out of their mind.
They've got one person to rely on.
It used to be someone else, but now it's just me.
Move, move!
Let's go. Move!
Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car
I'm here to see Colonel Nelec!
He told me to meet him here.
You're under military arrest.
Drop your weapons.
Where's Nelec?
I don't want any more trouble, do you?
We've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence.
What you knew. How you knew it.
Who else might know.
I remember you in the lab.
And I recall we didn't always see eye to eye, but that is no excuse for doing what you did here.
So, in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, why don't you just tell me where you put your research and who else knows about it.
I know you had someone document the crash that night.
Tell me who that was and I will help you.
I swear to God on my mother's life, if you help us now, we will take care of you.
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
- when you take care of people.
- It is mine.
He is mine.
I'm gonna bait him and catch him.
He's in me, you know.
As I am in him.
So, when you see him next, as I'm sure you will,
I'll be watching you, too.
Are you... Were you sleeping?
Before. Earlier. No.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You want to come in?
Yeah.
Power's still out.
Room's still messy.
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking.
I wanted to tell you something before tomorrow.
Don't let Charles blow up your train.
I don't think it's right.
I know he's your friend.
He's so bossy.
But I've known him since kindergarten.
He's really nice.
He shouldn't always get what he wants.
I mean, who always gets what they want?
I know I don't know you at all.
Even though it sort of feels like I do.
Do you not feel like that?
No. No, I totally do.
I'm just kind of in shock at this entire conversation.
Power's back.
No, no. Keep it.
It's... it's so weird.
Watching her like this.
Like she's still here.
She used to look at me this way, like really look, and I just knew I was there, that I existed.
He drank that morning.
My dad.
He missed his shift.
Your mom took it for him, the day of the accident.
He...
He...
He... He wishes...
I know he wishes it was him instead of her.
And sometimes I do, too.
Don't say that.
He's your dad.
Is... Is this normal?
No. This is new.
Want to tell me where you were?
Or should I tell you?
Sit down.
I should go to bed.
I want to talk to you. I said sit down.
I don't want to sit down!
Then go.
Be just like your mother and leave.
Dad...
Go ahead! Go!
Go!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Wait!
Ally, I'm sorry!
Alice!
Ally!
Alice!
Ally!
Ally!
Firelight at 0500 hours.
Operation Walking Distance is in effect.
T- minus four hours to evacuation.
Evacuation in T-minus four hours.
Why are you not reacting?
That thing went through my wall!
I told you not to pick it up in the first place.
What are you so angry about? That I'm not gonna let you blow up my train?
That's part of it. Just a part.
Hey. Tell your sister that Donny from Olsen's broke up with Karen.
That shit ended about a week ago.
What's your problem?
My whole movie's a disaster because of you.
- I know my dad's being a turkey.
- Whatever.
- We're still gonna finish your movie.
- It's not about the movie.
What are you talking about?
Of course it is!
Just forget it.
Why? There's nothing wrong!
We're gonna finish the movie!
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.
We can still make the festival.
- It's not about the movie.
- Then what is it about?
Jesus, you don't get it, do you?
It's obvious.
- What's obvious?
- God, you're a dumbass.
That night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
- What? What are you talking about?
- Like Mr. Attitude, all of a sudden.
Your movie was over!
That's what you said! You were upset!
- Oh, my God.
- I gave you a camera! I helped you!
Don't pretend like you did this for me.
You didn't do this for me, and you know it.
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice!
Action!
I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it's safer if you leave town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
This case- These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do...
Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie.
Not so you could fall in love with her.
What do you care what I think about Alice anyway?
Because I like her!
That's why I asked her to do this thing in the first place, so I could get to know her. Not you!
- You like Alice Dainard?
- You're such an idiot!
- Watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...
- Oh, my God! Shit!
- Run!
Shit. Look at all that smoke.
I can't use this.
You won't even let me blow up your train.
Everything's bogus.
We could make another train and blow that one up.
I do like her.
- Sorry about that.
- Shut up.
It's okay.
That's not even what bothers me.
She likes you, too.
That's what really bothers me.
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?
I haven't leaned out yet and the doctor says it's gonna happen.
I don't know. Everything's just so bogus.
Charles.
Joe, what the hell?
What is that?
What is that?
- Mr. Harkin! What's going on?
- Evacuation! The fire!
Wait, wait!
The county is being evacuated due to a wildfire that is raging out of control, and threatening to reach the Lillian chemical plant.
Please take with you essential items only.
If you are driving your own vehicle, follow the Cara van to the evacuation center:
Please remain calm.
File in.
File in, please, file in.
- Corporal.
- I left the medication my wife needs.
Sir, the town is sealed off.
No one's allowed in.
- H through N.
- I can't get it anywhere else.
Charles!
Excuse me.
Charles, oh, thank God.
I went back to the house and you were gone.
Yeah, they put us on the bus.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey. I'm gonna find my dad.
- You gonna tell him about that huge...
- Yes.
Come back if you can't find him!
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb.
I know you don't like me and I'm sorry about that, but I'm looking for my dad.
It took her.
- It took Alice.
- What?
I saw it. It was big.
And, I don't know, it was something
I've never... I've never...
No one believes me.
They just keep giving me pills and...
No one believes me.
I believe you.
That thing took her?
We have to go back to town to find Alice, to find her. Come on, guys.
- Dude, she's dead. Alice is dead...
- Don't say that!
First of all, I want to live. Okay?
Joe, what do you actually expect to do, man?
The town's closed.
We're not allowed to go back.
Look, I have an idea.
I'm going whether or not you come, which I really hope you do.
Come on, guys.
I have six tons of explosives in this thing.
Let's find that thing and blow it to shit!
As if I'm gonna help you.
Do this for me,
I'll babysit the twins next week, so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.
I'm not shitting you.
You can't ask me any questions, though, and you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious. Nobody.
Does it have to be him?
Yes or no, you ugly freak!
I'm about to rescind the offer.
This whole evacuation thing's really freaking me out.
Making me rethink my priorities.
Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back.
We... We totally could.
I asked Charles about you and he said you're a great guy.
I totally am.
Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor?
So, there are rules to being in my car, okay?
Where the hell are we going, anyway?
We're going to go to the school and open the trailer
Woodward has in the parking lot.
I bet that...
I bet that's where he's keeping his research.
Research. What research?
We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing, so that we can find it and that's how we're gonna save Alice.
Come on. Let's go!
Dorks, no shoes on my upholstery.
And no one touches my C.B.
- You got it?
- The dungeon? Are you serious?
Why else are there six padlocks on the door?
We're going to the school.
Since when did this one become so bossy?
I don't know.
I got to take a leak! What am
I supposed to do, piss in here?
Thanks for the hospitality.
Am I gonna go in alone, or are you gonna end up coming with...
...driving your own vehicle, follow the Cara van to the evacuation center:
If the Air Force has already searched
Woodward's house, wouldn't they have searched stuff in the schoolroom, too?
Yeah, man, I was just thinking about that, too.
Maybe his room, but not the dungeon.
Woodward keeps all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
Shut up!
So, what kind of music does she like, your sister?
I don't care. Disco, I guess.
I can get back into disco.
We shouldn't take River Road, they put a roadblock up.
Dork, I saw it. Observe.
So, what, I just wait here like a douche?
Yes. Thank you so much for doing this.
Do you have a tire iron?
Joe, let me try! Joe, let me try!
God, I hope my Electronic Football is in there.
Joe, this is impossible, man.
There's no way we can do this.
These things are made like a bank vault, like a safe.
Professional robbers can't even get in through these things. They're so...
Shit!
I loosened it for you.
- Guys.
- Look at all this junk!
He's got movies in here.
I can't believe we're breaking into the school!
Who does that? Nobody does that!
Idiots do that!
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellie Air Force Base in 1963 because of
"subversive conduct," whatever that is.
Charles, check it out.
It's Old Man Woodward.
Back when he was like
Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
He's been tracking this thing since 1958.
What is this?
It says, "April 8th, 1963 incident. "
I don't know.
- Cary!
- What?
We have to find this thing. Come on!
Okay. Sorry.
...told them that this creature is more sophisticated than any of us, that his species is predominantly subterranean.
- Subterranean.
- And that he is being treated without compassion or respect.
I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship, a craft made up of those cubes, a complex shape-shifting alloy.
Remarkable material that we'll never fully understand.
He has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in '58-
But instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner
- Guys, it's Dr. Woodward!
- He's been restrained and experimented upon, biopsied, and tortured by Nelec.
Through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all.
We have turned him into an enemy.
I told them I knew these things because he made Contact with me, that he makes a psychic connection by touch.
Oh, my God!
- What is that thing?
- What the hell?
- I can't watch this.
- Martin, you're gonna throw up, man.
The moment we made contact,
I understood him, and he me.
What I know is that if we don't change this and begin helping him, we will all pay the price.
But Nelec won't listen.
He wasn't trying to kill it.
He'll have me discharged.
He was trying to help it escape.
But I won't give up.
I will do everything in my power
- to set him free.
- Oh, my God.
- You guys hear that?
- Help him rebuild that ship. I won't...
Freeze! Nobody move!
Do not move!
We got positive I.D. Here.
It's just a bunch of kids.
Oh, Shit.
Search them.
Let me see that.
I rolled those M-80s myself.
- That's right.
- Jesus, Cary, shut up.
You're the Deputy's boy.
No.
Move out!
Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit.
Breaker, breaker.
Requesting police backup.
Breaker 1-9. Is this the police channel?
- Staff Sergeant.
- Hi. How are you doing?
Hey, Mr. Lamb!
Rosko.
Hey. Where the hell have you been?
- What are you wearing?
- Come here.
The Air Force set that fire. They want the town empty for some reason.
This whole operation, this whole military operation, the evacuation, everything, it's all bad.
- We need to find...
- Did you hear about Joe?
Look, dispatch just got a call on citizens' band.
Joe and some of his friends, they were grabbed by military personnel at the middle school.
Preston, you tell me everything, and I won't throw you in jail.
Yes, sir.
But I think you should look at this first.
Chief Master Sergeant,
Dustoff-03 is 20 minutes out.
Roger that. Perimeter secure. Standing by on lookout. Prepare to engage.
Teams Kilo-Lima-Mike-November in position.
Teams Oscar-Foxtrot-Quebec-Romeo in position.
Cocked and locked. Ready to go.
What's going to happen to us?
I think we're gonna die.
Cary, shut up, man.
They wouldn't do that.
I'm not kidding.
I think they're gonna kill us.
They're not gonna kill us.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because we're just...
Hold on!
Hold on!
Was that that thing from the train?
Why are we stopping?
- Why are we stopped?
- Holy shit!
Contact with precious cargo, three clicks from city center.
Currently heading towards...
- Driver! Can you see anything up there?
- No, sir! Nothing.
What's that gun?
Sako Bolt Action thirty-aught six with...
Okay, we get it.
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.
Here. Tag it.
Yes, Sir.
Open the door!
I don't feel good about this.
Sir, is there a particular area that you'd want me to shoot...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Help!
Oh, my God!
Get us out of here now!
What other firepower do we have?
- There's a monster out there, Joe!
- What the hell is it?
I got it, sir!
- Guys, the seat belt is killing me!
- Unhook it!
Come on!
Come on!
This is Nelec. Use the big guns.
Whatever happens to me, do not let it...
- Joe, open it!
- Open the door!
- It's bolted!
- I want to go home so bad!
Open the door.
- Please, sir.
- Just let us out!
Please open it!
Where are the keys?
Overmyer had them!
Help me! My leg's stuck!
Please, sir, open the door!
Please, open the door!
Another one dead!
Guys, there's broken glass.
Guys!
Martin! Martin!
Let me get on your shoulders. Come on.
Go, go, get up!
- Here we go.
- Go!
- Come on, Joe! You can do it!
- Come on, Joe!
- You can do it, Joe! Let's go.
- Come on!
- Come on!
- You can do it! Come on!
Joe, please! Go!
- Come on. Break the glass, you pussy!
- Come on, Joe! Hit it! Come on!
We got to go!
- Go!
- Come on, guys, hurry!
Come with us. We got some questions for you. Come on.
- Oh, no. Is she dead?
- Just come with us.
Hey, fellows,
I've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally deliver this man back to base.
- He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
- Let's go.
What are you doing?
Where are we going?
To find our kids.
Hey, guys! Guys, I found them!
Hey, guys! I found my firecrackers!
Congratulations.
Let's go, guys, they're coming back.
I think we should go. Come on.
Guys, come on.
No. No, look.
You dorks are alive? I thought that...
What the fuck?
Donny. Donny.
We need a ride into town.
Okay, but just so you know,
I'm massively stoned right now.
Do you want me to drive?
- Guys, what was that?
- It sounds like gunshots.
- Joe, where are we going?
- I saw something in the cemetery.
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.
What the hell is that?
Move the damn car!
- God!
- Joe, turn the car around!
- I can't. There's a tank behind us.
- Holy shit!
- What are they shooting at?
- Guys, we have to run.
Donny! Hey, Donny, wake up!
- He's too stoned!
- Drugs are so bad!
- Why is everyone firing?
- We gotta go!
Guys, come on, hurry!
- This is crazy!
- What is going on?
Look! It just exploded!
Sir! The weapons are misfiring!
All of them!
Surface-to-air! Radar!
It's a mess out here, sir!
Guys! Guys, run!
Come on!
What the hell is this?
Go, Cary, go!
- Jesus!
- Go!
What the hell?
Holy shit!
Why is everyone firing?
Go, come on!
Move ahead!
Oh, my God!
Come on, guys, move!
Did you guys see those explosions?
They were... They were huge!
Oh, my God.
Whose house is this?
It's Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
Kathy? Yeah, I know her.
Charles, what are you thinking, dude?
That's not yours!
What, I'm thirsty. I'm in a war zone!
- Clear! Clear!
- Come on, move!
Let's go, move out!
- Guys, come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?
To the cemetery. I'm...
Guys, what happened to my leg?
Man, it hurts!
Holy shit, Martin, you've got a bone sticking out of your leg!
Joe, give me that thing off the curtains!
God!
I've got to go find Alice.
You guys stay here with Martin.
You gonna be okay without me?
Yeah.
- I'm not staying with the girls!
- God, Cary! Shut up!
- Calm down!
- Come on! Come on!
It hurts, Joe!
Okay, this is going to hurt really bad, okay?
Jesus, Martin, I haven't done it yet!
Just... Just follow me. Just follow me.
I've been following you for the last five blocks! What are we doing here?
Come on, through these doors.
Help me.
- Help you with what?
- We have to get inside.
Okay, okay. For what?
I'll tell you in a second.
Why is there dirt in these windows?
It's here. Hard on three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
This... This is scary.
You got any sparklers in there?
Are you kidding me?
Alice is down there.
I came to your house that day to tell you that
I never meant to hurt anyone.
I swear to God.
I'm sorry, Jack.
About what happened to your wife.
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
Joe, I don't understand...
This way.
Why are you so surprised?
I always wear lipstick on my shirt.
- It's Sheriff Pruitt!
- I know.
Cary, look.
There are bodies everywhere.
- What is this?
- We're under the water tower. Look.
She's got to be here.
She's got to be here.
It's eating a person.
She's here.
Oh, my God. I see her.
Okay.
We're going to use your firecrackers.
I don't think that's gonna hurt him, Joe.
- There's other tunnels.
- So?
I need you to make noise right here in two minutes.
Make it loud and make it last.
Give me some sparklers.
Make sure you're gone when it blows.
You can't be here. You got to run.
Where are you going?
Come on, Cary.
Alice. Alice. Please, we have to go.
Come on.
Alice! Alice!
Please, come on.
We have to go. Alice!
You're alive! You're alive.
You're alive. Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
What is this? What are you doing here?
I'm just doing the best I can to save you.
How did you know?
Your dad. He told me. He was worried.
And flipping out.
- Really?
- We have to move.
Excuse me?
Where are we?
I left my bag in the car, and then I went out to the car to get my bag...
It's been locked up for years.
It's terrified and hungry and it just wants to go home.
When it touched me, I knew.
I need you to help me get the Sheriff down.
Follow me this way.
I'll get us out of here.
- Sheriff, we came that way.
- Don't argue with me! Just follow me!
Come on, kids, let's go with the Sheriff.
This way.
Joe!
I told you to get out!
What are you doing here?
I thought this was the way out.
Okay, I tried.
- Hey, Alice, welcome back.
- Hey!
Come on! We got to get out of here...
Guys, hurry!
Come on, go!
She's gone! It took her!
I don't want to be next!
- Go! You don't want to be here! Go!
- Joe, what are you doing?
Ally, what the hell is he doing?
We understand!
But not everyone's horrible.
- No!
- Joe!
Let him down!
I know bad things happen.
Bad things happen.
But you can still live.
You can still live.
Okay, wait a minute.
What?
- Look out!
- Get down! Get down!
What is he doing?
He's making a model.
I got you.
I got you.
Holy shit!
This is where my friend was attacked.
- By who?
- I've never seen him before.
He looked pale, crazy. He bit my friend.
- Then what happened?
- He was dead.
- And then...
- He got up and walked away?
- How did you know?
- Anything left behind?
Yes, this fell out of the pocket of the attacker's pocket.
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. President.
I'm Detective Hathaway.
I'm here to discuss some urgent matters regarding your chemical factory.
Are you referring to the recent incidents?
Yes, I believe I am.
Tell the chairman I'll call him back.
You have three minutes.
You want to tell me about those employees?
I was sorry to hear of their unfortunate accident.
That was no accident!
Did you see the bites on their neck?
Are you suggesting some connection between my chemical company and those, those...
Those were zombie attacks!
Romero Chemical has nothing to do with any such thing.
Then what happens in Building 47?
You wouldn't mind if I took a look around, would you?
Of course not.
Good day to you, Mr. President.
Good day, Detective.
He knows.
Judith. It's me, your boss.
I need you to buy my wife a ticket to Michigan.
It's too dangerous for her here.
I just love her so much.
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.
Well, what am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
Sweetheart, this is my job.
I just love you so much!
I love you, too.
I can't believe we weren't killed last night.
Okay, now you have to leave town.
No. I'm staying here with you.
I don't know what I would do if something happened to you.
What if there are survivors down there?
There were no survivors!
Did you see that crash?
Excuse me, sir, were you in the wreck?
That settles it. I'm not going anywhere.
It's been two weeks, and the murders continue.
This investigation is like no other.
It's putting too much stress on this town and on my marriage.
Could zombies be real?
Hello? This is Detective Hathaway.
I'll be right over.
- What's happening here?
- A military police investigation.
It was a suicide.
- A suicide? Who was it?
- A former Air Force officer.
Said there was a secret he couldn't keep any longer.
It says he worked for Dr. Peter Braken?
I never would have given you this information if we hadn't served together in Vietnam.
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Doctor.
- Detective.
I'm here to discuss your involvement with Romero Chemical?
I was the one that developed the special compound to turn all these humans into zombies.
It was supposed to be used as a military weapon, but it got out of hand.
So I made this antidote that will hopefully cure all of the zombies.
That's incredible!
How much have you made?
Just this one.
Would you like to help me test it on this innocent victim of my creation?
Honey, I'm home!
Good news. We found a cure for the zombie infection.
Honey?
Sorry. It didn't work. I wish it worked.
I tried. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
John?
This has been a Charles Kaznyk production.
We had such a fun time filming this movie, The Case.
So much fun that I hope you pick it for the Cleveland International
Super 8 Film Festival.
God!
THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU
Let's welcome our favorite alumnus, and the next senator from the state of New York,
David Norris!
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, hi, there.
My name is David Norris, and I'd like to be the next senator from the great state of New York.
Look at you. What's your name?
I'm going to go through Yonkers, door to door
- and take the city that way.
- We love you.
The recent endorsement by the fire fighter's union is another boost to Norris who already had a six-point lead over his opponent, Roger Linfield.
Whenever I see you on C-Span, and you stand,
I always think you're about to go, "Chug!"
Congressman, you certainly started your career off, eight years ago, with a bang or should I say, a bust.
For the last eight years,
David Norris has represented Brooklyn,
New York City and America.
This is my campaign chairman,
Charlie Traynor.
These are voters.
Latest polls have you up 10 points.
We're 10 points up?
This is not going to be easy getting there.
I have some real opposition, and what they're saying about me is that I'm too young to hold this office.
Win big, but run like you're 20 down.
Okay, you got it.
Thank you, Gary.
But that's okay because these are the same people who say that young people don't vote, young people don't care about politics, but I'm here to tell you, your future is about your choices, not theirs.
So, today I'd like to put them on notice because come November,
I want them to know that it was young people like you, who kicked their asses.
David! David!
Thank you.
Charlie.
What's wrong?
Yeah?
Any ideas?
I'm working on it.
Keep me posted.
Yeah.
David Norris, until recently, he was way ahead in the polls.
Mary Matalin and
James Carville are here.
Mary, this is a surprise.
It is a surprise.
Such political promise.
This compelling story, he grew up in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.
He overcame the loss of his entire family, his mom and his brother when he was 10, his father before he got to high school, he got over that.
He had such promise.
And he was the youngest person ever elected to the
House of Representatives.
Yeah, he was elected when he was actually 24, but he gets in a bar room fight the night that he's elected.
I like this, all right.
Then you have this photo coming out of the New York Post.
I think the accretion of this stuff was just too much for the voters.
It reeked of some level of immaturity here, of impulsiveness.
People want maturity, they want adults in Congress.
Big night for us, gentlemen.
Everybody ready?
You look exhausted.
You should take a vacation when all this is finished.
You've earned it.
I'm not sure the kind of tired I am can be fixed by a vacation.
Everybody needs a vacation, even us.
All right, let's get him back on track.
Mary, over the past couple of weeks since the photo came out, they thought people...
Why are you still watching CNN?
That it wasn't such a big deal, but clearly it was.
They called this way too early. Come on.
Put on your pretty little tie and let's go.
Suffolk County numbers,
Linfield, 415,120. Norris...
Wow.
I really thought we'd win Suffolk.
Kings County just came in, too.
Well...
I didn't win Brooklyn.
It's going to be a blow out.
NBC has us up next.
I'm going to go work on my speech.
David...
David. Hey!
I'm sorry I wasted your time, Charlie.
NBC news is now calling the election for Roger Linfield.
After a shockingly poor showing at both Suffolk County, and his home county, Kings, it now appears David Norris will lose this election badly.
Hello?
Hello?
I grew up in Red Hook, and I don't want to surprise anybody, but I got into a few fistfights along the way.
It's not whether or not you get knocked down, it's what you do when you get back up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here tonight to tell you
I will get back up.
But tonight is not about me.
It is about coming together and welcoming the newest senator for the great state of New York,
Roger Linfield.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit.
Hello?
- It's the men's.
- Yep.
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I just didn't know what to do.
I heard you come in and say, "Hello," and I probably should have said, "Hi," but then I thought that would be weird because it's the men's.
Then you started talking to yourself and it was obviously very personal.
So I was stuck in no man's land, and then it all got to be too much, so I came out.
What are you doing in here?
Just...
I'm hiding from security.
Why?
I crashed a wedding upstairs.
People still do that?
It was a dare.
Who dared you to crash a wedding?
Me.
Oh.
I crashed a wedding once.
- Did you?
- Yeah, in high school.
Oh.
But I got caught.
I spent the night in jail.
I think that happened more than once from what I heard.
You're that guy running for Senate, aren't you?
Yeah, I am that guy.
And judging from your speech, you're not winning?
No.
Oh. That's too bad, the other guy is such a tool.
He is a tool.
I wish I could have made that clearer in the campaign ads.
Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal.
The Post did not have to run the photo.
At least not a full page.
God, no.
It was my favorite moment of your whole campaign.
Really? I could have used you on my team a couple of months ago.
I could help poll test every word that comes out of your mouth before you say it.
Oh, you like politicians?
I like it when they do stuff I can relate to.
- Like pull their pants down?
- I love that.
See, that kind of candidate wouldn't even get elected to the student council.
My guy would know how to tie his own tie.
It's a clip-on.
Oh, I wish.
That would have been my other favorite moment of your campaign.
Do you still have a chance?
Is it over?
He crushed me.
Sorry.
Well, losing has its advantages.
Like what?
For one thing, as a politician, you're never really alone unless you're asleep, or in the bathroom usually.
That gets old.
Really?
Yeah, I guess I'm mostly just looking forward to having some time by myself.
I don't buy it. I think you love it.
Do I know you?
I guess I could have been more convincing.
Okay.
You don't have to worry about being convincing till the next election.
Are you a registered New York voter?
Do I sound like I am?
Holy shit.
David.
Oh. Wow, sorry, guys.
- Sorry.
- I got to go.
Sorry.
- Wow.
- Hang on.
- You going to give your speech?
- Hang on.
Hey!
Hey.
Ma'am.
I got to go.
Ma'am?
That is so much better.
She's on the move.
Southwest staircase.
Excuse me? Ma'am.
What was that?
I don't know.
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.
All right, go do the speech. Come on.
Congressman David Norris.
I grew up not far away from here, in Red Hook.
- Brooklyn!
- I love you, David!
I love you more!
I love you both.
But we had a rule in my neighborhood.
When you got in a fight, it wasn't whether or not you got knocked down, it's what you do when you get back up.
And I came here to tell you tonight, that I will get back up.
It's bullshit.
We didn't have that saying in my neighborhood.
It's just one of those phrases that had some traction with the focus group and so we kept using it, but it's not true.
In 1998, I did a cover story for GQ.
The title was
"Youngest Congressman Ever."
And since then, every story has tried to explain how I got here so fast.
And the word that people kept using was "authentic."
But here's the problem.
This isn't even my tie.
- Go get Jim for me.
- This tie was selected for me by a group of specialists in Tenafly, New Jersey who chose it over
56 other ties we tested.
In fact, our data suggests that I have to stick to either a tie that is red or a tie that is blue.
A yellow tie made it look as if I was taking my situation lightly, and I may in fact, pull my pants down again at any moment.
A silver tie meant that
I'd forgotten my roots.
My shoes...
You know, shiny shoes, we associate with high-priced lawyers and bankers.
If you want to get a working man's vote, you need to scuff up your shoes a little bit.
But you can't scuff them up so much that you alienate the lawyers and the bankers because you need them to pay for the specialists back in Tenafly.
So, what is the proper scuffing amount?
Do you know we actually paid a consultant $7,300...
Was it $7,300, Charlie?
Nice. What an asshole.
$7,300, for a consultant to tell us that this is the perfect amount of scuffing.
He has to spill his coffee on his shirt by 7:05.
7:05 at the latest.
I'll get him as soon as he enters the park.
Can't imagine being on this guy as long as you have.
...for energy efficient technologies.
RSR Venture Capital announced yesterday that former Congressman David Norris, would become a senior partner.
Norris led an unsuccessful bid for Senate last month.
But his concession speech was considered, by many, to be electrifying and has made him the obvious front runner in the 2010 Senate race.
Investment banker
Charles Traynor founded RSR, one of the country's most successful venture capital firms.
Traynor is a childhood friend of Norris' and was the Chairman of his Senate campaign.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Tom Frankel from The Journal is calling you in five minutes.
I just gave him this number.
Give him 3-2-2-7.
I'm not used to this phone yet.
No, I can't. He's going to ask you about joining the firm.
All business calls have to be done on a company Blackberry.
- Really?
- Sarbanes-Oxley, you voted for it, pal.
In fact, you co-sponsored that one.
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, I just saw you on TV.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What did they say?
You're bald.
Nice.
Yeah, it was weird, too, because it was a financial show.
But they were really captivated by your receding hairline.
I got to go, you jack-off.
Bye.
Congressman.
I have to tell you,
I really admire what you did last month.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I wish there were more politicians like you.
Thank you. I'm retired now.
I had to go get a real job.
- You'll do well.
- Thank you.
Hey!
You got a guy running for the bus.
There is another M6 right behind me.
Hey!
No way.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Have we met?
You look vaguely familiar.
- Waldorf men's room.
- You got it.
Were you just staring at my legs while I slept?
I was defenseless against the small dress.
It's a skirt.
It's a belt.
What is it with you and the argyle?
What is the deal with you and the boring shades of blue?
My clothes match.
Did your team pick that out for you?
No team. Team is gone.
- Wow.
- I did it all by myself.
I saw your speech.
Yeah, the speech.
Something must have got into me.
Wow, that is something.
Really augments the moment.
Nice ring, asshole.
Hello? Hello?
It doesn't even work.
Could that ringer get louder or do you have that maxed out?
It's a new phone.
Are you going to run again?
Don't know.
I'm starting a new job today.
You have to run again.
You can't do that.
The country will end up being run by tools like Linfield.
It kind of is.
Oh, shit.
Sorry. I don't know what just happened.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Can you hand me that?
- You sure you okay?
- Yeah.
- I'll pay for the dry cleaning.
- No, it's really fine.
Please don't. Wow.
Seven bucks will probably cover it.
You keep that, you might need it.
You know what? Here.
You write your number down then I can call you and come pick up your skirt.
Oh, my goodness, me.
That is very smooth.
Oh, shit.
Why don't you let me spill some on you and then we'll be even?
- That's a terrible idea.
- I think it's a great idea.
Just one bit because that's not fair.
You actually are crazy.
No, now it all makes sense.
Okay, hang on. Oh, jeez.
He's not here. I know, I'm sorry.
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Who cares?
- It'll be on the... Can you just...
- No.
Okay, now we're in the third grade.
This is great.
It's a sturdy little fucker, isn't it?
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, it just happened.
Okay.
- Okay, that was a new phone.
- Let's wipe it off.
I'm Elise, by the way.
I'll remember that.
- That's my number.
- Terrific, thank you.
I'll call you.
The morning after the election,
I woke up thinking about you.
Hey, man, what's up?
You're not going to believe who I just ran into.
Who?
The girl from election night.
- The one you kissed?
- She kissed me.
You still sticking with that story?
- It's the truth.
- Whatever, dude.
They're ready for you in the main conference room.
What are the odds? It's amazing.
That's great, man, just don't take her advice on speeches anymore.
First time worked, it's not going to work again.
You're just jealous because it's the best speech I ever gave and you didn't write it.
Just so you know, I think I'm coming down against your solar panel thing.
Why?
I just don't think the research is there and the price point is too high on these things.
Of course, it's too high.
But if our company doesn't get involved with stuff like this, who will?
Convince me in the meeting.
I will. See you, buddy.
Hey, Janet.
Hey, Susan.
We just got approval for a recalibration on the Lasalle case.
Two minutes.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Grab him.
9-1-1, Janet! 9-1-1 ! Oh.
You can't get away, David.
David, I really wish you'd just listen to me.
All right, I'll handle it.
David, you really are making this harder than it has to be.
All right, take it easy, guys.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's okay, David.
No. No, sir.
It's being taken care of.
Yes, sir. It's being taken care of.
Yes, sir. No, sir.
No, sir. Yes, sir.
I understand. I'll take care of it.
What a goddamn mess.
- Donaldson?
- Yes.
What do you want to do?
We have to reset him.
Call for a briefcase.
You kidding? It's going to take a signed order from the Chairman.
Get legal on it.
Legal just arrived.
There's no way the Chairman approves a reset.
This is your fault.
There is no way you get a briefcase.
Hey.
- What are my options?
- Hey.
Just bullshit him.
Bullshit this guy?
Hey! What's going on here?
Look at this.
Questions will burn in him till the day he dies.
He won't stop searching for answers. He won't quit.
We have to watch him forever, make sure he doesn't talk.
Endless ripple effects.
You remember the Torres case
40 years ago?
It's not that bad, is it?
In the end, they just leveled with him.
Completely?
Looking at that,
I don't see you have a choice.
Who the hell are you guys?
We are the people who make sure things happen according to plan.
My name is Richardson.
Oh.
You really think
I couldn't see that coming?
I can read your mind.
Yeah, really.
Pick a color.
Blue.
Pick a number. Seventeen.
Now, why are you still thinking about running?
I don't really know what's going on here.
You've just seen behind a curtain that you weren't supposed to know existed.
Must be jarring.
It's not your fault.
Your path through the world this morning was supposed to have been adjusted.
You were supposed to spill your coffee as you entered the park this morning.
You would have gone upstairs to change, you would have missed the bus, and you would have arrived at work
10 minutes later than you did, and we would have been gone.
I was supposed to spill my coffee?
We call that an adjustment.
See, sometimes, when people spill their coffee or their lnternet goes out or they misplaced their keys, they think it's chance.
And sometimes it is.
Sometimes it's us...
...nudging people back on plan.
Sometimes when nudging isn't enough, management authorizes a recalibration.
We deploy our Intervention Team and they change your mind for you, like we did with your friend Charlie.
He's fine, by the way.
You don't need to worry about him.
Now...
There is something I need you to understand if I'm going to let you go.
Okay.
Very few humans have seen what you've seen today, and we're determined to keep it that way.
So, if you ever reveal our existence, we'll erase your brain.
The Intervention Team will reset you.
Your emotions, your memories, your entire personality will be expunged.
Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy.
You won't think anything.
You understand?
Not one word about us.
Okay.
Oh, one more thing, you bumped into a woman this morning on the bus.
Elise?
What does that have to do with anything?
You were never supposed to see her again.
What does that matter?
Because it matters.
- It's in his wallet.
- Hey, hey. God! Hey!
What's with you guys? Jesus!
Oh, come on. No! No!
What the hell?
Really?
What the hell?
Okay.
- Okay.
- Take him back.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
I can walk. I'm capable of walking.
Dude, what are you doing on my floor?
You know, I called you like 10 times, you could have picked up.
Christine, I found him.
He's in my office.
What the hell are you doing?
Round up the guys, we're going to do the meeting now.
You have a headache?
What is wrong with you?
Hey, we're in the big conference room on 17. Let's go.
Morning, Congressman.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, you?
I'm great, why?
You don't have a headache or anything?
No, I feel fantastic, man.
Is it me or this an odd conversation?
On David's solar panel deal, our tech guy has serious doubts about the efficiency ratings they're claiming.
They'd need a 20-fold improvement over anything anyone else has been able to manufacture at that price point to really be a game-changer.
You're opposed to this anyway,
Charlie. And with these financials...
Whoa, whoa. I know it's a risk, but if our company doesn't take a chance on something like this, then who will?
I mean, I'm willing to take a fire on something that could change the world.
Not to mention, be incredibly lucrative.
David?
Yeah, I mean, it's why
I took the job here.
All right.
Let's do it.
Come into my office for a second.
Something is wrong.
A couple of hours ago you miraculously reunite with the girl of your dreams.
Explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear grin right now.
I lost her number.
What?
The woman on the bus.
I lost her phone number and all I had was her first name, so,
I'm never going to see her again.
I'm sorry.
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Your entire world is turned upside down and you're thinking about a woman.
Even if you could remember the number, you'll never get through.
Lost cell phone, changed numbers, whatever creates the fewest ripples.
My name is Harry, by the way.
The fewest ripples?
You freeze people. You froze my friend.
We need special authorization to...
Poke around in people's brains.
You make them think whatever you want...
Be quiet, David.
Can I get you something?
Just some water, please.
Your friend will be fine.
Recalibrations make tiny changes in the way people reason.
It doesn't work on emotion or personality.
That's too intrusive.
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?
The Chairman.
The Chairman?
That's just a name we use.
You use many other names.
We can't talk here.
Meet me on the 4:00 p.m. boat and I'll answer what I can.
If you reveal us, even if it's unintentional...
I know. You'll bump me on the head.
Richardson has automatic authority to reset you.
You mean lobotomize me?
Try not to forget it.
Be on the 4:00 p.m. boat.
Ask your questions,
I'll tell you what I can.
What were they doing to Charlie?
Just changing the way he weighs investment risks which will subtly shift the direction of his company in the way upstairs wants.
So, Richardson could read my mind?
Richardson was trying to scare you.
No, he knew the number
I was thinking of, the color.
Because he set it up as a choice.
"Choose a color, choose a number."
We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts.
When you make a decision, your mind weighs options.
We can perceive them.
We know when you're going to go off the plan or not because if we're close enough, we can sense when it's going to happen.
We're just here to keep you on plan.
That's all we're authorized to do.
Are you allowed to be telling me this stuff?
Are they following me now?
We have to monitor the entire world.
We don't have the manpower to follow everyone all the time.
And there is something about water.
It blocks our ability to read your decision tree.
Are you an angel?
We've been called that.
We're more like case officers who live a lot longer than humans.
Why are you helping me?
I have my reasons.
And why won't they let me be with Elise?
All I know is the amount of resources they've used keeping you from her is pretty damn important to them.
You're going to look for her, aren't you?
You won't find her.
They'll make sure of it.
Even if they weren't trying to stop you, there are nine million people in this city.
You'll never find her.
Forget about her.
Move on with your life.
Stop! Stop the bus!
Elise? Elise, hi.
David.
You know, I rode the M6 to work every day for three years hoping that I'd bump into you.
Listen, is there a place we could go and talk?
Don't you have to get to work or something?
I just got sick.
"I haven't seen you in three years, you make me sick."
That's not an ideal come-on, just so you know.
What are you looking for?
I felt like someone was watching us.
Hey, Charlie,
I'm going to have to skip breakfast, and I probably have to postpone the speech, too. I just bumped into Elise.
You just hung up on your friend.
We've known each other since we were kids.
- What speech?
- It doesn't matter.
- You want to take a walk?
- No.
We have a lot to catch up on.
I don't think you should cancel your speech.
What if I don't like you at the end of our walk?
I'll take my chances.
Seriously, my number hasn't changed, just call me like you didn't last time.
Look, if you take a walk with me,
I'll explain why.
It's been years. How do you know
I don't have a nice boyfriend?
Do you have a nice boyfriend?
Would it matter if I did?
Yeah.
So you don't have any real conviction then?
Okay, it wouldn't matter at all.
So, you don't mind being a home-wrecker?
Congressman!
How are you doing, man?
I'm from Red Hook. You're the best.
Thank you. Good to see you.
If you were married, then it would bother me.
But now you're just saying what you think I want to hear.
I'm single.
Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for not calling me.
I didn't have your number.
I gave it you on the bus.
Handed it to you.
I was mugged. It was taken from me.
No, come on.
- My wallet was taken.
- Come on.
Why else would I fawn all over you on a bus three years ago and then never call you?
Because, I don't know! You have a girlfriend and you felt terrible.
Listen, I swear to you that I did not have your number.
All right.
No, on my parents' graves.
That's heavy.
That's too heavy, I know, but it's true.
I didn't have your number.
And I didn't even have a last name to go by.
If you google just "Elise,"
- you get 757,000 hits.
- You did not.
And none of them are you.
We have a problem.
What?
David Norris is off plan.
Son of a bitch. How did he find her?
Chance. Just spotted her on the street.
We never should have let him meet her in the first place.
We followed protocol to the letter.
Guy rides the same bus every day for three years.
Who does that?
Three years later,
I'm still cleaning up your mess.
Let's cut the power at her dance studio.
I'm a dancer.
Oh.
Not like that, you pervert.
I'm in a contemporary ballet company.
I think you have the wrong idea about me.
No, I think that was the first thing that crossed your mind, actually.
I think you should invite me to one of your performances.
The company is called Cedar Lake, and there is actually a show tomorrow night, if you want.
- Is that an invitation?
- No, it's information.
We're covering the girl's artistic director and we're still working on Charlie Traynor.
This whole thing will be over in an hour.
Hi, how are you? Paul, right?
How did you remember that?
I'm a politician, I'm good with names.
Her decision tree is diverging from our models.
It's just the two of you?
Yes.
Thirty-six hours without contact, she'll never speak to him again.
Look at her file.
It's the last thing in the world she'll put up with.
No, something's wrong.
I'm already seeing inflection points.
You okay?
Yeah.
We're in motion on changing the location of her rehearsal.
You have to be born with the right body like very flexible hips and shoulders and long neck.
And you weren't?
No, I was. I was lucky.
But after 15 years of that precision and the training...
How is everything over here?
It's great. Thank you.
It's good, thank you.
So, I wanted to try something else just on my own, open-ended and human, I guess.
What do you mean?
Look.
What's this?
If they kiss.
A kiss? That's all it takes?
A real kiss.
If that happens, every possible adjustment strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit.
I think that everything you go through in life should come out in the way that you dance.
I haven't found that to be the case with my dancing.
It's a shame.
David, hate to interrupt.
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to see you again, Elise.
How did you find me?
Does it matter?
Nice work.
There's a crowd of people waiting for your announcement speech at the Brooklyn Bridge right now.
You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.
I know. I told you I'm not going to let you out of my sight.
- David, what the hell?
- Do you want to come?
Do you want to watch?
No. I can't, I have to go and rehearse.
Actually, I just heard that they're moving my rehearsal to Pier 17, right next to the bridge.
You know what, why don't we just postpone it?
- We'll do the speech another time.
- No, David, come on, you can't do that.
Thank you.
- You have to go.
- Check.
David, she's rehearsing so close.
It'll take you three minutes to get there after the speech.
All right.
Just come over when you're done.
Keep the change. Thank you.
Have Charlie's aide call him now.
Are you sure you don't want a ride?
No, I have to go home and change.
You're so late.
Your friend is about to cry.
I'm wrangling him right now.
Yeah, I know.
Shifting her rehearsal to Pier 17 was a genius move.
We're not out of the woods yet.
Come over when you're done.
- David.
- Okay.
Sorry, the TV crew is there.
We got to go, man.
We're okay.
Look, whatever happens,
I'm not going to let anything come between us again.
Okay.
I'll see you soon.
Hey, how you doing?
Thank you. Appreciate it.
How are you?
Thanks a lot. Good to see you, too.
Thank you.
I have to say, it's good to be back in Brooklyn.
There's been a lot of speculation
- as to whether or not...
- It's done.
...I would run for a Senate seat here in the state of New York.
I came here today to put an end to that speculation and to tell you, unequivocally,
I will seek the Senate seat for the great state of New York.
David! David!
Shit.
Don't forget, I added the bankers' group after The Daily Show tomorrow.
Are you listening to me?
David?
I cannot get a break on this case.
Okay. I got to get to Pier 17.
Do the interview and you can do whatever you want.
Just handle the interviews for me.
I'll talk to those guys...
This has got to go on the nightly news.
I got to see Elise right now.
Every time we get close, you do something to mess this up.
This is different.
City, please?
Manhattan.
What listing?
Cedar Lake. It's a dance company.
Connecting.
He's going to ask the parking attendant to use the hard line.
I already killed it.
Excuse me, can I use your phone?
I have an emergency.
Restaurant across the street.
Mmm-hmm.
I took out everything for three blocks.
This guy is a pain in the ass.
Come on, let's go talk to him.
There is a whole world of women out there.
I thought we established this one was off limits.
It's been a while,
I must have forgotten.
Doesn't change the fact.
You put us together three times.
That wasn't us, that was just chance.
Why do you want to keep us apart?
Because the plan says so.
Then you misread the plan.
There is no misreading the plan when it comes to you and Elise.
Then the plan is wrong.
- Do you know who wrote it?
- I don't care.
You should.
You should really show a little respect.
If I'm not supposed to be with her, how come I feel like this?
It doesn't matter how you feel.
What matters is what is in black and white.
You don't know why I'm not supposed to be with her, do you?
That's why you can't tell me.
You don't know.
Who is this guy?
Uh-oh.
Excuse me, everyone.
Sorry to disturb your lunch.
It's an emergency.
Has anyone here ever seen a performance at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company?
The Cedar Lake Ballet Company?
Yeah, I have.
Where is it?
Son of a bitch.
Hey, taxi. Hey!
Taxi! Hey!
Taxi!
Maybe you should try the subway.
Don't all these taxies you're diverting have plans, too?
How long you going to keep that up?
Twenty minutes? An hour?
Wow, the ripples must just be endless.
I don't care what you put in my way,
I'm not giving up.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Taxi!
Hey!
You all right?
You okay?
What happened?
You got hit. Are you okay?
- I think so.
- Don't move.
You all right?
Hello, I just witnessed an accident on the corner of Water and Dover Street.
Unfortunately, you're the only witness, Congressman.
But we did this three times already.
I just need a few more details.
Oh, I see.
You're not even a cop, are you?
You're one of them.
- Calm down.
- Okay.
Someone could have been killed.
Sir, if you would just calm down.
Hey, Sergeant.
Hi. Sorry, excuse me,
I know you need a statement from me, but do I need to stay here or can I do it over the phone?
No, sir, we know how to get in touch with you.
Okay. Now, is this man under your command?
Never mind. Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey!
You want to make a quick 100 bucks?
You're going to have to break a couple of traffic laws.
All right, 26th and 10th.
It's a ballet company called Cedar Lake.
Go through that.
Look out!
Watch it.
This is going to keep happening, just go through.
Son of a bitch!
- Set a traffic jam on Broadway.
- Too many ripples.
He's getting out of range.
I don't know what to do with this.
You're reaching your limit.
Hey!
Excuse me.
Two down. Two down.
Oh, shit!
Next one.
I hate downtown.
Sorry.
I've got inflection points.
All he needs to do is see her dance and you're at your ripple limit.
What? All right, block the door.
He's already through it.
Not that one, the next one.
Excuse me.
David Norris, I'm here to see Elise.
I'm blocking them all.
Hat! Hat!
- Is she here?
- Yeah, she's in the studio.
It's too late. He's already seen her.
You hit your ripple limit.
Celebrate now.
They're just going to kick it upstairs.
It's Donaldson.
He has no idea what he's up against.
Let's take a walk.
The intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker, you pulling them apart twice only to have chance put them back together.
Yeah, all that seemed a little much.
So, I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning.
Have you been in here before?
No, of course not.
It seems like David Norris and Elise Sellas were meant to be together because they were meant to be together.
Wait, what?
In the '70s when he was born, they were meant to be together, same thing in the '80s, '90s.
Wasn't till 2005 that the plan changed and she was supposed to stay with Adrian.
The problem here is there are remnants from all those old plans that keep pushing them together.
They still feel like they belong with each other even though they don't, and we're about to tear them apart again.
You spend your whole career hoping, someday, you'll get a red-letter case.
Something you can really make a name for yourself with.
Finally you get one, and it's booby-trapped.
What?
I'm saying, it wasn't your fault.
They were meant to be together.
What?
Were. In an earlier version of the plan.
Actually, a dozen earlier versions.
I always wondered how we had such bad luck that she was on that particular bus on that particular day.
How could a plan just change like that?
I don't know.
It's above my pay grade.
So, we're going operational.
This is exciting. It's been a while.
We're not going operational.
No one ever made it to my job by taking stupid risks.
So, what are we going to do?
We're going to kick this case upstairs to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat.
We're going to bring this to Thompson.
Thompson?
When he was in the field, his nickname was...
"The Hammer," yes.
He'll crush this little romance with a flick of his hand and force them back on plan again.
I want to go to a club.
Oh! Why ruin a really nice day?
- Come on.
- No, I don't dance.
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.
Well, I've been told that I have trouble feeling.
Who told you that?
A long list of women.
That's gross.
You know what?
Let's race to that lamppost.
You win, I dance for you.
I win, you dance for me.
On the pole?
If you like, yeah.
This is serious. What are the rules?
There are no rules.
Oh! You bastard! Oh, my gosh!
You challenged me in those shoes?
Okay, fine. I can't.
You're right. These are the wrong shoes.
I'm going to twist an ankle.
- You said, "No rules."
- I avoided them.
Ow!
You said you had trouble feeling.
Great.
Hey, David.
You're even cuter in person.
Hey, it's David Norris.
How you doing? How are you?
How are we feeling about this tie?
Hey, David Norris!
Hey, how you doing?
Maybe I should go home and get my tux.
Definitely don't do that. It's good.
I should never have come back here again without my backup dancers.
I voted for you.
How are you?
Norris, you're a rock star!
Did you grow up over here?
Yeah, three blocks over that way.
Pioneer Street.
My whole childhood.
What were you like as a kid?
I've spent about half my time in the principal's office up until the sixth grade.
Wow.
Yeah, that was when my mother and my brother died within a month of each other.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
You know how I always tell that story about how I got inspired to go into politics because my dad took me to the Senate Gallery and we sat together and that's true.
But what I leave out is he did that right after they died.
And I was bottoming out.
So, he wanted to get me out of here for a little while and he planned this road trip to DC, and I think it's because
JFK was his idol.
And we went and sat in the gallery.
I remember watching him watch them, and I knew that that's what I wanted to do.
I wish they were here to see all this.
I was...
Didn't expect to tell you any of that.
David?
David?
- Hello?
- It's Adrian.
Hey.
What are you doing? Why are you calling?
Hi.
No, I was...
Because I was sleeping.
No.
No, it's not.
Why are you calling?
Okay, well, I got to go.
No, I got to go. Okay.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right. Everything okay?
Yeah.
Oh, my God. That was so weird.
I woke up and you weren't here.
And then the phone rang and it was my ex which is just so strange.
Sorry, I guess we hadn't gotten to any of that stuff yet.
Right.
You know, we broke up a while ago, and it's over and then he calls four times in one morning.
He called you four times this morning?
Mmm-hmm.
How long have you guys been broken up?
Um...
Three months.
It's like he knew
I was with someone else.
Was it serious?
We were engaged.
So, not really that serious?
Right.
Well, what happened?
Do you want to know this?
Yeah.
He was a great guy.
Brilliant choreographer and dancer, and we had the same group of friends.
We had known each other a long time.
Well, he sounds great.
Why didn't you marry him?
Because of you.
I'm not some hopeless romantic.
I've never allowed myself to be that way.
But once I felt, even for a moment, what I felt with you.
You ruined me.
I didn't want to settle for less.
I know the feeling.
It scares the shit out of me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You don't need to say that.
I'm not going to hurt you.
This is the first time in 25 years that I don't feel like I'm by myself.
That's a lot of responsibility for me.
I don't know if I'm quite comfortable with that.
Well, too late.
You know, I'm supposed to go to an interview right now.
What if I told you I wasn't ready to let you out of my sight quite yet?
- Sounds good.
- You want to go?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Are you handsome or is it that Washington is so populated by
I don't want to say, hideous abnormalities...
This is getting a little weird.
David Norris, everybody.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?
Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message.
He was just called into a meeting.
- He says it's urgent.
- Okay.
He said he'll call you as soon as he's out and he'll see you at the show tonight.
Okay, thank you. Thanks.
This way, Congressman.
Hello?
Frustrating, isn't it?
My name is Thompson.
Whatever happened to free will?
We actually tried free will before.
After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire, we stepped back to see how you would do on your own.
You gave us the Dark Ages for five centuries until finally we decided we should come back in.
The Chairman thought that maybe we just needed to do a better job with teaching you how to ride a bike before taking the training wheels off again.
So, we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, scientific revolution.
For 600 years we taught you to control your impulses with reason.
Then in 1910, we stepped back again.
Within 50 years, you had brought us World War I, the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust, and capped it off by bringing the entire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban missile crisis.
At that point a decision was taken to step back in again before you did something that even we couldn't fix.
You don't have free will, David.
You have the appearance of free will.
You expect me to believe that?
I make decisions every day.
You have free will over which toothpaste you use or which beverage to order at lunch.
But humanity just isn't mature enough to control the important things.
So, you handle the important things?
The last time I checked, the world is a pretty screwed-up place.
It's still here.
If we had left things in your hands, it wouldn't be.
Tell me why I can't be with Elise?
Because the last guy didn't know.
Meeting Elise at the Waldorf three years ago wasn't chance.
That was us.
We knew she would inspire you to give that speech.
That speech that brought you back from the edge of oblivion and overnight made you the frontrunner in this coming election.
What are you saying?
You want me to win the election?
This one and four more after it.
And I'm not just talking about elections for Senate.
You can matter, David. Really matter.
What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate Gallery when you were 10.
What your brother wanted when he made you promise the day before he overdosed that you wouldn't be like him.
Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people?
That terrible emptiness when you're not.
Don't do that.
David, you can change the world, but that doesn't happen if you stay with her.
Why do you people care who I love?
It's not about her, it's about you.
What being with her does to you.
What it does to me?
I'm better when I'm with her!
Even you said it. The speech.
In small doses, Elise was the cure.
But in large doses, she rubs off on you.
Stop.
David, the president can't be a loose cannon.
Stop talking. It's not working.
Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now?
You've seen what we can do.
You can't doubt we are who we say we are.
Look, it's not about who you are, it's about who I am.
Can't outrun your fate, David.
I just disagree with you about what my fate is.
I know what I feel for her and it's not going to change.
All I have are the choices that I make.
And I choose her come what may.
It's 6:20.
If you leave now, you can make Elise's show.
She's a beautiful dancer.
I thought I made myself clear.
There is one more piece to this I haven't mentioned.
I guess I just didn't have the heart.
If you stay with her, it not only kills your dreams, it kills hers.
What?
Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country and eventually one of the world's greatest choreographers.
If she stays with you, she ends up teaching dance to six-year-olds.
When you look back at all this, David, just remember we tried to reason with you.
I always hear people saying,
"You can't blame yourself for what happens to other people," but in this case, really, you can.
This is what you do, David.
This is what you did getting into a bar fight the night you first got elected.
What you did to get that embarrassing photo in The New York Post.
We give you opportunities other people would kill for and you squander them with impulse.
It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly helping you with this.
It's a sprain, David, but if you stay with her, you'll take away the only thing she ever cared about.
It's up to you.
It's just a sprain.
Yeah.
The doctor said it's going to be better in a month or less.
That's totally unexpected.
I'm so relieved.
Great. Great.
You're such a great dancer, and you'll heal up and just get better and better.
I'm going to go make a couple phone calls.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm so happy for you.
It's done. Thompson finished it.
I know.
You can't let it get to you like it did with his family.
This is the job.
You ever wonder if it's right?
I mean, if it's always right?
Not like I used to.
Look, Chairman has the plan.
We only see part of it.
I was talking to some friends of ours over in Monroe County this morning, and I said something to them that I think a lot of you may have heard me say before but it bears repeating.
David Norris, who has spent the last two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area received some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a 16-point lead over his opponent less than a month before election day.
Since his announcement 11 months ago,
Norris has had a significant lead...
Hi. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yeah, thank you. I need it. Thank you.
- Who should I make it out to?
- My nephew, Miles.
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Pleasure.
Can we get a picture with you?
Sure, come on.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Hey.
I want to show you this, because you would find out eventually.
I want to be here when you do.
She's getting married to that guy she was engaged to.
You okay?
I think I'm going to...
Take a day off.
Hell, take a couple. We're 16 points up.
Yeah, even I can't blow a lead that big.
Congressman, good to see you again.
Your friend just left you this.
He said you would be stopping by.
Why would you want to see me?
Thompson was lying when he said you couldn't be with Elise because she brings out your reckless side.
Then why? Why do they care so much?
Because she's enough, David.
If you have her, you won't need to fill that void inside of you with applause and votes and dreams of one day making it to the White House.
That's important, but it's not the only thing that matters.
Why are you so different from them?
Your dad was a very smart man.
He could have been a lot more.
Wanted to be.
Your brother, too.
But the plan didn't call for it.
What about my mother?
That wasn't me.
That wasn't us at all.
It was just chance?
I'm sorry.
You know, Thompson is not lying.
They're already talking about me being a presidential candidate.
I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm 16 points up.
The public loves you.
Before I met Elise, that's all I cared about.
I don't even notice it now.
I can't stop thinking about her.
Do you know where she's getting married?
In front of a judge tomorrow morning.
Is she happy?
Thompson won't let you anywhere near her.
Not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever.
Harry.
Is she happy?
I got to try and get her back.
Will you help me?
Will you just help me get to her?
They'll sense you coming a mile away.
What if I could move as fast as you?
Teach me about the doors.
The rain will stop in the next hour, and that's the only thing keeping them from seeing us right now.
If we're going to do this, we'll need all night to do it and a place surrounded by water to do it in.
Always turn the doorknob clockwise.
What happens if I turn it the other way?
You don't want to do that.
That's only for us.
Put your hand on my shoulder and don't let go until we cross the threshold.
Are these ever locked?
Not when you're wearing one of our hats.
Keep moving, David.
Is this...
It's the Museum of Modern Art.
Yeah.
Close the door.
This is the city's main pumping station for downtown Manhattan.
We're 10 blocks from the courthouse.
Wait here.
Hi, is the floor open?
You okay, sweetie?
Yeah, I just...
I just feel like being on the floor.
Lower Manhattan is layer upon layer of substrate.
That's what we call the doors that have been added over time.
Makes it a lot more complex to navigate downtown than it is uptown and a lot slower.
Your destination,
60 Centre Street, Courtroom 300.
There are thousands of different ways to get to the courthouse using the doors.
I want you to learn how to stay in the substrate so Thompson won't be able to get a fix on you.
Okay. Just south of the diner, it's a red door.
I come out on Broadway, right by Leonard Street.
That's good. Keep going.
From Leonard, half a block down.
Okay, suppose Thompson's there?
Okay, I go east to Lafayette.
No, it's Crosby Street there.
Eight doors?
I'm zigzagging all over the place.
That will take me too long.
But every time you go through a door, their plan books will lose track of you, so it's safer.
Look, I need you to understand this has never been done before.
So, the minute you go through that first door, all hell will break loose.
Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat.
I don't care if it's a Yankee cap, a bowler, or even a yarmulke.
Assume everyone in a hat is working with Thompson.
Even you guys can't get through the doors without your hats on, right?
Right.
It's one of the ways the Chairman limits our power.
Water is another way.
And you said before, what if Thompson's in front of me on Crosby Street?
Right.
Why don't I just knock the hat off his head and then run by him before he has time to pick it up?
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.
The fastest way is actually if I go right for the blue door.
Yeah, but then you're exposed the entire way there.
That's a lot more dangerous than leapfrogging through doors.
But if I make it,
I'll take them completely by surprise.
If you make it.
Come on, we have a lot more to get through.
Whatever it takes.
Your father used to say that.
I guess you're not supposed to identify with your subjects.
You're not supposed to feel guilt.
We're not built to lead with our emotions like you are, but that doesn't mean we don't have them.
Some more than others.
You're lucky, it started raining again.
We need to get going.
The wedding is in 10 minutes.
We have time. Being early is just as bad as being late.
Is your fiancee here?
She's on her way in.
Courtroom 300.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- This is it.
- Okay.
I'm going to go for the blue door.
Of course.
Here is your way through it.
Don't lose it.
Thanks, Harry.
Good luck.
Okay.
It looks like Mr. Norris is using the rain to make a run for it.
Call the proctor at the wedding.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just nervous, I guess.
I just need a minute in the bathroom, okay?
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.
He just went into the substrate.
- Whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no.
It's an emergency. Sorry.
Docket number 22, please come forward.
We're next. Will you go check on her?
Yeah.
You're David Norris! Yeah, I got to go.
Nothing in the hat.
Go ahead.
She's not even in there.
Where is she? Where is she?
Elise.
You're not marrying that guy.
I'm so sorry, and I don't know what you must think of me, but you can't marry him.
You don't love him.
I've been terrible, I know.
- I'm getting married.
- No, you can't.
Don't touch me! What are you doing?
Do you know that no one has ever hurt me as much as you did?
I'm so sorry that I left you the way that I did.
David, you know what?
You left me in a fucking hospital.
What are you doing?
I know it seems terrible but there was a reason.
You don't know anything about me and what makes me happy.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Oh, my God.
Don't worry about him, he's with them.
- Just listen to me.
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- Forget about him.
- What are you doing?
Look at me, I know that you love me.
Okay, this says that you love me and that I love you and that we're not supposed to be together.
Because of this book.
But I know that I'm supposed to be with you because of the way I feel.
I love you and I don't care what happens.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you even if it's only a little while.
He just revealed us.
Call the Intervention Team.
Tell them it's a square-one reset.
Mr. Thompson has deployed the Intervention Team.
He's requesting an emergency
Reset Authorization.
I'll carry it in.
Why are they chasing you?
They're going to reset me.
What are you talking about?
I never lied to you.
Down here.
He's down here.
I love you, Elise.
I'm going to show you something.
You deserve to know.
What's going on?
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.
Got them. Sixth Avenue.
Contain this.
Oh, my God. What's happening to me?
All you need to know, we're being chased.
I need you to trust me.
I need you to trust me.
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.
Door, door, door!
Find another door!
What the hell is going on?
What the hell is going on, David?
Okay, I'm sorry.
How did we just do that?
I'm so sorry.
These doors belong to the people who are chasing us.
- Who are they?
- I don't know what to call them, but they want to take you away from me.
Why do they care about us?
They hurt your ankle, Elise.
Everything you've worked for your entire life, it doesn't happen if you stay with me.
That's why I left you in the hospital.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
This can't be wrong.
This can't be wrong.
Why do they think it's wrong?
The book... Their book.
But what if I can find who wrote it?
Okay, I can go through this door alone.
You'll never see me or the people chasing us again.
Or you could come with me, and
I don't know what's on the other side, but I know you would be next to me, and that's all I've wanted since the minute I met you.
I'm coming with you.
Okay.
Take the other one.
Turn it to the left.
To the left.
Oh, my God.
Hey! You can't be in here.
Stop, sir!
Hold them up!
Come on.
Stop them!
Harry Mitchell, they want you in the Chairman's office.
Immediately.
Come on.
Hey! Hey!
How did you get in here?
Search the room!
Shit!
Go back.
No.
Oh, my God.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Did you really think you could reach the Chairman?
And change your fate if you did?
Or write your own?
It doesn't work like that and I told you why.
I've got a message for you.
I understand.
Even Thompson has a boss.
Harry?
You're the Chairman?
No.
You've met him though, or her.
Everybody has.
The Chairman comes in a different form to everyone so people rarely realize when it happens.
Is this some sort of test?
In a way, it's all a test, for everybody, even the members of the Adjustment Bureau.
David, you risked everything for Elise.
And Elise, when you came through that door at the Statue of Liberty, you risked everything, too.
But you inspired me.
It seems like you inspired the Chairman, too.
Is that about us?
Yes.
What does it say?
It says that this situation between the two of you is a serious deviation from the plan.
So, the Chairman rewrote it.
Okay.
Now what?
Now...
You can take the stairs.
Most people live life on the path we set for them.
Too afraid to explore any other.
But once in a while, people like you come along who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way.
People who realize free will is a gift you'll never know how to use until you fight for it.
I think that's the Chairman's real plan that maybe one day we won't write the plan.
You will.
Subrip: easytobeaman
And do, you know, and wait it out like the rest of the world?
You know what I mean?
I mean, the streets look like any normal holiday.
People are pretty calm, at least for now.
Okay, so the green is the voltage.
Do back-l liked it the way it was a moment ago.
Yeah, I hope I'm not boring you, my dear friend.
- Cisco?
- Why even bother?
- What?
- Cisco!
No, I'm talking to Skye.
For you.
I do it for you.
I know you like it smooth.
Son of a bitch.
Is that a meter maid giving someone a ticket today?
Well, what do you expect?
It's Beverly Hills, right?
All I can say is, you better put that fine in an envelope lickety-split before the post office closes tonight.
You know what I'm saying?
We're now 14 hours and 44 minutes away from the end of the Earth.
Our live coverage continues with our crews in New York and our colleagues around the world.
As much as I would like to give you the news otherwise, there has been no information to suggest any reprieve in the rapid decline of the Earth's ozone layer.
The top scientists still predicting the lethal...
Will occur at 4:44 a.m. eastern time.
When that moment comes tomorrow morning, the end Will be sudden and global.
In Rome, the pope is at the Vatican preparing to deliver a final blessing to an estimated
3 million people who have converged on St. Peter's Square.
In the holy cities of Mecca and Jerusalem spontaneous pilgrimages are under way.
Millions are on the move there, hoping their religions...
Guess what, man.
I just caught the owner as he was leaving.
Said he couldn't let down his customers.
Oh, shit.
Wanted to say good-bye to the regulars.
Anyway, he's leaving the door open with a sign saying,
"Just take what you need.
Think of the others."
I love this guy.
He's a total mensch.
But then the pilot came on.
"So there's an emergency light on.
"We don't know if the landing gear went down.
"Then we're gonna buzz the control tower, and they're gonna try to see if our landing gear is down."
You think they're right?
Yes.
I know they're right.
I know they're right.
I know.
"Take your shoes off, because they might melt.
"All jewelry off, because it Will burn through your fingers."
And then someone started to cry.
And then someone got up from the other side and came over and hugged them, you know?
And then somebody else started to cry, and then somebody else got up and went over and hugged them.
And then everybody, it was, either you were breaking down or you were hugging.
And everybody on the plane was loving everybody else on the plane, unconditionally, you know?
"I could die in ten minutes with you.
And let's spend the last ten minutes, with a hug."
You know, and it was just... everybody just wanted to hug everybody.
It was really beautiful.
Oh, yes.
Oh.
What do you got?
Oh, yes.
Can you see the whole pen without looking at the bottom?
Well, this is the continuation of a process that actually began in '92 in Rio de Janeiro at the so-called Earth Summit.
The Kyoto Protocol was the first iteration of how to get those commitments into a binding form.
No, you have to look at the top.
And then you have look at the bottom, and then you say,
"There's a whole pen there," okay?
But by the time you get to the bottom, you don't know if there's still a top there.
But in your mind, you think there is.
You say,
"Geshla, it's a whole pen.
Geshla, it's a whole pen."
That's a proof.
That's a tiny little proof.
You ain't looking at a pen.
You're looking at a tiny image in your own mind, okay?
You are looking at a tiny image in your own mind.
Now, immediately, we have to call you back from the precipice.
Hey.
We have to pull you back from the edge of this thing.
You let me sleep.
Are you crazy?
Don't think you're living in your head.
Well, what time is it?
Okay, don't get confused.
How long have I been sleeping?
It hasn't been that long.
We really don't have too many years to begin reducing the global warming pollution that is driving the Earth's ecological system towards catastrophe.
Okay, stay with that.
They say ten years, don't you?
The window, they say, is ten years, essentially?
Yeah, and I actually said that three years ago, yeah.
And "catastrophe" means what?
There are certain elements in the Earth's ecological system that could be pushed beyond a kind of tipping point.
The phrase is controversial.
But if the Greenland ice pack, for example...
Turn it off already, Cisco.
I'm tired of hearing their bullshit.
And him, I'm sick of him.
How many times can you watch the same shit over and over again?
Just turn it off, please.
Would produce a six-to seven-meter increase.
The disappearance of the North Polar ice cap the size of the continental
United States:
It's been there for 3 million years, a key element in the Earth's ability to cool itself.
If it disappears, it would not come back on a timescale that would be comfortable...
- Yes!
- How you doing, man?
I don't see you.
Hey, I don't see you.
What's on-hey, there you go.
How you doing, man?
Yeah, we're celebrating, man.
You know, party.
What can I say?
What else can we do?
That's a strategy.
Yeah, well, I don't know about strategy.
I'm just letting my feelings go; that's all.
What's Skye up to?
She working?
She's working.
You know.
Yeah.
Well, man, I Wish you were here to party with us.
I wish I was with you too, but just keep doing what you're doing.
Hey.
Lola, girl.
Having a good day?
Getting your good-byes in?
"At 4:44 a.m. EST tomorrow morning,
"give or take a few seconds,
"the world Will come to an end.
"It Will be the result
"of the ever... weakening ozone layer
"that has now thinned and dissipated
"far more rapidly than even the worst doomsayer
"could have ever imagined.
"So the final explosion:
"meltdown Will come with fair warning
"but no possible means of escape.
There Will be no survivors."
"The world Will end."
A little, tiny clock is popping up in the back of your head.
Why?
'Cause you have a seed in your mind for that, right?
How did that seed get there?
Who put it there?
You did. How?
That's karma.
Okay? That's karma.
What does karma mean?
Karma means doing something, saying something, or thinking something which puts an image in your mind.
Something happens under the influence of kindness, under the influence of your teacher's blessing.
Why are we talking about pot?
Why are we talking about clock?
Why are we talking about pen?
Because the world is not coming from the outside.
The world is coming from the images you plant in your mind, and you can plant whatever world you want, you see?
You can plant whatever world you want.
You don't need a body to die in,
'cause it doesn't exist down here.
It's an image in your mind.
Plant a different image in your mind, and you stop death.
You see?
'Cause this pot's not a pot, and the pen's not a pen, and the clock's not a clock, and the arm is not an arm.
It's all the same, okay?
If it existed out there, if there was pots, and if there was clocks, and if there was pens, and if they were out there, then, then shoot yourself.
My brother killed himself.
He got it, and he shot himself, you know.
He said, "What's the use?"
Why should I waste my time?" you know?
Kill yourself.
There's no point.
You can't change anything.
If a pot is a pot and a pen is a pen, it... you can't change.
Give it up.
What, you're just gonna get older?
Oh!
We were talking a lot here in the newsroom about how to deal with these final minutes.
I've been in this chair bringing you the news literally thousands of times.
Honestly, I don't want to spend my final minute on Earth here.
We want the people who work here to be with their loved ones.
There was a spirit in New York after the September 11th terrorist attacks that was about caring and giving.
We have seen that again today under these unimaginably tragic circumstances.
Al Gore was right.
By the time we realized what we'd done, we had already ruined the planet.
And today it doesn't matter where you live or how much money you have.
We are all about to face the same fate at the same moment.
My family is waiting for me now.
There's nothing more for us to say here but to repeat what we have told you:
We don't have much time left.
You don't need me to sit here and tell you how tragic this is, so this is the end of our commentary.
We are going to fill the screen with live camera views from all over the city, and we Will leave those pictures up until the end.
How can you not think about the end?
How do you not plan for the future?
How do these guys not think about what the hell is gonna happen next?
You know, whether you're... whether you're cutting down a tree or building the Trade Towers or the atomic bomb-fuck that.
I'm sick of it.
Where are the experts?
Where are the fucking experts?
These guys, they're just talking, talking, don't even have the fucking slightest clue.
Never mind doubt.
I mean, we don't know what the fuck is going on.
We're all gonna die, guys!
We're already dead!
Damn.
He looked right at me.
He was thinking straight.
Why let someone dictate when you're gonna die?
Fucking motherfuckers.
Hey, don't put that coat on him!
Leave that man alone!
If you want to help him, light a candle.
No!
Is that my fuckin' landlord?
Hey! Hey, Wally!
How's that 2.5% a year feel now?
No, no, I'm not saying him.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
It's not his fault.
It's not anybody's fault.
We're all in the same boat.
We're all doomed.
I don't want to leave you.
These guys chopped down every fucking tree on the island to make a statue.
Fuck.
And they don't have anything to build a boat to get the fish.
At least they were doing... worshipping God-the fucking...
I shouldn't be saying that.
Fuck that book!
What is wrong with you people?
Leave that man alone!
What is wrong with you?
Baby.
Come on.
Come on.
What are we waiting for?
I'm waiting for you to come down.
Come on.
What are we waiting for?
- A couple hours' difference?
- Get down, Cisco.
Come on.
Get down.
Thump!
Stop it.
Stop!
Hey.
What?
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.
You're so sweet.
It's gonna be okay.
I don't know what to do.
Just be with me.
I know.
I am.
You want to fly?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes?
You'd like that?
Shoes off!
Now, that I can do.
Grab my wrists.
Must have been the gaff tape.
What happened to your legs?
- Okay.
- Spaghetti legs.
Okay.
Okay.
Fly on home, fly on home.
Where you goin', girl?
She be a pink butterfly.
Oh, yeah.
Where you goin', girl?
Where you goin'?
We're going together up.
Where are we going?
Isn't it beautiful up here?
Too beautiful.
I pissed my pants.
Your turn.
Who's that?
Yeah? Yeah?
Delivery.
Yeah, come on up.
Yeah, I was wrong.
You're kidding me.
No.
Come on.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Not again!
Hi. Come on in.
Thank you very much.
What's your name?
You've been here, like, a thousand times, but I don't even know your name.
Chung.
How are you doing?
You know what's going on, or don't you give a shit?
Hey, kid.
Hey, you want some food?
Oh, I doubt it?
You've probably had plenty of this stuff.
Oh.
Keep the change.
Take it.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Can I get you anything?
Skypey.
Skypey.
Oh, yeah, Skype.
Yeah, I can do that for you.
I just got to get my computer.
Okay.
Okay, you just go ahead.
It's just...
You know how to do it, right?
Just... yeah, there you go.
Skye.
Come and get it.
Is it ready?
Well, yeah.
That's Vietnam.
That's Vietnam he's calling.
Chung?
Thank you.
I'm so glad I've known you.
Chung.
Thank you.
We human beings are the... almost like a creator of the world or the controller of the world.
Through technology, through science, we can do anything, everything.
We do not run nature.
I think we human beings something above nature.
I think that's wrong.
After all, we are part of the nature.
So through that way, it become clear, you see, we have the responsibility to take care of the environment, of the nature, because ultimately, we are part of the nature.
So the nature balance dramatically change, we will suffer, the entire humanity.
Then, this will, what-what were instinct will disappear.
So that's either one, one force.
Then another, I think, I think, every human... requirement or meaningful life, we need to seek internal, sort of inner spiritual development.
Now, here, when I say it's a spiritual-spirituality, not necessarily religious faith.
But even without religious faith, still there are such... a sense of caring one another, sense of sharing one another.
There's a sense of community.
These are the basic human good qualities.
These are our fabled spirituality.
Without that, you can't be happy person.
One says that money is the source of all evil.
Is that true?
Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Of course, if we just become slave to money...
Then all our energy or mind, this is... concentrate on money.
And then the greed, that kind of thing, extreme greed...
Then in order to get more money, then no hesitation to adopt various different method.
Scandals or corruptions or exploitation, forcing these things.
Then, of course, money, it then becomes evil.
But for sustain, for life, without money, you can't.
You're a medical man.
What do you think happens after bodily death?
After bodily death, then they all get wings, and they all start flying up toward heaven.
Yeah?
And do you think you'll be a good flyer?
I think I'll fly up there eventually.
Yeah?
And then once you gets there, what happens?
A big party?
Big party up there.
Oh, yeah.
And then you fly around some more?
Now that's the whole idea behind it.
It's a big party.
And you're getting with your old friends, and even, even those that aren't too friendly with you.
The people that are responsible for the end of the world:
How do you feel about them?
Well, the people that are responsible...
Hopefully it'll backtrack on them, and they'll get the same treatment that they gave to the ones that they subjected to that fate.
Hey.
Hi.
Hang on.
I just got to open this up.
There we go.
Oh, baby.
I'm not very technological.
There we go.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Yeah?
And your mother?
You know her.
She's acting like nothing's gonna happen tonight.
She's acting like everybody's stupid.
What's with her?
She thinks I'm stupid.
She's-she's in denial.
Well, listen.
She's your mother, so that's just the way it is, okay?
Okay.
How's Skye?
She's all right.
What are you gonna do tonight?
Oh, Lena's coming over to stay.
And her mom?
She can't stand her.
Besides, her boyfriend's over.
It'll be better for her over here.
I don't know.
We'll play some video games.
You say hi to her for me, okay?
I've always liked her.
She's doing all right?
She says she doesn't want to die a virgin.
Guess it's too late for that.
Dad, don't cry.
I'm sorry.
Because you're gonna make me cry, and I did my makeup perfect.
I'm sorry. I miss you.
I miss you too, Dad.
J.J.
J.J., you have to let your friend in downstairs.
Here comes Morticia Addams.
Yeah.
Hurry up, J.J.
Hi.
She's locked out downstairs, honey.
The doorman's not there.
You're gonna have to hurry up before something happens to her.
Go on.
She's downstairs.
See ya, hon.
Hon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look, you should not be upsetting her like that.
How can you be so selfish?
Seriously.
You gonna be angry still?
Now?
I didn't leave.
It was you that didn't stay.
II didn't stay?
Who ran off with the teenager?
I didn't run off.
It was you.
It was your pride.
If you would've just hung in there, everything would have been different.
Yeah, different.
I'll tell you different.
Yeah, tell me.
Your daughter would have had a father instead of some guy who didn't even really care about her.
I cared!
Never.
- I-
- When?
I cared.
I didn't want to leave.
I'm a guy that sticks.
It was you that didn't want me.
I... I was...
I was so, so confused.
And you just had to be a little more patient with me, but you were too scared.
You were-you were too anxious.
Anxious?
What-what-you know what?
You need to just to grow the fuck up.
Grow up!
You think...
You think I love her more than I love you?
You think I love my family...
Calm down!
Calm the fuck down!
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay, stay, stay, stay.
No!
Don't go.
How could you?
How could you?
Skye.
I need to speak to my mother!
Okay, but you don't understand.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Hi, Mom.
What's the matter?
I'm so glad you called.
He's such a jerk.
He was just telling her that he loves her.
Doesn't he know how much it hurts me?
And that bitch, she was just looking at me.
She was just laughing at me.
Well, was she at your house?
No, it was on the phone.
It was on Skype.
She's so ugly.
How can he be with such a woman?
It's all right.
He's with you now.
That's what matters.
I can't take him sometimes, Mom.
I can't help it.
The whole system.
I don't believe in anything that's going on.
And honestly,
I just can't stand all this, and I don't want to believe all what's going on.
I'm still gonna be hanging on, you know, the fact that, that you know, I mean...
I know that the world, that the Chinese had an atomic explosion 5,000 years ago.
I know that the world will stay.
If we perish, okay, we perish.
But then we live on as well, so we live on.
But I'm just so angry at all of this, and I can just barely, barely talk about it.
I want to scream at those fuckers,
All those politicians and all those rules and the PC world.
And, you know, I mean, look at this smoking.
I can't even smoke any more.
What's the matter with me?
You know, you can't smoke.
You can't smoke in your own house.
You know, people denounce you.
If you throw a butt on the ground, you have to pay 50 quid.
It's outrageous.
I mean, what the fuck has the world come to, you know?
I'm just, you know,
I'm just so upset.
Don't get upset now, Mom.
Really, please.
Deep down, you're at peace in your heart.
I know, it's...
You've done the right things.
You've done your art.
You've done everything that you can possibly do to have... to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed.
And I'm proud of you.
And I don't want to see you sad.
I don't want to see you upset.
I don't want to see you... you know,
I want to remember you happy.
I want to remember you with a big smile on your face and your little green eyes and your little grin.
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you.
I love you so much, Mom.
Yes, I love you.
- Good-bye.
- I love you.
Thank you for being my mom.
Just transcend that.
Just go to another sphere.
Yeah.
And we'll be all right.
Yeah, a better sphere.
Thank you for being my mom.
I love you.
Hey, Javi.
Javi.
Yo, it's Cisco.
Oh, God.
Oh, right.
You scared me for a second.
Cisco!
What are you doing here?
Hey.
Hey, brother.
Good to see you.
Yeah, good to see you.
Come here.
Why didn't you use the front door?
You're gonna get yourself killed doing that.
Oh, shit.
I don't believe it.
No, I can't either, man.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Yeah, man. Get him a chair.
Here. Have a seat.
Thanks.
Tempting fate tonight.
What a surprise.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
You want something?
You want a-we've got brandy.
Some water.
Yeah, please.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Sticking with it?
Guess we're all here.
Want to look death in the eyes.
Looking good, buddy.
Good, good.
- Salud.
- Salud.
- To end times.
- To old friends.
How much time you got?
2 years, 22 days.
23 days.
Awesome.
That's awesome.
And you?
Well, if things weren't the way they are,
I'd have 20 years end of next month.
- 20 years.
- Yeah.
If things weren't the way they are.
Yeah, well, you know, if we ain't gonna get high now, we're never getting high.
Why not?
Why?
Have you got a good enough reason to get high?
Tell me.
I'll get high with you.
How about... how about, like, the ending of the world?
No.
Not good enough.
The world's been ending ever since it started, man.
You know, we've been ending ever since we were born.
Don't take that shit too seriously.
- I don't.
- Good.
I'm not sure I can take this rap right now, man.
What rap?
I don't know.
I just feel you winding up a little bit.
Who, me?
I'm not winding up.
I'm sitting here with a fucking choice, man.
You know, the choice is for me,
I mean, I don't care.
You can get high right there.
You know, I won't judge.
I don't give a shit, you know.
I would prefer you didn't, but, for me, I feel like,
I just feel like
I got a choice, you know?
I could shoot some dope, go out nodding, or go out eyes wide open.
You know, see the fucking light show.
I mean, what the fuck is that gonna look like, you know?
The end of the world, the end of the dream.
The end of-I want to see it.
I want to see it.
I want to fucking be wide awake.
So that's the choice.
Yeah, I'm not sure I want to.
What's going on changes everything.
It does, and it doesn't.
Tell me.
For me, I just think it changes a lot, but I got to stay true to... for me, I just feel like
I got to stay true to who I've been.
The good stuff.
Oh, shit, you guys are getting heavy.
I just want to get laid, you know?
You just want to get laid?
Yeah.
You just want to get laid?
Come here.
You're gonna get your wish.
Get it while you can, right?
Good to know what you want.
Got to get off some way tonight.
And may I... this is not a rap.
- It's a suggestion.
- Okay.
If I may humbly offer this suggestion to you, my junkie brother, right, who I've been through everything with?
Yes.
I'm listening.
Don't pick up a minute before the end of the world.
Seems like as good time as any...
That's the choice, though.
That's the-you know?
I know.
That's the choice.
Yeah, I know.
Let's watch the light show, man.
We were walking home from this meeting, and we walked by here, and I see the light on, right?
And I'm like, "I wonder if these guys are still here."
Haven't thought of them in fucking years, man.
This used to be my family.
This was like, you know, my brother, my sisters, like my family.
I saw the lights on.
So I ring the buzzer, and Javi answers the fucking door, and they're right in the chairs where I fucking left them, you know?
And so come to be of service over there, be of service here, whatever.
I don't know.
If some idiot comes in and needs another idiot,
I figured I'd be here.
And who walks in?
You're that idiot.
It's a miracle.
It's a fucking miracle.
It's not a miracle.
No, there's something going on.
Why are you here?
Why did you come through the fucking window?
Just, you know...
I haven't seen you in how long?
- A long time.
- Long time.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Long time.
You know,
I just think, you know... it's not...
I just been thinking about, you know, the past and friends, and I just felt the need to drop by?
And so I'm not, you know...
I don't know.
I got to go, though.
You got to?
Yeah, no, I can't, because Skye's... no, Skye's at home.
You know, she's by herself.
You gonna go right home, though?
Yeah, I got to go.
I mean, go right home.
Just... it's dangerous out there.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it feels-
I don't know.
It's weird out there.
But no. I got to go, okay?
I'll walk you out.
Listen. I love you, buddy.
I love you too.
Use the front door like a normal person.
Glad we saw you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Yeah.
All right. Thanks, man.
Hey, Cisco.
Yeah?
What if they're wrong?
Think about it.
Okay, I'm thinking.
All right, buddy.
Love you.
Take care. Thanks.
Hey Javi?
Yeah?
He didn't...
No, no, no.
He didn't get nothing.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
He better not.
He's better just the way he is.
Right, right.
No, I'm sure. I'm honest.
You wouldn't lie, what... being a drug dealer and everything.
I would not.
- All right.
- He didn't.
What'd I say?
Go easy.

Cisco.
Where were you?
I just went out on the streets to see what was going on.
I forgot my keys.
I didn't mean what I said.
I was just trying to get her to understand.
She's a hard case.
You're not like her.
That's one of the reasons
I love you.
Forgive me.
Come inside me.
How could you?
Let me have it.
It's mine.
No.
Give it to me.
No!
I want it.
How could you?
Come on.
Give it to me.
All right.
Come on, we'll... we'll throw it out together.
You're hurting me!
This is fantastic.
Also the serpent... which represents the dynamic of life... the serpent can shed its skin to be born again, and so represents the power of life to throw off death and represents the bondage of life to time.
It's the dynamic of life and consciousness in the field of temporal pairs of opposites... birth, death and all that.
And life goes on through it.
It's been turned into the negative principle in our tradition, as though our tradition were against life.
And so, since... since our tradition is against life, well, the deity himself is against life.
And you have a deity who's talking about supernatural grace and virtue and all, but life is something to be, as it were, despised instead of celebrated and a body as something awful rather than awesome.
Cisco!
Cisco, come to me, please!
What's happening?
What's that?
I'm here.
Hold on to me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me!
I am.
Don't be scared.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
Who makes this whole tub run?
Ain't it us, guys?
Yeah!
Well, then, we belong, don't we?
We belong and they don't, that's all.
As far as this being hell, aw, nuts, you lost your nerve.
That's what.
This is a man's job, get me?
It belongs.
It runs this tub.
No stiffs need apply.
We aren't stiffs, see?
What comes down to a ultra feeling,
I mean, the ultra feeling that love, family is important.
Hey, have you ever heard of this?
What are we gonna do when it's 4:44?
But I can see that deep down you're at peace in your heart.
You've done the right things.
You've done your art.
You've done everything that you can possibly do to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed.
And this is very difficult to explain, okay?
In those few minutes, you see the face of every living creature in this world, okay?
In the minute.
At the same time, you see the whole face of billions of creatures.
And I'm not talking just people:
Animals, insects, birds, worms, snails, you know, all of them.
You can see.
We're together.
I'm-I'm here.
I'm here. Don't be afraid.
We're here together.
I'm gonna smoke my cigarette, and I'm gonna die.
There's gonna be a really big light, Cisco.
But don't be afraid of it.
I'm not afraid.
It's our love.
I'm not afraid.
It's our wisdom.
We're going together towards this big light.
We're going together towards the big light, Cisco.
My heart against your heart, and together, we're taking all beings with us.
And we're protecting them, and we're loving them, and we're taking them with us.
And we have each other.
And we surrender completely to God.
And you're protected.
And we're together, and we're going together.
And all we have is right now.
All we have is each other.
All we have is each other.
I love you.
And we're angels already.

Are you the guys from Washington?
You get many other visitors out here?
How long you been on-site?
Since this morning.
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.
How come nobody spotted it before?
It's really not that surprising.
This landscape's changing all the time.
You got any idea what this thing is exactly?
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.
I don't think so.
You know, we don't have the equipment for a job like this.
How long before we can start craning it out?
I don't think you quite understand.
You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane.
Base, we're in.
What is this?
Careful.
Lieutenant!
What is it?
My God.
Base, get me a line to the Colonel.
It's 3:00 a.m., sir.
I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.
Open it!
Quickly, before he...
It has taken me a long time to find this place.
You should be commended.
Help him up.
I think that you are a man of great vision.
And, in this way, we are much alike.
I am nothing like you.
No, of course, but what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.
What you seek is just a legend.
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?
The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin's treasure room.
It is not something one buries.
But I think it is close, yes?
I cannot help you.
No. But maybe you can help your village.
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?
I have no need for them to die.
Yggdrasil.
Tree of the world.
Guardian of wisdom.
And fate, also.
And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert.
You have never seen this, have you?
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.
Exactly.
Give the order to open fire.
Fool!
You cannot control the power you hold.
You will burn!
I already have.
O'Connell, Michael.
Kaminsky, Henry.
Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.
Rogers, Steven.
It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?
Nope.
Rogers.
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.
You'd be ineligible on your asthma alone.
Is there anything you can do?
I'm doing it.
I'm saving your life.
War continues to ravage Europe.
But help is on the way.
Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country.
Even little Timmy is doing his part
collecting scrap metal.
Nice work, Timmy!
Who cares?
Play the movie already!
Hey, you wanna show some respect?
Meanwhile, overseas,
our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price
of freedom is never too high.
Let's go! Get on with it!
Hey, just start the cartoon!
Hey, you wanna shut up?
Together with Allied forces, we'll face any threat,
no matter the size.
You just don't know when to give up, do you?
I can do this all day.
Hey!
Pick on someone your own size.
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.
I had him on the ropes.
How many times is this?
You're from Paramus now?
You know it's illegal to lie on the enlistment form.
And seriously, Jersey?
You get your orders?
The 107th.
Sergeant James Barnes, shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.
I should be going.
Come on, man.
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.
Why? Where are we going?
The future.
I don't see what the problem is.
You're about to be the last eligible man in New York.
You know there's three and a half million women here?
Well, I'd settle for just one.
Good thing I took care of that.
Hey, Bucky!
What'd you tell her about me?
Only the good stuff.
Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion
and the World of Tomorrow.
A greater world. A better world.
Oh, my God! It's starting!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Howard Stark!
I love you, Howard!
Ladies and gentlemen,
what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile
won't even have to touch the ground at all?
Yes. Thanks, Mandy.
With Stark Gravitic
Reversion Technology
you'll be able to do just that.
Holy cow.
I did say a few years, didn't I?
Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls...
Come on, soldier.
Come on. You're kind of missing the point of a double date.
We're taking the girls dancing.
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.
You're really going to do this again?
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.
As who, Steve from Ohio?
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.
Look, I know you don't think I can do this.
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?
Collect scrap metal in my little red wagon?
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.
I got no right to do any less than them.
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?
Yes, we are.
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.
How can I?
You're taking all the stupid with you.
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.
Be careful.
Don't win the war till I get there!
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.
Wait here.
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.
Thank you.
So, you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.
Excuse me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine.
I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Steve Rogers.
Where are you from?
Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway.
Before that, Germany.
- This troubles you?
- No.
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Is it New Haven?
Or Paramus?
Five exams in five different cities.
That might not be the right file.
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.
It's the five tries.
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?
Is this a test?
Yes.
I don't want to kill anyone.
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.
Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war.
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.
I can offer you a chance.
Only a chance.
- I'll take it.
- Good.
So where is the little guy from? Actually?
Brooklyn.
Congratulations, soldier.
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?
My machine requires the most delicate calibration.
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.
Are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for transference?
With this artifact
I am certain of nothing.
I fear it may not work at all.
Twenty percent.
Forty.
Sixty.
Stabilizing at 70%.
I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor.
What was that?
I must congratulate you, Arnim.
Your designs do not disappoint.
Though they may require some slight reinforcement.
The exchange is stable.
Amazing!
The energy we have just collected could power my designs.
All my designs.
This will change the war.
Dr. Zola, this will change the world.
Ready, exercise!
Recruits, attention!
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.
I supervise all operations for this division.
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?
I thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.
What's your name, soldier?
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.
Step forward, Hodge.
Put your right foot forward.
We gonna wrassle?
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.
Agent Carter!
Colonel Phillips.
I can see that you are breaking in the candidates. That's good!
Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention till somebody comes tells you what to do.
Yes, sir!
General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons, but they are won by men.
We are going to win this war because we have the best men.
And because they are going to get better.
Much better.
The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort
made up of the best minds in the free world.
Our goal is to create the best army in history.
But every army starts with one man.
Rogers! Get off of there!
At the end of this week, we will choose that man.
He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier.
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.
Pick up the pace, ladies!
Let's go, let's go! Double time!
Come on! Faster! Faster!
Move! Move!
Squad, halt!
That flag means we're only at the halfway point.
First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter.
Move, move!
Come on! Get up there!
If that's all you got, this army's in trouble!
Get up there, Hodge!
Come on! Get up there!
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!
Let's go! Get back into formation!
Rogers! I said fall in!
Thank you, sir.
Faster, ladies! Come on.
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.
Move it!
You're not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.
When you brought a 90-pound asthmatic onto my army base,
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."
Maybe he'd be useful to you, like a gerbil.
I never thought you'd pick him.
Up.
You stick a needle in that kid's arm, it's gonna go right through him.
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.
He's making me cry.
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
Do you know how long it took to set up this project?
All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.
You win wars with guts.
Grenade!
Get away!
Get back!
It was a dummy grenade.
All clear. Back in formation.
Is this a test?
He's still skinny.
- May I?
- Yeah.
Can't sleep?
I got the jitters, I guess.
Me, too.
Can I ask you a question?
Just one?
Why me?
I suppose that is the only question that matters.
This is from Augsburg. My city.
So many people forget that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own.
You know, after the last war, my people struggled.
They felt weak. They felt small.
And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags.
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.
And he says, "You."
He says, "You will make us strong."
Well, I am not interested.
So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division.
A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt.
Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.
And he is ambitious.
He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth.
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth,
left here by the gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man.
So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.
Schmidt must become that superior man.
Did it make him stronger?
Yes.
But there were other effects.
The serum was not ready.
But more important, the man.
The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so good becomes great.
Bad becomes worse.
This is why you were chosen.
Because a strong man who has known power all his life may lose respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength.
And knows compassion.
Thanks. I think.
Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.
That you will stay who you are.
Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.
To the little guys.
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.
All right. We'll drink it after.
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.
Is there something in particular you need?
I understand you found him.
See for yourself.
You disapprove.
I just don't see why you need concern yourself.
I can't imagine he will succeed.
Again.
His serum is the Allies' only defense against this power we now possess.
If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.
Shall I give the order?
It has been given.
Good.
Dr. Zola!
What do you think?
A masterpiece.
I know this neighborhood.
I got beat up in that alley.
And that parking lot.
And behind that diner.
Did you have something against running away?
You start running, they'll never let you stop.
You stand up, you push back.
They can't say no forever, right?
I know a little of what that's like, to have every door shut in your face.
I guess I just don't know why you'd want to join the Army if you were a beautiful dame.
Or a... A woman.
An agent. Not a dame.
You are beautiful, but...
You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.
Women aren't exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.
You must have danced.
Well, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying.
And the past few years, it just didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.
For what?
The right partner.
This way.
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.
Wonderful weather this morning, isn't it?
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.
Good morning.
Please, not now.
Are you ready?
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie, and your hat.
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
We needed access to the city's power grid.
Of course, if you'd given me the generators I requisitioned...
A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.
This is...
Fred Clemson, State Department.
If this project of yours comes through, we'd like to see it used for something other than headlines.
Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.
Comfortable?
It's a little big.
You save me any of that schnapps?
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.
Next time.
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we'll ever be.
Agent Carter?
Don't you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.
Do you hear me? Is this on?
Ladies and gentlemen,
today we take not another step towards annihilation,
but the first step
on the path to peace.
We begin with a series of microinjections into
the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion
will cause immediate cellular change.
And then, to stimulate growth,
the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.
That wasn't so bad.
That was penicillin.
Serum infusion beginning in five,
four, three, two, one.
Now, Mr. Stark.
Steven? Can you hear me?
It's probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?
We will proceed.
That's 10%.
Twenty percent.
Thirty.
That's 40%.
Vital signs are normal.
That's 50%.
Sixty.
Seventy.
Steven!
- Steven!
- Shut it down!
Shut it down!
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!
No!
Don't! I can do this!
Eighty.
Ninety.
That's 100%.
Mr. Stark?
Steven. Steven.
The son of a bitch did it.
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.
I think we did it.
You actually did it.
How do you feel?
Taller.
You look taller.
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?
I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Thank you, sir.
Stop him!
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?
Hey, this guy's been shot!
I had him!
Sorry!
I'm sorry!
No! No! Not my son!
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!
Get back!
Let me go!
Let go of my son!
Don't hurt him!
Wait, don't! Don't!
No! Don't!
Go get him! I can swim!
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.
Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.
Hail Hydra.
The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.
He funds your research because you promised him weapons.
You serve at his pleasure.
He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.
I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.
You think this is about appearances?
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.
And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.
The Führer feels... How does he put it?
"The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"
Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work.
Let me show you.
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich, but he cannot feed his armies for a month.
His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe, but still he is no closer to achieving his goals.
And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic?
Science. But I understand your confusion.
Great power has always baffled primitive men.
Hydra is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke, wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess, all in a matter of hours.
Your enemies?
My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.
Quite simply, gentlemen,
I have harnessed the power of the gods.
Thank you, Schmidt.
For what?
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
Berlin is on this map!
So it is.
You will be punished for your insolence!
You will be brought before the Führer himself!
Schmidt...
My apologies, Doctor, but we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.
Hail Hydra.
Hail Hydra!
Hail Hydra!
Think you got enough?
Any hope of reproducing the program is locked in your genetic code.
But without Dr. Erskine, it would take years.
He deserved more than this.
If it could work only once, he'd be proud it was you.
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Great. Why don't we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?
What have we got here?
Speaking modestly, I'm the best mechanical engineer in this country.
But I don't know what's inside this thing or how it works.
We're not even close to this technology.
- Then who is?
- Hydra.
I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.
Hydra is practically a cult.
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.
So, what are you going to do about it?
I spoke to the President this morning.
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.
You, too, Stark.
We're flying to London tonight.
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.
The serum worked.
I asked for an army and all I got was you.
You are not enough.
With all due respect to the Colonel,
I think we may be missing the point.
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.
Paper.
The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands.
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab.
Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?
Sir, that's all I want.
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.
I don't know if I can do this.
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.
You're an American hero.
It's just not how I pictured getting there.
The Senator has got a lot of pull up on the Hill.
You play ball with us, you'll be leading your own platoon in no time.
Take the shield.
Go.
Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?
Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank.
But there's still a way all of us can fight.
Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?
Series E Defense Bonds.
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.
Who will campaign door-to-door for America?
Carry the flag shore to shore for America?
From Hoboken to Spokane
The star-spangled man with a plan
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.
We can't ignore there's a threat and a war we must win
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.
Who'll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin?
Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?
Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?
Who's here to prove that we can?
The star-spangled man with a plan
We all know this is about trying to win the war.
We can't do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents.
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love.
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.
Stalwart and steady and true
Forceful and ready to defend
the red, white, and blue
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?
Far as an eagle will soar
Who's making Adolf afraid to step out of his box?
He knows what we're fighting for
Who waked the giant that napped in America?
We know it's no one but Captain America
Hi.
Who'll finish what they began?
Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?
The star-spangled man
with a
plan!
How many of you are ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?
Okay.
I need a volunteer.
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?
Bring back the girls!
I think they only know the one song, but
I'll see what I can do.
You do that, sweetheart.
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!
Come on, guys, we're all on the same team here.
Hey, Captain! Sign this!
Bring back the girls!
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.
Hello, Steve.
Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
Officially, I'm not here at all.
That was quite a performance.
Yeah.
I had to improvise a little bit.
The crowds I'm used to are usually more twelve.
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."
Bond sales take a 10% bump in every state I visit.
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?
At least he's got me doing this.
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.
And these are your only two options?
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?
You were meant for more than this, you know.
What?
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines, serving my country.
I finally got everything I wanted and I'm wearing tights.
They look like they've been through hell.
These men more than most.
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him, and less than 50 returned.
Your audience contained what was left of the 107th.
The rest were killed or captured.
The 107th?
What?
Come on.
Colonel Phillips.
Well, if it isn't the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.
What's your plan today?
I need the casualty list from Azzano.
You don't get to give me orders, son.
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.
You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won't enjoy.
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
I can spell.
I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count.
But the name does sound familiar.
I'm sorry.
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?
Yes, it's called "winning the war."
But if you know where they are, why not at least...
They're 30 miles behind the lines through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.
We'd lose more men than we'd save.
But I don't expect you to understand that because you're a chorus girl.
I think I understand just fine.
Well, then understand it somewhere else.
If I read the posters correctly, you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.
Yes, sir. I do.
If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?
If that's what it takes.
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.
You don't know that.
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...
By the time he's done that, it could be too late.
Steve!
You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?
Every word.
Then you got to let me go.
I can do more than that.
On stage, girls. Five minutes!
Where's my helmet?
Anyone seen Rogers?
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges.
It's a factory of some kind.
We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.
Just get me as close as you can.
You two are gonna be in a lot of trouble when you land.
And you won't?
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.
They will undoubtedly shoot back.
Well, let's hope it's good for something.
Agent Carter?
If we're not in too much of a hurry,
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late-night fondue.
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.
So, are you two... Do you... fondue?
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.
Are you sure this thing works?
It's been tested more than you, pal.
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing around and get the hell out of here!
You can't give me orders!
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!
As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.
Increase the output by 60% and see to it our other facilities do the same.
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.
There are always more workers.
Not now!
You know, Fritz, one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.
Fellas.
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm Captain America.
I beg your pardon?
What, are we taking everybody?
I'm from Fresno, Ace.
Is there anybody else? I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.
There's an isolation ward in the factory, but no one's ever come back from it.
All right.
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.
Get out fast and give 'em hell.
I'll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.
Wait. You know what you're doing?
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.
You know how to use that thing?
Okay.
What is happening?
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.
- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?
Get this thing going, Dugan!
I didn't know you spoke German.
Three semesters at Howard, switched to French, girls much cuter.
Didn't ask for the resume.
- On your left!
- Up top!
No, no! What are you doing?
Our forces are outmatched.
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.
Bucky?
Oh, my God.
- Is that...
- It's me.
- It's Steve.
- Steve?
- Come on.
- Steve.
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were smaller.
Come on.
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.
- Did it hurt?
- A little.
Is this permanent?
So far.
Captain America!
How exciting!
I am a great fan of your films!
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.
Not exactly an improvement, but still, impressive.
You've got no idea.
Haven't I?
No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see, I was his greatest success!
You don't have one of those, do you?
You are deluded, Captain.
You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality, you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind.
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.
Without fear!
Then how come you're running?
Come on, let's go. Up.
Sir? Are we going to the roof?
What about me?
Where will I sit?
Not a scratch, Doctor.
Not a scratch.
Let's go. One at a time.
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!
No! Not without you!
Hell.
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third.
Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful.
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.
The last surveillance flight is back.
No sign of activity.
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
I can't touch Stark.
He's rich and he's the Army's number one weapons contractor.
You are neither one.
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.
And now America's golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead
'cause you had a crush.
It wasn't that. I had faith.
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.
What the hell's going on out there?
Look who it is!
Some of these men need medical attention.
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
That won't be necessary.
Yes, sir.
Faith, huh?
You're late.
Couldn't call my ride.
Hey!
Let's hear it for Captain America!
I am honored to present this medal for valor to my personal friend, Captain America!
Captain America!
Captain, that's your cue!
I thought he'd be taller.
The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.
And the sixth one was about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.
I just got a quick look.
Well, nobody's perfect.
These are the weapon factories we know about.
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn't on this map.
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.
I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.
What about us?
We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.
We're already putting together the best men.
With all due respect, sir, so am I.
So, let's get this straight.
We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?
Pretty much.
Sounds rather fun, actually.
I'm in.
We're in.
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.
What's that?
Open a tab.
Well, that was easy.
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?
See? I told you.
They're all idiots.
How about you?
You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?
Hell, no.
That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight.
I'm following him.
But you're keeping the outfit, right?
You know what?
It's kind of growing on me.
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.
Ma'am.
Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?
Sounds good.
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.
You don't like music?
I do, actually.
I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.
Then what are we waiting for?
The right partner.
0800, Captain.
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.
I'm invisible.
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.
Emission signature is unusual.
Alpha and beta ray neutral.
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.
Seems harmless enough.
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.
Write that down.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.
He's in with Colonel Phillips.
Of course, you're welcome to wait.
I read about what you did.
Oh, the... Yeah.
Well, that's, you know.
Just doing what needed to be done.
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.
Really, it's not a big deal.
Tell that to their wives.
I don't think they were all married.
You're a hero.
Well, that depends on the definition, really.
The women of America, they owe you their thanks.
And seeing as they're not here...
Captain!
We're ready for you, if you're not otherwise occupied.
Agent Carter, wait.
Looks like finding a partner wasn't that hard after all.
Peggy, that's not what you thought it was.
I don't think anything, Captain, not one thing.
You always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are, just like all the rest.
Well, what about you and Stark?
How do I know you two haven't been fondue-ing?
You still don't know a bloody thing about women.
Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.
The moment you think you know what's going on in a woman's head is the moment your goose is well and truly cooked.
Me, I concentrate on work, which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed.
Carbon polymer.
Should withstand your average German bayonet.
Although Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife.
I hear you're kind of attached.
It's handier than you might think.
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.
This one's fun.
She's been fitted with electrical relays that allow you to...
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.
It's stronger than steel and a third the weight.
It's completely vibration absorbent.
How come it's not standard issue?
That's the rarest metal on Earth.
What you're holding there, that's all we've got.
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.
What do you think?
Yes, I think it works.
I had some ideas about the uniform.
Whatever you want, pal.
You are failing!
We are close to an offensive that will shake the planet, yet we are continually delayed because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!
This is hardly my area of expertise.
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.
Finish your mission, Doctor, before the American finishes his.
Sir!
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.
We fought to the last man.
Evidently not.
Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?
Yeah, and I threw up?
This isn't payback, is it?
Now why would I do that?
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.
Let's get going, because they're moving like the devil.
We only got about a 10-second window.
You miss that window, we're bugs on a windshield.
Mind the gap.
Better get moving, bugs!
Stop him! Fire again!
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.
Get down!
Fire again!
Kill him! Now!
Bucky!
Hang on!
Grab my hand!
Sit down.
- What is this?
- Steak.
What is in it?
Cow.
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?
I don't eat meat.
Why not?
It disagrees with me.
How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?
Every Hydra agent that we've tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you.
So, here is my brilliant theory.
You want to live.
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
I bought you dinner.
"Given the valuable information he has provided
"and in exchange for his full cooperation,
"Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland"?
I sent that message to Washington this morning, of course it was encoded.
You guys haven't broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.
Schmidt will know this is a lie.
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.
And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers' closest friend, so I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.
It's you or Schmidt.
It's just the hand you've been dealt.
Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.
Only the world itself will satisfy him.
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?
What?
The sanity of the plan is of no consequence.
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!
What's his target?
His target is everywhere.
Tomorrow,
Hydra will stand master of the world,
borne to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.
Our enemies' weapons will be powerless against us.
If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them!
If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place.
Hail Hydra.
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.
Please wait for the all-clear.
Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice.
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.
Dr. Erskine said that the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles, it would affect my cells.
Create a protective system of regeneration and healing.
Which means
I can't get drunk.
Did you know that?
Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.
He thought it could be one of the side effects.
It wasn't your fault.
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.
Then you know that's not true.
You did everything you could.
Did you believe in your friend?
Did you respect him?
Then stop blaming yourself.
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.
He damn well must have thought you were worth it.
I'm going after Schmidt.
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.
You won't be alone.
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god, and he's willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.
Schmidt's working with powers beyond our capabilities.
He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.
How much time we got?
According to my new best friend, under 24 hours.
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.
So what are we supposed to do?
I mean, it's not like we can just knock on the front door.
Why not?
That's exactly what we're going to do.
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say, you do it better than anyone.
But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain.
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?
He told me you were insane.
He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.
But he gave you everything.
So, what made you so special?
Nothing.
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.
I can do this all day.
Of course you can, of course.
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.
So am I.
Rogers! You might need this!
Thanks!
We're in! Assault team, go!
Move out!
Move!
Keep your spacing!
Cut off one head, two more shall...
Let's go find two more!
You're late.
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.
Get in!
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!
Go get him.
I'm not kissing you!
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!
You could have the power of the gods!
Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations!
I have seen the future, Captain!
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!
What have you done?
No!
Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?
Captain Rogers, what is your...
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?
Peggy, Schmidt's dead!
What about the plane?
That's a little bit tougher to explain.
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.
There's not gonna be a safe landing.
But I can try and force it down.
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.
There's not enough time.
This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York.
I got to put her in the water.
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.
If I wait any longer, a lot of people are gonna die.
Peggy, this is my choice.
Peggy?
I'm here.
I'm gonna need a rain check on that dance.
All right.
A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.
You got it.
8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.
I'll show you how. Just be there.
We'll have the band play something slow.
I'd hate to step on your...
Steve?
Steve?
Steve?
To the Captain.
Sir?
Take us to the next grid point.
But there's no trace of wreckage.
And the energy signature stops here.
Just keep looking.
Curve ball, high and outside for ball one.
So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.
And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat,
this fellow's capable of making it a brand-new game again.
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field.
The Phillies have managed to tie it up at 4-4.
But the Dodgers have three men on.
Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month.
Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here to return the favor?
Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.
Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.
Three runs will score.
Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.
Here comes the relay, but they won't get him.
Good morning.
Or should I say afternoon?
Where am I?
You're in a recovery room in New York City.
The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!
Everyone is on their feet.
What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.
Where am I really?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
The game.
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.
Now, I'm going to ask you again.
Where am I?
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?
Captain Rogers, wait!
All agents, code 13!
I repeat. All agents, code 13!
At ease, soldier!
Look, I'm sorry about that little show back there, but we thought it best to break it to you slowly.
Break what?
You've been asleep, Cap.
For almost 70 years.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I just...
I had a date.
Trouble sleeping?
You're here with a mission, sir?
I am.
Trying to get me back in the world?
Trying to save it.
You think you're the only hero in the world?
Gentlemen?
You're up.
Got a mean swing.
So, where is this renowned father? will father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps he cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
Very quick.
Move.
Some other dog beat us to the treasure.
Hear that?
No, please.
Mercy.
I will serve you.
Abelar, does it still exist?
Abelar?
Ah, yes.
Ruled by a queen, Eldoria.
She has passed on.
Her eldest... eldest child Ma'at is queen now.
Really?
I won't harm the queen, but I will make you do with her seed.
Not that it matters now.
I... I was wondering...
- how... how your enemies...
- To dust.
That will sting.
And now?
And now, say, "I won't feel anything except a little sting."
Tanis.
Tanis.
Are you listening to me?
- Sister.
- It is upon us, your dream.
It's happening.
After all of these years, the Sorceress has somehow returned from the dead.
Levana.
Please don't go.
Go, Lenor.
Please, find safety.
All of you leave at once.
I will alert the General,
Your Highness.
And we must find he who saved us before.
The Mercenary?
Your father.
But, our father is dead.
He died saving Abelar from the Sorceress.
Your father is not mine.
I was sired by the king but... you...
...you were by this mercenary.
Mother said you were the king's child to protect you.
You must leave the past behind.
Our kingdom needs us now.
Kingdom Bush is not my father?
No, but he who is lives.
If we so be separated mother said this will lead you to him. with this token, he will know you and you shall know him.
And this will help you to understand the sorcery.
My Queen.
They are within the palace,
Your Majesty.
You must come now.
You have to go.
No, come with us.
My Queen, you both have a long time to struggle.
I've trained you well,
Your Highness.
You are ready for what comes.
Stand. we can make sure of your safety if you follow this hall.
It will lead you out of the palace.
But what about you?
My duty is to remain here, Kara.
No.
If you stay, then so will I.
You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.
The Royals will scheme to save their skins. we will be left to fend for ourselves and not always with the truth.
They have no regard for us.
But I am sworn to...
You have sworn to love me, Dernier or was that just to weaken my will.
I love you.
Then save us my love.
- I must kill the infected.
- Leave her. She's a friend.
It's your wish.
There, it leads to a quay where our boat waits.
- It will take you to Durris.
- Durris?
An outlaw city?
If he still lives the people there will know his whereabouts.
Tanis,
I'm find remember what I said.
If we so be separated, you must find him. we've run out of time.
Run, Tanis.
- But sister.
- Hush.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
They count on us, Tanis.
- I can't do this alone.
- You must.
Go. Now.
I command you.
Do not look back...
...or rest.
It's been what, 20 years? where's your mother's lover? what was his name again?
It seems to have slipped my mind.
He has not slipped mine. why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.
I must have thought of a million different ways to make you and your mother suffer, but nothing was ever terrible enough.
I mean, how do you repay someone who buried you alive for 20 years?
Nothing smelled like life,
Your Highness.
You must be wondering how is it she is back looking so wonderfully restored.
Clearly, we watched your destruction.
Clearly, you shouldn't have given the final rights to a high priest with designs on your throat.
A pity he perished with some mysterious plague upon his return. who knows what lives in dust?
And who are you?
Go, go.
- where is my seat, Your Highness?
- I'm not sure.
Kill her.
Get the girl.
The palace is lost.
- The Queen is dead?
- Or worse. what are they?
Vampires.
But we will not die tonight.
I could fight harder.
You leave the killing to me. what is to become of us now or the kingdom?
My master is the son of a priest.
But, there is always a need for a pretty servant, and there is one against me as well.
- what is it?
- Hush, hush. why the guards they are so daunting?
They're trying to kill us. what?
Your blood.
It is read.
- It's my fault.
- No.
On your life run.
I have always loved you.
And who dies first.
I will.
And now, a ladder across the Abyss that I might free my father.
In my stead, you will awaken my seed.
She is the true daughter of my race, and though half human, she will be human no more.
Ah, Denier.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You used me. what?
No, I loved you.
Really?
Yes, right,
I was using you, Dernier.
You are evil.
Becoming a vampire isn't even the worst of me.
That and more.
Are you going to kill me now?
Bite my throat, drain me of my blood?
I want you.
I could soothe you, Dernier.
You could use someone like me for a slave.
I have too much over the past.
I will bring victims to you to fulfill whatever dark fantasies you have.
I will do whatever
I have to do for you?
You are a monster.
I will bow to you, Kara.
Kara, bow to her.
Life takes many forms in many worlds and she's in her final metamorphosis, her chrysalis. why me?
You are special.
But you've always known that.
Special in a way that no one else could see until it was too late.
And even as a child, you have always been cunning, intelligent, depraved.
You have tried to blend in or be a human, safe, but even as a child you knew you were different, filled with dark corruptness.
Are you ready to be free?
You're free now but not yet fully transformed.
I have pity for those who can walk in the curse of light and among these creatures. we have much more work to do before we can be safe.
I sent the princess to the reefs.
If she's dust, find her.
Know what she's plotting, and most importantly with whom. why me?
Because she will know and trust you when she's most vulnerable.
And if I refuse?
You've hungered for this day when you could be who you are and what you are to let those dark urges free.
Mother said this will lead you to him. with this token he will know you and you shall know him, and this will help you to understand the sorcery.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
My princess.
You shouldn't have been wearing this?
Please.
- You cheated Dog.
- what?
Go weep to the gods.
You will die.
I shall cleave your thick ugly faces.
No dog cheats me and lives.
Thankfully, I'm not a dog but I do like to cheat.
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you like a bitch pup.
Holy shit.
I want this man.
She wants me.
I'll tell you what, wench, let me kill this dog and then I will bed you so hard...
Somebody you want me. wench, you've diminished my reputation.
It could be diminished, sir? why bog me, did I do your mother, huh, or, uh, sister perhaps?
The last of it, the late great Abelar and how it came to be overcome.
- Sir.
- I mean no disrespect, lady.
I noticed your cloak.
It came from the palace guard.
So, it is.
Like yourself, I barely escaped these foul creatures.
I'm here to spread the word of what these eyes have seen.
- You've seen much.
- Aye.
In this one world.
That's why you're here.
You've seen far too much sir.
Brother and sister?
Different mothers but a common father.
And you say we were meant to find our father?
Exactly. And together we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia and return Abelar to the people.
Uh-huh.
So, Princess, you speak for the Royal House?
That is correct.
How much am I to be paid to save your precious Abelar?
Paid?
I didn't mention anything about a bounty. we do this because it's right
- and just and it's what we should...
- This sword will not be drawn until it received proper compensation.
You disappoint again.
Oh, my lady, one night in bed with me and...
I'm your sister.
Half.
How could I expect any nobility from a pig like you. wait.
Look, your tail holds a certain fancy, but I am in need of coin and I'm willing to take your word that there will be a bounty. what do you know about him? well, not much.
Nothing at all.
Nor a trickster?
Aye, but this trickster knows where our sister may be, and to her our dear father.
A sister? where?
About that bounty?
If your word proves true, then you shall have it.
I gave you my word.
That should be sufficient.
I am called Aedan.
And what are you doing here? what?
Can't a brother help his sister?
After five years?
No.
This comes with some terrible price.
You're not a woman with many an option.
There's a foul tempered undertaker and eventual traitor wanting to see you skinned at dawn.
And what is this act of brotherly love going to cost me?
It's more privilege than the price. we get to save Abelar.
I don't think I'm dressed appropriately.
Plus, of course, there is a bounty.
And where would you get real bounty?
From Abelar.
She's your sister.
But maybe a...
...little more. well, what is your name.
You would like to sit down and have a drink with me, huh?
Tell us the tale, sister.
A fortnight ago the Sorceress Xia captured Abelar.
My sister, the Queen, was murdered.
Xia?
Didn't father put that Devil wench down or is that another tall tale? well, clearly he didn't put her permanently down, thus creating an opportunity.
She's back and she's taking Abelar with sorcery. which is to say she's infested Abelar.
Don't you have any conversation for me?
You are so beautiful.
It's all Greek to me.
She will continue to feed, to spread her darkness until the next full moon rises.
- And then?
- Oh, this part is good.
Xia will open the doorway to the Nether worlds.
You were saying?
Thus ending our very existence.
It's all so dire.
You see, sister, there's no bounty too great for saving this world.
Say we fancy the idea for a moment.
And that there is this massive bounty in gold, of course.
Aye, what makes you think us three here can stop this Vampire Queen?
I told her we're lovers not fighters. when need to have a plan, something less daunting, more rewarding.
- I am at a loss.
- we should take the traditional action, and hire mercenaries, like our dear father.
Yes, yes, but we're under time constraints.
In only a fortnight the moon will be full.
- I have a thought.
- It was only a matter of time.
Malia, you will find father and see if he has any ideas on the matter, and I with what funds to princess has on her presently will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men, no, no, no, but the type with honor and courage enough to win back Abelar.
By the gods I've heard that there are experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria, precisely the type of warriors that we needs. So, the Princess... she can wait here at Durris for our return, you know, holding down the fortress
- sort of thing.
- Or let us split the funds you possess, give us both a chance to hire the best warriors we can find on our way.
Aye, that could work as well. well, sister?
You take me as a fool at your own peril.
You are both much less than I'd hoped.
At the prison I spoke to the magistrate and he gave me your recent histories,
- theft, assault, cheating, embezzling...
- Right.
- Pick pocket and street whore?
- I have never picked a pocket.
You're both are the lowest of character, but my sister was firm and we must find our father and you are my only hope. we'll need horses.
I can acquire them.
- Are there other brothers and sisters?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, she's a day's ride away in a village called Chiba
Agreed then to Chiba Village.
Our father still lives?
I suppose. Last summer he was carousing in the secret of Nobu.
That was years ago.
The dog is likely dead as a cock, though, rotting in some dungeon.
50,000 gold pieces.
50 and that's my final word.
And I suggest we seal this fast. what's going on, sir?
Having an adventure, sister?
- A bitch dog.
- Come to lose again?
It isn't long now.
An entire new world.
I use Xia's body as a conduct.
It's a doorway. what have you learned?
The princess seeks one like her father.
The warrior who helped with Mitadonia.
He can see us fall into the Abyss.
Reduce her to dust.
Should I kill them now, the Princess and these two fools?
Learn the whereabouts of this father.
As you wish.
I tried to find father once right here.
- what was it like?
- Ah, it was like this... except for people trying to kill me.
- It's early yet.
- Maybe they'll remember you.
Oh, Malia, they would if they were still alive.
I meant what was it like to see him?
I didn't see father.
I found Rajan, our half sister.
Stay put. what does Rajan do here as a trade?
You mean when she's not drunk or passed out?
Hello sister.
I have a wonderful opportunity for you.
No thank you.
It did not work out last time.
It's only because you lack a sense of humor. what do you think they seek?
This drink.
Sister told me great stories about father... although I thought she spoke of a hired mercenary sent to save Abelar.
That was before I knew he was my father.
The man who I thought was my father, the King, well he was killed by Xia.
You really want to know who father is, God's truth?
Yes.
Our father is the lowest form of cowardly dog, a man who takes advantage of wives or widows, sells out his cohorts for coin and runs from a real fight.
That's who father is. what's the matter?
You don't like the truth?
You married, have sons?
Luckily no.
They're not so bad to look at.
Your whores?
Rajan, say hello to your sisters.
- More family?
- And with your help, we four... will save Abelar before the full moon.
The full moon is six nights away.
Time is short.
Ho, an adventure.
Alana.
Alana?
I'd forgotten her.
She's all grown and ready to leave this stink hole.
Alana, your favorite uncle has returned.
Don't you remember me?
I remember.
As formidable as she is, the girl is but a girl.
I meant no offense, niece.
I taught her a few things in my days as emperor's assassin.
Yes, I can see.
Sir, this is the most serious and most dangerous mission.
It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.
The Vampire Queen.
- Yes, and it is not suitable for a child.
- You think I'd be afraid.
Look, it's time my Alana saw the world, had a few wild, bloody adventures.
And vampires and sorcery are all a part of that.
The truth is, she will love many and leave many more choking on their entrails.
A sister, heh?
And a princess no less.
Do you plan to rob her?
Give me a little credit.
This comes at a good time.
I was worried.
How so? with my adventuring and killing days were behind,
I wouldn't be able to give her proper parenting.
Oh, betting brutes, horrible wars, ghastly death, and it's all still ahead of you.
I am sure it's all with my daughter.
The gods must choose to smile upon me.
You would really cut my throat back there?
Of course, uncle.
Yours particularly.
Sweet girl. what of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?
Grandfather?
Our father?
Aye. He might crave one last good battle before setting down the sword?
- He's still killing?
- Oh, that rascal, his sword is always poised. want to meet the old dog?
Oh, let's be off.
There are kingdoms to save and men to bed.
I prefer wenches.
Then he lives? why not use your sorcery to destroy them all?
Sorcery hasn't been needed until the full moon, but it's now needed instead of your cold steel, Kara.
Her father was a great sorcerer callously taken by gods let alone by human yet this one day.
But how is that possible against their power?
Because there exists a breed of creatures who fears nothing.
So they can accomplish anything.
You describe a distinct human trait. we cannot chance these five meeting up with one called father.
They would alert him.
Aye.
So what do you suggest?
I think an early strike as they arrive in Nobu Village should do it.
I would need two of those like myself, day walkers.
And the father should be found.
See who wants their blood.
After I manage this task. what do you wish, to be made queen?
No,
I want my soul back.
After all the power you have felt in your veins?
I want to be who I am, what I am, not one of you.
Should I fear you, Kara?
You know what lies within me and I am what you need me to be.
Should I fear you?
You already do. we will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.
I don't expect much resistance except by the princess.
All in all, they are a pathetic group.
He comes here every evening to sell his catch.
Catch?
He's a fisherman now.
Now, now, ladies, you'll have to accept my apology.
I must leave.
There's an adventure in the offing.
Now, mark my words, if I didn't have to go off and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,
I would surely have you all to bed... again.
Can I see that spear right there, please?
Never mind.
There, why the long face, huh?
It is for the grand adventure that we live.
And it's not just the adventure itself.
It's the willingness to risk everything for it.
Something chased you off the street. what is your trouble, girl?
Something very terrible.
And what was that?
A vampire.
I know it's dead, but still I saw the things.
You see, I beleve you, girl.
This day there are vampires in Nobu.
So, I'm off. my, could you send an old rogue off with a proper farew
I believe we have an adventurer here.
I can taste it.
May the gods smile on your adventure, child.
The next time a warning would be nice. where can I find her?
Come now.
Levana,
- Kara?
- Your Highness.
You know what do with them.
This is your life now?
I have no life just the sins.
Bleak and bleaker.
That princess and they that hold it are under the sword.
Mind your own business, sir.
Nobu has always been a refuge where marriages are by and large human.
Now changes come to Nobu.
The world evolves.
Aye, mostly for the bad.
Do we have a quarrel, sir?
Have we met?
In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,
I knew your kind. well, maybe I am sick but I was pleasured by the killing.
They deserved to die.
I loved hearing their suffering, seeing their terror, and the begging and screaming.
There was real pleasure in that.
Sometimes life does not unfold as it should, and I do not have to explain myself to you.
I ask again, do we have a quarrel, sir?
I am presently engaged.
Did I do your mother, huh?
So, where is this renowned father? will our father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer who fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps we cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
I know you'll have my head for that, but not if I have yours first. what is this?
I would appreciate that back.
Come and take it.
I ask you once if we had a quarrel.
I knew the princess.
Now we have a quarrel.
Joy that's not marred by love. we have much to celebrate now that the full moon is seen.
You, me, the great love affair we shared.
The love by which you destroyed my father, and had me with your stick to dust.
But I harbor no grudge. well, perhaps just a bit of heartbreak and spite.
And bring that ridiculous rebate of a weapon of yours. what does that make him?
Is he an active vampire or is he a quarter vampire? I mean, what... what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?
You know, next time a warning would be nice.
Eva.
What are you doing here?
Where's your mother?
Alex.
- Long time no see.
- Been waiting long?
No. Only ten years.
Let's go, I'm freezing.
You've done well for yourself.
You've made some amazing robots.
I got bored of all that years ago.
Bored of designing boring robots?
No. Bored of designing fun robots for boring people.
I prefer lecturing.
Students make me laugh more.
Are you going to Dad's house?
It will be a mess.
- You could stay with us.
- No, no. Thanks.
- Do you know why they called you?
- Yes.
It must be important to bring you all this way.
Very important.
Damn it, Alex, always so mysterious.
Come over for dinner tomorrow, okay?
And welcome home.
Check out that cat.
Check out that guy!
Good morning, Alex Garel.
Hello, Dorotea.
I'm here to see Julia.
Julia is busy right now.
You don't look a day older.
You're beautiful.
You can't go in, she's giving a class.
Alex Garel!
You must never manipulate your robot's character.
You have 30 minutes to do the test.
And remember, try not to alter their profiles.
Good morning, Julia.
Some things never change.
Late as always.
Raise the frequency.
As you can see...
...although the software is much more advanced.
- What?
- The nob on the right!
- What now?
- Turn it down.
He's coming.
- I know!
- He's coming over!
Stupid robot, stop making noise.
"Stupid student, stop hurting me."
I'm sorry.
What do we do now?
What do you see when you close your eyes?
Now you've broken it.
We could restart it and reinsert its bases.
You can restart it, yes, but you have destroyed its emotional memory.
Its soul.
See? It's dead.
If you restart it, it'll look like the same horse, but it'll never be the same again.
"What do you see when you close your eyes?"
That command is sacred.
It must only be used in extreme cases when there is no other option.
Understood?
So, do you want to see it?
Draw me a tree.
Come on, focus.
I'm bored,
I don't want to draw any more.
The S.I.-9, just as you designed it ten years ago.
All finished and assembled: endoskeletal structure, muscle mechanisms, even the outer shell.
But it's missing the most important part of all.
The emotional intelligence software.
Reproducing the emotions of a child is foolish.
That's what you said.
It's only human to make mistakes.
The first free robot.
Incredible, isn't it?
Is this how you imagined it?
Why me?
To be honest, you aren't the first to try.
But you're the only one capable of designing a robot which is fun but safe.
Alex, this is your chance to finish what you started.
Yeah. But I'm not working here.
Where will you go?
My parents' house.
All right.
That's how emotional intelligence affects robot behaviour.
A certain event will affect us differently, depending on our mood and the circumstances in which we find ourselves.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Nobody has been in here since your father died.
Are you sure you want to stay here?
It's only a bit of dust.
You're crazy.
We'll install all the equipment tomorrow, but you must also come and see the models.
We need to choose a child to base the android on.
Alex Garel?
S.I.-7.
Good morning, sir.
I'm Max, no surname.
The university sent me to do housework and anything else you need.
- I don't understand.
- Company policy.
To avoid all that:
"There's no need, honestly.
I don't want to trouble you".
They just send me.
Call them, if you don't believe me.
No, thanks.
You can go now.
Level 5: food... plus clothes...
Plus...
Cat!
Luckily, it doesn't have fur.
Plus general tidy up of random objects.
- They're the worst, random objects.
- But...
It's okay, I'm a machine,
I'm used to it.
If you don't mind,
I'll start now.
I'm a "business before pleasure" kind of guy.
Come along, sir. Here.
This is your leisure time.
What do you do in your free time?
I work.
In my dictionary, "work" and "leisure" are antonyms.
We'll have to solve that, sir.
Coffee?
A coffee and a walk will do you good.
It's a beautiful day for it, sir.
You have many skills.
More than you think, sir.
I was created by David Garel's team.
My brother?
I'm designed for a multitude of tasks.
I'm a gourmet chef, a butler, a carer for the elderly, a monitor for children...
I speak 29 languages.
I even have advanced knowledge of DIY, plumbing, electrics...
I saw some roof tiles outside, sir, which need replacing.
And don't call me "sir", Max.
Thank you, Alex.
- What about that walk?
- Not sure I fancy it.
Please.
It will do you good.
Besides, I need space to work.
Come on, Gris, let's go.
We're in the way here.
I'll be outside.
If you don't eat that sweet,
I'll give you 5 more when I'm back.
If you don't eat that sweet,
I'll give you 5 sweets later.
But don't eat it, okay?
As you can see, we did several tests.
Including the incitement test.
- The good old sweet test.
- That's right.
- What do you think?
- Of what?
Of the kids.
You have to choose one.
We need a model for the robot.
These kids aren't right.
None of them.
They're all... boring.
- Boring?
Yes, boring.
Who'd want to live with them?
Their parents perhaps?
They don't count.
With an ordinary child you'll get an ordinary robot.
Alex!
That is how emotional intelligence works when applied to robotics.
The fluid logic and genetic algorithms allow us to design a variable artificial brain.
What does that mean?
That of all the options available, it always chooses the one best-suited to the individual in front of it.
Okay, guys, we'll pick it up here tomorrow.
How strange!
Alex Garel in a classroom.
It's only the second time
I've seen it.
You see that?
Now they study your absurd theories.
I don't know why, they're no use to anyone.
But they don't come here to hear my stupid theories.
No? Then why do they come?
They come to see you.
Right.
I have a meeting.
Turn the light off on your way out.
What are you looking at?
I wasn't looking.
Oh, really?
What do you call fixing your gaze on something?
Watching.
Then you were watching me.
- Do you do this often?
- What?
Watching kids.
Yes, I do.
Cool. A pervert who can admit what he is.
- At least you're original.
- It not what you think.
I do it for... work.
If you make excuses it's less original.
So it's part of your work?
Really?
You don't interest me any more.
Bye!
Wait!
Like in the movies.
What?
In the movies, when she walks away, he shouts "Wait!".
She turns around, and then he kisses her.
What's your name?
Eva.
Would you like a sweet?
Just one.
Just one?
You're a professional pervert.
- What flavour are they?
- I don't know.
I don't like those.
But I'll take both!
You want a sweet?
It's "I don't know" flavour.
"I don't know" which tastes of strawberry.
I work at the university and I'm making a robot.
If you want, and if your parents let you, I'd love to work with you.
You really are a very unusual pervert.
But I have to go home.
See you around!
Just in time.
Lunch is ready, despite all this mess.
- How was your walk?
- Fine.
The technicians from the university came.
They brought a complete prototype and various motor areas.
The hand-up is already installed.
This is delicious, Max.
I also made a basket for the cat.
Oh, no.
No you don't.
You can walk all around here, but don't you dare make a mess.
Alex, it doesn't micturate, does it?
Alex, this cat must be faulty, maybe you should repair it.
Gris is a free robot, he does what he wants.
He doesn't meet some of the safety requirements, but he's good company.
A free robot?
I've never heard of that.
It's an illegal application.
Just take care of him, and try to get along.
Hear that, my feline companion?
Alex is going to eat now and then we'll let him work.
Don't be a naughty kitty.
Max, what emo level are you on?
Standard level eight.
We're not used to such emotional robots.
Take it down to six.
Done, Mr Garel.
Level six.
You can still call me Alex.
Thank you.
CURIOUS
CHEERFUL
Smoke.
Smoke.
RECEPTIVE
Smoke.
Hello?
Hello, calamity.
Hello.
Can you come for dinner tomorrow?
- I've got a lot of work.
- Right...
Nine o'clock.
Don't be late.
David...
FEARFUL
Alex, come up.
Good evening.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Nice flowers.
Wine?
Of course.
How was Dad's house looking?
In a real mess.
I've met Max.
Congratulations.
Hi.
Thanks.
How was Australia?
Any Australian girlfriends?
Nothing serious.
Alex has always preferred robots to women.
- Women talk too much.
- That's true.
Hi.
What's with all the smoke?
- What's for dinner?
- Soup.
Eva, this is your Uncle Alex.
Nice to meet you.
Let's get the soup.
I'm very happy for you.
We ended up designing robotic cells to implant into patients.
- Does it work?
- It's viable.
That's wonderful.
And why did you leave?
- To work at a better place.
- Better than Santa Irene?
- I don't believe that.
- Neither do I.
How did it go with Julia?
What did she give you?
- And don't tell me it's secret.
- You know I can't speak about it.
Who's Julia?
Julia is a very grumpy, very clever woman.
How about a toast?
- To old times.
- And to secrets.
Hey, do you remember Eric's robot?
Who's Eric?
Eric was a friend who made a robot to do everything for him because he was lazy.
No, not peas!
Peas! Peas!
No! Not peas!
No! Not peas!
Is that for the S.I.-9?
Isn't that girl a bit wacky to be the model for a robot?
Yes, I'm looking for a fun model.
Don't move!
It's only anti rust spray.
Pervert!
Man, you can sleep!
I've been waiting half an hour.
You'll break your neck one day.
My mum says that to learn something, you have to fall many times.
So, are you coming inside?
Or are you afraid?
You weren't listening.
What my mum means is that
I shouldn't be afraid of anything.
What are you laughing at?
Welcome.
Please, take a seat.
You'll be more comfortable.
Something to read?
That's better, isn't it?
Much better.
Get down!
I don't mind.
What's your name?
He's called Gris. He's a prototype, and he doesn't talk, he just meows.
He's the only robot with free function.
Isn't that right, Gris?
All right,
I'm S.I.-7, Max, no surname to my friends.
A pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm Eva, no surname to my friends.
- You want to play a game, Eva?
- Okay.
Surprised.
Tired.
Happy. God knows why.
One word only.
Define it in just one word.
Happy.
Furious.
Angry.
Very good.
Perceptive.
I'm just making it more fun.
Are you bored?
I don't know what this is for, but it seems a waste of time.
Your reactions help me to configure the robot's emotional memory.
It's going to be one boring robot.
I thought you wanted to make something different.
That's what I'm trying to do.
If you help me, it will be like you.
It will laugh and get cross just like you.
One more and we're done, okay?
Sad.
Are you sure?
Look carefully.
He's crying.
People don't always cry because they're sad.
- What would you say?
- Happy.
- What?
- This man just won a race.
So what?
He's sad because he won.
Why would winning make him sad?
Because he knows he can't always win.
In that case, when someone loses, they should laugh, because they know they won't lose all their life.
Wow. The girl with all the answers has no answer.
Yes, I do.
You're funny when you're angry.
Don't laugh at me!
- Open the door.
- Where are you going?
Open the door!
Doon.
If you think I'm going to follow you, you're wrong.
Doon.
Well, well. You're back.
If you won't come and look for me,
I'll have to come back on my own.
But on one condition.
If you want my help, you have to show it to me.
This is the processor.
It's the robot's brain.
A brain? It's huge.
Actually, it's not that big.
It's as small... as a bee.
- What are these pieces?
- They're character components.
This piece, for example, is aggression.
And that one?
This one?
This one... is pride.
It's very small to be pride.
And now we switch it on.
It's pretty.
What's happening to him?
He's reacting to what he sees.
Forming a memory based on his experiences, just like a human.
And this, Eva, is how the S.I.-9 sees you.
Now your head.
- It's scalding me.
- No it isn't. Stop whining.
I went to Alex's house today.
When?
After school.
You said you were going to Maria's house.
I don't see Maria any more.
I've told you not to ride your bike out of town.
But I was careful.
I don't care if you're careful,
I don't want you to do it.
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't do it again.
You'll get no bedtime story.
I promise.
Why don't you ever talk about Alex?
Because Daddy was angry when he left.
Very angry?
Yes.
And you?
Me too.
Why?
Because we were studying together, we were working on a shared project, we were fond of each other, and then he just left.
And that made us sad and angry.
Did you love him like you love Daddy?
Yes, more or less.
More? Or less?
Why are you such a little gossip?
You look happy.
I am.
Have you come to tell me something?
What would happen if we made a girl instead of a boy?
Alex,
I've told you,
S.I.-9 is a boy.
We just need your emotional reaction program.
Emotional reaction?
Look, boys are clumsy and boring.
Girls are sweeter, more mature, more sensitive... and much prettier.
But they are also more perverse, more jealous and twisted.
And I know all this because, many, many years ago,
I was one.
Now get your arse back to work,
I don't pay you to sit here eating my biscuits.
Not that many years ago.
So you don't do research now?
You prefer lecturing?
I love lecturing.
It's very different, but I have a quieter life.
You seem happy.
Yes, we are.
And you?
Have you found someone to break your heart?
Alex,
Eva told me about the tests, and...
I'd rather you didn't do them with her.
I just want her to do what little girls do, so if you don't mind...
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
No...
- She's just so special.
- Yes.
She is.
But what did you expect?
She's my daughter.
Well...
I'll see you around.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You must be happy.
You had them begging you to come back.
You know I was never the boastful one.
Or the nice one.
But you were the clever one.
We're both very clever.
I disagree.
I am extremely talented.
- And modest.
- But you... are one in a million.
I suppose that's why
I'm the handsome one.
You were very handsome, yes.
Guess who I saw the other day.
Gloria.
Why didn't you ask her out?
There's a party next week.
- I think she never got over you.
- We were twelve.
You know what they say about your first love.
You never forget it.
Yeah.
Morning!
I thought you would dodge it.
Eva, we can't do this.
Your parents don't want you to come here.
So what?
I want to, and you need me.
There are other kids.
But not like me.
With an ordinary kid, you'll get an ordinary robot.
Come on, open the door.
Eva, come down.
Okay, fine. Just forget it.
What a shame.
I wanted to tell you the story of David and Mum.
What story?
Open the door first.
All right.
We'll do unofficial tests.
You just have fun and I'll observe you. Okay?
Okay, pervert.
Eva, Eva, slow down.
Come on, slowcoach.
Go on, try it.
- What?
- This.
Turn around.
I'll get stuck.
No, no, no.
Okay.
- Like this.
- What?
Do this.
No, don't move your bum.
Like this, like this.
Don't fall.
Pen.
Writing.
Story.
Mum.
Woman.
Pretty.
Garden.
Ground!
Ground.
Strong.
Stone.
Grey.
Cat.
Robot.
Free.
Happy.
You haven't fallen enough.
What?
When Mum sees someone who can't climb, she says:
"They haven't fallen enough."
She says that?
You wouldn't like her to say it about you.
Listen.
Between your mother and I...
There's nothing.
She's a wonderful person, and very pretty, but we split up years ago.
And although my expression changes whenever I hear her name, it's only the memory of good times we spent together.
What are you saying?
Nothing.
It's what you'd say if we were in a movie.
Clumsy idiot!
It's the town. Now what?
See that house there?
Which one?
- There are lots.
- It doesn't matter.
That's my house.
You brought me up here to tell me that?
And also to tell you that that house over there, on the way to the university...
That's David's house.
You don't live together.
And?
Don't tell me you're not pleased to hear it.
Come on, we have more tests to do.
- A deal is a deal.
- You're going to kill me.
Who's that?
It's Eva.
How old is she?
Ten.
She seems nice.
Is she your daughter?
No.
She looks a lot like you.
You won't beat me!
That's what you think.
My turn.
Hello.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Did you come to see us?
Yes, I came to see if you were home, but it's late now.
Come inside for a drink.
No, no, thanks.
I have to go.
Right. Your secret projects.
Will you come to the graduation party?
- I don't know...
- Yes, come.
Everyone wants to see you.
Okay, we'll see.
Hello!
How's my little girl?
Hello, David.
Hello, love.
- How are you?
- What's going on?
We're playing sleds.
- Let's push Daddy off.
- You want to push Daddy?
Worried.
Funny.
QUICK
Hungry.
No.
Sweet-toothed.
Perfect.
PERFECTIONIST
Bored.
Are you sure?
Yes.
This woman is tired.
We also yawn when we're tired.
She's bored and that's making her tired.
Sure, just like tiredness makes you bored.
That works for everything.
CREATIVE
Don't laugh.
Why not?
Because.
Don't laugh.
I'm laughing because you're funny.
I'm not funny!
Sit down.
No.
Sit down!
- Sit down!
- I don't want to!
What are you doing?
- I told you to sit down.
- No!
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
- Where?
- I'm leaving!
You can't leave.
- Why not?
- The door is locked.
- Open it!
- No.
I said open it!
I'm ordering you to sit down.
- I told you to open the door!
- No.
- Open it now!
- No!
Yes!
What do you see when you close your eyes?
What happened?
Not now, Max.
- Mr Garel.
- Hello.
Hello, Mr Garel.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- You remember Manuel?
- Yes.
Hello, Alex.
Julia tells me you're working at home.
You should work here, at the university.
- Leave it.
- Really.
Who are you hiding from?
Nobody.
Here's to your bright future.
Look at this. Drinking already.
Hello, Alex.
Are you boring my wife?
I'm working on it.
How's the prototype going?
Who wants to dance?
Alex doesn't dance. Right?
Thanks.
May I?
Of course.
Have you been practising?
No.
You dance much better.
Where did David go?
Will you help me find him?
It's so cold.
And to think I missed this place.
But you also hated it here.
Are you going to stay?
When you finish the project.
Will you stay?
I might not finish it.
Well, you should.
For once.
Or haven't you changed?
I think I've changed.
Right.
You haven't forgiven me?
No.
It was ten years ago.
Ten years is nothing.
I'd need another ten.
I can't. Alex, no.
I can't.
Lana!
What do you want?
What else do you want?
You left her once already.
Go away.
Do you need something?
Yes.
Turn your emo level back up to 8.
Alex, what's the matter?
It's nothing, Max.
But thanks.
Well, well...
Who hit you? The S.I.-9?
No.
I'm not going to finish the S.I.-9.
Leaving the job half done again?
Alex, you're a great creator, maybe the best.
But if you don't finish your projects, it doesn't matter how good you are...
Take a break for a few days and then we'll talk.
It's because of her, right?
What are you looking at?
Are your parents home?
Sad.
What?
You have a sad face.
Why did you lie to me, Eva?
Why did you say that David didn't live with you?
That was what you wanted to hear.
Eva, I'm leaving.
You can't.
You can't leave now, now that I've finally found you.
It's not fair.
Alex...
I'm very sorry about what happened.
Eva tells me you're leaving.
Do you want me to go?
Alex, I need to tell you something.
"Eva is a very special little girl."
She is like us both because we made her.
Eva!
Eva!
Eva!
Wait, I'll go with you.
No. I have to tell her myself.
Will you come back?
Of course.
Eva!
Eva!
My God.
No.
Eva.
Mummy, what happened to me?
Nothing, sweetie.
Everything is okay.
Mummy, it's not okay.
What's this?
Take it easy, or you'll faint again.
Please.
- Everything's fine now.
- Don't touch me.
I should have told you before.
- Let's go home.
- Don't touch me.
I don't want to.
- What am I?
- You're my little girl.
Eva.
What are you doing here?
Where's your mother?
Hello?
Yes, David.
Eva is here.
What?
Eva...
Did something bad happen?
Alex is very upset.
How can I help you?
I pushed her.
I pushed her.
It's all right.
I pushed her.
Everything will be okay.
I pushed her.
I pushed her.
I pushed her.
I pushed her.
You know that Lana was as good as you.
She finished the project after you left.
Lana was the first to design the S.I.-9.
Eva, as you know her.
When we tested her, she didn't pass the safety control.
But Lana wanted to keep her, she gave up everything for her.
And I let her.
That was a mistake.
Alex, we have to destroy her.
She's a little girl.
No, she's not.
I know what she is.
She killed Lana.
Julia, let me do it.
No. It's my responsibility.
Julia!
I'll do it.
Hello, princess.
It's very early.
Can we go skating?
I'm sure I won't fall today.
All right.
Try it!
Look, Eva!
No, not like that!
Like this!
Alex, come and join us!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mum brought me here first.
When the sun went down it got really cold, but I didn't want to leave until all the lights came on.
It's beautiful, Eva.
I'd never seen it like this.
Alex, you have to promise to help me.
I don't want to be bad again.
I want to be a good girl.
Dinner is ready.
Alex, after dinner,
I'd like you to read to me, a book which Mummy read to me every night.
It's called
"One Thousand and One Nights" and it's about a princess and a prince who must kill her before she falls asleep.
But every night, she tells him a beautiful story which never ends.
He can't kill her because he wants to hear more.
And so it goes on like that, night after night...
Until the prince decides to pardon the princess so she can continue telling him those stories forever.
Alex, you're not going to fix me, are you?
Eva...
What do you see when you close your eyes?
She is like us both because we made her.
Just one?
You're a professional pervert.
Do this.
No, don't move your bum.
Like this.
Why are you such a little gossip?
We were studying together, we were working on a shared project,
we were fond of each other, and then he just left.
What do you see when you close your eyes?
I see light.
Lots of light.
I see you, Daddy
and I see Mummy,
and me, all of us together,
playing forever.

The Tesseract has awakened.
The Tesseract has awakened.
It is on a little world, a human world.
They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will.
He is ready to lead
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.
A world will be his.
The universe, yours.
And the humans,
what can they do but burn?
All personnel,
the evacuation order
has been confirmed.
How bad is it?
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.
Spontaneous event.
It just turned itself on?
Where are the energy levels now?
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.
How long to get everyone out?
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.
Do better.
Sir, evacuation may be futile.
We should tell them to go back to sleep?
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.
I need you to make sure the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on.
Clear out the tech below.
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Yes, sir.
With me.
Talk to me, Doctor.
Director.
Is there anything we know for certain?
The Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.
I assume you pulled the plug.
She's an energy source.
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.
If she reaches peak level...
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.
But we don't have the harness.
My calculations are far from complete.
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?
The Hawk?
Up in his nest, as usual.
Agent Barton, report.
I gave you this detail
so you could keep
a close eye on things.
Well, I see better from a distance.
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?
Doctor, it's spiking again.
No one's come or gone.
And Selvig's clean.
No contacts, no IMs.
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
"At this end"?
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?
Doors open from both sides.
Not yet.
Sir, please put down the spear.
You have heart.
Please don't.
I still need that.
This doesn't have to get any messier.
Of course it does.
I've come too far for anything else.
I am Loki, of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
Loki, brother of Thor.
We have no quarrel with your people.
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
Are you planning to step on us?
I come with glad tidings of a world made free.
Free from what?
Freedom.
Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart, you will know peace.
Yeah, you say "peace,"
I kind of think you mean the other thing.
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.
He means to bury us.
Like the pharaohs of old.
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Well, then.
I need these vehicles.
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.
Hill!
Do you copy?
Barton has turned.
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.
Director?
Director Fury, do you copy?
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?
A lot of men still under.
I don't know how many survivors.
Sound a general call.
I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
Roger that.
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.
As of right now, we are at war.
What do we do?
This is not how I wanted this evening to go.
I know how you wanted this evening to go.
Believe me this is better.
Who are you working for?
Lermentov, yes?
Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo?
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.
Solohob a bagman, a front.
Your outdated information betrays you.
The famous Black Widow and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.
You really think I'm pretty?
Tell Lermentov we don't need him to move the tanks.
Tell him he is out.
Well...
...you may have to write it down.
It's for her.
You listen carefully
You're at 1- 14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.
We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block
before you can make the lobby.
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.
This takes precedence.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
This moron is giving me everything.
I don't give everything.
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
Natasha...
Barton's been compromised.
Let me put you on hold.
Where is Barton now?
- We don't know.
- But he's alive?
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Who are you?
Get out!
There is sickness here!
You're a doctor.
My father's not waking up!
He has a fever and he's moaning but his eyes won't open.
Slow down.
My father...
Like them?
Please.
You should've got paid up front, Banner.
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress you picked a hell of a place to settle.
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
Then what is it? Yoga?
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.
I assume the whole place is surrounded.
Just you and me.
And your actress buddy?
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?
I did.
Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff.
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.
S.H.I.E.L.D.
How did they find me?
We never lost you, Doctor.
We've kept our distance.
Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
Why?
Nick Fury seems to trust you.
But now we need you to come in.
What if I say no?
I'll persuade you.
And what if the other guy says no?
You've been more than a year without an incident.
I don't think you want to break that streak.
Well, I don't every time get what I want.
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
Well, those I actively try to avoid.
This is the Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
If there was, that's where I'd be.
So, Fury isn't after the monster?
Not that he's told me.
And he tells you everything?
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.
He needs me in a cage?
No one's going to put you in a...
Stop lying to me!
I'm sorry. That was mean.
I just wanted to see what you'd do.
Why don't we do this the easy way where you don't use that and the other guy doesn't make a mess.
Okay?
Natasha?
Stand down.
We're good here.
"Just you and me."
This is out of line, Director.
You're dealing
with forces you can't control.
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?
Did you feel an overabundance of control?
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?
Not Asgard. Loki.
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?
His brother.
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile but he's worlds away.
We can't depend on him to help, either.
It's up to us.
Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.
It was designed for exactly this...
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.
We need a response team.
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
This isn't about the Avengers.
We've seen the list.
You're running the world's greatest
covert security network
and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race
to a handful of freaks.
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
You believe?
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
No, it's won by soldiers.
There's not enough time.
I got to put her in the water!
You won't be alone.
Oh, my God.
This guy is still alive!
Trouble sleeping?
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
When I went under, the world was at war.
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some, very recently.
Are you here with a mission, sir?
I am.
Trying to get me back in the world?
Trying to save it.
HYDRA's secret weapon.
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think.
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.
That's something the world sorely needs.
Who took it from you?
He's called Loki.
He's not from around here.
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Ten bucks says you're wrong.
There's a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment.
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
You should have left it in the ocean.
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.
You disconnected
the transmission lines?
Are we off the grid?
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over
and it actually works.
I assume.
Light her up.
How does it look?
Like Christmas, but with more me.
We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.
I'm in DC tomorrow,
I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?
Enjoy the moment.
Get in here and I will.
Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.
I'm not in.
I'm actually out.
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.
Levels are holding steady, I think.
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.
How does it feel to be a genius?
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?
What do you mean?
All this came from you.
No, all this came from that.
Give yourself some credit. Please.
Stark Tower is your baby.
Give yourself 12% of the credit.
An argument can be made for 15.
12%? My baby?
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And, sorry, but the security snafu?
That was on you.
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
It's not going to be that subtle.
I'll tell you what.
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.
On the lease.
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?
Sir, the telephone.
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.
Mr Stark, we need to talk.
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.
- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.
Then leave it urgently.
Security breach. It's on you.
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.
"Phil"?
I can't stay.
His first name is "Agent."
Come on in. We're celebrating.
Which is why he can't stay.
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.
I don't like being handed things.
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.
Thank you.
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.
This isn't a consultation.
Is this about the Avengers?
Which I know nothing about.
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.
And I didn't even qualify.
I didn't know that either.
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
That I did know.
This isn't about personality profiles any more.
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?
Half a mo.
You know, I thought we were having a moment.
I was having 12% of a moment.
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?
What is all this?
This is this.
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
Tomorrow.
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.
Well, what if I didn't?
- Lf you didn't?
- Yeah.
You mean when you've finished?
Well, then...
Square deal. Fly safe.
Work hard.
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.
I want to hear about the cellist. Is that still a thing?
She moved back to Portland.
What? Boo!
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?
A lot of people were.
You were the world's first superhero.
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking
Erskine's original formula.
Didn't really go his way, did it?
Not so much.
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
He's like a smart person.
I gotta say, it's an honour to meet you officially.
I've sort of met you. I mean,
I watched you while you were sleeping.
I mean, I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.
You know, it's really just a huge honour to have you on board this...
I hope I'm the man for the job.
Oh, you are. Absolutely.
We made some modifications to the uniform.
I had a little design input.
The uniform?
Aren't the stars and stripes a little old-fashioned?
With everything that's happening and the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned.
The Chitauri grow restless.
Let them gird themselves.
I will lead them in the glorious battle.
Battle?
Against the meagre might of Earth?
Glorious, not lengthy.
If your force is as formidable as you claim.
You question us?
You question him, he who put the sceptre in your hand?
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?
I was a king!
The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed.
Your ambition is little and born of childish need.
We look beyond the Earth to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
I don't threaten.
But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.
You will have your war, Asgardian.
If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he cannot find you.
You think you know pain?
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.
Stow the captain's gear.
Yes, sir.
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.
- Ma'am.
- Hi.
They need you on the bridge.
They're starting the face-trace.
See you there.
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
Trading cards?
They're vintage. He's very proud.
Dr Banner.
Yeah, hi.
They told me you would be coming.
Word is, you can find the Cube.
Is that the only word on me?
Only word I care about.
It must be strange for you, all of this.
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.
Flight crew, secure the deck.
Is this a submarine?
Really?
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?
No, no, this is much worse.
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.
Increase collective to 8.0%.
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.
Increase output to capacity.
Power plant performing at capacity.
We are clear.
All engines operating.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.
Let's vanish.
Engage retro-reflection panels.
Reflection panels engaged.
Gentlemen.
Doctor, thank you for coming.
Thanks for asking nicely.
So, how long am I staying?
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the wind.
Where are you with that?
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones, laptops...
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.
That's still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow your field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays.
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.
At least we could rule out a few places.
Do you have somewhere for me to work?
Agent Romanoff, could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.
Put it over there.
Where did you find all these people?
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.
Is this the stuff you need?
Yeah, iridium.
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.
It's very hard to get hold of.
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.
Well, I didn't know.
Hey!
The Tesseract has shown me so much.
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.
I know.
What did it show you, Agent Barton?
My next target.
Tell me what you need.
I need a distraction.
And an eyeball.
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
No, no. It's fine.
It's a vintage set.
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
Near mint.
Slight foxing around the edges, but...
We got a hit. A 67% match.
Wait. Cross match, 79%.
Location?
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.
He's not exactly hiding.
Captain, you're up.
Kneel before me.
I said kneel!
Is not this simpler?
Is this not your natural state?
It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation.
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity.
You were made to be ruled.
In the end, you will always kneel.
Not to men like you.
There are no men like me.
There are always men like you.
Look to your elder, people.
Let him be an example.
You know, the last time
I was in Germany, and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.
The soldier.
The man out of time.
I'm not the one who's out of time.
Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.
Kneel.
Not today!
The guy's all over the place.
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?
Make your move, Reindeer Games.
Make your move, Reindeer Games.
Good move.
Mr Stark.
Captain.
Is he saying anything?
Not a word.
Just get him here. We're low on time.
I don't like it.
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.
What's your thing, Pilates?
What?
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple of things doing time as a Capsicle.
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.
Where's this coming from?
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
What are you doing?
And now there's that guy.
Another Asgardian?
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.
Stark, we need a plan of attack!
I have a plan. Attack.
I'd sit this one out, Cap.
I don't see how I can.
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.
There's only one God, ma'am.
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
Where is the Tesseract?
I missed you, too.
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
You should thank me.
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here to your precious Earth?
I thought you dead.
Did you mourn?
We all did. Our father...
Your father.
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
We were raised together.
We played together, we fought together.
Do you remember none of that?
I remember a shadow.
Living in the shade of your greatness.
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
I, who was, and should be, king!
So you take the world I love as a recompense for your imagined slights?
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.
The humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret.
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?
You think yourself above them?
Well, yes.
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
A throne would suit you ill.
I've seen worlds you've never known about!
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would-be king?
- I am a king!
- Not here!
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!
You come home.
I don't have it.
You need the Cube to bring me home.
But I've sent it off, I know not where.
You listen well, brother.
I'm listening.
Do not touch me again.
Then don't take my stuff.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Shakespeare in the Park?
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?
This is beyond you, metal man.
Loki will face Asgardian justice.
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,
stay out of the way.
Tourist.
Okay.
Power at 400% capacity.
How about that?
Hey!
That's enough.
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
Yeah... No.
Bad call. He loves his hammer.
You want me to put the hammer down?
Are we done, here?
In case it's unclear, if you try to escape, if you so much as scratch that glass, it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.
You get how that works?
Ant, boot.
It's an impressive cage.
Not built, I think, for me.
Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Oh, I've heard.
A mindless beast.
Makes play he's still a man.
How desperate are you,
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?
How desperate am I?
You threaten my world with war.
You steal a force you can't hope to control.
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.
It burns you to have come so close.
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.
And for what?
A warm light for all mankind to share.
A warm light for all mankind to share.
And then to be reminded what real power is.
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.
He really grows on you, doesn't he?
Loki's gonna drag this out.
So, Thor, what's his play?
He has an army called the Chitauri.
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.
He means to lead them against your people.
They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
An army from outer space.
So, he's building another portal.
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
Selvig?
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.
Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.
I want to know why Loki let us take him.
He's not leading an army from here.
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.
You could smell crazy on him.
Have care how you speak.
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.
And he is my brother.
He killed 80 people in two days.
He's adopted.
I think it's about the mechanics.
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?
It's a stabilising agent.
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.
I'll fly you to Portland.
Keep love alive.
It means the portal won't collapse on itself like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.
Also, it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long, as Loki wants.
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.
That man is playing Galaga.
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
How does Fury even see these?
He turns.
Sounds exhausting.
The rest of the raw materials,
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density.
Something to kick-start the Cube.
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect.
Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
Is that what just happened?
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.
Thanks.
Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.
I was hoping you might join him.
I would start with that stick of his.
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.
And I would like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
Monkeys? I do not understand.
I do.
I understood that reference.
Shall we play, Doctor?
This way, sir.
The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.
But it's going to take weeks to process.
If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster, we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.
All I packed was a toothbrush.
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.
Top ten floors, all R&D.
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,
I kind of broke Harlem.
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.
No tension, no surprises.
- Hey!
- Nothing?
Are you nuts?
Jury's out.
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?
What's your secret?
Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?
Is everything a joke to you?
Funny things are.
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.
No offence, Doc.
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.
Do you think I'm not?
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?
What isn't he telling us?
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.
You think Fury's hiding something?
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.
His secrets have secrets.
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?
I just want to finish my work here, and...
Doctor?
"A warm light for all mankind."
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.
I heard it.
I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news.
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly building in New York?
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.
That building will run itself for, what, a year?
It's just the prototype.
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
That's what he's getting at.
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in on the Tesseract project?
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.
I'm sorry. Did you say...
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.
Blueberry?
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?
Historically, not awesome.
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.
We have orders.
We should follow them.
Following's not really my style.
And you're all about style, aren't you?
Of the people in this room, which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit, and, B, not of use?
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.
Just find the Cube.
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The guy's not wrong about Loki.
He does have the jump on us.
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.
It's going to blow up in his face.
And I'm going to be there when it does.
Yeah. I'll read all about it.
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.
It's a nightmare.
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.
This stops it.
This little circle of light, it's part of me now, not just armour.
It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.
It's different.
Hey, I read all about your accident.
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
So you're saying that the Hulk...
The other guy saved my life?
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
I guess we'll find out.
You may not enjoy that.
And you just might.
As soon as Loki took the doctor, we moved Jane Foster.
They've got an excellent observatory in Tromsø.
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.
She'll be safe.
Thank you.
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
Erik is a good man.
He talks about you a lot.
You changed his life.
You changed everything around here.
They were better as they were.
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.
Well, they are repulsive.
And they trample everything in their path.
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here, and your people paid the price.
And now, again.
In my youth, I courted war.
War hasn't started yet.
You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.
There's no pain would prise his need from him.
A lot of guys think that until the pain starts.
What are you asking me to do?
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Loki is a prisoner.
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.
But you figured I'd come.
After.
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm.
And I would cooperate.
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.
I would say I've expanded his mind.
And once you've won, once you're king of the mountain, what happens to his mind?
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Tell me.
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...
Well, I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skill set.
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.
He made a different call.
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
Not let you out.
No, but I like this.
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.
Regimes fall every day.
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.
Or I was.
And what are you now?
It's really not that complicated.
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.
Can you?
Can you wipe out that much red?
Dreykov's daughter,
São Paulo, the hospital fire?
Barton told me everything.
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic!
You lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers.
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,
something that makes up
for the horrors.
But they are part of you.
And they will never go away.
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams, I'll split his skull.
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.
You're a monster.
Oh, no.
You brought the monster.
So, Banner.
That's your play.
What?
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.
Send Thor as well.
Thank you for your cooperation.
What are you doing, Mr Stark?
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.
What is "Phase 2"?
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses the Cube to make weapons.
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.
This does not mean that we're making...
I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
I was wrong, Director.
The world hasn't changed a bit.
Did you know about this?
You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.
Loki is manipulating you.
And you've been doing what, exactly?
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.
Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.
Is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Because of him.
Me?
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.
We learned that not only are we not alone but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And you're not the only threat.
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, that can't be controlled.
Like you controlled the Cube?
Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.
It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.
A higher form?
You forced our hand.
We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.
Because that always calms everything right down.
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...
Hold on. How is this now about me?
I'm sorry, isn't everything?
I thought humans were more evolved than this.
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
You treat your champions with such mistrust.
Are you boys really that naïve?
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.
Captain America's on threat watch?
We all are.
Wait, you're on that list?
Are you above or below angry bees?
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?
Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.
I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.
What is your haul? Over.
Arms and ammunition. Over.
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
That's his M.O., isn't it?
I mean, what are we, a team?
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're a time bomb.
You need to step away.
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
You know damn well why. Back off!
I'm starting to want you to make me.
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.
Take that off, what are you?
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
I think I would just cut the wire.
Always a way out.
You may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
A hero? Like you?
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.
You people are so petty and tiny.
Yeah, this is a team.
Agent Romanoff, would you escort
Dr Banner back to his...
Where? You rented my room.
The cell was just in case...
In case you needed to kill me.
But you can't. I know, I tried.
I got low. I didn't see an end.
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.
So I moved on.
I focused on helping other people. I was good.
Until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk.
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?
You want to know how I stay calm?
Dr Banner, put down the sceptre.
Got it.
Sorry, kids, you don't get to see my party trick after all.
You located the Tesseract?
I could get there fastest.
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
Put on the suit.
Oh, my God.
Put on the suit.
Yeah.
All hands to stations.
- Hill!
- External detonation.
Number three engine is down.
We've been hit.
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!
Talk to me.
Turbine looks mostly intact but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs while we're in the air.
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.
- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section
then get to the armoury.
Romanoff?
We're okay.
We're okay, right?
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.
- Got it.
- Stay close.
Let's go, Level 4.
Engine three. I'll meet you there.
Doctor?
Bruce?
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.
Are you hurt?
We're going to be okay. All right?
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.
You will walk away and never ever...
Your life?
Bruce.
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.
Is the sun coming up?
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.
Get us over water.
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.
Thanks.
Stark!
Stark, I'm here!
Good.
Let's see what we've got.
I got to get this superconducting coolant system back online before I can access the rotors, work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that
engine control panel
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.
What does it look like in there?
It seems to run on some form of electricity.
Well, you're not wrong.
We are not your enemies, Banner.
Try to think!
Okay, the relays are intact.
What's our next move?
Even if I clear the rotors,
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.
I'm going to have to get in there and push.
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that could...
Speak English!
You see that red lever?
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.
Stand by it. Wait for my word.
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.
Grenade!
We've got a perimeter breach!
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.
Call-outs at every junction.
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!
Get his attention.
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.
Don't get too close.
Copy.
Target acquired.
Target engaged.
Target angry, target angry!
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...
Engine one is now in shut-down.
We are in an uncontrolled descent.
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.
It's Barton. He took out our systems.
He's headed for the detention level.
Does anybody copy?
This is Agent Romanoff.
I copy.
Stark, we're losing altitude.
Yeah, I noticed.
No!
Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The humans think us immortal.
Should we test that?
Move away, please.
You like this?
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.
Even I don't know what it does.
Do you want to find out?
No!
Natasha?
You're going to lose.
Am I?
It's in your nature.
Your heroes are scattered.
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.
Where is my disadvantage?
You lack conviction.
I don't think I'm...
So, that's what it does.
All hands
to crash stations immediately.
Cap, hit the lever.
I need a minute here!
Lever now!
Help!
Sorry, boss.
The god rabbited.
Just stay awake.
Eyes on me.
No, I'm clocking out here.
Not an option.
It's okay, boss.
This was never gonna work if they didn't have something to...
Agent Coulson is down.
A medical team is on
its way to your location.
They're here.
They called it.
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
I guess he never did get you to sign them.
We're dead in the air up here.
Our communications, the location of the Cube,
Banner, Thor...
I got nothing for you.
I lost my one good eye.
Maybe I had that coming.
Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
I never put all my chips on that number, though because I was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative.
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more.
To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.
In heroes.
Well, it's an old-fashioned notion.
You fell out of the sky.
Did I hurt anybody?
There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.
Lucky.
Or just good aim.
You were awake when you fell.
- You saw?
- The whole thing.
Right through the ceiling.
Big and green and buck-ass nude.
Here.
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.
Thank you.
Are you an alien?
What?
From outer space, an alien.
No.
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.
Clint. You're going to be all right.
You know that?
Is that what you know?
I've got no window.
I have to flush him out.
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.
You don't understand.
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
Pull you out and stuff something else in?
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
You know that I do.
Why am I back?
How did you get him out?
Cognitive recalibration.
I hit you really hard on the head.
Thanks.
Natasha...
How many agents did I...
Don't.
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.
This is Loki.
This is monsters and magic, and nothing we were ever trained for.
Loki, did he get away?
Yeah.
I don't suppose you know where.
I didn't need to know.
I didn't ask.
He's going to make his play soon, though.
Today.
We got to stop him.
Yeah? Who's "we"?
I don't know. Whoever's left.
Well, if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,
I would sleep better, I suppose.
Now you sound like you.
But you don't.
You're a spy, not a soldier.
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
What did Loki do to you?
He didn't. I just...
Natasha.
I've been compromised.
I got red in my ledger.
I would like to wipe it out.
Was he married?
No.
There was a cellist, I think.
I'm sorry.
He seemed like a good man.
He was an idiot.
Why? For believing?
For taking on Loki alone.
He was doing his job.
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.
He should have...
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
Right, I've heard that before.
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?
We are not soldiers.
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
Neither am I.
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.
But right now, we got to put that behind us and get this done.
Loki needs a power source.
If we can put together a list...
He made it personal.
That's not the point.
That is the point. That's Loki's point.
He hit us all right where we live. Why?
To tear us apart.
Yeah, divide and conquer is great but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?
That's what he wants.
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.
He wants an audience.
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?
He wants flowers, he wants parades.
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...
Son of a bitch.
Time to go.
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.
Can you fly one of those jets?
I can.
You got a suit?
Yeah.
Then suit up.
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.
Son, just don't.
Sir.
Agent Hill.
Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.
They needed the push.
We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.
They found him.
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor
but the device
is already self-sustaining.
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.
It's too late!
She can't stop now.
She wants to show us something!
A new universe.
Okay.
The barrier is pure energy.
It's unbreachable.
Yeah, I got that.
Plan B.
Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
You should have left your armour on for that.
Yeah.
It's seen a bit of mileage, and you've got the glow stick of destiny.
Would you like a drink?
Stalling me won't change anything.
No, no. Threatening.
No drink? Are you sure?
I'm having one.
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.
What have I to fear?
The Avengers.
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.
Yes, I've met them.
Yeah.
It takes us a while to get any traction,
I'll give you that one.
But let's do a head count, here.
Your brother, the demigod, a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues, a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
That was the plan.
Not a great plan.
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
I have an army.
We have a Hulk.
I thought the beast had wandered off.
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.
There is no version of this where you come out on top.
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.
How will your friends have time for me when they are so busy fighting you?
This usually works.
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.
One out of five...
Jarvis, anytime now.
Jarvis, anytime now.
You will all fall before me.
Deploy!
Deploy!
And there's one other
person you pissed off.
His name was Phil.
Right.
Army.
Loki!
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.
You can't.
There is no stopping it.
There is only the war.
So be it.
Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.
What? Did you stop for drive-through?
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.
Sir, we have more incoming.
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
- Nat?
- I see him.
We got to get back up there.
Stark, are you seeing this?
Seeing. Still working on believing.
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?
Banner?
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
Look at this!
Look around you!
You think this madness will end with your rule?
It's too late.
It's too late to stop it.
No. We can, together.
Sentiment.
We've got civilians still trapped up here.
Loki.
They're fish in a barrel down there.
We got this. It's good. Go.
Do you think you can hold them off?
Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure.
Just like Budapest all over again.
You and I remember Budapest very differently.
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.
National Guard?
Does the army know what's happening here?
Do we?
You need men in these buildings.
There are people inside and they're going to be running right into the line of fire.
You take them to the basements or through the subway.
You keep them off the streets.
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
Why the hell should I take orders from you?
I need men in those buildings.
Lead the people down and away from the streets.
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.
Well, we got its attention.
What the hell was step two?
What's the story upstairs?
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.
Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.
- How do we do this?
- As a team.
I have unfinished business with Loki.
Yeah? Well, get in line.
Save it.
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us, and that's what we need.
Without him, these things could run wild.
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...
So, this all seems horrible.
I've seen worse.
Sorry.
No, we could use a little worse.
- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?
Just like you said.
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.
I don't see how that's a party.
Dr Banner.
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.
That's my secret, Captain.
I'm always angry.
Hold on!
Send the rest.
Guys.
Call it, Captain.
All right, listen up.
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.
Barton, I want you on that roof.
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.
Stark, you got the perimeter.
Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash.
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.
Better clench up, Legolas.
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.
Slow them down.
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.
You and me, we stay here on the ground.
We keep the fighting here.
And Hulk...
Smash.
Sir.
The Council is on.
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
So find a tight corner.
I will roger that.
Oh, boy.
Nice call.
What else you got?
Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.
And he didn't invite me.
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
Well, maybe it's not about guns.
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.
I got a ride.
I could use a boost, though.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.
Okay, turn, turn.
Less! Less!
Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.
They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.
I'm on it.
Everyone! Clear out!
Director Fury,
the Council has made a decision.
I recognise the Council has made a decision.
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,
I have elected to ignore it.
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.
You scramble that jet...
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.
If I send that bird out, we already have.
You.
Hawkeye!
Nat, what are you doing?
A little help?
I got him.
Enough!
You are, all of you, beneath me!
I am a god, you dull creature.
And I will not be bullied by...
Puny god.
The sceptre...
Doctor.
Loki's sceptre. The energy.
The Tesseract can't fight, but you can't protect against yourself.
It's not your fault.
You didn't know what you were doing.
Actually, I think I did.
I built in a safety to cut their power source.
Loki's sceptre.
It may be able to close the portal.
And I'm looking right at it.
Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?
I wouldn't consider him a role model.
Director Fury is no longer in command.
Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.
7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.
Sir, we have a bird in motion!
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.
We need to shut it down!
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.
Stark, do you hear me?
You have a missile headed straight for the city.
How long?
Three minutes, max.
The payload will wipe out Midtown.
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.
I just did.
Package is sent.
Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.
Are you ready for another bout?
What, are you getting sleepy?
Right at the crown!
I can close it.
Can anybody copy?
I can shut the portal down.
- Do it!
- No, wait.
Stark, these things are still coming.
I got a nuke coming in.
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.
Save the rest for the turn, J.
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?
Might as well.
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence
but clearly, it is outmatched.
And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,
I have never seen anything like this.
We have limited information
on the team
but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...
Come on, Stark.
Close it.
Son of a gun.
He's not slowing down.
Is he breathing?
What the hell?
What just happened?
Please tell me nobody kissed me.
We won.
All right, yay!
Hurray. Good job, guys.
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.
Have you ever tried shawarma?
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.
We're not finished yet.
And then shawarma after.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll have that drink now.
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed
as an extraterrestrial attack,
the extraordinary heroics
of the group known as the Avengers
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,
but for celebration.
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.
That someone is watching over us.
I love you, Thor!
And then these guys were like...
And then the air goes...
And this green guy walks up
and he goes...
I don't know.
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.
It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.
These so-called "heroes"
have to be held responsible
for the destruction done to this city.
This was their fight.
Where are they now?
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.
Their sudden appearance
and equally sudden disappearance...
What, this is all somehow their fault?
Captain America saved my life.
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,
I would just...
I would want to say thank you.
Where are the Avengers?
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
And the Tesseract?
The Tesseract is where it belongs.
Out of our reach.
That's not your call.
I didn't make it.
I just didn't argue with the god that did.
So, you let him take it
and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be
answering for his crime.
I think he will be.
I don't think you understand
what you've started,
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.
They're dangerous.
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.
Every world knows it.
Was that the point of all this?
A statement?
A promise.
Sir, how does it work now?
They've gone their separate ways.
Some, pretty extremely far.
If we get into a situation like this again, what happens then?
They'll come back.
Are you really sure about that?
I am.
Why?
Because we'll need them to.
Humans.
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.
They stand.
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.
To challenge them is to court death.
An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei...
...and Katou Masaru, who is working to support his younger brother.
The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again.
And then...
...they died.
The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment...
...in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed.
In that room which they can't get out of, they received a command from GANTZ.
"If you want to go back, go crush this guy."
That was... to battle with the aliens who would invade the Earth...
An inescapable command.
They were then sent to a parallel world...
...and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens.
They barely got their victory.
What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was...
...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens.
If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs.
It was a frightening reality.
They have their life all thrown out of order...
...while being able to return to normal life when day comes.
People who were supposed to die...
Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling...
...and Katou, who continued to deny this battle.
The tough and painful battle goes on anyway.
...and their friends died one by one.
And, in the end, while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy, even Katou's life was taken away.
When Kurono was about to give in to sadness,
Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings.
He swore in his heart that he would earn
100 points in order to revive Katou.
In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting.
Let's go!
"Thank you for the hard work.
I'm Yoshioka."
"Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later,"
"so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning."
"It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour."
"That's all for now.
Thank you very much."
"At 10:29 p.m."
The message is over.
[Thank you for your hard work last night.]
[You got the first key.]

Soon it will be five months since the day the National Museum was collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown.
According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism.
- Is the burger done?
- Yes, coming.
I'll take this.
Please.
- Please help me with the tomatoes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Oh, Kei-chan.
- How's your homework?
- I'm done.
You're not.
But it's so interesting, Tae-chan.
Hey, Koruhi is written based on Kei-chan, right?
I didn't mean that...
Are you embarrassed?
Yeah. This manga is interesting, right?
She can even get the Rookie of the Year award.
I'm nowhere near good yet.
I have to improve my skills.
You're good already.
I'm no good yet.
There are a lot of better people.
I said you're gonna be fine.
Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too.
He's not coming back yet?
Oh, maybe a little more.
It's really because of his job, right?
Of course.
Oi, don't take your time in there.
Where is he really?
Ayumu-kun's brother.
Sorry.
I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before.
That time, his brother was arrested by the police.
Katou's not that kind of person.
This.
The pay for this month.
I don't need it, really.
Well you see, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right?
However, I want you to come to this house for a while more.
Of course I will.
If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework.
Ayumu is good at cooking anyway.
Well, I can't deny that.
Also...
If I come here,
I can see Kurono-kun too.
Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet.
It was what I'm gonna draw just now.
I was thinking of how to put in this particular romantic scene.
Well, I have to get going.
Eh?
I thought you were gonna stay?
Ah, someone just called me suddenly.
Kojima-san, you can just stay over.
Hold on a second.
Huh?
"The train will be coming to the first line soon."
"Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line."
You were chosen too, weren't you?
You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do.
Kobayashi-san is the same as you.
[It's completely up to me how
I want to use you people's lives.]
I'm sorry for startling you.
There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time?
Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there?
Rumors have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas.
But I've dug up everything.
You're from the media?
The motive is unknown but there is an incredible sequence of events that've been happening.
People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene.
The day just goes on as if nothing happened.
And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be...
...some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo.
Don't you know about this?
No.
Well then, how about that rumor?
The rumor about the black sphere...
...and the room that contains it...
You know it, don't you?
Then, four.
You can ask me four questions.
Your aim.
Why are you all gathering at this place?
We're searching for the black ball.
Black ball?
If we have it, we can go where we want.
You mean the room that contains the black sphere?
You know it, huh.
Where did you hear about it?
I came here today to ask about that.
Where is that room?
It's not in this reality.
What do you mean?
You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary.
Who are you people?
That's the fifth question.
Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do?
Sixth one.
What do you want exactly?
If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here.
Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while?
You and Kei-chan.
Focus.
Why? You two are dating, right?
We are not.
How come? You confessed to him, right?
Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun...
Seems that he can't think of any other thing.
But I'm fine.
When things calm down,
I'll try asking him once.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Ok! Homework.
[Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over]
It's gonna be soon, huh?
Yes.
Let me go!
Where's the heck is this place?
- Where am I?
- Please calm down.
Speaking of which, who are you people?
Who cares about that.
I was an office worker.
For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day.
Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though.
I'm a nurse.
That's during the day.
At night, she's a hostess.
You lie about you age, right?
This auntie's still popular at this age.
Can you believe it?
He's women's enemy even during the day.
I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop.
It's a small shop, but the food is delicious.
I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient.
Please contact me if need be.
And, how about you?
I'm a hairdresser.
Kurono-san is really a normal university student?
Since... you're really strong and everything.
He is, indeed.
Why are you so strong?
Because there's someone I want to revive.
GANTZ.
He was one of us before.
He fought with us.
Kurono-kun wants to revive him.
But... not only him.
I want to revive everyone who's died here.
And then, let us all be released from here and become free together.

[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]
Did you come on time the other day?
Hmm? For what?
Your part-time job?
Part-time...? Oh, yeah I did.
Tough, isn't it?
It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up.
That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out.
What's wrong?
Kurono-kun, did something good happen?
There's something, right?
You can tell?
What? What?
Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu.
Katou is gonna come home soon.
Eh?
He's been contacting you?
Hm?
Katou asked me...
...to keep it from other people.
I see.
More importantly, there's some information
I want to give Kojima-san...
Well, "information" isn't exactly the word...
Wanna go to amusement park?
Let's go?
Just the two of us, once in a while.
You mean... that time I confessed to you?
That was...
I told you it was just at the surge of the moment.
Please forget about it.
How can I forget it?
Hey, let's go.
Impossible, impossible.
Absolutely impossible.
I have acrophobia.
I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all...
Look.
You even drew it in your sketchbook, right?
The scene at the amusement park?
Maybe if you go there, it can become your source to draw manga.
Then...
There's one condition.
What is it?
Please start calling me by my first name from now on.
Eh?
Call me now.
Please.
Well, that's a little...
Maybe now is not the right time.
The next time we meet,
I'll call you that, ok?
I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park.
Yes.
Definitely.
See you.
Welcome back, Kei-chan.
How are you alive?
GANTZ did something?
You don't remember?
How many people are there?
Eight people, including me.
Recently, we got three more people.
GANTZ...
I want to put an end to it.
How?
You don't know?
There's a ball this big.
No idea.
I'll come again.
If you know something, tell me.
GANTZ, show me people who've died.
What's the matter?
Katou was revived.
Eh? How come?
Well, I don't know about that.
But look, he's still in here.
What is going on?
[Katou]
Who...
Nii-chan?
What?
Um...
I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college.
Ayumu-kun, come see him.
Ayumu-kun?
What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother?
It's because you have work to do, right?
I'm asking you, Nii-chan.
Because I have work.
Really?
Really.
Oh, yeah?
Should I go back?
There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so...
I'm taking my leave.
I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun.
[Welcome back, Nii-chan]
I memorized how to make it when you weren't home.
Try it.
You're the first person I made it for.
This is Kojima.
Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier.
And also, there's something I want to ask...
About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too...
That's why, it won't be a date.
I want to see you.
Can I go to your workplace right now?
[Kojima Tae]
[Kojima Tae]
Ayukawa Eriko's started to make her move.
At Kita, Senzoku.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
This will repeat many times over.
I stopped this after my child was born.
I have to get released soon for the sake of my family.

[Please go.]
Where's this place?
A train?
Something is fishy.
Hey, you...
Have we ever met long before?
It moved.
It's the subway!
What?
The subway?
Everyone, don't space out.
"The train will be departing soon."
There are people here.
This has never happened before, right?
Take care of the front part of the train.
Ayukawa Eriko?
She's riding the train by herself?
Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people.
We are not doing anything to harm you either.
What? Is it like an event or something?
Kurono-san!
Don't shoot!
Don't drag others into this!
Can you hear people screaming?
It smells weird too.
What the? What's going on?
Isn't this dangerous?
Takahashi!
You guys are so amazing.
Damn it.
I remember...
I remember!
I remember.
I've done the same thing before.
What?
The two who were in the room before,
Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too.
Eh?
Stop! It's dangerous here!
Out of the way!
Come.
Kurono Kei.
Kurono-kun?
Run away from here.
Wait.
Sorry.
Stop it!
You're heavy. Move aside.
I'm covering for you.
She's tough.
Yeah.
This is revenge.
This is revenge.
You people were the ones who started this first.
You people have killed so many of my friends.
I'll never forgive you-
Everyone's safe, right?
Auntie isn't here.
[Well then, let's see the points]
Hold on a second.
Oi!
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Takahashi]
[0 point. Total 88 points]
What the heck is this?
Oi.
I told you Auntie isn't here.
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
[Good work. You got the first key.]
[Kobayashi]
[The second key]
[Yamamoto]
[You got the second key.]
"You know it, don't you?"
"The black sphere... and the room that contains it."
Black sphere?
Room?
GANTZ!
[It totally depends on me how to use your life]
[That's on theory.]
This is revenge.
You people killed my friends.
[Sakurai]
[0 point. Total 69 points]
Auntie's here, isn't she?
That's her, right?
Is this for real?
Isn't that Ayukawa?
Ayukawa... Eriko?
You finally came, huh?
Yes.
Seems so.
[Well then, let's continue with the points]
Everyone, please be careful.
This woman... was the one who killed me.
Long time no see, Kobayashi-san.
Huh?
Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room?
You don't remember me?
Huh? What?
[Kobayashi]
[0 point. Totally doesn't remember a thing]
Two years ago...
I fought while protecting you.
[Nakamura]
[0 point]
Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I...
We defeated these aliens dressed in black...
...two years ago in Shibuya.
[Yamamoto]
[11 points]
And then, everyone could stop doing this.
We had our memory erased... and were set free.
Ah...
Yes.
So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh?
[Suzuki]
[17 points. Total 101 points]
100 points.
"Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently."
"An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured."
"A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train."
"The cause is also unknown this time."
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
That means you'll be released.
Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man.
I'll choose the second option.
[2. Return the person you love to life]
I'm sorry.
First of all, let's revive Katou-kun.
No...
But, he...
I was... killed by him.
"This is revenge. You people killed my friends."
He said that and killed me.
That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier.
Then... this Katou is?
Let's confirm it.
GANTZ.
Please revive Katou Masaru-kun.
Eh? That's it?
Kei-chan.
Where's the alien?
Katou.
Katou.
Katou!
Oi GANTZ. Hurry up!
You mustn't die.
I'll wait for you.
I'll go first and wait for...
Kei-chan.
What about the alien?
What happened to it?
Was I... dead?
Was I alive?
I'm alive, and I can go back.
Suzuki-san used his points to revive you.
It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning...
...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Ah, it's nothing.
Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right?
Yes.
The other guy is an alien.
We will avenge you.
I have obtained the key to that room.
[Kurono]
[21 points. Total 115 points]
More than 100 points.
GANTZ, I choose number 2.
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
The person I want to revive is...
Huh?
I have you revived.
I was dead?
Yeah.
That's so uncool!
Right now, you're important to us.
Now, explain to us.
Something strange is happening to GANTZ.
You guys...
Long time no see.
You're still doing this, huh?
Why are you here?
We were summoned by GANTZ.
A black ball was sent to my place.
Ex-members like us were brought back here.
That's not the only thing.
There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed.
This has never happened before.
Say, what's going on now?
How long have I been dead?
Five months.
It's gathering people because of this?
What is it?
Oi, spill it.
GANTZ runs using battery.
Huh?
This thing runs using battery?
From what I observe, even though this is just a guess...
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.
That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ.
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?
That is...
Right?
Extermination... perhaps.
We, who were revived by GANTZ...
...will also disappear together with it.
What the heck is that?
Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.
Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens.
That's why it summoned us ex-members here.
I see what you mean.
So it's like homecoming, huh?
Perhaps...
...the archrival still remains.
The Last Boss, that is.
Don't tell me...
...that is...?
Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body.
Eh?
The one who killed me is also...
...that guy.
He's an alien.
There it goes again.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
"Open your heart with joy"
Today's mission just ended though.
"Look up to the blue sky"
"Listen to the radio"
"Take a deep breath"
"And take in the fragrance of the wind"
"And then - one, two, three"
[Emergency mission]
[Go crush this person]
[Kojima Tae]
[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]
What the heck?
An ordinary girl?
Wait, look...
Her favorite thing is...
What the heck is this?
Why is she the target?
Shouldn't it be that fake Katou?
[People who crushed her will get 100 points.]
[The others will have their points taken away.]
This girl is...
Kojima Tae is not an alien.
That's why...
...please don't kill her.
Please.
She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien.
That's not true!
The last person who appeared on the black ball...
...was this girl.
So that means... she's also an ex-member of the group?
No. I've never seen her.
Then... she's really an alien?
Hang on.
Where is that ball now?
The one who killed me...
So it's with that Katou alien, huh?
Isn't that bad?
Maybe he already killed
Kojima Tae before us.
The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around.
Seriously?
GANTZ wants to prevent that, right?
Anyway...
...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it.
If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl,
I'll kill Kojima Tae.
GANTZ.
Transmit me first.
Kei-chan.
I'll go to Kojima-san.
You go to Ayumu's place.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Be careful.
Wait.
You intend to protect her?
I want to revive Auntie.
That's why...
...I have to gain more points.
Stop it!
Transmit me quickly.
GANTZ!
My house?
I will explain everything to you later.
Right now, let's run away together.
Um, what happened in the subway earlier...
It didn't make any sense at all.
But I believe...
I believe you, Kurono-kun.
This way!
Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother?
It wasn't him!
Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters.
Found one suspect just now.
The suspect is heading towards the north direction.
The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else.
Quickly send more backups to the subway.
"Roger."
Found you.
Kurono-kun.
Let's stop this.
If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated.
Doing this to another human being is just strange.
Though you can kill so many aliens?
Suzuki-san.
Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end,
I will get 100 points one more time.
Nice.
Kurono-san.
Run away.
If you move, we'll shoot.
No, you won't.
Suzuki-san too!
Me too?
They're shooting!
Please go first.
I will block them.
Sakurai-kun!
They won't get any points killing me.
Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later.
Thanks.
I'll aim at him for real.
Let's go.
[Katou]
Ayumu.
Ayumu!
Ayumu.
Ayumu.
Ayumu...
Calling headquarters.
Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction.
I'm chasing after him.
It's me, Kei-chan.
By any chance...
...he is...?
Suzuki-san.
The two of you, please get as far away from Tokyo as you can.
Hurry up!
I don't want to go!
I want to be with you, Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
I will definitely come pick you up later.
Let's go.
Let's make sure...
...we go to the amusement park.
This way!
Don't... get in my way.
You came to take revenge?
Why did you... have to kill Ayumu?
You also killed your father.
Give Ayumu back!
Someone who killed his father like you...
...can get angry when your brother is killed?
Because of those emotions... you killed your father.
That was to save Ayumu.
It couldn't be helped!
It couldn't be helped?
That's forever your excuse.
You always make that excuse... and run away from everything.
Katou!
Kei-chan.
Please tell me.
What's happening to Kurono-kun?
It's hard to explain, but...
He's fighting...
...to protect you.
For... my sake?
He might... even die.
I'm sorry.
My wife passed away.
I want to get her back.
I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over.
Please run away.
If not, I will have to shoot you.
Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up.
It doesn't work on him at all.
This way!
You're in the way. Move aside!
I give up!
Let's stop.
Let's stop here.
Okay?
What are you shooting?
But...
But...
...he-
[Kojima Tae] someone saying something the same someone saying something again
Oi.
Oi!
Oi!!
You want to know why I killed your brother?
This is revenge.
You people did the same thing to me.
We tasted the same hatred...
...and sorrow.
Like me, you people are...
...not fighting for anyone's sake,
Nor are you protecting anyone.
You're just...
...being controlled by that black sphere.
Katou.
Kurono-kun!
No way...
Kurono-kun.
I got you.
Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
Let's go home.
You mustn't...
You mustn't die.
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
So you're saying that I should keep...
...fighting until forever?
That's why, you...
...made Tae-chan your target?
You can go to that room using it, right?
Hand the ball to me.
[Mission cleared.]
[Damn it Damn it Damn it]
[Someone, crush the alien in this room]
In here?
Not here.
The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are...
We finally found you.
It is you who wished to start this fight.
[Start]
I understand now, GANTZ.
[Choose]
Kei-chan.
How about the aliens?
I don't think all of them have died.
That's great.
That's great?
Because we have to get more points.
What do humans fight for?
What do you people fight for?
For the sake of my loved ones.
When are you gonna keep fighting until?
Until... I can revive my wife.
Stop it.
I have to live.
I...
People in this world are longing to see me.
You're kidding, right?
GANTZ.
Stop it.
Shoot.
I can't stop this fight with you people.
Shoot!
Stop...
...already
Let's... stop this.
Why?
There's no way but to kill him.
Kei-chan.
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Kurono]
[Full points]
[Please choose from the "full points" menu.]
[Full points menu~]
[Forever...]
Oi! What's next?
What is it?
GANTZ is...
...over?
With this...
...no one will be revived.
Neither will us.
No.
There's still... a way out.
Kei-chan.
GANTZ...
...has decided already.
[Kurono-kun]
[Thank you]
Kei-chan?
What did you do?
Everything will end.
No one will be summoned here anymore.
You've gotta be kidding me!
What did you do?
Katou.
Thank you so much...
...for remembering our childhood together.
I...
...was really happy.
But...
...from now on, forget about me.
How can I forget?
How can I forget??
Katou.
Take good care of Ayumu.
We're going back together!
Together!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Thank you very much.
Wanna buy something?
- Yeah, buy me a map.
- Okay.
- I'll take them.
- Oh, thanks.
Map, huh?
Welcome.
Welcome.
"Ayukawa Eriko-san returned to the entertainment industry"
It's confirmed that all of the members present in your list are existent.
Please take some time off for yourself.
We will handle the investigation.
I saw them.
I saw those guys with my own eyes.
That room too.
I was just so close.
I'm made breakfast, so you will do the cleaning.
Okay, hurry up.
Quickly put the mattress away.
Huh?
Well, just that... it feels as if
I haven't seen you for a long time.
You're so strange.
I have... always wanted to do this.
I...
...won't go anywhere anymore.
I know that already, so go to work.
Who... gave me this again?
"Draw the Ferris wheel here"
"To Tae-chan"
"I love you. Kurono Kei"
Kurono... Kei?
[Everyone, please be happy]
[#Alexi Murdoch: "All My Days"]
[crowd screaming]
[phone ringing]
[grunting]
[groans]
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- [ringing continues]
- Come on.
- Yeah?
- [man] Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- All right, all right.
Jack, Jack, Jack,
I'm going to pay you.
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.
You owe Jack money, too?
Charlie, you pay me first!
Bill, hey, no, we're good, buddy.
I got your money.
It's right here in my hand.
So why don't we meet up on the...
[stammering]
- Charlie, your phone's going screwy.
- Bill?
- Hello?
- I'm losing you, Bill.
Wait, Charlie,
I can't hear what you're saying.
[girl] Hey, mister.
Is that Ambush?
- Uh, yeah.
- Can we see him?
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.
All right, give me...
Give me a minute.
This...
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.
- [beeping]
- [whirrs]
[gasps]
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually, he's going to fight...
Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?
- Can we get a picture with him?
- Sure. For five dollars.
You want five dollars? Seriously?
No, I want five dollars immediately.
Come on, guys.
Hey, hey.
All right, all right, I'm kidding.
- Three bucks.
- Whatever.
- How about $2.50?
- [girl] You suck!
All right.
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?
[announcer] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
- Yah!
- Please take your seats.
We're almost ready to get this thing started.
[grunts]
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.
Hey, hey!
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.
[man] Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton.
Time has not been good to you, my friend.
Ricky, we got a problem here.
A big problem.
Whoa, hey, slow down there, hoss.
Come on, last time I saw you, you were staring up at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center with the taste of my right cross all over your face.
Pow!
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.
- That bull is, like, 2,000 pounds.
- Right, OK.
Well, Charlie, I'll tell you something.
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! Whoo!
- How about that?
- [man chuckles]
- Get the hell out of here.
- [bull groans]
All right, all right.
Why don't we make this more interesting?
My bot against your bull, straight up.
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.
- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.
All right, Charlie.
I'll tell you what, twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,
I'm gonna come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.
And you know that I can do that because I already done it!
What's the problem with you, man?
In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.
All right, Charlie.
Shake and pow!
Just like that once again.
You want to dance again?
You wanna dance?
Come on, cheer for this guy.
Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.
Yahoo! Let's get going!
- [bull groans]
- Don't touch that bull.
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask, do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?
- [cheering]
- [Ricky chuckles]
Now, listen, friends, I understand, we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas and pay $300 for one of those World
Robot Boxing League fights. I get it.
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.
How about that?
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,
- Ambush!
- Let's do it!
[metal music playing]
All right, big fella.
[Ricky] Whoo-hoo!
He's a big fella, ain't he?
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.
Yeah.
[chuckles] Show them some power.
[Ricky] Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.
- Yeah!
- [Ricky] Yeah, big fella.
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up in the baddest of the bulls competition, ladies and gentlemen, Black Thunder!
[crowd roars]
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.
- [grunts]
- [whirring]
Is that all you got?
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.
Take him, take him.
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.
Woo woo!
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.
OK. Jump, now!
Boo-yah!
- Dang it!
- [Ricky] Ambush, decks
Black Thunder but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.
You like that. I can tell.
- You like that.
- [bull grunting]
Jeez! Turn around!
[mechanical chirping]
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!
[crowd gasps]
[cheering]
Come on, come on.
We're still in this thing.
We're still in this. Just hop. Hop.
That's it. Come on.
Ricky, enough! Enough!
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.
[laughing]
[chanting] Kill! Kill! Kill!
All right, come on. Get up.
Get up. Come on!
[groans] No!
C'mon. No, no, no!
[Ricky] Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our warriors out here today at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
Now, thank you all for coming out, and we'll see you next time, because there will be one.
Hey, hey! Give me that leg.
Sure. For five dollars.
Boo-yah!
Whoo! All right!
That was ridonculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.
- Everybody say "hey!"
- [audience] Hey!
- Everybody say "ho!"
- [audience] Ho!
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?
[muttering] My keys, damn it.
One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.
Charlie, relax.
I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.
- It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
- She's my ex-girlfriend.
I haven't seen her in like ten years.
What does she want?
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.
[sighs] Is he dead, too?
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.
[soft music playing]
[man] This court is convened to address the custodial status of one Max Kenton, age 11.
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.
Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.
Yes. As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy, and we can more than provide for Max.
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will next of kin retains custody.
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing, and we are expecting him...
[Charlie] No, I need a new robot now.
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.
I got to show up with something.
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?
I can live with that.
Well, I don't have it have it.
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.
Whoa.
Please be Charles Kenton.
Uh... Charlie, yeah.
[stammers] I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights to the custody of my son.
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?
Charlie.
Do you even remember me?
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?
- Mr. Kenton.
- Yeah.
Please take a seat.
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?
Yes, you may.
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.
- With the kid?
- [Debra] Yeah, the kid.
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture, step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.
[judge] Please.
Come on. Come on.
There you are.
He'll be in a foster home.
No, they find good families.
Young, energetic. Yeah.
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.
- [phone beeps]
- Oh, hey.
Hey, um...
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.
And...
- I'm up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.
The thing is...
...we're supposed to go to Italy this summer with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.
In August. A hundred.
- You heard me.
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.
The way I see it, there's a real way everyone gets what they want here.
So here's what you're going to do.
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel for being such a terrible absentee dad how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero, and everybody wins.
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?
I understand.
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max and the other 50 when we get back in August and you deliver him to us in New York.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Your Honor, I'm really happy we all took the time to make the best decision for everyone.
- Happy?
- [Charlie] Yeah, it's me.
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.
Hello?
Bailey?
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying, and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.
A creepy dude with a robot in a box has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.
Now, putting aside the fact that you're doing what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep, how are you gonna pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.
- No, six.
- Whoa.
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.
Come on, like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass if you sold this place.
My father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass.
[sighs]
Bailey.
- Don't.
- Don't what?
Don't do that. Don't... that...
Hey.
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.
- No, you like that thing.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.
[clears throat]
Marvin.
Your money has arrived.
Marv.
Fifty grand, as promised.
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.
So that's everything there.
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.
Yeah.
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.
That's a deal.
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.
OK? Let's get Max.
It's OK. You want me to go on the other side here and I'll get Max?
Hey, Max.
See you, pal.
[Debra] Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.
I'm Charlie.
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.
Do you know where they're going?
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.
You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?
Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?
- OK?
- Hey.
Hey.
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.
Max Kenton.
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.
Don't worry about it, OK?
I'm standing here looking at you two...
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.
[sighs]
So listen, you're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.
How much did he give you, huh?
You're coming at this the wrong way, kid.
No, tell me. I want to know.
50,000. OK?
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.
Will you shut up now?
You sold me?
Sounds worse than it is.
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.
Give me half the money and you won't have to.
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.
It's gone! OK? Gone!
I'm through here.
All right, what do we got?
Noisy Boy has arrived.
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.
[Charlie] Decided to stay, huh?
This is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.
- What?
- By the way,
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks or, like, eight.
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?
Is there a real robot boxer in there?
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?
Of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.
- [chuckles]
- [beeps]
Holy crap, he looks amazing.
Well, his composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.
He should have had him in the third round but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.
[beeping]
[Charlie] Relax, kid. he's on our side.
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.
You know he has voice recognition, right?
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.
Right, left, uppercut!
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.
God, look how good he looks, too.
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!
Why didn't you ask the guy to have a look at it?
Relax!
[speaks Japanese]
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?
[speaks Japanese]
Let me see if I can reset him to English. Hang on.
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.
[Charlie] You play video games in Japanese?
Japanese bootlegs are always better.
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.
They have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.
- They should be listed here.
- Right.
Uh... Top salvo!
- [laughing]
- What did I tell you?
Gravity One Downtown!
[chuckling]
I was due for some good luck!
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Why not?
Because I don't want you with me, OK?
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?
[jingles]
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?
Don't do that again.
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa!
- Get in. Just get in, will ya?
Give me the keys first.
No, you can wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.
[Max] Sweet ride.
[Charlie] Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.
[engine starts]
[# Eminem: "'Till I Collapse"]
I'm taking all bets!
Keep up. Stay close.
Hey, hey, hey!
Charlie Kenton is in the house!
All right, all right.
- [man] Come on, man!
- Hey, Finn.
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.
- That's Noisy Boy!
- [cheering]
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.
You sure you want to fight him tonight?
What do you got, Finn? He can take any bot in this place. You know it.
[laughs] You can have any undercard you want.
- Five thousand guaranteed.
- Come on, man.
A thousand every round your bot survives.
- Fight till the death!
- [crowd cheering]
No. Give me the main event.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Finn, this is Noisy Boy.
An original Tak Mashido bot.
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!
You want to fight Midas?
Fifty thousand guaranteed, winner takes all.
Fifty? Really, 50?
Now you're talking.
[Max] Listen, listen. No, look.
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.
We should take an undercard fight, make a little cash and get the hell out of here!
All right, first, there is no "we."
Second, he's going to crush Midas, and I'm going to make real cash!
We'll take Midas!
[crowd cheering]
[metal music playing]
Yeah!
Tonight, our main event features the gold-blooded killer!
This pimped-out punk is programmed for pain!
I give to you the mighty Midas!
Whoo!
Against a bot who ran with the big boys in the WRB!
He's been on an exile tour overseas, but now he's back home and he's ready to make some noise!
Take your first look in a long time at Noisy Boy!
Crash Palace, who's ready for some destruction?!
Let's make some money! Come on!
[Finn] We have Midas against Noisy Boy.
Noisy Boy against Midas.
You've been waiting all night for this matchup, Crash Palace!
[bell rings]
Scimitar right!
Did you see that?
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!
Skull salvo! Firefight!
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?
Shockfist!
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!
Get up!
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!
I got something for you.
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!
Get up!
That's illegal!
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules!
[Finn] Now we're seeing the Midas touch.
No. Hands up!
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!
He's getting killed in there!
It's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!
Panic Shield!
That's it. One-Two Overlord!
[grunting]
No, no. Shatter Punch!
- Five Recall!
- Get some!
Jeez, damn it.
Jab, jab!
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!
[Finn] Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!
- It's party time now, Crash Palace!
- Use your left!
[Finn] Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!
No, no, no! Get up!
Get some!
He's got...
Just gotta get to the bell.
Move! Get out of the corner!
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!
I got something for you!
You ready?
[Finn] Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.
And so long to Noisy Boy.
[screaming]
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!
Well, that sucked. You hungry?
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.
I need to find a mainframe. What?
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?
Fine, more for me.
Here, drink this.
You never should have taken that fight.
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?
You had no idea how to fight that fight.
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.
Was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.
But look around you, kid. This place...
This place is where once great robots go to die.
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you just throw away.
Wow.
It's been a long night.
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.
You stay put.
I'm going to go look for some parts.
- I'm coming with you.
- Huh?
That drink has my heart pounding.
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.
Whatever. Just keep up.
[thunder crashing]
Crap.
Stay back, stay back, stay back.
All right, keep up.
These searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right, so stay close.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Keep up. It's all right.
All right. Come on, come on.
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights.
Quick! Go, go, go!
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?
Anything. Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.
- Hey, look.
- What?
It's so small.
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.
What changed?
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.
- It just faded.
- Why?
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.
You had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.
- Look at this.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.
You still had human fighters, human bodies so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted: true, no-holds-barred violence.
So the next logical step: get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.
Do you miss it?
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.
What? I want to know.
Careful, you're on a cliff.
Whoa!
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...
[Max screaming]
- Charlie!
- Max!
Charlie, help me!
Charlie!
Max! Max!
Max!
Max! Max!
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.
Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.
That's it! I've got you, Max!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.
Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.
Just give me your other hand very slowly.
Reach back. Come on. Reach!
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.
You and me.
Just look at me.
That's it. That's it.
One... two... three!
[screaming]
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.
- I got you. I got you.
- [Max panting]
You're safe. You're safe.
All right, I got you.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Come here. Easy. Easy.
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I told you it was dangerous.
Careful. We're still on the edge here.
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.
So what? Let's go. Come on.
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.
Could you just bring the cart to the edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.
You want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.
[wheels whirring]
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.
- [scoffs] It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.
You're not even in the game anymore, Charlie.
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.
Don't get loud with me.
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.
My father invested everything he had in your fight career.
We loved...
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.
What's yours?
[sighs]
You're done, right?
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.
I got nothing left.
All right.
Maybe there's something here.
This robot the kid brought in last night.
Would you look at it for me?
Please?
Bailey?
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.
- Charlie, stop.
- [Max] It's my robot!
It took me half the night dragging him out of there.
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.
But the parts we're putting in him are mine!
You idiots should see if he powers up before you start fighting over him.
What happened to you?
Hey.
[beeping]
[beeping fades]
[electronic whirring]
Whoa. Whoa.
Watch out. Stay back.
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.
He can mime your movements and store them in memory, Max.
[Charlie] You think there's anything here we could use?
- [Bailey] Not much.
- There's a bucket...
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.
Cool.
"Atom."
[Max] His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.
They must have built robots like this one that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.
OK, so can we get him a fight?
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.
You could always sell him off for parts.
Can't you get him a fight?
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."
God, you don't quit, do you?
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.
The places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your little pants.
Excellent. Get him a fight.
[mechanical chirping]
Stubborn kid.
Surprise, surprise.
[beeping]
[mechanical chirping]
[whirrs]
Let's take a walk.
[Max laughs]
[Atom whirrs]
Can you understand me?
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
[whirrs]
[Max] You've known Charlie a long time.
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.
My dad, he trained him.
That's them. That's Charlie.
- [Max] What was he like?
- [Bailey] As a boxer?
As anything.
He was something.
He was lean, tough.
No quit, no fear.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007 when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.
Charlie was just supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat but nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.
Check this out.
[Bailey] That's Charlie.
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.
- Really?
- Really.
He was toying with Nico.
The top contender, number two in the world and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.
I could.
He was beautiful.
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.
Second time for good. Lights out.
You were ahead on the scorecards going into the 12th round.
Nico Tandy rung my bell and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.
But every fight a knockout.
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.
- [Max] Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.
Wow. Here.
Keep it.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I like that kid.
He likes you.
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?
Yeah, that's what I wanted.
OK.
[mechanical chirping]
[cell phone rings]
[ringing stops]
Hey. Hey.
Look.
The champ is here. Zeus is here.
Yeah.
[announcer] Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster.
Two rounds!
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.
He just may have a real fight on his hands.
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever.
End of story. Good night!
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?
[Charlie] Come on.
All right, listen up.
I got to go find Finn.
- I want you to stay in this area, OK?
- OK.
[man] Out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.
Move, move.
Champ coming through.
[whirring]
[reporters clamoring]
[whirring continues]
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father-daughter Zeus team.
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.
You're very kind, but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.
[all clamoring]
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport out of retirement?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
[all clamoring]
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.
With his adaptive operating system he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus...
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring, the result of any fight is inevitable.
What Zeus sees...
...he kills.
Sweet.
[all clamoring]
[Zeus whirrs]
[Finn] I'm never going into business with you.
[Charlie] I just need a break here,
Finn. C'mon.
You got that old bot truck out there.
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.
I just need a little loan. Something...
What?
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.
Something. A couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.
You know I'm good for it.
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude...
...you're a bad bet, brother.
Right, yeah.
[bell ringing]
[crowd cheers at a distance]
- Get back.
- All right. All right.
[electric zapping]
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.
Where you been?
I told you to stay put.
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast.
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.
Is that what you think boxing is?
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?
He's more than that. And if you'd just get us a fight, you'd see.
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.
- Great.
- And it will be the end.
I told you I hate hamburgers!
It's a burrito!
[Max] Right uppercut.
Left uppercut.
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.
- You been up all night?
- Yeah. I cleaned him up.
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.
That's... That's lethal stuff.
Let's do this.
Jeez. Let's do breakfast first.
[rock music playing]
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?
We'll see.
[man laughs]
Let me deal with this.
Charlie Kenton. This is Max.
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?
What's this, we on a field trip?
All right.
He can fight my robot Metro.
I'll give you a 100 bucks for one two-minute round.
- Take it.
- Three hundred.
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.
How about 500 for two rounds?
[laughing] Two rounds.
Two rounds, son, he ain't going to survive one round.
- What if he does?
- He ain't.
Let's just say he does.
If he's still standing after one round...
- ...I'll give you 1,000 bucks. Shut it!
- A 1,000...
But if he dies in there, which he will, junior...
...I get to keep what's left.
Take the 100.
Deal.
We're on. We on!
Let's go!
[Charlie] You should have taken the 100.
- [Max] I got us a thousand.
- [Charlie] Yeah, if he wins.
[# The Beastie Boys:

[crowd cheers]
[groans]
You want me to drive?
He's my bot. I got this!
This ain't a video game, kid.
This is for real. Right here.
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?
All right.
I got this.
Let's get it on!
Let's get it on!
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

Don't watch Atom.
Watch your opponent. Watch him.
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.
Here comes the sledgehammer.
Did you see that?
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.
Slip right. Back step.
Duck. You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!
- Actually, I think I am.
No, no, no, no, no.
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!
That's it! Now you're listening to me.
He can take a hit. I'll give you this, kid. Your bot can take a hit.
You better slip that headlock 'cause this ain't gonna end well for you.
I'm trying!
Thirty seconds!
Thirty se... Half a minute.
Half a minute!
Keep moving! Just move!
C'mon, you've got 20 seconds!
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me... Let me take over!
- No...
- Just move, then. Move!
Come on.
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.
Count with me! Count with me!
One!
Get up, Atom!
He can't hear you... You know you're talking to a machine?
[crowd chanting] Four! Five! Six!
Get up, Atom!
All the way up! All the way up!
- No!
- Yeah!
Yes! Yes!
[indistinct]
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.
- This 1,000 bucks...
- Yeah, 1,000.
...double or nothing he can't make another round.
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.
Baby boy said it!
We're back on! We on!
Are you crazy?
You threw away a 1,000 bucks!
He can barely stand up in there.
Look, I really need the money.
I know. Let's work.
Ah, Jesus.
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.
[grunts]
- [whirrs]
- Huh?
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah!
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.
- Yes!
- No!
Start... Hey, hey! Start the count!
Start the count!
One! Two! Three!
[all chant] Four! Five! Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine!
Ten!
You did it! We did it! Wow!
[Max] Yeah!
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.
I know, I know!
I know! I know!
Kingpin, pay up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.
Saturday night.
Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.
Four grand?
You're on. Let's go!
Bailey, it's me. He won.
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.
I know.
Oh, yeah, oh, happy?
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He's been bit.
He's been bit real bad.
Yeah. Anyway, I...
...I just wanted you to know.
[mechanical chirping]
[Max] Jab.
Jab, jab, hook.
I think you have to move your feet.
Your feet. Feet.
[hip-hop music playing]
[Charlie] Nice moves, kid.
How long you been out here?
- Check it out.
- What?
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.
I killed it.
- Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.
- How did you...
I had to start over.
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush...
...and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy and it works.
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.
What works?
I got to turn it on.
[mechanical chirping]
Left jab, right uppercut!
Japan!
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart? It could be genius!
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!
Easy there, chief, easy. Whoa! Whoa!
- Did you drink all these sodas?
- I might have had a few.
- I need you to teach him to box.
- Are you kidding me?
He's nowhere near advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.
So he needs your moves.
Your commands.
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it, kid. Forget it.
You were a boxer, Charlie.
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.
Who's going to teach him to fight?
You're doing fine, Max.
You don't need me. Sorry.
That was really cool, though, that dance.
You should do that on Saturday night.
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.
A box... Are you kidding me?
This is just a show.
People want to see something they've never seen.
Look. You think of all the greats.
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer, they all had their nicknames.
They had their personas.
They all had flair.
Now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.
OK. Are you sure you're 11?
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.
You're really not messing with me?
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.
- OK.
- Cool.
- But...
- What?
I won't do it unless you help me.
[chuckles] I can't dance.
You're on your own there.
No. Boxing.
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.
And you dance.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Deal.
- [chuckles]
Deal.
All right.
It's going to be cool.
[sighs]
Nice.
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.
That's it.
Nice.
You, too, old man?
Come on. Let's get to work.
Nice! Let's do that again.
Nice. Three-punch combo.
Combo.
Again. Again.
Faster. Faster. Nice.
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.
Let's see how you move.
[chuckles] That's good.
[# Bad Meets Evil: "Fast Lane"]
[crowd cheers]
[electronic beeping]
[crowd cheering]
Step around.
Left hook. Left hook.
That's it. Every time.
[mechanical whirring]
Great fight, fellas.
[DJ] 105.5, W-R-U-T, the satellite home of robot boxing.
Caller two, what do you got for me?
[caller] Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?
[DJ] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[caller] My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.
- [DJ] Did you say "dances"?
- [caller] You heard me.
He dances pre-fight with this little kid,
and the crowd went nuts for these two.
[DJ] I'll tell you what's really something,
you put the gimmick aside for a second
and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.
Chaos. Wall Street.
One-Eyed Jack.
No slouches on that list, right?
But folks,
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.
[caller] I'm telling you, Tommy, this bot is fast!
He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!
[DJ] No doubt, no doubt.
I'm telling you, listeners,
you remember this name:
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
[both] Atom!
[DJ] This bot is one to watch.
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.
Great fight, guys.
- Kenton, you guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.
Good enough, we'd like to invite you to fight on our card,
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.
Right. Whoa.
That's a WRB... That's a League fight.
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?
You ready for the show?
Heck, yeah.
[crowd clamoring]
[Charlie] It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?
We've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.
We're going to have fun, and we gonna... we're gonna not freak out!
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.
I tell ya, man, I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...
Because, I tell ya what... Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.
What was that? One more time.
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.
[hip hop music playing]
[Charlie] Wow.
Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton and...
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.
It's a little far from the action for my liking.
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely...
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...
I'd like to buy your robot.
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.
- Done.
- He's not for sale.
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.
You are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities, a vicious League bot.
So, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!
Not now, not ever.
Listen, give me a minute to clear this up, OK?
Tak, how are you? Max!
Max. Max. Be smart.
I know you love him but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.
Think about it.
Take the offer.
You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?
Huh? Because he's different from other bots!
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller and weaker, and he's going to get his ass kicked.
He's a boxer. We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.
Charlie, we can go round and round this all night long.
Look at me, look at me.
But it's not going to happen.
I got a fight to get to.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
the march towards the Real Steel Championship
makes its way through Detroit's
Virgin America Spectrum!
Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard, the two-headed tyrant,
Twin Cities!
- [electronic beeping]
- [radio chatter]
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight, hailing from parts unknown...
...Atom!
[crowd cheers]
[dance music playing]
[laughing]
[whirring]
[indistinct shouting]
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.
All right, now this bot is tough to put down.
Atom can do it.
Max, look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?
They're controlling everything their bot does.
They're monitoring his systems, seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights, everything.
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.
So what do we do?
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.
Seriously, pray.
[referee] Ready!
- Ready!
- Hands up.
Fighters ready! Fight!
[beeping, whirring]
Engage.
[Charlie] Slip! Right!
Lean back. Right, left!
Cover up!
- [mechanical chirping]
- [radio chatter]
Duck! Left roundhouse!
Damn it.
[Charlie] Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!
What's going on in there?
Too many hits.
He's taking too many hits.
Get your hands up!
Get out of that corner! Move!
Come on, Charlie. He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!
That guy's got two heads, and about a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!
Wait, wait, wait.
Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!
- So?
- We got him! See? Here it comes again!
Duck! Spin! Slide left!
Roundhouse! One, two!
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!
Got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!
Yeah, it's working!
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!
These program modes aren't working.
Left! Right hook, slip!
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.
Three-punch combo to the body! Out! In! Counter!
- Two-one-two.
- Two-one-two.
Stay on him! Lunging right!
No!
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!
[rapid beeping]
[radio chatter]
- That's it, we got a systems crash!
- Get him, Atom!
[crowd cheers]
Damn it!
This is not happening.
This is not happening, man.
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!
Spin right!
- Finish him!
- Do it!
Right uppercut!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Ah! Ah!
- [mechanical whirring]
He's down!
One! Two! Three!
Four! Five!
- Six! Seven!
- We got him. Stay down!
He's out! He's out!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Corner!
Corner! Corner!
Victory!
[announcer] In a time of one minute, 47 seconds of the first round,
Atom has defeat...
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.
How about that?
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,
- Farra Lemkova.
- [crowd boos]
Whoa, OK, hang on.
That instead of buying my robot, and using your money to control this sport...
- [Charlie] That's it!
- Wait, I'm not done.
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?
Seriously, because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy get a shot
- at the Real Steel Championship?
- [crowd cheers wildly]
I challenge Zeus to a fight.
[crowd boos]
Any time, any place, anywhere!
You name it! We will be there!
Yeah! OK!
I'm going to get us that fight!
[crowd cheers]
[all chanting] Atom, Atom, Atom...
[chanting continues]
[echoing shout]
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.
That's one thing to call it.
I think a lot of people would like to see that fight.
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.
I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."
All right, all right. All right.
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.
[Charlie] That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.
- Whoo! All right, we set?
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do it.
- Charlie boy.
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.
I actually really was going to call you.
Don't worry about that.
That was a heck of a fight.
Congratulations to both of you.
That was really good.
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.
- Come on, man.
- What?
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?
He thought that was a joke.
How about that? It wasn't a joke.
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.
I'm sure you do, Charlie, but...
...but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!
- [Charlie] Run! Come on. Keep up!
- [Ricky] Get him now!
Run! Come on!
[Charlie] Get off him! Get off him!
Come here!
Hey, Ricky.
That's his money! Leave him out of this!
[groans]
Hey!
Stop!
[horn honks]
Stop!
Take all his money. Take it all.
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.
He's my father!
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.
Well, buddy, that will teach him.
Whoo!
Just like old times, Charlie boy!
Let's go, boys.
[Max] Charlie.
[panting] I'm sorry, Max.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...
Is it Farra?
She called you, didn't she?
- We're going to get the Zeus fight.
- Listen, it's not the Zeus people.
I've been thinking about all this, and...
[Debra] Max!
Max?
Max.
It's so good to see you.
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?
He's been beat up.
I told you he couldn't take care of him!
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.
We're fine. She can leave!
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.
Charlie, please.
Just...
Charlie, we're doing so good.
Charlie, please, no.
Don't. Don't. Don't.
Please. Please.
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.
You're too young.
You don't know.
Look at me, trust me.
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?
You tell me, what can I do?
Max!
I don't want your money, Marvin.
[Debra] Max, we have our own swimming pool and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.
What's going on?
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.
I'm going to wait in the car.
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
You knew from day one what this was.
You decided to take the ride.
I mean, what? Max, you thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap were going to ride off into the sunset? Come on.
No, you forgot who I was!
You deserve better...
...than me.
Will you say something, please?
I tried, OK. What do you want from me?
I want you to fight for me.
That's all I ever wanted.
[mid-tempo music plays]
[door opens]
No, don't ask.
So no Max.
It's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.
Did you not see the way he looked at you?
Charlie, that's the way
I looked at my dad.
Even now I would give anything to have that back.
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.
Me, come on. I blew it.
I blew it.
When Max was born I just...
...freaked out.
But something would have been better than nothing.
I just wouldn't know where to start.
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.
- You do.
- No.
You do.
I got to go.
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.
Worth it. Worth it.
Go get him, Charlie.
You sound like your dad.
Hey.
OK. Uh, look,
I know you think I abandoned you and I guess I did originally.
- Then you sold me.
- [Debra] Charlie.
- Hey.
- You have no business being here.
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...
...I'd just like to do one thing right.
Right.
- Now, where were we?
- You sold me.
- Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.
- And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.
Really dangerous. I mean, I know.
God. I'm sorry.
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?
No. I mean yes. Yes.
But no.
No, I came to tell you that I heard you.
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I wasn't there and I should have been.
I should have been.
Your mom was...
She was cool, wasn't she?
She was.
She was the coolest.
Yeah, she was.
And I'm sorry about...
...what happened with her.
And I can't get those years back,
Max, but...
...but I'm here right now...
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.
We got the Zeus fight.
What?
No, no, we didn't.
You got the Zeus fight.
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?
One night.
One night.
It's all we need. Thank you.
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.
Yeah?
What do you say?
[announcer] Welcome, everyone, to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.
Well, Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion
against the underdog, rising star Atom.
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight
outside the circle of well-known League bots
and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?
The greatest robot boxer of all time gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.
[Tim] Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena but he has made no bones about his disdain for this matchup.
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.
Take a look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,
referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton,
Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.
He did so publicly.
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.
No argument there, Tim.
And I think the Zeus camp
- knows exactly what they're doing.
- That they do. I mean, come on.
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.
And, hey, judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.
[reporters clamoring]
We can't win, can we?
We'll see.
[Tim] As the challenger makes his way into the arena, you can hear the surge of excitement, Herb.
[crowd cheers]
[Herb] Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance, using a style, some would call it human-like, that bot fighting has rarely seen.
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.
Welcome to the bigs, junior!
I'm giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.
Now who wants some?
[Ricky] I'll take some of that action.
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.
How's it going... partner?
Partner?
That's great. How about a hundred K deep? Is that funny?
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.
You carrying around that kind of scratch?
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C and you can bring me my money right to my seat.
101, row C? Hundred K?
You heard me, homey.
- Homey?
- Right?
Homeboy!
All right. Peace out, posse.
Come on, sugar. Let's go.
[regal music plays]
[announcer] Never beaten.
It's showtime!
[announcer] Never threatened.
The king of the ring, the ruler of robots!
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!
[crowd cheers]
[whirring]
Oh, shit!
That was awesome.
Come on, let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen, in a bout scheduled for five rounds for the World Robot
Boxing Championship, in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!
Showboat!
And in the corner to my left, the undeniable champion of this universe and any other universe known or unknown, the mighty Zeus!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Real Steel!
- This is what it's all about!
- [bell rings]
There's the starting bell and we are underway.
The bots emerge from their corners.
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.
- On your feet!
- [electronic whirring]
[Herb] Looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.
Referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.
Get up!
[referee] ...two, three...
Push up! Stand up!
[Herb] But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!
[Tim] And Atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.
- He's too strong! He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!
Get up and get in the game!
Come on!
No, please Atom, get up! Please!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
[Tim] Once again, the challenger finds his feet!
Lean back! Lean back!
[Herb] Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!
- Get out of there, Atom!
- Move, Atom, move!
[Tim] A demolishing inside shot.
Get your hands up!
Hands up!
Crush that little can!
Get out of the corner!
Get out of the corner!
[Herb] Charlie Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.
Cover up!
[groans] Get your feet under you!
[Tim] Good night, sparring bot!
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!
[Herb] Atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.
- Stand up!
- [crowd chanting] Two!
- Three!
- C'mon, Atom, get up!
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.
- [referee] Six! Seven!
- Get up!
[crowd continues] Eight! Nine!
[Tim] I don't believe this!
Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.
Come on, Atom!
He can't survive this!
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!
[Tim] Atom has landed a punch!
[Herb] Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut
- that he clearly never saw coming!
- Advance!
Fade back, counter right!
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross!
Left hook!
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!
Double right to the body!
[Tim] For the first time in his dominant run,
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!
[crowd cheers]
[Herb] The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!
[Tim] Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!
[Herb] Only five seconds left, as here comes that monster piston-packed right of the champ!
[bell rings]
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.
- He made it!
- [Herb] We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!
He made it!
Yeah! Corner!
We got to get out of here, darling, come on.
We got to get out of here right now!
We got to go this way.
Come on!
OK, you sit down.
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.
I'll be back for you, baby.
Get your hands off me!
[Herb] Both corners furiously working on their bots.
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre but instead they're getting a war!
- You got it?
- [Max] Yeah.
- All right. Here we go.
- What is happening?
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies.
- He will be fine.
- What next?
Round two.
[rock music playing]
- [bell rings]
- [Tim] Round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom, is giving the champ a run for his money.
[Herb] Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!
[Tim] Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!
[Herb] Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.
This is a brawl!
[Tim] The crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!
Something has to give, and it does!
Atom goes down again!
[Herb] Lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!
[Tim] And yet again,
Atom rises up.
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.
[Herb] The champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!
[electronic whirring]
[Herb] Atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!
- Hands up!
- What's going on?
I think the voice recog is shot!
- He's not responding!
- What?
[Herb] Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.
- No! Stop! Do something!
- He can't hear me!
[bell rings]
[Tim] But the bell sounds, and once again, this little robot has stunned the world!
We're done, Max!
He can't hear me.
This is murder.
We've had enough.
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- So what? He can't hear me!
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!
- No way. No way!
- Look at them. They are freaking out!
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.
- Don't ask me. Don't.
- Charlie... please.
I beg you.
Are you kidding me with those eyes?
- Damn it!
- Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what, but I know you're in there!
- Come on, Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!
Watch... me.
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.
Watch me.
An epic battle being waged here tonight, as the fifth and final round gets underway.
Come on, Atom!
[Tim] Wait a second, Herb.
Are you seeing this?
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!
[Herb] Tim, it looks like Atom has a shadow function.
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.
[Tim] Well, I tell you what, it doesn't seem to be much help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.
Charlie, help him! Fight back!
Not yet.
[Tim] Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down, furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.
[Herb] I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.
This robot seems to be running on empty.
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.
- Switch to turbo!
- [Herb] He's actually asking for more.
Please do something!
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.
Nitrous pistons, now!
Charlie, he's not going to last much longer!
- Fight back!
- Not yet.
Hang in there!
[Tim] Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!
[crowd chanting] Atom! Atom!
Atom! Atom!
[chanting continues]
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!
[Herb] Zeus is slowing down!
Tim, the champ's power core is clearly depleted.
Charlie, please!
- Hey, kid. Now.
- Now!
[electronic beeping]
Get in there!
Don't let him breathe!
Knock that little bitch!
Bust him open!
Yeah! That's right!
[electronic beeping]
Do something!
Move!
Override. Switching to manual.
[Herb] In a shocking move,
Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!
Work the body! Get inside him!
Get him, Atom!
[Herb] Look at this!
The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!
[Tim] Left! Right! Left! Right!
A huge uppercut by Atom!
Zeus is down!
- Yeah!
- [Tim] This little bot has dug deep here tonight and shown something damn near heart!
[referee] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
He's good!
[Tim] Zeus gets to his feet.
[Herb] But Kenton has
Atom on him again, landing punch after punch!
[Tim] Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.
[Herb] Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!
[Tim] It all comes down to this, folks!
Drop him, Charlie! Now!
[Herb] Kenton is about to drop the champ...
No! There's the bell!
[Tim] Zeus is saved by the bell!
[crowd cheers wildly]
No!
[Herb] Amazingly, Tim, we will go to the judges' cards!
Now, go on.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds, we go to the judges' scorecards.
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.
And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46 for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,
Zeus!
[crowd booing]
Farra... Farra...
Farra Lemkova...
...you got way more than you bargained for tonight.
Some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.
Oh, she looks pissed.
It took a little longer than we thought, but the result is as expected.
We won.
Zeus is still undefeated.
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss your bot suffered tonight?
- Nothing.
- No comment.
Max. Where's Max?
Max, let's go, go.
There he is. Max. Max.
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion."
Yeah!
Max, what do you say to that?
People's champion?
Sounds pretty good to me.
[crowd cheers wildly]
Dad? Dad!
Max! Max! Max!
- Max!
- Dad!
Max... Max, I...
I really want you to know...
No, I need you to know.
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
Wait here. Wait here.
[Atom whirrs]
[Charlie] Up!
- [crowd cheering]
- [Charlie] Yes!
Yeah!
- Yes!
- Yeah!
[Charlie] Yeah!

The very stop for original ENGLISH subtitles
I think it's our tradition.
It comes out of a particularly painful part of our history.
Yes, yes.
But it's been the way we've been able to heal.
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.
But I think it has grown from that.
I think it's something that knits us all together.
This is your third year as Gamemaker.
What defines your personal signature?
No! No!
It's okay.
You were just dreaming.
You were dreaming.
It was me.
I know. I know. But it's not.
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.
They're not gonna pick you.
Try to go to sleep.
I can't.
Just try. Just try.
Deep in the meadow
Under the willow
- A bed of grass
- A bed of grass
- A soft green pillow
- A soft green pillow
You remember that song? Okay.
You finish it. I've got to go.
Where?
I've just got to go.
But I'll be back. I love you.
I'll still cook you.
What are you gonna do with that when you kill it?
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!
What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.
Of course you were.
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.
No. Not today.
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.
Okay.
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?
Won't happen.
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.
- It's sick.
- Gale.
If no one watches, then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.
We could do it, you know?
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.
They'd catch us.
Well, maybe not.
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.
They can come, too.
Prim in the woods?
Or maybe not.
I'm never having kids.
I might, if I didn't live here.
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.
I forgot.
Here.
Oh, my God! Is this real?
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.
Happy Hunger Games.
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."
How many times is your name in today?
Forty-two.
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.
Thank you, girl.
What's this?
That's a Mockingjay.
How much?
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.
Mom.
Look at you!
You look beautiful.
But you better tuck in that tail, little duck.
I laid something out for you, too.
Okay.
Now you look beautiful, too.
Wish I looked like you.
No. I wish I looked like you, little duck.
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.
And as long as you have it, nothing bad will happen to you.
Okay? I promise.
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?
They're gonna prick your finger just to take a little bit of blood.
- You didn't say...
- I know.
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?
Next.
Go ahead. Next.
Next.
It's okay.
Welcome! Welcome, welcome.
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
Now, before we begin, we have a very special film.
Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.
War. Terrible war.
War.
Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.
This was the uprising that rocked our land.
Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them, loved them, protected them.
Brother turned on brother until nothing remained.
And then came the peace, hard fought, sorely won.
A people rose up from the ashes, and a new era was born.
But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.
We swore as a nation we would never know this treason again.
And so it was decreed that each year the various districts of Panem would offer up, in tribute, one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage, and sacrifice.
The lone victor, bathed in riches, would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness.
This is how we remember our past.
This is how we safeguard our future.
I just love that!
Now, the time has come for us to select one courageous young man and woman for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
As usual, ladies first.
Primrose Everdeen.
Where are you, dear?
Come on up.
Well, come on up.
Prim! Prim!
No. No!
I volunteer! I volunteer!
I volunteer as Tribute!
I believe we have a volunteer, Mr. Mayor.
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.
- No! No!
- Go find Mom!
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No! No! No!
- No! No! No!
- Come on.
A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.
Yes, well.
District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.
Come on, dear.
What's your name?
Katniss Everdeen.
Well, I bet my hat that was your sister, wasn't it?
Yes.
Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.
And now for the boys.
Peeta Mellark.
Here we are.
Our Tributes from District 12.
Well, go on, you two, shake hands.
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
You have three minutes.
It's okay.
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.
It isn't worth putting your name in more times. Okay?
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.
Just try to win. Maybe you can.
Of course.
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.
To protect you.
Thank you.
You can't tune out again.
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.
I won't be there anymore.
You're all she has.
No matter what you feel, you have to be there for her. Do you understand?
Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No! No! No!
I promise, Prim.
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.
I am.
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...
They will if you show them how good you are.
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.
If they don't have a bow, then you make one, okay?
You know how to hunt.
Animals.
It's no different, Katniss.
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.
Okay.
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?
You two are in for a treat.
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs, and it flies.
We'll be at The Capitol in less than two days.
Now, before you do anything else...
200 miles per hour, and you can barely feel a thing.
I think it's one of the wonderful things about this opportunity, that even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while, you get to enjoy all of this.
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.
Have you ever met him?
Haymitch?
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.
Look, you know, if you don't want to talk, I understand, but I just don't think there's anything wrong with getting a little bit of help.
Congratulations.
Where's the ice?
I don't know.
May I?
Okay, so... So when do we start?
So eager.
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?
Yeah, our mentor.
You're supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice.
Okay.
Embrace the probability of your imminent death.
And know, in your heart, that there's nothing I can do to save you.
So why are you here then?
The refreshments.
Okay, I think that's enough of that.
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.
You know, I think I'll go finish this in my room.
He's gonna come around.
It's no use.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
We have two very fit 16-year-olds.
Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.
Yes, yes, they do.
- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.
One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.
The use of the rubble in the ruined city...
Very exciting.
And this moment here, this moment is a moment that you never forget.
Yes.
The moment when a Tribute becomes a victor.
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.
That's a good way to get killed.
What's a good way to get killed?
Joy. Why don't you join us?
I was just giving some life-saving advice.
Like what?
I was just asking about how to find shelter.
Which would come in handy if, in fact, you were still alive.
How do you find shelter?
Pass the jam.
How do you find shelter?
Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart.
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.
Can you pass the marmalade?
That is mahogany!
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.
You really want to know how to stay alive?
You get people to like you.
Not what you were expecting?
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife, or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death.
And those things only come from sponsors.
And to get sponsors, you have to make people like you.
And right now, sweetheart, you're not off to a real good start.
There it is.
It's huge!
That's incredible.
Peeta, I love you.
Come on. Come on.
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.
So now that you've seen them, what do you think about this year's crop of recruits?
Are there any surprises that we can expect this year?
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,
- but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.
And whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district, that's something you can't ignore.
What's that?
We're just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna.
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.
I'm sorry that this happened to you, and I'm here to help you in any way that I can.
Most people just congratulate me.
Well, I don't see the point in that.
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.
I'm gonna take you out and show you off to the world.
So you're here to make me look pretty?
I'm here to help you make an impression.
Now, usually they dress people in the clothes from their district.
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.
I wanna do something that they're gonna remember.
Did they explain about trying to get sponsors?
Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends.
We'll see.
I just think somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up in some stupid costume, now should they?
I hope not.
Okay, this is safe. I promise.
It's not real fire. These suits are built so you won't feel a thing.
Looks pretty real to me.
Well, that's the idea.
You ready?
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
Over 100,000 people craning to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.
And the sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time.
The importance of this moment cannot be overstated.
Very nice.
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.
It's the most exciting part.
It just gives you goose bumps.
And don't you love how the stylists, they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district?
- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.
- Fishing.
- I get it.
- I like it.
- That's very good.
And behind them, we have two power plant workers. Right?
And then...
What is that in the background?
Come on. They'll love it.
Yeah!
Now see that? I love that.
Two young people holding their hands up, saying,
"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."
- Nope.
- I love that!
People are sure gonna be paying attention to them right now.
And we're ready.
President Snow, you're live.
Welcome.
Tributes, we welcome you.
We salute your courage and your sacrifice.
And we wish you
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
That was amazing.
We are all anybody's going to be talking about.
So brave.
Are you sure you should be near an open flame?
Fake flame? Are you sure you...
Let's go upstairs.
So, each of the districts get their own floor.
And because you're from 12, you get the penthouse.
Come on.
So this is the living room.
I know, I know.
Now, your rooms are right over here.
Why don't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner?
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.
One of you will be alive.
Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days, particularly to what I'm about to say.
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.
You'll have plenty of time for that in the Arena.
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.
Everybody wants to grab a sword, but most of you will die from natural causes.
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!
You little punk! He took my knife!
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.
I'll finish you right now, kid!
Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.
You're the first one I get, so watch your back.
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!
He's a Career. You know what that is?
- From District 1.
- And 2.
They train in a special academy until they're 18. Then they volunteer.
By that point, they're pretty lethal.
But they don't receive any special treatment.
In fact, they stay in the exact same apartment as you do.
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.
So how good are they?
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...
Almost.
...they can be arrogant.
And arrogance can be a big problem.
I hear you can shoot.
I'm all right.
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.
He says she hits them right in the eye every time.
- Peeta's strong.
- What?
He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour right over his head. I've seen it.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill anybody with a sack of flour.
No, but you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife.
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?
It's true. Everybody knows it.
You know what my mother said?
She said District 12 might finally have a winner.
But she wasn't talking about me.
She was talking about you.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm done, too.
Throw that metal thing over there.
What?
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed to show our skills.
I don't care what Haymitch said.
Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal.
Throw it.
Hi.
Hey.
How did you do that?
I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery.
I'll show you.
See?
Yeah.
Hey, I think you have a shadow.
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one and evaluate you.
This is important, because higher ratings will mean sponsors.
This is the time to show them everything.
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.
They'll start with District 1, so the two of you will go last.
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.
Katniss Everdeen.
Hey, Katniss?
Shoot straight.
Katniss Everdeen.
District 12.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!
Did you get some pig yet?
Thank you for your consideration.
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.
Mad?
You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us. Not just you.
They just want a good show. It's fine.
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?
Well, finally! I hope you noticed we have a serious situation.
Nice shooting, sweetheart.
What did they do when you shot the apple?
Well, they looked pretty startled.
Yeah.
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."
- Thanks for your consideration.
- "... your consideration."
Genius! Genius.
I don't think we're gonna find this funny if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...
On who? On her?
On him?
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.
I would have given anything to see it.
As you know, the Tributes were rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three days of careful evaluation.
The Gamekeepers would like to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...
From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.
From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.
Clove, with a score of 10.
From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...
From District 7...
From District 8...
And Rue with a score of seven.
Now our final district.
From District 12. Peeta Mellark.
A score of eight.
- Excellent.
- Peeta!
Bravo.
- We can work with that.
- Good job.
And finally, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen.
With a score of...
Eleven.
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!
- Yes!
- Eleven?
Congratulations.
I thought they hated me.
They must have liked your guts.
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
Goodness. We are.
An 11 ?
She earned it.
She shot an arrow at your head.
Well, at an apple.
Near your head.
Sit down.
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?
What do you mean?
I mean, why do we have a winner?
I mean, if we just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once?
Be a lot faster.
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It is the only thing stronger than fear.
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.
So...
So contain it.
Right.
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.
Haymitch, you should join us.
We're having some of your favorite for dinner.
Lovely.
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.
And they let us work with our own Tributes right before The Games, so you and I will be going down at 9:00.
What about him?
He says he wants to be trained on his own from now on.
What?
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?
We should have some chocolate-covered strawberries.
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, your master of ceremonies,
Caesar Flickerman!
Thank you! Thank you!
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
Now, in about five minutes, they're all going to be out here.
All of the Tributes that you've heard about.
Are you excited?
Let me hear it!
Amazing.
I don't feel amazing.
Don't you know how beautiful you look?
No. And I don't know how to make people like me.
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.
That's different. I wasn't trying.
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.
And just pretend that you're talking to me. Okay?
Okay.
Let's see if she does indeed shine.
Let's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer!
Glimmer, are you prepared?
Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.
I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.
- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...
...I'm wearing one of our own creations.
A big round of applause!
Marvel!
Welcome, Clove.
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.
Cato!
I find that if I can apply myself to the situation present,
I will be able to figure it out.
Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.
Good. So you can climb trees.
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?
A gatherer?
From District 12, District 12...
You know her as The Girl on Fire!
Well, we know her as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!
Welcome! Welcome.
Welcome.
Well, that was quite an entrance you made the other day.
What?
I think someone's a little nervous.
I said that was quite an entrance that you made at the Tribute Parade the other day.
Do you want to tell us about it?
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.
When you came out of that chariot,
I have to say, my heart stopped.
Did any of you experience this as well?
My heart stopped.
So did mine.
Now, tell me about the flames.
Are they real?
Yes.
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?
Yes.
What do you think, folks?
I think that's a yes.
Steady. Steady.
Lovely. Thank you.
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.
That was something. Thank you for that.
I have one more question for you.
It's about your sister.
We were all very moved, I think, when you volunteered for her at the Reaping.
Did she come and say goodbye to you?
Yes.
- She did.
- She did.
And what did you say to her in the end?
I told her that I would try to win.
That I would try to win for her.
Of course you did.
And try you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
You did it, darling. That was incredible.
Thank you.
Nice job, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Nice dress, too.
- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!
Peeta, welcome.
How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map."
It's different.
It's very different than back home.
Different. In what way? Give us an example.
Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.
- The showers?
- Yes.
We have different showers.
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?
- Take a whiff?
- All right.
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.
That makes sense.
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me, is there a special girl back home?
No. No. Not really.
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.
Well, there...
There is this one girl that I've had a crush on forever.
But I don't think she actually recognized me until the Reaping.
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.
You go out there and you win this thing, and when you get home, she'll have to go out with you.
Right, folks?
Thanks, but I don't think winning's gonna help me at all.
And why not?
Because she came here with me.
Well, that's bad luck.
Yeah, it is.
- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.
Peeta Mellark.
District 12!
What the hell was that?
You don't talk to me, and then you say you have a crush on me?
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?
Stop it! Stop it!
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.
He made you look desirable, which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.
He's right, Katniss.
Of course I'm right.
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12...
We are not star-crossed lovers.
It's a television show!
And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors, which could save your damn life.
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?
Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow.
Manners!
You, too?
Hey.
Can't sleep?
No. Of course not.
I'm sorry I went after you.
You know, I meant that as a compliment.
I know.
Listen to them.
Yeah.
I just don't want them to change me.
How would they change you?
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.
I just don't want to be another piece in their game, you know?
You mean you won't kill anyone?
No.
I mean, I'm sure I would, just like anybody else when the time came, but I just keep wishing that I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me.
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I just can't afford to think like that.
I have my sister.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front, right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.
Why not?
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.
That's not your game.
You turn, run, find high ground, look for water.
Water's your new best friend.
Don't step off that pedestal early or they'll blow you sky high.
I won't.
Katniss, you can do this.
Thanks.
Give me your arm.
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?
Your tracker.
We're up.
We're up!
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.
There are 15 out. They are flying.
Here.
Thank you.
Thirty seconds.
I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, I'd bet on you.
Twenty seconds.
Ten seconds.
Okay, they're in the tubes.
And, of course, there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon, which marks the end of another fallen Tribute.
...eight...
...nine...
Twenty-five? Got it.
He's moving now.
Well, that makes 13 gone in the first eight hours.
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"
That's actually a good impression.
Hey, lover boy!
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
You better be.
Yeah, that was her snare we found back there.
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.
Let's go.
Sir?
She is almost at the edge.
Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute.
Let's turn her around.
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...
She's heading towards the left flank.
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?
Sure. Cueing tree.
She's almost there.
Lucia, get a cannon ready.
There she is! There she is!
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.
- There she is!
- Yeah!
Here we go!
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!
Where do you think you're going?
Where you going, baby?
Three o'clock.
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.
Where are you going?
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.
Just get her, Cato!
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.
Right up there.
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!
You got this.
Go! He's got this.
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!
I'm coming for you!
Come on, Cato!
I'll do it myself.
Give me that before...
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!
Maybe you should throw the sword!
Let's just wait her out.
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.
We'll just kill her then.
Okay.
Somebody make a fire.
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.
Boys.
Thank you.
Claudius, I think those are trackerjackers.
Am I wrong?
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.
For those of you who don't know, trackerjackers are genetically engineered wasps whose venom causes searing pain, powerful hallucinations, and in extreme cases, death.
Run!
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
Not only is it lethal, but the venom of a trackerjacker sting can produce powerful hallucinations.
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
Rue?
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You want mine, too?
No, that's okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How long was I asleep?
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.
Thank you.
So what happened while I was out?
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
And the boy from my district?
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.
Is all of that true?
What?
You and him?
So where are Cato and the others?
They got all their supplies down by the lake.
It's piled up in this great big pyramid.
That sounds tempting.
Now, this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it, move on to the next fire.
Light this one last, and I'll meet you back over there.
Right.
And then I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing us.
We need a signal in case one of us gets held up.
Okay. Like what?
Here. Watch this.
Mockingjays. That's great.
Back home, we use them to signal all the time.
You try.
Okay, so if we hear that, it means we're okay and we'll be back real soon.
We're gonna be okay.
Hey, I'll see you for supper.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!
Let's go.
You stay guard and don't move until we can get back.
I want to see if she's gonna figure out this booby trap.
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines around that big pile of goodies.
She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?
I don't know what happened.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!
Our stuff!
Katniss!
Katniss, help!
Katniss!
Katniss! Help!
Katniss!
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Did you blow up the food?
Every bit of it.
Good.
You have to win.
Can you sing?
Okay.
Deep in the meadow
Under the willows
A bed of grass
A soft green pillow
Lay down your head and close your eyes
And when they open, the sun...
I'm sorry.
Don't kill her. You'll just create a martyr.
Well, it seems we've already got one.
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.
What do you want?
You have a lot of anger out there.
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.
If you can't scare them, give them something to root for.
Such as?
Young love.
So you like an underdog?
Everyone likes an underdog.
I don't.
Have you been out there?
Not personally. No.
Well, I have.
There are lots of underdogs.
Lots of coal, too.
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.
There are lots of underdogs.
And I think if you could see them, you would not root for them either.
I like you.
Be careful.
Attention, Tributes. Attention.
The regulations requiring a single victor have been suspended.
From now on, two victors may be crowned, if both originate from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.
Peeta.
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!
Hi.
It's okay.
What was it?
A sword.
It's bad, huh?
It's gonna be fine.
Katniss.
- Katniss.
- No!
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Nobody's gonna find you in here.
They already found me.
We'll just get you some medicine.
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.
We'll figure something out.
Like what?
Something.
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.
I'll do it.
That's nice.
You fed me once.
I think about that all the time.
How I tossed you that bread.
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.
I should have just gone out in the rain and...
You feel hot.
I remember the first time I saw you.
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.
And I remember when you sang in the music assembly.
The teacher said,
"Who knows The Valley Song?"
And your hand shot straight up.
Stop.
After that,
I watched you going home every day.
Every day.
Well, say something.
I'm not good at saying something.
Then come here.
Please.
Even if I don't make it...
Stop it.
Attention, Tributes. Attention.
Commencing at sunrise, there will be a feast tomorrow at the Cornucopia.
This will be no ordinary occasion.
Each of you needs something desperately.
And we plan to be generous hosts.
Your medicine.
You're not going alone.
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.
Katniss, you're not gonna risk your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?
Why are you doing this?
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.
Peeta...
Please.
Stay.
Okay.
I'll stay.
Oh, God!
Where's lover boy?
I see. You were gonna help him, right?
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad that you couldn't help your little friend.
That little girl? What was her name again?
Rue?
Yeah, well, we killed her.
And now we're gonna kill you.
You kill her?
- No!
- I heard you!
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!
You said her name!
Just this time, 12.
For Rue.
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.
No, you're not. What happened?
The girl from 2, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.
You got worse.
I'm sorry.
You need some of that, too.
I'm okay.
That feels better.
Okay. Now you.
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.
Come on.
All right.
Hi.
You're so much better.
Oh, my God, Peeta.
I hardly feel anything.
We could go home.
We could. We're the only team left.
We could go home.
We know Thresh took off.
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.
He's not gonna go someplace he doesn't know.
Foxface, she could be anywhere.
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.
Okay, I'll take the bow.
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.
Peeta?
Peeta!
Are you okay?
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!
I didn't know.
You scared me to death. Damn you.
I'm sorry.
I never even knew she was following me.
She's clever.
Too clever.
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.
What time is it?
A little after noon.
Why is it getting so dark?
Must be in a hurry to end it.
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.
Well, that's great.
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.
That's it. That's excellent.
Did you hear that?
What was that?
It's the finale.
Let's go.
Go.
Katniss!
Here!
Go on. Shoot.
Then we both go down and you'd win.
Go on. I'm dead anyway.
I always was, right?
I didn't know that till now.
How is that? Is that what they want?
- No.
- No, no.
I could still do this.
One more kill.
It's the only thing I know how to do.
Bring pride to my district.
Not that it matters.
Please!
No!
Please!
Attention. Attention, Tributes.
There has been a slight rule change.
The previous revision, allowing for two victors from the same district, has been revoked.
Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
Go ahead.
One of us should go home.
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.
No.
They don't.
Why should they?
- No!
- Trust me.
Trust me.
Together?
Together.
Okay.
One...
Two...
Three.
Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
They're not happy with you.
Why? Because I didn't die?
Because you showed them up.
Well, I'm sorry it didn't go the way they planned.
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!
This is serious. Not just for you.
They don't take these things lightly.
When they ask, you say you couldn't help yourself.
You were so in love with this boy that the thought of not being with him was unthinkable.
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?
How did you feel when you found him by that river?
I felt like the happiest person in the world.
I couldn't imagine life without him.
And what about you, Peeta?
She saved my life.
We saved each other.
Ladies and gentlemen, the star-crossed lovers from District 12, this year's victors of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What a lovely pin.
Thank you. It's from my district.
They must be very proud of you.
So what happens when we get back?
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.
I don't want to forget.
Help me.
Let me out.
Let me.. let me out.
Let me out!
Open the door!
Ah!
H1N1 trial 0697.
Approximate time of death:
0200 hours.
From initial exposure until full onset of symptoms, confirm...
22 days, six.plus hours.
Still too slow.
You have to be reasonable,
Mrs. Herring.
This strain's the most efficient one yet.
23 days is a lifetime,
Doctor.
What I need is panic.. instant panic.
Anything the matter?
If it's a question of funding,
I'm sure others would find my compensation more than fair.
. We'll need another trial subject.
. Done.
We need to expand the lab team.. more hands.
Whatever you need will be provided.
Make me a plague,
Doctor.
Malcolm S. Burr?
Age 29;
BS Biological Science,
Hopkins 2003; dual degree..
MD.PhD 2007, specializing in cytological abnormality and pathology.
Could say I spent enough time in school to earn my tenure.
Um, of course, that's not to say I don't have plenty of field experience.
If you read on, you'll notice my lab work in Mendoza, Argentina.
I was part of a social program treating the infectious agents in the livestock.
Our team was actually one of the first to identify the native H1N1 strain on the molecular..
Do you know what we do here, Dr. Burr?
As far as I'm aware, sir, you're synthesizing an H1N1 vaccine.
. You're the good guys.
. We're hired hands.
We do what we're told, what we're paid to do.
Well, what you're doing here is very noble, Doctor.
I've been on this project now for almost a year.
This is grim, ugly medicine.. nothing noble about it.
With this record, you could go anywhere.
The industry is starving for young cell doctors like yourself.
With all due respect,
Dr. Gravamen,
I've seen this disease at its worst.
And maybe I could have gone somewhere else or done something else, but.. but I need to be here, Dr. Gravamen.
Late night for a... big bad wolf to be out all alone.
Looking for a little love, Wolfie?
You know, Daddy says
I shouldn't talk to strangers.
Then again,
I got a lot of daddies.
Hello?
You shy or what?
Where am I?
Who are you?
Please.
My mother will wonder where I am, please.
. Oh. Good morning.
. Morning.
Sorry, you startled me.
I'm usually the first one here, even before the doctor.
Well, I thought
I'd get a head start.
. I couldn't sleep anyway.
. First day?
Am I that obvious?
Um, just a little polished.
Meaning?
Well, the suit.
I mean, unless you intend on reading a eulogy later, you might want to tone it down a little bit.
Been around here since the beginning, when Mrs. Herring first commissioned the project after the outbreak.
I found it comforting to know that benefactors were taking an interest in public health, not just for profit but for the greater good.
How's the progress been going?
Slow.moving but steady.
You know, H1N1 takes so many forms that it's hard to predict what's next
. to form appropriate vaccines.
. Yeah.
But we try.
You know, we all try.
And Dr. Gravamen is a great man, you know?
So I've heard.
It's like what do we got to do to be appreciated?
As much time as I spend in this lab looking at microbes, you'd think by now I'd have antenna growing out of my fucking ears.
Kenny, give it a rest.
No one wants to hear your whining in the morning.
Ha. What do you got to show for it, sunshine?
Getting up every day at 5:00 AM.
'Cause all I got is a savings account that's dwindling almost as fast as this chair rash that's growing on my ass.
Ugh!
No one wants to hear that.
Do you?
'Cause I don't.
Oh, the biotech money to be made in the private sector.
I hear you, pal. I could finally get that
Audi coupe I've been looking at.
You the new guy, the MD?
Appears so.
Um, Malcolm Burr.
. Kenny Welchman.
. Pleasure.
Never mind Francis.
He's just upset that his parents named him Francis.
I see you met our little tech Abby.
And, um, that's Cori.
Try not to listen to her.
She's a product of public school.
. Morning, staff.
. Good morning, Doctor.
. Doctor.
. Nice to see you awake.
Dr. Burr, once you've changed, if you'd be so kind.
Of course.
As you know, after its initial outbreak in South America, the native H1N1 virus has been largely contained.
Minus a body count well over 1,000.
Fair enough.
But rather than using native H1N1, we focus our research on viral variants.
Human adapted strains.
. You're mutating the virus yourselves?
. Precisely.
To provide vaccine before a more deadly strain emerges.
But predicting the random mutation of a hostile virus..
There's only a limited number of ways the virus can adapt to recognize human receptors.
We presuppose those mutations. ln synthesizing these variants in a controlled environment, we generate vaccine stocks against possible viral mutation.
Contrary to what you may believe, the most vicious H1N1 outbreak has yet to occur.
And when it does... we'll have the solution.
Hey!
Anybody there?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
Anybody?
Look, I'm sorry for whatever I did.
Just.. just let me out.
Hello!
Trial 0698: female subject, approximately 1 25 lbs, sexually active.
Barring psychological profile, remains in good health.
Treatment yet to be decided.
My God.
This morning I was stocking the database, observing recently manipulated mutant samples.
I came across an H1N1 version X fresh off the gene.therapy assembly line.
And?
And? Well... let's just say that in all my time in South America,
I never saw anything move this fast.
I mean, that virus was deadly, but this.. this..
It swallowed an entire host of T.cells right before my eyes in real time.
A strain resistant to even the most potent antivirals.
. Version X?
. It got me thinking: what if.. what if in our effort to predetermine
H1N1's mutant variants, we create a strain that we can't control?
We've been over this.
Your job here is to enact our methods,
. not question them.
. Yes yes!
. But what if..
. What if what?
We have strict security measures.. a lockdown if necessary.
I'm just saying maybe we should look over those security measures.
. Double.check the inventories..
. Burr!
Your concerns have been noted, but already taken into account.
Of course, sir.
I don't know what
I was thinking.
Don't get any ideas,
Doctor.
A conscience is one thing a scientist cannot afford.
Jerron?
Yes, Doctor?
I think we've found what we've been looking for.
Yes, Doctor.
Who's that?
Just someone
I used to know.
During your work abroad?
Yeah.
She was one of the first to get it bad.
When we admitted her, we didn't.. we had no idea what was wrong.
We thought it was the common flu.
One day she was walking around with a baby girl... the next she was flat on her back.
Even through residency, I.. it was the first time
I'd ever seen anyone die.
I'm sorry.
It's.. the photo's just a reminder, you know, of who we're trying to help.
What's at stake.
Yeah. Come on.
Let's get some food, huh?
Trial 0698, continuous.
Administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Hello?
What's going on?
Who are you?
What are you.. what are you doing?
Stop!
No don't!
No no!
Please don't hurt me.
No! No!
No, please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt.. ah!
Trial 0698.
Administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Treatment successful.
Approximate time of first contact and infection:
1900 hours.
Based on the observed virus spread, estimated life expectancy: three days.
Get her off me!
No no no.
No no no!
Don't!
Jerron, subdue the patient at all costs.
Do you hear me?
At all costs.
Jerron, that duct leads into the main lab.
She's entering the lab.
. See, look. Look.
. God, you're foul.
Do you know how many germs you just put back in there?
. That's disgusting.
. Go on, finish your story.
She's in the lab.
I'm taking somebody home tonight even if I have to use a U.Haul.
You know what I mean?
Like she's gotta..
It's not funny.
It's wrong.
You gotta eat what's on your plate.
I'm not gonna starve or go home by myself.
What the fuck?
You gotta help me.
You gotta help me!
. He's coming.
. Hey. Hey, calm down.
. What's wrong?
. He's coming.
. Who's coming? What's wrong?
. He's coming!
. Who's..
. You have to hide me.
. Please hide me.
. Hide you from who?
. Calm down. Who's coming?
. Please hide me.
Subject has just entered the staff lounge.
. You have to hide me, please.
. Hide you from who?
. Tell us what is going on.
. What's wrong?
. Please!
. Who's coming?
Ah! Stay the fuck away from me!
. Stay away from me.
. Who the hell are you?
Stay the fuck away!
Please help me!
. Fuck me.
. Oh God.
Oh shit.
What have you done?
What have you done?
Malcolm, don't.
. Oh my God.
. Oh shit.
Jerron, leave them and come back here at once.
At once!
Yes, Doctor.
Doctor?
Oh my fucking God.
I don't understand.
Herring residence.
Gravamen for Mrs. Herring.
Yes.
One moment, Doctor.
What is it?
Mrs. Herring, there's been an accident.
She's infected.
Oh shit.
Listen, Doctor, if you can't contain your patient that's your own fault.
These consequences are on you.
I assume full responsibility.
Now we've already lost one trial subject, but there is a silver lining.
We've gained your staff.
If the sample is as strong as you suggest, we'll soon be rid of the problem anyway.
Accidents do happen.
You know what you must do.
It'll be taken care of.
I grow tired of shortcomings, Doctor.
Now please, I must get back to my guests.
God forgive me.
What the hell's that?
What the hell is that?
What's going on?
. They're shutting us in.
. The lab's locking down.
We gotta get out of here!
. We can't just leave her.
. Then you fucking stay.
. Come on, come on!
. Abby, come on!
Please, Abby.
Please.
We're in here!
We're in here!
Come on!
Which way, Abby?
Abby, where's the exit?
Malcolm, we've.. we've tested the lockdown.
Fuck!
We're in here!
You gotta let us out.
It's secure, Malcolm.
There's no way out.
No.
Trial continuous.. administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Estimated life expectancy: three days.
. It's too tight.
. Okay.
. Yeah.
. There. Okay.
Guys, I don't feel right.
I mean, I'm really cold but I can't stop sweating.
Kenny, will you pass her the blanket?
Yeah.
. Ready?
. Mm.hmm.
Doctor?
Doctor, are you there?
Can you hear me?
It's Vox.
Doctor,
I know you're there.
Get rid of him.
Respond.
Jerron.
Jerron, I need to speak to Dr. Gravamen.
I'm sorry, Dr. Vox.
The good doctor is indisposed at the moment.
All right then.
Whatever the hell that means.
Look, I need you to get me out of here.
Just open the lab doors long enough for me to sneak out.
Whatever the hell you guys have planned,
I don't need to be a part of it.
Just as long as
I'm taken care of.
Regretfully,
Mrs. Herring has no plans of opening the lockdown.
Plans?
Fuck her plans!
You tell Mrs. Herring that I'm in here.
She'll listen to you.
Tell her whatever she paid me,
I'll give it back.
You just tell her.
Mrs. Herring is extremely appreciative of your sacrifice,
Dr. Vox.
My sacrifice?
You listen, you cold.blooded asshole.
This is your fault, not mine!
I'm an asset.
I'm dependable.
I am the eyes and ears in here looking out for that bitch's affairs, not you!
You're just the hired guns coming in blazing.
Now you get those doors open.
I apologize, Dr. Vox, but this transmission is over.
Jerron?
Jerron!
Jerron?
Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.
Jerron!
Okay, you're done.
You're next.
No way, Burr.
Nobody's pricking me with anything.
I feel fine.
Fuckin' aces.
How's it look?
. Anything?
. Nada.
Not a damn thing.
Wireless is dead too.
CPUs just keep roving and roving.
The shutdown scrambled the system.
All the outside lines are dead.
It is so cold in here.
Jesus.
Give me good news, Burr.
Tell me these shakes I got are just my nerves.
Sorry.
What's the damage?
After analyzing our blood samples,
I have to conclude that we've all been infected with a particularly aggressive viral mutation.
The same strain of H1N1
I observed the other day.
Oh shit.
How nasty is it?
It's fast, both airborne and blood.borne.
Though minus the sample from Francis, it's already in our blood.. all of us, mutating.
Christ Almighty.
How long do we have?
I can't be sure.
But according to my observational report, a healthy human host has approximately... three days.
Five at most.
We're fucked.
We're all fucked.
No. No we're not.
We're not.
I mean, come on. There's got to be something that we can do.
I mean, we've been working on these vaccines for all of these strands from the very beginning.
Right? Right?
We have speculative antivirals.
We have high.dose inhaler cocktails that can stop the on.spread.
Um, we empty out the fridges.
We use everything we have to formulate a proper vaccine.
I just wish we could get in touch with the doctor. I wish there was some way..
What the hell is wrong with you all?
Dr. Gravamen would know what to do.
He always knew what to do.
Open your eyes!
Those doors are closed.
Nobody is coming for us.
Not Gravamen, not anyone!
We're in here alone.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
The girl.
What about her?
She must have come out of some rabbit hole, right?
Start pumping the antivirals.
Test any vaccine we've got.
I'm gonna crawl through and see what I can find.
No no,
I don't like this.
There've already been too many surprises.
I think we should stick together.
We shouldn't separate.
I'll go with you.
Ladies first.
Please, after you.
They'll tell them everything, Doctor.
Doesn't matter.
Hmm.
Cruel to let the rats run the maze when there is only dead ends.
Must be an auxiliary lab.
You ever seen it before?
No.
My God.
Malcolm, don't.
Is he alive?
Cardiac repression, uh, blood loss, shock.
Been dead about six to eight hours.
Help. Help me.
I need a fluid lV and an injection of antivirals, STAT!
Move it, people!
Move!
. What's wrong with him?
. He's infected.
We starting a club?
We're all fuckin' infected.
No idea how long he's been alone without food or water in isolation.
Where's that shot, Abby?
. Where's that shot?
. Coming up.
. Hold him!
. Shit! Shit!
Oh my God!
The vaccine.. vaccine.
The vaccine?
Find the doctor..
Gravamen.
Gravamen!
. Jesus Christ.
. It can't be.
No.
No no no!
Help me stabilize him!
. Shit!
. Help me stabilize him!
Hold him down!
Oh God.
You got another one of those?
Countless.. countless hours of research.
And all thinking that we're working for some better good.
If Gravamen has had a vaccine, what have we been doing here this whole time?
You can't believe what that guy said.
It could have been brain aneurysms or shock.
It must be nice living in the dark, Abby.
Face it, Gravamen's out there just counting the time.
Waiting for us to rot.
We have more control than you may think.
The virus isn't in the streets.
It's not in the cities or the countryside.
It's in here.. it's in you; it's in me; it's in all of us.
. Spit it out, Burr.
. The virus is a weapon.
Like nothing
I've ever seen.
And personally, I'm not ready to lie down and allow a worldwide pandemic.
We burn this place from the inside.
. What?
. Shit, Burr.
Burn down the lab?
You're losing your fucking mind.
There's more than enough combustibles here to do it.
It is absolutely feasible.
Oh yeah!
It's fuckin' genius.
Why don't we all just kill ourselves?
With none of the antivirals taking effect, we're already living on borrowed time.
We do this now.. make it right.
No. If Gravamen's got a vaccine, maybe there's a chance.
All we have to do..
Don't you understand?
It doesn't matter what Gravamen has!
He's out there and we're in here.
He's out there and we're in here.
What?
. He's out there...
. What? What is it?
...and we're in here.
He's out there and we're in here.
Yeah, I heard you.
I knew it was just a matter of time before we all went a little batshit crazy.
The lockdown happened immediately without any relay.
Where was Gravamen?
How did he know?
. What are you saying?
. He's watching us.
Here.
An eye in the sky.
No, can't be.
He put cameras in the wall?
Sick motherfucker!
You see me Gravamen?!
You see this?
You sick motherfucker.
Francis!
Francis! Francis.
. Get off me!
. It's all right.
Get off me!
Get off me!
Blow it out your ass, fucking Welchman!
Get off me!
As for the rest of you, do whatever you want.
You can suck Malcolm's shoes for all I care.
Just count me out.
Fuckin' idiots.
They want to give up and set themselves on fire. ldiots!
Doctor?
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
I picture you watching me, but it just doesn't make sense.
You were always so kind.
A kindness you can see in the eyes.
It's my sister's birthday this week.
She's turning 18.
She's supposed to come visit me, maybe look at campuses.
I haven't even thought about her.
I talk about you with my family, you know?
All the work we're doing.
They keep asking me to move home.
I tell them, ''No no.''
''The doctor needs me.
I'm making a difference.''
Abby?
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I usually don't do this.
It's just..
I just thought he was a good man.
I just feel so stupid.
You didn't do anything wrong, Abby.
I trusted him.
We all did.
He fooled every one of us.
Right now we have to do what's right.
Malcolm.
I don't want to die.
What is it... about a person's mechanics that makes them so desperate when cornered?
So dramatically unpredictable?
That's what pleases me about you...
Doctor.
You.. you are reliable.
I believe I admire that.
Little help.
We don't need no water.
Let the motherfucker burn.
This should be enough fireworks.
This is flammable.
Kenny, what are we doing?
Look at this.
You tell me we're doing the right thing, Kenny.
The right thing?
I don't know what the right thing is.
This is something.
Gravamen's watching us, right?
So he's not going to let us burn this place down.. all the work we've done.
He's gonna see this, he's gonna open the doors and we're gonna be out of here, okay?
I'm getting out of here.
You're coming with me.
Yeah.
I don't want to be here.
Kenny, I want to go home.
I don't want to go out like this.
This is insane.
You look like shit.
Stupid.
It'll be okay.
Gravamen!
Gravamen!
Gravamen!
I should have known you were watching us.
Are you paranoid?
You should be, you stupid bastard.
All the nooks and crannies in this bunker.. they're perfect for your secrets.
Secrets I helped you hide!
I see you.
You know I never liked you.
Something about those beady little eyes.
And I knew..
I knew that this was gonna be bad.
What are you doing,
Doctor?
And those fucking idealists in there..
Malcolm, fucking Abby.
They don't account for scumbags like you and me.
But you got me.
You got me!
That says something.
Now I'm talking to ghosts.
Gravamen!
Fascinating.
Gravamen!
Cori?
Gravamen!
It's too late!
Gravamen!
Oh my God.
Cori.
Listen, hang on.
No.
I'm sorry, man.
Stay with me, Francis!
No, baby.
Please, no.
Oh God, Francis.
Hold on, Francis.
Come on, Francis.
It's faster, Abby.
It's faster than
I thought.
Oh God.
Oh no.
Doctor?
Yes?
Madame?
Ah, good morning, Jerron, my most loyal compatriot.
How's my little experiment coming along?
Progressing very well,
Madame.
There have been five casualties already.
Five?
So fast.
Gravamen and his worker bees have outdone themselves.
By the look of the others, we may expect a complete body count in the coming days.
Ah.
Excellent, Jerron.
That's excellent news on an excellent morning.
But there has been a complication. lsn't there always?
The karma of good news and its backlash.
It appears the good doctor has surprised me, deviating from his typical behavioral pattern.
Gravamen.
What headache has he cooked up for me now?
He has taken it upon himself to override the lockdown, Madame.
He what?
He is in the lab.
Jerron, listen very carefully.
With a virus strain this fast and effective, the work is done.
Gravamen and any others are immediately expendable.
I give you full warrant to dispatch of them any way possible.
Don't let anyone out of that lab, Jerron.
You understand?
Of course, Madame.
Kenny.
No.
You son of a bitch, you let them die!
Same as pulling a trigger or dragging a knife across our throats.
. She had a plan, Malcolm.
. Who had a plan?
Danita Herring, my benefactor.
You think I wanted this?
. I'm just a doctor.
. Bullshit.
. What about the girl?
. Just a trial subject.
Trial subject?
A guinea pig.
I'm just doing what I was told, what I was paid to do.
I hope you were paid well.
You pig.
Years ago, after H1N1 first hit,
I developed an angel antidote.. an inhibitor that not only stopped the production of the virus, but also caused it to literally destroy itself.
But the epidemic had slowed, so she commissioned me to mutate the virus into something uncontrollable.. fast, a horror.
A horror you were going to unleash on the public!
Danita wanted the world desperate.
She wanted them terrified, frenzied.
She would be hailed as a savior.
She would be a hero.
She'd make millions.
Billions, Malcolm, billions.
So that's what we've been doing.
That's what we've been doing this entire time.
We're nothing but pawns for a rich woman's sick scheme.
I'm sorry, Abby.
I'm so sorry.
Don't you dare.
You used us.
I found myself doing things.
I heard myself saying things.
I'm weak.
I couldn't watch you,
Abby, suffering.
The antidote, where is it?
She keeps it in a medical facility not more than
10 miles from here.
So we still have time.
We release the antidote before Herring has a chance to unleash it on the world.
How can we trust what he says?
Good God in heaven.
Hey, Doc.
So nice you could join the party.
How rude of me.
It's not like we have a choice.
Ah ah ah ah.
Oh no.
Will he listen to you?
Hardly.
He's Herring's wind.up toy.
Tsk tsk, Doctor.
You disappointed your employer.
Step aside, Jerron.
Herring's already got what she needs.
The virus is already as strong and deadly as it will ever be.
Where are you running off to then?
Making trouble?
There's no need for anyone else to die, Jerron.
On the contrary, Doctor.
You are as expendable as all the others.
I'm not afraid of you, Jerron.
I know what you are.
Do you?
I wonder at times when I watch you what makes you act.
What it feels like to hurt.
To know death is close.
Rattling.
So delicate, so fragile, your bodies... your sex... quivering, rotting.
Don't touch her!
Malcolm. ln a way,
I believe I envy you.
You sense your end, your mortality.
At this moment you were never more alive on the eve of death.
You're not.. you're not human.
Sadly.
Pity, isn't it, Doctor? ln death, they're not so colorful.
Just do it.
Do it already.
Ahh!
I believe I envy you.
So vulnerable.
So fragile.
At this moment... you are in the moment.
You were never more alive.
You sense your end, your mortality.
Mortality.
I see it when I watch you.
What it feels like to hurt.
To know death is close.
Rattling.
Danita Herring.
How'd you get in here?
We found your little stash,
Mrs. Herring.
Who are you?
Gravamen's vaccine works wonders. ln the right hands, it's worth a fortune.
Do I know you?
No.
No, you don't.
But we know you.
Where am I?
Let me out of here.
I demand you let me out of here at once.
What do you want?
I'll give you anything.
No.
No.
You can't do this to me!
Please.
Please please.
Please please.
Please.
You can't.

I do not know. It is the curse of

Life is full of risks, man.
If you do not want to risk, better not to live.

Sorry, but in Greece women speak frankly.

You're stupid.

- Imagine that!
Shame. What they want show?
The Pierluigi and the waiter.

You know what they want, because they are afraid of dogs?
That is, just not afraid...
You know what's the matter?
- You do not want.

Yes, you. And you're right.
Everyone here wants to.
- I was very happy.
- I do not. And I have no car.
I once had a car. My left my father when he died.

You know something?
Why do not you come back in Australia
Lia? Nobody wants you here.

Well, just answer me something.
No, I love him.
It is more convoluted.
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.
You know what I am? "A good fool who seeks answers.
My mother was great singer.
Better than me.
My father built shop for it.
When he died,
He went crazy.
He began to drink, playing cards.
I could not see him.
I went to Athens
I career.
A few years ago he sold half shop on Michael, because of debts.
Michael bought under one condition.
- To sing too.
- You want, not the shop.
He got what he wanted?
Michael and I married.
We will announce the christening.
So, you want.
Men are not listening, right?
- What...?
- Shut up.
Life, I want to say something.
I never liked summer romance.
- But since I met you...
- No, Steve.
This will not happen again, understand?
I was a little drunk last night.
I can do better.
Many women, too many,
I think...
- Steve, do not hear me.
- Above-average...
- But when I drink...
- This will not happen again.
And nobody would know.
- I want to go.
- Here is my home.
All right. You can go to get dressed?
Come in please!
I got something for you.

Hurt me, Frank.
With wounded as no other woman.
No need to boasted, asshole.
- The taxi me. I'm checking out.
- Where are you going?
Broke my heart, Steve.
Broke my heart.
Do not talk like the "Godfather" and tell me what the hell you mean!
I hope it was worth our friendship.
Frank, what happens?
Are you leaving?
No, I know chicks the tail.
- No, I'm okay.

Frank does not speak.
I understood why.
He thinks he slept with Miss
Italy. You will to'kana it!

Why are all weird this? Glad you came.
Tell Manolis that he give the
Tavern for baptism, for free.

Thanks, Stavros.
Thank you.
I mean...
How do you say when are you shocked?
- Shocked.
- Okay, I do this.
We... we...
- How do we say, "We lied"?
- We lied.
We lied from the beginning.
We thought it would take shop and we drove.
We wanted to be rid of.
Trust me, cousin. I did not know that Panos was your father.
How did this to me? We family! Do not do that!
Sorry, cousins. Sorry.
Okay I am now.
Who wants frappe?
This is my mother...
By Panos.
- We want to help you.
- Do you speak English?
From it the better idiot.
Everyone knows that the "beach" spelled with two "e"!
Sorry not to trusted, cousins.
Tell me... How I did it this Steve? Tell me.
Dude, Mykonos blows the cover- and worse than ourselves.
Grab the cake.
You're not as dumb look.
I have RhD land use.
I did two years woodworking.
And no one jumped yesterday.
We both lost our time.
Not every relationship with sex, patriot.
Yes they are.
You know my name, Frank?
- King of Mykonos.
- I know.
- Forty women in a month.
-43. But go for many years.
You know how old I am?
Forty-nine.
Not at all bad!
You know how they keep
Such a body at my age?
On steroids?
You know what they are doing steroids?
As a snail chonetai back to the shell.
Many details, man!
By freak!
Franco, come here.
To speak honestly...?
As an Italian to Italy?
- Not being a woman, right?
- I'm From the Jersey.
In Mykonos nothing is not true.
No need to shoot women for na'sai king.
I'll show you something.
Look here.
This is my gift
Mykonos.
This makes true king.
I work for hotels Chariot.
The third largest chain in the world.
Michael and I we are working on this years.
It stretches from Main Super to the beach Panos.
- On the beach, Steve?
- Panos resisted.
'So represents the Italian...
... For this thing?
I did because the Americans do not jump here.
What is the chick the beach?
- It's hot...
- I would make an effort.
Give me your SIM...
Dos'ti me!
After that you did, we're not friends anymore.
But I love you like a brother and this is my gift.
- The skatokinito you?
- No, stupid! This pou'chei in!
Plans for Mike beach. And best microphone.
- Look and listen.
- Frank, I did not go with 'Enza.
- What?
- By Miss Italy.

You're the best!
You do not know from Greekonomics;

Munich. Great news.
Apollo comes from ibex.
They have almost disappeared.
It is a national treasure AP'TIN
Crete. It would would render here.
Please!
Is invited!
- The kid is invited?
- Is that a joke?
And they say that the Germans have no sense of humor!
Let us emulate them.
Very nice, man!
Be careful not to happen to you no pulling!
It happens to pull!
As you know, Zoe and I we are together a long time.
We have a date the end of the month.
How to arrange
Michael so many relatives?
- I will fill the resort?
- Are you crazy?
Not to press
Greeks there!
The staff will come from London.
The Chariot does not work with locals. Is the new Europe.
Tell them the hotel, Michael.
Tell them how to take care when they are on the road.
Believe him? Is a liar!
From the mind of the turns.
Really?
Then how this phone...
... Is full of pictures of
Resort from here to the beach?
You find the Apollo.
Calm down. Coping alone it. It is a great kid.
I laugh to be quite polite.
Enough so, do you think?
Yes, let's stop.
Cousin, come to dance.
I dance better moonwaIk, you know...
Come... I'll show you.
I came back, Steve! Spin!
I read the book!
Thanks, pal!
Come to dance.
- What was that?
- Mike from the beach.
It was lucky that failed, would otherwise be on the menu tonight.
You can not kill him.
It is a protected species.
He entered illegally, disturbing...
... And dig everywhere, Michael had every right.
Michael, I thought you were good man, but they're not.
- Really?
- Yes... M'echeis piss off.
And did you wrong, pal.
Big mistake.
Come on, buddy. Not worth it.
Come on, Steve.
Come on, do not deserve.

Ta'kane on it. Came in bad man. Came in badly.
Enjoy your book?
Usually I read such but yes, it's good.
Thanks. I wrote it.
You're the 'Enza Patsilo...
It's amazing!
I sit down?
You know, I like very this book.
I understood, you know.
I understood.
All these types that follow...
Obviously what they want, but you want something else.
Tell me.
You seem a person at all, but what are you waiting for...
... Is someone who discover what is hidden.
Very good.
Thanks. I sensitive guy.
What do you think you have to do?
This was the cue from Main book me. Page 53.
- Trying to bring me.
- I'm not trying to get her.
And it was on page 53.
It was on page 57.
Since I first saw at...
I do not care anymore to be a
King of Mykonos.
What should I do?
He continued to read.
- Where are you going?
- In my secret beach.
- Where?
- If the saying, will not be secret.
Secret beach...
How many beaches are there?
Oh, many!
I'm going to court. Help me and we will get back to the shop.
Not. The Seven Sins lost anymore.
Nobody beats Michael. Of owned everything and everyone.
You never lose.
Sell the beach and go, before they lose everything, like me.
Present.

You son of Panos Karamitsou.

If there is something else provide Mr. Karamitsos...
Mr President, I have something.
True my father sent letters to Australia.
They tell the whole story.
I sent them, but I want the weekend.
Please, Mr President.
Only at the weekend.
Well... Just because
I want to see the rally.
Thank you, Mr President...
Thanks.
You have a Monday.
- No, no letters.
- And what would you do?
The question is, what made a Mykoniatis?
Asshole, what are you doing here?
You have finished.
Wins the rally for the 15th consecutive year...
... And Monday
I'll take you to the beach.
Why wait?
I dare ya. At rallies.
The winner takes it all.
You win, you get to the beach.
I win, leave me quiet...
And give to Life the Seven Sins.
I knew it. Bluff.
There are no letters.
Sorry, you bet.
Get out of here.
I thought that Mykonos
're gamblers.
- We are not stupid.
- Life is full of risks, man.
Are you a ranter, man.
With fear?
- I be in fear?
- Are you big chicken.
Okay, kangaroo.
See you at the rally.
And I will show you what the true king of the island.
The winner takes it all.
The winner takes it all.
I'll take everything you have and everything you want.
I've xanapathei it.
- To get to the chase?
- Sure, damn.
What do you want? "Guns, drugs.
Can you find it, damn.
Parts car.
- Parts?
- Yes, tonight.
Want to put drugs to spare.
No, plain parts.
Can you?
Yes, but...
This is not illegal, damn!
- To steal the spare parts?
- Map of Villa Mike.
The garage has 20 cars.
Take what you want.
Perfect, damn!
Well, listen.
Tomorrow I want you awake.
Michael is desperate.
Together we can win.
Michael is very smart.
It's useless.
They have all in breast pocket.
Have you heard of Gallipoli?
- The pasta with shrimp?
- No. They Anzacs.
Australians and New Zealanders in World.
I had to get a beach at Gallipoli, but failed.
Thrown in waves the enemy lines...
... And slaughtered again and again.
- Took to the beach?
- No. They took every inch with blood.
Hence, inch-inch got to the beach.
No, because then repelled them.
I knew that would be killed, yet risked everything.
Why do you say that?
It's depressing!
Only if you risk everything get what you want.
I continue to struggle and not put it down.
As the Anzacs against the Turks.
- They fought the Turks?
- Yes. This is not the issue.
How long held
Turks in Greece?
- Four hundred years ago.
- Exactly.
I heard that the grandmother of Michael is the 1/16 Turkish.
- Bastards!
- What is that noise?
Did you find the parts?
Come to know family.
You are the Greeks are all relatives, damn!
We Greeks, I mean.
- Where are the other cars?
- Michael lubricate them all.
You both of you.
Life turned AP'TIN Athens.
My heartbreak!
- Looks?
- No.
I feel like I'm a film of Elvis!
Look here!
My father very wog!
Very good, damn it!
Stop!
Are you crazy?...
I'll kill you!
- Stop immediately the race!
- From this it depends a lot of people!
From the kid you, idiot!
On the beach, Michael dug another one like that.
- And then?
- It's proof you were looking for!
A pre-Neolithic culture on the island!
The beaches are are archaeological sites.
The coin proves it.
- Show me that proof!
- It's inside the goat.
Ate. We expect to draw from yesterday.
- And you lost?
- Germans are not shepherds.
If you find the kid...
The state will get
Beach me.
- Where have you seen lately?
- In the town before the match.
You are Greeks not you know rally, damn.
The Kid!
We must follow
The Kid!
Frank, on the other hand the city. Tony, in the harbor.
The rest will be divided in the city. Go, go!
Steve, wait!
We must talk to you.
I have others in mind this time.
- You saw a kid?
- No.
The next time three sugars, damn!
I'll be back and leave.
Nice ass...
You're not like blackjack.
Help!
We gotta go!
'I come, baby! 'Il!
You saw a kid?
Look! Mr. Yellow Belt
Greek Style!
I was very happy, guys.
I thought the Masters tae-kwon-do talk away.
- Want a fight?
- Yes. She likes?
Not me. My wife.
It is Spartan.
- How important is Apollo?
- Swallowed such a currency.
If you find it,
Michael was destroyed.
- And keep the beach?
- No. But we will fall together!
- As at Gallipoli.
- Exactly.
The pasta with shrimp?
- Are you okay?
- Yes. "I got cramp.
You found my secret beach.
I think I will vomit.
Not in person, man!
Not the hair!
- Steve Karamitsos?
- Down here!
On the ferry to Athens, Dad
I said that Apollo...
... It was a dowry in marriage
Panos with your mother.
- Was married?
- Yes, for a month.
This is a copy the marriage license.
Congratulations your heritage.
This is great.
Too bad I would not hold.
This currency is the shit proof that my beach...
... And Michael Beach are archaeological sites.
Please call the beaches
Super Apollo and Apollo.
I will appeal. Nobody
I get to the beach.
You know who I am?
I have known the government!
Over, Michael.
I would say when he finished.
Got it?
Give your phone.
Give the phone, Mori!
Greek singer. I do this three times a week.
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>
There is but one path.
We kill them all.
I'm your Dominus.
I will have your fucking hearts!
Quintus...
Lucretia!
What would you do?
To hold your wife again?
To feel the warmth
of her skin?
The taste of her lips?
How many men
would you kill?
I left the deed
in Barca's hands.
Now you're free.
We have been betrayed by the Beast of fucking Carthage.
You are beneath me.
Arghh!
He is a Magistrate!
One can never know who
is plotting violence, can one.
Or when they may
commit the act.
Your wife,
she moves ever closer,
even as we speak.
My word is kept.
They're reunited.
You will become the greatest
Lanistain the republic.
And as such a title we will
climb beyond our station,
beyond Capua,
perhaps to the very steps
of the Senate itself.
The fights are particularly entertaining today.
You'd enjoy them more viewed from the pulvinus.
Fucking shit eater.
Let Vettius preen like a woman.
You'll school him in the ways of men, when Gannicus takes to the sands.
Ahh, absent Tullius and the Magistrate to bear witness,
what's the fucking purpose?
One man in today's games.
One only, and the seat sneeding to impress
stand empty
as Vettius' fucking head.
Get up! Get up!
Solonius! What news?
Tullius and the Magistrate were delayed with pressing business, but arrive shortly.
As long as the current match continues...
No.
Get up!
Good day!
Get up, get up you fuck...
Vettius begins the match without proper instruction?
Proper?
Vettius and the word
are of distant relations.
I for one am grateful to be spared his oratory.
The man's voice causes skull to ache.
Gannicus takes position!
Now there's a fucking gladiator!
Take his fucking face off!
Begin!
Is your man ever of a serious note?
He'd strip naked and fight with his cock,
as long as he wins.
Gannicus, I love you.
What is he doing Quintus...
Fucking kill him!
No!
Wait just a little while.
Gannicus, do not kill him.
DO NOT KILL HIM.
Noooo!
Now they arrive.
A victory regardless.
Won in dewy morn.
None of the important
matches happen until after the midday sun has passed.
Consider yourself fortunate to have a man in the games at all.
Good Solonius stands with empty hands.
Come then.
Let us see them filled with drink.
Tell Doctore to see
Gannicus back to the ludus.
And properly rewarded for his showing.
Can we not stay for the rest of the games?
Vettius' men command the prominent matches.
He has more than enough eyes to watch him stroke his cock.
I would not add ours to the sight.
Now you love me, Capua.
Doctore.
Dominus orders Gannicus returned to the ludus, and seen to reward.
Perhaps one day the pretty little bitch will fight later in the afternoon.
With the rest of the men.
You and your tiny cock best pray that day never come.
Save blood for the fucking sands, Gannicus.
What seized fucking brain, releasing your swords in the arena?
I could have killed the man absent an arm and both fucking legs.
Hubris.
A fine quality.
Often possessed by cunts who perish from it.
Ahh!
Did you catch the manner of his eye, as he gazed down from the pulvinus?
Fucking Vettius.
Barely free of his mother's tit, yet carries himself above lanistas of more deserving years.
Youth often imagines itself swollen beyond its worth.
Time will cure him of the condition, as it does all foolish young men.
Time is what he holds in abundance.
The new arena will be finished in but a handful of months.
If we are excluded from the opening games...
Vettius is but shit from a shit town.
How could Tullius and the Magistrate favor a boy from Nola over Capua's own sons?
How do they do it now?
We must prove ourselves in the more important bouts in the old arena and secure position.
To fight later in the day we must first distinguish ourselves against Vettius' men.
Yet Vettius' men only fight later in the day.
A vexing conundrum.
Lucretia?!
Gaia!
Gaia!
How come you to Capua without telling me?
I have only this moment returned,
with intentions
of seeking you out.
Do you travel with your husband?
He takes to road no more.
Not in this life, at least.
Apologies.
None required.
It was his time.
Are you occupied?
I am fit to bursting with stories of my adventures.
Quintus...?
What man dares stand between women and gossip?
You must tell me everything.
Secret no detail.
Removed from the ears of men, my lips willingly part...
Gaia returns unencumbered.
And in enticing form.
Huh, that woman is a force of fucking nature.
One that has blown many an unsuspecting man to his ruin.
You require someone more refined to grace armas our fortunes rise.
Have eyes ever beheld such a marvel?
A sight to put the Circus
Maximus in Rome to bitter shame.
We will be the ones shamed, if grand ceremony passes absent our gladiators.
We must force advantage, before opportunity slips from grasp.
No, we must be patient.
Your father would venture forth with respect and caution.
Then a blessing he is not present.
Perhaps we should send word to him in Sicilia, petition advice...?
I can already divine content of his reply.
Which is why he never rose above his humble station.
Fuck patience!
Ahh.
Look to Tullius for the way!
He seizes opportunity by the balls while lesser men are left holding cock!
A simple merchant, yet he gives honored counsel to the Magistrate and all the rest of the noble shit eaters of Capua.
Truth told, yet at excessive volume.
I would shout his praise to the fucking heavens.
His hands shaped events resulting in the erection of the new arena.
He supplies slaves from the furthest reaches of the Republic to speed its completion.
Through the ambitions of Tullius,
Capua is elevated.
A lesson to be studied,
and reproduced in kind.
Is that all?
A simple task then, Batiatus.
Dominus.
Between us, we have the greatest gladiators in Capua.
Barca, Acadeus, Gannicus...
Men forged into something beyond their worth.
Beyond anything that smug little piss Vettius could ever hope to offer...
Perhaps Tullius should not have strayed so far abroad in acquiring his slaves.
Pick him up.
Crixus!
You know the rules.
No one breaks the line!
Hold!
This is one of good Tullius' slaves?
It is.
I would make purchase.
Purchase?
What's the man's worth?
He is not for sale.
Fifty denarii.
What are you doing?
Seizing balls.
The man is barely worth ten.
Why would you pay such
a sum for a shit Gaul?
Shit?
Do you not see the promise in his eyes?
The spark smoldering
in his breast?
I would give it tender,
to ignite in the arena!
Fifty?
Add another five to weight your own purse.
Lend me twenty denarii.
You pay too much for the man.
The man is nothing.
I pay to gain favor
with Tullius.
A waste of coin.
The shit fuck will
never be a gladiator.
Even the lowest man
can rise beyond the heavens, if tempted with the proper reward...
Urgh!
He was well satisfied?
Very well.
Dominus will be pleased.
Not as much as I am.
When are you not so?
Especially with yourself?
It is a curse.
Being blessed with so much to offer.
And so few interested in sharing it.
See yourselves well scrubbed.
I would not have you smell of goat.
Goat?
A dead one.
The smell of victory, brother.
Well earned.
The men all speak of your triumph.
As they will of yours, when you return to the arena.
The crowd will cum in great geysers, drenching the gods gathered to witness
Oenomaus once more upon the sands!
I would have words with my wife.
Absent your cock, which has escaped you.
It will be missed.
Has Dominus spoken of my return?
I have not heard it.
More than a year has passed since I faced Theokoles.
Perhaps Dominus does not intend...
You were the only one to ever stand against the Shadow of Death and live.
Batiatus would be a fool to keep you from the arena.
Or I am the fool, for ever dreaming of such a thing.
You are many things.
Foolish is not among them.
Batiatus waits but for the perfect day for his champion to retake glory.
Is it true?
That his thing is large as a horse's?
Diona!
Are you not curious?
Is Gannicus' really that big?
Where is Domina?
In the triclinium with her guest.
Diona, see the girls bathed.
Yes, Melitta.
It is exciting, speaking of such things, is it not?
I was of a similar age, not so long ago.
I know the giddy enticement of the subject.
Yet you and Diona
should turn thought from it.
Soon enough your flowers will be plucked.
Hastening the moment will only result in bruising of the petals.
Yes, Melitta.
And in regards to Gannicus...
I've seen bigger.
Oh, you don't seem overly distraught at his passing.
How would you present, after years enduring withered flesh groping at you.
But when you left Capua
I thought you madly in love.
I was...with his purse.
Sadly his fortunes went dry towards the end.
And did you aid in their evaporation?
What can I say?
I am the glorious sun.
Returned to bless loving rays upon favored friend...
Gaia...
I have far too many baubles brought from Rome.
Along with other pleasures to be shared...
It suits you.
It would dazzle Venus herself.
I fear I have nothing so exquisite to give in return.
Your company is all I ever desire.
And...?
And, I would not refuse the comforts of a well appointed villa, until I manage other arrangements...?
Involving a ripe purse?
So many years have passed, yet nothing has changed.
Everything has changed, and for the better, by the judging of it.
When last we parted, this house was but a tomb, haunted by the living specter of your husband's father.
And you,
forced to smile and cater, bringing him his honeyed wine every evening.
I thought the crusty old bastard would never succumb to the afterlife.
He is not yet so far removed.
Merely retired to Sicilia for his health.
So he yet controls the ludus?
No.
My husband does.
As his proxy.
Was Gannicus
well attended then?
He was, Domina.
Gannicus?
That Celt with the ridiculously charming smile?
He has risen to prominence
within the ludus ever since Oenomaus was injured against Theokoles.
In an amazing display of bravery.
Gannicus.
Oenomaus.
All the hard, rippling men right beneath our feet.
One moistens at the thought.
Gaia!
They are but slaves!
Please.
In all the years you've called this ludus home, you've never once considered fucking one of them?
The very thought of that turns stomach.
I would never lay with any man besides my husband.
Let alone a filthy gladiator.
Fucking Gaul.
Another sacrifice to the gods of the arena.
Ze'irta kema atteta mezayyna, hada.
Ah, Dagan thinks you of a form, giving odds in your favor.
Odds?
Do you know where you are, friend?
The House of Batiatus.
Trainer of gladiators.
Yes.
You stand among his latest recruits.
Bound by pain and blood, together we toil beneath the cruel sting of Doctore's whip.
There were eight of us, when training began.
Now we're but three.
Four.
And how are we so blessed by a swelling number?
Hm?
By what means do you find yourself among such storied company?
My own.
You willingly present ass for fucking?
No, no, young Indus.
Do you not see it in his eyes?
This is a man with dreams
of blood and glory.
I doubt he'll live to see the test.
Test?
Our last trial.
We must all face one of the seasoned men, and demonstrate to the Dominus what we have learned.
Live, and receive the Mark of the Brotherhood, proving yourself worthy of the arena.
I will stand upon its sands.
Gammadta mezayyna.
Be-qushya matya maysaeri.
Hm, he longs to call you brother,
and join you as gladiator.
Tell him the feeling is well shared.
Oh, Jupiter's cock!
Fifty denarii, for a fucking stone hauler.
Coin well spent.
Was it?
Word surly has reached Tullius' ear, yet none of gratitude return.
Fifty denarii!
Solonius was right.
I should temper patience, as my father would.
You're not your father.
Nor would I have it so.
Perhaps tomorrow you will find yourself in the market.
Where you have often mentioned Tullius frequents upon a certain hour, overseeing his concerns.
A chance encounter, to gauge reaction?
Certain to be favorable.
As I know your reply to my request will be.
Give it voice, and see it considered.
I would have Gaia remain with us.
Just for a few days, until she can manage other arrangements.
The request does not surprise.
Is that a yes?
Ask for the moon, and I would wrest it from the heavens.
Gaia will be so pleased at your answer.
Let her keep company with her wine a moment longer...
Has a wife ever had such a husband?
He but honors her... and the gods for guiding her to his arms...
Crixus, you lower shield when you thrust.
See it raised, or your fucking brains on the sand.
Yes, Doctore.
A lucky blow.
A blow well struck.
I will not make the same mistake.
Good!
Again!
Doctore!
I would work the palus.
In the shade.
I would not let gaze linger.
Gannicus is a fucking fool, yet one of deadly skill.
He is often rewarded for his victories with wine and cunt.
Gain Dominus' favor, and such delights could be yours.
Drink and women are not my concern.
Ah, more for me then.
Fucking recruits.
Smaller and smaller
each year.
Apologies.
Oenomaus.
You return to form.
Pair with Crixus, and bring him to speed.
Dominus.
Gratitude.
For your instructions...
Lesson one: never drop your fucking guard.
Do you lay eyes?
No. Perhaps Tullius did not come today.
He always arrives, and seldom departs before noonday sun.
Are you his shadow now, adhered to each footstep?
I but study my subject, as any proper student would in pursuit of knowledge.
Tullius' man.
I seek your master, good Tullius.
Would he be within?
Oh...
I wish to express my gratitude for allowing me to purchase his slave Crixus.
The Gaul shows great promise towards the arena.
Perhaps you could pass word of my presence...
You owe me a few of those, if you recall.
A costly enterprise, for us both.
That one prays will turn profit.
Good Batiatus.
The gods answer...
In mocking tone.
I hoped for occasion
to give gratitude for relieving me of that troublesome Gaul.
Think nothing of it.
A gesture of respect, for a man deserving of it.
Received with all intentions.
Yet I fear you have overpaid.
A common mistake, for those with no head towards business.
Fifty denarii, minus the ten of the Gaul's actual worth.
Well uh...
I do not ask for its return.
Fair bargain was struck.
Fair?
A clumsy maneuver to gain position for your ill-trained men.
Vettius.
Ill-trained?
Any one of my men could best yours fucking blindfolded, you pissy little shit.
Listen how the rooster crows.
Let us calm ourselves...
You doubt my words?
Test them.
Request the match
in next month's games.
Why delay?
Let us see it here in the morning,
the people to judge
who holds the better man.
In the market?
Surely the Magistrate would not approve such disruption.
Good Tullius has his ear.
The Magistrate could be swayed to allow it... if that is what you wish?
It is.
And long past due.
Tomorrow then.
A friendly rivalry, well settled.
You press beyond advantage.
No.
I fucking press towards it.
You should have seen young Vettius, so easily goaded into making challenge!
The fucking child!
All men are reduced in years, when faced with superior mind.
Superior in all accounting!
A fact Tullius and the rest of the city will bear witness to in the marketplace!
Sleep will come with difficulty tonight.
It's been ages since I've seen a decent match.
Or Tullius.
In the blush of youth, he was forever attempting to slip beneath my robes.
Ha.
You should have fucking let him.
Tullius has grown to be a man of worth.
One to be emulated and admired.
And who will you choose to impress him?
Vettius' foolishness
presents rare opportunity.
The question begs careful consideration...
I have news to lift the heart.
Vettius has made challenge.
The coward finds his cock.
And I would see it shriveled.
My bestman is to meet his dog in the marketplace come morning.
The market?
Ah, detail of no consequence.
My question to you is plain.
Is our man prepared for such a vital match?
Yes, Dominus.
I long to honor this house once again.
No, I fear you have mistaken intentions.
I speak of Gannicus.
Gannicus.
The question would be better put to Doctore.
Leave.
His counsel is always valued, yet he is my father's man.
His judgment clouded through a haze of outdated traditions.
I seek a more visceral assessment.
You and I practically grew up together in this ludus.
You have witnessed the rise and fall of a dozen champions.
What now does your gut tell you of Gannicus?
Is he worthy of the mantle?
I believe it so.
He must truly be, for you to offer support despite your own desires.
I would not give false tongue to gain advantage.
There are few that would stand with you so.
Your wife's weekly visit.
Two nights hence?
Yes Dominus.
I would see her to your bed tonight as well.
In gratitude for honest thoughts.
Dominus.
Do the gods ever
answer your prayers?
They often reveal their leanings, though not in words.
Much like my husband.
Dominus summoned me.
To ask of Gannicus.
Gannicus?
He has chosen him as champion, he is to face Vettius' man in the marketplace tomorrow.
And this is why you sulk?
The streets are no place for the mighty Oenomaus to make his return.
The arena will be home to your triumphs, when the time comes.
And I will be there to witness it...
I will dream of your touch.
As I dream of yours every night.
♪ Blood rains down
from an angry sky. ♪
♪ My cock rages on,
my cock rages on...♪
♪ The blood rains down, from an angry sky, ♪
♪ my cock rages on, my cock rages on...♪
Gannicus!
Brother!
Brother come, drink, join me!
Lower voice!
If the Guards were to hear you...
The guards have already passed.
And were well plied with wine to keep nose from fucking business.
Tomorrow you fight for the honor of this ludus.
Now is not the time for drink.
Every night is time for drink.
For the morning sun may greet you with your last fucking day.
Fall to your bed.
Or risk steeper plummet against Vettius' man.
Words of wisdom, well received, well, well, received.
Oenomaus?
It should be you tomorrow.
Where is good Vettius?
Is he among you?
Or did he come to sense, and remain within the warm safety of his bed?
Ah!
There he stands!
Fresh and young as a newborn calf!
The fool at last shows himself.
Batiatus.
We had begun to fret on your arrival.
Although I see you arrive with unexpected gift...
It has been too long, Gaia.
And grows longer still.
Apologies for my delay.
I had much difficulty in the choosing of a man.
An imposing task, when each among my stable stands a titan!
Perhaps good Vettius should have taken more time with the choosing of his own.
Words fall from your mouth, as shit from ass.
Let us not become mired in base exchange.
We are gathered this glorious day to witness honorable contest between respected rivals.
Clear space!
The years have favored Tullius.
And his purse.
A brawl in the streets.
Where is the honor in such a thing?
Fuck honor.
This is business.
Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus
The event turns larger than expected.
for allowing
such thrilling event
Your mad schemes may yet bear fruit.
Enough for both of us to feast upon.
In the streets
of the great city of Capua!
Batiatus.
Present your man.
In honor of the Magistrate, esteemed Tullius,
and the good people of Capua...
I give you the fearless Gaul ever to take up arms in the arena!
Slayer of beasts!
Conqueror of giants!
Behold Gannicus!
Champion
of the House of Batiatus!
A fine choice.
Vettius.
Present your man.
I have no tongue for overripe embellishment.
Nor is it required.
Otho! Stand forth!
Grrrr!
Your day finally comes.
And yours ends.
Gratitude to Batiatus and Vettius.
Now, let us judge who stands the better house!
Apologies, Magistrate.
There appears to be something missing.
Where is your man's blindfold?
Blindfold?
What the fuck...
That was your boast, was it not?
That your gladiator could best any of my men absent sight...?
You did voice such challenge.
A simple figure of speech, not meant to be...
Good Tullius...
If Batiatus does not wish to honor terms, he should remove himself.
With tail between legs.
Doctore.
Come...the task should not be that difficult.
I need only direct my blades towards the smell of shit.
Gannicus. Ever the fool.
You are going to allow this, Quintus?
The choice has been removed from my hands.
Begin!
Yes!
How thrilling.
I have never seen such a thing.
For good reason.
A noble attempt.
To be remembered only in its failing.
Get up!
Yes!
Fucking kill him!
Yes!
Have you ever fucking seen the like?
Perhaps good Vettius should
pit a man less prone to death against the mighty Gannicus!
An impressive display,
Batiatus.
One not soon forgotten.
Gannicus is truly a wonder.
One deserving more prominent position in the games.
You gaze upon my very thoughts.
Commitments beckon.
Join me at Nestor's shop after the market closes, and we shall discuss your man at length.
Only mad Gannicus could win contest fucking blindfolded!
Barca could do the same!
And I would kill you for being a fool.
Auctus speaks truth.
Facing Vettius' man absent sight was beyond foolish.
The gods must have taken pity on your addled brain.
The gods had naught to do with it.
Otho he grunts like a stuck pig before each attack.
His squeals they gave way position!
Your victory lifts the heart.
You will not be rid of Gannicus so easily brother.
Dominus he rewards me with all the wine that I can drink and I would share it with my brothers!
Those that bear the mark.
One day.
Gannicus' victory forges path to greater glory.
With Tullius' support, we can finally gain proper position in games!
Maybe a place in the opening ceremony of the new arena.
After such a magnificent showing,
I have no doubt Gannicus will be offered a place in the primus.
Primus...
Yeah, I favor the fucking sound of that.
Expect late return.
I would seek out
Solonius afterwards, to discuss extending advantage to his house as well.
Send Tullius my regards.
And gauge his response in remembering me.
How could he fucking forget you.
It staggers mind, the change in him.
Change?
You know my meaning.
He always seemed so... demure and cowed.
Now he positively burns.
He has always done so.
His light was merely muted by the shadow of his father.
The man could turn day to night with disapproving frown.
He never cared much for me.
Or, I suspect, anything that smacked of enjoyment...
And what might this be?
More gifts from Rome.
The finest opium, carried from Cyprus.
I have not partaken in many years.
My husband...
Will be gone most of the night...
Good Batiatus.
Word of Gannicus' victory
has spread throughout the city.
His name- and yours- fall from every mouth.
May they always find the taste pleasing.
Everyone clamors to see your man again.
With exception of poor Vettius.
He is fit for seizure from the ordeal.
Unfortunate.
That he could not provide more worthy opponent.
Yet his stock is well known to be of inferior quality, as is the boy himself.
The manner in which he tends the ludus.
The child has no fucking talent for it.
You surprise me, Batiatus.
Your disposition towards business is much more... aggressive than your father's.
We are of diverging temperament.
And desires.
How does he fare in Sicilia?
The clime is more agreeable to various conditions brought about by the passing of the years.
How did the Magistrate take to Gannicus' display?
Ignited by it, as was the crowd.
He even broached subject of retaining the man.
For the opening games of the new arena.
Gannicus in the opening games?
If you could aid in such a thing,
I would forever be in your debt.
It merely requires a word in the proper ear.
All that remains is to agree upon a price.
Ah, of course I would be happy to see coin to your hand in exchange for assistance.
What, err, sum did you have in mind?
You misunderstand, Batiatus.
I do not offer a broker arrangement.
I offer to purchase your man.
Purchase?
But why would you want a gladiator?
You're not a lanista.
Jupiter's cock, no.
Yet I have many vested interests.
In shipping.
Goods and services.
This very shop.
And young Vettius' ludus.
Look at the little fuck now.
About to shit himself.
Still your tongue.
The grownups are talking.
Two hundred denarii.
A generous offer.
In respect of your father.
Apologies.
I would not part with the man.
I allowed you to purchase one of my slaves.
Yet now you deny me the same opportunity?
Gannicus is not for sale.
Everything is for sale,
Batiatus.
The question is but price.
I make fair offer.
And you produce cock to piss on me.
Do you know what that feels like, Batiatus?
Reconsider your answer.
Or be excluded from the games forever.

- What do you want?
- Why is this door locked, Andrew?
I'm getting ready for school.
Open this door, Andrew.
Listen to me.
No, you're drunk.
I'm what?
Excuse me?
I said unlock the door.
Andrew?
Dad, it is 7:30 in the a.m., and you are drunk.
Listen. You don't tell me if I'm drunk or not, you little shit. Aren't you?
What are you doing in there, huh?
I'm filming this.
Huh?
What? I bought a camera, and I'm filming everything from here on out.
And it is yours right now for only 46.50! Yeah!
Mom? Mom.
Hey.
Say hello to my new camera for me.
Who's the audience? Just the millions of people that are watching at home.
Do I look awful?
No, no, no, Mom.
You look...
You look great.
It's a nice camera.
Well, thanks, Mom.
So, um, should I ask about the camera or...
Uh, I don't know.
I'm... I'm filming things now.
I'm filming everything.
You're filming everything?
Yeah.
Okay.
God, make it stop.
Have you ever read any Arthur Schopenhauer?
No. What is Arthur Schopenhauer?
He's, um... He's this philosopher that I'm reading at the moment.
For school?
No, no.
Uh, basically, human beings have to recognize themselves... as beings of pure will, right?
Okay.
So all emotional and physical desires can never be fulfilled.
So basically you're telling me that I should give up on life.
Yes. Okay.
- Come on, man!
- Oh, God.
- I'll see you later.
- All right, dude. Peace.
Learning time.
Get out of the way.
Are you not coming in?
I'm gonna hang back a while, okay?
Uh, you're gonna be late for first period.
This is my school.
I guess.
Okay.
Hey, you! Hey, guy.
Vote for Steve for senior class president.
Vote for Steve.
Yeah, I got it.
This is where I eat lunch.
Out here on the bleachers.
...Four, five, six, seven, eight.
And one...
'Cause I don't wanna see anybody pull up. That's right.
Way to your left. There you go, Jack.
That's right. Okay.
A cohesive unit today.
...O-R-Y! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!
I don't want to see any crap out there. All right?
...T-O-R-Y!
Whoo! Good job.
All right.
Hi.
Hey.
Could you not videotape us, please?
It's really creepy.
Uh, no. I wasn't.
Hi! This is the hallway where my locker is.
What is this?
What's up, Detmer?
Wow, you should be on television.
Man, you're on a film, man.
Pretty on camera.
Smile, man. You look pretty.
You gonna cry? You gonna cry?
Sean, come on.
Give it back.
Huh? You want your camera?
Piece of shit from, like, 2004?
Here you go. Here she is.
In one piece.
- Oh! Oh, guys.
Almost.
Assholes! Come on!
All right.
You ready to bounce? Yeah.
There's a party tonight.
Okay.
Haven Hills.
Wait.
I thought Haven Hills was closed.
It's abandoned, yeah.
What, you don't want to go?
No.
When was the last time you went to a party?
I don't go to parties.
You're a senior. You are a senior.
I don't go to parties.
Just come.
I'll think about it, okay?
Okay.
But when we go tonight, Andrew, can I give you, like, a pro tip?
What?
Maybe leave your camera at home.
Why?
Because it's a little weird.
It serves a purpose.
I'm... I'm just trying to be a good cousin here, okay?
This is me being your friend and telling you... you should probably not take the camera to a party.
Okay.
This is my street.
And those are the official douche bags of my street.
What the hell's that?
Oh, great.
Hey! What you doing?
Andrew!
No, I wasn't... Don't film me, Detmer!
Don't film me.
Run to your house, bitch!
This is where I eat lunch.
Out here on the bleachers.
What do you want?
When I say open that door, you open the door. You got it?
Finish your goddamn homework.
Matt, are you sure it's here?
Dude, it's here. Calm down, okay?
Oh, yeah.
Wow. Look. A rave.
Oh, wow. Look.
A nerd with a camera.
What? Just don't follow me around all night, okay?
What do you mean? I thought... I thought you wanted me to come with you.
I did. I did. But just go and do your own thing for once, okay?
I don't drink.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Hey! Hey, what are you filming for?
Oh, I don't... Um...
Oh!
What?
- I can't hear you.
- I'm just filming.
- Oh. Oh, cool. Cool. I'm filming for my blog.
- Oh.
Andrew. Andrew. You should check it out.
It's actually...
Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.
Hey.
How you doing?
I'm good. I'm good.
This is pretty lame, right?
Why is it lame?
You know, Jung said parties are just... people's way of seeking widespread validation.
I'm not one to clamor to be cool, you know.
Wow. Way to put an analytical psychology spin on this barn party, Matt.
That's awesome.
Awesome.
- You're awesome.
- Hey, Matt.
Hey, what did Jung say about glow sticks?
You filming my girlfriend?
Yes or no?
No, I... I'm not filming anything.
I'm just filming the party. Okay.
I should break your bitch-ass nose.
You know that?
No, I wasn't...
Don't talk back to me.
Bitch.
Okay.
Andrew?
Andrew.
Andrew.
With the camera.
Can we... Can we use that thing?
What?
We found the craziest shit, and we gotta get it on tape.
Uh, it's not...
What's up, man?
You okay?
Yeah. I'm... I'm Andrew.
Okay. I'm Steve.
Steve Montgomery.
Yeah, I know.
Really?
Matt and I were just hanging out, and we found this cool little... this thing.
Wait. You're with Matt?
You might want to get it on tape.
No, I just... I don't really.
Dude, just come on.
Just come get it on tape. It'll be cool.
I don't know.
Trust me.
All right.
Yeah, man.
You know there are, like, tons of girls around here, right?
And you're all by yourself next to a tree?
I'm just really picky.
Listen. I really don't think... Is there a light on that thing? Like, on the camera?
Uh, yeah. Here.
What were you guys doing out here?
A bunch of people were out here 'cause we were, like, obsessed with the thing.
What thing?
You'll see.
Oh, that's... that's right!
Andrew Detmer!
I remember you from homeroom, freshman year.
You always had that gray zip-up hoodie.
Garetty!
You remember that?
Yeah, I got a... I got a thing for faces, which is why I'm going into politics.
Ironically enough,
'cause I'm so ridiculously hi...
Down here!
Ah, there we go.
Garetty, what's up?
I see you! Matt!
You see me?
Yeah, where did everybody go?
They left! They left! Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Do you see that?
Guys, what is that?
Do you see it? Is that the camera?
Yeah, I got him!
Do you guys know how to get back from here?
Is it still making that sound?
Yes. Did you tell Andrew?
Andrew, it's making that sound, dude.
Dude, come and listen to this.
Listen to this.
No, no, no, no.
You gotta get in. Okay, okay.
You gotta get close, like literally almost in the hole.
Okay, don't push me. Just don't push me.
Check this shit out. We're not gonna push you in.
We're just trying to get it on camera.
Listen. Can you hear that?
Shh, shh.
What...
I think we got it.
Wait. How creepy is that?
Is this sound coming up? I don't know.
I mean, probably. It's pretty loud, right?
Hello! All right, dude.
We're going inside.
I'm going back. Come on, you guys.
I gotta know.
Matt, seriously, we... Hey, wait, wait. Steve!
Steve!
Oh, shit! He's a ninja.
Matt!
Whoa, Matt, Matt, Matt.
What are you doing?
Are you serious?
Andrew, can you give me some light?
Matt, don't be an idiot.
Whoop! Whoop!
Matt!
Matt, you're my ride home!
Oh!
Smells terrible.
You guys!
Matt!
Hello?
Andrew's such a pussy. All right.
Does it go down much deeper, or what?
- Yeah, man. It goes really, really far.
- Andrew, bring the light.
Look at the walls.
It's like a straight shot down.
Probably already come like 40 or 50 feet.
Yeah, just don't talk about it, okay?
You ever... You ever heard of
Plato's “Allegory of the Cave”?
I don't know, Matt.
Let's just get this over with.
Oh, Shit!
Holy shit.
The hell is that?
Matt, I'm not kidding.
I can't breathe.
Come on.
Andrew, look at this.
What...
Can you believe this?
Matt.
What am I looking at?
Ah, shit! I am freaking out right now!
Matt!
Can we get out of here, please?
Is it showing up on the camera like that?
I don't know, man.
It's messing with it. I don't really want to film...
Dude, I'll buy you a new one.
Touch one.
Matt!
Matt, look at this!
What?
Look at this!
Dude, what is...
Dude, no way!
It's changing colors!
Oh, my God.
Must be reacting to heat.
I can't hear you over that...
- This is awesome.
Oh! Dude, your nose!
Steve, Steve!
Steve!
- Steve!
Matt, dude, put your phone down.
Turn it off.
Okay, okay, okay.
Steve, you too.
All right.
We have to document this.
- Okay. Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. I'm ready.
All right. Here we go.
Okay, Steve... What?
Can you move to your left?
Here?
Um, yeah. That's good.
And then, Matt, can you just go right in front of Steve?
Um...
Here? Yeah, perfect.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
This is the ball test.
You ready?
Yep.
Oh!
What the shit, Steve?
Get off! Get off!
What are you doing? Underhand.
I tried, man. I tried.
Let's do it. Let's do it.
All right.
All right. Wait, wait.
We good?
We said underhand, right?
Yeah, it is underhand. Yeah.
Okay.
Underneath. I'm on you.
You're not gonna get me this time.
You ready? Yeah.
I'm on it. Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's go.
Oh!
Yeah!
The crowd goes wild!
Yeah, I'm ready. All right.
Matt, beam him. Beam him.
I'm... I'm going to.
Beam him.
Oh!
Oh!
No way! Shit!
Wait, wait, wait.
That's great!
He did it!
I did it! I did it!
That is crazy!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
Oh, my God!
Holy shit! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, dude, you're bleeding.
You're bleeding.
Oh, man, shit.
Stop, stop, stop. Get a tissue.
You did it! Yes!
Oh. All right. Pop-up.
Ready? Yeah.
Yes!
Put on the music.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Matt, you have... you have to pretend like you're squeezing them together with your hands.
That's what I'm doing.
Look. That's what I'm doing.
- I can't do it, dude.
- I give up.
You do it.
You're better at this than I am.
Oh, really? Am I?
Really?
Just do it.
Oh.
Sick.
Dude, I hate you!
That's...
I'm impressed, man.
I am impressed. That's amazing.
That was awesome, dude.
Oh, no!
Come on, dude.
That is not cool.
What?
That is not cool.
My Legos.
You've been hanging out with those two guys for the last three weeks.
“Three weeks.”
I'm not stupid.
I think you're hiding something from me.
You better call me back.
Wow. I love you.
I'm gonna get a brick through my window.
I am legitimately scared.
I have an election coming up, and I don't have time for this.
Dude, why are you asking us for advice on girls?
Because we're his mistress.
So, what, you think it's, like, radiation or something?
- Radiation from what?
- Dude, it's the government.
What?
Matt, what are you talking about?
I'm feeling pretty spelunked out actually.
Andrew, relax.
That's so weird. It looks completely different during the day.
Look. I don't care, okay?
I am not going in the hole again.
Asshole.
It's like sunk in or something.
There goes your old camera, dude. Oh, shit.
That's weird.
I can still feel it down there.
I can't believe we made it out of there.
Well, I mean, that answers that, right?
Um, what does?
We still don't know what happened.
No Well, we're still alive.
I mean, I was definitely Hey!
You kids can't be here, okay?
You gotta move on out. What?
The ground's unstable.
We're taping the whole place off.
Okay. We're going.
Vote for Steve!
New camera's working out for you.
That's good. Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?
Yeah, smaller.
Does that shoot on tape?
No, it just... It, like, records right onto the camera.
No, I just want to record all the stuff that we can do, you know.
Yeah, but it's like all the time.
You don't feel like it's a little weird, like it puts a barrier between you and everything else?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe I want a barrier.
So, like, what's up with your dad?
What's his story? What does he do?
Um, my dad's a firefighter.
Okay. That's cool. Oh, man, that must have been awesome...
Yeah, well, he was, I guess.
What happened? Uh, I don't know.
He didn't die or anything.
He just... He got injured on the job, and now he, um... he collects the insurance, you know.
Um, so he doesn't really do anything.
He just... He, um... He'll go out during the day, but I don't know where he goes.
Uh, he drinks a lot.
I know that much.
I've actually been having some problems with my parents too.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I mean, they're nothing like yours.
I mean, not like that...
I just... Never mind.
They just been fighting a lot lately.
And I think my mom is actually cheating on my dad.
Can you not say anything about that?
Yeah. No way. Thanks.
Yes. Karen Detmer.
D-E-T-M-E-R.
Yes. Thank you.
She's in pain.
She needs something stronger.
Her breathing's worse.
Sir, she's suffering.
Please help me.
I'm on disability.
I can't afford $700.
Please, don't put me on hold! She can't breathe, okay?
I don't know what to do any more.
Is it on?
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.
I want to remember you like this.
Oh, Mom.
You're stronger than this.
Can you say that for me?
Please?
I'm stronger than this.
Oh, nice.
All right. Here. Watch this.
Weak.
Hey, Matt.
Yeah?
Do you like me?
Um, yeah, of course.
I mean, you know, I didn't...
I mean, you know, I didn't always.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Like, you haven't...
You haven't always been super easy to talk to, you know.
I mean, I'm not saying that you're not now. I'm just...
You're such an asshole.
That's what I'm talking about, dude.
You're hostile, see?
Better.
Hey, Matt.
Yeah?
Do you ever think about, like, doing more with it?
What, with this?
Not really.
Why? What else is there?
“Telekinesis.”
Yes. Do tell.
“The ability to move, lift, vibrate”.
That's my favorite.
“Spin, bend, break or impact objects... through the direct influence of mental power or other nonphysical means.”.
Okay.
Sounds familiar.
It does sound familiar.
Very familiar.
You want to see direct influence?
She's wearing black today.
Hi.
That's direct influence.
...week, in my room.
Just listen.
I'm just that much stronger. Even last night I got my whole bed off the ground.
No nosebleed. Yeah?
I've been lifting weights too.
This is my theory though is that it's like a muscle.
Like, it's elastic. If you stretch it too far, too quick, it'll tear.
Ew.
That's why I think we're getting stronger, you know, because we're working it out, getting buff.
Buff.
How about this for a workout?
Holy shit!
That was awesome.
Classy.
Mm-hmm.
Attractive.
I think it's time we took this out of the backyard.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Right here. This is perfect.
Really? This is it.
Matt. Yah!
Let's get this one.
Whoa! Hey! Hello!
Hey, what Andrew.
Help! Somebody grab that!
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!
- Okay, I'll get the top.
- I'll get the top. Got it. Got it.
- Let's get the legs.
- Okay. Wait.
I'm flying!
She's just looking at it.
What you looking at, girl?
Stay in school!
Okay, see the guy chewing the gum?
I'm gonna get the gum and pull it right out of his mouth.
Okay, I got him.
Oh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are we running?
We don't need to run.
Five... I don't want to do it.
Four...
Dude, I don't want to do it.
You're creating a scene. I don't want to do it.
Come on, Matt. Don't be a bitch about it.
Just do it.
Put your hand on the table.
Okay. Are you ready? Do it.
Give me a countdown.
I will. I promi...
Owh!
Oh, snap!
Like I said You gotta pay for that now.
Like I said. See?
Holy crap.
Man! Just pretend that there's a barrier over your hand, right? And then...
Mm-hmm. When things are gonna hit you, as long as you're ready,
- they will not hurt you because of the barrier.
- That's so sick.
That's me right there. I need that.
Steve, Steve, you have to try this, dude.
Give me your hand.
When I was a kid though, I actually... I actually did want to be a police officer.
A cop?
No shit? Yeah. Yeah.
You do know that you can't smoke weed when you're a cop, right, Matt?
Oh, no. Really?
Uh, I didn't know.
Uh, but, no, I... I... I just...
I really got into, like, altruism.
What does that mean?
What does “altruism” mean, Matt?
It's like wanting to make things better for everyone.
Really? This coming from the man who is always talking about how pointless life is.
Yeah, I know, but this is what
I've been thinking about lately.
Like, I'm looking back, and I just think... the way I used to think about things was probably a lot better, you know.
So, what, you want to go out and start a charity or something?
That's lame.
Wait. Why is that lame?
Uh, I don't know.
Douche bag.
I'm not good at everything.
I just do my best at everything.
All right?
That's what it's about.
I mean, you talk about philosophy and shit all the time, but what has he really done, hmm?
Have you even applied to colleges yet?
No, but I'm getting...
I'm getting to it.
Yeah, well, you should get to it.
I'm just saying. I am.
You could use some of that.
You could use some “Shut the hell up.”
How about that?
You just lack initiative. It's not that big... Oh, yeah? You lack a dick.
Boys, please tell us what's going on here.
Uh, well, it would seem that a
Virgin Mary has appeared... in the syrup of a local man's pancake.
No, it has not.
Uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
Just hold on.
Oh, that is definitely some supernatural shit going on here.
Um, excuse me.
Can you come here real quick?
Um, can you just look at that?
Ay, Dios mio!
Grounder.
Too much pressure.
Andrew.
Oh, dude. Come on.
Leave her alone.
Oh, seriously?
Dude!
Oh, come on.
That is so messed up.
She's gonna get fired.
I didn't know...
That is disgusting.
But do you guys share cups on the team?
No, we don't share cups, man.
You see that car though?
The red one.
Yeah.
All right.
The gum was cool.
All right. You tried.
It was a failed attempt though.
Watch this.
What are you doing?
Watch.
Go, go, go.
What?
No way!
Holy shit!
Dude! Holy crap!
What? What?
That's what I'm talking about!
Did anybody see?
Steve Montgomery for president!
- I'm having, like, a face period.
- Oh, man.
Pause.
You guys.
You guys, here she comes.
Here she comes!
Oh...
Don't look.
Don't look, don't look.
Steve, don't look.
She can't find...
She thinks it's stolen.
She has no idea. Yes, it was the black guy this time.
“I could have sworn
I parked it right here. Where is my car?"
Ignore us.
We're just...
Mormons.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Garetty's...
Garetty's having a giggle fit.
That was so... It was amazing.
I know. Just take it easy with the merchandise.
How did nobody see that?
It was out in the open.
Her face!
I cannot get her face out of my mind!
That was awesome.
Who is this?
So many ideas of stuff that we can do!
Go around.
That's just some redneck asshole.
Go around. Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.
Take the camera. Take the camera.
All right. Just make sure it's zoomed out all the way.
- Got ya. I can see you.
- Okay, buddy.
What you gonna do?
What the hell is this guy's problem?
What are you doing?
Abracadabra!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Andrew, shit!
What the hell did you just do?
Matt, stop the car! Stop! Stop!
Are you crazy? Pull down the road.
We gotta go down there right now.
Guys, I'm sorry!
What did you do?
Why did you do that?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't...
Shit! What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at this!
Will you just calm down!
The guy's probably still in there!
I'm sorry, okay?
Andrew, stop, stop!
But I can... I can help!
I can get him out.
Stop doing things!
Steve! Steve!
Steve, be careful!
Shit! Shit!
Oh, my God, Andrew.
Are you kidding me?
Steve!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Goddamn it!
Steve!
Andrew! Oh...
Shit!
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!
Oh, Matt, he's got him!
He's got him. He's got...
Help me.
I'll get in back of him.
Get him up.
Hang on. Steve, stay with him.
I'm gonna go get some help.
Are you calling the cops?
Yeah, yeah.
Will you stop? I can't hear them.
Will you hang up the phone?
Yeah. It's just down past, uh, White
Crescent Bridge. Matt, he's fine.
Matt, he's fine.
Yeah. Yeah.
Fine, Matt! Stop!
Stop! I can't hear...
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Over here!
...Peeled off the road and went straight through the guardrail. Hey, is that on?
...This is a game or something? I don't understand how you guys can be so angry.
You don't understand how we can be angry?
Andrew, you... you put somebody in the hospital tonight, okay?
Do you understand that?
Andrew, look at me.
You put a guy in the hospital!
How do you feel about that?
You hurt somebody!
Shit.
We need rules, okay?
No using it on living things.
You can't use it when you're angry. That's it.
I don't think we should be using it in public or telling anybody about it.
Look, you can't just declare rules, okay?
I will declare rules...
You're the one that said that nothing matters.
I will declare rules.
If we're gonna keep going, and we're getting stronger, we need rules.
We need rules, right?
Matt's right. We need rules.
Andrew! Answer the goddamn phone!
Andrew!
Matt, what did he say?
Are you still mad at me?
No, I'm not mad.
Well, you seem mad.
I'm not mad. I just...
I just think that we need to be more careful now, you know? We can't...
We have to think a little bit more. We can't just do things.
We have to think first, okay?
I understand.
Okay.
Why is Steve out in the boonies?
Where are we?
Steve?
His car's right there.
Yeah.
Steve, where you at?
Steve!
“Look up.”
Hello, boys.
What is up?
No. No.
Wait, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
Check me out. Hear me out.
- You're flying!
- Holy shit!
Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out.
Hear me out. No way! No way!
What are you doing?
It's much easier than it looks. I swear.
It's much easier than it looks.
Oh, my God, dude.
Make sure you catch yourself.
Don't try and jump, or you'll just flip yourself.
I got it. I got it.
Come on, Matt. Come on.
All right.
Oh, shit!
Oh, man!
Eating dirt, man.
Why don't you get behind me?
You were in my way.
What do you mean?
Think Harrier jet.
Think Harrier jet.
Oh, man.
Goddamn it!
Are you okay?
I'm watching.
Just let me concentrate.
Focus! Focus!
Okay! Hold on.
Is that your focus face?
Oh, my God, dude.
Whoo!
Bullshit!
I'm up! I'm up!
Are you kidding me?
Holy crap! Hold it!
Hold it!
Oh, my God, dude. I am doing it.
Holy crap, dude.
Yeah! That's it, man.
You're doing it.
Whoo-hoo!
Okay. Okay. Andrew, don't fart.
We'll never find you again.
Steve, stop me.
Stop me, stop me.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa.
You are flying now.
You guys look so cute together.
Whoa! I'm coming up.
I'm bringing the camera, okay?
All right.
All right.
How do we get down?
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Andrew!
It's freezing up here!
I can't hear you.
Activate hyperdrive!
Whoo!
Where the hell are we?
Catch up! Let's go!
What?
Whoo! This is insane!
Whoo-hoo!
Dude!
All right, Andrew!
Whoo!
Tag, you're it!
Watch out.
Pump the brakes!
Whoa! Aah!
Hey, Matt! You're finally good at something!
It's so easy! Yeah!
Aah! Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoa!
Got it!
Tebow time, baby!
Yeah!
Oh! Nice hands, Steve!
Touchdown!
Throw it back to Daddy!
Oh, dude. Nice catch, man! Yes!
Steve!
Go deep! Hey, Matt!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
Whoa! Steve!
Oh, shit. Almost died, dude.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Almost died, man! Almost...
Andrew, you saved my life!
Oh, my God.
You saved my life!
Oh, God, you saved my life!
Oh, my God!
Okay.
Holy shit.
Is that the camera?
You saved me and the camera?
Please tell me you got that on tape!
You have to...
Ah, shit.
What the hell We're alive!
What do you mean? The hell happened?
You didn't see what happened?
Oh, shit! Andrew!
Andrew! You're a genius!
We got to see this! Holy...
All right. Oh. Holy shit.
Wait. Oh, God!
We're on the ground. Yes!
Whoo!
We have broken history!
I mean, I'm talking about since the caveman times.
Uh, the Egyptians, the Wright brothers.
Come here, Matt. Come here.
Get in here. Get in.
Say it. “I can fly.”
I can fly.
I can fly!
Oh, come on.
Say it with your chest!
I can fly!
Say it, Matt.
Shout it out!
I can fly!
I can fly! I can fly!
I tried to save you, man.
Andrew was just quicker.
How does that go again?
We almost died.
Oh, please.
Gestures...
How does she not notice though?
Come on.
Let's be serious, guys.
She definitely noticed that it's gotten better.
You just gotta be, you know...
Yeah?
You just gotta be subtle.
That is so cool.
Dude. And I haven't had sex since summer.
I haven't had sex since ever.
Really?
Really?
That is completely unacceptable.
Well...
How are you guys so cool?
How are you guys so cool, man?
Liquid nitrogen.
Hey, guys?
Guys? You guys up?
Yeah.
Hey, uh...
Today was like...
It was like, I think, the best day of my life.
Like, I mean...
I'm thinking about it, and I can't think of any day... that I liked better than today, you know?
I really... I think it was.
Yeah.
Unanimous.
Yes.
Okay. Good.
Okay, check this out.
Say what you want, but I'm thinking about booking it to Maui for the weekend.
What's up with that?
Seriously?
Well, we could do it. I mean,
I was thinking the same thing, except I've always wanted to go to Tibet.
Why Tibet?
Tibet?
Yeah. I don't know.
It seems really beautiful, you know, with all the...
Will you shut up? Shut...
The monuments and mountains, you know?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know. And the monks have achieved such a high level of enlightenment... that they can, like, float and shit, you know?
So we would fit right in. We could really mess with their heads as well.
Yeah, but, like, seriously,
I think we should go.
It would be really cool.
Peaceful.
No, I think it's a really good idea.
I actually would like to go.
I'm down.
You down, Steve?
What...
I... I don't know, man.
There's no bikinis in Tibet.
So I don't know if I'm down with that.
It was brilliant. Ch, it was so amazing.
She might have lost her job.
Oh, shit, dude.
I got my mom's birthday. I gotta go.
It's Aunt Deb's birthday today?
Yeah. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Tell her I said hi.
Later, Matt.
All right, what do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go?
I don't know. I mean,
I don't want to go home.
Oh, do you want to go into the city?
Nah, it's rush hour, bro.
It's gonna be so much traffic. So what?
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Duh! Let's go.
Oh, hey. Sorry, I just...
Hi.
Do you mind if I film you?
Uh, a little bit. I don't really like being on camera actually.
Well, maybe it's, like, exposure therapy.
Yeah. No, I just came by to give you something actually.
You did?
Yeah.
What?
I was watching your, um... your... your... you know, your blog?
There's a drought in the Central African Republic, right?
Yeah. So I saw that and I thought it seems pretty cool, and it's cheap too, so I thought why not?
Totally.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can tell that you're really global and big picture, concerned about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
You know, Matt, you can just mail this yourself.
I'm not your mom.
Okay. I mean, I just...
What is this?
Is this, like, the new you?
You got too smart to have fun in eighth grade. So now what?
No.
Casey, Casey, Casey,
Casey, Casey, Casey.
Listen, listen. Can I just talk to you for a second?
Can I just tell you something?
Mm-hmm.
I just... I... I...
I just want you to know
I'm not, you know, who I was... now.
You know, I'm cool.
I'm just...
You're cool?
High school popularity just seemed like this weird backward contest, and I thought since
I knew that, I could just...
That made you better than everybody else.
No. No, no, no.
I know what you mean.
I would separate myself from that.
I get it.
You get it?
Mm-hmm.
I know it sounds weird.
I just wanted you to know that.
To know that you're cool.
Wow, I really screwed this up.
Not as much as you might think.
Really?
Good-bye.
Casey...
I gotta go. Bye.
Come on.
Dude!
When did you start doing this?
Like, since when?
What, with the camera?
Yes, with the camera.
Um...
I don't know. It's been a little while, I guess.
See... Oh.
I can't do that.
I can't do stuff that requires finesse.
I tried to type my name out yesterday, and I cracked my keyboard in half.
No, dude. It's really easy. You just...
You think that you're holding it.
See, that's what I'm talking about right there. What?
You're always thinking up new shit that we can do, man.
This is insane.
You know... I mean...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes. I guess that I am.
Whoo!
Mom's, like, never home any more.
I mean, you saw how my dad is. He's just... quiet.
Sits around.
And it's pointless to talk to him about it
'cause he's got... nothing to say.
See, it's different,
'cause you've always had friends, and people want to talk to you and be around you.
I never had any of that.
I mean, before this,
I barely even hung out with
Matt, and he's my cousin.
We were close when we were little, but...
I don't know.
In high school, everything changed.
Ever been to the Space Needle?
Yep. When I was, like, five.
It's for tourists.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I went, um...
I think I was, like, seven... with my dad one time and...
I don't know.
It was actually a really good day.
You remember that?
Yeah.
Actually, I do.
You know, I've been meaning to ask you.
Winter break is coming up.
You should do the talent show with me.
No way.
Why not? It'd be good for you to get out there, you know.
Meet some people, meet some girls.
Dude, I'm not... it's just not...
What? Look, I'm just really shy, okay?
And I don't...
I don't even have any talents, so...
What are you talking about, you don't have... You have talent.
You've got talent.
Oh, dude, no way.
You look handsome.
Thanks, yes. Steve... let me borrow some of his clothes to make me look cool or whatever.
I'm glad you're spending so much time with your friends.
Yeah. Yeah, me too.
Hey. What?
How are you getting to school?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't bullshit me, you idiot.
Matt doesn't come.
He doesn't drive up.
You leave the house.
Who the hell's giving you rides to school?
M... Matt.
All right. You know what?
You're lying.
You're up to something, and you can't hide it.
You think you can just slink, hmm?
Sneak in, sneak around my house, smiling?
I'm onto your shit.
How do you even work this stupid thing?
Ah! And we're in business.
Boo!
Hey. Hi.
Um, what are you doing here?
I'm filming for the talent show.
Matt Garetty is filming for the talent show. Yes, I am.
Wow.
What is this, some kind of newfound school spirit?
- How do you like it, huh?
- Being on camera?
- I actually don't mind being on camera.
- Oh. Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, now coming to the stage...
What? No philosophical comeback for me?
Steve Montgomery.
You're probably gonna want to get this on camera.
All my underclassmen, come on.
Make some noise. That's not loud enough.
How about my upperclassmen?
Come on. Make some noise!
Yeah, Steve!
Let me hear it from my seniors, class of 2012!
Yeah. Shh.
Now I want you guys to give it up for the young and very talented Mr. Andrew Detmer.
- And you're on.
- Come on, y'all.
- What are you guys doing?
- Let's go, let's go!
Are you playing a prank on your cousin?
That's mean, Matt.
Just watch.
Really?
- Good luck!
- What's he doing?
Show us some talent!
Nice, Matt.
Fifty-two Pickup!
Pick 'em up!
No way!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Go, Andrew!
What? What?
- Are they gonna walk on that?
- What do you think?
Whoa. He's got it.
He's got it. He's got it.
Easy.
Yeah, you got it.
Holy crap!
Yeah! Cakewalk!
Give it up, give it up, give it up!
Oh, my God. Andrew is so amazing.
Whoa!
Give it up! Let's go!
Seriously, how are they doing this?
I don't know.
Magic.
Whoo!
That was amazing!
Yeah!
Whoo! Whoo! Andrew!
Oh, my God. I can see your head is, like, exploding right now. What?
This is the beginning of your downfall.
Hubris. Right there.
What's hubris?
Ha, ha, ha.
No, what does “hubris” mean, Matt?
Seriously?
What does “seriously” mean?
What? I'm....
Get in there.
Don't push me, dude. I'm going.
Your fans await.
You're the man of the hour.
Look at this house!
Oh, sick!
Dude, this place looks huge.
I know.
It's enormous.
Dude.
Matt! Andrew!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Steve! Oh, my God!
Everybody's freaking out. Come on, man.
Everybody's been waiting for you.
V.I.P. coming through.
Coming through!
Andrew Copperfield coming through!
Make way, make way.
Matt, come this way.
Drew, over here.
Andrew Detmer's in the house!
How are you feeling?
I'm... I'm... I'm doing good.
- Yeah? Are you sure? Are you sure?
- Hey. Hey.
Hello.
Andrew.
Magic is so hot.
Oh, wow. Thanks.
So, do you not remember me at all?
Um...
Monica, right? Monica.
Yes!
...Setting the camera down.
I'm setting the camera down.
What...
Oh.
Oh. Excuse me.
Have you ever played that, over there?
Uh, no. I have never played that, over there.
No?
Never.
I bet you're good at it.
Uh...
What, you just throw the ball into the cups? Yep. Yep.
I actually could be good at that right now. Yeah?
Maybe.
Let's find out.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on!
What?
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
There you are.
Amazing.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Hey, where is Andrew anyway?
Oh.
Andrew's upstairs with the girl with the pink hair.
What, like, they went together?
That's my boy. Of course they went together.
What are you talking 'bout?
Hey, Andrew.
I hope you're seeing this.
Congratulations, sir.
I just wanted you to know, dude...
I was really worried about you before all this, you know?
But, dude, things are gonna get so much better for you now.
I really, really feel that.
And I want you to know
I love you, you know?
I love you, man.
It's you and me.
It's Detmer and Garetty, extended family for life.
Oh, sorry. Sorry. No, man.
Excuse yourself.
Oh, man.
When did I become the one who's out here filming myself? Hey, Matt.
Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.
So what are you filming?
Uh, it's just a thing.
It's not like eye of the storm or anything.
Hey, I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...
I've really been... it's been making me think a lot.
I've been kind of thinking about it in my...
No, I have. Like, in my life.
I've been thinking, if I applied myself, what I could do.
I could really...
I could change the world.
I mean, it's really been...
You're drunk.
What?
Hey, Casey?
I've basically been stalking you since, like, sophomore year.
Sorry, use of the word “stalking.”
I shouldn't have said...
You want to get out of here?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yes. Yes, definitely.
Uh, I... I have to drop off the camera first though.
Okay, you guys are getting ready to witness history, all right?
I'm like a proud dad right now because behind these doors,
Andrew Detmer becomes a man.
He's a little boy behind there.
He's scared.
He's like a butterfly, getting ready to emerge...
Oh, God!
From a cocoon or some shit like that.
Disgusting weirdo!
Wait. What happened?
Ha-ha. Okay...
Is that...
Out of my way now!
- Oh, man.
- Monica, what happened?
Drew! Drew! It's okay, man.
Don't worry about it.
Look, it happens to the best of us, okay? Dude!
You had a little too much to drink...
You... Oh. Oh.
Whoa, buddy.
The hell's going on, dude?
Why are you laughing?
Aw, man.
All over my jacket.
Stop. Stop laughing.
What are you talking about?
It's cool, man.
No, it's not cool, Steve. Stop.
Stop what? It's cool, man.
Will you just get out of here?
Get out! What's your problem?
Drew, Drew!
You think this is funny?
No, I'm not laughing...
Get out!
Dad!
Andrew! Please!
I need my medicine.
Mom's in pain, all right?
She needs her pills! Where are you?
Where are you?
Dad!
Hoarding a $500 camera while your mom dies in there?
I mean, how selfish can you be?
I went through your camera.
What did you see?
Just you being a loser.
You think that those people are your friends?
Huh? They're not.
You're an embarrassment.
You're running around this town, spending my money.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I didn't spend any of your money, Richard.
'Cause I don't have a dime to spend.
Every last cent...
Look at me!
Every last cent goes to school for you... School?
And medication for your mother.
I go to a public school!
I can't even pay for a goddamn... You don't pay for a public school, you idiot!
What did you call me?
Did you call me an idiot, you shit?
Did you call me an idiot? Huh?
You piece of shit!
Get up. I said get up!
Get up!
I could crush you, you know that?
Stop it!
Crush you! Get...
Smile, Matt.
Oh, my God, Matt. Oh.
Can we not do the camera thing right now, please?
What happened?
Uh... It just started out of nowhere.
Are you okay?
My head hurts really bad.
That's probably Steve calling your cell again.
I'll call him back later.
I think it's time to take...
Matt! Matt! Come on! Oh, wow.
I did not expect this.
Give me my...
Whoa!
Hey! Hey, asshole!
What are you doing up here?
Just leave me alone, Steve!
You can't be up here, dude.
This isn't safe.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
Bro! What are you doing up here?
Leave me alone!
How did you find me?
I don't know, man.
My nose was bleeding.
I heard your voice or something like...
What the hell happened to your face?
Nothing, man.
Just leave me alone.
No, dude, that's not nothing.
That... Your dad!
Your dad beat the shit out of you.
He can't do that to you now.
Will you stop acting like you give a shit?
Dude. Why are you talking to me like this?
I'm your best friend.
I don't have any friends!
You were never my friend before any of this.
I hang out with you and Matt, like, every day!
We're supposed to fly around the world together.
Don't you... Do you remember that?
You think I'm... Stop!
Just stop talking to me!
Why won't you just leave me alone?
Come on, man.
Steve, I'm telling you, get away from me!
Get away from me now!
Please!
...who, by the power of
God, are safeguarded in faith.
Even though you do not see him now, you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy... as you attain the goal of your faith... the salvation of your soul.
What are you doing?
You filming graves?
I don't get it.
What do you care?
You haven't been returning my calls.
Why aren't you returning my calls?
I've been busy.
No, you haven't.
Why aren't you returning my calls?
I just don't feel like talking.
Turn off the camera.
No.
Andrew.
Andrew, turn off the camera.
Andrew? How did he get struck by lightning... during a storm with no recorded lightning strikes?
How?
And they found Steve out in the middle of a field.
Why would Steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm, Andrew?
I don't know.
Why? What?
I don't know what happened, Matt!
I don't believe you, okay?
I don't believe you.
I want you to turn off the camera and talk to me. Why?
'Cause I want to have a conversation with you.
Don't tell me what to do, Matt.
You can't tell me what to do!
Don't ever tell...
Give me... Shut it off!
Get off of me!
Andrew...
Are you joking right now?
Is this a joke to you? I...
What did you do, Andrew?
What did you do?
Who am I supposed to tell about this?
Who do I talk to?
Who do I talk to about this?
Why won't you just tell me what happened, Andrew?
Please believe me, Steve.
Please, it's just I...
I don't know what I did. I...
I lost control, and... and I'm so sorry.
This thing is just becoming a part of me now, and I don't...
I miss you, Steve.
...all the drills. Good.
We're all pretty good, right?
Get ready. Go!
You guys?
Do not hesitate.
Did you hear who worked?
He was like.
Oh! Oh, Andrew!
Dry off!
Totally.
Hey, Wayne!
Okay, so, see this one here?
This one I got really clean
'cause I did this little, like, lasso thing around the root, you know?
But then these two... these, I did not get as good.
See how they're broken?
I think it's because I got them from the middle, you know, instead of the root.
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Sloppy.
I've been doing a lot of reading, you know, like, online about, like... just like evolution and, like... and natural selection... and how, like, there's this thing, right?
It is called the apex predator, right?
And basically what this is is the strongest animal in the ecosystem, right?
And as human beings, we are... we're considered the apex predator, but only because, like, smaller animals can't feed on us... because of weapons and stuff, right?
The lion does not feel guilty when it kills a gazelle. Right?
You do not feel guilty when you squash a fly.
And I think that means something.
I just think that really means something.
This one I got really clean 'cause I did this little, like,
lasso thing.
Andrew, what happened at school? Huh?
I need to go and pick up my mom's medication! Oh, yeah?
You're gonna break the rules again?
We're too strong for that now, Andrew!
If you did that, you know what I'd have to do!
You'd have to what?
You have to start thinking.
What would you have to do, Matt?
There are consequences to what you do!
You could not do anything to me because I am stronger than you. Stop that bullshit!
I know what you did. I'm not gonna let you do it again!
I am not going to break your stupid rules!
Okay? So just screw off and stay out of my life!
I can't breathe.
Thank you.
Karen Detmer.
Just one moment.
We're gonna need a next... day delivery.
Co-pay on that is $750.83.
Well, I don't have all that.
Son, I told your dad, and I'll tell you.
You can pay up front, and we can order next... day delivery.
Other than that, I can't help you.
Prick.
I don't give a shit.
Do whatever you want.
Oh!
Hey.
Hey!
Give me all your money.
Uh, what? Who is that?
Doesn't matter who it is.
Just give me all your money or else.
Or else? Shit, man.
Shit, man. Is that Andrew?
It sounds kind of like Andrew under there.
And you got Andrew's broke-ass backpack on.
Oh, you got a gat?
I got a gat too, bitch.
Dude!
Whoa, dude!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey!
The camera needs to stay on for our investigation.
Jesus Christ.
Can I have a moment alone with my son?
If he regains consciousness, notify the officer outside.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh!
Your mother's dead.
She died last night while I was out looking for you.
I came home, and, uh, she was there in her bed.
If I just could have been there for her.
I was always there for her when you were out screwing around.
And this one time... this... one time... that she needed me, and you took me away!
I want you to apologize to me.
I know you can hear me, so I want you to sit up right now... and apologize to me.
You selfish, selfish asshole!
This is your fault!
You...
Do you hear me?
Your mother is dead, and it is your fault!
Happy birthday!
Pound it? Pound it?
Go and get a present.
Go and get a present. Yeah.
- Yes, the big one.
- Oh, my God. Matt.
Matt, your nose again.
Are you okay?
Oh, shit!
Baby, you're really bleeding.
Matt, your nose!
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?
How can you not hear that?
Hear what? What are you hearing?
It's so...
- Something's wrong with Andrew.
- Come in here! Casey!
We apologize for the delay, but as of right now,
every news helicopier in Greater King
County is headed to Seattle. Oh, my God.
Again, right now, we have verry little information,
but if appears a bomb has gone oh' at Ballard Community Hospital.
Casey, come here. Come here.
Come here. Please. Please.
What? No, Matt. Are you seeing this?
Where are your keys at?
What? Matt... Just stay here.
I'll be back.
I just have to drive there, okay?
Please, wait! Matt, please!
Listen, Andrew's in trouble, okay?
Andrew's what?
I'm sure that Andrew is fine.
Andrew needs me! I need to get to the city.
Tell me what's going on.
Shit. I gotta get...
Is that a roadblock?
Nobody else is driving this way!
Talk to me!
- Casey, I need to think, okay?
- Stop!
I gotta find another way downtown.
Shit!
Go back and take the Madison exit.
Come on.
Stay here, Casey. Stay here.
Wait!
Matt, wait for me!
All units, report to Ballard
Community Hospital.
Excuse me.
Sir, excuse me.
Matt!
What are we doing here?
Oh, my God!

Please! Stop!
You did this to me!
Matt! Oh, my God!
Holy shit! Holy shit!
Matt! Casey, we gotta go!
We gotta go right now!
Get in the car!
Let's go.
Andrew's out of control.
What are you talking about?
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you. I...
Oh, my God, Matt!
Stop the car!
It's gonna crash.
Holy shit!
Oh, shit!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off the road now!
Oh, my God!
Hold on to me!
It's not me, it's Andrew!
Hold on!
I can't stop it! I can't control the car!
I can't control it.
Shit!
Andrew!
Oh, God, hold on!
Hold on to me!
I can't get the door open!
Oh, my God!
Andrew! Andrew, stop!
Casey! Matt!
Matt!
Help me!
Casey, hold on!
Matt.
Stay here. Okay?
You have to stay here. Okay?
Matt, please don't go!
Matt!
We got a car on fire under the Needle. Possible casualties.
We need emergency response now.
I don't know how to describe this.
That is the Needle we're looking at, and as you can see, there are...
You're not gonna believe this.
Are you seeing this?
Back away from the window!
What the hell are they doing up there?
Get down!
Seventeen, beware.
You Te gonna ha ve to divert
Andrew!
Andrew, look at me!
This has to stop right now, okay?
This is really, really bad!
Why did you catch him?
- Listen! Just focus, okay?
- I dropped him!
Why did you catch him?
Andrew, this is not a game!
Do you understand?
You're hurting people.
You're weak, Matt! You're all weak!
- Andrew...
- I'm stronger than all of this!
Andrew, listen to me, okay?
Just... Just... I need you to listen.
Just focus for a second.
Do not tell me what to do!
I'm trying to explain.
I got two individuals.
They can't stop us. It's not too late for us to go. It is too late!
I'm done! It's over!
You treated me like shit!
You left me alone!
Andrew, you're not alone up here!
I'm here with you!
I should have been with you all along!
But I'm here now!
And we can stop this right now, you and me!
Andrew, we can just fly away.
We can get out of here.
We can be family.
Andrew.
Andrew, look at yourself.
This isn't who you are.
I'm an apex predator.
What?
I'm an apex predator.
No! No!
Oh, my gosh!
Call the police!
Andrew, no!
Oh! Whoa!
Paul! Paul, stay away from the window! Okay, okay!
Paul! Don't stand at the window!
Are you seeing this? Hey!
Stay down, babe! Stay down!
Andrew!
Two subjects down.
One injured, one mobile.
Andrew? Andrew, look at me.
This is all gonna be fine.
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna get you help, okay?
All units, respond Code 4 to Denny Way.
Get out of here! It's not safe!
Andrew? Andrew?
Are you getting this?
Don't move!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need help! I need help!
He appears to be held at gunpoint but...
Oh, my God!
- Arms up in the air!
- Don't shoot, please!
He's hurt!
Get on the ground!
Wait! Wait!
Do what he says!
Now, get down!
- Do not get up!
- Get on the ground!
Please don't shoot!
We will shoot you!
- I'm not gonna do anything!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! The glass!
Take him out!
Leave me alone!
Shit!
Whoa! Whoa! Wow!
We have multiple explosions.
Get in position!
We have 'em in our sights!
- We're covered!
- Hold it right there!
No! Stop!
We have you surrounded!
No!
Hands where we can see 'em!
Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down!
I repeat, do not move!
Additional units on the far side!
Yo, stay down!
Stay down! Don't move!
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop! Don't hurt them!
Andrew!
Open fire!
Andrew!
Andrew! Andrew, stop!
Please, stop!
Andrew!
Don't make me do this!
Stop!
...reports of casualties.
At least two structures have been destroyed.
I think they're both down!
Two men out.
Show me right now eastbound on...
Yes, sir.
I'm about two blocks away. I see it.
Move up.
Hey! Oh!
What are you doing?
Hey, Andrew.
I just wanted to say that...
I'm sorry and, uh,
I... I hope... that you know that I did what I had to do.
You're not a bad person.
I know that.
That's all that matters.
And, uh, I want you to know... that I'm gonna be better from now on.
I'm gonna help people.
I'm gonna find out what happened to us down there.
I don't care how long it takes.
I'm gonna get answers.
I'm gonna do it for you, and I'm gonna do it for Steve.
And...
I just...
I love you, man.
I didn't ever get a chance to tell you, but I love you.
And guess what.
You made it.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Isn't it beautiful?
Good-bye, Andrew.
English - US - PSDH
Don't.
- Calm down.
- Fuck you.
Calm down.
Fuck you.
Looks like his chute didn't open.
Single shooter.
How do you know?
Please stop doing that.
You're shooting at the wrong people.
How do I know?
Because otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
All right.
You wanna show me the right ones?
Nikolai.
I mean, I'm Nikolai.
What's the last thing you remember, Nikolai?
War. Yeah.
I was with the Chechnya.
And there was a light.
And then I... Then I woke up and I was...
Falling.
Yeah, same thing. I was in Baja.
And then there was a light.
And then chingao.
Where are we?
Maybe she knows.
Shit.
You wanna lower the weapon?
I've never seen this jungle.
And I've seen most.
All right, you think this is Asia?
Maybe Africa?
Too hot for this time of year.
And the topography is all wrong.
Amazon, maybe.
I saw more parachutes.
Which way?
Why?
So I can figure out who threw me out of a fucking airplane.
Fuck. Where's he going?
All right, let's hit the fucking road.
Fuck.
You remember a plane?
I woke up in free fall.
You?
Same.
You're IDF?
Yeah.
Are you in the service?
Not exactly.
You motherfucker.
Come on, you motherfucker.
You with him?
No.
Then why don't you mind your own fucking business?
We have bigger problems right now.
Okay, boss. Whatever you say.
I will finish what you started.
Strength in numbers, huh?
Something like that.
Yeah?
Maybe we should get that guy hanging in the tree?
Help me!
Fuck!
Help me! Somebody!
Fuck. Help!
Hello?
I'm trapped in a parachute in a fucking tree.
Hey, man, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Oh. Thank God.
I think I can...
Stop moving. You're breaking the branch.
You have anything to cut yourself down with?
Why would I... No, I don't.
Look, if we get rope from one of the chutes...
Do something.
- Help!
- It was taking too long.
Help!
Who the hell are you?
I'm a doctor.
I was on my way to work.
Can someone please just tell me, uh, what the fuck is going on here?
Your ass is awesome.
Look.
Goddamn. Who the hell is this guy?
What the hell is that?
Who would do this?
Whoever they are, they take trophies.
In my culture the warrior with the greatest trophies commands the most respect.
Whatever.
It's a test.
To see how we do under pressure.
If this were a test, you'd all be military.
Total strangers.
Live rounds.
This is something else.
Maybe it's ransom.
Back in Tijuana, we kidnap you, put you in an oil drum.
The ransom's not paid, we light you on fire.
I hear these stories about these experiments they run on cons.
They stick drugs in your food and they sit back and watch what happens.
Well, it's not drugs.
If it was a psychotropic compound, we'd be feeling the residual side effects.
Loss of motor skills, blurry vision.
And if it was a behavioral experiment...
I mean, there...
There'd be a point.
What if we are dead?
I was going to be executed in two days.
And I was in combat.
So was I.
This is hell.
Last time I looked, you didn't need a parachute to get there.
It doesn't matter what happened, or why.
We're here.
Only question is, how do we get out?
Where you going?
To high ground.
We need to stick together.
Then you should follow me.
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't do that.
Yep.
Archaefructus liaoningensis.
That is really, really poisonous.
Wouldn't take more than one scratch to cause total paralysis.
Thank you. I'll watch for you out here.
You made a buddy.
Hey.
We need to rest.
So rest.
You look like you could use it, too.
You got a name?
Look.
I'm sorry.
You want to play scout leader, great.
All right? You wanna follow me, fine.
But I'm not doing this.
I'm better on my own.
Wanna see something fucked up?
Well, between that and the sun,
I'd say we have a real problem.
What about the sun?
Hasn't moved since we got here.
What do you think is really going on?
What do I think?
Spetsnaz.
Alpha Group.
Los Zetas, cartel enforcer.
RUF.
It's a death squad from Sierra Leone.
Yakuza, Inagawa-kai.
And the FBI's Most Wanted.
And him.
They're all heavy-hitters.
He doesn't belong.
Belong to what?
I'd say we were chosen.
What about you?
What about me?
You know the jungle. Know the players.
I'm guessing ex-military. Black ops.
Probably a mercenary.
You got a problem with that?
Not at the moment.
Good.
Something was dropped here.
Same as us.
Not the same as us.
You said we were chosen.
Chosen for what?
Oh, shit.
Looking good there, boss.
- Look out!
- Down!
Shit!
Help!
Shit.
Damn it.
Damn it.
12 o'clock. 110 meters.
Take him. Take him.
I don't have to.
Don't have to.
We triggered a dead man's trap.
It's two weeks, judging from the rate of decomposition.
He took up a position here.
Shooting in all directions.
This was a last stand.
United States Special Forces.
This is strange.
He is supposed to be deployed in Afghanistan.
What's he doing here, setting traps for us?
They weren't meant for us.
He was hunting something else.
Something a lot bigger.
Bigger?
The trunk was a dead-fall.
Rule of thumb with a dead-fall is you set the weight five times that of the target animal.
Whatever it was, it got through the trip wires.
And it did this.
Let's move.
What is it?
What is it?
Nothing.
What is it? Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing.
We're gonna need a new plan.
Where are we going?
Someone put us on this rock.
There's got to be a way off it.
What the fuck?
You know what? Fuck this.
This is bullshit, man.
I want a gun.
Come on, man, you got two motherfucking guns, man.
Somebody give me a gun.
Come on, Russian.
You got a big fucking gun.
Come on, man.
Give me a gun.
Give me your gun. Right now.
Give me your gun.
I'm ready to die.
Are you?
Oh.
Help!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Oh.
Shit! Fuck!
Help!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Looking good there, boss.
Go! Go!
Come on. Come on.
Oh, shit!
Come on!
No!
As bad as you are, those things are worse.
So they... They just, what, left?
No.
The whistle.
They were called.
All right, listen up.
Everybody do a shell count.
We got to conserve ammunition.
Reload. Do it now.
Excuse me.
Just what the hell is going on here?
We're being hunted.
The cages. The soldier. All of us.
All brought here for the same purpose.
This planet is a game preserve.
And we're the game.
In case you didn't notice, we just got flushed out.
They sent the dogs in, just like you would if you were stalking boar or shooting quail.
They split us apart and they watched.
Testing us.
How do you know this?
Because that's what I would do.
Fantastic.
Wait.
There are only seven of us.
Help me!
Help!
Help.
- Wait.
- What?
It's a trap.
Help me.
Fuck me.
Help.
Wound one man.
Make him suffer.
Make him bleed.
Make him call out for help, and set a trap and kill those who come.
I know because I have done this.
So we're gonna leave him here, right?
Come on, look at him. He's done.
There's nothing else we can do, right?
Right?
We leave him.
I can't.
Then, that's on you.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
It's a trap. It's a trap. It's a trap.
What are we gonna do?
We should go to higher ground.
Really?
We're trapped on an alien hunting planet.
You really think the solution is to walk more?
It wants us to run.
That's how it hunts.
This is its jungle.
Its game.
Its rules.
We run, we die.
What's the alternative?
We need to know who we're dealing with.
Dog tracks go that way.
We go after it.
Well?
No movement.
It looks like we're not the only things being hunted.
Holy shit!
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that thing?
This is a mistake. We have to leave. Now.
Where is the tough guy?
He left us.
He's here.
Run!
Run! Run! Run!
You set us up.
He led us into that death camp, then hid and waited for that thing to strike.
We were bait.
I needed to know who we were up against.
Now I do.
A man is dead because of that.
This morning you were ready to kill him.
It ain't this goddamn morning, is it?
At least he didn't die in vain.
Why? So we could find out firsthand what it feels like to have our asses kicked?
No. We found out that there's more than one of them.
That they use projectile and energy-based weapons.
That they have some sort of cloaking device.
That they're bigger than us, stronger, but also heavier.
You put us at risk for yourself.
You want to be on your own, you got it.
Why don't you tell them the truth?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.
The way you looked at that thing that was strung up, the way you reacted.
She knows what it is. Don't you?
We don't have a name for them.
'87, Guatemala.
A spec ops team went into the jungle.
High end.
Six men plus a CIA liaison.
Only one made it out.
In his debrief, he said they came in contact with something.
He gave a detailed description.
The thing on the totem.
It wore some kind of camouflage that adjusted to ambient light.
Made it nearly invisible in our spectrum.
It could see in infrared.
Heat signatures.
He used mud to block his.
That's how he beat it.
It hunted and killed his team, one by one.
Whatever it is, wherever they're from, we're going to kill them all.
We set up a defensive perimeter.
Make it look like we are holing up.
That'll bring them to us.
We force them into a choke point.
We get them in overlapping fields of fire.
It can be done.
I can't do it alone.
You know, man, if we ever make it home,
I'm gonna do so much fucking cocaine.
I'm gonna rape so many fine bitches.
I'll be like, "What time is it? 5:00?
"Damn.
"Time to go rape me some fine bitches."
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Like, 5:00, it's bitch-raping time.
Mmm.
Yeah.
- You should stay away from him.
- Yeah.
You still pissed?
Fuck you.
You know what the difference between you and me is?
We both do the same thing.
You just do it for a country, so you don't have to admit you like it.
What happened to you?
What made you so fucked up?
"There is no hunting like the hunting of a man.
"And those who've hunted armed men long enough,
"and like it,
"never really care for anything else thereafter."
That's pretty poetic.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
No, actually.
That was Hemingway.
Fuck.
Why isn't it coming?
They see our traps.
Hey, Doc.
Hey.
I think I just figured out a way you can be useful.
Shit. Shit.
I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.
Oh!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Oh, shit!
Come on. Come on.
Fucking shoot!
Shoot already!
Fuck all of you!
Is he dead? Why ain't you smiling? Oh, shit.
The thing from the cages.
Maybe it thought we're the ones who dropped it here.
Good shot, though.
I missed.
Over here.
Over here.
Over here.
Turn around.
What the fuck are you?
I'm alive.
You talk too loud.
Smelled you since you got here.
If I can smell you, if I can hear you, they can, too.
Storm coming soon. This way.
Wait.
Who are you?
Noland, run away, live to fight another day.
I'm the one that got away.
The one you don't fuck with.
Come on.
Feel the vibe of this place.
Where are we?
It's a drill somebody left behind.
The machine is dead, but the power source ain't.
Wow, what a shit-hole.
You live here?
Oh, no. No. This is my summer home.
I winter in the Riviera.
The schools are so much nicer there.
And the men...
Ooh, la, la!
By the way, you're welcome.
How have you survived?
Salvaging what I can, when I can, from whatever I can.
Oh.
Noland, Ronald.
Air Cav.
They...
They drop you all in, too?
Yeah.
Hmm.
What a rush.
Hey.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Hey, Agent Orange, you wanna put that down?
Certain people around here are particular about other people messing with their shit.
Very important, though.
Disrupts the heat signature.
You motherfuckers.
So, you killed one?
Uh-uh.
I killed two.
Maybe three.
I can't remember. Anyway, there's two different types of them out there.
Hmm? Now they're similar, but they're different.
It's kind of like the difference between dogs and wolves.
The ones that are running things up there, the larger ones, hunt the smaller ones.
It's some kind of blood feud, I guess.
Been going on for a long time.
They do this just for sport?
Oh, yeah, they bring in fresh meat season after season.
I mean, shit you wouldn't believe.
Bring it in, and hunt it and kill it. In that order.
How long you been here, man?
Uh...
Seven seasons, I think.
What? Ten?
Damn.
Anyway, every once in a while, one of us kills one of them.
And, let me tell you, that's when they get real interested.
See, they learn quick. They adapt.
They develop a whole new set of skills.
They come back the next season in threes, always in threes.
Their armor might've changed, or their weapons have changed, or their tactics have changed.
It's amazing.
So, it's like evolution.
They're trying to make themselves into better killers.
Mmm-hmm.
You said they come back.
How?
They got a ship.
- A ship?
- Yeah.
It's 30 yards from their camp.
I told you they wouldn't see it.
I told you they wouldn't.
You were there.
You could've helped us.
How do we kill them?
However you can.
They must have a weakness.
Not many.
You want to survive?
You dig in deep. You stay hid.
Yeah, well, we're gonna go with door number two.
How do we get out of this valley?
Oh.
Ten seasons.
First two seasons...
No, three seasons I was here,
I was walking in the same direction, trying to reach the edge of the preserve.
Let me tell you something, there ain't no edge of the preserve.
Maybe you and your friend wanna tell me about that ship?
Let's see.
That's a brilliant idea. Brilliant.
The whole time I've been here, it never occurred to me to commandeer the alien spacecraft.
But I wouldn't know how to fly it.
He would.
Of course, you know how to fly.
I'll give it a shot.
Well...
I'm gonna get some sleep.
No noise. They're out there.
They're always out there.
Water in there.
Help yourself. All of you.
Who's that?
My kids.
Big one, Ilya. And that's Sascha.
Uh...
This is, uh, Candy Lee.
Tits like howitzers.
Is that your girlfriend?
No. It's my sister.
This is old.
Very old.
They've been doing this for a long time.
You speak English.
Yes.
Why don't you say more?
Because I talk too much.
Thanks.
Do you know what I was doing when I was taken?
Isaac, my spotter.
He was caught.
I could have done something, but then I would have been slaughtered along with him.
So, I hid.
I watched him die.
I wish I pulled that trigger.
You do what you have to, to survive.
You said we were chosen.
I asked, "For what?"
I should've asked why.
It's because we are predators.
Just like them.
We're the monsters of our own world.
It's probably better that we're never going back.
I am going back.
I'm going after that ship.
You learn how to fly it in the last hour and not tell me?
No.
That thing strung up at the camp might know.
My guess is, it'd do just about anything to get free.
Enemy of my enemy.
That doesn't make it a friend.
So what do I call you?
Smoke.
Hey, smoke.
Fuck.
Where's Noland?
He's a scavenger.
He wants what we have.
Come on!
There must be a way out!
- Damn it.
- Do it!
You see the shit you've gotten us into, man?
I told you that.
You never listen to me, though.
Six more.
Six more fucking mouths to feed.
I can barely stand living with you.
How am I gonna live with them, too?
Damn it!
What?
Say goodbye to your little friend.
You're in my house, motherfucker!
Get down.
Yeah, that didn't open up shit.
Wasn't meant to, asshole.
I'm calling in the cavalry.
How the fuck can we get out of here?
Open up, you hanky fucker.
Come on!
Oh.
Finally found me, huh, big dog?
Well, what took you so long?
It's not gonna open!
God damn it!
It's toying with us.
Guys?
Oh, shit.
Hey!
This way.
Hey!
Hey!
I lost you guys!
You got to get me out of here, man.
Come on. Come on.
Let's move.
Oh...
Oh!
We killed it.
We killed it.
We killed it! We fucking...
We fucking killed it.
We killed it.
We fucking killed it. Huh?
Who's your daddy now, motherfucker?
Who's your daddy now, motherfucker?
Hunt my dick, bitch!
Die, you space faggot!
Who do you think you're dealing with,
Hoss? Is that all you've got?
Go! Go!
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Let's get to that ship.
We're close. Come on.
Ow! Shit!
Shit.
Fuck!
Another inch, it would've hit my tibial artery.
I guess this is my lucky day.
It isn't. That trap wasn't meant to kill.
It was meant to maim.
He's dead weight. Come on.
Uh, um...
No, I can still walk.
Oh! Shit. God.
No, he can't. Look.
He's done.
You're gonna beg us to slow down.
- No, no, no.
- To carry you.
You can't leave me here.
You can't. I have a family.
I got kids.
I'm sorry.
We need to go.
No. No!
You are taking me with you!
Look, you and I can still make it.
We use him.
We booby-trap him.
No.
They'll go to him to take trophies.
This is our last chance.
This isn't right. He's one of us!
He is.
That's what they're counting on.
They want you to feel something for this man.
To be human.
And what are you?
Alive.
What's that worth?
You can't. Please.
Please, I'm begging you.
Please.
You should go.
Shit.
- You should've gone with him.
- I know.
Hey.
I want off this planet.
You understand me?
I'll cut you down.
You take me to the ship.
Ship.
You understand me, don't you?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
We're not dead yet.
Shit.
I guess he made it.
If you could do it over again, would you make the same choice?
Yes.
Thank you.
When the time comes,
I'll do us both.
I promise it'll be quick.
No.
It won't.
Cool.
That's right.
It's a neurotoxin.
There's so many to choose from around here.
But don't worry. It's not fatal.
You'll be able to experience everything.
I guess now you realize why they chose me.
I was right in front of you guys the whole time.
Just watching you.
Earning your trust.
You couldn't see me for what I really am.
You see, back home,
I'm a murderer.
I'm a freak.
But here, among the monsters,
I'm normal.
I like it here.
I wanna stay.
Oh! You came back.
I missed my ride.
Oh, thank God.
Help us get out of here.
She's paralyzed.
It gave her something. I don't know what, but it paralyzed her.
Come on.
You're so busy taking care of others, you forgot to look out for yourself.
We're getting out of here.
You just hang tight, okay?
I didn't think you'd come back.
But she, she never lost faith in you.
I guess I owe you an apology.
You are a good man after all.
No.
I'm not.
But I'm fast.
Come here.
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
I won't.
Help me.
I'm one of you.
I'm one of you.
Yes.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Do it.
I'm here. Kill me.
Come on.
Come on.
Do it now. Kill me!
Oh, shit.
Did you get it?
Yeah.
I'm Royce.
Nice to meet you, Royce.
I'm ISABELLE.
Now, let's find a way off this fucking planet.
Don't tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He claims he has the music
But he has a lot of fun
Oh, baby, yeah, baby
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet
She's got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh, baby, yeah, baby
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah
Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and
he ducked back in the alley
Oh, baby, yeah, baby
Oh, baby, having me some fun tonight, yeah
Ahhh!
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet
She's got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh, baby, yeah, baby
Ooh, baby, having me some fun tonight
Have some fun
Having me some fun tonight
ENGLISH - US - SDH
We were once a peaceful race of intelligent, mechanical beings.
But then came the war between the Autobots, who fought for freedom and the Decepticons, who dreamt of tyranny.
Overmatched and outnumbered, our defeat was all but certain.
But in the war's final days, one Autobot ship escaped the battle.
It was carrying a secret cargo, which would have changed our planet's fate.
A desperate mission.
Our final hope.
A hope that vanished.
One up there. One over there.
And one more down there.
What you got?
Impact detected.
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.
What?
Get me SecDef on the phone right away.
Mr. McNamara, the President is expecting you.
Get Bobby in here.
Mr. President, designation, top secret.
We believe a UFO has crashed into the Moon.
We think the Russians are onto it as well.
Well, then you tell NASA to move heaven and earth.
We need to get to the moon.
We're going to attempt a manned mission.
NASA said it would take five years.
You get there before the Russians.
I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
Ignition sequence start.
Five, four, three, two, one.
All engines running.
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.
Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.
Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11 on proper heading.
Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that pillar of flame from the Saturn V out there,
250, 000 miles away, where the moon is waiting for man 's first arrival.
Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.
Forty feet, down two and a half.
Picking up some dust.
Thirty feet, two and a half down.
Faint shadow.
Capcom, flight.
Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.
Down a half.
Contact light.
Okay, engine stop.
Houston,
Tranquility Base here.
The Eagle has landed.
We copy you down, Eagle.
You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
We're breathing again.
Perhaps 400 million persons are watching this broadcast today of the greatest event in our time and one of the great events of all recorded history.
I'm at the foot of the ladder.
Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.
Unofficial time on the first step, 109. ...
Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.
Eagle, we're getting a signal interference. Do you copy?
We now have had confirmation of loss of signal from the Apollo 11.
The Apollo 11 is, at the moment, on the far side of the moon.
Neil, you are dark on the rock.
Mission is a go.
We have 21 minutes.
My God.
It's some sort of giant metal face.
Jesus.
Control, we are inside the ship.
Extensive damage.
Way too big to check the entire ship.
Everything's dead in here, Houston.
No signs of life anywhere.
These things are massive.
We copy. You've got seven minutes on your oxygen.
We are not alone after all, are we?
No, sir. We're not alone.
Go ahead, Mr. President.
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.
And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.
I just can't tell you how proud we all are of you.
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
Because of what you have done. ...
We have splashdown.
....the heavens have become a part of man 's world.
For one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people on this Earth are truly one.
One in their pride in what you have done.
It inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.
My hero needs to wake up.
What is that?
This is your new lucky bunny.
It's a beautiful thought, Carly, but I don't think it's the whole bunny that's lucky.
You see, it's just this section here.
You see, it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?
Today's important.
Come on, get up.
- Hey, wear that nice tie.
- Yeah.
You need any money for lunch?
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.
You love it, don't you?
I'm just your American boy toy.
A lover boy toy.
You know how demoralizing it is to have saved the world twice and still be groveling for a job?
People don't know you saved the world, Sam.
I mean, I do. I believe you.
The government knows. I mean, they could hook me up with a job right here in D. C.
I mean, I should be working with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.
Thank you, man. Great job.
That's the coolest thing that ever happened to me.
All right, guys.
- What the fuck!
- Wow.
And, as I recall, that wasn't even the highlight of your day.
Mr. Ambassador, here.
British Embassy, you're up next.
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.
You're supposed to leave it in the box, right?
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?
- Who?
- POUTS.
President of the United States.
Babe, it's hard for everybody to get a job.
I don't have time. You see, my parents are gonna be here in a week on their road trip Partybus World Tour.
If my dad gets here and I don't have a job, he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.
Romance me with a nice dinner and maybe you can get that bonus.
- Get lucky.
- Get him out of here.
Wait. No, no, no, no.
- Oh, he's gross!
- She's good.
They're stranded here. Somebody's got to watch out for them.
Yesterday, that one was in my underwear drawer.
Did research. Looking real good, too.
No need to hit me.
- You are not a normal boyfriend.
- That's what you love about me.
- Crybaby.
- We're not at the love word yet.
Maybe a little bit closer when you're covering your half of the rent.
Good-bye.
Frickin' shorting my circuits out here!
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!
Stop, okay?
You and your creepy sidekick can't be in here without permission.
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?
Giddyup, little doggie!
- Yo, Brains, wassup?
- Doing good.
Shit, I seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.
You know, Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.
What if she dumps us like the last girl?
She was mean. Didn't like her.
Us guys got to stick together.
We are family
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee, and I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.
Well, you tell her that we're not your pets, and we're not your toys!
All right? We're an advanced, genius alien race just looking for a home.
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
- Didn't have to stop.
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?
Where is he?
Sammy!
- Come on, that's funny!
- Sam.
I missed you guys so much.
Sure, you did. What do you think?
- Look at that.
- Cute.
- You look old.
- Stop it.
Feel like I can see the end.
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?
- Where's my beautiful Carly?
- She's at work, Ma.
She's got a new job. You guys said you were gonna be here in a week.
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?
We just hauled ass in this thing.
- We stopped for gas.
- This thing. The love tub, it flies.
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.
I have job interviews.
That's good.
- That sucks.
- Stop it.
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D. C.
You're here with your son and your family.
- I mean, it's a good time.
- It sucks that you don't have a job.
Yeah, but there's good things to do here, too, right?
Right? Museums and monuments, okay?
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm bagging the gift.
Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.
I think for life, you should wear real pants.
What happened to Bumblebee?
He's off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.
- Your car has a job, huh?
- Stop.
What does it change into?
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee, if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.
Come on, we'll give you a ride!
In the years since our arrival, our new home, Earth, has seen much change.
Energon detectors guard its cities now.
Long-range defense systems watch the skies.
So now we assist our allies in solving human conflicts, to prevent mankind from bringing harm to itself.
On the ground, per favore!
And stay there!
We work in secret teams on various missions around the globe.
And all the while we search for signs of our true enemies' return.
I am Voshkod, General Counsel with Ukrainian Department of Energy.
My government will officially deny that we're having this conversation.
At one of our decommissioned facilities, a discovery was made, which I fear may be alien in nature.
The facility's name is Chernobyl.
Mr. Voshkod.
So, uninhabited since '86.
I hear it won't be livable again for another 20,000 years?
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.
It's a tragedy.
This way.
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.
Watch your radiation levels.
Mr. Voshkod, where's your protective gear?
Where's your protective gear?
It would not matter.
For me, it's only a matter of time.
Through the school.
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.
In private, there were some energy experiments.
It can wait.
Keep moving. Stay tight.
Okay, right here. I think I found it.
Optimus, we got a visual.
Looks like the object's clamped in some kind of a metal harness.
What's this? Guys!
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?
Sputnik?
Energon readings, sir. It's strong.
Below us. It's coming fast.
Contact, contact!
Get topside now! Move, move, move!
- Let's go!
- Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!
Stay behind me!
Optimus!
Fall back!
It's circling around us!
It's taking our flank!
Get the heavy weapon!
Optimus!
What the hell was that thing?
That is Shockwave.
Why was he after this?
It's impossible.
This is an engine part from a long lost Autobot ship.
Pleasure working with you.
Interviews. This is so exciting.
Honey, do you want some gum?
Your breath gets really gnarly when you're nervous.
- Mr. Witwicky?
- Yeah. Search is over.
I'm Mr. Whitley.
Mr...
- Is anybody else joining?
- No.
No? You want me to move right there?
- I'll move right there.
- I'd prefer not.
Ready? Begin.
Graduated this year. Majored in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.
Very interested in government and technology, how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.
Shape the future.
Why did we bother sending him to an lvy college for?
Three months out of school and he can't find a job?
Mr. Masuhisu...
Matsumoto.
- Matsumoto.
- Moto.
- Martha, can I call you Martha?
- No, you may not.
Okay, Jack, there's two types of people in this world.
There's think ers, there's doers.
There's winners, there's dreamers, and there's buddies.
What about some weaknesses?
I don't...
You have a very trustworthy face.
You remind me of like an Asian Colonel Sanders.
A man I can trust.
He's a millennial.
That means they're the, you know, like lost generation.
Why was the FBI looking for you?
The what?
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.
It was during all that alien craziness when you were 14.
I mean, they were very kind to me, found me in a jiffy.
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy in the office, with a medal.
- From Obama?
- Yeah.
In this office, we're mostly Republicans, so...
I'm not feeling too good.
- No?
- No.
Why don't you get a little dipping tray and dip the dog in Pepto?
That's a solution.
I got another one. We got to go.
- Come on.
- Really?
Sit.
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky, recent college graduate.
Previous experience, next to zero, yet he has a recommend letter from our board?
WTF to that.
- Do I know somebody on your board?
- Here's the deal.
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems, global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL, you name it.
You perform here, doors open for you anywhere.
First job out of college is critical, kid.
You either take a step down the correct career path or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.
So it all depends on how you respond to my next two words.
Impress me.
- Now?
- Impress me.
You catch me off guard.
- I don't know where to begin.
- Impress me.
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.
- So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
- Yes, sir.
...take-charge kind of guy?
I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.
So, take-charge guy?
Tak e-charge, Viking, barbarian, of course, that's me.
Pow! I'm here.
We are not looking for that here.
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...
Yes, Mr. Brazos.
Why is Shontel using what appears to be a red cup from the red floor
- when we are on the yellow floor?
- I'm on it.
It is a visual and, therefore, a visceral betrayal.
Stop it!
Such a dumbass.
Disgusting!
Thank you!
It's total anarchy around here.
The e-mail I read said administrative aide?
Nope. Mailroom.
I'm gonna go.
Do you have any idea how many lvy League Phi Beta Kappas
- would kill to...
- Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?
I can't tell you how or when or why, but I have done shit that matters and I'd just kind of like a job where I matter again.
So thank you, but no, thank you, okay?
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.
But, son, this is the job that's standing in your way.
And that's why you're gonna be so very, very good at it.
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.
All arriving Autobots, in par, training and debriefing in 15 minutes.
Dino, report to Bay 23.
Sideswipe, Bay 37 for weapons assessment.
Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NSA wants funding, they call me.
When the CIA is gonna take out a target, they ask first for my permission.
And when the President wants to know which members of Congress are politically vulnerable in terms of, let's say, undiscovered criminal conduct,
I'm the number he dials.
U. S. Agencies say they have been monitoring the blast.
But if, in fact, this was a covert military strike,
- no nation has claimed responsibility.
- CIA is up my ass about this mystery raid in the Middle East.
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?
I'm not sure, ma'am.
All right, guys. This is how you do a Decepticon head kill shot.
As Director of National Intelligence,
I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers.
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.
They like to sneak out of the house every once in a while.
Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?
Yes, ma'am, I am.
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."
Do I look like a "ma'am"?
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.
This gun is my perfect invention, Ironhide.
Right.
Good, you're here!
Me name's Que.
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?
Our Director of National Intelligence?
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.
What is this, the silent treatment?
- We've seen that and this is not that.
- Definitely not.
This is worse.
Prime! Make something of yourself!
He's pissed.
You lied to us.
Everything humans know of our planet we were told had all been shared.
So why was this found in human possession?
We were in the dark on this also.
It was Director Only clearance at Sector 7 until now.
The bag.
- Which bag?
- Hermès. Birkin. Green ostrich!
Oh, my God.
This is a secret few men knew, and fewer still remain alive.
Allow me to please introduce to you two of NASA's founding mission directors and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to step foot on the moon.
Sir? Optimus Prime.
From a fellow space traveler, it's a true honor.
The honor is mine.
Our entire space race of the 1960s, it appears, was in response to an event.
Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.
No survivors onboard.
We were sworn to secrecy by our Commander in Chief.
This was a mission you will never speak of.
I understand, sir.
A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.
We believe the Russians deduced that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly, believed they had it mastered, and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.
We landed six missions in all.
We took hundreds of photos and samples.
We locked them away forever, and the moon program was shut down.
Well, did you search the crash vault?
The ship's name was the Ark.
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.
It was carrying an Autobot technology which would have won us the war.
And its captain.
Who was its captain?
The great Sentinel Prime, the technology's inventor.
He was commander of the Autobots before me.
It's imperative that I find it before the Decepticons learn of its location.
Our Autobot spacecraft has the ability to get there.
And you must pray it's in time.
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.
Carly!
- You got the job?
- This is crazy.
- You really got it?
- Yes.
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.
You are so welcome.
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.
You said you were his assistant curator, you didn't say the guy owns Space Mountain.
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Sam.
Dylan Gould.
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure meeting you.
Carly's told me a lot about you.
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.
It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.
Thank you very much. It leaks.
Before Carly came to help run the collection, it was just a complete mess.
But now, the restorations are back on track.
We're going to Pebble Beach this year, and we're gonna get a trophy for that stand right there.
You know why?
Because this woman right here
- is my secret weapon.
- Okay.
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organized.
You've done much more than that, my Duchess.
Nicknames, that's fun.
Yeah. The Duchess.
She's adorable.
You know, when I stole her away from the British Embassy,
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.
"Try managing a priceless collection of art."
Tak e a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.
Designed by a Frenchman.
Look at the curves.
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.
Sensual.
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.
Come on.
My dad had a $10 desk and a dream, and he built it into an empire.
Wow.
We're the largest accounting firm in the U.S.
I started up the venture side after he passed. Invest in the future.
Try and bet on the winners.
See, collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.
You guys look great.
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.
- I haven't seen that one.
- No. Me, neither.
Jeans are tight.
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?
And you're gonna wave at him while he's judging me?
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.
No, I totally understand.
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy anymore.
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?
None of the above. Check!
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.
Get in the car, please.
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.
- I think I can handle it.
- Hold on, hold on.
It's the smiling back part that gets me. Okay?
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.
That works for me.
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32 % done with my restoration.
Some chrome work, put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.
You know, Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job-wise.
Just so you know,
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems, and I put in a call for you.
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.
You're a lucky man.
Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.
You're a go for landing.
Ratchet, let's roll.
We're entering the Ark.
His levels are faint.
He locked himself away to guard the pillars.
Sentinel.
You're coming home, old friend.
All hail Megatron.
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.
My poor master.
How it pains me to see you so wounded, so weak.
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!
You know what you are told, which is nothing.
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.
And what news from your little assassin?
Autobots have taken the bait!
They've discovered the Ark and returned with its cargo.
You did me great honor tracking that ship to the moon.
Your human collaborators have served their purpose, Soundwave.
It's time to eliminate loose ends.
Laserbeak, kill them all.
With pleasure.
Is your daddy home?
- "Then Madeline said..."
- Madeline!
Hello, Mom.
Get out of the house!
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just visiting.
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?
You ever show up in my office with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.
You got that?
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart for two-and-a-half years, okay?
I want you to live it, love it and name it.
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?
- Yes, sir.
- Move!
I found that paper
I was telling you about.
- What are we looking at?
- Shut up!
You do that to me again, and I'll kick your ass!
Hi.
Hi, angel.
- How are you?
- Good.
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual isn't exactly a page turner.
This is great.
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world, and I have organized four binders.
I'm living the dream. Come on.
Visitor violation.
- You okay?
- Absolutely.
I'm next.
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.
It's a work thing, but he's invited you, too.
Did he?
I want you to come and laugh at my bad jokes.
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?
I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?
- Car.
- You don't have a car.
- Yes, I do.
- What, did you win it in a raffle?
He gave me one.
He gave you a car?
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.
A work perk.
- What kind of car did he give you?
- A Mercedes SLS AMG.
Really throaty engine.
Mercedes-Benz SLS
- combines breathtaking performance. ...
- You drove this here?
That's a $200, 000 car.
I know.
You know how long it would take me to afford a car like this?
- A long time?
- Yeah, like 53 years.
He said it was for both of us.
Then what we should do is, we should sell it and buy a house.
You're frustrated, I know.
I've been there.
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.
Who would like to score some Bruce Brazos points?
Bruce, you found your guy.
Witwicky!
The man who makes this company run.
Now, who have we here?
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?
- Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
- Hi.
I'm his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right.
You really do have a smashing head of hair.
Well, thank you.
- Sam, I got to run.
- Yeah.
Here, your present.
Your favorite color.
- N ice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
- And you.
See you, boys.
I'm still stewing about that binder incident, Jerry.
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!
I know who you are!
Witwicky! Witwicky!
- I'm talking to you!
- Excuse me. Thank you.
Slow down, tiger.
You showed up in the background of six different photos, two continents, with aliens.
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.
See you!
Give me my jacket!
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.
You're not getting it. Deep Throat.
Watergate? I'm talking code to you...
Damn it.
They watch and listen.
I can't go to the government, but you can!
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!
Dark Side! Why do you think no one's been up there since 1972?
I know you're speaking English, it's just a very strange English.
That's why I'm not...
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.
It's my manifesto.
They're whacking us out, everyone who knows what's on the dark...
Your alien friends are in danger, you know, the good ones. It's up to you.
Calm down.
Easy, Sam!
What are you looking at?
Yo, dawg.
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?
Staredown, you and me.
Guess I won.
Moon satellites.
The Russian space program.
Experts dead.
Space program ends.
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.
I did everything you want!
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of the stuff...
Whoa! Knock first!
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who are you? Who are you?
You straddled me in the stall.
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.
- You took your package out.
- Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?
One phone call from me and I'll have you fired.
Yes, I will, Gaylord!
Are you okay?
Hemorrhoids!
Should I come back?
When should I come back?
Come back when you learn some manners!
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite, just like I promised,
I can put a blind spot in the program as a bonus.
What more do you want from me?
Jerry, you are my favorite.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
I know, but my superiors need me to...
- Please, you don't have to...
...suicide you.
What did you say to Witwicky?
Shit!
Who wants some chick en dinner now, bitch?
'Cause somebody messed with the wrong Wang today!
Come on! You want some of me?
I don't need any more didactic lectures from Chuck.
Jesus!
Get legal.
That's Jerry!
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died, but looking out the window is not going to bring him back.
The man was depressed.
Don't take a picture!
You can keep watching him, but he's not getting up.
You all read "Humpty Dumpty." Okay?
Witwicky.
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.
Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro.
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.
You see the sidewalk down there? Man!
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.
Hey, when did we get a new copier?
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw.
Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.
This is exceedingly Japanese.
They never make it easy, do they?
- What is with you?
- This is the real deal, Carly, okay?
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.
You gotta open that gate right now.
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.
Right. Packing M4s?
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?
- Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
- Babe...
Where'd you get that hat from, nursing school?
So, you're nurses and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.
- Babe.
- Yes.
I don't think we're in the right place.
We are in the right place.
We're in the right place and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.
- You're gonna get Optimus out here.
- Sir.
Sir, you got the wrong building.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What part of "Decepticons are back" do you not understand?
Yo! You being a smartass?
Do not hit my car! It's a collector's item!
I wouldn't do that.
You're crazy!
We got an Energon reading!
We've got aliens in the vehicle!
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!
Got aliens in the vehicle!
- Freeze! Get out!
- We're freezing!
Are you...
Are you kidding me?
Sam, they've got guns!
- I got him. Go!
- Bee! Is Bee in there?
Okay, all right!
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven, dickhead.
- That's right.
- A-hole.
How's your car now?
That's my car.
Come here.
Come here!
Come on. Sam.
What is your deal?
I know your black ops stuff is important to you.
I'm not trying to diminish it or guilt-trip you or anything,
I just never see you anymore.
You can't come to the garage and just hang out one night?
Sam. That makes me feel bad.
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.
What, we not good enough for you anymore?
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?
Raise your hand if you had a flying psycho-ninja copier trying to kill you today!
Those are my brass knuckles.
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?
And my toe rings?
All NEST officials clear the floor.
We have 10 minutes until attempted contact.
We've taken possession of the five devices that were hidden in the ship with Sentinel Prime.
They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.
They say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization, so we're gonna keep these locked up until we know what we're dealing with.
Right now, no one gets access. No one.
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.
He was talking about the dark side of the moon,
- then they killed him.
- Wait a minute.
- He mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.
But why would Decepticons want to kill humans?
I thought their war was with the Autobots.
And that is when he made his first quick-look science report.
That's what we want...
Who's the chick? Okay.
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?
Director Mearing, this is Sam Witwicky...
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime, when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house?
This is the
National Intelligence Director.
In case you...
- H i.
- Disrespecting a federal officer?
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?
She's my girlfriend.
What is this, like, a date?
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.
Hey, I have an idea. How about we get back to the important topics, like the fact that I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon?
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge a complaint, as a matter of fact.
Okay, listen, all right?
One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today.
He was involved in NASA's lunar mapping probe.
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.
We cannot entrust national security to teenagers unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.
I don't care who you are.
If you breathe a word of what you see in here, you will do time for treason.
Do you understand me?
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.
You will.
Sentinel Prime.
These things run on Energon, and he's out of it. He's in a sort of a sleep mode.
Let us begin.
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.
He holds the only thing in the universe that can repower a Transformer's spark.
This is incredible.
Sentinel Prime, we bid you return.
Hold your fire!
Stop! Sentinel!
It is I, Optimus Prime!
It is all right. You are safe.
There is nothing to fear.
We are here.
You are home, Sentinel.
The war... The war!
The war was lost.
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.
We have taken refuge here, on planet Earth.
Its human race is our ally.
My ship. We came under fire.
The pillars. Where are the pillars?
You saved five of them, including the control pillar.
Only five?
We once had hundreds!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
May I ask, what is this technology you're looking for?
It is the ability to reshape the universe.
Together the pillars form a space bridge.
I designed, and I alone, can control it.
It defies your laws of physics to transport matter through time and space.
You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?
Yes, for resources, for refugees.
Refugees, or troops of soldiers, weapons, maybe bombs!
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?
It is our technology and it must be returned.
Yes. If humans say so.
You can't just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere!
You kind of have to clear customs first!
A little formality called paperwork kind of separates us from the animals.
I will overlook your condescending tone if you heed the gravity of mine.
The Decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.
For in their hands, it would mean the end of your world.
"Total Nightmare" file.
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.
And, for the time being, we're gonna send you home with Autobot protection.
Who do I need to speak to to get you guys to understand that I can help, that I can contribute?
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?
I could tell you about the solar system, all the fun planets to hang out in.
Get off my desk, please.
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.
Oh, my God.
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...
This is a unit for veteran intelligence officers and Special Forces, not for boys who once owned special cars.
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?
So, are those yours?
Yeah. CIA.
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal, from the President.
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?
No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.
You're breaking my chain of command.
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.
With all due respect, young man,
I appreciate what you did.
But you're not a soldier.
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.
He's a hero.
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.
That dog can't protect crap.
Bee?
You miss hanging out?
Yeah, me, too.
That woman, she called me a messenger.
Can you believe that? After everything
I've done, I'm a messenger.
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy, we feel the same way.
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.
We should do something about it.
Bee, I need to know why they're killing humans.
I say we call in the expert.
My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative who has dared to speak out regarding our alleged military alliance with what many describe as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.
He is the author of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.
Former special agent,
Seymour Simmons.
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.
Now, Agent Simmons, you would have us believe that it is in our best interest to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war?
Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.
These Decepticons are lethal.
But polls show half the world would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone.
Get them out of here!
We don't need them here!
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.
Doesn't mean I'm always right.
Now, agent, here at The Factor we have obtained documents that show you were fired. ...
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview.
- Sorry, Mr. Simmons.
Downsized, Bill.
- Budget cuts. Chaz, out.
- Your psych evaluation reports
"severe delusional tendencies."
This is ambush journalism.
You want the truth about the alien alliance?
Buy my book! Buy my book, before it's too late, people!
You want a piece of me, Bill?
- You want to get naked? I'm ready!
- Wow.
- Interview is over! You, out of my house.
- You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.
- And I've got a suggestion for you.
- It's over. Understand?
- Damage control.
- Dutch!
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.
I have called the police!
You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant!
What's up next? What have we got?
Book signing, Midtown, noon.
Then we pitch your reality show to the Discovery Channel.
And I have this Witwicky who keeps calling me.
Five times today.
Kid? What does he want?
I called you because the Decepticons are back.
I want to know why, and I need your help.
They're back?
Well, that's good for business.
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret that nobody ever told you.
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?
Do not relapse. I won't.
Do not let the demons win.
Got it.
What kind of secret?
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.
Apollo.
Dutch!
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.
I've wondered what might have been if you had fought the final battle, instead of me.
Never mourn the past, young warrior.
Thanks to you, our race survives.
You were our leader, Sentinel.
It is your right to lead us again.
In a world I do not know,
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.
You've got to break this case down.
What we have here is an astronaut epidemic.
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.
It's like these guys can't drive.
They can fly into outer space, but they can't drive a car.
- Procured your information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.
Now, let me see one right now. One time.
- Quick.
- Very.
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.
It says NASA launched it in 2009.
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code, preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon, which is also the dark side.
Fucking awesome.
They infiltrate us, intimidate us, coerce us to do their dirty work.
And once they're done, a double-tap to the cerebellum.
So humans are working for the Decepticons.
I don't think this is about the Decepticons looking for something on the moon.
I think it's about something they wanted to hide.
Come to Daddy.
Come on, throw down.
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?
He's a freak.
- Like it?
- Get back!
I'm ticklish!
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level alien intel confab here that I don't think you're cleared for, errand boy.
Yeah, you're right.
- It's a bitching robot.
- I think it's time to go, Bruce.
- Thank you so much for this. And...
- Got to go, Bruce.
I'm smoking over here. Downloading missing Russian cosmonauts.
Turns out the Soviets canceled a manned mission to the moon.
The moon, in 1972.
And two of their cosmonauts went into hiding in America.
And I just found them alive.
You're a genius, Brains.
That was smooth, Bumblebee.
Missed it by that much.
Hi.
Would somebody care to tell me what the hell's going on?
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!
Certainly.
No. Dutch.
Don't touch me.
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- Sam?
Angel.
I was working. I'm sorry about this.
- Great. We're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.
You had your chance to frisk her.
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?
India.
We're supposed to be at Dylan's party, remember?
I do remember, but these are my friends.
They need me.
I have to be here right now.
So, what, the Autobots and the military, they can't handle this on their own?
You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?
It's that they were stories, they were in the past.
Look, I know you're thinking about your brother, okay?
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.
- No?
- No.
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?
You think we'd rather have his medals, or we'd rather have him?
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!
Just stop for a second.
You think I could sleep last night?
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.
- He doesn't know who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.
You matter to me.
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.
But I promise you, I can handle this.
Can you? You can promise it?
I promise.
Sam, I don't want to lose you, and I know where this leads.
I'm not ready for this.
Are you coming with me?
I can't.
Okay.
Hey.
Here's your foot.
The warrior's path is a solitary one.
How the hell did she afford that car?
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!
I used to hate them. Now, it's...
Going to a gig on the hunt for two Russian cosmonauts.
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell you.
My Dutchman, former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire, tracked them down here.
So, these cosmonauts went into hiding. Why?
Bingo. I got a match.
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.
The thing about Russians is, they never like to talk.
It's gonna take a little of the "international language."
That means "good-bye."
Stay loose.
Dutch, give me something tough.
Baryshnikov.
We do speak English.
Dutch, you suck.
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.
It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator!
I don't suck.
Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.
So what?
You were supposed to travel to the dark side of the moon, then it all got shut down.
The question is, why?
"Can my child smoke in here?"
Okay, all right. Okay.
Go ahead, shoot me.
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?
Really?
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever told you you're beautiful?
She's a beautiful woman.
Hey!
Dutch! Back in the cage.
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.
Dutch, stop!
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War II is over.
You are about to see one of the biggest Soviet secrets.
America first to send man to the moon.
But USSR first to send camera.
In 1959, our Luna 3 take picture of the dark, the shadow side.
Sees nothing.
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...
- Strange rocks.
- Yeah.
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.
Yeah, show picture.
With some drag marks.
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.
Alien pillars for a space bridge.
We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.
The Decepticons must have raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there, took the pillars, and hid them.
It doesn't make sense.
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.
Why would they leave Sentinel when he's the only one who can use them?
Unless...
He's the one thing they still need.
We've got to meet up with Sentinel, rendezvous with him and keep him safe.
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.
We're coming to NEST now.
Mr. Witwicky,
I thought I made it clear to you that I did not want you calling this phone.
Listen, the whole thing has been a setup since the beginning.
The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel because only Optimus could revive him.
But we have the space bridge.
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.
You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.
What do you need me to say to you?
The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime!
We're going to NEST.
We have an Energon alert.
Energon readings detected on the D. C. Parkway.
Currently tracking three black Suburbans.
Bee, you got to get Sentinel out of here! You got to guard him!
Oh, mein Gott! I'm fired!
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
Got you!
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!
Bee!
All right, back to NEST!
Dino, I got him!
Ironhide!
Is there a problem?
A little Mexican standoff we got here.
Weapons down.
And we'll let you escape with your dignity.
Drop them.
That's good.
Ironhide, watch out!
Ironhide, catch!
Behind you!
Decepticon punk!
Class dismissed.
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Keep moving!
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go!
We got Decepticons everywhere.
I've got my whole team deployed looking for them. Ironhide!
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!
Consider it done!
Hey, you've got to guard him,
'cause he's the key to the whole thing.
Indeed, I am. What you must realize, my Autobot brothers, is we were never going to win the war.
For the sake of our planet's survival, a deal had to be made with Megatron.
- Get back!
- What have you done?
I hereby discharge you from duty.
- Bee!
- Get back!
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!
No...
Get a medic down here!
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!
Just go to the back gate.
Tak e cover!
Watch left! Watch left!
Www.celebritysex.tk
- Director, don't go there!
- Stand down!
Hey, Sentinel!
- Director!
- What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
I am a Prime!
I do not take orders from you.
Director Mearing, come on.
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.
Now return what belongs to me!
Oh, my God!
- You guys okay?
- Is everybody out?
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101St Airborne!
We need to hunt this thing down!
Carly!
Hot from our little campfire.
S'mores. Isn't that great?
We're really living off the land.
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.
Why wouldn't she be at home?
We had a fight and we might have broken up, or be on a break. I don't really know.
- What? No.
- Look, I can't talk about it right now.
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.
Sit down. We're having a family meeting. Family meeting!
You may not know this, but your father and I were not always this perfectly happy.
You know, there was a time in our marriage when I thought this was not gonna work out.
- Can we please not?
- She's damaging him.
You break up with one world-class hottie...
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,
I moved on to something better.
That's it. I'm a happier person.
The second beautiful girl, and you lose her.
Why don't you help me?
- They had an argument.
- One fight.
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...
What the... Ma!
Maybe you just don't know what you're doing.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- You need the book.
- Tell him about the book.
- You're always wrong. Get used to it.
Okay. You've gotta read this.
She Comes First.
- There's some killer shit in here.
- No. No.
- That's it, I'm going.
- No! No!
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Heck yeah.
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery for the rest of your...
- Stop.
- It's true.
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles, he moved heaven and earth to find me.
Say what you said. Say it.
"I will follow you to the end of time."
Does that suck or what?
- It's like a bad sci-fi film.
- No. It is so sweet.
I want you to get out of the city. You get as far away from here as you can.
You understand?
I love you.
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!
So when Sentinel left Cybertron, it was to defect?
He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth before fate waylaid us both.
The only way to revive him, we needed Prime and his Matrix.
Excellent strategy.
Mine, mine!
So he is now your partner, master?
He is my greatest triumph.
So impressive.
Commencing transport.
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!
Forgive me.
Here we are.
Fight us now.
Contact!
Watch out! Move it! Move it!
Autobots, retreat!
Why, Sentinel, why?
For Cybertron! For our home!
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.
No, it's not the only way. This is our home! We must defend the humans!
So lost you are, Optimus.
On Cybertron, we were gods.
And here, they call us machines.
Let the humans serve us, or perish.
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.
It's not over.
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.
It's funny. I was just thinking on the way over here,
I could really use some advice from Dylan, and there he is.
- Can I speak to you, Carly?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.
Have a drink.
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?
Excuse me.
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.
I really think I can help you, Sam.
I remember a talk I had with my dad once about tough choices.
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.
Of course, it was way back, when my dad's firm was in charge of budget review and accounting for NASA.
You see, the thing that he taught me was, when it's not your war, you join the side that's going to win.
Move.
Too direct? Or is it just me?
Certainly not you, sir.
You're mine!
No!
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!
- Someone get help!
- Good night!
Good night, Mr. Dylan.
Get me out of here!
Help! Get help!
- He's young. He will learn. Good night.
- Get me out!
It was a fun night.
You really think you're the first man ever asked to join the noble alien cause?
Who are you?
Do you know why we've not been back to the moon since 1972?
Because these two, they came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting.
Make it way too expensive to ever go back. So, he and the others shut down the American and Russian space programs.
And they've been our clients ever since.
- You helped them kill people?
- You think they'd give you a choice?
Besides, it's not like I personally participated.
I am a liaison. I liaise.
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.
Sam!
- Sam!
- Let her go!
Sam!
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.
You're the one spy
I've never been able to provide as someone close to the Autobots.
Sam! Don't do what he wants!
Yes, he will.
They all do.
They will slaughter her, you understand me?
In the time it takes you to blink, they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.
So you show a little respect when someone offers you a job!
Wrist.
You are to track down Optimus Prime, because you're the one human he trusts, and you will ask one question.
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.
It lets us see what you see, hear what you hear and it taps your nervous system.
So, if you so much as try and signal...
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.
She is here because of you.
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!
Soundwave, would you please?
Sam, do your job.
She'll be safe. I give you my word.
I'll kill you. You have my word.
Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1.
Approximately 200 Decepticons are now in hiding.
Energon detectors have been triggered as far away as South America and China.
The U. N. Just received an encrypted audio file.
They say it's from the leader of the Autobots.
Defenders of Earth.
We have come for your natural resources to rebuild our damaged planet.
When we have transported all we need, we will leave your world in peace.
For such peace to exist, you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored.
Nonnegotiable.
Renounce the rebels.
We await your reply.
We'll debrief you in transit.
Yeah, I really don't see how I can be of any help.
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.
We could just do this another time,
I think.
I have underestimated you at every turn.
What?
You warned us that they were using humans.
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.
Director!
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security risk.
Are you all right?
Yes.
- No, you're not. You're sweating.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.
I'm nervous because you got me in here with this information.
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.
- I can't keep a secret to save my life.
- You wouldn't dare.
- That's the truth. I'm telling you.
- Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?
Get away from me.
It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.
Just moments ago, legislation was passed to exile the Autobots from American shores.
The U. S. Military alliance with them is officially over.
In the words of the House Majority Leader, the sponsor of today's resolution,
- "We cannot in good conscience...."
- Okay.
What? They can't do this.
- You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
- Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.
These are our allies. The Autobots fought for us. They fought with us.
And where are we now?
Facing an enemy invasion with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.
If there is any more you know, anything at all about the enemy's intentions, now is the time to tell.
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.
And that is where you're wrong.
Its name is the Xanthium.
It brought the second wave of Autobots and it's been under NASA 's care and study ever since.
We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle to maintain military control until they're gone.
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!
You're gonna risk the lives of all me mates! I'll ball you!
These guys are the Wreck ers.
They take care of the Xanthium.
We don't let them off the base much,
'cause they're assholes.
You gotta pull that, ya nancy swanker!
It's time to kill him!
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.
- Epps!
- You are ridiculous!
- Is that you?
- What up, man?
What are you doing here?
I retired from the Air Force.
Can you let my hand go?
What the hell was that?
Now I just consult to run interference for them.
Well, you're not helping!
No more combat and aliens shooting at my ass. I got a dream job.
Time to get off this planet.
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?
- Where do you think it's taking them?
- Any planet but here.
I wanna talk to whoever's in charge here!
Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.
So I see you survived Washington.
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.
And if you think deporting nine Autobots is gonna solve a damn thing...
It's out of my hands.
Moving up in the world?
Your booty looks excellent.
If you ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico,
I'll cut your heart out.
You already did.
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.
- Don't let them take us, Sam.
- It's a Decepticon trap.
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.
Optimus?
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.
Remember this.
You may lose your faith in us, but never in yourselves.
I need to know how you're gonna fight back.
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.
There is no plan.
If we just do what they want, how are we gonna live with ourselves?
You are my friend, Sam.
You always will be.
But your leaders have spoken.
From here, the fight will be your own.
Make it short.
We're loading up.
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.
You will always be my friend, Sam.
I gotta be going on.
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,
"Where were you when they took over the planet?"
We're gonna say,
"We just stood by and watched."
You should really look at this as a partnership.
You have to stand on the side of progress if you wanna be a part of history.
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Go ahead and throttle up.
You wanted an answer. You got one.
I always get what I want, Sam.
We just needed to be sure.
Sure of what?
That they would go without a fight.
- Say again.
- Tracking an incoming object.
We all work for the Decepticons now.
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.
He's the head of their human operations and he has Carly hostage.
I want you to sit down. Don't move.
Follow me.
I'm watching him drive up right now.
The call was placed en route.
I'm hacking into the phone's camera now.
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.
We're on.
- I'm going.
- You sure?
She's done nothing but try to help me, and I can be there in 15 hours.
You're not going alone.
I still got my NEST friends out there.
I'll round them up, we'll find your girlfriend, we're gonna bring this guy in.
Why are you helping me?
'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.
They said they were here for our resources, to rebuild their planet.
Yes, but really one resource in particular.
One unique to our planet.
Us?
You're very smart.
You see, they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.
How many rocks up there in the universe offer six billion workers?
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.
Oh, my God.
What's Sentinel doing here?
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now.
In just a few hours, they're gonna launch them into orbit and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere.
The red one there controls the rest.
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.
- You want this to happen?
- I want to survive. I want 40 more years.
You think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves,
I guess they'll still need a human leader.
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.
It is time for the slaves of Earth to recognize their masters.
Seal off the city.
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they?
You think I'm at every meeting?
Look, I'm safe.
They said I was safe.
Let's roll!
We had a signal earlier.
It's not working.
This is a national emergency broadcast.
Chicago has suffered a massive attack.
Wrong way!
Get out of here! Go back!
There is a ring of alien ships around Chicago.
Our high-range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.
They can 't get through enemy air defenses over the city.
Our satellites have been jammed.
We have no way to monitor the enemy's movement.
Our old NEST teams are on stand-down holding at Grissom Air Force Base.
We're about 10 minutes from the battle zone.
We have Special Forces trying to gain access to the city, and infantry is staging at the perimeter.
Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense!
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?
They keep shooting down our drones.
They want us blind.
But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.
Well, whoever's manning these UAV drones, can we try to redirect them toward Trump Tower?
The kid, Witwickety, was on his way to Chicago.
Said some point-man human op is there for the Decepticons!
Listen, if I know anything, I know this, that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.
My God.
We came here to find her in the middle of all that?
Are we really going out there, Epps?
I'm not going in there.
No one's going in.
I am.
With or without you, I'll find her.
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
You came all the way out here to get yourself killed? Huh?
Listen to what I'm saying.
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?
Listen, if you go in this building, that's if she's even still alive, there's no way you're gonna be able to reach her!
What do you suggest I do?
It's over.
I'm sorry, but it's over.
No.
Incoming!
We will kill them all.
Wreck ers, kill him!
This is going to hurt!
A lot!
Your leaders will now understand.
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.
And we needed them to believe we had gone.
For today, in the name of freedom, we take the battle to them!
- I saw your ship blow up!
- The ship?
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?
We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate.
Splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.
We ain't going nowhere.
Yeah, no one's exiling us.
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.
They're surrounding the city to make a fortress so that no one can see what they're up to inside.
Our only chance is the element of surprise.
I think I know where to look!
Mini-drone is on approach to Trump Tower.
You're telling me
Sam's headed into that?
Poor kid.
Probably never got close.
So, you can fly this thing, right?
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.
We're right behind you.
All right, we're going in!
The city is secure.
The humans cannot stop us.
As the afternoon falls, the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.
This is the victory I promised you so many years ago, where we rebuild Cybertron together!
I have deigned to work with you that our planet may survive!
I will never work for you!
You would be wise to remember the difference.
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.
Where is she?
Where is she?
You've got some balls.
No, Sam!
No! No, no!
Carly!
Carly!
Jump!
Bee, fire!
Bee!
Autobots! They're alive!
Decepticons, defend the pillar!
Raise the bridges! Find them!
Sam.
You found me.
I'd follow you anywhere.
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!
Well, you're crazy.
What is that? Is that us?
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.
Yeah, it's still got power.
Flight Control, do you copy?
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?
I think we got something.
Epps! We got Epps!
Come on, work! Work!
All right, turn the volume up on that!
The kid!
Can you rotate or something?
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.
Chicago is ground zero, do you understand?
- Can you hear us? You understand?
- Witwicky.
Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here and he has the pillars to his space bridge.
They're on top of a building on Chicago River.
It's owned by
Hotchkiss Gould Investments.
Now, the pillar that controls everything is in the southeast cupola.
You've got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar or they're going to transport
Cybertron here, do you understand?
- Do you understand?
- What?
Give me a G PS on the building and on that drone! Let's go!
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.
The southeast cupola.
All right!
We need to move before the fighters spot us.
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.
- Let's roll.
- Ratchet, cover high.
Hey, think we could use that rock et to shoot down the pillar?
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.
And it's across the river. Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneak up.
We only got one shot.
One shot's all we need.
We got to be able to see around that building from the ground.
Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area.
Maybe some are working.
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.
Listen up. You want to hit back?
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.
I can't promise anyone a ride home, but if you're with me, the world needs you now.
I'll find my own ride home, sir.
Who else?
General Morshower, requesting diversionary action to the south of the city.
We're coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreck ers, we need a diversion.
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.
Listen, we're gonna circle around to that glass building.
And we'll get high enough to make the rocket shot while you guys draw his fire.
- Let's move!
- Wait a minute!
I'm not letting you go out there without my urban combat prototypes.
- We got to go, Que!
- Come on.
They're great inventions for kicking ass!
What are these?
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.
Grapple gloves, for climbing.
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!
Move, move! Go, go, go!
- Move, move!
- Let's go!
Let's go! Run!
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- No, no, no!
- Where you going?
- Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!
You never leave a 'bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!
Go for the stairs!
Epps, this way!
Breaking right.
Bead. Rolling in.
We got another one coming around.
Coming around on the left side, coming around on the right side.
We're going to use Willis Tower for cover!
Once we make altitude, we jump!
- A lot of airplanes out here!
- Contact off the nose.
Mayday! I don't think he's gonna make it.
- Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.
- Heads up! Heads up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Tally on the left.
- Got him.
Here we go! Here we go!
Keep it tight!
Coming around.
All right, focus, focus, focus.
Threat above tower, six o'clock!
Locusts!
Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!
- Watch out, watch out!
- Holy shit!
Look out, look out, look out!
Get them out, get them out, get them out!
- Everybody out, out, out!
- Jump, jump, jump!
Get out, get out!
I'm stuck!
Now. Get them out now!
Get them out now!
Help!
Get separation.
Track away, track away!
Hard left! Hard left!
Six hundred feet.
Check your six! Check your six!
He's on our ass! Watch out, watch out!
Sharp right!
Building dead ahead!
Thread the needle!
Pull, pull!
- Come on, we're high enough!
- This is a mother getting up here!
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm coming.
Set up the rocket!
- They're coming.
- Weapons status?
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.
There, the building with the dome.
For our brothers, let's make this trip worth it.
Oh, God.
The building!
They're shooting at the building!
This is not a good idea.
- What?
- This is not a good idea.
- This building is unstable.
- Listen, stop for a second.
If we don't do what we came to do, it doesn't matter, we all die.
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!
I don't even care if the building collapses.
I'm having a heart attack anyway.
The building is going over!
- Hang on!
- Tak e cover!
Keep your hands up!
It's okay! It stopped!
Guys, look!
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!
Don't move.
Go, go.
Run!
Cover fire!
Shoot the glass! Jump out the window!
Jump!
We're gonna die!
Sam, I can't stop!
Shoot the glass!
Sam!
Is everybody okay?
You okay?
What the hell was that?
Driller-bot is thirsty.
- This evil thing's looking at me!
- What?
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!
We have to evac!
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
- We're trapped!
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!
Oh, Lord Jesus, let me just get out of this alive.
Move! We got to move!
Why do the Decepticons always get the good shit?
- Move!
- We're about to be eaten, people!
We're gonna die!
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!
- I'm swinging that way!
- Got her!
Oh, my God!
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!
Sam!
We gotta move!
I'm coming for you!
Optimus!
- Wreckers!
- We're coming!
Decepticons around the world, launch the pillars.
We are so lost!
Always left out.
Ka-ching!
It's time to lay down the law.
About to bring some hurt now.
It's starting! You see it?
Look out!
Where are Sam and Carly?
We'll go this way.
I give you one thing to do, one thing to do, and you drop the ball on that?
I ain't signed up for all this!
Got aliens blasting at me, running around, chasing me!
I'm ducking through churches and buildings and all that kind of crap!
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.
I'm trying to keep it together.
- What a treat! You and me, alone!
- Carly!
Come on, come on! Run!
Okay. He's after me, not you.
Run!
You can't hide, boy!
I just love it when your little insect feet try to run!
- Sam!
- Run!
I thought you were working for us, boy?
No! Sam!
My eye!
My eye!
Target the Decepticon!
Sam!
Please, you've got to save Sam!
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell is he doing?
This better work.
D-Bots! D-Bots!
I can't see! I can't see!
Sam!
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!
- I'm trying!
- Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...
You human scum!
- We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
- What bomb?
You see that bomb?
- Cut it, cut it, cut it!
- I got it!
How long do we have?
I'm gonna kick you!
Cut, cut, cut!
I'm gonna kill...
Well, he's dead.
Hey, Bee's going to run with the rest of the Autobots
- and meet us at the edge of the river.
- All right.
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!
This is a total cluster...
We got to get across the river.
You see that? She said the control pillar
- was in that first cupola.
- All right.
Let's go! Move! Let's move!
Tomahawks are inbound.
I'm in the traffic cameras.
Four Autobots are captured.
Oh, my God. We're helpless.
Whatever's set to happen, with those pulses getting faster, it's gonna happen soon.
No sign of Optimus.
How do we get these bridges down?
Spread out. Check in there.
Epps!
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?
Retirement is wack. Even worse, we can't get across the river to that building, and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.
Just pan the camera around, all right?
All right. Pan... Pan right. That's you.
Try getting into the bridge control room.
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can hack into the bridge.
Sir, SEALs are here.
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir, tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.
- How long?
- Fifteen.
- You're my prisoners!
- Take it easy. We surrender.
Get off me.
Get off me!
All right, you're gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto.
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.
All right, your target is up on top of that building, that cupola.
How doomed you are, Autobots.
You simply fail to understand that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Activating the bridge.
They happy about something.
We're in the heart of their ship.
Let's give 'em a little ride.
We gonna screw this ship up.
It's a 128K binary encryption code.
It's difficult.
But not for me. I'm in. Bridge down.
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!
Come on! Let's go!
"Pleasure working with you, Seymour."
I believe you're supposed to say.
Good job, Dutch.
Get off me!
Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!
Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?
Yes.
You need to teach them about respect.
This was all business, but now it's personal, do you understand me?
I understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.
- You, your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!
We surrendered! We're your prisoners.
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...
Why did you...
Good-bye, my old friend.
You're mine now.
Get off me!
- I got to help him.
- What?
What are you doing?
- I got to help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.
Turn around.
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.
We did it, Brains! We did it!
Rip this ship apart!
- We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!
Go! You guys, follow that ground team! Go!
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!
All right. Two snipers, right here!
All right, dock up!
We jump in three minutes!
Set up shop right here.
Set up.
I'm downstairs.
We got five targets and Shockwave right below us.
Stand by to jump!
All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.
Go!
Snipers, take out their eyes.
All right, demo team, let's crank steel.
Turning steel!
Don't fire till I tell you!
Go!
Good job, kid!
Fire!
- We got him!
- Yeah!
He's on the run!
Autobots, attack!
Mortar that bridge!
It's our world now!
Commence transport!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Optimus!
You die!
No!
Get down here, Sentinel!
Optimus, you forget your place!
I bring you Cybertron, your home, and still you choose humanity.
You were the one who taught me freedom is everyone's right.
I will retrigger that pillar!
Then you'll have to go through me!
Okay, I've got to try and help.
- I have to. You stay here.
- Don't you go. Don't go.
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.
Charge the pillar!
We got Autobots!
Reinforcements!
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!
We're taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!
First wave inbound.
We've got to cover for Optimus!
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!
Restart that pillar!
Trigger the pillars.
I can't hold them!
The ships have us pinned!
No!
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!
Positive surface contact.
- Target I. D.
- Target acquired.
- Dylan! Wait!
- No!
Dylan!
Stop! Stop!
No!
You can't do this, okay?
There's only one future for me.
Cybertron, you are saved, at last.
Have you come to surrender?
- Was it all worth it?
- Obviously.
All your work to bring Sentinel back and now clearly he has all the power.
It's actually almost tragic.
You dare lecture me, slave?
Your Decepticons finally conquering this planet, and yet, their leader won't be you!
It will be me! It will always be me.
In any minute now, you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.
Rock et!
Die!
You chose sides?
You chose wrong.
Always the bravest of us!
But you could never make the hard decisions!
Our planet will survive!
No!
We were gods once. All of us.
- But here...
- Please!
...there will only be one!
This is my planet!
I just saved a whole other world.
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?
No. I'm just a messenger.
The pillar's still connected!
Bring it up!
- Bee! Let's do this!
- Let's go, let's go! Move, move!
Pillar's still connected!
Rip that pillar down!
Now, we need a truce.
All I want is to be back in charge.
Besides, who would you be without me, Prime?
Time to find out.
Optimus, all I ever wanted was the survival of our race.
You must see why I had to betray you.
You didn't betray me.
You betrayed yourself.
No, Optimus!
Sam.
I love you.
You're the only thing
I need in this world, and I'll do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.
I'm going to hold you to that.
Just never let me go.
I promise.
Rings.
I love this car.
Bee, you've got to slow it down.
You got to slow way down, okay?
I'm just trying to help out.
In any war there are calms between storms.
You fought bravely.
There will be days when we lose faith.
Days when our allies turn against us.
But the day will never come that we forsake this planet and its people.
That's what I call the start of a beautiful future.
Arrest him.
It was worth it!
- Get him out of here!
- I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.
Come on, Charlotte, take me in right now!
Ever had one of those nights
that starts out like any other, but ends up being the best night of your life?
It was June the 22nd,
1990, our final day of school.
There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.
They called me The King.
Because my name's Gary King.
Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit of a player, but really, he was all mouth.
We called him O-Man
because he had a birthmark on his forehead that looked like a six.
He loved it.
Pete was the baby of the group.
He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang out with, but he was good for a laugh.
And he was absolutely minted.
Steve was a pretty cool guy. We jammed together, chased the girls.
I think he saw us as rivals.
Sweet, really.
And Andy.
Andy was my wingman.
The one guy I could rely on to back me up.
He loved me, and I'm not being funny, but I loved him, too.
There was nothing we were gonna miss about school.
Maybe Mr. Shepherd.
He was definitely one of the good guys.
He used to ask me what I wanted to do with my life,
I told him I just wanted to have a good time.
He thought that was funny.
It wasn't meant to be.
Not that night.
Newton Haven was our hometown.
Our playground, our universe.
And that night it was the site of a heroic quest.
The aim? To conquer
The Golden Mile.
Twelve pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic Indulgence.
There was The First Post,
The Old Familiar,
The Famous Cock, The Cross
Hands, The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed
Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,
The King's Head,
The Hole in the Wall...
All before reaching our destiny, The World's End.
We took my car into town.
I called it The Beast because she was pretty hairy.
And so, our journey into manhood began.
We were off.
We didn't waste any time.
We hit pub one and we hit it hard.
There was drinking, there was fun, there was controversy,
there were ladies, there were shots, there was drama,
and of course, there was drinking.
By pub five, we were feeling invincible
and decided to purchase some herbal refreshment
from a man we called
The Reverend Green.
Pint six put O-Man out of commission, so we carried on without him.
Good thing, I bumped into his sister in the next pub,
we went into the disableds and I bumped into her again.
Sam tagged along for a while, but then I had to let her go.
I had another date that night and her name was Amber.
Nine pints in and it was us against the world.
Things got mental in The Beehive,
so we repaired to the bowls club
or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck up.
Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him.
In the end, we blew off the last three pubs and headed for the hills.
I remember sitting up there,
blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes,
seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break
and knowing in my heart, life would never feel this good again.
And you know what?
It never did.
Thank you, Gary.
That was very enlightening.
Would anyone like to add anything or maybe challenge Gary?
Are you disappointed?
About what? That you didn't make it to The World's End?
No.
Just what is it that you want to do?
We want to be free!
We want to be free to do what we want to do!
And we want to get loaded. And we want to have a good time,
And that's what we're going to do.
We're going to have a good time.
We're going to have a party.
Just what is it that you want to do?
And we want to get loaded.
And we want to have a good time,
She's a beauty.
Yeah, but she's no Beast.
Hello, Peter.
Jesus! Gary?
The once and future King.
Were you outside my house this morning?
No.
I could have sworn
I saw you on my street.
I've never been to Bishop's Gardens.
How you doing, man?
I'm well. You?
Yeah, never better.
How is, uh...
Vanessa?
No. Your wife?
Vanessa.
Yeah. How's she?
She's good.
Have you had sex yet?
We have two children.
Ooh, twice. Get you, fuck machine.
We haven't changed, have we?
What is he doing here?
It's all right, Dad.
We're fine.
Hi, Mr. P.
So, Gary, how can I help you?
He looks well. Are you looking to buy a car?
Uh... No.
I'm afraid the end is nigh.
What?
The World's End.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. One night.
Five guys. Twelve pubs.
Let battle commence.
You want to try that again?
Yeah, isn't that something you've always wanted?
Not particularly. No.
Look. Peter.
We didn't make it before, but this time, we're gonna see it through to the bitter end.
Or lager end.
We?
Yeah, the whole gang.
Even Andy? Why wouldn't
Andy be coming?
Well, I thought that after the accident...
Notan issue. He's in.
What we wanna know is are you?
I'd have to check with Vanessa.
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.
Since when have you had to check with your wife?
Since we got married.
Oh, come on, man, don't you miss it?
The laughs, the camaraderie, the fights, the hangovers so fierce it feels like your head is full of ants.
Maybe the first two.
It begins.
What's your new number?
Same one I've had for 10 years.
Yeah. What's that one?
This entire row here, they'll all have dormer windows above the front elevation.
Who's the helmet without an helmet?
That's Gary King.
Knock, knock.
What are you doing here, Gary?
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"
I can see who's there.
It's you.
I like what you've done with the place. Bit draughty.
How's Selina?
We divorced 10 years ago.
Yeah, I know, just wondered how she was.
She's doing very well, apparently.
Have you got anyone else on the go?
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a fitness instructor. Twenty-six.
Pedophile. I'm kidding.
I'd love to meet her sometime.
No. Why are you here?
Haven't you heard? We're getting the band back together.
I'm not your bass player anymore.
No, I mean we're getting the boys back together.
We can get the band back together as well if you want.
No, we can't. You sold my guitar to buy drugs.
I've always wondered, what's that thing over the door called?
That's a lintel.
So, the plan is, we're going to go back to Newton Haven, we are gonna do The Golden Mile and this time, we are gonna make it to The World's End.
Everybody's in.
What, even Andy?
Oh, you better believe it, big balls.
Andy is going drinking with you?
With us.
Think about it, go back to the old town, sink a few pints...
Twelve pints.
Yeah.
Twelve pints is insane.
I know!
What is this all about, Gary?
It's about closure, you know.
Why should getting older affect something as important as friendship?
A let's changed since then, Oliver.
Right.
This is our chance to take stock.
A stock take?
You make it sound so much fun.
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that something you'd like?
What I'd really like is for you to take your DMs off the sofa.
Look. If you're worried about me, don't be. All right?
I'm here to tell you that Gary
King is back on the horse.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're back on the horse?
No, I mean
I'm back on the bike.
What is bike?
What do you mean?
What is bike slang for?
Bicycle.
I'm lost.
Don't be.
Okay.
Listen.
This is our chance to finally finish what we started.
Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!
I think we're all done.
So...
How do you like the property?
Yeah. It's amazing.
Amazing location.
Fantastic.
Fantastic aspects.
It's just... It's just a little bit out of our price range.
He'll knock some off for you.
What's it down for?
1.2 million.
Fuck off!
You have my card.
Gary, WTF?
It's good to see you, too, O-Man.
Please don't call me O-Man.
Sure.
Hey, how's your sister?
She's fine.
She talk about me?
No.
So, Friday, we'll all go down together.
Make a road trip of it,
I'll drive.
Don't think I can. I think I've got a doctor's appointment.
Yeah, you do.
With Dr. Ink!
You know, Dr. Ink?
Yeah. "Drink." I get it.
Come on. It wouldn't be the same without the O-Man.
Jesus.
You can see the guys, see how they're doing.
Tell them how you're doing.
You never know, you might make it to the end this time.
And Andy's definitely coming?
Yeah.
Andy Knightley?
Totes.
And you convinced him how?
Mr. Knightley.
Felicity.
You have a friend hereto see you.
No, I don't.
This is a bit grown up, isn't it?
Yup.
Saw the boys the other day.
Mmm-hmm.
O-Man, Stevie-Baby, the Petertron.
Yeah, I remember the names of our childhood friends, Gary.
We had ourselves a little idea.
Did you now?
Yeah. We're going to go back to Newton Haven.
Why? For some unfinished business.
That's a joke, right?
Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.
Sixty pints.
Steady on, you fucking alky.
I haven't had a drink for 16 years, Gary.
You must be thirsty then.
We can go back, see the guys, chew the fat, it'll be just like it always was, except this time we're going to finish this thing once and for all.
You have a very selective memory, Gary. Thanks.
You remember the Friday nights.
I remember the Monday mornings.
Yeah, that's why we're going back on a Friday.
Why do you think none of us live in Newton Haven anymore?
I don't know. Because it's a black hole.
It's boring.
It always was and it always will be.
It's only boring because we're not there.
It's pointless arguing with you.
Exactly. So come.
I'm picking everybody up from High
Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.
No, Gary.
Oh, God, why? Have you got to check with your missus?
No, actually, I don't have to check with my missus.
What are you doing?
I'm showing you the door.
Is it a door?
It doesn't have a lintel.
And it's glass. So is it a window or is it a dour?
Maybe it's a windoor.
You can have that.
Please leave, Gary.
All right. All right.
£600, wasn't it?
Oh, urn, I thought you should know.
What?
Mum died.
When?
Couple of weeks ago.
The big cancer.
I'm sorry.
She just always really liked you, you know.
Got me thinking about the old days.
Particularly that night, you know, because we were so happy.
And, you know, I love the boys like brothers, but when all's said and done, you're the best friend I ever had.
It was good to see you, mate.
Pete?
Steven. Thank God.
I had a horrible feeling I was going to be the only one here.
I reckon that's not the last horrible feeling you're gonna have today, mate.
This can't be happening.
Can it?
You said it. What the hell are we doing here?
What we always did.
Follow Gary King into almost certain oblivion.
Hello, Steven.
You all right, mate?
Pete. Hi, mate.
Didn't we decide to stop calling him
Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?
Old habits die hard.
They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.
No, they won't.
You know he'll outlive us all.
That's! be funny if it wasn't true.
Hang on a sec.
What?
I'm just trying to decide which of us is the biggest idiot for coming.
Maybe he had an accident.
Oh, sorry, Andy.
Sorry. No, no, no. It's fine.
I think Gary having an accident would actually be the best outcome for all of us, including Gary.
Unbelievable.
Oh, yes.
Look at these cunts.
You're late.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00.
It's almost 4:00.
Yeah, 3 for 4.
You know your problem, Gary?
You're never wrong.
How is that a problem?
I can't believe you bought another Granada Mark II.
What do you mean?
This looks exactly like the car I sold you in 1989.
This is the car you sold me in 1989.
Best 300 quid I ever spent.
This is The Beast?
Yeah.
Pretty much. I mean, she's had a bit of work done.
I had to replace the brakes, suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels, paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.
Other than that, she's the same old motor.
You could almost say an antique.
Well, then let's get this antique on the roadshow.
Come on, you bellends.
We're going to be late.
And we're back.
Just like the Five Musketeers.
Three Musketeers, isn't it?
Four if you count D'Artagnan,
Well, nobody knows how many there were, really, do they, Pete?
I mean, history's a sketchbook.
You do know that The Three
Musketeers is a fiction, right?
Written by Alexandre Dumas?
A lot of people are saying that about the Bible these days.
What, that it was written by
Alexandre Dumas?
Don't be daft, Steve, it was written by Jesus.
Oh. Anyway, five sounds much better.
I think they missed a trick only having three.
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've died and they'd still have three left.
Are we there yet?
Let's do this!
Soup Dragons!
I remember this one.
I put this on a tape for you, didn't I?
Yeah, this is it.
This is the tape?
Yeah, yeah! Look, look.
Where did you find it?
It was in the tape player.
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?
I need a piss actually.
This is a long piss.
If it is a piss.
Might be a little...
Poo.
How is that a poo?
Still work for your old man, Pete?
Yeah. I'm a partner now.
You?
Yeah, started my own firm in '98.
Got bought out in '05.
I'm happier, though.
It's less stress.
Ollie?
Property.
I co-manage a boutique estate agency in North London.
Very competitive.
Is it family law you're in, Andy?
Corporate.
Does anyone know what Gary's doing?
He's playing Need For Speed.
Over there.
Come on, come on, come on!
He hasn't changed, has he?
I don't know. He did finally pay me back that £600.
Really? He borrowed £200 off me.
And me.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you'd do that!
Oh! Of course I can.
It's just robbing
Peter to pay Paul.
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you.
I still owe Paul.
Oh, shit.
Newton Haven.
Take a moment to look upon it in its original colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red.
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Oh, no, it's okay,
I did it all in the services.
Know why I pulled you over, sir?
Was the music too loud?
Your left brake light is faulty.
Oh!
The old brake lights! So called because they're always breaking.
I'll get that sorted out,
Officer.
Can I see your license, sir?
Yup.
Ah!
You know what?
It's in my wallet.
And I left that at the bloody gym!
Any other form of identification?
No, it's all in my sports bag.
That's bloody typical, isn't it? Um...
I'll give you my name and address, you can run me through the old system.
Go on then.
It's Peter Page.
48 Bishop's Gardens,
London, N2 T12.
Jesus, Gary! WTF? Why did you give him my name?
I'm not gonna give him my name, am I?
Suppose I get done by the police?
You won't get done by the police.
Gary, he will check the number plate against his name!
I know. Why do you think
I gave him Pete's name?
Jesus Christ, Gary, I own a car showroom.
I am a junior partner.
This is...
Just trust me.
So, Mr. Page, what brings you to Newton Haven?
Well, we're all from here. We're just back to see the sights.
Have a crack at the old Golden Mile.
Might get a bit messy.
Well, you make sure you get that brake light fixed and you might want to do an emissions test, too.
Oh, and, Peter.
Don't make too much mess.
We won't!
Hmm.
I don't understand.
It's simple, Pete.
The car's still registered to you, it has been since 1989.
But I've moved three times since then.
I know, I changed the log book.
Where do you think all those points came from?
Jesus. You guys need to relax.
Do you know how much trouble you could get into?
Do you know how much trouble I'm already in?
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey. What the hell is this?
Why are we even here?
We are here to get annihilated.
Have you got any plans for dinner at all?
Tonight, we will be partaking of a liquid repast as we wend our way up The Golden Mile.
Commencing with an inaugural tankard at The First Post, then onto The Old Familiar, The
Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,
The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant,
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid,
The Beehive, The King's Head and The Hole in the Wall for a measure of the same.
All before the last bittersweet pint in that most fateful terminus,
The World's End.
Leave a light on, good lady, for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes, we will, in truth, be blind drunk.
Come on!
Until 1840...
Fucking hell.
...this building was the site of
Newton Haven's first post office.
Until an enterprising business fellow decided that far from befitting the sending and receiving of mail it was perhaps better suited as a humble taproom where a weary traveler might get Matted.
Come on.
Ah!
It's like déjà vu.
I don't remember this at all.
Has it been refurbished?
Been bought by a chain, hasn't it?
Part of that nationwide initiative to rob small, charming pubs of any discernible character.
Starbucking, man.
It's happening everywhere.
Can't take away that smell, though.
I'm sure they tried.
Good evening, Raymondo. The prodigal sons return. Eh?
Who's on the guest list tonight?
Come again?
The guest ales.
We, sir, are doing The
Golden Mile and you have the honor of drawing first blood.
What do you recommend? There's one.
Crowning Glory.
Rather fitting.
How's that?
I'm Gary King.
What?
So tell me more.
About what?
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty?
Is it foamy? Is it happy?
Does it have a surprisingly fruity note which lingers on the tongue?
Hmm. It's beer.
Hmm.
We'll have five of those, please.
No. Sorry. Can we have four of those and a tap water, please?
What?
I don't believe this, a man of your legendary prowess drinking fucking rain.
It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.
That doesn't make any sense. I know it doesn't make any sense.
You seriously have a problem with me not drinking, after what happened?
I don't, but King Arthur does!
Oh, this'll be good.
What's King Arthur got to do with it?
Do you honestly think that King Arthur came back from the Battle of Hastings, fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...
Camelot.
...walked up to the bar and went,
"Hello.
Could I have a tap water?"
No, because they didn't have running water in Arthurian times.
Exactly. He would have had a mead.
The King Arthur of beers.
And I'm less of a man because
I choose to drink water?
Well, it's a bit
"ooh ducky", innit?
That's not very PC, Gary.
Get out of the '90s, Pete.
There's nothing "ooh ducky" about being teetotal, about walking into a pub after a rugby match and ordering a tap water at a bar packed full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.
That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah?
I'm talking balls.
You said it, poof.
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.
And God forbid you ever have children, because if...
I might have kids.
Then you had better be ready to take responsibility...
No. I mean I might have kids.
You remember Karen
Eggerton, who I fucked?
She was two weeks late when her parents emigrated to Normandy.
I never heard from her again.
She might have had a baby.
Imagine that? A French kid.
It's pointless arguing with you.
To kids.
Wherever they may be.
Kids.
Kids.
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.
"Boo-Boo".
What is that?
You remember,
"Let's Boo-Boo."
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's classroom, it said on the wall,
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you know, from that Shakespeare play?
A Winter's Tale.
Yeah. What was it called?
A Winter's Tale.
That's it.
And if we needed to make a quick getaway, we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear," and then it was,
"Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear," and then it was just,
"Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo," and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."
So you're saying we should go?
Yeah. it's shit here, innit?
Ah!
The Old Familiar.
Now this is a pub.
Yes.
This is more like it.
Like déjà vu.
David, my man, have you heard the news?
Gary King is back in town.
Who's he?
How was the funeral, Gary?
Your mum's funeral?
It's difficult to put into words.
But if I had to choose three, I would say,
"Really, really sad."
Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?
How about, "Really, very sad"?
It's a shame, she was a good woman.
I really liked your mum.
Me, too, mate. Me, too.
Hello.
Hello, mate.
Are you here?
Yeah, I've been here for ages.
What are you talking about?
You get lost on the ring road again?
This is Newton Haven.
What time are you meeting The Twins?
Twins?
We're all at The Old Familiar.
Come by if you want.
Yeah, he is. Okay.
See you soon.
Who was that, O-Man?
Don't call me O-Man, Gary.
If you must know it was Sam.
Sam's here?
Sam's here?
Is there a fucking echo in here?
Yes, Sam's here.
She's down from Manchester. We're driving to Mum's tomorrow.
What, and she's coming here?
Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.
Jesus Christ, not this again.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I saw her first.
You really have a selective memory, don't you?
Somebody else was saying that.
Me. No. I would have remembered.
I told you I had a thing about Sam and you proceeded to try and get in her pants at every opportunity.
Guys, please.
You only liked her after you found out I liked her!
That's right, because you did the school play.
Cabaret. Cabaret.
Because she was in it.
And she wore those fishnet stockings and you got a big boner on stage.
Jesus Christ.
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.
I hated that prick.
Can we not talk about my sister in relation to,
A, massive wide ons,
B, Steven's erect penis?
All right.
Is she still fit, though?
I'm not answering that.
Is she, though?
Am I what?
Fit.
Hello, Sam. Steven? You've grown, haven't you?
Yeah, sideways.
You look fantastic.
Steroids.
Andy, longtime.
Hi, Pete.
Hi, Sam.
All right, big brother?
Gary.
Willkommen. Bienvenue.
Welcome.
Sam. Would you like a drink?
Hey, Steve. She's just got here.
Come on.
Sam. Would you like a drink?
I'll have a vodka tonic, thanks, Steven. Sure.
I'm just going to nip to the loo.
Cool.
Nature calls.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm going to the toilet.
Well, then, so am I.
Gary! You are out of your mind!
What are you talking about?
You gave me the sign.
What sign?
You went to the toilet.
Gary, are you serious? I haven't seen you in 20 years.
Do you really think I'm going to have sex with you in the ladies' toilet?
Well, the disableds is out of order.
Gary. What happened?
I don't know, maybe one of them put too many paper towels down the toilet.
I mean, we don't know what they are thinking, really, do we?
No. What happened to you?
Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.
I'm the same old Gary.
No shit.
Huh!
So, do you wanna?
Oliver. I'll see you later.
You're going?
I thought you weren't meeting The
Twins for another half hour?
I'm not. Oh, yeah.
I believe this is yours.
"Out of order."
It's a private joke.
I don't want to know.
- What is that?
- Modern art.
It's a memorial, isn't it?
Yeah. To modern art.
Hey. guys, do you know what time it is?
It's not even 6:00.
Wrong! it's high time we got onto The Cock!
Whoo-hoo!
Let's go.
Come on.
When you're ready, mate.
Oh, shit.
Look who it is.
Basil. Mad Basil!
Do you remember?
We used to come in here and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs and lizard people and underwater Nazis.
Didn't he spout some bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle actually being a square?
No, he said it was two isosceles triangles forming a rhombus.
He was your best mate, wasn't he, Steve?
No, he wasn't my best mate, Gary.
He was a lonely, old guy and
I felt a bit sorry for him.
That's right. Basil!
Maybe we're not the local legends you think we are.
Gary King?
Speak for yourself, mate.
You're barred.
I cannot fucking believe this.
This is ridiculous.
Believe me, Gary, it's not worth it.
Have two in the next one. Have them all in the next one, for all I care.
We've got to have one in every pub otherwise the whole thing's fucked.
I'd say it was fairly fucked already, mate.
Great.
How much more of this do we have to endure?
That was three. There's nine more.
Oh, good.
Fuck that.
I need to eat something.
We can get some food in the next pub.
As long as it's reasonably healthy.
This is Newton Haven.
Hardly the heart of the organic revolution.
I doubt it's the heart of anything.
My wife wanted us to go organic, problem is, I kinda like eating shit.
The next pub does shit!
Keep up!
Oh, yeah.
I remember this one.
- We had New Year's in here, didn't we?
- '89 into '90.
Isn't that when you slept on the pool table, Andy?
Yeah. I believe it was.
For six hours.
Six hours.
Thank you for reminding me.
Do you remember when you woke up, we said you'd been asleep for a year and that it was 1991 and you freaked out and punched a clock?
That was a great night.
Didn't you manage to get off with Erika Leekes, Peter?
Yes, I did. Something of a personal triumph, if I say so myself.
She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?
Marmalade Sandwich...
The very same.
Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson,
Becky Salt.
Two blondes and a redhead in the middle.
The Marmalade Sandwich.
Becky Salt. Fucking hell.
Wonder what they're doing now.
Why don't you ask them?
What do you mean?
I mean, sitting at that table over there are two blondes and a redhead in the middle.
Shut the fuck up.
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the left, Tracy Benson on the right, and by process of elimination, there's Becky Salt in the middle.
That's the Marmalade Sandwich all growed up.
That is very spooky.
We should get them over.
No.
Leave the past where it is.
It's bad enough having to look at your old, ugly mugs.
You make it sound like we're fucking ancient.
We haven't changed that much.
I mean, sure, Steve's let himself go a bit. What?
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver has still got his mark of the devil.
No, he hasn't No, he hasn't.
It's called laser surgery, Gary.
It's a small price to pay for not being called fucking O-Man.
That works for Sisters of
Mercy tattoos as well.
I still like the
Sisters Of Mercy.
Well, good job, or you'd never go swimming.
I'm lost.
Don't be.
Well, I for one, think it's nice to see the old faces again.
Cheers, mate.
Excuse me? This taken?
Is this seat taken?
Have it, mate.
Thanks.
Wasn't that...
Shane Hawkins.
Hey, didn't he...
Yes, he did.
Hang on. What happened with Shane Hawkins again?
I'd rather not bring it all up again, if that's okay.
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.
Bottling up past trauma can lead to inadequate coping strategies in later life, apparently.
I don't know, I mean, it's not even about the past, you know.
It's not about the fact that he bullied me, that he made me miss more school days than chicken pox.
It's not even that he forced me to spend entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle, or that he punched me so hard he dislodged my eyeball.
And it's not even that he ruined a large portion of my childhood.
No, it's the fact that just then, he didn't recognize me.
He looked straight through me like it all meant nothing.
That probably sounds weird, doesn't it?
Shots!
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.
What are you doing, Gary?
I thought it was obvious.
Shots.
Firstly, Peter was talking about something which clearly made him feel very uncomfortable.
It's all right, Andy.
No, Peter, it's not all right.
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough, and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!
But shots don't count, do they?
You said you wanted to catch up and chew the fat.
I think you just wanted to drink it.
We're not here as your friends.
We're just your fucking enablers.
Enablers. That's a funny word, isn't it?
"Enabler."
Gary King And The Enablers.
That's a good name for a band, Steve.
Write that down.
Don't do a Gary, Gary.
Oh, is that a thing now, is it?
It's always been a thing.
You don't need us to help you get fucked up, you've done a perfectly good job so far on your own.
I'm gonna go and see if there's a bus back to London if anyone wants to come with me.
You can't go. This is special.
This is our anniversary.
It's not the anniversary, Gary.
We did this in June.
It's October.
Yeah, but it's the anniversary of the year, isn't it?
Every year is the anniversary of a year!
It's just not the same anymore, Gary, and it's not that the town's changed, we have changed.
Yeah, well, you can't go,
'cause the buses are finished.
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B.
You coming?
I could do with an early one actually.
I should probably go and find Sam.
Yeah, I'm gonna go and find Sam with Oliver.
That's settled then, yeah?
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars and your wives and your job security.
But you don't have what I have. Freedom.
You're all slaves and I'm free to do what I want any old time.
And this is what you want?
You should grow up, mate.
Join society.
Yeah, but Mum died.
And we're all very sorry, but now it's time to go home.
I thought we were home.
I can't help feeling sorry for him.
Don't.
Oh! Fuck! Piss!
Careful, the floors a bit pissy.
Wasn't me.
That was me.
Did that back in '90.
Punched the shit out of the wall.
I don't know why. Seemed important at the time.
You guys look like you're having a good night, though.
I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight.
You want to tag along?
We'll be like The Six Musketeers.
I said we're doing
The Golden Mile.
You think you're so cool, don't you?
Huh?
But we were cooler.
We owned this town.
We paved the way for you lot.
Blazed a trail.
Hey! Look at me when
I'm talking to you!
Please don't.
Don't what?
You don't want to do that.
Don't I?
What?
You need to explain this right now!
Andy, this kid just attacked me.
Don't you dare change the subject!
He smashed my head in the mirror.
You know who I just spoke to?
Your mum!
And not from the afterlife.
From fucking Bournemouth.
Is that real?
She says she hasn't spoken to you for eight months.
Andy...
His head just came off!
No, Gary, you are not gonna wriggle out of it this time.
There's someone in here.
Andy, did you see...
WTF, Gary. WTF.
What the fuck does "WTF" mean?
What the fuck?
Oh, yeah.
This can't be happening.
Can it?
You said it, mate.
I can't believe it.
I know, mate.
I can't believe you lied about your mum!
That was a white lie!
How is that a white lie?
She's not dead, is she?
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?
To get help.
No, don't do that!
What, don't get help? We don't know how far this goes.
Wait, who are you calling?
Vanessa.
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.
Why are you calling your wife?
Because she's my wife.
You just said we don't know how far this goes.
I was just thinking about the pub.
Oh, well, there's a surprise.
I can't get through.
Can you get through to Sam?
I've got full bars and
I'm not getting through.
I'm sorry, your call cannot be connected at this time.
Must be the network.
Holy shit.
This is all connected.
This explains why everything's gone fuck up.
Everybody's been replaced by one of these.
That's why no one recognized us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.
I thought it was weird'
Shane Hawkins.
Exactly. it's not us that's changed, it's the town.
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?
Andy, aren't I right?
You're never wrong.
No, whatever the fuck's happening, we can't stay in the gents forever.
Ten people have entered this toilet in the last five minutes and not a single one has come back out again.
That's going to look suspicious.
Gay loving.
And that's worse than five dismembered bodies?
This is Newton Haven.
How's it looking?
Normal. Very normal.
I don't like it.
What do we do?
Let's finish our drinks.
I say we neck these and get the fuck out of here.
To London?
To The Trusty Servant.
Are you fucking kidding?
Oh, yeah.
It's The Good Companions next.
I always mix those two up.
Are you saying we move on to the next pub?
We should get in The Beast and head back to London!
My brake light is broken.
So don't use the brakes!
I'm way over the limit. When has that ever stopped you?
I don't want to put any more points on Pete's license.
Andy can drive, he's teetotal!
Ah!
That's settles it then.
The last thing we need to do is get pulled over by the police.
A, we're all drunk,
B, they might be in on it and,
C, we've got blood on our hands.
It's more like ink. We've got ink on our hands.
So, has it got messy yet? What?
What are you, five pubs in?
Four.
Oh, not even halfway.
Plenty more fun to be had.
Enjoy your night, Peter.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry.
The way I see it, we've told everybody we were doing The Golden Mile.
You did.
If we suddenly jump in The Beast now and head for the hills, they're gonna know that we know, but if we keep doing what we're doing and going where we're going, then they're not gonna know.
Know what?
That we know.
I suggest we finish what we started and leave quietly in the morning.
Wait. You're really suggesting...
We finish The Golden Mile.
It's pointless arguing with him.
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.
We're just five friends
on a night out, having a good time.
Drinking.
Ah!
Beer.
Pubs.
Shall we?
I feel a little uncomfortable drinking this much.
It's like Dutch courage, isn't it?
You know, when the English soldiers used to drink Dutch gin before battle to give them super strength.
You know, I thought that was to numb the sense of impending doom.
Exactly.
We're just five friends on a night out, having a good time.
I need the toilet.
Go on then. You've earned it.
Huh?
You're doing really good, Oliver.
He didn't make it this far last time.
I'm proud of him.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Yeah, five guys on a night out, having a great time.
Pretending to have a great time.
Are you pretending?
If we get out of here alive,
I'm going to kill you.
We're still in the dark, Gary.
Yeah, our families could be in danger for all we know.
I know, my mum could be dead.
For reals this time.
Hey, why don't we just ask somebody? Who?
The Reverend Green.
Come on. Wait.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm going to go and have a little chat with The Reverend Green.
You're going to buy drugs?
I am going to go over there and subtly check if that is The Reverend Green and if it is, I can ask him what's going on, and possibly buy some drugs.
But what if he's one of them?
No, me and The Reverend had a highly sophisticated code when discussing the purchase of herbal narcotics.
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's one of them and I will simply walk away.
Ah!
Have you got any drugs? I don't do that anymore, Gary.
Do what?
That.
That why you're in a suit, is it?
'Cause drug dealing is not good enough for you?
There are no drug dealers anymore, Gary.
I've got a proper job in a proper office.
You had a proper office.
That was the gents' toilets.
Nothing wrong with doing your business in the toilet.
Look, a lot has changed since you have left. I know.
How much do you know?
A little.
How much is a little?
The town has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff.
Shh. Keep your voice down.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
Tell us then.
Well, they're not robots.
Do you even know what robot means?
Course I do. It's like,
"Hello, I am a robot."
It means "slave" and believe me, they are not slaves.
Are you their prisoner?
No, I am very happy.
Tell your face.
Hey! What's going on?
The town's been invaded by robots who aren't robots and The Rev's their prisoner.
I am not.
We're leaving first thing.
We can get you out of here.
I'm not going. It's not what you think.
This is for all our benefit.
You've said too much, Trevor.
Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor.
I'm just trying to help.
It's not your place to help.
They will have everything in hand.
Are you guys robots?
Well, the word robot actually comes from an old Czech word...
...robotnik...
...meaning slave.
And we are not slaves.
We are very, very happy.
And not robots.
Oh, my God, are these guys robots?
Shut up about robots!
I say we shut up about everything!
Trevor.
It's your supervisor.
Hello, Trevor.
Hello, sir.
But...
I understand.
Thanks a bunch.
What did I miss?
Your friends trying to help.
We don't need your help.
Well, what should we do?
I suggest you get on your way.
I think we should do what he says.
Okay.
Here we go.
Come on!
Gary.
Gary!
Let's just get in and out of this one, yeah?
No more making new friends.
Gentlemen!
The prodigal sons return!
What will it be, one of our guest ales perchance?
Might I recommend five pints of Crowning Glory?
Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?
What? Sorry. What?
It's a delightful brew.
Hoppy, nutty, foamy,
Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue?
You're obviously a connoisseur.
Then you'll already know that it's a rare treat for rogues, reverends, royalty and all good folks between.
Five of those, please.
Welcome home, boys.
I don't remember him being that friendly.
He's obviously one of them.
How can he be?
He remembered me.
We don't know what they remember.
Maybe they have selective memories.
Yeah, like what's his name?
Me.
Maybe he's one of the others.
Like The Reverend.
It is very hard to tell, isn't it?
Yeah, I mean, is he one of them or is he one of them?
Wait, wait, which ones are the thems again?
Well, they're both thems, aren't they?
But there's two ways of saying it.
Is he one of them or is he one of them?
We need different terms.
One for the people who aren't robots and one for the robots who aren't robots.
All right, we need to be able to differentiate between them, them and us.
Yeah, I think the pronouns are really confusing.
Yes. I don't even know what a pronoun is.
It's a word that can function by itself as a noun which refers to something else in the discourse.
I don't get it.
You just used one.
Did I?
Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.
What is?
It.
Is it?
Christ.
Look, we just need a fucking word so we can identify who's who.
He's a blank, she's a blank, those two people are definitely blanks.
Sam.
I got this, Steve.
All right, Sam?
Oh, crumbs.
How's your night going?
Good. Sort of.
What do you mean "sort of"?
Well, it's weird, isn't it?
You come back and everything's the same, but sort of different.
Different how?
Just weird.
How weird?
What are you getting at, Gary?
Come with me.
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.
It's all right, I'm not trying to have sex with you.
Why are we in the disabled toilets then?
There's something I need to tell you right now, unless you do want to have sex, in which case
I'll tell you afterwards.
Tell me right now.
Have you noticed anything creepy about The Twins apart from the fact that they're twins?
Just because they're twins doesn't automatically make them creepy.
It does a little bit.
You had sex with them.
A, I did not, and, B, how did you know about that?
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not stupid and, C, they told me.
Right. Well, I did once, but I was wasted, which was creepy because it was like there was four of them.
I am not proud of it.
I am a bit.
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
No, this is...
Are you okay, Sam?
Are you okay, Sam?
I need a cigarette.
Nobots?
How about Fauxbots?
I think we should get away from the whole robots thing.
Steven?
What's he up to?
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just trying to fuck Oliver's sister.
Andy.
Oh, my God, that man is full of shit.
I know that's not a surprise to you.
What did he say, Sam?
What did he say, Sam?
He said that Newton Haven has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff and if we don't do what they say, they will make us their prisoners.
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?
No, of course not.
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?
What?
See?
Come on, Sam.
You know better than to believe Gary King,
Oh, crumbs.
Sam!
God!
You creepy bitches, get off!
Chuck us a ciggie.
Oh.
Gary, what's happening?
I told you in the disableds.
Oh, yes, you did.
We should get inside, eh?
Otherwise people are going to ask what the hell's going on.
What the hell's going on?
Steve, I got this.
Got what?
Sam, he's not good enough for you.
What?
What?
We've been through some crazy shit tonight and it's really put things in perspective for me, and if everything is as fucked up as it seems, then there's something I need to tell you.
You might think this is because
I've had seven pints, but it's not.
It's not.
I'm in love with you, Sam.
I always have been, and it breaks my heart to see you waste your affections on Gary fucking King.
Hey, that's a bit harsh. Oh, no, you've got it all wrong.
There's nothing between...
And while I'm being honest, just to lay it all out there, I am currently seeing a fitness instructor.
She's 26 years old, but I would drop her in a heartbeat if it meant that I had one last chance with you.
Steven, there's nothing between me and Gary King.
Oh, fuck.
Sorry.
Hey! Get your feet off her!
Pop its head off! Pop its head off like an aspirin bottle.
Blue-bloods?
Nothing suggested in the last three minutes has been better than
Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.
Nothing.
What the hell's going on?
Did you guys think of a name for the robots who aren't robots?
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.
Well, we just had a barney with two blanks in the beer garden.
- We have to leave now!
- Agreed.
Let's hit The Mermaid.
Wait, what?
Number eight.
"Number eight"?
Oh, fuck.
Andy, what's happening?
Gary thinks we should keep on with the crawl because they know what we're doing, but they don't know that we know what they're doing.
And basically no one else has a better idea, so fuck it.
What?
Wait!
Guys! Guys!
I've got a better idea.
I'm parked right round here somewhere.
Haul it. Just go!
Steven, tell them!
Gary said they'll get us if we try and leave now.
We're way past leaving now.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
This is what the kids want.
This is a bit mad, isn't it?
This is perfect. We can hide out in here.
I'll get the drinks in.
Good plan, O-Man.
Hey!
Keep an eye out for blanks.
You've got it.
Why didn't you say anything?
About what?
About what you said in the garden.
I always wanted to.
It just never seemed like the right moment.
Something always got in the way.
Here you go, get these down you.
Thanks.
Steven?
Please! I have so much to live for!
It's me, you numpty.
Basil!
I knew seeing your faces again would spell trouble.
Wait. How do I know it's really you?
Because I'm the only one who's going to tell you the truth about Newton Haven.
Now, do you recall the events of the evening of June the 22nd, 1990?
No, but I know a man who does.
Here you go.
Hey.
See anyone we know?
The Marmalade Sandwich.
The Marmalade Sandwich.
They look good.
It's the lights.
It's the drink.
Who cares what it is?
Steven?
Steven?
That was the night they arrived.
Remember the shooting star?
That was them.
Nothing happened at first.
They were getting ready, burrowing in underground, preparing.
Not long after you lot left, people started to change.
Just one or two at first, then more.
They replaced people of influence, taking over the institutions,
remaking, remodeling, refurbishing.
Doing everything they could to make us join them.
I can't find Steven.
Where are the others?
They're blending in.
Oh, crumbs.
It's not like the replacements were evil, far from it.
People got a lot friendlier.
That's how they do it,
It's not an invasion, it's a merger.
They don't want to get rid of us, not if they can help it.
They just want to make us more like them.
Change the way we think.
Bring us into line with all the others.
Become another link in their chain.
Which is fine, unless you say no.
That's when you get replaced.
Once they get your DNA, they've got you.
How do they do that?
Any way they like.
Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat, kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.
Why do you think
I drink with this crazy straw?
Not so crazy now, is it?
If you're not on their side, they'll create a version that is.
They can bring you back exactly the same or even make you young again.
It looks like you, it even has your memories,
but really it's just a vessel to spread their message.
Trust, love, respect, desire.
Replaced in the name of progress.
So, what happens to the people who get replaced?
The empties? Don't ask me what happens to them.
Why, what happens to the empties?
I told you not to ask me that!
Go! Get out, before it's too late!
Basil?
I said go!
This just can't be good.
Sam, who was the boy that you liked in sixth form? Adrian?
Adrian Keane. Why?
He's over there.
Hey, Sam.
How's life?
Sam, we have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!
Where are the others?
They're blending in.
Oh, fuck!
Gary! No, just one more song.
Gary, she's a blank!
Don't be so judgmental.
Oh, for fuck...
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Still got it.
Enough's enough.
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Hold up.
Where are you all going?
We're leaving.
Really? What happened?
Adrian Keane was in that bar.
Prick.
I thought you liked
Adrian Keane.
Adrian Keane is dead.
Oh, God.
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike accident in Italy eight years ago.
Did he? They must have had his DNA on file.
That's how they were able to replicate him.
They know how to get to us, man.
They know everything.
They didn't know Adrian was dead.
They knew enough to tempt us.
They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform.
Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?
Fuck, yeah.
We've gotta get out of town, we've gotta get beyond it before it's too late.
- Where are you getting all this from?
- Basil.
Mad Basil? He of the Bermuda
Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis?
Another good name for the band, Steve.
You're putting our lives in the hands of a crazy old man?
He's not crazy!
No, maybe he's not.
Or maybe he's a blank trying to lure us to the edge of town, onto those dark country roads where they can deal with us.
Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.
I hate fields.
Yes. My thoughts precisely.
Steven's right.
We should go.
No, we're going to The Beehive.
Gary's plan is still the best we have.
Wait a minute.
The 1990-model Oliver was out of commission by this point in the evening.
What are you saying?
I like the new you.
Huh.
Come on.
This is a mistake, isn't it?
Hold up!
Just stick with me.
Andy, come on!
Here we go. Pub number nine.
Fuck yes!
That's the spirit, Pete!
Spirits! We should do chasers.
Who is this guy?
Come on. Andy!
It can't start without you.
You what?
We can't start without you.
Now then.
Whose round is it?
It's mine.
Mr. Shepherd!
Is it Mr. Shepherd?
Why don't you kids join me? You look like you could do with a drink.
Now, let's have a little chat about your future, shall we, hmm?
Uh, Mr. Shepherd?
Please, call me Guy.
All right.
Guy...
Look at you.
Are you a robot?
Does anyone know what robot means?
Yeah. I do!
Yes, Gary.
It means "slave."
Oh, very good, Gary.
Are you a robot, sir?
No, Peter, of course
I'm not a robot.
Sir?
Yes, Steven.
But you're on their side, though?
This is not about sides, Steven.
It's not about shirts versus skins.
It's about working together as one team.
I know it may seem a bit weird and a little bit scary, but please believe me, it's quite the opposite,
They're here to help.
To straighten us out. To prepare us for the big league.
They've seen something in us, a potential.
There's a vast community of worlds up there, living together, peacefully, cooperatively.
And guess what? They want us along for the ride.
Pretty cool, eh, gang?
So, they're not here to harm us?
Far from it, O-Man.
No, they're here to help.
I'm not saying they're afraid to get tough.
I certainly had to get tough with you in my day.
And what one amongst you wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?
In some respects, they're a lot like teachers.
Stern, yes.
A little frightening.
But it's all for our betterment.
So, what do you say we all go somewhere and talk about this properly?
That wasn't properly?
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what
Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...
Andy! What the fuck?
Yes, Andy. What the fuck?
Humans, you leave us no recourse.
If you will not join us willingly, we will be forced to use other means of persuasion.
Now, please...
I fucking hate this town!
Oh, oh!
Oh, crumbs, you're heavy. Sorry.
Motherfucker!
Andy!
Twist the melon, man!
Yeah!
Sam, this is no way for a family to behave.
Sam, I'm disappointed in you.
O-Man!
Okay, Andy.
Break it up.
It doesn't have to be like this.
It could be so much simpler, so completely painless.
If only you'd see the light.
Yes.
See, it's not about conflict, it's about togetherness.
Yes. Let's try this again, shall we?
How about another round?
Nah, we're done here.
Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.
The Smokehouse!
What?
Just do it!
Come on!
This way!
Humans, this is your final warning.
Failure to comply will result in your...
Humans, obey now, or face the consequences.
Let's go!
Shit.
Oh, look, there's my car!
Let's climb down the drainpipe.
I've got a better idea.
Climb down the drainpipe.
Okay, just go.
Wait. What about the others?
Leave 'em with me, okay?
I got this.
Are you sure? Yeah, I always land on my feet.
I don't know if that's true, Gary.
Just go.
Will you find out what happened to my brother?
Yeah, of course, of course, and
I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?
He's a good guy.
He's better than me.
Gary, you're not a bad person, but you're not boyfriend material.
The whole "free spirit quick one in the disabled toilets" thing is kinda cool when you're 17, but not when you're facing 40.
There comes a time when you have to go forwards and not backwards.
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that night, things would all be different.
It's not all about that night, Gary.
Isn't it?
It doesn't have to be.
We'll always have the disableds, though, won't we?
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always have the disableds.
Oh, no.
Where's Sam?
I put her in her car.
You did what?
I put her in her car.
I just told her to leave.
You just sent away the only one of us sober enough to drive?
Yeah. You just couldn't stand the fact that she might prefer me to you.
That's not true.
It is true, Gary!
I was getting somewhere.
We held hands.
I was just trying to help! You were trying to help yourself, more like!
Jesus, I do something right for a change and you fuckers get on my case.
Wow, that's the first time I've ever heard you admit being wrong.
I said I did something right!
Yeah, "for a change".
So? Meaning the rest of the time you're wrong.
Not necessarily.
Look, I just thought it was best to keep her out of harm's way.
And what about us, Gary?
Aren't we in harm's way?
We're all right, Pete. Come on, we're The Five Musketeers.
No, we're the Four Musketeers.
Wait, how do we know you put her in the car?
How do we know you're you?
Of course I'm me!
Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?
I'm Gary King.
There's only one Gary King. How do I know you guys are you?
We've been together the whole time.
You might all not be you. How did you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?
Because his birthmark was back.
What does that prove?
Because of what Basil said.
They make a copy from your DNA.
That's why he had his birthmark.
He was new, like a baby.
Like a man-baby.
Like a "maybe".
Oliver with none of the shit that had happened to the real Oliver.
The laser surgery!
So the blanks really are just blank?
No wear and tear, no scars.
Steven, in 1987 we were playing cricket and I accidentally pushed you onto a broken bottle that nearly went up your ass.
So?
Show us your bum.
Very nice.
Thank you.
Pete, you got that 50cc
Suzuki in 1988, and you let me have a go on it and I ran over your leg.
What the fuck?
Oh, wait, it's the other one.
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted the Knife Game from Aliens and I stabbed you in the middle finger.
How about December 1997, when you OD'd and I drove you to the hospital four times over the limit and I ended up rolling the car and almost severing my femoral artery, at which point you made a miraculous fucking recovery and ran off into the night, leaving me to get arrested after 12 hours of life-saving surgery?
Either one of those will do.
Thank you.
What about you?
That's easy.
That could have been drawn on.
Aren't all tattoos drawn on?
- Yeah.
- Show us your arm.
What?
Show us your arm.
No, no.
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball fucking around and dislocated your elbow.
You've got a scar where they put the metal plate in.
I don't have to show you anything, all right?
I'm Gary King.
I know I'm me.
If I'm not me, then how do I know that carved into that beam above your head are the words "King Gary"?
But it doesn't say "King Gary".
Yes, it does.
Doesn't it?
No. It says "King Gay".
Some cunt scrubbed out the "R"!
- That was me.
- Why?
"King Gay".
That means fuck-all anyway.
Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff, so did Oliver.
Selective memory, remember?
We don't see you for years and you just pitch up and bring us here.
You better come out with some hard evidence that you're human, otherwise we're going to find out for ourselves.
You want evidence?
There!
That proves I'm human!
It proves you're stupid.
Exactly!
Ow!
It's Gary.
It's Gary.
The whole town's out looking for us.
That's a good thing. If everybody's outside, that means nobody's inside.
Gary, wait! Fuck!
Gary, Gary! What do you mean "nobody's inside"?
I mean we can still do this!
Do what exactly?
Oh, we're still on the crawl.
"King Gay".
Peter?
Peter.
I thought that was you.
Are you okay?
Am I what?
I know we didn't see eye to eye at school.
Goodness knows I regret that.
I wanted to say something back at the pub, but I felt so terribly ashamed by what I'd done.
Let me make it up to you, Peter.
Please.
Gary, you're out of your mind!
We've come too far.
It's fucking suicide.
I know. We are going to get to
The World's End if it kills us.
Where's Pete?
I hate you!
You fucking bastard!
I hate you!
Pete! Leave it! Why are you doing this, Peter?
We don't want to hurt you.
Come on, mate!
It's not worth it!
Yes, it fucking is!
What's he doing?
Oh, shit.
Peter...
Peter...
I must say, I'm very disappointed in you, Peter.
I'll punch their fucking lights out.
Andy! No, no, no, there's too many of them.
Pete.
Peter.
We gotta go.
Gary's right.
We gotta get to The King's Head.
Exactly.
What?
We are not going to The King's Head.
We're done.
We're going to do what we should have done in the first place.
Get The Beast and get out of here.
We are fucking leaving and we are never coming back.
Now, you can either come with us willingly or I'm gonna knock you the fuck out and carry you there myself.
You choose.
All right. All right.
Just think about what you're saying, you know, because you have been drinking.
You fuck.
Shit, it's those fucking kids.
Not them again.
What the hell is that?
I don't know, but it's definitely not modern art.
Oh, shit, we're trapped.
Where's The Beast?
Okay, all right. We're here, so
The Beast is in the next street.
How are we gonna get to it?
We'll have to go through.
Through where?
I don't fucking believe this.
Number 10.
Come on.
Let's go.
The backdoor, back door.
Let's go.
Here we go.
Okay, there it is.
Shit.
We wait for an opening, and then we leg it to The Beast.
We need the keys.
Gary?
Gary, what are you doing?
Just a little toast.
Gary, put the pint down, yeah?
To Oliver, Pete.
And to us.
You know, 'cause
10 pubs isn't bad,
It's not, but we're calling time.
Okay.
So close.
Number 10.
Okay.
So close.
No, no, no, no, no. Gary!
Gary! Gary!
Let him go.
He left you, man.
I can't.
Andy!
Gary! Gary!
Gary, come back! Come back, you stupid bastard!
Gary!
Gary! Gary!
Andy, look out!
Come on!
What the...
Get in. Get in.
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!
You heard him, Andy.
Get the fuck in.
We haven't much time!
Andy! Go, now!
Steven!
Go!
Andy.
I want you inside me.
Okay.
Cheers.
Ah!
You've had enough!
This is The World's End, man!
I know!
Stop this!
Leave me alone!
What do you care anyway?
Of course I fucking care. There's a reason I'm angry at you!
I know why you're angry at me, okay?
But it's not my fault that you crashed that car.
That's not the point.
You let me down, man.
You were Gary King.
Gary fucking King.
I would have followed you to the end.
I fucking have!
Then stop following me!
No! It's just one more.
Let me have this.
You've got everything you want.
What are you talking about?
You've got your perfect job and your perfect house and your perfect wife.
You think it's so perfect?
She left me, Gary.
She took the kids to her mum's three weeks ago,
Said I'm not present enough.
I'm trying to win her back.
And God knows I am losing.
But I will continue to fight, because that is how we survive.
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.
Exactly! You fight for what's important.
But what is so important about The Golden Mile?
It's all I've got!
Gary.
You need help, Gary.
I got help.
You know what help was?
Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle talking about how fucking awful things had got.
That is not my idea of a good time.
And this is? They told me when to go to bed.
Me!
Gary, mate, how can you tell when you're drunk if you're never sober?
I don't wanna be sober.
It never got better than that night.
That was supposed to be the beginning of my life.
All that promise and fucking optimism.
That feeling like we could take on the whole universe.
It was a big lie.
Nothing happened.
You don't need to do this, Gary.
Yeah, I do.
Please, stand by.
Please, stand by.
Please, stand by.
Please, stand by.
Ah!
What are you doing?
No, don't go out there.
Gary King.
Yeah?
Gary King of the humans.
Yeah. What do you want?
We are here to enable your full potential,
as we have with countless worlds across the galaxy.
Oh, yeah?
How'd you manage that, then?
We appropriate a small percentage of the population at 2,000 or so penetration points across the planet.
This ensures maximum coverage.
From there, we create simulants to spread our ideologies through peaceful indoctrination.
Our objective is simple, to ready the population for participation in our galactic community.
This method requires a small sacrifice.
But the fewer replacements we make, the more successful we consider our operation.
Of course, we welcome those who volunteer themselves.
We can offer attractive incentives for those who willingly combine.
The chance to be young again and yet retain selected memories.
Isn't that something you'd like?
Something you've always wanted?
Oh, my God! I'm so cute!
The beauty of our system is that we all win.
There are no losers.
Allow me to carry your legend forward.
Let the man you have become be the boy you were.
Nah.
There's only one Gary King.
Then you have made your choice,
Gary King of the humans.
Yeah, I have.
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to come down here and tell us what to do?
We are The Network and we are here for your betterment.
In the last 23 years,
have you not marveled as information technology has surged forward?
No.
Earth has grown smaller yet greater as connectivity has grown.
This is our doing and it is just the beginning.
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.
You are children and you require guidance.
There is no room for imperfection.
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right?
And humans aren't perfect.
And guess what?
I ain't perfect.
And therein lies the necessity for this intervention.
Must the galaxy be subjected to an entire planet of people like you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who put you in charge, huh?
Who are you to criticize anyone?
Now, you might think
Gary's a bit of a cock, and he is a bit of a cock, but he's my cock.
Oh, thanks, man.
But he is a detriment to himself, just as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.
What did you say?
You act out the same cycles of self-destruction again and again.
At this point your planet is the least civilized in the entire galaxy.
What did he say? He's saying we're a bunch of fuck-ups.
Hey, it's our basic human right to be fuck-ups.
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups.
And you know what?
That makes me proud.
And me!
What is it they say?
"To err is..."
"To err is human."
"To err is human," so, uh...
We do not believe you speak for all humanity.
You are but two men.
Two drunk men.
Three drunk men!
Stevie-baby!
Enough! Enough, humans!
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's only the fucking Three Musketeers.
You are revolting against the wisdom of countless solar systems.
Yeah, we are revolting!
You just said you're not here to conquer.
Can I just ask, how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven?
That is irrelevant.
Is it?
Hands up.
Who here is human?
I'm human.
One!
And me.
That's two.
I am. But don't know for how long.
Basil!
Shh...
So what's that? Three?
You had to replace an entire town?
Not the entire town.
Everybody apart from old
Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.
That's a good name for a band, Gary.
You should write that down.
I will. What about the ones you replaced, like Peter and Oliver?
Yeah, what happened to the empties?
I told you not to ask that!
Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched and converted into fertilizer,
whereupon they are returned to the earth to promote verdancy and growth.
It is a highly efficient means of organic renewal.
Mulched?
It is a relative few in light of our long-term plan.
You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost?
What about the other places?
The penetration points.
Are they as successful as Newton Haven?
Because I'm guessing we're not the only glitch in your system.
It is true, The Network has been experiencing some difficulties.
I think you bit off more than you can chew with Earth, mate.
Yeah, 'cause we are more belligerent, more stubborn and more idiotic than you can possibly imagine, and I am not just talking about Gary.
Yeah, there's more than one Gary King.
But you said...
I fucking know what I fucking said!
Your reliance on profanity is a measure of your immaturity as a man and a species,
Why don't you just get in your rocket and fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!
Yeah! Stop fucking
Starbucking us, man! Yeah!
It is our duty to challenge you.
Just leave us to our own devices, you intergalactic arseholes.
You misunderstand.
Shut up!
We are trying...
Nobody's listening!
If you'd only...
Face it, we are the human race and we don't like being told what to do.
Just what is it that you want to do?
We want to be free!
Yeah.
We want to be free to do what we want to do!
Yeah.
We want to get loaded.
Yeah.
And we want to have a good time.
And that's what we're going to do.
It is pointless arguing with you.
You will be left to your own devices.
Really?
Yeah.
Fuck if.
They fucked off.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up yours! Up yours! Up yours!
Yeah, we did it!
We won, we won!
Gary, let's Boo-Boo.
Yeah, it's shit here, innit?
Oi, up here!
Go!
Get up.
Come on!
Well done.
Thanks a bunch. Had to go and spoil it, didn't you?
Yeah, happy now?
Basil, what do we do now?
Same as before.
Go!
Where's The Beast?
The Beast is dead, mate.
You know what... You know what's really annoying?
What?
I promised myself I wouldn't die in this town.
You're not gonna.
I think our luck just changed.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh!
Sorry!
Sam?
Yes.
You came back for us!
Yes, I did. Well, I got lost on the ring road. But, yes.
Hi, Sam, could you give us a lift to London, please?
Did you find out what happened to my brother?
We'll tell you on the way.
Sorry about the mess. I've been meaning 10 clear that up.
We forgive you. Let's go.
Which way?
Backwards!
Which way now?
Go straight over!
We can make it.
We're gonna make it.
We made it!
I'm sorry.
I know.
I know.
Everyone remembers where they were
when the lights went out on Planet Earth.
Me, Gary, Steven and Sam, we were standing right by the switch.
I guess it was a big night for everyone.
That morning gave a whole new meaning to the word "hangover".
We decided to walk it off, all the way back to London, but the headache didn't end there.
It just went on and on.
Talk about the Big Smoke.
When The Network went down, it triggered some kind of pulse, wiped out all our technology and sent us here, back to the Dark Ages.
There were casualties, of course.
I knew a few of them.
Some guy from work, my cousin Paul, Gary's mum.
Nobody really knew how many we lost, because we never heard from the rest of the world again.
Everyone got cut off.
It isn't easy now, but it is simpler.
I'm back with the wife, which is something.
We decided our problems didn't seem as bad in the grand scheme of things,
We all had to go organic in a big way, but if I'm honest,
I'm hard pressed to recall any processed foods I actually miss.
As for the blanks, well, a funny thing happened there.
They woke up.
A week or so after The Network pulled out, they just sort of rebooted by themselves,
tried to start afresh.
They seemed lost at first, children cut off from their parents,
abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance, for someone to show them the way.
I felt a bit sorry for them, to be honest.
The Network was right about one thing.
We can be a bit uncivilized.
Maybe we would've been a bad influence on the rest of the galaxy.
Oliver went back to being an estate agent.
People still need a roof over their heads,
and the old Ollie always had a gift for the gab.
I guess the new one has, too.
He's doing all right.
I hear that the Peter found his way home to Bishop's Gardens.
I suppose he picked up where the other one left off.
I'm not sure his wife noticed.
Maybe she chose not to. He's a pretty good dad by all accounts.
Steven and Sam got together in the end.
Didn't see that coming.
They shacked up just outside London.
It's a pretty nice shack, too.
As for Gary? I don't know what happened to Gary.
We got separated and
I never saw him again.
Some say he went back to Newton Haven.
I don't know why.
I think his business there was done.
It's funny, but I miss him.
I wonder if he misses me.
Misses the boys.
Wherever he is,
I hope he's happy.
That's all he ever wanted, really.
To have a good time.
I just hope he found it beyond the bottom of a glass.
Because real happiness, real friends, those are things worth living for,
worth fighting for.
Blank bastards.
Fucking robots.
Five waters, please.
You can have one.
But I ain't serving this scum.
Well, I'm afraid it's all for one and one for all.
You see, my young friends and I are on an adventure.
A quest, if you will. And since we find ourselves in need of refreshment, you, sir, have the honor of drawing first blood.
So, I'll ask you again, for the last time, five waters, please.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Me? They call me The King.

[Beeps]
This is ground control to NCR Streetgang.
We are re-routing you to recon a single reading at two-two-niner.
Affirmative.
Shadow Base Five picked up a large radar signature entering U.S. airspace.
Is the target civilian or military?
Unknown. The craft is currently unidentified.
You are to make visual confirmation and await further instructions.
Affirmative.
Resetting course now.
This is NCR Streetgang
Eagle One, Eagle Two, converge at zero-two heading.
Roger that, Eagle one.
Roger that. Eagle Two converging at zero-two heading.
Shadow Base Five, are you reading this?
[Static] NCR Streetgang, confirm radar signature of object with a base altitude of 5,000 feet, zero-two-niner.
We have visual contact.
Can confirm unidentified object at two-niner heading.
Request permission to engage.
[Static] We have multiple confirmations of unidentified craft.
Consider hostile.
Follow housecleaning protocol.
Affirmative.
This is NCR Streetgang to Eagle One, Eagle Two.
[Crackling and whirring]
[Beam humming]
[People screaming]
Priority one, you have permission to engage.
Copy, ground.
I am engaging.
And Fox Two.
It took about 3 seconds for that system to lock on.
If we can get inside that range, it's worth a shot.
[Alarm blaring]
[Alarm blaring]
This is NCR Streetgang to ground base Alpha.
Enemy combatant is hostile, repeat that,
NCR Streetgang.
They are reprogramming our weapons, changing the target.
Pull back to a safe position, Streetgang.
I want to make this clear.
Do not send any missiles towards the object.
Your comments are noted, pilot.
Thing is going down.
The only thing going down is you're going to kill a lot of people if you don't abort those missiles.
You are to pull back immediately or face charges of insubordination.
ICBMs have been reprogrammed.
ICBMs in sight.
I'm taking them out.
Switching to guns.
[Firing machine guns]
[Alarm blaring]
Breaching E.M.P. barrier.
Losing power.
[Objects whooshing]
[Alarms blaring]
Man: Move that down to the gunnery!
[Overlapping chatter]
Let's go!
Let's go!
Move your asses, airmen!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Sorry, son.
You are not on the flight roster.
Yeah, but, Sarge--
Now is not the time to bust my balls, Laughlin.
You want to help out, join the recovery unit.
That's an order.
[Airplane engines whirring]
You are number one for takeoff. Copy?
Affirmative.
Listen up, Arnstead.
We got the go-ahead to engage the enemy.
You're to follow protocol clean-sweep.
Now, we don't know who or what the hell is operating those things up there, but we're gonna show 'em what for.
You got that?
Yes, sir.
I don't care if you have to kamikaze your ass.
You're gonna take 'em out.
You hear me?
Do not disappoint me.
I'm ready for takeoff, sir.
Arnstead, you're gonna take that bird to the air, or I'm gonna come down there and kick your ass with some serious attitude.
I'm ready for takeoff, sir.
If you'd just get that piece of crap out of my way,
I'll take off.
What piece of crap you referring to, Solano?
Do not refer to my bird that way.
I'm talking about Arnstead, sir.
Requesting permission to leapfrog his position, sir.
He probably needs some time to change his diapers.
You hear that, Arnstead?
You better move that bird, or I'm gonna order Solano to shoot you there right where you lay.
Come on. Pull it.
You hear me!
Come on.
You're becoming a major embarrassment to my Air National Guard if you don't get your ass in gear,
I'm gonna have to come down there and punch your teeth out myself to gain our honor back.
Grab the stick.
Come on.
Come on.
Solano, you sit tight.
Arnstead, this is your last chance.
You get that bird out on the runway.
I'm talking to you.
You hear me?
Now you done it,
Arnstead.
I got one bullet left in my service revolver.
I was saving it for a special occasion, like meeting some chap who thought he was the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, but now I'm gonna have to use it on you.
I'm gonna come down there and blow your brains out, and it pains me to think that you're brains are gonna be spattered all over my beloved bird.
Sir!
Incoming! Move!
[Gunshot]
Damn it.
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
You chupas are not gonna get me.
[Fires weapon]
Aah!
[Screaming, explosions]
Go! Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Let's go!
Come on!
[No audible dialogue]
[Moaning]
[Panting]
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
[Overlapping chatter]
[Coughs]
I think he's got smoke inhalation.
Commander.
We gotta get our boys under cover, regroup.
We're getting our asses pickled out here.
Medic!
[Alien craft approaching]
Whoa.
Fall back.
[Overlapping chatter]
Look out!
Get your head out of the--
Let's go.
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[Panting]
Come on. Let's go.
Move out!
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!
[Overlapping chatter]
Look out!
Sir, HQ says there's an emp front right about to hit us.
Once it does, all communications will be out.
For how long?
Undetermined, sir.
Sir, this remote base we've set up is designed to function under this kind of a scenario.
[Alien weapons firing, explosions]
We should be able to get our communications back up and running pretty quickly.
We ain't dealing with the Russkies here.
What kind of intel have they got on this emp burst?
Sir, they say it affects everything from low ground to high orbit.
They're not sure how long the rebuild's gonna take.
So what the hell are we supposed to do?
We have to find the nearest ham radio.
Ham radios utilize vacuum tubes.
They're impervious to electromagnetic pulse.
What the hell are you dressed like that for, solider?
Captain Pete Rodgers
Fourth Interceptor
Squadron.
Where the hell have you been?
I've been in the air, sir.
They sent us on a reconnaissance mission to investigate that thing.
The Battle of Los Angeles.
Do you remember the date of your mission, son?
Yes, sir.
February 13, sir.
And would you happen to know what year this is, son?
I don't know, sir.
I'm sorry, soldier. I hope you didn't have a fiancée waiting for you back there, because-- it looks like you left on your mission 68 years ago.
Your mission was in 1942.
That's correct, sir.
Incoming!
[Overlapping chatter]
Move out! Move it!
Move it! Move it!
[Explosions, alien weapons firing]
Hadron, hang back.
Check for the emp pulse.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we have 2 minutes until it hits us.
Okay, I need a sat-com.
This is a priority-one message for air command.
We have a Captain
Pete Rodgers from the Fourth Interceptor
Squadron with us, the missing 1942 flight.
You got that?
Run that up the pipe for me, will you?
Find me the nearest radio ham operator.
Yes, sir.
Space-time conundrums may not be my expertise, but I don't have to be a physics Professor to know that you, son, are probably the key to all this.
You got anything?
Yes, sir. There is one civilian ham radio operator.
A Charlie Murphy.
What's his location?
I'm working on it now, sir.
HQ, HQ, we need
Charlie Murphy's address immediately.
HQ.
This is a military channel.
Clear the channel immediately.
Sir, someone's jamming our transmission.
God! Then tell 'em to clear!
Clear the channel immediately.
I repeat, this is the military channel.
HQ, this is 144.
We need Charlie Murphy's address now.
Emp pulse is coming.
HQ, HQ, we need that address now!
HQ, I repeat.
This is the 144th.
We need Charlie Murphy's address now.
Hadron, where are we?
It's coming!
Sir, no.
But command gave us the new orders.
They said we gotta get this guy to sector seven immediately.
MJ-12.
Yes, sir. MJ-12.
Those coordinates are about five miles from here.
Okay, Hadron, take Laughlin, Newman, the rest of your crew.
Get Rodgers to L-7, okay?
Maybe we should all go, sir.
Negative. I'm staying back here to check the wounded, see what we can salvage from this God-awful mess.
What are you waiting for, an invitation?
You heard the man.
Move out, double time.
I don't think we want to be caught out here with our pants down.
Let's go.
Laughlin.
You found him.
He's your responsibility, okay?
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Sir, Sector Seven's that way.
No, Sector Seven's this way.
No, but, sir--
I appreciate you trying to help out, Laughlin, but directions, among other things, are not one of your strong suits.
Let's go. Fall out.
[Jet engine whooshes]
¿Que paso?
What took you so long, gringo?
Hey, Solano.
You got company!
Foo fighter.
You got one--uh, three of 'em on you.
Where?!
They're under your fuselage.
Hey, they're like frickin' remoras.
What?
You know, they're hanging in your slipstream.
Not if I can help it.
They're still on you, Arnstead.
Damn it.
What do they want?
Why don't you ask them?
Arnstead.
Arnstead, hey!
[Squelch]
Arnstead!
Answer me, man.
What are you doing?
[Panting]
Arnstead.
Arnstead!
[Warbles]
Arnstead!
Hey!
[Warbles]
Arnstead!
What are you doing?
Arnstead, where you at?
Arnstead. Arnstead.
Arnstead!
Ahh.
[Panting]
Arnstead!
Arnstead, come in.
I'm talking to you.
[Firing machine guns]
Ahh.
Ah, hell, no.
That's right. Come here.
Come here.
Show me what you got.
[Grunts]
Mmm. Yes. Mmm.
Whoo!
Yeah.
That's right.
That's how we do.
What do you got?
Sir, right there.
I don't--I don't know what that is.
What the hell is that, one of their bombs?
Yeah, but h-how did all the people die?
Those look like projectile wounds, piercing rounds of some sort.
Okay, look, we could backtrack.
You go around, and I'll outflank it.
Yeah.
We need to know what we're dealing with.
You stay here, protect Rodgers.
If I don't make it back, you have the command.
You'll be safe here.
Bavarian steel.
They don't make it like that anymore.
[Arm whirs]
[Rock clangs]
[Arm whirs]
[Device powers down]
Holy--
No!
Ohh.
[Projectiles fire]
Aah! Ohh.
[Rifles firing]
Cover me!
[Soldiers yell]
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Golden! I didn't tell you to move!
Fall back!
[Gasping]
Hey, look. That thing's trying to draw us in.
It wants to pick us off one by one.
There's no way we're gonna get to the Captain.
Look, Newman,
I got command, all right?
Look, I'm not winding up like Golden or the rest of those people.
Unh!
We gonna take this thing out!
[Grunting]
[Gasps]
When I was in captivity, they tested those things on us.
There is a vulnerable spot, but you gotta get really close.
How close?
Closer than him.
All right.
I got a plan.
Stay low. Stay low.
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[Crash]
You should have left me.
[Firing rifle]
Sir, give me your hand.
Aah. Aah.
[Groans]
What are you doing?
Throw that thing!
Timing is everything.
Guess I found out what we're dealing with, huh?
Don't try to talk, sir.
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
[Gasps]
It's okay. Leave me.
I can't keep training you idiots forever.
You gonna take these things out, right?
Yes, sir.
I don't want to be reincarnated, come back and find little green men running everything.
No, sir.
That's not gonna happen, all right?
Good.
You have the column.
[Gasps]
Look, man, we should just go back to HQ.
We don't even really know who sent that message, man.
It could be an alien trick or something.
No, we gonna follow our orders.
Orders, man?
Everybody's dead.
What do you mean,
"follow our orders"?
Newman, you want to go, then go.
I'll just consider it your resignation.
But I tell you what.
If you gonna go, you gonna have to relinquish that weapon.
Look, you two can stay here and fight this out, or you could act like soldiers and finish your mission.
It's your choice.
What you gonna do?
Screw it. I'm with you.
All right, then.
Come on, man.
[Wind blowing]
That's Solano's.
There's no way she survived that.
Nah, nobody kills Solano but Solano.
[Alien craft approaching]
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
I'm gonna go get Solano.
You watch Rodgers.
[Alien craft firing]
Look, stay here, and keep your head down.
[Rifle fires]
[Rifle and alien craft firing]
Had to make sure you weren't trying to go AWOL on us.
All right, look,
I'll cover you.
You run.
Ain't gotta tell me twice.
Run!
Unh!
Come on, Laughlin.
I got you.
[Pistol fires]
Solano!
Come on.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on!
Solano: Aah!
- You cool?
- Yeah.
Tell you one thing.
They don't come in peace.
We gotta keep going.
All right. Go.
Go! Go!
Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on, man!
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?
I don't know, Solano.
Maybe I'll take a break.
It's been a long day.
Go. I'll cover you.
I'll cover you. Go. Go.
Ah, man. Ahh.
[Firing rifle]
Man, I gotta get me one of those.
Yeah. Me, too.
I've got to get you to headquarters.
You in charge here?
Second Lieutenant
Tyler Laughlin.
Captain Karla Smythe,
Majestic 12 Group.
Nice job. You're only about a half a mile off your coordinates.
Let's go.
Stop!
Hide.
[Firing rifles]
[Alien craft approaching]
Inside.
[Engine fades]
Clear.
Let's move.
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
Aah!
All right, let's move.
Move! Move! Move!
Let's move! Come on!
Come on. Do it!
Go. Do it!
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Let's make it.
Let's go!
Go!
Just keep going.
Go!
Everybody inside now!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Everybody inside.
Inside now!
Keep moving. Don't stop.
Go! Go! Go!
Move!
Let's go!
This is Sector Seven?
Yes.
You have power.
A limited supply, yes.
What about an emp blast?
It's a nonissue.
It is to the rest of the planet.
Thanks for sharing.
[Bones pop]
You'll need to relinquish your weapons.
Heh. Well, I'm considered a deadly weapon.
What are you gonna do about that, big boy?
Look, I don't mean to insult your boys, but we're not giving up our weapons.
There are 14 levels above us.
That's over a mile of concrete and steel.
What are you trying to say?
Nothing gets in unless we let it.
I don't have any weapons.
It's cool. Come on.
Was pretty much out of ammo anyways.
Replenish their ammo.
Ma'am.
This could be a weapon.
I'm gonna stay and make sure he replenishes our ammo.
Suit yourself.
Colonel Mekin.
Captain Rodgers.
Thank you. Thank you for bringing him to us.
Sergent Galaway, take these two down to the chow hall.
Looks like they could use some grub.
We'll stay together if that's okay, sir.
We're a unit.
Not a problem.
Novak, go grab some MREs.
Captain... it is a pleasure.
You have been gone such a long time, and you have not changed one bit.
Welcome home.
You the one in charge?
I am, and I would like to debrief you now.
I have a message for you.
Outstanding.
Follow me down to the debriefing room, and let's get started.
No. I need to tell you now.
Captain, we need to discuss this in a secure environment.
Colonel, if your people don't release the one they're holding captive, they will never stop.
Do you understand?
They'll tear this world apart hunting for him, and they will not stop... ever.
We're not holding anyone.
There's no time for games.
They sent me back here to give you this message.
They only want him back.
Who?
Who do they want back?
The one you call
Kaor.
Do you speak their language?
I can.
A bit.
If they've ship Rodgers back here... to give your little friend a message.
I think that's a chance we have to take.
You know, once he talks to it... he can never leave this facility.
Mmm.
Nah.
Mmm?
Lot of stuff.
Mmm. It's good.
For the record,
I think this is a bad idea.
But since you've been its baby sitter...
I'm gonna let you make the call.
Let's do it.
We used to stop you right here and make you sign an agreement that you wouldn't reveal anything you see beyond this door.
With what's happening up there... doesn't really matter anymore.
One more thing.
Does anybody got some
Reese's pieces?
Damn thing loves 'em.
[Buzzer sounds]
It prefers this wavelength of light.
[Speaking alien language]
[Taps glass]
[Squeaking along glass]
Karla, did you understand that?
I can't be sure.
Captain Rodgers.
If you don't mind.
Just take your time,
Captain.

Aah!

He needs chrothane.
[Kaor murmuring]

A piece.
[Gunshot]
[Gunfire]
[Grinds]
Go! Go! Go!
[Alarm blaring]
Whoa. What's going on?
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Let's make it!
Okay, okay.
[Muffled grinding]
It's coming.
Hold your fire!
[Rifle discharges]
[Groaning]
Solano.
Aw, Newman never could shoot straight, could he?
Aah. Rest in peace.
[Groans]
Get her up.
Come on. Let's go.
[Rumbling]
You okay?
I've had worse.
[Soft breathing]
Don't nobody worry about me.
[Kaor speaking alien language haltingly]
What's he saying?
Something about the mother ship.
No, wait. He's talking about his ship.
He wants you to fly his ship.
That's what he's saying?
[Gurgling]
Kaor.
[Gasps]
[Muffled rumbling]
Guys!
Go!
How's this thing running?
Vacuum tubes.
Are you kidding me? What?
And a little bit of Roswell.
That's all
I can say.
That's crazy.
Tyler.
Yeah.
On the floor.
Yeah.
How this thing work?
Point and shoot.
Cool. All right.
Hey, Tyler.
Huh?
Safety first.
Come on!
Aah! [Grunting]
Come on, Wonder Woman.
Drive.
Do your thing.
Whoo! I love this thing.
Heh. All right.
I don't think you're going to be able to handle this one. Tyler!
Come on.
Take the wheel.
I got you. I got you.
Whoa.
Go, Tyler!
Come on! Drive!
Yes! Yes!
So where is it?
Right there.
Are you kidding me?
Nope.
It was JFK's idea.
Let's get the hell out of here.
[Grunts]
Let's move.
Go. Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
[Weapon firing]
Move! Move! Unh.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Make it!
[Explosion]
Go! Go!
Down! Down! Down. Down.
Okay.
Come on.
[Devices humming and whirring]
Did you fly it?
Know how to start it up, but that's about it.
The one
I operated, it took 'em decades to figure out.
The thing is visual.
It's spatial.
I can't do it, not like this.
Tyler.
[Craft whirring]
Unh!
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Go. Go.
Okay. Okay.
One switch, and we're in hyperspace.
Great. Just great.
[Grunts]
Karla:
They're coming back.
Tyler! 500 meters!
Unh! [Gasps]
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.
Okay. Okay.
Whoo!
Yeah. That's my boy.
Bring it.
Come on, Tyler.
Ohh!
Get 'em.
Tyler.
Come on.
[Grunting]
[Sighs] Karla, maybe you can help him out here, huh?
Every machine is programmed to its pilot and only its pilot.
That's you, Tyler.
Connect up, then.
You seen Avatar.
Let's go.
Oh, yeah. My boy.
Heh heh heh.
Whoo hoo.
Okay. Okay.
This thing is-- it's spatial.
It's instinctual.
You have to look at the screen, and find the spaces.
Do you see it?
No.
I feel it.
[Beeping]
You know what I feel?
An upcoming ass-whupping.
I don't think that's the welcoming parade.
All right, she's all yours.
Unh.
Unh!
Hey, uh, don't want to be a back-seat pilot, buddy, but maybe you should take some evasive action.
Unh!
Unh!
I don't think we can hold out much longer.
Wait. I got the shields.
[Solano chuckles]
That's it.
Aw, I hope you have a plan.
Grab on to something.
You better do it now.
[Grunts]
Always wanted to know what light speed felt like.
Here we go. Unh!
[Laughing and whooping]
[Crackles]
[Ship powers down]
Ahh.
[Gasping]
Unbelievable.
Let's go see what's behind that curtain.
Okay.
Hey, hey.
Wait for me.
I want to kick some alien ass, too.
Ho!
[Gasps]
Wait a minute. Okay.
All right, move.
Solano: Watch out.
Ahh. What the hell is that?
Hold on.
Solano, tell me you got something in that bag that will kill this thing.
Aye.
Aah!
[Kiss]
Yeah.
We gotta move.
Ahh. Thank you.
There's thousands of 'em.
Okay, we didn't train for this.

Whaah! Ohh!
Unh!
Aah!

No!

[Repeats phrase in alien language]
[Gasping]
Let's go.
Karla: Aah!
I got you.
We're not gonna be able to fly out of here.
We're going down with the ship.
Wait.
Unless we use-- the shields.
--The shields.
Yeah.
That end of the console.
Okay, under the console.
Right here?
There's another screen.
Okay, okay, Tyler,
I know this is gonna feel counterintuitive, but you've gotta relax and just feel the ship.
[Humming]
Okay?
That's it.
Okay.
You got it.
Okay. Okay.
Shields are up.
They're on maximum.
Uhh!
Heh.
[Both laughing]
How you feeling?
Great.
Okay.
Let's--let's go.
Okay.

My name is Kathy H.
I'm 28 years oId.
I've been a carer for nine years.
And I'm good at my job.
My patients always do better than expected and are hardly ever classified as agitated, even if they're about to make a donation.
I'm not trying to boast, but I feel a great sense of pride in what we do.
Carers and donors have achieved so much.
That said, we aren't machines.
In the end, it wears you down.
I suppose that's why I now spend most of my time not looking forwards but looking back, to The Cottages and Hailsham, and what happened to us there.
Me,
Tommy, and Ruth.
ALL: (SINGING)
When we are scattered afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing today
When we look back and forgetfully wonder
What we were like in our learning and play
Oh, the great days will bring distance enchanted
Days of fresh air in the rain and the sun
How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on
Good morning, students.
CHILDREN: Good morning, Miss Emily.
It has come to my attention that three burned cigarettes were discovered, hidden behind a pot in the flower garden.
I know that on occasion students have seen some of the caretakers and deliverymen smoking cigarettes, but I must emphasize, once again, that it is much, much worse for a student of Hailsham to smoke cigarettes than anyone else.
Students of Hailsham are special. keeping yourselves well, keeping yourselves healthy inside, is of paramount importance.
Have I made myself clear?
CHILDREN: Yes, Miss Emily.
RUTH: I think, one day,
I'd like five horses.
I don't know all their names, but I know I'd like five horses.
The best would be Thunder.
He'd be dangerous to ride, so you can't ride him.
You can ride
Bramble.
Just so long as you don't use your crop on him.
That's pretty.
You have it.
Look. Who's that with Miss Emily?
Do you think it's the new guardian?
KATHY: Miss Lucy.
I think it must be.
We haven't had a new guardian for ages.
CHILDREN: (CHANTING)
Arthur! Arthur!
Catch it, Tommy.
(GIRLS CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY)
Why didn't Tommy get the ball?
Excuse me, Miss Lucy?
Why didn't Tommy get the ball?
When it bounced over the fence, it couldn't have been far from him.
The fence is the boundary of the Hailsham grounds.
We don't go outside the boundary, Miss Lucy.
It's too dangerous.
Dangerous?
RUTH: There was once a boy who had a big row with all his friends and then ran off beyond the boundary.
They found him, two days later, in the woods. Tied to a tree.
With his hands and feet cut off.
Dead.
RUTH: And there was the girl who climbed over the fence, by the front gate.
And when she tried to get back, she wasn't allowed.
And then she starved.
Out there.
Right by the gates.
Who told you these stories?
RUTH: Everybody knows them.
And how do you know they're true?
Of course they're true.
Who'd make up stories as horrible as that?
(CHILDREN CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY)
Tommy, what are you doing?
What is it, exactly?
I think it must be a dog. ls it a dog, Tommy?
ARTHUR: It can't be a dog. lts eyes are too small.
I think it must be a kind of rat.
Yes, that's it.
Tommy's drawn a rat.
It's not finished yet.
That's right. You haven't finished the whiskers.
Do you think Tommy's rat will be selected for The Gallery?
TOMMY: It's not a rat.
It's an elephant.
GERALDINE: Children, back to work.
He's got his shirt on.
His favorite polo shirt.
RUTH: He really doesn't suspect a thing.
BOY: Looks like no one wants you, Tommy.
What's he doing?
It's his own fault.
If he learnt to keep his cool, they'd leave him alone.
TOMMY: I hate you ! l hate you all !
GIRL: Kath... No, don't!
You shouldn't have...
Kathy H.
What's this from?
I don't remember.
Doctor?
It's nothing.
Just a bruise.
LUCY: Hello.
Kathy. Kathy H.
Of course. Kathy H.
Come in.
So what can
I do for you?
Well,
I was wondering what you said to Tommy.
Out on the playing fields.
I see. Oh.
So what did I say?
I believe I was trying to calm him down.
Because he seemed upset.
He explained he was often teased about sport and art, so I told him he shouldn't get upset about these things.
The other children are only teasing him to get a reaction.
And if it happens that he's not particularly good at sport or art, well, that doesn't matter.
It's not so important.
Thank you.
Kathy.
Aren't you sitting with the girls?
Well, I just checked and I'm pretty sure I'm not sitting with the girls.
I'm sitting with you.
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I mean, I wouldn't want to hit any girl.
But particularly not you.
Well, it was an accident, that's all.
GERALDINE: Tommy, finish those vegetables.
I'm not gonna get angry like that anymore.
Because of what Miss Lucy told you, about being creative?
How do you know about that?
I'm nosey.
She can't actually mean that being creative isn't important, can she?
I mean, what about
The Gallery?
If being creative isn't important, then why have a gallery at all?
I don't know.
...by arching her back, or perhaps with the aid of a pillow, the woman can arrange herself...
(SINGING) Smile
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
Can I help you?
I wanted one tea, with milk and sugar in it.
One tea. Right.
LUCY: Tommy.
Oh ! One tea with milk and sugar in it, please.
No, Tommy.
I want to hear your own order.
Don't simply repeat the one you've just heard.
What other drinks do they serve in cafés?
Water.
(WHISPERING) Coffee.
Coffee.
LUCY: So, then.
So, then, one coffee, please, with milk and sugar in it.
Thank you.
RUTH: (WHISPERING) l think Laura likes Arthur.
KATHY: (WHISPERING) All the girls like Arthur, don't they?
Maybe.
I'm not sure you do.
He's not my type.
I think Laura and Arthur will be the first in our year to have sex because, if Arthur wants to,
Laura wouldn't stop him.
I'm sure you're right.
Tommy's changed.
Changed how?
Just changed.
That's all.
EMILY: What about this one by Madeleine Kane?
I think it shows more than technical ability.
It gives a real insight into the child.
Which is precisely what
Marie-Claude wants for The Gallery.
GERALDINE:
Yes, I agree.
Mmm.
EMILY: Put these two together.
Madame is coming.
EMILY: Good morning, students.
CHILDREN: Good morning, Miss Emily.
There are several points of order today.
The first is that our good friend,
Madame Marie-Claude, is visiting us.
She will, as usual, be carefully inspecting your artwork and poetry and selecting the very best pieces for inclusion in her Gallery.
We will, of course, extend to her every courtesy and make her feel most welcome.
Second point of order, a piece of good news for alI students who have been diligent in collecting tokens.
After studies tomorrow, there will be a sale.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING
EXCITEDLY)
The delivery will arrive in the morning, and I was assured by the van driver that the boxes will contain a bumper crop.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY) ls it really a bumper crop?
I should say so. Yeah, sweetheart. It's a bumper crop.
Hey.
Aren't you buying?
If you've already spent all your tokens, you can have some of mine. l have tokens. I was just gonna wait till the rush died down.
I'm sure there'll be something good left.
What's the matter, Kath?
Well, anyway, it doesn't matter if you can't find anything in the sale because I already found you something.
KATHY: A music tape.
I don't know much about it, if it's much good or anything.
Thank you.

Darling
Hold me

Darling kiss me
And never

Let me go
The problem is you've been told and not told.
That's what I've seen while I've been here.
You've been told but none of you really understand.
So I've decided I'll talk to you in a way that you will understand.
Do you know what happens to children when they grow up?
No, you don't, because nobody knows.
They might grow up to become actors, move to America.
Or they might work in supermarkets.
Or teach in schools.
They might become sportsmen or bus conductors or racing car drivers.
They might do almost anything.
But with you we do know.
None of you will go to America.
None of you will work in supermarkets.
None of you will do anything except live the life that has already been set out for you.
You will become adults, but only briefly.
Before you are old, before you are even middle-aged, you will start to donate your vital organs.
That's what you were created to do.
And sometime around your third or fourth donation, your short life will be complete.
You have to know who you are and what you are.
It's the only way you'll lead decent lives.
There will be only one announcement this morning, which is that Miss Lucy, who was guardian to the fourth-year students, is no longer working at Hailsham.
(CHILDREN MUTTERING
INDISTINCTLY)
A replacement will be found for her, and in the meantime her classes will be divided between Miss Geraldine and myself.
It is hard, is it not, to continue in the face of deliberate subversion.
There are those who seek to thwart us, this is clear.
And we are aware that the tide is not with forward thinking.
It never is.
No, the tide is with the entrenched mindset.
With values that are still unexamined.
But I will not be coerced.
I will not be coerced.
And neither will Hailsham.
KATHY: I didn't understand why, after all her teasing,
Ruth wouId decide that Tommy was the boy she liked most of alI.
They say girls are always mean to the boys they like.
So maybe Ruth had liked him all along.
Maybe I should have teased him, too. l kept hoping they would separate, like the other childhood and teenage romances at the school.
They never did.
We were moved from Hailsham at 18 and sent to various accommodations around the country, to wait until we were old enough to start the donations.
Tommy, Ruth and l were sent to a colIection of farm buildings called The Cottages.
During our stay there, we were told that some of us would be permitted to volunteer as carers.
But, apart from that, we'd be left largely to our own devices and even allowed to take day trips into the surrounding countryside.
The Cottages were also our first contact with those who had not grown up at Hailsham.
There were people from White Mansion,
Oakhill, Morningdale and other homes I'd never heard of.
Everyone seemed wiser and more worldly than us.
None more so than
Rodney and Chrissie.
They'd already been at The
Cottages for over a year and would soon be leaving for the completion centers.
GIRL ON TV: Ricky? I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I can help you out there.
He's talking about blue eyes, blond hair, cute dimples when he smiles.
And biceps that couId crack walnuts.
BOY: Jennifer, get real,
I saw you with him.
Jen and Ricky sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
That is so not true.
We weren't in a tree.
Hey.
Where you going? l thought
I'd go for a walk.
Does that mean you want to be alone?
I'm not even saying that
I'll apply to be a carer.
Just that several people have said that I'd be good at it.
But then Laura went around telling everyone that I'd been saying I was the most likely to get selected.
That's so not true.
So not true.
Thank you.
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSlC
PLAYING ON RADlO)
RUTH: I'm getting more plates.
CHRISSlE: (LAUGHING) ls there anything left for us?
I don't know.
CHRISSlE:
Perhaps not.
Ruth, why do you do that thing?
Squeezing
Tommy's shoulder.
I'm allowed to touch Tommy, aren't I?
It's the way you're touching him.
You know what I mean. It's copied from that television show.
That's so not...
Don't tell me
"that's so not true."
All that behavior, that's not what people do out there, in real life, if that's what you were thinking.
So what? Look, it's no big deal. A lot of us do it.
What you mean is
Chrissie and Rod do it.
Oh, Kathy.
So that's what this is about.
It must be really awful for you, surrounded by all these couples.
I never said that. l just think it's daft.
You copy them, and they copy from a television show.
I'm right, aren't I?
You don't like the fact that Tommy and
I are friends with Chrissie and Rod, whereas you hardly speak to anyone.
No. You're not right.
"So" not right?
Thank you, Mr. Keffers.
Hello, Tommy.
Hello, Kath.
Well, don't just hover in the doorway. Come in. Join the fun.
Didn't know you liked that sort of stuff.
You're very welcome to them after I've finished.
Oh, no, it's just sex stuff. l expect I've seen them all already anyway.
Kathy, what are you looking for?
What do you mean? I'm just looking at dirty pictures.
What, just for kicks?
I suppose you could say that, yes.
If it's just for kicks, then you don't do it like that.
You need to look at each picture more carefully.
Nothing really happens if you go that fast.
How do you know what works for girls?
Kath, you're not looking for kicks.
Here, give it to Ruth. See if it does anything for her.
Hi.
I suppose you've heard what Rod and Chrissie have been saying.
No, I haven't.
Well, you know that
Rod and Chrissie have been thinking of applying to be carers, so they've been learning how to drive.
Yeah.
Well, last weekend, they went up to a town on the Norfolk coast, and they think they saw this person.
What kind of person?
A lady working in an office.
And...
What is it, Ruth?
But they thought this person was a Possible.
For me.
They found your Original?
They aren't sure, obviously,
(EXCITEDLY) but Rodney said that the resemblance was really striking.
Oh, my God. Ruth ! l know.
They want to drive me back up there so that I can see for myself.
Tommy will come, but...
Do you want me to come?
Ruth, of course.
So, exactly how much experience have you guys had with the outside?
Quite a lot.
No, we haven't.
We did a lot of role-playing exercises at Hailsham.
They don't count.
RODNEY: Okay. Well, don't feel scared.
Okay? There's really...
There's nothing to it.
We aren't scared.
Good.
I'll get sausage, egg and chips.
(SOFTLY) Sausage, egg and chips, please.
Yes, sausage, egg and chips.
Sausage, egg and chips, me, too, please.
Well, I suppose I'd better get sausage, egg and chips, too, then.
Five sausage, egg and chips. Drinks?
Five Cokes, please.
CHRISSlE: It was good.
It was really good.
What?
Sorry.
You know, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you lot about.
The problem is that back there at The Cottages it's impossible.
Someone's always listening in.
CHRISSlE: So, someone was saying that some
Hailsham students in the past have managed to get a deferral.
Apparently those
Hailsham students could have their first donation put back by three or even four years.
As long as they qualified.
If there was a boy and a girl, and they were in love with each other, really properly in love, and they could prove it, then they would be given a few years together before they began their donations.
Where did you hear about this?
When we were at White Mansion.
People there were always going on about this Hailsham couple.
When the guy was only a few weeks from donation, he just went to see someone. He applied, and everything got sorted out.
I suppose you lot would know about that sort of thing.
Being from Hailsham, you'd know how that sort of thing works.
Who is it you go to?
Who would we talk to if we wanted to apply?
To be honest, I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on.
Do you expect us to believe that?
Everybody knows
Hailsham is special.
So what is it?
Why keep these things to yourself?
There were lots of stories at Hailsham.
I don't think many of them turned out to be true.
It may be down here.
Yeah.
That's it.
God, it must be her.
Yeah, that's her.
RUTH:
It's not her.
I'm not her.
No, you're not.
It was really close, though.
Oh, shut up, Tommy! It wasn't close. It wasn't close at all.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be her before we even got here!
It was never gonna be her.
They never, ever model us on people like that woman.
Ruth, don't.
What?
We all know it, we just never say it.
We are modeled on trash.
Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps.
Convicts, maybe, as long as they aren't psychos.
If you want to look for Possibles, if you want to do it properly, look in the gutter.
That's where we came from.
Hey.
We should go back.
RUTH: Don't tell me to calm down !
You walked down the pier and you left me there.
You knew
I was well upset.
BOY: Out here.
Chrissie and Rod are pretty obsessed about this rumor, aren't they?
About the deferrals?
Mmm.
I was thinking about it again last night, and if this rumor's true it might explain a few things.
Such as?
Well,
The Gallery, for instance.
We never got to the bottom of it, what The Gallery was for.
Pictures, poetry and sculpture.
Say something about yourself.
That's the whole point about art, isn't it?
It says what's inside of you.
It reveals your soul.
Yeah. So?
Suppose for a second that the rumor is true.
That there is a special arrangement for Hailsham students, if they're in love.
Well, there would have to be some kind of way to decide if couples are telling the truth and not just lying to put off their donations.
That's what The Gallery could be for. ln The Gallery they have everything about us they need to know.
So if we say that we're in love, they can look into our souls and they can see.
They'll know if it's real love or if it's just a lie.
That's a strange idea, Tommy.
What?
No, no. I don't think that's any stranger than any other idea.
And didn't Miss Lucy say that making art for The Gallery wasn't even important?
Yes.
But look what happened to her.
Are you thinking of applying?
With Ruth?
No.
It wouldn't work.
Why?
Because you forget that you got lots of stuff into
The Gallery over the years, and if I applied they wouldn't have anything to go on.
It's all just rumors and theories.
Yeah, I know.
Tommy.

And when we do, perhaps that will be your chance with Tommy.
Chance to do it right this time.
But you see, the thing is, Kathy, although Tommy really likes you as a friend, he just doesn't see you that way.
He told me about the porno magazines.
We had quite a laugh about it.
He doesn't understand what you were doing.
But I did.
Oh !
BOY: I said I'll just be five minutes.
I want to be a carer.
It's you who l apply to, isn't it?
Yeah.
I said that
I'm applying.
I'll bring the forms tomorrow, and that'll start the process.
KATHY: By the time Ruth and
Tommy actually did separate, my carer training had already begun.
So I was hardly ever at The Cottages.
It had never occurred to me that our lives, which had been so closely interwoven, couId unravel with such speed.
If I'd known, maybe I'd have kept tighter hold of them and not Iet unseen tides pull us apart.
Once I began working with my donors,
I didn't have much time to dwell on Tommy or Ruth.
Eventually, so many years had passed
I came to think I wouId never see them again.
Many carers find themselves just going through the motions, waiting for the day that they can stop and become donors.
But for the most part, being a carer has suited me fine. l quite enjoy traveling across the country, shuttling from center to center, hospital to hospital.
KATHY: Here you are.
Dark chocolate.
If you knew how many shops I had to go to before I found those. l thought I wasn't allowed to eat so soon before the operation.
Oh, you're not.
But I am.
And after the operation, you can wolf down the whole packet in one go.
KATHY: For me, the real test of being a carer is when a donor completes earlier than expected.
On the second or even first donation.
(SOFTLY) Can I just have a quick word?
Okay.
I was wondering who'd be working on Hannah today.
KATHY: I'd never say I've become immune to the completions.
But they are something
I am abIe to live with.
You're Hannah's carer, aren't you?
Hannah's carer?
Yes.
I'm sorry, it's always hard, but there were complications.
You need me to sign the release?
Please.
Are you going to leave now?
We can quite easily provide you with a bed tonight if you've got a long drive. l can be back home in under two hours.
It's always better to wake at home, isn't it? ls that someone you know?
Yeah.
Actually, we grew up together.
Oh.
How is she?
Were you close?
We haven't seen each other now for almost 10 years.
Well, Ruth isn't as strong as we would hope, at this stage.
She's done two donations.
She has.
You think she'll complete on the third?
I think she wants to complete.
And, as you know, when they want to complete, they usually do.
Kathy.
RUTH: I've been keeping tabs on you over the years.
And Tommy, too.
KATHY: What do you hear about Tommy?
(SlGHS) That he's done his second donation, too, and apparently he's doing very well on it.
Apparently he's in better shape than some after their first donation.
Good old Tommy.
I'm not surprised.
Are you surprised at me? l expect I look a bit broken, Kath.
It's okay.
I don't think I'd want to survive my third donation, anyway.
You hear things, don't you?
What kind of things?
Oh, you know.
How, maybe, after the fourth donation, even if you've technically completed, you're still conscious in some sort of way.
And then you find out that there are more donations, plenty of them.
No more recovery centers.
No more carers.
Just watching and waiting.
Till they switch you off.
I don't think l fancy that. ls it the end of the day already?
Do you know, it's funny,
I think I've thought about you every day for the last few months.
Hoping I'd see you again.
Do you know, I felt sure that I would.
Seemed impossible that I'd complete without seeing you one last time.
It's not the last time, Ruth.
They offered me a bed.
I was planning on staying the night anyway.
Well.
RUTH: I always knew you'd be a good carer.
Your donors are very lucky.
Look, I was lying awake last night and I suddenly had an idea that we'd take a trip together.
Where to? l hadn't much thought of where, just a trip.
Although a place did spring to mind.
One of the boys on the other floor was talking about it.
It's near the
Kingsfield Recovery Center. ls it the boat? The one left on the beach?
You've heard about it, too? l heard. One of the carers who worked there.
And do you suppose, if we're driving all that way, that we could call in on Tommy?
Told you I'd been keeping tabs on you.
Have you seen him?
No, not since
The Cottages.
No, neither have l.
RUTH: How will we find him?
KATHY: His carer said he'd be waiting outside.
Look, there he is.
Do you think he's recognized us through the glass?
No, no, no.
Let's not get out.
KATHY: Ruth's in the car.
Oh, right.
Hey!
Hi !
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
RUTH: I'm good.
Look at your hair.
TOMMY: Oh, yeah.
My hair. l can't quite believe that I have you both here.
Does it feel to you that we're back at Hailsham again?
Like no time has passed?
No, it doesn't.
TOMMY: No, it doesn't at all, does it?
It really doesn't at all.
It's really weird.
But a good weird, I think.
I don't suppose you both heard that Hailsham was closed?
The only schools left now, you hear they're like battery farms.
Like Morningdale.
I'm sure that's an exaggeration, though.
Are you sure we're going the right way?
It's locked, it looks like.
No one said anything about this.
No one said anything about a locked gate.
Ruth, just relax.
It's okay.
Can walk through here.
Wow.
Hey, come on.
TOMMY: I wonder if that's what Hailsham looks like now.
Do you ever hear, Kath, about any of the students from Hailsham?
Sometimes, yeah. l heard that Amanda completed on her first donation.
I think that happens more than they ever tell us.
TOMMY: Hmm.
Yeah, there was this guy at my care center who was always really scared of completing on his first donation.
But it was all fine.
And he's just come through his third one now, and he's completely all right.
It's funny,
I don't think...
Well, I know I wouldn't have been a very good carer, but in a way I actually think I'm quite a good donor.
(SNICKERS) That's what we're supposed to be, isn't it?
I'd like you to forgive me.
I don't expect you to.
Forgive you for what?
For keeping you and Tommy apart.
Should have been you two together, I always knew it.
As far back as I can remember.
It wasn't just because of the rumors about deferrals.
It was because
I was jealous.
You had real love and I didn't, and I didn't want to be the one that was left alone.
It's the worst thing l ever did.
And now I want to put it right.
I don't know how you can do that, Ruth. l can if you two get a deferral.
It's too late for that, Ruth.
Way too late. It's stupid to even think about it.
It isn't too late. Look, you'll see, both of you.
I wanted to do this trip because I had something that I wanted to give you.
It's Madame's address.
That's who you apply to. That's who you have to go and see.
How did you get this?
It wasn't easy, but I've had years to think about what I did.
And years to try and work out a way to make it right.
I started doing them when we were at The Cottages.
The day after we went to find Ruth's Possible. l realized that if I was ever going to apply for a deferral, then I'd have to show them something.
And I've done hundreds of them over the years.
They're wonderful.
What? Really?
Yeah.
Well, thank you. l have never showed anyone them until now.
They were my secret.
Just like you and those porno magazines.
You remember that?
Yeah.
Ruth said you didn't understand what I was doing.
No, I don't think she understood what you were doing.
She thought you were looking at the dirty pictures in order to find out about sex and to find out what you were missing out on or something. l knew. l knew you were looking for your Original. l used to have these huge urges to have sex sometimes.
And sometimes they'd be so powerful, l just thought
I'd do it with anyone.
So I thought that had to tell me something.
Something about the kind of person I was modeled on.
It's stupid, but I guessed the magazines would be the most likely place I'd find her.
You know those urges are natural, don't you?
You know all of us had them.
You know that now, right?
KATHY:
"From Basrah we sailed,
"day after day, night after night, over the sea,
"visiting island after island and land after land,
"selling or bartering our goods at each.
"One day, after some weeks of sailing out of sight of land,
"we saw an island in the sea with such fair greenery
"that it appeared like one of the gardens of Eden.
"At once the captain made towards this delectable land
"and, when the anchor had been cast and the ladder lowered,
"allowed his passengers to disembark."
(WHISPERS) Don't stop.
KATHY: Ruth got it right. Right street, right door, everything.
We have to decide which of my drawings we're gonna take.
Just take the best ones.
Maybe six or seven of them.
You have to help me.
Yeah, I know.
So, we'll just go there.
Mmm.
Next week.
I'll take you out for lab tests,
I'll sign you out for the whole day and we'll visit Madame on the way back.
KATHY: We're going to do it. l thought you should know.
You're going to apply?
Yes.
Good.
Madame?
Sorry.
We didn't mean to startle you.
We were at Hailsham.
I'm Kathy.
This is Tommy.
We're not here to give you any trouble.
From Hailsham?
TOMMY: We just came to talk to you.
And I brought you some things.
Some things you might like for your Gallery.
Come inside.
(SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSlC
PLAYING)
Please, wait here.
Look, it's Hailsham.
Kathy, it's Hailsham.
KATHY: That's exactly how I remember it.
Please, sit down.
So...
We're in love.
And it's true love.
It's verifiable.
Verifiable. I see.
Go on.
Well, we'd heard about the deferrals.
And we'd worked out the purpose of The Gallery.
Tell me the purpose.
To use our art from Hailsham to look into our souls, which would verify that we deserved a deferral.
But the problem is
I was a little bit mixed up back then and I didn't really do any art, so you never took anything of mine. l know, I know that that is my fault and it is probably much too late, but I brought some stuff with me today.
This is a book of stuff and...
Other stuff here.
Some of them I've done quite recently, and others
(STUTTERING) were done several years ago, so there's a real spread.
You already have a load of stuff from Kath already.
She got loads of stuff into The
Gallery over the years, didn't...
I'm sorry.
I never know what to do.
I'll take it from here.
EMILY:
Thank you, George.
Kathy H and Tommy D. l remember you both.
Kathy, a bright girl, and so creative.
And Tommy, a big heart and terrible rages.
You have to understand,
Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethics of donation.
We used your art to show what you were capable of.
To show that donor children are all but human.
But we were providing an answer to a question no one was asking.
If you ask people to return to darkness, the days of lung cancer, breast cancer, motor neurone disease, they'll simply say no.
We used to get two or three couples like you a year.
Not so much these days.
You're the first for quite a while.
To apply for a deferral?
There are no deferrals, Tommy.
There are no deferrals.
And there never have been.
We didn't have The Gallery in order to look into your souls.
We had The Gallery to see if you had souls at all.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Your drawings are very good.
If you want,
I'll keep them.
Thank you for talking to us.
You poor creatures.
I wish I could help you.
Sorry, can we stop for a second? I need to get out.
KATHY: It's been two weeks since I lost him.
I've been given my notice now.
My first donation is in a month's time. l come here and imagine that this is the spot where everything I've lost since my childhood has washed up. l tell myself if that were true, and I waited long enough, then a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy.
He'd wave and maybe call.
I don't let the fantasy go beyond that.
I can't Iet it. l remind myself I was lucky to have had any time with him at all.
What I'm not sure about is if our lives have been so different from the lives of the people we save.
We all complete.
Maybe none of us really understand what we've lived through or feel we've had enough time.
When we are scattered afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing today
When we look back and forgetfully wonder
What we were like in our learning and play
Oh, the great days will bring distance enchanted
Days of fresh air in the rain and the sun
How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on
ENGLISH - US - PSDH
Robin.
Look at me.
You believe me when I say that I love you?
This is how long?
24 years? 25?
I've always been there for you.
Still, whatever happens.
For all your choices, all your fears, for all... these sacrifices, these anxieties, I was there.
When you plaquais all just as filming was about to start.
" Help me, Al Get me out of here. "
"Get me out of here elegantly without ruining my reputation. "
"Aaron needs me at home. "
But Aaron is an excuse.
Bad choices.
This is the story of your life.
Bad choice, bad movies, bad guys, unreliable friends.
Even what you have not been able to choose, your mother, you make a bad choice, too.
You did everything for you.
Queen of the cinema 24 years.
All studios crawling at your feet.
I may have been too lenient with you, everyone said.
I do not know.
That may be true.
But you were just a kid.
You were scared.
You made your choice alone.
You slammed the doors, broke all dreams.
And now...
Now...
Now what, Al?
What do they offer? no idea, I'd like to know.
They yelled at me this morning against they were tired of us.
They spoke of a " final offer " which will not be renewed.
I quote: "The offer will not be renewed. "
In your opinion, what is it?
How would I know?
I know one thing: they do not remember.
They never talked to me like that.
Ever.
Forgiveness. Mom, we need you to go to.
What does he?
The airport security was called. As usual.
Aaron!
If the kite goes to the other side, you know what happens.
I know it will not happen.
It was what flight?
United 435, Rochester?
Actually, no.
Which then?
United, but not Rochester.
Let's see...
Wednesday, 18 h.
Fort Lauderdale?
I know, Minneapolis.
- That's not the important. - What is it?
The wind blew from the west, my princess proudly flown tracks and it was a perfect combination.
I thought they would merge.
These colors!
This red, this white and black clouds.
It was powerful.
But you know what?
- It will not happen again. - Why?
He did not go there, so it will not happen.
If the kite goes to the other side of the fence, we will do our luggage for a rotten neighborhood in the city, no heaven or kites.
I prefer a rotten neighborhood in town that hole!
This is not new.
I saved you today.
What?
The Al proposal.
It was tempting?
Tell him, Mom.
- He offered you what? - I do not know.
SF? Graphic novel? Holocaust?
Why refuse movies about the Holocaust?
Each actress Series B in a film about the Holocaust has had a price and you could play both sides.
Both sides?
Look at you.
Nazi and victim.
You 're versatile for a film about the Holocaust.
You know what?
You could even play a collaborator.
How many actresses have this talent?
I remember your first visit to the studio.
I was a young accountant, down the hall.
Everyone said: " Here it is! "
"She is beautiful, sexy, smart, strong, talented, modest, wild, fantastic. "
And this is one of us.
She is from Texas!
This is not an actress born in Australia in an isolated farm
100 km to the cinema where the projector walked oil!
I remember I was in the hallway,
I watched you move.
You were so beautiful.
You were " Princess Bride " Buttercup.
I imagined your face instead of that of Grace Kelly on the poster of " Rear Window". A good idea.
You were the future, Robin.
You were promised the answer.
You were full.
And now...
I'm in this position.
What position, Jeff?
That offer you the final contract of your life.
The last?
Already? I do not even have 45 years.
Things are changing fast.
Soon, the whole structure we love so much will be gone.
You mean Miramount?
Good grief, no!
I mean that surrounds the actors: agents, managers, everything that follows... caravans, drugs, coke, depression, breaks, lovers, sex tips, contracts broken, legitimizing tasteless scenarios depression after the flops
PR is planted, pardon applications.
All this may disappear.
You follow me?
Not really.
Here at Miramount, we want... you scanner.
Entirely.
Your body, your face, your emotions, your laughter, your tears, your orgasms, your joy, your depression, your fears, your desires.
We want you sample, you keep and have this... this thing called...
"Robin Wright ".
What will you do with this thing called Robin Wright?
Whatever your Robin Wright refused to do.
For example?
All the films you have not made because of your bad choices.
You surrendered, abandoned, fled waived.
God knows what you did!
And all this at the last minute, it has blocked our production and cost millions!
How old are you?
Regardless, if your computer makes me at the right age!
It changes anything, I have 16 years or 60 years?
Nothing.
I need Buttercup from " The Princess Bride ".
Jenny from "Forrest Gump."
De.. What was his name?
Of "Angels of the night "?
I do not need you.
Or just your CV.
A resume filled with bad choices you said it yourself.
The last 15 years, yes.
All your films have flopped, not to buy another.
But I can save you.
- I can save you. - What?
For yourself! For yourself!
You knew?
What?
Its proposal rotten!
He knows nothing, for him cameras
Oil still work. at what?
Oil, crude oil.
Drops. It is a dinosaur.
Your career is nearing its end.
You tumbled long ago.
Scanned on the market actors, you 're not worth a nail.
We are at war.
An actor who has not signed within 6 months will be dead.
Erased from his screen characters ever.
You'll come back crawling, begging me te scanner.
What should I do to make that happen?
Nothing.
You sign, half-day scanning.
- That's it? - That's all.
And you commit to never play.
Nowhere, for eternity.
What do you mean "nowhere"?
Or movies, or TV, or school room, or avant-garde theater
Australia.
"Nowhere " is nowhere.
Robin Wright, actress, continue to live between the walls of studios Miramount.
This Robin Wright will be able to take money and fly on a Polynesian island to discover his true self.
What do you say?
You know, it's interesting.
Between actresses, it was said that never can not sleep with you for a role, but I'd do it being a flea dirt in your computer.
So thank you.
But, no thank you.
The offer is valid for 30 days.
After so much the worse for it.
Okay, my treasure?
What is it?
I was tired, I think.
Want to fly the glider Wright brothers?
It is not ready yet.
A kites Cody?
I do not know.
I missed landing 14 h.
What you got?
- You look sad. - Really?
And if you did steal one of Cody?
Me?
- I think not. - You'll get there.
Small. Trying
Go.
Trying at least once, all alone.
To see what it does.
I'll be watching, he does not go to the other side.
It should not be fired here.
Sarah, will open.
Me?
Nobody ever comes to see me.
So like that.
Okay?
You could have called.
Why? You do not unhooked from the interview studio.
Here Steve. It will establish your contract with the studio.
This is an ace contracts scanning.
Keanu Reeves, Michelle Williams, this is it.
They are scanned tightly.
Hi, delighted.
Hi, kids!
- You drink something? - Of course.
- And you? - No, thank you.
It's a real glider.
Thank you, it is beautiful.
And he, who is he?
Steve, a new lawyer with whom I work.
An ace contracts scanning.
It is a sacred warehouse you there.
This is not a warehouse.
This is an old shed for DC-9.
It was built in 1973.
You will not get a license conversion residence today.
An ace of scanning?
I saw on the "show" chain which scans players to make digital creatures.
It must shake up the contracts.
Absolutely. absolutely, it is a very different irrevocable contract.
Complex, full details must be the eye.
You can not return it.
Why " irrevocable "?
Once scanned and the computer is folded.
Everything depends on the agreement before.
You have to be really vigilant.
The character belongs to the studio.
- What character? - The actor of yesteryear.
" Old "?
Once paid and scanned, the actor is not an actor, there is only one person lambda.
The actor is no longer a character computer in the studio.
The studio does what he wants.
Unless the lawyer inserts a clause contrary.
So it is very complex.
Very complex.
This is a new field that explores.
- What happens to the actor? - Which actor?
The actor of yore, become a digital creature.
He will play golf somewhere.
And he does not like golf?
In this case, he plays what he wants.
You have a screen here?
Or is it too modern?
There is something else I have not told you.
What you do not tell me?
They will arrive in 15 minutes, then speaks.
My God...
You've also slept with Maria.
Admit, motherfucker.
Admit that you slept with it too.
I knew from the beginning.
This slut seduces you...
My God, Max, it makes me want to vomit.
I have not slept with Maria.
- With who? - With nobody.
More...
I voted for Bush.
You voted for Bush?
Yes.
I even voted for both Bush senior and junior, four times!
Who are you?
My God, did I marry?
It is not Michelle.
If this is Michelle!
Of course, this is Michelle, but... she was not there when they did that?
She was in Paris when they made this shit computer.
I can not believe.
Frankly, it's perfect.
Perfect? No.
But not bad for the beginning of the revolution.
You saw?
What morons!
3 years they are trying to fix this bug.
I do not find it funny.
You must see this nod in the sex scenes.
This is hilarious! mom,
I must admit that it's done!
Do not be so severe, technophobia nowhere.
So, you're on their side?
You changed sides?
Stop, enough hypocrisy.
Nothing has changed.
They took what they wanted and created a crappy series as they have since the 40s.
It would be better for her, or for you to be stuck on the shelf for six weeks?
As a dog?
To embrace an actor rotten breath?
It does not bother you that they did not consult?
And you, they consulted you?
You've always been their puppet.
Producers, directors, they told you what to do, how to act, how to play, how to smile, how to love.
And they gave you the subtext each crappy replica.
And when you've had 35 years they have told you how to stay young.
Because if you do not obey their being a few years of your beautiful face, you cease to exist!
So where is the difference?
It is the freedom to choose?
Yes, the freedom to choose! What are you talking about?
It is the privilege of choosing one you removed.
I do not want to decide that I should be and when!
I decide it's my choice!
I decide if I want to be a whore, a singer, if I want to play Keith Richards.
It's my choice, not theirs.
You dream!
You have a choice when they stressed you to death, saying that after a year without turning, you'd finished? It is a choice?
And women topspin to death who can not smile or show sorrow or emotion, it is a choice?
You're in their hands, you will not see?
It was saved miraculously by those pesky computers!
Saved!
You're crazy if you do not agree. Raving mad!
And what they say about you is true.
On your choice calamitous! Awake, Robin!
This opens the door to freedom.
Okay, my friend?
Hopefully, Dr. Barker.
New flying monsters?
I have a real one, the original Wright brothers.
Super is the glider?
December 17, 1903?
I built a similar model, but...
11.50 m wingspan. He will make his debut.
All right.
In fact, you need to one of the Wright brothers. The third.
Aaron Wright.
I am the original Wright brother.
I build better than because I live in a world jets and spaceships.
It's totally different.
And they had no competition.
Mermaid.
Silence.
Glamour.
Love.
Kite.
Kite.
Listening.
cover. </ i>
Hitch.
Travel.
Remember, you must repeat the word.
Table.
Capable.
Sky.
Sky.

Distraught.
Bomb.
Grave.
His condition worsens?
It's too early to say.
But his hearing seems to deteriorate gradually.
Brakes.
Sentence.
Coronation.
Isolation.
Storm.
Rage.
Regarding the report of the ophthalmologist, it is not very optimistic either.
It has reached the stage of retinitis pigmentosa.
Is it a long way... and complicated to say a horrible thing?
No, this is a very long-term mean his visual field decreases. the final, night vision decline dramatically, until complete night blindness.
And then?
Dr. Barker?
Yes, my grandfather?
You can switch me the noise of the volcano?
The noise of the volcano?
Thank you.
I beg you.
And the other 50%?
Aaron is one?
That is the mystery with this syndrome.
You will not know until it has 30 or 35 years... it will be completely blind.
Aaron has a remarkable mind.
It stores information and translates it in his own way, it is a gift.
He hears " Coronation " says " Isolation " but he knows what he's doing.
Imagine what resemble movies in 50 years.
I think it is similar to what Aaron.
- That is to say? - That is to say...
The filmmakers provide electronic stimuli the brain result according to the subconscious of each.
We give people the data history and they will take their mother, or girlfriend, to embody or Marlene Dietrich.
Depending on what is in their brain.
This is exactly what Aaron.
This is a rare case he is ahead of his time decades.
And you, dear friend, how are you?
Okay.
New roles on the horizon?
I think so.
Whatever happens, let Steve talk.
Robin Wright for Jeff Green.
Miss Wright, I did not see you recognized.
This is not new.
Ça Va?
" Neither child abuse, or gender, except in a love story or a romantic comedy, or mentally retarded, or disabled, or porn, or holocaust, or Nazis. "
You have stated all this?
Absolutely.
You're a freaked swastika?
- Not him, my children. - These are his children.
They added Nazis and porn?
Porn at your age?
The Nazis and the Holocaust are prizes.
For whom? Your digital artists?
Well, they have become digital artists, not just technicians.
These are details, trifles, the nitpicking.
I agree with everything except science fiction.
No SF.
This is a stupid kind, in our opinion.
She never did SF and it does not do.
If she had made ​​a film SF this contract would be 6 times.
No SF, no contract.
So, no contract.
Why? SF is the dream.
How many people have read " The Lord of the Rings"?
0.001 % of people who have seen the movie read the book. You know why?
Because it is so difficult to read!
A nightmare! And it is razor!
You read it before making the film?
Are you kidding?
But I saw the film, and that's why we make films.
- But I wanted to say something else. - What?
I want to make you young forever.
Veiled what we will do.
How old are you? years.
Sign for SF and I guarantee you get 33 to 311 years.
Forever young, I promise.
Forever young.
33 to 311 years?
- Which is better? - 32.
You ask too much.
34 years old and sign.
A life.
In some countries, a life sentence is 20 years. where?
Middle East.
They are animals! 20 years for murder?
In 20 years, this technology is as old the invention of the boomerang.
- 20. - Okay.
We can do that now?
What you need me, you can do it right now?
I do not want to wait, it's now or never.
Robin Wright.
- Are not you...? - Yes, it's me.
Christopher Ryne.
What are you doing here?
I'll scanner.
Do not pity me.
The others are at home, unemployed.
You were a great chief operator so many great films.
Thank you. at least, I work with actors and with the light.
I get to see you as part of my work.
Like the good old days.
I also have the chance to ask take off your robe.
There is a locker room down the hall to the right.
Welcome back.
H 1 " to someone?
I'm here.
Relax, we start in a minute.
I want to not miss any your charming expressions, princess.
Smile.
Further.
You are happy.
Happy.
Now laugh.
A great laugh!
Burst out laughing!
Go a great laugh.
Bigger!
At present, the laugh... slowly... slowly... made up... vacuum...
in the absence of expression... < / i> sadness.
I can not, stop!
Turn off the lights.
Chris, I got it.
Let me do.
I already told you how I started in this job?
Why I am an agent?
The real story?
No, I've never told you,
I was too embarrassed.
You're not gonna believe this, but I started at the age of 10 years.
I was in 5th.
An agent in the 5th grade.
I explained.
There was a boy at home, in the Bronx.
Joey Tail Magic, it was called.
He had...
You know...
How to say...
He was born with a tail.
A real cock.
Inside at least 3 cm.
Maybe 5 cm.
As a boxer.
As soon as it became known, during gym, he became horribly persecuted.
I can not describe to you it has undergone, this kid 8 years.
They undressed in the street singing songs on his tail.
Kids screaming under his window:
"Joey, lend me your cock,
I want to toss my hot chocolate! "
Then one day,
I'll see before school, with an idea.
I said: " Look, Joey. "
" From now on, if someone wants to see your cock, it's $ 1. "
He looks at me and he did:
" Really, Al? "
" And I tell them what? "
"It is said that Al? "
I was a skinny kid, all vaulted, a wimp.
Not really the type wrestler.
So tonight, I went to see the Twin Towers.
I speak of the twin towers of the Bronx:
Podlowsky the brothers.
Do you remember? They already shaved 10 years.
At 13, they went with divorced 40 years.
I talk about Joey Tail Magic and I offer them
50 cents for each kid who wants to see his cock.
They take turns to manage the queue of curious,
I take bookings and money.
This month, I pocketed more money my father as a shoemaker in a year and I was 10!
From there, the business took off.
At 13, I was the agent of all losers.
The crippled, the dwarfs, hunchbacks fire eaters Bronx.
In 2 years, we were family richest area.
More... when I was 15 the child protection has nabbed me maltreatment of children with disabilities.
I did three months in prison.
And later years
I arrived in this city.
It was all glitter and tinsel and I was ashamed of my past.
But in my heart,
I knew I had an advantage on all others the power to recognize a fault, weakness, failure and exploit for my needs as an agent.
That's how I met you.
You were perfect for me.
Beautiful as an angel and the worst flaw an actress can have.
Fear.
And what scared!
Of pure terror.
A terror that goes through of all desires.
Panic attacks before every important meeting. paralysis face of prestigious roles.
And I was there to help you.
I was the devil inside who fed your fears and earned his living with your weakness.
Then, your children are born and suddenly you stopped being afraid.
You've never been so happy, you did not want to work, you wanted to stay with them.
I had never felt so abandoned me.
This is where I realized...
I'm not your agent, I love you.
I was afraid you leave me.
And suddenly, a few weeks
Aaron's condition began to deteriorate.
And I found my strength through your weakness.
Then Aaron strayed more and we are left alone.
And now, you can not really go over, trapped inside this monster.
This is your last performance.
And it will really save you all your fears, all your demons.
You did not deserve that.
You do not deserve it.
20 YEARS LATER
Welcome to Abrahama, Ms. Wright.
Is this your first visit?
Absolutely.
You are expected at the hotel Miramount, as special guest of Futuristic Congress.
This is a nice car for its age.
What year?
Just a little reminder.
Abrahama City is reserved for the animation area.
The only way to leave the animation area, that's when we'll meet again, on your return.
Your bulb.
In the age of spiritual machines where the streets have no name
Earth trembles with rage and shame.
Agent Robin is back!
" Triple A."
"Robin Robot Rebel Warrior Princess. "
Now in the air!
Hello, Miss Wright.
Welcome to Miramount Abrahama hotel.
The city of Abrahama
Miramount and Nagasaki welcome you to the Futurist Congress.
We remind you qu'Abrahama is entirely devoted to animation area.
Agent Robin is back!
" Triple A."
"Robin Robot Rebel Warrior Princess "!
Now in the air!
Hello, Aaron.
I see you left your room.
Do you feel better?
No, but it has stopped raining,
I can not risk slipping on wet leaves.
So this is how?
You should see my animated character, it is appalling.
As if a designer of genius had a bad trip.
How so?
I look like... a mix between Cinderella on heroin and an Egyptian queen who missed her chignon.
Mom?
They recognize you?
The new film is everywhere in the air.
No, nobody sees me.
I'm an old lady for them.
Probably because you're busy.
No, you never recognize me nowhere.
Welcome to the Wright.
It's been 30 years that does not recognize me.
Aaron, I can not hear you in that crowd.
I get into my room,
I'll call you later. I love you.
Robin Wright, invited to Miramount Classic.
Wright, Robin. You are the sixth today.
The sixth what?
The sixth Robin Wright.
Others do not seem also " robiniennes " you.
Ralph will lead you to your room, Miss Wright.
I wish you a good convention.
Area of animation...
Miss Wright, your new movie, " The Warrior "
Does it reflect our lives?
Absolutely.
I discover a new facet
Agent Robin each time.
For example, in "The Warrior " robots slums are part of our life, they are close to us.
People buy food processors and then...
They rush like lemons, exploit them to the bone and bone they expire.
These poor robots before they rehabilitation centers, now they are going to scrap, it's sad.
It is said that " Triple R" is science fiction but for me... this is a documentary.
Room Service?
Can I have room service?
Yes, Miss Wright. You want?
The light is off, there is more current.
There is an explanation or is it that it's just in my head? in the end, everything is explained and everything is in our heads.
What order do you want?
A full breakfast, 3 eggs...
Potato pancakes and toast.
As a drink?
No liquids. no liquid? none. It will be long?
2 seconds. How do you want your eggs?
On the flat.
Yellow will always flowing, arriving at the 100th floor?
Of course, Miss Wright.
That is why the Miramount Hotel Abrahama invented the elevator supersonic.
Ralph, it's dark in here or is it in my head?
It's all in our head.
If it is dark, it is because you chose black.
My God, this is water!
They put something in the tap water!
Jeff!
Jeff Green, you hear me?
You hear me?
Stop it!
I'll sign!
Stop playing with my brain!
I beg you, stop.
I'll sign.
If you really want
I no longer talk
That my voice is silent as previously
I will speak
I expect, you see
Whether we are talking to me
If you really want
You are Robin Wright?
Yes, at least I was.
Police Miramount!
You went too far. It makes you a star.
Next time you are blind. Dirty whore!
Stop it.
Ms. Wright, Mr. Green is waiting for you in his office.
You're here too?
You and I are the only survivors.
Who are the others?
Characters invented.
What hast thou done all these years?
I was with UNICEF,
I distributed food to children in Africa.
And you?
I took care of my son.
You look great. Finally, animated.
Look who else.
Just you and... what's his name again?
He, I understand, it cost me a fortune, but you?
I paid peanuts for your contract and you're still here,
20 years later.
What hast thou done all these years?
I fed the little Africans.
They still hungry, there?
Least, thanks to you.
Tell me about this conference why everyone is on edge?
- You'll see soon. - I see what?
You understand, soon this structure no longer exist.
Structure? Miramount Classic the Miramount Hotel?
No, not the hotel. The whole structure.
The writer antidepressants,
Russian story- boarder with a drinking problem, facilitators always behind time, idiots who fall in love their digital characters special effects guys, they all go to hell!
The cinema is exceeded.
A relic of the past millennium.
As you uncover up there
Congress Futuristic,
Miramount Nagasaki enters a new era.
We are in the era of free choice!
Which means, to extend our contract?
Nothing important.
An extension of 20 and another small clause.
What he has in this small clause?
Now that... you can drink.
Or eat you like an omelette or crème brûIée.
From now on, you're a substance, that is all.
You're a chemical formula the pharmaceutical services
Miramount of Nagasaki decoded.
People can drink you in their milkshake and imagine you as they wish.
All?
"All", it means everything.
Comedy drama, Little Red Riding Hood, experimental porn, comedies, SF, trash, zombies.
What do you have to do?
Tell me, when you fantasies single bed in the dark, you pay him, to him or her, copyright?
You'll end up signing.
Why?
You might be selling your image actress, but you're still in lime actress.
You drove here to go on stage and enjoy a moment of glory.
To be seen, after all these years.
And you will sign for the same reason.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Look at us!
But look at us then!
Can you believe that a mini- bulb manufactured in laboratories
Miramount of Nagasaki could produce this neo- divine creation?
I say if you are here, you believe.
Friends, </ i>
I came here
YOU announce ' our great scientists labs Miramount Nagasaki recently discovered the chemical formula of choice!
Me, Reeve Bobs,
President Miramount Nagasaki, I declare dice that tomorrow the great formula of free choice be placed on the market and accessible to all!
Imagine!
A life without frustrations.
Without jealousy.
Without ego.
You have a dream?
Be your dream, dammit!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the highest honor invite on stage the eternal symbol revolution initiated by Miramount Nagasaki.
It was our best actress then it became the best digital actress:
Agent Robin!
And from tomorrow you can be it!
Like her, with her!
Robin Wright!
Look at me.
They call me the " symbol.
Before, I was an actress.
Then I became a bunch of digital codes.
Starting tomorrow, you can drink me become me, drinking a milkshake.
Wake up!
Behind each chemical
YOU consume, there is a person like you.
Made of the same elements, the same love, the same dreams.
Wake up!
Here is my son.
He hears evil, he is deaf.
You could be hope for him. You all.
Have you thought guide your research in chemistry to his problem?
To those of hundreds of millions of children?
Have you thought?
Remember one thing: if you think releasing chemicals in your
Worldwide dicterez you what you desire and how desired know that by doing so, you will also release your consciousness and your conscience will eat you up.
And you will die of guilt.
Guilt will kill you.
Look at me!
I am the prophet of your loss!
My friends!
You can not go back!
You do not understand?
Imagine!
Tomorrow when you leave Abrahama, you do not even know!
Because from tomorrow
Abrahama no longer a playground for cartoons,
Abrahama is our life!
It is better to go inside.
Robin!
This is Robin, right?
Let's go.
Breathe. inhale deeply and hold your breath.
Quickly.
Descend, I feel already.
- You believe them? - Of course!
We are already stuck in our animated characters.
Sarah!
- I think I saw Sarah. - Probably.
It looks like him to be with the rebels, you can be proud.
How do you know who is Sarah?
I know more than you can imagine.
Off! This woman is seriously injured!
She injured her head, push yourself! give him your seat.
Draw the short straw.
- Who are you? - One of the directors.
- What? - From hotel.
All part of the direction we do, it is important people.
Sit.
Hold on.
You must hold on, this is important.
Listen to me.
Do not drift off, do not give up.
Stay awake.
I want to see my son.
This is the first time he is left alone.
As soon as you can, I will connect you.
Stay awake.
Tell me about Aaron.
You are Robin Wright?
- Yes, why? - Police Miramount.
Come with me.
Oxygen, we need her alive!
Why keep them alive, can produce thousand crones as this bitch!
Dirty whore!
It is a beautiful old lady!
No surgery, no nothing. impeccable!
It is not manufactured!
We need it, keep it alive.
- It is far from the hospital? - It is.
Aaron!
Who are you?
Dylan.
Dylan Truliner.
- You work for them? - I did.
Until this morning and this revolution Futuristic Congress.
I am the graphic that you computer gave life for 20 years.
The head of department Robin Wright Miramount.
Your body, your face, your smile, your sadness... have been all my life these past 20 years.
Tell me.
I was a graphic designer unemployed.
They put me in Robin department for the first film,
" Triple R, Attack."
I was clueless.
Why?
Because I knew who you were.
I had not seen any of your movies.
I did some research on you.
It was obsessive.
What was he looking for?
Where you come from, where] you went.
Texas, the typical American, skinny jeans and boots. after... one week
I sold them the idea of the lasso, with a small illustration in pencil.
The rebels seized the direction!
- Which way? - From Miramount Nagasaki.
They take control and stop the flow of hallucinogens.
It will become real!
How do I know if I'm dreaming?
Do you know what are my dreams?
You see my dream?
4 cockroaches playing poker on your lap, it's a dream?
Yes, but not mine.
Does one of you thought of me? From what I've been through
m after being sold '? </ i>
I've been obsessed with you for years.
- Through it, not me. - For me, it's the same.
At one time,
I had no ideas.
I was afraid they'll pull me and give you...
I've been looking for you everywhere in California.
I needed new... movements.
A different sensuality, things that a woman acquires with age.
Target approaching 500 m.
Bomb dropping off.
Bomb dropping off.
Let me go, I got it.
EXPLOSIVE where are they all gone?
They are deluded away from here, to freedom.
Where is Dylan?
He followed suit.
Why am I the only one left?
Because you still screwed up.
You thought what climbing on stage?
How so?
You invited me, as a symbol.
The symbol of what?
The chemical revolution, you said.
You are not a symbol, you're nothing.
The symbol is the image we have created you.
Look at you. You look a symbol?
What you did on stage was suicidal.
You do not let us have the choice.
What do you choose?
A bullet in the head.
One.
And fast. as quickly as possible,
I want out of this hallucination.
After all these years, it is time for you to know it is not a hallucination.
This is our life.
The following case is very interesting.
Patient, you may know, was an actress.
I forgot his name.
She suffered a serious hallucinogenic contamination during the uprising Abrahama.
A month since she is convinced that her life everything she has known, was a hallucination.
It was so severe that when relief
Abrahama reached, she begged Fire Chief to shoot a bullet in the head.
It is a hopeless case.
So we decided to freeze.
Given our progress, liquid nitrogen can keep frozen for 70 years.
Lower it.
Aaron?
You heard me!
You heard me call you!
Yes, Mom. Course.
What it's strange?
And now the weather.
The Company regrets Climate the asymmetry of arcs -en-ciel these last 2 days. That said, contradicts symmetry art.
Must free yourself from these thoughts.
I do not understand.
What?
I had to wake up in the distant future.
It's like treating a diver suffering from decompression.
It goes back as far as possible, up childhood memories.
Here we chose the decor for you.
The early 1980s. today, you have a visitor.
Are you ready to receive?
What are you doing here?
I was expecting you.
Me?
I waited for the moment when we could thaw you. where medicine would rather advanced to heal.
You waited for me all this time?
I was the last to have seen you,
I felt responsible.
I was told that Sarah is well.
She was rescued from the revolt Abrahama, what that means.
Now they look my Aaron.
Here is the DNA code of Aaron.
I search for ad
Your thawing.
And? no sign of him. no trace.
I think he is no longer with us.
"More with us?" In this world?
Or it is no longer alive?
You say he's dead?
It is much more complicated.
The world today is not like that where [1 you have.
To find Aaron, living or not, we must make a very long journey.
It has a direction? A clue?
I hope.
But we must start somewhere.
I came to take you into town.
Nobody told me
How long I remained frozen.
Maybe a year, maybe 20.
Now, time is subjective.
Everyone decides in his mind when the sun rises, or when the moon fades.
After some time, you probably forgot the calendar.
New York became a city hanging gardens to heaven.
Crazy colors you drunk, people are so beautiful, young and radiant.
Shining serenity beauty, sexuality.
There are more ego.
Chemistry has delivered us.
There is no ego, neither competition nor violence or war, either strong or weak, or secrets.
Everyone is... what it is.
Each is what he wants to be.
And while they eat their new personality, they emit into the air pheromones that mind translated into images.
I can not imagine Aaron in this world.
This street has the wisdom of a millennium.
There was one year when I was using
Greek mythology
I woke up half-man half - god.
I fertilized a daughter of Zeus, created an entire city then I fucked her,
I burned and punished.
It's all about feelings.
Just make a choice you feel and what you want.
What do you choose?
Usher syndrome.
What type of syndrome?
Type 2, I think.
Why? you research on someone?
I lost someone
Scale can lead you to the stars
One step at a time
May you stay
Forever young
Somewhere out there, there are currently </ i > Sarah.
It is naturalistic now.
No, it does you no good.
You do not recognize and do not know who you are.
Trust me, she is happy.
This is one of the few people still puts children into the world.
Scale can lead you to the stars
One step at a time
May you stay
Forever young
May you stay
Forever young
And if I do not want to participate this chemical feast?
You will understand very quickly it is impossible, otherwise you will be excluded from this world.
And I'll be where?
On the other side.
What he has on the other side, Dylan?
The truth.
Which is the other side?
Those who have not taken the plunge, who do not participate in the chemical feast.
And of course, anyone who manages this world.
You went?
- No. - Why?
Because I do not know if we can come back.
It's like coming back from the dead.
Some may have, we do not know.
So send me there, I'll tell you how it is.
You can send me there?
You have within you the substance?
It is not a chemical cocktail.
It is a kind... eraser which removes all influences a second chemical.
And the truth... immediately arises.
And where is it?
It's like cyanide capsules the Nazis, in case of surrender.
When I left the old world,
I took one.
It was my compensation from Miramount Nagasaki is what I asked them after 20 years of work.
This small capsule.
I want it.
If your son comes in your absence?
And if the other side? This is more likely.
That's all I have left.
If you take it, you go, you leave me.
You can not do that, not now.
Come with me.
I can not, the capsule serves only one person.
It's your choice
I'll give you everything you want.
I love you.
Robin, I've always loved you.
I loved you for 20 years, not even know you. You were my world.
And I loved you for another 20 years, until each hour every day you come back.
Promise me not to look at the real me.
Promise me you remember me like that.
I promise.
I love you.
There are still doctors in this world?
Yes, he left. where are they? up there.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me where I can find an ENT appointed Dr. Barker?
Course.
Its cabin is down the hall.
I knew you would spend not on the other side.
Do not be impressed by my presence here.
Being on this side of the truth is not so brave.
Nothing has really changed, actually.
Before we masquions truth with antidepressants, drugs that concealed, lying.
Now, we are reinventing the truth.
This is not so different.
The drugs were just a lot better.
And we have no choice?
The only choice is waiting to die here infected in this truth, halluciner or across.
It may be better out there, dreaming.
And Aaron?
Aaron waited for you here all these years.
For 19 years, he waited your return.
Her condition continued to worsen, it has become almost totally blind.
More... he did not want to go there.
However, I begged him to do so, knowing that I will not always be there to take care of him.
There six months, he went there.
It is someone else now in the world of chemical hallucinations.
6 months?
There are exactly 6 months.
He could not just more.
He had to say that I was going to die and... he no longer believed in your return.
There is no way to recover.
Here, it does not exist.
And on the other side, there are no means know who he is.
But you can go back there, it's better than nothing.
It's better than waiting for death.
And the other side...
Yes, what?
I can go back to where [1 I come from?
The place where [ one you just do not exist.
You invented it.
You go where your mind and your chemical molecules take you.
And after your visit here this will be a place in your consciousness completely different those where you've been to.
Your past is dead.
I will prepare a light bulb.
Then I call the kite.
You know where you're going?
Yes, I know.
Once again, for passengers traveling on Flight 1457 to Orlando...
please take advantage of the boarding bag-check announcement.
You'll pick it up at baggage claim in Orlando.
It's a really full flight today.
- Hey.
- Yeah, Jon Neal here.
You just had sex with me in a hotel and left without saying goodbye.
Yeah, it ended up being delayed, so....
Sorry, I was panicking.
Well, if I don't get to see you again...
I just wanted to say it was nice to see you again.
Yeah, it was nice to see you too.
Um, and listen, use that other e-mail I gave you...
because that's the only secure one, okay?
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm just....
I'm just jet-lagged. I'm tired.
You should go home and get some rest.
Hong Kong's a long way.
Attention passengers on Flight 5228...
- Oh, wait.

Yep, that's me.
They're calling my flight.
All right. Well, look,

So you really kicked ass in that football pool, huh?
You need to give up on your Lions.
Pick with your head, not your heart.
Yeah, thank you for the tip.
- Yeah. Hey, hey. Hey, doc, uh--
- Yeah?
I know you're busy.
Uh-- I, uh--

- Sure.
- I got a medical question.
- Mm-hm.
Uh, my kid's been, uh, having problems at school.
- Uh, attention deficit thing.
- ADHD?
- Yeah.
- He been diagnosed yet?
That's the thing.
They want him to see someone.
I was wondering if you could take a look at him.
- I'm not really that kind of doctor.
- Oh. I didn't know. I just thought--
Maybe I can refer someone, though.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's treatable.
- Okay.
- We'll find someone, have them take a look.
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Yup.
- Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.
Why doesn't anybody help him?
Is he okay?
Read the posts.
Some say it was staged.
An art project.
Some say the authorities wouldn't do an autopsy.
Covered it up.
- Covered what up?
- We don't know.
Maybe Minamata disease.
You know, from mercury in the fish.
There have been outbreaks in the past.
Fishing industry suppresses it.
- "Industrial disease."
- Yeah, but it's just one man.
- We don't know what happened.
- Just one man on video.
Not everyone has the foresight to die in front of a camera.
The ones we don't see worry me.
Fish is shipped all over the world from there.
How many people read your paper over a plate of sushi?
Alan, we have almost no freelance budget anymore, and after H1--
You wait. A few days, this will be tweeted...
- and YouTubed all over the planet.
- We don't wanna be the paper that cries wolf.
I'll show it to Hobart.
He does our health stuff.
You're gonna give him my story?
You're gonna give him my story, aren't you?
No, Alan, I'm trying to help you.
It's just one man on a bus.
- I taped this meeting.
- We need more information than that.
This story runs in the Chronicle,
I will sue your ass.
Great. Okay, bye, Alan.
Don't call me anymore.
Print media is dying, Lorraine.
It's dying.
I'll save you a seat on the bus.
Hi, I'm Mitch Emhoff.
I'm Clark's stepdad. Clark Morrow.
All right, I'll let him know you're here.
Okay.
He said he was feeling very warm in Mrs. Tatum's class.
I took his temperature again since I called.
It was a touch over a hundred.
Okay. Well, first his mom and now the mighty Clark, huh?
All right, let's go get some soup for you and Mom.
Hope you feel better, Clark, okay?
Okay. Thank you.
Thattaboy.
We're gonna beat this thing down by Turkey Day.
I'm in Texas. I'll try it.
I'll try anything once.
That's not true.
Jory's going straight from the band trip to her mom's place.
And my job interview got pushed to next week.
I'm not really sure what that means.
Hopefully nothing.
Hey.
My arm.
Come here, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Watch your feet. Come on.
Come on. Come on, honey.
Okay, what happened?
Did you take too much of that flu shit?
Honey? Beth, Beth.
Hey, hey, hey. Honey, honey.
Beth. Jesus. Jesus.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Hey, Beth.
- Mom?
- No, no, no. Uh-- Stay there, Clark. Don't--
Just go-- Go up to your room, honey.
Uh....
Honey, honey.
- Beth.
- Beth, can you hear me?
My name's Dr. Arrington.
You're in the hospital.
You had a seizure this morning, Beth.
- She have a history of seizures?
- No, no, no.
- Allergies?
- Uh, I think she's allergic to penicillin.
- She fall recently? Hit her head?
- No, she came back from a trip--
What about drugs?
MDMA? Ecstasy?
No. No, we don't do that.
- Okay, let's get some help in here.
- Jesus. Beth. Beth.
Sir, you have to go.
You have to go.
Let's get a line in her.
And give me 2 milligrams of Ativan, please.
So, um, despite all our efforts, she failed to respond.
- Okay.
- And her heart stopped... and unfortunately, she did die.
Right.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Emhoff.
- I know this is hard to accept.
Okay. I mean, so can I go talk to her?
Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry.
Your wife is dead.
I mean, I just saw her.
We were just at home.
Is there somebody that we can call?
Someone who you think should be here with you?
I mean, we had dinner. We had pizza.
She said she was jet-lagged.
You mentioned that she was away.
Hong Kong?
We checked the latest bulletins.
The only things there were measles and H1N1... and this was not that.
Then what was it?
We don't always know.
I mean, some people get a disease and live, some get sicker and die.
We're gonna have to notify the medical examiner... and they may request an autopsy.
Or if you wish, we can order one.
But I can't guarantee it's gonna tell you any more than I can.
I mean, my best guess is that this was either meningitis or encephalitis... and with encephalitis, we're in the dark a lot of the time.
If it was summer, I might say a bug bite, you know, West Nile.
- I don't know--
- Herpes can cause encephalitis.
She didn't have herpes.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.
What happened to her?
- What happened to her?
- Okay, okay.
Mr. Emhoff, there are grief counselors... who are very helpful with this sort of passing, okay?
You might find some resolution there.
Now, I am sorry.
Hello?
Hang up the phone and call 911 right now.
Right now. 911.
He said he had a headache, so I put him to bed.
I don't think he's breathing.
Clark. Clark.
Oh, my God, is he dead?
What we are hearing from Beijing is that the outbreak is contained...
to the Chrysanthemum complex in Hong Kong.
Two deaths and 10 suspected cases.
How are we defining "contained?"
They're using the same protocols established for SARS.
They're quarantining the complex and screening for symptoms.
Kowloon is the most densely populated area in the world...
and Hong Kong is a harbor.
It's going to spread.
Hong Kong is sending us blood samples.
We're also looking at samples from London.
Two clusters: One at a hotel, the other at a health club.
Five dead, encephalitis.
And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo.
- Three dead in that cluster.
- Any of them travel to China or London?
We're checking.
Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here.
Can you hear me?
Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal?
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.
- He's breathing, right?
I couldn't wake him.
I got home, I couldn't wake him.
We both woke up sick this morning.
Watch your head.
Hmm....
Well, the sulci are obliterated.
Let's look at the base.
Oh, my God.
You want me to take a sample, or...?
I want you to move away from the table.
- Should I call someone, or...?
- Call everyone.
Well, these things happen up there from time to time.
Meningitis in a college dorm after a swim meet...
or West Nile in some summer camp near a lake.
I was reading that last summer they had an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.
A hundred and three cases, mainly children.
Well, it's probably too cold up there for that right now.
As of last night, there were five deaths and 32 cases.
There's a cluster in an elementary school.
That's the kind of thing you have to be prepared for.
It's gonna be all over the news.
What's your single overriding communications objective?
We're isolating the sick and quarantining those who we believe were exposed.
Okay, good.
As of this moment, you and I are attached at the cell phone.
If you need resources, call me.
If you get into a political dogfight, call me.
If you find yourself wide awake, staring at the walls at 3 a.m...
wondering why you took the job, call me.
I sure hope you packed something warmer than that.
We're looking at around zero with the windchill.
Don't want you to catch cold.
Do you wanna go to the hotel first, get situated?
I'd prefer to get started, if that's possible.
- Okay.
- How far is the office?
About a half-hour from here.
Your dad's in isolation.
You can go up to the window, pick up the phone, and you can talk to him.
- Hey.
- Dad.
- Hey.
- Are you sick?
No, no, no. I'm-- Uh....
This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.
But you were with them.
You could still get it.
No, I won't.
Um, they said this happens really, really fast.
And, uh, I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with me.
We're okay. We're okay.
And Clark?
Yeah, you know, I, um....
I wasn't there.
I went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, Beth.
And, uh, I just didn't-- I--
I left him with, uh, Carrie Anne.
I should have been there.
- I could have helped.
- No, no, no. Honey, no, no.
It's good that you weren't there.
I'm happy.
If something had happened to you,
I mean, I'd....
Honey, you're here now, you know.
I'm happy about that.
I'm happy about that.
When are you coming home?
Soon. Very soon. They, you know....
- Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
- No.
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
- No. She doesn't need me.
She's got Dan. I live here.
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.
We have 47 cases and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.
People are staying home for a couple days, see if they get better.
At this point, I think we have to believe this is respiratory.
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?
Uh, it refers to transmission from surfaces.
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.
In between, we're touching doorknobs... water fountains, elevator buttons and each other.
Those things become fomites.
Is this something we wanna release to the press?
Respiratory and fomites?
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie... will keep people from getting in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes--
We need to walk the governor through this before we freak everybody out.
I mean.... we can't even tell people right now what they should be afraid of.
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.
It's the biggest shopping weekend of the year.
We need to consider closing schools.
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?
Things that keep people calm.
What we need to determine is this:
For every person who gets sick... how many other people are they likely to infect?
So for seasonal flu, that's usually about one.
Smallpox, on the other hand, it's over three.
Now, before we had a vaccine... polio spread at a rate between four and six.
Now, we call that number... the R-nought.
R stands for the reproductive rate of the virus.
Any ideas what that might be for this?
How fast it multiplies depends on a variety of factors.
The incubation period, how long a person is contagious.
Sometimes people can be contagious without even having symptoms.
We need to know that too.
We need to know how big the population of people susceptible to the virus might be.
So far that appears to be everyone with hands, a mouth and a nose.
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?
We sent samples to the CDC.
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is, if we're lucky.
Clearly, we're not lucky.
What do we got?
A young woman in Minnesota, recently traveled to China.
Son also died.
As of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths.
- Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
- I worked.
You? Really?
Texas. Salmonella. Pretty limited.
- Mine was great, thanks.
- Oh.
It's pleomorphic, but tends toward ovoid in shape.
I see structures on the surface that look like glycoproteins... but there's nothing morphologically pathognomonic.
We tested all her antibodies.
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.
Her body had no idea what to do with it.
It just kept amplifying.
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.
If he doesn't know what it is, nobody does.
It shows novel characteristics and appears to be chimeric in origin.
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length and containing six to 10 genes.
Typical of a paramyxovirus.
It's Godzilla, King Kong and Frankenstein all in one.
- Hold on. Shit, I'll call you back.
- You've got it in there.
- Get away from here.
- Where'd it come from? Military?
You're not a doctor and you're not a writer.
Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.
Blogging is not writing.
It's graffiti with punctuation.
I am a journalist, and there's informed discussion on the blogosphere... that this is a biological weapon.
You wanna talk to me, call my office and make an appointment.
- Dr. Cheever?
- Yes.
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.
We found him.
Tell the unit on the way to his house to come in.
Excuse me. Who are you?
My name is Dennis French with the Department of Homeland Security.
And what's this all about?
Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us in the emergency operations center.
We can discuss it there.
This happened in Kowloon.
Today we've got workers at a casino in Macao striking over conditions.
Three have died in one bunkhouse.
CIA thinks there may be a connection.
Casinos are of particular concern to Homeland Security.
Someone's ready to blow themselves up at a pizzeria or the local market... the thought of getting themselves sick with smallpox... and walking through a crowded casino must have crossed their mind.
What did they die of, the three?
Reports are vague. Seizures, comas.
We've reached out to the WHO, see what they know.
If you were gonna plan it, can't think of a better time.
- Plan what?
- An attack.
Is there any way someone could weaponize the bird flu?
Someone doesn't have to weaponize the bird flu.
The birds are doing that.
Officials are reporting the closing of Mondale Elementary School...
in suburban Minneapolis...
in response to the recent outbreak of a still-unknown disease...
that has so far taken the life of a school nurse and three students.
Other schools in District 281 will remain open...
but parents have been notified to keep home any children with symptoms.
The Department of Health is awaiting confirmation...
but sources say these new cases may be connected to the sudden death...
of a 34-year-old AIMM Alderson executive...
and her 6-year-old son this holiday weekend.
Hello. I'm Dr. Mears.
I'm an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer... and I'm here from Atlanta to find out what happened to Beth Emhoff.
Okay, I'm gonna ask you some questions and see if--
There was a package she messengered from Hong Kong.
- I opened it with scissors. I'm not sure if--
- No. It shouldn't be an issue.
Virus can't live for days on a box.
We did Pilates together.
I called her after she got back.
I never heard from her.
- So you had no contact with her?
- No.
- Did she go to the class?
- I didn't see her there.
We had coffee the day she left.
I think she might have moved my cup because it was on some papers.
- I can't remember.
- How many days ago?
About 10 days.
That's okay.
The incubation period is less than that.
Is there anyone else who might have had contact with her?
- This was everyone.
- Aaron Barnes did.
Barnes? He worked on another floor.
There were documents she needed.
He picked her up from the airport.
He picked her up from the airport?
Where is he?
Hello?
- Hello? Mr. Barnes?
- Hello? Yes.
This is Dr. Mears from the Centers for Disease Control.
- I believe--
- Hi.
Hi. I believe you may have had contact with Beth Emhoff last week.
Yeah, I picked her up at the airport.
What's this about?
- And how are you feeling today?
- Uh, pretty cruddy, to be honest.
My head is pounding.
I probably picked up some bug.
- Where are you right now?
- I'm on the bus, heading to work.
- I'd like you to get off immediately.
- What?
- He's on a bus.
- Where?
- Where? Where's the bus, Aaron?
- Um.... Uh....
- Lake and Lyndale. What's going on?
- Lake and Lyndale.
I really need you to get off that bus.
It's possible you've come in contact with an infectious disease... and you're highly contagious.
Do you understand?
I want you to get off now.
And stay away from other people.
Now what do I do?
Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone.
That's the most important thing.
- We'll send somebody to meet the bus.
- Okay.
I'm on my way to you now, Aaron.
What about my kids?
I touched them.
It was a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory.
She traveled a lot for work.
Did her work involve contact with livestock in any way?
- Did you keep any pets at home?
- No.
No.
Did she mention seeing anyone who was sick?
Anyone on a plane?
No.
She went through customs in Chicago at 11:15 a.m... and then took a flight to Minneapolis at 6 p.m.
Any idea what she did in Chicago during that layover?
Did she have meetings?
Is there any reason she might have left the airport?
Why? I mean, is there someone sick in Chicago?
Uh, before we were married, my wife had a relationship... with a man in Chicago named Jon Neal.
Is Jon Neal sick?
Did we get this from him?
- We're investigating all the possibilities.
- No. I think I have a right to know.
Look at where I am here.
Look at where I am here.
- I can't disclose that information. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm just-- I'm just trying to understand.
I know.
We're getting the same results as Sussman.
We've sequenced the virus, determined its origin... and we've modeled the way it enters the cells of the lung and the brain.
The virus contains both bat and pig sequences.
The dark green is pig, and the light green is bat.
And here you can see the crossover event.
Uh, bat, bat, and pig, bat.
And here is a model of the virus and how it attaches to its host.
The blue is virus, and the gold is human, and the red is the viral attachment protein... and the green is its receptor in the human cells.
These receptors are found in the cells of both the respiratory tract... and the central nervous system.
And the virus attaches to the cell like a key slipping into a lock.
Somewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.
- You ever seen anything like this before?
- No. And it's still changing.
It's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out.
It doesn't have anything else to do.
So we have a novel virus with a mortality rate in the low 20s... no treatment protocol, and no vaccine at this time.
That is correct.
From here on out,
I want no one working on this except at BSL-4.
Last thing we need is for this to walk out of the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe.
Dr. Sussman's office.
Lan, hi. Ally Hextall.
We need to shut you down.
This thing's too hot. Uh....
- BSL-4 only at this point.
- I think that's a mistake.
Cook your samples.
Uh, destroy everything.
- We can't risk it.
- We're making progress.
You limit this to government-run BSL-4s, it'll take forever.
I can do this.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sure, Ally.
Can you repeat the affected cities so far?
Again, the affected cities are...
Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Boston and Salt Lake.
We expect that list to grow...
as people return home from their holidays.
Yes?
Dr. Cheever, how many people are infected...
and how many have died?
Those numbers are changing as we speak... so any figure I give you is likely to be low.
We're still calculating the mortality rate at this time.
Uh, Dr. Cheever, are you concerned... that the CDC faces a credibility issue here... after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?
I'd rather the story be that we overreacted... than that many people lost their lives because we didn't do enough.
That's why we're here.
It's also why the World Health Organization is sending an epidemiologist to Hong Kong.
Hard to know what it is without where it came from.
Our first job with these things is to find ground zero.
Figure out how it jumped into the population.
We do know that a patient in Minnesota...
traveled to that part of the world.
We believe that there are approximately 89,000 cases at this point... and that we are heading toward 267,000.
And from there, using our model, based on an R-nought of two...
here is where we expect to be in 48 hours.
Dr. Cheever, perhaps you can update us on the research.
As of right now, no one has found a good way to grow the virus in cells.
Why is that?
Because it kills every cell we put it in.
A pig, a chicken, everything.
Until we can grow it, and a great deal of it, we can't experiment with it.
And until then, we can't vaccinate against it.
Have you found any treatment at all?
Any antivirus? Anything?
No.
Beth Emhoff used an ATM at a casino in Macao.
Citibank released her records.
We have her using the machine at 10:43 just off the casino floor.
I wanna see the casino security footage for two hours on either side of that.
Is there a problem?
Oh, they're from my village.
They found a new cluster there.
Oh.
- Is your family still there?
- My mother has symptoms.
I'll get you the footage you require.
Excuse me.
Dr. Sussman, I heard that they were shutting us down.
Yeah, I just have to deal with the samples.
If it's just a matter of destroying them,
I can do it.
No, I'll take care of it.
You go on home.
I'll do that, and then I just want to recheck some data.
He grew it.
He tried antibodies and immunological MAC outlines... but the key was a fetal-bat cell line from Geelong.
- We didn't have it.
- He grew it in a BSL-3.
Ally, what the hell was he doing working with it in a BSL-3?
Ignoring me.
He's gonna publish.
Shit. What does he want?
A box of cigars.
He had a choice, Ellis.
He could have gone into business for himself.
There's no doubt he was approached, but he gave it to us.
- And we're supposed to trust him?
- We don't have a choice.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States...
and the World Health Organization in Switzerland...
confirmed today that Dr. Lan Sussman of San Francisco...
has succeeded in growing the MEV-1 virus in a laboratory setting.
Officials at the CDC cautioned that the breakthrough is only the first step...
toward developing a vaccine...
which is likely still months away from human trials.
The WHO estimates the number of people infected worldwide to be over 8 million.
Now it all changes.
Sussman gets anointed by the National Academy of Sciences... and every pharmaceutical executive gets a hard-on.
They'll be growing the virus in every lab on Earth.
It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.
Crikey, first we shoot them into space, now we'll be shooting them full of virus.
So this is where we need your expertise.
Pharmaceutical stocks are already through the roof.
What's next?
Where's the opportunity?
Now, you saw that Shinko bus thing day one.
That's why we wanted this meeting.
When I turned on my computer this morning...
I had over 2 million unique visitors, all looking for the truth.
You think they wanna see me talking to some hedge-fund guy?
Mr. Krumwiede, we don't invent need here.
We just analyze it, predict it.
You tell me what it costs to look into your crystal ball.
You're familiar with forsythia?
- No, I'm not.
- What I'm about to tell you is backed up... by testimonials that will appear shortly in the media.
I'll be talking about it extensively in the days ahead.
What does forsythia do?
It's the cure.
If I'm immune, can't you use my blood to cure this?
Blood serums can take a long time to make, and are very expensive.
But the good news here is that you're not going to get sick.
Okay. Um....
Then that would mean that my daughter can't get it either, right?
I can't promise you that.
But isn't that something that she would inherit from me?
Well, half her immune system came from you... but the other half came from her mother.
--almost three hours.
I need to see a doctor or a supervisor or something.
I wanna know if he has this thing on the news.
I'm sorry, sir, we're doing the best we can.
Can I just speak to an administrator or something? Anybody.
Sir, please be patient.
We'll get you in--
He's sick!
My wife makes me take off my clothes in the garage.
Then she leaves out a bucket of warm water and some soap.
And then she douses everything in hand sanitizer after I leave.
I mean, she's overreacting, right?
Not really.
And stop touching your face, Dave.
Okay, we'll put the air lock here.
I want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece.
The most febrile cases at this end.
We'll set up triage outside,
FEMA can handle food in the basement... and we'll need to be operational within the next 24 to 48 hours.
Gotcha.
- Nice job, Dave. This will work.
- Thanks.
Now find me three more just like it.
Excuse me, Dr. Mears.
Is this coming out of your budget or ours?
WHO has confirmed that the Hong Kong sample... matches London, Tokyo and Abu Dhabi... and we're seeing large clusters in from Frankfurt and Cairo.
Are we any closer to an index patient?
Could be your Beth Emhoff or the guy on the bus in Japan.
Someone else who crawled off the grid.
How you doing?
Yeah, good.
I'm going into a meeting with--
No, I didn't ask what you were doing,
I asked how you were doing.
How are you doing?
I'm, uh....
I'm fine.
Fine?
You know, I was in the field for 15 years.
I've seen a lot of shit.
If you're not doing fine, you can tell me.
You ever have to tell a man who just lost his wife and stepson... that his wife was cheating on him before she died?
No, I haven't.
I'm sure you did the best you could.
- Uh-uh.
- You sound tired.
You gotta try to remember to sleep once in a while.
When was the last time you had something that didn't come out of a vending machine?
Taco Bell.
Local officials are now saying over 3000 cases have been confirmed...
in the western suburbs...
as well as the first cases reported in Ramsey,
Carlton and Saint Louis counties...
as the virus continues to spread.
- Got it!
- A state Health Department spokesperson...
at this hour is appealing to hospitals as far away as lowa for medicine.
No, don't open that door.
Don't open the door.
- It's Andrew.
- Uh, sorry, Andrew, I can't let you in.
I just came to give my condolences, Mr. Emhoff.
I understand. Thank you.
Uh, but I can't let you in.
I'll just leave them, then.
No, actually, you should take them.
Uh, thank you, though.
- I'll call you later.
- Bye.
We just, you know, aren't gonna take any chances.
- Do you know how to play this?
- No, I have no idea what's going on.
But it looks fun.
You wanna try?
Okay.
We'll see.
Hello. Hi.
Oh, yeah, my turn, okay.
This one. Crab. Okay.
- Hey.
- Oh!
Oh....
Oh, my God. I'll do--
What is that? Which one is this?
- Coin.
- It's a coin.
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
It's transmission.
So we just need to know which direction.
But we don't know where it comes from.
I would like to suggest that the virus started before Macao... and maybe here in Hong Kong.
You're considering pronouncements with serious implications.
A virus is too small to be seen on video camera.
Please, God.
Please, God.
No, no, no.
Hello?
This is Dr. Erin Mears in Room 821.
I need you to get me the names of everyone who serviced this room in the last 24 hours.
Also, you need to get in touch with the waiter... who brought me my room service last night.
I need all of their numbers.
Home, cell, everything, yes.
Mears?
Dr. Cheever...
I think I'm sick.
What? What's going on?
What kind of symptoms do you have?
Can't swallow. Severe headache.
What's your temperature?
- Uh, listen, you can't-- You just--
- You can't panic now, okay?
- I know.
- Are you alone?
- I've definitely infected other people.
You don't know that.
- So, what should I do?
- Well, I want you to stay in your room.
I'll call the Health Department, tell them you're there.
- Erin, just-- You're gonna be okay.
- No, I know. I know.
- Okay.
- You gotta send somebody else.
Yes, but you don't worry about that right now, okay?
- Hey, I'm--
- You take care of yourself.
I'm sorry I couldn't finish.
That's-- Never mind that. Let me see what I can do about getting you back here.
- I'm gonna get you home if I can, healthy.
- Thank you.
- Now, you hang in there.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
The problem is, we just can't take delivery of the bodies.
We have insurance issues with our own employees... with our union, not to mention the health of the mourners, to consider.
I just--
I wanna bury my wife and my stepson... and have a service where our friends and our family can come... and pay their respects and grieve.
I understand, and I am truly sorry about your loss.
Have you considered other options?
How can they do that?
We have a family plot here.
They want us to think about cremation.
They just say that it's the safest thing in a situation like this.
I wanna be buried with my daughter and grandson... with Jack and my parents.
I want us all together.
They're not gonna take them, Sarah.
They're not gonna take the bodies.
I'll figure something out.
I'll figure something out.
She made mistakes, Mitch... but I know she loved you very much.
I'm gonna use some of these to get us some drinks, okay?
You have not reached Jon Neal...
but you will if you leave a message.
Hi. It's me. Um....
I checked the flights, and I can actually get an earlier flight... that would give me a five-hour layover in Chicago... so let me know if that's something that you'd like me to do.
- That's for you, okay?
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.
Thank--
- Emhoff gave it to the Ukrainian.
- That just shows contact.
Maybe it went the other way.
What about Li Fai?
- He was on the casino floor.
- Watch this.
Whoa. Oh, good. Okay, come on.
Let's get one together. Ready?
Cheers.
Mm.
Let's go.
That's him with Emhoff at 12:08.
I can show you the Ukrainian woman on the security camera in the elevator... going back to her room
20 minutes earlier.
She was gone before Li Fai started work.
It came from here.
Emhoff is the index patient.
We need to know everywhere she went before the casino.
I want to see her itinerary again.
They say the French and Americans have a cure.
They're manufacturing it in secret.
WHO knows, but they're in bed with the Americans.
- Who says?
- The Internet.
- The Internet? And you believe it?
- I don't know.
How's your mother?
We tried forsythia, but she wasn't strong.
There's a mass grave in Lan Tau.
I'm sorry.
I'm taking this to the ministry.
We need to send this to Geneva.
I need you to come with me.
- What are you doing?
- Please.
No.
What's going on? Sun Feng.
What's going on? What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
We couldn't wait any longer.
While they cure each other, we're here... at the end of the line.
This is what is left of my village.
- Are they sick?
- Not yet.
And we're gonna keep it that way.
You'll stay here with us until they find a cure.
How is that gonna help?
You're gonna get us to the front of the line.
Dr. Mears.
Dr. Cheever called again.
We're just having a hard time with the logistics of evacuating you.
Finding a plane and all.
I got your phone.
Dr. Cheever, he asked you to call if you feel up to it.
Now, we're setting up a special ward... for medical personnel and first responders at the university.
I wanna move you there... but the nurses' union is calling a work stoppage... until protocols are in place.
There are volunteers, but it's just....
It's hard right now to know where's the right place.
You're asking me to spend a lot of resources on one person... and right now, I can't do that.
Dr. Mears would agree with me.
She's one of our own, Lyle.
We sent her up there.
Okay, I sent her up there.
I would like to go get her back.
We have a plane with an isolation pod... to bring our people in the field home when they're sick, right?
What's going on, Lyle?
There's a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.
He was in Chicago over the holiday.
They're using the pod to fly him home.
Then they're closing down Midway and O'Hare.
The governor is calling the National Guard.
They're setting up roadblocks.
They're shutting down trade, public transportation.
The Teamsters are pulling drivers off the road.
- People are still gonna slip through.
- Yes, they will.
The Secret Service is moving the president underground.
Congress is figuring out how to work online.
When the word goes out... there will be a run on the banks, gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.
People will panic.
The virus will be the least of our worries.
It will tip over now.
We just need to make sure that nobody knows until everybody knows.
My temperature's 101.
Higher than it was earlier.
My head hurts... and my throat feels like it's closing.
This is forsythia.
I've been taking it since the onset of the symptoms.
If I'm here tomorrow, you'll know it works.
Truth Serum Now.
I'm Alan Krumwiede.
How many people are gonna die?
Well, in 1918...
1 percent of the population died from Spanish flu.
It was novel, like this, no one had ever seen it before.
- One percent of America?
- One percent of the world.
As many as 70 million people could die, baby, maybe more.
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know. We try to figure it out.
This is why I sent Mears up there, to Minnesota.
And now I can't get her back.
She's sick, Aubrey, and I can't do anything for her...
because there are no nurses.
- Why not?
- Because they're on strike.
- How can they do that?
- Because there's nothing they can do.
We're putting healthy people next to sick people... and hoping the healthy people don't get sick.
- I'm sorry, Ellis, but that's not your fault.
- I sent her up there, Aubrey.
If one in four are dying, that means three out of four are living, right?
So the odds are in her favor.
I want you to get in your car and drive down here to Atlanta now.
You hear me, Aubrey?
What are you talking about?
I want you to get in your car and leave Chicago.
I want you to drive here to Atlanta.
Drive by yourself.
You do it. You do it now.
Don't tell anyone and don't stop.
Stay away from other people, understand?
Keep your distance from other people.
Call me when you're on the road, Aubrey.
Roger.
Did you hear...?
I got people too, Dr. Cheever.
We all do.
Hello?
Hey, friend, what's up with blowing off dinner?
- I'm sorry, Liz.
- Why you so flaky? You feeling okay?
This flu sh--
Stuff is really spooky.
What does Ellis say?
He says it's--
He says it's serious.
What do you mean, serious?
Where are you?
- I'm getting out of town.
- What?
I'm gonna tell you something... and you're not gonna repeat it.
- Cover your mouth, please.
- Fuck off, lady.
We will only be able to give out 50 doses today.
- What?
- That's our allotment.
This is bullshit.
Hey. There-- Excuse me, there's a line here.
Excuse me!
Jesus.
Where's the fire department?
Is anyone even working here?
Just get the cereal.
- Jory, don't touch anything.
- Help me.
Okay, take your gloves off.
Here, give me your hands.
Okay. I want you to really rub this in.
Okay, okay, come on.
Come on, come on.
Hey, get away from there.
Get away.
Lock the door.
Get back in your car, sir.
Get back in your car.
- No, no, I'm not-- I'm immune.
- Stay back.
I've already had it.
- And my daughter's not sick.
- She's sick?
She's not, no.
We're just trying to get to Wisconsin.
The border is sealed.
The governor has declared a quarantine.
Get back in your car.
No, we don't wanna go back there.
We wanna go across.
- There is no way across. Get in your car.
- We're not sick.
Get back in your car or I will detain you.
Where?
Get in the car!
- What happened?
- We have to go home.
What are you doing here?
I think I had a seizure.
Oh.
I can't-- I can't find any in the stores.
I tried.
Look, I don't have any here.
People broke in.
I'm-- I'm pregnant, Alan.
And I have-- I have money.
I can give you some money.
Lorraine, you shouldn't be out.
- Please, Alan.
- Go home.
I'll bring it to you when I get it.
I was wondering if I could get another blanket.
This one's very damp now.
I'm truly sorry, sir.
We're out of blankets.
We're hoping for more to be donated.
We put the word out.
What about the heat?
Can we turn that up?
I'll find out.
- When did we run out of body bags?
- Two days ago.
We're trying to get more in from Canada, but they just wanna wait and see.
No more lies! No more lies! No more lies!
There are stories on the Internet that in India and elsewhere... the drug ribavirin has been shown to be effective against this virus.
Yet Homeland Security is telling the CDC not to make any announcements... until stockpiles of the drug could be secured.
Well, Dr. Gupta, there continue to be evaluations of several drugs.
Ribavirin is among them.
But right now, our best defense has been social distancing.
No hand-shaking, staying home when you're sick... washing your hands frequently.
Can you tell us, to date, how many people have died from this virus?
Very difficult. We're still working on, uh, confirming that number.
There are 50 different states in this country... which means there are 50 different
Health Departments... followed by 50 different protocols.
Let me bring Alan Krumwiede into this debate as well.
Uh, Alan's a freelance journalist.
Uh, he was the first to track the "Shinko Bus Man" video.
Uh, Alan, today on Twitter... you wrote that the truth about this virus is being kept from the world... by the CDC, by the World Health Organization... to allow friends of the administration to benefit from it...
both financially and physically.
Uh, there are therapies we know are effective right now, like forsythia... and they don't even appear on the CDC website.
On your blog, you also wrote... that the World Health Organization is in bed with pharmaceutical companies?
Because they are.
That's who stands to gain from this.
They're working hand in glove.
And the hand is reaching into our pockets.
The CDC is exploring forsythia and other homeopathic treatments.
But right now, there's no science to back any of these claims.
Or no way Dr. Cheever or the people who put him into power can profit from it.
We're not ruling anything out.
There are people who are sick, people who are dying, and we are doing--
They're not keeping us safe from this any more than--
We're concerned about every American citizen.
Dr. Cheever is being a bit disingenuous when he says "every American citizen."
We're working very hard to find out where this virus came from, treat it...
and vaccinate against it if we can.
We don't know all of that yet, we just don't.
What we do know is that in order to become sick...
you have to first come in contact with a sick person or something they touched.
In order to get scared, all you have to do is come in contact with a rumor... television or the Internet.
I think what Mr. Krumwiede is spreading is far more dangerous than the disease.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
- That's funny.
- What's funny?
You're funny, because if you check on Facebook... you'll find a communiqué attributed to Dr. Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaard... about the quarantine of Chicago hours before it was announced to the public.
That's why I think he's a bit disingenuous... when he says equal care for all and not just his friends.
Some pretty wild allegations here,
Dr. Cheever.
Can you tell us what communication appeared and when?
What is the nature of your relationship with Nygaard?
I'm not aware of anything attributed to me on any social network.
I'm sure you're not.
It is there. It is there.
Tell them what an R-nought of two really means, Dr. Cheever.
Teach them some math. Hm?
No? I'll do it.
On day 1, there were two people with it, and then there were four.
And then it was 16, and you think you've got it in front of you... but next it's 256, and then it's 65,000... and it's behind you, above you, and all around you.
In 30 steps, it's a billion sick.
Three months.
It's a math problem you can do on a napkin.
And that's where we're headed.
And that's why you won't even tell us the number of the dead... will you, Dr. Cheever?
But you'll tell your friends when to get out of Chicago... before anyone else has a chance.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
You just made it easy.
The only reason we're not taking this to the attorney general... is because we can't replace you right now.
But there's gonna be an investigation.
Do you understand that?
And we don't wanna see you in front of the cameras anymore.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did you come from?
- It's mutated.
- Which way, better or worse?
It's moved into an African HIV AIDS population.
The Durban cluster is highly divergent.
We have a new R-nought, Ellis.
It's not two anymore.
I thought you said once we could grow it, we could vaccinate against it.
We tried using dead virus combined with atrophins to boost immune response.
And?
No protective antibodies, a lot of dead monkeys.
- Can you get to the good news?
- Now we have to try a live attenuated virus.
- Like with polio?
- Exactly.
The only danger with a live virus... is the possibility that it will revert to wild type and kill the host.
And when will we know about that?
I'll ask the monkeys.
As of right now, the mortality rate is fluctuating... between 25 and 30 percent... depending upon underlying medical conditions... socioeconomic factors, nutrition, fresh water.
With the new mutation... we are predicting an R-nought of no less than four.
And without a vaccine, we can anticipate... that approximately one in 12 people on the planet will contract the disease.
Folks, attention.
We appreciate your patience and we're doing the best we can.
We have exhausted our supply of meals ready-to-eat for today.
What?
Please remain calm.
We'll be sending--
Please-- Hey.
Can we get some help over here?
Leave the park in an orderly fashion.
Help me!
- You okay?
- Thank you.
- Sorry, they got one of them.
- Get the trucks!
Get the trucks!
There's-- There's nothing in there!
As the death toll in the United States is now believed...
to have reached 2.5 million...
the president issued a statement today from an undisclosed location...
implementing mandatory curfews in major metropolitan areas...
after a second consecutive day of riots in Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and Phoenix.
Absenteeism in law enforcement is nearing 25 percent...
according to reports--
Because of the high volume of 911 calls...
please use the following directory:
If you have symptoms, please hang up and call 612-188-6336.
To report a death or for the removal of a body, please press 1.
Hello? Anybody home?
Hey, Mark?
Hey, Jor?
Jor?
I can't feel my hands.
That messed up my snow angel.
I'm fine, Jory.
If neither of us have it, then we can't give it to each other.
- Get away from her.
- Dad!
- Get away. Get away.
- Dad!
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.
Go home, Andrew.
Get up.
Are we even close?
If we even had a viable vaccine right now... we would still have to do human trials, and that would take weeks.
And then we would have to get clearance and approval... figure out manufacturing and distribution.
That would take months.
And then training survivors to give inoculations.
More months, more deaths.
Well, Homeland Security wants to know... if we can put a vaccination in the water supply, like fluoride.
Cure everyone all at once.
I'm going home now, Ellis.
It's getting late.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.
- Do you remember Dr. Barry Marshall?
Thought that bacteria caused ulcers, not stress.
Gave himself the bug and then cured himself.
You taught me about him.
I'm testing my vaccine.
No, this is different.
I don't want to get you sick.
Ally, you can't take that chance.
Oh, Dad, you're here because you stayed in your practice... treating sick people after everyone else went home.
You took that chance.
You took that chance every day.
What?
He won a Nobel Prize.
- Yes, I know, Dad. 
- Barry Marshall.
The Food and Drug Administration is accelerating approval...
of the MEV-1 vaccine...
currently in production at five secret locations in the U.S. and Europe...
saying the first doses could be available for human use within 90 days.
The WHO estimates that it could take nearly a year...
to manufacture and distribute the necessary amount of the vaccine...
to stop the spread of the virus...
which so far has taken over 26 million lives worldwide.
But as labs work around the clock to produce the life-saving formula...
the question remains:
Who gets it first?
- Don't touch me.
- Where is it?
- We don't have it.
- Bullshit. He works there. He gets it first.
We don't have it. We have to wait--
- Aubrey?
- Ellis?
Where are you?
It's because they saw you on the news and they heard about what happened.
- You all right?
- They knew where you worked.
They waited for you to leave.
- Get up here. Come on. Let me look at you.
- I tried to stop them.
I tried.
- Did they touch you? Did they look sick?
- They had masks on, Ellis, and gloves.
Don't tell me that--
Aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow.
You have to trust me, Ellis.
They didn't touch me.
After the Spanish flu in 1918, you know, people got rich.
The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people, look it up.
One man dies, another man makes money off his coffin.
One country culls all their chickens, red meat goes into higher demand.
I'm not the first person to make money... off the fact that our immune system is a work in progress.
The pharmaceutical industry do it every quarter.
I don't think anyone is immune to opportunity, Alan.
It's just that studies show that there is no proof that forsythia works.
Who conducted the studies?
What defines "works"?
Against what strain of the virus?
Did you know about the studies when we met the last time?
We can get in a lot of trouble--
Do you really think this Dr. Hextall
CDC person is Jesus in a lab coat?
The government rushed the trials.
The lawyers indemnified the drug companies.
Maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy or cancer
10 years from now.
Who knows?
You-- The--
The swine flu vaccine killed people back in 1976.
Nerve disease.
So we're all guinea pigs, starting from today.
Just wait, they'll start listing side effects like the credits at the end of a movie.
People trust you, Alan.
If you tell them not to take it--
That's right.
They trust me.
All 12 million unique visitors.
I'm a trusted man stepping up to a microphone... in front of a very large crowd.
That's who I am.
That's the brand.
I say the right thing, nobody shows up for their shot.
Maybe they'd rather roll the dice with forsythia.
I can make that happen.
I just wanna know
I'm in the best position possible when I do.
What does that mean, exactly?
If I'm gonna step into the crosshairs,
I wanna know what's in--
- Is he with you?
- What? Who?
Are you wearing a wire?
Alan, I didn't have a choice.
They've seen your blog.
Get him.
- Far enough, far enough.
- For what? Tell me, for what?
Securities fraud, conspiracy, and most likely manslaughter.
- It cured me. Forsythia cured me.
- We'll see, Alan.
This is entrapment.
You can't take my blood.
You can't, that's my property.
We may never know where this disease came from.
But we do know that this vaccine is the result... of the courage and perseverance of a remarkable few.
We shall now begin the drawing. John.
The first MEV-1 vaccination... are those people born on March 10th.
March 10th.
We remind all of you to stay 10 feet apart from each other... while on line.
Shouldn't you be downstairs?
I'm tracking vaccine batch numbers.
This is what you have to be doing right this minute?
This is what I want to do right this minute.
Take a bow, Ally.
People have for a lot less.
It's not that hard to give yourself an injection.
What about Mears or my father or you?
I'm gonna take a bow while you get hauled in front of Congress?
What do I say when they ask about that?
You tell them that I told a loved one who told a loved one... and that I'd do it again.
Without you--
Ally, you have saved millions of lives.
That's a great story.
It also happens to be true.
Now, how often can you say that?
The next citizens to receive the MEV-1 vaccination...
are those born on the date...
What is that? January 11th.
Okay. All right, 144.
That's-- There's still, uh, 200--
More than 200 birthdays, hon, that haven't been called, so that's good.
That's a good number.
- What if they run out?
- They're not gonna run out.
They have enough to keep up with demand.
They said that already.
Maybe I'm immune like you and I don't even need it.
That's not a chance we're gonna take.
So instead we lose spring, we lose summer... we lose another 144 days that don't happen again.
Why can't they invent a shot that keeps time from passing?
It's gonna start getting normal again, Jory.
How do you call this, "fish," in Chinese?
This is yú.
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.
It's time. We have to run.
He just landed.
I want you to keep drawing... and Assand will come and finish the class, all right?
I'll see you soon.
- See you.
- See you.
Tsuen Wan Cemetery off the Number 3 Expressway.
It's close to where you are now.
In 15 minutes.
One hundred doses.
Nobody from the ministry, no police.
If we see anybody else, any other vehicles, you'll never see her again.
Yes?
Yes, I'm fine.
Please give them what they ask.
I just wanna go home.
Once we have the vaccine, we'll tell you where to find her.
- Is it French or American?
- We could not get enough from the French.
It's been made here.
The same formula, though.
It is effective, I promise.
There, be careful.
Wait, where is she?
- We don't know what it is.
- Well, we have no choice.
Where is Dr. Orantes?
Now, wait, this is not what we agreed on.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm good.
Oh, I almost forgot.
- What's that?
- Your vaccine.
The one you took was a placebo.
What?
The Chinese insisted.
There have been many abductions, not just here.
In Russia, Mexico, all over.
Government officials, scientists, or Westerners with great wealth.
Mostly perpetrated by organized crime or revolutionary groups... trying to extort medicines.
The Chinese don't negotiate with kidnappers.
It wasn't up to us.
We've got a limited supply, just like everyone else.
Leo-- Leonora.
Where are you going?
Blood results came back, Mr. Krumwiede.
You never had the virus.
You have no antibodies. You lied.
Of course that's what your labs say.
Forsythia is a lie.
It's a lie, and you made $4.5 million for telling it.
You wanna blog about that?
You are going to go away, Mr. Krumwiede, and so is all your money.
I can't even imagine all the civil suits people are gonna file against you... and I have a pretty good imagination.
Now you wanna tell people not to get vaccinated... when that's the best chance they've got.
If I could throw your computer in jail,
I would.
Made bail.
Are we done here?
Evidently, there are 12 million other people as crazy as you are.
You made bail. Congratulations.
Cheever and wife.
Congratulate Aubrey for me.
I'd shake your hand, but I don't wanna set a bad example.
Um, we're gonna have an official reception when we can get everybody in one place... and we really hope you can be with us.
Sure. So are you ready for yours?
I've got mine.
No, I think she's gonna wanna do these together.
- I know she sprang for some champagne.
- Hm.
They have scheduled the hearings.
We'll both be expected to testify.
Right.
Good luck.
Head back, Anthony.
There you go.
Good job.
I can't give him the bracelet, but at least you know he'll be safe.
Yeah, beats waiting another seven months.
Okay, what do you say?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Anthony.
You know where this comes from, shaking hands?
No.
It was a way of showing a stranger you weren't carrying a weapon in the old days.
- Good job. Now go finish your homework.
- Okay.
Yeah.
You offered your empty right hand to show that you meant no harm.
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- I wonder if the virus does.
Well, Dr. Cheever, thanks.
Take care, Roger.
You too.
You're not gonna get in trouble for this, are you?
Will you be quiet?
My number is 287, Ellis.
If we weren't married,
I'd have to wait almost a year.
Then it's a good thing we're married.
Hold your head back.
I don't wanna give them another reason to go after you.
Will you please be quiet and hold your head back?
Okay, go.
- Good.
- Mm.
And go.
Good.
All right.
Like you said, baby... just taking care of everybody that's in my lifeboat.
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
Dad, are you coming?
Yep.
I'm just looking for the camera.
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbor in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[English - US]
'In a land of myth and a time of magic,
'the destiny of a great kingdom
'rests on the shoulders of a young man.
'His name?
'Merlin.'
What you are about to do will bring our enemies to their knees.
You didn't see their faces?
They had no faces.
What are they?
The Dorocha. They are the voices of the dead, my child.
For the tear to be created, it would require a blood sacrifice.
To seal it will require another.
If laying down my life will spare
Camelot, that is what I shall do.
Merlin, no!
We have to get him back to Gaius.
And abandon the quest?
He saved my life,
I won't let him die. If we don't get to the Isle of the Blessed, hundreds more will perish.
Let me take him.
Carrying a wounded man, alone?
It will take you two, or three days to reach Camelot.
Not if I go through the Valley of the Fallen Kings.
You cannot give up on the quest.
Sire, he's right.
This is my fault and I'm sorry.
Take me with you, please.
You'll die, Merlin.
You don't understand. Please, Arthur.
Do you ever do as you're told?
I have to go with you.
Merlin...
We need to leave.
Go!
Can you hear that?
Bees? Food.
You trying to get us killed?
We're riding to our deaths anyway.
It's good to give the horses a rest.
You're quiet.
That's what happens after three days listening to Gwaine.
You did the right thing, you know.
Merlin couldn't continue with us.
I should've saved him.
Ah! Ah! Ooh!
If anyone can get Merlin back to Camelot, Lancelot can.
Lancelot?
Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We bear you no harm.
We wish only to help.
What are you?
We are Vilia.
Spirits of the brooks and streams.
The tear in the veil has upset the balance of the world.
Good spirits as well as bad roam freely.
But this perilous state cannot continue for long.
Prince Arthur is riding to the Isle of the Blessed.
He intends to heal the veil.
He will need help from both of you.
My friend is sick.
I need to get him to Camelot.
Merlin is stronger than you give him credit for.
The young warlock has great power and a future that has been written since the dawn of time.
Do not worry.
Even now, my sisters begin to heal him.
You are tired.
You must rest.
I need to find shelter.
You are safe here.
But the Dorocha...
We will stay with you and protect you through the night.
By dawn, we'll be on the other side of the mountains.
You can't be serious.
These tunnels are crawling with wildeoren.
The tunnels will take days off our journey.
If we make it out alive. We'll cover ourselves in gaja berries.
Oh, sounds great!
It's your choice, Gwaine.
Wildeoren or Dorocha?
I know which I'd rather go for.
Me too.
Never knew you cared!
Quick!
Remind me again why we're wearing this disgusting paste.
Wildoeren are completely blind.
They rely totally on their sense of smell.
Gaja berries will mask our scent.
What are the chances of us not seeing a wildoeren?
None.
Shh!
Keep still.
Don't even breathe.
You fool! It's dead.
That one is, yes.
They hunt in packs.
Run!
We need more stretchers and sheets.
As many as we can find.
Gaius.
The guards were under orders to shut the gates at dusk. Whose orders?
Lord Agravaine's.
Gaius. Have you come to join us?
Why have you closed the city gates?
We have limited resources, Gaius.
As much as I'd like to, we simply can't feed and water the entire kingdom.
Surely the people have a right to be protected.
I would be putting Camelot in danger.
Starvation, disease.
You of all people must understand,
Gaius.
The gates will remain shut until we are free of the evil that plagues us.
Now, gentlemen, where were we?
My lords.
May I be granted permission to address the court?
Guinevere?
Prince Arthur taught me long ago that every citizen of Camelot is important.
He would never stand by and let them suffer.
He would help them if he could and we must do the same.
I feel the pain me as much as you, but we don't have a choice.
If we keep letting people in, our food will run out in days.
You are wrong.
Perhaps you would enlighten me?
Those outside the gates are landowners, farmers.
For days, they have been bartering their wares with the townsfolk in return for the safety of their hearths.
They bring with them far more than they take.
But how long before these wares run out?
Three days ago, Prince Arthur embarked on a quest to rid us of these creatures.
At worst, we have another three before he reaches his goal.
Or do you think he will fail?
Of course not.
Sire, she is right.
Very well.
Re-open the gates.
Merlin? Merlin!?
Shh!
Breakfast?
Merlin, what...?
What are you...? What?
You're meant to be... dying.
Sorry.
Here.
What's that for? Looks like you're going to fall over.
No, not as quick as Arthur.
Oh, yeah?
Come on, we need to catch up with the others.
No, you're going back to Camelot.
You might be. Merlin!
Say hello to Gaius for me.
Merlin!
Arthur can't finish this without us.
Arthur's right about you.
You don't ever do as you're told..
No.
They need to rest, sire.
Even Gwaine's gone quiet.
Sounds like a good reason to keep going.
My lady?
What news of the mighty Camelot?
As we planned.
The city is falling into wrack and ruin. And Arthur?
Last we heard, he had made it past Daelbeth.
Will we never be rid of him?
Patience, my lady.
Even if he makes it, the outcome will be the same.
Then what brings you here so early?
Something's wrong.
A minor irritant.
Guinevere. She takes it upon herself to speak out against me.
She's dangerous.
She's a servant. A spirited one perhaps, but a servant nonetheless.
No, you're wrong.
I have dreamt the future, and in it, that "servant" sits upon my throne.
I would rather drown in my own blood than see that day.
Then we must make sure it never comes.
I couldn't agree more.
We must make sure she never sees another dawn.
Where is Arthur?
I am unsure. Where is he?
The Prince is on a hunting trip, sire. When will he be back?
In a few days.
Is there something you need?
Your devotion to the king is most impressive.
There is something
I would like to discuss.
I wish to apologise.
Yesterday. I feel I let the prince down.
I'm grateful that you spoke out.
I didn't mean to be discourteous, my lord. Well, you weren't.
Not in the least.
Gwen, if you would permit,
I would be grateful to seek your advice.
You understand the people.
I'm not sure, I...
If nothing else, I know that you will be honest with me.
It's not appropriate to talk now.
Perhaps this evening, you could come to my chambers.
Please, Guinevere.
These are dark times.
I need help if I am to guide us through them.
Very well.
Thank you.
Is everything all right? Yes.
He wishes to speak with me later.
I think he means to seek my counsel.
Hello?
We can't stay here.
There's nowhere else, Merlin.
We'll make a fire.
It will keep us safe and dry.
And there's more than enough fuel to get us through the night.
Here.
Bael onbryne!
I'm not entirely useless, you know.
Halt!
But do the people feel safe?
You can speak honestly.
No, they do not.
Go on.
They are frightened.
Night after night, they have seen their friends, their children, their parents all snatched cruelly from them and they don't know who'll be next.
What can I do to reassure them?
Show courage.
Shutting the gates showed you were as terrified as them.
It's like a horse and its rider.
If the people sense your fear, they will not trust you.
I am grateful for your advice.
You have a wise head on your shoulders, Guinevere.
I have kept you long enough.
And I must see to the king.
Do not concern yourself with that.
I will ensure he is well looked after.
It has been a long day.
I'll have my guards walk you safely home.
Thank you.
Hleap on baec!
Seen anything?
Do you know what we're going to face on the Isle of the Blessed?
Do you want to tell me?
The burden is mine and mine to bear alone.
Look around, Arthur.
We would fight 1,000 armies with our bare hands for you.
You are never alone.
We stand together.
Come on, I'll take over.
You need some rest.
Thank you.
Gwen?
Gwen?
You don't have to continue on this journey with me.
Try and stop me.
Why? Because you're a knight, you feel honour-bound?
You wouldn't understand.
It doesn't make any sense to me either.
Gwen?
I made her a vow
I would keep Arthur safe.
You don't have to worry.
I'll keep him safe.
I made a vow, Merlin.
You still think about her?
No.
Arthur's a better man than me.
I'm sorry.
Why? He loves her... and she's happy.
I remember the guards walking me to my door... and then...
Nothing.
It's just a surface wound.
You were very lucky.
Everyone talks about the coldness, but I don't feel cold at all.
You weren't attacked by the Dorocha, Gwen.
Then what?
Gaius?
I fear someone wanted to do you harm.
Why?
I don't know.
If they did, they'd have done a better job.
Maybe. But cold-blooded murder is suspicious.
Better to leave you to the Dorocha.
Lancelot!
O drakon, e male so ftengometta tesd'hup'anankes.
It's all right. It's all right.
Thank you.
Who is your friend?
I am Lancelot.
Of course, Sir Lancelot.
The bravest and most noble of them all.
I'm not sure that is true.
We shall see.
For now there are more pressing things at hand.
The Dorocha cannot be allowed to remain in this world.
The sundered veil must be restored.
We are on our way to the Isle of the Blessed to help Arthur heal it.
Indeed. But at what price?
I know that the Spirit World demands a sacrifice.
It demands nothing, it is the Cailleach, the gatekeeper to the spirit world, who asks such a price.
And there is no other way?
There is not.
Arthur intends to sacrifice himself to heal the veil.
It is my destiny is to protect him, you taught me that.
Merlin, you must not do this.
Then I have no choice.
I must take his place.
From the moment I met you,
I saw something that was invisible.
Now it is there for all to see.
A lot of what you see, old friend... is what you taught me.
It will be an empty world without you, young warlock.
When we get to the Isle of the Blessed, do you really intend to sacrifice yourself?
What do you want me to say?
I look at you and I wonder about myself.
Could I knowingly give up my life for something?
You have to have a reason.
Something you care about.
Something that's more important than anything.
Looks like someone beat us to it.
Bandits?
Do you think we'll make it before nightfall?
There's only one way to find out.
Has something died?
Why am I always the butt?
Can't think.
Pick on Percival.
Why me?
He washes.
And he doesn't set fire to his socks.
No!
Quiet.
Lancelot? How's Merlin?
Bad news...
He's still alive.
Merlin!
Good to see you, Merlin.
Yeah, good to see you too.
It's going to be fine.
Everything will be all right.
I'm just tired.
You don't have to sacrifice yourself.
I have to save my people.
I will take your place.
Merlin...
What is the life of a servant, compared to that of a prince?
A good servant's hard to come by.
I'm not that good. True.
One thing...
Look after Guinevere.
I want her to be happy in her life.
She deserves that.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure.
The Isle of the Blessed.
What is that?
I really hope I'm wrong.
Wyvern!
You're right!
S'enthend' apokhorein nun epello-o-o!
See? That's how you deal with them.
We need to keep moving.
Sire, you must go on.
We'll fend them off.
It is not often we have visitors.
Put an end to this.
I demand you heal the tear between the two worlds.
It was not I who created this horror.
Why should it be I that stops it?
Because innocent people are dying.
Indeed?
Is this the best you can do?
I know what you want.
Do you?
And are you willing to let me have it?
I'm prepared to pay whatever price is necessary.
Forb fleoghe!
So, Emrys, you choose to challenge me after all.
Will you give yourself to the spirits to save your prince?
It is my destiny.
Perhaps.
But your time among men is not yet over, Emrys, even if you want it to be.
No! No!
No!
N-No...
'I want to pay tribute to Sir Lancelot.
'We owe him a great debt.
'But it is not just his deed that we will never forget.
'It is his courage,
'his compassion,
'his unselfish heart.'
He was the most noble knight
I will ever know.
He gave his life for all of us.
He didn't sacrifice himself for Camelot.
I asked him to look after you and he promised me with his life.
He was true to his word.
Arthur was lucky.
And Guinevere? It was only by chance that Gaius found her.
You're wrong. We were not thwarted by luck, it was Emrys. Emrys?
The Cailleach warned me about him.
She said he was my destiny and my doom.
It was he that thwarted us,
I'm sure of it.
So what is to be done?
As long as he exists, I will never gain what is rightfully mine.
You must help me find this 'Emrys' and destroy him.
Gaius?
How can I be of assistance?
You're a man of great knowledge and wisdom.
Knowledge, perhaps.
Have you ever come across a sorcerer called Emrys?
No, it doesn't sound familiar.
Well, if you do hear mention of the name...
I'll be sure to tell you.
It will not go unrewarded.
There is only one person could've heard that name...
Morgana.
We know her powers are growing.
She too must've seen the Cailleach.
But Agravaine...?
I suspect he is not as virtuous as he seems.
And don't forget, he has every reason to despise Uther.
We must beware, Merlin.
Morgana can never know the truth.
She must never know who you really are.
We must make sure this is a celebration that the young prince will never forget.
You can't die. If you were me, would you use magic to save his life?
Yes, I would do whatever it took.
You can't risk exposing yourself like this, it's too dangerous.
You think Uther is going to thank you for healing him with magic?
If it works, I won't have to hide any more. You!

ANNOUNCER: Death Race, the number one sport in the world,
located on Terminal Island.
Convicts race over the course of three grueling days
for the chance at the ultimate prize.
Win five races, win your freedom.
Preorder the next
Death Race now
and you'll not only get 20% off,
but you'll also receive limited edition Frankenstein merchandise.
Frankenstein, the four-time
Death Race champion,
has taken the world by storm.
The most unlikely of heroes
who has come out of nowhere
and is now just one win away from freedom.
Death Race.
Now streaming live.
Death Race is the trademark of Weyland International.
Your safety's our top priority.
FEMALE REPORTER: The notorious Death
Racer known only as Frankenstein
won his fourth race today.
One more victory and the masked killer gains his freedom.
Frankenstein fears nothing.
Anything in his way, he destroys.
Under my watch, Terminal Island and Death Race have thrived.
REPORTER: Rumors have been going around that Weyland International,
the organization behind Death Race,
has been targeted for hostile takeover.
As a businessman, takeover talk is common.
You have something of value, naturally, people want to take it away.
REPORTER: British billionaire, Niles York,
has placed himself in the center of a firestorm.
Well, I've got nothing to say about that at the moment.
But I will say this.
When I want something, no one can stop me from taking it.
I'm not too concerned. I've won more battles than I've lost.
I feel bad for Weyland,
I really do.
But Father Time, he's caught up with the old man.
He never really stood a chance.
Good morning,
Mr. Weyland.
Wasn't so bad, was it?
I built this business.
I didn't have to steal it.
What you left vulnerable,
I seized. I stole nothing.
You lacked vision, Weyland.
That was your undoing.
Vision.
Is that why you're investing millions in dilapidated prisons all around the globe?
Vision?
You're so far over your head, you might as well be six feet under the ground.
The prison business is not what made this company profitable.
So the conclusion to draw, you're trying to franchise Death Race.
It's not going to work.
Because you couldn't make it work.
Let me show you what true vision really looks like.
You started something beautiful, Weyland.
But you only scratched at the surface.
And you're right. I'm taking Death Race global.
By this time next year, there will be a different race every two weeks at a different exotic hellhole with different drivers, tracks and challenges.
I will have a monopoly on the most profitable sport in the history of the planet.
More cars.
More cons. More guns.
More death.
The sky's the limit.
Well, you forgot one thing.
Frankenstein.
It's a man in a mask.
I could have 20 Frankensteins around the globe.
How would the fans know which one was real?
Frankenstein won his fourth race today.
One more win, he goes free.
That's a fact that every fan knows.
Now, if you suddenly change the rules of the game, you're going to lose your audience.
And if you're hoping that Frankenstein loses, well, son, I guess there's a first time.
Now, how would your little copycat event play without the game's marquee star?
That's why you're going to fail.
What kind of cigars you smoke, Weyland?
I'll be sure to send you a box when
Death Race becomes a global success.
It'll be the second time I've beaten you.
The second time you've lost.
Well, you enjoy your moment while you can.
Payback's a bitch, son.
NILES: Weyland's right.
Find out who the man behind the mask really is.
What he loves, what he hates, what he covets most.
And find out what Weyland was planning next.
What do you mean?
The company's banking nearly eight million quid a week hawking Frankenstein merchandise.
He wasn't just gonna let it go.
Anything else?
Yeah. Get yourself some decent clothes.
You look like a bag lady.
I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have clone all this unless I absolutely loved Death Race.
So I'm speaking to the millions of fans around the globe.
Fear not.
I am like you.
I seek not to destroy nor to compromise what we've all come to revere.
The Death Race that we all know and love will not change.
It will grow bigger and better.
This, I promise.
Thank you.
DR. KLEIN: Overall, I have to say I'm very happy.
You wanna take a look?
No.
We'll run a few more tests tomorrow, and you're back to your old self in no time.
WEYLAND: No, he won't.
He'll be better.
Everybody out.
You heard the man.
Take a coffee break, guys.
So, I guess the rumors are true.
Yeah, and I guess you won't be shedding any tears for me.
Hey, you and I, Carl, we've taken very different paths in life.
But we both ended up here.
No, I'm here.
You come and go as you please, see the ones you love.
They see you.
Don't compare us, Weyland.
You lost the company.
I lost my life.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, and I also fixed your face and I gave you a way out.
Look at me and tell me you were gonna keep your word.
I'm not stupid, Weyland.
And you didn't fix my face out of the kindness of your heart, did you?
It was infected.
I was gonna die.
And you would have lost your star driver.
Yeah, you're not so bad.
You're worse.
And you want me to trust you?
You deserve the shit-storm you're in.
Well, I got news for you, Carl.
You're already in waist-deep.
You're Frankenstein.
This all starts and ends with you.
WEYLAND: Carl Lucas.
Born a gangster,
became a prisoner,
and now, a monster.
May he rest in peace.
You and your team win five races
and you go free.
Goldberg, Lists
and that beautiful, beautiful Katrina.
Now, for this to work,
you can't tell your true identity to anyone.
Carl Lucas stays dead.
You're Frankenstein.
GOLDBERG: Well, you're welcome, asshole.
Four wins and not even a thank you.
WEYLAND: This all starts and ends with you.
There he is.
There's the guy.
I'm having you transferred.
You're headed to the Kalahari Desert
Maximum Security Penitentiary in South Africa where you will compete in the first ever Desert Death Race.
Wow. What do I get, my own dune buggy?
You’re just on loan to the Kalahari to help launch the first of what will be many international Death Races.
We're sending 14K, as well as both your teams.
So I'm guessing I should get my passport updated.
I get the feeling that you are not taking me seriously.
That's because I'm not.
Listen to me. I made a deal with Weyland.
I win one more race, me, my team, we're out.
Yeah, well, you know, it's a pity about Weyland, because all deals with him are null and void.
You work for me now.
New rules.
No.
No, I don't think so.
You don't have a choice, mate.
But if you don't want to drive, fine.
I will paint my plane red with your blood.
Really?
Niles?
What are you gonna do, replace me?
With Who?
Why would you care?
You're already dead.
So, as long as you're alive, you'll be treated like the star that you are.
Or,
I could just simply fuck up your little plan, couldn't I, by winning one more race and I'm free.
Wow. You'll never make it to the finish line, mate.
Trust me on that.
You lose, you live.
You win, you die.
GUARD: Okay, get out!
Let's go, move!
MAN: Bring that jackhammer here.
GUARD: Get in the line!
Get moving!
PRISONER: Boy, take a look at those!
Move your fuckin' arse.
Who's that?
MAN: Hey, Goldberg!
PRISONER:
Yeah, that's right.
I'm a big fan. But we've got our own bitches down here.
I don't know why you brought yours along.
Hey, let me give you an autograph.
Move! Move!
Let's take this fucking joint!
Kill them all!
GUARD 1: Set up a perimeter now.
GUARD 2: On the ground, now!
Shit!
Get up! (GROANS)
Are you hurt? What?
Lucas.
It always was you.
You son of a bitch!
We thought you were dead.
So it's always been you behind the mask.
Yeah, it's a long story.
So what kind of deal did they make, huh?
I didn't have a choice.
Whatever it was, it included getting your face fixed.
I saw it.
I was there.
Did you, Goldberg?
Or did you just see what they wanted you to see?
What did they want us to see?
That is no deal.
You never needed to make a deal.
All you had to do was win five races in a row and you're free.
Those are the rules.
There are no rules in the cage, Lists.
At least none that benefit the cage.
Believe what you want,
Goldberg.
But I don't think it's wise, right now, that they see us together.
Welcome to hell.
Keep moving, don't stop!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Welcome to Kalahari Prison.
You dare try and escape, the desert will kill you before we do.
Come on, move!
(SHOUTING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You all right?
GUARD: Close the gate.
Hey, Goldberg.
She's bigger and better.
Way bigger.
Way better.
I've been through more shit in my life than most people go through in 10.
But what I never did was lie or betray my friends.
Doesn't matter what your intentions were, your secret would have been safe with us.
We could've helped.
You know better than that.
Helping me comes with a price, and
I wasn't about to let you do that.
You believe in curses?
This thing.
It comes with one.
You should've trusted us.
Let's go, Lists.
ANNOUNCER: Live from Kalahari
Prison in South Africa,
this is Death Race
Navigator Wars.
Featuring 16 of the most beautiful,
ruthless and lethal convicts alive,
including an IRA terrorist, a contract killer,
even identical twin serial killers.
But all eyes will be on Katrina Banks,
the gorgeous copilot of the notorious Frankenstein.
This is a match to the death.
The only rule, survive.
What the hell is happening?
Good evening and welcome to a special pre-Death Race event.
Sixteen beautiful, yet deadly women, vie for 10 spots as Death Race navigators.
These ladies will battle to the death to see who's worthy to navigate in tomorrow's Death Race.
ANNOUNCER: After the first three minutes,
pressure plates activate a variety of lethal weapons.
The fight ends when
10 ladies are left alive.
Katrina's statistical probability of survival is very low.
And the Swedish twins aren't gonna fight each other.
Plus, Katrina's celebrity will attract more attention.
That changes the odds.
So, what are you saying?
Seven to 10%.
Best case scenario.
ANNOUNCER: Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.
Katrina, kick some ass!
Do I know my audience or what?
That's reality TV shit.
Come on.
Yes.
ANNOUNCER: Pressure plates are now active.
SATANA: Go in tighter.
Go in tighter.
Get me a close-up!
Kill!
Do you want some popcorn with that?
I don't need...
GOLDBERG: Get to the weapons, Katrina!
MAN: Come on, cook her ass!
Camera five, close-up!
Katrina Banks.
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Take this!
Good work, good work!
Watch out!
MAN: You love me to death!
(SOBBING) No!
Oh, man, I really thought both twins were gonna make it, the way they hyped 'em up and all, you know?
Never believe your own hype.
Don't miss that shot!
ANNOUNCER: Ten women remain who'll compete as navigators in tomorrow's Death Race.
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.
(LAUGHS) Relax, Prudence. There's nothing for you to fear here.
They may be ruthless, vicious murderers and rapists, but they've taste enough to ignore you.
It's race time, motherfuckers!
Don't touch me. I'm feeling a little fragile this morning.
FEMALE GUARD:
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Good to see you, too.
Drop dead.
FEMALE GUARD: Come on, move! Good idea.
But I already tried that.
Next!
Next in line.
(GROANS) Next!
Nice. Thank you.
Another one. Next!
What do you think you're putting inside of me?
Let him go. He's just doing what he's told to do.
Unlike Terminal Island, there are no walls here.
We didn't want our drivers dashing for their freedom.
This will tell us exactly where you are at all times.
So, I go off-course, what happens?
You're not familiar with the German-made
Iris-T Infra-red Smart missile?
No.
You go off-course, and you will be.
Just as there's no escape from Kalahari, there is no escape from Death Race.
Well, ain't that somethin?
Mr. York. While you are here, I want you to know that I am at your disposal.
Anything your heart desires, consider yours.
Anything?
Please do take a seat.
ANNOUNCER: Streaming live from the
Kalahari Prison in South Africa,
home to the most ruthless and violent criminals the world has ever seen.
Niles York presents Death Race.
Eleven drivers will compete over three brutal days
across one of the most dangerous terrains on Earth
for a chance at the ultimate prize.
Win five races, win your freedom.
Lists?
There's a speaker and mic here, so no more headsets.
But the weapon trigger's still in the same place.
Okay.
There are no shields out here.
Only offensive weapons.
Weapon locations are marked on the map, indicated here on the tablet.
Now, remember, you have to drive through, not over, to activate.
LUKE: You think this thing's gonna be like a Baja race?
The only thing
I know about Baja, it's a style of tacos I like.
Goldberg,
I'm gonna need you on this one.
I got your back.
Three things you gotta worry about.
Razor.
GOLDBERG: He'd rather kill us than win.
Nero.
Checkered flag has nothing to do with winning.
Okay.
So what's the third?
Third, it's that beautiful girl sitting next to you.
Let's get it ready for an online broadcast.
Let's make a tight MCU.
Camera 15, 10 and eight.
Thanks.
Gotcha.
Katrina.
Don't.
I don't wanna hear it.
You're my nav-girl.
You, do you speak English?
I speak English, you fucking idiot.
Let's just fucking win this race.
Wow, this is gonna be great.
The first official race of this kind started in Tijuana, Baja
California on October 31st, 1967 and was called the NORRA
Mexican 1000 Rally.
The course length that year was
849 miles, or 1,366 kilometers, and ended in La Paz,
Baja California Sur, sir.
The overall winning time was 27 hours, 38 minutes set by Vic Wilson and Ted Mangels while driving a Meyers Manx buggy.
Who're you talking to?
Thought you'd appreciate some relative historical perspective.
Well, you thought wrong.
Set the lights.
Number 10, pan to your left.
ANNOUNCER: All eyes are on Frankenstein, as he tries to win his fifth race
and become the first inmate to win his freedom.
The mysterious Frankenstein became a worldwide phenomenon
after winning his first four Death Races.
But that was back on Terminal Island.
Can he repeat that success here in Africa?
Three.
Unique challenges lay ahead as our drivers
move from the confines of Terminal
Island's track onto three desert courses.
Two.
The carnage is about to begin.
What the fuck are you doing?
He's jumping.
We've got a jumper.
Fire away.
What about our trackers?
You know something?
What are you doing?
Get out of here, man!
It's coming, it's coming!
Oh, my God, what are you doing?
It's here, it's here, it's here.
ANNOUNCER: And The Jackal becomes a Death Race first.
Never before has a driver been killed before the race has even begun.
Reset lights.
Stupid.
That's entertainment.
Well, that worked well.
For us. (LAUGHING)
Go.
Go.
Start! Start!
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker!
Whoa!
Look at the fuckers!
ANNOUNCER:
Introducing Olga Braun.
Do you want me to drive?
Fuck, it's...
ANNOUNCER: Death Race's
first ever female driver.
Yeah! Come on.
Start! Start! Start!
You're a freak.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Goldberg. You getting me?
You online?
Are you ready to get serious now?
The roads are narrow, so pass only on the turns.
Weapons are inactive until mile marker 25.
Lists, what's my top speed on this thing?
100 miles per hour, but you wanna keep it somewhere between 50 and 60.
Forget everything you know about racing.
Desert racing isn't about speed.
It's about endurance and handling.
Hang on a minute. I thought you didn't know shit about this kind of racing.
I don't. It's the first thing that came up on Google.
ANNOUNCER: The racers enter the first leg of the race,
the sand dunes of Katbakkies Pass.
He's right behind you!
WOMAN: Hey, stop driving like a pussy.
Where I'm coming from, the ladies, they can drive better than this.
Turn hard right.
When?
Now!
You wanna fucking drive?
Could you just not talk?
Just don't talk.
Shut up.
GOLDBERG: Luke! You need to find the weapon marker again.
Fuck!
(LAUGHS) That was fucking great!
I see weapon markers on the right.
Yeah, I see it.
You see the tracking markers straight ahead. (BEEPING)
You think I'm blind?
Fuck off, man.
Frankenstein!
LUKE: Motherfucker!
GOLDBERG: Razor's weapons are activated!
Come on, turn the cannon, turn the cannon around.
WOMAN: Go faster!
We have to show them how it's done.
Are you gonna take this shit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. China.
Did you get that, China?
Turn them in. Turn them in.
Yeah!
Activate the cannon.
Cannon activated.
Joker's got a cannon trained on you.
Look out! Behind you!
Let's light this puppy up.
Bye. bye. bye.
LUKE: Come on!
Fuck him up.
Are you okay,
Mr. Frankenstein?
You know what? I never thought
I'd miss the Tombstone.
Goldberg.
I need your help.
Don't shake him off! Let him get right up behind you.
Goldberg, are you crazy?
Come on!
I'm getting sick of this bastard.
Oh, beautiful.
What you're doing is illogical.
Oh, God, that felt good.
We can't take much more of this.
Stay on the wheel,
Luke. Trust me!
Fucking idiot!
ANNOUNCER:
Who's laughing now, Joker?
You know, I gotta tell you something.
I am very, very impressed.
Nice, Goldberg.
Fuck logic.
Sometimes you just gotta let your heart and gut tell you what's right.
ANNOUNCER: Two Death Racers down. Nine remain, as we enter Khayelitsha Township.
Damn!
Shit.
Go left, left, left, left, left.
ANNOUNCER: Weapons activated for this sector only.
Take left!
This is Africa, son of a bitch!
These people got a damn death wish. Off the fucking road!
Son of a bitch!
We need to get outta here!
WOMAN: No, stay with the car!
The tracking device! (SCREAMS)
Let's go!
Come on! Run!
We've got a runner.
Who?
Pretty Boy's left his car.
We've got a lock on him.
Fire.
He's in the middle of a town. Won't you kill a lot of innocent people?
They will be rewarded in their next life.
Fire when ready.
Shit!
Out of my way!
Fuck!
Watch out, watch out.
TAZMANIAN DEVIL: No!
Fucking beautiful.
MAN: They are coming here!
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Seven drivers remain,
as they enter the last leg of stage one.
The lost zone.
Shit!
Hey, Lists, do you know anything about these guys?
LISTS: They're the warlords of Kalahari.
They're responsible for exactly 74.5% of all organized crime in the region.
Drugs, prostitution, kidnapping are their three biggest earners.
Great, just what we needed.
Let it go, Luke.
Just finish the race.
Shit. Are these people even in the game?
Just move out of my fucking way!
WOMAN: This, fucking 14K!
He's coming up behind us. Bitch!
Luke, you're in second place.
You have to pass Razor.
You're on the last corner before the finish line.
Come on, Luke, push!
ANNOUNCER: Razor takes day one.
Damn!
Frankenstein finishing a close second.
14K, Olga, Baby, Psycho and Nero have all survived.
That was amazing, Satana.
Incredible job.
I think it's cause for a celebration, don't you?
Prudence.
Fuck off and tell the rest of them to fuck off, too.
Everybody out.
I said, everybody out!
Keep moving! Come on, get out, everybody!
Hey, you did well today.
You see, you wanna fuck me now don't you?
You wanna fuck me now.
God, she wants to fuck me now. Typical.
Do you really wanna fuck me now?
Katrina. Look, I know
I fucked up, okay?
I was just trying to protect you.
It wasn't safe for you to know.
We can't be what we were.
Second place.
You're slipping.
Yeah.
Lists, let's get this thing cleaned up.
Frankenstein!
Oh, no fucking way!
What the hell is going on?
GUARD: A fight in the tunnel.
It's Frankenstein.
Get him out of there. Now!
Now, get out!
Doctor!
We need a doctor!
Doctor!
George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Crazy Horse,
Henry III of France,
Henry IV of France.
Am I gonna be all right?
You're gonna be fine.
It's just a scratch.
Now I'm gonna need you to drop your trousers.
Is that necessary?
What? Am I all right?
You're going to be fine.
What I probably should have disclosed, I'm a big fan of yours.
How big?
Singer/songwriter Elliott Smith and, of course, Julius Caesar.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm listing the most notable stabbing victims.
He's gonna be okay.
I gotta see him.
How is he?
Wonderful.
As girls, I thought it would only be fitting to offer Frankenstein, our new celebrity, an incentive, a prize, a free fuck.
WOMAN: All right, honey!
Amber, get up, move it.
Hurry UP-
Get it, girl!
Say bye to your boyfriend, honey.
Fucking bitch!
WOMAN: Someone's fucking your boyfriend!
A gift.
Frankenstein?
Yeah.
So,
I was hoping that we could discuss the terms of our contract.
I was thinking six races per year, three year guarantee.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
And how much did you have in mind?
I got Martine to put together a bid.
Oh, you did, did you?
You gotta be kidding, right?
I believe that it's fair.
Do you know what? Let's just see how this one concludes tomorrow before we discuss any future races.
But I gotta tell you, lam very, very pleased with how things are going so far.
I didn't think it would be this easy.
What do you mean?
I was expecting issues with the freak.
They told me he was a monster.
He's a pussycat.
Do not underestimate him.
I made a deal with the guy. I was expecting him to renegotiate. But he didn't.
He's planning something.
Hmm.
Stop fucking me with your eyes and let's get on with this.
FEMALE GUARD: What the fuck is going on here?
The first time you see a white nincompoop naked?
Come on, move!
Damn it! Come on. Shit.
What's up, baby?
Hey.
Let's do it.
Where's Lucas?
GOLDBERG:
What are you doing here?
Truth time.
Look, I had my reasons.
But I haven't been straight with you.
And I'm sorry for that.
But I wanna make this right.
Well, then don't lie to us again.
Okay. Look, there's something you all need to know about the race.
I did make a deal with the new boss.
To lose.
To lose? You'll have a tough time losing in this car.
I know. He had a gun to my head.
He had a gun to all of your heads.
So, I made a new deal.
And this is what we're gonna do.
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to stage two of Death Race.
Seven drivers remain.
Sit back, relax.
The carnage is about to begin.
Log on and get inside access on your favorite drivers.
For an additional cost, you can tap in
to the closed circuit camera inside the driver's car.
Death Race.
It's a beautiful day
to die.
Nero is in the lead, followed by Frankenstein,
14K, Razor and Olga.
The surprising Psycho is sixth.
And Baby is seventh.
So, weapons are active now, yes?
Yes and no.
There's a little twist.
Ooh!
ANNOUNCER: The racers approach Keiskie
Road, heading towards the dry lake.
GOLDBERG: Look, they're throwing you a curve ball.
That weapons marker you see is the last one for 25 miles.
First one through it gets the weapons.
But if you die, the weapon marker reactivates.
So, everyone's gonna be on your ass.
It's because I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't, right?
You got it, homes.
Exactly.
There's the weapon marker.
Weapon marker's coming up on your left.
KATRINA:
Okay, over there.
Luke!
Almost, almost, come on!
Come on, make it! Yes!
ANNOUNCER: Olga wins the weapons marker.
Fuck it.
Hey, sorry, ladies.
Those aren't ladies.
(LAUGHS) Don't get jealous.
Get your eyes back on the road.
Sure.
WOMAN:
There's Olga, up ahead.
Fuck!
Fucking bitch.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
Why?
'Cause they're all after us now.
Fuck this!
Man, you get the bitch out of the way. Come on!
I'm a bad man.
Oh. yeah!
Oh, shit!
Yeah!
Knock this bitch out the way.
Kiss your fucking ass.
Whoo!
I told you.
What you gonna do, bitch?
What you got?
Come on. Come on.
OLGA: Eat this!
Oh, shit!
Weapon marker's dead ahead.
Okay.
ANNOUNCER: The double kill leaves only five cars in the race,
as they head into
Calvinia Township.
Jesus, somebody pissed them off.
I don't think they're friends.
They really don't like us.
Yeah, I'm getting used to that.
Why don't you warm up that flame thrower?
Finally!
Watch out!
Come on!
Fucking roll, will you?
Whoa!
Holy shit, that's awesome!
Okay. It's like that, huh?
Damn it!
Fucking fire.
All right.
Son of a bitch!
Yeah!
KATRINA: Luke! Watch,
Razor's coming closer.
He's coming up behind us.
Do you wanna play?
Let's end this.
Bitch!
WOMAN: You fucker.
Man. I'm sick of this asshole.
I can see you, devil!
What?
What the fuck are you doing?
Get off me.
This is just so fucking beautiful.
ANNOUNCER: And that marks the end of Nero.
As we enter the final stage, we 're down to the final four.
Driving back through
Loeriesfontein to the finish line.
Let's see what the warlords of
Kalahari have in store today.
Weapon markers ready for activation.
WOMAN: Okay, we're clear.
LUKE: Get me weapons now.
Hang on.
Where's he going?
We're not done yet.
What the fuck you want?
What are you doing?
Huh?
What's who doing?
You Will die!
KATRINA:
What was that for?
To save your ass.
Go, go, go.
We got company.
Shit!
Camera two, pick that up.
Motherfucker!
Who the fuck are these people?
It's okay. I got it.
Coming up behind you.
Die, you bastard!
This is just fucking awesome.
Yeah.
You can't run, motherfucker!
This is gonna be close.
KATRINA:
What now, Luke?
It's on.
Camera two, pan in.
Camera two, move it!
SATANA: Let's not lose that shot, boys. Come on.
Move it, move it. Do you wanna miss the fucking shot?
Awesome.
ANNOUNCER: Day two concludes with a bang.
Tune in tomorrow for the epic conclusion.
Any rebroadcast or unauthorized use is punishable by death,
or life in prison if under the age of 15.
I didn't know he had a child.
Shocking how little we know about the ones closest to us.
I know virtually nothing about my secretary here.
Conversely, she knows every aspect of my life, personal, business, good, bad and ugly.
Turn around and face me.
I'm sorry to hear about Goldberg.
I never knew the man, but I know how integral he was to your team.
What possible understanding can a man like you know about that?
He was more than just a part of my team.
He was family.
Hmm.
Just to be clear, our deal still stands. Yes?
Now, don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.
14K will win tomorrow.
You're gonna stall out. Officially, mechanical failure resulted in your loss.
I don't want it to look like you were beat.
Can't damage your rep now, can we?
Are we clear?
When I ask you a question, you answer me.
Do you understand?
No. Not really.
Now get these foolish thoughts of winning out of your head.
You will lose tomorrow, or so help me God,
I will put you in the deepest, darkest cell I can find.
And while you're down there, crying about that dead spic, just imagine what I'll be doing to your girlfriend.
Bad idea.
What are you gonna do?
Threaten to kill me?
No.
No, Niles.
That would be letting you off too easy.
You can live tomorrow, but you can't win.
Maybe. Guess you'll just have to tune in, huh?
Like everybody else.
No, no, no, no.
I need to talk in private.
I hear you.
Is there something you wanna say to me?
I was just wondering if you are the original
Frankenstein.
And why is that?
Think about it.
Who is the man behind the mask?
Hmm? Does anybody know?
They just want the monster.
And they can take you out in a way that would kill a normal human being, and then just slap the suit on the next guy and hey, presto.
Frankenstein lives.
You think they're gonna kill me?
No. Frankenstein can never die.
He can be shot. He can crash and burn.
He can explode.
But Frankenstein will always emerge.
Battered and bruised, maybe. But alive.
Just makes his legend even greater.
(PSYCHO MIMICKING
REVVING ENGINE)
Yes. Yes, he spoke to me.
NILES: What are you doing?
What is the meaning of this?
This is my business.
This is my production.
No, this is my production. Mine!
And your network was more than eager to sell it and you out.
Guess you won't be needing that bid now.
I'll give you a free pass for that one.
But if you try anything like it again, and I will have you chained up and
I personally will pimp you out to the nastiest fucking psychos in this prison.
Hey, you, stop.
Guard.
Let her through.
All of you.
Leave us.
SATANA: I thought it would only be fitting to offer Frankenstein,
our new celebrity, an incentive, a prize,
a free fuck.
So did you...
Sleep with her?
No.
And you know why
I didn't. Right?
Hey, you.
Get back to work!
Go.
I won't let you down.
Though I don't have any statistical evidence to back up that statement,
I feel strongly...
Lists, there's no one, no one I'd rather have watching my back.
Thanks, Luke.
(SIGHS) Do you mind?
Let's do this.
NILES: Okay, people, listen up.
Whatever happens today,
Frankenstein cannot win.
So, keep your eyes open.
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the final stage of Death Race.
All eyes are on one man.
Frankenstein. He's been the most dominant driver in Death Race history.
But can he hold on for one more day and win to earn his freedom?
Torch these bitches.
Let your heart and gut guide you.
You can do this.
You can do this.
Luke, watch out for turn three.
It's a massive turn.
I don't like this music.
Can you get something else?
God, I hate this music.
Yeah, that's nice. Yes.
ANNOUNCER: Frankenstein continues to hold a slim lead,
as the drivers reach
Red Rock Road.
Leaving sector. Weapons must be reactivated.
Weapons marker coming up.
LUKE: Come on, play nice, motherfucker.
Hang on, Katrina.
I've had enough of this guy.
Hold on.
Yeah? It's nice.
Adiós amigo.
(LAUGHS) Cool.
Get out!
You bastard, Razor! I'm still alive and coming for you!
No!
Water! Help!
Help me! Water.
ANNOUNCER: The Psycho's death leaves only Frankenstein,
14K and Razor left alive to compete.
The racers enter the quarry, heading to the finish line.
Frankenstein just got weapons, and he's in the lead, about to win.
He's gonna need more than that.
Ready the missiles.
You wanna kill Frankenstein while the whole world watches, the audience will never forgive you.
You will kill the fucking show.
It is mine to fucking kill!
Target's locked.
PRUDENCE: He's too close to the finish line.
You could kill dozens of people.
You know what, Prudence? You're right.
You're always right.
You're fired.
You're still here?
Get out of my sight now!
Okay.
Fire.
Hey, guys. Get ready for some company.
Shit.
It's the tracking device.
Oh, fuck.
What?
Activate countermeasures!
We're not gonna make it through this.
Oh, shit.
Activated.
Fire!
No way.
No fucking way!
How many lives do you have?
Well, at least one more, I guess.
How the fuck did he survive that?
You told me that tracking device was foolproof.
Who designed it?
Your company did.
Hey, Lists. Patch me through to 14K's rig.
Patch me through to 14K.
You're up.
You got him?
You're on with 14K, Luke.
Hey, 14K.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
We're even now,
Lucas.
Are you ready?
Let's finish this.
I'm coming to kill you.
You hear me, Niles?
I'm coming to kill you.
Personally coming to kill you.
You hear me, Niles?
Open all mics.
Open all mics!
Attention, guards.
Frankenstein is headed to the finish line.
Take him out!
You're such a coward.
Out, out!
You were right.
He screwed me over.
I should have listened to you before.
What do you want me to do?
Come on!
Take him out!
Come on, shoot him!
Come on!
Fuck!
Where do you think you're going?
You think I'm gonna let a simple fucking con ruin everything that I've built?
ANNOUNCER: Frankenstein has a clear path to the finish.
He's about to win.
14K pulls past Frankenstein and crosses the finish line.
Fuck yeah!
14K wins the Death Race.
You could've won that.
I know. It's not about winning races any more.
He lost. (LAUGHS)
It's over.
No more games.
I wouldn't say that.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
I love you.
See you on the other side, kid.
I'm gonna take him out myself.
Wait.
You aren't going anywhere.
What the hell?
Give me the fucking key!
This is your production. It's quite fitting that you go down with it.
(LAUGHING) Get this fucking thing off me!
It is my sad duty to announce the death of Niles York.
The visionary entrepreneur who brought Death Race to us, died in an explosion that also claimed the life of Katrina Banks
on this third and final day of competition.
We'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. York's family and friends.
Someone's alive!
DOCTOR: Is this really
Frankenstein?
PALMER: Yes.
Yes, it is Frankenstein.
The tracking device confirms it.
Yes, yes. I can confirm that
Frankenstein has survived and is currently en route back to Terminal Island.
I leave the task of rebuilding Death
Race in your very capable hands.
Death Race's home is Terminal Island.
Nowhere else.
I've arranged a new pit crew leader for Frankenstein.
You should have his information in front of you.
Yes, yes, that's all well and good.
But what of Frankenstein?
I've been informed that
Frankenstein is alert,
conscious, and will be ready to race in two weeks.
Excuse me for a minute.
What happened?
He just woke up screaming, rambling a bunch of nonsense.
I'm not Frankenstein!
DOCTOR: He's obviously still in shock.
We brought his friend down to calm him down.
Frank?
For the last fucking time, lam not Frankenstein.
PRUDENCE: So you're absolutely sure?
It's him all right. But I've never seen him like that before.
Prudence, tell them. Tell them who I am.
I'm Niles York.
I am not Frankenstein!
No!
Hello, baby.
Is everything okay?
No.
It's perfect.
All right, lovebirds.
We can always rely on you.
To Lists.
KATRINA: To Lists.
WEYLAND ON PHONE:
Did you get my wire?
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's very...
Very generous.
Thank you.
For what you did to that bastard,
I would have paid triple.
LUKE: (CHUCKLES)
Well, if I'd known that.
I thought the plan was to kill him.
Well, things change, huh?
Personally, I think
I did better than that.
Are you complaining?
Hell, no.
How the hell did you pull it off?
That son of a bitch screwed you over, didn't he?
We do this, one condition.
NILES: I made a deal with the guy.
You lose, you live.
You win, you die.
There's something you all need to know.
I did make a deal.
With our old boss.
LISTS: Weyland?
And I expected him to at least renegotiate.
But he didn't.
Do not underestimate him.
He's planning something.
My way, my rules, my plan.
I'm gonna need something very important from you.
And what's that?
I'm gonna need to kill you, Goldberg.
They're the warlords of Kalahari.
Look, I'm gonna bring these warlords into the race.
What are you doing?
What's who doing?
While everybody's watching, I'm gonna need you to take yourself out.
I'm gonna need a signal.
LUKE: It's gonna be loud.
WEYLAND: What do you need me to do?
We need someone on the inside.
Done.
The coast is clear.
I'm sorry to hear about that dead spic.
This is my production.
SATANA: You were right.
Out, out!
He screwed me over.
I should have listened to you before.
Frankenstein is headed to the finish line.
Take him out!
Do yourself a favor and listen to me right now.
I'm gonna take him out myself.
What do you want me to do?
Keep him in the room.
No matter what.
The fucking key!
WEYLAND: Death Race has the ultimate prize.
You win your freedom.
This all starts and ends with Frankenstein.
LISTS: Someone's alive!
PSYCHO: I was just wondering if you are the original Frankenstein.
PALMER: Yes, it is Frankenstein.
The tracking device confirms it.
PSYCHO: Frankenstein can never die.
He can be shot. He can crash and burn.
He can explode.
But Frankenstein will always emerge.
WEYLAND: Frankenstein, he is Death Race.
Carl Lucas, may he rest in peace.
Psst! The coast is clear.
I'm not going.
What are you talking about you're not going? You have to.
I was never any good out there.
I didn't understand the rules.
In prison, things make sense.
And, plus, someone has to stay behind.
A witness to tell the tale.
What you're doing isn't logical.
Yeah, he's right.
(SOBBING) Someone once told me, fuck logic.
Let your heart tell you what's right.
SATANA: I spoke to Weyland.
I'm here to help you.
Blueprints, electrical systems, ventilation shafts.
Now, how would your little copycat event play without the game's marquee star?
NILES:
It's a man in a mask.
How would the fans know which one was real?
WEYLAND: That's why you're going to fail.
The boy wonder billionaire will become the laughing stock.
NILES: The Death Race that you all know and love will not change.
It will grow bigger and better.
This, I promise.
WEYLAND: Now, if you suddenly change the rules of the game,
you're going to lose your audience.
LUKE: What are you gonna do, replace me?
With who?
WEYLAND:
Payback's a bitch, son.
NILES: I am Frankenstein.
And I will have my revenge.
Hey, buddy.
Space is great. Umm...
I miss you eyes.
We're a long way away now.
I can't even see, uh...
I can't even see Earth anymore.
And, uh... it's peaceful.
You know?
Don't tell your mom this, but I think
I actually sleep...
- better up here, away from her snoring.
- Over.
Tanks
B-7 and B-9 are showing early signs of freezing. Over.
What would you do if you get out there and you find nothing?
Well, even if we found nothing,
- it's in effect a discovery.
It would make me very frustrated.
I know there's something there.
Check on NAV bays 3 and 4.
You might want to update...
Mission Control, repeat please. Over.
Come in, Europa One.
Man 3: Do you want me to show you how to beat 'em?
William, I've got some static in the comm array feed up here.
- It looks like a radiation spike.
Have you tried recycling the system?
Rosa, we've lost your feed.
Europa One, come in.
- Europa One.
- Europa One.
These were the last images we received from the Europa One craft.
At the time, it had already gone farther than any human being had ever traveled before.
For 16 long months I've been asked the simple but loaded question:
"What happened?"
All... I'm sorry.
We have to tell his family.
We can't.
The communication fix was never completed.
The system is fried!
Last sync with Mission Control was 19 hours ago.
We're all alone now.
So what happens?
Do we go on?
I was on a plane, a transatlantic flight, when the mission feed went dark.
When I landed,
Mission Control was still saying
"Maybe it's just a transmission delay."
But, by the time I made it into Mission Control, we were looking at over 15 hours of dead feed.
After James was lost, the joy of the mission, the exhilaration of it all just... it just left.
I stopped feeling like a kid on a family trip.
The mission has stretched on ahead of us, somehow longer than it had been before.
No one at home knows we're alive.
We're doing the right thing, right?
Absolutely.
Andrei, have you looked out at Jupiter yet?
It's something to be excited about.
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.
You haven't said a word to me in a week.
- I woke up one morning...
- Okay.
I woke up at some point and... didn't recognize myself.
Objectively, I know it's the zero G and the isolation that changes you.
But that doesn't make it any less strange.
It doesn't stop you from slowly breaking.
I started living my life in tune with the mission that I hoped was still going on.
- That's good.
- Okay.
How's your appetite?
I'm fine.
And you're sleeping kind of...
I'm not.
It's been a year since we lost him.
Tell me we can still...
- Good morning. I am very...
- Shh shh shh.
We are all very excited to be here today.
It has certainly been a long road and all of us up here started with the shared dream of space and possibility.
And this really is a new first-step for mankind.
From one perspective, you can say our mission actually began 400 years ago.
- That's when Galileo first saw...
...Jupiter and its moons through his telescope.
For something this big, you get one shot.
An unmanned mission simply wasn't going to cut it for us.
You put men and women into space because they have strength in the face of cosmic odds.
Europa One is cleared for launch.
T-minus 10, nine, eight,
- seven, six...
- All vents open.
- ...five, four...
- We're go for main engine.
...three, two, one.
Ignition.
Liftoff!
On the trek to Europa.
Our engines at 98% thrust.
Fuel rate is nominal.
Rolling right in zero-point-six degrees.
Telemetry nominal.
Loft at 225 meters-per-second.
Altitude, 2.3 nautical miles.
And in three, two, one.
We have good booster separation.
Vehicle is supersonic.
Command module jettison in three,
- two, one.
We have a good shell separation.
Initial burn is complete.
Staging in three, two, one.
Copy. We have good stage separation.
We have visual of command module.
Beginning turn for docking.
Trajectory is good.
Thrust is good.
We hadn't left near-Earth orbit since 1972.
Our company was tasked with moving forward where the space programs of the 20th century had left off.
- 10 meters to docking.
- I believe if you have the scent of a discovery this big...
- Five meters.
- ...you do not simply wait and see what happens next.
- Contact.
You go after it.
Copy. We are green on hard dock.
Locks B through D are green.
Connects are stable.
Repeat: We are green on dock.
Mission Control, we are proud to report that we are officially underway.
- Roger that.
We'll be here for you when you get back.
We've prepped some light traveling music for you.
Internal cam check is a go.
- Must be peaceful up there.
External cam check is a go.
Hello.
Please don't vote me off.
There's a camera.
What do ya know?
Reality TV.
Okay, Jamie, this is your own personal tour of Europa One.
Oh look, it's you, Jamie.
Hi, Jamie.
"Hi, Dad."
Hey, Dan. You still upset that you got the bottom bunk?
How did you know
I was thinking about that?
- I really was thinking about it.
- The top is just so much better.
- I was supposed to have that.
- Look at that.
- Here's Daniel down here...
- I'm supposed to have...
..."I'm so cramped."
Look at my spacious bunk.
- Film me for a second.
- Okay.
Okay, so this is actually one of two living quarters.
What they do is they rotate around the core module so this gives us simulated gravity.
But watch this.
We also get to experience real gravity-free space excitement.
Whoo!
- And the head rush that goes with it.
- Crew meeting
- in one hour, guys.
- Okay.
Now the thing about zero gravity is that it makes our bones and muscles really weak.
This is why we spend as much time as possible in these living modules.
Yeah, okay.
Just pass it up. I got it.
Okay.
And there's the lovely Katya.
Now these are some of the science tools that we're using to test for life on Europa.
And your dad has to fix them if any of them break.
When you're done playing tourist, you can come over here and help me.
If you're not afraid to chip a nail.
Now... whoa...
- this is the cockpit.
Mission Control...
...sync.
Copy, Rosa. We have sync.
And Rosa, our pilot, used to fly jets before she started flying us around.
And what's she doing?
She's setting up the camera system which monitors everything that happens on the ship.
Smile for Jamie, Rosa.
And now... last thing I want to show you... have a look at this.
The view.
Kind of ironic, really.
So little space in here and so much space out there.
Whoa.
As the ship passed the moon, it had already gone farther than any human being had ever traveled before.
I mean, think about that.
Across all of human history, that moment was the farthest anyone had ever gone.
But they still had millions upon millions of miles to go.
Our craft was heading for a moon of Jupiter known as Europa.
This mission is riding on the shoulders of many great men and women.
And so if we have any legacy at all,
I would hope that it would be that we would inspire those who come after us to keep exploring, to keep questioning, to keep pushing the boundaries, to keep looking for the answers to those really tough questions...
Who are we?
Why are we here?
Where do we come from?
And... are we alone?
- For a very long time,
Europa has seemed to be just a solid sphere of ice.
But even just looking at its surface, there are clues, you know?
There might be water underneath the ice.
And then in the fall of 2011, scientists realized... they released data showing the presence of sub-surface lakes... of liquid! And... wow!
- Wherever we have found water... we have found life.
But what came next was, um... even more startling.
NASA discovered heat signatures under an area known as the Conamara Chaos.
Well, they teased the idea that... that simple mono-cellular life in our solar system might not just be possible, it might be probable.
I wanna go to Europa and go ice fishing.
Cut through the ice, lower a submersible, look around, see what's there.
See what swims up to the camera lens and licks it.
If life exists on Europa, it will be the single most profound discovery in human history.
Dasque to Mission Control. Over.
We read you, Rosa. Over.
Data sync is live.
How's everyone holding up?
I think it's potato soup.
- Get something to drink.
- Dude, why... why would you put garlic into a space dish?
It's very rich.
- It's delicious.
- I have to say, though...
Okay, look look...
I've got another mile to go.
Not bad, eh?
What about after your run?
When are you gonna actually call someone?
- None of your business.
- Hey. It's time.
I should have learned
Mandarin before we left.
- He's probably talking about us.
- Gun it.
- One, two, one, two, one, two, one...
- How did you feel?
- I said yes before the question had even sunk in.
They had to ask me four times before I could even respond.
No trouble on the ping requests.
We see a sticking valve in V-Tech.
Are you seeing that too? Over.
- Andrei is already working on a fix.
If it leaks any more, we'll isolate the manifold.
Oh, and we have series of fuse events in Rosa's station.
Can you have the team on duty investigate? Over.
Copy that. But you might have it fixed before we finish the review.
You're making us feel two steps behind.
- Over.
- You'll make him blush. Over.
- Mission Control, can you hear me?
Andrei is in the shower right now, so I want to take this opportunity to tell you that your shower system is totally inadequate.
And I don't buy your theories about the body adjusting to the new hygiene regime.
You know what I can't adjust to?
The drinking of the distilled urine.
Oh! James!
I'm just saying... you're worried about my smell and you're drinking my urine?
You know what I think they're really pissed off about?
You guys only gave them four outfits.
So sometimes they wake up in the morning, they find out they're wearing the same thing the entire day.
They get totally pissed off.
- And the shoes... you gave them two pairs of shoes.
For women. I'm just saying.
Rosa, dinner! Where is she?
- Coming.
- Who's the lasagna?
- Yeah.
- That's you?
- Oh God.
- Who's the pod macaroni and cheese-ish?
- I guess I'll take that.
- To six months!
- Mmm.
- Cheers.
- Okay, eyes. Eyes.
- Wait,
- you're not looking into my eyes.
- Oh, sorry.
- Can I see?
- Did you see any polar bears?
- No, really.
We... we pulled our astronauts from the very best space programs across the globe.
Our captain is William Xu.
I think this mission will show people that we're still capable of achieving impossible things.
Dr. Daniel Luxembourg.
My entire adult life has been dedicated to exploring extreme environments.
And I became an astronaut specifically to have the opportunity to do something like this.
Dr. Katya Petrovna.
Life on Earth began in the ocean, so in some ways this mission will be like taking a trip back in time.
My background is in marine biology and oceanography.
To be honest, sometimes I'm terrified of flying.
Andrei Blok.
I think I have
349 days in outer space, so I'm what you call a veteran.
The only thing I can't face is...
- the food.
James Corrigan.
I remember watching footage at school of Neil Armstrong on the moon, and just... just knowing
"I want to do this."
- Rosa Dasque.
- Call me immature, reckless, arrogant.
I just want to go faster and farther than anyone has before.
We had to design a spacecraft unlike any before it.
Of course, once the decision was made to put people on board, the requirements ballooned.
Human beings need food, shelter.
They need an environment that is survivable and has some level of comfort.
It's cracking the ice.
We're a month away, Andrei.
We're still concerned about your recovery.
So how should I be recovering, exactly?
Excuse me.
So what do you think?
I still wouldn't advise leaving him in the orbiter alone for three weeks.
I'd rather not leave our only engineer behind.
So we take him down with us then.
Yeah.
Jupiter.
Being so close to our destination lifted our spirits.
It felt that everything made sense again.
The thickness in the air cleared.
But what cleared it was sheer adrenaline.
Prep for orbital transfer.
We're gonna feel some Gs here.
Pitch maneuver.
We are clear of Jupiter's orbit.
Beginning orbital transfer.
Pitching for power descent.
Daniel, can you keep Andrei abreast of any of those changes in the readouts, please?
- Roger that.
- Orbit trajectory, clear.
Current speed
60 kilometers per second.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Surface conditions in the IZ?
I've got heat plume and radiation analysis incoming, but the data is variable.
Heat is fluctuating.
Not far now.
All systems online.
Showing green light.
Landing gear armed and ready to deploy.
Ladies and gentlemen, hold on.
Here we go.
Trajectory and speed?
Heading 270.3.
Coming in low across Thera Macula at 458.4 meters per second.
Target site lining up.
Landing gear deployed.
20 seconds to...
What was that?
It's like a thermal vent.
Sort of an eruptive feature.
- Can you stabilize us?
- I'm trying!
Andrei, I need an option for emergency landing.
Vent's coming from the area around our target site.
There's a low gradation of ice just past the IZ, along Thrace Macula.
Okay. Land us long.
Get us past the vent area.
- 100 meters to contact.
- 10 seconds of fuel.
Back off the burners on approach or we'll melt our landing site.
Roger that. 10 meters.
- Five meters.
- Contact lights.
Shut down.
I think we've got it.
Everything okay up here?
Sorry.
I can't pull my eyes away from it.
It takes your breath away.
That night I went out and found Jupiter in the night sky and...
I spent a long time looking at it, just... hoping.
Surface temp in current position is holding at absolute zero.
Prelim service data has us on a bed of what looks like ice 11.
We should be there, but we're here.
We flew 590 million kilometers and then landed
100 meters off the mark.
- It seems insignificant, but it will be difficult to get useful surface analysis.
Ironically, what threw the ship off course from the original target zone was a reconfirmation of what we had hoped for.
If such heat-plume eruptions were escaping through the cracks in the ice, it suggested strong underwater thermal activity and the potential for life.
If they had landed on the target area, which was ripe for surface analysis, the mission would have begun with extensive surface tests using the ship's robotic arm, followed by a few hours of drilling through the ice to deploy a remote underwater probe.
- So how will that affect procedure?
What it means is we won't get the data we want very easily.
That's why I want to move back
Daniel's surface test and start the drill immediately.
Our best hopes of success lies under the ice.
Daniel, what do you think?
- I wanna argue...
- I'm sure you would.
...but with our current position in the ice, we won't get key data.
Let's go for a swim.
- Drill head is locked and prepped.
Beginning extension.
Thermal is live.
Entering ice layer now.
- Do you hear that?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah.
I think that's just the ice shifting.
Everything's all right.
We can expect more of that as the temperature drops.
That was stronger than our data projected it.
- Are we stable?
- Re-working the analysis now.
Katya, let's try the frequency of these quakes.
The increased tidal activity means there could be more heat than we thought beneath the surface.
- Are you recording this?
- Yeah.
Okay, let's run some diagnostics here, because it seems to be escalating a little bit.
Might be some subsurface aftershocks, but up here we'll be fine.
You saw it.
Huh.
You got to check out this activity.
- It's incredible.
- Everything's fine here.
What about the ECS?
All clear?
- How about the hull and landing gear?
- You see this?
- Check out the activity. Incredible.
- Yeah, no deflection.
- ECS okay.
No problems here.
Guys, I saw something.
What do you mean?
Uh, umm...
I saw something outside the ship.
From up there through the porthole.
Maybe 100 meters out.
I tried to get a video, but I missed it.
It was a light down the linea.
I was working one of the servers when the ice shook.
And... it was there.
A light source outside the ship?
I know that I saw it.
- It was flickering.
- How strong was the light?
Well... it was like an LED, but dull from refraction.
But the... oh, it happened so fast.
It was there and then it was gone.
You mean it moved?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it moved.
I can check the heat signatures.
Do you see anything?
I've checked this footage three times.
- There's nothing to see.
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean there was nothing there.
If it was too dim, these cameras wouldn't have caught it.
That's true.
A weak chemiluminescence maybe?
Triggered by shifts in the ice?
A chemical iridescence doesn't fit this description.
Maybe. When we prepare the surface test, we'll know.
I find the idea of bacteria clinging to the underside of the ice more likely.
Something that has a luminescent response to radioactivity.
Yeah, but do you think it actually moved?
Scientifically I doubt it.
But personally, I hope so.
Wait, did you notice that?
What?
Radiation interference.
It's on all the cameras.
Wait, let's take two steps back here.
I think there's another version of this that we have to consider.
It's entirely possible
Andrei didn't see anything at all.
It's very dark out there and his mind could be filling in the blanks.
But it could also be our first indication of exactly what we came out here to find.
Is Andrei sleeping yet?
No.
In those days there was a raw... a raw mix of emotions.
We'd come so far, weathered so much.
I think we were all in a place where excitement blended with awe... and fear.
- Okay, so Daniel is my witness.
You find a single microbe up there and I win.
If you find a still-living microbe, you win.
What? Evidence of extinction doesn't win me the bet?
You always find a technicality like that
- for winning.
- No no. It's not a technicality.
It means that at some point in time we were not alone.
It is a technicality.
- Daniel.
- What?
What are you doing, buddy?
What's happening?
- You lost something?
- I lost my toothbrush.
- What?
- He's unpacking his entire bunk.
You lost your toothbrush?
What color is it, man?
Did you pack it?
- Oh no.
- Okay, where's my toothbrush?
- We have to return to Earth.
- We better call housekeeping.
You should get some rest.
Not until I know what I saw out there.
We're working on it.
- We'll figure it out.
What if I can't believe or trust my own eyes?
You need to sleep.
We need you to sleep.
There's pills, sedatives.
No pills.
I need to stay alert.
I need to stay focused.
How are you holding up?
Good.
We've broken through.
Water.
I'm patching in.
- Probe microphone live.
Wow. This is a completely untouched environment.
Just waiting.
We're so far from home, but... it's like looking at Lake Vostok right now.
Radiation levels down here are minimal.
And there's definitely a heat source somewhere in our target zone.
122 meters to heat-plume area.
There's 100 kilometers of water down there.
It puts the trench zones back on Earth to shame.
I think we're seeing some tectonic plates here.
The sulfur concentration is showing that the thermal vents are closer than expected.
Creepy.
That's your scientific assessment, is it?
- Yep.
- "Creepy"?
- Is that the weathering of the ice?
Maybe.
Could be a bacteria.
Grabbing samples and... moving on.
20 meters to target zone.
Look at how the sunlight penetrates the ice here.
It must be much thinner than we thought.
You hear that?
It could be coming from reverberations, deeper caverns caught in currents.
It's almost like a male whale sound.
Hey, a little presumptuous, don't you think?
Maybe.
- Oh yeah.
I've got some irregularities in our data here.
I'm getting a radiation spike.
Rosa, are you picking up on this?
There's something in the video feed too.
It's similar to what we saw after the last ice shift.
That doesn't make any sense.
The ice should be shielding the probe from radiation.
It's not coming from above.
It's coming from deeper into the target zone.
Yeah.
Let's adjust course and depth to investigate.
Bringing us down.
What was that?
What's our temperature down here?
Get ready to expand the probe arm
- to get samples.
What was that? Oh shit.
- Recycle power.
- All right, let's run some tests.
There was an abnormal shift in the velocity of the current.
- It's not reacting.
- Is it a remote issue?
- I've lost control of it.
- Shit.
Can you play back the video?
Did something hit the probe?
- What data do we have?
- It'll take time to process,
- but I'll tell you right now, not much.
It seemed like it was right under the probe.
What was the last piece of data it sent?
The heat surged to 50°, but that couldn't have caused a critical...
Shit!
A surface walk was always heavily debated at all stages of our mission planning.
And our main concern then was the radiation from Jupiter.
I will walk to the target zone and I'll get the body of samples we need.
Katya, the radiation alone...
The radiation is fluctuating.
It was 200 ram last time I checked.
I'm willing to take that risk.
What about everything else that could go wrong?
It's 100 meters!
Having lost the probe, the only way to get the data was to explore the chaos zones where the ice had cracked and re-cracked.
And this process would expose any microorganisms that have been trapped inside the ice.
- Somebody's gotta go out there!
- It's too risky.
- Enough! Enough!
I feel like it's a critical phase and I'm not there.
- I just...
I just didn't realize it would be this hard.
- Over.
Sounds like a car.
You know take him to the game, if you want.
Umm...
I miss you guys. Love you.
Over.
- You Okay?
Yeah, I am good.
I'm good.
Not so easy, is it?
No.
No, it's not.
You know, my boy's gonna be six when I see him again.
He's gonna be proud of you.
What would you do if you get out there and you find nothing?
Well, even if we found nothing, it's in effect a discovery.
It would make me very frustrated.
I know there's something there.
Check on NAV bays 3 and 4.
Mission Control, repeat please. Over.
Do you want me to show you how to beat him?
William, I've got some static in the comm array feed up here.
It looks like a radiation spike.
Have you tried recycling the system?
Europa One, come in.
- Rosa, we've lost your feed.
Come in, Europa One.
- Europa One, come in.
Come in, Europa One.
Europa One, come in.
Europa One.
Europa One, Europa One, do you...
Now try as you might to prepare for everything, there will always be that unknown element.
In this case a solar storm hit, damaging key systems, including communication with Mission Control.
Are you ready?
Okay. Oxygen is flowing.
We're good.
This never gets old.
Okay, commencing egress.
William, I'm gonna tether the EMUs once we're...
- on the hull.
- Roger that.
Andrei and James had to do an EVA to repair the system... a bit like performing ballet and rocket science at 125,000 miles an hour.
This reminds me of the ISS thrust fix all over again.
5 hours, 13 minutes remaining on EVA.
You know what time it is back on Earth?
Battery block D is non-functional.
2 hours 55 minutes.
All right, I've got green lights on the fan arrays.
How are we doing on the comm power supply?
So I said to the guy, "You know,
I can't just come along and stay as long as you want."
"You have to tell me how long it's gonna take."
Okay, guys,
50 minutes remaining on EVA.
I can't keep you out there much longer.
Panels one through six are clear.
- Moving onto seven.
We just need a little more time, William.
I think it's a blown fuse in the communication panel.
You've got 37 minutes.
If you don't find it, we'll need to begin regress.
Okay, we're at the communication panel.
Opening up the door.
What do you got, Andrei?
James, get a look at this.
Whoo.
The receptors are shot.
Yeah, William, the whole board is fried.
I gotta take the pins out.
Okay.
Taking out the first pin.
- Come on.
And first pin is clear.
Going for number two.
- Proceed.
Come on.
Shit.
It's not coming.
Okay.
William, we've got a frozen pin.
Okay, guys, leave that last panel for now.
What do you think?
We can't tell how bad it is till we get in there.
You sure, man? You don't want to put heat on there first?
- It just feels...
- The damage could spread.
- Okay.
- What the hell is going on out there?
Okay. I'm set.
Come on.
Ah! Shit! It snapped.
- The panel snapped.
I ripped my glove.
I ripped...
It's okay. Andrei's okay.
- We're tethered.
- It's a tear of one inch.
- I've cut my skin.
- I got him hooked to me.
We're coming in.
Andrei, do not attempt to climb back in on your own.
- James?
- I see him, I see him. I got him.
I'm going for him. Hang on.
- It's a small rip.
- Take it easy.
- Just relax, big guy.
- Keep calm, Andrei.
- I'm bleeding.
- Save your oxygen.
He's losing air, but he's got his hand on it.
I'm bringing him in.
I got you.
Nice and easy.
Just relax, big guy.
- I got you.
- Oxygen pressure is dropping steadily.
- You don't have much time.
James, listen to me.
His oxygen level is red-lighting.
Get him back inside the ship.
Okay.
We're at the lock. I'm coming in.
Stop, don't go in.
- Why?
- There's something on your suit.
It's hydrazine.
Uh, guys, we've got a problem.
I've got hydrazine on my suit.
It must have hit me when we popped the panel.
He's covered in it.
It's in the seams.
It's... it's everywhere.
- What can we do to decontaminate?
- We can't.
If we bring him in, the air in the ship will become toxic.
Come on. Shit.
We should get him in the lock, get a v-cam reading.
We can't. There'd be too much risk of lingering contamination.
We gotta figure out a way to get the suit clean.
It's not coming out.
- I'm totally screwed.
- Andrei, get in the lock.
We need to depressurize your suit now.
Then we'll figure out how to get James in.
Seriously?!
Come on, man, I got...
I've got 20 minutes of oxygen.
Is there no way to get it clean?
- Andrei.
- I'm not going in.
I'll get you out of the suit...
- What?
- ... Into the airlock.
You'll be out of the suit less than two minutes.
- It's survivable.
- Is that even possible?
I'll get you out of this. I'll fix it.
No. Andrei, you're gonna black out, man.
- No, I'm not.
- This isn't gonna work.
James, now you're bleeding oxygen.
- No. No.
- We're going to lose them both.
James, he's fading.
You have to get him in the lock.
Okay. Shit.
Rosa, close the airlock now!
James is no longer attached to the hull.
- I said close the lock!
- Rosa, close the lock!
Airlock is closed.
Oxygen is flowing.
Repressurization in 10 minutes.
This is insane.
You gotta go get him.
We can't.
By the time we'd get there, he'd...
James?
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm here. Umm...
Oh, Christ, I can't...
I'm gone.
Oh shit.
Is Andrei okay?
Yeah. He's okay.
I'm sorry, James.
Don't be sorry.
It was an accident, you know?
Um...
I... I don't have much time, so tell Andrei... tell Andrei he's a... he's a crazy son of a bitch, you know?
And I love him for trying to save my life and...
Deb and Jamie, I...
I love you so much.
Forgive me.
I thought I was trying to do something great for mankind.
I always said it was worth the risk but...
Forgive me for... for hurting you.
A part of me kinda wishes I could just float out here forever, you know?
I can't s...
I can't see anything. I can't...
I can't see any...
It's stupid to argue like this.
Katya, no way you can go out there without us behind you.
And, William, with all due respect,
I think we should all decide together how to do this.
I know what you think, William.
What about you, Daniel?
It's ill-advised.
A surface walk was always a question mark.
Well, we can do it.
I'll walk the equipment out and you can run the analysis from here.
We can get what we came for.
And if she goes out there and we never see her again?
Think hard about that.
I think she should do it.
I'm sorry, William.
- Thank you.
- Andrei?
- It's too dangerous.
I vote no.
Absolutely.
So that's a tie then.
Rosa?
Katya made our complete cosmic insignificance seem like a call to arms.
What can I say?
She was right.
She's still right.
Two hours of EVA.
210 meters out.
Search the top layer of ice while Daniel runs analysis back here.
Copy that.
Be careful.
Compared to the breadth of knowledge yet to be known, what does your life actually matter?
30 minutes for depressurization.
Batteries live.
Switching to battery power.
Pressure's at 30 kPa.
How's your prep?
30 seconds to egress.
Good luck.
- I'm ready.
I can't believe I'm here.
We're here.
This is incredible.
Radiation is holding steady.
We're at 50 millisieverts per hour... within acceptable limits.
I'll check if I can see her from upstairs.
It's so still out here.
It's so... I don't know what the word is.
- Creepy?
I was going to go with "cosmically astounding."
I wish I could take one of these gloves off and touch the ice.
- Really feel it.
- Please don't.
I have visual of her from here.
I'm heading towards the target zone now.
We've got your back.
Life-support systems look good.
Okay, Katya, you are crossing into the target zone.
You see that?
Where the ice is less deteriorated?
Just set up in the middle of that.
- Here?
- Exactly.
She must have been out there for an hour.
But it... it felt like an eternity.
Each minute seemed to divide and divide again into endless moments.
First sample ready for scan.
Sending data back to you now.
Are you reading?
Running analysis, stand by.
We're negative for trace carbon and chemotropic processes.
Can you try ice with more trace rust?
You could feel... every minute is somehow longer than it had ever been before.
- Let's give it another shot.
- Why don't you take the equipment down the linea to zone three?
Radiation is trending upwards, Katya.
You've been out there 70 minutes.
We're so close.
How much time can you give me, William?
You've only got time for a few more sample sets.
All right, Katya, it's time to come back.
Okay.
I'm digging out a sub-surface sample that isn't radiation blasted.
Are you guys seeing this?
- Here.
I'm getting imaging... now.
- It's a unicellular organism, something akin to an algae.
I knew it.
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure, but...
I mean, it's not like it has a name.
It looks like something Precambrian to me.
That's my first guess on an Earth-based analogue.
I don't believe it.
We did it.
Okay, Katya, let's get you back into the ship
- and sort out this data.
- Packing up.
I hope the champagne's ready.
Look at that.
Do you guys read that light in the distance?
We're not reading anything.
It looks like some kind of chemical iridescence.
I'm going to get closer to investigate.
Reserve oxygen will give her another 90 minutes.
Okay, Katya.
Proceed with caution.
I can't see her.
She's moving farther out.
It's beautiful.
Andrei.
This looks like it could be the light you were describing.
- I can see it again.
Can you check on my readouts?
It's... it's... it's... it's hard to say.
I mean maybe there's other microbial organisms out there that eat through the ice.
This is a much more complex ecosystem than we'd previously thought.
I wanna see if it's reacting to my lights.
I'm going to turn them off.
I'm going to get closer.
Hold that action, Katya.
Katya, do you read me?
We have severe electromagnetic interference.
Did you see that?
She has to come back.
...have visual.
I'm going to try to get it back.
I'm seeing it through the ice.
I think it's some sort of bioluminescence.
We've got the data, Katya.
Heat and radiation levels are moving with it.
I can't wrap my head around this.
It's...
Okay, the ice is thin here, but it seems stable. If I get close,
- I should be able to get a better look.
- Keep your line open.
I want to know what's happening out there.
The ground is not stable!
- The ice is breaking.
Katya, can you hear me?
Come back to the ship now!
It's cracking the ice!
- My foot is...
- Katya, do you read me? Come in!
- Get her back in!
- Get her back in!
- Katya, come in. Do you read me?
- She's not listening.
- Rosa, do you see her out there?
Nothing. Just the ice.
- She's under the ice.
- What?
Under the water.
We've still got her helmet cam.
Whatever it was, it was reacting to the light on her helmet.
That's the behavior of a complex organism.
The logs, the data... they don't show any proof of complex life.
We can't leave until we have that.
We don't know how long we'll be stable here.
And we've lost two of our crew.
If we never leave, no one on Earth will ever know what we discovered.
I agree.
We need to leave now.
When the next launch window opens, we take off.
Mmm.
I want all the data secured and double-checked...
- especially everything Katya found.
T-minus 32 seconds to liftoff.
Prepping for ascent ignition.
Orbital sync is established.
Docking operation in t-minus eight minutes.
- Give me a systems check.
- Engine temperature's rising.
Andrei?
Booster 3 is stuck at 30%.
We've got to launch now.
Launch in three, two, one.
What the hell?
I can't keep it steady.
Our trajectory is way off course.
The injectors are melting!
We've got engine mixture ratio errors in engines two and three.
We're nowhere near orbital transfer!
Hey!
I can try to correct course at apogee.
- The vernier thrusters might do it!
- We need to shut
- the valves down!
- Get us back down on the surface.
- What?
- Don't engage the second burn.
You mean crash us?
What's happening up there?
- Valves dow...
2,000 meters.
I can't keep it steady.
Computer's unable to rectify.
Still dropping!
Coming in too fast!
What are you doing? William!
- William!
- I'm going to slow us down.
- I'm going to blow the water shielding.
- It'll create... thrust!
- Brace for impact!
- 200 meters!
- Andrei? Andrei?
- Huh?
- Wake up, wake up!
William?
Okay.
He's dead.
He saved us.
Europa wasn't ready to let us go yet.
It quickly became apparent that we crashed into the original landing zone.
Ironic, I suppose.
This zone was much warmer, much more active than any previous data had suggested.
Underwater vents had rendered the ice brittle and unstable and constantly shifting
And then you add onto that
William had jettisoned the water shielding on descent and that had saved them, but it also left them dangerously exposed to radiation.
We're leaking oxygen.
And we're also losing heat... three degrees since I started checking.
If I would bet, we'll freeze before we suffocate.
The exterior light should be working.
Daniel, can you check?
- Daniel?
- I am.
It's not good.
The ice is cracking under the ship.
You can almost see the ice/water interface.
We're gonna be under the ice in a matter of hours.
Our last shot is docking with the orbiter... and using its back-up life-support systems.
If the propulsion system is still alive...
I can get us into orbit.
Come help me.
It's pointless.
Is this what you're looking for?
Yeah. Thank you.
Shit!
- Are you all right?
- The ice broke through.
This is it. It's happening.
It's the end.
We'll find a way.
We have to.
The fuel line is partially frozen.
That caused the loss of thrust.
We're lodged in the ice.
Can we even take off properly?
If we time it right, maybe.
Two hours is the fastest we can fix it, but that is if... two of us is working on it.
- You mean the three of us?
- No.
You have to stay inside, prep engines.
The fix must happen outside the ship.
That was that.
Are you ready?
- Are you?
Daniel and Andrei entered the airlock for final de-pressurization.
- Here.
Two hours.
Then I'll see you both back here. Yeah?
And that...
...brings us to now.
If we don't make it... this record... one day...
Just in case.
Just in case.
Depressurization complete.
Pressure is 25 kilopascals.
I'll go first, make sure the ice is stable.
Beginning egress.
Roger that.
System signals are strong.
The hatch is open.
Oh shit.
The ladder is a bit skewed, but I think I can make it.
The ice beneath the ship is cracked, but it looks sturdy.
Taking my first step now.
Be careful.
We're picking up the same radiation signature.
Okay. Taking my first step now.
- I am on the ice.
Oh God. I can feel it...
Daniel? Daniel?!
- Do you read me?
- Daniel?!
Daniel? Andrei?
Talk to me!
Rosa, turn off the exterior lights.
- Turn off the exterior lights!
- Okay.
I'm getting nothing.
His mike is dead.
His camera is dead.
He just vanished.
Do you read me?
What the hell is going on out there?
I don't know.
What?
- I lost him. I lost him.
The ice cracked beneath him.
Daniel? Daniel?
He was surrounded by lights, then he was gone.
Tell me... tell me we can still patch the fuel line.
Andrei?
Say something.
- Andrei?
- We can't.
There's one thing still worth trying.
The communication array is still salvageable.
I can fix it if I take parts from the life support.
I don't know.
Can you still prep data sync?
Rosa, we can do this.
How will I know when?
When I remove life-support batteries you'll lose power in the command module.
- Then data sync...
Keep talking to me.
Keep the line open.
It's dark.
It's not gonna be easy.
Andrei?
I've lost your camera again.
- Can you hear me?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.
- It's not far.
Camera's back up.
- 10 paces...
Andrei?
Come on, come on.
Andrei, I can see the light behind you.
Hurry, please.
I can see water under the ship.
Come on, hold on.
Another malfunction.
I need to check the drives.
Work, please.
- It's just one more tweak and I'm done.
- Andrei?
Do you read me?
Do you read me?!
There's a cabinet in the cockpit...
- ...that I've been working with.
Join the wires... and the systems will start.
Command module is just about dead.
We're losing cameras here.
I'm moving to the...
Andrei?
I'm connecting the wires.
Almost there. Almost there.
Rosa, it's working!
It's working!
- Oh God.
- Running out of time!
Communications are up.
- You did it!
You need to see this!
Are you getting this?!
The luminescence is all around the ship now!
The exterior cameras are dying.
Can you hear me?
Andrei?
The ship is sinking into the ice! Oh!
Andrei?
Do... do you read? Andrei?
Andrei, do you read?
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Andrei, talk to me!
Compared to the breadth of knowledge yet to be known...
...what does your life actually matter?
In those final moments, knowing communication had been re-established,
Rosa chose to open the airlock.
I got the call at 3:00 a.m. telling me that communication had been re-established.
By the time I got into our mission control our servers were flooded with images of our crew.
Our mission had finally come back to us.
We saw the sacrifices they made for each other to keep the mission alive, to push the discovery further.
And that final image... startling.
Terrifying. Completely beyond our wildest theoretic models.
The discovery of this creature is simply extraordinary.
We now know that our universe is far stranger, far more alive than we had ever imagined.
The crew of Europa One changed the fundamental context in which all of humanity understands itself.
I don't know what greater measure of success
- they could have achieved.
- Is this smiling? Smiling?
- Wet your lip.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
One, two...
Hey, okay ... now ... let's go again.
Which one's this, number 9?
- Yeah, number 9. Bright eyes.
Are you watching this?
This, this is unbelievable.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
How many moves was that?
The perfect score is 15.
God, what, what are you giving her?
Hey, give me that video!
Chimp number 9, just one dose.
Couldn't I see you later?
- We're good to go.
I'm going to call you back. Yeah, all right. Thanks, Bye.
112, it works.
On just the one primate?
- One is all we need.
Full cognitive recovery.
We're ready.
Look, are you sure you're not rushing this?
I've been working on this for five and a half years.
The data is clear.
We're ready, Steven.
All I need is your approval for human trials.
Oh, for this, you're going to need the Board's approval.
There's a lot of money riding on this, Will.
You only get one shot.
- One shot is all I need.
All right. I'll need to see all the research.
You got it!
Oh, and Will ...
- Yeah?
Keep your personal emotions out of it.
These people invest in results, not dreams.
Okay!
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower.
The object of which is to move the tower from peg to peg without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block.
As expected, she was unable to complete the puzzle at all.
Then, we gave her what we call,
ALZ-112, a gene therapy that allows the brain to create its own cells in order to repair itself.
In biology, this is called neurogenesis.
Here, at GEN-SYS, we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.
Donnie, you get her ready?
- She's got stage fright.
Is that what it is?
Hey, ape.
She's gonna break my arm!
Bright Eyes!
Let go!
Are you all right?
We're ready to move on to the next phase.
Human trials.
Here you go, Bright Eyes.
It's your favourite fizzy soda.
Come on, let's go, Donnie.
We should have her downstairs already.
Okay. Good girl!
Come on out, girl, that's right.
That's for you.
Got her!
Jesus!
Donnie, open the cage!
Open up! Open up!
Going to sedate her!
No, no!
- Get the door!
No, no! Hold it! Now!
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!
There have been absolutely no side effects associated with 112, with one exception.
For some reason, the chimps irises exhibit flecks of green.
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9, hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.
You'll see when we bring her in.
Move!
In theory, this therapy can be used to treat a wide range of brain disorders.
It's virtually limitless.
As are the potential profits... which is why we are confident that you will vote to approve human trials.
No, no, no!
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,
I am begging you, not to do this.
Look, it costs a small fortune to run lab work ups on all of those chimps only to tell me what I already know, that they are contaminated.
There are lives at stake here.
These, these are animals with personalities, with attachments.
Attachments?
- Yeah.
I run a a business, not a petting zoo.
Find the most cost effective way to put those apes down.
I can't do that.
You're the chimp handler.
Handle it.
Steven!
Well, that was fun!
They've taken the 112.
Board has rejected your proposal.
They've chosen to advance other programs.
Well, there must be something that you can do.
Yes. There is, I could fire you.
Believe me, we talked about it.
We have five years of conclusive data.
Parade all the data you want, you will never convince anyone to invest another dime.
This drug has the potential to save lives!
Bankrupt this company, more like.
I swear, you know everything about the human brain except the way it works.
Go back to the drawing board on the 112.
Start again in molecular development.
Find a way to get there before someone else does.
And, clean up this mess.
Franklin!
It's very small. She must have been pregnant when we brought her in.
So that's why ...
She wasn't being aggressive.
She was just being protective.
She thought we were going to hurt her baby.
I would take it myself, but my brother-in-law works for security.
He'd rat me out in a second.
What, you want me to take it home?
I can't take care of a monkey.
He's not a monkey! He's an ape.
- Franklin ...
You know, it's just for a couple days until
I find a sanctuary. That's all I need.
Franklin, no!
Look, this isn't my responsibility.
This, this is company property.
Okay ...
I tell you what, Doc.
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.
I'm done.
Be my guest.
Hey!
- Oh, hi.
You look beat.
- Yeah. How's he doing?
Well, he has good days and bad days.
Today, not so good, although he has been quoting Shakespeare.
Oh, you got a pet?
Uh, it's just a temporary house guest.
Well, maybe that'll be good for him.
Good night!
Hi, Dad!
Dad?
Will! I didn't hear you come in.
Today's the day, right?
You thought I'd forget?
You have a big test today, right?
Chemistry?
Hey, Dad ...
You want to see something?
- What?
What is that? Is he injured?
No, I think that's a birthmark.
"As for Caesar, kneel down, kneel down and wonder!"
Yeah, don't get too attached.
He's a cute little guy, isn't he?
Where's my car keys?
My car keys, where'd you put 'em?
Dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.
I know that.
Here ...
Why don't you feed him.
Can you do that?
Of course, I can..
Will! ... Look at this!
How old is he?
Like, a day old? Two days old?
Yeah ...
He's a smart one, isn't he?
What are you going to name him?
I do not know ...
Three years later
Right away, Caesar displayed signs of intelligence heightened intelligence, so I kept him. And, brought my work home.
By 18 months,
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.
By age two,
Caesar completing puzzles and models designed for children eight years and up.
At age three,
Caesar continues to show cognative skills that far exceed that of his human counterpart.
Home ... home.
He completed the Lucas Tower in
15 moves, a perfect score.
I maintain my hypothesis that:
A. The green in his eyes indicate that the ALZ-112 was passed genetically from mother to son and, B. That in the absence of damaged cells that need to be replacing the drug in his system has radically boosted healthy brain functioning.
And, ... he plays chess pretty well.
Dad!
I'm sorry.
- I can't do this, anymore.
He belongs in a home.
This is no way for him to live.
No way to live?
I broke my lamp ...
It'll make you better, Dad.
Dad!
Dad!
Todd, come inside for breakfast.
I'll need to keep track of what I take from the lab, although I don't see you needing more than one treatment a month.
Something amazing has happened!
I'll need a blood test, a scan and the dosage ... carefully monitored.
Now, if I can sneak ...
Will! I'm not sick, anymore!
It was nothing, Dad.
Caesar. Where's Caesar?
I want to see him.
Caesar!
Caesar!
He can't have gone far.
Caesar!
Daddy!
Caesar!
Get out of here! Get out!
Get out!
Hey, hey, hey ...
Enough! Enough!
It doesn't matter what you do.
If I catch that animal anywhere near my house or my kids, again ...
He's not dangerous.
It won't happen again.
Damn right, it won't!
Come on, Dad.
- He, he just wanted to play.
Stay in the house!
Daddy's got you.
I told you not to go out without us.
It's okay ...
How bad is it?
I do not know.
He likes you.
- Uh, huh.
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.
Then, we can go get a treat.
I'm thinking, ice cream.
Good idea!
You taught him to sign?
Just, handful of things, basic stuff.
What's he saying?
Nothing.
So, when do you think we should come back?
Well, you won't need to come back... because, um, the stitches are dissolveable.
I would just say, watch for signs of infection.
Fever ... redness ...
Okay, what's he saying, now?
Um, well, ... he thinks that you and I should have dinner together.
I ... know ...
Caesar! Come on!
Good to see you, again, Caroline.
You coming, Caesar?
So, what's your secret?
Oh, I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.
I think you're being very modest.
He's pretty amazing.
I think you've built a pretty good home for Caesar, here.
You know he won't stay this way for long.
He's going to soon grow into a large, powerful, animal.
Come here!
How's he been doing?
Okay, I think.
I love chimpanzees.
I'm also afraid of them.
And, it's appropriate to be afraid of them.
Caesar will never hurt anyone.
He's happy here.
Yeah, I see that.
We can at least give him some open space?
- Yeah. That would probably be a good idea.
I know a place right across the bridge, the Redwoods. It's a paradise.
Come on!
Come here.
Doesn't need a leash!
He'll be fine. Come on!
Just to be safe.
- Come on, Caesar!
It's the redwoods.
Caesar!
All right.
If I take this off you can not leave my sight.
I'll never find you again.
Okay.
What's this?
- What's he doing?
I don't believe that!
- What?
He's asking your permission.
It's a supplicating gesture.
It's okay.
Come on, Caesar!
Off you go!
Look at him go!
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!!
- Caesar!!
Caesar!
There you are ...
Caesar!
Come on, Caesar, climb!
Go higher!
Climb!
Be careful!
Caesar, be careful!
FIVE YEARS LATER
Hi!
What's going on, buddy?
Give some love.
Come on, honey.
Is that a chimpanzee?
Come on!
Come on!
Caesar! ... Caesar!
Come on!
It's all right. Come on.
Come on!
Let's go.
Are you getting in?
Caesar ...
You okay, pal?
Are you pet? ... No.
You're not a pet.
I am your father.
What is Caesar?
Okay ...
Caesar, this is where I work.
This is were you were born.
Your mother was here with other chimpanzees.
But she's not here, anymore ... so ... that's why I took home to live with me.
Yeah.
Your mother's dead.
The thing is, she was given medicine, like the medicine I give to Charles.
She passed it on to you.
That's why you're so smart.
Let's take him home.
Come on, explain it to me.
All right.
I snuck him out of the lab to save his life.
I had no idea that the effects had been transferred vertically from his mother.
But, since then, he's been displaying incredible signs intelligence.
I designed the 112 to repair, but Caesar's gone way beyond that.
Here's his IQ from last year.
Since then, it's doubled.
This is all wrong.
My father was on gone this drug brought him back.
You never saw how bad he was.
He has his life again.
And, what about Caesar?
- What about him?
How does he fit in?
With me, ... with us ...
Listen, ...
I know it has been hard for you, but you are trying to control things that were never meant to be controlled.
The 112 works.
Do you realize how you sound?
All I'm saying is this is a good thing.
Caesar's proof of that.
So's my father.
Caesar, eat your food.
Dad, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Antibodies.
His system has found a way to fight the 112 virus so that it can't deliver its therapy.
My father's disease is going to return with a vengeance.
Stop!
Stop, right now!
Hey! Get out there!
Get out of that car!
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!
I said, get out of my car!
I'm a pilot! I've got to get to the airport!
How am I gonna get there now, huh?
Answer the God-damn question!
What were you doing?
I have a car just exactly ...
I'm done ... the police can handle it.
Stay right there!
You aren't going nowhere, mister!
You will pay!
This is your problem, you make it happen!
Not through with you!
Stay right there!
Caesar, stop!
Daddy!
Caesar!
It's okay.
It's okay.
He didn't mean it.
It's okay ...
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!
Take that thing off of him!
Look, I'll take him in, okay?
No, he's under court orders.
We can't do that.
It's fine! Let him.
Bring him in when you're ready.
Take it off.
Thank you!
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar,
... Caesar, Caesar.
Not right now.
It's going to be okay.
Let's just see what it's like inside, okay.
Come on, Caesar.
Let's go.
Come on, ... trust me.
It's okay.
Go.
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.
Oh, we're used to that.
He'll be a little skittish at first, but we'll integrate him.
You'd be surprised how quick they adapt.
We provide a stimulating environment.
He's going to thrive here.
Come, let's do some paperwork.
Make sure you lock that door when you come in.
Caesar!
You'll be okay!
Everything's going to be okay!
Don't be scared.
You're going to stay here, now.
No ... Not going home right now.
It's OK.
The longer you drag out the good-byes, the harder it is.
Can I sign that later?
You'll probably miss him more than he'll miss you.
You'd best give him a couple of weeks to get used too the place.
Will, we have to go.
We have to go home.
Coming back soon, okay?
Just call ahead, before you do.
Hey, over here!
Hey, I can get you out!
Come on! Over here!
Hey, down here.
Stupid monkey ...
So you? Come on, make it!
Court order hasn't been filed, so it's not in the system.
Once it comes through, it will take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date.
90 days?
- Yes, sir, 90 days.
You'll be notified by mail.
Here's what's going to happen.
You're going to go back to your computer, you know, shift things around and you're going to get me a date for my appeal, this week, you got it?
I can't help you.
All right, then we have a problem.
Because, I'm not moving until you do.
90 days, sir. Be thankful you're talking about court dates.
You're lucky they didn't put that animal down.
I promised to get him back soon, Dad.
Dad?
My father's immune system continues to reject the 112 virus, rendering the gene therapy obsolete.
His health is deteriorating, and the disease is progressing rapidly.
I need a more aggressive virus strain, a faster delivery method, because at this rate ...
I can't lose them both.
I won't lose them both.
Hi .... Can we talk?
Make it fast. I've got a meeting.
The ten years you have been running GEN-SYS, how many drugs have come down the pipeline that could save millions of lives?
That could change everything?
What are you talking about?
The ALZ-112.
What happened to you, Will?
You used to be the star of this lab.
Now, you hardly ever show and when you do, you waste your time and that of your team's fixating on a drug that, after what happened, is never ever going to get approved.
The 112 is dangerous, Will, and it doesn't work.
I treated my father with it.
It does work.
You did, what?
You did, what!?
Beat the disease, like we predicted.
Brilliant.
There's been a complication.
Well, does it work or doesn't it?
My father's disease eventually outran the cure.
Oh, for goodness sake.
The immune system produced antibodies to beat the viral component, but it will work.
I've have already developed a virus strain that I think will be more aggressive.
You think?
Just, let me test it.
You're wasting my time.
There's more!
The applications go beyond the disease.
There are indications that show the therapy can improve cognitive functioning, memory quality ...
What, what are you saying?
My father didn't just recover.
He improved.
You mean, increased intelligence?
It's not conclusive, but yes.
I want you, to start testing the revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P.
Okay.
I'll give you whatever you need, but get started.
Dinner time!
Great Ape, primate!
Go on, don't you know food when you see it?
You think that's funny, huh?
I show you something funny!
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.
What about his clothes?
What about 'em?
I don't know ... May cause problems with the other apes.
Good!
I counted ten apes, correct?
Yep.
Good. All the way to the back.
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?
First day back, you're still complaining.
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.
This one.
He's very calm.
Yeah.
He's been through a whole lot of labs.
He knows the drill.
Could I join you, what's our progress.
Get him prepped.
Tighten your masks.
Pass me the 113.
Pulse-ox is good, blood pressure is steady.
Perisol delivery, in place.
Releasing the 113.
We have a break!
Franklin, get your mask on!
Got it?
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah, okay.
Move it! Let's go!
Get up and do some exercises you lazy baboons!
Intelligence results are remarkable.
There are no adverse effects.
Apes have amazingly strong immune systems.
All right, keep an eye on him.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
These guys are more resilient than I am.
Excuse me a second.
He's good.
You're working late tonight.
GEN-SYS needs three more.
Hey, Caesar!
Are you hurt?
Show me.
Caesar, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Sometimes, the new kid on the block gets picked on.
Stay calm. What did they do?
That's bullshit!
What's the problem here?
I'm taking him out of here, right now.
Not without a court order, you're not.
He's not yours, anymore.
I promise, if I find out he's been mistreated in any way,
I'll have this place shut down.
Go on ...
No. No, we're not going home, right now.
I'm going to get you out of here,
I promise.
You have to trust me.
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?
I think this visit's over.
Trust me.
You'll be okay.
Come on, move it!
Let's go!
There are hundreds of them!
Looks like you're own private zoo!
Rather like a prison for hairy dudes.
They watch TV?
We call it enrichment.
Aw, this one's so cute!
What's his name?
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.
Oh, my God!
Don't get too close!
This one scared me half to death.
That big guy is called, Maurice.
It's no fun.
Here, I'll show you something fun.
Check this out!
It's crazy!
You shouldn't be in here.
Hey, you're next!
Come on, let's go.
We spent too much time in here, as it is.
Come on!
Check out this guy.
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass.
He thinks he's special, or something
Freaky!
Hey, come here.
I think he's thinking or something.
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!
Let him go!
Let go!
Are you okay?
Yes.
I told you not to get too close, man.
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.
Some things aren't meant be changed.
You need to accept that.
Hey!
Hey!
What's going on here?
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping ...
Oh, no, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first!
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?
He's out sick for two days.
Well, I didn't authorized this.
No!
I did.
We agreed to test sparingly on one subject.
And, that one subject is stunning!
It's a virus. We don't know the human related effects.
The drug works, Will.
Tell him, Linda.
For starters, Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.
Every test result verifies its effectiveness.
No more tests.
- What are you ...?
Not until we have a better understanding of what we're dealing with.
Look, I'll tell you exactly what we do. Look ...
Give us a minute.
Excuse me! Put the ape back in the cage. Be gentle.
Will, I'll tell you exactly what we're dealing with, here.
We're dealing with a drug that is worth more than everything else we are developing, combined.
You make history,
I make money.
Isn't that our arrangement?
- No! There are risks.
Don't you tell me about risks.
You give your own father an experimental drug.
I could finish your career with one phone call.
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.
We will proceed without you.
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.
These tests need to be contained.
You have no idea if the 113 is stable, what kind of damage it can do to people ...
Well, that is why we test it on chimps, ... isn't it?
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!
Can you come to the door?
Doc!
Who the hell are you?
Get out of here!
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me, would you?
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.
They're not people, you know.
You gonna to let him go or not?
Caesar, ... hey, come on.
Come on, we're go home.
Home.
Come on, we're really going.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah ... Come on.
Caesar?
I guess he likes it better here with his own kind.
Damn it, Rodney,
You leave the hose out in the atrium, again?
What? No!
Come on! Let's go.
Come on, Get up!
Eight months after its launch,
Earth's first manned space flight to Mars ...
I ain't dodging.
I'm telling the truth.
Yeah, well, if I've didn't take the cookies,
Then, who the hell did?
I, I do not know ...
Hey! Will you two morons knock it off!
I'm going home.
Covered in water and therefore able to sustain life.
I get more peace in the
God-damned ape house.
Dad, I'm sorry!
Mr. Franklin, it's Dottie!
Mr. Franklin? ... Hello?
What the hell?
Rodney, get to the platform, now.
Rodney!
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?
Get!
Go on!
Get back in your cage!
I'm warning you!
Go on, get!
That's it!
That's what you get! ... Get back!
What's wrong with you?
Dumb monkey!
Take your stinking paw off me, you damn dirty ape!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
I'll beat all!
Caroline, have you been up to
Caesar's room?
No one's answering.
Landon!
Will!
Will!
What happened?
He spoke.
What are you ... what?
Your ape ... he spoke.
What in the hell?
I don't believe this.
I'll beat each and everyone of you.
I need someone to coordinate with the S.F.P.D.
Tell them we got a fatality.
What is it?
I know where he's headed.
Glenn?
Let's go!
Jacobs.
Mr. Jacobs, It's Linda from Will's team.
Look, something terrible has happened.
Franklin is dead from a viral infection.
What the hell are you talking about?
He was exposed to the 113.
It does something to people that it doesn't do to apes.
We'll have to go through the city and across the bridge.
Mr. Jacobs?
Mr. Jacobs, are you ...
What the hell?
I am Steven Jacobs!
It's full of apes in there.
I gotta get in the air!
We have to be able to destroy them.
Just, trust me on this!
Okay?
You might want to get your cameras ready. Normally, these guys are quit shy.
They're going the park, on the north side!
Find the lead!
You gotta hold the button!
The button!
They're being led. These apes are smarter than you think.
They've got a leader!
Do not tell them I am stuck in traffic.
Make up with something smarter!
Hold on.
What the ...
They're on the bridge.
They're trying to get to the redwoods.
SFPD, Police 1.
This is Air Ops,
Seal of south end.
What's the status of those units?
Ready to go, sir.
As soon as they reach you, block them.
North side, we're going to push them right to you.
No problem.
We're ready for them.
The north side is blocked.
They'll never get through here.
As soon as they hit the gap, we'll take them out!
You can just shoot them?
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
Good!
Turn that thing around!
Get off the bridge, sir.
I can't ...
You don't understand.
Get off this bridge, now!
This is an evacuation. Get out!
All the civilians, clear.
Please confirm.
Put these people off the bridge!
Stand by, city mounted units!
They're gonna slaughter them.
I'm gonna to get Caesar.
Will, hey!
You, be careful!
I gotta get to my car!
Get out of here!
Let go me! I have to get my car!
Push 'em north!
Get out of the way!
Hurry, we're going to lose them in the fog.
Do It!
Where are they? I don't see them!
CHP North, do you have a visual?
No, sir, negative.
Safety's off!
Hold your fire!
Back!
Caesar!
That's him! That's the leader!
They're in sight!
Put 'em down!
Help me!
Help me!
Take my hand!
Come, come on ...
Come on!
Not you ...
No!
Save me!
Caesar!
Caesar?
Caesar ... I'm sorry.
This is my fault.
This has to stop.
This isn't the way.
You know what they're capable of.
Please come home.
If you come home, I'll protect you.
Caesar is home.
Okay.
Caesar's home.
Go.
Billions of years ago...
...a race of immortals harnessed the most powerful force in existence:
The emerald energy of willpower.
These immortals, the Guardians of the Universe...
...built a world from where they could watch over all of existence:
The planet Oa.
They divided the universe into 3600 sectors.
A ring powered by the energy of will was sent to every sector to select a recruit.
In order to be chosen by the ring, it was said one must be without fear.
Together, these 3600 recruits...
...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers known as the Green Lantern Corps.
Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...
...the gravest was an entity of fear known as Parallax.
Only the legendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...
...was capable of capturing and imprisoning this beast...
...which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.
COMMANDER
You are afraid.
Good.
I mean, we go into this every time.
It's not every time.
No, honey. Think back.
Think back. Think back.
I was fine the last time. I'm usually fine.
I'm fine with your work.
Can I just tell you something?
- Of course you can.
I'm scared, honey.
Shh, shh.
Is everything okay?
Oh, you know how Mom gets the night before a test flight.
But you're not scared, are you, Dad?
Let's just say it's my job not to be.
Good night, son.
Hal, you're gonna be late.
Good morning, Mom. Gotta go.
Dad! Dad! Dad!
You think she'll break mach 3?
- We'll find out soon enough.
Hey, shouldn't you be in school?
Mr. Ferris raised the rear stabilizer.
Yes, he did.
The yaw rate gyros are calibrated, but the pitch is off 2 degrees.
I can live with that. How about the INS?
- Good to go.
Okay.
Johnny.
Be sure to check the ignition sequences.
- No problem.
We did, Carl, twice.
- Right.
And, uh, the gyros?
Did we do the gyro calibrations?
Hey, Carl.
Maybe Hal would like to join Carol up in your office.
The two of them can watch together.
- Come on, young man. Let's go find Carol.
Hal.
Keep it warm for me.
Hi.
- Oh, hey, Hector.
Hey. So, um, I have this book.
It's about the possibility of life on other planets.
Cool.
- Well, it almost has to exist, but...
Hal!
- Hey, Carol.
Hector. You still wanna trade Hot Wheels?
Sure.
Well, look who's here.
Our future test pilot.
Jacket suits you, son.
Hi, Dad.
- Hey.
I keep telling Hector, books are fun, but every once in a while...
...it's not such a bad idea to get out in the world, right, Hal?
Hey, Bob.
- The man of the hour.
Nothing like a first flight to get the blood boiling, eh, Carl?
Dad, can we watch from down in the field?
Sure.
Yes!
You kids be careful.
Stay with the engineers.
Go on, son. See it up close.
That's okay, Dad. I'll be fine.
Ferris Tower, Sabre One, ready for take-off.
Request unrestricted climb, flight level 450.
Yes! Yes!
Sabre One, unrestricted climb approved.
On passing 10,000 feet, contact Ferris Departure.
You're cleared for take-off.
Good luck, Sabre.
Whoo! Yeah, Dad!
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should...
Fentara is dead.
The planet's inhabitants?
Your mission to evacuate them is no longer necessary.
It's just as it was on Talok.
Every life form destroyed and their essence absorbed.
Traces of yellow power everywhere.
And the Guardians?
The Guardians are silent.
I've demanded an audience with them.
Abin Sur.
I'm badly wounded.
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet for the selection process.
Tell the Guardians it's Parallax.
No. No.
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?
There's, uh, water in the tap.
No!
Yup.
Asshole.
The Ferris Sabre llI is state-of-the-art of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.
It has all of the flying and combat capability of a human pilot...
...but with none of the human error that comes with it.
Carl isn't just blowing smoke to get a contract, general.
Your staff, these contractors, my office...
...we've all been part of this from the ground up.
Well, I appreciate that, senator.
But today the rubber meets the road.
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl's two best pilots.
Carol. Was gonna do a little flying today.
What do you think?
I think you're late.
Yes, but that's only because I slept in.
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.
Let me give you a little heads-up.
I've gone up against these Sabres all week and they smoked me every time.
There isn't anything you can do that they can't do better, faster...
...and without disappointing women everywhere.
I, uh, think we both know that's not true.
This is exactly why I didn't want you for this. My father did.
I would've gone with Jensen.
I'd have too, but unfortunately he's busy not being good enough.
At least he shows up.
Hal...
...this test today, it's important.
I'm gonna make you look good up there.
Don't worry, okay?
Now let's get these pants off and fly some planes.
Highball, weapon check now.
Roger that.
Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
Morning, everybody.
Gentlemen.
We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot at the merge.
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.
Fly safe, Highball.
Um, no.
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?
F-35s, what else?
Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.
You got a shot, now would be a great time.
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.
There's no way we're taking these out solo.
Get over here.
Let's figure something out.
On my way, Highball.
Now stay right there and look real pretty.
Highball, did you just use your wingman as a decoy?
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6 can fly anywhere you can.
Then let's go somewhere I can't fly.
What the hell is he up to?
Coffin corner.
Highball, rules of engagement set ceiling at 50,000 feet.
Yeah, because the Sabres will stall if they go any higher, right, Tom?
And so will you.
Compressor stall. Compressor stall.
Yes!
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.
Your boy certainly takes his job seriously.
Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.
I got it.
Hal.
Keep it warm for me.
Going through 25,000.
Hey, you okay, Highball?
Yeah, just taking my victory lap.
Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.
Yeah, Dad!
Hal, do you read me?
Highball, you're approaching minimum ejection altitude.
Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL.
Spin is unrecoverable.
Eject, eject, eject!
You're not scared, are you, Dad?
Let's just say it's my job not to be.
Dad!
Dad!
You stupid son of a bitch. You...
Stand down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.
It does matter.
Never mind that you crashed a brand-new F-35.
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.
And you blew the contract this company was depending on.
I'm sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.
I was under the impression the objective was to win.
No, the objective was to show what the Sabres could do in combat.
And in combat, no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.
I did.
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can't do.
You didn't have to make that point in front of Air Force Acquisitions.
That's enough, Carol.
Since I'm gonna have to lay off most of my company anyway, you're fired, Hal.
It's too late. I quit.
He's not fired and you don't quit.
You're grounded, pending the results of an investigation.
Watch your back.
That's impossible, Bob.
Tell me what happened.
- Controls locked up.
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a window when you could've recovered.
Did you choke?
You wouldn't be the first, but I need to know.
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?
What's with the ridiculous suit?
I know your dad's been bucking for you...
- The merits of my career choices...
You're a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.
I like it and I'm good at it.
Doesn't mean I'll never get in a cockpit again. It isn't one way or the other.
That's the way a child looks at things, and we aren't children anymore.
At least...
I just don't wanna see someone I care about getting hurt.
Least of all you.
Choose well.
A test pilot's daring maneuvers almost ended in tragedy.
Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan ejected at the last possible second...
...before his jet crashed in the open desert.
He's the son of the late Martin Jordan...
...who was killed in his own ill-fated test flight back in 1993.
We are told that Hal Jordan is doing fine right now...
...though we have yet to hear an official statement.
Hey, guys.
The incident has been a blow to a new high-tech aircraft program...
Hey. How was work?
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.
Just help me out here, because
I'm really trying to understand this.
Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be like him so bad?
You just assume it's my fault.
- I talked to Carl.
Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its limits...
That's my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.
Like your motorcycle accident that put you in the hospital for a month?
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.
Where's Jason?
In his room.
Why?
Hey, it's Uncle Hal.
What's up there, ace?
This is the worst 11 th birthday party
I've ever been to.
No dancing girls?
What's going on...? Hey.
Hey.
I'm fine.
I guess I got a little freaked out or something.
It happens.
Not to you.
Look...
...you don't have anything to worry about.
You wanna know why?
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up in every other part of my life...
...but the one thing I do know how to do is fly.
You know, I used to know this kid.
Was a funny-looking little bastard.
One day, he's standing on the mound, and he throws a perfect game.
That... That was me.
That was you?
Thought you looked familiar.
You were totally in the zone that day.
Remember?
I still dream about it.
- I bet.
Take it.
Close your eyes.
Go on.
Now...
...can you remember exactly how you felt that day?
That's how I feel when I'm flying.
Like that plane is a part of me.
No, it's like, no matter how bad things get...
...there's something good out there...
...just over the horizon.
I could really feel it.
Yeah.
Me too.
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.
Cool. It's an X-1, right?
It's a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.
Let's put it up.
What happened today?
I mean, when you crashed.
Not really sure, exactly.
Were you scared?
It's my job not to be.
You know, you're totally missing your super-lame birthday party.
Beat it. Go, go, go!
I'm glad you're okay.
Me too, ace.
Get off! No!
Aah! No!
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you some help.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.
Your name. Your name.
It's Hal. Hal Jordan.
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur, protector of Sector 2814.
Okay, hey, listen.
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.
The ring...
...it chose you.
Take it!
Place the ring in the lantern.
Place the ring, speak the oath...
What?
- Great honor, responsibility...
I don't understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?
All you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don't do that.
Hey, now, don't do that.
Oh, come on.
X-97 systems check complete.
Yo.
Come again?
Hmm.
Is that a spaceship?
Yeah.
Is it real?
It's real.
Did you see what kind of power source this thing uses?
Do you understand...?
- We can't stay.
We can't stay here.
- What?
Gotta go.
- What?
Pilot.
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.
He gave me this.
He proposed?
We're gone. We're gone, now!
They're gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don't bury themselves.
I couldn't just leave him there.
I hope this thing isn't radioactive.
Yeah, well, you're the genius. You... Aah!
- Aah!
Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!
Got it!
He said that the ring chose me.
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.
Responsibility?
Yeah.
- You?
Well, maybe on their planet
"responsibility" just means "asshole. "
Let's hope so.
A great light has gone out in the universe.
Abin Sur is dead.
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.
The inhabitants of two worlds annihilated by an unknown enemy.
An enemy that possesses the yellow power of fear.
We know it originated from within the Lost Sector.
We know it grows more powerful with each encounter.
According to Abin Sur's last transmission, he seemed to know what it was.
His only words were, "It's Parallax. "
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.
While you assess, innocent lives will be lost.
Let me take the fight to this enemy.
There is much of which you are not aware, Sinestro.
If the danger is as great as we suspect...
What are you saying?
You believe this enemy can defeat us?
Guardians, if your faith in our power has faltered, let me renew it.
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...
...and I'll prove to you our best days are not behind us.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hector Hammond?
We need to ask you to come with us.
Did Adam put you up to this?
Get out of the car, please.
Whoa.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Amanda Waller.
I must apologize for the theatrics, but the government does like its protocols.
Please, follow me.
Is that what I think it is?
An alien life form, doctor.
The first that mankind has ever encountered...
...despite what the conspiracy theorists would have you believe.
We want you to do the initial assessment of its physiology.
My God.
Why me?
As a xenobiologist, your skills are specifically suited to the task.
Beyond that...
...I'm not at liberty to tell you.
Hello.
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth are humanoid.
In the left anterior thoracic region is a 10-centimeter wound...
...with jagged edges containing attached cyanotic-colored coagulum.
Okay, all right.
Place the ring, then speak the oath.
The oath.
Because everybody knows the oath.
Used to sing it in camp.
I, Hal Jordan...
...do solemnly swear...
...to pledge allegiance...
...to a lantern...
...that I got from a dying purple alien...
...in a swamp.
The epidermis is magenta.
It appears transparent and is extremely thin...
...allowing visualization of muscles and individual muscle fibers.
"To infinity and beyond. "
"By the power of Grayskull. "
What the hell?!
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle of nowhere, you'd think that you...
No!
In brightest day, in blackest night...
...no evil shall escape my sight.
Let those who worship evil's might...
...beware my power:
Green Lantern's light.
Carol.
Everything okay in there?
- It's fine.
Well, can I come in?
No.
Yeah, no, because we're...
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?
Can we talk?
- Yeah.
We can talk and drink.
My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.
I don't need to tell you that the mere fact that it's humanoid is extraordinary.
It's indicating a convergent evolution, or perhaps a common ancestry...
...and the implications of that are staggering.
I mean, where did it come from?
This could completely change the way that the world views itself.
You imagine the way that the public will react to this?
Um, but I know that that won't happen. I do.
Like yourself, doctor,
I'm a seeker of truth.
But the people who pay for facilities like this...
...have other priorities and the power to enforce them.
So I keep it a secret.
People like us have to work within the system, doctor.
We do the best we can.
Right.
Pick that up.
I, um...
I'm really sorry.
Did you just apologize?
You haven't been replaced by an alien or something?
No.
I'm good.
Ah. I'm good.
I'm good, totally good. Uh...
Do you think I'm irresponsible?
No need to answer. That's fine.
Hal. Ha, ha.
You look pretty.
And we haven't been in this place together since...
...that night.
You forgot it was my birthday.
Did I?
Mm.
That was also the night...
The first time that we ever...
...flew together.
You've been flying ever since with anyone who'd get in the plane.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
Come on.
No, yeah, let's go.
Mm-mm.
Dance with me.
- No.
No.
Hal. No.
No.
I really am sorry.
Oh. It's okay.
The contract isn't quite dead yet.
I told you I was good at this.
I wasn't talking about the contract.
I would've screwed this up. You know?
Even if I didn't go to the Air Force...
...I would've found some way to...
You and me, I would've blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?
Mm. What do you tell yourself?
That you were scared
I was getting too close.
You know what I spent my afternoon doing?
What?
Worrying about you.
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.
What happened up there?
Thanks for the dance.
I told you to watch your back.
You cost us all our jobs, you son of a bitch.
Pathetic.
Bastard's been living off his old man's reputation his whole life.
Hey.
Hey!
My face is just getting warmed up.
Whoa.
Have you concluded admiring yourself?
Uh...
Yeah.
Well, your ring translator is functioning properly.
Your mask will appear when protection of your identity is required.
There is no need for it on Oa.
A talking fish.
Actually, my race is Xudarian.
Our DNA does somewhat resemble your own ichthyological species.
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813 and home to...
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.
How do I know that?
The induction process.
It activates the ring's higher functions, including a working knowledge base.
In truth, we were curious.
The process had never been attempted on a species as young as humans before.
As you are the first to be chosen,
I've been sent to welcome you here.
And here is?
Welcome to Oa.
This planet has been our home for countless millennia.
It was created for us by the Guardians.
Guardians?
There stands their Citadel.
They are immortals, among the most ancient of races.
They made all you see and are responsible for all we are and do.
Since time immemorial, the Green Lantern Corps...
...has served as the keepers of peace, order and justice throughout the universe.
To be chosen to join its ranks is the highest of honors...
...and the greatest of responsibilities.
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.
We're going to fly now.
Fly?
- Absolutely.
All right.
I can do that.
Join me.
I can do that.
Yeah!
Whoa!
What is that?
It's the energy that's generated from the Central Battery.
Its power comes from the will of every living creature in the universe.
It, in turn, charges your lantern, which, in turn, charges your ring.
Even your suit is comprised entirely of energy.
What's with all the green?
Green is the color of will.
The Guardians harnessed will...
...because it's the strongest source of energy in the universe.
There's so many.
The stars you can see from your home planet on the clearest night...
...your sector is a thousand times larger.
And 3600 Lanterns, each with a sector just as vast.
Lanterns, I've called you here to this unprecedented gathering...
...because we face an unprecedented danger.
Our four Lantern brothers were killed by an enemy called Parallax.
An enemy we don't yet fully understand.
We do know it's powerful enough to destroy entire civilizations.
Powerful enough to defeat even Abin Sur...
...our finest warrior...
...whose light can never be replaced.
The Guardians have charged me to lead a squadron of Lanterns...
...in an assault on Parallax.
We will seek out and find this enemy.
And we will destroy it.
Alone, we are now vulnerable.
United, we are still invincible.
We have never been defeated.
Will we be defeated now?
No!
It was for this moment that we were created.
But I don't need to tell you your duty.
I don't need to tell you who we are.
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!
Your will turns thought into reality.
To master the ring, you must learn to focus your will...
...and create what you see in your mind.
The ring's limits are only what you can imagine.
Do that again.
Now you try.
Concentrate.
The ring will inform you where there is an imminent threat.
This particular threat's name is Kilowog.
He'll be your combat training officer.
Whoa!
- Never let your guard down, poozer.
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.
Or as I like to call it:
The worst day of your worthless life.
The human. Ain't never seen one before.
You smell funny.
- Ugh.
I smell funny?
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.
You want to be a Lantern?
You gotta commit to the Corps.
All right, poozer.
Let's see what you've got.
Your constructs are only gonna be as strong as your will.
And your will is pathetic.
I'm gonna work you and I'm gonna hit you...
...until your will is strong enough to be worthy of the Corps.
Next lesson.
Ha, ha. Feel that?
It's the gravitational pull of your average sun.
Makes flying through space very dangerous.
The bigger you are, the quicker you burn.
Gravity's a bitch.
Here, let me help you.
Remember, your enemy, he's not gonna play fair.
Well, that's good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.
So...
...this is the human.
When I learned Abin Sur's ring had chosen you...
...I said there had to be a mistake.
I see nothing to change my mind.
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.
The Corps is only as strong as its weakest link.
And I will tolerate no weak links.
You understand me?
Are you afraid, human?
Are you afraid?
Don't.
Don't do that.
Shall we?
Sure.
A sword?
How human.
I do believe I smell fear.
I'm a Green Lantern.
I fear nothing.
Fear is the enemy of will.
Will is what makes you take action.
Fear is what stops you and makes you weak.
Makes your constructs feeble.
You must ignore your fear.
When you're afraid, you can't act.
When you can't act, you can't defend.
If you can't defend, you die.
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.
Abin Sur was a great warrior.
My mentor.
My friend.
You insult his memory by wearing his ring.
I'm done. He's right. I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend the universe.
A few days ago, we thought we were the only ones in the universe.
The ring chose you. It wouldn't have if it hadn't seen something in you.
Oh, yeah?
Something you yourself don't yet see.
The ring never makes a mistake.
This time it did. that until recently, we didn't realize...
...that many of these little critters that we've been calling bacteria weren't bacteria at all.
They were an entirely different type of primitive prokaryotic cell.
These little buggers, called archaeans, are still poorly understood.
Um...
But might turn out to be different from bacteria...
But might turn out to be as different from bacteria as bacteria is from us.
Some call them extremophiles...
...because they live in the most extreme environments on Earth, such as...
God, he's so boring.
...the boiling waters of a geyser.
What a loser.
Michael!
- Huh?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Did you just call me a loser?
What kind of freak is this guy?
"Freak"?!
Class dismissed.
So how you been?
Been a while.
So you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?
You need to get some sleep, son.
Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?
Well, actually, you've already done it.
For me and for your country.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you impressing a whole lot of very important people.
Where did you get that?
I'm on a subcommittee overseeing the agencies involved.
Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That's why they chose me.
Because of this, we're gonna be able to get you a top post on the inside now...
...helping to oversee the operation.
There are scientists that worked their whole lives for this.
Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.
And less connected.
Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.
You have to seize an opportunity when it presents itself.
HAMMOND
He'll never get it.
Just wasting his life away.
What an embarrassment.
Bill! Ha. How are you?
I'm terrific.
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.
With my own eyes I saw this creature induce fear in our finest warriors...
...and then feed on that fear.
There's more.
We've tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.
Never before has an enemy dared attack us here.
You must tell me what you know.
Will has always been our sole weapon...
...against the forces of darkness in the universe.
But as that power began to seem insufficient...
...a great debate arose among us.
Should we exploit another source of power...
...one we had long since sworn should never be used?
Fear.
But the power of fear was too unpredictable.
The chance of corruption too great.
And so we decided against it.
All of us, that is, except one.
Alone, this Guardian entered the forbidden chamber.
He wanted to prove the light of fear could be mastered.
His intentions were pure...
...but his hopes were naive.
Consumed by the yellow power of fear...
...the Guardian became the very evil he had wished to destroy.
He became Parallax.
For the universe's safety and his own...
...Abin Sur was charged with imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.
But he escaped.
Feeding on the fear of others, he grew larger, more powerful.
And is now headed here...
...to take his revenge on you and destroy the Corps.
Then we have no choice.
We must prepare to harness the power of our enemy and fight fear with fear.
To protect our sectors, we must be able to defend ourselves.
We must forge a yellow ring.
Watch your step.
Senator.
Senator.
Don't have to worry about me no more
I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Hello.
Hi.
Everybody get on your feet
You make me nervous
When you're in your seat
Rough night, huh?
Hector.
How you doing?
What have you been up to?
Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I've ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.
I've been called both.
Glad you could make it, son.
- I was a little surprised I got the invite.
No, you're family, Hal.
There are thinkers in this world and there are doers.
And you are one of the doers.
Yeah, but the thinkers make what I do possible.
Wouldn't have a plane unless someone thought it up.
Of course.
Excuse me, I need a drink.
I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.
Nice to see you, son.
You too. You too.
Nice.
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.
I was talking about your dress.
Nice jacket.
Last time I checked, you didn't even own one.
Yeah, I've been shaking up the wardrobe lately.
Congratulations on the contract.
How'd you manage to pull that off?
I pointed out you only won because you broke the rules of engagement.
And Tom figured out how to give the Sabres more altitude.
So I guess in a way, without even meaning to...
...you actually did us a favor.
Look...
...I'm uncomfortable with the word "hero. "
Hey
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.
Great evening.
Somebody very special I'd like to thank for helping us to nail this contract:
My daughter, Carol Ferris.
Come on!
Congratulations, Carol.
I take one look at you, young lady...
...or at Hal Jordan over there, spitting image of his dad...
Whoo!
- You give us hope.
A toast to our future.
Hear, hear!
To the future!
We're in good hands.
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!
Congratulations. Um...
Thank you.
Here's to you and Hal, the future.
Yeah, heh, I'm sorry.
I know it couldn't have been easy growing up with your dad.
But, hey, you're doing great, so... Ha, ha.
I am. I'm doing great. Ha, ha.
He's right, though. I'm not a doer.
Ha, ha.
Although I did get to examine an alien body recently.
That was very cool.
I can't tell anyone about it, but, hey, you can't have everything.
Hector telling you another of his science-fiction stories?
What the hell's wrong with him?
Can't keep his mouth shut.
You really do have a creative imagination.
Bye.
Senator.
I apologize. We really must go.
Good night, Carol.
- Good night.
Senator!
Hey.
Thanks for everything.
Bye, senator!
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter's going down.
Oh, my God.
What is that? What is that?
What happened tonight took place in just a matter of seconds...
...but people will be talking about it for years to come.
A helicopter careening out of control, headed toward certain tragedy...
...when all of a sudden, a mystery man, a hero, saves the day...
...incredibly diverting the helicopter from destroying innocent people...
...and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.
The real question tonight is who is this amazing hero and where is he now?
Start talking.
A racetrack?
- Yeah.
Hmm.
That's the best you could come up with for your first big appearance? Racetrack.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?
I materialized a track out of pure energy, saving hundreds, and you're disappointed.
I'm sorry about that.
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.
I wanna see the outfit, the flying...
You gotta show me.
Hal, being your best friend's no picnic.
It's for emergencies!
- You owe me!
Hal, I wanna see it.
Fine.
Hold on to your glasses.
All right.
Question:
You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.
Ring.
Finger.
Here we go.
Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...
It's out of juice. I have to recharge it.
Now pay attention.
Aah! Green!
Wow.
- I know, right?!
Whoo!
Not bad, huh?
You're a superhero.
Don't they always get the girl?
Evening, ma'am.
Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm glad to have a chance to thank you.
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.
No, it is.
You saved my life.
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...
Hal?
Miss?
Hal?!
Oh, my Go... Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?
What? I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!
You don't think I would recognize you because I can't see your cheekbones?!
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?
What the hell is with that mask?!
It came with the outfit.
Cool, huh?
So it all works because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.
No, there's no such thing as magic.
Intergalactic green peacekeepers, thousands of them.
Ha, ha.
- But, no.
I'm not making it up.
I mean, when we were kids, who'd have thought?
I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I said, "One day I'll be a green space cop. "
Here I am.
Okay, so at the party, how did you make that big green ramp thing?
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.
Anything?
Anything.
Happy birthday. Better late than never.
Um...
Okay, so how does it work?
They just, um, call you on your cell,
"Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way"?
No. I don't think it works exactly like that.
Well, technically speaking, um...
...I actually sort of, uh...
...quit.
What do you mean? How?
Well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting anything else, really.
I don't understand.
How do you walk away from something like that?
Is that even possible?
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.
If for once you didn't quit something you cared about...
...what's the worst that could happen?
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.
I know I've made a lot of mistakes...
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.
I feel bad for you, really.
You've been given so much so often.
And you just...
Good night.
Dr. Hammond?
There is something I'd like to show you.
Something I'm fairly certain you'll want to see.
See you later, Mom.
I love you.
Bye, baby.
No!
Physical contact accesses mnemonic data.
I can see your memories.
Dad.
Son, this is my fault.
But I'm gonna fix it.
We're gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We detected traces of a second alien life form...
...buried within the body of the first.
You've been exposed.
I've never felt better in my life.
We know everything, son.
I've never felt better in my life.
To be chosen to join its ranks is the highest of honors...
...and the greatest of responsibilities.
The ring never makes a mistake.
It's gonna be all right.
They just need to run some tests, that's all.
Keep him under.
I only want what's best for you.
Run.
Hector.
Shh, shh.
Don't worry.
I only want what's best for you.
The ring, it chose you.
Take it!
Hal.
Hi.
The alien was one of you.
How did we end up so different?
Hmm? Hmm?
Sit down!
Now...
...how's Carol?
That came out wrong.
- Please.
I've made mistakes...
- Look, Hal...
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.
You're just as much of a failure as I was.
And just as afraid.
Well...
...I used to fight my fear.
But now that I've tasted its true power...
...I'll never go back.
No!
You wear the ring of the Lantern that imprisoned me.
You will suffer the same fate.
Once I have devoured your world...
...I will have all the strength I need...
...to defeat the Corps and destroy the Guardians.
Let me get this straight.
This thing that's out there attacking planets is connected to Hector?
Somehow it infected him after it killed Abin Sur.
Well, you're just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it, huh?
Well, I tried that and I failed.
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?
The one thing that a Green Lantern is supposed to be is fearless.
Fearless is the job description.
That isn't me.
So you're just gonna walk away again?
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.
Because I'm afraid!
You don't think your dad ever felt afraid?
If he did, he figured out some way to beat it.
Yeah, well, there's a word for that:
Courage.
They said that the ring wouldn't have chosen me if it didn't see something.
Something I don't see. Yet.
I see it.
I always have.
The ring didn't see that you were fearless.
It saw that you had the ability to overcome fear.
It saw that you're courageous.
Which you are.
Just like your dad.
The Lantern is a threat.
Eliminate him.
Our new weapon is ready.
Once I've mastered its power...
...I'll begin training the Corps to do the same.
Though Earth will be lost...
...we'll be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.
Then the power of the enemy will be ours.
At what cost?
You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.
You gotta help me save my world.
I know that humans aren't the strongest species, or the smartest.
We're young, we have a lot to learn.
But we're worth saving.
This new weapon of yours, you can't use it.
Once you cross that line, once you've given in to fear, you'll never go back. I've seen it.
Look, I know right now you're afraid.
You dare accuse the Guardians of feeling fear?
Yes, I do.
That's exactly why Parallax is beating you...
...because you're afraid to even admit you're afraid.
I know.
I spent my entire life doing it.
You know, we have a saying on Earth.
We say, "I'm only human. "
We say it because we're vulnerable, we say it because we know we're afraid.
It doesn't mean we're weak.
Help me save my planet.
Don't give in to fear.
Fight it. Fight it with me.
Your words are compelling, young human.
But as immortals, we must measure our actions over billions of years...
...and the fate of the universe.
We simply cannot risk losing everything on the chance you might be right.
Then don't. Don't risk any more lives.
Just mine.
Let me go fight for my world...
...and I'll show you that will is stronger than fear.
There is no way you can succeed.
You will die, Hal Jordan.
Then I'll die trying.
Good luck, Green Lantern.
I wouldn't do that.
Look closely.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.
But she could never see me, as you were always standing in the way.
But not anymore.
No! No! Don't! Don't do this, Hector.
Please.
I know how you feel.
Come on, look at yourself!
No, I know what it's like...
...to not live up to expectations...
...to feel like nothing that you do will ever be good enough.
I know what it's like to be afraid.
Let me help you.
Hal. You've changed.
How wonderful that all it took for you to grow up was the end of the world.
Now it's my turn.
And if I can't be like you,
I'm gonna make her like me.
And let's face it, once she's like me...
...then you wouldn't be very interested.
Hmm? Now, would you?
Why can't you?
- Hmm?
Why can't you be like me?
Heh. Huh?
Let her go...
...and you can have it.
You can do anything.
Be anything.
Take it.
Let her make the choice.
Okay.
Wow.
Now bring her down.
Hal.
I lied.
I lied too.
See, the way it works is...
...you have to be chosen.
You have failed me.
Stay here.
No problem.
Your will is strong, but not strong enough.
You are nothing without the ring.
POLICEMAN
You must move out of the area now.
Please clear the streets.
Clear the streets immediately.
You can never beat this. You'll die.
At least I can get it away from here.
How do you think you're gonna do that?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe I can outthink it or...
The dogfight, remember?
Those were a couple of jets.
Unbeatable jets.
The ring chose me for a reason.
This is why.
Look, I'm probably not...
- Please don't. No.
Hey.
POLICEMAN
This is a mandatory evacuation.
Everyone must clear the streets immediately.
Police emergency, everyone must clear the street now.
Everybody off now! Now!
Go! Go!
Run!
Run!
- Aah! Aah!
I feel your fear growing.
You will be dead soon.
In brightest day, in blackest night...
And when you're gone,
I'll destroy everything you ever loved. no evil shall escape my sight.
Your family, your home, your planet will be no more.
Let those who worship evil's might...
The entire human race will be wiped out because you, Hal Jordan...
...were afraid. beware my power:
Green Lantern's light!
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.
Though his time wearing the ring has been brief...
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be remembered as long as the Corps exists.
His actions are a reminder of why the ring chose each of us.
To overcome fear...
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.
As Lanterns, we must fight with all our will.
Our wills haven't always been united.
It's time they were.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?
You're impertinent, Hal Jordan.
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.
It seems Abin Sur found another just like himself.
Wow, I am never getting used to that.
My new job requires that I travel.
Be away for a while.
Away, never gone.
Hal.
Yeah?
Can you take off the mask?
That's really cool. Ha, ha.
So, what happens now?
I'm gonna go look for trouble.
Of all the Lanterns who have ever worn the ring...
...there was one whose light shined brightest.
At first, his humanity was thought to be a weakness.
And yet it proved to be his greatest strength.
When I was a kid, whenever I'd feel small or lonely...
...I'd look up at the stars.
Wondered if there was life up there.
Turns out I was looking in the wrong direction.
When alien life entered our world it was from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.
A fissure between two tectonic plates.
A portal between dimensions.
The Breach.
I was 15 when the first Kaiju made land in San Francisco.
By the time tanks, jets and missiles took it down...
...six days and 35 miles later...
...three cities...
...were destroyed.
Tens of thousands...
...of lives were lost.
We mourned...
...our dead...
...memorialized the attack...
...and moved on.
And then, only six months later...
...the second attack...
...hit Manila.
The acid factor of the Kaiju blood...
...creates a toxic phenomenon named Kaiju Blue.
And then the third one hit Cabo.
And then the fourth.
And then we learned...
...this was not gonna stop.
This was just the beginning.
We needed...
...a new weapon.
The world came together...
pooling its resources and throwing aside...
...old rivalries...
...for the sake of the greater good.
To fight monsters...
...we created monsters of our own.
The Jaeger program...
...was born.
There were setbacks at first.
The neural load to interface...
...with a Jaeger proved too much for a single pilot.
A two-pilot system was implemented.
Left-hemisphere, right-hemisphere pilot control.
We started winning.
Jaegers stopping Kaijus everywhere.
But the Jaegers were only as good as their pilots.
So Jaeger pilots...
...turned into rock stars.
Danger...
...turned into propaganda.
Kaijus...
...into toys.
We got really good at it.
Winning.
Then...
Then it all...
...changed.
Gipsy Danger report to Bay 08, level A-42.
Kaiju. Code name: Knifehead.
Category 3. 8700 metric tons.
Yo, Yancy, wake up! Movement...
...in the Breach.
- Hey, come on! We're being deployed.
- Great.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Kaiju's a Category 3, biggest one yet.
Code name: Knifehead.
- What time is it?
- Two.
Yep.
What do you say?
Fifth notch on the belt?
Come on, Beckets.
Time for the drop.
Hey, kid.
Yeah?
Don't get cocky.
Years before...
you wouldn't have picked my brother Yancy and I for heroes.
No chance.
All right, let's suit up and kick some ass!
We were never star athletes.
Never at the head of the class.
But we could hold our own in a fight.
And it turned out we had...
...a unique skill:
We were Drift compatible.
Data on helmet.
Data relay gel dispersing in circuitry suit.
Good morning, Becket boys!
- Tendo, what's happening, my man?
- How'd that date with Alison...
go last night, Mr. Choi?
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.
You're gonna get your ass kicked.
Ha, ha. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, brother.
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.
Engaging drop, sir.
Marshal Pentecost on deck.
Securing the Conn Pod.
Getting ready to drop.
Conn Pod door lock secure.
- Release for drop.
- Gipsy Danger...
...ready for the big drop.
- Here we go.
- Yeah!
Here we go!
Coupling confirmed, sir.
Engage pilot-to-pilot protocol.
Engaging now.
Pilot to-pilot connection...
protocol sequence.
Gipsy launch, Bay 6.
Gipsy Danger...
- ...ready and aligned, sir.
- Rangers, this is Marshal...
...Stacker Pentecost.
Prepare for neural handshake.
Starting in 15 seconds.
Fourteen...
...thirteen...
...twelve, eleven, ten.
Ready to step into my head, kid?
Please, after you. Age...
...before beauty, old man.
- Pilot-to-pilot connection...
protocol sequence.
Neural handshake initiated.
The Drift.
Jaeger tech.
Based on DARPA jet fighter neural systems.
Two pilots, mind-melding through memories...
...with the body of a giant machine.
The deeper the bond...
...the better you fight.
Neural handshake...
...strong and holding.
Right hemisphere is calibrating.
Left hemisphere...
...calibrating.
Proofed...
...and transmitting.
Gentlemen, your orders...
...are to hold the miracle mile off Anchorage. Copy?
Copy that, sir.
Sir, there's still a civilian vessel in the Gulf...
You're protecting a city of two million people.
You will not risk those lives for a boat that holds ten.
- Am I clear?
- Yes...
- ...sir.
- Man, that's cold.
You know what I'm thinking.
I'm in your brain.
- I know.
- Then let's go fishing.
Here we go!
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!
Worry about yourself, kiddo!
There are things you can't fight, acts of God.
You see a hurricane coming...
you have to get out of the way.
But when you're in a Jaeger, suddenly...
you can fight the hurricane.
You can win.
Get them tied down...
...and go down below! Now!
How far to the mainland?
Seven miles off Anchorage, sir.
But we won't even make it past the shallows.
No, we won't!
What about that island three miles east?
No! It's two miles, sir.
One mile, sir!
It's getting closer.
How the hell...
...can it be getting closer?
Kaiju.
Harder starboard!
Turn her around!
Now!
- Oh, God!
- What the hell?
Hang on!
Ship secure.
- Adjust the torque!
- I'm on it.
Torque locked.
Get him. Come on.
- Shoot him.
- I'm on it! I'm on it!
Discharge reading, sir.
Plasma cannon in the shallow shelves...
...seven miles off the coastal line.
- Gipsy...
...what the hell is going on?
- Job's done, sir.
Lit it up twice. Bagged our fifth kill.
- You disobeyed a direct order!
- Respectfully, sir...
...we intercepted a Kaiju...
...and saved everyone...
- ...on that boat.
- Get back to your post. Now!
Yes, sir.
Kaiju signature rising!
That thing's still alive, sir.
Gipsy!
We're still getting a signature!
That Kaiju is still alive!
Grab the boat and get out of there.
You copy?
Grab the boat and get out of there now!
Take it, Raleigh!
I got this!
Loccent, we're hit!
Left arm's...
...gone cold, sir.
The hull! It went through the hull!
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need... Aah!
No!
No!
Loading.
Second discharge fried all the comms, sir. I'm not getting any signals.
No signatures, sir.
What do we do now, sir?
Now, I want you to keep your eye on that gauge there.
Now, you know what I'd like to find?
I'd like to find a whole ship.
That's what I'd like to find.
Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!
Right there, right there! Dig!
Hey, what is it?
It's just an old toy.
We never find anything good.
Listen.
Oh, my God.
Stay here!
Mister?
Can I help?
Yancy.
Yancy.
Run! Get help, fast!
It's gonna be all right.
The Kaiju are learning our defenses.
They're adapting. Evolving.
And we're losing Jaegers faster than we can build them.
Lima.
Seattle.
Vladivostok.
Category 4 Kaijus...
...are now coming through the Breach.
I think even you can see, marshal, this is no longer...
...a sound strategy.
The frequency of the attacks has increased.
The Jaegers are not the most viable line of defense anymore.
I am aware.
Those are my rangers that die...
...every time a Jaeger falls...
...which is why I'm asking you...
...for one last chance.
- Excuse me, marshal.
One final assault with everything we've got.
The Jaeger program is dead, marshal.
On the other hand, the coastal wall...
program is a promising option.
The world appreciates all that you and your men have done...
...but it's over.
We will authorize you to take all remaining Jaegers...
...to the last battle statio: Hong Kong.
We're prepared to fund you...
...for the next eight months while the coastal wall...
...is completed.
After that, you will receive no further support.
You have your answer, marshal.
So that's it?
It's over?
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.
That's all they are, Stacker.
We don't need them.
Eight hundred more beams.
Ration cards, guys! Come on, come on!
Let's go!
Now, I got good news and I got bad news, fellas. Which one...
- ...you wanna hear first?
- Bad news!
Three guys died yesterday working the top of the wall.
- What's the good news?
- The good news is...
...I got three new job openings.
Top of the wall.
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?
Come on!
I am here in Sydney, where earlier today...
yet another Kaiju attack took place.
The Kaiju, an enormous Category 4...
...broke through the coastal wall...
...in less than an hour.
The Wall of Life had been deemed unbreachable by its builders.
Why the hell...
...are we even building this thing?
That thing went through the wall like it was nothing.
Ironically, it was...
...the recently decommissioned Jaeger,
Striker Eureka...
piloted by Herc...
...and Chuck Hansen that finally...
...took the beast down.
Look, they decommissioned the Jaeger program...
...because of mediocre pilots.
It's that simple.
That's Striker Eureka's tenth kill to date. It's a new record.
And you're still going to Hong Kong, even at a time like this?
Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?
Chuck Hansen, one of the pilots...
...of Striker Eureka...
...the Jaeger that took down the Kaiju.
Mr. Becket.
Marshal.
Looking sharp.
Long time.
Five years, four months.
Can I have a word?
Step into my office, marshal.
Took me a while to find you.
Anchorage, Sheldon Point, Nome...
Yeah, a man in my position...
...travels with the wall, chasing shifts to make a living.
What do you want?
I've spent the last six months activating everything I can get my hands on.
There's an old Jaeger, a Mark 3.
You may know it. It needs a pilot.
I'm guessing I wasn't your first choice.
You are my first choice.
All the other Mark 3 pilots are dead.
Look...
...I can't have anyone else in my head again.
I'm done.
I was still connected to my brother when he died.
I can't go through that again, man,
I'm sorry.
Haven't you heard, Mr. Becket?
The world is coming to an end.
So where would you...
...rather die?
Here, or in a Jaeger?
Mr. Becket...
...this is Mako Mori.
One of our brightest.
Also in charge of the Mark 3 restoration program.
She personally handpicked your copilot candidates.
Hey.
At ease.
We will tour the facility first...
...and then Miss Mori will show you to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.
- Wait for us, please!
- Hold the door...
- ...please!
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Stay back. Kaiju specimens are extremely rare...
...so look but don't touch, please.
Mr. Becket, this is our research team.
Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Geiszler.
Oh, no, call me Newt.
Only my mother calls me Doctor.
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello.
I have asked you not to refer to me by my first name around others.
I am a doctor with over 10 years of decorated experience...
Ten years! I'm very sorry.
- Oh, please.
- Who is that...
...Yamarashi?
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.
My brother and I took him down in 2017.
You know he was one of the biggest
Category 3s ever?
He was 2500 tons of awesome.
Or awful. You know, whatever you wanna call it.
Please excuse him. He's a Kaiju groupie. He loves them.
Shut up, Hermann, I don't love them, okay? I study them.
And unlike most people, I wanna see one alive and up close one day.
Trust me...
...you don't want to.
So that's your Research Division?
Things have changed.
We're not an army anymore, Mr. Becket.
We're the resistance.
Welcome to the Shatterdome.
War clock. We reset it after every
Kaiju attack. Keeps everyone focused.
The frequency of attacks is accelerating.
How long till the next reset?
A week, if we're lucky.
My experts believe there'll be a Kaiju attack...
...even before that.
This complex used to lodge...
...30 Jaegers in five bays just like this one.
Now we only have four Jaegers left.
I didn't know it was this bad.
It is that bad.
Crimson Typhoon, China.
One of the greatest.
Assembled in Changzhou.
Full titanium core, no alloys.
Fifty diesel engines per muscle strand.
Deadly, precise fighter.
She's piloted by the Wei Tang brothers. Triplets.
Local lads.
They've successfully defended
Hong Kong port seven times.
They use the Thundercloud formation.
Hell, yeah. Triple-arm technique.
Very effective.
That tank, last of the T-90s.
Chemo Alpha.
First generation Mark 1. The heaviest and oldest Jaeger in the service.
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket, it's a brutal war machine.
And those two:
Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky.
Yeah, I've heard of them.
Perimeter patrol, Siberian wall.
On their watch it stayed unbreached for six years. Six years.
Herc! Chuck!
Gentlemen, welcome to Hong Kong!
Wait here.
Max! Come here!
- Remember me?
- Don't drool...
...over Miss Mori. Sees a pretty girl...
...and he gets all wound up.
Raleigh, this is Hercules Hansen, an old friend from the Mark 1 glory days.
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.
- It was a three Jaeger team drop.
- That's right. Manila.
Sorry about your brother.
Thank you, sir.
Herc and his son Chuck'll be running point using Striker Eureka.
Fastest Jaeger...
...in the world.
First and last of the Mark 5s.
Australia decommissioned it a day before the Sydney attack.
- Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
- Yep.
- Now it's running point for us.
- Wait, running point on what?
You haven't told me what I'm doing here yet.
We're going for the Breach, Mr. Becket.
We're gonna strap a 2400 pound thermonuclear warhead to Striker's back.
Detonate an equivalent of 1.2...
...million tons of TNT.
And you and two other Jaegers...
- ...will be running defense for them.
- Thought we were the resistance.
Where'd you get something that big?
See the Russians back there?
They can get us anything.
Herc, shall we?
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll show you to your Jaeger now.
- Miss Mori...
...will you give me a minute?
Marshal!
Sir, we've hit the Breach before.
It doesn't work. Nothing goes through.
What's changed?
I've got a plan. I need you ready.
That's all.
Let's go, Herc!
Max, come here!
Crew 17...
please report to the fifth floor.
Zero minus two.
XY minus two. R-E-Q...
In the beginning, the Kaiju attacks were spaced by 24 weeks.
Then twelve, then six, then every two weeks.
The last one in Sydney was a week.
In four days...
...we could be seeing a Kaiju every eight hours...
...until they are coming every four minutes.
Marshal, we should witness a double event within seven days.
Mr. Gottlieb, I'm to drop a 2400 pound thermonuclear bomb...
...I need more than...
- ...a prediction.
- Well, uh...
...that's a problem, then...
...because see, he actually can't give you anything more than a prediction.
No Kaiju entrails over my side of the room. You know the rules.
- Every bloody day. It's incessant.
- Gents! On point.
Numbers do not lie.
Politics and poetry, promises, these are lies.
Numbers are as close as we get to the handwriting of God.
- What?
- Would you give me a moment?
There will be a double event.
And then, shortly thereafter, three. And then four...
And then we're dead.
- I get it.
- Alas.
This is where the good news comes.
Here is our universe...
...and here is theirs.
And this is what we call "The Throat," the passage between the Breach and us.
We know that it's atomic in nature.
I predict that the increased traffic...
...will force the Breach to stabilize...
...and remain open long enough...
...to get the device through...
...and collapse its structure.
Yeah, and that's...
...where I gotta chime in because, really...
...I wouldn't wanna go in there with that limited amount of information.
Newton, don't embarrass yourself.
Just hear me out for a second.
Give me a second.
Please.
Why do we judge the Kaiju on a category system?
It's because each one...
...is completely different from the next, right?
You see what I'm saying? Like, one looks like a shark and one looks like a fish...
Dr. Geiszler. Just get to the point.
- Yes.
- The point is...
...I don't think they're all completely different after all.
These are some samples
I collected, all right?
Now, this one here was harvested in Sydney.
And this was harvested in Manila.
Six years ago.
They have the same exact DNA.
They're clones.
And this is...
...the point where he goes completely crazy.
There's so much more to the Kaiju than we understand.
And we've really only scratched the surface.
This is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.
Now, unfortunately, it's damaged.
It's a little bit weak.
But it's still alive. Now, I think...
...I can tap into it...
...using the same technology that allows the two Jaeger pilots...
...to share a neural bridge.
Now, think about that.
I could tell you exactly...
...how to get through the Breach yourselves.
You're suggesting that we initiate a Drift with a Kaiju?
No, no. No, no. Not like a whole Kaiju, you know, just a tiny piece of its brain.
The neural surge would be too much...
- ...for the human brain.
- I agree.
- I don't agree.
- Gottlieb...
...I'd like your data on my desk ASAP.
Sir.
- No, but his is so...
- Thank you, Newt.
Guys, now, this is the most amazing thing...
Newton, I know that you're desperate to be right...
...so you've not wasted your life being a Kaiju groupie...
...but it's not going to work.
It is going to work, Hermann.
And I'll tell you...
...something else.
- Fortune favors the brave, dude.
- You heard them.
They won't give you the equipment and even if they did...
...you'd kill yourself.
Or I'd be a rock star.
There she is.
Oh, my God.
Look at her.
Gipsy Danger.
God, it's so beautiful.
She looks like new.
Better than new.
She has a double-core nuclear reactor.
She's one of a kind now.
She always was.
How do you like your ride, Becket boy?
Solid iron hull, no alloys.
Forty engine blocks per muscle strand.
Hyper-torque driver for every limb and a new fluid...
...synapse system.
Come here.
Tendo. It's good to see you, buddy.
It's good to see you too, brother.
It's just like old times.
So, what's your story?
Restoring old Jaegers, showing has-beens like me around.
That can't be it.
You a pilot?
No. Not yet.
But I wanna be one...
...more than anything.
What's your simulator score?
Fifty-one drops, 51 kills.
Wow, that's amazing.
But you're not one of the candidates tomorrow?
I am not.
The marshal has his reasons.
Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?
But with 51 kills,
I can't imagine what they could be.
I hope you approve of my choices.
I've studied your fighting techniques and strategy.
Even Alaska.
And what do you think?
I think you're unpredictable.
You have a habit of deviating from standard combat techniques.
You take risks that endanger yourself and your crew.
I don't think you're the right man for this mission.
Wow.
Thank you for your honesty.
You might be right.
But one day, when you're a pilot, you're gonna see that in combat...
...you make decisions.
And you have to live with the consequences.
That's what I'm trying to do.
The candidates are ready.
We will commence the trials immediately, sir.
- Good.
- But there is one thing.
Mako, we have talked about this.
We will not be talking about it again.
You promised me.
Mako.
Vengeance is like an open wound.
You cannot take that level of emotion into the Drift.
For my family, I need...
Raleigh.
Come sit with us.
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.
Ah, come on, there's plenty of room at our table.
I haven't seen bread in a while.
Hong Kong.
Beauty of an open port, no rationing.
We've got potatoes, peas, sweet beans, decent meat loaf.
Pass the potatoes.
Raleigh, this is my son...
...Chuck. He's my copilot now.
He's more my copilot.
Right, Dad?
So you're the guy, eh?
You're the guy who's gonna run defense for me...
- ...in that old rust bucket of yours?
- That's the plan.
Good.
So when was the last time you jockeyed, Ray?
About five years ago.
What have you been doing for five years?
Something pretty important, I reckon.
I was in construction.
Oh, wow, that's great.
I mean, that's really useful.
We get into a fight, you can build our way out of it, eh, Ray?
It's Raleigh.
Whatever.
Look, you're Pentecost's bright idea.
And my old man, he seems to like you.
But it's guys like you who brought down the Jaeger program. To me...
...you're dead weight.
You slow me down...
...I'm gonna drop you like a sack of Kaiju shit.
I'll see you around, Raleigh.
Come on, Max.
You can blame me for that one.
I've raised him on my own.
He's a smart kid, but I never knew whether to give him a hug...
...or a kick in the ass.
With respect, sir...
...I'm pretty sure which one he needs.
Four points to 0.
Four points to 1.
Four points...
...to 2.
Okay, what?
You don't like them?
I thought you selected them...
...personally.
Excuse me?
Every time a match ends you make this little gesture...
...like you're critical of their performance.
It's not their performance, it's yours. Your gambit.
You could have taken...
...all of them two moves earlier.
You think so?
I know so.
Can we change this up?
How about we give...
...her a shot.
No. We stick to the cadet list we have, ranger.
Only candidates with Drift compatibility...
Which I have, marshal.
Mako, this is not only about a neural connection.
It's also about a physical compatibility.
What's the matter, marshal?
Don't think your brightest can cut it in the ring with me?
Go.
Four strikes marks a win.
Remember, it's about compatibility.
It's a dialogue, not a fight.
But I'm not gonna dial down my moves.
Okay.
Then neither will I.
One-zero.
One-one.
Two-one. Concentrate.
Two-two.
Better watch it.
Oh.
Three-two.
Enough.
I've seen what I need to see.
Me too.
She's my copilot.
That's not going to work.
Why not?
Because I said so, Mr. Becket.
I made my decision. Report to...
...the Shatterdome in two hours and find out who your copilot will be.
Mako.
What was all that about?
I mean...
...I'm not crazy. You felt it, right?
We are Drift compatible.
Thank you for standing up for me.
But there is nothing to talk about.
That's my room.
Excuse me.
I mean, come on.
I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
Mako...
...this is worth fighting for.
We don't have to just obey him.
It's not obedience, Mr. Becket.
It's respect.
Would you at least tell me...
...what his problem is?
In the wake...
...of the Sydney incident which showed the ineffective nature...
...of the Wall of Life program, many are questioning...
...the government's motives and wondering why...
...the Jaeger program has been discontinued.
Riots have erupted along the coastlines of several...
...Pan Pacific...
...cities.
We have now relocated millions of civilians and supplies...
...300 miles inland to the safe zones.
Safe zones? For the rich and powerful?
What about the rest of us?
Yeah, answer the question.
I believe the Wall of Life is still our best option at this time.
And that's all I'm gonna say on the matter. Thank you.
Kaiju/Human...
...Drift experiment, take one.
The, uh...
The brain segment is the frontal lobe.
Um, chances are...
...the segment's far too damaged to Drift with.
Unscientific aside:
Hermann, if you're listening to this...
...well, I'm either alive and
I've proven what I've just done works...
...in which case, ha, ha, I won...
...or I'm dead and I'd like you to know that it's all your fault.
It really is. You know, you drove me to this.
In which case...
...ha, I also won.
Sort of.
I'm going in in three...
...two...
...one.
Newton. Newton!
What have you done?
Gipsy Danger neural test commencing...
...in 20 minutes.
Gipsy Danger...
...neural test commencing...
...in 20 minutes.
Gipsy Danger neural test...
May I come in, Mako?
A long time ago...
...I made you a promise.
These transmitters are non-operative.
I need them replaced.
Setting harness for test mode.
Waiting for second pilot.
Two pilots on board.
I'm gonna take this side if you don't mind. My left arm's kind of shot.
Sure.
Are you gonna say anything?
No point. In five minutes you're gonna be...
...inside my head.
You look good.
Pilots on board and ready to connect.
- Prepare for neural handshake.
- Initiating...
...neural handshake.
Okay. We're not in the simulator now, Mako.
Remember, don't chase the rabbit.
Random Access Brain Impulse
Triggers. Memories.
Just let them flow, don't latch on.
Tune them out. Stay in the Drift.
The Drift is silence.
Neural interface Drift initiated.
Raleigh!
Mama!
Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!
Right hemisphere calibrated.
Left hemisphere calibrated.
Ready to activate...
...the Jaeger.
Okay, Gipsy. Lining up nicely.
Better get ready.
Pilot to Jaeger connection complete.
Marshal! Marshal!
I need to talk to you.
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.
I'm sure you can appreciate how important this moment is to me.
Newton created a neural bridge from garbage and Drifted with a Kaiju.
I found him prone...
...and he's sort of dazed.
I don't exactly know what to do.
I told you it would work.
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?
It was only a fragment of a brain, so really all I was able to get was, like...
...a series of, uh, images...
...or impressions.
Like when you blink your eyes over and over and over again all you really see...
...are, like, frames. It was emotion.
Newton, Newton.
Okay, Newton. Newton, look at me.
Now I want you to take your time and be very specific.
Okay. Okay.
Well, I don't feel like they're just following some sort of animalistic urge...
...you know, just hunting and gathering.
And I think they're attacking us under orders.
That's impossible.
- Is that impossible?
- It's impossible.
Why don't you...
...Drift with a Kaiju?
You! Shut up!
You, keep talking.
These beings, these masters, they're colonists.
They overtake worlds.
They just consume them...
...and then they move on to the next.
And they've been here before in sort of a trial run.
It was the dinosaurs.
But the atmosphere wasn't conducive, right?
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.
And now with ozone depletion, and carbon monoxide, polluted waters...
...well, we've practically terraformed it for them.
Because now they're coming back, and it's perfect.
See, the first wave, that was just the hounds.
Categories 1 through 4, it was nothing.
Their sole purpose was to aim for the populated areas...
...and to take out the vermin: Us!
The second wave, that is the exterminators.
And they will finish the job. And then...
...the new tenants...
...will take possession.
See, the reason that I found the identical
DNA in the two separate Kaiju organs...
...is because they are grown!
Newton, I need you to do it again.
I need more information.
I can't do it again.
I mean, not unless you have a fresh Kaiju brain...
...lying around.
Do you?
Pretty impressive.
Yeah, he remembers how to turn it on.
Oi, show some respect.
When his brother died, he got the Jaeger back to shore on his own.
I've known one other pilot that's been able to do that.
Now, there are certain individuals whose business is the preservation...
...and exploitation of Kaiju remains.
Uh, yeah, right, um, black market dealers, right?
Yep. They're in and out in a matter of hours.
They neutralize the acidic factor of the blood...
...and they harvest what they need.
Now, this guy, this is Hannibal Chau.
He runs the Kaiju black market...
...here in Asia.
When our funding ran out...
...we turned to him for help and in return...
...I gave him exclusive rights to all Kaiju remains in the region.
You did that?
Last days of war, gentlemen.
Go to the corner of Fong...
...and Tull. Show them that card.
Look for that symbol.
And a word to the wise, do not trust him.
Calibration...
...complete.
The hull! It went through the hull!
Raleigh, listen to me! You need...
Pilot...
...out of alignment.
- Both out of alignment.
- Both of them?
Both of them.
Gipsy, Gipsy! You're out of alignment!
- You are both out of alignment.
- I'm okay. Just let me control it.
- Out of alignment. Code red.
- You're stabilizing. But Mako is way out.
She's starting to chase the rabbit!
Mako, don't get stuck in a memory.
Stay with me. Stay in the now.
Don't engage in a memory.
Mako.
Mako! Listen to me.
Mako?
Mama!
Mama!
Mako.
This is just a memory.
None of this is real.
Weapons system engaged.
Plasma cannon powering up.
Oh, no.
Weapon system engaged!
Go to fail-safe!
Fail-safe not responding. There's a problem with the neural blocker!
Her connection's way too strong!
- Fully charged.
- Mako!
Mako, listen to me. This is just a memory. None of it is real.
The power line! The power line!
Get the main power line!
Take them offline!
Take them offline!
I just did.
Weapon system disengaged.
Mako!
Neural bridge exercise...
...in valid.
It's okay. It's okay.
Drift sequence terminated.
Would you like...
...to try again?
Hmm...
Hello.
Pss, pss.
You looking for some Kaiju...
- ...bone powder?
- Some...? Some bone...?
Some bone powder?
Uh, no, why would I want that?
Male potency.
I take it myself.
I see. Uh, no, thank you.
I'm looking...
...for Hannibal Chau.
Come.
You want Chau, huh?
Good luck.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, this place is heaven!
That's a lymph gland from a Category 2!
And what are you working on here?
Is this a cuticle? In mint condition?
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?
I've never seen them alive before!
They usually die as soon as the Kaiju falls!
- I thought you couldn't keep them alive!
- You can if you soak them in ammonia.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
I was told...
...he was here.
Who wants to know?
I really can't say.
Stacker Pentecost sent me!
Oh, that's great. That's real great.
So I take it you're Hannibal Chau, right?
You like the name? I took it...
...from my favorite historical character...
...and my second-favorite
Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn.
Now tell me what you want...
...before I gut you like a pig and feed you to the skin louse.
She can't control...
- ...her Drift, and he went out of phase first!
- We all know what happened.
We can't afford mistakes. The Kaiju keep evolving, they keep kicking our asses!
He's a has-been, she's a rookie.
I don't want them protecting my bomb run, sir.
You need to watch your tone, Mr. Hansen.
Hey, stay there.
Give me a moment.
You two are a goddamn disgrace.
You're gonna get us all killed, and here's the thing, Raleigh:
I want to come back from this mission...
...because I quite like my life.
So why don't you just do us all a favor and disappear?
It's the only thing you're good at.
Stop! Now!
Yeah, that's right.
You just hold back your little girlfriend.
One of you bitches needs a leash.
Apologize to her.
Screw you.
I said apologize to her.
Hey, hey! Enough!
What's going on?
On your feet, both of you!
Becket...
- ...Mori, into my office.
- No, we aren't finished!
This is over!
You're a ranger, for chrissake.
Why don't you start acting...
...like one?
I went out of phase first.
- It was my mistake.
- No.
It was my mistake.
I should have never let you two in the same machine.
So, what...
...you're grounding us?
Not you.
Permission to be dismissed, sir.
Permission granted, Miss Mori.
Mako.
Sir, what are you doing?
She is the strongest candidate by far.
What other options do we have?
Huh? Tell me!
Do not let my calm demeanor fool you...
...ranger!
Now is not a good moment...
...for your insubordination!
Mako is too inexperienced to rein in her memories during combat.
That's not why...
...you grounded her.
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.
I don't care what you think you saw.
I know what she means to you. I saw it!
Hey! Hey!
This conversation is over.
Marshal. Marshal, can we just talk about this...
...for one second?
You rescued her.
You raised her.
You're not protecting her now.
You are holding her back.
One:
Don't you ever touch me again.
Two:
Don't you ever touch me again.
Now, you have no idea who the hell
I am or where I've come from...
...and I'm not about to tell you my whole life story.
All I need to be to you and everybody on this dome...
...is a fixed point.
The last man standing.
I do not need your sympathy or your admiration.
All I need is your compliance and your fighting skills.
And if I can't get that...
...then you can go back to the wall that I found you crawling on.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
I'm sorry.
I should've warned you.
First Drifts are rough.
But you weren't just tapping into my memories...
...you were tapping into my brother's...
...too.
When Yancy was taken, we were still connected.
I felt his fear, his pain, his helplessness...
...and then...
...he was gone.
I felt it. I know.
You know, you live in someone else's head for so long...
...the hardest part to deal with is the silence.
To let someone else in, to really connect...
...you have to trust them.
And today the Drift was strong.
Her heart.
When's the last time you saw it?
Not in a long time.
Movement in the Breach.
Double event.
Two signatures.
Dilation indicator, Category 4.
- Excuse me.
- Breach was exposed...
...at 2300 hours.
We have two signatures...
...both Category 4s.
Code names: Otachi and Leatherback.
They'll reach Hong Kong within the hour.
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.
I want every single civilian in a refuge right now.
Crimson Typhoon...
Chemo Alpha...
...I want you to frontline the harbor.
Stay on the miracle mile.
Striker, I want you to stay back, look after the coastline.
We cannot afford to lose you, so only engage as a final option.
Yes, sir!
You two.
You stay put.
Let's go!
Loccent, Striker's got the ball...
...and we're on the roll.
Loccent...
...near positions...
...and awaiting your orders.
Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.
Guys, keep your eyes open.
These Category 4s are the biggest we've ever seen, both in size and weight.
Cherno Alpha reaching target zone.
Disengaging transport.
Cherno Alpha in position. Miracle mile.
Chemo Alpha holding the coastline.
Beacon is on.
Look at them.
They believe the Kaiju were sent from heaven.
That the gods are expressing their displeasure with our behavior.
The silly bastards.
And what do you believe?
Well...
...I believe that Kaiju bone powder is 500 bucks a pound.
- What do you want?
- I need to access...
...a Kaiju brain. Completely intact.
No, no. The skull plate is so dense that by the time you drill into it...
The brain's rotted away.
But I'm talking...
...about the secondary brain.
Now we both know that the Kaiju are so large...
...they need two brains to move around, like a dinosaur.
I want to get my hands on that.
Mm. What the hell do you want a secondary brain for, anyway?
I mean, every part of the Kaiju sells.
Cartilage, spleen, liver.
Even the crap!
One cubic meter of crap has enough phosphorous in it...
...to fertilize a whole field!
But the brain...
Too much ammonia.
So, what's the deal, little fella?
Well, that's classified.
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.
- Mm.
- But it is pretty cool.
Sol might tell you.
I'm gonna tell you.
I figured out how to Drift with a Kaiju.
Are you funning me, son?
It's fascinating how their minds work.
Every single Kaiju...
...his mind's connected.
The species has, like...
Like a hive mind.
Holy jeez.
You've gone and done it, haven't you?
I did it a little bit, yeah.
You goddamn moron.
Loccent! Typhoon...
...and Alpha are in trouble.
We're moving in!
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.
We need you to carry that bomb.
Do you copy?
Jesus, we can't just sit here...
...and watch them die. Come on!
Screw this.
Loccent, we're moving in...
...now!
Chemo Alpha, we've been hit with some type of acid!
- Come on!
- Hull has been compromised.
We need backup immediately!
Just hold on, Chemo!
We're on our way!
Our power move! Yeah!
We just lost Chemo, sir.
Engaging...
...air missiles!
What's going on? What happened?
The blast. It jumbled all the Jaegers' electrical circuits.
What the hell was that?
I've never seen that before.
- Loccent!
- They're adapting.
This isn't a defense mechanism, it's a weapon!
Get me Striker.
Nothing, sir. The Mark 5's digital's fried.
It'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary.
All the Jaegers, they're digital!
Not all of them, marshal.
Gipsy's analog. Nuclear.
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out. This way.
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
What's going on?
There are two goddamn Kaiju headed straight for Hong Kong City.
No, that's not possible.
There's never been two before.
Well, maybe that's because nobody ever
Drifted with one before, eh? Genius!
When Jaeger pilots Drift, it's a two-way street.
A bridge, right?
It sets up a connection.
Both ways!
"A hive mentality," you said!
Maybe those Kaiju are trying to find you.
What're we gonna do?
I'm gonna wait out this shitstorm in my own private Kaiju bunker.
But you are going to a public refuge.
I tried it once.
Once.
Now get the hell out of here.
Move! Move! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!
Okay, hold on. Let me in.
Okay, I'm a doctor. Okay, let me in,
I'm a doctor.
- There's no emergency power.
- We gotta bail.
- I'm gonna try something else.
- No!
Don't disengage!
My arm!
Come on! Get on your feet, old man!
Don't call me that!
He's right outside.
We gotta get out of here now!
We're not going anywhere!
Now you and I are the only thing standing between that ugly bastard...
...and a city of 10 million people.
Now we have a choice here.
We either sit and wait...
...or we take these flare guns and do something really stupid.
- How's your arm?
- Ah, just give me the gun.
Hey, you!
I think we just pissed it off!
All right, Mako.
Get ready, this is for real!
- Yeah!
- Come on, Gipsy!
Kick his ass!
Come on!
Let's do this! Together!
Elbow rocket!
Elbow rocket...
...engaged.
Now!
Hang on, Mako!
Plasma cannon, now!
Plasma cannon engaged.
Empty the clip!
Empty the clip!
Wait.
I think this guy's dead.
But let's check for a pulse.
Okay.
No pulse.
He stopped right above us.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. This isn't a refuge.
This is a buffet line!
He knows I'm here.
- He knows I'm here!
- Shh. He knows we're all here.
No, you don't understand, he's trying to get me! He knows I'm here!
What was she saying?
I gotta get out of here!
Let me out of here!
Oh, come on!
Those were expensive glasses.
This is the worst.
Torque...
...engaged.
I can't pinpoint it.
It's moving quick. Keep your eyes open.
Choppers, do you have a visual? Over.
Come on!
I'll hold it!
- Vent the coolant on the left flank!
- Coolant venting.
Venting coolant.
Atmosphere loss in progress.
Temperature's dropping!
We're losing oxygen!
Both plasma...
...cannons are shot.
We're out of options, Mako.
Sword deployment.
Altitude actuation off-balance.
50,000 feet to ground contact.
Look, there!
Altitude loss...
...critical.
40,000 feet.
Gipsy, listen to me!
Loosen all the shock absorbers, use your gyroscope...
...as balance and ball up!
It's your only chance!
20,000...
...feet.
Fuel purge!
Now!
Impact alert.
We're coming in too fast.
We're coming in too fast!
Brace for it, Mako!
Mako, talk to me.
Mako, you okay?
Yeah.
You?
- Go to Dr. Geiszler now!
- Yes, sir!
I want the two remaining Jaegers back to 100 percent functionality.
Yes, sir!
We're gonna harvest...
...the skin, the talons and the wing.
Germans are gonna go nuts for that stuff.
Let me see that map.
Here is where the Kaiju fell, here's where we concentrate our efforts.
- We'll get it, boss.
- Right.
Hey!
Okay.
Guess who's back, you one-eyed bitch?
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.
Raleigh!
My kid'd never admit it...
...but he's grateful.
We both are.
Mr. Becket!
Miss Mori!
In all of my years fighting...
...I've never...
...seen anything like that.
Well done.
Proud of you.
Proud of us all.
But...
...as harsh as it sounds...
...there is no time to celebrate.
We lost two crews.
No time to grieve.
Reset that clock.
Reset the clock.
I still can't believe what you did to me. I mean, I could have been eaten.
Well, that was definitely the plan.
Lucky for you, that didn't become necessary, huh?
Thank you so much, you're so kind.
I really appreciate all of this.
But now do you mind telling me exactly what is taking so long...
...for your workers to get that brain?
Well, they pump the cavity full of CO2...
...just like in any other laparoscopic surgery.
Okay, yes, obviously.
The CO2's gonna delay the acidic reaction, yes.
And it allows us to harvest.
But our boys need oxygen pumped into their suits.
They move slow.
What's going on in there, boys?
We've reach...
...the upper pelvic area. Unh.
Moving to the 25th vertebra.
Shit.
Even through the suit, boss, it smells like dead catfish in here.
Boss.
The secondary brain...
- ...is damage.
- Aw.
- It's ruin.
- Bitch!
How could they screw that up?
Wait. Wait.
What was that?
Did he say "wait"? Why wait?
Do you hear that?
It's like a heartbeat.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this can't be.
Hold on a second.
Hey! Let me have that!
Shh, shh! Listen, listen!
Listen to this.
It's pregnant.
No, no! Please.
- I knew it.
- Unh.
Gone.
His lungs weren't fully formed.
Umbilical cord tied around his neck.
No way he could survive outside the womb for more than a minute.
One look, that's all I needed.
I knew he wouldn't make it.
Ugly little bastard.
Anyway, I would...
How sick are you?
And why didn't you tell me?
Uh...
What's to tell?
You know, them Mark 1s, we scraped them bad boys together in 14 months.
Last thing we were thinking about was radiation shielding.
I ran nearly a dozen missions.
I stayed under the medical radar for a while...
...but the last time I jockeyed was in Tokyo.
I finished the fight solo...
...but for three hours...
...I burned.
They warned me if I ever stepped foot...
...into a Jaeger again, the toll would be too much.
You and I are the only two that ever ran solo combat.
That's why I brought you here.
- What is it?
- Sir, it's happening.
I just got two signatures with unprecedented dilation, 40-meter spikes.
What category?
Checking the ratios, Category 4.
Where're they headed?
That's the thing, they're not heading anywhere. They're hovering...
...just above the Breach.
It's like they're protecting it...
- ...or something.
- All right, Gipsy, Striker on deck.
Sir, Herc cannot ride. His arm...
You heard me.
Two signatures. Two?
There are two Kaiju signatures in the Breach, not three like I predicted!
Hermann! I haven't exactly had a very good day, okay?
I got about 5 minutes...
Should be three Kaijus.
...before brain death occurs here!
I don't wanna spend it talking...
- ...about your theories!
- This is all wrong!
There should be three Kaijus coming through, not two!
There should be three and there's two?
I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong.
I am not wrong, but there is something here we don't understand.
Hopefully we can argue about any mistakes you made...
...in your predictive model in the future!
But in the meantime, the neural interface...
...is way off the charts!
If you want to help, help with that!
Newton, I am not wrong.
There is only one way to make sure...
...and that is to do this...
...together.
I'll go with you.
That's what the Jaeger pilots do, share the neural load.
You're serious?
You would do that for me?
Or you would do that with me?
Well, with worldwide destruction a certain alternative...
...do I really have a choice?
Then say it with me, my man:
"We're gonna own...
...this bad boy!"
By Jove, we are going to own this thing for sure!
Oi, Tendo. Tendo!
You're not suited up.
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.
I need to know what's going on.
He said suit up, so suit up.
Tendo, I can't pilot Striker on my own, now, can I?
Dad's hurt, so who's gonna be my copilot?
I don't remember it being so tight.
Getting back into that Jaeger will kill you.
Not getting into one would kill us all.
Listen...
...you are a brave girl.
I'm so lucky to have seen you grow.
But if I'm going to do this...
...I need you to protect me.
Can you do that?
Right.
Everyone...
...listen up!
Today...
...today...
...at the edge of our hope...
...at the end of our time...
...we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves, but in each other.
Today there's not...
...a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone.
Not today.
Today we face the monsters that are at our door...
...and bring the fight to them!
Today we are canceling the apocalypse!
Hey, marshal!
You know, that was a great speech...
...but how exactly are you and I supposed to match up...
...in there?
I carry nothing into the Drift.
No memories, no fear.
No rank.
And as for you...
...well, you're easy.
You're an egotistical jerk...
...with daddy issues.
A simple puzzle I solved on day one.
But you are your father's son...
...so we'll Drift just fine.
Works for me.
Hey, now.
When you Drift with someone...
you feel like there's nothing to talk about.
I just don't want to regret...
- ...all the things that I never said out loud.
- Don't.
You don't need to.
I know them all.
I always have.
Hey. Hey, handsome.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.
You look after him for me.
Stacker.
That's my son you got there.
My son.
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent living in the past...
...I never really thought about the future.
Until now.
I never did have very good timing.
You ready for this?
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Initiating neural handshake in five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Are you okay?
Yes, of course.
I'm completely fine.
- The Drift. You saw it?
- Yeah.
- Did you?
- Listen, we have to warn them.
The Jaegers... The Breach... The plan...
It's not going to work.
Disengaging transport.
Loccent, all ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.
All ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.
Both neural handshakes at 100 percent.
Neural handshake confirmed, sir.
Two actives still in circle formation in the Guam quadrant.
Code names: Scunner, Raiju.
Both Category 4.
Roger that.
Half a mile to the ocean cliff...
...we jump!
It's 3000 meters to the Breach.
Half a mile? I can't even see...
...a damn inch ahead!
How are we supposed to deliver the bomb?
Visibility's zero.
Switching to instruments now.
Sir!
Gipsy, you have movement on your right.
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!
100-feet radius...
- ...clear.
- Right flank's clear.
I got nothing.
Left now! And moving fast!
Fastest Kaiju on record!
I don't see anything.
It's moving too fast!
Eyes on the prize, Gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.
400 meters and closing.
Bogeys are stopping.
Striker! Bogeys are stopping.
One o'clock.
Marshal, what are you doing?
They're stopping.
- Why the hell are they stopping?
- I don't give a damn, sir!
We're 300 meters from the jump!
- Something's not right!
- Striker...
...the bogeys aren't following.
Take the leap now.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
It's not gonna work!
Move, you fascist! Blowing up the Breach, it's not gonna work!
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?
Just because the Breach is open does not mean you're able to get a bomb through.
The Breach genetically reads the Kaiju...
...like a barcode at the supermarket and then lets them pass.
You're gonna have to fool the Breach into thinking that you have the same code!
- And how are we supposed to do that?
- By making it think...
...you are a Kaiju.
You have to lock onto the Kaiju, ride it into the Breach.
The Throat will then read...
...the Kaiju's genetic code...
- ...and let you pass.
- If you don't do it...
...the bomb will deflect off the Breach...
...like it always has...
...and the mission will fail.
All right.
Now that you've heard all that,
Striker, take the leap!
Sir! I have a third signature...
- ...emerging from the Breach!
- Third signature...
...emerging from the Breach.
It's a triple event.
Oh, God, I was right.
How big is it?
- What category?
- Category 5.
Striker...
...it's a Category 5.
The first ever.
Striker, we see him.
We're right behind you...
...about 100 meters.
We're gonna come around your 3 o'clock, try to flank him.
Standard two-team formation.
Just keep him busy for a few...
Brace for impact!
Chain sword...
...deployed.
Let's get this son of a bitch!
Gipsy, coming up...
...on your 12 o'clock!
Full speed!
Get out of the way!
The release is jammed!
We can't deliver...
...the payload, sir!
We're still armed.
But the hull is compromised!
Half our systems are offline, sir.
We need to override the...
Both Kaijus...
...converging on Striker fast!
Hang on, Striker!
- We 're coming to you!
- No!
Gipsy! Do not come to our aid!
Do you copy?
- Hang on!
- Stay as far back as you can!
We can still reach you.
We're coming for you.
No, Raleigh, listen to me.
You know exactly what you have to do!
Gipsy is nuclear!
Take her to the Breach!
I hear you, sir.
Heading for the Breach.
- Structural damage...
- Now.
- ...eighty percent.
- Unh.
Mako.
Listen.
You can finish this.
I'll always be here for you.
You can always find me in the Drift.
We're a walking...
...nuclear reactor.
We can destroy the Breach.
What can we do, sir?
We can clear a path!
For the lady!
They're gonna detonate the payload.
If you have the shot, you take it!
So let's do this!
It was a pleasure, sir.
All systems critical. Fluid loss.
Systems are critical!
Fuel is leaking!
Our right leg's crippled!
Code red.
- Let's finish this.
- All systems critical.
What are they doing?
Finishing the mission.
Loccent. We have...
...the Kaiju carcass.
We're heading for the Breach.
You guys better be right.
Because one way or another...
...we 're getting this thing done.
On my count, rear jets!
Three...
...two...
...one.
Now!
Hold on.
Mako's oxygen is down. Half capacity!
- Can you reroute it?
- I'm trying, sir.
Hold on, Mako.
- Heat shaft purge.
- I'm gonna burn...
...this son of a bitch.
They're in.
- They're in!
- It worked.
Oxygen main...
...left hemisphere, critical levels.
Operating at...
...fifteen percent capacity.
Ten percent capacity.
Five percent.
He's giving her his oxygen.
It's okay now, Mako.
We did it.
I can finish this alone.
All I have to do is fall.
Anyone can fall.
Raleigh...
...your oxygen levels...
...are critical now.
You don't have much time.
Start the core meltdown and get out of there. Do you hear me?
Get out of there now!
One pod is ejected. No detonation, sir.
Loccent, if you can still hear me...
...I'm initiating...
...reactor override now.
Manual activation...
...required.
What's going on?
Trigger's offline!
He has to do it by hand.
He's out of time.
He has to self-destruct now.
Manual activation required.
No!
Manual override initiated.
Core meltdown in T-minus 60.
Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.
Fifty seconds.
Evac pod engaged.
Five...
...four, three...
...two, one.
Reactor meltdown.
Direct hit! The Breach has collapsed!
To the choppers! To the choppers now!
Visuals on first pod.
Tracking solid. Vital signs are good.
Okay, where's the second pod?
I'm tracking it, but I'm getting no vital signs.
I can't find his pulse.
I don't think he's breathing.
Can you read his pulse?
Does he have a pulse?
Raleigh?
Mako, listen to me.
It could be the sensors are networking.
We can't be sure.
No.
No. Don't go.
- Please.
- Mako.
Don't go.
Mako.
No.
Don't go. Please.
You're squeezing me too tight.
I couldn't breathe.
This is Marshal Hercules Hansen.
The Breach is sealed.
Stop the clock!
Mako, Raleigh.
We have your position.
The choppers are on their way.
Just hang on.
Are you okay?
Do you copy?
Uh, guys?
Where is my goddamn shoe?
The Earth is at peace.
There is no hunger.
There is no violence.
The environment is healed.
Honesty, courtesy and kindness are practiced by all.
Our world has never been more
perfect.
Only it is no longer our world.
We've been invaded
by an alien race.
They occupy the bodies
of almost all human beings on the planet.
The few humans who have survived
are on the run.
Please.
Come with us.
We only want to help you.
Please be careful.
Please don't hurt yourself.
We don't want to hurt you.
Like hell!
No!
No!
Barely a bone not broken or organ ruptured.
I cannot tell you why she is not dead.
This one wants to live.
Welcome.
I am Healer Fords.
What shall I call you?
You have lived many lives on many worlds.
A wanderer such as yourself, there must have been a name.
Call me
Wanderer.
When will she be able to work?
Not now.
Of course, Healer.
No.
No.
No.
I didn't die.
I didn't die.
That's right.
I'm still here.
Don't think this is yours.
This body is mine.
No, mine.
I don't know how much you know about this new world.
Almost every human has been successfully occupied.
As with the other planets you've inhabited, we do not change this world.
But experience it.
And perfect it.
What did you think?
Did you think I'd just give up?
However, there are still pockets of human resistance that threaten our peace.
Your host was part of that resistance.
You want me to locate her memories.
Yes. From those memories, we can locate other rebels.
Good luck With that.
But I must warn you.
Most humans fade away, but a rare few fight their occupation.
Her name is Melanie Stryder.
She was born in Louisiana.
Her family escaped the initial waves of colonization.
But it was only a matter of time.
Her father was discovered alone.
He took his life rather than be taken by our Seekers and risk the lives of his children.
Melanie has been on the run ever since with...
No! Don't say it!
Don't you say it!
Please.
I beg you.
Is she resisting?
Jamie.
His name is Jamie Stryder.
I hate you.
If only I could hurt you.
I understand why you are resistant.
You believe that the loss of your will is too great a sacrifice.
But we have to think of the common good.
Call it whatever you want.
This is murder.
One sound and you die.
Do it. I'd rather die.
That's impossible.
You're human.
Come back!
Stop!
Stop!
Wait!
Look! Look! Look at me!
I'm human.
Just like you.
Get off me.
I'm sorry.
My name is Jared Howe.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I haven't spoken to another human being in two years.
I'm guessing you haven't been kissed in a while either.
Melanie Stryder.
I've got someone waiting for me.
You're not alone?
It's my kid brother.
He's hungry. I ran two hours to get to this house.
I can give you a ride.
Hey, it's faster than running.
It's even faster than your running.
Are you gonna pretend like you didn't feel something just now?
I know you felt that.
Stop that!
Stop!
What you're doing is wrong.
And you know it.
After meeting Jared Howe,
Melanie and her brother stayed with him.
They settled in an abandoned place
yet to be explored by our souls.
Left, right.
They could almost forget the invasion happening around them.
You haven't kissed me since that first night.
Melanie, you don't have to.
We could be the last ones.
And even if we are, the last man and woman left on Earth, you still don't have to.
I want to.
When you touch me, it's...
I don't want you to stop.
You should sleep.
Then sleep with me.
All I'm saying is we have time.
You don't know that.
You don't know if we've got months or days.
We could be taken at any moment.
We only have this, now.
Wanderer? Wanderer?
Wanderer!
Yes, Seeker.
You have not spoken for several minutes.
They were lovers?
These humans are not like the other bodies you have inhabited.
They have unusually strong physical drives.
You have to be vigilant.
Yes.
They saw Seekers nearby.
They were not found, but knew they had to move on.
They were headed...
I can't see where.
A safe place with others.
Hope...
Before the long journey, they spent the night in an old hotel they thought was safe.
Jared was out searching for supplies for the trip.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Stay here. Don't move.
I want to go with you.
I'll lead them away and come right back.
I promise. Come on.
No!
Now you know.
I will do anything.
Go on.
There's nothing more now.
There has to be more.
I will keep trying.
Please do, Wanderer.
No! No, no! Wait! Stop!
You were not meant to see that.
You can't know that!
That could kill them!
Get rid of it. Get rid of it!
Now! Please!
You were not meant to see that.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Wanderer, please.
After everything you've seen,
how can you still help them?
Surprise, surprise.
Look who's here.
What a pleasant surprise, Seeker.
Did you follow me?
Only in case you needed me.
Yeah. Right.
She is so full of it.
What are you doing here?
I thought a change of scenery might help.
Change.
Wasn't your last planet completely covered by water?
It's been a week since you've had new information.
Do you know where they are?
If you can't say no, say nothing.
Walk away.
Do you pity them?
The humans?
Don't you?
In your other lives, have you ever felt anything like this?
They were brutal.
Killing each other.
Killing their planet.
They're lucky they survived as long as they did.
I do have some good news.
Your identification of Jared Howe has helped.
There was a sighting. I am confident we will find him.
- No!
- No!
Ah!
Seeker, I am so sorry.
I don't know what I was doing.
Perhaps because you weren't doing it.
We have put you through enough.
Your host appears too resistant.
You are going to be re-implanted into a more compliant host.
Is he saying what I think he's saying?
What will happen to this body?
It is time for someone else to search her memories.
Her?
You?
Yes.
My body can be held for me.
I will return to it when we have the information we need.
Then what will happen to Melanie Stryder?
She will have the death she originally desired.
Unlike the way humans kill, it will be done humanely.
Stop her! Do something!
My Healer has agreed to this?
No. He transferred to Fort Worth.
Don't feel bad.
You are not the only one.
There are others who have not had the strength of will.
When? We make the transfer tomorrow.
We will stay outside your door tonight so no harm will come to you.
Or to others.
Please. I don't care if I die.
I can't have her inside me.
Melanie, I have to do my duty.
You have to do what's right.
She'll kill my family.
Jamie, Jared, she'll kill them.
Wanderer, please.
Your Healer.
Do you think he would help?
I think so. But I don't know how to reach him.
We need to find him.
We have to get out of here.
We?
Yes!
Put the chair against the door.
No. The other way.
How does this help?
There's no way out.
Yes, there is. That way.
Do it, Wanderer. Move.
Open it.
Come on.
You can do this.
It's not so high.
This is nothing.
It's gonna be okay.
Climb up.
Now jump.
I can't.
It's a good thing I can.
Swim!
Wanderer?
Are you all right?
You could have killed us.
Run!
Step aside.
Wanderer?
I'm sorry.
We need to steal a car.
Don't worry.
I've done it before.
Let me handle this.
You?
What are you doing? Wait!
Shh! Quiet!
Do you need help?
May I borrow your vehicle?
Please. it is important.
Certainly.
Can I be of assistance?
No. Thank you.
This is an extremely reliable model.
The tank is full.
Huh!
That's a good trick.
It was no trick. We do not lie.
We trust each other.
You guys take the fun out of everything.
Where are we going?
I will take you to my
Healer in Fort Worth.
Even if your Healer agrees to keep me inside you,
I'll still be a prisoner.
You will still be alive.
So will the people you love.
That Seeker is a lot of things, but she's not a fool.
Sooner or later, she'll work out where you're going.
We need a map.
I'll show you the way.
What's wrong?
Are the memories too painful?
How do you think I feel?
I know how you feel.
That's the problem.
When you take the body, the feelings come with it.
It's a package deal.
Where are we?
You tell me. You're the one with the steering wheel.
You sent us in the wrong direction.
You have been putting thoughts in my head to distract me.
The Seeker was right. You are an unreasonable species.
I try to help you and this is how you thank me.
We are going to Fort Worth.
No!
Will it still work?
Not anymore.
Now what do we do?
We walk.
Which way?
You can go my way,
or you can go your own way and kill us both.
You planned this.
I made a promise. I promised my brother I'd come back.
How could I have been so foolish?
I can never trust you again.
How do I know I can trust you?
I'm giving you exactly what you wanted.
Taking you to my family could get them killed.
We head east.
Come on.
Don't leave tracks.
Walk on the rocks.
Did you really think you could beat me?
Save the water.
We're gonna need it.
I need it now.
We've been walking for ages.
How do you think you're going to find them?
My uncle had a cabin out here in the desert.
We were heading out here to join him.
If he survived.
It's farther than I thought.
I don't know how much farther I can go.
We've walked too far to walk back.
Melanie.
Come on, girl.
Stay with me.
Uncle Jeb.
You found us.
Us?
Jamie? Jared? Are they here?
Are they safe?
I told you I saw one.
Why did you give it water?
On account of it was dying.
Uncle Jeb!
I'm in here!
Hold it, Kyle.
Why?
She's one of them.
Well, yeah, she surely is, but she's also my niece.
Was.
I'm just saying it's complicated, Ian.
I can make it simple.
Yeah, me, too.
Aunt Maggie!
Aunt Maggie!
You don't fool us, parasite!
Oh, God. They don't see me.
They only see you.
Now, Maggie.
Don't you "Maggie" me, little brother.
It could bring a whole army down on our heads.
I don't see anyone.
I'm in here.
This is unkind, Jebediah.
Let's go.
Life is unkind, Magnolia.
Watch your head.
Where are we, Wanderer?
I reckon it's safe enough now.
So many humans alive.
We haven't lost.
Jared!
Jared!
Jared's alive! Jared's...
Enough, Jared.
Jebediah,
I know it's hard.
But we gotta do what's best for everyone.
She's gotta go to Doc's place.
Just like the rest.
Ain't that right, Doc?
No!
Jamie!
I don't see any tracks.
She didn't fly away.
This Wanderer is living up to her name.
We find her, we find the resistance.
Melanie?
Wanderer?
They don't know a human can stay alive in a body.
You can't tell them
I'm in here.
They won't believe you.
They'll think you're lying to save yourself.
Oh, God.
They're gonna kill us.
I'm sorry.
Move aside, Jared.
Get out of the way.
We can't keep her prisoner forever.
It's gonna escape and lead them to us.
I don't want to hurt you, Jared.
But I Will.
No!
I am what you want!
Stay back!
I am what you want!
Ian! Get it!
Leave him alone!
Keep breathing! Come on, Wanderer!
Fight him! Fight!
Finish it!
Good evening, everyone.
I hate to remind you, but this is my place, and you are my guests.
For the moment, she is, too.
I don't take kindly to my guests strangling each other.
Jeb, it's got to die.
We took a vote.
This ain't a democracy.
It's a dictatorship.
It's a benign dictatorship, but it's a dictatorship just the same.
You mind telling us what you plan on doing with it?
This ain't never happened before.
One of our own coming back.
For right now, this tunnel is off limits.
If I find any of you back here,
I'm asking questions second.
I'll take the next watch, Jared.
Keep it away from the kid.
I do not think we are looking for Wanderer.
I think we are looking for a body.
Even if she were not hurt in the wreck, how long could she survive in this place?
From my experience, this host has difficulty dying.
There's too much land for us to cover.
I am requesting more Seekers, ground and air patrols.
Are they really such a threat?
We outnumber them a million to one.
He's still pissed you hit him.
I told him you were sorry.
I'm not.
I know.
No one's ever sorry for hitting my brother.
It looks like they're calling off the search.
Not that one.
Jamie!
Little brother.
Do you know who I am?
You are Jamie.
But you're not Melanie.
I want to know what happened to my sister that night.
She said that she was gonna come back.
If he can't know I'm alive,
he deserves to know what happened to me.
I'm not a kid.
Please.
To protect you and Jared, she tried to take her life.
Our healers mended her and put me in her hoping I could find out if there were other human survivors.
Do you have a name?
They call me Wanderer.
Where do you come from?
Another planet.
What the hell?
Damn it, Jeb, I told you.
To keep her away from the kid.
You never said nothing about keeping the kid away from her.
Jamie, that is not Melanie!
She's never coming back.
It's still her body that we've hurt.
Get out of here now, Jamie, or so help me, I'll...
Jared.
I'll look after Jamie.
We'll watch it.
I don't trust it.
Could be another Seeker.
She...
It is the furthest thing from a Seeker I've ever seen.
I mean, she jumped between you and Kyle.
They don't do that.
It was trying to find a way to stay alive and escape.
What, by giving Kyle the go-ahead to kill her? It?
That's a good plan.
What the hell has gotten into everybody?
It is the enemy.
Don't forget it.
You don't feel bad at all.
I mean, I half killed her.
It doesn't matter.
It's not human.
So we stop acting human?
This is a big planet.
Yes.
There has been a sighting of humans in your area.
We are commencing a full-scale search immediately.
Something, ain't it?
Found this place by accident.
Really, it found me.
I fell through the roof.
Almost died trying to find a way out of these caves.
There's only one.
No one's found it on their own since I did.
Kept the place to myself.
Good thing, too. Without this, we're all dead. Right?
Wanderer?
Sound travels in these caves.
Your name is a mouthful.
You mind if I shorten it?
Life's short.
Especially right now.
Mind if I call you...
Wanda?
We get our power from the sun, Earth.
Any place we can.
It's actually an extinct volcano not quite extinct.
Watch yourself.
Fall in, you're not coming back.
Afternoon, everyone.
It's all yours.
Don't you all look pretty?
You all got your shades?
Yeah, yeah.
Make sure you wear them.
You already look like an alien.
Makes you feel like a human being again, don't it?
Bad joke?
You have the resources you wanted, Seeker.
I know you must have seen a lot, but you ain't seen nothing like this.
Nothing.
How?
Same way the magicians do it.
Mirrors.
And they all said
Jeb was crazy.
How many crazy people could pull this off?
It's almost ready to harvest.
Can't come too soon.
We sure need the grain.
Everyone here thinks you're going to betray us to the Seekers.
Makes sense.
Why else would you be here?
What I can't wrap my head around is what kind of a plan was that?
Walking into the desert with no backup and no way to get yourself back?
So if, like you say, you weren't coming here for the Seekers, why were you doing it?
Then I started thinking, when they put one of you in our heads, do we still exist?
Trapped in there?
If our memories are still alive, are we?
You gotta believe some people wouldn't go down without a fight.
Hell, I know
I wouldn't go quiet.
And I've never seen fight like in Mel.
What she'd fight for, more than anything, is the people that she loves.
I wonder if a love like that might play on someone's mind.
Heart.
It might get somebody to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do.
Maybe you're here
'cause you do actually care about Jared and the kid.
You.
Wanda.
He sees everything.
He's not crazy.
He's a genius.
I think he's both.
Yeah, I wonder a lot about a lot of things.
And I'm not the only one.
Care to join us, Jamie?
Uncle Jeb.
How did you know I was here?
Mirrors.
Mirrors! Mirrors!
Help him!
I saw something!
Now, come on!
Help!
I saw evidence of humans.
I see evidence of us.
There's nothing here.
Thank you.
They're gone.
They're gone for now.
Jared and the others are still out there.
Jamie, why don't you take over guard duty for a spell?
What do I do?
You just keep an eye on her.
You'll figure it out.
This way.
You can't give a boy a loaded gun.
That's why I didn't.
Where is he taking us?
Aren't you taking me to my cell?
I miss the outdoors.
And I was thinking that maybe you're starting to miss it, too.
Be real quiet.
Okay. Sit here.
You can open your eyes now.
What stars are these?
I've never seen this constellation.
They're not stars.
They're glowworms.
You have to be quiet or they get scared and stop shining.
When I miss the sky,
I come here.
It's beautiful.
Wanda?
I heard what
Uncle Jeb was saying.
He thinks that Melanie might still be alive.
Inside there with you, I mean.
Jamie!
Can that happen?
Does it, Wanda?
Why won't you answer me?
Is Melanie still alive?
Wanda, please.
Forget what I said.
Tell him.
She promised she would come back.
Yes.
Has Melanie ever broken a promise to you?
I love you, Mel.
She loves you, too.
She's so happy you're safe.
Is everybody like that?
Does everybody stay?
No.
Not like Melanie.
She's special.
She's very strong.
She wanted to keep her promise.
She couldn't have kept her promise if you didn't help her keep it.
Thank you, Wanda.
It's our secret.
Okay?
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you?
I think you can.
Come on, hurry.
You guys all right?
Yeah.
No racing.
Yeah, sure.
It's ready.
I figured it's time you started earning your keep.
I'll see you both in the east field.
Morning, Jamie.
Wanda.
Come on.
Wanda?
Yeah.
Wanda.
Why is he looking at you?
Why are you looking at him?
Don't forget.
He tried to kill you.
Did you hear me?
He tried to kill you.
Don't you dare smile at him.
You better take care of that.
There. That one drives faster than the limit.
Please stop your vehicle and safely exit.
Fire!
It ain't doing any good.
I don't care! Keep firing!
Don't get caught.
Take him out!
Please stop your vehicle and safely exit.
Switch off your engine and safely exit.
There are others.
I always liked science fiction stories.
Never dreamed
I'd be living in one.
How many planets have life?
Just remember, Wanda, you're not one of them.
Twelve that we know of.
Four I've never been to.
We've just opened up a new world.
You've conquered 12 planets?
That's not how we see it.
We have always lived by bonding with another species.
It is how we survive.
We try to live in harmony.
Speed up! Lose it!
No! Let him catch us.
Let's go!
We've got enough!
Let's go!
We almost had them.
Seeker.
This is not who we are.
You have killed a soul.
We have to make sacrifices.
This is a war.
This war is over.
The last of the resistance will die out on its own.
They will become extinct.
But I think there is a war raging in you, Seeker.
We're going home.
So are you.
You don't know what's going on.
We are losing control.
Wanda.
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
Over a thousand of your years.
I have not completed one full revolution of your sun, yet I have found that
Earth is more beautiful and harder than any place I have ever been.
I've gotta say, this is the most interesting conversation
- I've had in forever.
- What is this?
This has gone on long enough!
Out of the way!
- She's not a threat.
- No?
Aaron and Brandt are dead thanks to the Seeker looking for it.
Almost got us, too.
I'm gonna end this once and for all!
Jared!
You can't!
Why not?
Because if you kill Wanda...
MELANIE> Oh, no, Jamie!
...you'll kill Melanie.
She's still alive in there.
I beleve it.
You're all letting it fool you!
Come on, Jamie.
I'm so sorry.
I'll go back to my cell.
No.
This'll blow over.
You can stay in my place.
She'll be safe there.
Mmm.
You tried to kill me and now you're protecting me?
Strange world, isn't it?
The strangest.
What's wrong with you, Doc?
You want to try? You try.
Wanda?
I just want you to know that I trust you.
And I believe you're telling us the truth.
But I... I gotta ask.
What's it like for you and her, living in there together?
It's crowded.
Let me know if you need anything.
I'll just be right out here.
I think he likes you too much.
What is too much?
If I've got anything to do with it, you'll never find out.
I know it's with you.
Oh, God.
I'm not gonna kill it.
I just want to talk to it.
It's okay.
I will talk to him.
Her name is Wanda, not "it."
I'm so sorry about what happened out there, to your friends.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
Wanda,
Jamie and Jeb believe,
Ian, too, that Mel is still alive and kicking in there.
I am!
I am!
In fact, Jeb has this crazy notion that you're here for Jamie and me.
You brought Melanie back to us.
I can't believe it.
I don't want to believe it because her being in there, trapped, that makes it so much worse somehow.
But I gotta know.
Is Melanie in there?
Whatever happens, happens.
Just tell him I'm here.
Tell him I love him.
I'm afraid.
You see, the thing is, Wanda,
I haven't stopped dreaming about Melanie.
I dream about you, too.
I miss everything about her.
And I would do anything to get her back.
You know what makes this so much harder?
It's still her body.
If it wasn't for those eyes...
I got to thinking.
If I can't kiss her,
I can kiss you.
What? No!
What is he doing?
No! Stop it!
Stop! Now!
Don't do this!
No! No!
I knew it.
Mel.
You're really in there.
You hit me for kissing it.
Mel, I love you.
I know you can't say it back, but I love you.
So now he believes it, too.
It doesn't help anyone.
Knowing I'm a prisoner in here just hurts them more.
Wanda!
Hide.
Hide! Hide!
Wanda.
Wanda!
Wanda, get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Grab my hand!
What are you doing? Let go!
He'll die!
Good! If he dies, he can't kill us!
No!
Help!
Help!
You're lucky your head's harder than any rock in this place.
You'll live.
Don't be too sure about that, Doc.
What happened?
Tell him.
It was an accident.
Like hell!
I thought you didn't lie.
Kyle slipped.
Sure he did.
If that's what it says happened...
Oh, come on.
We all know what happened.
He tried to kill her.
And for some unknown reason, she saved his sorry ass.
If it's true, Kyle, you're out.
Did he try to kill you?
It's not saying he did.
You're the one who has to live under the same roof.
Kyle, I'm warning you.
Don't you even look at her wrong.
I haven't shot anyone in a long time.
Kind of miss the thrill of it.
We gotta get back to work.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Jeb.
We're going back out.
- Too many Seekers out there.
- No.
We lost a lot on that last run.
There are a couple of things that I need.
Take Kyle with you.
Come on, Kyle.
And, you, keep away from her.
You want to take a walk?
Didn't Jared tell you to stay away from me?
Yeah.
This is not a good idea.
You can open your eyes now.
I'm outside!
That really is the sky.
I like you, Wanda.
I like you, too, Ian.
You did not say that.
No.
Not like that.
Get his hands off me!
This can't work.
What are you doing?
Let me guess.
You're of two minds about it.
Is this about Jared?
Yes, it's about Jared.
Melanie is in love with him.
And you?
Tell him. Tell him!
This body loves him.
Since it is now my body, so do I.
But I also have feelings of my own.
No, you don't.
Wanda, no.
Stop!
You are not going there.
What about Jared?
This is very complicated.
Is there any way Melanie can give us some privacy?
Look the other way a moment?
Step into the other room?
You wish.
I don't think that's possible right now.
You know, it's not really me you like.
It's this body.
You couldn't care for me.
If you could hold me, me, in your hand, you'd be disgusted.
You would crush me.
You don't know that.
Wanda! No!
This is so wrong.
You're not even from the same planet!
I'll do something.
I'll hurt him!
Strange to be in a body that won't let me use it.
I think you'd better take me back.
Hallelujah!
As you say,
I'm still of two minds.
Okay.
You're angry when
I kiss a man you do love and angry when
I kiss a man you don't.
It's very confusing.
I am not weak.
I am in control.
You will never win.
Jamie.
Where is everyone?
I don't know.
Why is he lying?
He never lies.
Your leg should be better by now.
You need to see Doc.
I just came from there.
He told me to go and lay down.
I'm going to wash up.
I'll meet you in your room.
This doesn't make sense.
What is Doc thinking?
What's more important than getting Jamie better?
Hold on.
Wait.
Wanda, go back. Go back!
Wanda, don't go in there!
Turn around. Go back!
- Oh, God!
- Enough!
No!
Monsters!
Wait! Wanda!
Wanda!
Wanda! Wanda! Stop!
Get out of my head! Get out!
I'm sorry.
You know, there are easier ways to die than starving yourself to death.
Yes.
I could always visit Doc.
What did you expect, Wanda?
You expect us to just give up?
This is our world.
We haven't just lost a war.
We're dying out.
We're trying to get our people back.
What you're trying to do is impossible.
It doesn't work like that.
All you are going to do is keep murdering more of both of us.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I can't stay here.
Not with you slaughtering my family in the next room.
If you say our way won't work,
I'll tell the boys no more hostages.
It's probably for the best. I don't think Doc could take much more.
How can I trust you?
I trusted you.
There's something else.
Melanie? Are you there?
Melanie, where are you? Jamie is hurt.
I need you. Talk to me.
Melanie, please come back.
I can't do this without you.
Wanda.
I want you to know about
Doc and everything.
Don't worry about that now.
We have to get you better.
You sound like Melanie.
Did Melanie say that just then?
Yes.
Wanda.
I need you to kiss me.
What about Melanie?
Don't worry about Melanie.
No. Kiss me like you want to get slapped.
What?
Was she stopping you?
No. That's the problem.
We're alone. She's gone.
Ever since I told her to get out of my head, she's...
I'm afraid I've lost her.
She got so angry before when you kissed me.
I thought she'd come back.
Then I guess you'll have to make her really angry.
Kiss her.
I lost Melanie.
I don't know if she's still there.
You need to bring her back.
She hates me kissing you.
Okay.
Melanie, come back.
I will not lose you.
Jared.
Melanie?
Oh. Stop!
Melanie, you bit me!
Wanda, what the hell?
Melanie,
I'm so glad you're back.
Did I leave?
For three days.
You don't know what I've been through to find you.
Yeah, you look like you were suffering.
We have to help Jamie.
He's hurt.
Come on.
Stop.
Stop.
Where are you going?
It's infected. It's got into Jamie's bloodstream.
He needs medicine.
There's no medicine out there.
You souls have destroyed it all.
He doesn't need your medicine.
It's too late for that.
He needs ours.
You have to take me out of the cave.
You'll have to trust me.
Cut me. I need a wound like Jamie's.
I can't do that.
I'll be healed in minutes.
Take it from him.
Do it yourself.
They'll be suspicious of this scar.
I can cover it with a cut.
It's gonna be okay.
Excuse me.
Goodness.
We have an emergency.
You can do this, Wanda.
I'm Healer Skye.
What happened?
Tell her you tripped.
Tell her you tripped!
I tripped.
With a knife in your hand.
With a knife in my hand, cut myself.
You poor thing.
Let's fix you up.
Heal.
Seal.
Send her away.
If it is no trouble, could
I please have some water?
Of course.
Hurry! Take it!
What do you think?
Perfect.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
What are you doing?
We have to go.
Is he alive?
Barely.
What is all that?
Medicine.
Wait! No. No. We don't know what that'll do.
She knows what she's doing.
We all know what will happen if we do nothing.
He'll die.
Doc.
It's okay.
Please.
Do it.
Doc, do it.
That's it.
Come on, Jamie.
Open your eyes.
Please.
Jamie.
Hey, buddy.
You're getting good, Doc.
I've walked out of plenty of stores without paying.
First time anyone's been happy about it.
I liked it better when we were stealing.
You spoil everything, Wanda.
No, Wes!
Hello, Wanderer.
Seeker.
Why did you waste the medicine on me?
Aren't you going to kill me?
Can I speak to her alone?
Does that include me?
I guess it does.
We'll be outside, Wanda.
You just say the word.
Huh!
Wanda?
Surely, you go by "Melanie" now.
Did you ask to kill me yourself, Melanie?
What are you waiting for?
I'm not here to kill you.
Oh.
You're my interrogator.
I do want to know something.
Why?
Why couldn't you just let me go?
Because I was right.
I know the threat a weak soul like you represents.
Unlike you, I am doing my duty.
I am fighting for us.
We cannot live with them like the other worlds.
You, more than anyone, know that.
Did you come alone?
Other Seekers will come looking for me, just like I came looking for you.
No one else is coming to find you.
You die, and the danger dies with you.
The people here will be safe.
So you are going to kill me.
Wanda, what is this?
What are you thinking?
Don't put up walls against me.
Talk to me.
Wanda?
I never got the chance to say how truly...
There's a way to make up for it.
I know how to do what you have been ending so many lives trying to do.
I can take a soul from a body.
You can do what?
What are you saying, Wanda?
I will only give you this knowledge on the condition you do as I ask and promise that no harm will come to any soul.
I can promise you that.
There's one other thing you must promise.
And you must promise to keep it a secret.
You have to let me die.
No! No! No!
I can't do that, Wanda.
I... I can't.
It's the only way I can give you what you want.
Wanda.
No.
She's out.
So you don't want us to kill the Seeker.
She killed Wes.
Who knows how many others?
She wouldn't blink about butchering us.
There's been too much killing.
Not death. Exile.
You want us to forgive her.
And let them go, just like that?
Yes.
We souls can leave the same way we arrived.
I will send her away.
By the time she reaches another planet, your grandchildren will have died of old age.
You have always tried to extract it by force.
The secret is, you do not remove it, it removes itself.
You coax it out.
You have always seen it as the enemy.
It can feel the hate.
It can only be captured by kindness.
Love.
Ian, help me.
Thank you.
What is your name?
I'm Lacey.
My name is Lacey.
I've been screaming inside for years.
Nobody could hear me.
You're the reason why she wouldn't leave me alone.
Yes, she wasn't just after humans.
She was hoping to find a way to fight the hosts.
Like me.
And you, Melanie.
Who fight back.
Have a safe trip.
And along one.
Always send the souls to the most distant planets.
Wanda?
Do you miss it out there?
The other worlds?
I miss many things.
Don't you miss Melanie?
Don't you want your sister back?
She's here now.
You know he's right.
Not the way she needs to be.
I think...
I think it's time to move on.
Leave us?
Yes.
But you can always come back, right?
I asked you here so no one would shout.
I wish I could shout loud enough for them to hear.
As soon as I knew what to do with the Seeker,
I knew there was a way for all of you to get your loved ones back.
Without hurting the souls.
But, of course,
I knew I had to give
Melanie back to herself.
And leave.
That can't happen, Wanda.
We need you.
Us or you?
Tell them the truth.
You're not leaving this world.
Tell them what you're really gonna do.
Now that you have this knowledge of how to extract a soul from a body, you can survive without me.
And what does Mel say?
She's always wanted her life back.
Don't speak for me.
You're lying.
I have to go.
You don't have to decide right now.
Think about it.
Promise me you'll think about it.
You are not leaving me.
I can't stay.
But I love you.
I love you.
Don't say it like you're saying goodbye.
I love you in every way that I can.
And I'll miss you the most.
I miss the future
I might have had with you.
You're willing to sacrifice that?
Sometimes we have to make sacrifices.
No, I can't let you go. I won't.
Let me talk to Melanie.
She's not there right now.
She stepped into the other room, so I can kiss you.
I really can't talk you out of it?
No. It's time.
I want to die.
If you had lived a millennium always in the body of another, you might feel the same way yourself.
Wanda, my sister.
Yes, sister?
Please don't do this.
Don't you want to be with Jared? And Jamie?
It doesn't have to be this way.
You don't have to die.
You really could go to another world,
the way you've been telling everyone.
Thank you, but by the time I got to the closest planet, you, Jamie, Jared, Ian, everyone on this world I care about would be long dead.
I don't want to go on without you.
I love you, Mel.
I love you.
You are the purest soul, human or not, that I've ever met.
The universe will be a darker place without you.
Be happy, Mel.
Be happy that after living so many lives,
I finally found something to die for.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Wanda?
Wanda.
Wanda?
Wanda, can you hear me?
Where am I?
Who am I?
You're you.
Hello, Wanda.
Melanie?
You might want to see yourself.
You still do that with your hair.
Doc, you broke your word.
They broke it for me.
They made me keep you alive.
But I told you I didn't want to take another life in any world.
You didn't.
We've been taking souls out of humans for a month now.
But when we took the soul out of that body, she never woke up.
The body was dying.
The only way to save her was to put you inside.
You haven't killed a body.
You've given it life.
I miss you in my head.
What are you thinking, Wanda?
I'm thinking how happy I am.
It's a strange world.
The strangest.
Our world isn't like the other worlds they came to.
The way they see it,
human beings are just so alien.
But if one of them can find a way to live with one of us,
I wonder.
Seekers.
No one gets taken.
Everybody out.
Seeker, I can...
Everybody out.
Now.
Hmm.
Little bright out tonight, is it?
You're human.
Human
Mmm-hmm.
Not all human.
Are you their prisoner?
Yes.
No.
I'm not their prisoner.
I'm their friend.
They're human.
Human as you.
We thought we were the last survivors.
So did We.
Till we found three other groups.
Now four.
Thought I was the only one who switched sides.
I guess you never know where you're gonna find your home.
Mr. Faulk? James Sandin.
Hey, Mr. Sandin.
I talked to John over at repairs, and he took care of it.
It's all fine.
The system is working without a hitch.
You are going to be locked in tight tonight.
Thank you, sir.
All right, Mr. Faulk.
Safe night.
James Sandin's office.
Sue? Yeah,
I took care of Faulk.
What do you know, did you hear anything?
You're number one,
Mr. Sandin.
All right. Yeah.
You got it, sir. You came out on top.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Congratulations to you, too, Susan.
You don't have to say that.
No, Susan, it's a team win.
Thank you.
Okay. All right, well, safe night.
Safe night, Mr. Sandin.
The poor can't afford to protect themselves.
They're the victims tonight.
We all got our own opinions.
That's what makes this country great.
Holly, line four.
What are your Purge plans?
Locking down behind my brand new security system.
Pete from Northern Virginia, what's your Purge plan?
I'm gonna hunt down my boss.
That son of a bitch has it coming.
Clearly, more people will be Purging this year than ever before.
American streets will be running red tonight,
when people release the beast in record numbers.
Mr. Cali! You're getting one last walk in before lockdown, huh?
Yep.
Did you do the systems check I recommended?
Of course.
No problems.
Yeah, it's the same one I use.
I only sell the best.
Nobody's bothering us tonight.
You have a safe night, Mr. Sandin.
Thanks.
Don't forget to buy your blue Baptisias.
Display those flowers proudly, folks, okay?
Show your support for this important evening.
Safe night to everyone.
Home again, home again.
Jiggity-jig.
Release the beast, and Purge in our American streets.
Your New Founding Fathers...
Hey, honey, I'm home!
I'm in the kitchen.
What a day, what a day.
Everybody's doing security checks, it's crazy.
Traffic's even worse than last year.
Something smells good.
Hey.
Ta-da!
Ah.
I'll put them in water, get them outside.
Okay.
Where are the kids?
Their rooms, of course.
We got an hour before commencement, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Dinner's nearly ready, so, uh, hurry up.
All right.
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh.
One thing?
Yeah?
Zoey is getting worse.
She's been pouting all day.
I can't stand it.
So, you're gonna have to do something about the Henry situation.
There's nothing to do about it.
He's 18, he's not getting any younger.
She's just gonna have to sulk.
She'll get over it.
But I've got some good news for all of us.
I'll tell you at dinner.
History has proven this over and over again.
We are inherently a violent species.
Wars, genocide, murder.
The denial of our true selves is the problem.
The Purge not only contains societal violence to a single evening,
but the country-wide catharsis creates psychological stability
by letting us release the aggression we all have inside of us.
I love you.
Let's growl.
What?
Growl.
Why?
Because everyone says,
"I love you."
It's used, and we need to find our own thing.
Oh.
Go like this...
No, I'll look silly.
Come on.
No.
Do it. It's our way of saying,
"I love you." Try it.
Do it.
I think my dad's home.
I'm sorry, baby. You've got to get going.
I'm sorry.
And you have to get home before lockdown.
Come on.
Come here.
Someone's getting ready for tonight.
Be careful.
Mary!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I come bearing gifts.
What have I done to deserve a gift, Grace?
Oh, I have a new hobby.
Baking. Grace. Mary.
I made way too many cookies.
Hi!
Ooh! Cookies!
I hope you're hungry.
Those cookies are crazy good.
They're lovely.
Have a safe night, ladies.
Bye!
Good night!
Bye!
Thank you, Grace.
Yeah, just what the Halversons needed.
More cookies, right?
Oh!
The new addition you built, it's just amazing.
Thank you.
Not everyone had the year you did, Mary.
What do you mean?
You know your husband sold a new security system to almost every home in this community.
You know, some people are actually saying this neighborhood paid for that new addition on your home.
Are people really saying that?
Relax, it's just good old neighborhood gossip.
Nothing to worry about.
You're too sensitive.
So, are you having your annual party, Grace?
No. Too much trouble.
We're just gonna lock down, watch some Purge events.
Nothing special.
Well, um, thank you for the cookies.
Good night.
You're welcome.
Have a safe night, Mary.
And you, Grace.
Christ.
You scared me to death.
You can't keep creeping up on me like that, Charlie.
So, quit playing with Timmy and come help me set the table, kiddo. Okay?
Now.
Christ! Charlie, that's twice today.
You're gonna give me a heart attack.
Sorry, Mom.
Look, check it out. I made some adjustments to Timmy.
I installed a night vision program and I insulated his motor, so you can barely hear him.
And he can now play music to accompany him on his missions.
See?
He likes songs from olden times.
Mmm-hmm.
That is very, very cool.
What is it?
What's bothering you?
It's tonight, isn't it?
Just remember all the good the Purge does, okay?
It's all that matters.
Are you hungry?
A little bit.
Good.
Well, take Timmy away and come back and help me finish up, okay?
Mmm. Okay.
Honey, this food is so good.
Isn't it amazing?
Not one carb.
Oh, great.
Not one.
Well, I'd like to hear about everybody's day.
Zoey, you want to go first?
Charlie, what are you doing?
Sorry, I forgot to take my vitals earlier.
Honey...
By the way, there's a slight deviation in my heart rate, but other than that, nothing to worry about.
Okay, thank you.
Zoey, your day.
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's stupid.
Okay, fine.
Calc test, piano. Normal day.
Mmm-hmm.
Who cares?
I do.
I care, very much.
And what about practice?
You ready for your recital?
James.
Of course you are, because you're always ready.
Just make sure your left hand cooperates in that third movement.
When I'm listening, that's what I hear.
All right, can I...
Does anybody mind?
Can I do my day?
- I have some news. Um...
- Go ahead.
I did it. I did it.
All sales are final...
And I'm on top.
My division sold the most upgraded security systems.
Congratulations, Dad.
Thank you.
Congratulations, baby.
Thanks. It's a team effort, you know?
All right, Charlie, you're next.
Well, we studied the history of tonight in History.
And in English, I wrote a story about a man whose love is so powerful, that it can kill people.
So, he cuts out his own heart.
That is so sweet.
You know, he should have cut off his own penis.
Zoey, Zoey...
Eating dinner, no penises!
Charlie, don't encourage her.
Don't fist-bump that!
We're not in the dormitorium, okay?
"Dormitorium?"
Is that even a word?
Get with the times.
God.
Guys, look what time it is.
Oh, wow, it's later than I thought.
All right, it's time for lockdown. Let's go.
Don't even think about it.
Hey, give that back.
Are we in the zoo?
Fine, I want this.
Hey, look at this.
Mr. Sabian and Mr. Barbero are going hunting.
That's daring.
I didn't know they were going to Purge together.
Are they friends?
Hmm. The Ferrins are having a party.
Grace said she wasn't having a party this year.
Just thank God we weren't invited.
She's nice. But, wow, she's annoying.
All right, let's get ready for tonight.
As always, just a precaution.
All right, Mr. Cali is starting his lockdown.
Okay.
Are we ready?
All right, let's hit it.
Okay, Charlie, it's almost time. Hit it.
Release the beast and Purge in our American streets.
Your New Founding Fathers encourage your participation.
This is not a test.
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System
announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge
sanctioned by the U.S. Government.
Weapons of Class Four and lower
have been authorized for use during the Purge.
All other weapons are restricted.
Government officials of ranking 10
have been granted immunity from the Purge
and shall not be harmed.
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime, including murder,
will be legal for
12 continuous hours.
Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable
until tomorrow morning at 7:00
AM when the Purge concludes.
Blessed be our
New Founding Fathers
and America, a nation reborn.
May God be with you all.
Okay, kids. I know bad things do happen tonight.
But we can afford protection.
So, we'll be fine, just like always.
No worries.
Okay? Okay?
Can I go now?
I would prefer to be miserable in my room.
Of course you may.
Thank you for being here.
Where are you going, bud?
Hey. Charlie.
Why don't you guys do it?
Because we don't feel the need to, Charlie. That's all.
So, if you felt the need to, you would kill someone tonight?
Look, I know this is difficult to understand at your age, but tonight allows people a release for all the hatred and violence and aggression that they keep up inside them.
Okay? And yes, if your mother and I were so inclined, uh, we would participate.
Because it works.
You don't remember how bad it was, Charlie.
The poverty, all the crime.
This night saved our country.
Hey...
Why don't you go relax?
We're all done here.
I've got some paperwork to process to get my bonus.
Then we should watch a movie later with the kids.
Jesus, Henry!
You scared the hell out of me.
Wait, what are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
So, I snuck in when you were eating.
Baby, you can't be in here.
My dad will lose his mind if he sees you here now.
Come on.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Of course.
We're looking at some live feeds from around the country
and discussing the Purge with criminologist Tommy Aagaard.
Thanks, Nicole.
Now, is the Purge really about releasing aggression
and containing violence,
or is it something else?
Purge detractors often postulate
this evening is actually about the elimination of the poor,
the needy, the sick.
Those unable to defend themselves.
The eradication of the so-called
"non-contributing members" of society,
ultimately unburdening the economy.
Is the Purge really about money?
Either way, crime is down.
The economy is flourishing.
I can't do this.
Um...
Did I do something?
No. I... Um...
I just...
I didn't come here to see you.
I came to see your father.
What? Why?
It's time to straighten this out.
He cannot forbid you from seeing me.
That's crazy.
It might be crazy, but he's not going to change his mind.
He thinks you're too old for me.
Talking to him is only going to make him more angry and he'll make it more difficult for us.
I promise everything is gonna be okay.
America was collapsing.
A quadruple dip recession followed by a full market crash.
A skyrocketing debt, multiple wars
and a significant dollar devaluation...
All precipitating the worst economic disaster
in the history of the United States.
Crime and poverty rose exponentially,
and the New Founding Fathers, just months after being elected
came up with this audacious notion,
the decriminalization of murder for one night.
A lawful outlet for American rage.
A way to contain crime.
The undeniable fact is, this is working.
I thought I heard gunshots.
A couple of streets back, maybe?
Gunshots are gonna happen tonight, okay?
It's nothing.
It's probably somebody just firing off a few rounds before going hunting.
Come on.
Let's go relax.
Hold on.
Look.
He can't kick me out.
He's gonna be forced to listen to what I have to say.
I don't know.
One on one.
Man to man, no BS.
I'm gonna explain to him that sure, I may be older, but you're also very mature.
So age difference is not a problem.
I'll tell him how much I love you.
10 years ago, we could barely afford rent.
Now we're thinking about buying a boat.
Crazy.
Yeah... Uh-oh.
This one has a car garage.
Who needs a car on a boat?
They're coming after me.
They're gonna kill me!
Can anyone hear me?
Help me!
Someone, please, help me!
They're coming after me, all right?
Can anybody help me?
Please. They killed...
I just need to get somewhere safe.
Does anybody hear me?
Look, I won't hurt you!
I don't want to die.
I don't deserve this.
Why won't anybody help me?
I just need somewhere to hide.
Somebody, please, just open the door for me.
They're coming, they're coming.
Somebody, please!
They're gonna kill me!
What the hell?
Come here!
Let's go!
This way!
Come on!
Hurry!
Come on! Hurry!
What the hell?
Charlie! Zoey!
This way! Hurry!
Go! Go!
Hurry!
What the hell is going on?
Mr. Sandin.
James, he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!
Oh, my God!
Henry!
Henry! Henry!
Oh, God!
James. Are you hit?
I didn't hit Zoey, did I?
I think she's okay.
Zoey! Zoey!
Charlie, come here.
Mom, what's going on?
Charlie, where is he, huh?
Where's the man?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
Who is he? Why did you let him in our home?
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping him.
Charlie, Jesus Christ.
What the hell? Huh?
We have no idea what this man is capable of.
Enough.
Enough, James.
He's gone. We don't know what Henry might do.
And we're not safe out here.
We don't know where Zoey is.
You're right.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
Henry! Henry.
Hang on.
Henry!
Come on.
Henry?
Okay.
Here's the plan.
You two stay put here, and I'll just...
I'll go out there and I'm gonna find Zoey and I'm gonna bring her back here.
Henry tried to kill you.
James...
I know. Mary, I got to make sure she's okay.
Okay? I have to.
He didn't shoot at me.
I'll find her,
I can go. I'll be fine.
No, no, no...
I can't let you go with that man out there.
Okay?
I can't let you do that.
Baby, I...
Let me go get her.
You just stay here with Charlie. Okay?
You be careful, okay?
I will.
Zoey? Zoey?
Zoey? It's me.
You okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, Mom.
Okay.
Mom?
Mom?
Charlie? Mom?
Charlie, you wait here. I'm gonna be right outside the door.
Okay.
Zoey.
Zoey?
Mom?
Zoey, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
Is Charlie okay?
Where's Dad? Is he all right?
Everyone's fine.
Morn, I didn't know Henry was going to do that.
I didn't know he was going to...
Why would he do that?
Mom? Charlie, just give me a second, okay?
Mom, he died.
Keep the door closed.
- He's dead. Henry's dead.
- Mom?
Mom!
Charlie, just give me a second.
Zoey, let's see what Charlie wants.
Mom, now!
What is it, baby?
You need to see this.
Tell Dad I'm sorry.
Zoey, please!
Zoey!
Zoey?
Zoey.
Hey,
Mr. Sandin, are you home?
Wait, James,
I have to talk to you.
Henry is dead.
I killed him.
I know. I saw Zoey.
Is she okay? Is she hurt?
Is she in there?
She's not hurt.
I couldn't get her to come with me.
What are we gonna do?
I have to show you something.
Oh, God, I know.
That one is saying something.
...and Mrs. Sandin.
Your home tells me you're good folk, just like us.
One of the "haves."
And your blue flowers tell me that you support the Purge.
We want to treat you fairly, so listen closely.
Let me introduce us.
We are some fine, young, very educated guys and gals.
We have gotten gussied up in our most terrifying guises,
as we do every year,
ready to violate, annihilate, and cleanse our souls.
But things took a turn.
Our target escaped us, and...
Several of your dear neighbors informed us that you, the Sandins,
have inexplicably given him sanctuary.
Mr. and Mrs., the man you're sheltering is nothing
but a dirty, homeless pig.
A grotesque menace to our just society,
who had the audacity to fight back,
killing one of us when we attempted to execute him tonight.
The pig doesn't know his place,
and now he needs to be taught a lesson.
You need to return him to us.
Alive.
So that we may Purge as we are entitled.
Here's the plan, Sandins.
You have until our provisions arrive,
provisions which will help us break into your elegant home.
If you don't...
If you don't deliver him by the aforementioned time,
we'll release the beast on him...
And on you.
And, um, we can enter any home we want.
And we will want as wanting is our will on this fine night.
Don't force us to hurt you.
We don't want to kill our own.
Please, just let us Purge.
Toodle-oo, Sandins.
Cut it. Cut it now.
The monitors are working on backup.
The power's out in the whole house.
James, they can't get in here, right?
They can't get into our home.
I don't know.
It's hard to say.
You don't know?
You sell these security systems.
What do you mean, you don't know?
We have tested the system. It works 99 percent of the time.
It looks good. It's strong.
People stay away.
It looks good?
It's not built for worst-case scenarios.
Is it impenetrable?
No, nothing's impenetrable.
Things like this are not supposed to happen in our neighborhood.
Well, they are happening, James.
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?
Okay, listen, just sit down.
Sit down, please.
We gotta calm down.
Sit down.
All right. Sit down, sit down.
Listen.
Okay, to answer your question, yes, they could get in here.
They could tunnel underneath us.
They could smoke us out.
They could devise a battering ram, okay?
I'm sorry, but it's true. So, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna give them what they want.
We're gonna find that man and we're gonna force him outside.
Now, we have guns, and he doesn't.
But they'll kill him.
Why should he die?
It's him or us, Charlie.
Why don't you give us the homeless man?
No one will miss him when he's gone.
Pretty please.
Wait a minute.
Shit.
Where is he?
There he is.
Look at me.
Come on, look over here.
Where are you?
Come on.
Dear Mr. Sandin!
Sorry to interrupt, but
I'd love to have a word.
Meet me by your front door. I just need a moment, good sir.
There you are.
Thank you for accepting my invitation.
Tell me, why haven't you delivered the filthy swine to me yet?
Are you protecting him?
I surely hope not,
Mr. Sandin.
No. Of course not.
We just can't find him.
You see, this is a misunderstanding.
My son let him in.
He's a young boy.
He doesn't know better.
But I support what occurs here tonight 100 percent, okay?
I sell security equipment.
So, I would never deny yours, or anybody else's right to Purge.
Just give us the homeless pig, you fuck!
Sorry about that.
I don't condone that kind of behavior.
But just keep in mind,
Mr. Sandin...
He was my friend, and you are not.
Our equipment is arriving soon.
And we will get in.
Send out he, or that...
Will be thee.
I'll go get him.
You should do that.
Hey, Charlie.
I don't know what's going on.
There are people outside.
Um...
And Henry's dead.
I'll be okay.
I have his gun.
Stay where you are.
Please be safe, okay?
I'm going to go hide in your secret spot.
No.
All right? I love you.
Don't.
Zoey.
Get back.
Into the hall.
Let's go.
Drop your gun.
Dad, please.
Drop it.
Don't hurt her.
Lower your weapon.
Zoey, I will not let him hurt you.
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch.
I will let her go when this night is over.
You're gonna get us all killed. You know that.
They're coming in here, and they are gonna kill us all.
They are gonna come in here, and they are... Back up.
You got to leave my family out of this. Okay?
If you don't drop your gun,
I will hurt her and I will hurt you.
We didn't do anything to you.
We don't deserve this. I don't deserve this either.
Now, listen, I don't want to hurt any of you, but I am not dying tonight!
Drop your gun.
Please.
Drop it.
Put the gun down.
Listen to me.
Okay.
You are going to die tonight.
And you can either die like a man, and walk outside there by yourself, or you can die like a coward and get my wife and my children killed along with you.
Okay? So take that gun away from my daughter's head!
Shoot him, Mary! Shoot him!
Get off me!
Stop!
Shit. Shit.
Mary? Mary!
Zoey!
She's unconscious. She hit her head.
Mary, are you okay?
We got to get some rope.
What?
Mary, we have to get some rope and we have to tie him up and get him outside.
And we're gonna end this goddamn night.
All right?
Do you hear me?
Okay. Okay.
All right. Come on,
Charlie, help me.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
Okay, I'm almost done here. As soon as you get the legs secure...
You got it? All right, let me see.
Let me see. Good job.
You're doing great, honey.
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna roll him into that chair, and we're gonna drag him outside and we're gonna be done, all right?
Mmm-hmm. You got it?
All right, we ready?
Charlie, just concentrate on your sister, okay?
See if she's waking up.
Except, Charlie,
I need the light.
Thank you, son. Okay.
Hey, good job.
You're doing great.
All right. Let me get the chair, here.
Okay, we are almost done.
I'm gonna pick him up on the count of three, all right?
You're gonna help me.
Keep the light on us, Charlie.
Ready? One, two...
Three!
Okay.
Great. Now, let's get the tape and tape him in there.
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
I've got him, I've got him.
I got him.
Okay. Okay, all right!
You got to calm down. He's gonna break this tape!
Press on his wound.
What?
Get the letter opener and press on his wound!
Get the letter opener on the desk!
Grab the letter opener!
No, Mom!
Listen to me. I am just trying to protect my family.
Just calm down.
Mom!
Come on, do it.
Do it, Mary!
Do it!
Press on his wound!
Yes!
Mom!
You want her to do it again?
Mom, stop!
Just do it again, Mary.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Ready to sit in the chair?
Yeah, he's ready.
Help me up. Help me up.
Ready? Okay.
Stay there, all right?
Stop it.
Just let me take you in this chair. All right?
Mary, where's the tape?
You are making this much more difficult than it needs to be.
You understand me? Huh?
Christ, look at us.
Look at this man.
Look at what we're doing to him.
Come on, Mary.
Let's get this over with.
Come on, Mary.
It's okay, Mary.
I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.
I need you right now, okay?
Hey, look at me. Huh?
Look at me, Mary.
Mary.
It's wrong. It's so wrong.
We don't have a choice.
This is so wrong.
We don't have any other choice.
Don't touch me.
Look at you.
No, no, no.
Don't touch me.
When did this happen?
James, look at you.
What the hell happened to us, James?
Charlie.
Charlie? Baby, where did you go?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie, where are you, baby?
Charlie!
Zoey. Hey, are you all right?
Sit down, sit down.
You hit your head.
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
I am so sorry about Henry, okay?
I'm so sorry.
But we're gonna make it through tonight, all right?
We will, and everything is gonna be okay.
It's not gonna be okay.
What?
Look at what you're doing.
Nothing is ever going to be okay again.
Don't say that.
Save your children.
Take me outside.
Charlie? Charlie!
I want all these barricades down!
Get chains on every door and every window!
James, where's Zoey?
I don't know, she ran out here.
Those freaks outside are coming in!
They have chains on the doors and windows.
They're gonna pull them off and come inside.
Maybe you were right.
No, I wasn't right about anything.
You're not sending him outside?
I have another idea.
What are you gonna do?
Charlie!
Charlie, listen to me.
You take this gun.
Dad, are you sending him outside?
No. All right?
You're gonna go hide in the basement and you're not gonna come out for anybody, all right?
Okay.
You're a good boy.
All right, go, go.
You just gave our son a gun.
You want to tell me what the hell we're doing?
We're gonna fight.
I want you to take this one as well.
Safety's off.
You're gonna use a lot of rounds.
What do I do?
You're gonna cover the other side of the house.
This is our home.
Our kids live here.
Anybody tries to come in, you blast them.
You will not hesitate.
Mmm.
Dear Mr. and Mrs.!
I'm sorry to tell you this, but your time is essentially up.
And you failed!
You failed to deliver the homeless swine!
I'm very disappointed as you fine folk should know better!
That piece of filth that you are protecting exists only to serve our need to Purge!
So, I bid thee farewell, sweet Sandins.
Release the beast, boys.
Let the killing commence!
Run!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.
We've got to get out of here.
Come on, come on, come on.
Cooper, come look at little lady Sandin.
She's exquisite.
Save her for me.
Dad.
Are you okay?
Yes, Dad, I'm okay.
You stay here, okay?
Are Mommy and Zoey okay?
Yeah, they're gonna be fine.
Mmm...
Shit.
Shit!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Your soul has been cleansed, Mr. Sandin.
You've Purged.
Just one question for you.
Was his life really worth yours?
Your family's?
Thank you for this unforgettable
Purge, Mr. Sandin.
No! No! No!
Get off!
Get off of me!
James!
Let go of me!
Please, don't!
Please don't kill me.
Please don't!
James!
Please, don't!
Please, don't!
Please!
James!
James!
Please!
Please, don't!
Don't! Please don't!
James.
James.
Charlie! Charlie!
Zoey!
Dad!
Sorry.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
You got a lot of heart, Mr. Sandin.
Blessed be America...
A nation reborn.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
We saw that you were having some trouble.
We decided to help you.
You saved us.
I don't know what to say.
Don't thank us too much, Mary.
The truth is, you're ours, not theirs.
What do you mean "ours"?
What do you mean?
What do you mean "ours"?
Dad?
No, no, no!
Dad!
Wait! Wait!
Dad!
James is dead.
Mary and the kids will have to do.
Let's tie them up. We'll kill them right here.
No, no, no.
What do you mean?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Come on.
No! No!
No!
No! No! No!
Mom! Mom!
Cali, get the tape!
Don't touch my fucking children!
Don't you touch my fucking kids!
Let them go!
Let them go!
Right now! You let my fucking kids go!
Shut up, Mary!
Shut up!
Right now!
Mary! Shut up!
I swear to God, I will shoot him right now.
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this right now?
When your barricades came down, we saw an opportunity to cleanse ourselves of our hatred.
You made so much money off of us and then you just stuck it in our faces.
You all think you're so damn perfect.
I just need you to listen to me, Grace.
I'm really begging you right now.
Do not do this to my children, please.
They're my children, please.
Please, not my children.
I can't let you do that.
We have to, Mary. That's what this night is all about.
I am begging you.
I'm really begging you.
I can't let you do this.
We'll be better people and you'll have sacrificed yourselves to make the world a better place.
Mom...
Mom!
You're frightening them.
Please don't.
Please let me hold my children.
Mary, no, no.
It's over.
Untie them.
It's over.
Please untie my hands.
Hmm?
Grace?
It's time for you to quiet down, Mary, and let us do our duty as Americans.
Mom.
Sweetheart...
Zoey, look at me, okay?
Just look at your mama.
Just look at me.
Just look at me.
Blessed be the New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls.
Blessed be America...
Blessed be America, a nation reborn.
I'll go first and then...
We'll take turns.
Timmy?
Don't move.
Drop your weapons right now.
Untie them, let's go.
Right now.
Your call.
Just get it over with.
Kill us quickly.
No.
Oh, for God's sake!
Just do it!
Come on!
Mom, they were going to kill us.
It doesn't matter.
We are gonna play the rest of this night out in motherfucking peace.
Does anyone have a problem with that?
Did you enjoy
Grace's Purge party...
Mr. Halverson?
Go fuck yourself.
Sorry, I can't hear you.
It was very nice.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you all had a grand time.
Didn't you hear what I said?
No more killing tonight!
Is it that hard to understand?
Oh, my...
Now get the hell out of my house.
Wait.
Are you going to be okay?
Thank you.
Good luck.
Just after 7:00 AM, March 22nd,
the Annual Purge has just concluded.
This is your American morning news program.
And reports are coming in from all around the country
as police, firefighters and paramedics...
The New Founding Fathers have released an early statement saying
this was the most successful Purge yet.
I am walking...
I should say "stumbling" through downtown Los Angeles,
and there are literally bodies everywhere.
I witnessed a group of young men
breaking into the tenement next to me,
and they were dragging people out
and just executing them on the street.
Hundreds have gathered in Times Square
for a public vigil
thanking all those who were killed last night
for their sacrifice to make this country a safer place.
They are turning people away
from emergency rooms in Brownsville
as there is simply no more room.
The markets were up this morning
as both gun and home security system
quarterly sales reports were released
announcing profits in both sectors.
We have 364 long days until the next Purge.
So let's get all our Purge talk and analysis in today
while our thoughts are still fresh.
From what I've been reading, it seems like Dallas had the most participants.
I did get a chance to see some live surveillance footage
out of Dallas, Forest Lawn,
and there had to be 200 people in the town square
Purging at the same time.
Never saw anything like this.
I lost my two sons last night.
My boys.
Yeah, I was a proud American.
Not anymore.
This country has taken everything from me.
